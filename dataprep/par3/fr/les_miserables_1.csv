"C’est que, phénomène étrange et qui n’était possible que dans la situation où il était, en volant cet argent à cet enfant, il avait fait une chose dont il n’était déjà plus capable.","It is that, strange phenomenon and which was only possible in the situation where he was, by stealing this money from this child, he had done something of which he was already no longer capable.",This was because by stealing money from that child he had done something of which he was no longer capable – a strange phenomenon that was possible only in his present situation.,"It was because,—strange phenomenon, and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself,—in stealing the money from that child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.","It was a strange phenomenon, possible only in the condition in which he then was, but the fact is, that in stealing this money from that child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable."
"Il crut se voir lui-même, vieilli, non pas sans doute absolument semblable de visage, mais tout pareil d’attitude et d’aspect, avec ces cheveux hérissés, avec cette prunelle fauve et inquiète, avec cette blouse, tel qu’il était le jour où il entrait à Digne, plein de haine et cachant dans son âme ce hideux trésor de pensées affreuses qu’il avait mis dix-neuf ans à ramasser sur le pavé du bagne.","He thought he saw himself, aged, not doubtless absolutely similar in face, but just the same in attitude and aspect, with that bristling hair, with that tawny, worried pupil, with that blouse, just as he was the day he entered Digne, full of hatred and hiding in his soul that hideous treasure of dreadful thoughts which he had taken nineteen years to pick up on the pavement of the prison.","He thought he saw himself, aged, with not exactly the same features, to be sure, but identical in attitude and appearance, with that bristling hair, those wary brown eyes, that smock, just as he was the day he arrived at Digne, full of hatred and concealing in his heart that hideous hoard of dreadful thoughts he had spent nineteen years accumulating in the chain gang.","He thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely the same in face, of course, but exactly similar in attitude and aspect, with his bristling hair, with that wild and uneasy eye, with that blouse, just as it was on the day when he entered D——, full of hatred, concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.","He thought he saw himself, older, doubtless, not precisely the same in features, but alike in attitude and appearance, with that bristling hair, with those wild and restless eyeballs, with that blouse—just as he was on the day he entered D——, full of hatred, and concealing in his soul that hideous hoard of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in gathering upon the floor of the galleys."
"Puis, regardant fixement M. Madeleine, il poursuivit en appuyant sur chacun des mots qu’il prononçait :","Then, staring fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on emphasizing each of the words he uttered:","Then, staring intently at Monsieur Madeleine, he went on, dwelling on every word he uttered, ‘Monsieur Madeleine, I’ve never known but one man capable of doing what you ask.’","Then, gazing fixedly at M.

"Les cuirassiers n’avaient point réussi, en ce sens que le centre n’était pas enfoncé. Tout le monde ayant le plateau, personne ne l’avait, et en somme il restait pour la grande part aux anglais. Wellington avait le village et la plaine culminante ; Ney n’avait que la crête et la pente. Des deux côtés on semblait enraciné dans ce sol funèbre.","The cuirassiers had not succeeded, in the sense that the center was not sunk. Everyone having the tray, no one had it, and in short it remained for the most part with the English. Wellington had the village and the high plain; Ney only had the ridge and the slope. Both sides seemed rooted in this funereal soil.","The cuirassiers had not succeeded, in the sense that there had been no breakthrough in the centre. With everyone holding the plateau, no one held it, and in short it remained for the most part with the English. Wellington had the village and the flat ground above, Ney had only the ridge and the slope. On both sides they seemed rooted in that lugubrious soil.","The cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not broken through. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it, and in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English. Wellington held the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the crest and the slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides.","The cuirassiers had not succeeded, in this sense, that the centre was not broken. All holding the plateau, nobody held it, and in fact it remained for the most part with the English. Wellington held the village and the crowning plain; Ney held only the crest and the slope.

"Bizarre coïncidence numérique, vingt-six bataillons allaient recevoir ces vingt-six escadrons. Derrière la crête du plateau, à l’ombre de la batterie masquée, l’infanterie anglaise, formée en treize carrés, deux bataillons par carré, et sur deux lignes, sept sur la première, six sur la seconde, la crosse à l’épaule, couchant en joue ce qui allait venir, calme, muette, immobile, attendait. Elle ne voyait pas les cuirassiers et les cuirassiers ne la voyaient pas. Elle écoutait monter cette marée d’hommes. Elle entendait le grossissement du bruit des trois mille chevaux, le frappement alternatif et symétrique des sabots au grand trot, le froissement des cuirasses, le cliquetis des sabres, et une sorte de grand souffle farouche. Il y eut un silence redoutable, puis, subitement, une longue file de bras levés brandissant des sabres apparut au-dessus de la crête, et les casques, et les trompettes, et les étendards, et trois mille têtes à moustaches grises criant : vive l’empereur ! Toute cette cavalerie déboucha sur le plateau, et ce fut comme l’entrée d’un tremblement de terre.","Strange numerical coincidence, twenty-six battalions were going to receive these twenty-six squadrons. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow of the masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares, two battalions per square, and in two lines, seven on the first, six on the second, the butt at the shoulder, aiming at what was to come, calm, mute, motionless, waiting. She did not see the cuirassiers and the cuirassiers did not see her. She listened to this rising tide of men. She heard the growing sound of the three thousand horses, the alternating and symmetrical tapping of hooves at a brisk trot, the rustling of breastplates, the clanking of sabers, and a kind of great wild breath. There was a dreadful silence, then suddenly a long line of raised arms brandishing sabers appeared above the ridge, and the helmets, and the trumpets, and the standards, and three thousand gray-moustached heads crying: Long live the emperor ! All this cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was like the entry of an earthquake.","By a bizarre numerical coincidence, twenty-six battalions were to meet these twenty-six squadrons. Calm, silent, motionless, behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow of their concealed battery, in thirteen square formations, two battalions to a square, arranged in two lines, seven in the first, six in the second, with rifle butts to their shoulders, aiming at what was about to appear, the English infantry lay in wait. They could not see the cuirassiers and the cuirassiers could not see them. They listened to this rising tide of men. They heard the swelling sound of the three thousand horse, the alternate and symmetric beat of their cantering hoofs, the rattle of the cuirasses, the clinking of the sabres and a kind of mighty fierce breathing. There was a terrible silence, then suddenly a long row of raised arms brandishing sabres appeared over the ridge, and helmets and trumpets and standards, and three thousand grey-mustachioed heads shouting, ‘Long live the emperor!’ All this cavalry surged on to the plateau, and it was like the arrival of an earthquake.","Odd numerical coincidence,—twenty-six battalions rode to meet twenty-six battalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow of the masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares, two battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in the first line, six in the second, the stocks of their guns to their shoulders, taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing, waited, calm, mute, motionless. They did not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirassiers did not see them. They listened to the rise of this flood of men. They heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse, the alternate and symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the jingling of the cuirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage breathing. There ensued a most terrible silence; then, all at once, a long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appeared above the crest, and casques, trumpets, and standards, and three thousand heads with gray moustaches, shouting, “Vive l’Empereur!” All this cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was like the appearance of an earthquake.","An odd numerical coincidence, twenty-six battalions were to receive these twenty-six squadrons. Behind the crest of the plateau under cover of the masked battery, the English infantry, formed in thirteen squares, two battalions to the square, and upon two lines—seven on the first, and six on the second—with musket to the shoulder, and eye upon their sights, waiting calm, silent, and immovable. They could not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirassiers could not see them. They listened to the rising of this tide of men. They heard the increasing sound of three thousand horses, the alternate and measured striking of their hoofs at full trot, the rattling of the cuirasses, the clicking of the sabres, and a sort of fierce roar of the coming host.

"La réponse était dure, mais elle allait au but avec la rigidité d’une pointe d’acier. L’évêque en tressaillit, il ne lui vint aucune riposte ; mais il était froissé de cette façon de nommer Bossuet. Les meilleurs esprits ont leurs fétiches, et parfois se sentent vaguement meurtris des manques de respect de la logique.","The answer was harsh, but it got to the point with the rigidity of a steel point. The bishop was startled, no answer came to him; but he was offended by this way of naming Bossuet. The best minds have their fetishes, and sometimes feel vaguely bruised by lack of respect for logic.","The retort was a harsh one, but it found its mark with the sureness of a steel-tipped blade. The bishop winced. He had no answer but he was offended by this reference to Bossuet. The best of minds have their idols and sometimes feel vaguely hurt by logic’s want of respect.","The retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply occurred to him; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to Bossuet. The best of minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic.","The answer was severe, but it reached its aim with the keenness of a dagger. The bishop was staggered, no reply presented itself; but it shocked him to hear Bossuet spoken of in that manner. The best men have their fetishes, and sometimes they feel almost crushed at the little respect that logic shows them."

"Les premières minutes passées, quand le regard commençait à se faire à ce demi-jour de cave, il essayait de franchir la grille, mais il n’allait pas plus loin que six pouces au delà.

"Les bénédictines-bernardines de Martin Verga, cloîtrées il y a cinquante ans au Petit-Picpus, chantent les offices sur une psalmodie grave, plain-chant pur, et toujours à pleine voix toute la durée de l’office.

"Le centre de l’armée anglaise, un peu concave, très dense et très compacte, était fortement situé. Il occupait le plateau de Mont-Saint-Jean, ayant derrière lui le village et devant lui la pente, assez âpre alors. Il s’adossait à cette forte maison de pierre, qui était à cette époque un bien domanial de Nivelles et qui marque l’intersection des routes, masse du seizième siècle si robuste que les boulets y ricochaient sans l’entamer. Tout autour du plateau, les anglais avaient taillé çà et là les haies, fait des embrasures dans les aubépines, mis une gueule de canon entre deux branches, crénelé les buissons. Leur artillerie était en embuscade sous les broussailles. Ce travail punique, incontestablement autorisé par la guerre qui admet le piège, était si bien fait que Haxo, envoyé par l’empereur à neuf heures du matin pour reconnaître les batteries ennemies, n’en avait rien vu, et était revenu dire à Napoléon qu’il n’y avait pas d’obstacle, hors les deux barricades barrant les routes de Nivelles et de Genappe. C’était le moment où la moisson est haute ; sur la lisière du plateau, un bataillon de la brigade Kempt, le 95e, armé de carabines, était couché dans les grands blés.","The center of the English army, a little concave, very dense and very compact, was strongly located. He occupied the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, with the village behind him and the slope in front of him, which was quite steep then. It leaned against this strong stone house, which was at that time a domanial property of Nivelles and which marks the intersection of the roads, a mass of the sixteenth century so robust that the cannonballs ricocheted there without cutting into it. All around the plateau, the English had cut the hedges here and there, made embrasures in the hawthorns, placed a cannon's mouth between two branches, crenellated the bushes. Their artillery was in ambush under the brushwood. This Punic work, incontestably authorized by the war which admits the trap, was so well done that Haxo, sent by the Emperor at nine o'clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy batteries, had seen nothing of it, and had returned to tell Napoleon that there were no obstacles except the two barricades blocking the roads to Nivelles and Genappe. It was the time when the harvest is high; on the edge of the plateau, a battalion of Kempt's brigade, the 95th, armed with carbines, was lying in the tall corn.","The centre of the English army, curved slightly inwards, very dense and very compact, was strongly positioned. It occupied the plateau of Mont-St-Jean, with the village behind and the slope, at that time quite steep, in front of it. It was protected from the rear by the solid stone house, which in those days belonged to the Nivelles estate and marks where the roads intersect, a sixteenth-century pile so sturdy that cannon-balls rebounded off it without breaching it. All over the plateau the English had here and there hewn the hedges, cut embrasures in the hawthorn trees, placed the barrel of a cannon between two branches, crenellated bushes. Their artillery lay in ambush beneath the scrub. This Punic labour, undeniably sanctioned by war that permits ruse, was so well executed that Haxo, sent by the emperor at nine o’clock in the morning to reconnoitre enemy batteries, saw nothing and returned to tell Napoleon that there was no obstacle except for the two barricades blocking the roads to Nivelles and Genappe. It was just that time of year when the cereal crops are high. On the edge of the plateau a battalion of Kempt’s brigade, the 95th, lay in the rye, armed with carbines.","The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and very compact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, and in front of it the slope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on that stout stone dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and which marks the intersection of the roads—a pile of the sixteenth century, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it without injuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges here and there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat of a cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery was ambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, incontestably authorized by war, which permits traps, was so well done, that Haxo, who had been despatched by the Emperor at nine o’clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy’s batteries, had discovered nothing of it, and had returned and reported to Napoleon that there were no obstacles except the two barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to Genappe. It was at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of the plateau a battalion of Kempt’s brigade, the 95th, armed with carabines, was concealed in the tall wheat.","The centre of the English army, slightly concave, very dense and very compact, held a strong position. It occupied the plateau of Mont Saint Jean, with the village behind it and in front the declivity, which at that time was steep. At the rear it rested on this strong stone-house, then an outlying property of Nivelles, which marks the intersection of the roads, a sixteenth century pile so solid that the balls ricocheted against it without injuring it. All about the plateau, the English had cut away the hedges here and there, made embrasures in the hawthorns, thrust the mouth of a cannon between two branches, made loopholes in the thickets. Their artillery was in ambush under the shrubbery. This punic labour, undoubtedly fair in war, which allows snares, was so well done that Haxo, sent by the emperor at nine o’clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy’s batteries, saw nothing of it, and returned to tell Napoleon that there was no obstacle, except the two barricades across the Nivelles and Genappe roads. It was the season when grain is at its height; upon the verge of the plateau, a battalion of Kempt’s brigade, the 95th, armed with carbines, was lying in the tall wheat."

Même, il faut le dire, dans cette opinion politique que nous venons de lui reprocher et que nous sommes disposé à juger presque sévèrement, il était tolérant et facile, peut-être plus que nous qui parlons ici. — Le portier de la maison de ville avait été placé là par l’empereur. C’était un vieux sous-officier de la vieille garde, légionnaire d’Austerlitz, bonapartiste comme l’aigle. Il échappait dans l’occasion à ce pauvre diable des paroles peu réfléchies que la loi d’alors qualifiait propos séditieux. Depuis que le profil impérial avait disparu de la légion d’honneur, il ne s’habillait jamais dans l’ordonnance, comme il disait, afin de ne pas être forcé de porter sa croix. Il avait ôté lui-même dévotement l’effigie impériale de la croix que Napoléon lui avait donnée, cela faisait un trou, et il n’avait rien voulu mettre à la place. Plutôt mourir, disait-il, que de porter sur mon cœur les trois crapauds ! Il raillait volontiers tout haut Louis XVIII. Vieux goutteux à guêtres d’anglais ! disait-il, qu’il s’en aille en Prusse avec son salsifis ! Heureux de réunir dans la même imprécation les deux choses qu’il détestait le plus, la Prusse et l’Angleterre. Il en fit tant qu’il perdit sa place. Le voilà sans pain sur le pavé avec femme et enfants. L’évêque le fit venir, le gronda doucement, et le nomma suisse de la cathédrale.","Apart from that, he was and he was, in all things, just, true, equitable, intelligent, humble and worthy; beneficent, and benevolent, which is another beneficence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. Even, it must be said, in this political opinion for which we have just reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost severely, he was tolerant and easy, perhaps more so than we who speak here. “The porter of the town hall had been placed there by the Emperor. He was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a legionnaire from Austerlitz, a Bonapartist like the eagle. On occasion, this poor devil escaped some ill-considered words which the law of the time qualified as seditious. Since the imperial profile had disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed in order, as he said, so as not to be forced to carry his cross. He himself had devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross Napoleon had given him, it made a hole, and he had refused to put anything in its place. Rather die, he said, than wear the three toads on my heart! He gladly laughed aloud at Louis XVIII. Gouty old man in English spats! he would say, let him go to Prussia with his salsify! Happy to unite in the same curse the two things he detested most, Prussia and England. He did so much that he lost his place. Here he is without bread on the pavement with his wife and children. The bishop summoned him, scolded him gently, and appointed him servant of the cathedral.","With this one shortcoming, he was in all things just, sincere, fair, intelligent, humble and worthy, doing good and being kind, which is another way of doing good. He was a priest, a man of wisdom and humanity. It must be said that even in that political opinion for which we have just criticized him, and which we are inclined to judge almost severely, he was tolerant and easy-going, more so perhaps than the person who writes these words. The doorkeeper at the town hall had been given this position by the emperor. He was an elderly non-commissioned officer of the Old Guard, awarded the Legion of Honour at Austerlitz, as Bonapartist as the eagle. This poor fellow occasionally came out with some ill-considered remarks that the law of the day deemed seditious talk. After the imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honour he never wore his ‘regimentals’, as he used to say, so that he would not have to wear his cross. He had himself solemnly removed the imperial effigy from the cross Napoleon had given him, which left a hole, and he would not put anything in its place. ‘I’d sooner die,’ he said, ‘than wear the three toads over my heart!’ He had a readiness to mock Louis XVIII aloud. ‘ Gouty old man in his English gaiters! Let him go to Prussia in his pigtailed wig!’ he would say, delighted to unite in the same denunciation the two things he most detested, Prussia and England. As a result he ended up losing his position. There he was, with no livelihood, out on the street with his wife and children. The bishop sent for him, mildly scolded him and made him verger of the cathedral.","With this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable, intelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is only another sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It must be admitted, that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity, he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are speaking here. The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor. He was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of the Legion of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle. This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks, which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches. After the imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed himself in his regimentals, as he said, so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which Napoleon had given him; this made a hole, and he would not put anything in its place. “I will die,” he said, “rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart!” He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII. “The gouty old creature in English gaiters!” he said; “let him take himself off to Prussia with that queue of his.” He was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested, Prussia and England. He did it so often that he lost his place. There he was, turned out of the house, with his wife and children, and without bread. The Bishop sent for him, reproved him gently, and appointed him beadle in the cathedral.","To conclude: he was always and in everything just, true, equitable, intelligent, humble, and worthy, beneficent, and benevolent, which is another beneficence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. We must say even that in those political opinions which we have been criticising, and which we are disposed to judge almost severely, he was tolerant and yielding, perhaps more than we, who now speak. The doorkeeper of the City Hall had been placed there by the emperor. He was an old subaltern officer of the old Guard, a legionary of Austerlitz, and as staunch a Bonapartist as the eagle. This poor fellow sometimes thoughtlessly allowed words to escape him which the law at that time defined as seditious matters. Since the profile of the emperor had disappeared from the Legion of Honour, he had never worn his badge, as he said, that he might not be compelled to bear his cross. In his devotion he had himself removed the imperial effigy from the cross that Napoleon had given him; it left a hole, and he would put nothing in its place. “Better die,” said he, “than wear the three toads over my heart.” He was always railing loudly at Louis XVIII. “Old gouty-foot with his English spatterdashes!” he would say, “let him go to Prussia with his goat’s-beard,” happy to unite in the same imprecation the two things that he most detested, Prussia and England. He said so much that he lost his place. There he was without bread, and in the street with his wife and children. The bishop sent for him, scolded him a little, and made him doorkeeper in the cathedral."

"Si l’on veut se faire une idée de toutes ces proportions gigantesques dont l’ensemble constitue le vaisseau de ligne, on n’a qu’à entrer sous une des cales couvertes, à six étages, des ports de Brest ou de Toulon.

Le ravin était là, inattendu, béant, à pic sous les pieds des chevaux, profond de deux toises entre son double talus ; le second rang y poussa le premier, et le troisième y poussa le second ; les chevaux se dressaient, se rejetaient en arrière, tombaient sur la croupe, glissaient les quatre pieds en l’air, pilant et bouleversant les cavaliers, aucun moyen de reculer, toute la colonne n’était plus qu’un projectile, la force acquise pour écraser les anglais écrasa les français, le ravin inexorable ne pouvait se rendre que comblé, cavaliers et chevaux y roulèrent pêle-mêle se broyant les uns les autres, ne faisant qu’une chair dans ce gouffre, et, quand cette fosse fut pleine d’hommes vivants, on marcha dessus et le reste passa. Presque un tiers de la brigade Dubois croula dans cet abîme.","The moment was dreadful. The ravine was there, unexpected, gaping, sheer under the horses' feet, two fathoms deep between its double slope; the second rank pushed the first, and the third pushed the second; the horses reared up, threw themselves back, fell on their rumps, slipped all four feet in the air, pounding and upsetting the riders, no way to back up, the whole column was just a projectile, the strength gained to crush the English crushed the French, the inexorable ravine could only be filled, riders and horses rode there pell-mell crushing each other, becoming one flesh in this abyss, and, when this pit was full of living men, we walked on them and the rest passed away. Almost a third of the Dubois brigade collapsed into this abyss.","This was a moment of horror. There, directly under the horses’ hoofs, twelve feet deep between the double embankment, yawned the unexpected ravine. The second line drove the first into it, and the third drove the second. The horses reared then lunged backwards, landed on their rumps, slid with all four legs in the air, unseating and flattening their riders; unable to reverse, the whole column solely a projectile, the impetus gathered to trample the English now trampling the French. The inexorable ravine could only capitulate when filled. Riders and horses rolled pell-mell into the pit, crushing each other, together forming but one flesh, and when this trench was filled with living men they were trodden underfoot and the rest were able to pass. Almost a third of Dubois’s brigade fell into that abyss.","It was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning, directly under the horses’ feet, two fathoms deep between its double slopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushed on the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on their haunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and overwhelming the riders; and there being no means of retreat,—the whole column being no longer anything more than a projectile,—the force which had been acquired to crush the English crushed the French; the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled; horses and riders rolled there pell-mell, grinding each other, forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf: when this trench was full of living men, the rest marched over them and passed on. Almost a third of Dubois’s brigade fell into that abyss.","It was a frightful moment. There was the ravine, unlooked for, yawning at the very feet of the horses, two fathoms deep between its double slope. The second rank pushed in the first, the third pushed in the second; the horses reared, threw themselves over, fell upon their backs, and struggled with their feet in the air, piling up and overturning their riders; no power to retreat; the whole column was nothing but a projectile. The force acquired to crush the English crushed the French. The inexorable ravine could not yield until it was filled; riders and horses rolled in together pell-mell, grinding each other, making common flesh in this dreadful gulf, and when this grave was full of living men, the rest marched over them and passed on. Almost a third of Dubois’ brigade sank into this abyss."
"La tristesse, l’inquiétude, l’anxiété, l’accablement, ce nouveau malheur d’être obligé de s’enfuir la nuit et de chercher un asile au hasard dans Paris pour Cosette et pour lui, la nécessité de régler son pas sur le pas d’un enfant, tout cela, à son insu même, avait changé la démarche de Jean Valjean et imprimé à son habitude de corps une telle sénilité que la police elle-même, incarnée dans Javert, pouvait s’y tromper, et s’y trompa. L’impossibilité d’approcher de trop près, son costume de vieux précepteur émigré, la déclaration de Thénardier qui le faisait grand-père, enfin la croyance de sa mort au bagne, ajoutaient encore aux incertitudes qui s’épaississaient dans l’esprit de Javert.","The sadness, the worry, the anxiety, the overwhelm, this new misfortune of being obliged to flee at night and to seek an asylum at random in Paris for Cosette and for him, the necessity of regulating his step on the step of a child, all this, without his even knowing it, had changed Jean Valjean's gait and imprinted on his bodily habit such senility that the police themselves, embodied in Javert, could be mistaken, and got it wrong. The impossibility of approaching too closely, his costume as an old emigrant tutor, Thénardier's declaration that he was making him a grandfather, finally the belief that he had died in prison, all added to the uncertainties which thickened in the mind of Javert.","Sorrow, worry, anxiety, despondency, this new setback of having to flee by night and blindly seek a safe shelter in Paris for Cosette and himself, the need to adjust his pace to that of the child, all this, without his even being aware of it, had altered Jean Valjean’s gait and placed such a stamp of old age on his usual bearing that even the police, embodied by Javert, might be misled, and indeed he was. The impossibility of getting very close, the way he was dressed as an elderly émigré tutor, Thénardier’s statement that made him a grandfather, and the belief that he had died in prison, added further to the growing uncertainties in Javert’s mind.","Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for Cosette and himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child—all this, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean Valjean’s walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that the police themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in fact, make a mistake. The impossibility of approaching too close, his costume of an émigré preceptor, the declaration of Thénardier which made a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in prison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert’s mind.","Sadness, trouble, anxiety, weight of cares, this new sorrow of being obliged to fly by night, and to seek a chance asylum in Paris for Cosette and himself, the necessity of adapting his pace to the pace if a child, all this, without his knowing it even, had changed Jean Valjean’s gait, and impressed upon his carriage such an appearance of old age that the police itself, incarnated in Javert, could be deceived. The impossibility of approaching too near, his dress of an old preceptor of the emigration, the declaration of Thénardier, who made him a grandfather; finally, the belief in his death at the galleys, added yet more to the uncertainty which was increasing in Javert’s mind."

"Cet homme, dans son vêtement comme dans toute sa personne, réalisait le type de ce qu’on pourrait nommer le mendiant de bonne compagnie, l’extrême misère combinée avec l’extrême propreté. C’est là un mélange assez rare qui inspire aux cœurs intelligents ce double respect qu’on éprouve pour celui qui est très pauvre et pour celui qui est très digne. Il avait un chapeau rond fort vieux et fort brossé, une redingote râpée jusqu’à la corde en gros drap jaune d’ocre, couleur qui n’avait rien de trop bizarre à cette époque, un grand gilet à poches de forme séculaire, des culottes noires devenues grises aux genoux, des bas de laine noire et d’épais souliers à boucles de cuivre. On eût dit un ancien précepteur de bonne maison revenu de l’émigration. A ses cheveux tout blancs, à son front ridé, à ses lèvres livides, à son visage où tout respirait l’accablement et la lassitude de la vie, on lui eût supposé beaucoup plus de soixante ans. A sa démarche ferme, quoique lente, à la vigueur singulière empreinte dans tous ses mouvements, on lui en eût donné à peine cinquante. Les rides de son front étaient bien placées, et eussent prévenu en sa faveur quelqu’un qui l’eût observé avec attention. Sa lèvre se contractait avec un pli étrange, qui semblait sévère et qui était humble. Il y avait au fond de son regard on ne sait quelle sérénité lugubre. Il portait de la main gauche un petit paquet noué dans un mouchoir ; de la droite il s’appuyait sur une espèce de bâton coupé dans une haie. Ce bâton avait été travaillé avec quelque soin, et n’avait pas trop méchant air ; on avait tiré parti des nœuds, et on lui avait figuré un pommeau de corail avec de la cire rouge ; c’était un gourdin, et cela semblait une canne.","This man, in his dress as in his whole person, represented the type of what one might call the beggar of good company, extreme misery combined with extreme cleanliness. This is a rather rare mixture which inspires in intelligent hearts that double respect which one feels for those who are very poor and for those who are very worthy. He had on a very old and heavily brushed round hat, a threadbare frock coat of coarse yellow ocher cloth, a color which was not at all too odd at that time, a large age-old waistcoat with pockets, black breeches turned gray at the knees, black woolen stockings and thick shoes with copper buckles. He looked like a former tutor from a good family who had returned from emigration. From his completely white hair, his wrinkled forehead, his livid lips, his face where everything breathed the despondency and weariness of life, one would have supposed him to be much more than sixty years old. From his firm, though slow gait, from the singular vigor imprinted in all his movements, one would have given him scarcely fifty. The wrinkles on his forehead were well placed, and would have tipped anyone in his favor who had observed him attentively. His lip twitched with an odd fold, which seemed stern and humble. In the depths of his gaze there was an indescribable mournful serenity. He carried in his left hand a small package tied in a handkerchief; on his right he was leaning on a sort of stick cut from a hedge. This staff had been worked with some care, and did not look too bad; the knots had been taken advantage of, and a knob of coral had been figured on it with red wax; it was a club, and it looked like a cane.","In the clothes he wore, as in his entire person, this man was the embodiment of the type that might be called the gentleman beggar, combining extreme poverty with extreme cleanliness. This is quite a rare mixture that inspires intelligent hearts with that dual respect felt for the person who is very poor and the person who is very respectable. He wore an extremely old and well brushed round hat, a threadbare frock-coat of a coarse cloth of yellow ochre, a colour not at all out of the ordinary at that time, a generous waistcoat with pockets cut in the old-fashioned style, black breeches faded grey at the knees, stockings of black worsted and sturdy shoes with copper buckles. He looked like a former tutor to a good family, an émigré who had now returned. From his completely white hair, his wrinkled brow, his pale lips, from his whole face that denoted dejection and weariness of life, you would have assumed he was well over sixty. From his firm albeit slow step, from the remarkable vigour that stamped his every movement, you would have reckoned he was scarcely fifty. The wrinkles on his brow inspired confidence and would have predisposed in his favour anyone who observed him closely. His lips were contracted in a strange twist of what looked like severity but was actually humility. There was in the depth of his gaze some indefinably melancholic serenity. In his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief. With his right hand he leaned on some sort of staff cut from a hedgerow. This staff had been trimmed with a degree of care, and did not look too rough. The best had been made of the knots in it, and a coral-like knob had been fashioned out of red wax: it was a cudgel and it looked like a cane.","This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of what may be called the well-bred mendicant,—extreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He wore a very old and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectly threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration. He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age, from his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and his countenance, where everything breathed depression and weariness of life. Judging from his firm tread, from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements, he would have hardly been thought fifty. The wrinkles on his brow were well placed, and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively. His lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe, and which was humble. There was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity. In his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick had been carefully trimmed, and had an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made of its knots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from red wax: it was a cudgel, and it seemed to be a cane.","This man, in his dress as in his whole person, realised the type of what might be called the mendicant of good society—extreme misery being combined with extreme neatness. It is a rare coincidence which inspires intelligent hearts with this double respect that we feel for him who is very poor and for him who is very worthy. He wore a round hat, very old and carefully brushed, a long coat, completely threadbare, of coarse yellow cloth, a colour which was in nowise extraordinary at that epoch, a large waistcoat with pockets of antique style, black trousers worn grey at the knees, black woollen stockings, and thick shoes with copper buckles. One would have called him an old preceptor of a good family, returned from the emigration. From his hair, which was entirely white, from his wrinkled brow, from his livid lips, from his face in which everything breathed exhaustion and weariness of life, one would have supposed him considerably over sixty. From his firm though slow step, and the singular vigour impressed upon all his motions, one would hardly have thought him fifty. The wrinkles on his forehead were well disposed, and would have prepossessed in his favour any one who observed him with attention. His lip contracted with a strange expression, which seemed severe and yet which was humble. There was in the depths of his eye an indescribably mournful serenity. He carried in his left hand a small package tied in a handkerchief, with his right he leaned upon a sort of staff cut from a hedge. This staff had been finished with some care, and did not look very badly; the knots were smoothed down, and a coral head had been formed with red wax; it was a cudgel, and it seemed a cane."

Comme nous faisons un portrait et que nous ne voulons rien cacher, nous sommes forcé d’ajouter qu’il fut glacial pour Napoléon déclinant.

"Il faut se souvenir qu’à cette époque la police n’était pas précisément à son aise ; la presse libre la gênait. Quelques arrestations arbitraires, dénoncées par les journaux, avaient retenti jusqu’aux chambres, et rendu la préfecture timide. Attenter à la liberté individuelle était un fait grave. Les agents craignaient de se tromper ; le préfet s’en prenait à eux ; une erreur, c’était la destitution.

Imagine the effect that this brief paragraph reproduced by twenty newspapers would have had in Paris: ""Yesterday, an old grandfather with white hair, a respectable annuitant, who was walking with his eight-year-old granddaughter , was arrested and taken to the Prefecture Depot as an escaped convict! —","It must be remembered that at that time things were not exactly comfortable for the police. The free press was making things difficult for them. Several arbitrary arrests, denounced by the newspapers, had caused a stir even in parliament and had made the police authorities apprehensive.

"Il entendit un jour conter dans un salon un procès criminel qu’on instruisait et qu’on allait juger. Un misérable homme, par amour pour une femme et pour l’enfant qu’il avait d’elle, à bout de ressources, avait fait de la fausse monnaie. La fausse monnaie était encore punie de mort à cette époque. La femme avait été arrêtée émettant la première pièce fausse fabriquée par l’homme. On la tenait, mais on n’avait de preuves que contre elle. Elle seule pouvait charger son amant et le perdre en avouant. Elle nia. On insista. Elle s’obstina à nier. Sur ce, le procureur du roi avait eu une idée. Il avait supposé une infidélité de l’amant, et était parvenu, avec des fragments de lettres savamment présentés, à persuader à la malheureuse qu’elle avait une rivale et que cet homme la trompait. Alors, exaspérée de jalousie, elle avait dénoncé son amant, tout avoué, tout prouvé. L’homme était perdu. Il allait être prochainement jugé à Aix avec sa complice. On racontait le fait, et chacun s’extasiait sur l’habileté du magistrat. En mettant la jalousie en jeu, il avait fait jaillir la vérité par la colère, il avait fait sortir la justice de la vengeance. L’évêque écoutait cela en silence. Quand ce fut fini, il demanda :","One day he heard in a salon a criminal trial which was being investigated and was about to be judged. A wretched man, out of love for a woman and for the child he had by her, at the end of his resources, had made counterfeit money. Counterfeit money was still punishable by death at that time. The woman had been arrested issuing the first man-made counterfeit coin. We had her, but we only had evidence against her. Only she could charge her lover and ruin him by confessing. She denied. We insisted. She stubbornly denied. With that, the king's prosecutor had had an idea. He had assumed the lover's infidelity, and had succeeded, with skilfully presented fragments of letters, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that this man was deceiving her. Then, exasperated with jealousy, she had denounced her lover, confessed everything, proved everything. The man was lost. He was soon to be tried in Aix with his accomplice. The story was told, and everyone was in ecstasies over the skill of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy into play, he had brought truth out of anger, he had brought justice out of vengeance. The bishop listened to this in silence. When it was over, he asked:","One day he heard in a salon the story of a criminal case that was going to come to trial. Some poor wretch in desperate straits, out of love for a woman and the child she had borne him, had coined counterfeit money. At that time counterfeiting was still punishable by death. The woman had been caught passing off the first fake coin made by the man. She was detained, but there was evidence only against her. She alone could incriminate her lover and ruin him by confessing. She denied the accusation. She was pressed. She persisted in her denial. At this point the crown prosecutor had an idea. He alleged an infidelity on the part of the lover and by means of cunningly presented fragments of letters succeeded in persuading the poor woman she had a rival and that this man was deceiving her. Provoked by jealousy she denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all. It was the man’s undoing. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice. It was this that was being talked of, and everyone was marvelling at the magistrate’s ingenuity. By bringing jealousy into play he had used anger to elicit the truth. He had brought about the justice of revenge. The bishop listened to all of this in silence. When the discussion came to a close he asked, ‘Where are this man and woman to face judgement?’","One day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the point of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for a woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was held, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone could accuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they insisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all. The man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy into play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had educed the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this in silence. When they had finished, he inquired,—","In company one day he heard an account of a criminal case that was about to be tried. A miserable man, through love for a woman and for the child she had borne him, had been making false coin, his means being exhausted. At that time counterfeiting was still punished with death.

She alone could testify against him, and convict him by her confession. She denied his guilt. They insisted, but she was obstinate in her denial. In this state of the case, the procureur du roi devised a shrewd plan. He represented to her that her lover was unfaithful, and by means of fragments of letters skilfully put together, succeeded in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that this man had deceived her. At once exasperated by jealousy, she denounced her lover, confessed all, and proved his guilt. He was to be tried in a few days, at Aix, with his accomplice, and his conviction was certain. The story was told, and everybody was in ecstasy at the adroitness of the officer. In bringing jealousy into play he had brought truth to light by means of anger, and justice had sprung from revenge. The bishop listened to all this in silence. When it was finished he asked:"

"Peu à peu, et avec le temps, toutes les oppositions étaient tombées. Il y avait eu d’abord contre M.

On venait de dix lieues à la ronde consulter M. Madeleine. Il terminait les différends, il empêchait les procès, il réconciliait les ennemis. Chacun le prenait pour juge de son bon droit.

People had come from ten leagues around to consult M. Madeleine. He settled disputes, he prevented lawsuits, he reconciled enemies. Everyone took him for judge of his right.

"« Mes très chers frères, mes bons amis, il y a en France treize cent vingt mille maisons de paysans qui n’ont que trois ouvertures, dix-huit cent dix-sept mille qui ont deux ouvertures, la porte et une fenêtre, et enfin trois cent quarante-six mille cabanes qui n’ont qu’une ouverture, la porte. Et cela, à cause d’une chose qu’on appelle l’impôt des portes et fenêtres. Mettez-moi de pauvres familles, des vieilles femmes, des petits enfants, dans ces logis-là, et voyez les fièvres et les maladies ! Hélas ! Dieu donne l’air aux hommes, la loi le leur vend.

"Au mot de Cambronne, la voix anglaise répondit : feu ! les batteries flamboyèrent, la colline trembla, de toutes ces bouches d’airain sortit un dernier vomissement de mitraille, épouvantable ; une vaste fumée, vaguement blanchie du lever de la lune, roula, et quand la fumée se dissipa, il n’y avait plus rien.

This formidable remnant was annihilated, the guard was dead. The four walls of the living redoubt were lying there, barely distinguishing here and there a trembling among the corpses; and it is thus that the French legions, larger than the Roman legions, expired at Mont-Saint-Jean on the earth wet with rain and blood, in the dark wheat, at the place where now passes at four o'clock in the morning. morning, whistling and gaily whipping his horse, Joseph, who does the service of the Nivelles mail coach.","At that word from Cambronne, the English voice responded, ‘Fire!’ The batteries blazed, the hill trembled, from every cannon issued a last dreadful belch of grapeshot; the immense smoke billowed, a dim whiteness under the moonrise, and when the smoke cleared, there was nothing left.

That formidable remnant was annihilated; the guard was dead.

"Voilà bien des années déjà que l’auteur de ce livre, forcé, à regret, de parler de lui, est absent de Paris. Depuis qu’il l’a quitté, Paris s’est transformé. Une ville nouvelle a surgi qui lui est en quelque sorte inconnue. Il n’a pas besoin de dire qu’il aime Paris ; Paris est la ville natale de son esprit. Par suite des démolitions et des reconstructions, le Paris de sa jeunesse, ce Paris qu’il a religieusement emporté dans sa mémoire, est à cette heure un Paris d’autrefois. Qu’on lui permette de parler de ce Paris-là comme s’il existait encore. Il est possible que là où l’auteur va conduire les lecteurs en disant : « Dans telle rue il y a telle maison », il n’y ait plus aujourd’hui ni maison ni rue. Les lecteurs vérifieront, s’ils veulent en prendre la peine. Quant à lui, il ignore le Paris nouveau, et il écrit avec le Paris ancien devant les yeux dans une illusion qui lui est précieuse. C’est une douceur pour lui de rêver qu’il reste derrière lui quelque chose de ce qu’il voyait quand il était dans son pays, et que tout ne s’est pas évanoui. Tant qu’on va et vient dans le pays natal, on s’imagine que ces rues vous sont indifférentes, que ces fenêtres, ces toits et ces portes ne vous sont de rien, que ces murs vous sont étrangers, que ces arbres sont les premiers arbres venus, que ces maisons où l’on n’entre pas vous sont inutiles, que ces pavés où l’on marche sont des pierres. Plus tard, quand on n’y est plus, on s’aperçoit que ces rues vous sont chères, que ces toits, ces fenêtres et ces portes vous manquent, que ces murailles vous sont nécessaires, que ces arbres sont vos bien-aimés, que ces maisons où l’on n’entrait pas on y entrait tous les jours, et qu’on a laissé de ses entrailles, de son sang et de son cœur dans ces pavés. Tous ces lieux qu’on ne voit plus, qu’on ne reverra jamais peut-être, et dont on a gardé l’image, prennent un charme douloureux, vous reviennent avec la mélancolie d’une apparition, vous font la terre sainte visible, et sont, pour ainsi dire, la forme même de la France ; et on les aime et on les évoque tels qu’ils sont, tels qu’ils étaient, et l’on s’y obstine, et l’on n’y veut rien changer, car on tient à la figure de la patrie comme au visage de sa mère.","For many years now, the author of this book, forced, with regret, to talk about him, has been absent from Paris. Since he left, Paris has changed. A new city has arisen that is somehow unknown to him. He doesn't need to say he loves Paris; Paris is the birthplace of his spirit. As a result of demolitions and reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, this Paris which he religiously carried away in his memory, is at this hour a Paris of yesteryear. Let him be allowed to talk about that Paris as if it still existed. It is possible that where the author is going to lead the readers by saying: ""In such a street there is such a house"", there is no longer today either house or street. Readers will check it out, if they want to bother. As for him, he ignores the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion that is precious to him. It is a sweetness for him to dream that there remains behind him something of what he saw when he was in his country, and that all has not vanished. As long as you come and go in your native country, you imagine that these streets are indifferent to you, that these windows, these roofs and these doors are nothing to you, that these walls are foreign to you, that these trees are the first trees come, that these houses where one does not enter are useless to you, that these pavements on which one walks are stones. Later, when you are no longer there, you realize that these streets are dear to you, that you miss these roofs, these windows and these doors, that these walls are necessary to you, that these trees are your beloved ones, that these houses where one did not enter one entered there every day, and that one left of his entrails, of his blood and of his heart in these cobblestones. All these places that we no longer see, that we may never see again, and of which we have kept the image, take on a painful charm, come back to you with the melancholy of an apparition, make the holy land visible to you. , and are, so to speak, the very form of France; and we love them and we evoke them as they are, as they were, and we persist in it, and we do not want to change anything, because we hold on to the figure of the fatherland as in his mother's face.","Reluctantly obliged to speak of himself, the author of this book has not been in Paris for many years now. Since he left it, Paris has been transformed. A new city has grown up that is, as it were, unknown to him. Needless to say, he loves Paris. Paris is his spiritual home. As a result of demolitions and rebuildings the Paris of his youth, the Paris he religiously took away with him in his memory, is now a Paris of the past. Let him speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It is possible that where the author is going to take his readers, telling them, ‘In this street stands this house’, neither the street nor the house is there any more. Readers can check, if they care to take the trouble. For his own part, the author is not familiar with the new Paris and he writes with the old Paris before his eyes, treasuring that illusion. It is a comfort to him to fancy that something still remains of what he used to see when he was in his native city, and that not everything has vanished. While you come and go in the place where you were born, you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you, those windows, roofs, doors mean nothing to you, those walls are strangers to you, those trees are just any old trees, those houses you never enter are of no good to you, those cobbles you walk on are but stones. Later, when you are no longer there, you realize that you cherish those streets, you miss those roofs, windows, doors, you need those walls; that those trees are favourites of yours, those houses never entered you entered every day, and that you have left behind on those cobbles something of your blood and your guts and your heart. All those places you do not see any more, that you may never see again and that you have kept a picture of in your mind, take on a melancholy charm; they come back to you with the mournfulness of an apparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak, the very embodiment of France. And you love them and you conjure them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this, and you will make no change to them: for the face of your homeland is as dear to you as the face of your mother.","The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself, has been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been transformed since he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after a fashion, unknown to him. There is no need for him to say that he loves Paris: Paris is his mind’s natal city. In consequence of demolitions and reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore away religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. He must be permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says, “In such a street there stands such and such a house,” neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality. Readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble. For his own part, he is unacquainted with the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him. It is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country, and that all has not vanished. So long as you go and come in your native land, you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you; that those windows, those roofs, and those doors are nothing to you; that those walls are strangers to you; that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard; that those houses, which you do not enter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you tread are merely stones. Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceive that the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those doors; and that those walls are necessary to you, those trees are well beloved by you; that you entered those houses which you never entered, every day, and that you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements. All those places which you no longer behold, which you may never behold again, perchance, and whose memory you have cherished, take on a melancholy charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak, the very form of France, and you love them; and you call them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this, and you will submit to no change: for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother.","Many years have already passed away since the author of this book, who is compelled, reluctantly, to speak of himself, was in Paris. Since then, Paris has been transformed. A new city has arisen, which to him is in some sense unknown. He need not say that he loves Paris; Paris is the native city of his heart. Through demolition and reconstruction, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he religiously treasures in his memory, has become a Paris of former times. Let him be permitted to speak of that Paris as if it still existed. It is possible that where the author is about to conduct his readers, saying: “In such a street there is such a house,” there is now no longer either house or street. The reader will verify it, if he chooses to take the trouble. As to himself, the author knows not the new Paris, and writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him. It is a sweet thing for him to imagine that there still remains something of what he saw when he was in his own country, and that all is not vanished. While we are living in our native land, we fancy that these streets are indifferent to us, that these windows, these roofs, and these doors are nothing to us, that these walls are strangers to us, that these trees are no more than other trees, that these houses which we never enter are useless to us, that this pavement on which we walk is nothing but stone. In after times, when we are there no longer, we find that those streets are very dear, that we miss those roofs, those windows, and those doors, that those walls are necessary to us, that those trees are our well-beloved, that those houses which we never entered we entered every day, and that we have left something of our affections, our life, and our heart in those streets. All those places which we see no more, which perhaps we shall never see again, but the image of which we have preserved, assume a mournful charm, return to us with the sadness of a spectre, make the holy land visible to us, and are, so to speak, the very form of France; and we love them and call them up such as they are, such as they were, and hold to them, unwilling to change anything, for one clings to the form of his fatherland as to the face of his mother."

"Il entra dans une petite rue où il y a beaucoup de jardins. Quelques-uns ne sont enclos que de haies, ce qui égaye la rue. Parmi ces jardins et ces haies, il vit une petite maison d’un seul étage dont la fenêtre était éclairée. Il regarda par cette vitre comme il avait fait pour le cabaret. C’était une grande chambre blanchie à la chaux, avec un lit drapé d’indienne imprimée et un berceau dans un coin, quelques chaises de bois et un fusil à deux coups accroché au mur. Une table était servie au milieu de la chambre. Une lampe de cuivre éclairait la nappe de grosse toile blanche, le broc d’étain luisant comme l’argent et plein de vin et la soupière brune qui fumait. A cette table était assis un homme d’une quarantaine d’années, à la figure joyeuse et ouverte, qui faisait sauter un petit enfant sur ses genoux. Près de lui, une femme toute jeune allaitait un autre enfant. Le père riait, l’enfant riait, la mère souriait.","He entered a small street where there are many gardens. Some are enclosed only by hedges, which brighten up the street. Among these gardens and hedges he saw a small one-story house with a lighted window. He looked through this window as he had done for the cabaret. It was a large whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed calico and a cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barreled gun hanging on the wall. A table was served in the middle of the room. A copper lamp lit up the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter jug shining like silver and full of wine, and the brown soup tureen which was smoking. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a cheerful and open face, who was bouncing a small child on his lap. Near him, a very young woman was breastfeeding another child. The father laughed, the child laughed, the mother smiled.","He came into a little street where there are many gardens. Some have only hedges around them, which makes the street more attractive.

"― Avec ça, voyez-vous, monsieur l’inspecteur, il faut être juste. Je comprends que vous êtes juste, monsieur l’inspecteur. Au fait, c’est tout simple, un homme qui joue à mettre un peu de neige dans le dos d’une femme, ça les faisait rire, les officiers, il faut bien qu’on se divertisse à quelque chose, nous autres nous sommes là pour qu’on s’amuse, quoi ! Et puis, vous, vous venez, vous êtes bien forcé de mettre l’ordre, vous emmenez la femme qui a tort, mais en y réfléchissant, comme vous êtes bon, vous dites qu’on me mette en liberté, c’est pour la petite, parce que six mois en prison, cela m’empêcherait de nourrir mon enfant. Seulement n’y reviens plus, coquine ! Oh ! je n’y reviendrai plus, monsieur Javert ! on me fera tout ce qu’on voudra maintenant, je ne bougerai plus. Seulement, aujourd’hui, voyez-vous, j’ai crié parce que cela m’a fait mal, je ne m’attendais pas du tout à cette neige de ce monsieur, et puis, je vous ai dit, je ne me porte pas très bien, je tousse, j’ai là dans l’estomac comme une boule qui me brûle, que le médecin me dit : soignez-vous. Tenez, tâtez, donnez votre main, n’ayez pas peur, c’est ici.","“With that, you see, Inspector, you have to be fair. I understand that you are fair, Inspector. In fact, it's quite simple, a man who plays at putting a little snow on a woman's back, that made them laugh, the officers, we have to have fun with something, the rest of us we're here to have fun! And then, you, you come, you are really forced to put the order, you take away the woman who is wrong, but thinking about it, how good you are, you say that they set me free, it's for the little one, because six months in prison would prevent me from feeding my child. Just don't come back to it, naughty! Oh ! I will not come back to it again, Monsieur Javert! They'll do whatever they want to me now, I won't move. Only, today, you see, I cried out because it hurt me, I didn't expect this snow at all from this gentleman, and then, I told you, I'm not I'm not very well, I cough, I have a lump in my stomach that burns me, which the doctor says to me: take care of yourself. Hold, feel, give your hand, don't be afraid, it's here.","‘You see, at the same time, monsieur l’inspecteur, you have to be fair. I realize that you are fair, monsieur l’inspecteur. Indeed, it’s quite simple: a man putting snow down a woman’s back for fun, that made the officers laugh, they have to amuse themselves somehow, and that’s what women like me are here for, of course! And then you come along , you’ve no choice but to restore order, you take away the woman who’s to blame, but on reflection, seeing as you’re kind-hearted , you say I’m to be set free. It’s for the sake of the little one, because, spending six months in prison, that would mean I couldn’t support my child. Only, don’t do it again, you hussy! Oh! I won’t do it again, Monsieur Javert!

But you see, today I yelled because it hurt, I wasn’t at all expecting that snow from the gentleman, and besides, as I told you, I’m not well, I cough, I have what feels like a lump in my stomach, which hurts, and the doctor tells me, “Take care of yourself.” Here, feel, give me your hand, don’t be afraid, it’s here.’","“And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. I understand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectly simple: a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman’s back, and that makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way; and we—well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course! And then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order, you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for the sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child. ‘Only, don’t do it again, you hussy!’ Oh! I won’t do it again, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me now; I will not stir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me. I was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as I told you, I am not well ; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach, and the doctor tells me, ‘Take care of yourself.’ Here, feel, give me your hand; don’t be afraid—it is here.”","“Now, you see, Monsieur Inspector, you must be just.

"C’est toujours la même histoire. Ces pauvres êtres vivants, ces créatures de Dieu, sans appui désormais, sans guide, sans asile, s’en allèrent au hasard, qui sait même ? chacun de leur côté peut-être, et s’enfoncèrent peu à peu dans cette froide brume où s’engloutissent les destinées solitaires, mornes ténèbres où disparaissent successivement tant de têtes infortunées dans la sombre marche du genre humain. Ils quittèrent le pays. Le clocher de ce qui avait été leur village les oublia ; la borne de ce qui avait été leur champ les oublia ; après quelques années de séjour au bagne, Jean Valjean lui-même les oublia. Dans ce cœur où il y avait eu une plaie, il y eut une cicatrice. Voilà tout. A peine, pendant tout le temps qu’il passa à Toulon, entendit-il parler une seule fois de sa sœur. C’était, je crois, vers la fin de la quatrième année de sa captivité. Je ne sais plus par quelle voie ce renseignement lui parvint. Quelqu’un, qui les avait connus au pays, avait vu sa sœur. Elle était à Paris. Elle habitait une pauvre rue près Saint-Sulpice, la rue du Geindre. Elle n’avait plus avec elle qu’un enfant, un petit garçon, le dernier. Où étaient les six autres ? Elle ne le savait peut-être pas elle-même. Tous les matins elle allait à une imprimerie rue du Sabot, no 3, où elle était plieuse et brocheuse. Il fallait être là à six heures du matin, bien avant le jour l’hiver. Dans la maison de l’imprimerie il y avait une école, elle menait à cette école son petit garçon qui avait sept ans. Seulement, comme elle entrait à l’imprimerie à six heures et que l’école n’ouvrait qu’à sept heures, il fallait que l’enfant attendît dans la cour que l’école ouvrît, une heure ; l’hiver une heure de nuit, en plein air. On ne voulait pas que l’enfant entrât dans l’imprimerie, parce qu’il gênait, disait-on. Les ouvriers voyaient le matin en passant ce pauvre petit être assis sur le pavé, tombant de sommeil, et souvent endormi dans l’ombre, accroupi et plié sur son panier. Quand il pleuvait, une vieille femme, la portière en avait pitié ; elle le recueillait dans son bouge où il n’y avait qu’un grabat, un rouet et deux chaises de bois, et le petit dormait là dans un coin, se serrant contre le chat pour avoir moins froid. A sept heures, l’école ouvrait et il y entrait. Voilà ce qu’on dit à Jean Valjean. On l’en entretint un jour, ce fut un moment, un éclair, comme une fenêtre brusquement ouverte sur la destinée de ces êtres qu’il avait aimés, puis tout se referma ; il n’en entendit plus parler et ce fut pour jamais. Plus rien n’arriva d’eux à lui ; jamais il ne les revit, jamais il ne les rencontra, et dans la suite de cette douloureuse histoire on ne les retrouvera plus.","It's always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures of God, henceforth without support, without guide, without asylum, went away haphazardly, who even knows? each one on their side perhaps, and sank little by little into this cold mist where solitary destinies are engulfed, gloomy darkness where so many unfortunate heads disappear successively in the dark march of the human race. They left the country. The steeple of what had been their village forgot them; the boundary of what had been their field forgot them; after a few years in prison, Jean Valjean himself forgot them. In that heart where there had been a wound, there was a scar. That is all. Hardly, during all the time he spent in Toulon, did he hear a single mention of his sister. It was, I believe, towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity. I no longer know how this information reached him. Someone who had known them back home had seen his sister. She was in Paris. She lived in a poor street near Saint-Sulpice, rue du Geindre. She had only one child left with her, a little boy, the last. Where were the other six? Maybe she didn't know it herself. Every morning she went to a printing press, rue du Sabot, No. 3, where she worked as a folder and stapler. You had to be there at six in the morning, long before daylight in winter. In the house of the printing house there was a school, she took to this school her little boy who was seven years old. Only, as she entered the printing office at six o'clock and the school did not open until seven o'clock, the child had to wait in the yard for the school to open, one o'clock; in winter one hour at night, in the open air. We didn't want the child to go into the printing office, because he was in the way, they said. The workmen saw in the morning as they passed this poor little being seated on the pavement, falling from sleep, and often asleep in the shade, squatting and bent over his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress took pity on her; she took him to her den where there was only a pallet, a spinning wheel and two wooden chairs, and the little one slept there in a corner, huddled against the cat to keep the cold down. At seven o'clock the school opened and he entered. This is what they say to Jean Valjean. They talked to him about it one day, it was a moment, a flash, like a window suddenly opened on the destiny of those beings he had loved, then everything closed again; he heard no more of it, and that was for ever. Nothing more happened to him from them; he never saw them again, he never met them, and in the rest of this painful story they will never be found again.","It is always the same story. Those poor mortals, those creatures of God, left with no means of support, no guide, no refuge, wandered off aimlessly – who knows? perhaps went their separate ways – and eventually disappeared in that cold fog where lone destinies founder, those dismal shadows where so many unfortunate individuals come to grief in the doleful progress of mankind. They left the area. The clock-tower of what had been their village forgot them. The boundary of what had been their land forgot them. After a few years in prison Jean Valjean himself forgot them. In that heart where there had been an open wound there was now a scar. That is all. In all the time he spent at Toulon he only once heard any word of his sister. It was, I believe, towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity. How the news reached him, I do not know. Someone who had known them back home had seen his sister. She was in Paris. She lived in a back street near St-Sulpice, Rue du Gindre. She had only one child with her, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six? She herself may not have known. Every morning she went to a printing works at 3 Rue du Sabot where she was a sheet-folder and -stitcher. She had to be there at six in the morning, well before daylight in winter. In the same building as the print shop was a school and to this school she took her little boy, who was seven years old. But as she started at the printer’s at six and the school did not open until seven, the child had to wait an hour in the courtyard for the school to open – an hour out in the open in winter! They would not let the child come into the print shop because he got in the way, they said. Those on their way to work in the morning would see this poor little creature sitting on the pavement, unable to stay awake, and often sleeping in the dark, hunkered down and bent over his lunch-box. When it rained an old woman, the doorkeeper, would take pity on him and let him into her cubicle that contained only a pallet, a spinning-wheel and two wooden chairs, and the little one would sleep there in a corner, hugging the cat for warmth. At seven o’clock the school opened and he would go in. This is what Jean Valjean was told. Someone spoke of it one day: it was momentary, a brief flash, like a window suddenly opened on the fate of his loved ones, then everything closed up again. That was the last he ever heard of them. No further news ever reached him. He never again saw them, or met them. Nor shall we again encounter them throughout the rest of this sad story.","It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures of God, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge, wandered away at random,—who even knows?—each in his own direction perhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race. They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their village forgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them; after a few years’ residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgot them. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar. That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon, did he hear his sister mentioned.

At seven o’clock the school opened, and he entered. That is what was told to Jean Valjean. They talked to him about it for one day; it was a moment, a flash, as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing more forever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheld them; he never met them again; and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more.","It is the old story. These poor little lives, these creatures of God, henceforth without support, or guide, or asylum; they passed away wherever chance led, who knows even? Each took a different path, it may be, and sank little by little into the chilling dark which engulfs solitary destinies; that sullen gloom where are lost so many ill-fated souls in the sombre advance of the human race. They left that region; the church of what had been their village forgot them; the stile of what had been their field forgot them; after a few years in the galleys, even Jean Valjean forgot them. In that heart, in which there had been a wound, there was a scar; that was all. During the time he was at Toulon, he heard but once of his sister; that was, I think, at the end of the fourth year of his confinement. I do not know how the news reached him: some one who had known him at home had seen his sister. She was in Paris, living in a poor street near Saint Sulpice, the Rue du Geindre. She had with her but one child, the youngest, a little boy. Where were the other six? She did not know herself, perhaps. Every morning she went to a bindery, No. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she was employed as a folder and book-stitcher. She had to be there by six in the morning, long before the dawn in the winter. In the same building with the bindery, there was a school, where she sent her little boy, seven years old. As the school did not open until seven, and she must be at her work at six, her boy had to wait in the yard an hour, until the school opened—an hour of cold and darkness in the winter. They would not let the child wait in the bindery, because he was troublesome, they said. The workmen, as they passed in the morning, saw the poor little fellow sometimes sitting on the pavement nodding with weariness, and often sleeping in the dark, crouched and bent over his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress, took pity on him; she let him come into her lodge, the furniture of which was only a pallet bed, a spinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs; and the little one slept there in a corner, hugging the cat to keep himself warm. At seven o’clock the school opened and he went in. That is what was told Jean Valjean. It was as if a window had suddenly been opened looking upon the destiny of those he had loved, and then all was closed again, and he heard nothing more for ever. Nothing more came to him; he had not seen them, never will he see them again! and through the remainder of this sad history we shall not meet them again."

Un conventionnel lui faisait un peu l’effet d’être hors la loi, même hors la loi de charité.","The bishop, on his side, although he usually guarded against curiosity, which, according to him, was contiguous to the offence, could not help examining the conventional with an attention which, not having its source in sympathy, would probably have been reproached to him by his conscience vis-a-vis any other man. A member of the Convention gave him the impression of being outside the law, even outside the law of charity.","Although he generally guarded against curiosity – as he saw it, bordering on sin – the bishop for his part could not help studying the member of the Convention with an attentiveness that, seeing it did not spring from sympathy, his conscience would probably have reproached him for had it been directed at any other man. A member of the Convention struck him as being something of an outlaw, beyond even the laws of charity.","The Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity.","The bishop, on his part, although he generally kept himself free from curiosity, which to his idea was almost offensive, could not avoid examining the conventionist with an attention for which, as it had not its source in sympathy, his conscience would have condemned him as to any other man; but a conventionist he looked upon as an outlaw, even to the law of charity."
"Toutefois, il faut le dire, jamais rien de pareil ne s’était encore présenté. Jamais les deux idées qui gouvernaient le malheureux homme dont nous racontons les souffrances n’avaient engagé une lutte si sérieuse. Il le comprit confusément, mais profondément, dès les premières paroles que prononça Javert, en entrant dans son cabinet. Au moment où fut si étrangement articulé ce nom qu’il avait enseveli sous tant d’épaisseurs, il fut saisi de stupeur et comme enivré par la sinistre bizarrerie de sa destinée, et, à travers cette stupeur, il eut ce tressaillement qui précède les grandes secousses ; il se courba comme un chêne à l’approche d’un orage, comme un soldat à l’approche d’un assaut. Il sentit venir sur sa tête des ombres pleines de foudres et d’éclairs. Tout en écoutant parler Javert, il eut une première pensée d’aller, de courir, de se dénoncer, de tirer ce Champmathieu de prison et de s’y mettre ; cela fut douloureux et poignant comme une incision dans la chair vive, puis cela passa, et il se dit : Voyons ! voyons ! ― Il réprima ce premier mouvement généreux et recula devant l’héroïsme.","However, it must be said, nothing like this had ever happened before. Never had the two ideas which governed the unfortunate man whose sufferings we relate engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood it confusedly, but profoundly, from the first words uttered by Javert on entering his study. At the moment when the name he had buried under so many layers was so strangely articulated, he was seized with stupor and as if intoxicated by the sinister oddity of his destiny, and, through this stupor, he had that thrill which precedes the big jerks; he bowed like an oak at the approach of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He felt shadows come over his head full of thunder and lightning. While listening to Javert speak, he had a first thought of going, of running, of denouncing himself, of dragging this Champmathieu out of prison and putting himself there; it was painful and poignant like an incision in living flesh, then it passed, and he said to himself: Come on! let's see! ―He repressed this first generous movement and recoiled from heroism.","However, it must be said, nothing like this had ever arisen before. Never had the two precepts that governed the unfortunate man whose tribulations we are recounting come into such serious contention. He was vaguely but profoundly aware of this from the very first words that Javert uttered on entering his office. The moment that name which he had buried beneath such deep layers was so strangely mentioned, he was seized with amazement and as though befuddled by the sinister whimsicality of his destiny, and amid his amazement he felt the tremor that precedes great upheavals. He bent like an oak at the approach of a storm, like a soldier at an oncoming assault. He sensed shadows filled with thunder and lightning gathering overhead. As he listened to Javert his first thought was to go running off and denounce himself, to drag that Champmathieu out of prison and take his place. This was as painful and agonizing as an incision in living flesh. Then it passed, and he said to himself, ‘Come, now! Come, now!’ He repressed this first generous instinct and recoiled before heroism.","At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yet presented itself. Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we are narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood this confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert, when the latter entered his study. At the moment when that name, which he had buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely articulated, he was struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks. He bent like an oak at the approach of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head. As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him was to go, to run and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out of prison and place himself there; this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh. Then it passed away, and he said to himself, “We will see! We will see!” He repressed this first, generous instinct, and recoiled before heroism.","But of all these occasions, it must be said, none had ever been anything like that which was now presented. Never had the two ideas that governed the unfortunate man whose sufferings we are relating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He comprehended this confusedly, but thoroughly, from the first words that Javert pronounced on entering his office. At the moment when that name which he had so deeply buried was so strangely uttered, he was seized with stupor, and as if intoxicated by the sinister grotesqueness of his destiny, and through that stupor he felt the shudder which precedes great shocks; he bent like an oak at the approach of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He felt clouds full of thunderings and lightnings gathering upon his head. Even while listening to Javert, his first thought was to go, to run, to denounce himself, to drag this Champmathieu out of prison, and to put himself in his place; it was painful and sharp as an incision into the living flesh, but passed away, and he said to himself: “Let us see! Let us see!” He repressed this first generous impulse and recoiled before such heroism."
"Les élèves, aux austérités près, se conformaient à toutes les pratiques du couvent.

Comme les religieuses, les pensionnaires ne voyaient leurs parents qu’au parloir. Leurs mères elles-mêmes n’obtenaient pas de les embrasser. Voici jusqu’où allait la sévérité sur ce point. Un jour une jeune fille fut visitée par sa mère accompagnée d’une petite sœur de trois ans. La jeune fille pleurait, car elle eût bien voulu embrasser sa sœur. Impossible.

One day a young girl was visited by her mother accompanied by a three-year-old little sister. The young girl wept, for she would have liked to kiss her sister. Impossible. She begged at least that the child be allowed to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it.

Like the nuns, the pupils saw only their relatives in the parlour. Not even their mothers were granted permission to kiss them. This is how strictly that rule was enforced: One day a young girl received a visit from her mother, accompanied by a little sister, aged three. The young girl wept, for she very much wanted to embrace her sister. Impossible. She begged that at least the child might be allowed to put her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it.

One day a young girl received a visit from her mother, who was accompanied by a little sister three years of age. The young girl wept, for she wished greatly to embrace her sister. Impossible. She begged that, at least, the child might be permitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it.

"« ― Un ancien forçat libéré, nommé Jean Valjean, vient de comparaître devant la cour d’assises du Var dans des circonstances faites pour appeler l’attention. Ce scélérat était parvenu à tromper la vigilance de la police ; il avait changé de nom et avait réussi à se faire nommer maire d’une de nos petites villes du nord. Il avait établi dans cette ville un commerce assez considérable. Il a été enfin démasqué et arrêté, grâce au zèle infatigable du ministère public. Il avait pour concubine une fille publique qui est morte de saisissement au moment de son arrestation. Ce misérable, qui est doué d’une force herculéenne, avait trouvé moyen de s’évader ; mais, trois ou quatre jours après son évasion, la police mit de nouveau la main sur lui, à Paris même, au moment où il montait dans une de ces petites voitures qui font le trajet de la capitale au village de Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). On dit qu’il avait profité de l’intervalle de ces trois ou quatre jours de liberté pour retirer une somme considérable placée par lui chez un de nos principaux banquiers. On évalue cette somme à six ou sept cent mille francs. A en croire l’acte d’accusation, il l’aurait enfouie en un lieu connu de lui seul et l’on n’a pas pu la saisir. Quoi qu’il en soit, le nommé Jean Valjean vient d’être traduit aux assises du département du Var comme accusé d’un vol de grand chemin commis à main armée, il y a huit ans environ, sur la personne d’un de ces honnêtes enfants qui, comme l’a dit le patriarche de Ferney en vers immortels,","“―A former freed convict, named Jean Valjean, has just appeared before the Var Assize Court in circumstances made to draw attention. This scoundrel had managed to deceive the vigilance of the police; he had changed his name and had succeeded in getting himself made mayor of one of our small northern towns. He had established a fairly considerable trade in this city. He was finally unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor. His concubine was a public girl who died of shock at the time of his arrest. This wretch, who is endowed with Herculean strength, had found a way to escape; but, three or four days after his escape, the police seized him again, in Paris itself, just as he was getting into one of those little cars which travel from the capital to the village of Montfermeil (Seine-et -Oise). It is said that he had taken advantage of the interval of these three or four days of freedom to withdraw a considerable sum placed by him with one of our principal bankers. This sum is estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. According to the indictment, he would have buried it in a place known only to him and it could not be seized. Be that as it may, the man named Jean Valjean has just been brought before the assizes of the department of Var as accused of a highway robbery committed at gunpoint, about eight years ago, on the person of one of those honest children who, as the Patriarch of Ferney said in immortal verse,","A freed convict named Jean Valjean has just appeared before the Var court of assizes in circumstances bound to attract attention.

"Deux troupes ennemies sur un champ de bataille sont deux lutteurs. C’est un bras-le-corps. L’une cherche à faire glisser l’autre. On se cramponne à tout ; un buisson est un point d’appui ; un angle de mur est un épaulement ; faute d’une bicoque où s’adosser, un régiment lâche pied ; un ravalement de la plaine, un mouvement de terrain, un sentier transversal à propos, un bois, un ravin, peuvent arrêter le talon de ce colosse qu’on appelle une armée et l’empêcher de reculer. Qui sort du champ est battu. De là, pour le chef responsable, la nécessité d’examiner la moindre touffe d’arbres et d’approfondir le moindre relief.","Two enemy troops on a battlefield are two wrestlers. It's an arm-the-body. One tries to drag the other down.

"― Voilà ce que c’est, monsieur le maire. Il paraît qu’il y avait dans le pays, du côté d’Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher, une espèce de bonhomme qu’on appelait le père Champmathieu. C’était très misérable. On n’y faisait pas attention. Ces gens-là, on ne sait pas de quoi cela vit. Dernièrement, cet automne, le père Champmathieu a été arrêté pour un vol de pommes à cidre, commis chez... — enfin n’importe ! Il y a eu vol, mur escaladé, branches de l’arbre cassées. On a arrêté mon Champmathieu. Il avait encore la branche de pommier à la main. On coffre le drôle. Jusqu’ici ce n’est pas beaucoup plus qu’une affaire correctionnelle. Mais voici qui est de la providence. La geôle étant en mauvais état, monsieur le juge d’instruction trouve à propos de faire transférer Champmathieu à Arras où est la prison départementale. Dans cette prison d’Arras, il y a un ancien forçat nommé Brevet qui est détenu pour je ne sais quoi et qu’on a fait guichetier de chambrée parce qu’il se conduit bien. Monsieur le maire, Champmathieu n’est pas plus tôt débarqué que voilà Brevet qui s’écrie : Eh, mais ! je connais cet homme-là. C’est un fagot*. Regardez-moi donc, bonhomme ! Vous êtes Jean Valjean ! ― Jean Valjean ! qui ça Jean Valjean ? Le Champmathieu joue l’étonné. ― Ne fais donc pas le sinvre, dit Brevet. Tu es Jean Valjean ! Tu as été au bagne de Toulon. Il y a vingt ans. Nous y étions ensemble. ― Le Champmathieu nie. Parbleu ! vous comprenez. On approfondit. On me fouille cette aventure-là. Voici ce qu’on trouve. Ce Champmathieu, il y a une trentaine d’années, a été ouvrier émondeur d’arbres dans plusieurs pays, notamment à Faverolles. Là on perd sa trace. Longtemps après, on le revoit en Auvergne ; puis à Paris, où il dit avoir été charron et avoir eu une fille blanchisseuse, mais cela n’est pas prouvé ; enfin dans ce pays-ci. Or, avant d’aller au bagne pour vol qualifié, qu’était Jean Valjean ? émondeur. Où ? à Faverolles. Autre fait. Ce Valjean s’appelait de son nom de baptême Jean et sa mère se nommait de son nom de famille Mathieu. Quoi de plus naturel que de penser qu’en sortant du bagne il aura pris le nom de sa mère pour se cacher et se sera fait appeler Jean Mathieu ? Il va en Auvergne. De Jean la prononciation du pays fait Chan, on l’appelle Chan Mathieu. Notre homme se laisse faire et le voilà transformé en Champmathieu. Vous me suivez, n’est-ce pas ? On s’informe à Faverolles. La famille de Jean Valjean n’y est plus. On ne sait plus où elle est. Vous savez, dans ces classes-là, il y a souvent de ces évanouissements d’une famille. On cherche, on ne trouve plus rien. Ces gens-là, quand ce n’est pas de la boue, c’est de la poussière. Et puis, comme le commencement de ces histoires date de trente ans, il n’y a plus personne à Faverolles qui ait connu Jean Valjean. On s’informe à Toulon. Avec Brevet, il n’y a plus que deux forçats qui aient vu Jean Valjean. Ce sont les condamnés à vie Cochepaille et Chenildieu. On les extrait du bagne et on les fait venir. On les confronte au prétendu Champmathieu. Ils n’hésitent pas. Pour eux comme pour Brevet, c’est Jean Valjean. Même âge, il a cinquante-quatre ans, même taille, même air, même homme enfin, c’est lui. C’est en ce moment-là que j’envoyais ma dénonciation à la préfecture de Paris. On me répond que je perds l’esprit et que Jean Valjean est à Arras au pouvoir de la justice. Vous concevez si cela m’étonne, moi qui croyais tenir ici ce même Jean Valjean ! J’écris à monsieur le juge d’instruction. Il me fait venir, on m’amène le Champmathieu...","""That's what it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in the country, on the side of Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher, a kind of fellow called Father Champmathieu. It was very miserable. We didn't pay attention to it. These people, we don't know what they live on. Recently, this fall, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of cider apples, committed at... — well, it doesn't matter! There was theft, wall climbed, branches of the tree broken. They arrested my Champmathieu. He still had the apple branch in his hand. We hide the funny. So far it's not much more than a misdemeanor case. But here is what is providence. The jail being in poor condition, the examining magistrate finds it appropriate to have Champmathieu transferred to Arras where the departmental prison is. In this prison of Arras, there is a former convict named Brevet who is detained for I don't know what and who has been made a room clerk because he behaves well. Mayor, Champmathieu is no sooner disembarked than Brevet exclaims: Hey, but! I know that man. It's a bundle*. Look at me, man! You are Jean Valjean! - Jean Valjean ! who is Jean Valjean? The Champmathieu plays the surprised. ""Don't do anything wrong,"" said Brevet. You are Jean Valjean! You were in the prison of Toulon. Twenty years ago. We were there together. ―The Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! you understand. We go deeper. This adventure is being searched for me. Here is what we find. This Champmathieu, thirty years ago, worked as a tree pruner in several countries, notably in Faverolles. There we lose track. Long after, we see him again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he says he was a wheelwright and had a laundress daughter, but this is not proven; finally in this country. However, before going to prison for robbery, who was Jean Valjean? pruner. Where ? in Faverolles. Another fact. This Valjean was called by his Christian name Jean and his mother was called by her surname Mathieu. What could be more natural than to think that on leaving prison he will have taken his mother's name to hide himself and will have called himself Jean Mathieu? He is going to Auvergne. From Jean the pronunciation of the country makes Chan, we call him Chan Mathieu. Our man lets himself be done and he is transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, don't you? We get information in Faverolles. Jean Valjean's family is no longer there. We don't know where she is anymore. You know, in these classes, there are often these fainting of a family. We search, we find nothing. These people, when it's not mud, it's dust. And then, as the beginning of these stories dates back thirty years, there is no longer anyone in Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean. We get information in Toulon. With Brevet, only two convicts have seen Jean Valjean. They are the life-sentenced Cochepaille and Chenildieu. We take them out of the penal colony and make them come. They are confronted with the alleged Champmathieu. They don't hesitate. For them as for Brevet, it is Jean Valjean. Same age, he's fifty-four, same height, same look, same man, it's him. It was at this time that I sent my denunciation to the prefecture of Paris. I am told that I am losing my mind and that Jean Valjean is in Arras in the power of justice. You can imagine if that surprises me, I who thought I had this same Jean Valjean here! I am writing to the examining magistrate. He makes me come, they bring me the Champmathieu...","‘It’s like this, monsieur le maire. It seems there was in these parts, over towards Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher, some old fellow who went by the name of Père Champmathieu. A pitiful wretch. No one took any notice of him. People like that – who knows how they keep themselves alive. Recently, last autumn, Père Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples from – well, never mind that! There was a theft, a wall scaled, branches of a tree broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He still had the apple branch in his hand. The rascal gets put inside. So far, what we’re dealing with is not much more than a minor offence. But now providence intervenes. The gaol being in a poor state of repair, the examining magistrate considers it appropriate to have Champmathieu transferred to Arras, where the département’s central prison is. In this prison at Arras there’s an ex-convict named Brevet, why he’s being held there I don’t know, and because of his good behaviour he has been put in charge of the dormitory. Monsieur le maire, Champmathieu no sooner turns up than Brevet exclaims, “Hey! I know that man! He’s a fagot *! Look at me, man! You’re Jean Valjean!” “Jean Valjean? Who’s Jean Valjean?” Champmathieu pretends to be surprised. “Don’t play the sinvre†,” says Brevet. “You’re Jean Valjean! You were in the prison hulks at Toulon. Twenty years ago it was. We were there together.” ‘Champmathieu denies it. Of course he does! Further inquiries are made. The case is thoroughly investigated. These are the findings: some thirty years ago this Champmathieu was a tree-pruner in various localities, Faverolles among others. Then all trace of him is lost. A long time afterwards he’s seen again in the Auvergne, then in Paris where he is said to have been a cartwright and to have had a daughter who was a laundress. But there’s no proof of that. Now, before serving time with the chain gang for aggravated theft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. Another fact. This Valjean’s Christian name was Jean and his mother’s maiden name was Mathieu. What could be more reasonable than to imagine that when he left prison he took his mother’s name in order to conceal his identity and called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes to the Auvergne. The local pronunciation turns “Jean” into “Chan”, he’s called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no objection and there he is, transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, don’t you? Inquiries are made at Faverolles. Jean Valjean’s family’s no longer there. It’s not known where they’ve gone. You know, in that class of society, families are often disappearing like that. Look for them, and you find there’s nothing left of them. People like that, if they’re not dirt, they’re dust. And then, seeing as it’s thirty years since this whole story began there ’s no one at Faverolles any more who knew Jean Valjean. Inquiries are made at Toulon. Apart from Brevet, there are only two convicts remaining who’ve seen Jean Valjean. They’re Cochepaille and Chenildieu, serving life sentences. They’re hauled out of the prison hulks and brought to Arras. They’re brought face to face with the so-called Champmathieu. They don’t hesitate. For them, just as for Brevet, he’s Jean Valjean. The same age – he’s fifty-four – same height, same manner, in short the same man, it’s him. It was precisely at this point that I sent my denunciation to Paris police headquarters. I’m told I’m out of my mind, that Jean Valjean’s at Arras in the hands of the judiciary. You can imagine my surprise, when there was I thinking I had that same Jean Valjean here. I write to the examining judge. He sends for me, Champmathieu is brought before me—’","“This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in the neighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was called Father Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid any attention to him. No one knows what such people subsist on. Lately, last autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples from— Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wall scaled, branches of trees broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He still had the branch of apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up. Up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor. But here is where Providence intervened. “The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it convenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental prison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named Brevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has been appointed turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: ‘Eh! Why, I know that man! He is a fagot!4 Take a good look at me, my good man! You are Jean Valjean!’ ‘Jean Valjean! who’s Jean Valjean?’ Champmathieu feigns astonishment. ‘Don’t play the innocent dodge,’ says Brevet. ‘You are Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty years ago; we were there together.’ Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You understand. The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated for me. This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, a pruner of trees in various localities, notably at Faverolles. There all trace of him was lost. A long time afterwards he was seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have been a wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was a laundress; but that has not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys for theft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. Another fact. This Valjean’s Christian name was Jean, and his mother’s surname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from the galleys, he should have taken his mother’s name for the purpose of concealing himself, and have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes to Auvergne. The local pronunciation turns Jean into Chan—he is called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and behold him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Inquiries were made at Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is not known where they have gone. You know that among those classes a family often disappears. Search was made, and nothing was found. When such people are not mud, they are dust. And then, as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back, there is no longer any one at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean. Inquiries were made at Toulon. Besides Brevet, there are only two convicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and are sentenced for life. They are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean for them as well as for Brevet. The same age,—he is fifty-four,—the same height, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely at this moment that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris. I was told that I had lost my reason, and that Jean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of the authorities. You can imagine whether this surprised me, when I thought that I had that same Jean Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; he sends for me; Champmathieu is conducted to me—”","“I will tell you how it is, Monsieur Mayor. There was, it appears, in the country, near Ailly-le-Haut Clocher, a simple sort of fellow who was called Father Champmathieu. He was very poor. Nobody paid any attention to him. Such folks live, one hardly knows how. Finally, this last fall, Father Champmathieu was arrested for stealing cider apples from——, but that is of no consequence. There was a theft, a wall scaled, branches of trees broken. Our Champmathieu was arrested; he had even then a branch of an apple-tree in his hand. The rogue was caged. So far, it was nothing more than a penitentiary matter. But here comes in the hand of Providence. The jail being in a bad condition, the police justice thought it best to take him to Arras, where the prison of the department is. In this prison at Arras there was a former convict named Brevet, who is there for some trifle, and who, for his good conduct, has been made turnkey. No sooner was Champmathieu set down, than Brevet cried out: ‘Ha, ha! I know that man. He is a fagot. ’1 “‘Look up here, my good man. You are Jean Valjean.’ ‘Jean Valjean, who is Jean Valjean?’ Champmathieu plays off the astonished. ‘Don’t play ignorance,’ said Brevet. ‘You are Jean Valjean; you were in the galleys at Toulon. It is twenty years ago. We were there together.’ Champmathieu denied it all. Faith! you understand; they fathomed it. The case was worked up and this was what they found. This Champmathieu thirty years ago was a pruner in divers places, particularly in Faverolles. There we lose trace of him. A long time afterwards we find him at Auvergne; then at Paris, where he is said to have been a wheelwright and to have had a daughter—a washerwoman, but that is not proven, and finally in this part of the country. Now before going to the galleys for burglary, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner. Where? At Faverolles. Another fact. This Valjean’s baptismal name was Jean; his mother’s family name, Mathieu. Nothing could be more natural, on leaving the galleys, than to take his mother’s name to disguise himself; then he would be called Jean Mathieu. He goes to Auvergne, the pronunciation of that region would make Chan of Jean—they would call him Chan Mathieu. Our man adopts it, and now you have him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Search has been made at Faverolles; the family of Jean Valjean are no longer there. Nobody knows where they are. You know in such classes these disappearances of families often occur. You search, but can find nothing. Such people, when they are not mud, are dust. And then as the commencement of this story dates back thirty years, there is nobody now at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean. But search has been made at Toulon. Besides Brevet there are only two convicts who have seen Jean Valjean. They are convicts for life; their names are Cochepaille and Chenildieu. These men were brought from the galleys and confronted with the pretended Champmathieu. They did not hesitate. To them as well as to Brevet it was Jean Valjean. Same age; fifty-four years old; same height; same appearance, in fact the same man; it is he. At this time it was that I sent my denunciation to the Prefecture at Paris. They replied that I was out of my mind, and that Jean Valjean was at Arras in the hands of justice. You may imagine how that astonished me; I who believed that I had here the same Jean Valjean. I wrote to the justice; he sent for me and brought Champmathieu before me.”"
"― Je ne veux pas déranger davantage l’audience, reprit Jean Valjean. Je m’en vais, puisqu’on ne m’arrête pas. J’ai plusieurs choses à faire. Monsieur l’avocat général sait qui je suis, il sait où je vais, il me fera arrêter quand il voudra.","""I don't want to disturb the audience any longer,"" resumed Jean Valjean. I'm leaving, since no one stops me. I have several things to do. The Advocate General knows who I am, he knows where I am going, he will have me arrested when he wants.","‘I don’t want to disturb the hearing any further,’ said Jean Valjean. ‘I’m going, since no one’s arresting me. I have several things to do. The public prosecutor knows who I am, he knows where I’m going , he can have me arrested when he pleases.’","“I do not wish to disturb the court further,” resumed Jean Valjean. “I shall withdraw, since you do not arrest me. I have many things to do. The district-attorney knows who I am; he knows whither I am going; he can have me arrested when he likes.”","“I will not disturb the proceeding further,” continued Jean Valjean. “I am going, since I am not arrested. I have many things to do. Monsieur the prosecuting attorney knows where I am going, and will have me arrested when he chooses.”"

Au troisième coup, Fantine se dressa sur son séant, elle qui d’ordinaire pouvait à peine remuer dans son lit ; elle joignit dans une sorte d’étreinte convulsive ses deux mains décharnées et jaunes, et la religieuse entendit sortir de sa poitrine un de ces soupirs profonds qui semblent soulever un accablement.

"A un point de vue plus grave encore, et sur lequel il convient d’insister aussi, cette guerre, qui froissait en France l’esprit militaire, indignait l’esprit démocratique. C’était une entreprise d’asservissement. Dans cette campagne, le but du soldat français, fils de la démocratie, était la conquête d’un joug pour autrui. Contre-sens hideux. La France est faite pour réveiller l’âme des peuples, non pour l’étouffer. Depuis 1792, toutes les révolutions de l’Europe sont la révolution française ; la liberté rayonne de France.

"1817 est l’année que Louis XVIII, avec un certain aplomb royal qui ne manquait pas de fierté, qualifiait la vingt-deuxième de son règne. C’est l’année où M. Bruguière de Sorsum était célèbre. Toutes les boutiques des perruquiers, espérant la poudre et le retour de l’oiseau royal, étaient badigeonnées d’azur et fleurdelysées. C’était le temps candide où le comte Lynch siégeait tous les dimanches comme marguillier au banc d’œuvre de Saint-Germain-des-Prés en habit de pair de France, avec son cordon rouge et son long nez, et cette majesté de profil particulière à un homme qui a fait une action d’éclat. L’action d’éclat commise par M. Lynch était ceci : avoir, étant maire de Bordeaux, le 12 mars 1814, donné la ville un peu trop tôt à M. le duc d’Angoulême. De là sa pairie. En 1817, la mode engloutissait les petits garçons de quatre à six ans sous de vastes casquettes en cuir maroquiné à oreillons assez ressemblantes à des mitres d’esquimaux. L’armée française était vêtue de blanc, à l’autrichienne ; les régiments s’appelaient légions ; au lieu de chiffres ils portaient les noms des départements. Napoléon était à Sainte-Hélène, et, comme l’Angleterre lui refusait du drap vert, il faisait retourner ses vieux habits. En 1817, Pellegrini chantait, mademoiselle Bigottini dansait ; Potier régnait ; Odry n’existait pas encore. Madame Saqui succédait à Forioso. Il y avait encore des prussiens en France. M. Delalot était un personnage. La légitimité venait de s’affirmer en coupant le poing, puis la tête, à Pleignier, à Carbonneau et à Tolleron. Le prince de Talleyrand, grand chambellan, et l’abbé Louis, ministre désigné des finances, se regardaient en riant du rire de deux augures ; tous deux avaient célébré, le 14 juillet 1790, la messe de la Fédération au Champ-de-Mars ; Talleyrand l’avait dite comme évêque, Louis l’avait servie comme diacre. En 1817, dans les contre-allées de ce même Champ-de-Mars, on apercevait de gros cylindres de bois, gisant sous la pluie, pourrissant dans l’herbe, peints en bleu avec des traces d’aigles et d’abeilles dédorées. C’étaient les colonnes qui, deux ans auparavant, avaient soutenu l’estrade de l’empereur au Champ-de-Mai. Elles étaient noircies çà et là de la brûlure du bivouac des autrichiens baraqués près du Gros-Caillou. Deux ou trois de ces colonnes avaient disparu dans les feux de ces bivouacs et avaient chauffé les larges mains des kaiserlicks. Le Champ-de-Mai avait eu cela de remarquable qu’il avait été tenu au mois de juin et au Champ-de-Mars. En cette année 1817, deux choses étaient populaires : le Voltaire-Touquet et la tabatière à la charte. L’émotion parisienne la plus récente était le crime de Dautun qui avait jeté la tête de son frère dans le bassin du Marché-aux-Fleurs. On commençait à faire au ministère de la marine une enquête sur cette fatale frégate de la Méduse qui devait couvrir de honte Chaumareix et de gloire Géricault. Le colonel Selves allait en Égypte pour y devenir Soliman pacha. Le palais des Thermes, rue de la Harpe, servait de boutique à un tonnelier. On voyait encore sur la plate-forme de la tour octogone de l’hôtel de Cluny la petite logette en planches qui avait servi d’observatoire à Messier, astronome de la marine sous Louis XVI. La duchesse de Duras lisait à trois ou quatre amis, dans son boudoir meublé d’X en satin bleu ciel, Ourika inédite. On grattait les N au Louvre. Le pont d’Austerlitz abdiquait et s’intitulait pont du Jardin du Roi, double énigme qui déguisait à la fois le pont d’Austerlitz et le jardin des Plantes. Louis XVIII, préoccupé, tout en annotant du coin de l’ongle Horace, des héros qui se font empereurs et des sabotiers qui se font dauphins, avait deux soucis, Napoléon et Mathurin Bruneau. L’académie française donnait pour sujet de prix : Le bonheur que procure l’étude. M. Bellart était officiellement éloquent. On voyait germer à son ombre ce futur avocat général de Broë, promis aux sarcasmes de Paul-Louis Courier. Il y avait un faux Chateaubriand appelé Marchangy, en attendant qu’il y eût un faux Marchangy appelé d’Arlincourt. Claire d’Albe et Malek-Adel étaient des chefs-d’œuvre ; madame Cottin était déclarée le premier écrivain de l’époque. L’Institut laissait rayer de sa liste l’académicien Napoléon Bonaparte. Une ordonnance royale érigeait Angoulême en école de marine, car, le duc d’Angoulême étant grand amiral, il était évident que la ville d’Angoulême avait de droit toutes les qualités d’un port de mer, sans quoi le principe monarchique eût été entamé. On agitait en conseil des ministres la question de savoir si l’on devait tolérer les vignettes représentant des voltiges qui assaisonnaient les affiches de Franconi et qui attroupaient les polissons des rues. M. Paër, auteur de l’Agnese, bonhomme à la face carrée qui avait une verrue sur la joue, dirigeait les petits concerts intimes de la marquise de Sassenaye, rue de la Ville-l’Évêque. Toutes les jeunes filles chantaient l’Ermite de Saint-Avelle, paroles d’Edmond Géraud. Le Nain jaune se transformait en Miroir. Le café Lemblin tenait pour l’empereur contre le café Valois qui tenait pour les Bourbons. On venait de marier à une princesse de Sicile M. le duc de Berry, déjà regardé du fond de l’ombre par Louvel. Il y avait un an que madame de Staël était morte. Les gardes du corps sifflaient mademoiselle Mars. Les grands journaux étaient tout petits. Le format était restreint, mais la liberté était grande. Le Constitutionnel était constitutionnel. La Minerve appelait Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. Ce t faisait beaucoup rire les bourgeois aux dépens du grand écrivain. Dans des journaux vendus, des journalistes prostitués insultaient les proscrits de 1815 ; David n’avait plus de talent, Arnault n’avait plus d’esprit, Carnot n’avait plus de probité ; Soult n’avait gagné aucune bataille ; il est vrai que Napoléon n’avait plus de génie. Personne n’ignore qu’il est assez rare que les lettres adressées par la poste à un exilé lui parviennent, les polices se faisant un religieux devoir de les intercepter. Le fait n’est point nouveau ; Descartes banni s’en plaignait. Or, David ayant, dans un journal belge, montré quelque humeur de ne pas recevoir les lettres qu’on lui écrivait, ceci paraissait plaisant aux feuilles royalistes qui bafouaient à cette occasion le proscrit. Dire : les régicides, ou dire : les votants, dire : les ennemis, ou dire : les alliés, dire Napoléon, ou dire : Buonaparte, cela séparait deux hommes plus qu’un abîme. Tous les gens de bon sens convenaient que l’ère des révolutions était à jamais fermée par le roi Louis XVIII, surnommé « l’immortel auteur de la charte ». Au terre-plein du Pont-Neuf, on sculptait le mot Redivivus, sur le piédestal qui attendait la statue de Henri IV. M. Piet ébauchait, rue Thérèse, no 4, son conciliabule pour consolider la monarchie. Les chefs de la droite disaient dans les conjonctures graves : « Il faut écrire à Bacot ». MM. Canuel, O’Mahony et de Chappedelaine esquissaient, un peu approuvés de Monsieur, ce qui devait être plus tard « la conspiration du bord de l’eau ». L’Épingle Noire complotait de son côté. Delaverderie s’abouchait avec Trogoff. M. Decazes, esprit dans une certaine mesure libéral, dominait. Chateaubriand, debout tous les matins devant sa fenêtre du no 27 de la rue Saint-Dominique, en pantalon à pieds et en pantoufles, ses cheveux gris coiffés d’un madras, les yeux fixés sur un miroir, une trousse complète de chirurgien dentiste ouverte devant lui, se curait les dents, qu’il avait charmantes, tout en dictant des variantes de la Monarchie selon la Charte à M. Pilorge, son secrétaire. La critique faisant autorité préférait Lafon à Talma. M. de Féletz signait A. ; M. Hoffmann signait Z. Charles Nodier écrivait Thérèse Aubert. Le divorce était aboli. Les lycées s’appelaient collèges. Les collégiens, ornés au collet d’une fleur de lys d’or, s’y gourm aient à propos du roi de Rome. La contre-police du château dénonçait à son altesse royale Madame le portrait, partout exposé, de M. le duc d’Orléans, lequel avait meilleure mine en uniforme de colonel général des hussards que M. le duc de Berry en uniforme de colonel général des dragons ; grave inconvénient. La ville de Paris faisait redorer à ses frais le dôme des Invalides. Les hommes sérieux se demandaient ce que ferait, dans telle ou telle occasion, M. de Trinquelague ; M. Clausel de Montals se séparait, sur divers points, de M. Clausel de Coussergues ; M. de Salaberry n’était pas content. Le comédien Picard, qui était de l’Académie dont le comédien Molière n’avait pu être, faisait jouer les deux Philibert à l’Odéon, sur le fronton duquel l’arrachement des lettres laissait encore lire distinctement : THÉÂTRE DE L’IMPÉRATRICE. On prenait parti pour ou contre Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabvier était factieux ; Bavoux était révolutionnaire. Le libraire Pélicier publiait une édition de Voltaire, sous ce titre : Œuvres de Voltaire, de l’Académie française. « Cela fait venir les acheteurs », disait cet éditeur naïf. L’opinion générale était que M. Charles Loyson serait le génie du siècle ; l’envie commençait à le mordre, signe de gloire ; et l’on faisait sur lui ce vers :","1817 is the year that Louis XVIII, with a certain royal aplomb that was not lacking in pride, called the twenty-second of his reign. This is the year in which M. Bruguière de Sorsum was famous. All the wig-makers' shops, hoping for gunpowder and the return of the royal bird, were whitewashed with azure and fleur-de-lysed. It was the candid time when Count Lynch sat every Sunday as churchwarden on the bench of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in the habit of a peer of France, with his red cord and his long nose, and this majesty in profile particular to a man who has done something brilliant. The brilliant action committed by Mr. Lynch was this: having, being mayor of Bordeaux, on March 12, 1814, given the city a little too soon to the Duke of Angoulême. Hence his peerage. In 1817, fashion engulfed little boys aged four to six under vast leather caps with ear flaps rather resembling Eskimo mitres. The French army was dressed in white, Austrian style; the regiments were called legions; instead of figures they bore the names of the departments. Napoleon was at Saint Helena, and as England refused him green cloth, he had his old clothes turned over. In 1817, Pellegrini sang, Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potter reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui succeeded Forioso. There were still Prussians in France. Mr. Delalot was a character. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the fist, then the head, of Pleignier, Carbonneau and Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand, Grand Chamberlain, and the Abbé Louis, designated Minister of Finance, looked at each other laughing at the laughter of two augurs; both had celebrated, on July 14, 1790, the Mass of the Federation at the Champ-de-Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis had served it as deacon. In 1817, in the back alleys of this same Champ-de-Mars, one could see large wooden cylinders, lying in the rain, rotting in the grass, painted blue with traces of eagles and degilded bees. . These were the columns which, two years previously, had supported the Emperor's platform at the Champ-de-Mai. They were blackened here and there with the burning of the bivouac of the sturdy Austrians near the Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in the fires of these bivouacs and had warmed the large hands of the kaiserlicks. The Champ-de-Mai had been remarkable in that it had been held in June and at the Champ-de-Mars. In this year of 1817, two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the chartered snuffbox. The most recent Parisian emotion was the crime of Dautun who had thrown his brother's head into the basin of the Marché-aux-Fleurs. They were beginning to make an inquiry at the Ministry of the Navy into that fatal frigate, the Medusa, which was to cover Chaumareix with shame and Géricault with glory. Colonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Suleiman Pasha there. The Palais des Thermes, rue de la Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. You could still see on the platform of the octagonal tower of the Hôtel de Cluny the little wooden cabin which had served as an observatory for Messier, a naval astronomer under Louis XVI. The Duchess of Duras read to three or four friends, in her boudoir furnished with X in sky blue satin, Ourika unpublished. We scratched the N at the Louvre. The Pont d'Austerlitz abdicated and was called Pont du Jardin du Roi, a double enigma that disguised both the Pont d'Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes. Louis XVIII, preoccupied, while annotating with the corner of Horace's fingernail, heroes who make themselves emperors and clog-makers who make themselves dolphins, had two concerns, Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy gave for prize subject: The happiness that study brings. M. Bellart was officially eloquent. We saw germinating in its shadow this future Advocate General of Broë, promised to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. There was a fake Chateaubriand called Marchangy, while waiting for there to be a fake Marchangy called d'Arlincourt. Claire d'Albe and Malek-Adel were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was declared the leading writer of the time. The Institute allowed Academician Napoleon Bonaparte to be struck from its list. A royal ordinance erected Angoulême as a naval school, for, the Duke of Angoulême being grand admiral, it was obvious that the city of Angoulême had by right all the qualities of a seaport, without which the monarchical principle would have been started. The question was debated in the Council of Ministers of whether the vignettes representing aerobatics which seasoned the posters of Franconi and which gathered the street pranks should be tolerated. M. Paër, author of Agnese, a square-faced man with a wart on his cheek, conducted the little private concerts of the Marquise de Sassenaye in the rue de la Ville-l’Évêque. All the young girls were singing The Hermit of Saint-Avelle, lyrics by Edmond Géraud. The Yellow Dwarf transformed into a Mirror. The Café Lemblin held for the Emperor against the Café Valois which held for the Bourbons. M. le Duc de Berry had just been married to a princess of Sicily, already watched from the depths of the shadow by Louvel. Madame de Stael had been dead for a year. The bodyguards whistled Mademoiselle Mars. The big newspapers were very small. The format was restricted, but the freedom was great. The Constitutional was constitutional. La Minerve called Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. This t made the bourgeois laugh a great deal at the expense of the great writer. In sold newspapers, prostituted journalists insulted the outlaws of 1815; David no longer had talent, Arnault no longer had wit, Carnot no longer had probity; Soult had won no battle; it is true that Napoleon no longer had any genius. Everyone knows that it is quite rare for letters sent by post to an exile to reach him, the police making it a religious duty to intercept them. The fact is not new; The banished Descartes complained about it. Now, David having, in a Belgian newspaper, shown some displeasure at not receiving the letters that were written to him, this seemed amusing to the royalist papers, which ridiculed the outlaw on this occasion. To say: the regicides, or to say: the voters, to say: the enemies, or to say: the allies, to say Napoleon, or to say: Buonaparte, that separated two men more than an abyss. All people of common sense agreed that the era of revolutions was forever closed by King Louis XVIII, nicknamed “the immortal author of the charter”. On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, the word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal which awaited the statue of Henri IV. M. Piet sketched out, rue Therese, No. 4, his council to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of the right said in serious circumstances: ""We must write to Bacot."" MM. Canuel, O’Mahony and de Chappedelaine sketched, with some approval from Monsieur, what was later to be “the conspiracy by the water’s edge”. The Black Pin was plotting on his side. Delaverderie was talking to Trogoff. M. Decazes, of a somewhat liberal spirit, dominated. Chateaubriand, standing every morning in front of his window at No. 27 rue Saint-Dominique, in trousers and slippers, his gray hair styled in a madras, his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete dental surgeon's kit open in front of him, he was picking his charming teeth, while dictating variants of the Monarchy according to the Charter to M. Pilorge, his secretary. Authoritative criticism preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Feletz signed A.; M. Hoffmann signed Z. Charles Nodier wrote Thérèse Aubert. Divorce was abolished. High schools were called colleges. The schoolboys, adorned at the collar with a gold fleur-de-lys, gossip about the King of Rome. The counter-police of the chateau denounced to Her Royal Highness Madame the portrait, exposed everywhere, of the Duc d'Orléans, who looked better in the uniform of the Colonel General of the Hussars than the Duc de Berry in the uniform of the Colonel General. dragons; serious inconvenience. The city of Paris had the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense. Serious men wondered what M. de Trinquelague would do on such and such an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals separated himself, on various points, from M. Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not happy. The comedian Picard, who was from the Academy, where the comedian Molière could not have been, had the two Philiberts play at the Odéon, on the pediment of which the tearing of the letters still left the distinct reading: THEATER OF THE EMPRESS. People took sides for or against Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The bookseller Pélicier published an edition of Voltaire, under this title: Œuvres de Voltaire, de l'Académie française. “It brings in buyers,” said this naïve publisher. The general opinion was that Mr. Charles Loyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning to bite him, a sign of glory; and this verse was said about him:","Eighteen hundred and seventeen is the year that Louis XVIII described, with a royal self-assurance not lacking in pride, as the twenty-second of his reign. It is the year when Monsieur Bruguière de Sorsum was famous. All the wig-makers’ shops, hoping that the ‘royal bird’ style of powdered wig would make a comeback, were painted blue with the fleur-de-lys. It was the time when, as churchwarden, Comte Lynch sat in the front pew of St-Germain-des-Prés every Sunday wearing the robes of the French peerage, with his Legion of Honour and his long nose, and that majesty of profile characteristic of a man who has performed a brilliant deed. The brilliant deed performed by Monsieur Lynch was this: having as mayor of Bordeaux, on the twelfth of March 1814, surrendered the city a little too promptly to Monsieur le Duc d’Angoulême. Hence his peerage. In 1817 it was the fashion for little boys of between four and six years of age to be enveloped in huge morocco-leather caps with ear-flaps, quite similar to Eskimo headwear. The French army was dressed in white, Austrian-style; regiments were called legions, and instead of numbers they bore the names of départements. Napoleon was on St Helena, and as England refused to provide him with green cloth he was having his old coats turned. In 1817 Pellegrini sang, Mademoiselle Bigottini danced, Potier ruled the stage, Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui was stepping into the shoes of Forioso. There were still Prussians in France, Monsieur Delalot was a prominent figure. Legitimacy had recently asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the head, of Pleignier, Carbonneau and Tolleron. Grand Chamberlain Prince de Talleyrand and minister of finance designate Abbé Louis laughed like two soothsayers catching each other’s eye: on the fourteenth of July 1790, both of them had celebrated mass in the Champ de Mars for the Feast of the Federation, Talleyrand officiating as bishop and Louis serving as deacon. In 1817, in the side avenues of this same Champ de Mars, great wooden pillars, painted blue with traces of gilded eagles and bees on them, were to be seen lying in the rain, rotting in the grass. These were the columns that two years earlier had supported the emperor’s dais in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened in places, scorched by the camp fires of the Austrians bivouacked near the Gros-Caillou district of Paris. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in their camp fires and warmed the kaiserlicks’ big hands. The remarkable thing about the Champ de Mai was that it was held in the month of June in the Champ de Mars. In the year 1817 two things were popular: the Touquet edition of Voltaire and the Charter-engraved snuff-box. The latest sensation in Paris was the murder committed by Dautun, who had thrown his brother’s head into the fountain at the Marché aux Fleurs. The Ministry of Naval Affairs had opened an investigation into the doomed frigate Medusa, which was to cover Chaumareix with shame and Géricault with glory. Colonel Selves went to Egypt, there to become Suleiman Pasha. The Palais des Thermes, in Rue de La Harpe, was used as a cooper’s shop. The little wooden cabin that had served Messier, the naval astronomer under Louis XVI, as an observatory could still be seen on the flat roof of the Hôtel de Cluny’s octagonal tower. In her boudoir furnished with sky-blue satin stools the Duchesse de Duras read to three or four friends her unpublished Ourika. The Ns were scraped off the Louvre. The Pont d’Austerlitz abdicated and took the name Pont du Jardin du Roi – a twofold riddle, disguising both the Pont d’Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes. Bringing to his close reading of Horace a particular interest in heroes who become emperors and clog-makers who become dauphins, Louis XVIII had two causes for concern: Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy set as the subject for its prize competition ‘The Happiness to be Attained through Study’. Monsieur Bellart was professionally eloquent. Seen preparing to follow in his footsteps was advocate-general-to-be de Broë, destined to be lampooned by Paul-Louis Courier. There was a pseudo-Chateaubriand named Marchangy, anticipating a pseudo-Marchangy named d’Arlincourt. Claire d’Albe and Malek-Adel were literary masterpieces, and Madame Cottin was declared the leading writer of the age. The Institute allowed the Academician Napoleon Bonaparte to be struck off its list of members. A royal decree established Angoulême as the site of a naval academy, for with the Duc d’Angoulême being grand admiral, obviously the city of Angoulême was entitled as a matter of course to all the distinctions of a seaport; otherwise, the monarchic principle would have been undermined. The question was raised in the Council of Ministers whether the vignettes of acrobatics that adorned Franconi’s advertising posters and attracted throngs of street urchins should be tolerated. Monsieur Paer, author of Agnese, a fellow with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the Marquise de Sassenay’s small private concerts in Rue de la Ville-l’Évêque. All young girls sang ‘L’Ermite de St-Avelle’, words by Edmond Géraud. Le Nain Jaune became Le Miroir. The Café Lemblin favoured the emperor, as opposed to the Café Valois which favoured the Bourbons. Already watched from the shadows by Louvel, the Duc de Berry had just been married to a princess of Sicily. It had been a year since Madame de Staël died. Mademoiselle Mars was booed by members of the royal guard. Newspapers of substance were all very lightweight. Their format was small but they had great freedom of expression. Le Constitutionnel was constitutional. La Minerve called Chateaubriand ‘Chateaubriant’. That prompted much laughter among the bourgeoisie at the expense of the great writer. In suborned newspapers time-serving journalists jeered at those exiled in 1815: David was now devoid of talent, Arnault of wit, Carnot of integrity; Soult had not won a single battle. It is true that Napoleon had lost his military genius. Everybody knows that letters sent to an exile through the post rarely reach their destination, with the police making it their sacred duty to intercept them. This is nothing new. Descartes complained of it during his banishment. Now, when David in a Belgian newspaper expressed some vexation at not having received letters that had been written to him, this was seen as cause for amusement by the royalist rags, which took the opportunity to mock the exile. Whether one said ‘regicides’ or ‘voters’, ‘enemies’ or ‘allies’, ‘Napoleon’ or ‘Buonaparte’ – this could divide two men more than any abyss. All right-minded people agreed that King Louis XVIII, hailed as ‘the immortal author of the Charter’, had put an end for ever to the era of revolutions. In the open space on the Pont-Neuf the word ‘Redivivus’* was carved on the pedestal awaiting the statue of Henri IV. At 4 Rue Thérèse, Monsieur Piet launched his secret conclave dedicated to consolidating the monarchy. In moments of crisis the leaders of the right would say, ‘We must write to Bacot.’ Messieurs Canuel, O’Mahony and De Chappedelaine were devising – not without the approval of Monsieur – what was later to become ‘the Riverside Conspiracy’. The Black Pin had a conspiracy of its own. Delaverderie made contact with Trogoff. Monsieur Decazes, who was something of a liberal, held sway. At 27 Rue St-Dominique, Chateaubriand stood at his window every morning in leggings and slippers, his grey hair in a madras head scarf, staring into a mirror and with a complete set of dentist’s instruments laid out before him cleaning his splendid teeth while dictating to his secretary Monsieur Pilorge drafts of ‘The Monarchy according to the Charter’. The leading critics rated Lafon above Talma. Monsieur de Féletz signed himself ‘A’. Monsieur Hoffmann signed himself ‘Z’. Charles Nodier wrote Thérèse Aubert. Divorce was abolished. The lycées were called ‘colleges’. College students, their collars trimmed with a gold fleur-de-lys, came to blows over the king of Rome. The palace’s police spies reported to Her Royal Highness Madame the ubiquitously displayed portrait of Monsieur le Duc d’Orléans, in which – very unfortunately – he cut a better figure in his uniform as colonel-general of the hussars than Monsieur le Duc de Berry in his uniform as colonel-general of the dragoons. The city of Paris had the dome of Les Invalides regilded at its own expense. Serious-minded men wondered what Monsieur de Trinquelague would do in this or that event. Monsieur Clausel de Montals was at odds with Monsieur Clausel de Coussergues on a number of points. Monsieur de Salaberry was not pleased. The actor Picard, who was a member of the Academy to which the actor Molière had not been able to gain membership, had Les Deux Philibert staged at the Odéon on the front of which ‘THE EMPRESS THEATRE’ was still clearly legible, although the letters had been stripped off. People took sides for or against Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabvier was seditious, Bavoux revolutionary. The bookseller Pélicier published an edition of Voltaire under the title Works by Voltaire of the French Academy. ‘It attracts buyers,’ said this candid editor. The general opinion was that Monsieur Charles Loyson would be the genius of the century. He was beginning to be the subject of envy – an indication of success.",", with a certain royal assurance which was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. It is the year in which M. Bruguière de Sorsum was celebrated. All the hairdressers’ shops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird, were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in the church-warden’s pew of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action. The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this: being mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d’Angoulême. Hence his peerage. In 1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. The French army was dressed in white, after the mode of the Austrian; the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers they bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and since England refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, and the Abbé Louis, appointed minister of finance, laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the two augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might have been seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with traces of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. These were the columns which two years before had upheld the Emperor’s platform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and there with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had this remarkable point: that it had been held in the month of June and in the Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box à la Charter. The most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother’s head into the fountain of the Flower-Market. They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account of the lack of news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, which was destined to cover Chaumareix with infamy and Géricault with glory. Colonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace of Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On the platform of the octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little shed of boards, which had served as an observatory to Messier, the naval astronomer under Louis XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse de Duras read to three or four friends her unpublished Ourika, in her boudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue satin. The N’s were scratched off the Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of the King’s Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, which disguised the bridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis XVIII. , much preoccupied while annotating Horace with the corner of his finger-nail, heroes who have become emperors, and makers of wooden shoes who have become dauphins, had two anxieties,—Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy had given for its prize subject, The Happiness procured through Study. M. Bellart was officially eloquent. In his shadow could be seen germinating that future advocate-general of Broë, dedicated to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. There was a false Chateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim, until there should be a false Marchangy, named d’Arlincourt. Claire d’Albe and Malek-Adel were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of the epoch. The Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken from its list of members. A royal ordinance erected Angoulême into a naval school; for the Duc d’Angoulême, being lord high admiral, it was evident that the city of Angoulême had all the qualities of a seaport; otherwise the monarchical principle would have received a wound. In the Council of Ministers the question was agitated whether vignettes representing slack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi’s advertising posters, and which attracted throngs of street urchins, should be tolerated. M. Paër, the author of Agnese, a good sort of fellow, with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the little private concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l’Évêque. All the young girls were singing the Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with words by Edmond Géraud. The Yellow Dwarf was transferred into Mirror. The Café Lemblin stood up for the Emperor, against the Café Valois, which upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de Berri, already surveyed from the shadow by Louvel, had just been married to a princess of Sicily. Madame de Staël had died a year previously. The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars. The grand newspapers were all very small. Their form was restricted, but their liberty was great. The Constitutionnel was constitutional. La Minerve called Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. That t made the good middle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the great writer. In journals which sold themselves, prostituted journalists, insulted the exiles of 1815. David had no longer any talent, Arnault had no longer any wit, Carnot was no longer honest , Soult had won no battles; it is true that Napoleon had no longer any genius. No one is ignorant of the fact that letters sent to an exile by post very rarely reached him, as the police made it their religious duty to intercept them. This is no new fact; Descartes complained of it in his exile. Now David, having, in a Belgian publication, shown some displeasure at not receiving letters which had been written to him, it struck the royalist journals as amusing; and they derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. What separated two men more than an abyss was to say, the regicides, or to say the voters; to say the enemies, or to say the allies; to say Napoleon, or to say Buonaparte. All sensible people were agreed that the era of revolution had been closed forever by King Louis XVIII. , surnamed “The Immortal Author of the Charter.” On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, the word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal that awaited the statue of Henry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Thérèse, No. 4, was making the rough draft of his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of the Right said at grave conjunctures, “We must write to Bacot.” MM. Canuel, O’Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, to some extent with Monsieur’s approval, of what was to become later on “The Conspiracy of the Bord de l’Eau”—of the waterside. L’Épingle Noire was already plotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring with Trogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand stood every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers, and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist’s instruments spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which were charming, while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter to M. Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone, preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Féletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmann signed himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote Thérèse Aubert. Divorce was abolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. The collegians, decorated on the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other apropos of the King of Rome. The counter-police of the château had denounced to her Royal Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the Duc d’Orléans, who made a better appearance in his uniform of a colonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform of colonel-general of dragoons—a serious inconvenience. The city of Paris was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense. Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such or such an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M. Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. The comedian Picard, who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Molière had not been able to do, had The Two Philiberts played at the Odéon, upon whose pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OF THE EMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The Liberal, Pélicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the following title: Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy. “That will attract purchasers,” said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M. Charles Loyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning to gnaw at him—a sign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:—","THE YEAR 1817 was that which Louis XVIII. , with a certain royal assumation not devoid of stateliness, styled the twenty-second year of his reign. It was the year when M. Bruguière de Sorsum was famous. All the hair-dressers’ shops, hoping for the return of powder and birds of Paradise, were bedizened with azure and fleurs-de-lis. It was the honest time when Count Lynch sat every Sunday as churchwarden on the official bench at Saint Germain des Prés, in the dress of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and long nose, and that majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has done a brilliant deed. The brilliant deed committed by M. Lynch was that, being mayor of Bordeaux on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a little too soon to the Duke of Angoulême. Hence his peerage. In 1817 it was the fashion to swallow up little boys from four to six years old in great morocco caps with ears, strongly resembling the chimney-pots of the Esquimaux. The French army was dressed in white after the Austrian style; regiments were called legions, and wore, instead of numbers, the names of the departments. Napoleon was at St. Helena, and as England would not give him green cloth, had had his old coats turned. In 1817, Pellegrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry was not yet in existence. Madame Saqui succeeded to Forioso. There were Prussians still in France. M. Delalot was a personage. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the fist and then the head of Pleignier, Carbonneau, and Tolleron. Prince Talleyrand, the grand chamberlain, and Abbé Louis, the designated minister of the finances, looked each other in the face, laughing like two augurs; both had celebrated the mass of the Federation in the Champ-de-Mars on the 14th of July, 1790; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis had served him as deacon. In 1817, in the cross-walks of this same Champ-de-Mars, were seen huge wooden cylinders painted blue, with traces of eagles and bees, that had lost their gilding, lying in the rain, and rotting in the grass. There were the columns which, two years before, had supported the estrade of the emperor in the Champ-de-Mai. They were blackened here and there from the bivouac-fires of the Austrians in barracks near the Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in the fires of these bivouacs, and had warmed the huge hands of the kaiserlics. The Champ-de-Mai was remarkable from the fact of having been held in the month of June, and on the Champ-de-Mars. In the year 1817 two things were popular—Voltaire-Touquet and Chartist snuff-boxes. The latest Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother’s head into the fountain of the Marché-aux-Fleurs. People were beginning to find fault with the minister of the navy for having no news of that fated frigate, La Méduse, which was to cover Chaumareix with shame, and Géricault with glory. Colonel Selves went to Egypt, there to become Soliman-Pacha. The palace of the Thermes, Rue de La Harpe, was turned into a cooper’s shop. On the platform of the octagonal tower of the hotel de Cluny, the little board shed was still to be seen, which had served as observatory to Messier, the astronomer of the navy under Louis XVI. The Duchess of Duras read to three or four friends, in her boudoir, furnished in sky-blue satin, the manuscript of Ourika. The N’s were erased from the Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz abdicated its name, and became the bridge of the Jardin-du-Roi, an enigma which disguised at once the bridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin-des-Plantes. Louis XVIII. , absently annotating Horace with his finger-nail while thinking about heroes that had become emperors, and shoemakers that had become dauphins, had two cares, Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy gave as a prize theme, The happiness which Study procures. M. Bellart was eloquent, officially. In his shadow was seen taking root the future Attorney-General, de Broë, promised to the sarcasms of Paul Louis Courier. There was a counterfeit Chateaubriand called Marchangy, as there was to be later a counterfeit Marchangy called d’Arlincourt. Claire d’Albe and Malek Adel were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was declared the first writer of the age. The Institute struck from its list the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte. A royal ordinance established a naval school at Angoulême for the Duke of Angoulême being Grand Admiral, it was evident that the town of Angoulême had by right all the qualities of a seaport, without which the monarchical principle would have been assailed. The question whether the pictures, representing acrobats, which spiced the placards of Franconi and drew together the blackguards of the streets, should be tolerated, was agitated in the cabinet councils. M. Paër, the author of l’Agnese, an honest man with square jaws and a wart on his cheek, directed the small, select concerts of the Marchioness de Sassenaye, Rue de la Ville-l’Evêque. All the young girls sang l’Ermite de Saint Avelle, words by Edmond Géraud. The Nain juane was transformed into the Miroir. The Café Lemblin stood out for the emperor in opposition to the Café Valois, which was in favour of the Bourbons. A marriage had just been made with a Sicilian princess for the Duke of Berry, who was already in reality regarded with suspicion by Louvel. Madame de Staël had been dead a year. Mademoiselle Mars was hissed by the body-guards. The great journals were all small. The form was limited, but the liberty was large. Le Constitutionnel was constitutional; La Minerve called Chateaubriand, Chateaubriant. This excited great laughter among the citizens at the expense of the great writer. In purchased journals, prostituted journalists insulted the outlaws of 1815; David no longer had talent, Arnault no longer had ability, Carnot no longer had probity, Soult had never gained a victory; it is true that Napoleon no longer had genius. Everybody knows that letters sent through the post to an exile rarely reach their destination, the police making it a religious duty to intercept them. This fact is by no means a new one; Descartes complained of it in his banishment. Now, David having shown some feeling in a Belgian journal at not receiving the letters addressed to him, this seemed ludicrous to the royalist papers, who seized the occasion to ridicule the exile. To say, regicides, instead of voters, enemies instead of allies, Napoleon instead of Buonaparte, separated two men more than an abyss. All people of common sense agreed that the era of revolutions had been for ever closed by King Louis XVIII. , surnamed “The immortal author of the Charter.” At the terreplain of the Pont Neuf, the word Redivivus was sculptured on the pedestal which awaited the statue of Henri IV. M. Piet at Rue Thérèse, No. 4, was sketching the plan of his cabal to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of the Right said, in grave dilemmas, “We must write to Bacol.” Messrs. Canuel O’Mahony and Chappedelaine made a beginning, not altogether without the approbation of Monsieur, of what was afterwards to become the “conspiracy of the Bord de l’Eau.” L’Epingle Noire plotted on its side; Delaverderie held interviews with Trogoff; M. Decazes, a mind in some degree liberal, prevailed. Chateaubriand, standing every morning at his window in the Rue Saint Dominique, No. 27, in stocking pantaloons and slippers, his grey hair covered with a Madras handkerchief, a mirror before his eyes, and a complete case of dental instruments open before him, cleaned his teeth which were excellent, while dictating La Monarchie selon la Charte to M. Pilorge, his secretary. The critics in authority preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Féletz signed himself A., M. Hoffman signed himself Z. Charles Nodier was writing Thérèse Aubert. Divorce was abolished. The lyceums called themselves colleges. The students, decorated on the collar with a golden fleur-de-lis, pommelled each other over the King of Rome. The secret police of the palace denounced to her royal highness, Madame, the portrait of the Duke of Orleans, which was everywhere to be seen, and which looked better in the uniform of colonel-general of hussars than the Duke of Berry in the uniform of colonel-general of dragoons—a serious matter. The city of Paris regilded the dome of the Invalides at its expense. Grave citizens asked each other what M. de Trinquelague would do in such or such a case; M. Clausel de Montals differed on sundry points from M. Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. Comedy-writer Picard, of the Academy to which comedy-writer Molière could not belong, had Les deux Philiberts played at the Odeon, on the pediment of which , the removal of the letters still permitted the inscription to be read distinctly: THEATRE DE L’IMPÉRATRICE. People took sides for or against Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The bookseller Pelicier published an edition of Voltaire under the title, Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy. “That will attract buyers,” said the naive publisher. The general opinion was that M. Charles Loyson would be the genius of the age; envy was beginning to nibble at him, a sign of glory, and the line was made on him——"

"Cosette était laide. Heureuse, elle eût peut-être été jolie. Nous avons déjà esquissé cette petite figure sombre. Cosette était maigre et blême ; elle avait près de huit ans, on lui en eût donné à peine six. Ses grands yeux enfoncés dans une sorte d’ombre étaient presque éteints à force d’avoir pleuré. Les coins de sa bouche avaient cette courbe de l’angoisse habituelle, qu’on observe chez les condamnés et chez les malades désespérés. Ses mains étaient, comme sa mère l’avait deviné, « perdues d’engelures ». Le feu qui l’éclairait en ce moment faisait saillir les angles de ses os et rendait sa maigreur affreusement visible. Comme elle grelottait toujours, elle avait pris l’habitude de serrer ses deux genoux l’un contre l’autre. Tout son vêtement n’était qu’un haillon qui eût fait pitié l’été et qui faisait horreur l’hiver. Elle n’avait sur elle que de la toile trouée ; pas un chiffon de laine. On voyait sa peau çà et là, et l’on y distinguait partout des taches bleues ou noires qui indiquaient les endroits où la Thénardier l’avait touchée. Ses jambes nues étaient rouges et grêles. Le creux de ses clavicules était à faire pleurer. Toute la personne de cette enfant, son allure, son attitude, le son de sa voix, ses intervalles entre un mot et l’autre, son regard, son silence, son moindre geste, exprimaient et traduisaient une seule idée, la crainte.","Cosette was ugly. Happy, she might have been pretty. We have already sketched this dark little figure. Cosette was thin and pale; she was almost eight years old, one would have thought she was barely six. Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost extinguished from crying. The corners of his mouth had that curve of habitual anguish, which one observes in the condemned and in the hopelessly sick. His hands were, as his mother had guessed, ""lost with frostbite."" The fire which lit him at this moment made the angles of his bones protrude and made his thinness hideously visible. As she was still shivering, she had taken to pressing her two knees together. His whole garment was nothing but a rag, which would have caused pity in the summer and horrified in the winter. She had nothing on her but ragged canvas; not a woolen rag. You could see her skin here and there, and everywhere you could distinguish blue or black spots which indicated the places where Madame Thénardier had touched her. Her bare legs were red and spindly. The hollow of his collarbones was to make you cry. The whole person of this child, her demeanor, her attitude, the sound of her voice, her intervals between one word and another, her gaze, her silence, her slightest gesture, expressed and translated a single idea, fear.","Cosette was ugly.

The corners of her mouth had that downward turn of habitual anguish to be observed in the condemned and the incurably sick. As her mother had suspected, her hands were ‘covered with chilblains’.

As she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees together. She wore no more than a rag of clothing that would have been pitiful in summer and was horrifying in winter. All she had on was tattered cotton, not a scrap of wool. Her skin showed through here and there, marked black and blue all over, indicating where the Thénardier woman had hit her.

"Quelques jours après, il pouvait être huit heures du soir, il était dans sa chambre et il faisait épeler Cosette à haute voix, il entendit ouvrir, puis refermer la porte de la masure. Cela lui parut singulier. La vieille, qui seule habitait avec lui la maison, se couchait toujours à la nuit pour ne point user de chandelle. Jean Valjean fit signe à Cosette de se taire. Il entendit qu’on montait l’escalier. A la rigueur, ce pouvait être la vieille qui avait pu se trouver malade et aller chez l’apothicaire. Jean Valjean écouta. Le pas était lourd et sonnait comme le pas d’un homme ; mais la vieille portait de gros souliers et rien ne ressemble au pas d’un homme comme le pas d’une vieille femme. Cependant Jean Valjean souffla sa chandelle.","A few days later, it might have been eight o'clock in the evening, he was in his room and he was making Cosette spell out loud, he heard the door of the hovel open and then close. It seemed strange to him. The old woman, who alone lived with him in the house, always went to bed at night so as not to use a candle. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be silent. He heard someone coming up the stairs. If need be, it might have been the old woman who had been ill and had gone to the apothecary. Jean Valjean listened. The step was heavy and sounded like the step of a man; but the old woman wore big shoes and nothing resembles the footsteps of a man like the footsteps of an old woman. However, Jean Valjean blew out his candle.","A few days later, it might have been eight in the evening, he was in his room, making Cosette read aloud, when he heard the front door open, then shut again. This struck him as odd. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house apart from him, always went to bed at nightfall so as not to use up her candles. Jean Valjean signalled to Cosette to be quiet. He heard someone coming upstairs. It was just possible it could be the old woman, who might have felt unwell and gone out to the pharmacy. Jean Valjean listened. It was a heavy footfall and sounded like a man’s, but the old woman wore stout shoes and there is nothing so like a man’s footfall as that of an old woman. All the same, Jean Valjean blew out his candle.","A few days afterwards,—it might have been at eight o’clock in the evening,—he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud, when he heard the house door open and then shut again. This struck him as singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might not burn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet. He heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the old woman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary’s. Jean Valjean listened. The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old woman wore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew out his candle.","Some days after, it might be eight o’clock in the evening , he was in his room, giving Cosette her spelling lesson, which the child was repeating in a loud voice, when he heard the door of the building open and close again. That seemed odd to him. The old woman, the only occupant of the house besides himself and Cosette, always went to bed at dark to save candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be silent. He heard some one coming up the stairs. Possibly, it might be the old woman who had felt unwell and had been to the druggist’s. Jean Valjean listened. The footstep was heavy, and sounded like a man’s; but the old woman wore heavy shoes, and there is nothing so much like the step of a man as the step of an old woman. However, Jean Valjean blew out his candle."

"Il avait envoyé Cosette au lit en lui disant tout bas : ― Couche-toi bien doucement ; et, pendant qu’il la baisait au front, les pas s’étaient arrêtés. Jean Valjean demeura en silence, immobile, le dos tourné à la porte, assis sur sa chaise dont il n’avait pas bougé, retenant son souffle dans l’obscurité. Au bout d’un temps assez long, n’entendant plus rien, il se retourna sans faire de bruit, et, comme il levait les yeux vers la porte de sa chambre, il vit une lumière par le trou de la serrure. Cette lumière faisait une sorte d’étoile sinistre dans le noir de la porte et du mur. Il y avait évidemment là quelqu’un qui tenait une chandelle à la main, et qui écoutait.","He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice: “Lie down very quietly; and, while he was kissing her forehead, the footsteps had stopped.

Having heard nothing after quite a long while, not making a sound he turned round, and as he looked up at the door to his room he saw a light through the keyhole. This light created the effect of a sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There was obviously someone there, holding a candle, listening.","He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, “Get into bed very softly”; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.

After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as he heard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There was evidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand and listening.","He sent Cosette to bed, telling her in a suppressed voice to lie down very quietly—and, as he kissed her forehead, the footsteps stopped.

"Les lecteurs ont peut-être, dès sa première apparition, conservé quelque souvenir de cette Thénardier grande, blonde, rouge, grasse, charnue, carrée, énorme et agile ; elle tenait, nous l’avons dit, de la race de ces sauvagesses colosses qui se cambrent dans les foires avec des pavés pendus à leur chevelure. Elle faisait tout dans le logis, les lits, les chambres, la lessive, la cuisine, la pluie, le beau temps, le diable. Elle avait pour tout domestique Cosette ; une souris au service d’un éléphant. Tout tremblait au son de sa voix, les vitres, les meubles et les gens. Son large visage, criblé de taches de rousseur, avait l’aspect d’une écumoire. Elle avait de la barbe. C’était l’idéal d’un fort de la halle habillé en fille. Elle jurait splendidement ; elle se vantait de casser une noix d’un coup de poing. Sans les romans qu’elle avait lus, et qui, par moments, faisaient bizarrement reparaître la mijaurée sous l’ogresse, jamais l’idée ne fût venue à personne de dire d’elle : c’est une femme. Cette Thénardier était comme le produit de la greffe d’une donzelle sur une poissarde. Quand on l’entendait parler, on disait : C’est un gendarme ; quand on la regardait boire, on disait : C’est un charretier ; quand on la voyait manier Cosette, on disait : C’est le bourreau. Au repos, il lui sortait de la bouche une dent.","Readers have perhaps, from her first appearance, preserved some memory of this tall, blond, red, plump, fleshy, square, enormous and agile Thénardier; she belonged, as we have said, to the race of those colossal savages who arch their backs at fairs with cobblestones hanging from their hair. She did everything in the house, the beds, the rooms, the laundry, the kitchen, the rain, the fine weather, the devil. Her only servant was Cosette; a mouse in the service of an elephant. Everything shook at the sound of his voice, windows, furniture and people. His broad face, riddled with freckles, looked like a slotted spoon. She had a beard. It was the ideal of a hall fort dressed as a girl. She swore splendidly; she boasted of cracking a nut with a blow of her fist. Without the novels she had read, and which, at times, made the minx reappear strangely under the ogress, it would never have occurred to anyone to say of her: she is a woman. This Thénardier was like the product of the grafting of a damsel onto a poissarde. When we heard him speak, we said: He is a policeman; when we watched her drink, we said: He is a carter; when we saw her handling Cosette, we said: ""He's the executioner."" At rest, a tooth protruded from his mouth.","Our readers may have retained, from her very first appearance, some memory of this Thénardier woman, tall, blonde, ruddy, greasy, brawny, robust, huge and agile. She was, as we have said, akin to that race of feral giant-women at fairs who strut about with paving-stones suspended from their hair. She did everything in the house, the bed-making, the cleaning, the washing, the cooking, the this, the that and the other. Her only domestic help was Cosette: a mouse in the service of an elephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice, window-panes, furniture and people. Her broad face was as covered with freckles as a skimming ladle is riddled with holes. She had something of a beard. She was the archetypal market porter dressed up as a girl. She swore magnificently. She boasted of being able to crack a walnut with a single blow of her fist. Were it not for the romances she had read, which at times caused the mincing maid beneath the ogress to make a bizarre reappearance, it would never have occurred to anyone to say of her, ‘That’s a woman.’ This Thénardier woman was like the product of grafting a young little miss on a fishwife. If you heard her speak, you would say, ‘That’s a martinet.’ If you watched her drink, you would say, ‘That’s an old soak.’ If you saw the way she treated Cosette, you would say, ‘That’s a vicious brute.’ In repose, a tooth stuck out of her mouth.","Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Thénardier woman, ever since her first appearance,—tall, blond, red, fat, angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything about the house,—made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everything else. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an elephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,—window panes, furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches, presented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an ideal market-porter dressed in woman’s clothes. She swore splendidly; she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist. Except for the romances which she had read, and which made the affected lady peep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea would never have occurred to any one to say of her, “That is a woman.” This Thénardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a fishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, “That is a gendarme”; when one saw her drink, one said, “That is a carter”; when one saw her handle Cosette, one said, “That is the hangman.” One of her teeth projected when her face was in repose.","The reader has perhaps, since her first appearance, preserved some remembrance of this huge Thénardiess;—for such we shall call the female of this species,—large, blond, red, fat, brawny, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the race of those colossal wild women who posturise at fairs with paving-stones hung in their hair. She did everything about the house, the chamber-work, the washing, the cooking, anything she pleased, and played the deuce generally. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an elephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice; windows and furniture as well as people. Her broad face, covered with freckles, had the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was the ideal of a butcher’s boy dressed in petticoats. She swore splendidly; she prided herself on being able to crack a nut with her fist. Apart from the novels she had read, which at times gave you an odd glimpse of the affected lady under the ogress, the idea of calling her a woman never would have occurred to anybody. This Thénardiess seemed like a cross between a wench and a fishwoman. If you heard her speak, you would say it is a gendarme; if you saw her drink, you would say it is a cartman; if you saw her handle Cosette, you would say it is the hangman. When at rest, a tooth protruded from her mouth."
"Il achevait à peine qu’un grand bruit se fit dans l’escalier. Ils entendirent un tumulte de pas qui montaient, et la vieille portière qui disait de sa voix la plus haute et la plus perçante :","He had hardly finished when a loud noise was heard on the stairs. They heard a tumult of footsteps going up, and the old portress saying in her loudest and shrillest voice:","He had hardly finished when there was a great commotion on the staircase. They heard a thundering of footsteps coming up and the old doorkeeper saying in her loudest and most piercing voice, ‘My good monsieur, I swear to God, no one’s entered this house all day and all evening, and I haven’t once left the door unattended.’","He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase. They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the old portress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones:—","He had scarcely finished when there was a loud noise on the staircase. They heard a tumult of steps ascending, and the old portress exclaiming in her loudest and most piercing tones:"
― Qu’est-ce que c’est que celle-ci ?,―What is this?,‘What little girl is that?’,“Who is that?”,“What is this little girl?”
"Une remarque qu’on faisait encore, c’est que, chaque fois qu’il passait dans la ville un jeune savoyard courant le pays et cherchant des cheminées à ramoner, M. le maire le faisait appeler, lui demandait son nom, et lui donnait de l’argent. Les petits savoyards se le disaient, et il en passait beaucoup.","A remark that was still made is that, each time a young Savoyard passed through the town, running about the country and looking for chimneys to sweep, the mayor called him, asked his name, and gave money. The little Savoyards said it to each other, and there was a lot going on.","It was also noted that every time a young Savoyard, roaming around the area looking for chimneys to sweep, came into town monsieur le maire would send for him, ask him his name and give him money. The little Savoyards told each other about this and a great many of them came by.","Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that he encountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned, inquired his name, and gave him money. The little Savoyards told each other about it: a great many of them passed that way.","It was also remarked that whenever there passed through the city a young Savoyard who was tramping about the country in search of chimneys to sweep, the mayor would send for him, ask his name and give him money. The little Savoyards told each other, and many of them passed that way."
"Toutes les têtes se dressèrent. La sensation fut indescriptible. Il y eut dans l’auditoire un instant d’hésitation. La voix avait été si poignante, l’homme qui était là paraissait si calme, qu’au premier abord on ne comprit pas. On se demanda qui avait crié. On ne pouvait croire que ce fût cet homme tranquille qui eût jeté ce cri effrayant.","All heads lifted. The feeling was indescribable. There was a moment's hesitation in the audience. The voice had been so poignant, the man who was there seemed so calm, that at first sight no one understood. We wondered who had shouted. One could not believe that it was this quiet man who had uttered this frightful cry.",All heads were raised. The sensation caused was indescribable. There was a momentary uncertainty in the court. The voice had been so harrowing. The man who stood there appeared so calm that at first people did not understand. They wondered who had cried out. They could not believe it was this unruffled man who had uttered that ghastly cry.,"All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was a momentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been so heart-rending; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first. They asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry.","All eyes were strained towards him. The sensation was indescribable. There was a moment of hesitation in the auditory. The voice had been so thrilling, the man standing there appeared so calm, that at first nobody could comprehend it. They asked who had cried out. They could not believe that this tranquil man had uttered that fearful cry."
"― Un agent inférieur de l’autorité a manqué de respect à un magistrat de la façon la plus grave. Je viens, comme c’est mon devoir, porter le fait à votre connaissance.","―A lower officer of authority has disrespected a magistrate in the most serious manner. I come, as is my duty, to bring the fact to your attention.",‘A subordinate police officer has in the gravest manner shown lack of respect towards a magistrate. I’ve come to inform you of this fact as it is my duty to do so.’,"“An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in the gravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come to bring the fact to your knowledge, as it is my duty to do.”","“An inferior agent of the government has been wanting in respect to a magistrate, in the gravest manner. I come, as is my duty, to bring the fact to your knowledge.”"
"En ce moment il fit pour la première fois cette réflexion, — en trouvant étrange qu’elle ne lui fût pas venue plus tôt : — que c’était peut-être inutile, toute la peine qu’il prenait ; qu’il ne savait seulement pas l’heure du procès ; qu’il aurait dû au moins s’en informer ; qu’il était extravagant d’aller ainsi devant soi sans savoir si cela servirait à quelque chose. — Puis il ébaucha quelques calculs dans son esprit : — qu’ordinairement les séances des cours d’assises commençaient à neuf heures du matin ; — que cela ne devait pas être long, cette affaire-là ; — que le vol de pommes, ce serait très court ; — qu’il n’y aurait plus ensuite qu’une question d’identité ; — quatre ou cinq dépositions, peu de chose à dire pour les avocats ; — qu’il allait arriver lorsque tout serait fini !","At this moment he made this reflection for the first time, - finding it strange that it had not occurred to him sooner: - that it was perhaps useless, all the trouble he was taking; that he just didn't know the time of the trial; that he should have at least inquired about it; that it was extravagant to go ahead like this without knowing if it would be of any use. — Then he sketched out some calculations in his mind: — that ordinarily the sittings of the assize courts began at nine o'clock in the morning; — that it shouldn't take long, this affair; — that stealing apples would be very short; — that there would then only be a question of identity; — four or five depositions, little to say for the lawyers; — that he would come when it was all over!","At that moment it occurred to him for the first time – he found it odd that it had not occurred to him sooner – that all the trouble he was taking might well prove useless. He did not even know what time the trial was. He should at least have enquired about that. It was absurd to keep pressing on like this without knowing whether it would serve any purpose. Then he made a few rough calculations in his head. Usually the sittings of the court of assizes began at nine o’clock in the morning. It could not take too long, this case: the theft of the apples, that would be very brief, then it would just be a question of identification, four or five statements, not much for the lawyers to say. He was going to arrive after it was all over.","At that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection, thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: that all this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least, have informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; then he sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, the sittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o’clock in the morning; that it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples would be very brief; that there would then remain only a question of identity, four or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers to say; that he should arrive after all was over.","At this moment he thought for the first time, and it seemed strange that it had not occurred to him sooner, that perhaps all the trouble he was taking might be useless; that he did not even know the hour of the trial; that he should at least have informed himself of that; that it was foolish to be going on at this rate, without knowing whether it would be of any use. Then he figured out some calculations in his mind, that ordinarily the sessions of the courts of assize began at nine o’clock in the morning; that this case would not occupy much time; this apple-stealing would be very short; that there would be nothing but a question of identity; four or five witnesses and some little to be said by the lawyers; that he would get there after it was all over!"

"La nuit pourtant une espèce de brume visionnaire s’en dégage, et si quelque voyageur s’y promène, s’il regarde, s’il écoute, s’il rêve comme Virgile dans les funestes plaines de Philippes, l’hallucination de la catastrophe le saisit. L’effrayant 18 juin revit ; la fausse colline monument s’efface, ce lion quelconque se dissipe, le champ de bataille reprend sa réalité ; des lignes d’infanterie ondulent dans la plaine, des galops furieux traversent l’horizon ; le songeur effaré voit l’éclair des sabres, l’étincelle des bayonnettes, le flamboiement des bombes, l’entre-croisement monstrueux des tonnerres ; il entend, comme un râle au fond d’une tombe, la clameur vague de la bataille fantôme ; ces ombres, ce sont les grenadiers ; ces lueurs, ce sont les cuirassiers ; ce squelette, c’est Napoléon ; ce squelette, c’est Wellington ; tout cela n’est plus et se heurte et combat encore ; et les ravins s’empourprent, et les arbres frissonnent, et il y a de la furie jusque dans les nuées, et, dans les ténèbres, toutes ces hauteurs farouches, Mont-Saint-Jean, Hougomont, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, apparaissent confusément couronnées de tourbillons de spectres s’exterminant.","At night, however, a kind of visionary mist emanates from it, and if some traveler walks there, if he looks, if he listens, if he dreams like Virgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination of disaster seizes him. The frightening June 18 lives again; the fake monument hill disappears, this unremarkable lion dissipates, the battlefield resumes its reality; lines of infantry undulate across the plain, furious gallops cross the horizon; the bewildered dreamer sees the flash of sabers, the sparkle of bayonets, the blaze of bombs, the monstrous crisscrossing of thunder; he hears, like a rattle at the bottom of a tomb, the vague clamor of the phantom battle; these shadows are the grenadiers; these lights are the cuirassiers; this skeleton is Napoleon; this skeleton is Wellington; all that is no more and clashes and fights again; and the ravines crimson, and the trees shiver, and there is fury even in the clouds, and, in the darkness, all these fierce heights, Mont-Saint-Jean, Hougomont, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, appear confusedly crowned with swirls of exterminating specters.","Yet at night a kind of visionary mist arises from it, and if some traveller wanders there, if he looks, if he listens, if he dreams like Virgil before the fateful plains of Philippi, the haunting catastrophe grips him. That ghastly eighteenth of June comes to life again. The spurious monument hill disappears, that undistinguished lion vanishes, the battlefield regains its reality. Lines of infantry ripple over the plain, galloping charges sweep across the horizon. The terror-stricken dreamer sees the flash of sabres, the glint of bayonets, the flare of bombshells, the monstrous exchange of thunderous fire. He hears, like a dying rasp from deep in the grave, the indistinct clamour of the phantom battle. Those shadows are grenadiers, those glistenings are cuirassiers. This skeleton is Napoleon, that skeleton is Wellington. All this is no more, and still they clash and the fighting goes on. And the gullies turn red, and the trees tremble, and there is fury even in the clouds. And all those untamed heights – Hougomont, Mont-St-Jean, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit – appear in the gloom indistinctly crowned with tumults of spectres slaughtering each other.","At night, moreover, a sort of visionary mist arises from it; and if a traveller strolls there, if he listens, if he watches, if he dreams like Virgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination of the catastrophe takes possession of him. The frightful 18th of June lives again; the false monumental hillock disappears, the lion vanishes in air, the battle-field resumes its reality, lines of infantry undulate over the plain, furious gallops traverse the horizon; the frightened dreamer beholds the flash of sabres, the gleam of bayonets, the flare of bombs, the tremendous interchange of thunders ; he hears, as it were, the death rattle in the depths of a tomb, the vague clamor of the battle phantom; those shadows are grenadiers, those lights are cuirassiers; that skeleton Napoleon, that other skeleton is Wellington; all this no longer exists, and yet it clashes together and combats still; and the ravines are empurpled, and the trees quiver, and there is fury even in the clouds and in the shadows; all those terrible heights, Hougomont, Mont-Saint-Jean, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, appear confusedly crowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other.","At night, however, a sort of visionary mist arises from it, and if some traveller be walking there, if he looks, if he listens, if he dreams like Virgil in the fatal plain of Philippi, he becomes possessed by the hallucination of the disaster. The terrible 18th of June is again before him; the artificial hill of the monument fades away , this lion, whatever it be, is dispelled; the field of battle resumes its reality; the lines of infantry undulate in the plain, furious gallops traverse the horizon; the bewildered dreamer sees the flash of sabres, the glistening of bayonets, the bursting of shells, the awful intermingling of the thunders; he hears, like a death-rattle from the depths of a tomb, the vague clamour of the phantom battle; these shadows are grenadiers; these gleams are cuirassiers; this skeleton is Napoleon; that skeleton is Wellington; all this is unreal, and yet it clashes and combats; and the ravines run red, and the trees shiver, and there is fury even in the clouds and, in the darkness, all those savage heights, Mont Saint Jean, Hougomont, Frischemont, Papelotte, Planchenoit, appear confusedly crowned with whirlwinds of spectres exterminating each other.

"Si le petit pâtre, qui servait de guide à Bülow, lieutenant de Blücher, lui eût conseillé de déboucher de la forêt au-dessus de Frischemont plutôt qu’au-dessous de Plancenoit, la forme du dix-neuvième siècle eût peut-être été différente.

"Jean Valjean était d’un caractère pensif sans être triste, ce qui est le propre des natures affectueuses. Somme toute, pourtant, c’était quelque chose d’assez endormi et d’assez insignifiant, en apparence du moins, que Jean Valjean. Il avait perdu en très bas âge son père et sa mère. Sa mère était morte d’une fièvre de lait mal soignée. Son père, émondeur comme lui, s’était tué en tombant d’un arbre. Il n’était resté à Jean Valjean qu’une sœur plus âgée que lui, veuve, avec sept enfants, filles et garçons. Cette sœur avait élevé Jean Valjean, et tant qu’elle eut son mari elle logea et nourrit son jeune frère. Le mari mourut. L’aîné des sept enfants avait huit ans, le dernier un an. Jean Valjean venait d’atteindre, lui, sa vingt-cinquième année. Il remplaça le père, et soutint à son tour sa sœur qui l’avait élevé. Cela se fit simplement, comme un devoir, même avec quelque chose de bourru de la part de Jean Valjean. Sa jeunesse se dépensait ainsi dans un travail rude et mal payé. On ne lui avait jamais connu de « bonne amie » dans le pays. Il n’avait pas eu le temps d’être amoureux.","Jean Valjean was thoughtful without being sad, which is characteristic of affectionate natures. All in all, however, Jean Valjean was something rather sleepy and rather insignificant, in appearance at least. He had lost his father and his mother at a very young age. His mother had died of an ill-treated milk fever. His father, a pruner like him, had killed himself by falling from a tree. There remained to Jean Valjean only one sister older than himself, a widow, with seven children, girls and boys. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and as long as she had her husband she lodged and fed her younger brother. The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old, the last one year old. Jean Valjean had just reached his twenty-fifth year. He replaced the father, and in turn supported his sister who had raised him. It was done simply, as a duty, even with something gruff on Jean Valjean's part. His youth was thus wasted in hard and badly paid work. She had never been known to have a ""good friend"" in the country. He hadn't had time to fall in love.","Jean Valjean was a thoughtful individual without being gloomy, which is typical of those who are by nature affectionate. On the whole, however, Jean Valjean was, in appearance at least, a rather dozy and unremarkable creature. He had lost his father and mother at a very early age. His mother had died of milk fever that was not properly treated. His father, a tree-pruner like himself, was killed falling from a tree. Jean Valjean was left with only a widowed sister older than himself, who had seven children, boys and girls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean and as long as she still had her husband she housed and fed her younger brother. The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old, the youngest, one. Jean Valjean had just reached the age of twenty-five. He took the father’s place, and he in turn supported the sister who had brought him up. This was done as a matter of course, as a duty, even a little churlishly, on the part of Jean Valjean. And so his youth was spent doing hard and ill-paid work. He was never known to have had any local ‘sweetheart’. He had no time for being in love.","Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole, however, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about Jean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother at a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had not been properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had been killed by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean was a sister older than himself,—a widow with seven children, boys and girls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother. The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old. The youngest, one. Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the father’s place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought him up. This was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill-paid toil. He had never known a “kind woman friend” in his native parts. He had not had the time to fall in love.","Jean Valjean was of a thoughtful disposition, but not sad, which is characteristic of affectionate natures. Upon the whole, however, there was something torpid and insignificant, in the appearance at least, of Jean Valjean. He had lost his parents when very young. His mother died of malpractice in a milkfever: his father, a pruner before him, was killed by a fall from a tree. Jean Valjean now had but one relative left, his sister, a widow with seven children, girls and boys. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and, as long as her husband lived, she had taken care of her younger brother. Her husband died, leaving the eldest of these children eight, the youngest one year old. Jean Valjean had just reached his twenty-fifth year: he took the father’s place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who reared him. This he did naturally, as a duty, and even with a sort of moroseness on his part. His youth was spent in rough and ill-recompensed labour: he never was known to have a sweetheart; he had not time to be in love."

"Pourtant l’armée anglaise était la plus malade. Les poussées furieuses de ces grands escadrons à cuirasses de fer et à poitrine d’acier avaient broyé l’infanterie. Quelques hommes autour d’un drapeau marquaient la place d’un régiment, tel bataillon n’était plus commandé que par un capitaine ou par un lieutenant ; la division Alten, déjà si maltraitée à la Haie-Sainte, était presque détruite ; les intrépides belges de la brigade Van Kluze jonchaient les seigles le long de la route de Nivelles ; il ne restait presque rien de ces grenadiers hollandais qui, en 1811, mêlés en Espagne à nos rangs, combattaient Wellington, et qui, en 1815, ralliés aux anglais, combattaient Napoléon. La perte en officiers était considérable. Lord Uxbridge, qui le lendemain fit enterrer sa jambe, avait le genou fracassé. Si, du côté des français, dans cette lutte des cuirassiers, Delord, Lhéritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers et Blancard étaient hors de combat, du côté des anglais, Alten était blessé, Barne était blessé, Delancey était tué, Van Meeren était tué, Ompteda était tué, tout l’état-major de Wellington était décimé, et l’Angleterre avait le pire partage dans ce sanglant équilibre. Le 2e régiment des gardes à pied avait perdu cinq lieutenants-colonels, quatre capitaines et trois enseignes ; le premier bataillon du 30e d’infanterie avait perdu vingt-quatre officiers et cent douze soldats ; le 79e montagnards avait vingt-quatre officiers blessés, dix-huit officiers morts, quatre cent cinquante soldats tués. Les hussards hanovriens de Cumberland, un régiment tout entier, ayant à sa tête son colonel Hacke, qui devait plus tard être jugé et cassé, avaient tourné bride devant la mêlée et étaient en fuite dans la forêt de Soignes, semant la déroute jusqu’à Bruxelles. Les charrois, les prolonges, les bagages, les fourgons pleins de blessés, voyant les français gagner du terrain et s’approcher de la forêt, s’y précipitaient ; les hollandais, sabrés par la cavalerie française, criaient : alarme ! De Vert-Coucou jusqu’à Groenendael, sur une longueur de près de deux lieues dans la direction de Bruxelles, il y avait, au dire des témoins qui existent encore, un encombrement de fuyards. Cette panique fut telle qu’elle gagna le prince de Condé à Malines et Louis XVIII à Gand. A l’exception de la faible réserve échelonnée derrière l’ambulance établie dans la ferme de Mont-Saint-Jean et des brigades Vivian et Vandeleur qui flanquaient l’aile gauche, Wellington n’avait plus de cavalerie. Nombre de batteries gisaient démontées. Ces faits sont avoués par Siborne ; et Pringle, exagérant le désastre, va jusqu’à dire que l’armée anglo-hollandaise était réduite à trente-quatre mille hommes. Le duc-de-fer demeurait calme, mais ses lèvres avaient blêmi. Le commissaire autrichien Vincent, le commissaire espagnol Alava, présents à la bataille dans l’état-major anglais, croyaient le duc perdu. A cinq heures, Wellington tira sa montre, et on l’entendit murmurer ce mot sombre : Blücher, ou la nuit !","Yet the English army was the sickest. The furious thrusts of those great iron-clad, steel-breasted squadrons had crushed the infantry. A few men around a flag marked the place of a regiment, such a battalion was now commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten's division, already so ill-treated at Haie-Sainte, was almost destroyed; the intrepid Belgians of the Van Kluze brigade strewed the rye along the road to Nivelles; Almost nothing remained of those Dutch grenadiers who, in 1811, mingled in Spain with our ranks, fought Wellington, and who, in 1815, rallied to the English, fought Napoleon. The loss in officers was considerable. Lord Uxbridge, who the next day had his leg buried, had a broken knee. If, on the side of the French, in this fight of the cuirassiers, Delord, Lessieu, Colbert, Dnop, Travers and Blancard were hors de combat, on the side of the English, Alten was wounded, Barne was wounded, Delancey was killed, Van Meeren was killed , Ompteda was killed, the whole staff of Wellington was decimated, and England had the worst share in this bloody balance. The 2nd Regiment of Foot Guards had lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains and three ensigns; the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost twenty-four officers and one hundred and twelve soldiers; the 79th Mountaineers had twenty-four officers wounded, eighteen officers dead, four hundred and fifty soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars of Cumberland, a whole regiment, led by Colonel Hacke, who was later to be tried and broken, had turned back in front of the melee and were on the run in the forest of Soignes, sowing the rout until Brussels. The carts, the extensions, the baggage, the vans full of wounded, seeing the French gaining ground and approaching the forest, rushed there; the Dutch, sabred by the French cavalry, shouted: alarm! From Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, over a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction of Brussels, there was, according to witnesses who still exist, a crowd of fugitives. This panic was such that it won over the Prince of Condé in Mechelen and Louis XVIII in Ghent. With the exception of the weak reserve echeloned behind the ambulance established in the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean and the brigades Vivian and Vandeleur which flanked the left wing, Wellington had no more cavalry. Many batteries lay disassembled. These facts are admitted by Siborne; and Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to say that the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men. The Duke of Iron remained calm, but his lips had gone white. The Austrian commissioner Vincent, the Spanish commissioner Alava, present at the battle in the English staff, believed the duke lost. At five o'clock, Wellington took out his watch, and he was heard to murmur this gloomy word: Blücher, or night!","Nevertheless, the English army was the more stricken of the two. The furious charges of those great squadrons with their metal cuirasses and steely breasts had pounded the infantry. A few men around a flag marked where a regiment had been posted, many a battalion was now commanded by a mere captain or lieutenant. Alten’s division, which had already suffered so badly at La Haie-Sainte, was almost destroyed. The intrepid Belgians of van Kluze’s brigade lay strewn on the rye fields along the Nivelles road. Almost nothing was left of those Dutch grenadiers who in 1811 fought alongside us in Spain against Wellington and in 1815 joined the English side to fight against Napoleon. The number of officers lost was considerable. Lord Uxbridge, who buried his leg the following day, had a shattered knee. While on the French side, in that assault by the cuirassiers, Delort, Lhéritier, Colbert, Donop, Travers and Blancard were put out of action, on the English side Alten was wounded, Barnes was wounded, Delancey was killed, van Merlen killed, Ompteda killed, the whole of Wellington’s general staff decimated, and England had the worst of it in that bloody deadlock. The 2nd Regiment of Foot Guards had lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains and three ensigns; the 1st Battalion of the 30th Infantry had lost twenty-four officers and one hundred and twelve soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost twenty-four officers wounded, eighteen officers dead, four hundred and fifty soldiers killed. The entire regiment of the Hanoverian Cumberland Hussars, commanded by Colonel Hake, who was later to be court-martialled and cashiered, had turned tail at the sight of the fighting and fled into the forest of Soignes, sowing panic all the way to Brussels. Transport vehicles, munitions trucks, baggage wagons, carts full of wounded casualties, seeing the French gaining ground and approaching the forest, made a dash for it. The Dutch who had been attacked by the French cavalry fuelled the alarm. From Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, over a distance of nearly five miles in the direction of Brussels, according to the testimony of eyewitnesses still alive today, the roads were choked with those fleeing. This panic was such that it spread to the Prince de Condé at Mechlin and to Louis XVIII at Ghent. Apart from the weak reserve force positioned behind the field hospital set up at Mont-St-Jean farm, and Vivian and Vandeleur’s brigades that flanked the left wing, Wellington had no more cavalry. A number of batteries lay dismounted. These facts are acknowledged by Siborne. And Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to say that the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men. The Iron Duke remained calm, but his lips had paled. The Austrian commissioner Vincent and the Spanish commissioner Álava, present at the battle on the English general staff, thought the duke was defeated. At five o’clock Wellington drew out his watch and was heard to murmur these grim words, ‘Night or Blücher!’","Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. The furious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men clustered round a flag marked the post of a regiment; such and such a battalion was commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten’s division, already so roughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, was almost destroyed; the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze’s brigade strewed the rye-fields all along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left of those Dutch grenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards in our ranks in 1811, fought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to the English standard, fought against Napoleon. The loss in officers was considerable. Lord Uxbridge, who had his leg buried on the following day, had his knee shattered. If, on the French side, in that tussle of the cuirassiers, Delort, l’Héritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, and Blancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was Alten wounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Ompteda killed, the whole of Wellington’s staff decimated, and England had the worse of it in that bloody scale. The second regiment of foot-guards had lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns; the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200 soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18 officers killed, 450 soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars of Cumberland, a whole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, who was destined to be tried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in the presence of the fray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing defeat all the way to Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, the baggage-wagons, the wagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that the French were gaining ground and approaching the forest, rushed headlong thither. The Dutch, mowed down by the French cavalry, cried, “Alarm!” From Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, for a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction of Brussels, according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who are still alive, the roads were encumbered with fugitives. This panic was such that it attacked the Prince de Condé at Mechlin, and Louis XVIII. at Ghent. With the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind the ambulance established at the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian’s and Vandeleur’s brigades, which flanked the left wing, Wellington had no cavalry left. A number of batteries lay unhorsed. These facts are attested by Siborne; and Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to say that the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men. The Iron Duke remained calm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, the Austrian commissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were present at the battle in the English staff, thought the Duke lost. At five o’clock Wellington drew out his watch, and he was heard to murmur these sinister words, “Blücher, or night!”","However, the English army was farthest gone. The furious onslaughts of these great squadrons with iron cuirasses and steel breastplates had ground up the infantry. A few men about a flag marked the place of a regiment; battalions were now commanded by captains or lieutenants. Alten’s division, already so cut up at La Haie Sainte, was almost destroyed; the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze’s brigade strewed the rye field along the Nivelles road; there were hardly any left of those Dutch grenadiers who, in 1811, joined to our ranks in Spain, fought against Wellington, and who, in 1815, rallied on the English side, fought against Napoleon. The loss in officers was heavy. Lord Uxbridge, who buried his leg next day, had a knee fractured. If, on the side of the French, in this struggle of the cuirassiers, Delord, I’Heritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, and Blancard were hors de combat, on the side of the English Alten was wounded, Barne was wounded, Delancey was killed, Van Meeren was killed, Ompteda was killed, the entire staff of Wellington was decimated, and England had the worst share in this balance of blood. The second regiment of foot guards had lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns; the first battalion of the thirtieth infantry had lost twenty-four officers and one hundred and twelve soldiers; the seventy-ninth Highlanders had twenty-four officers wounded, eighteen officers killed, and four hundred and fifty soldiers slain. Cumberland’s Hanoverian hussars, an entire regiment, having at its head Colonel Hacke, who was afterwards court-martialed and broken, had drawn rein before the fight, and were in flight in the Forest of Soignes, spreading the panic as far as Brussels. Carts, ammunition-waggons, baggage-waggons, ambulances full of wounded, seeing the French gain ground and approach the forest, fled precipitately; the Dutch, sabred by the French cavalry, cried murder! From Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, for a distance of nearly six miles in the direction towards Brussels, the roads, according to the testimony of witnesses still alive, were choked with fugitives. This panic was such that it reached the Prince of Condé at Malines, and Louis XVIII. at Ghent. With the exception of the small reserve drawn up in echelon behind the hospital established at the farm of Mont Saint Jean, and the brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on the flank of the left wing, Wellington’s cavalry was exhausted. A number of batteries lay dismounted. These facts are confessed by Siborne; and Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, says even that the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men.

"Après la destruction de la bande de Gaspard Bès qui avait infesté les gorges d’Ollioules, un de ses lieutenants, Cravatte, se réfugia dans la montagne.

On le vit à Jauziers d’abord, puis aux Tuiles. Il se cacha dans les cavernes du Joug-de-l’Aigle, et de là il descendait vers les hameaux et les villages par les ravins de l’Ubaye et de l’Ubayette. Il poussa même jusqu’à Embrun, pénétra une nuit dans la cathédrale et dévalisa la sacristie. Ses brigandages désolaient le pays. On mit la gendarmerie à ses trousses, mais en vain. Il échappait toujours ; quelquefois il résistait de vive force. C’était un hardi misérable. Au milieu de toute cette terreur, l’évêque arriva. Il faisait sa tournée au Chastelar.

"L’empereur alors, méditant la péripétie terrible, promena une dernière fois sa lunette sur tous les points du champ de bataille. Sa garde, l’arme au pied derrière lui, l’observait d’en bas avec une sorte de religion. Il songeait ; il examinait les versants, notait les pentes, scrutait le bouquet d’arbres, le carré de seigles, le sentier ; il semblait compter chaque buisson. Il regarda avec quelque fixité les barricades anglaises des deux chaussées, deux larges abatis d’arbres, celle de la chaussée de Genappe au-dessus de la Haie-Sainte, armée de deux canons, les seuls de toute l’artillerie anglaise qui vissent le fond du champ de bataille, et celle de la chaussée de Nivelles où étincelaient les bayonnettes hollandaises de la brigade Chassé. Il remarqua près de cette barricade la vieille chapelle de Saint-Nicolas peinte en blanc qui est à l’angle de la traverse vers Braine-l’Alleud. Il se pencha et parla à demi-voix au guide Lacoste. Le guide fit un signe de tête négatif, probablement perfide.","The Emperor then, meditating on the terrible incident, carried his telescope for the last time over all the points of the battlefield. His guard, at gunpoint behind him, watched him from below with a kind of religion. He thought; he examined the slopes, noted the slopes, scrutinized the clump of trees, the patch of rye, the path; he seemed to count every bush. He gazed with some fixity at the English barricades of the two causeways, two large tree-cuttings, that of the Chaussée de Genappe above the Haie-Sainte, armed with two guns, the only ones of all the English artillery which saw the background of the field of battle, and that of the roadway of Nivelles where sparkled the Dutch bayonets of the Chassé brigade. He noticed near this barricade the old chapel of Saint-Nicolas painted white, which is at the corner of the crossing towards Braine-l'Alleud. He leaned over and spoke in a low voice to the Lacoste guide. The guide nodded, probably treacherous.","Reflecting on this tremendous change of fortune, the emperor then swept his field-glasses one last time over every part of the battlefield. His Guard, standing at attention behind him, gazed up at him with a kind of veneration. He was turning things over in his mind. He examined the slopes, noted the inclines, scrutinized the clumps of trees, the patch of rye, the path. He seemed to be counting every bush. He gazed with some intentness at the two English barricades blocking the roads, two huge ramparts of felled trees: one on the Genappe road above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two cannons – of the entire English artillery these alone could see the floor of the battlefield; and one on the Nivelles road where the Dutch bayonets of Chassé’s brigade glinted. He noticed near this barricade the old white-painted chapel of St Nicolas that stands at the corner of the road that cuts across towards Braine-l’Alleud. He leaned over and spoke in an undertone to his guide Lacoste. The guide gave a negative, probably perfidious, shake of the head.","So the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, swept his glass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle.

He gazed with some intentness at the English barricades of the two highways,—two large abatis of trees, that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two cannon, the only ones out of all the English artillery which commanded the extremity of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelles where gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chassé’s brigade. Near this barricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white, which stands at the angle of the crossroad near Braine-l’Alleud; he bent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste. The guide made a negative sign with his head, which was probably perfidious.","The emperor then, contemplating this terrible turn of fortune, swept his glass for the last time over every point of the battle-field.

From a distance they would be taken for two immense serpents of steel stretching themselves towards the crest of the plateau. That ran through the battle like a prodigy."

"Il fit de la sorte un assez long chemin, regardant, appelant et criant, mais il ne rencontra plus personne.

Enfin, à un endroit où trois sentiers se croisaient, il s’arrêta. La lune s’était levée. Il promena sa vue au loin et appela une dernière fois : Petit-Gervais ! Petit-Gervais ! Petit-Gervais !

Petit-Gervais!’ His cry died in the mist without even raising an echo. He murmured again, but in a faint and almost inarticulate voice, ‘Petit-Gervais!’ That was his final effort. His legs suddenly gave way beneath him as though all at once some invisible power had crushed him with the weight of his own bad conscience. He collapsed on a large stone, exhausted, with his hands in his hair and his face in his lap, and he cried, ‘I’m a wretch!’","In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling, shouting, but he met no one.

The moon had risen. He strained his eyes in the distance, and called out once more “Petit Gervais! Petit Gervais! Petit Gervais!” His cries died away into the mist, without even awakening an echo. Again he murmured: “Petit Gervais!” but with a feeble, and almost inarticulate voice. That was his last effort; his knees suddenly bent under him, as if an invisible power overwhelmed him at a blow, with the weight of his bad conscience; he fell exhausted upon a great stone, his hands clenched in his hair, and his face on his knees, and exclaimed: “What a wretch I am!”"

The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.","THE BISHOP’S PALACE at D—— was contiguous to the hospital: the palace was a spacious and beautiful edifice, built of stone near the beginning of the last century by Monseigneur Henri Pujet, a doctor of theology of the Faculty of Paris, abbé of Simore, who was bishop of D—— in 1712. The palace was in truth a lordly dwelling: there was an air of grandeur about everything, the apartments of the bishop, the saloons, the chambers, the court of honour, which was very large, with arched walks after the antique Florentine style; and a garden planted with magnificent trees. In the dining hall was a long, superb gallery, which was level with the ground, opening upon the garden; Monseigneur Henri Pujet had given a grand banquet on the 29th of July, 1714, to Monseigneur Charles Brûlart de Genlis, archbishop, Prince d’Embrun, Antoine de Mesgrigny, capuchin, bishop of Grasse, Philippe de Vendôme, grand-prior de France, the Abbé de Saint Honoré de Lérins, François de Berton de Grillon, lord bishop of Vence, Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, lord bishop of Glandève, and Jean Soanen, priest of the oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, lord bishop of Senez; the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated the hall and this memorable date, July 29th, 1714, appeared in letters of gold on a white marble tablet."
"La fenêtre était large, suffisamment élevée, garnie de persiennes et de châssis à grands carreaux ; seulement ces grands carreaux avaient des blessures variées, à la fois cachées et trahies par un ingénieux bandage en papier, et les persiennes, disloquées et descellées, menaçaient plutôt les passants qu’elles ne gardaient les habitants. Les abat-jour horizontaux y manquaient çà et là et étaient naïvement remplacés par des planches clouées perpendiculairement ; si bien que la chose commençait en persienne et finissait en volet.","The window was wide, high enough, fitted with shutters and large-paned frames; only these large panes had various wounds, at once concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage, and the shutters, dislocated and unsealed, rather threatened the passers-by than they guarded the inhabitants.

Only, these large panes had suffered various injuries, at once concealed and betrayed by clever paper bandaging, and the louvred shutters, which were ramshackle and falling apart, were more a threat to passers-by than any protection for the occupants. Horizontal slats were missing here and there and had simply been replaced with boards nailed on flat, so that what had started out as a louvred shutter ended up as a solid one.","The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetian blinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large panes were suffering from various wounds, which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated and unpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants. The horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naïvely replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter.","The window was broad and of considerable height, with large panes in the sashes and provided with Venetian shutters; only the panes had received a variety of wounds which were at once concealed and made manifest by ingenious strips and bandages of paper, and the shutters were so broken and disjointed that they menaced the passers-by more than they shielded the occupants of the dwelling. The horizontal slats were lacking, here and there, and had been very simply replaced with boards nailed across, so that what had been a Venetian, in the first instance, ended as a regular close shutter."

"Les bernardines-bénédictines de cette obédience font maigre toute l’année, jeûnent le carême et beaucoup d’autres jours qui leur sont spéciaux, se relèvent dans leur premier sommeil depuis une heure du matin jusqu’à trois pour lire le bréviaire et chanter matines, couchent dans des draps de serge en toute saison et sur la paille, n’usent point de bains, n’allument jamais de feu, se donnent la discipline tous les vendredis, observent la règle du silence, ne se parlent qu’aux récréations, lesquelles sont très courtes, et portent des chemises de bure pendant six mois, du 14 septembre, qui est l’exaltation de la sainte-croix, jusqu’à Pâques. Ces six mois sont une modération, la règle dit toute l’année ; mais cette chemise de bure, insupportable dans les chaleurs de l’été, produisait des fièvres et des spasmes nerveux. Il a fallu en restreindre l’usage. Même avec cet adoucissement, le 14 septembre, quand les religieuses mettent cette chemise, elles ont trois ou quatre jours de fièvre. Obéissance, pauvreté, chasteté, stabilité sous clôture ; voilà leurs vœux, fort aggravés par la règle.","The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience go lean all year round, fast Lent and many other days that are special to them, get up in their first sleep from one o'clock in the morning until three to read the breviary and sing matins , sleep in serge sheets in all seasons and on straw, do not use baths, never light a fire, give themselves discipline every Friday, observe the rule of silence, only talk to each other at recreation , which are very short, and wear homespun shirts for six months, from September 14, which is the exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter. These six months are a moderation, the rule says the whole year; but this homespun shirt, unbearable in the heat of summer, produced fevers and nervous spasms. Its use had to be restricted. Even with this alleviation, on September 14, when the nuns put on this shirt, they have three or four days of fever. Obedience, poverty, chastity, stability under enclosure; these are their wishes, greatly aggravated by the rule.","The Bernardine-Benedictines of this obedience abstain from meat all year round, fast in Lent and on many other days of special significance to them, rise from their first sleep to read their breviary and sing matins from one o’clock until three o’clock in the morning, sleep on straw and between serge sheets in all seasons, do not take baths, never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule of silence, speak to each other only during recreation periods, which are very brief; and for six months wear homespun woollen chemises, from the fourteenth of September, feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter. These six months are a mitigation; the rule says all year round, but this homespun woollen chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, would cause fevers and nervous spasms. Its usage had to be restricted. Even with this relaxation, when the nuns don the chemise on the fourteenth of September they suffer three or four days of fever. Obedience, poverty, chastity and stability – these are their vows, made more onerous by the extreme harshness of their rule.","The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round, abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are peculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three o’clock in the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep in all seasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the bath, never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule of silence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours, which are very brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year, from September 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter. These six months are a modification: the rule says all the year, but this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, produced fevers and nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted.

"Il s’approcha de plusieurs groupes et il écouta ce qu’on disait. Le rôle de la session étant très chargé, le président avait indiqué pour ce même jour deux affaires simples et courtes. On avait commencé par l’infanticide, et maintenant on en était au forçat, au récidiviste, au « cheval de retour ». Cet homme avait volé des pommes, mais cela ne paraissait pas bien prouvé ; ce qui était prouvé, c’est qu’il avait été déjà aux galères à Toulon. C’est ce qui faisait son affaire mauvaise. Du reste, l’interrogatoire de l’homme était terminé et les dépositions des témoins ; mais il y avait encore les plaidoiries de l’avocat et le réquisitoire du ministère public ; cela ne devait guère finir avant minuit. L’homme serait probablement condamné ; l’avocat général était très bon, ― et ne manquait pas ses accusés ; ― c’était un garçon d’esprit qui faisait des vers.","He approached several groups and listened to what they were saying. The schedule for the session being very heavy, the President had indicated for that same day two simple and short matters. We had started with infanticide, and now we were at the convict, the recidivist, the “returning horse”. This man had stolen apples, but it didn't seem well proven; what was proven was that he had already been in the galleys at Toulon. That was what made his business bad. For the rest, the interrogation of the man was over and the depositions of the witnesses; but there were still the arguments of the lawyer and the indictment of the public prosecutor; it was hardly to end before midnight. The man would probably be doomed; the Advocate General was very good, ―and did not miss his defendants; ―He was a clever boy who wrote poetry.","He went and stood close to several groups and listened to what was being said. With a very full court roll, the presiding judge had selected for that same day two simple, straightforward cases. They had begun with the infanticide and now they were dealing with the ex-convict, the re-offender, the ‘old lag’. This man had stolen some apples, though apparently this had not been proved conclusively. What had been proved was that he had already served a penal sentence at Toulon. This was what made things look bad for him. The questioning of the defendant was now ended and the witnesses had testified, but still to come was the defence counsel and public prosecutor’s summing-up. It was unlikely to be over before midnight. The man would probably be found guilty. The public prosecutor was very able and did not fail to secure convictions. He was a witty fellow, who wrote verse.","He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying.

It was that which lent a bad aspect to his case. However, the man’s examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed, but the lawyer’s plea, and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be finished before midnight. The man would probably be condemned; the attorney-general was very clever, and never missed his culprits; he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses.","He approached several groups and listened to their talk.

"Wellington ajouta à ce centre une brigade de Chassé, ôtée à l’aile droite, et une brigade de Wincke, ôtée à l’aile gauche, plus la division Clinton.

Cela lui mit sous la main vingt-six bataillons. L’aile droite, comme dit Charras, fut rabattue derrière le centre.

This fighting went on for two hours.","It was no longer a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, a dizzy transport of souls and courage, a hurricane of lightning swords. In an instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred. Fuller, their lieutenant-colonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up with the lancers and Lefebvre-Desnouettes’s light-horse. The plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean was captured, recaptured, captured again. The cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry; or, to put it more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout collared each other without releasing the other. The squares still held firm. There were a dozen assaults. Ney had four horses killed under him. Half the cuirassiers remained on the plateau. This conflict lasted two hours.","It was no longer a conflict, it was a darkness, a fury, a giddy vortex of souls and courage, a hurricane of sword-flashes. In an instant the fourteen hundred horse guards were but eight hundred; Fuller, their lieutenant, fell dead. Ney rushed up with the lancers and chasseurs of Lefebvre-Desnouettes. The plateau of Mont Saint Jean was taken, retaken, taken again.

There were twelve assaults. Ney had four horses killed under him. Half of the cuirassiers lay on the plateau. This struggle lasted two hours."

"Quoiqu’il ne fût plus jeune, on contait qu’il était d’une force prodigieuse. Il offrait un coup de main à qui en avait besoin, relevait un cheval, poussait à une roue embourbée, arrêtait par les cornes un taureau échappé. Il avait toujours ses poches pleines de monnaie en sortant et vides en rentrant. Quand il passait dans un village, les marmots déguenillés couraient joyeusement après lui et l’entouraient comme une nuée de moucherons.","Although he was no longer young, it was said that he was prodigiously strong.

When he passed through a village, the ragged brats ran happily after him and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats.","Although he was not a young man any more, stories were told of his remarkable strength. He would lend a hand to anyone in need of it, lift a horse, push a wheel stuck in the mud, or stop a runaway bull by the horns.

Whenever he passed through a village, ragged urchins ran gleefully after him and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats.","Although he was no longer young, it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was in need of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, or stopped a runaway bull by the horns.

"Aller à son secours, c’était courir un risque effrayant. Aucun des matelots, tous pêcheurs de la côte nouvellement levés pour le service, n’osait s’y aventurer. Cependant le malheureux gabier se fatiguait ; on ne pouvait voir son angoisse sur son visage, mais on distinguait dans tous ses membres son épuisement. Ses bras se tordaient dans un tiraillement horrible. Chaque effort qu’il faisait pour remonter ne servait qu’à augmenter les oscillations du faux marchepied. Il ne criait pas de peur de perdre de la force. On n’attendait plus que la minute où il lâcherait la corde, et par instants toutes les têtes se détournaient afin de ne pas le voir passer. Il y a des moments où un bout de corde, une perche, une branche d’arbre, c’est la vie même, et c’est une chose affreuse de voir un être vivant s’en détacher et tomber comme un fruit mûr.","To go to his aid was to run a fearful risk.

However, the unfortunate topman was getting tired; you couldn't see his anguish on his face, but you could see his exhaustion in all his limbs. His arms twisted in a horrible tug. Every effort he made to get back up only served to increase the oscillations of the false running board. He did not cry out for fear of losing strength. We were only waiting for the minute when he would let go of the rope, and at times all heads turned away so as not to see him pass. There are times when a piece of rope, a pole, a branch of a tree is life itself, and it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach from it and fall like a ripe fruit.","To go to his aid was to take a terrifying risk. Not one of the sailors, all fishermen from along the coast recently levied for service, dared venture it. Meanwhile, the poor yardman was tiring. The anguish on his face could not be seen but his exhaustion showed in every limb. His arms were horribly stretched by his own weight. Every effort he made to hoist himself up served only to make the footrope swing more wildly. He did not shout, for fear of wasting his strength.

"Retirer Waterloo à Wellington et à Blücher, est-ce ôter quelque chose à l’Angleterre et à l’Allemagne ? Non. Ni cette illustre Angleterre ni cette auguste Allemagne ne sont en question dans le problème de Waterloo. Grâce au ciel, les peuples sont grands en dehors des lugubres aventures de l’épée. Ni l’Allemagne, ni l’Angleterre, ni la France, ne tiennent dans un fourreau. Dans cette époque où Waterloo n’est qu’un cliquetis de sabres, au-dessus de Blücher l’Allemagne a Gœthe et au-dessus de Wellington l’Angleterre a Byron. Un vaste lever d’idées est propre à notre siècle, et dans cette aurore l’Angleterre et l’Allemagne ont une lueur magnifique. Elles sont majestueuses parce qu’elles pensent. L’élévation de niveau qu’elles apportent à la civilisation leur est intrinsèque ; il vient d’elles-mêmes, et non d’un accident. Ce qu’elles ont d’agrandissement au dix-neuvième siècle n’a point Waterloo pour source. Il n’y a que les peuples barbares qui aient des crues subites après une victoire. C’est la vanité passagère des torrents enflés d’un orage. Les peuples civilisés, surtout au temps où nous sommes, ne se haussent ni ne s’abaissent par la bonne ou mauvaise fortune d’un capitaine. Leur poids spécifique dans le genre humain résulte de quelque chose de plus qu’un combat. Leur honneur, Dieu merci, leur dignité, leur lumière, leur génie, ne sont pas des numéros que les héros et les conquérants, ces joueurs, peuvent mettre à la loterie des batailles. Souvent bataille perdue, progrès conquis. Moins de gloire, plus de liberté. Le tambour se tait, la raison prend la parole. C’est le jeu à qui perd gagne. Parlons donc de Waterloo froidement des deux côtés. Rendons au hasard ce qui est au hasard et à Dieu ce qui est à Dieu. Qu’est-ce que Waterloo ? Une victoire ? Non. Un quine.","To take Waterloo away from Wellington and Blücher, is that taking something away from England and Germany? No. Neither this illustrious England nor this august Germany is in question in the problem of Waterloo. Thank heaven the peoples are great apart from the lugubrious adventures of the sword. Neither Germany, nor England, nor France fit in a sheath. In this era when Waterloo is only a clash of sabers, above Blücher Germany has Goethe and above Wellington England has Byron. A vast dawn of ideas is peculiar to our century, and in this dawn England and Germany have a magnificent gleam. They are majestic because they think. The elevation they bring to civilization is intrinsic to them; it comes from themselves, and not from an accident. Their enlargement in the nineteenth century has no source in Waterloo. Only barbarian peoples have flash floods after a victory. It is the fleeting vanity of the swollen torrents of a storm. Civilized peoples, especially in our time, neither rise nor fall by the good or bad luck of a captain. Their specific weight in the human race results from something more than a fight. Their honor, thank God, their dignity, their light, their genius, are not numbers that heroes and conquerors, these players, can put in the battle lottery. Often a battle lost, progress won. Less glory, more freedom. The drum is silent, reason speaks. It's a loser wins game. So let's talk about Waterloo coldly on both sides. Let us give to chance what is to chance and to God what is God's. What is Waterloo? A victory ? No. A quine.","To take Waterloo away from Wellington and Blücher, is that to deprive England and Germany of anything? No. Neither illustrious England nor majestic Germany is called into question by the problem of Waterloo. Thank heavens, nations are great regardless of the grim fortunes of war. Neither England, nor Germany, nor France is defined by the scabbard. During a period when Waterloo is no more than a clatter of sabres, over and beyond Blücher Germany has Goethe; over and beyond Wellington England has Byron. A great intellectual dawn distinguishes our century, and in this advent of light England and Germany have their own magnificent radiance. They have majesty because they think. The advancement they bring to civilization is intrinsic to them. It derives from themselves and not from an accident. Their greater power and influence in the nineteenth century are not founded on Waterloo. It is only barbarous peoples that suddenly flourish after a victory, such being the fleeting vanity of torrents swollen by a storm. Civilized peoples, especially in our own times, neither rise nor fall by the good or bad fortune of a leader. Their specific weight within the human race results from something more than a conflict. Their honour, thank God, their dignity, their understanding, their genius, are not numbers that those gamblers the heroes and conquerors can throw into the lottery of battle. Often a battle lost is progress gained. Less glory, more freedom. The drum falls silent, reason speaks. It is the game of loser wins. So let us discuss Waterloo dispassionately from both sides. Let us render to chance what is due to chance, and to God what is due to God. What is Waterloo? A victory? No. A lottery.","If we take Waterloo from Wellington and Blücher, do we thereby deprive England and Germany of anything? No. Neither that illustrious England nor that august Germany enter into the problem of Waterloo. Thank Heaven, nations are great, independently of the lugubrious feats of the sword. Neither England, nor Germany, nor France is contained in a scabbard. At this epoch when Waterloo is only a clashing of swords, above Blücher, Germany has Schiller; above Wellington, England has Byron. A vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century, and in that aurora England and Germany have a magnificent radiance. They are majestic because they think. The elevation of level which they contribute to civilization is intrinsic with them; it proceeds from themselves and not from an accident. The aggrandizement which they have brought to the nineteenth century has not Waterloo as its source. It is only barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory. That is the temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm. Civilized people, especially in our day, are neither elevated nor abased by the good or bad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravity in the human species results from something more than a combat. Their honor, thank God! their dignity, their intelligence, their genius, are not numbers which those gamblers, heroes and conquerors, can put in the lottery of battles. Often a battle is lost and progress is conquered. There is less glory and more liberty. The drum holds its peace; reason takes the word. It is a game in which he who loses wins. Let us, therefore, speak of Waterloo coldly from both sides. Let us render to chance that which is due to chance, and to God that which is due to God. What is Waterloo? A victory? No. The winning number in the lottery.","Does taking away Waterloo from Wellington and from Blücher, detract anything from England and Germany? No. Neither illustrious England nor august Germany is in question in the problem of Waterloo. Thank heaven, nations are great aside from the dismal chances of the sword. Neither Germany, nor England, nor France, is held in a scabbard. At this day when Waterloo is only a clicking of sabres, above Blücher, Germany has Goethe, and above Wellington, England has Byron. A vast uprising of ideas is peculiar to our century, and in this aurora England and Germany have a magnificent share. They are majestic because they think. The higher plane which they bring to civilisation is intrinsic to them; it comes from themselves, and not from an accident. The advancement which they have made in the nineteenth century does not spring from Waterloo. It is only barbarous nations who have a sudden growth after a victory. It is the fleeting vanity of the streamlet swelled by the storm. Civilised nations, especially in our times, are not exalted nor abased by the good or bad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravity in the human race results from something more than a combat. Their honour, thank God, their dignity, their light, their genius, are not numbers that heroes and conquerors, those gamblers, can cast into the lottery of battles. Oftentimes a battle lost is progress attained. Less glory, more liberty. The drum is silent, reason speaks. It is the game at which he who loses, gains. Let us speak, then, coolly of Waterloo on both sides. Let us render unto Fortune the things that are Fortune’s, and unto God the things that are God’s. What is Waterloo? A victory? No. A prize."

"C’étaient de ces natures naines qui, si quelque feu sombre les chauffe par hasard, deviennent facilement monstrueuses. Il y avait dans la femme le fond d’une brute et dans l’homme l’étoffe d’un gueux. Tous deux étaient au plus haut degré susceptibles de l’espèce de hideux progrès qui se fait dans le sens du mal. Il existe des âmes écrevisses reculant continuellement vers les ténèbres, rétrogradant dans la vie plutôt qu’elles n’y avancent, employant l’expérience à augmenter leur difformité, empirant sans cesse, et s’empreignant de plus en plus d’une noirceur croissante. Cet homme et cette femme étaient de ces âmes-là.","They were of those dwarf natures which, if some gloomy fire by chance warms them, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman the heart of a brute and in the man the stuff of a beggar. Both were in the highest degree susceptible to the kind of hideous progress that is made in the direction of evil. There are crayfish souls continually recoiling into darkness, retrograding in life rather than advancing in it, using experience to increase their deformity, ever getting worse, and becoming more and more imbued with growing blackness. . This man and this woman were of those souls.","They were of that stunted nature that easily turns monstrous if some dark passion is by chance kindled in them.

There are souls like lobsters, continually retreating into the shadows, retrogressing rather than advancing through life, using experience to add to their monstrosity, becoming ever more wicked and ever more imbued with an intensifying foulness. This man and this woman were such souls.","They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to warm them up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a substratum of the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard.

"Il félicita le défenseur de sa « loyauté », et profita habilement de cette loyauté. Il atteignit l’accusé par toutes les concessions que l’avocat avait faites. L’avocat semblait accorder que l’accusé était Jean Valjean. Il en prit acte. Cet homme était donc Jean Valjean. Ceci était acquis à l’accusation et ne pouvait plus se contester. Ici, par une habile antonomase, remontant aux sources et aux causes de la criminalité, l’avocat général tonna contre l’immoralité de l’école romantique, alors à son aurore sous le nom d’école satanique que lui avaient décerné les critiques de la Quotidienne et de l’Oriflamme ; il attribua, non sans vraisemblance, à l’influence de cette littérature perverse le délit de Champmathieu, ou pour mieux dire, de Jean Valjean. Ces considérations épuisées, il passa à Jean Valjean lui-même. Qu’était-ce que Jean Valjean ? Description de Jean Valjean. Un monstre vomi, etc. Le modèle de ces sortes de descriptions est dans le récit de Théramène, lequel n’est pas utile à la tragédie, mais rend tous les jours de grands services à l’éloquence judiciaire. L’auditoire et les jurés « frémirent ». La description achevée, l’avocat général reprit, dans un mouvement oratoire fait pour exciter au plus haut point le lendemain matin l’enthousiasme du Journal de la Préfecture : ― Et c’est un pareil homme, etc., etc., etc., vagabond, mendiant, sans moyens d’existence, etc., etc., ― accoutumé par sa vie passée aux actions coupables et peu corrigé par son séjour au bagne, comme le prouve le crime commis sur Petit-Gervais, etc., etc., ― c’est un homme pareil qui, trouvé sur la voie publique en flagrant délit de vol, à quelques pas d’un mur escaladé, tenant encore à la main l’objet volé, nie le flagrant délit, le vol, l’escalade, nie tout, nie jusqu’à son nom, nie jusqu’à son identité ! Outre cent autres preuves sur lesquelles nous ne revenons pas, quatre témoins le reconnaissent, Javert, l’intègre inspecteur de police Javert, et trois de ses anciens compagnons d’ignominie, les forçats Brevet, Chenildieu et Cochepaille. Qu’oppose-t-il à cette unanimité foudroyante ? Il nie. Quel endurcissement ! Vous ferez justice, messieurs les jurés, etc., etc. ― Pendant que l’avocat général parlait, l’accusé écoutait, la bouche ouverte, avec une sorte d’étonnement où il entrait bien quelque admiration. Il était évidemment surpris qu’un homme pût parler comme cela. De temps en temps, aux moments les plus « énergiques » du réquisitoire, dans ces instants où l’éloquence, qui ne peut se contenir, déborde dans un flux d’épithètes flétrissantes et enveloppe l’accusé comme un orage, il remuait lentement la tête de droite à gauche et de gauche à droite, sorte de protestation triste et muette dont il se contentait depuis le commencement des débats. Deux ou trois fois les spectateurs placés le plus près de lui l’entendirent dire à demi-voix : ― Voilà ce que c’est, de n’avoir pas demandé à M. Baloup ! ― L’avocat général fit remarquer au jury cette attitude hébétée, calculée évidemment, qui dénotait, non l’imbécillité, mais l’adresse, la ruse, l’habitude de tromper la justice, et qui mettait dans tout son jour « la profonde perversité » de cet homme. Il termina en faisant ses réserves pour l’affaire Petit-Gervais, et en réclamant une condamnation sévère.","He praised the defender for his ""loyalty"", and skillfully took advantage of that loyalty. He reached the accused by all the concessions that the lawyer had made. The lawyer seemed to agree that the accused was Jean Valjean. He took notice. This man was therefore Jean Valjean. This was acquired by the prosecution and could no longer be disputed. Here, by a skilful antonomasia, going back to the sources and causes of criminality, the advocate general thundered against the immorality of the romantic school, then at its dawn under the name of satanic school which the critics of the Daily and the Oriflamme; he attributed, not without probability, to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or to put it better, of Jean Valjean. These considerations exhausted, he passed to Jean Valjean himself. Who was Jean Valjean? Description by Jean Valjean. A vomited monster, etc. The model for these sorts of descriptions is in the narrative of Theramenes, which is not useful for tragedy, but every day renders great service to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jurors “shuddered”. The description finished, the Advocate General resumed, in an oratorical movement calculated to excite the enthusiasm of the Journal de la Préfecture to the highest degree the following morning: “And he is such a man, etc., etc., etc. , vagabond, beggar, without means of existence, etc., etc., ―accustomed by his past life to culpable actions and little corrected by his stay in prison, as evidenced by the crime committed on Petit-Gervais, etc., etc. ., ―it is such a man who, found on the public highway in flagrante delicto theft, a few steps from a climbed wall, still holding the stolen object in his hand, denies the flagrante delicto, the theft, the escalation, denies everything, denies even his name, denies even his identity! In addition to a hundred other proofs on which we will not return, four witnesses recognize him, Javert, the honest police inspector Javert, and three of his former companions in ignominy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu and Cochepaille. What does he oppose to this overwhelming unanimity? He denies. What toughness! You will do justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. “While the Advocate General was speaking, the accused listened, his mouth hanging open, with a kind of astonishment into which there certainly entered some admiration. He was obviously surprised that a man could talk like that. From time to time, at the most ""energetic"" moments of the indictment, in those moments when eloquence, which cannot be contained, overflows in a stream of withering epithets and envelops the accused like a storm, he would slowly stir the his head from right to left and from left to right, a sort of sad and mute protest with which he had contented himself since the beginning of the debates. Two or three times the spectators placed nearest to him heard him say in an undertone: ""That's what it is, not to have asked M. Baloup!"" ""The Advocate General pointed out to the jury this dazed attitude, evidently calculated, which denoted, not imbecility, but skill, cunning, the habit of deceiving justice, and which brought into full view ""the profound perversity"" of this man. He ended by making his reservations about the Petit-Gervais affair, and by demanding a severe condemnation.","He congratulated the defence counsel on his ‘fairness’, and skilfully exploited this fairness. With every concession made by his lawyer, he struck a blow against the defendant. The lawyer seemed to admit the defendant was Jean Valjean. He took cognizance of the fact. So this man was Jean Valjean. The point had been conceded to the prosecution and could no longer be disputed. Here, in an adroit use of a rhetorical device, in tracing back the sources and causes of crime the public prosecutor thundered against the immorality of the then budding Romantic school, referring to it as ‘the satanic school’, a term used by the critics of L’Oriflamme and La Quotidienne; not wholly unreasonably, he attributed to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or to be more accurate, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted these reflections, he moved on to Jean Valjean himself. Who was this Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a spewed-up monster, and so on. The model for descriptions of this sort is contained in Théramène’s speech, which is of no use to tragedy but every day renders great service to judicial eloquence. The court and the jury ‘shuddered’. His description concluded, the public prosecutor went on with an oratorial flourish calculated to excite the utmost enthusiasm in next morning’s Journal de la Préfecture: ‘And it is such a man – a vagrant, a beggar, with no means of existence … inured by a life of crime and little reformed by his sentence of penal servitude, as proved by the offence committed against Petit-Gervais … caught red-handed on the public highway, committing theft, a few paces from a scaled wall, still clutching the stolen object – it is such a man who denies the obvious crime, the theft, the climbing of the wall, denies everything, denies even his own name, denies his identity! In addition to countless other proofs that we shall not hark back to, four witnesses recognize him – Javert, the upright inspector of police Javert, and three of his former companions in ignominy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu and Cochepaille. How does he counter this damning unanimity? With denial. What a hardened criminal! You will deal justly, gentlemen of the jury …’ While the public prosecutor spoke, the accused listened open-mouthed with a kind of amazement in which there was a considerable element of admiration. He was obviously surprised that a man should be capable of talking like this. From time to time, at the most vigorous moments of the prosecutor’s indictment, at those moments when eloquence, unable to contain itself, spills over in a flood of withering epithets and invests the accused like a storm, he slowly moved his head from left to right and from right to left, a sad and silent form of protest with which he had contented himself since the start of the proceedings. Two or three times the spectators seated nearest to him heard him say to himself, ‘This is what comes of not having asked Monsieur Baloup.’ The public prosecutor directed the attention of the jury to this vacant attitude, which was obviously calculated and an indication not of imbecility but of guile, cunning, the habit of eluding justice, and revealing in all its clarity the ‘profound perversity’ of this man. He concluded by reserving the right to press charges relating to the Petit-Gervais incident and demanding a harsh sentence.","He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his “loyalty,” and skilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So this man was Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed. Here, by means of a clever autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime, the district-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic school, then dawning under the name of the Satanic school, which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the Quotidienne and the Oriflamme; he attributed, not without some probability, to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or rather, to speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted these considerations, he passed on to Jean Valjean himself. Who was this Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster spewed forth, etc. The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of Théramène, which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jury “shuddered.” The description finished, the district-attorney resumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day: And it is such a man, etc., etc. , etc., vagabond, beggar, without means of existence, etc. , etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds, and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by the crime committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc. ; it is such a man, caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from a wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the object stolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denies everything; denies even his own identity! In addition to a hundred other proofs, to which we will not recur, four witnesses recognize him—Javert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three of his former companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille. What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity? His denial. What obduracy! You will do justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney was speaking, the accused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in which some admiration was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised that a man could talk like that. From time to time, at those “energetic” moments of the prosecutor’s speech, when eloquence which cannot contain itself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the accused like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right to left and from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. Two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice, “That is what comes of not having asked M. Baloup.” The district-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid attitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, but craft, skill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in all its nakedness the “profound perversity” of this man. He ended by making his reserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severe sentence.","He complimented the counsel for his “frankness,” of which he shrewdly took advantage. He attacked the accused through all the concessions which his counsel had made. The counsel seemed to admit that the accused was Jean Valjean. He accepted the admission. This man then was Jean Valjean. This fact was conceded to the prosecution, and could be no longer contested. Here, by an adroit autonomasia, going back to the sources and causes of crime, the prosecuting attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic school—then in its dawn, under the name of the Satanic school, conferred upon it by the critics of the Quotidienne and the Oriflamme; and he attributed, not without plausibility, to the influence of this perverse literature, the crime of Champmathieu, or rather of Jean Valjean. These considerations exhausted, he passed to Jean Valjean himself. Who was Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster vomited, etc. The model of all such descriptions may be found in the story of Théramène, which as tragedy is useless, but which does great service in judicial eloquence every day. The auditory and the jury “shuddered.” This description finished, the prosecuting attorney resumed with an oratorical burst, designed to excite the enthusiasm of the Journal de la Préfecture to the highest pitch next morning. “And it is such a man,” etc., etc. A vagabond, a mendicant, without means of existence, etc., etc. Accustomed through his existence to criminal acts and profiting little by his past life in the galleys, as is proved by the crime committed upon Petit Gervais, etc., etc. It is such a man who, found on the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from a wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the subject of his crime, denies the act in which he is caught, denies the theft, denies the escalade, denies everything, denies even his name, denies even his identity! Besides a hundred other proofs, to which we will not return, he is identified by four witnesses—Javert—the incorruptible inspector of police. Javert—and three of his former companions in disgrace, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille. What has he to oppose to this overwhelming unanimity? His denial. What depravity! You will do justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. While the prosecuting attorney was speaking the accused listened opened-mouthed, with a sort of astonishment, not unmingled with admiration. He was evidently surprised that a man could speak so well. From time to time, at the most “forcible” parts of the argument, at those moments when eloquence, unable to contain itself, overflows in a stream of withering epithets, and surrounds the prisoner like a tempest, he slowly moved his head from right to left, and from left to right—a sort of sad, mute protest, with which he contented himself from the beginning of the argument. Two or three times the spectators nearest him heard him say in a low tone: “This all comes from not asking for Monsieur Baloup!” The prosecuting attorney pointed out to the jury this air of stupidity, which was evidently put on, and which denoted, not imbecility, but address, artifice, and the habit of deceiving justice, and which showed in its full light the “deep-rooted perversity” of the man. He concluded by reserving entirely the Petit Gervais affair, and demanding a sentence to the full extent of the law."

Il y eut une pause.,There was a pause.,There was a pause.,A pause ensued.,There was a pause.
"Vers quatre heures, la situation de l’armée anglaise était grave. Le prince d’Orange commandait le centre, Hill, l’aile droite, Picton l’aile gauche. Le prince d’Orange, éperdu et intrépide, criait aux hollando-belges : Nassau ! Brunswick ! jamais en arrière ! Hill, affaibli, venait s’adosser à Wellington, Picton était mort. Dans la même minute où les anglais avaient enlevé aux français le drapeau du 105e de ligne, les français avaient tué aux anglais le général Picton d’une balle à travers la tête. La bataille, pour Wellington, avait deux points d’appui, Hougomont et la Haie-Sainte ; Hougomont tenait encore, mais brûlait ; la Haie-Sainte était prise. Du bataillon allemand qui la défendait, quarante-deux hommes seulement survivaient ; tous les officiers, moins cinq, étaient morts ou pris. Trois mille combattants s’étaient massacrés dans cette grange. Un sergent des gardes anglaises, le premier boxeur de l’Angleterre, réputé par ses compagnons invulnérable, y avait été tué par un petit tambour français. Baring était délogé, Alten était sabré. Plusieurs drapeaux étaient perdus, dont un de la division Alten, et un du bataillon de Lunebourg porté par un prince de la famille de Deux-Ponts. Les écossais gris n’existaient plus ; les gros dragons de Ponsomby étaient hachés. Cette vaillante cavalerie avait plié sous les lanciers de Bro et sous les cuirassiers de Travers ; de douze cents chevaux il en restait six cents ; des trois lieutenants-colonels, deux étaient à terre, Hamilton blessé, Mater tué. Ponsomby était tombé, troué de sept coups de lance. Gordon était mort, Marsh était mort. Deux divisions, la cinquième et la sixième, étaient détruites.","Around four o'clock the situation of the English army was serious. The Prince of Orange commanded the centre, Hill the right wing, Picton the left wing. The Prince of Orange, distraught and intrepid, shouted to the Dutch-Belgians: Nassau! Braunschweig! Never behind ! Hill, weakened, leaned against Wellington, Picton was dead. In the same minute that the English had taken the flag of the 105th line from the French, the French had killed General Picton from the English with a bullet through the head. The battle, for Wellington, had two points of support, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte; Hougomont was still holding out, but was burning; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of the German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived; all the officers, less five, were dead or taken. Three thousand combatants were massacred in this barn. A sergeant of the English guards, the first boxer in England, reputed by his companions to be invulnerable, had been killed there by a small French drummer. Baring was dislodged, Alten was sabered. Several flags were lost, including one of Alten's division, and one of the Lüneburg battalion carried by a prince of the Deux-Ponts family. Gray Scots no longer existed; the big dragons of Ponsomby were chopped. This valiant cavalry had yielded under Bro's lancers and Travers's cuirassiers; of twelve hundred horses there remained six hundred; of the three lieutenant-colonels, two were on the ground, Hamilton wounded, Mater killed. Ponsomby had fallen, pierced by seven spear thrusts. Gordon was dead, Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifth and the sixth, were destroyed.","Around four o’clock the situation for the English army was serious. The Prince of Orange commanded the centre, Hill the right wing, Picton the left. Fervent and intrepid, the Prince of Orange shouted to the Dutch-Belgians, ‘Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!’ Weakened, Hill had rallied to Wellington. Picton was dead. At the very moment the British captured from the French the colours of the 105th Line Infantry, the French killed General Picton with a bullet through the head. For Wellington, the battle had two key positions, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte. Hougomont still held out but was in flames; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of the German battalion defending it, only forty-two men survived. All but five officers were dead or captured. Three thousand combatants had been massacred in that barnyard. A sergeant of the English Guards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed by his companions to be invulnerable, was killed there by a little French drummer-boy. Baring was dislodged, Alten sabred. Several flags had been lost, one from Alten’s division and one from the Lüneburg battalion that was being carried by a prince of the Deux-Ponts family. The Scots Greys were no more; Ponsonby’s heavy dragoons had been hacked to pieces. That valiant cavalry were overwhelmed by Bro’s lancers and Travers’s cuirassiers; of twelve hundred horses six hundred were left; of three lieutenant-colonels two had been brought down, Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, stuck through with a lance seven times. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifth and the sixth, were destroyed.","Towards four o’clock the condition of the English army was serious. The Prince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing, Picton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid, shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: “Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!” Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington; Picton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured from the French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed the English general, Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battle had, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte; Hougomont still held out, but was on fire; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of the German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived; all the officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three thousand combatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the English Guards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by his companions, had been killed there by a little French drummer-boy. Baring had been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been lost, one from Alten’s division, and one from the battalion of Lunenburg, carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no longer existed; Ponsonby’s great dragoons had been hacked to pieces. That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneath the cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, six hundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on the earth,—Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled by seven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifth and the sixth, had been annihilated.","the situation of the English army was serious. The Prince of Orange commanded the centre, Hill the right wing, Picton the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid, cried to the Hollando-Belgians: Nassau! Brunswick! never retreat!

"A peine eut-elle fait cent pas qu’elle s’arrêta encore, et se remit à se gratter la tête. Maintenant, c’était la Thénardier qui lui apparaissait ; la Thénardier hideuse avec sa bouche d’hyène et la colère flamboyante dans les yeux. L’enfant jeta un regard lamentable en avant et en arrière. Que faire ? que devenir ? où aller ? Devant elle le spectre de la Thénardier ; derrière elle tous les fantômes de la nuit et des bois. Ce fut devant la Thénardier qu’elle recula. Elle reprit le chemin de la source et se mit à courir. Elle sortit du village en courant, elle entra dans le bois en courant, ne regardant plus rien, n’écoutant plus rien. Elle n’arrêta sa course que lorsque la respiration lui manqua, mais elle n’interrompit point sa marche. Elle allait devant elle, éperdue.","Scarcely had she gone a hundred paces when she stopped again, and began to scratch her head. Now it was La Thénardier who appeared to him; the hideous Thénardier with her hyena mouth and blazing anger in her eyes. The child looked back and forth miserably. What to do ? what to become? where to go ? Before her the specter of La Thénardier; behind her all the ghosts of the night and of the woods. It was before the Thénardier that she recoiled. She went back to the source and started to run. She left the village at a run, she entered the wood at a run, no longer looking at anything, no longer listening to anything. She didn't stop running until her breath failed her, but she didn't stop walking. She walked ahead of her, bewildered.","She had hardly gone a hundred paces when she stopped again and went back to scratching her head.

What was she to do? What would become of her? Where was she to go? Ahead was the spectre of the Thénardier woman, behind her all the shades of the night and the spectres of the forest. It was from the Thénardier woman that she retreated. She set off towards the spring again and started to run. She ran out of the village, she ran into the forest, not looking at anything now, not listening to anything. She did not stop running until she was out of breath, but still she went on walking. She kept on going, panic-stricken.","Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch her head again. Now it was the Thénardier who appeared to her, with her hideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The child cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her. What was she to do? What was to become of her? Where was she to go? In front of her was the spectre of the Thénardier; behind her all the phantoms of the night and of the forest. It was before the Thénardier that she recoiled. She resumed her path to the spring, and began to run. She emerged from the village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer looking at or listening to anything. She only paused in her course when her breath failed her; but she did not halt in her advance. She went straight before her in desperation.","She had scarcely gone a hundred steps when she stopped again, and began to scratch her head. Now, it was the Thénardiess that appeared to her; the hideous Thénardiess, with her hyena mouth and wrath flashing from her eyes. The child cast a pitiful glance before her and behind her. What could she do? What would become of her? Where should she go? Before her, the spectre of the Thénardiess; behind her, all the phantoms of night and of the forest.

She did not stop running until out of breath, and even then she staggered on. She went right on, desperate."

On a voulu d’abord en faire un cheval de selle. Bah ! il ruait, il flanquait tout le monde par terre. On le croyait vicieux, on ne savait qu’en faire. Je l’ai acheté. Je l’ai mis au cabriolet. Monsieur, c’est cela qu’il voulait ; il est doux comme une fille, il va le vent. Ah ! par exemple, il ne faudrait pas lui monter sur le dos. Ce n’est pas son idée d’être cheval de selle.

Sir, that's what he wanted; he is sweet as a girl, he goes the wind. Ah! for example, it should not be mounted on its back. It is not his idea to be a saddle horse. Everyone has their ambition.

Yes. Carry? No.’ We must suppose that is what he said to himself.”","“Monsieur Mayor,” resumed the Fleming, “I have just what you want.

Là, comme ce n’était pas l’argent qui lui manquait, il put se procurer des vêtements. Une guinguette aux environs de Balaguier était alors le vestiaire des forçats évadés, spécialité lucrative. Puis, Jean Valjean, comme tous ces tristes fugitifs qui tâchent de dépister le guet de la loi et la fatalité sociale, suivit un itinéraire obscur et ondulant. Il trouva un premier asile aux Pradeaux, près Beausset. Ensuite il se dirigea vers le Grand-Villard, près Briançon, dans les Hautes-Alpes. Fuite tâtonnante et inquiète, chemin de taupe dont les embranchements sont inconnus. On a pu, plus tard, retrouver quelque trace de son passage dans l’Ain sur le territoire de Civrieux, dans les Pyrénées à Accons au lieu dit la Grange-de-Doumecq, près du hameau de Chavailles, et dans les environs de Périgueux, à Brunies, canton de la Chapelle-Gonaguet. Il gagna Paris. On vient de le voir à Montfermeil.","In falling into the sea, or rather in throwing himself into it, he was, as we have seen, without irons. He swam between two waters until under a ship at anchor, to which was moored a boat. He found a way to hide in this boat until evening. At nightfall he swam again, and reached the coast a short distance from Cape Brun. There, as he had plenty of money, he was able to buy clothes. A guinguette around Balaguier was then the locker room for escaped convicts, a lucrative specialty. Then, Jean Valjean, like all those sad fugitives who try to track down the watch of the law and social fatality, followed a dark and undulating route. He found a first asylum at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he headed for Grand-Villard, near Briançon, in the Hautes-Alpes. Groping and restless escape, mole path whose branches are unknown. We were able, later, to find some trace of his passage in the Ain on the territory of Civrieux, in the Pyrenees at Accons at a place called Grange-de-Doumecq, near the hamlet of Chavailles, and in the vicinity of Périgueux. , in Brunies, canton of Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.","When he fell into the sea, or rather threw himself into it, he was, as we have seen, unshackled. He swam under the water to a ship riding at anchor with a boat moored to it. He contrived to hide in this boat until nightfall. After dark he took the plunge again and swam for it, and came ashore not far from Cap Brun. There, as he was not without money, he was able to buy some clothes. A country café close to Balaguier was at that time the outfitters for escaped convicts, a lucrative line of business. Then, like all those sorry fugitives who try to outwit the vigilance of the law and evade their social doom, Jean Valjean followed an obscure and complicated itinerary. He found initial refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he headed for Grand-Villard near Briançon in the Hautes-Alpes. A groping and harassed flight through a moles’ maze of secret tunnels. Later, some trace was found of his having been in the Civrieux area of Ain, in the Pyrenees, at Accons in the locality of La-Grange-de-Doumecq, near the hamlet of Chavailles, and in the Périgueux area, at Les Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. He got to Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.","When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, he was not ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hiding himself in this boat until night. At night he swam off again, and reached the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack money, he procured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhood of Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,—a lucrative specialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality, pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found his first refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard, near Briançon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and uneasy flight,—a mole’s track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later on, some trace of his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux, was discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.","When he fell into the sea, or rather when he threw himself into it, he was, as we have seen, free from his irons. He swam under water to a ship at anchor to which a boat was fastened. He found means to conceal himself in this boat until evening. At night he betook himself again to the water, and reached the land a short distance from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack for money, he could procure clothes. A little public-house in the environs of Balaguier was then the place which supplied clothing for escaped convicts, a lucrative business. Then Jean Valjean, like all those joyless fugitives who are endeavouring to throw off the track the spy of the law and social fatality, followed an obscure and wandering path. He found an asylum first in Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he went towards Grand Villard near Briançon, in the Hautes Alpes. Groping and restless flight, threading the mazes of the mole whose windings are unknown. There were afterwards found some trace of his passage in Ain, on the territory of Civrieux, in the Pyrenees at Accons, at a place called the Grange-de-Domecq, near the hamlet of Chavailles, and in the environs of Périgneux, at Brunies, a canton of Chapelle Gonaguet. He finally reached Paris. We have seen him at Montfermeil."
"Autour de lui l’obscurité, la brume, la solitude, le tumulte orageux et inconscient, le plissement indéfini des eaux farouches. En lui l’horreur et la fatigue. Sous lui la chute. Pas de point d’appui. Il songe aux aventures ténébreuses du cadavre dans l’ombre illimitée. Le froid sans fond le paralyse. Ses mains se crispent et se ferment et prennent du néant. Vents, nuées, tourbillons, souffles, étoiles inutiles ! Que faire ?

His hands clench and close and seize on nothing. Unavailing winds, clouds, waterspouts, breezes, stars! What can he do?

"Là où avait râlé ce lamentable désastre, tout faisait silence maintenant. L’encaissement du chemin creux était comble de chevaux et de cavaliers inextricablement amoncelés. Enchevêtrement terrible. Il n’y avait plus de talus, les cadavres nivelaient la route avec la plaine et venaient au ras du bord comme un boisseau d’orge bien mesuré. Un tas de morts dans la partie haute, une rivière de sang dans la partie basse ; telle était cette route, le soir du 18 juin 1815. Le sang coulait jusque sur la chaussée de Nivelles et s’y extravasait en une large mare devant l’abatis d’arbres qui barrait la chaussée, à un endroit qu’on montre encore. C’est, on s’en souvient, au point opposé, vers la chaussée de Genappe, qu’avait eu lieu l’effondrement des cuirassiers. L’épaisseur des cadavres se proportionnait à la profondeur du chemin creux. Vers le milieu, à l’endroit où il devenait plane, là où avait passé la division Delord, la couche des morts s’amincissait.","Where this lamentable disaster had grumbled, everything was silent now. The recess of the sunken road was filled with horses and riders inextricably piled up. Terrible entanglement. There was no more embankment, the corpses leveled the road with the plain and came to the edge like a well-measured bushel of barley. A pile of dead in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower part; such was this road, on the evening of June 18, 1815. The blood flowed as far as the chaussée de Nivelles and there was extravasated in a large pool in front of the felled trees which barred the road, at a place which is still shown. . It is, it will be remembered, at the opposite point, towards the Chaussée de Genappe, that the collapse of the cuirassiers took place. The thickness of the corpses was proportionate to the depth of the sunken path. Towards the middle, where it became level, where Delord's division had passed, the layer of the dead thinned out.","Where there had been the agonized moans of that dreadful calamity, all was silence now. The hollow of the sunken road was filled with horses and riders inextricably piled on top of each other. A terrible jumble. There was no embankment any more. The corpses had levelled the road with the plain, and came right up to the brim like a well filled bushel of barley. A heap of dead bodies on top, a river of blood below, such was this road on the evening of the eighteenth of June 1815. The blood ran all the way to the Nivelles high road and there formed a large pool in front of the felled trees that barred the way at a spot that is pointed out even today. It was, remember, on the opposite side, towards the Genappe road, that the cuirassiers came to grief. The pile of corpses varied in density according to how deep the sunken road was. Towards the middle, where it was flush with the plain, and where Delort’s division had passed, the layer of corpses thinned out.","There, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle, all was silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horses and riders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! There was no longer any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain, and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley. A heap of dead bodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower part—such was that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The blood ran even to the Nivelles highway, and there overflowed in a large pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way, at a spot which is still pointed out. It will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, in the direction of the Genappe road, that the destruction of the cuirassiers had taken place. The thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at the point where it became level, where Delort’s division had passed, the layer of corpses was thinner.","There, where this terrible death-rattle had been, all was now silent. The cut of the sunken road was filled with horses and riders inextricably heaped together. Terrible entanglement. There were no longer slopes to the road; dead bodies filled it even with the plain and came to the edge of the banks like a well-measured bushel of barley. A mass of dead above, a river of blood below—such was this road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The blood ran even to the Nivelles road, and oozed through in a large pool in front of the abattis of trees, which barred that road, at a spot which is still shown. It was, it will be remembered, at the opposite point towards the road from Genappe, that the burying of the cuirassiers took place. The thickness of the mass of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at a spot where it became shallower, over which Delord’s division had passed, this bed of death became thinner."

"Le soir il rentrait fatigué et mangeait sa soupe, sans dire un mot. Sa sœur, mère Jeanne, pendant qu’il mangeait, lui prenait souvent dans son écuelle le meilleur de son repas, le morceau de viande, la tranche de lard, le cœur de chou, pour le donner à quelqu’un de ses enfants ; lui, mangeant toujours, penché sur la table, presque la tête dans sa soupe, ses longs cheveux tombant autour de son écuelle et cachant ses yeux, avait l’air de ne rien voir et laissait faire. Il y avait à Faverolles, pas loin de la chaumière Valjean, de l’autre côté de la ruelle, une fermière appelée Marie-Claude ; les enfants Valjean, habituellement affamés, allaient quelquefois emprunter au nom de leur mère une pinte de lait à Marie-Claude, qu’ils buvaient derrière une haie ou dans quelque coin d’allée, s’arrachant le pot, et si hâtivement que les petites filles s’en répandaient sur leur tablier et dans leur goulotte. La mère, si elle eût su cette maraude, eût sévèrement corrigé les délinquants. Jean Valjean, brusque et bougon, payait en arrière de la mère la pinte de lait à Marie-Claude, et les enfants n’étaient pas punis.","In the evening he came home tired and ate his soup without saying a word. His sister, mother Jeanne, while he ate, often took the best of his meal from his bowl, the piece of meat, the slice of bacon, the heart of cabbage, to give it to one of his children; he, still eating, leaning over the table, his head almost in his soup, his long hair falling around his bowl and hiding his eyes, seemed to see nothing and let it happen. There was in Faverolles, not far from the Valjean cottage, on the other side of the lane, a farmer's wife called Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, usually starving, sometimes went to borrow a pint of milk from Marie-Claude in their mother's name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their chutes. The mother, if she had known of this marauding, would have severely corrected the delinquents. Jean Valjean, brusque and grumpy, paid Marie-Claude a pint of milk behind the mother, and the children were not punished.","He would come home tired in the evening and eat his soup without uttering a word.

There was at Faverolles not far from the Valjeans’ cottage, on the other side of the lane, a farmer’s wife named Marie-Claude. The Valjean children, who were always hungry, sometimes used to go to Marie-Claude to ask for a pint of milk, supposedly for their mother, which they would drink behind a hedge or in some corner of the street, snatching the jug from each other, and they drank so quickly the little girls would spill it on their pinafores and down their little necks. If their mother had known about this cadging, she would have punished the culprits severely. Gruff and grumbling, Jean Valjean paid Marie-Claude for the pint of milk behind their mother’s back, and the children were not punished.","He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word. His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating,—a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the heart of the cabbage,—to give to one of her children.

"Indépendamment du but sévère et religieux que se proposaient ses actions, tout ce qu’il avait fait jusqu’à ce jour n’était autre chose qu’un trou qu’il creusait pour y enfouir son nom. Ce qu’il avait toujours le plus redouté, dans ses heures de repli sur lui-même, dans ses nuits d’insomnie, c’était d’entendre jamais prononcer ce nom ; il se disait que ce serait là pour lui la fin de tout ; que le jour où ce nom reparaîtrait, il ferait évanouir autour de lui sa vie nouvelle, et, qui sait même peut-être ? au dedans de lui sa nouvelle âme. Il frémissait de la seule pensée que c’était possible. Certes, si quelqu’un lui eût dit en ces moments-là qu’une heure viendrait où ce nom retentirait à son oreille, où ce hideux mot, Jean Valjean, sortirait tout à coup de la nuit et se dresserait devant lui, où cette lumière formidable faite pour dissiper le mystère dont il s’enveloppait resplendirait subitement sur sa tête, et que ce nom ne le menacerait pas, que cette lumière ne produirait qu’une obscurité plus épaisse, que ce voile déchiré accroîtrait le mystère, que ce tremblement de terre consoliderait son édifice, que ce prodigieux incident n’aurait d’autre résultat, si bon lui semblait, à lui, que de rendre son existence à la fois plus claire et plus impénétrable, et que, de sa confrontation avec le fantôme de Jean Valjean, le bon et digne bourgeois monsieur Madeleine sortirait plus honoré, plus paisible et plus respecté que jamais, — si quelqu’un lui eût dit cela, il eût hoché la tête et regardé ces paroles comme insensées. Eh bien ! tout cela venait précisément d’arriver, tout cet entassement de l’impossible était un fait, et Dieu avait permis que ces choses folles devinssent des choses réelles !","Regardless of the stern and religious purpose of his actions, all he had done to date was nothing but a hole he was digging to bury his name in. What he had always dreaded most, in his hours of withdrawal into himself, in his sleepless nights, was to ever hear that name mentioned; he told himself that for him that would be the end of everything; that the day when this name would reappear, it would cause its new life to vanish around him, and, who knows, perhaps? within him his new soul. He shuddered at the mere thought that it was possible. Certainly, if someone had told him in those moments that an hour would come when that name would ring in his ear, when that hideous word, Jean Valjean, would suddenly come out of the night and stand before him, when this tremendous light made to dissipate the mystery in which he enveloped himself would suddenly shine on his head, and that this name would not threaten him, that this light would only produce a thicker darkness, that this torn veil would increase the mystery, that this trembling of earth would consolidate his edifice, that this prodigious incident would have no other result, so good to him, than to make his existence both clearer and more impenetrable, and that, from his confrontation with the ghost of Jean Valjean, the good and worthy bourgeois Monsieur Madeleine, would go out more honoured, more peaceful and more respected than ever—if someone had told him that, he would have shook his head and regarded these words as nonsense. Well ! all this had just happened, all this piling up of the impossible was a fact, and God had allowed these crazy things to become real things!","Irrespective of the austere religious purpose his actions were intended to serve, everything he had done up until that day was nothing but a hole he had been digging in which to bury his name.

He told himself that if he did, it would spell the end of everything for him. That the day that name resurfaced it would cause his new life to vanish, and even perhaps – who knows? – the new soul within him. He shuddered at the very thought that this was possible. Certainly, if anyone had told him during those moments that the time would come when that name would ring in his ears, when the hideous words ‘Jean Valjean’ would suddenly emerge from the darkness and loom before him, when that formidable light destined to dissipate the mystery in which he had shrouded himself would suddenly shine on him, and this name would not threaten him, this light would create only denser obscurity, this rent veil would increase the mystery, this earthquake would consolidate his edifice, this extraordinary incident would have no other result, if it was what he wanted, than to make his existence at once more transparent and more impenetrable, and out of his confrontation with the ghost of Jean Valjean the good and worthy gentleman Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honoured, more at peace and more respected than ever – if anyone had told him this he would have shaken his head and regarded those words as insane.

Il venait de voir sous de nouveaux aspects la méchanceté des hommes et la misère de la société, aspects incomplets et qui ne montraient fatalement qu’un côté du vrai, le sort de la femme résumé dans Fantine, l’autorité publique personnifiée dans Javert ; il était retourné au bagne, cette fois pour avoir bien fait ; de nouvelles amertumes l’avaient abreuvé ; le dégoût et la lassitude le reprenaient ; le souvenir même de l’évêque touchait peut-être à quelque moment d’éclipse, sauf à reparaître plus tard lumineux et triomphant ; mais enfin ce souvenir sacré s’affaiblissait. Qui sait si Jean Valjean n’était pas à la veille de se décourager et de retomber ? Il aima, et il redevint fort. Hélas ! il n’était guère moins chancelant que Cosette. Il la protégea et elle l’affermit. Grâce à lui, elle put marcher dans la vie ; grâce à elle, il put continuer dans la vertu. Il fut le soutien de cet enfant et cet enfant fut son point d’appui. O mystère insondable et divin des équilibres de la destinée !","This is only a personal opinion; but to tell our whole thought, at the point where Jean Valjean was when he began to love Cosette, it has not been proven to us that he did not need this supply to persevere in good. He had just seen under new aspects the wickedness of men and the misery of society, incomplete aspects which inevitably showed only one side of the truth, the fate of woman summarized in Fantine, public authority personified in Javert; he had returned to prison, this time for having done well; new bitterness had quenched him; disgust and weariness overcame him; even the memory of the bishop touched perhaps at some moment of eclipse, except to reappear later luminous and triumphant; but finally this sacred memory was weakening. Who knows if Jean Valjean was not on the verge of becoming discouraged and falling back? He loved, and he became strong again. Alas! he was hardly less tottering than Cosette. He protected her and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she was able to walk in life; thanks to her, he was able to continue in virtue. He was the support of this child and this child was his point of support. O unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny!","This is only a personal opinion but, to speak our mind in full, at the stage Jean Valjean had reached when he began to love Cosette we have yet to be convinced he did not need this encouragement to persevere in his efforts to lead a good life. He had just seen the wickedness of men and social hardship in a new perspective, a limited perspective that inevitably revealed only one side of the truth, the fate of women represented by Fantine, and public authority personified by Javert. He had been sent back to prison, this time for good behaviour. Fresh resentments had brewed within him. Disgust and weariness overcame him once more. Even the memory of the bishop suffered what might have been a temporary eclipse, possibly to appear bright and triumphant again later, but undoubtedly that sacred memory was fading. Who knows whether Jean Valjean was on the verge of losing heart and relapsing? He loved, and he became strong again. Alas! he was hardly any less unsteady on his feet than was Cosette. He protected her and she bolstered him. Thanks to him, she could make her way in life. Thanks to her, he could continue on the path of virtue. He was the child’s support, and the child was his stay. Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of destiny’s counterbalances!","This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, at the point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette, it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect—incomplete aspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth, the fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as personified in Javert. He had returned to prison, this time for having done right; he had quaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude were overpowering him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse, though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant; but, after all, that sacred memory was growing dim. Who knows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more? He loved and grew strong again. Alas! he walked with no less indecision than Cosette. He protected her, and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she could walk through life; thanks to her, he could continue in virtue. He was that child’s stay, and she was his prop. Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny!","This is but personal opinion; but in order to express our idea thoroughly, at the point Jean Valjean had reached, when he began to love Cosette, it is not clear to us that he did not require this fresh supply of goodness to enable him to persevere in the right path. He had seen the wickedness of men and the misery of society under new aspects—aspects incomplete and, unfortunately, showing forth only one side of the truth—the lot of woman summed up in Fantine, public authority personified in Javert; he had been sent back to the galleys this time for doing good; new waves of bitterness had overwhelmed him; disgust and weariness had once more resumed their sway; the recollection of the bishop, even, was perhaps eclipsed, sure to reappear afterwards, luminous and triumphant; yet, in fact, this blessed remembrance was growing feebler. Who knows that Jean Valjean was not on the point of becoming discouraged and falling back to evil ways? Love came, and he again grew strong. Alas! he was no less feeble than Cosette. He protected her, and she gave strength to him. Thanks to him, she could walk upright in life; thanks to her, he could persist in virtuous deeds. He was the support of this child, and this child was his prop and staff. Oh, divine and unfathomable mystery of the compensations of Destiny!"

"Lorsque Jean Valjean, dans la nuit même du jour où Javert l’arrêta près du lit de mort de Fantine, s’échappa de la prison municipale de Montreuil-sur-Mer, la police supposa que le forçat évadé avait dû se diriger vers Paris. Paris est un malstroëm où tout se perd, et tout disparaît dans ce nombril du monde comme dans le nombril de la mer. Aucune forêt ne cache un homme comme cette foule. Les fugitifs de toute espèce le savent. Ils vont à Paris comme à un engloutissement ; il y a des engloutissements qui sauvent. La police le sait aussi, et c’est à Paris qu’elle cherche ce qu’elle a perdu ailleurs. Elle y chercha l’ex-maire de Montreuil-sur-Mer. Javert fut appelé à Paris afin d’éclairer les perquisitions. Javert en effet aida puissamment à reprendre Jean Valjean. Le zèle et l’intelligence de Javert en cette occasion furent remarqués de M. Chabouillet, secrétaire de la préfecture sous le comte Anglès. M. Chabouillet, qui du reste avait déjà protégé Javert, fit attacher l’inspecteur de Montreuil-sur-Mer à la police de Paris. Là Javert se rendit diversement et, disons-le, quoique le mot semble inattendu pour de pareils services, honorablement utile.","When Jean Valjean, on the very night of the day on which Javert arrested him near Fantine's deathbed, escaped from the municipal prison of Montreuil-sur-Mer, the police assumed that the escaped convict must have gone to Paris. . Paris is a malstrom where everything is lost, and everything disappears in this navel of the world as in the navel of the sea. No forest hides a man like this crowd. Fugitives of all kinds know this. They go to Paris as if to an engulfment; there are swallowings that save. The police know it too, and it is in Paris that they are looking for what they have lost elsewhere. She looked for the ex-mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer there. Javert was called to Paris to clarify the searches. Javert indeed helped powerfully to recapture Jean Valjean. The zeal and intelligence of Javert on this occasion were noticed by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the prefecture under Count Angles. M. Chabouillet, who, moreover, had already protected Javert, had the inspector of Montreuil-sur-Mer attached to the Paris police. There Javert gave himself variously and, let us say it, although the word seems unexpected for such services, honorably useful.","When, on the day that Javert arrested him at Fantine’s deathbed, Jean Valjean escaped from Montreuil-sur-Mer’s town gaol, the police assumed the escaped convict must have made his way to Paris. Paris is a maelstrom in which all is lost, and all disappears inside this earthly vortex as it does in the vortex of the seas. No forest hides a man as effectively as this throng. All manner of fugitives know this. They go to Paris to be swallowed up. There is salvation in being swallowed up. The police know this too, and it is in Paris they go looking for what they have lost elsewhere. That is where they went looking for the former mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Javert was summoned to Paris to assist in the search. And indeed Javert contributed considerably to the recapture of Jean Valjean. Javert’s zeal and intelligence in that instance were noted by Monsieur Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Anglès. Monsieur Chabouillet, who was in any case already a patron of Javert, arranged for the inspector of Montreuil-sur-Mer to be transferred to the Paris police. There, Javert in various ways made himself useful, and let us say, unexpected as the word may seem with regard to such services, honourably so.","When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had arrested him beside Fantine’s death-bed, had escaped from the town jail of M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to Paris. Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything disappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No forest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives of every sort know this. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save. The police know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was summoned to Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in fact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean. Javert’s zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Anglès. M. Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert’s patron, had the inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. There Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seem strange for such services, honorable manners.","When Jean Valjean, on the night of the very day that Javert arrested him at the death-bed of Fantine, escaped from the municipal prison of M—— sur M——, the police supposed that the escaped convict would start for Paris. Paris is a maelstrom in which everything is lost; and everything disappears in this whirlpool of the world as in the whirlpool of the sea. No forest conceals a man like this multitude. Fugitives of all kinds know this. They go to Paris to be swallowed up; there are swallowings-up which save. The police know it also, and it is in Paris that they search for what they have lost elsewhere. They searched there for the ex-mayor of M—— sur M——. Javert was summoned to Paris to aid in the investigation. Javert, in fact, was of great aid in the recapture of Jean Valjean. The zeal and intelligence of Javert on this occasion were remarked by M. Chabouillet, Secretary of the Prefecture, under Count Anglès. M. Chabouillet, who had already interested himself in Javert, secured the transfer of the inspector of M—— sur M—— to the police of Paris. There Javert rendered himself in various ways, and, let us say, although the word seems unusual for such service, honourably, useful."

"La première chose qui le frappa dans ce préau, ce fut une porte du seizième siècle qui y simule une arcade, tout étant tombé autour d’elle. L’aspect monumental naît souvent de la ruine. Auprès de l’arcade s’ouvre dans un mur une autre porte aux claveaux du temps de Henri IV, laissant voir les arbres d’un verger. A côté de cette porte un trou à fumier, des pioches et des pelles, quelques charrettes, un vieux puits avec sa dalle et son tourniquet de fer, un poulain qui saute, un dindon qui fait la roue, une chapelle que surmonte un petit clocher, un poirier en fleur en espalier sur le mur de la chapelle, voilà cette cour dont la conquête fut un rêve de Napoléon.

"― Le cardinal Fesch refusant de se démettre, M. de Pins, archevêque d’Amasie, administrait le diocèse de Lyon. La querelle de la vallée des Dappes commençait entre la Suisse et la France par un mémoire du capitaine Dufour, depuis général. Saint-Simon, ignoré, échafaudait son rêve sublime. Il y avait à l’académie des sciences un Fourier célèbre que la postérité a oublié et dans je ne sais quel grenier un Fourier obscur dont l’avenir se souviendra. Lord Byron commençait à poindre ; une note d’un poème de Millevoye l’annonçait à la France en ces termes : un certain lord Baron. David d’Angers s’essayait à pétrir le marbre. L’abbé Caron parlait avec éloge, en petit comité de séminaristes, dans le cul-de-sac des Feuillantines, d’un prêtre inconnu nommé Félicité Robert qui a été plus tard Lamennais. Une chose qui fumait et clapotait sur la Seine avec le bruit d’un chien qui nage allait et venait sous les fenêtres des Tuileries, du pont Royal au pont Louis XV ; c’était une mécanique bonne à pas grand’chose, une espèce de joujou, une rêverie d’inventeur songe-creux, une utopie : un bateau à vapeur. Les parisiens regardaient cette inutilité avec indifférence. M. de Vaublanc, réformateur de l’institut par coup d’état, ordonnance et fournée, auteur distingué de plusieurs académiciens, après en avoir fait, ne pouvait parvenir à l’être. Le faubourg Saint-Germain et le pavillon Marsan souhaitaient pour préfet de police M. Delaveau, à cause de sa dévotion. Dupuytren et Récamier se prenaient de querelle à l’amphithéâtre de l’École de médecine et se menaçaient du poing à propos de la divinité de Jésus-Christ. Cuvier, un œil sur la Genèse et l’autre sur la nature, s’efforçait de plaire à la réaction bigote en mettant les fossiles d’accord avec les textes et en faisant flatter Moïse par les mastodontes. M. François de Neufchâteau, louable cultivateur de la mémoire de Parmentier, faisait mille efforts pour que pomme de terre fut prononcée parmentière, et n’y réussissait point. L’abbé Grégoire, ancien évêque, ancien conventionnel, ancien sénateur, était passé dans la polémique royaliste à l’état « d’infâme Grégoire ». Cette locution que nous venons d’employer : passer à l’état de, était dénoncée comme néologisme par M. Royer-Collard. On pouvait distinguer encore à sa blancheur, sous la troisième arche du pont d’Iéna, la pierre neuve avec laquelle, deux ans auparavant, on avait bouché le trou de mine pratiqué par Blücher pour faire sauter le pont. La justice appelait à sa barre un homme qui, en voyant entrer le comte d’Artois à Notre-Dame, avait dit tout haut : Sapristi ! je regrette le temps où je voyais Bonaparte et Talma entrer bras dessus, bras dessous, au Bal-Sauvage. Propos séditieux. Six mois de prison. Des traîtres se montraient déboutonnés ; des hommes qui avaient passé à l’ennemi la veille d’une bataille, ne cachaient rien de la récompense et marchaient impudiquement en plein soleil dans le cynisme des richesses et des dignités ; des déserteurs de Ligny et des Quatre-Bras, dans le débraillé de leur turpitude payée, étalaient leur dévouement monarchique tout nu ; oubliant ce qui est écrit en Angleterre sur la muraille intérieure des water-closets publics : Please adjust your dress before leaving.","―Cardinal Fesch refusing to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasia, administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of the Dappes began between Switzerland and France with a memoir of Captain Dufour, since general. Saint-Simon, ignored, was constructing his sublime dream. There was in the Academy of Sciences a famous Fourier whom posterity has forgotten and in some unknown attic an obscure Fourier whose future will remember. Lord Byron was beginning to dawn; a note from a poem by Millevoye announced him to France in these terms: a certain Lord Baron. David d'Angers tried his hand at kneading marble. Abbé Caron spoke with praise, in a small committee of seminarians, in the cul-de-sac of the Feuillantines, of an unknown priest named Félicité Robert who was later Lamennais. A thing that smoked and lapped on the Seine with the sound of a dog swimming came and went under the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis XV; it was a good-for-nothing machine, a kind of toy, a daydream of a dreamy inventor, a utopia: a steamboat. The Parisians regarded this uselessness with indifference. M. de Vaublanc, reformer of the institute by coup d'etat, ordinance and batch, distinguished author of several academicians, after having made some, could not succeed in being so. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the Pavillon Marsan wanted M. Delaveau as prefect of police, because of his devotion. Dupuytren and Récamier got into a quarrel in the amphitheater of the School of Medicine and threatened each other with their fists about the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier, one eye on Genesis and the other on nature, endeavored to please the bigoted reaction by putting the fossils in agreement with the texts and by having the mastodons flatter Moses. M. François de Neufchâteau, praiseworthy cultivator of the memory of Parmentier, made a thousand efforts to have the potato pronounced parmentière, and did not succeed. Abbé Grégoire, former bishop, former member of the Convention, former senator, had passed into the state of ""infamous Grégoire"" in the royalist controversy. This expression that we have just used: to pass to the state of, was denounced as a neologism by M. Royer-Collard. One could still distinguish by its whiteness, under the third arch of the Jena bridge, the new stone with which, two years previously, they had blocked the blast hole drilled by Blücher to blow up the bridge. Justice called to its bar a man who, on seeing the Comte d'Artois enter Notre-Dame, had said aloud: Holy shit! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma enter arm in arm at the Bal-Sauvage. Seditious talk. Six months in prison. Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had passed over to the enemy on the eve of a battle, hid nothing of the reward and walked shamelessly in full sunlight in the cynicism of riches and dignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the scruffiness of their paid turpitude, displayed their monarchical devotion stark naked; forgetting what is written in England on the inner wall of public water closets: Please adjust your dress before leaving.","As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, Monsieur de Pins, archbishop of Amasie, administered the diocese of Lyon. The dispute between Switzerland and France over the valley of Dappes was sparked by a report by Captain, later General, Dufour. Unrecognized, Saint-Simon was working on his sublime dream. At the Academy of Sciences there was a famous Fourier who has been forgotten by posterity, and in some garret or other a little-known Fourier whom future generations will remember. Lord Byron was beginning to make his name. A note to a poem by Millevoye introduced him to France as ‘a certain Lord Baron’. David d’Angers was demonstrating his skill at working in marble. Abbé Carron was singing the praises, to a small gathering of seminarists in Cul-de-sac des Feuillantines, of an unknown priest named Félicité-Robert, later to become Lamennais. A thing that emitted smoke and splashed about on the Seine, making a noise like a dog paddling, went to and fro past the windows of the Tuileries, between the Pont Royal and the Pont Louis XV. It was a contraption of not much use, some sort of plaything, the fantasy of an impractical inventor, a chimera – a steamboat. Parisians stared at this piece of futility with indifference. Monsieur de Vaublanc, reformer of the Institut by coup d’état, royal decree and change of guard, and distinguished creator of several Academicians – having created them, failed to become one himself. The Faubourg St-Germain and the Pavillon de Marsan wanted Monsieur Delavau for prefect of police because of his loyalty. Dupuytren and Récamier had an argument in the amphitheatre at the School of Medicine and threatened to come to blows over the divinity of Jesus Christ. With one eye on Genesis and the other on nature, Cuvier did his best to please religious reactionaries by reconciling fossils with biblical texts and using mastodons to give credit to Moses. Monsieur François de Neufchâteau, admirable promoter of Parmentier’s memory, made countless efforts to have pomme de terre pronounced parmentière, and was utterly unsuccessful. Abbé Grégoire, former bishop, former member of the Convention, former senator, in the royalist polemical vocabulary had been downgraded to ‘infamous Grégoire’. That word ‘downgraded’ was denounced as a neologism by Monsieur Royer-Collard. Under the third arch of the Pont d’Iéna you could still distinguish by its whiteness the new stone used to fill the hole for explosives that Blücher had made two years earlier to blow up the bridge. The law prosecuted a man who at the sight of the Comte d’Artois entering Notre-Dame had said out loud, ‘Oh, for the days when I used to see Bonaparte and Talma going into the Bal-Sauvage arm in arm!’ Seditious talk. Six months in prison. Traitors were brazen. Men who had defected to the enemy on the eve of battle made no secret of their reward, and went about shamelessly in the light of day with their cynically acquired riches and honours. In the indecency of their paid abjectness deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras nakedly displayed their devotion to the monarchy, forgetting what is written on the wall in public conveniences in England: ‘Please adjust your dress before leaving.’","As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie, administered the diocese of Lyons.

Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over to the enemy on the eve of battle made no secret of their recompense, and strutted immodestly in the light of day, in the cynicism of riches and dignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness of their well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy in the most barefaced manner.","Cardinal Fesch refusing to resign, Monsieur de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie, administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel of the Vallée des Dappes commenced between France and Switzerland by a memorial from Captain, afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, unknown, was building up his sublime dream. There was a celebrated Fourier in the Academy of Sciences whom posterity has forgotten, and an obscure Fourier in some unknown garret whom the future will remember. Lord Byron was beginning to dawn; a note to a poem of Millevoye introduced him to France as a certain Lord Baron. David d’Angers was endeavouring to knead marble. The Abbè Caron spoke with praise, in a small party of Seminarists in the cul-de-sac of the Feuillantines, of an unknown priest, Félicité Robert by name, who was afterwards Lamennais. A thing which smoked and clacked on the Seine, making the noise of a swimming dog, went and came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis XV. ; it was a piece of mechanism of no great value, a sort of toy, the day-dream of a visionary, a Utopia—a steamboat. The Parisians looked upon the useless thing with indifference. Monsieur Vaublanc, wholesale reformer of the Institute by royal ordinance and distinguished author of several academicians, after having made them, could not make himself one. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the Pavillon Marsan desired Monsieur Delaveau for prefect of police, on account of his piety. Dupuytren and Récamier quarrelled in the amphitheatre of the Ecole de Médicine, and shook their fists in each other’s faces, over the divinity of Christ. Cuvier, with one eye on the book of Genesis and the other on nature, was endeavouring to please the bigoted reaction by reconciling fossils with texts and making the mastodons support Moses. Monsieur François de Neufchâteau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memory of Parmentier, was making earnest efforts to have pomme de terre pronounced parmentière, without success. Abbé Grégoire, ex-bishop, ex-member of the National Convention, and ex-senator, had passed to the condition of the “infamous Grégoire,” in royalist polemics. The expression which we have just employed, “passed to the condition,” was denounced as a neologism by Monsieur Royer-Collard. The new stone could still be distinguished by its whiteness under the third arch of the bridge of Jena, which, two years before, had been used to stop up the entrance of the mine bored by Blücher to blow up the bridge. Justice summoned to her bar a man who had said aloud, on seeing Count d’Artois entering Notre-Dame, “Sapristi! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma entering the Bal-Savage, arm in arm.” Seditious language. Six months’ imprisonment. Traitors showed themselves stripped even of hypocrisy; men who had gone over to the enemy on the eve of a battle made no concealment of their bribes, and shamelessly walked abroad in daylight in the cynicism of wealth and dignities; deserters of Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness of their purchased shame, exposed the nakedness of their devotion to monarchy, forgetting the commonest requirements of public decency."

"Depuis que la gare du railway d’Orléans a envahi les terrains de la Salpêtrière, les antiques rues étroites qui avoisinent les fossés Saint-Victor et le Jardin des Plantes s’ébranlent, violemment traversées trois ou quatre fois chaque jour par ces courants de diligences, de fiacres et d’omnibus qui, dans un temps donné, refoulent les maisons à droite et à gauche ; car il y a des choses bizarres à énoncer qui sont rigoureusement exactes, et de même qu’il est vrai de dire que dans les grandes villes le soleil fait végéter et croître les façades des maisons au midi, il est certain que le passage fréquent des voitures élargit les rues. Les symptômes d’une vie nouvelle sont évidents. Dans ce vieux quartier provincial, aux recoins les plus sauvages, le pavé se montre, les trottoirs commencent à ramper et à s’allonger, même là où il n’y a pas encore de passants. Un matin, matin mémorable, en juillet 1845, on y vit tout à coup fumer les marmites noires du bitume ; ce jour-là on put dire que la civilisation était arrivée rue de l’Ourcine et que Paris était entré dans le faubourg Saint-Marceau.","Since the Orléans railway station invaded the grounds of the Salpêtrière, the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the Saint-Victor ditches and the Jardin des Plantes have shaken, violently crossed three or four times each day by these currents of stagecoaches. , cabs and omnibuses which, in a given time, drive back the houses on the right and on the left; because there are bizarre things to state which are rigorously exact, and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun causes the facades of houses to vegetate and grow in the south, it is certain that the frequent passage of cars widens the streets. The symptoms of new life are evident. In this old provincial district, in the wildest corners, the cobblestones show themselves, the sidewalks begin to creep and lengthen, even where there are no passers-by yet. One morning, a memorable morning, in July 1845, the black pots of bitumen were suddenly seen smoking there; on that day one could say that civilization had arrived in the rue de l'Ourcine and that Paris had entered the Faubourg Saint-Marceau.","Since the Paris–Orléans railway station invaded the Salpêtrière area, the ancient narrow streets close to Fossés-St-Victor and the Jardin des Plantes have been shaken by those streams of coaches, carriages and omnibuses, violently passing through three or four times a day, that over a period time thrust aside the houses to right and left. For there are things that, peculiar as they sound, are undeniable facts, and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the south-facing façades of houses grow verdant, it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles widens streets. Symptoms of a new life are obvious. In the most uncharted corners of this old parochial neighbourhood, paving appears; the pavements begin their creeping progress even where there are as yet no pedestrians. One memorable morning in July 1845 steaming black pots of bitumen were suddenly to be seen. On that day it might be said that civilization reached Rue de Lourcine and Paris entered the outlying district of St-Marceau.","Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpêtrière, the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the Jardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right and the left; for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact; and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets.

The symptoms of a new life are evident. In that old provincial quarter, and in its wildest corners, pavement is beginning to appear, sidewalks are springing up and stretching to longer and longer distances, even in those parts where there are as yet no passersby.

Hier, je n’avais que les pieds froids ; aujourd’hui, le froid a gagné les genoux ; maintenant je le sens qui monte jusqu’à la ceinture ; quand il sera au cœur, je m’arrêterai. Le soleil est beau, n’est-ce pas ? je me suis fait rouler dehors pour jeter un dernier coup d’œil sur les choses. Vous pouvez me parler, cela ne me fatigue point. Vous faites bien de venir regarder un homme qui va mourir. Il est bon que ce moment-là ait des témoins. On a des manies ; j’aurais voulu aller jusqu’à l’aube. Mais je sais que j’en ai à peine pour trois heures. Il fera nuit. Au fait qu’importe ! Finir est une affaire simple. On n’a pas besoin du matin pour cela. Soit. Je mourrai à la belle étoile.","―I am a bit of a doctor; I know how the last hour comes. Yesterday I only had cold feet; today the cold has reached the knees; now I feel it rising to the waist; when he is in the heart, I will stop. The sun is beautiful, isn't it? I rolled myself outside to take a last look at things. You can talk to me, that doesn't bother me. You do well to come and watch a man who is about to die. It is good that this moment has witnesses. We have quirks; I would have liked to go until dawn. But I know I only have three hours. It will be night. By the way, what does it matter! Finishing is a simple matter. You don't need the morning for that. That is. I will die under the stars.","I know how the end comes. Yesterday only my feet were cold. Today the chill is in my knees. Now I feel it rising to my waist. When it reaches my heart, I shall cease to be. Isn’t the sun splendid? I had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me, it doesn’t tire me. You do well to come and watch a man who’s going to die. It’s right there should be witnesses to that moment. We all have our own little fancies – I’d like to have lasted till dawn. But I know I have barely three hours left. It’ll be dark. Anyway, what difference does it make! Dying is a simple matter. There’s no need for daylight. Very well then. I shall die by starlight.’","“I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws on. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, I shall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it does not fatigue me. You have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment. One has one’s caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours. It will be night then. What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that. So be it. I shall die by starlight.”","“I am something of a physician; I know the steps by which death approaches; yesterday my feet only were cold; to-day the cold has crept to my knees, now it has reached the waist; when it touches the heart all will be over. The sunset is lovely, is it not? I had myself wheeled out to get a final look at nature. You can speak to me; that will not tire me. You do well to come to see a man who is dying. It is good that these moments should have witnesses. Every one has his fancy; I should like to live until the dawn, but I know I have scarcely life for three hours. It will be night, but what matters it: to finish is a very simple thing. One does not need morning for that. Be it so: I shall die in the starlight.”"

"Fantine apprit comment on se passe tout à fait de feu en hiver, comment on renonce à un oiseau qui vous mange un liard de millet tous les deux jours, comment on fait de son jupon sa couverture et de sa couverture son jupon, comment on ménage sa chandelle en prenant son repas à la lumière de la fenêtre d’en face. On ne sait pas tout ce que certains êtres faibles, qui ont vieilli dans le dénûment et l’honnêteté, savent tirer d’un sou. Cela finit par être un talent. Fantine acquit ce sublime talent et reprit un peu de courage.","Fantine learned how to do without fire altogether in winter, how to give up a bird that eats a farthing of millet every two days, how to make your petticoat your blanket and your blanket your petticoat, how you his candle while taking his meal in the light of the window opposite.

Fantine acquired this sublime talent and regained a little courage.","Fantine learned how to go without any fire at all in winter, how to give up a bird that eats a quarter of a sou’s worth of millet every two days, how to make a coverlet of your underskirt and an underskirt of your coverlet, how to save your candle by taking your meals by the light from the window opposite. We do not know how much some poor creatures who have grown old in honest destitution can get out of one sou. It eventually becomes a talent. Fantine acquired this sublime talent, and again took heart a little.","Fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing’s worth of millet every two days; how to make a coverlet of one’s petticoat, and a petticoat of one’s coverlet; how to save one’s candle, by taking one’s meals by the light of the opposite window.

"On n’a jamais su comment il avait réussi à pénétrer dans la cour sans faire ouvrir la porte cochère. Il avait, et portait toujours sur lui, un passe-partout qui ouvrait une petite porte latérale ; mais on avait dû le fouiller et lui prendre son passe-partout. Ce point n’a pas été éclairci.","We never knew how he had managed to enter the courtyard without opening the carriage door. He had, and always carried with him, a master key which opened a small side door; but they must have searched him and taken his master key.

"Mais, avouons-le, cette idée, au premier abord naturelle, lui apparaissait, après un moment de réflexion, comme étrange et impossible, et presque repoussante. Car, au fond, il partageait l’impression générale, et le conventionnel lui inspirait, sans qu’il s’en rendît clairement compte, ce sentiment qui est comme la frontière de la haine et qu’exprime si bien le mot éloignement.","But, let's face it, this idea, at first sight natural, appeared to him, after a moment of reflection, as strange and impossible, and almost repulsive. Because, deep down, he shared the general impression, and the Conventional inspired him, without his clearly realizing it, this feeling which is like the border of hatred and which the word estrangement expresses so well.","But let us admit, this idea, on the face of it a natural one, after a moment’s reflection appeared to him outlandish and impossible, almost repellent. For he basically shared the general impression, and the member of the Convention inspired in him, without his being clearly conscious of it, that feeling bordering as it were on hatred and so well expressed by the word ‘aversion’.","But, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush, appeared to him after a moment’s reflection, as strange, impossible, and almost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.","But this idea, we must confess, though it appeared natural at first, yet, after a few moments’ reflection, seemed strange, impracticable, and almost repulsive. For at heart he shared the general impression and the conventionist inspired him, he knew not how, with that sentiment which is the fringe of hatred, and which the word “aversion” so well expresses."

"Le matin, sur la berge qui fait l’angle du chemin de Plancenoit, il avait mis pied à terre dans la boue, s’était fait apporter de la ferme de Rossomme une table de cuisine et une chaise de paysan, s’était assis, avec une botte de paille pour tapis, et avait déployé sur la table la carte du champ de bataille, en disant à Soult : Joli échiquier !","In the morning, on the bank at the corner of the Chemin de Plancenoit, he had dismounted in the mud, had had a kitchen table and a peasant's chair brought to him from the Rossomme farm, had sat down , with a bundle of straw for a carpet, and had laid out the map of the battlefield on the table, saying to Soult: Nice chessboard!","In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope at the corner of the Plancenoit road and had a kitchen table and a straw-bottomed chair brought to him from Rossomme farm, sat down with a truss of hay for a carpet and spread out on the table his map of the battlefield, saying to Soult, ‘A pretty chequerboard!’","In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an angle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant’s chair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with a truss of straw for a carpet, and spread out on the table the chart of the battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, “A pretty checker-board.”","In the morning, he alighted in the mud, upon the high bank at the corner of the road from Planchenoit, had a kitchen table and a peasant’s chair brought from the farm of Rossomme, sat down, with a bunch of straw for a carpet, and spread out upon the table the plan of the battle-field, saying to Soult: “Pretty chequer-board!”"
"Cependant les yeux plongeaient avidement par cette ouverture qui s’était faite dans ce lieu clos à tous les regards. Un vague profond enveloppait cette forme vêtue de deuil. Les yeux fouillaient ce vague et cherchaient à démêler ce qui était autour de l’apparition. Au bout de très peu de temps on s’apercevait qu’on ne voyait rien. Ce qu’on voyait, c’était la nuit, le vide, les ténèbres, une brume de l’hiver mêlée à une vapeur du tombeau, une sorte de paix effrayante, un silence où l’on ne recueillait rien, pas même des soupirs, une ombre où l’on ne distinguait rien, pas même des fantômes.","However, the eyes plunged avidly through this opening which had been made in this place closed to all eyes. A deep vagueness enveloped this form clothed in mourning. The eyes searched this vagueness and sought to unravel what was around the apparition. After a very short time we realized that we could not see anything. What we saw was night, emptiness, darkness, a mist of winter mingled with vapor from the tomb, a kind of frightening peace, a silence in which nothing could be gathered, not even sighs, a shadow in which nothing could be made out, not even ghosts.","All the same, you peered eagerly, through the gap that had opened up, into that place that was closed against all eyes. A deep obscurity surrounded the figure dressed in mourning. Your eyes probed the obscurity and tried to make out what was around the apparition. After a very short time you realized you could see nothing. What you saw was darkness, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mist combined with the atmosphere of the grave, a kind of terrifying peacefulness, a silence in which nothing was detectable, not even sighs, a gloom in which nothing was distinguishable, not even phantoms.","Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vagueness enveloped that form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that vagueness, and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition. At the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing. What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a silence from which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.","Meantime your eyes gazed eagerly, through this aperture thus opened, into this place closed against all observation. A deep obscurity enveloped this form thus clad in mourning. Your eyes strained into this obscurity, and sought to distinguish what was about the apparition. In a little while you perceived that you saw nothing. What you saw was night, void, darkness, a wintry mist mingled with a sepulchral vapour, a sort of terrifying quiet, a silence from which you distinguished nothing, not even sighs—a shade in which you discerned nothing, not even phantoms."

"Quant aux Bourbons, la guerre de 1823 leur fut fatale. Ils la prirent pour un succès. Ils ne virent point quel danger il y a à faire tuer une idée par une consigne. Ils se méprirent dans leur naïveté au point d’introduire dans leur établissement comme élément de force l’immense affaiblissement d’un crime. L’esprit de guet-apens entra dans leur politique. 1830 germa dans 1823. La campagne d’Espagne devint dans leurs conseils un argument pour les coups de force et pour les aventures de droit divin. La France, ayant rétabli el rey neto en Espagne, pouvait bien rétablir le roi absolu chez elle. Ils tombèrent dans cette redoutable erreur de prendre l’obéissance du soldat pour le consentement de la nation. Cette confiance-là perd les trônes. Il ne faut s’endormir, ni à l’ombre d’un mancenillier, ni à l’ombre d’une armée.","As for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them. They took it for a success. They did not see what danger there is in having an idea killed by instructions. They were mistaken in their naivety to the point of introducing into their establishment as an element of strength the immense weakening of a crime. The spirit of ambush entered into their policy. 1830 germinated in 1823. The Spanish campaign became in their councils an argument for coups de force and for adventures of divine right. France, having restored el rey neto in Spain, might well restore the absolute king at home. They fell into the terrible error of taking the obedience of the soldier for the consent of the nation. That confidence loses the thrones. You must not fall asleep, neither in the shade of a manchineel, nor in the shade of an army.","As for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was disastrous for them. They regarded it as a success. They did not see the danger that lies in suppressing an idea by decree. They were so mistaken in their naivety that they introduced into their institution as an element of strength the great undermining weakness of a crime. The spirit of machination entered their government. The seed of 1830 was sown in 1823. In their decision-making the Spanish campaign became an argument for the use of force and for divine-right initiatives. Having re-established el rey neto * in Spain, France could surely re-establish the absolute monarch at home. They fell into the dreadful error of mistaking the obedience of the soldier for the consent of the nation. That kind of misplaced confidence leads to the loss of thrones.

They did not see what danger there is in attempting to kill an idea by a military watchword. In their simplicity, they blundered to the extent of introducing into their establishment, as an element of strength, the immense enfeeblement of a crime. The spirit of ambuscade and lying in wait entered into their policy. The germ of 1830 was in 1823. The Spanish campaign became in their councils an argument on behalf of violent measures and intrigues in favour of divine right. France having restored el rey neto in Spain, could certainly restore the absolute monarchy at home. They fell into the tremendous error of mistaking the obedience of the soldier for the acquiescence of the nation. That fond delusion ruins thrones. It will not do to fall asleep either in the shade of a upas tree or in the shadow of an army."

"Toutes les faces des carrés anglais furent attaquées à la fois. Un tournoiement frénétique les enveloppa. Cette froide infanterie demeura impassible. Le premier rang, genou en terre, recevait les cuirassiers sur les bayonnettes, le second rang les fusillait ; derrière le second rang les canonniers chargeaient les pièces, le front du carré s’ouvrait, laissait passer une éruption de mitraille et se refermait. Les cuirassiers répondaient par l’écrasement. Leurs grands chevaux se cabraient, enjambaient les rangs, sautaient par-dessus les bayonnettes et tombaient, gigantesques, au milieu de ces quatre murs vivants. Les boulets faisaient des trouées dans les cuirassiers, les cuirassiers faisaient des brèches dans les carrés. Des files d’hommes disparaissaient broyées sous les chevaux.

The cuirassiers responded by crushing them. Their great horses reared, straddled the ranks, leaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, into the midst of these four living walls. The balls made holes in the cuirassiers, the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared crushed under the horses. Bayonets sank into the bellies of these centaurs.

"Le couvent du Petit-Picpus-Saint-Antoine emplissait presque entièrement le vaste trapèze qui résultait des intersections de la rue Polonceau, de la rue Droit-Mur, de la petite rue Picpus et de la ruelle condamnée nommée dans les vieux plans rue Aumarais. Ces quatre rues entouraient ce trapèze comme ferait un fossé. Le couvent se composait de plusieurs bâtiments et d’un jardin. Le bâtiment principal, pris dans son entier, était une juxtaposition de constructions hybrides qui, vues à vol d’oiseau, dessinaient assez exactement une potence posée sur le sol. Le grand bras de la potence occupait tout le tronçon de la rue Droit-Mur compris entre la petite rue Picpus et la rue Polonceau ; le petit bras était une haute, grise et sévère façade grillée qui regardait la petite rue Picpus ; la porte cochère no 62 en marquait l’extrémité. Vers le milieu de cette façade, la poussière et la cendre blanchissaient une vieille porte basse cintrée où les araignées faisaient leur toile et qui ne s’ouvrait qu’une heure ou deux le dimanche et aux rares occasions où le cercueil d’une religieuse sortait du couvent. C’était l’entrée publique de l’église. Le coude de la potence était une salle carrée qui servait d’office et que les religieuses nommaient la dépense. Dans le grand bras étaient les cellules des mères et des sœurs et le noviciat. Dans le petit bras les cuisines, le réfectoire, doublé du cloître, et l’église. Entre la porte no 62 et le coin de la ruelle fermée Aumarais était le pensionnat, qu’on ne voyait pas du dehors. Le reste du trapèze formait le jardin qui était beaucoup plus bas que le niveau de la rue Polonceau, ce qui faisait les murailles bien plus élevées encore au dedans qu’à l’extérieur. Le jardin, légèrement bombé, avait à son milieu, au sommet d’une butte, un beau sapin aigu et conique, duquel partaient, comme du rond-point à pique d’un bouclier, quatre grandes allées, et, disposées deux par deux dans les embranchements des grandes, huit petites, de façon que, si l’enclos eût été circulaire, le plan géométral des allées eût ressemblé à une croix posée sur une roue. Les allées, venant toutes aboutir aux murs très irréguliers du jardin, étaient de longueurs inégales. Elles étaient bordées de groseilliers. Au fond une allée de grands peupliers allait des ruines du vieux couvent, qui était à l’angle de la rue Droit-Mur, à la maison du petit couvent, qui était à l’angle de la ruelle Aumarais. En avant du petit couvent, il y avait ce qu’on intitulait le petit jardin. Qu’on ajoute à cet ensemble une cour, toutes sortes d’angles variés que faisaient les corps de logis intérieurs, des murailles de prison, pour toute perspective et pour tout voisinage la longue ligne noire de toits qui bordait l’autre côté de la rue Polonceau, et l’on pourra se faire une image complète de ce qu’était, il y a quarante-cinq ans, la maison des bernardines du Petit-Picpus. Cette sainte maison avait été bâtie précisément sur l’emplacement d’un jeu de paume fameux du quatorzième au seizième siècle qu’on appelait le tripot des onze mille diables.","The convent of Petit-Picpus-Saint-Antoine filled almost entirely the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersections of rue Polonceau, rue Droit-Mur, little rue Picpus and the condemned alley named rue Aumarais in the old plans. These four streets surrounded this trapezium like a ditch. The convent consisted of several buildings and a garden. The main building, taken in its entirety, was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which, seen from a bird's eye view, drew quite exactly a gallows resting on the ground. The large arm of the gallows occupied the entire section of the rue Droit-Mur between the little rue Picpus and the rue Polonceau; the little arm was a high, gray and severe grilled facade which looked down the little Rue Picpus; Porte Cochere No. 62 marked the end. About the middle of this facade, dust and ashes whitened an old low arched door where spiders made their web and which opened only for an hour or two on Sundays and on the rare occasions when the coffin of a nun came out. of the convent. This was the public entrance to the church. The elbow of the gallows was a square room which served as an office and which the nuns called the expenditure. In the large arm were the mothers' and sisters' cells and the novitiate. In the small arm the kitchens, the refectory, doubled by the cloister, and the church. Between Gate No. 62 and the corner of the closed Aumarais lane was the boarding school, which could not be seen from the outside. The rest of the trapezium formed the garden, which was much lower than the level of the rue Polonceau, which made the walls even higher inside than outside. The garden, slightly domed, had in its middle, at the top of a mound, a beautiful pointed and conical fir tree, from which started, as from the roundabout at the peak of a shield, four large paths, and, arranged two by two in the branches of the large ones, eight small ones, so that, if the enclosure had been circular, the geometric plan of the paths would have resembled a cross resting on a wheel. The paths, all leading to the very irregular walls of the garden, were of unequal lengths. They were lined with currant bushes. At the far end, an avenue of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the corner of the Rue Droit-Mur, to the house of the little convent, which was at the corner of the Aumarais lane. In front of the small convent, there was what was called the small garden. Add to this ensemble a courtyard, all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls, for all perspective and all neighborhood the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the rue Polonceau, and we can get a complete picture of what was, forty-five years ago, the house of the Bernardines of Petit-Picpus. This holy house had been built precisely on the site of a famous tennis court from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century which was called the gambling den of the eleven thousand devils.","The convent of Petit-Picpus-St-Antoine filled almost the whole of the vast quadrilateral marked out by the intersections of Rue Polonceau, Rue Droit-Mur, Petite-Rue-Picpus and the dead-end alleyway named on old maps as Rue Aumarais. These four streets surrounded this quadilateral like a moat. The convent consisted of several buildings and a garden. The main building, taken as a whole, was an assemblage of juxtaposed hybrid constructions that viewed from above had almost the exact shape of a gallows laid flat on the ground. The upright beam of the gallows occupied the whole of the stretch of Rue Droit-Mur between Petite-Rue-Picpus and Rue Polonceau. The short horizontal beam was a tall, grey, austere grilled façade on Petite-Rue-Picpus; carriage entrance no. 62 marked the end of it. Towards the centre of this façade was a low arched doorway, white with dust and ash, where spiders wove their webs and which opened only for an hour or two on Sundays and on the rare occasions when a nun’s coffin left the convent. This was the public entrance to the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a square room used as a storeroom, which the nuns called ‘the pantry’. In the main beam were the cells of the mothers, sisters and novices, in the short beam the kitchens, the refectory with the cloister behind it, and the church. Between entrance no. 62 and the corner of the closed-off Aumarais alleyway was the boarding-school, which could not be seen from without. The rest of the trapezoid quadrilateral formed the garden, which lay at a much lower level than Rue Polonceau. This meant the walls were a great deal higher on the inside than on the outside. The slightly cambered garden had at its centre on top of a mound a splendid fir tree, spiring and conical, from which radiated as from the peaked boss of a shield four wide paths, and laid out in pairs between the main radii were eight narrow paths, so that if the walled space had been circular the geometrical plan of these avenues and paths would have resembled a wheel overlaid with a cross. The paths, all ending at the very irregular walls of the garden, were of unequal length. They were bordered with currant bushes. At the bottom of the garden an avenue of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent at the corner of Rue Droit-Mur to the little convent building at the corner of the Aumarais alleyway. In front of the little convent was what was called ‘the little garden’. Add to this complex a courtyard, all kinds of various angles formed by the main buildings on the inside, prison-like walls, and for sole outlook and sole neighbourly presence the long black line of roofs bordering the other side of Rue Polonceau, and you will be able to form a complete mental picture of what the Bernardine convent of Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This saintly house was built on the very site of a famous real-tennis court, dating from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, that used to be called ‘the eleven thousand devils’ playground’.","The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the whole of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the Rue Polonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused lane, called Rue Aumarais on old plans. These four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat. The convent was composed of several buildings and a garden. The principal building, taken in its entirety, was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which, viewed from a bird’s-eye view, outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid flat on the ground. The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus and the Rue Polonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray, severe grated façade which faced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 marked its extremity. Towards the centre of this façade was a low, arched door, whitened with dust and ashes, where the spiders wove their webs, and which was open only for an hour or two on Sundays, and on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. This was the public entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants’ hall, and which the nuns called the buttery. In the main arm were the cells of the mothers, the sisters, and the novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, the refectory, backed up by the cloisters and the church. Between the door No. 62 and the corner of the closed Aumarais Lane, was the school, which was not visible from without. The remainder of the trapezium formed the garden, which was much lower than the level of the Rue Polonceau, which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside. The garden, which was slightly arched, had in its centre, on the summit of a hillock, a fine pointed and conical fir-tree, whence ran, as from the peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and, ranged by twos in between the branchings of these, eight small ones, so that, if the enclosure had been circular, the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel. As the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the garden, they were of unequal length. They were bordered with currant bushes. At the bottom, an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur to the house of the Little Convent, which was at the angle of the Aumarais Lane. In front of the Little Convent was what was called the little garden. To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard, all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue Polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis-ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, which was called the “tennis-ground of the eleven thousand devils.”","The convent of the Petit Picpus Saint Antoine almost entirely filled the large trapezium which was formed by the intersection of the Rue Polonceau, the Rue Droit Mur, the Petite Rue Picpus, and the built-up alley called in the old plans Rue Aumarais. These four streets surrounded this trapezium like a ditch. The convent was composed of several buildings and a garden. The principal building, taken as a whole, was an aggregation of hybrid constructions which, in a bird’s-eye view, presented with considerable accuracy the form of a gibbet laid down on the ground. The long arm of the gibbet extended along the whole portion of the Rue Droit Mur comprised between the Petite Rue Picpus and the Rue Polonceau; the short arm was a high, grey, severe, grated façade which overlooked the Petite Rue Picpus; the porte-cochère, No. 62, marked the end of it. Towards the middle of this façade, the dust and ashes had whitened an old low-arched door where the spiders made their webs, and which was opened only for an hour or two on Sunday and on the rare occasions when the corpse of a nun was taken out of the convent. It was the public entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which served as pantry, and which the nuns called the expense. In the long arm were the cells of the mothers, sisters and novices. In the short arm were the kitchens, the refectory, lined with cells, and the church. Between the door, No. 62, and the corner of the closed alley Aumarais, was the school, which could not be seen from the outside. The rest of the trapezium formed the garden, which was much lower than the level of the Rue Polonceau, so that the walls were considerably higher on the inside than on the outside. The garden, which was slightly convex, had in the centre, on the top of a knoll, a beautiful fir, pointed and conical, from which parted, as from the centre of a buckler, four broad walks, and, arranged two by two between the broad walks, eight narrow ones, so that, if the inclosure had been circular, the geometrical plan of the walks would have resembled a cross placed over a wheel. The walks, all extending to the very irregular walls of the garden, were of unequal length. They were bordered with gooseberry bushes. At the further end of the garden a row of large poplars extended from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the corner of the Rue Droit Mur, to the house of the Little Convent, which was at the corner of the alley Aumarais. Before the Little Convent, was what was called the Little Garden. Add to this outline a courtyard, all manner of angles made by detached buildings, prison walls, no prospect and no neighbourhood, but the long black line of roofs which ran along the other side of the Rue Polonceau, and you can form a complete image of what was, forty-five years ago, the house of the Bernardines of the Petit Picpus. This holy house had been built on the exact site of a famous tennis-court, which existed from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, and which was called the court of the eleven thousand devils."

L’écroulement de l’ancienne société française, la chute de sa propre famille, les tragiques spectacles de 93, plus effrayants encore peut-être pour les émigrés qui les voyaient de loin avec le grossissement de l’épouvante, firent-ils germer en lui des idées de renoncement et de solitude ?

What happened next in M. Myriel's destiny? The collapse of the old French society, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of 1993, even more frightening perhaps for the emigrants who saw them from afar with the magnification of terror, did they germinate in him ideas of renunciation and solitude? Was he, in the midst of one of those distractions and affections which occupied his life, suddenly struck down by one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overthrow, by striking him in the heart, the man whom public catastrophes would not shake by striking him in his existence and in his fortune?

The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of ’93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,—did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him?

"Le péril de cette position était la forêt de Soignes, alors contiguë au champ de bataille et coupée par les étangs de Groenendael et de Boitsfort.

In the opinion of a number of experts, disputed by others, any retreat here would have been a rout.","The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes, then adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of Groenendael and Boitsfort.

"L’évêque n’était pas ému comme il semble qu’il aurait pu l’être. Il ne croyait pas sentir Dieu dans cette façon de mourir ; disons tout, car les petites contradictions des grands cœurs veulent être indiquées comme le reste, lui qui, dans l’occasion, riait si volontiers de Sa Grandeur, il était quelque peu choqué de ne pas être appelé monseigneur, et il était presque tenté de répliquer : citoyen. Il lui vint une velléité de familiarité bourrue, assez ordinaire aux médecins et aux prêtres, mais qui ne lui était pas habituelle, à lui. Cet homme, après tout, ce conventionnel, ce représentant du peuple, avait été un puissant de la terre ; pour la première fois de sa vie peut-être, l’évêque se sentit en humeur de sévérité.","The bishop was not moved as it seems he could have been. He did not believe he felt God in this way of dying; let us say everything, for the small contradictions of great hearts want to be indicated like the rest, he who, on the occasion, laughed so willingly at His Greatness, he was somewhat shocked at not being called monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to reply: citizen. There came to him a craving for gruff familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but not usual to him. This man, after all, this conventional, this representative of the people, had been a powerful man of the earth; for the first time in his life, perhaps, the bishop felt himself in a mood of severity.","The bishop was not affected by this as might have been expected. He did not think there was any sense of God in this manner of dying. To tell the whole truth, for the little inconsistencies of the great-hearted need to be signalled like everything else: he who was so quick to laugh at His Highness, when the occasion arose, was rather shocked not to be addressed as Monseigneur and was almost tempted to reply ‘citizen’. He had an inclination to be ungraciously familiar, which was common enough in doctors and priests but not typical of him. After all, this man, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the mighty of this world. For perhaps the first time in his life the bishop felt in the mood to be stern.","The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at “His Grace,” was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort “citizen.” He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.","The bishop was not as much affected as he might have been: it was not his idea of godly death; we must tell all for the little inconsistencies of great souls should be mentioned; he who had laughed so heartily at “His Highness,” was still slightly shocked at not being called monseigneur, and was almost tempted to answer “citizen.” He felt a desire to use the brusque familiarity common enough with doctors and priests, but which was not customary with him.

"Le jardin, un peu gâté par les constructions assez laides dont nous avons parlé, se composait de quatre allées en croix rayonnant autour d’un puisard ; une autre allée faisait tout le tour du jardin et cheminait le long du mur blanc dont il était enclos. Ces allées laissaient entre elles quatre carrés bordés de buis. Dans trois, madame Magloire cultivait des légumes ; dans le quatrième, l’évêque avait mis des fleurs. Il y avait çà et là quelques arbres fruitiers. Une fois madame Magloire lui avait dit avec une sorte de malice douce : ― Monseigneur, vous qui tirez parti de tout, voilà pourtant un carré inutile.

Deux noms prévus par La Fontaine. L’occasion était trop belle pour que la basoche n’en fît point gorge chaude. Tout de suite la parodie courut, en vers, quelque peu boiteux, les galeries du palais :","The collectors of small facts, who make herbaria of anecdotes and who prick fleeting dates into their memory with a pin, know that there were in Paris, in the last century, around 1770, two prosecutors at the Châtelet, called, one Raven, the other Fox.

Immediately the parody ran, in verse, somewhat lamely, through the galleries of the palace:","Collectors of trivial information who compile herbariums of anecdotes and retain elusive dates in their memories by sticking them with a pin, know that during the last century, around 1770, there were in Paris two lawyers at the Châtelet, one named Corbeau, the other Renard.

The two names had been forestalled by La Fontaine. The opportunity was too fine for the lawyers; they made the most of it. A parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the court-house, in verses that limped a little:—","The “gatherers-up of unconsidered trifles” who collect anecdotes as the herbalist his simples, and prick the fleeting dates upon their memories with a pin, know that there lived in Paris, in the last century, about 1770, two attorneys of the Châtelet, one named Corbeau and the other Renard—two names, anticipated by La Fontaine. The chance for a joke was altogether too fine a one to be let slip by the goodly company of lawyers’ clerks.

"Tout en convenant que ce n’était point pour une fonction politique que Dieu avait créé monseigneur Bienvenu, nous eussions compris et admiré la protestation au nom du droit et de la liberté, l’opposition fière, la résistance périlleuse et juste à Napoléon tout-puissant. Mais ce qui nous plaît vis-à-vis de ceux qui montent nous plaît moins vis-à-vis de ceux qui tombent. Nous n’aimons le combat que tant qu’il y a danger ; et, dans tous les cas, les combattants de la première heure ont seuls le droit d’être les exterminateurs de la dernière. Qui n’a pas été accusateur opiniâtre pendant la prospérité doit se taire devant l’écroulement. Le dénonciateur du succès est le seul légitime justicier de la chute. Quant à nous, lorsque la providence s’en mêle et frappe, nous la laissons faire. 1812 commence à nous désarmer. En 1813, la lâche rupture de silence de ce corps législatif taciturne enhardi par les catastrophes n’avait que de quoi indigner, et c’était un tort d’applaudir ; en 1814, devant ces maréchaux trahissant, devant ce sénat passant d’une fange à l’autre, insultant après avoir divinisé, devant cette idolâtrie lâchant pied et crachant sur l’idole, c’était un devoir de détourner la tête ; en 1815, comme les suprêmes désastres étaient dans l’air, comme la France avait le frisson de leur approche sinistre, comme on pouvait vaguement distinguer Waterloo ouvert devant Napoléon, la douloureuse acclamation de l’armée et du peuple au condamné du destin n’avait rien de risible, et, toute réserve faite sur le despote, un cœur comme l’évêque de Digne n’eût peut-être pas dû méconnaître ce qu’avait d’auguste et de touchant, au bord de l’abîme, l’étroit embrassement d’une grande nation et d’un grand homme.","While agreeing that it was not for a political function that God had created Monseigneur Bienvenu, we would have understood and admired the protest in the name of right and freedom, the proud opposition, the perilous and just resistance to Napoleon as a whole. powerful. But what pleases us vis-à-vis those who rise pleases us less vis-à-vis those who fall. We only like the fight as long as there is danger; and, in any case, the combatants of the first hour alone have the right to be the exterminators of the last. Whoever was not a stubborn accuser during prosperity must be silent in the face of collapse. The informant of success is the only legitimate vigilante of the fall. As for us, when providence steps in and strikes, we let it. 1812 begins to disarm us. In 1813, the cowardly breaking of silence of this taciturn legislative body emboldened by catastrophes had nothing but cause for indignation, and it was a mistake to applaud; in 1814, before these betraying marshals, before this senate passing from one mire to another, insulting after having deified, before this idolatry letting go and spitting on the idol, it was a duty to turn away one's head; in 1815, as supreme disasters were in the air, as France thrilled at their sinister approach, as Waterloo could be vaguely distinguished open before Napoleon, the painful acclamation of the army and the people at the condemned fate was nothing laughable, and, all reservations made about the despot, a heart like the Bishop of Digne should perhaps not have failed to recognize what was august and touching, on the edge of the abyss, the close embrace of a great nation and a great man.","While granting it was not for political office that God created Monseigneur Bienvenu, we might have understood and admired in him protest in the name of legality and liberty, proud opposition, legitimate but perilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But what pleases us in the treatment of those on their way up is less pleasing in the treatment of those on their way down. We approve of fighting only so long as there is danger, and in any case only those who fought in the first instance have the right to be exterminators at the last. He who has not been a persistent opponent in times of prosperity should remain silent when the downfall comes. Challenging success gives the only legitimacy to prosecuting failure. For our own part, when Providence intervenes, let it strike where it will. The year 1812 starts to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence on the part of a reticent legislative body emboldened by catastrophe was worthy of nothing but indignation, and it was wrong to applaud it. In 1814, confronted with those treacherous marshals, with that Senate going from one baseness to the next, disparaging the once deified, with that idolatry in retreat spitting on its idol, it was a moral obligation to avert one’s gaze. In 1815, when ultimate disaster was in the air, when France shuddered at its sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly discerned lying in wait for Napoleon, there was nothing derisory about the mournful cheers from the army and from the people for the man destined to fall. And with all due reservation with regard to the despot, a man of such sensibility as the bishop of Digne should not perhaps have failed to recognize what was noble and affecting in the close embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of ruin.","While admitting that it was not for a political office that God created Monseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but perilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling. We only love the fray so long as there is danger, and in any case, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last. He who has not been a stubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. As for us, when Providence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812 commenced to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits which aroused indignation. And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in the presence of those marshals who betrayed; in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another, insulting after having deified; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol,—it was a duty to turn aside the head. In 1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it, and, after making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of the Bishop of D——, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss.","Although we hold that it was not for a political function that God created Monseigneur Bienvenu, we could have understood and admired a protest in the name of right and liberty, a fierce opposition, a perilous and just resistance to Napoleon when he was all-powerful. But what is pleasing to us towards those who are rising, is less pleasing towards those who are falling. We do not admire the combat when there is no danger, and in any case, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators in the last. He who has not been a determined accuser during prosperity, ought to hold his peace in the presence of adversity. He only who denounces the success at one time has a right to proclaim the justice of the downfall. As for ourselves, when providence intervened and struck the blow, we took no part; 1812 began to disarm us. In 1813, the cowardly breach of silence on the part of that taciturn corps Legislatif, emboldened by catastrophe, was worthy only of indignation, and it was base to applaud it; in 1814, from those traitorous marshals, from that senate passing from one baseness to another, insulting where they had deified, from that idolatry recoiling and spitting upon its idol, it was a duty to turn away in disgust; in 1815, when the air was filled with the final disasters, when France felt the thrill of their sinister approach, when Waterloo could already be dimly perceived opening before Napoleon, the sorrowful acclamations of the army and of the people to the condemned of destiny, were no subjects for laughter; and making every reservation as to the despot, a heart like that of the Bishop of D—— ought not perhaps to have refused to see what was august and touching, on the brink of the abyss, in the last embrace of a great nation and a great man."

On a vu qu’à Paris « il n’avait pas pris ». Pas un avenir ne songeait à se greffer sur ce vieillard solitaire. Pas une ambition en herbe ne faisait la folie de verdir à son ombre. Ses chanoines et ses grands vicaires étaient de bons vieux hommes, un peu peuple comme lui, murés comme lui dans ce diocèse sans issue sur le cardinalat, et qui ressemblaient à leur évêque, avec cette différence qu’eux étaient finis, et que lui était achevé. On sentait si bien l’impossibilité de croître près de monseigneur Bienvenu qu’à peine sortis du séminaire, les jeunes gens ordonnés par lui se faisaient recommander aux archevêques d’Aix ou d’Auch, et s’en allaient bien vite. Car enfin, nous le répétons, on veut être poussé. Un saint qui vit dans un accès d’abnégation est un voisinage dangereux ; il pourrait bien vous communiquer par contagion une pauvreté incurable, l’ankylose des articulations utiles à l’avancement, et, en somme, plus de renoncement que vous n’en voulez ; et l’on fuit cette vertu galeuse. De là l’isolement de monseigneur Bienvenu. Nous vivons dans une société sombre. Réussir, voilà l’enseignement qui tombe goutte à goutte de la corruption en surplomb.","Monseigneur Bienvenu, humble, poor, particular, was not counted among the great mitres. This was visible in the complete absence of young priests around him. We have seen that in Paris “he had not taken”. Not a future dreamed of grafting itself onto this solitary old man. Not a budding ambition was foolish enough to grow green in its shadow. His canons and grand vicars were good old men, a little people like him, walled up like him in this diocese with no way out of the cardinalate, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference that they were finished, and that he was completed. The impossibility of growing up close to Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well felt that as soon as they left the seminary, the young people ordained by him were recommended to the archbishops of Aix or Auch, and left very quickly. Because finally, we repeat it, we want to be pushed. A saint who lives in a fit of self-sacrifice is a dangerous neighborhood; he could well communicate to you by contagion an incurable poverty, the ankylosis of the joints useful for advancement, and, in short, more renunciation than you want; and we flee this mangy virtue. Hence the isolation of Monsignor Bienvenu. We live in a dark society. Succeeding is the lesson that trickles down from the overhanging corruption.","Humble, poor, untypical, Monseigneur Bienvenu was not one of the big mitres. This was obvious from the complete absence of young priests about him. We have seen that he ‘did not get on’ in Paris. Not one clerical future dreamed of grafting itself on to this solitary old man. Not a single sprouting ambition was so foolish as to grow in his shade. His canons and vicars-general were good-hearted old men, of rather humble origin like him, like him cut off in this diocese that led to no cardinalship – with this difference in their resemblance to their bishop: they were finished, he was fulfilled. So well did they sense the impossibility of prospering with Monseigneur Bienvenu that no sooner had the young men ordained by him left the seminary than they would obtain a recommendation to the archbishop of Aix or of Auch and be off very quickly. For after all, we say it again, a man wants to be brought on. A saint who lives an excessively self-denying life makes a dangerous neighbour. He might pass on to you through infectiousness an incurable poverty, a stiffening of those joints useful for self-advancement, and in short more self-denial than you want. And people flee this contagious virtue. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in a dismal society. Succeed – that is the lesson drip-dripping down from the corruption at the top.","Monseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among the big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him. We have seen that he “did not take” in Paris. Not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man. Not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished and he was completed. The impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed. A saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in advancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.","Monseigneur Bienvenu, an humble, poor, private person, was not counted among the rich mitres. This was plain from the entire absence of young priests about him. We have seen that at Paris “he did not take.” No glorious future dreamed of alighting upon this solitary old man. No young ambition was foolish enough to ripen in his shadow. His canons and his grand-vicars were good old men, rather common like himself, and like him immured in that diocese from which there was no road to promotion, and they resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished, and he was perfected. The impossibility of getting on under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so plain, that as soon as they were out of the seminary, the young men ordained by him procured recommendations to the Archbishop of Aix or of Auch, and went immediately to present them. For, we repeat, men like advancement. A saint who is addicted to abnegation is a dangerous neighbour; he is very likely to communicate to you by contagion an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the articulations necessary to advancement, and, in fact, more renunciation than you would like; and men flee from this contagious virtue. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in a sad society. Succeed; that is the advice which falls drop by drop, from the overhanging corruption."

This Tryphon was buried in the abbey of St. Georges de Bocherville, near Rouen, and toads are produced from his grave."

"Aussi l’impression fut-elle horrible et profonde ; le lendemain de l’exécution et beaucoup de jours encore après, l’évêque parut accablé. La sérénité presque violente du moment funèbre avait disparu ; le fantôme de la justice sociale l’obsédait. Lui qui d’ordinaire revenait de toutes ses actions avec une satisfaction si rayonnante, il semblait qu’il se fît un reproche. Par moments, il se parlait à lui-même, et bégayait à demi-voix des monologues lugubres. En voici un que sa sœur entendit un soir et recueillit : ― Je ne croyais pas que cela fût si monstrueux. C’est un tort de s’absorber dans la loi divine au point de ne plus s’apercevoir de la loi humaine. La mort n’appartient qu’à Dieu. De quel droit les hommes touchent-ils à cette chose inconnue ?","So the impression was horrible and profound; the day after the execution and many days after, the bishop seemed overwhelmed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the ghost of social justice obsessed him. He who usually returned from all his actions with such radiant satisfaction, it seemed as if he were reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and stammered mournful monologues in a low voice. Here is one that his sister heard one evening and picked up: ―I didn't think it was so monstrous. It is a mistake to become absorbed in divine law to the point of no longer perceiving human law. Death belongs only to God. By what right do men touch this unknown thing?",So it left a deep and horrible impression. The day after the execution and for many days afterwards the bishop seemed devastated. Gone was that almost fierce serenity he had had at the fateful moment. The phantom of social justice haunted him. He who generally returned from everything he did with such radiant satisfaction seemed to reproach himself. At times he talked to himself and muttered lugubrious monologues under his breath. This is one which his sister overheard one evening and recorded: ‘I didn’t realize it was so monstrous. It’s wrong to be so deeply absorbed in divine law that you become unaware of human law. Death depends on God alone. By what right do men meddle with this matter of destiny?’,"Therefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day following the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him. He, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved: “I did not think that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs to God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?”","Thus the impression was horrible and deep, on the morrow of the execution, and for many days, the bishop appeared to be overwhelmed. The almost violent calmness of the fatal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice took possession of him. He, who ordinarily looked back upon all his actions with a satisfaction so radiant, now seemed to be a subject of self-reproach. By times he would talk to himself, and in an undertone mutter dismal monologues. One evening his sister overheard and preserved the following: “I did not believe that it could be so monstrous. It is wrong to be so absorbed in the divine law as not to perceive the human law. Death belongs to God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?”"
"La poupée est un des plus impérieux besoins et en même temps un des plus charmants instincts de l’enfance féminine.

"Ces classes de femmes sont entièrement remises par nos lois à la discrétion de la police. Elle en fait ce qu’elle veut, les punit comme bon lui semble, et confisque à son gré ces deux tristes choses qu’elles appellent leur industrie et leur liberté. Javert était impassible ; son visage sérieux ne trahissait aucune émotion. Pourtant il était gravement et profondément préoccupé. C’était un de ces moments où il exerçait sans contrôle, mais avec tous les scrupules d’une conscience sévère, son redoutable pouvoir discrétionnaire. En cet instant, il le sentait, son escabeau d’agent de police était un tribunal. Il jugeait. Il jugeait et il condamnait. Il appelait tout ce qu’il pouvait avoir d’idées dans l’esprit autour de la grande chose qu’il faisait. Plus il examinait le fait de cette fille, plus il se sentait révolté. Il était évident qu’il venait de voir commettre un crime. Il venait de voir, là dans la rue, la société, représentée par un propriétaire-électeur, insultée et attaquée par une créature en dehors de tout. Une prostituée avait attenté à un bourgeois. Il avait vu cela, lui Javert. Il écrivait en silence.","These classes of women are entirely handed over by our laws to the discretion of the police. She does with them what she wants, punishes them as she sees fit, and confiscates at will these two sad things which she calls their industry and their freedom. Javert was impassive; his serious face betrayed no emotion. Yet he was gravely and deeply concerned. It was one of those moments when he exercised without control, but with all the scruples of a severe conscience, his formidable discretionary power. In that moment, he felt, his policeman's stool was a court. He was judging. He judged and he condemned. He was calling whatever ideas he could have in his mind around the great thing that he was doing. The more he examined the fact of this girl, the more he felt revolted. It was obvious that he had just seen a crime committed. He had just seen, there in the street, society, represented by an proprietor-voter, insulted and attacked by a creature outside of everything. A prostitute had attacked a bourgeois. He had seen that, he Javert. He wrote in silence.","Under our laws women of this social category are placed entirely in the hands of the police. The latter do with them what they please, punish them as they see fit and confiscate at will those two sad things the women call their trade and their freedom. Javert was impassive. His solemn face betrayed no emotion. Yet he was seriously and deeply preoccupied. It was one of those moments when he was exercising his formidable discretionary powers, with no one to answer to but with all the scruples of an exacting conscience. At that moment, he felt, the policeman’s stool he sat on was a judge’s bench. He was sitting in judgement. He was sitting in judgement, and he was passing sentence. He summoned up every conceivable thought he might have about the great thing he was doing. The more he considered this woman’s deed, the more outraged he felt. It was evident he had just witnessed a crime being committed. He had just seen society, represented by an enfranchised property owner, insulted and attacked out there in the street by a creature totally beyond the pale. A prostitute had assaulted a respectable citizen. He, Javert, had seen this. He wrote in silence.","This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems good to them, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty.

It was one of those moments when he was exercising without control, but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience, his redoubtable discretionary power. At that moment he was conscious that his police agent’s stool was a tribunal. He was entering judgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he was doing. The more he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt. It was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime. He had just beheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a freeholder and an elector, insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales. A prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen. He had seen that, he, Javert. He wrote in silence.","These women are placed by our laws completely under the discretion of the police.

It was clear that he had seen a crime committed.

"Quand Jean Valjean était sorti de chez l’évêque, on l’a vu, il était hors de tout ce qui avait été sa pensée jusque-là. Il ne pouvait se rendre compte de ce qui se passait en lui. Il se roidissait contre l’action angélique et contre les douces paroles du vieillard. « Vous m’avez promis de devenir honnête homme. Je vous achète votre âme. Je la retire à l’esprit de perversité et je la donne au bon Dieu. » Cela lui revenait sans cesse. Il opposait à cette indulgence céleste l’orgueil, qui est en nous comme la forteresse du mal. Il sentait indistinctement que le pardon de ce prêtre était le plus grand assaut et la plus formidable attaque dont il eût encore été ébranlé ; que son endurcissement serait définitif s’il résistait à cette clémence ; que, s’il cédait, il faudrait renoncer à cette haine dont les actions des autres hommes avaient rempli son âme pendant tant d’années, et qui lui plaisait ; que cette fois il fallait vaincre ou être vaincu, et que la lutte, une lutte colossale et définitive, était engagée entre sa méchanceté à lui et la bonté de cet homme.","When Jean Valjean had left the bishop's house, as we have seen, he was beyond all that had been his thoughts until then. He couldn't realize what was going on inside him. He stiffened himself against the angelic action and against the gentle words of the old man. “You promised me to become an honest man. I buy your soul from you. I withdraw it from the spirit of perversity and I give it to the good Lord. It kept coming back to him. He opposed this celestial indulgence with pride, which is in us like the fortress of evil. He felt indiscriminately that the forgiveness of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack by which he had yet been shaken; that his hardening would be final if he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded, he would have to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul for so many years, and which pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or be conquered, and that the struggle, a colossal and definitive struggle, was engaged between his own wickedness and the goodness of this man.","When Jean Valjean left the bishop’s house he was, as we have seen, in what was to him an entirely different mental universe. He could not understand what was going on inside him. He hardened himself against the old man’s angelic deed and gentle words. ‘You promised to become an honest man. I’m buying your soul. I’m redeeming it from the spirit of iniquity and giving it to the good Lord.’ This kept coming back to him. This heavenly kindness he countered with pride – the fortress of evil, as it were, within us. He had the indistinct feeling that this priest’s forgiveness was the greatest assault and most tremendous attack he had ever experienced. That if he resisted this clemency the hardening of his heart would be definitive. That if he yielded he would be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the deeds of other men had filled his soul over so many years, a hatred he relished. That this time he had to vanquish or be vanquished, and that the battle had been joined, a colossal and decisive battle, between his own wickedness and that man’s goodness.","When Jean Valjean left the Bishop’s house, he was, as we have seen, quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man. “You have promised me to become an honest man. I buy your soul. I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the good God.” This recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness he opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and which pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.","When Jean Valjean left the bishop’s house, as we have seen, his mood was one that he had never known before. He could understand nothing of what was passing within him. He set himself stubbornly in opposition to the angelic deeds and the gentle words of the old man, “you have promised me to become an honest man. I am purchasing your soul, I withdraw it from the spirit of perversity and I give it to God Almighty.” This came back to him incessantly. To this celestial tenderness, he opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil in man. He felt dimly that the pardon of this priest was the hardest assault, and the most formidable attack which he had yet sustained; that his hardness of heart would be complete, if it resisted this kindness; that if he yielded, he must renounce that hatred with which the acts of other men had for so many years filled his soul, and in which he found satisfaction; that, this time, he must conquer or be conquered, and that the struggle, a gigantic and decisive struggle, had begun between his own wickedness, and the goodness of this man."

But how on earth did you get in here?’","However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling all over:— “Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you enter? Dieu-Jésus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no trouble about that: if ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you are in! You have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat!

"Il paraît que, tout en allant faire quelques provisions pour le souper, madame Magloire avait entendu dire des choses en divers lieux. On parlait d’un rôdeur de mauvaise mine ; qu’un vagabond suspect serait arrivé, qu’il devait être quelque part dans la ville, et qu’il se pourrait qu’il y eût de méchantes rencontres pour ceux qui s’aviseraient de rentrer tard chez eux cette nuit-là. Que la police était bien mal faite du reste, attendu que M. le préfet et M. le maire ne s’aimaient pas, et cherchaient à se nuire en faisant arriver des événements. Que c’était donc aux gens sages à faire la police eux-mêmes et à se bien garder, et qu’il faudrait avoir soin de dûment clore, verrouiller et barricader sa maison, et de bien fermer ses portes.","It seems that, while going to buy some provisions for supper, Madame Magloire had heard things said in various places. There was talk of a prowler of bad looks; that a suspicious vagabond had arrived, that he must be somewhere in town, and that there might be nasty encounters for those who dared to go home late that night. That the police were very badly done, moreover, since the prefect and the mayor did not like each other, and sought to harm each other by causing events to happen. That it was therefore up to wise people to police themselves and to guard themselves well, and that care should be taken to duly close, lock and barricade one's house, and to close its doors well.","Apparently, while doing a little shopping for supper, Madame Magloire had heard rumours in various places. There was talk of some sinister-looking individual prowling around; according to which, some suspicious vagrant had turned up, he was bound to be somewhere in the town, and there could well be some nasty encounters in store for those who might take it into their heads to go home late that night. And the police were not to be relied on, given that the prefect and the mayor did not get on and tried to discredit each other by provoking incidents. So it was up to law-abiding folk to do the work of the police and to protect themselves, and they should make sure they closed up properly, and bolted and barred their houses, and locked their doors securely.","It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, Madame Magloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because there was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injure each other by making things happen. It behooved wise people to play the part of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and care must be taken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and to fasten the doors well.","It seems that while Madame Magloire was out making provision for supper, she had heard the news in sundry places. There was talk that an ill-favoured runaway, a suspicious vagabond, had arrived and was lurking somewhere in the town, and that some unpleasant adventures might befall those who should come home late that night; besides, that the police was very bad, as the prefect and the mayor did not like one another, and were hoping to injure each other by untoward events; that it was the part of wise people to be their own police, and to protect their own persons; and that every one ought to be careful to shut up, bolt, and bar his house properly, and secure his door thoroughly."

"Le flamand appela sa femme, et lui conta la chose. Où diable monsieur le maire peut-il aller ? Ils tinrent conseil. ― Il va à Paris, dit la femme. ― Je ne crois pas, dit le mari. M.

"Quand l’homme à la redingote jaune eut dépisté l’agent, il doubla le pas, non sans s’être retourné bien des fois pour s’assurer qu’il n’était pas suivi. A quatre heures un quart, c’est-à-dire à la nuit close, il passait devant le théâtre de la porte Saint-Martin où l’on donnait ce jour-là les deux Forçats. Cette affiche, éclairée par les réverbères du théâtre, le frappa, car, quoiqu’il marchât vite, il s’arrêta pour la lire.

At a quarter past four, that is to say, at nightfall, he passed in front of the theater at the Porte Saint-Martin, where the two Convicts were being performed that day. This poster, lit by the streetlights of the theatre, struck him, for, although he was walking quickly, he stopped to read it. A moment later he was in the cul-de-sac of the Planchette, and he entered the Plat d'étin, where the office of Lagny's carriage was then. This car left at half past four. The horses were harnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, hurriedly scaled the high iron staircase of the cuckoo clock.","When the man in the yellow frock-coat had given the policeman the slip, he quickened his pace, not without having looked round many times to reassure himself he was not being followed.

"Il est certain que Napoléon fit des fautes dans la guerre de Russie, qu’Alexandre fit des fautes dans la guerre de l’Inde, que César fit des fautes dans la guerre d’Afrique, que Cyrus fit des fautes dans la guerre de Scythie, et que Javert fit des fautes dans cette campagne contre Jean Valjean. Il eut tort peut-être d’hésiter à reconnaître l’ancien galérien. Le premier coup d’œil aurait dû lui suffire. Il eut tort de ne pas l’appréhender purement et simplement dans la masure. Il eut tort de ne pas l’arrêter quand il le reconnut positivement rue de Pontoise. Il eut tort de se concerter avec ses auxiliaires en plein clair de lune dans le carrefour Rollin. Certes les avis sont utiles, et il est bon de connaître et d’interroger ceux des chiens qui méritent créance ; mais le chasseur ne saurait prendre trop de précautions quand il chasse des animaux inquiets, comme le loup et le forçat. Javert, en se préoccupant trop de mettre les limiers de meute sur la voie, alarma la bête en lui donnant vent du trait et la fit partir. Il eut tort surtout, dès qu’il eut retrouvé la piste au pont d’Austerlitz, de jouer ce jeu formidable et puéril de tenir un pareil homme au bout d’un fil. Il s’estima plus fort qu’il n’était, et crut pouvoir jouer à la souris avec un lion. En même temps, il s’estima trop faible quand il jugea nécessaire de s’adjoindre du renfort. Précaution fatale, perte d’un temps précieux. Javert commit toutes ces fautes, et n’en était pas moins un des espions les plus savants et les plus corrects qui aient existé. Il était, dans toute la force du terme, ce qu’en vénerie on appelle un chien sage. Mais qui est-ce qui est parfait ?","It is certain that Napoleon made mistakes in the Russian war, that Alexander made mistakes in the Indian war, that Caesar made mistakes in the African war, that Cyrus made mistakes in the Scythian war. , and that Javert made mistakes in this campaign against Jean Valjean.

He was wrong not to stop him when he positively recognized him in the Rue de Pontoise. He was wrong to consult with his auxiliaries in full moonlight in the Rollin crossroads. Certainly opinions are useful, and it is good to know and to question those of the dogs which deserve credence; but the hunter cannot take too many precautions when he hunts restless animals, like the wolf and the convict. Javert, being too preoccupied with putting the hounds of the pack on the track, alarmed the beast by giving it wind of the dart and sent it off. Above all, he was wrong, as soon as he found the trail at the Pont d'Austerlitz, to play this formidable and childish game of holding such a man at the end of a thread. He considered himself stronger than he was, and thought he could play mouse with a lion. At the same time, he considered himself too weak when he deemed it necessary to enlist reinforcements. Fatal precaution, loss of precious time. Javert committed all these faults, and was none the less one of the most learned and correct spies that ever existed.

He was wrong not to detain him when he positively identified him in Rue de Pontoise. He was wrong to confer with his aides in Carrefour Rollin in full moonlight. Certainly expert advice is useful, and it is a good thing to know which dogs can be relied on, and to look to them. But the huntsman cannot afford to take too many precautions when hunting nervous animals like the fox and the convict. Too anxious to set a pack of bloodhounds on the trail, Javert alerted the beast by letting it get wind of them and caused it to bolt. Most of all, when he picked up the scent again on the Pont d’Austerlitz he was wrong to play that dreadful and childish game of teasing, keeping such a man on the end of a line. He overestimated himself by thinking he could play cat-and-mouse with a lion. At the same time he underestimated himself by deeming it necessary to recruit back-up. A fatal precaution, a waste of precious time! Javert made all these mistakes, yet was one of the cleverest and most competent spies that ever existed.

He was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin.

"Au bout d’une centaine de pas, après avoir longé un mur du quinzième siècle surmonté d’un pignon aigu à briques contrariées, il se trouva en présence d’une grande porte de pierre cintrée, avec imposte rectiligne, dans le grave style de Louis XIV, accostée de deux médaillons plans. Une façade sévère dominait cette porte ; un mur perpendiculaire à la façade venait presque toucher la porte et la flanquait d’un brusque angle droit. Sur le pré devant la porte gisaient trois herses à travers lesquelles poussaient pêle-mêle toutes les fleurs de mai. La porte était fermée. Elle avait pour clôture deux battants décrépits ornés d’un vieux marteau rouillé.","After about a hundred paces, after skirting a fifteenth-century wall surmounted by a pointed gable with contrasting bricks, he found himself in the presence of a large arched stone door, with a rectilinear fanlight, in the grave style of Louis XIV, accosted by two flat medallions.

On the meadow in front of the door lay three portcullises through which all the Mayflowers grew pell-mell. The door was closed. Its fence was two decrepit gates adorned with an old rusty hammer.","Some one hundred yards along it, after skirting a fifteenth-century wall capped with pitched coping of crenellated brick, he found himself in the presence of a big stone gateway with a lintel in the sober style of Louis XIV, flanked by two flat medallions. An austere façade rose above this gateway. A wall perpendicular to the façade came almost up to the gateway at an abrupt right-angle just to one side of it. In the grass in front of the gateway lay three harrows with all the May flowers growing haphazardly among them. The gateway was closed. The gates themselves were two dilapidated panels bearing a rusty old knocker.","After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenth century, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, he found himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinear impost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat medallions.

"Disons-le en passant, être aveugle et être aimé, c’est en effet, sur cette terre où rien n’est complet, une des formes les plus étrangement exquises du bonheur. Avoir continuellement à ses côtés une femme, une fille, une sœur, un être charmant, qui est là parce que vous avez besoin d’elle et parce qu’elle ne peut se passer de vous, se savoir indispensable à qui nous est nécessaire, pouvoir incessamment mesurer son affection à la quantité de présence qu’elle nous donne, et se dire : puisqu’elle me consacre tout son temps, c’est que j’ai tout son cœur ; voir la pensée à défaut de la figure, constater la fidélité d’un être dans l’éclipse du monde, percevoir le frôlement d’une robe comme un bruit d’ailes, l’entendre aller et venir, sortir, rentrer, parler, chanter, et songer qu’on est le centre de ces pas, de cette parole, de ce chant, manifester à chaque minute sa propre attraction, se sentir d’autant plus puissant qu’on est plus infirme, devenir dans l’obscurité, et par l’obscurité, l’astre autour duquel gravite cet ange, peu de félicités égalent celle-là. Le suprême bonheur de la vie, c’est la conviction qu’on est aimé ; aimé pour soi-même, disons mieux, aimé malgré soi-même ; cette conviction, l’aveugle l’a. Dans cette détresse, être servi, c’est être caressé. Lui manque-t-il quelque chose ? Non. Ce n’est point perdre la lumière qu’avoir l’amour. Et quel amour ! un amour entièrement fait de vertu. Il n’y a point de cécité où il y a certitude. L’âme à tâtons cherche l’âme, et la trouve. Et cette âme trouvée et prouvée est une femme. Une main vous soutient, c’est la sienne ; une bouche effleure votre front, c’est sa bouche ; vous entendez une respiration tout près de vous, c’est elle. Tout avoir d’elle, depuis son culte jusqu’à sa pitié, n’être jamais quitté, avoir cette douce faiblesse qui vous secourt, s’appuyer sur ce roseau inébranlable, toucher de ses mains la Providence et pouvoir la prendre dans ses bras ; Dieu palpable, quel ravissement ! Le cœur, cette céleste fleur obscure, entre dans un épanouissement mystérieux. On ne donnerait pas cette ombre pour toute la clarté. L’âme ange est là, sans cesse là ; si elle s’éloigne, c’est pour revenir ; elle s’efface comme le rêve et reparaît comme la réalité. On sent de la chaleur qui approche, la voilà. On déborde de sérénité, de gaîté et d’extase ; on est un rayonnement dans la nuit. Et mille petits soins. Des riens qui sont énormes dans ce vide. Les plus ineffables accents de la voix féminine employés à vous bercer, et suppléant pour vous à l’univers évanoui. On est caressé avec de l’âme. On ne voit rien, mais on se sent adoré. C’est un paradis de ténèbres.","Let us say it in passing, to be blind and to be loved is indeed, on this land where nothing is complete, one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness. To always have a woman, a daughter, a sister, a charming being by your side, who is there because you need her and because she cannot do without you, knowing that she is indispensable to those who are necessary to us, to constantly be able to measure her affection by the amount of presence she gives us, and say to herself: since she devotes all her time to me, it means that I have her whole heart; to see the thought in the absence of the figure, to observe the fidelity of a being in the eclipse of the world, to perceive the brushing of a dress like the sound of wings, to hear it come and go, to go out, to come in, to speak, to sing, and to think that one is the center of these steps, of this word, of this song, manifesting one's own attraction every minute, feeling all the more powerful the more infirm one is, becoming in the dark, and by obscurity, the star around which this angel gravitates, few felicities equal that. The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that one is loved; loved for oneself, let us say better, loved in spite of oneself; this conviction the blind man has. In this distress, to be served is to be caressed. Is he missing something? No. It is not losing the light to have love. And what love! a love entirely made of virtue. There is no blindness where there is certainty. The soul gropes for the soul, and finds it. And this found and proven soul is a woman. A hand supports you, it is his; a mouth touches your forehead, it is his mouth; you hear a breathing very close to you, it is her. To have everything about her, from her cult to her pity, to never be left behind, to have this sweet weakness that helps you, to lean on this unshakeable reed, to touch Providence with your hands and to be able to take her in your arms ; Palpable God, what rapture! The heart, that dark celestial flower, enters into a mysterious blossoming. We wouldn't give this shadow for all the clarity. The angel soul is there, constantly there; if it goes away, it is to come back; it vanishes like a dream and reappears like reality. We feel the heat approaching, here it is. One overflows with serenity, gaiety and ecstasy; we are a radiance in the night. And a thousand little cares. Nothings that are enormous in this void. The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to rock you, and supplying for you the vanished universe. We are caressed with soul. We see nothing, but we feel adored. It is a paradise of darkness.","Incidentally, let us say that on this earth where nothing is perfect, to be blind and to be loved is in fact one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness. To have continually at your side a wife, a daughter, a sister, a delightful human being who is there because you need her and because she cannot do without you, to know you are indispensable to a person who is necessary to you, to be able constantly to measure her affection by how much of her presence she grants you and to say to yourself, ‘Since she devotes all of her time to me, I must have all of her love’; to see the mind though you cannot see the face, to be able to count on the loyalty of one person when the world is eclipsed; to perceive in the rustle of a gown the fluttering of wings, to hear her to-ing and fro-ing, going out, coming home, talking, singing, and to think that you are at the centre of these footsteps, of this talking and singing; to demonstrate at every moment your own magnetic power, to feel all the more powerful the more infirm you are, to become in the darkness and by means of the darkness the star round which this angel gravitates – few joys equal this. The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that you are loved, loved for yourself, better still, loved despite yourself. This conviction the blind man has. In his plight, to be assisted is to be cherished. Does he lack anything? No. There is no loss of light in having love. And what love! A love that is all goodness. There is no blindness where there is certainty. Soul gropes for soul, and finds it. And the soul found and tested is a woman. A hand supports you, it is hers. Lips brush your forehead, they are her lips. You hear someone breathing right beside you, it is she. To have all of her, from her devotion to her pity, never to be left alone, to have that sweet frailty helping you, to lean on that sturdy reed, to touch providence with your hands and to be able to take it in your arms. God made tangible – what rapture! The heart, that obscure celestial flower, comes into mysterious bloom. You would not exchange this darkness for any brightness! The angel soul is there, ever there. If she goes away, it is only to return again. She vanishes like a dream and reappears as reality. You feel a warmth approaching, here she is. Your serenity, cheerfulness and bliss are abounding, you are a radiance in the dark. And so much care and consideration. Little things that count enormously in that void. The most ineffable tones of the female voice devoted to soothing you and making up for the vanished universe. You are spiritually cherished. You see nothing, but you feel adored. It is a dark paradise.","Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in fact, one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth, where nothing is complete.

"Dans les premiers jours, les Thénardier, dépités, avaient jasé. La disparition de l’Alouette avait fait bruit dans le village. Il y avait eu tout de suite plusieurs versions de l’histoire qui avait fini par être un vol d’enfant. De là, la note de police. Cependant, la première humeur passée, le Thénardier, avec son admirable instinct, avait très vite compris qu’il n’est jamais utile d’émouvoir monsieur le procureur du roi, et que ses plaintes à propos de l’enlèvement de Cosette auraient pour premier résultat de fixer sur lui, Thénardier, et sur beaucoup d’affaires troubles qu’il avait, l’étincelante prunelle de la justice. La première chose que les hiboux ne veulent pas, c’est qu’on leur apporte une chandelle. Et d’abord, comment se tirerait-il des quinze cents francs qu’il avait reçus ? Il tourna court, mit un bâillon à sa femme, et fit l’étonné quand on lui parlait de l’enfant volé. Il n’y comprenait rien ; sans doute il s’était plaint dans le moment de ce qu’on lui « enlevait » si vite cette chère petite ; il eût voulu par tendresse la garder encore deux ou trois jours ; mais c’était son « grand-père » qui était venu la chercher le plus naturellement du monde. Il avait ajouté le grand-père, qui faisait bien. Ce fut sur cette histoire que Javert tomba en arrivant à Montfermeil. Le grand-père faisait évanouir Jean Valjean.","During the first days, the Thénardiers, vexed, had talked. The disappearance of the Alouette had caused a stir in the village. There had been several versions of the story right away, which had ended up being child theft. Hence the police note. However, the first temper having passed, Thenardier, with his admirable instinct, had very quickly understood that it is never useful to move the king's attorney, and that his complaints about the abduction of Cosette would have for first result of fixing on him, Thénardier, and on many troubled affairs that he had, the sparkling eye of justice. The first thing owls don't want is a candle. And first of all, how would he get out of the fifteen hundred francs he had received? He stopped short, put a gag on his wife, and acted astonished when he was told about the stolen child. He understood nothing of it; no doubt he had complained at the time that this dear little one was being “taken away” from him so quickly; out of tenderness he would have liked to keep her for another two or three days; but it was her “grandfather” who had come to get her most naturally. He had added the grandfather, who was doing well. It was on this story that Javert fell on arriving at Montfermeil. The grandfather made Jean Valjean faint.","For the first few days, the smarting Thénardiers had a lot to say for themselves. The disappearance of Alouette had created a sensation in the village. There were immediately several versions of the story that had ended up as a child theft. Hence the police report. But after his initial fury Thénardier, with that wonderful instinct of his, very quickly realized that it never pays to involve the crown prosecutor and that the first result of his complaints about Cosette’s ‘abduction’ would be to bring the glinting eye of justice to bear on himself and on many shady affairs he was involved in. The last thing owls want is to have a light shone on them. In the first place, how would he explain the fifteen hundred francs he had received? In a complete turnaround he stopped his wife talking, and feigned astonishment at any mention of the ‘stolen child’. He was at a loss to understand any such talk. No doubt in the heat of the moment he had complained of having that little darling ‘taken away from him’ so quickly. Out of affection he would have liked to keep her another two or three days, but it was her ‘grandfather’ who had come to fetch her, quite naturally enough. He had added the grandfather for good measure. It was this story that Javert heard when he turned up at Montfermeil. The grandfather eliminated Jean Valjean.","For the first few days the Thénardiers had chattered in their rage. The disappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. He immediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in the abduction of a child. Hence the police report.

The last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them. And in the first place, how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received? He turned squarely round, put a gag on his wife’s mouth, and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him. He understood nothing about it; no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature “taken from him” so hastily; he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer, out of tenderness; but her “grandfather” had come for her in the most natural way in the world. He added the “grandfather,” which produced a good effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon when he arrived at Montfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.","For the first few days, the Thénardiers, in their spite, had blabbed the story about. The disappearance of the Lark had made some noise in the village. There were soon several versions of the story, which ended by becoming a case of kidnapping. Hence the police notice. However, when the first ebullition was over, Thénardier, with admirable instinct, very soon arrived at the conclusion that it is never useful to set in motion the Procureur du Roi; that the first result of his complaints in regard to the kidnapping of Cosette would be to fix upon himself, and on many business troubles which he had, the keen eye of justice. The last thing that owls wish is a candle. And first of all, how should he explain the fifteen hundred francs he had received? He stopped short, and enjoined secrecy upon his wife, and professed to be astonished when anybody spoke to him of the stolen child. He knew nothing about it; undoubtedly he had made some complaint at the time that the dear little girl should be “taken away” so suddenly; he would have liked, for affection’s sake, to keep her two or three days; but it was her “grandfather” who had come for her, the most natural thing in the world. He had added the grandfather, which sounded well. It was upon this story that Javert fell on reaching Montfermeil. The grandfather put Jean Valjean out of the question."

"On regardait encore, et l’on voyait au mur en face de la porte un trou quadrangulaire d’environ un pied carré, grillé d’une grille en fer à barreaux entre-croisés, noirs, noueux, solides, lesquels formaient des carreaux, j’ai presque dit des mailles, de moins d’un pouce et demi de diagonale. Les petites fleurettes vertes du papier nankin arrivaient avec calme et en ordre jusqu’à ces barreaux de fer, sans que ce contact funèbre les effarouchât et les fît tourbillonner. En supposant qu’un être vivant eût été assez admirablement maigre pour essayer d’entrer ou de sortir par le trou carré, cette grille l’en eût empêché. Elle ne laissait point passer le corps, mais elle laissait passer les yeux, c’est-à-dire l’esprit. Il semblait qu’on eût songé à cela, car on l’avait doublée d’une lame de fer-blanc sertie dans la muraille un peu en arrière et piquée de mille trous plus microscopiques que les trous d’une écumoire. Au bas de cette plaque était percée une ouverture tout à fait pareille à la bouche d’une boîte aux lettres. Un ruban de fil attaché à un mouvement de sonnette pendait à droite du trou grillé.","We looked again, and we saw in the wall opposite the door a quadrangular hole about a foot square, grilled with an iron grating with intersecting bars, black, knotty, solid, which formed squares, I almost said stitches, less than an inch and a half diagonally. The little green florets of nanking paper arrived calmly and in order as far as these iron bars, without this funereal contact frightening them or making them whirl. Supposing that a living being had been admirably lean enough to try to enter or leave through the square hole, this grille would have prevented it. She did not let the body pass, but she let the eyes, that is to say the spirit, pass. It seemed as if someone had thought of that, for they had lined it with a blade of tin set into the wall a little to the rear and pricked with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes in a slotted spoon. At the bottom of this plate was pierced an opening exactly like the mouth of a mailbox. A ribbon of wire attached to a doorbell movement hung to the right of the grilled hole.","You looked again, and you saw on the wall opposite the door a hatch, about a foot square, filled with a grid of knobbly, solid, black iron bars forming squares – I almost said a mesh – with a diagonal of less than an inch and a half. The little green flowers on the nankin wallpaper came up to those iron bars in a calm, orderly fashion without being frightened or thrown into confusion by this grim contact. Even supposing that some human being were so wonderfully thin as to try to enter or exit through the square hatch, this grille would have prevented it. It kept out the body but not the eyes; that is to say, the mind. Apparently this had been thought of, for it was backed by a sheet of tin set a little further behind in the wall and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes in a sieve. At the bottom of this plaque an opening had been made exactly like the mouth of a letter-box. To the right of the grilled hatch hung a wire attached to a bell mechanism.","One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular hole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars, black, knotted, solid, which formed squares—I had almost said meshes—of less than an inch and a half in diagonal length.

Supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole, this grating would have prevented it. It did not allow the passage of the body, but it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is to say, of the mind.

At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box. A bit of tape attached to a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening.","You looked again, and you saw in the wall opposite the door a quadrangular opening about a foot square, covered with a grate of iron bars crossing one another, black, knotted, solid, which formed squares , I had almost said meshes, less than an inch across.

It did not let the body pass, but it did let the eyes pass, that is to say, the mind.

"Les anglais s’y étaient barricadés ; les français y pénétrèrent, mais ne purent s’y maintenir.

Next to the chapel, a wing of the castle, the only debris that remains of the manor of Hougomont, stands collapsed, one could say gutted.

The French, arquebuses from all sides, from behind the walls, from the top of the attics, from the bottom of the cellars, through all the windows, through all the ventilators, through all the cracks in the stones, brought fascines and set fire to the walls and to men ; grapeshot had fire as its reply.","The English barricaded themselves here. The French got in but could not hold their position. Beside the chapel, one wing of the house, all that is left of Hougomont manor, stands in ruins, gutted, you might say. The manor served as a keep, the chapel served as a blockhouse. There was mutual extermination here. Shot at from all sides, from behind the walls, from up in the granaries, from down in the cellars, through every casement, every basement window, every chink between the stones, the French brought bundles of wood and set fire to walls and men. Bullets were answered with flames.","The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in, but could not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the château, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises in a crumbling state,—disembowelled, one might say.

The French, fired on from every point,—from behind the walls, from the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars, through all the casements, through all the air-holes, through every crack in the stones,—fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men; the reply to the grape-shot was a conflagration.","The English were barricaded there; the French effected an entrance, but could not maintain their position. At the side of the chapel, one wing of the château, the only remnant which exists of the manor of Hougomont, stands crumbling, one might almost say disembowelled.

"Du reste, disons-le pour n’y plus revenir, avec M. Madeleine la prospérité de Montreuil-sur-Mer disparut ; tout ce qu’il avait prévu dans sa nuit de fièvre et d’hésitation se réalisa ; lui de moins, ce fut en effet l’âme de moins. Après sa chute, il se fit à Montreuil-sur-Mer ce partage égoïste des grandes existences tombées, ce fatal dépècement des choses florissantes qui s’accomplit tous les jours obscurément dans la communauté humaine et que l’histoire n’a remarqué qu’une fois, parce qu’il s’est fait après la mort d’Alexandre. Les lieutenants se couronnent rois ; les contre-maîtres s’improvisèrent fabricants. Les rivalités envieuses surgirent. Les vastes ateliers de M. Madeleine furent fermés, les bâtiments tombèrent en ruine, les ouvriers se dispersèrent. Les uns quittèrent le pays, les autres quittèrent le métier. Tout se fit désormais en petit, au lieu de se faire en grand ; pour le lucre, au lieu de se faire pour le bien. Plus de centre ; la concurrence partout, et l’acharnement. M. Madeleine dominait tout, et dirigeait. Lui tombé, chacun tira à soi ; l’esprit de lutte succéda à l’esprit d’organisation, l’âpreté à la cordialité, la haine de l’un contre l’autre à la bienveillance du fondateur pour tous ; les fils noués par M. Madeleine se brouillèrent et se rompirent ; on falsifia les procédés, on avilit les produits, on tua la confiance ; les débouchés diminuèrent, moins de commandes ; le salaire baissa, les ateliers chômèrent, la faillite vint. Et puis plus rien pour les pauvres. Tout s’évanouit.","For the rest, let us say it without going back to it, with M. Madeleine the prosperity of Montreuil-sur-Mer disappeared; everything he had foreseen in his night of fever and hesitation came true; he less, it was indeed the soul less. After his fall, there took place at Montreuil-sur-Mer that selfish division of great fallen existences, that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day obscurely in the human community and which history has only noticed once, because it was done after Alexander's death. Lieutenants crown themselves kings; the foremen improvised as manufacturers. Envious rivalries arose. The vast workshops of M. Madeleine were closed, the buildings fell into ruin, the workmen dispersed. Some left the country, others left the profession. Henceforth everything was done on a small scale, instead of on a large scale; for lucre, instead of doing it for the good. More center; competition everywhere, and relentlessness. M. Madeleine dominated everything, and directed. When he fell, each shot at himself; the spirit of struggle succeeded the spirit of organization, harshness to cordiality, the hatred of one against the other to the benevolence of the founder for all; the threads tied by M. Madeleine became confused and broke; processes were falsified, products were degraded, confidence was killed; outlets diminished, fewer orders; wages fell, the workshops were idle, bankruptcy came. And then nothing for the poor. Everything fades away.","Anyway, let it be said once and for all, when Monsieur Madeleine went, the prosperity of Montreuil-sur-Mer went with him. Everything he had foreseen during his night of feverishness and indecision came true. With him gone, the moving spirit was indeed gone. After his downfall there was at Montreuil-sur-Mer that self-interested parcelling-out of the spoils of the once great, that fatal carving-up of flourishing enterprises that takes place in obscurity every day among humankind, and which history has noted only once because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants crowned themselves king. Foremen acted as factory-owners. Envious rivalries sprang up. Monsieur Madeleine’s vast workshops were closed down. The buildings fell into ruin. The workmen went their separate ways, some of them left the area, others left the trade. From then on, everything was done on a small scale instead of being done on a large scale, for money instead of the general good. The centre now gone, competition rife, and everywhere rapacious greed. Monsieur Madeleine had it all under control, and he gave direction. With his removal, it was every man for himself. The spirit of organization gave way to the spirit of conflict. Cordiality gave way to bitterness. The founder’s benevolence towards all gave way to hatred of one another. The threads Monsieur Madeleine had woven together became tangled and broke. Manufacturing processes were compromised, the quality of the products deteriorated, trust was destroyed, markets shrank, orders fell, wages dropped, workshops stood idle, bankruptcy followed. And then the poor were left with nothing. It all disappeared.","However, and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished with M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually was a soul lacking. After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen, that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day, obscurely, in the human community, and which history has noted only once, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants are crowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves. Envious rivalries arose. M. Madeleine’s vast workshops were shut; his buildings fell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of them quitted the country, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth, everything was done on a small scale, instead of on a grand scale; for lucre instead of the general good. There was no longer a centre; everywhere there was competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had reigned over all and directed all. No sooner had he fallen, than each pulled things to himself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization, bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the benevolence of the founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had set were tangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the products were debased, confidence was killed; the market diminished, for lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still, bankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more for the poor. All had vanished.","While we are about it, let us remark, in dismissing the subject, that with M. Madeleine, the prosperity of M—— sur M—— disappeared; all that he had foreseen, in that night of fever and irresolution, was realised; he gone, the soul was gone. After his downfall, there was at M—— sur M—— that egotistic distribution of what is left when great men have fallen—that fatal carving up of prosperous enterprises which is daily going on, out of sight, in human society, and which history has noted but once, and then, because it took place after the death of Alexander. Generals crown themselves kings; the foremen, in this case, assumed the position of manufacturers. Jealous rivalries arose. The spacious workshops of M. Madeleine were closed; the building fell into ruin, the workmen dispersed. Some left the country, others abandoned the business. From that time forth, everything was done on a small, instead of on the large scale, and for gain rather than for good. No longer any centre; competition on all sides, and on all sides venom. M. Madeleine had ruled and directed everything. He fallen, every man strove for himself; the spirit of strife succeeded to the spirit of organisation, bitterness to cordiality, hatred of each against each instead of the good will of the founder towards all; the threads knitted by M. Madeleine became entangled and were broken; the workmanship was debased, the manufacturers were degraded, confidence was killed; customers diminished, there were fewer orders, wages decreased, the shops became idle, bankruptcy followed. And, then, there was nothing left for the poor. All that was there disappeared."

"Puis il était monté à cheval, s’était porté en avant de Rossomme, et avait choisi pour observatoire une étroite croupe de gazon à droite de la route de Genappe à Bruxelles, qui fut sa seconde station pendant la bataille. La troisième station, celle de sept heures du soir, entre la Belle-Alliance et la Haie-Sainte, est redoutable ; c’est un tertre assez élevé qui existe encore et derrière lequel la garde était massée dans une déclivité de la plaine. Autour de ce tertre, les boulets ricochaient sur le pavé de la chaussée jusqu’à Napoléon. Comme à Brienne, il avait sur sa tête le sifflement des balles et des biscaïens. On a ramassé, presque à l’endroit où étaient les pieds de son cheval, des boulets vermoulus, de vieilles lames de sabre et des projectiles informes, mangés de rouille. Scabra rubigine. Il y a quelques années, on y a déterré un obus de soixante, encore chargé, dont la fusée s’était brisée au ras de la bombe. C’est à cette dernière station que l’empereur disait à son guide Lacoste, paysan hostile, effaré, attaché à la selle d’un hussard, se retournant à chaque paquet de mitraille, et tâchant de se cacher derrière lui : ― Imbécile ! c’est honteux, tu vas te faire tuer dans le dos. Celui qui écrit ces lignes a trouvé lui-même dans le talus friable de ce tertre, en creusant le sable, les restes du col d’une bombe désagrégés par l’oxyde de quarante-six années, et de vieux tronçons de fer qui cassaient comme des bâtons de sureau entre ses doigts.","Then he mounted his horse, rode in front of Rossomme, and chose for his vantage point a narrow hill of grass to the right of the road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station during the battle. The third station, that of seven o'clock in the evening, between Belle-Alliance and Haie-Sainte, is formidable; it is a rather high mound which still exists and behind which the guard was massed in a slope of the plain. Around this mound, the balls ricocheted on the pavement of the road until Napoleon. As at Brienne, he had on his head the whistle of bullets and Biscaiens. They picked up, almost where his horse's feet were, worm-eaten balls, old saber blades and shapeless projectiles eaten away with rust. Scabra rubigina. A few years ago, a sixty shell was unearthed there, still loaded, the fuze of which had broken at the level of the bomb. It was at this last station that the Emperor said to his guide Lacoste, a hostile, bewildered peasant, attached to the saddle of a hussar, turning round at each packet of grapeshot, and trying to hide behind him: “Imbecile! it's shameful, you're going to get yourself killed in the back. Whoever writes these lines found himself in the friable slope of this mound, while digging the sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb disintegrated by the oxide of forty-six years, and old sections of iron which broke like elderberry sticks between his fingers.","Then he mounted his own horse, rode up in front of Rossomme, and chose for his observation post a narrow grassy ridge to the right of the Genappe–Brussels road, his second position during the battle. The third position, taken up at seven o’clock in the evening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, was a dangerous one. It was on quite a high hillock, which still exists, and behind which the Guard was massed in a dip in the plain. Around this hillock, cannon-balls ricocheted off the paved road right up to Napoleon. As at Brienne, he had bullets and grapeshot whistling over his head. From almost the very spot where his horse’s hoofs had been, pitted cannon-balls, old sabre blades and shapeless projectiles consumed with rust have been retrieved. Scabra rubigine. * A few years ago a sixty-pound bombshell was unearthed, still charged with explosive, with its fuse broken off flush with the shell’s surface. It was in this last position that the emperor said to his guide Lacoste, a resentful and terrified peasant strapped to a hussar’s saddle who kept wheeling round at every discharge of canister-shot and trying to hide behind him, ‘Idiot! this is disgraceful, you’re going to get yourself killed, shot in the back.’ Digging into the sand on the friable slopes of this hillock, the author of these lines has himself found the disintegrating remains of the neck of a bomb after forty-six years’ corrosion, and old fragments of iron that snapped like elder-twigs between his fingers.","Then he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected for his post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of the road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station during the battle. The third station, the one adopted at seven o’clock in the evening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable; it is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which the guard was massed on a slope of the plain. Around this knoll the balls rebounded from the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself. As at Brienne, he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the heavy artillery. Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, and shapeless projectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where his horse’s feet stood. Scabra rubigine. A few years ago, a shell of sixty pounds, still charged, and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb, was unearthed. It was at this last post that the Emperor said to his guide, Lacoste, a hostile and terrified peasant, who was attached to the saddle of a hussar, and who turned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind Napoleon: “Fool, it is shameful! You’ll get yourself killed with a ball in the back.” He who writes these lines has himself found, in the friable soil of this knoll, on turning over the sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb, disintegrated, by the oxidization of six and forty years, and old fragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs between the fingers.","Then he mounted his horse, rode forward from Rossomme, and chose for his point of view a narrow grassy ridge, at the right of the road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station during the battle. The third station, that of seven o’clock between La Belle Alliance and La Haie Sainte, is terrible; it is a considerable hill which can still be seen, and behind which the guard was massed in a depression of the plain. About this hill the balls ricocheted over the paved road up to Napoleon. As at Brienne, he had over his head the whistling of balls and bullets. There have been gathered, almost upon the spot pressed by his horse’s feet, crushed bullets, old sabre blades, and shapeless projectiles, eaten with rust. Scabra rubigine. Some years ago, a sixty-pound shell was dug up there, still loaded, the fuse having broken off even with the bomb. It was at this last station that the emperor said to his guide Lacoste, a hostile peasant, frightened, tied to a hussar’s saddle, turning around at every volley of grape, and trying to hide behind Napoleon: Dolt, this is shameful. You will get yourself shot in the back. He who writes these lines has himself found in the loose slope of that hill, by turning up the earth, the remains of a bomb, disintegrated by the rust of forty-six years, and some old bits of iron which broke like alder twigs in his finger."

"Pour revenir de chez maître Scaufflaire, il avait pris le plus long, comme si la porte du presbytère avait été pour lui une tentation, et qu’il eût voulu l’éviter.

Pourtant la concierge de la fabrique, qui était en même temps l’unique servante de M. Madeleine, observa que sa lumière s’éteignit à huit heures et demie, et elle le dit au caissier qui rentrait, en ajoutant :","To return from Master Scaufflaire's, he had taken the longest route, as if the door of the presbytery had been a temptation for him, and that he wanted to avoid it.

"L’Angleterre a été trop modeste vis-à-vis de Wellington. Faire Wellington si grand, c’est faire l’Angleterre petite. Wellington n’est qu’un héros comme un autre. Ces écossais gris, ces horse-guards, ces régiments de Maitland et de Mitchell, cette infanterie de Pack et de Kempt, cette cavalerie de Ponsomby et de Somerset, ces highlanders jouant du pibroch sous la mitraille, ces bataillons de Rylandt, ces recrues toutes fraîches qui savaient à peine manier le mousquet tenant tête aux vieilles bandes d’Essling et de Rivoli, voilà ce qui est grand. Wellington a été tenace, ce fut là son mérite, et nous ne le lui marchandons pas, mais le moindre de ses fantassins et de ses cavaliers a été tout aussi solide que lui. L’iron-soldier vaut l’iron-duke. Quant à nous, toute notre glorification va au soldat anglais, à l’armée anglaise, au peuple anglais. Si trophée il y a, c’est à l’Angleterre que le trophée est dû. La colonne de Waterloo serait plus juste si, au lieu de la figure d’un homme, elle élevait dans la nue la statue d’un peuple.","England have been too modest vis-à-vis Wellington.

As for us, all our glorification goes to the English soldier, to the English army, to the English people. If there is a trophy, it is to England that the trophy is due.

Wellington was tenacious, that was his virtue, and we do not begrudge him that, but the least of his footsoldiers and cavalry were just as staunch as he.

"Hougomont, vu sur la carte, en plan géométral, bâtiments et enclos compris, présente une espèce de rectangle irrégulier dont un angle aurait été entaillé. C’est à cet angle qu’est la porte méridionale, gardée par ce mur qui la fusille à bout portant. Hougomont a deux portes, la porte méridionale, celle du château, et la porte septentrionale, celle de la ferme. Napoléon envoya contre Hougomont son frère Jérôme ; les divisions Guilleminot, Foy et Bachelu s’y heurtèrent, presque tout le corps de Reille y fut employé et y échoua, les boulets de Kellermann s’épuisèrent sur cet héroïque pan de mur. Ce ne fut pas trop de la brigade Bauduin pour forcer Hougomont au nord, et la brigade Soye ne put que l’entamer au sud, sans le prendre.","Hougomont, seen on the map, in geometrical plan, buildings and enclosure included, presents a kind of irregular rectangle of which an angle would have been notched. It is at this angle that the southern gate is, guarded by this wall which shoots it at close range. Hougomont has two gates, the southern gate, that of the castle, and the northern gate, that of the farm. Napoleon sent against Hougomont his brother Jerome; Guilleminot's, Foy's and Bachelu's divisions collided there, almost all of Reille's corps was employed there and failed there, Kellermann's cannonballs were exhausted on this heroic stretch of wall. It was not too much of the Bauduin brigade to force Hougomont to the north, and the Soye brigade could only cut into it to the south, without taking it.","Viewed on a planimetric map, Hougomont, its buildings and enclosures included, forms a kind of irregular rectangle with one corner indented. It is at this corner that the southern gate stands, guarded by the wall that comes at it from point-blank range. Hougomont has two gates: the south gate, leading to the manor house, and the north gate, leading to the farm. Napoleon dispatched his brother Jerome against Hougomont; divisions led by Guilleminot, Foy and Bachelu assaulted it, nearly the whole of Reille’s corps was deployed against it and came to grief here; Kellermann’s cannon-balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall. Only a few of Bauduin’s brigade succeeded in storming Hougomont to the north, and Soye’s brigade could only make a breach to the south, without taking it.","Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising buildings and enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one angle of which is nicked out. It is this angle which contains the southern door, guarded by this wall, which commands it only a gun’s length away. Hougomont has two doors,—the southern door, that of the château; and the northern door, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent his brother Jérôme against Hougomont; the divisions of Foy, Guilleminot, and Bachelu hurled themselves against it; nearly the entire corps of Reille was employed against it, and miscarried; Kellermann’s balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall. Bauduin’s brigade was not strong enough to force Hougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could not do more than effect the beginning of a breach on the south, but without taking it.","Hougomont seen on the map, on a geometrical plan, comprising buildings and inclosure, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one corner of which is cut off. At this corner is the southern entrance, guarded by this wall, which commands it at the shortest musket range. Hougomont has two entrances: the southern, that of the château, and the northern, that of the farm. Napoleon sent against Hougomont his brother Jerome. The divisions of Guilleminot, Foy, and Bachelu were hurled against it; nearly the whole corps of Reille was there employed and there defeated, and the bullets of Kellermann were exhausted against this heroic wall-front. It was too much for the brigade of Bauduin to force Hougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could only batter it on the south—it could not take it."

"Par moments, au milieu de son travail du bagne, il s’arrêtait. Il se mettait à penser. Sa raison, à la fois plus mûre et plus troublée qu’autrefois, se révoltait. Tout ce qui lui était arrivé lui paraissait absurde ; tout ce qui l’entourait lui paraissait impossible. Il se disait : c’est un rêve.

"Ce retard et la station au carrefour Rollin pour se concerter avec ses agents faillirent lui faire perdre la piste. Cependant il eut bien vite deviné que Jean Valjean voudrait placer la rivière entre ses chasseurs et lui. Il pencha la tête et réfléchit, comme un limier qui met le nez à terre pour être juste à la voie. Javert, avec sa puissante rectitude d’instinct, alla droit au pont d’Austerlitz. Un mot au péager le mit au fait : ― Avez-vous vu un homme avec une petite fille ? ― Je lui ai fait payer deux sous, répondit le péager. Javert arriva sur le pont à temps pour voir de l’autre côté de l’eau Jean Valjean traverser avec Cosette à la main l’espace éclairé par la lune. Il le vit s’engager dans la rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, il songea au cul-de-sac Genrot disposé là comme une trappe et à l’issue unique de la rue Droit-Mur sur la petite rue Picpus. Il assura les grands devants, comme parlent les chasseurs ; il envoya en hâte par un détour un de ses agents garder cette issue. Une patrouille, qui rentrait au poste de l’Arsenal, ayant passé, il la requit et s’en fit accompagner. Dans ces parties-là les soldats sont des atouts. D’ailleurs, c’est le principe que, pour venir à bout d’un sanglier, il faut faire science de veneur et force de chiens. Ces dispositions combinées, sentant Jean Valjean saisi entre l’impasse Genrot à droite, son agent à gauche, et lui Javert derrière, il prit une prise de tabac.","This delay and the station at the Rollin crossroads to confer with his agents almost made him lose the track. However, he quickly guessed that Jean Valjean would like to place the river between his hunters and him. He cocked his head and thought, like a sleuth putting his nose down to be right on track. Javert, with his powerful instinctive rectitude, went straight to the Pont d'Austerlitz. A word to the publican put him to the point: ―Have you seen a man with a little girl? ""I made him pay two sous,"" replied the publican. Javert arrived on deck in time to see Jean Valjean crossing the moonlit space with Cosette in his hand across the water. He saw him turn into the rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, he thought of the cul-de-sac Genrot arranged there like a trapdoor and of the only exit from the rue Droit-Mur on the little rue Picpus. He ensured the great fronts, as the hunters speak; he hastily sent one of his agents by a detour to guard this issue. A patrol, which was returning to the post of the Arsenal, having passed, he called for it and had it accompanied. In these parts the soldiers are assets. Moreover, it is the principle that, to overcome a boar, it is necessary to make science of huntsman and force of dogs. These dispositions combined, feeling Jean Valjean seized between the impasse Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, and him Javert behind, he took a pinch of snuff.","This delay, and stopping at Carrefour Rollin to confer with his men, almost made him lose the trail. However, he very soon worked out that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between himself and his pursuers. Like a bloodhound setting its nose to the ground to keep on the right track, he bowed his head and reflected. With his powerful sureness of instinct Javert made straight for the Pont d’Austerlitz. A word with the toll collector told him all he needed to know. ‘Have you seen a man with a little girl?’ ‘I made him pay two sous,’ replied the toll collector. Javert reached the bridge in time to see Jean Valjean on the other side of the water walking across the moonlit open space holding Cosette by the hand. He saw him enter Rue du Chemin-Vert-St-Antoine. He pictured Cul-de-Sac Genrot laid out there like a trap, and the only way out of Rue Droit-Mur into Petite-Rue-Picpus. He ‘organized a drive’, as huntsmen say. He quickly sent one of his agents by a roundabout route to guard that exit. When an army patrol came by, on its way back to the Arsenal, he requisitioned it to go with him. In such circumstances soldiers are an asset. Moreover, the rule is, to get the better of a wild boar you need the expertise of a huntsman and plenty of dogs. Having made these arrangements, and aware that Jean Valjean was trapped between the Genrot blind alley on his right, Javert’s man on his left, and Javert himself behind, he took a pinch of snuff.","This delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily divined, however, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself. He bent his head and reflected like a blood-hound who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent. Javert, with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straight to the bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished him with the information which he required: “ Have you seen a man with a little girl?” “I made him pay two sous,” replied the toll-keeper. Javert reached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette by the hand. He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he remembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of the sole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. He made sure of his back burrows, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched one of his agents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. A patrol which was returning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisition on it, and caused it to accompany him. In such games soldiers are aces. Moreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wild boar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs. These combinations having been effected, feeling that Jean Valjean was caught between the blind alley Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, and himself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff.","This delay and stopping at the Rollin square to arrange with his men made him lose the scent. However, he had very soon guessed that Jean Valjean’s first wish would be to put the river between his pursuers and himself. He bowed his head and reflected, like a hound who put his nose to the ground to be sure of the way. Javert, with his straightforward power of instinct, went directly to the bridge of Austerlitz. A word to the toll-keeper set him right. “Have you seen a man with a little girl?” “I made him pay two sous,” answered the tollman. Javert reached the bridge in time to see Jean Valjean on the other side of the river leading Cosette across the space lighted by the moon. He saw him enter the Rue de Chemin Vert Saint Antoine, he thought of the Cul-de-sac Genrot placed there like a trap, and of the only outlet from the Rue Droit Mur into the Petite Rue Picpus. He put out beaters, as hunters say; he sent one of his men hastily by a detour to guard that outlet. A patrol passing on its return to the station at the arsenal, he put it in requisition and took it along with him. In such games soldiers are trumps. Moreover, it is a maxim that, to take the boar requires the science of the hunter, and the strength of the dogs. These combinations being effected, feeling that Jean Valjean was caught between the Cul-de-sac Genrot on the right, his officer on the left, and himself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff."

Wellington était le Barême de la guerre, Napoléon en était le Michel-Ange, et cette fois le génie fut vaincu par le calcul.","Waterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history.

"Monseigneur Bienvenu eut donc, aussi lui, son heure d’esprit de parti, son heure d’amertume, son nuage. L’ombre des passions du moment traversa ce doux et grand esprit occupé des choses éternelles.

Nevertheless, I sent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the man’s bed a goat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights are frigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity that this skin is old; all the hair is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in Germany, at Tottlingen, near the sources of the Danube, as well as the little ivory-handled knife which I use at table.","“Towards the end, as we were at dessert, some one pushed the door open. It was Mother Gerbaud with her child in her arms. My brother kissed the child, and borrowed fifteen sous that I had with me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man, during this time, paid but little attention to what passed. He did not speak, and appeared to be very tired. The poor old lady left, and my brother said grace, after which he turned towards this man and said: ‘You must be in great need of sleep.’ Madame Magloire quickly removed the cloth. I understood that we ought to retire in order that this traveller might sleep, and we both went to our rooms. However, in a few moments afterwards, I sent Madame Magloire to put on the bed of this man a roebuck skin from the Black Forest, which is in my chamber. The nights are quite cold, and this skin retains the warmth. It is a pity that it is quite old, and all the hair is gone. My brother bought it when he was in Germany, at Totlingen, near the sources of the Danube, as also the little ivory-handled knife, which I use at table."

"Au point du jour, comme il s’assoupissait de fatigue, il fut réveillé par le grincement d’une porte qui s’ouvrait à quelque mansarde du fond du corridor, puis il entendit le même pas d’homme qui avait monté l’escalier la veille. Le pas s’approchait. Il se jeta à bas du lit et appliqua son œil au trou de la serrure, lequel était assez grand, espérant voir au passage l’être quelconque qui s’était introduit la nuit dans la masure et qui avait écouté à sa porte. C’était un homme en effet, qui passa, cette fois sans s’arrêter, devant la chambre de Jean Valjean. Le corridor était encore trop obscur pour qu’on pût distinguer son visage ; mais, quand l’homme arriva à l’escalier, un rayon de la lumière du dehors le fit saillir comme une silhouette, et Jean Valjean le vit de dos complètement. L’homme était de haute taille, vêtu d’une redingote longue, avec un gourdin sous son bras. C’était l’encolure formidable de Javert.","At daybreak, as he was dozing off with fatigue, he was awakened by the creaking of a door opening in some attic at the end of the corridor, then he heard the same footsteps of a man who had climbed the stairs. the day before. The step was approaching. He threw himself down from the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole, which was rather large, hoping to see in passing some being who had slipped into the hovel at night and listened at his door. It was indeed a man, who passed, this time without stopping, past Jean Valjean's room. The corridor was still too dark to make out his face; but when the man reached the stairs, a ray of light from outside made him stand out like a silhouette, and Jean Valjean saw him completely from behind. The man was tall, dressed in a long frock coat, with a club under his arm. It was Javert's terrific neckline.","At daybreak just as he was dozing off through tiredness, he was woken by the creak of a door opening into some garret room at the end of the corridor, then he heard that same footstep, belonging to a man, that had climbed the staircase the night before. The footsteps were approaching. He leapt out of bed and put his eye to the keyhole, which was quite big, hoping to see, as the person went by, whoever it was that had entered the tenement by night and had been listening at his door. It was indeed a man who went past Jean Valjean’s room, this time without stopping. The corridor was still too dark for his face to be distinguishable but when the man reached the staircase a ray of light from outside picked him out in silhouette, and Jean Valjean had a full view of him from behind. The man was tall, wearing a long frock-coat, with a truncheon under his arm. He had Javert’s solid build.","At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening. The step was approaching. He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole, which was tolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his door, as he passed. It was a man, in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, in front of Jean Valjean’s chamber. The corridor was too dark to allow of the person’s face being distinguished; but when the man reached the staircase, a ray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette, and Jean Valjean had a complete view of his back. The man was of lofty stature, clad in a long frock-coat, with a cudgel under his arm. The formidable neck and shoulders belonged to Javert.","At daybreak, as he was sinking into slumber from fatigue, he was aroused, again, by the creaking of the door of some room at the end of the hall, and then he heard the same footstep which had ascended the stairs, on the preceding night. The step approached. He started from his bed and placed his eye to the keyhole, which was quite a large one, hoping to get a glimpse of the person, whoever it might be, who had made his way into the building in the night-time and had listened at his door. It was a man, indeed, who passed by Jean Valjean’s room, this time without stopping. The hall was still too dark for him to make out his features; but, when the man reached the stairs, a ray of light from without made his figure stand out like a profile, and Jean Valjean had a full view of his back. The man was tall, wore a long frock-coat, and had a cudgel under his arm. It was the redoubtable form of Javert."

"Pendant qu’il pleurait, le jour se faisait de plus en plus dans son cerveau, un jour extraordinaire, un jour ravissant et terrible à la fois.

His past life, his first offence, his long expiation, his brutal exterior, his hardened interior, his release made glad by so many schemes of vengeance , what had happened to him at the bishop’s, his last action, this theft of forty sous from a child, a crime meaner and the more monstrous that it came after the bishop’s pardon, all this returned and appeared to him, clearly, but in a light that he had never seen before. He beheld his life, and it seemed to him horrible; his soul, and it seemed to him frightful. There was, however, a softened light upon that life and upon that soul. It seemed to him that he was looking upon Satan by the light of Paradise."

"M. de Rohan était du reste, à son insu, l’objet de l’attention des pensionnaires. Il venait à cette époque d’être fait, en attendant l’épiscopat, grand vicaire de l’archevêque de Paris. C’était une de ses habitudes de venir assez souvent chanter aux offices de la chapelle des religieuses du Petit-Picpus.

"Le Thénardier particulièrement était gênant pour le physionomiste. On n’a qu’à regarder certains hommes pour s’en défier, car on les sent ténébreux à leurs deux extrémités. Ils sont inquiets derrière eux et menaçants devant eux. Il y a en eux de l’inconnu. On ne peut pas plus répondre de ce qu’ils ont fait que de ce qu’ils feront. L’ombre qu’ils ont dans le regard les dénonce. Rien qu’en les entendant dire un mot ou qu’en les voyant faire un geste on entrevoit de sombres secrets dans leur passé et de sombres mystères dans leur avenir.","The Thenardier in particular was inconvenient for the physiognomist. We only have to look at certain men to be suspicious of them, because we feel them dark at both ends. They are worried behind them and threatening in front of them. There is something unknown in them. We can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadow they have in their eyes denounces them. Just hearing them say a word or seeing them make a move reveals dark secrets in their past and dark mysteries in their future.","Thénardier in particular gave the physiognomist pause. You have only to look at some men to distrust them. You sense a shadiness in their lives, at both ends. Behind them is a restlessness, taken forward with menace. They have something of the unknown in them. You can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do. The darkness they have in their eyes betrays them. You have only to hear them say one word, or see them make one gesture, to glimpse sinister secrets in their past and sinister mysteries in their future.","Thénardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One can only look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are dark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front. There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future.","The man especially would have been a puzzle to a physiognomist. We have only to look at some men to distrust them, for we feel the darkness of their souls in two ways. They are restless as to what is behind them, and threatening as to what is before them. They are full of mystery. We can no more answer for what they have done, than for what they will do. The shadow in their looks denounces them. If we hear them utter a word, or see them make a gesture, we catch glimpses of guilty secrets in their past, and dark mysteries in their future."

"Il était évident qu’il fallait que Javert eût été comme on dit, « jeté hors des gonds » pour qu’il se fût permis d’apostropher le sergent comme il l’avait fait, après l’invitation du maire de mettre Fantine en liberté. En était-il venu à oublier la présence de monsieur le maire ? Avait-il fini par se déclarer à lui-même qu’il était impossible qu’une « autorité » eût donné un pareil ordre, et que bien certainement monsieur le maire avait dû dire sans le vouloir une chose pour une autre ? Ou bien, devant les énormités dont il était témoin depuis deux heures, se disait-il qu’il fallait revenir aux suprêmes résolutions, qu’il était nécessaire que le petit se fît grand, que le mouchard se transformât en magistrat, que l’homme de police devînt homme de justice, et qu’en cette extrémité prodigieuse l’ordre, la loi, la morale, le gouvernement, la société tout entière, se personnifiaient en lui Javert ?","It was obvious that Javert had to have been, as they say, ""thrown off the hinges"" for him to have allowed himself to address the sergeant as he had done, after the mayor's invitation to put Fantine in freedom.

Had he ended by declaring to himself that it was impossible for an ""authority"" to have given such an order, and that very certainly the mayor must have said one thing for another without meaning it? Or else, faced with the enormities he had been witnessing for two hours, did he say to himself that it was necessary to return to supreme resolutions, that it was necessary for the little one to grow up, for the informer to transform into a magistrate, for the a policeman became a man of justice, and that in this prodigious extremity order, law, morality, government, society as a whole, were personified in him Javert?","It was obvious that Javert must have been ‘thrown out of kilter’, as they say, to allow himself to address the sergeant the way he did after the mayor’s request that Fantine should be set free. Could he have forgotten monsieur le maire’s presence? Had he in the end convinced himself it was impossible that any ‘authority’ could have given such an order, and that surely monsieur le maire must have said one thing instead of another without meaning to? Or in view of the outrages he had witnessed over the past two hours, did he tell himself it was necessary to act with the utmost resolve, that the humble must assume greatness, the sleuth must turn himself into a judge , the police agent must become the agent of justice, and that in this exceptional extremity he, Javert, was the personification of law, order, morality, government, the whole of society?","It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done, after the mayor’s suggestion that Fantine should be set at liberty. Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor’s presence? Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any “authority” should have given such an order, and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intending it? Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the small should be made great, that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, and that, in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government, society in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert?","It was clear that Javert must have been, as they say, “thrown off his balance,” or he would not have allowed himself to address the sergeant as he did, after the direction of the mayor to set Fantine at liberty. Had he forgotten the presence of the mayor? Had he finally decided within himself that it was impossible for “an authority” to give such an order, and that very certainly the mayor must have said one thing when he meant another? Or, in view of the enormities which he had witnessed for the last two hours, did he say to himself that it was necessary to revert to extreme measures, that it was necessary for the little to make itself great, for the detective to transform himself into a magistrate, for the policeman to become a judge, and that in this fearful extremity, order, law, morality, government, society as a whole, were personified in him, Javert?"

Cela ressemblait à la petite musique vague que font les clarines des bestiaux la nuit dans les pâturages.","However, through the reverie into which he had fallen, he had been hearing for some time a singular noise. It was like a bell being waved. This noise was in the garden. He could be heard distinctly, albeit faintly. It sounded like the vague little music that the bells of cattle make at night in the pastures.","But through the reverie into which he had fallen he had for a while been able to hear a curious sound. It was like a little bell being shaken. The sound came from the garden. Distinctly, albeit faintly, audible, it was reminiscent of the hesistant little tunes produced by cow bells in the pastures at night.","Nevertheless, athwart this reverie into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a bell. This sound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard distinctly though faintly.

"Du reste ce quartier, qui avait plutôt l’air suranné qu’antique, tendait dès lors à se transformer. Dès cette époque, qui voulait le voir devait se hâter. Chaque jour quelque détail de cet ensemble s’en allait. Aujourd’hui, et depuis vingt ans, l’embarcadère du chemin de fer d’Orléans est là à côté du vieux faubourg, et le travaille. Partout où l’on place, sur la lisière d’une capitale, l’embarcadère d’un chemin de fer, c’est la mort d’un faubourg et la naissance d’une ville. Il semble qu’autour de ces grands centres du mouvement des peuples, au roulement de ces puissantes machines, au souffle de ces monstrueux chevaux de la civilisation qui mangent du charbon et vomissent du feu, la terre pleine de germes tremble et s’ouvre pour engloutir les anciennes demeures des hommes et laisser sortir les nouvelles. Les vieilles maisons croulent, les maisons neuves montent.","Moreover, this district, which looked rather old-fashioned than ancient, tended from then on to change. From that time, whoever wanted to see him had to hurry. Every day some detail of this whole disappeared. Today, and for twenty years, the pier of the Orleans railway is there next to the old suburb, and works on it. Wherever, on the outskirts of a capital, you place the wharf of a railway, it is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city. It seems that around these great centers of the movement of peoples, at the rolling of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which eat coal and vomit fire, the earth full of germs trembles and opens to swallow up the old abodes of men and let out the new. Old houses crumble, new houses go up.","However, this neighbourhood, which looked neglected rather than antiquated, was already then beginning to change. Even at that time anyone who wanted to see it had to hurry. Every day some detail of this environment was being lost. The Paris–Orléans railway terminus is now located here, as it has been for the last twenty years, and is having an impact on the old faubourg close by. Wherever a railway station is sited on the outskirts of a capital, it spells the death of a suburb and the birth of a town. It seems that around these great centres for the movement of people, at the rumbling of these powerful machines, at the puffing of these monstrous horses of civilization that devour coal and vomit fire, the gravid earth trembles and opens up to swallow the human dwelling-places of the past and allow fresh ones to emerge. The old houses come down, new houses go up.","However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antique air, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the station of the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city. It seems as though, around these great centres of the movements of a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old houses crumble and new ones rise.","In conclusion, this quarter, which was rather superannuated than ancient, from that time began to undergo a transformation. Thenceforth, whoever would see it, must hasten. Each day, some of its details wholly passed away. Now, as has been the case for twenty years past, the terminus of the Orleans railroad lies just outside of the old suburb, and keeps it in movement. Wherever you may locate, in the outskirts of a capital, a railroad depôt, it is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city. It would seem as though around these great centres of the activity of nations, at the rumbling of these mighty engines, at the snorting of these giant draught-horses of civilisation, which devour coal and spout forth fire, the earth, teeming with germs of life, trembles and opens to swallow old dwellings of men and to bring forth new; old houses crumble, new houses spring up."

"Moins d’une demi-heure après, Cosette, redevenue rose à la flamme d’un bon feu, dormait dans le lit du vieux jardinier.

"Un physionomiste qui eût été familier avec la nature de Javert, qui eût étudié depuis longtemps ce sauvage au service de la civilisation, ce composé bizarre du romain, du spartiate, du moine et du caporal, cet espion incapable d’un mensonge, ce mouchard vierge, un physionomiste qui eût su sa secrète et ancienne aversion pour M. Madeleine, son conflit avec le maire au sujet de la Fantine, et qui eût considéré Javert en ce moment, se fût dit : que s’est-il passé ? Il était évident, pour qui eût connu cette conscience droite, claire, sincère, probe, austère et féroce, que Javert sortait de quelque grand événement intérieur. Javert n’avait rien dans l’âme qu’il ne l’eût aussi sur le visage. Il était, comme les gens violents, sujet aux revirements brusques. Jamais sa physionomie n’avait été plus étrange et plus inattendue. En entrant, il s’était incliné devant M. Madeleine avec un regard où il n’y avait ni rancune, ni colère, ni défiance, il s’était arrêté à quelques pas derrière le fauteuil du maire ; et maintenant il se tenait là, debout, dans une attitude presque disciplinaire, avec la rudesse naïve et froide d’un homme qui n’a jamais été doux et qui a toujours été patient ; il attendait, sans dire un mot, sans faire un mouvement, dans une humilité vraie et dans une résignation tranquille, qu’il plût à monsieur le maire de se retourner, calme, sérieux, le chapeau à la main, les yeux baissés, avec une expression qui tenait le milieu entre le soldat devant son officier et le coupable devant son juge. Tous les sentiments comme tous les souvenirs qu’on eût pu lui supposer avaient disparu. Il n’y avait plus rien sur ce visage impénétrable et simple comme le granit, qu’une morne tristesse.

"Quant à la mère, l’aspect en était pauvre et triste. Elle avait la mise d’une ouvrière qui tend à redevenir paysanne. Elle était jeune. Était-elle belle ? peut-être ; mais avec cette mise il n’y paraissait pas. Ses cheveux, d’où s’échappait une mèche blonde, semblaient fort épais, mais disparaissaient sévèrement sous une coiffe de béguine, laide, serrée, étroite, et nouée au menton. Le rire montre les belles dents quand on en a ; mais elle ne riait point. Ses yeux ne semblaient pas être secs depuis très longtemps. Elle était pâle ; elle avait l’air très lasse et un peu malade ; elle regardait sa fille endormie dans ses bras avec cet air particulier d’une mère qui a nourri son enfant. Un large mouchoir bleu comme ceux où se mouchent les invalides, plié en fichu, masquait lourdement sa taille. Elle avait les mains hâlées et toutes piquées de taches de rousseur, l’index durci et déchiqueté par l’aiguille, une mante brune de laine bourrue, une robe de toile et de gros souliers. C’était Fantine.","As for the mother, her appearance was poor and sad. She had the appearance of a worker who tends to become a peasant again. She was young. Was she beautiful? may be ; but with this bet it did not appear there. Her hair, from which escaped a fair lock, seemed very thick, but disappeared severely under a cap of beguine, ugly, tight, narrow, and tied at the chin. Laughter shows the beautiful teeth when one has them; but she did not laugh. His eyes didn't seem to have been dry for very long. She was pale; she looked very tired and a little sick; she looked at her sleeping daughter in her arms with that particular air of a mother who has nursed her child. A large blue handkerchief like those where the invalids blow their nose, folded into a neckerchief, heavily concealed her waist. Her hands were tanned and freckled, her index finger hardened and torn by the needle, a brown coat of gruff wool, a linen dress, and heavy shoes. It was Fantine.","As for the mother, she was a poor and sorry sight. She was dressed like a seamstress reverting to peasant again. She was young. Was she beautiful? Maybe, but the way she was dressed it was hard to tell. Her hair looked very thick but was austerely hidden under an ugly, thick-woven, close-fitting coif tied under the chin, with one blonde lock escaping. Laughter shows off beautiful teeth if you have them, but she did not laugh. Her eyes looked as if they had not been dry for a very long time. She was pale. She seemed very weary and a little unwell. She gazed at her daughter sleeping in her arms with that distinctive look of a mother who has nursed her child. A large blue handkerchief, such as war veterans use for blowing their noses, folded into a fichu, unflatteringly concealed her figure. She had weathered hands all covered with freckles, a forefinger hardened and roughened by the needle, a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a calico gown and heavy shoes. It was Fantine.","As for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. She was dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again. She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire it was not apparent.

A smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance. She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child.

"« L’homme se ranimait tout en mangeant. Mon frère lui faisait boire de ce bon vin de Mauves dont il ne boit pas lui-même parce qu’il dit que c’est du vin cher. Mon frère lui disait tous ces détails avec cette gaîté aisée que vous lui connaissez, entre-mêlant ses paroles de façons gracieuses pour moi. Il est beaucoup revenu sur ce bon état de grurin, comme s’il eût souhaité que cet homme comprît, sans le lui conseiller directement et durement, que ce serait un asile pour lui. Une chose m’a frappée. Cet homme était ce que je vous ai dit. Eh bien ! mon frère, pendant tout le souper, ni de toute la soirée, à l’exception de quelques paroles sur Jésus quand il est entré, n’a pas dit un mot qui pût rappeler à cet homme qui il était ni apprendre à cet homme qui était mon frère. C’était bien une occasion en apparence de faire un peu de sermon et d’appuyer l’évêque sur le galérien pour laisser la marque du passage. Il eût paru peut-être à un autre que c’était le cas, ayant ce malheureux sous la main, de lui nourrir l’âme en même temps que le corps et de lui faire quelque reproche assaisonné de morale et de conseil, ou bien un peu de commisération avec exhortation de se mieux conduire à l’avenir. Mon frère ne lui a même pas demandé de quel pays il était, ni son histoire. Car dans son histoire il y a sa faute, et mon frère semblait éviter tout ce qui pouvait l’en faire souvenir. C’est au point qu’à un certain moment, comme mon frère parlait des montagnards de Pontarlier qui ont un doux travail près du ciel et qui, ajoutait-il, sont heureux parce qu’ils sont innocents, il s’est arrêté court, craignant qu’il n’y eût dans ce mot qui lui échappait quelque chose qui pût froisser l’homme. A force d’y réfléchir, je crois avoir compris ce qui se passait dans le cœur de mon frère. Il pensait sans doute que cet homme, qui s’appelle Jean Valjean, n’avait que trop sa misère présente à l’esprit, que le mieux était de l’en distraire, et de lui faire croire, ne fût-ce qu’un moment, qu’il était une personne comme une autre, en étant pour lui tout ordinaire. N’est-ce pas là en effet bien entendre la charité ? N’y a-t-il pas, bonne madame, quelque chose de vraiment évangélique dans cette délicatesse qui s’abstient de sermon, de morale et d’allusion, et la meilleure pitié, quand un homme a un point douloureux, n’est-ce pas de n’y pas toucher du tout ? Il m’a semblé que ce pouvait être là la pensée intérieure de mon frère. Dans tous les cas, ce que je puis dire, c’est que, s’il a eu toutes ces idées, il n’en a rien marqué, même pour moi ; il a été d’un bout à l’autre le même homme que tous les soirs, et il a soupé avec ce Jean Valjean du même air et de la même façon qu’il aurait soupé avec M. Gédéon Le Prévost ou avec M. le curé de la paroisse.","“The man revived while eating. My brother used to make him drink this good Mauves wine which he himself does not drink because he says it is expensive wine. My brother told him all these details with that easy gaiety that you know from him, interweaving his words in graceful ways for me. He went back a lot on this good state of grurin, as if he wanted this man to understand, without advising him directly and harshly, that it would be an asylum for him. One thing struck me. This man was what I told you. Well ! my brother, during the whole supper, nor the whole evening, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when he entered, did not say a word which could remind this man who he was nor teach this man who was my brother. It was indeed an opportunity in appearance to give a little sermon and to support the bishop on the galley slave to leave the mark of the passage. It would perhaps have seemed to another that it was the case, having this unfortunate man at hand, to nourish his soul at the same time as his body and to reproach him seasoned with morality and advice, or else a little commiseration with an exhortation to behave better in the future. My brother didn't even ask him what country he was from or his story. Because in his story there is his fault, and my brother seemed to avoid anything that could remind him of it. It is to the point that at a certain moment, as my brother was talking about the mountaineers of Pontarlier who have a sweet job close to the sky and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, he stopped short. , fearing that there was in this word which escaped him something which might offend the man. Thinking about it, I think I understood what was going on in my brother's heart. He doubtless thought that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had his misery too much in mind, that the best thing was to distract him from it, and make him believe, if only for a moment, that he was a person like any other, while being quite ordinary for him. Isn't that really understanding charity? Is there not, good madam, something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon, morality and allusion, and the best pity, when a man has a sore spot, does not isn't it not to touch it at all? It seemed to me that this might be my brother's inner thought. In any case, what I can say is that, if he had all these ideas, he made no impression on them, even for me; he was from beginning to end the same man as every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in the same way that he would have supped with M. Gédéon Le Prévost or with M. the parish priest.","The man’s spirits revived as he ate. My brother served him that good Mauves wine he does not drink himself because he says it is an expensive wine. My brother told him all these details with that relaxed cheerfulness you know he has, combining his words with thoughtfulness towards me. He kept coming back to this honest job of grurin, as if, without saying so directly and without forcing this advice on him, he hoped the man would understand that it would offer him sanctuary. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well, apart from a few remarks about Jesus when he came in, my brother did not say a single word throughout the whole meal, or the entire evening, that might remind the man of what he was, or impress on him who my brother was. It was certainly an opportunity, on the face of it, for a bit of a sermon and for the bishop to impress himself on the ex-convict and leave his mark. It might have seemed to anyone else that now was the time, when he had the poor wretch right there, to nourish his soul as well as his body, and to voice either some censure leavened with moral instruction and advice, or a little pity with an exhortation to behave better in the future. My brother did not even ask him where he came from or about his past. For in his past lay his wrong-doing, and my brother seemed to avoid anything that might remind him of it. So much so that at one point, when my brother was talking about the mountain-dwellers of Pontarlier who have pleasant work close to heaven – and are happy, he added, because they are innocent – he stopped short, fearing there might be something to cause the man offence in this remark he had let slip. Having reflected on it, I believe I understand what was in my brother’s heart. Doubtless he thought this man, who is called Jean Valjean, was only too well aware of his wretchedness. That the best thing was to distract him from it and, by behaving normally towards him, to make him think, if only for a moment, that he was like any other person. Is that not a real understanding of charity? Is there not, dear madame, something truly evangelical in such delicacy that refrains from sermonizing, moralizing and criticizing? And when a man has a sore point, is not the ultimate pity not to touch on it at all? It seemed to me this might have been my brother’s inward thought. In any case, what I can say is that if he did have all these thoughts there was no way of telling, even for me. He was throughout no different from the way he is every evening, and he took his supper with this Jean Valjean in the same spirit and in the same manner as he would have taken his supper with Monsieur Gédéon Le Prévost or our local parish priest.","“The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink that good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says that wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin, as though he wished the man to understand, without advising him directly and harshly, that this would afford him a refuge. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my brother utter a single word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when he entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my brother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that a mark of the passage might remain behind. This might have appeared to any one else who had this, unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body, and to bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned with moralizing and advice, or a little commiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future. My brother did not even ask him from what country he came, nor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault, and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it. To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise a gentle labor near heaven, and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint of reflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my brother’s heart. He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing was to divert him from it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily, that he was a person like any other, by treating him just in his ordinary way. Is not this indeed, to understand charity well? Is there not, dear Madame, something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon, from moralizing, from allusions? and is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all? It has seemed to me that this might have been my brother’s private thought. In any case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he gave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same as he is every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with M. Gédéon le Prévost, or with the curate of the parish.","“The man became animated even while he was eating. My brother gave him some good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says it is too dear. My brother gave him all these details with that easy gaiety which you know is peculiar to him, intermingling his words with compliments for me. He dwelt much upon the good condition of a grurin, as if he wished that this man should understand, without advising him directly, and abruptly, that it would be an asylum for him. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well! my brother, during the supper, and during the entire evening, with the exception of a few words about Jesus, when he entered, did not say a word which could recall to this man who he himself was, nor indicate to him who my brother was. It was apparently a fine occasion to get in a little sermon, and to set up the bishop above the convict in order to make an impression upon his mind. It would, perhaps, have appeared to some to be a duty, having this unhappy man in hand, to feed the mind at the same time with the body, and to administer reproof, seasoned with morality and advice, or at least a little pity accompanied by an exhortation to conduct himself better in future. My brother asked him neither his country nor his history; for his crime lay in his history, and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could recall it to him. At one time, as my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who have a pleasant labour near heaven, and who, he added, are happy, because they are innocent, he stopped short, fearing there might have been in this word which had escaped him something which could wound the feelings of this man. Upon reflection, I think I understand what was passing in my brother’s mind. He thought, doubtless, that this man, who called himself Jean Valjean, had his wretchedness too constantly before his mind; that it was best not to distress him by referring to it, and to make him think, if it were only for a moment, that he was a common person like any one else, by treating him thus in the ordinary way. Is not this really understanding charity? Is there not, dear madame, something truly evangelical in this delicacy, which abstains from sermonising, moralising, and making allusions, and is it not the wisest sympathy, when a man has a suffering point, not to touch upon it at all? It seems to me that this was my brother’s inmost thought. At any rate, all I can say is, if he had all these ideas, he did not show them even to me: he was, from beginning to end, the same as on other evenings, and he took supper with this Jean Valjean with the same air and manner that he would have supped with Monsieur Gédéon, the provost, or with the curé of the parish."

"― Cependant, reprit le président, même dans l’homme que la loi a dégradé, il peut rester, quand la pitié divine le permet, un sentiment d’honneur et d’équité. C’est à ce sentiment que je fais appel à cette heure décisive.

"Dans les premiers temps, quand on le vit commencer, les bonnes âmes dirent : C’est un gaillard qui veut s’enrichir. Quand on le vit enrichir le pays avant de s’enrichir lui-même, les mêmes bonnes âmes dirent : C’est un ambitieux. Cela semblait d’autant plus probable que cet homme était religieux, et même pratiquait dans une certaine mesure, chose fort bien vue à cette époque. Il allait régulièrement entendre une basse messe tous les dimanches. Le député local, qui flairait partout des concurrences, ne tarda pas à s’inquiéter de cette religion. Ce député, qui avait été membre du corps législatif de l’empire, partageait les idées religieuses d’un père de l’oratoire connu sous le nom de Fouché, duc d’Otrante, dont il avait été la créature et l’ami. A huis clos il riait de Dieu doucement. Mais quand il vit le riche manufacturier Madeleine aller à la basse messe de sept heures, il entrevit un candidat possible, et résolut de le dépasser ; il prit un confesseur jésuite et alla à la grand’messe et à vêpres. L’ambition en ce temps-là était, dans l’acception directe du mot, une course au clocher. Les pauvres profitèrent de cette terreur comme le bon Dieu, car l’honorable député fonda aussi deux lits à l’hôpital ; ce qui fit douze.","In the early days, when we saw him start, the good souls said: He is a fellow who wants to get rich. When we saw him enriching the country before enriching himself, the same good souls said: He is ambitious. This seemed all the more probable since this man was religious, and even practiced to a certain extent, something very well seen at that time. He regularly went to hear a low mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who sniffed out competition everywhere, was not long in worrying about this religion. This deputy, who had been a member of the legislative body of the empire, shared the religious ideas of a father of the oratory known by the name of Fouché, Duke of Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. Behind closed doors he laughed softly at God. But when he saw the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock, he glimpsed a possible candidate, and resolved to pass him; he took a Jesuit confessor and went to high mass and vespers. Ambition in those days was, in the direct sense of the word, a race for the steeple. The poor took advantage of this terror like the good Lord, for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital; which made twelve.","In the early days, watching him start out, charitable souls said, ‘He’s a self-seeker who wants to become rich.’ When they saw him enriching the community before he enriched himself, the same charitable souls said, ‘He’s an ambitious fellow.’ This seemed all the more probable as the man was religious, and even to some extent religiously observant, something very favourably looked on at that time. He regularly attended low mass every Sunday. Before long the local deputy, who suspected rivals everywhere, began to fret about this religion. The deputy, who had been a member of the Legislative Corps under the Empire, shared the religious views of an Oratorian father known by the name of Fouché, Duc d’Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. Behind closed doors he quietly made fun of God. But when he saw the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o’clock, he detected in him a likely candidate and resolved to outdo him. He took a Jesuit confessor and attended high mass and vespers. At that time ambition was literally a steeplechase. The poor as well as the good Lord profited by his dread, for the honourable deputy also funded two beds in the hospital, which made a total of twelve.","At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, “He’s a jolly fellow who means to get rich.” When they saw him enriching the country before he enriched himself, the good souls said, “He is an ambitious man.” This seemed all the more probable since the man was religious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch. He went regularly to low mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalry everywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the religious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name of Fouché, Duc d’Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. He indulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors. But when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o’clock, he perceived in him a possible candidate, and resolved to outdo him; he took a Jesuit confessor, and went to high mass and to vespers. Ambition was at that time, in the direct acceptation of the word, a race to the steeple. The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God, for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital, which made twelve.","At first, when he began to attract the public attention, the good people would say: “This is a fellow who wishes to get rich.” When they saw him enrich the country before he enriched himself, the same good people said: “This man is ambitious.” This seemed the more probable, since he was religious and observed the forms of the church, to a certain extent, a thing much approved in those days. He went regularly to hear mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who scented rivalry everywhere, was not slow to borrow trouble on account of Madeleine’s religion. This deputy, who had been a member of the Corps Legislatif of the Empire, partook of the religious ideas of a Father of the Oratory, known by the name of Fouché, Duke of Otranto, whose creature and friend he had been. In private he jested a little about God. But when he saw the rich manufacturer, Madeleine, go to low mass at seven o’clock, he foresaw a possible candidate in opposition to himself, and he resolved to outdo him. He took a Jesuit confessor, and went both to high mass and to vespers. Ambition at that time was, as the word itself imports, of the nature of a steeplechase. The poor, as well as God, gained by the terror of the honourable deputy, for he also established two beds at the hospital, which made twelve."

Ah ! quand on l’a, on n’est plus dupe ; on ne se laisse pas bêtement exiler comme Caton, ni lapider comme Étienne, ni brûler vif comme Jeanne d’Arc. Ceux qui ont réussi à se procurer ce matérialisme admirable ont la joie de se sentir irresponsables, et de penser qu’ils peuvent dévorer tout sans inquiétude, les places, les sinécures, les dignités, le pouvoir bien ou mal acquis, les palinodies lucratives, les trahisons utiles, les savoureuses capitulations de conscience, et qu’ils entreront dans la tombe, leur digestion faite. Comme c’est agréable ! Je ne dis pas cela pour vous, monsieur le sénateur. Cependant il m’est impossible de ne point vous féliciter. Vous autres grands seigneurs, vous avez, vous le dites, une philosophie à vous et pour vous, exquise, raffinée, accessible aux riches seuls, bonne à toutes les sauces, assaisonnant admirablement les voluptés de la vie. Cette philosophie est prise dans les profondeurs et déterrée par des chercheurs spéciaux. Mais vous êtes bons princes, et vous ne trouvez pas mauvais que la croyance au bon Dieu soit la philosophie du peuple, à peu près comme l’oie aux marrons est la dinde aux truffes du pauvre.","―There you go! he cried. What an excellent and truly marvelous thing is this materialism! Whoever wants it doesn't have it. Ah! when one has it, one is no longer fooled; one does not let oneself be stupidly exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Joan of Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without anxiety, places, sinecures, dignities, power well or ill acquired, lucrative palinodies, the useful betrayals, the savory capitulations of conscience, and that they will enter the grave, their digestion done. How pleasant! I am not saying this for you, senator. However, it is impossible for me not to congratulate you. You other great lords, you have, you say, a philosophy of yours and for yourselves, exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, admirably seasoning the pleasures of life. This philosophy is taken to the depths and unearthed by special seekers. But you are good princes, and you don't find it wrong that belief in the good God is the philosophy of the people, much as the goose with chestnuts is the turkey with truffles of the poor.","‘Well said!’ he exclaimed. ‘What an excellent and truly marvellous thing that kind of materialism is! It takes more than wanting to come by it. But when you do, ah, you’re no longer fooled. You don’t stupidly allow yourself to be exiled like Cato, or stoned like Stephen, or burned alive like Joan of Arc. Those that do manage to avail themselves of this admirable materialism have the pleasure of feeling irresponsible and of thinking they can gobble up everything without worrying – positions, sinecures, distinctions, power whether honestly or dishonestly come by, lucrative retractions, advantageous betrayals , delectable compromises with their conscience – and that they shall go to their graves having digested the lot. How satisfying! I don’t say this for your sake, monsieur le sénateur. However, I can only congratulate you. You fine gentlemen, as you say, have a philosophy of your own, for yourselves. An exquisite, refined philosophy available only to the rich, to be served up in all kinds of ways, wonderfully adding relish to the pleasures of life. This philosophy is extracted from the hidden depths and unearthed by expert seekers. But you are kindly princes and you don’t mind that belief in God should be the philosophy of the people, rather in the same way that goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.’","“That’s talking!” he exclaimed. “What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it can have it.

How agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator. Nevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you. You great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably. This philosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers. But you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.”","“That is the idea,” he exclaimed. “This materialism is an excellent thing, and truly marvellous; reject it who will. Ah! when one has it, he is a dupe no more; he does not stupidly allow himself to be exiled like Cato, or stoned like Stephen, or burnt alive like Joan of Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the happiness of feeling that they are irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything in quietness—places, sinecures, honours, power rightly or wrongly acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treasons, savoury capitulations of conscience, and that they will enter their graves with their digestion completed. How agreeable it is! I do not say that for you, Monsieur Senator. Nevertheless, I cannot but felicitate you. You great lords have, you say, a philosophy of your own, for your special benefit—exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone; good with all sauces, admirably seasoning the pleasures of life. This philosophy is found at great depths, and brought up by special search.

"C’était l’époque où l’antique roman classique, qui, après avoir été Clélie, n’était plus que Lodoïska, toujours noble, mais de plus en plus vulgaire, tombé de mademoiselle de Scudéri à madame Bournon-Malarme et de madame de Lafayette à madame Barthélemy-Hadot, incendiait l’âme aimante des portières de Paris et ravageait même un peu la banlieue. Madame Thénardier était juste assez intelligente pour lire ces espèces de livres. Elle s’en nourrissait. Elle y noyait ce qu’elle avait de cervelle ; cela lui avait donné, tant qu’elle avait été très jeune, et même un peu plus tard, une sorte d’attitude pensive près de son mari, coquin d’une certaine profondeur, ruffian lettré à la grammaire près, grossier et fin en même temps, mais, en fait de sentimentalisme, lisant Pigault-Lebrun, et pour « tout ce qui touche le sexe », comme il disait dans son jargon, butor correct et sans mélange. Sa femme avait quelque douze ou quinze ans de moins que lui. Plus tard, quand les cheveux romanesquement pleureurs commencèrent à grisonner, quand la Mégère se dégagea de la Paméla, la Thénardier ne fut plus qu’une grosse méchante femme ayant savouré des romans bêtes. Or on ne lit pas impunément des niaiseries. Il en résulta que sa fille aînée se nomma Éponine. Quant à la cadette, la pauvre petite faillit se nommer Gulnare ; elle dut à je ne sais quelle heureuse diversion faite par un roman de Ducray-Duminil, de ne s’appeler qu’Azelma.","It was the time when the ancient classic novel, which, after having been Clélie, was now only Lodoïska, still noble but increasingly vulgar, fell from Mademoiselle de Scudéri to Madame Bournon-M alarm and from Madame from Lafayette to Madame Barthélemy-Hadot, set fire to the loving soul of the porters of Paris and even ravaged the suburbs a little. Madame Thénardier was just smart enough to read these kinds of books. She fed on it. She drowned in it all her brains; it had given her, as long as she was very young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive attitude near her same time, but, in fact of sentimentalism, reading Pigault-Lebrun, and for “all that touches the sex”, as it said in its jargon, correct and unmixed bittern. His wife was some twelve or fifteen years younger than him. Later, when the romantically weeping hair began to turn gray, when the Shrew freed herself from the Pamela, the Thénardier was no more than a fat, wicked woman who had savored stupid novels. However, one does not read nonsense with impunity. As a result, his eldest daughter was named Éponine. As for the youngest, the poor little one was nearly named Gulnare; she owed to some happy diversion made by a novel by Ducray-Duminil, that she was called only Azelma.","It was the age when the classic period novel – that having once been Clélie was now a mere Lodoïska, still high-minded but increasingly vulgar, reduced from Mademoiselle de Scudéry to Madame Barthélémy-Hadot, and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Bournon-Malarme – inflamed the lovesick souls of Paris’s doorkeepers and even wreaked a little havoc in the suburbs. Madame Thénardier was just intelligent enough to read books of this kind. They were her staple diet. She steeped in them what brain she possessed. This had given her, when she was very young and even a little later, a kind of pensiveness in the company of her husband, a rascal of a certain knowingness, a literate ruffian but no grammarian, at once coarse and shrewd, but as regards sentiment a reader of Pigault-Lebrun; and as for ‘anything to do with sex’, as his own turn of phrase would have it, an absolute thoroughgoing lout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was. Later, when her Romantically cascading hair began to turn grey, when out of Pamela emerged Megaera, the Thénardier woman was just a nasty fat woman with a taste for silly novels. Now, nonsense cannot be read with impunity. The result was that her elder daughter’s name was Éponine. As for the younger, the poor little thing was very nearly named Gulnare. She owed it to who knows what happy distraction afforded by one of Ducray-Duminil’s novels only to be called Azelma.","It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after having been Clélie, was no longer anything but Lodoïska, still noble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle de Scudéri to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Barthélemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. Madame Thénardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books. She lived on them. In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This had given her, when very young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the same time, but, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and “in what concerns the sex,” as he said in his jargon—a downright, unmitigated lout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was. Later on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, began to grow gray, when the Megæra began to be developed from the Pamela, the female Thénardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who had dabbled in stupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with impunity. The result was that her eldest daughter was named Éponine; as for the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare; I know not to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.","It was the time when the antique classical romance, which, after having been Clelié, sank to Lodoïska, always noble, but becoming more and more vulgar, falling from Mdlle. de Scuderi to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Barthélemy-Hadot, was firing the loving souls of the portresses of Paris, and making some ravages even in the suburbs. Madame Thénardier was just intelligent enough to read that sort of book. She fed on them. She drowned what little brain she had in them and that had given her, while she was yet young, and even in later life, a kind of pensive attitude towards her husband, a knave of some calibre; a ruffian, educated almost to the extent of grammar; at once coarse and fine, but so far as sentimentalism was concerned, reading Pigault Lebrun, and in “all which related to the sex,” as he said in his jargon, a correct dolt without adulteration. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he. At a later period, when the hair of the romantic weepers began to grow grey, when Mégère parted company with Pamela, Madame Thénardier was only a gross bad woman who had relished stupid novels. Now, people do not read stupidities with impunity. The result was, that her eldest child was named Eponine, and the youngest, who had just escaped being called Gulnare, owed to some happy diversion made by a novel of Ducray Duminil, the mitigation of Azelma."

"La règle de l’adoration perpétuelle est d’une telle rigidité qu’elle épouvante ; les vocations reculent, l’ordre ne se recrute pas. En 1845, il se faisait encore çà et là quelques sœurs converses ; mais de religieuses de chœur, point. Il y a quarante ans, les religieuses étaient près de cent ; il y a quinze ans, elles n’étaient plus que vingt-huit. Combien sont-elles aujourd’hui ? En 1847, la prieure était jeune, signe que le cercle du choix se restreint. Elle n’avait pas quarante ans. A mesure que le nombre diminue, la fatigue augmente ; le service de chacune devient plus pénible ; on voyait dès lors approcher le moment où elles ne seraient plus qu’une douzaine d’épaules douloureuses et courbées pour porter la lourde règle de saint Benoît. Le fardeau est implacable et reste le même à peu comme à beaucoup. Il pesait, il écrase. Aussi elles meurent. Du temps que l’auteur de ce livre habitait encore Paris, deux sont mortes. L’une avait vingt-cinq ans ; l’autre vingt-trois. Celle-ci peut dire comme Julia Alpinula : Hic jaceo. Vixi armos viginti et tres. C’est à cause de cette décadence que le couvent a renoncé à l’éducation des filles.","The rule of perpetual adoration is so rigid that it is appalling; vocations recede, the order cannot be recruited. In 1845 there were still a few lay sisters here and there; but of choir nuns, not. Forty years ago there were nearly a hundred nuns; fifteen years ago there were only twenty-eight. How many are there today? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that the circle of choice was narrowing. She was not forty years old. As the number decreases, fatigue increases; the service of each becomes more painful; from then on, we could see the moment approaching when they would be no more than a dozen painful and bent shoulders to carry the heavy rule of Saint Benedict. The burden is relentless and remains the same to few as to many. It weighed down, it crushes. So they die. While the author of this book was still living in Paris, two died. One was twenty-five years old; the other twenty-three. This one can say like Julia Alpinula: Hic jaceo. Vixi armos viginti et tres. It is because of this decadence that the convent gave up the education of girls.","The rule of Perpetual Adoration is so rigid, it is daunting. Vocations shrink from it, the order is not attracting recruits. In 1845 there were still the odd few here and there becoming lay sisters. But not cloistered nuns. Forty years ago the nuns numbered close on one hundred. Fifteen years ago they were no more than twenty-eight. How many are they today? In 1847 the prioress was young, a sign that the pool of choice is diminishing. She was not forty years old. As the number drops, the strain increases. What is required of each nun becomes more taxing. The day when there would be only a dozen bowed and aching shoulders to bear the heavy Rule of St Benedict could be seen approaching even then. The burden is relentless and remains the same, for few or for many. It is oppressive, it is overwhelming. And so they die. Two died in the days when the author of this book was still living in Paris. One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three – she, like Julia Alpinula, can say: Hic jaceo. Vixi annos viginti et tres.† It is because of this decline that the convent gave up educating girls.","The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that it alarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits.

The burden is implacable, and remains the same for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they die. At the period when the author of this book still lived in Paris, two died. One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three. This latter can say, like Julia Alpinula: “ Hic jaceo.

"Et les uns accouraient, et les autres se rangeaient ; car un roi qui passe, c’est toujours un tumulte. Du reste l’apparition et la disparition de Louis XVIII faisaient un certain effet dans les rues de Paris. Cela était rapide, mais majestueux. Ce roi impotent avait le goût du grand galop ; ne pouvant marcher, il voulait courir ; ce cul-de-jatte se fût fait volontiers traîner par l’éclair. Il passait, pacifique et sévère, au milieu des sabres nus. Sa berline massive, toute dorée, avec de grosses branches de lys peintes sur les panneaux, roulait bruyamment. A peine avait-on le temps d’y jeter un coup d’œil. On voyait dans l’angle du fond à droite, sur des coussins capitonnés de satin blanc, une face large, ferme et vermeille, un front frais poudré à l’oiseau royal, un œil fier, dur et fin, un sourire de lettré, deux grosses épaulettes à torsades flottantes sur un habit bourgeois, la toison d’or, la croix de Saint-Louis, la croix de la légion d’honneur, la plaque d’argent du saint-esprit, un gros ventre et un large cordon bleu ; c’était le roi. Hors de Paris, il tenait son chapeau à plumes blanches sur ses genoux emmaillottés de hautes guêtres anglaises ; quand il rentrait dans la ville, il mettait son chapeau sur sa tête, saluant peu. Il regardait froidement le peuple, qui le lui rendait. Quand il parut pour la première fois dans le quartier Saint-Marceau, tout son succès fut ce mot d’un faubourien à son camarade : « C’est ce gros-là qui est le gouvernement. »","And some ran up, and others ranged themselves; for a passing king is always a tumult. Moreover, the appearance and disappearance of Louis XVIII had a certain effect on the streets of Paris. It was fast, but majestic. This impotent king had a taste for galloping; unable to walk, he wanted to run; this cul-de-jatte would willingly have been dragged by the lightning. He passed, peaceful and severe, in the midst of bare sabers. His massive sedan, all gilded, with large branches of lilies painted on the panels, rolled along noisily. We barely had time to take a look. One could see in the back corner on the right, on cushions padded with white satin, a large, firm and vermilion face, a fresh forehead powdered with the royal bird, a proud, hard and delicate eye, a scholar's smile, two large epaulets with floating twists on a bourgeois coat, the golden fleece, the cross of Saint-Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver plate of the Holy Spirit, a large belly and a wide cord blue ; he was the king. Outside Paris, he held his hat with white feathers on his knees swaddled in high English gaiters; when he entered the city, he put his hat on his head, greeting little. He looked coldly at the people, who reciprocated. When it appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau district, all its success was this word from a suburbanite to his comrade: ""It's that big guy who is the government. »","And some came running, and others lined up, for there is always a noisy crowd when a king goes by. Besides, the appearance and disappearance of Louis XVIII created a certain impression on the streets of Paris. It was swift but majestic. This impotent king liked to ride at full gallop. Unable to walk, he wanted to go fast: this cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by lightning. Peaceable and severe, he went about surrounded by drawn sabres. His massive coach, all gilt with large emblems of lilies painted on the panels, would thunder by. There was hardly time to catch a glimpse of it. You would see in the rear right-hand corner against white satin upholstered cushions an impassive broad scarlet face, a freshly powdered forehead with a oiseau royal hairstyle*; a proud, stern, shrewd eye, a scholar’s smile, two big epaulettes with bullion fringes on a civilian coat, the Golden Fleece, the cross of St Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honour, the Holy Spirit silver plaque, a large belly and a wide blue sash: it was the king. Outside of Paris he kept his white-plumed hat on his knees wrapped in their long English gaiters. When he came back into the city he put his hat on his head, waving rarely. He stared coldly at the people, who responded likewise. When he appeared for the first time in the St-Marceau district, his entire success resided in the remark one local inhabitant made to his companion, ‘That bigwig there’s the government.’","And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king always creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of Louis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris.

There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered à l’oiseau royal, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide blue ribbon: it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and saluted rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in kind. When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter, the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, “That big fellow yonder is the government.”","And some ran, and others fell into line; for when a king passes by, there is always a tumult.

Outside of Paris, he held his hat with white feathers upon his knees, which were inclosed in high English gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he placed his hat upon his head, bowing but little. He looked coldly upon the people, who returned his look. When he appeared for the first time in the Quartier Saint Marceau, all he succeeded in eliciting was this saying of a resident to his comrade: “It’s that big fellow who is the government.”"

"La guerre de 1823, attentat à la généreuse nation espagnole, était donc en même temps un attentat à la révolution française. Cette voie de fait monstrueuse, c’était la France qui la commettait ; de force ; car, en dehors des guerres libératrices, tout ce que font les armées, elles le font de force. Le mot obéissance passive l’indique. Une armée est un étrange chef-d’œuvre de combinaison où la force résulte d’une somme énorme d’impuissance. Ainsi s’explique la guerre, faite par l’humanité contre l’humanité malgré l’humanité.","The war of 1823, an attack on the generous Spanish nation, was therefore at the same time an attack on the French Revolution. This monstrous assault, it was France who committed it; of strength; for, apart from liberating wars, everything armies do, they do by force. The word passive obedience indicates this. An army is a strange masterpiece of combination where strength results from an enormous amount of helplessness. This explains the war waged by humanity against humanity in spite of humanity.","The war of 1823, an outrage against the brave Spanish people, was at the same time, therefore, an outrage against the French Revolution. It was France that committed this monstrous offence – by violence, for aside from wars of liberation everything armies do is done by violence. The term ‘unquestioning obedience’ indicates this. An army is a strangely contrived masterpiece by which force results from an enormous amount of powerlessness. This is the explanation of war, waged by humanity against humanity despite humanity.","The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was then, at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. It was France who committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, for, with the exception of wars of liberation, everything that armies do is by foul means. The words passive obedience indicate this. An army is a strange masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum of impotence. Thus is war, made by humanity against humanity, despite humanity, explained.","The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was, at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. This monstrous deed of violence France committed, but by compulsion; for, aside from wars of liberation, all that armies do they do by compulsion. The words passive obedience tell the tale. An army is a wondrous masterpiece of combination, in which might is the result of an enormous sum-total of utter weakness. Thus only can we explain a war waged by humanity against humanity, in despite of humanity."

"Par suite des pluies de la nuit, les convois de vivres, empêtrés dans des routes défoncées, n’avaient pu arriver le matin, le soldat n’avait pas dormi, était mouillé, et était à jeun ; cela n’avait pas empêché Napoléon de crier allègrement à Ney : Nous avons quatrevingt-dix chances sur cent. A huit heures, on avait apporté le déjeuner de l’empereur. Il y avait invité plusieurs généraux. Tout en déjeunant, on avait raconté que Wellington était l’avant-veille au bal à Bruxelles, chez la duchesse de Richmond, et Soult, rude homme de guerre avec sa figure d’archevêque, avait dit : Le bal, c’est aujourd’hui. L’empereur avait plaisanté Ney qui disait : Wellington ne sera pas assez simple pour attendre votre majesté. C’était là d’ailleurs sa manière. Il badinait volontiers, dit Fleury de Chaboulon. Le fond de son caractère était une humeur enjouée, dit Gourgaud. Il abondait en plaisanteries plutôt bizarres que spirituelles, dit Benjamin Constant. Ces gaîtés de géant valent la peine qu’on y insiste. C’est lui qui avait appelé ses grenadiers « les grognards » ; il leur pinçait l’oreille, il leur tirait la moustache. L’empereur ne faisait que nous faire des niches ; ceci est un mot de l’un d’eux. Pendant le mystérieux trajet de l’île d’Elbe en France, le 27 février, en pleine mer, le brick de guerre français le Zéphir ayant rencontré le brick l’Inconstant où Napoléon était caché et ayant demandé à l’Inconstant des nouvelles de Napoléon, l’empereur, qui avait encore en ce moment-là à son chapeau la cocarde blanche et amarante semée d’abeilles, adoptée par lui à l’île d’Elbe, avait pris en riant le porte-voix et avait répondu lui-même : L’empereur se porte bien. Qui rit de la sorte est en familiarité avec les événements. Napoléon avait eu plusieurs accès de rire pendant le déjeuner de Waterloo. Après le déjeuner il s’était recueilli un quart d’heure, puis deux généraux s’étaient assis sur la botte de paille, une plume à la main, une feuille de papier sur le genou, et l’empereur leur avait dicté l’ordre de bataille.","As a result of the rains of the night, the food convoys, entangled in the rutted roads, had not been able to arrive in the morning, the soldier had not slept, was wet, and was fasting; that had not prevented Napoleon from cheerfully shouting to Ney: We have ninety chances out of a hundred. At eight o'clock the Emperor's breakfast had been brought. He had invited several generals there. While lunching, it had been said that Wellington had been the day before at the ball in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond's, and Soult, a rough soldier with his archbishop's face, had said: The ball is today. today. The Emperor had joked Ney who said: Wellington will not be simple enough to wait for your majesty. That was his way. He liked to joke around, says Fleury de Chaboulon. The basis of his character was a playful mood, says Gourgaud. It abounded in rather bizarre than witty jokes, says Benjamin Constant. These gigantic gaieties are worth insisting on. It was he who had called his grenadiers ""the grognards""; he pinched their ears, he pulled their mustaches. The Emperor was only making niches for us; this is a word from one of them. During the mysterious voyage from the island of Elba in France, on February 27, on the open sea, the French war brig Zéphir having encountered the brig l'Inconstant where Napoleon was hiding and having asked the Inconstant for news of Napoleon, the Emperor, who at that time still wore on his hat the white and amaranth cockade strewn with bees, adopted by him on the Isle of Elba, laughingly took up the megaphone and replied -same: The emperor is well. Whoever laughs like this is familiar with events. Napoleon had had several bursts of laughter during lunch at Waterloo. After lunch he had collected himself for a quarter of an hour, then two generals had sat down on the bale of straw, a pen in their hand, a sheet of paper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to them the order of battle.","After the rains during the night the supply convoys, mired in the rutted roads, failed to arrive in the morning. The French soldier had not slept, was wet and hungry. This did not prevent Napoleon from declaring cheerfully to Ney, ‘The chances are ninety per cent in our favour.’ At eight o’clock the emperor’s breakfast was brought to him. He had invited a number of generals. During breakfast it was said that Wellington had been at a ball held in Brussels by the Duchess of Richmond the night before last, and Soult, the tough man of war with the face of an archbishop, said, ‘The ball’s today.’ The emperor had bantered with Ney, who said, ‘Wellington won’t be so foolish as to wait for Your Majesty.’ This was in any case his usual way. ‘ He joked readily,’ says Fleury de Chaboulon. ‘ He was essentially playful by nature,’ says Gourgaud. ‘ He was full of quips, more droll than witty,’ says Benjamin Constant. It is worth insisting on this giant’s light-heartedness. It was he who called his grenadiers ‘the grousers’; he pinched their ears; he pulled their moustaches. ‘The emperor did nothing but play pranks on us,’ one of them commented. On the twenty-seventh of February during the clandestine crossing from the island of Elba to France, the French brig-of-war Le Zéphyr met on the open sea the brig L’Inconstant on which Napoleon was hiding, and asked L’Inconstant for news of Napoleon. Still wearing in his hat the white and purple cockade with a bee motif that he had adopted on the isle of Elba, the emperor laughingly seized the loud-hailer, and answered for himself, ‘The emperor is in fine fettle.’ A man who laughs like that is on familiar terms with history in the making. Napoleon had several of these bouts of laughter during his breakfast at Waterloo. After the meal he ruminated for some quarter of an hour, then two generals sat on the truss of straw, pen in hand and sheet of paper on their knees, and the emperor dictated to them the order of battle.","In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports of provisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive by morning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet and fasting. This did not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, “We have ninety chances out of a hundred.” At eight o’clock the Emperor’s breakfast was brought to him. He invited many generals to it. During breakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to a ball two nights before, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond’s; and Soult, a rough man of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, “The ball takes place to-day.” The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, “Wellington will not be so simple as to wait for Your Majesty.” That was his way, however. “He was fond of jesting,” says Fleury de Chaboulon. “A merry humor was at the foundation of his character,” says Gourgaud. “He abounded in pleasantries, which were more peculiar than witty,” says Benjamin Constant. These gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence. It was he who called his grenadiers “his grumblers”; he pinched their ears; he pulled their moustaches. “The Emperor did nothing but play pranks on us,” is the remark of one of them. During the mysterious trip from the island of Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the open sea, the French brig of war, Le Zéphyr, having encountered the brig L’Inconstant, on which Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the news of Napoleon from L’Inconstant, the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white and amaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of Elba, laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself, “The Emperor is well.” A man who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events. Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the breakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an hour; then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen in hand and their paper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to them the order of battle.","In consequence of the night’s rain, the convoys of provisions mired in the softened roads, had not arrived at dawn; the soldiers had not slept, and were wet and fasting; but for all this Napoleon cried out joyfully to Ney: We have ninety chances in a hundred. At eight o’clock the emperor’s breakfast was brought. He had invited several generals. While breakfasting, it was related, that on the night but one before, Wellington was at a ball in Brussels, given by the Duchess of Somerset; and Soult, rude soldier that he was, with his archbishop’s face , said: The ball is to-day. The emperor jested with Ney, who said: Wellington will not be so simple as to wait for your majesty. This was his manner usually. He was fond of joking, says Fleury de Chaboulon. His character at bottom was a playful humour, says Gourgaud. He abounded in pleasantries, oftener grotesque than witty, says Benjamin Constant. These gaieties of a giant are worthy of remembrance. He called his grenadiers “the growlers;” he would pinch their ears and would pull their moustaches. The emperor did nothing but play tricks on us; so one of them said. During the mysterious voyage from the island of Elba to France, on the 27th of February, in the open sea, the French brig-of-war Zephyr having met the brig Inconstant, on which Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the Inconstant for news of Napoleon, the emperor, who still had on his hat the white and amaranth cockade, sprinkled with bees, adopted by him in the island of Elba, took the speaking-trumpet, with a laugh, and answered himself: the emperor is getting on finely. He who laughs in this way is on familiar terms with events; Napoleon had several of these bursts of laughter during his Waterloo breakfast. After breakfast, for a quarter of an hour, he collected his thoughts; then two generals were seated on the bundle of straw, pen in hand, and paper on knee, and the emperor dictated the order of battle."
"Dans la soirée même de Noël, plusieurs hommes, rouliers et colporteurs, étaient attablés et buvaient autour de quatre ou cinq chandelles dans la salle basse de l’auberge Thénardier. Cette salle ressemblait à toutes les salles de cabaret ; des tables, des brocs d’étain, des bouteilles, des buveurs, des fumeurs ; peu de lumière, beaucoup de bruit. La date de l’année 1823 était pourtant indiquée par les deux objets à la mode alors dans la classe bourgeoise qui étaient sur une table, savoir un kaléidoscope et une lampe de fer-blanc moiré. La Thénardier surveillait le souper qui rôtissait devant un bon feu clair ; le mari Thénardier buvait avec ses hôtes et parlait politique.","On Christmas Eve itself, several men, carters and peddlers, were seated and drinking around four or five candles in the lower room of the Thénardier inn. This hall resembled all cabaret halls; tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers; little light, a lot of noise. The date of the year 1823 was however indicated by the two fashionable objects then in the bourgeois class which were on a table, namely a kaleidoscope and a lamp of moiré tin. Madame Thénardier watched the supper which was roasting before a good clear fire; husband Thénardier drank with his guests and talked politics.","That Christmas evening several men, carters and pedlars, were seated at a table around four or five candles, drinking in the low-ceilinged room of the Thénardier inn. This room was like all tavern rooms: tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers; dimly lit, very noisy. However, the date was signalled as that of the year 1823 by two objects on the table that were then fashionable among the bourgeois class, namely a kaleidoscope and a moiré-métallique lamp. Thénardier’s wife was attending to the supper, which was roasting in front of a good blazing fire. Her husband was drinking with his customers and talking politics.","On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, were seated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles in the public room of Thénardier’s hostelry. This room resembled all drinking-shop rooms,—tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers; but little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year 1823 was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin. The female Thénardier was attending to the supper, which was roasting in front of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with his customers and talking politics.","On that Christmas evening, several men, waggoners and pedlars were seated at table and drinking around four or five candles in the low hall of the Thénardier tavern. This room resembled all bar-rooms; tables, pewtermugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers; little light, and much noise. The date, 1823, was, however, indicated by the two things then in vogue with the middle classes, which were on the table, a kaleidoscope and a fluted tin lamp. Thénardier, the wife, was looking to the supper, which was cooking before a bright blazing fire; the husband, Thénardier, was drinking with his guests and talking politics."
"On faisait sur madame Albertine cent récits. C’était l’éternelle curiosité des pensionnaires. Il y avait dans la chapelle une tribune qu’on appelait l’Œil-de-Bœuf. C’est dans cette tribune qui n’avait qu’une baie circulaire, un œil-de-bœuf, que madame Albertine assistait aux offices. Elle y était habituellement seule, parce que de cette tribune, placée au premier étage, on pouvait voir le prédicateur ou l’officiant ; ce qui était interdit aux religieuses. Un jour la chaire était occupée par un jeune prêtre de haut rang, M. le duc de Rohan, pair de France, officier des mousquetaires rouges en 1815 lorsqu’il était prince de Léon, mort après 1830 cardinal et archevêque de Besançon. C’était la première fois que M. de Rohan prêchait au couvent du Petit-Picpus. Madame Albertine assistait ordinairement aux sermons et aux offices dans un calme parfait et dans une immobilité complète. Ce jour-là, dès qu’elle aperçut M. de Rohan, elle se dressa à demi, et dit à haute voix dans le silence de la chapelle : Tiens ! Auguste ! Toute la communauté stupéfaite tourna la tête, le prédicateur leva les yeux, mais madame Albertine était retombée dans son immobilité. Un souffle du monde extérieur, une lueur de vie avait passé un moment sur cette figure éteinte et glacée, puis tout s’était évanoui, et la folle était redevenue cadavre.","A hundred stories were told about Madame Albertine. It was the eternal curiosity of the boarders. There was a gallery in the chapel called the Œil-de-Bœuf. It was in this gallery, which had only a circular opening, a bull's-eye window, that Madame Albertine attended the services. She was usually alone there, because from this platform, placed on the first floor, one could see the preacher or the celebrant; which was forbidden to nuns. One day the chair was occupied by a young high-ranking priest, M. le Duc de Rohan, peer of France, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince of Léon, died after 1830 cardinal and archbishop of Besançon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the Petit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine ordinarily assisted at sermons and services in perfect calm and in complete immobility. That day, as soon as she saw M. de Rohan, she half rose, and said aloud in the silence of the chapel: Here! Augustus! The whole amazed community turned their heads, the preacher looked up, but Madame Albertine had fallen back into her immobility. A breath from the outside world, a glimmer of life had passed for a moment over this extinct and icy face, then everything had vanished, and the madwoman had become a corpse again.","Countless tales were told about Madame Albertine. She was the object of the pupils’ perpetual curiosity. There was a gallery in the chapel called the Bull’s-Eye. It was in this gallery, which had just one round window, a bull’s-eye, that Madame Albertine attended the divine offices. She was usually on her own because from this gallery on the first floor it was possible to see the preacher or officiating priest, which was forbidden to the nuns. One day a young priest of noble birth spoke from the pulpit – Monsieur le Duc de Rohan, peer of France, an officer of the king’s musketeers when he was Prince de Léon in 1815, and who died, after 1830, a cardinal and archbishop of Besançon. This was the first time Monsieur de Rohan had preached at the Petit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine normally followed the sermons and services with a profound calm and in complete stillness. That day, as soon as she caught sight of Monsieur de Rohan, she half rose to her feet and said out loud in the silence of the chapel, ‘Well, I never! Auguste!’ The whole astounded community turned round, the preacher looked up, but Madame Albertine had fallen back motionless again. An intimation of the outside world, a glimmer of life, had momentarily passed across that cold and lifeless face, then all was gone, and the mad woman became a corpse again.","A hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery called L’Œil de Bœuf. It was in this gallery, which had only a circular bay, an œil de bœuf, that Madame Albertine listened to the offices. She always occupied it alone because this gallery, being on the level of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer of France, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince de Léon, and who died afterward, in 1830, as cardinal and Archbishop of Besançon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the Petit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services. That day, as soon as she caught sight of M. de Rohan, she half rose, and said, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, “Ah! Auguste!” The whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher raised his eyes, but Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility. A breath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished, and the mad woman had become a corpse again.","Many stories were told about Madame Albertine. She was the eternal subject of curiosity of the boarders. There was in the chapel a gallery, which was called l’Œil-de-Bœuf. In this gallery, which had only a circular opening, an œil-de-bœuf, Madame Albertine attended the offices. She was usually alone there, because from this gallery, which was elevated, the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen, which was forbidden to the nuns. One day, the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank, the Duke de Rohan, peer of France, who was an officer of the Mousquetaires Rouges in 1815, when he was Prince de Léon, and who died afterwards in 1830, a cardinal, and Archbishop of Besançon. This was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached in the convent of the Petit Picpus. Madame Albertine ordinarily attended the sermons and the offices with perfect calmness and complete silence. On that day, as soon as she saw M. de Rohan, she half rose, and, in all the stillness of the chapel, exclaimed: “What? Auguste?” The whole community were astounded, and turned their heads; the preacher raised his eyes, but Madame Albertine had fallen back into her motionless silence. A breath from the world without, a glimmer of life, had passed for a moment over that dead and icy form, then all had vanished, and the lunatic had again become a corpse."

"Dans cette adoration, elle oubliait tout, même la commission dont elle était chargée. Tout à coup, la voix rude de la Thénardier la rappela à la réalité : ― Comment, péronnelle, tu n’es pas partie !

"Nous croyons qu’il avait simplement étudié en Hollande pour être aubergiste. Ce gredin de l’ordre composite était, selon les probabilités, quelque flamand de Lille en Flandre, français à Paris, belge à Bruxelles, commodément à cheval sur deux frontières. Sa prouesse à Waterloo, on la connaît. Comme on voit, il l’exagérait un peu. Le flux et le reflux, le méandre, l’aventure, était l’élément de son existence ; conscience déchirée entraîne vie décousue ; et vraisemblablement, à l’orageuse époque du 18 juin 1814, Thénardier appartenait à cette variété de cantiniers maraudeurs dont nous avons parlé, battant l’estrade, vendant à ceux-ci, volant ceux-là, et roulant en famille, homme, femme et enfants, dans quelque carriole boiteuse, à la suite des troupes en marche, avec l’instinct de se rattacher toujours à l’armée victorieuse.

This rascal of the composite order was, according to the probabilities, some Flemish from Lille in Flanders, French in Paris, Belgian in Brussels, conveniently straddling two borders. His prowess at Waterloo, we know it. As you can see, he overdid it a bit. The ebb and flow, the meandering, the adventure, was the element of his existence; torn consciousness entails disjointed life; and probably, during the stormy period of June 18, 1814, Thénardier belonged to that variety of marauding cantiniers of which we have spoken, beating the platform, selling to these, stealing from those, and rolling in family, man, woman and children, in some lame cart, following the marching troops, with the instinct of always joining the victorious army. This campaign done, having, as he said, ""quibus"", he had come to open a tavern at Montfermeil.","We believe he had merely studied in Holland to be an innkeeper. This fraudster of a mongrel order was most likely a Fleming from Lille when in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian in Brussels, conveniently astride two frontiers. His valour at Waterloo we are already familiar with. As we can see, he exaggerated a little. The shifting, the devious, the accidental, was his natural element. A slippery conscience leads to an unsettled life, and probably at that tumultuous time around the eighteenth of June 1815 Thénardier belonged to that breed of marauding purveyors we have already mentioned, roaming about, selling to some, stealing from others, and travelling as a family man with wife and children, in some rickety cart in the wake of troops on the march, with an instinct for always attaching themselves to the victorious army. With this campaign behind him and having, as he said, ‘the wherewithal’, he had come to Montfermeil and opened an inn.","We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper. This rascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming from Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, being comfortably astride of both frontiers.

Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, was the leven of his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thénardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken, beating about the country, selling to some, stealing from others, and travelling like a family man, with wife and children, in a rickety cart, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army.

We understand his prowess at Waterloo. As we have seen, he exaggerated it a little. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, was his element; a violated conscience is followed by a loose life; and without doubt, at the stormy epoch of the 18th of June, 1815, Thénardier belonged to that species of marauding sutlers of whom we have spoken, scouring the country, robbing here and selling there, and travelling in family style, man, woman, and children, in some rickety carry-all, in the wake of marching troops, with the instinct to attach himself always to the victorious army.

"Cosette traversa ainsi le labyrinthe de rues tortueuses et désertes qui termine du côté de Chelles le village de Montfermeil. Tant qu’elle eut des maisons et même seulement des murs des deux côtés de son chemin, elle alla assez hardiment. De temps en temps, elle voyait le rayonnement d’une chandelle à travers la fente d’un volet, c’était de la lumière et de la vie, il y avait là des gens, cela la rassurait. Cependant, à mesure qu’elle avançait, sa marche se ralentissait comme machinalement. Quand elle eut passé l’angle de la dernière maison, Cosette s’arrêta. Aller au delà de la dernière boutique avait été difficile ; aller plus loin que la dernière maison, cela devenait impossible. Elle posa le seau à terre, plongea sa main dans ses cheveux et se mit à se gratter lentement la tête, geste propre aux enfants terrifiés et indécis. Ce n’était plus Montfermeil, c’étaient les champs. L’espace noir et désert était devant elle. Elle regarda avec désespoir cette obscurité où il n’y avait plus personne, où il y avait des bêtes, où il y avait peut-être des revenants. Elle regarda bien, et elle entendit les bêtes qui marchaient dans l’herbe, et elle vit distinctement les revenants qui remuaient dans les arbres. Alors elle ressaisit le seau, la peur lui donnait de l’audace : ― Bah ! dit-elle, je lui dirai qu’il n’y avait plus d’eau ! — Et elle rentra résolûment dans Montfermeil.","Cosette thus traversed the labyrinth of winding and deserted streets which ends the village of Montfermeil on the side of Chelles. As long as she had houses and even just walls on both sides of her path, she went pretty boldly. From time to time, she saw the radiance of a candle through the slit of a shutter, it was light and life, there were people there, that reassured her. However, as she advanced, her walk slowed down as if mechanically. When she had passed the corner of the last house, Cosette stopped. Getting past the last store had been difficult; to go further than the last house, it became impossible. She put the bucket on the ground, buried her hand in her hair and began to scratch her head slowly, a gesture typical of terrified and indecisive children. It was no longer Montfermeil, it was the fields. The dark, deserted space was in front of her. She looked in despair at this darkness where there was no longer anyone, where there were beasts, where there were perhaps ghosts. She looked closely, and she heard the beasts walking in the grass, and she distinctly saw the ghosts stirring in the trees. Then she grabbed the bucket again, fear gave her audacity: ―Bah! she said, I'll tell her there was no more water! ""And she returned resolutely to Montfermeil.""","Cosette thus made her way through the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets in which the village of Montfermeil on the Chelles side ends. As long as she had houses or even just walls on either side of the road, she kept going fairly confidently. From time to time she saw the glow of a candle through the chink in a shutter. That was light and life, there were people there, which reassured her. But as she went on her pace slowed as if automatically. When she had passed the corner of the last house Cosette stopped. It had been hard to go beyond the last stall. It became impossible to go beyond the last house. She put down her bucket, thrust her hand into her hair and began slowly to scratch her head, a gesture characteristic of children who are terrified and do not know what to do. This was no longer Montfermeil. It was open countryside. Before her lay the dark and deserted emptiness. She gazed in despair into this blackness where there was no one now, where there were beasts, maybe ghosts. She looked hard and heard the beasts moving in the grass and she distinctly saw the ghosts stirring in the trees. Then she picked up her bucket again. Fear made her daring. ‘Puh!’ she said. ‘I’ll tell her there was no water left!’ And she resolutely retraced her steps into Montfermeil.","In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of Chelles. So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness. From time to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a shutter—this was light and life; there were people there, and it reassured her. But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackened mechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the last house, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the last stall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last house. She set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, and began slowly to scratch her head,—a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do. It was no longer Montfermeil; it was the open fields. Black and desert space was before her. She gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one, where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took a good look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket again; fear had lent her audacity. “Bah!” said she; “I will tell him that there was no more water!” And she resolutely re-entered Montfermeil.","Cosette thus passed through the labyrinth of crooked and deserted streets, which terminates the village of Montfermeil towards Chelles. As long as she had houses, or even walls, on the sides of the road, she went on boldly enough. From time to time, she saw the light of a candle through the cracks of a shutter; it was light and life to her; there were people there; that kept up her courage. However, as she advanced, her speed slackened as if mechanically. When she had passed the corner of the last house, Cosette stopped. To go beyond the last booth had been difficult; to go further than the last house became impossible. She put the bucket on the ground, buried her hands in her hair, and began to scratch her head slowly, a motion peculiar to terrified and hesitating children. It was Montfermeil no longer, it was the open country; dark and deserted space was before her. She looked with despair into this darkness where nobody was, where there were beasts, where there were perhaps ghosts. She looked intensely, and she heard the animals walking in the grass, and she distinctly saw the ghosts moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket again; fear gave her boldness: “Pshaw,” said she, “I will tell her there isn’t any more water!” And she resolutely went back into Montfermeil."

"Ceci se passait en 1795. Jean Valjean fut traduit devant les tribunaux du temps « pour vol avec effraction la nuit dans une maison habitée ». Il avait un fusil dont il se servait mieux que tireur au monde, il était quelque peu braconnier ; ce qui lui nuisit. Il y a contre les braconniers un préjugé légitime. Le braconnier, de même que le contrebandier, côtoie de fort près le brigand. Pourtant, disons-le en passant, il y a encore un abîme entre ces races d’hommes et le hideux assassin des villes. Le braconnier vit dans la forêt ; le contrebandier vit dans la montagne ou sur la mer. Les villes font des hommes féroces, parce qu’elles font des hommes corrompus. La montagne, la mer, la forêt, font des hommes sauvages. Elles développent le côté farouche, mais souvent sans détruire le côté humain.","This happened in 1795. Jean Valjean was brought before the courts of the time “for burglary at night in an inhabited house”. He had a rifle which he used better than a shooter in the world, he was a bit of a poacher; which harmed him. There is a legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler, is very close to the brigand. Yet, let it be said in passing, there is still a gulf between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the cities. The poacher lives in the forest; the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. Cities make ferocious men, because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest, make savage men. They develop the wild side, but often without destroying the human side.","This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was brought before the law courts of the day for ‘theft with breaking and entering an occupied house at night’. He had a shotgun and was a better shot with it than any marksman in the world, for he was a bit of a poacher. This went against him. There is a legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler, is very much akin to the brigand. However, let us say in passing, there is still a gulf between this breed of men and the hideous urban murderer. The poacher lives in the forest, the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. Towns produce vicious men because they produce corrupted men. The mountains, the sea, the forest produce men of the wild; they develop the wildness in them, but often without destroying their humanity.","This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world, he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler, smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remark cursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest, the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest, make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often without destroying the humane side.","All that happened in 1795. Jean Valjean was brought before the tribunals of the time for “burglary at night, in an inhabited house.” He had a gun which he used as well as any marksman in the world and was something of a poacher, which hurt him, there being a natural prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler, approaches very nearly to the brigand. We must say, however, by the way, that there is yet a deep gulf between this race of men and the hideous assassin of the city. The poacher dwells in the forest, and the smuggler in the mountains or upon the sea; cities produce ferocious men, because they produce corrupt men; the mountains, the forest, and the sea, render men savage; they develop the fierce, but yet do not destroy the human."

"Si l’on parvenait, ce qui n’était point facile, à franchir le portier, — ce qui même pour presque tous était impossible, car il y avait un sésame, ouvre-toi ! qu’il fallait savoir ; — si, le portier franchi, on entrait à droite dans un petit vestibule où donnait un escalier resserré entre deux murs et si étroit qu’il n’y pouvait passer qu’une personne à la fois, si l’on ne se laissait pas effrayer par le badigeonnage jaune serin avec soubassement chocolat qui enduisait cet escalier, si l’on s’aventurait à monter, on dépassait un premier palier, puis un deuxième, et l’on arrivait au premier étage dans un corridor où la détrempe jaune et la plinthe chocolat vous suivaient avec un acharnement paisible. Escalier et corridor étaient éclairés par deux belles fenêtres. Le corridor faisait un coude et devenait obscur. Si l’on doublait ce cap, on parvenait après quelques pas devant une porte d’autant plus mystérieuse qu’elle n’était pas fermée. On la poussait, et l’on se trouvait dans une petite chambre d’environ six pieds carrés, carrelée, lavée, propre, froide, tendue de papier nankin à fleurettes vertes, à quinze sous le rouleau. Un jour blanc et mat venait d’une grande fenêtre à petits carreaux qui était à gauche et qui tenait toute la largeur de la chambre.

"A travers les perceptions maladives d’une nature incomplète et d’une intelligence accablée, il sentait confusément qu’une chose monstrueuse était sur lui. Dans cette pénombre obscure et blafarde où il rampait, chaque fois qu’il tournait le cou et qu’il essayait d’élever son regard, il voyait, avec une terreur mêlée de rage, s’échafauder, s’étager et monter à perte de vue au-dessus de lui, avec des escarpements horribles, une sorte d’entassement effrayant de choses, de lois, de préjugés, d’hommes et de faits, dont les contours lui échappaient, dont la masse l’épouvantait, et qui n’était autre chose que cette prodigieuse pyramide que nous appelons la civilisation. Il distinguait çà et là dans cet ensemble fourmillant et difforme, tantôt près de lui, tantôt loin et sur des plateaux inaccessibles, quelque groupe, quelque détail vivement éclairé, ici l’argousin et son bâton, ici le gendarme et son sabre, là-bas l’archevêque mitré, tout en haut, dans une sorte de soleil, l’empereur couronné et éblouissant. Il lui semblait que ces splendeurs lointaines, loin de dissiper sa nuit, la rendaient plus funèbre et plus noire. Tout cela, lois, préjugés, faits, hommes, choses, allait et venait au-dessus de lui, selon le mouvement compliqué et mystérieux que Dieu imprime à la civilisation, marchant sur lui et l’écrasant avec je ne sais quoi de paisible dans la cruauté et d’inexorable dans l’indifférence. Ames tombées au fond de l’infortune possible, malheureux hommes perdus au plus bas de ces limbes où l’on ne regarde plus, les réprouvés de la loi sentent peser de tout son poids sur leur tête cette société humaine, si formidable pour qui est dehors, si effroyable pour qui est dessous.","Through the sickly perceptions of an incomplete nature and an overwhelmed intelligence, he vaguely felt that a monstrous thing was upon him. In this dark and pale half-light where he crawled, each time he turned his neck and tried to raise his gaze, he saw, with a terror mixed with rage, scaffolding, staggering and rising at a loss. of sight above him, with horrible escarpments, a sort of frightful heap of things, of laws, of prejudices, of men and of facts, the contours of which escaped him, the mass of which terrified him, and which was nothing but that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. Here and there in this swarming and deformed ensemble, sometimes near him, sometimes far away and on inaccessible plateaus, he distinguished some group, some brightly lit detail, here the argousin and his stick, here the policeman and his sword, there below the mitred archbishop, at the very top, in a kind of sun, the crowned and dazzling emperor. It seemed to him that these distant splendours, far from dissipating his night, made it more funereal and darker. All that, laws, prejudices, facts, men, things, came and went above him, according to the complicated and mysterious movement that God imprints on civilization, walking on it and crushing it with I don't know what peacefulness in cruelty and inexorable in indifference. Souls fallen to the bottom of possible misfortune, unfortunate men lost in the depths of this limbo where one no longer looks, those who are condemned by the law feel this human society, so formidable for whoever is outside, so dreadful for who is below.","Through the morbid perceptions of a deficient nature and a defeated mind, he had an obscure feeling that some monstrous thing bore down on him. In that dim and pallid half-light in which he skulked, every time he craned his neck and tried to look up he perceived with terror and rage combined, stacked in layer upon layer above him, rising with dreadful steepness as far as the eye could see, a frightful accumulation, as it were, of things, laws, prejudices, men and deeds, whose contours he could not distinguish, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing other than that monumental pyramid we call ‘civilization’. In this swarming shapeless mass he could pick out here and there, now close to him, now far away on inaccessible levels, some grouping, some brightly illuminated detail: here, the prison warder and his rod; there, the gendarme and his sabre; beyond, the mitred archbishop; right at the top, like a sort of sun, the crowned and dazzling emperor. It seemed to him that these distant splendours, far from dispelling his darkness, made it blacker and more dismal. Laws, prejudices, deeds, men, things – all this came and went above him, observing the complicated and mysterious movement God imparts to civilization, trampling and crushing him with an indefinable calm in its cruelty and an inexorability in its indifference. Souls foundering in the worst possible plight, poor wretches lost in the lowest depths of this limbo where no one looks any more, the law’s outcasts feel individually burdened with the whole weight of this human society, so forbidding to anyone outside it, so appalling to anyone at the bottom of it.","Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him. In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled, each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance, he perceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightful accumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond the range of his vision,—laws, prejudices, men, and deeds,—whose outlines escaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished, here and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, now afar off and on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail, vividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there the gendarme and his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top, like a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to him that these distant splendors, far from dissipating his night, rendered it more funereal and more black. All this—laws, prejudices, deeds, men, things—went and came above him, over his head, in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which God imparts to civilization, walking over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference. Souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the reproved of the law, feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable for him who is without, so frightful for him who is beneath, resting upon their heads.","Through the diseased perceptions of an incomplete nature and a smothered intelligence, he vaguely felt that a monstrous weight was over him. In that pallid and sullen shadow in which he crawled, whenever he turned his head and endeavoured to raise his eyes, he saw, with mingled rage and terror, forming, massing, and mounting up out of view above him with horrid escarpments, a kind of frightful accumulation of things, of laws, of prejudices, of men, and of acts, the outlines of which escaped him, the weight of which appalled him, and which was no other than that prodigious pyramid that we call civilisation. Here and there in that shapeless and crawling mass, sometimes near at hand, sometimes afar off, and upon inaccessible heights, he distinguished some group, some detail vividly clear, here the jailer with his staff, here the gendarme with his sword, yonder the mitred archbishop; and on high, in a sort of blaze of glory, the emperor crowned and resplendent. It seemed to him that these distant splendours, far from dissipating his night, made it blacker and more deathly. All this, laws, prejudices, acts, men, things, went and came above him, according to the complicated and mysterious movement that God impresses upon civilisation, marching over him and crushing him with an indescribably tranquil cruelty and inexorable indifference. Souls sunk to the bottom of possible misfortune, and unfortunate men lost in the lowest depths, where they are no longer seen, the rejected of the law, feel upon their heads the whole weight of that human society, so formidable to him who is without it, so terrible to him who is beneath it."
"― Disons encore quelques mots çà et là, je veux bien. En dehors de la révolution qui, prise dans son ensemble, est une immense affirmation humaine, 93, hélas ! est une réplique.

Le père Duchêne est féroce, mais quelle épithète m’accorderez-vous pour le père Letellier ? Jourdan-Coupe-Tête est un monstre, mais moindre que M. le marquis de Louvois. Monsieur, monsieur, je plains Marie-Antoinette archiduchesse et reine, mais je plains aussi cette pauvre femme huguenote qui, en 1685, sous Louis le Grand, monsieur, allaitant son enfant, fut liée, nue jusqu’à la ceinture, à un poteau, l’enfant tenu à distance ; le sein se gonflait de lait et le cœur d’angoisse ; le petit, affamé et pâle, voyait ce sein, agonisait et criait ; et le bourreau disait à la femme, mère et nourrice : Abjure ! lui donnant à choisir entre la mort de son enfant et la mort de sa conscience. Que dites-vous de ce supplice de Tantale accommodé à une mère ? Monsieur, retenez bien ceci, la révolution française a eu ses raisons. Sa colère sera absoute par l’avenir. Son résultat, c’est le monde meilleur. De ses coups les plus terribles, il sort une caresse pour le genre humain. J’abrège. Je m’arrête, j’ai trop beau jeu. D’ailleurs je me meurs.","―Let's say a few more words here and there, I don't mind. Apart from the revolution which, taken as a whole, is an immense human affirmation, 93, alas! is a replica. You find it inexorable, but the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name do you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tinville is a beggar; but what is your opinion of Lamoignon-Bâville? Maillard is awful, but Saulx-Tavannes, please? Father Duchêne is ferocious, but what epithet will you give me for Father Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tête is a monster, but less so than the Marquis de Louvois. Sir, sir, I pity Marie-Antoinette archduchess and queen, but I also pity that poor Huguenot woman who, in 1685, under Louis the Great, sir, nursing her child, was tied, naked to the waist, to a post. , the child held at a distance; the breast swelled with milk and the heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, saw that breast, agonized and cried; and the executioner said to the woman, mother and nurse: Abjure! giving her the choice between the death of her child and the death of her conscience. What do you say to this torture of Tantalus accommodated to a mother? Sir, remember this, the French Revolution had its reasons. His anger will be absolved by the future. Its result is the better world. From his most terrible blows, he leaves a caress for the human race. I shorten. I stop, I have too good a game. Besides, I am dying.","He went on: ‘Let’s say a few more words about this and that, by all means. Leaving aside the Revolution, which taken as a whole is a tremendous assertion of humanity, ’93 is, alas! a response. You consider it pitiless – but what of the entire monarchy, monsieur? Carrier is a villain, but what do you call Montrevel? Fouquier-Tinville is a scoundrel, but what’s your opinion of Lamoignon-Bâville? Maillard is dreadful, but Saulx-Tavannes, if you please? Père Duchêne is vicious, but how would you describe Père Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tête is a monster, but a lesser one than the Marquis de Louvois. Monsieur, monsieur, I feel sorry for archduchess and queen Marie-Antoinette, but I also feel sorry for that poor Huguenot woman who, in 1685, under Louis the Great, monsieur, while nursing her child was tied to a stake, naked to the waist, and the child taken from her. Her breast was swollen with milk and her heart with anguish. Pale and famished, the child close to dying saw that breast and cried. And giving the woman the choice between the death of her child and the death of her conscience the executioner said to that nursing mother, “Recant!” What do you say to that Tantalus torture being applied to a mother? Just remember this, monsieur, the French Revolution had its reasons. Its anger will be forgiven by the future. It has resulted in a better world. Out of its most terrible deeds comes a cherishing of humankind. I won’t go on. I’ll stop there, I have the winning hand. Besides, I’m dying.’","“Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing. Apart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human affirmation, ’93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir; but what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name do you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is your opinion as to Lamoignon-Bâville? Maillard is terrible; but Saulx-Tavannes, if you please? Duchêne senior is ferocious; but what epithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tetê is a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir, sir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am also sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist, to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld that breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the woman, a mother and a nurse, ‘Abjure!’ giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience. What say you to that torture of Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in mind sir: the French Revolution had its reasons for existence; its wrath will be absolved by the future; its result is the world made better.

Le père Duchêne is ferocious, but what epithet will you furnish me for le père Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tête is a monster, but less than the Marquis of Louvois. Monsieur, monsieur, I lament Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen, but I lament also that poor Huguenot woman who, in 1685, under Louis le Grand, monsieur, while nursing her child, was stripped to the waist and tied to a post, while her child was held before her; her breast swelled with milk, and her heart with anguish; the little one, weak and famished, seeing the breast, cried with agony; and the executioner said to the woman, to the nursing mother, ‘Recant!’ giving her the choice between the death of her child and the death of her conscience.

"Un soir que Jean Valjean passait par là, il n’avait pas Cosette avec lui, il aperçut le mendiant à sa place ordinaire sous le réverbère qu’on venait d’allumer. Cet homme, selon son habitude, semblait prier et était tout courbé. Jean Valjean alla à lui et lui mit dans la main son aumône accoutumée. Le mendiant leva brusquement les yeux, regarda fixement Jean Valjean, puis baissa rapidement la tête. Ce mouvement fut comme un éclair, Jean Valjean eut un tressaillement. Il lui sembla qu’il venait d’entrevoir, à la lueur du réverbère, non le visage placide et béat du vieux bedeau, mais une figure effrayante et connue. Il eut l’impression qu’on aurait en se trouvant tout à coup dans l’ombre face à face avec un tigre. Il recula terrifié et pétrifié, n’osant ni respirer, ni parler, ni rester, ni fuir, considérant le mendiant qui avait baissé sa tête couverte d’une loque et paraissait ne plus savoir qu’il était là. Dans ce moment étrange, un instinct, peut-être l’instinct mystérieux de la conservation, fit que Jean Valjean ne prononça pas une parole. Le mendiant avait la même taille, les mêmes guenilles, la même apparence que tous les jours. ― Bah !... dit Jean Valjean, je suis fou ! je rêve ! impossible ! — Et il rentra profondément troublé.","One evening when Jean Valjean was passing by, he did not have Cosette with him, he saw the beggar in his usual place under the street lamp which had just been lighted. This man, as usual, seemed to be praying and was bent over. Jean Valjean went up to him and placed his usual alms in his hand. The beggar raised his eyes abruptly, stared fixedly at Jean Valjean, then quickly lowered his head. This movement was like lightning, Jean Valjean started. It seemed to him that he had just caught a glimpse, by the light of the streetlamp, not of the placid and blissful face of the old beadle, but of a frightful and familiar face. He had the feeling that one would suddenly find oneself in the shadows face to face with a tiger. He recoiled terrified and petrified, daring neither to breathe, nor to speak, nor to stay, nor to flee, considering the beggar who had lowered his head covered with a rag and seemed not to know any longer that he was there. At this strange moment, an instinct, perhaps the mysterious instinct of self-preservation, kept Jean Valjean from speaking a word. The beggar had the same size, the same rags, the same appearance as every day. ""Bah!..."" said Jean Valjean, ""I'm mad!"" I dream ! impossible ! ""And he returned deeply troubled.""","One evening as Jean Valjean was passing by, without Cosette, he saw the beggar in his usual place, under the street lamp that had just been lit. The man appeared, as ever, to be praying and was all bent over. Jean Valjean went up to him and put in his hand his customary donation. The beggar suddenly looked up, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then quickly bowed his head. This movement was like a flash of lightning. Jean Valjean gave a shudder. He thought he had just caught a glimpse by the light of the street lamp not of the old verger’s placidly beatific face but of a face terrifying and familiar. It made the same impression on him as suddenly coming face to face in the dark with a tiger. He shrank back, scared stiff, not daring to breathe, speak, stay or flee, staring at the beggar who had lowered his rag-covered head and seemed unaware he was still there. At that strange moment an instinct, possibly the mysterious instinct of self-preservation, kept Jean Valjean from uttering a word. The beggar was of the same stature, dressed in the same rags, and looked the same as he looked every day. ‘Bah!’ said Jean Valjean, ‘I’m mad! I’m dreaming! Impossible!’ And he went home feeling deeply disturbed.","One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosette with him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern which had just been lighted. The man seemed engaged in prayer, according to his custom, and was much bent over. Jean Valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand. The mendicant raised his eyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then dropped his head quickly. This movement was like a flash of lightning. Jean Valjean was seized with a shudder. It seemed to him that he had just caught sight, by the light of the street lantern, not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startling face. He experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one’s self, all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. He recoiled, terrified, petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak, to remain, nor to flee, staring at the beggar who had dropped his head, which was enveloped in a rag, and no longer appeared to know that he was there.

The man, according to custom, seemed to be praying and was bent over. Jean Valjean walked up to him, and put a piece of money in his hand, as usual. The beggar suddenly raised his eyes, gazed intently at Jean Valjean, and then quickly dropped his head. This movement was like a flash; Jean Valjean shuddered; it seemed to him that he had just seen, by the light of the street-lamp, not the calm, sanctimonious face of the aged beadle, but a terrible and well-known countenance. He experienced the sensation one would feel on finding himself suddenly face to face, in the gloom, with a tiger. He recoiled, horror-stricken and petrified, daring neither to breathe nor to speak, to stay nor to fly, but gazing upon the beggar who had once more bent down his head, with its tattered covering, and seemed to be no longer conscious of his presence. At this singular moment, an instinct, perhaps the mysterious instinct of self-preservation, prevented Jean Valjean from uttering a word. The beggar had the same form, the same rags, the same general appearance as on every other day. “Pshaw!” said Jean Valjean to himself, “I am mad! I am dreaming! It cannot be!” And he went home, anxious and ill at ease."

A window, which was also a door, opening upon the garden; facing this, the bed, an iron hospital-bed, with green serge curtains; in the shadow of the bed, behind a screen, the toilet utensils, still betraying the elegant habits of the man of the world; two doors, one near the chimney, leading into the oratory, the other near the book-case, opening into the dining-room. The book-case, a large closet with glass doors, filled with books; the fireplace, cased with wood painted to imitate marble, usually without fire; in the fireplace, a pair of andirons ornamented with two vases of flowers, once plated with silver, which was a kind of episcopal luxury; above the fireplace, a copper crucifix, from which the silver was worn off, fixed upon a piece of thread-bare black velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilt was almost gone; near the window, a large table with an inkstand, covered with confused papers and heavy volumes. In front of the table was the straw arm-chair, and before the bed, a prie-dieu from the oratory."

"Vers la fin de cette quatrième année, le tour d’évasion de Jean Valjean arriva. Ses camarades l’aidèrent comme cela se fait dans ce triste lieu. Il s’évada. Il erra deux jours en liberté dans les champs ; si c’est être libre que d’être traqué ; de tourner la tête à chaque instant ; de tressaillir au moindre bruit ; d’avoir peur de tout, du toit qui fume, de l’homme qui passe, du chien qui aboie, du cheval qui galope, de l’heure qui sonne, du jour parce qu’on voit, de la nuit parce qu’on ne voit pas, de la route, du sentier, du buisson, du sommeil. Le soir du second jour, il fut repris. Il n’avait ni mangé ni dormi depuis trente-six heures. Le tribunal maritime le condamna pour ce délit à une prolongation de trois ans, ce qui lui fit huit ans. La sixième année, ce fut encore son tour de s’évader ; il en usa, mais il ne put consommer sa fuite. Il avait manqué à l’appel. On tira le coup de canon, et à la nuit les gens de ronde le trouvèrent caché sous la quille d’un vaisseau en construction ; il résista aux garde-chiourme qui le saisirent. Évasion et rébellion. Ce fait prévu par le code spécial fut puni d’une aggravation de cinq ans, dont deux ans de double chaîne. Treize ans. La dixième année, son tour revint, il en profita encore. Il ne réussit pas mieux. Trois ans pour cette nouvelle tentative. Seize ans. Enfin, ce fut, je crois, pendant la treizième année qu’il essaya une dernière fois et ne réussit qu’à se faire reprendre après quatre heures d’absence. Trois ans pour ces quatre heures. Dix-neuf ans. En octobre 1815 il fut libéré, il était entré là en 1796 pour avoir cassé un carreau et pris un pain.","Towards the end of this fourth year, Jean Valjean's turn to escape came. His comrades helped him as is done in this sad place. He escaped. He wandered freely in the fields for two days; if being hunted is being free; to turn your head every moment; to start at the slightest noise; to be afraid of everything, of the smoking roof, of the passing man, of the barking dog, of the galloping horse, of the hour which strikes, of the day because we can see, of the night because we do not see, of the road, of the path, of the bush, of sleep. On the evening of the second day, he was recaptured. He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours. The maritime court sentenced him for this offense to a three-year extension, which made him eight years. The sixth year, it was again his turn to escape; he used it, but he could not consummate his flight. He had missed the call. The cannon was fired, and at nightfall the men on watch found it hidden under the keel of a vessel under construction; he resisted the guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This fact provided for by the special code was punished with an aggravation of five years, including two years of double chain. Thirteen years. In the tenth year, his turn came again, he took advantage of it again. He did no better. Three years for this new attempt. Sixteen years. Finally, it was, I believe, during the thirteenth year that he tried one last time and only managed to get caught after four hours of absence. Three years for these four hours. Nineteen years old. In October 1815 he was freed, he had entered there in 1796 for having broken a pane and taken a loaf.","Towards the end of that fourth year it was Jean Valjean’s turn to escape. His comrades helped him, as is the way in that woeful place. He escaped. For two days he roamed the countryside in freedom, if it can be called freedom to be hunted, to be constantly looking over your shoulder, starting at the slightest sound, afraid of everything – a smoking chimney, a man going by, a dog barking, a galloping horse, the striking of the hour, daylight because the eye can see, darkness because it cannot, the highway, the path, a bush, sleep. On the evening of the second day he was recaptured. He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours. The naval court condemned him for this offence to an additional three years, which made eight. In the sixth year it was again his turn to escape. He took his turn but could not make good his escape. He had failed to turn up at roll-call. The cannon was fired, and at night the patrol found him hiding under the keel of a vessel under construction. He resisted the guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This infraction under the terms of the special code incurred an additional five years, with two years of the double chain. Thirteen years. In the tenth year his turn came round again, and again he tried. He was no more successful than before. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years. Finally, it was, I think, during his thirteenth year that he made his last attempt and succeeded only in getting caught after four hours’ absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. In October 1815 he was released. He had gone in there in 1796 for breaking a pane of glass and stealing a loaf of bread.","Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean’s turn to escape arrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place. He escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,—of a smoking roof, of a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking clock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening of the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime, to a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years. In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself of it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at roll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; he resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This case, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition of five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the tenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he succeeded no better. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years. Finally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, he made a last attempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. In October, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.","Near the end of this fourth year, his chance of liberty came to Jean Valjean. His comrades helped him as they always do in that dreary place, and he escaped. He wandered two days in freedom through the fields; if it is freedom to be hunted, to turn your head each moment, to tremble at the least noise, to be afraid of everything, of the smoke of a chimney, the passing of a man, the baying of a dog, the gallop of a horse, the striking of a clock, of the day because you see, and of the night because you do not; of the road, of the path, the bush, of sleep. During the evening of the second day he was retaken; he had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal extended his sentence three years for this attempt, which made eight. In the sixth year his turn of escape came again; he tried it, but failed again. He did not answer at roll-call, and the alarm cannon was fired. At night the people of the vicinity discovered him hidden beneath the keel of a vessel on the stocks; he resisted the galley guard which seized him. Escape and resistance. This the provisions of the special code punished by an addition of five years, two with the double chain, thirteen years. The tenth year his turn came round again; he made another attempt with no better success. Three years for this new attempt. Sixteen years. And finally, I think it was in the thirteenth year, he made yet another, and was retaken after an absence of only four hours. Three years for these four hours. Nineteen years. In October, 1815, he was set at large: he had entered in 1796 for having broken a pane of glass, and taken a loaf of bread."

"Cependant, à peine avait-il quitté la salle d’audience de la cour d’assises, que l’avocat général, revenu du premier saisissement, avait pris la parole pour déplorer l’acte de folie de l’honorable maire de Montreuil-sur-Mer, déclarer que ses convictions n’étaient en rien modifiées par cet incident bizarre qui s’éclaircirait plus tard, et requérir, en attendant, la condamnation de ce Champmathieu, évidemment le vrai Jean Valjean. La persistance de l’avocat général était visiblement en contradiction avec le sentiment de tous, du public, de la cour et du jury. Le défenseur avait eu peu de peine à réfuter cette harangue et à établir que, par suite des révélations de M. Madeleine, c’est-à-dire du vrai Jean Valjean, la face de l’affaire était bouleversée de fond en comble, et que le jury n’avait plus devant les yeux qu’un innocent. L’avocat avait tiré de là quelques épiphonèmes, malheureusement peu neufs, sur les erreurs judiciaires, etc., etc., le président dans son résumé s’était joint au défenseur, et le jury en quelques minutes avait mis hors de cause Champmathieu.","However, hardly had he left the courtroom of the Assize Court than the Advocate General, having returned from the first arrest, took the floor to deplore the act of madness of the Honorable Mayor of Montreuil- sur-Mer, to declare that his convictions were in no way modified by this bizarre incident which would become clear later, and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of this Champmathieu, evidently the real Jean Valjean. The Advocate General's persistence was visibly at odds with the sentiment of all, the public, the court and the jury. The defender had had little difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that, following the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say of the real Jean Valjean, the face of the affair was completely upset, and that the jury had before their eyes only an innocent. The lawyer had taken from there some epiphonemes, unfortunately not very new, on miscarriages of justice, etc., etc., the president in his summary had joined the defender, and the jury in a few minutes had exonerated Champmathieu.","However, he had hardly left the court room when the public prosecutor, recovering from his initial shock, had taken the floor to deplore the honourable mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer’s act of insanity, to declare that his own convictions were in no way altered by this bizarre incident that would later be elucidated, and to demand in the meantime the conviction of this Champmathieu, clearly the real Jean Valjean. The public prosecutor’s persistence was obviously at odds with everyone else’s feeling, that of the public, the court and the jury. The defence counsel had little difficulty in refuting this argument and establishing that the revelations made by Monsieur Madeleine, that is to say, by the real Jean Valjean, put a completely different complexion on the case, and all that the jury now had standing before them was an innocent man. The lawyer had drawn from this a few sententious and unfortunately not unfamiliar conclusions regarding judicial errors, and suchlike. The presiding judge in his summing up had aligned himself with the defence counsel, and within a few minutes the jury had cleared Champmathieu of any wrong-doing.","However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of Assizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock, had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M. sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter, and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu, who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney’s persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one, of the public, of the court, and of the jury. The counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that, in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of the real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered, and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man. Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc. ; the President, in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence, and in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.","Meanwhile he had scarcely left the hall of the Court of Assizes when the prosecuting attorney, recovering from his first shock, addressed the court, deploring the insanity of the honourable Mayor of M—— sur M——, declaring that his convictions were in no wise modified by this singular incident, which would be explained hereafter, and demanding the conviction of this Champmathieu, who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The persistence of the prosecuting attorney was visibly in contradiction to the sentiment of all—the public, the court, and the jury. The counsel for the defence had little difficulty in answering this harangue, and establishing that, in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine— that is, of the real Jean Valjean—the aspect of the case was changed, entirely changed, from top to bottom, and that the jury now had before them an innocent man. The counsel drew from this a few passionate appeals, unfortunately not very new, in regard to judicial errors, etc. , etc. ; the judge, in his summing up, sided with the defence; and the jury, after a few moments’ consulation, acquitted Champmathieu."

"Dans les premiers jours du mois d’octobre 1815, une heure environ avant le coucher du soleil, un homme qui voyageait à pied entrait dans la petite ville de Digne. Les rares habitants qui se trouvaient en ce moment à leurs fenêtres ou sur le seuil de leurs maisons regardaient ce voyageur avec une sorte d’inquiétude. Il était difficile de rencontrer un passant d’un aspect plus misérable. C’était un homme de moyenne taille, trapu et robuste, dans la force de l’âge. Il pouvait avoir quarante-six ou quarante-huit ans. Une casquette à visière de cuir rabattue cachait en partie son visage brûlé par le soleil et le hâle et ruisselant de sueur. Sa chemise de grosse toile jaune, rattachée au col par une petite ancre d’argent, laissait voir sa poitrine velue ; il avait une cravate tordue en corde, un pantalon de coutil bleu usé et râpé, blanc à un genou, troué à l’autre, une vieille blouse grise en haillons, rapiécée à l’un des coudes d’un morceau de drap vert cousu avec de la ficelle, sur le dos un sac de soldat fort plein, bien bouclé et tout neuf, à la main un énorme bâton noueux, les pieds sans bas dans des souliers ferrés, la tête tondue et la barbe longue.","In the early days of October 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man traveling on foot entered the small town of Digne. The few inhabitants who were at this moment at their windows or on the thresholds of their houses looked at this traveler with a kind of uneasiness. It was hard to meet a passerby of a more miserable aspect. He was a man of average height, stocky and robust, in the prime of life. He could have been forty-six or forty-eight. A cap with a folded down leather peak partly hid his sunburned and tanned face, dripping with sweat. His coarse yellow linen shirt, fastened to the collar by a small silver anchor, showed his hairy chest; he had on a tie twisted into a cord, worn and threadbare blue drill trousers, white at one knee, with holes in the other, an old gray blouse in rags, patched at one of the elbows with a piece of green cloth sewn with string, on his back a very full soldier's bag, well buckled and brand new, in his hand an enormous knotty stick, his feet without stockings in iron-shod shoes, his head shorn and his beard long.","Early in the month of October 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man travelling on foot entered the little town of Digne.

It would be hard to come across a more wretched-looking passer-by. He was a man of average height, stocky and robust, in the prime of life. He might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with its leather peak pulled down partly concealed his weather-beaten face streaming with sweat. His shirt of coarse yellow cloth, fastened at the neck with a small silver anchor, revealed a glimpse of his hairy chest. He wore a rolled-up neckerchief, threadbare blue drill trousers with one knee faded to white and a hole in the other, a ragged old grey overall patched on one elbow with a bit of green cloth sewn on with twine, a soldier’s knapsack on his back that was stuffed full, firmly buckled and brand-new; a huge knotted stick in his hand, hobnailed shoes on his stockingless feet, a shaven head and a long beard.","Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D—— The few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness.

A cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by sun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view of his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back; an enormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a shaved head and a long beard.","AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET, on the evening of a day in the beginning of October, 1815, a man travelling afoot entered the little town of D——. The few persons who at this time were at their windows or their doors, regarded this traveller with a sort of distrust. It would have been hard to find a passer-by more wretched in appearance. He was a man of middle height, stout and hardy, in the strength of maturity; he might have been forty-six or seven. A slouched leather cap half hid his face, bronzed by the sun and wind, and dripping with sweat. His shaggy breast was seen through the coarse yellow shirt which at the neck was fastened by a small silver anchor; he wore a cravat twisted like a rope; coarse blue trousers, worn and shabby, white on one knee, and with holes in the other; an old ragged grey blouse, patched on one side with a piece of green cloth sewed with twine: upon his back was a well-filled knapsack, strongly buckled and quite new. In his hand he carried an enormous knotted stick: his stockingless feet were in hobnailed shoes; his hair was cropped and his beard long."

"« ― Un arrondissement du Pas-de-Calais vient d’être le théâtre d’un événement peu ordinaire. Un homme étranger au département et nommé M. Madeleine avait relevé depuis quelques années, grâce à des procédés nouveaux, une ancienne industrie locale, la fabrication des jais et des verroteries noires. Il y avait fait sa fortune, et, disons-le, celle de l’arrondissement. En reconnaissance de ses services, on l’avait nommé maire. La police a découvert que M. Madeleine n’était autre qu’un ancien forçat en rupture de ban, condamné en 1796 pour vol, et nommé Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean a été réintégré au bagne. Il paraît qu’avant son arrestation il avait réussi à retirer de chez M. Laffitte une somme de plus d’un demi-million qu’il y avait placée, et qu’il avait, du reste, très légitimement, dit-on, gagnée dans son commerce. On n’a pu savoir où Jean Valjean avait caché cette somme depuis sa rentrée au bagne de Toulon. »","“―A district of Pas-de-Calais has just been the scene of an unusual event. A man foreign to the department and named M. Madeleine had revived for some years, thanks to new processes, an old local industry, the manufacture of jets and black beads.

The police discovered that Mr. Madeleine was none other than a former convict on the run, convicted in 1796 of theft, and named Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean was reinstated in prison. It appears that before his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from M. Laffitte a sum of more than half a million which he had invested there, and which he had, moreover, very legitimately, it is said, earned in his trade. We could not find out where Jean Valjean had hidden this sum since his return to prison in Toulon. »","An arrondissement in the Pas de Calais has just been the scene of no ordinary event.

"Elle fit ainsi une douzaine de pas, mais le seau était plein, il était lourd, elle fut forcée de le reposer à terre.

"La file de boutiques en plein vent qui partait de l’église se développait, on s’en souvient, jusqu’à l’auberge Thénardier. Ces boutiques, à cause du passage prochain des bourgeois allant à la messe de minuit, étaient toutes illuminées de chandelles brûlant dans des entonnoirs de papier, ce qui, comme le disait le maître d’école de Montfermeil attablé en ce moment chez Thénardier, faisait « un effet magique ». En revanche, on ne voyait pas une étoile au ciel.","The line of shops in the open air which started from the church developed, as we remember, as far as the Auberge Thénardier. These shops, because of the imminent passage of the bourgeois going to midnight mass, were all lit up with candles burning in paper funnels, which, as the schoolmaster of Montfermeil said, seated at the table at Thénardier's, made “a magical effect”. On the other hand, we did not see a star in the sky.","The row of open-air stalls that started at the church extended, the reader will remember, as far as the Thénardier inn. Because the gentry would soon be passing by on their way to midnight mass these stalls were all lit up with candles burning in paper cones, which produced ‘a magical effect’, as Montfermeil’s schoolmaster, at that moment seated at one of the Thénardiers’ tables, observed. However, there was not a single star to be seen in the sky.","The line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the reader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thénardiers. These booths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass on their way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels, which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the Thénardiers’ observed, produced “a magical effect.” In compensation, not a star was visible in the sky.","THE ROW of booths extended along the street from the church, the reader will remember, as far as the Thénardier tavern.

"Pour comprendre ce qui va suivre, il faut se figurer d’une manière exacte la ruelle Droit-Mur et en particulier l’angle qu’on laissait à gauche quand on sortait de la rue Polonceau pour entrer dans cette ruelle. La ruelle Droit-Mur était à peu près entièrement bordée à droite jusqu’à la petite rue Picpus par des maisons de pauvre apparence ; à gauche par un seul bâtiment d’une ligne sévère composé de plusieurs corps de logis qui allaient se haussant graduellement d’un étage ou deux à mesure qu’ils approchaient de la petite rue Picpus, de sorte que ce bâtiment, très élevé du côté de la petite rue Picpus, était assez bas du côté de la rue Polonceau. Là, à l’angle dont nous avons parlé, il s’abaissait au point de n’avoir plus qu’une muraille. Cette muraille n’allait pas aboutir carrément à la rue ; elle dessinait un pan coupé fort en retraite, dérobé par ses deux angles à deux observateurs qui eussent été l’un rue Polonceau, l’autre rue Droit-Mur.","To understand what will follow, you have to picture the Ruelle Droit-Mur in an exact way and in particular the angle that we leave on the left when we leave the Rue Polonceau to enter this lane. The Ruelle Droit-Mur was almost entirely bordered on the right as far as the little Rue Picpus by houses of poor appearance; on the left by a single building of a severe line composed of several main buildings which gradually rose a floor or two as they approached the little rue Picpus, so that this building, very high on the side from the little rue Picpus, was quite low on the side of the rue Polonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it sank down till it had only one wall. This wall was not going to end squarely in the street; it outlined a sharply recessed cutaway, concealed by its two angles from two observers who would have been one in the rue Polonceau, the other in the rue Droit-Mur.","In order to understand what follows, the reader needs to have an accurate picture of that Droit-Mur lane, and in particular of the corner you passed on your left as you emerged from Rue Polonceau to enter Rue Droit-Mur. The lane was bordered almost all the way along the right-hand side, down to Petite-Rue-Picpus, by shabby-looking houses, and on the left-hand side by a single grimly structured building, composed of several blocks that became gradually higher by one or two storeys as they approached Petite-Rue-Picpus. So that this building, which was very high at the Petite-Rue-Picpus end, was quite low at the Rue Polonceau end. There, on the corner we have mentioned, it came down so low it had only an outside wall. This wall did not come right out to the corner of the street. It was set well back, with the corner cut off at an angle, making that vertical face invisible to any two observers that there might have been, one in Rue Polonceau and the other in Rue Droit-Mur.","In order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exact idea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this lane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as far as the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the Rue Petit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on the Rue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the Rue Polonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall. This wall did not abut directly on the street; it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been, one in the Rue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.","IN ORDER to understand what follows, it is necessary to form an exact idea of the little Rue Droit Mur, and particularly the corner which it makes at the left as you leave the Rue Polonceau to enter this alley. The little Rue Droit Mur was almost entirely lined on the right, as far as the Petite Rue Picpus, by houses of poor appearance; on the left by a single building of severe outline, composed of several structures which rose gradually a story or two, one above another, as they approached the Petite Rue Picpus, so that the building, very high on the side of the Petite Rue Picpus, was quite low on the side of the Rue Polonceau. There, at the corner of which we have spoken, it became so low as to be nothing more than a wall. This wall did not abut squarely on the corner, which was cut off diagonally, leaving a considerable space that was shielded by the two angles thus formed from observers at a distance in either the Rue Polonceau, or the Rue Droit Mur."

"A de certaines heures, l’enfance étincelait dans ce cloître. La récréation sonnait. Une porte tournait sur ses gonds. Les oiseaux disaient : Bon ! voilà les enfants ! Une irruption de jeunesse inondait ce jardin coupé d’une croix comme un linceul. Des visages radieux, des fronts blancs, des yeux ingénus pleins de gaie lumière, toutes sortes d’aurores, s’éparpillaient dans ces ténèbres. Après les psalmodies, les cloches, les sonneries, les glas, les offices, tout à coup éclatait ce bruit des petites filles, plus doux qu’un bruit d’abeilles. La ruche de la joie s’ouvrait, et chacune apportait son miel. On jouait, on s’appelait, on se groupait, on courait ; de jolies petites dents blanches jasaient dans des coins ; les voiles, de loin, surveillaient les rires, les ombres guettaient les rayons, mais qu’importe ! on rayonnait et on riait. Ces quatre murs lugubres avaient leur minute d’éblouissement. Ils assistaient, vaguement blanchis du reflet de tant de joie, à ce doux tourbillonnement d’essaims. C’était comme une pluie de roses traversant ce deuil. Les jeunes filles folâtraient sous l’œil des religieuses ; le regard de l’impeccabilité ne gêne pas l’innocence. Grâce à ces enfants, parmi tant d’heures austères, il y avait l’heure naïve. Les petites sautaient, les grandes dansaient. Dans ce cloître, le jeu était mêlé de ciel. Rien n’était ravissant et auguste comme toutes ces fraîches âmes épanouies. Homère fût venu rire là avec Perrault, et il y avait, dans ce jardin noir, de la jeunesse, de la santé, du bruit, des cris, de l’étourdissement, du plaisir, du bonheur, à dérider toutes les aïeules, celles de l’épopée comme celles du conte, celles du trône comme celles du chaume, depuis Hécube jusqu’à la Mère-Grand.","At certain hours, childhood sparkled in this cloister. Recess was ringing. A door was turning on its hinges. The birds said: Good! here are the children! An irruption of youth flooded this garden cut by a cross like a shroud. Radiant faces, white foreheads, ingenuous eyes full of gay light, all sorts of dawns, were scattered in this darkness. After the psalmodies, the bells, the bells, the knells, the services, suddenly burst out the sound of little girls, sweeter than the sound of bees. The hive of joy opened, and each one brought her honey. We played, we called each other, we grouped together, we ran; pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners; the veils, from afar, watched the laughter, the shadows watched the rays, but what does it matter! we were beaming and laughing. These four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzle. They watched, vaguely whitened by the reflection of so much joy, at this gentle swirling of swarms. It was like a rain of roses crossing this mourning. The young girls frolicked under the watchful eye of the nuns; the gaze of impeccability does not interfere with innocence. Thanks to these children, among so many austere hours, there was the naive hour. The little ones jumped, the older ones danced. In this cloister, the game was mingled with the sky. Nothing was lovely and august like all those fresh blooming souls. Homer would have come to laugh there with Perrault, and there was, in this black garden, youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness, to cheer up all the ancestors, those of the epic like those of the tale, those of the throne like those of the stubble, from Hecuba to the Grandmother.","At certain times childhood lit up this cloister. The bell for recreation rang. A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, ‘Good! Here come the children!’ An irruption of youth burst into that garden with a cross-shape marked out on it like a shroud. Radiant faces, clear brows, innocent eyes full of cheerful brightness, all sorts of budding charms darted among these shadows. Breaking out abruptly, after the chanting, the ringing of bells, the chiming, the tolling, the offices, was this sound of little girls, sweeter than the sound of bees. The hive of joy opened, and each one brought her honey to it. They played, they called out to each other, they clustered in groups, they ran about. Pretty little white teeth chattered in corners. Veils superintended the laughter from afar, shadows oversaw the rays of sunshine, but they did not mind. They shone brightly and they laughed. Those four gloomy walls had their moment of bedazzlement. Faintly illuminated by the reflection of so much joy, they watched this delightful swarming flurry. It was like a shower of rose petals amid all this mournfulness. The young girls frolicked under the gaze of the nuns. The watchful eye of sinlessness does not bother innocence. Thanks to these children, among so many austere hours there was an hour of artless simplicity. The little ones skipped, the older ones danced. In this cloister, play was combined with the heavenly. Nothing was so enchanting and awesome as all these pure and radiant souls. Homer would have come here to laugh with Perrault, and there was in this dark garden such youth, well-being, noise, cries, giddiness, pleasure and happiness as to cheer all their female forebears, whether of epic or fairy-tale, the high-born and the humble, from Hecuba to Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother.","At certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister. The recreation hour struck. A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, “Good; here come the children!” An irruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with a cross like a shroud. Radiant faces, white foreheads, innocent eyes, full of merry light, all sorts of auroras, were scattered about amid these shadows. After the psalmodies, the bells, the peals, and knells and offices, the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees. The hive of joy was opened, and each one brought her honey. They played, they called to each other, they formed into groups, they ran about; pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners; the veils superintended the laughs from a distance, shades kept watch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it? Still they beamed and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling brilliancy. They looked on, vaguely blanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming of the hives. It was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning. The young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of impeccability does not embarrass innocence. Thanks to these children, there was, among so many austere hours, one hour of ingenuousness. The little ones skipped about; the elder ones danced. In this cloister play was mingled with heaven. Nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh, expanding young souls. Homer would have come thither to laugh with Perrault; and there was in that black garden, youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses, those of the epic as well as those of the fairy-tale, those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage from Hecuba to la Mère-Grand.","At certain hours, childhood sparkled in this cloister. The hour of recreation struck. A door turned upon its hinges. The birds said good! here are the children! An irruption of youth inundated this garden, which was cut by walks in the form of a cross, like a shroud. Radiant faces, white foreheads, frank eyes full of cheerful light, auroras of all sorts scattered through this darkness. After the chants, the bell-ringing, the knells, and the offices, all at once this hum of little girls burst forth sweeter than the hum of bees. The hive of joy opened, and each one brought her honey. They played, they called to one another, they formed groups, they ran; pretty little white teeth chatted in the corners; veils from a distance watched over the laughter, shadows spying the sunshine; but what matter! They sparkled and they laughed. These four dismal walls had their moments of bewilderment. They too shared, dimly lighted up by the reflection of so much joy, in this sweet and swarming whirl. It was like a shower of roses upon this mourning. The young girls frolicked under the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of sinlessness does not disturb innocence. Thanks to these children, among so many hours of austerity, there was one hour of artlessness. The little girls skipped, the larger ones danced. In this cloister, play was mingled with heaven. Nothing was so transporting and superb, as all these fresh, blooming souls. Homer might have laughed there with Perrault and there were, in this dark garden, enough of youth, health, murmurs, cries, uproar, pleasure and happiness, to smooth the wrinkles from off all granddames, those of the epic as well as the tale, those of the throne as well as the hut, from Hecuba to Mother Goose."

"Dans ces tournées, il était indulgent et doux, et prêchait moins qu’il ne causait. Il n’allait jamais chercher bien loin ses raisonnements et ses modèles. Aux habitants d’un pays il citait l’exemple du pays voisin. Dans les cantons où l’on était dur pour les nécessiteux, il disait : ― Voyez les gens de Briançon. Ils ont donné aux indigents, aux veuves et aux orphelins le droit de faire faucher leurs prairies trois jours avant tous les autres.

They rebuild their houses for them free of charge when they are in ruins. So it is a blessed country of God. For a whole century of hundred years, there has not been a murderer.","On his visits he was kind and indulgent, and did not so much preach as chat. He placed no virtue beyond reach. He never went looking very far for his arguments and his exemplars. To the inhabitants of one village he would cite the example of the neighbouring one.

They’ve granted to the poor, to widows and orphans the right to mow their meadows three days before everyone else. When their houses are falling down they rebuild them at no cost. Consequently, it’s a place blessed by God. There’s not been a single person guilty of murder for a whole century.’","In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked rather than preached.

They have given to the poor, and to widows and orphans, the right to mow their meadows three days before any one else. When their houses are in ruins they rebuild them without cost. And so it is a country blessed of God. For a whole century they have not had a single murderer.”"
"L’attaque sur Hougomont avait quelque simulation ; attirer là Wellington, le faire pencher à gauche, tel était le plan.

"Le nom de Fantine lui était bien connu. Il se souvenait que Jean Valjean l’avait fait éclater de rire, lui Javert, en lui demandant un répit de trois jours pour aller chercher l’enfant de cette créature. Il se rappela que Jean Valjean avait été arrêté à Paris au moment où il montait dans la voiture de Montfermeil. Quelques indications avaient même fait songer à cette époque que c’était la seconde fois qu’il montait dans cette voiture, et qu’il avait déjà, la veille, fait une première excursion aux environs de ce village, car on ne l’avait point vu dans le village même.

Or cette enfant venait d’être volée par un inconnu. Quel pouvait être cet inconnu ?

Some indications had even made one think at that time that it was the second time that he got into this car, and that he had already, the day before, made a first excursion in the vicinity of this village, because we had not point seen in the village itself. What was he going to do in this country of Montfermeil? we could not have guessed it. Javert understood this now. Fantine's daughter was there. Jean Valjean was going to fetch him. But this child had just been stolen by a stranger. Who could this stranger be?

Why was he going to that place, Montfermeil? No one could work it out. Javert now understood. Fantine’s daughter was there. Jean Valjean was going to fetch her. Well, this child had just been stolen by a stranger! Who could that stranger be? Could it be Jean Valjean? But Jean Valjean was dead.

"Favourite, ayant été en Angleterre, avait pour admiratrices Zéphine et Dahlia. Elle avait eu de très bonne heure un chez-soi. Son père était un vieux professeur de mathématiques brutal et qui gasconnait ; point marié, courant le cachet malgré l’âge. Ce professeur, étant jeune, avait vu un jour la robe d’une femme de chambre s’accrocher à un garde-cendre ; il était tombé amoureux de cet accident. Il en était résulté Favourite. Elle rencontrait de temps en temps son père, qui la saluait. Un matin, une vieille femme à l’air béguin était entrée chez elle et lui avait dit : ― Vous ne me connaissez pas, mademoiselle ? ― Non. ― Je suis ta mère. ― Puis la vieille avait ouvert le buffet, bu et mangé, fait apporter un matelas qu’elle avait, et s’était installée. Cette mère, grognon et dévote, ne parlait jamais à Favourite, restait des heures sans souffler mot, déjeunait, dînait et soupait comme quatre, et descendait faire salon chez le portier, où elle disait du mal de sa fille.","Favourite, having been in England, had Zéphine and Dahlia for admirers. She had had a home very early. Her father was a brutal, gasconish old mathematics teacher; not married, running the stamp despite the age. This professor, being young, had one day seen the robe of a maid catch on an ash guard; he had fallen in love with that accident. This resulted in Favorite. From time to time she met her father, who greeted her. One morning an old woman with a crushing air came into her house and said to her: ""You don't know me, miss? - No. - I am your mother. “Then the old woman opened the sideboard, drank and ate, had a mattress she had brought in, and settled herself down. This mother, grumpy and devout, never spoke to Favourite, remained for hours without saying a word, lunched, dined, and supped like four, and went down to the porter's room, where she spoke ill of her daughter.","Dahlia and Zéphine were admirers of Favourite because she had been to England. She was living on her own very early in life. Her father was a churlish old mathematics teacher, full of himself, unmarried, running round town giving private lessons despite his age. As a young man this teacher had one day seen a chambermaid catch her dress on a fender. He fell in love as a consequence of that chance incident. Favourite was the result. She would run into her father from time to time, who would nod to her. One morning a nunnish-looking old woman came to see her at home and said, ‘You don’t know me, mademoiselle?’ ‘No.’ ‘I’m your mother.’ Then the old woman helped herself to food and drink, had a mattress she owned delivered there, and moved in. This peevish and sanctimonious mother never spoke to Favourite, let hours go by without uttering a word, ate enough to feed four, morning, noon and night, and would go down to chat in the porter’s lodge, where she spoke ill of her daughter.","Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zéphine.

She met her father from time to time, and he bowed to her.

"Une de ces réfugiées se retrouvait presque chez elle. C’était une religieuse de Sainte-Aure, la seule de son ordre qui eût survécu.

"Tout était retombé dans le silence. Plus rien dans la rue, plus rien dans le jardin. Ce qui menaçait, ce qui rassurait, tout s’était évanoui. Le vent froissait dans la crête du mur quelques herbes sèches qui faisaient un petit bruit doux et lugubre.","Everything had fallen back into silence. Nothing in the street, nothing in the garden.

Not another sound in the street, not another sound in the garden. The menacing, the comforting, all had died away. The breeze ruffled a few dry weeds on top of the wall, creating a quietly mournful sound.","All fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street; there was nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which had reassured him,—all had vanished. The breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholy sound.","All had again relapsed into silence. There was nothing more in the street, nothing more in the garden. That which threatened, that which reassured, all had vanished. The wind rattled the dry grass on the top of the wall, which made a low, soft, and mournful noise."
"L’exprès était lui-même un homme de police fort entendu qui, en deux mots, mit Javert au fait de ce qui était arrivé à Arras. L’ordre d’arrestation, signé de l’avocat général, était ainsi conçu : ― L’inspecteur Javert appréhendera au corps le sieur Madeleine, maire de Montreuil-sur-Mer, qui, dans l’audience de ce jour, a été reconnu pour être le forçat libéré Jean Valjean.","The express was himself a very knowing policeman who, in a few words, put Javert in the know of what had happened in Arras. The arrest order, signed by the Advocate General, was as follows: ―Inspector Javert will apprehend in the body the Sieur Madeleine, Mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer, who, in today's hearing, was recognized to be the freed convict Jean Valjean.","The messenger was also a very capable policeman, who succinctly informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The arrest warrant, signed by the public prosecutor, was worded as follows: ‘Inspector Javert will arrest Sieur Madeleine, mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer, who in this day’s court hearing was identified as the convicted felon freed on parole, Jean Valjean.’","The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in two words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras.

"Ce qui la rassurait un peu, c’est qu’on ne buvait pas beaucoup d’eau dans la maison Thénardier. Il ne manquait pas là de gens qui avaient soif ; mais c’était de cette soif qui s’adresse plus volontiers au broc qu’à la cruche. Qui eût demandé un verre d’eau parmi ces verres de vin eût semblé un sauvage à tous ces hommes. Il y eut pourtant un moment où l’enfant trembla ; la Thénardier souleva le couvercle d’une casserole qui bouillait sur le fourneau, puis saisit un verre, et s’approcha vivement de la fontaine. Elle tourna le robinet, l’enfant avait levé la tête et suivait tous ses mouvements. Un maigre filet d’eau coula du robinet et remplit le verre à moitié. ― Tiens, dit-elle, il n’y a plus d’eau ! puis elle eut un moment de silence. L’enfant ne respirait pas.","What reassured her a little was that they didn't drink much water in the Thénardier house. There was plenty of thirsty people there; but it was that thirst which more readily appeals to the jug than to the pitcher. Whoever had asked for a glass of water among these glasses of wine would have seemed a savage to all these men. There was, however, a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thénardier lifted the lid of a saucepan which was boiling on the stove, then seized a glass, and approached quickly the fountain. She turned on the tap, the child had raised her head and was following her every move. A trickle of water trickled from the faucet and filled the glass halfway. ""There,"" she said, ""there's no more water! then she had a moment of silence. The child was not breathing.","What slightly reassured her was that not much water was drunk in the Thénardier establishment. There was no lack of thirsty people, but theirs was the kind of thirst that reaches more readily for the jug of wine than for the jug of water. Anyone asking for a glass of water would have seemed uncivilized to all those men with their glasses of wine. But there came a moment when the child trembled. The Thénardier woman lifted the lid of a stewing-pot bubbling on the stove, then took a glass and suddenly approached the cistern. She turned the tap. The child had raised her head and was following her every movement. A thin trickle of water flowed from the tap and half filled the glass. ‘Look at that,’ said she, ‘there’s no more water!’ She remained silent for a moment. The child did not breathe.","She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thénardier establishment drank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking there; but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to the pitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of water among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men. But there came a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thénardier raised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern. She turned the faucet; the child had raised her head and was following all the woman’s movements. A thin stream of water trickled from the faucet, and half filled the glass. “Well,” said she, “there is no more water!” A momentary silence ensued. The child did not breathe.","One thing comforted her a little; they did not drink much water in the Thénardier tavern. There were plenty of people there who were thirsty; but it was that kind of thirst which reaches rather towards the jug than the pitcher. Had anybody asked for a glass of water among these glasses of wine, he would have seemed a savage to all those men. However, there was an instant when the child trembled; the Thénardiess raised the cover of a kettle which was boiling on the range, then took a glass and hastily approached the cistern. She turned the faucet; the child had raised her head and followed all her movements. A thin stream of water ran from the faucet, and filled the glass half full. “Here,” said she, “there is no more water!” Then she was silent for a moment. The child held her breath."

"A cette époque il n’y avait point de becs de gaz dans les rues de Paris.

"Le déclin physique évident de Napoléon se compliquait-il à cette époque d’une certaine diminution intérieure ? les vingt ans de guerre avaient-ils usé la lame comme le fourreau, l’âme comme le corps ? le vétéran se faisait-il fâcheusement sentir dans le capitaine ? en un mot, ce génie, comme beaucoup d’historiens considérables l’ont cru, s’éclipsait-il ? entrait-il en frénésie pour se déguiser à lui-même son affaiblissement ? commençait-il à osciller sous l’égarement d’un souffle d’aventure ? devenait-il, chose grave dans un général, inconscient du péril ? dans cette classe de grands hommes matériels qu’on peut appeler les géants de l’action, y a-t-il un âge pour la myopie du génie ? La vieillesse n’a pas de prise sur les génies de l’idéal ; pour les Dantes et les Michel-Anges, vieillir, c’est croître ; pour les Annibals et les Bonapartes, est-ce décroître ?

Was he going into a frenzy to disguise his weakening from himself? Was it beginning to sway under the bewilderment of a breath of adventure? Was he becoming, a serious thing in a general, unconscious of the danger? in this class of great material men who may be called the giants of action, is there an age for the myopia of genius? Old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal; for Dantes and Michelangelo, to grow old is to grow; for the Annibales and the Bonapartes, is it decreasing?

Did he lack the flair for disasters? he who once knew all the roads to triumph and who, from the top of his chariot of lightning, indicated them with a sovereign finger, had he now that sinister bewilderment of leading his tumultuous team of legions to the precipices?

In a word, was this genius, as many eminent historians have thought, now failing? Was he frenetically trying to hide from himself his debilitation? Was he beginning to falter, confounded by the winds of chance? Was he becoming oblivious to danger – a matter of serious consequence in a general?

Did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure? Had he become— a grave matter in a general—unconscious of peril? Is there an age, in this class of material great men, who may be called the giants of action, when genius grows short-sighted?

"Ici encore il faut se faire ces questions que nous nous sommes déjà faites ailleurs, recueillait-il confusément quelque ombre de tout ceci dans sa pensée ? Certes, le malheur, nous l’avons dit, fait l’éducation de l’intelligence ; cependant il est douteux que Jean Valjean fût en état de démêler tout ce que nous indiquons ici. Si ces idées lui arrivaient, il les entrevoyait plutôt qu’il ne les voyait, et elles ne réussissaient qu’à le jeter dans un trouble inexprimable et presque douloureux. Au sortir de cette chose difforme et noire qu’on appelle le bagne, l’évêque lui avait fait mal à l’âme comme une clarté trop vive lui eût fait mal aux yeux en sortant des ténèbres. La vie future, la vie possible qui s’offrait désormais à lui toute pure et toute rayonnante le remplissait de frémissements et d’anxiété. Il ne savait vraiment plus où il en était.

Admittedly, misfortune, as we have said, educates the intelligence; however it is doubtful that Jean Valjean was in a position to disentangle all that we indicate here. If these ideas occurred to him, he glimpsed them rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into inexpressible and almost painful confusion. Coming out of that deformed and dark thing called the bagne, the bishop had hurt his soul as too bright a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the darkness. The future life, the possible life which henceforth offered itself to him, all pure and all radiant, filled him with tremors and anxiety. He really didn't know where he was. Like an owl suddenly seeing the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and blinded by virtue.","Here again those questions need to be asked that we have already raised elsewhere: did he amid the confusion of his thoughts have any inkling of all this? Certainly, as we have said, understanding is schooled by adversity. However, it is doubtful that Jean Valjean was capable of unravelling all that we are suggesting. If these ideas occurred to him he glimpsed rather than saw them, and they succeeded only in casting him into a state of unbearable and almost painful perplexity. As too bright a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark, so the bishop hurt his soul when he came out of that perverse place of darkness called penal servitude. The future life, the potential life, now offered to him filled him with trepidation and anxiety. He did not really know where he was any more. Like an owl that might suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and, so to speak, blinded by virtue.","Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought, in a confused way?

If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses of, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion. On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremors and anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an owl, who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and blinded, as it were, by virtue.","Here we must again ask those questions, which we have already proposed elsewhere: was some confused shadow of all this formed in his mind?

If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught a glimpse, he did not see; and the only effect was to throw him into an inexpressible and distressing confusion. Being just out of that misshapen and gloomy thing which is called the galleys, the bishop had hurt his soul, as a too vivid light would have hurt his eyes on coming out of the dark.

"La chose, en revanche, réjouit fort madame Magloire. ― Bon, dit-elle à mademoiselle Baptistine, monseigneur a commencé par les autres, mais il a bien fallu qu’il finît par lui-même.

"L’Orion était un navire malade depuis longtemps. Dans ses navigations antérieures, des couches épaisses de coquillages s’étaient amoncelées sur sa carène au point de lui faire perdre la moitié de sa marche ; on l’avait mis à sec l’année précédente pour gratter ces coquillages, puis il avait repris la mer. Mais ce grattage avait altéré les boulonnages de la carène. A la hauteur des Baléares, le bordé s’était fatigué et ouvert, et, comme le vaigrage ne se faisait pas alors en tôle, le navire avait fait de l’eau. Un violent coup d’équinoxe était survenu, qui avait défoncé à bâbord la poulaine et un sabord et endommagé le porte-haubans de misaine. A la suite de ces avaries, l’Orion avait regagné Toulon.","The Orion had been a sick ship for a long time. In its previous navigations, thick layers of shells had piled up on its hull to the point of causing it to lose half its progress; we had put it ashore the previous year to scrape these shells, then it had gone back to sea. But this scraping had altered the bolting of the hull. At the height of the Balearic Islands, the plating had become tired and opened, and, as the planking was not then made of sheet metal, the ship had leaked. A violent blow from the equinox had occurred, which had smashed the port side and a porthole and damaged the foresail shroud. Following this damage, the Orion had returned to Toulon.","The Orion was a ship that had been in poor shape for a long time. On her previous sailings, thick layers of barnacles had collected on the hull, so much so that her speed was reduced by half. She had gone into dry dock the year before to have these barnacles scraped off, then she put out to sea again. But this scraping had weakened the bolting on the hull. When the ship reached the Balearic Isles the strained planking opened up and, as the hull was not lined with sheet metal in those days, the vessel had shipped water. A violent equinoctial gale had sprung up and staved in the ship’s head and broken through a porthole on the port side, and damaged the foresail chain-wales. After sustaining these injuries the Orion had returned to Toulon.","Every day, accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices, and the jetties of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers and loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staring at the Orion. The Orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; in the course of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed; it had gone into the dry dock the year before this, in order to have the barnacles scraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the Balearic Isles the sides had been strained and had opened; and, as the plating in those days was not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak. A violent equinoctial gale had come up, which had first staved in a grating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged the foretop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, the Orion had run back to Toulon.","The Orion was a ship that had long been in bad condition. During her previous voyages, thick layers of shellfish had gathered on her bottom to such an extent as to seriously impede her progress; she had been put on the dry-dock the year before, to be scraped, and then she had gone to sea again. But this scraping had injured her fastening. In the latitude of the Balearic Isles, her planking had loosened and opened, and as there was in those lays no copper sheathing, the ship had leaked. A fierce equinoctial came on, which had stove in the larboard bows and a porthole, and damaged the fore-chain-wales. In consequence of these injuries, the Orion had put back to Toulon."
"L’homme se courba, demeura un moment accroupi, et quand il se releva, il n’y avait plus d’anneau à cette main.","The man bent down, crouched for a moment, and when he got up, there was no ring on that hand.","The man bent down, remained crouching for a moment, and when he stood up again there was no longer a ring on that hand. He did not exactly stand up.","The man bent over, remained in a crouching attitude for a moment, and when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand.","The man stooped down, remained a moment, and when he rose again there was no ring upon that hand."

"― Amis, s’écria Tholomyès de l’accent d’un homme qui ressaisit l’empire, remettez-vous. Il ne faut pas que trop de stupeur accueille ce calembour tombé du ciel. Tout ce qui tombe de la sorte n’est pas nécessairement digne d’enthousiasme et de respect. Le calembour est la fiente de l’esprit qui vole. Le lazzi tombe n’importe où ; et l’esprit, après la ponte d’une bêtise, s’enfonce dans l’azur. Une tache blanchâtre qui s’aplatit sur le rocher n’empêche pas le condor de planer. Loin de moi l’insulte au calembour ! Je l’honore dans la proportion de ses mérites ; rien de plus. Tout ce qu’il y a de plus auguste, de plus sublime et de plus charmant dans l’humanité, et peut-être hors de l’humanité, a fait des jeux de mots. Jésus-Christ a fait un calembour sur saint Pierre, Moïse sur Isaac, Eschyle sur Polynice, Cléopâtre sur Octave. Et notez que ce calembour de Cléopâtre a précédé la bataille d’Actium, et que, sans lui, personne ne se souviendrait de la ville de Toryne, nom grec qui signifie cuiller à pot. Cela concédé, je reviens à mon exhortation. Mes frères, je le répète, pas de zèle, pas de tohu-bohu, pas d’excès, même en pointes, gayetés, liesses et jeux de mots. Écoutez-moi, j’ai la prudence d’Amphiaraüs et la calvitie de César. Il faut une limite, même aux rébus. Est modus in rebus. Il faut une limite, même aux dîners. Vous aimez les chaussons aux pommes, mesdames, n’en abusez pas. Il faut, même en chaussons, du bon sens et de l’art. La gloutonnerie châtie le glouton. Gula punit Gulax. L’indigestion est chargée par le bon Dieu de faire de la morale aux estomacs. Et, retenez ceci : chacune de nos passions, même l’amour, a un estomac qu’il ne faut pas trop remplir. En toute chose il faut écrire à temps le mot finis, il faut se contenir, quand cela devient urgent, tirer le verrou sur son appétit, mettre au violon sa fantaisie et se mener soi-même au poste. Le sage est celui qui sait à un moment donné opérer sa propre arrestation. Ayez quelque confiance en moi. Parce que j’ai fait un peu mon droit, à ce que disent mes examens, parce que je sais la différence qu’il y a entre la question mue et la question pendante, parce que j’ai soutenu une thèse en latin sur la manière dont on donnait la torture à Rome au temps où Munatius Demens était questeur du Parricide, parce que je vais être docteur, à ce qu’il paraît, il ne s’ensuit pas de toute nécessité que je sois un imbécile. Je vous recommande la modération dans vos désirs. Vrai comme je m’appelle Félix Tholomyès, je parle bien. Heureux celui qui, lorsque l’heure a sonné, prend un parti héroïque, et abdique comme Sylla, ou Origène !","""Friends,"" exclaimed Tholomyes, in the accent of a man who is recapturing the empire, ""compose yourselves. This pun fallen from the sky must not be too stupefied. Not everything that falls like this is necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The pun is the dung of the flying spirit. The lazzi falls anywhere; and the mind, after the laying of a stupidity, sinks into the azure. A whitish spot that flattens on the rock does not prevent the condor from hovering. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honor him in proportion to his merits; nothing more. All that is most august, most sublime and most charming in humanity, and perhaps outside of humanity, has made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on Saint Peter, Moses on Isaac, Aeschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octave. And note that this pun of Cleopatra preceded the battle of Actium, and without it no one would remember the city of Toryne, a Greek name meaning pot-spoon. That granted, I return to my exhortation. My brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no hustle and bustle, no excess, even in points, gayeties, jubilation and puns. Listen to me, I have the prudence of Amphiaraus and the baldness of Caesar. There must be a limit, even to rebuses. Is modus in rebus. There must be a limit, even at dinners. You like apple turnovers, ladies, don't overdo it. It takes, even in slippers, common sense and art. Gluttony punishes the glutton. Gula punishes Gulax. Indigestion is charged by the good Lord with moralizing stomachs. And, remember this: each of our passions, even love, has a stomach that should not be overfilled. In all things you have to write the word finished in time, you have to contain yourself, when it becomes urgent, to put the lock on your appetite, to put your imagination to the violin and to lead yourself to the post. The wise man is the one who knows how to make his own arrest at some point. Have some confidence in me. Because I did my law a little bit, so my exams say, because I know the difference between the molted question and the pending question, because I defended a thesis in Latin on the way in which torture was given in Rome at the time when Munatius Demens was quaestor of the Parricide, because I am going to be a doctor, it seems, it does not necessarily follow that I am an imbecile. I recommend to you moderation in your desires. True as my name is Félix Tholomyès, I speak well. Happy is he who, when the hour has struck, takes a heroic step and abdicates like Sylla or Origen!","‘Friends!’ cried Tholomyès in the voice of a man reasserting his authority. ‘ Pull yourselves together. This unexpected pun shouldn’t be greeted with too much amazement. Not everything that comes out of the blue is necessarily worthy of admiration and respect. Puns are the droppings of the mind on the wing. The joke lands wherever it falls, and after excreting a joke the mind soars. A white splodge splattered on a rock does not prevent the condor from scaling the heights. Far be it from me to belittle the pun! I have a due respect for its merits, nothing more. The most noble, the most sublime, the most delightful of humankind, and perhaps other than humankind, have played on words. Jesus Christ made a pun about St Peter, Moses about Isaac, Aeschylus about Polynices, Cleopatra about Octavian. And note that Cleopatra’s pun preceded the battle of Actium and without it no one would remember the city of Toryne, a name that sounds like a Greek word meaning ladle. That said, I go back to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, no overeagerness, no hurly-burly, no excess, even in witticisms, jollifications, high spirits, or quips. Listen to me – I have Amphiaraus’ prudence and Caesar’s baldness. There must be a limit, even to rebuses. Est modus in rebus.‡ There must be a limit, even to meals. You’re fond of apple turnovers, ladies. Don’t overindulge your fondness. Even in the matter of turnovers, good sense and artfulness are required. Gluttony punishes the glutton, Gula punit gulax. The good Lord has given indigestion the task of teaching our stomachs a lesson. And remember this: every one of our passions, even love, has a stomach that mustn’t be overfed. In all things the word finis must be written in good time. We must keep ourselves in check, and when it becomes a matter of urgency draw the bolt on our appetite, lock up our cravings and put ourselves behind bars. The wise man is he who knows how to put himself under arrest at any given moment. Trust me a little. Just because I’ve studied a bit of law, so my exam results say, and because I know the difference between a mooted case and a sub judice case, and because I’ve defended a thesis in Latin on the way torture was administered in Rome during the period when Munatius Demens was the Parricide’s magistrate who investigated murder, and because, it would seem, I’m going to qualify as a doctor, it doesn’t necessarily follow that I’m an idiot. I advise you to observe moderation in your desires. As sure as my name is Félix Tholomyès, what I say is right. Happy the man who, when the time comes, shows a hero’s resolve and abdicates like Sulla, or Origen.’","“Friends,” cried Tholomyès, with the accent of a man who had recovered his empire, “Come to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from the skies must not be received with too much stupor. Everything which falls in that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The pun is the dung of the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter where; and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure depths. A whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the condor from soaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honor it in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most august, the most sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps outside of humanity, have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses on Isaac, Æschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And observe that Cleopatra’s pun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not been for it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name which signifies a ladle. That once conceded, I return to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays on words. Listen to me. I have the prudence of Amphiaraüs and the baldness of Cæsar. There must be a limit, even to rebuses. Est modus in rebus. “There must be a limit, even to dinners. You are fond of apple turnovers, ladies; do not indulge in them to excess. Even in the matter of turnovers, good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the glutton, Gula punit Gulax. Indigestion is charged by the good God with preaching morality to stomachs. And remember this: each one of our passions, even love, has a stomach which must not be filled too full. In all things the word finis must be written in good season; self-control must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawn on appetite; one must set one’s own fantasy to the violin, and carry one’s self to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a given moment, to effect his own arrest. Have some confidence in me, for I have succeeded to some extent in my study of the law, according to the verdict of my examinations, for I know the difference between the question put and the question pending, for I have sustained a thesis in Latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at Rome at the epoch when Munatius Demens was quæstor of the Parricide; because I am going to be a doctor, apparently it does not follow that it is absolutely necessary that I should be an imbecile. I recommend you to moderation in your desires. It is true that my name is Félix Tholomyès; I speak well. Happy is he who, when the hour strikes, takes a heroic resolve, and abdicates like Sylla or Origenes.”","“My friends!” exclaimed Tholomyès, in the tone of a man resuming his sway. “Collect yourselves. This pun, though it falls from heaven, should not be welcomed with too much wonder. Everything that falls in this wise is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The pun is the drop ping of the soaring spirit. The jest falls, it matters not where. And the spirit, after freeing itself from the folly, plunges into the clouds. A white spot settling upon a rock does not prevent the condor from hovering above. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honour it in proportion to its merits—no more. The most august, most sublime, and most charming in humanity and perhaps out of humanity, have made plays on words. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses on Isaac, Æschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And mark, that this pun of Cleopatra preceded the battle of Actium, and that, without it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name signifying dipper. This conceded, I return to my exhortation. My brethren, I repeat, no zeal, no noise, no excess, even in witticisms, mirth, gaiety and plays on words. Listen to me; have the prudence of Amphiaraüs, and the boldness of Cæsar. There must be a limit, even to rebuses; Est modus in rebus. There must be a limit even to dinners. You like apple-puffs, ladies; do not abuse them. There must be, even in puffs, good sense and art. Gluttony punishes the glutton. Gula punishes Gulax. Indigestion is charged by God with enforcing morality on the stomach. And remember this: each of our passions, even love, has a stomach that must not be overloaded. We must in everything write the word finis in time; we must restrain ourselves, when it becomes urgent; we must draw the bolt on the appetite, play a fantasia on the violin, then break the strings with our own hand. “The wise man is he who knows when and how to stop. Have some confidence in me. Because I have studied law a little, as my examinations prove, because I know the difference between the question mue and the question pendante, because I have written a Latin thesis on the method of torture in Rome at the time when Munatius Demens was quæstor of the Parricide; because I am about to become doctor, as it seems, it does not follow necessarily that I am a fool. I recommend to you moderation in all your desires. As sure as my name is Félix Tholomyès, I speak wisely. Happy is he, who when the hour comes, takes a heroic resolve, and abdicates like Sylla or Origenes.”"

"Cependant, à la nuit tombante, au moment où la clarté s’en va, l’hiver surtout, à l’heure où la bise crépusculaire arrache aux ormes leurs dernières feuilles rousses, quand l’ombre est profonde et sans étoiles, ou quand la lune et le vent font des trous dans les nuages, ce boulevard devenait tout à coup effrayant. Les lignes noires s’enfonçaient et se perdaient dans les ténèbres comme des tronçons de l’infini. Le passant ne pouvait s’empêcher de songer aux innombrables traditions patibulaires du lieu. La solitude de cet endroit où il s’était commis tant de crimes avait quelque chose d’affreux. On croyait pressentir des pièges dans cette obscurité, toutes les formes confuses de l’ombre paraissaient suspectes, et les longs creux carrés qu’on apercevait entre chaque arbre semblaient des fosses. Le jour, c’était laid ; le soir, c’était lugubre ; la nuit, c’était sinistre.","However, at nightfall, when the light goes away, especially in winter, when the twilight breeze tears the last russet leaves from the elms, when the shadow is deep and without stars, or when the moon and the wind make holes in the clouds, this boulevard suddenly became frightening. The black lines sank and were lost in the darkness like stretches of infinity. The passer-by could not help thinking of the innumerable sinister traditions of the place. There was something terrible about the loneliness of this place where so many crimes had been committed. We thought we sensed traps in this darkness, all the confused shapes of the shadow seemed suspicious, and the long square hollows that we saw between each tree looked like pits. By day, it was ugly; in the evening it was gloomy; at night it was grim.","Nevertheless, at nightfall – when the light fails, especially in winter, and the cold evening wind rips from the elm trees their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deep and starless, or the moon and the wind create holes in the clouds – this boulevard suddenly became frightening. The straight lines sank into the shadows and disappeared like sliced-off sections of the infinite. The passer-by could not help thinking of the countless traditional associations this place had with the gibbet. There was something terrible about the loneliness of this spot where so many crimes had been committed. You thought you sensed pitfalls in this obscurity. Every blurred form in the dark seemed suspect, and the long sunken plots between the trees looked like graves. By day it was ugly. In the evening it was gloomy. By night it was sinister.","Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight is vanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deep and starless, or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades, like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have been committed, had something terrible about it. One almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square, of which one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by day it was ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it was sinister.","Then, at nightfall, at the moment when the day is dying out, especially in winter, at that hour when the evening breeze tears from the elms their faded and withered leaves, when the gloom is deep, without a single star, or when the moon and the wind make openings in the clouds, this boulevard became positively terrifying. The dark outlines shrank together, and even lost themselves in the obscurity like fragments of the infinite. The passerby could not keep from thinking of the innumerable bloody traditions of the spot. The solitude of this neighbourhood in which so many crimes had been committed, had something fearful about it. One felt presentiments of snares in this obscurity; all the confused outlines visible through the gloom were eyed suspiciously, and the oblong cavities between the trees seemed like graves. In the day-time it was ugly; in the evening, it was dismal; at night, it was ominous of evil."
"Et puis, sans bouger, sans remuer la tête, elle se mit à regarder partout avec ses yeux tout grands ouverts et un air joyeux, et elle ne dit plus rien.","And then, without moving, without moving her head, she began to look everywhere with her eyes wide open and a happy air, and she said nothing more.","And then without stirring, without moving her head, she began to look all around her with eyes wide open and an expression of delight, and said not another word.","And then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began to stare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air, and she said nothing more.","And then, without moving, or turning her head, she began to look all about with her eyes wide open and a joyous air, and she said nothing more."

"Il se pencha de nouveau, fouilla le tas, écarta ce qui faisait obstacle, saisit la main, empoigna le bras, dégagea la tête, tira le corps, et quelques instants après il traînait dans l’ombre du chemin creux un homme inanimé, au moins évanoui. C’était un cuirassier, un officier, un officier même d’un certain rang ; une grosse épaulette d’or sortait de dessous la cuirasse ; cet officier n’avait plus de casque. Un furieux coup de sabre balafrait son visage où l’on ne voyait que du sang. Du reste, il ne semblait pas qu’il eût de membre cassé, et par quelque hasard heureux, si ce mot est possible ici, les morts s’étaient arc-boutés au-dessus lui de façon à le garantir de l’écrasement. Ses yeux étaient fermés.","He leaned over again, rummaged through the heap, pushed aside whatever was in the way, seized the hand, grabbed the arm, freed the head, pulled the body, and a few moments later he dragged an inanimate man into the shadow of the sunken road. less fainted. He was a cuirassier, an officer, an officer even of a certain rank; a large gold epaulette protruded from under the cuirass; this officer no longer had a helmet. A furious saber cut scarred his face where only blood could be seen. For the rest, it did not appear that he had a broken limb, and by some happy chance, if that word is possible here, the dead had braced themselves above him in such a way as to protect him from being crushed. His eyes were closed.","He bent down again, fumbled in the heap, pushed aside whatever was causing an obstruction, seized the hand, gripped the arm, freed the head, pulled out the body, and a few moments later he was dragging into the shadow of the sunken road a lifeless, or at least unconscious, man. He was a cuirassier, an officer, and indeed a fairly high-ranking officer; a large gold epaulette showed under his breast-plate. This officer had lost his helmet. A vicious sabre cut had slashed his face, so that all you could see was blood. That apart, he did not appear to have any broken limbs, and by a stroke of good luck, if that term may be used in this context, the dead had formed a buttress over him in such a way as to save him from being crushed. His eyes were closed.","He bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything that was in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head, pulled out the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless, or at least the unconscious, man, through the shadows of hollow road. He was a cuirassier, an officer, and even an officer of considerable rank; a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass; this officer no longer possessed a helmet. A furious sword-cut had scarred his face, where nothing was discernible but blood. However, he did not appear to have any broken limbs, and, by some happy chance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaulted above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed. His eyes were still closed.","He bent over again, rummaged among the heap, removed whatever impeded him, seized the hand, laid hold of the arm, disengaged the head, drew out the body, and some moments after dragged into the shadow of the hollow road an inanimate man, at least one who was senseless.

A furious sabre cut had disfigured his face, where nothing but blood was to be seen. It did not seem, however, that he had any limbs broken; and by some happy chance, if the word is possible here, the bodies were arched above him in such a way as to prevent his being crushed.

"L’évêque, assis près de lui, lui toucha doucement la main. ― Vous pouviez ne pas me dire qui vous étiez. Ce n’est pas ici ma maison, c’est la maison de Jésus-Christ. Cette porte ne demande pas à celui qui entre s’il a un nom, mais s’il a une douleur. Vous souffrez ; vous avez faim et soif ; soyez le bienvenu.

"Il y a presque toujours autour d’un évêque une escouade de petits abbés comme autour d’un général une volée de jeunes officiers. C’est là ce que ce charmant saint François de Sales appelle quelque part « les prêtres blancs-becs ». Toute carrière a ses aspirants qui font cortège aux arrivés. Pas une puissance qui n’ait son entourage. Pas une fortune qui n’ait sa cour. Les chercheurs d’avenir tourbillonnent autour du présent splendide. Toute métropole a son état-major. Tout évêque un peu influent a près de lui sa patrouille de chérubins séminaristes, qui fait la ronde et maintient le bon ordre dans le palais épiscopal, et qui monte la garde autour du sourire de monseigneur. Agréer à un évêque, c’est le pied à l’étrier pour un sous-diacre. Il faut bien faire son chemin ; l’apostolat ne dédaigne pas le canonicat.","There is almost always around a bishop a squad of little abbots as around a general a flock of young officers. This is what this charming Saint Francis de Sales calls somewhere ""the white-beaked priests"". Every career has its aspirants who accompany the arrivals. Not a power that does not have its entourage. Not a fortune that does not have its court. Seekers of the future swirl around the splendid present. Every metropolis has its general staff. Every bishop with a little influence has his patrol of seminarian cherubim near him, who make the rounds and maintain good order in the episcopal palace, and who mount guard around the smile of the Monsignor. To approve a bishop is a foot in the stirrup for a sub-deacon. You have to make your way; the apostolate does not disdain the canonry.","A bishop is nearly always surrounded by a troop of minor clerics, like a bunch of young officers around a general. They are what the delightful St Francis of Sales calls somewhere ‘beardless boy-priests’. Every profession has its aspiring apprentices who form the retinue of those who have already risen. No power is without its entourage, no fortune without its courtiers. Those seeking a future flurry around present splendour. Every archbishop has his general staff. Every bishop of the slightest influence has about him his patrol squad of cherubim-seminarists that do their rounds of the episcopal palace, maintaining order, and mount guard around Monseigneur’s smile. To please a bishop is to get your foot on the ladder for a subdeaconry. A man must make his way. An apostle is not above a sinecure.","A bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbés, just as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is what that charming Saint François de Sales calls somewhere “les prêtres blancs-becs,” callow priests.

The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Every metropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur’s smile. To please a bishop is equivalent to getting one’s foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is necessary to walk one’s path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship.","THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A SQUAD of young abbés about a bishop as there is a flock of young officers about a general. They are what the charming St. Francis de Sales somewhere calls “white-billed priests.” Every profession has its aspirants who make up the cortège of those who are at the summit. No power is without its worshippers, no fortune without its court. The seekers of the future revolve about the splendid present. Every capital, like every general, has its staff. Every bishop of influence has his patrol of undergraduates, cherubs who go the rounds and keep order in the episcopal palace, and who mount guard over monseigneur’s smile.

"Faire le poème de la conscience humaine, ne fût-ce qu’à propos d’un seul homme, ne fût-ce qu’à propos du plus infime des hommes, ce serait fondre toutes les épopées dans une épopée supérieure et définitive. La conscience, c’est le chaos des chimères, des convoitises et des tentatives, la fournaise des rêves, l’antre des idées dont on a honte ; c’est le pandémonium des sophismes, c’est le champ de bataille des passions. A de certaines heures, pénétrez à travers la face livide d’un être humain qui réfléchit et regardez derrière, regardez dans cette âme, regardez dans cette obscurité. Il y a là, sous le silence extérieur, des combats de géants comme dans Homère, des mêlées de dragons et d’hydres et des nuées de fantômes comme dans Milton, des spirales visionnaires comme chez Dante. Chose sombre que cet infini que tout homme porte en soi et auquel il mesure avec désespoir les volontés de son cerveau et les actions de sa vie !","To write the poem of the human conscience, were it only about a single man, were it only about the smallest of men, would be to fuse all epics into a superior and definitive epic. Consciousness is the chaos of chimeras, lusts and attempts, the furnace of dreams, the den of ideas of which one is ashamed; it is the pandemonium of sophisms, it is the battlefield of the passions. At certain hours, step through the livid face of a thinking human being and look behind, look into that soul, look into that darkness. There, under the exterior silence, there are combats of giants as in Homer, melee of dragons and hydras and clouds of phantoms as in Milton, visionary spirals as in Dante. What a gloomy thing is this infinity which every man bears within himself and against which he measures with despair the wills of his brain and the actions of his life!","To create a poem about the human conscience, were it only with regard to a single man, only to the least of men, would be to amalgamate all epics in one superior and definitive epic. Conscience is a confusion of chimeras, of desires and temptations, the furnace of dreams, the retreat of thoughts that shame us. It is a pandemonium of sophisms, it is the battleground of the passions. Probe, at certain moments, the ghastly pale face of a human being immersed in thought, and look behind it, look into that soul, look into that obscurity. There, beneath the outward silence, are battling giants, as in Homer, tumultuous dragons and hydras and phantom hosts, as in Milton, visionary vortices, as in Dante.

Penetrate, at certain hours, past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection, and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze into that obscurity. There, beneath that external silence, battles of giants, like those recorded in Homer, are in progress; skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionary circles, as in Dante. What a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him, and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions of his life!","To write the poem of the human conscience, were it only of a single man, were it only of the most infamous of men, would be to swallow up all epics in a superior and final epic. The conscience is the chaos of chimeras, of lusts and of temptations, the furnace of dreams, the cave of the ideas which are our shame, it is the pandemonium of sophisms, the battle-field of the passions. At certain hours, penetrate within the livid face of a human being who reflects, and look at what lies behind; look into that soul, look into that obscurity. There, beneath the external silence, there are combats of giants as in Homer, melées of dragons and hydras, and clouds of phantoms as in Milton, ghostly labyrinths as in Dante. What a gloom enwraps that infinite which each man bears within himself, and by which he measures in despair the desires of his will, and the actions of his life!"

"Le Thénardier était un homme petit, maigre, blême, anguleux, osseux, chétif, qui avait l’air malade et qui se portait à merveille, sa fourberie commençait là. Il souriait habituellement par précaution, et était poli à peu près avec tout le monde, même avec le mendiant auquel il refusait un liard. Il avait le regard d’une fouine et la mine d’un homme de lettres. Il ressemblait beaucoup aux portraits de l’abbé Delille. Sa coquetterie consistait à boire avec les rouliers. Personne n’avait jamais pu le griser. Il fumait dans une grosse pipe. Il portait une blouse et sous sa blouse un vieil habit noir. Il avait des prétentions à la littérature et au matérialisme. Il y avait des noms qu’il prononçait souvent, pour appuyer les choses quelconques qu’il disait, Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, et, chose bizarre, saint Augustin. Il affirmait avoir « un système ». Du reste fort escroc. Un filousophe. Cette nuance existe. On se souvient qu’il prétendait avoir servi ; il contait avec quelque luxe qu’à Waterloo, étant sergent dans un 6e ou 9e léger quelconque, il avait, seul contre un escadron de hussards de la mort, couvert de son corps et sauvé à travers la mitraille « un général dangereusement blessé ». De là, venait, pour son mur, sa flamboyante enseigne, et, pour son auberge, dans le pays, le nom de « cabaret du sergent de Waterloo ». Il était libéral, classique, et bonapartiste. Il avait souscrit pour le champ d’Asile. On disait dans le village qu’il avait étudié pour être prêtre.","Thénardier was a short, thin, pale, angular, bony, sickly man, who looked ill and who was perfectly fine, his deceit began there. He habitually smiled as a precaution, and was polite to almost everyone, even to the beggar to whom he refused a farthing. He had the look of a weasel and the countenance of a man of letters. It looked a lot like the portraits of Abbé Delille. Her coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters. No one had ever been able to intoxicate him. He was smoking in a big pipe. He wore a blouse and under his blouse an old black coat. He had pretensions to literature and materialism. There were names he often mentioned, to support whatever things he said, Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, oddly enough, Saint Augustine. He claimed to have “a system”. Otherwise very scammer. A filousopher. This nuance exists. We remember that he claimed to have served; he related with some luxury that at Waterloo, being a sergeant in some 6th or 9th light, he had, alone against a squadron of death hussars, covered with his body and saved through grapeshot “a dangerously wounded general”. From there, came, for its wall, its flamboyant sign, and, for its inn, in the country, the name of “cabaret of the sergeant of Waterloo”. He was liberal, classical, and Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d'Asile. It was said in the village that he had studied to be a priest.","A small, thin, pale, angular, bony, puny man, Thénardier looked poorly and was in the best of health – this is where his cunning began. To be on the safe side he smiled habitually, and was more or less polite to everybody, even the beggar to whom he refused a quarter-sou. He had the eyes of a ferret and the appearance of a man of letters. He greatly resembled portraits of Abbé Delille. He indulged his own vanity by drinking with carters. No one had ever managed to get him drunk. He smoked a large pipe. He wore a smock and under his smock an old black coat. He had pretensions in the way of literature and materialism. There were certain names he often mentioned to support whatever he was saying: Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and oddly enough St Augustine. He claimed to have ‘a system’. All in all, a great swindler. A crook philosopher – a filousophe*. This is a distinct category that does exist. Remember, he claimed to have served in the army. He would relate with some relish how at Waterloo, as a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th Light something or other, under a hail of fire, alone against a squadron of death’s-head hussars, he had protected with his body and saved ‘a dangerously wounded general’. Hence the gaudy sign on his wall and the name by which his inn was known locally, ‘the Sergeant of Waterloo tavern’. He was liberal, classicist and Bonapartist. He had contributed to the Champ d’Asile fund. In the village the story was that he had studied for the priesthood.","Thénardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who had a sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here; he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He had the glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He greatly resembled the portraits of the Abbé Delille. His coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk. He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under his blouse an old black coat. He made pretensions to literature and to materialism. There were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever things he might be saying,—Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, singularly enough, Saint Augustine. He declared that he had “a system.” In addition, he was a great swindler. A filousophe [philosophe], a scientific thief. The species does exist. It will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army; he was in the habit of relating with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the presence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body and saved from death, in the midst of the grape-shot, “a general, who had been dangerously wounded.” Thence arose for his wall the flaring sign, and for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of “the cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo.” He was a liberal, a classic, and a Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d’Asile. It was said in the village that he had studied for the priesthood.","The other Thénardier was a little man, meagre, pale, angular, bony, and lean, who appeared to be sick, and whose health was excellent; here his knavery began. He smiled habitually as a matter of business, and tried to be polite to everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused a penny. He had the look of a weazel, and the mien of a man of letters. He had a strong resemblance to the portraits of the Abbé Delille. He affected drinking with waggoners. Nobody ever saw him drunk. He smoked a large pipe. He wore a blouse, and under it an old black coat. He made pretensions to literature and materialism. There were names which he often pronounced in support of anything whatever that he might say. Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, oddly enough, St. Augustine. He professed to have “a system.” For the rest, a great swindler. A fellow-sopher. There is such a variety. It will be remembered, that he pretended to have been in the service; he related with some pomp that at Waterloo, being sergeant in a Sixth or Ninth Light something, he alone, against a squadron of Hussars of Death, had covered with his body, and saved amid a shower of grape, “a general dangerously wounded.” Hence the flaming picture on his sign, and the name of his inn, which was spoken of in the region as the “tavern of the sergeant of Waterloo.” He was liberal, classical, and a Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d’Asile. It was said in the village that he had studied for the priesthood."

Remplissaient est bien le mot, et certes cette journée de l’évêque était bien pleine jusqu’aux bords de bonnes pensées, de bonnes paroles et de bonnes actions. Cependant elle n’était pas complète si le temps froid ou pluvieux l’empêchait d’aller passer, le soir, quand les deux femmes s’étaient retirées, une heure ou deux dans son jardin avant de s’endormir. Il semblait que ce fût une sorte de rite pour lui de se préparer au sommeil par la méditation en présence des grands spectacles du ciel nocturne. Quelquefois, à une heure même assez avancée de la nuit, si les deux vieilles filles ne dormaient pas, elles l’entendaient marcher lentement dans les allées. Il était là seul avec lui-même, recueilli, paisible, adorant, comparant la sérénité de son cœur à la sérénité de l’éther, ému dans les ténèbres par les splendeurs visibles des constellations et les splendeurs invisibles de Dieu, ouvrant son âme aux pensées qui tombent de l’inconnu. Dans ces moments-là, offrant son cœur à l’heure où les fleurs nocturnes offrent leur parfum, allumé comme une lampe au centre de la nuit étoilée, se répandant en extase au milieu du rayonnement universel de la création, il n’eût pu peut-être dire lui-même ce qui se passait dans son esprit ; il sentait quelque chose s’envoler hors de lui et quelque chose descendre en lui.

"Toute armée a une queue, et c’est là ce qu’il faut accuser. Des êtres chauves-souris, mi-partis brigands et valets, toutes les espèces de vespertilio qu’engendre ce crépuscule qu’on appelle la guerre, des porteurs d’uniformes qui ne combattent pas, de faux malades, des écloppés redoutables, des cantiniers interlopes trottant, quelquefois avec leurs femmes, sur de petites charrettes et volant ce qu’ils revendent, des mendiants s’offrant pour guides aux officiers, des goujats, des maraudeurs, les armées en marche autrefois, — nous ne parlons pas du temps présent, — traînaient tout cela, si bien que, dans la langue spéciale, cela s’appelait « les traînards ». Aucune armée ni aucune nation n’étaient responsables de ces êtres ; ils parlaient italien et suivaient les allemands ; ils parlaient français et suivaient les anglais. C’est par un de ces misérables, traînard espagnol qui parlait français, que le marquis de Fervacques, trompé par son baragouin picard, et le prenant pour un des nôtres, fut tué en traître et volé sur le champ de bataille même, dans la nuit qui suivit la victoire de Cerisoles. De la maraude naissait le maraud. La détestable maxime : vivre sur l’ennemi, produisait cette lèpre, qu’une forte discipline pouvait seule guérir. Il y a des renommées qui trompent ; on ne sait pas toujours pourquoi de certains généraux, grands d’ailleurs, ont été si populaires. Turenne était adoré de ses soldats parce qu’il tolérait le pillage ; le mal permis fait partie de la bonté ; Turenne était si bon qu’il a laissé mettre à feu et à sang le Palatinat. On voyait à la suite des armées moins ou plus de maraudeurs selon que le chef était plus ou moins sévère. Hoche et Marceau n’avaient point de traînards ; Wellington, nous lui rendons volontiers cette justice, en avait peu.","Every army has a tail, and that is what is to be blamed. Bat-like beings, half brigands and servants, all the kinds of vespertilio engendered by this twilight called war, wearers of uniforms who do not fight, false patients, formidable cripples, cantiniers crooks trotting, sometimes with their wives, on small carts and stealing what they resell, beggars offering themselves as guides to officers, cads, marauders, armies on the march in the past—we are not talking about the present time , — dragged all this, so that in the special language it was called “stragglers”. No army or nation was responsible for these beings; they spoke Italian and followed the Germans; they spoke French and followed the English. It was by one of these wretches, a Spanish straggler who spoke French, that the Marquis de Fervacques, deceived by his Picard gibberish, and taking him for one of our own, was killed as a traitor and robbed on the very field of battle, in the night following the victory of Cerisoles. From the maraud was born the maraud. The detestable maxim: to live on the enemy, produced this leprosy, which a strong discipline alone could cure. There are reputations that deceive; we do not always know why certain generals, great ones moreover, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated looting; permitted evil is part of goodness; Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be set on fire and blood. One saw following the armies fewer or more marauders according to whether the chief was more or less severe. Hoche and Marceau had no stragglers; Wellington, we do him justice, had few.","Every army has a tail-end and that is where the blame must lie. Hybrid creatures, half brigand half servant, every type of flying rat that this twilight, known as war, engenders – non-combatant wearers of uniform, fake invalids, intimidating cripples, unlicensed victuallers, sometimes with their wives, riding in little carts and stealing what they then sell on, beggars offering themselves as guides to officers, hangers-on, marauders. In days gone by (we are not speaking of the present), armies on the march had all this trailing after them, so much so that in military jargon they were called ‘camp followers’. No army, no nation was responsible for these creatures. They spoke Italian and followed the Germans, they spoke French and followed the English. It was by one of these wretched camp followers, a French-speaking Spaniard, that the Marquis de Fervacques, taken in by his Picardy gabble and mistaking him for one of our own, during the night following the victory of Ceresole was treacherously slain and robbed on the very battlefield itself. The looter was born of looting. That ghastly maxim, ‘Live off the enemy’, produced this plague, which only strict discipline could cure. Some reputations are misleading; it is not always known why certain generals, indeed great generals, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated looting. Making allowances for wrong-doing is an element of goodness. Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be put to fire and sword. The marauders to be seen in the wake of an army were more or less numerous depending on whether the man in charge was more or less of a disciplinarian. Hoche and Marceau had no camp followers, Wellington had few, and we gladly give him credit for this.","Every army has a rear-guard, and it is that which must be blamed. Bat-like creatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts of vespertillos that that twilight called war engenders; wearers of uniforms, who take no part in the fighting; pretended invalids; formidable limpers; interloping sutlers, trotting along in little carts, sometimes accompanied by their wives, and stealing things which they sell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers; soldiers’ servants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,—we are not speaking of the present,—dragged all this behind them, so that in the special language they are called “stragglers.” No army, no nation, was responsible for those beings; they spoke Italian and followed the Germans, then spoke French and followed the English.

The rascal sprang from this marauding. The detestable maxim, Live on the enemy! produced this leprosy, which a strict discipline alone could heal. There are reputations which are deceptive; one does not always know why certain generals, great in other directions, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage; evil permitted constitutes part of goodness. Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire and blood. The marauders in the train of an army were more or less in number, according as the chief was more or less severe. Hoche and Marceau had no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do him the justice to mention it.","Every army has a train, and there the accusation should lie.

"Au moment où il était entré, l’avocat de l’accusé achevait sa plaidoirie. L’attention de tous était excitée au plus haut point ; l’affaire durait depuis trois heures. Depuis trois heures, cette foule regardait plier peu à peu sous le poids d’une vraisemblance terrible un homme, un inconnu, une espèce d’être misérable, profondément stupide ou profondément habile. Cet homme, on le sait déjà, était un vagabond qui avait été trouvé dans un champ, emportant une branche chargée de pommes mûres, cassée à un pommier dans un clos voisin, appelé le clos Pierron. Qui était cet homme ? Une enquête avait eu lieu, des témoins venaient d’être entendus, ils avaient été unanimes, des lumières avaient jailli de tout le débat. L’accusation disait : ― Nous ne tenons pas seulement un voleur de fruits, un maraudeur ; nous tenons là, dans notre main, un bandit, un relaps en rupture de ban, un ancien forçat, un scélérat des plus dangereux, un malfaiteur appelé Jean Valjean que la justice recherche depuis longtemps, et qui, il y a huit ans, en sortant du bagne de Toulon, a commis un vol de grand chemin à main armée sur la personne d’un enfant savoyard appelé Petit-Gervais, crime prévu par l’article 383 du code pénal, pour lequel nous nous réservons de le poursuivre ultérieurement, quand l’identité sera judiciairement acquise. Il vient de commettre un nouveau vol. C’est un cas de récidive. Condamnez-le pour le fait nouveau ; il sera jugé plus tard pour le fait ancien. ― Devant cette accusation, devant l’unanimité des témoins, l’accusé paraissait surtout étonné. Il faisait des gestes et des signes qui voulaient dire non, ou bien il considérait le plafond. Il parlait avec peine, répondait avec embarras, mais de la tête aux pieds toute sa personne niait. Il était comme un idiot en présence de toutes ces intelligences rangées en bataille autour de lui, et comme un étranger au milieu de cette société qui le saisissait. Cependant il y allait pour lui de l’avenir le plus menaçant, la vraisemblance croissait à chaque minute, et toute cette foule regardait avec plus d’anxiété que lui-même cette sentence pleine de calamités qui penchait sur lui de plus en plus. Une éventualité laissait même entrevoir, outre le bagne, la peine de mort possible, si l’identité était reconnue et si l’affaire Petit-Gervais se terminait plus tard par une condamnation. Qu’était-ce que cet homme ? De quelle nature était son apathie ? Était-ce imbécillité ou ruse ? Comprenait-il trop, ou ne comprenait-il pas du tout ? Questions qui divisaient la foule et semblaient partager le jury. Il y avait dans ce procès ce qui effraye et ce qui intrigue ; le drame n’était pas seulement sombre, il était obscur.","As he entered, the defendant's lawyer was finishing his argument. Everyone's attention was excited to the highest degree; the case had been going on for three hours. For three hours this crowd had been watching a man, a stranger, a kind of wretched being, profoundly stupid or profoundly skilful, bend little by little under the weight of a terrible likelihood. This man, as we already know, was a vagrant who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples, broken from an apple tree in a neighboring field, called the field Pierron. Who was this man ? An investigation had taken place, witnesses had just been heard, they had been unanimous, lights had sprung from the whole debate. The prosecution said: ―We have not only a fruit thief, a marauder; we hold there, in our hands, a bandit, a backslider on the run, a former convict, a most dangerous scoundrel, a malefactor called Jean Valjean whom justice has been seeking for a long time, and who, eight years ago, in leaving the prison of Toulon, committed an armed robbery on the person of a Savoyard child called Petit-Gervais, a crime provided for by article 383 of the penal code, for which we reserve the right to prosecute him later, when the identity will be legally acquired. He has just committed a new theft. This is a case of recidivism. Condemn him for the new fact; he will be judged later for the old fact. “Faced with this accusation, before the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused seemed above all astonished. He made gestures and signs that meant no, or he stared at the ceiling. He spoke with difficulty, answered with embarrassment, but from head to toe his whole person was in denial. He was like an idiot in the presence of all these intelligences arrayed in battle around him, and like a stranger in the midst of this society which gripped him. However, there was a most threatening future for him, the likelihood increased every minute, and all this crowd looked with more anxiety than himself on this sentence full of calamities which leaned more and more on him. A possibility even suggested, in addition to the prison, the possible death penalty, if the identity was recognized and if the Petit-Gervais affair ended later in a conviction. Who was this man? What was his apathy? Was it stupidity or cunning? Did he understand too much, or did he not understand at all? Questions that divided the crowd and seemed to divide the jury. There was in this trial what frightens and what intrigues; the drama was not just dark, it was dark.","When he had come in, the defendant’s lawyer was just finishing his speech. Everyone’s attention was as taut as could be; the trial had been going on for three hours. For three hours this crowd had been watching a man, a nobody, a miserable specimen of humanity, either extremely stupid or extremely crafty, gradually sag beneath the burden of a terrible likeness. This man, as we already know, was a vagrant who had been found in a field carrying away a branch laden with ripe apples, broken off an apple tree in a nearby orchard, called the Pierron orchard. Who was this man? An investigation had been conducted. Witnesses had just been heard, they were unanimous, some light had emerged from all the proceedings. The prosecution said, ‘We have here not only a fruit thief, a petty pilferer, we have here a ruffian, a re-offender in breach of the terms of his release, an ex-convict, a most dangerous villain, a criminal named Jean Valjean, long sought by the law, and who eight years ago on leaving the prison hulks at Toulon committed highway robbery with threat of violence on the person of a Savoyard child named Petit-Gervais, a felony under Article 383 of the Penal Code, for which we reserve the right to try him subsequently when his identity has been legally established. He has now committed another theft. We’re dealing here with a repeat offender. Convict him for the recent offence. He will be tried for the previous offence later.’ In the face of this charge, in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused seemed mostly surprised. He made signs and gestures of negation, or else he stared up at the ceiling. Words did not come easily to him, his replies were confused, but his whole person, from head to foot, expressed denial. He was like an idiot in the presence of all these intellects lined up around him ready to do battle, and like a stranger in the midst of this society that detained him. Yet there was for him the most ominous future at stake, one that every moment became increasingly likely, and the entire audience regarded with greater apprehension than he himself this ruinous sentence looming closer and closer. There was even a possibility of not just penal servitude, but a death sentence, to be envisaged if this identity were to be established and the Petit-Gervais incident were subsequently to lead to a conviction. What manner of man was this? What was the nature of his unconcern? Was it imbecility or craftiness? Did he understand too well or did he not understand at all? Questions that divided the crowd and seemed to set the jury at odds. There was in this trial elements of both the terrifying and the intriguing: the drama was not only dark, it was obscure.","At the moment of this entrance, the defendant’s lawyer had just finished his plea. The attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair had lasted for three hours: for three hours that crowd had been watching a strange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible likeness. This man, as the reader already knows, was a vagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples, broken in the orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierron orchard. Who was this man? an examination had been made; witnesses had been heard, and they were unanimous; light had abounded throughout the entire debate; the accusation said: “We have in our grasp not only a marauder, a stealer of fruit; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an old offender who has broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most dangerous description, a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whom justice has long been in search of, and who, eight years ago, on emerging from the galleys at Toulon, committed a highway robbery, accompanied by violence, on the person of a child, a Savoyard named Little Gervais; a crime provided for by article 383 of the Penal Code, the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter, when his identity shall have been judicially established. He has just committed a fresh theft; it is a case of a second offence; condemn him for the fresh deed; later on he will be judged for the old crime.” In the face of this accusation, in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused appeared to be astonished more than anything else; he made signs and gestures which were meant to convey No, or else he stared at the ceiling: he spoke with difficulty, replied with embarrassment, but his whole person, from head to foot, was a denial; he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged in order of battle around him, and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him; nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing future for him; the likeness increased every moment, and the entire crowd surveyed, with more anxiety than he did himself, that sentence freighted with calamity, which descended ever closer over his head; there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded; besides the galleys, a possible death penalty, in case his identity were established, and the affair of Little Gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation. Who was this man? what was the nature of his apathy? was it imbecility or craft? Did he understand too well, or did he not understand at all? these were questions which divided the crowd, and seemed to divide the jury; there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case: the drama was not only melancholy; it was also obscure.","At the moment of his entrance, the counsel for the prisoner was finishing his plea. The attention of all was excited to the highest degree; the trial had been in progress for three hours. During these three hours, the spectators had seen a man, an unknown, wretched being, thoroughly stupid or thoroughly artful, gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible probability. This man, as is already known, was a vagrant who had been found in a field, carrying off a branch, laden with ripe apples, which had been broken from a tree in a neighbouring close called the Pierron inclosure. Who was this man? An examination had been held, witnesses had been heard, they had been unanimous, light had been elicited from every portion of the trial. The prosecution said: “We have here not merely a fruit thief, a marauder; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an outlaw who has broken his ban, an old convict, a most dangerous wretch, a malefactor, called Jean Valjean, of whom justice has been long in pursuit, and who, eight years ago, on leaving the galleys at Toulon, committed a highway robbery, with force and arms, upon the person of a youth of Savoy, Petit Gervais by name, a crime which is specified in Article 383 of the Penal Code, and for which we reserve the right of further prosecution when his identity shall be judicially established. He has now committed a new theft. It is a case of second offence. Convict him for the new crime; he will be tried hereafter for the previous one.” Before this accusation, before the unanimity of the witnesses, the principal emotion evinced by the accused was astonishment. He made gestures and signs which signified denial, or he gazed at the ceiling. He spoke with difficulty, and answered with embarrassment, but from head to foot his whole person denied the charge. He seemed like an idiot in the presence of all these intellects ranged in battle around him, and like a stranger in the midst of this society by whom he had been seized. Nevertheless, a most threatening future awaited him; probabilities increased every moment; and every spectator was looking with more anxiety than himself for the calamitous sentence which seemed to be hanging over his head with ever increasing surety. One contingency even gave a glimpse of the possibility, beyond the galleys, of a capital penalty should his identity be established, and the Petit Gervais affair result in his conviction. Who was this man? What was the nature of his apathy? Was it imbecility or artifice? Did he know too much or nothing at all? These were questions upon which the spectators took sides, and which seemed to affect the jury. There was something fearful and something mysterious in the trial; the drama was not merely gloomy, but it was obscure."

"Or, fort peu de temps après l’époque où il sembla au ministère public que le forçat libéré Jean Valjean, pendant son évasion de quelques jours, avait rôdé autour de Montfermeil, on remarqua dans ce même village qu’un certain vieux cantonnier appelé Boulatruelle avait « des allures » dans le bois. On croyait savoir dans le pays que ce Boulatruelle avait été au bagne ; il était soumis à de certaines surveillances de police, et, comme il ne trouvait d’ouvrage nulle part, l’administration l’employait au rabais comme cantonnier sur le chemin de traverse de Gagny à Lagny.","However, very shortly after the time when it seemed to the public prosecutor that the freed convict Jean Valjean, during his escape of a few days, had prowled around Montfermeil, it was noticed in this same village that a certain old roadmender called Boulatruelle had ""paces"" in the woods. People thought they knew in the country that this Boulatruelle had been in prison; he was subject to certain police surveillance, and, as he could not find work anywhere, the administration employed him at a discount as a roadmender on the crossroad from Gagny to Lagny.","Now, very shortly after the period when it seemed to the public prosecutor that, while on the loose for several days, the freed convict Jean Valjean had been prowling around Montfermeil, in that very same village people noticed that an old road-mender named Boulatruelle was ‘behaving oddly’ in the forest. Locally, it was generally taken for a fact that this Boulatruelle was an ex-convict. He was subject to some sort of police surveillance, and as he could not find a job anywhere else the authorities employed him for a pittance as a road-mender on the Gagny to Lagny byway.","Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked in that village that a certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, had “peculiar ways” in the forest. People thereabouts thought they knew that this Boulatruelle had been in the galleys. He was subjected to certain police supervision, and, as he could find work nowhere, the administration employed him at reduced rates as a road-mender on the crossroad from Gagny to Lagny.","Now, very shortly after the time when the authorities took it into their heads that the liberated convict Jean Valjean had, during his escape of a few days’ duration, been prowling about Montfermeil, it was remarked, in that village, that a certain old road-labourer named Boulatruelle had “a fancy” for the woods.

"Il voyait de même, et comme si elles se fussent mues devant lui avec des formes sensibles, les deux idées qui avaient été jusque-là la double règle de sa vie : cacher son nom, sanctifier son âme. Pour la première fois, elles lui apparaissaient absolument distinctes, et il voyait la différence qui les séparait. Il reconnaissait que l’une de ces idées était nécessairement bonne, tandis que l’autre pouvait devenir mauvaise ; que celle-là était le dévouement et que celle-ci était la personnalité ; que l’une disait : le prochain, et que l’autre disait : moi ; que l’une venait de la lumière et que l’autre venait de la nuit.","He saw in the same way, and as if they had moved before him with sensible forms, the two ideas which had hitherto been the double rule of his life: to hide his name, to sanctify his soul.

He recognized that one of these ideas was necessarily good, while the other could become bad; that one was the devotion and that one was the personality; that one said: the neighbor, and that the other said: me; that one came from the light and the other came from the night.","Similarly, he saw, as if they moved before him in visible form, the two notions that had till now been the twofold rule of his life: to hide his name, to sanctify his soul.

That one was self-sacrifice and the other individualism. That one said ‘my neighbour’, and the other said ‘myself’. That one originated from light and the other from darkness.","In the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him in visible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, formed the double rule of his soul,—the concealment of his name, the sanctification of his life. For the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct, and he perceived the distance which separated them. He recognized the fact that one of these ideas was, necessarily, good, while the other might become bad; that the first was self-devotion, and that the other was personality; that the one said, my neighbour, and that the other said, myself; that one emanated from the light, and the other from darkness.","He saw also, and as if they were laid bare before him with sensible forms, the two ideas which had been hitherto the double rule of his life, to conceal his name, and to sanctify his soul.

He recognised that one of these ideas was necessarily good, while the other might become evil; that the former was devotion, and that the latter was selfishness; that the one said: “the neighbour,” and that the other said: “me;” that the one came from the light, and the other from the night."
"En prenant les mots dans leur sens le plus compréhensif et le plus absolu, on pourrait dire que, séparés de tous par des murs de tombe, Jean Valjean était le Veuf comme Cosette était l’Orpheline.

"Il avait dans l’occasion une raillerie douce qui contenait presque toujours un sens sérieux. Pendant un carême, un jeune vicaire vint à Digne et prêcha dans la cathédrale. Il fut assez éloquent. Le sujet de son sermon était la charité. Il invita les riches à donner aux indigents, afin d’éviter l’enfer qu’il peignit le plus effroyable qu’il put et de gagner le paradis qu’il fit désirable et charmant. Il y avait dans l’auditoire un riche marchand retiré, un peu usurier, nommé M. Géborand, lequel avait gagné deux millions à fabriquer de gros drap, des serges, des cadis et des gasquets. De sa vie M. Géborand n’avait fait l’aumône à un malheureux. A partir de ce sermon, on remarqua qu’il donnait tous les dimanches un sou aux vieilles mendiantes du portail de la cathédrale. Elles étaient six à se partager cela. Un jour, l’évêque le vit faisant sa charité et dit à sa sœur avec un sourire : ― Voilà monsieur Géborand qui achète pour un sou de paradis.","He had on occasion a mild raillery which almost always contained a serious meaning. During a Lent, a young vicar came to Digne and preached in the cathedral. He was quite eloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. He invited the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he painted as most appalling as he could, and to gain paradise, which he made desirable and charming. There was in the audience a wealthy retired merchant, a bit of a loan shark, named M. Géborand, who had earned two millions in making coarse cloth, serges, cadis and gasquets. In his life M. Géborand had never given alms to an unfortunate person. From this sermon, it was noticed that he gave a penny every Sunday to the old beggars of the portal of the cathedral. They were six to share this. One day the bishop saw him doing his charity work and said to his sister with a smile: “Here is Monsieur Géborand, who is buying for a penny of paradise.","He was sometimes capable of gentle mockery that almost always had a serious significance. Once, during Lent, a young vicar came to Digne and preached in the cathedral. He was quite eloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the poor so as to avoid going to hell, which he depicted in the most dreadful terms he could, and to get to paradise, which he represented as desirable and delightful. Among his audience was a somewhat tight-fisted retired wealthy merchant named Monsieur Géborand, who had amassed half a million in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serge, caddis and felt caps. Monsieur Géborand had never in his life been charitable to any poor unfortunate. After that sermon it was noticed he gave one sou every Sunday to the old beggar-women at the cathedral door. They had to share it between six of them. One day the bishop saw him making his donation and said to his sister with a smile, ‘There’s Monsieur Géborand buying one sou’s worth of paradise.’","He was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always concealed a serious meaning.

Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M. Géborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M. Géborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, “There is M. Géborand purchasing paradise for a sou.”","At times he made use of gentle raillery, which was almost always charged with serious ideas. Once, during Lent, a young vicar came to D——, and preached in the cathedral. The subject of his sermon was charity, and he treated it very eloquently. He called upon the rich to give alms to the poor, if they would escape the tortures of hell, which he pictured in the most fearful colours, and enter that paradise which he painted as so desirable and inviting. There was a retired merchant of wealth in the audience, a little given to usury, M. Géborand, who had accumulated an estate of two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloths and serges. Never, in the whole course of his life, had M. Géborand given alms to the unfortunate; but from the date of this sermon it was noticed that he gave regularly, every Sunday, a penny to the old beggar women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it. The bishop chanced to see him one day, as he was performing this act of charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, “See Monsieur Géborand, buying a penny-worth of paradise.”"

"C’était l’avant-train d’un de ces fardiers, usités dans les pays de forêts, et qui servent à charrier des madriers et des troncs d’arbres. Cet avant-train se composait d’un massif essieu de fer à pivot où s’emboîtait un lourd timon, et que supportaient deux roues démesurées. Tout cet ensemble était trapu, écrasant et difforme. On eût dit l’affût d’un canon géant. Les ornières avaient donné aux roues, aux jantes, aux moyeux, à l’essieu et au timon, une couche de vase, hideux badigeonnage jaunâtre assez semblable à celui dont on orne volontiers les cathédrales. Le bois disparaissait sous la boue et le fer sous la rouille. Sous l’essieu pendait en draperie une grosse chaîne digne de Goliath forçat. Cette chaîne faisait songer, non aux poutres qu’elle avait fonction de transporter, mais aux mastodontes et aux mammons qu’elle eût pu atteler ; elle avait un air de bagne, mais de bagne cyclopéen et surhumain, et elle semblait détachée de quelque monstre. Homère y eût lié Polyphème et Shakespeare Caliban.","It was the fore-end of one of those tractor-trailers, used in forest countries, and which are used to carry planks and the trunks of trees. This limber consisted of a massive pivoting iron axle on which fitted a heavy drawbar, and supported by two oversized wheels. This whole ensemble was stocky, crushing and misshapen. It looked like the carriage of a giant cannon. The ruts had given the wheels, the rims, the hubs, the axle and the drawbar, a layer of mud, a hideous yellowish paintwork not unlike that with which cathedrals are gladly adorned. The wood disappeared under the mud and the iron under the rust. Under the axle hung like a drapery a thick chain worthy of a Goliath convict. This chain made one think, not of the beams which it had the function of transporting, but of the mastodons and the mammons which it could have harnessed; she looked like a prison, but a cyclopean and superhuman prison, and she seemed detached from some monster. Homer would have linked Polyphemus and Shakespeare Caliban to it.","It was the front section of one of those trailers commonly used in woodland regions, and which serve to transport timber beams and tree trunks. This front section consisted of a massive swivelling iron axle, fitted with a heavy shaft, supported on two huge wheels. The whole thing was bulky, imposing and misshapen. It looked like the mounting of a gigantic cannon. Ruts had left on the wheels, rims, hub, axle and shaft a layer of mud, a hideous jaundiced coating quite similar to that which is apt to be used for the embellishment of our cathedrals. The wood was hidden under the mud and the iron under the rust. Draped under the axle was a huge chain worthy of a fettered Goliath. This chain conjured up not the wooden beams it was meant to haul but the mastodons and mammoths it might have harnessed. There was something suggestive of the forced-labour camp about it, but a forced-labour camp on a Herculean and superhuman scale; it looked like the loosed chain of some monster. Homer would have tethered Polyphemus with it, and Shakespeare, Caliban.","It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, and which was supported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact, overwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an enormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, the fellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous yellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the iron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain, worthy of some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not the beams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of the galleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and it seemed to have been detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus with it, and Shakespeare, Caliban.","It was the fore-carriage of one of those drays for carrying heavy articles, used in wooded countries for transporting joists and trunks of trees: it consisted of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot to which a heavy pole was attached, and which was supported by two enormous wheels. As a whole, it was squat, crushing, and misshapen: it might have been fancied a gigantic gun-carriage. The roads had covered the wheels, felloes, limbs, axle, and the pole with a coating of hideous yellow-hued mud, similar in tint to that with which cathedrals are sometimes decorated. The wood had disappeared beneath mud; and the iron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung festooned a huge chain fit for a Goliath of the galleys. This chain recalled, not the beams which it was used to carry, but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have harnessed; it reminded one of the galleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and seemed as if unriveted from some monster. With it Homer could have bound Polyphemus, or Shakspeare Caliban."

"De temps immémorial, Montreuil-sur-Mer avait pour industrie spéciale l’imitation des jais anglais et des verroteries noires d’Allemagne. Cette industrie avait toujours végété, à cause de la cherté des matières premières qui réagissait sur la main-d’œuvre. Au moment où Fantine revint à Montreuil-sur-Mer, une transformation inouïe s’était opérée dans cette production des « articles noirs ». Vers la fin de 1815, un homme, un inconnu, était venu s’établir dans la ville et avait eu l’idée de substituer, dans cette fabrication, la gomme laque à la résine et, pour les bracelets en particulier, les coulants en tôle simplement rapprochée aux coulants en tôle soudée. Ce tout petit changement avait été une révolution.","From time immemorial, Montreuil-sur-Mer had as a special industry the imitation of English jet and black beads from Germany.

Towards the end of 1815, a man, an unknown, had come to settle in the city and had had the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, shellac for resin and, for the bracelets in particular, sliders in plate simply brought closer to the sliders in welded plate. This very small change had been a revolution.","From time immemorial Montreuil-sur-Mer’s specialized industry had been the imitation of English jet jewellery and of the black glass jewellery of Germany.

Towards the end of 1815 a man, a stranger, had come and set up business in the town, and had the idea of substituting shellac for resin in the manufacturing process and, for bracelets in particular, using metal clasp links that were simply pinched together instead of soldered.

"Il était temps, on le voit, que Bülow arrivât. Il avait du reste été fort retardé. Il avait bivouaqué à Dion-le-Mont et était parti dès l’aube. Mais les chemins étaient impraticables et ses divisions s’étaient embourbées. Les ornières venaient au moyeu des canons. En outre, il avait fallu passer la Dyle sur l’étroit pont de Wavre ; la rue menant au pont avait été incendiée par les français ; les caissons et les fourgons de l’artillerie, ne pouvant passer entre deux rangs de maisons en feu, avaient dû attendre que l’incendie fût éteint.

"Chaque bataillon de la garde, pour ce dénouement, était commandé par un général. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Poret de Morvan, étaient là. Quand les hauts bonnets des grenadiers de la garde avec la large plaque à l’aigle apparurent, symétriques, alignés, tranquilles, superbes, dans la brume de cette mêlée, l’ennemi sentit le respect de la France ; on crut voir vingt victoires entrer sur le champ de bataille, ailes déployées, et ceux qui étaient vainqueurs, s’estimant vaincus, reculèrent ; mais Wellington cria : Debout, gardes, et visez juste ! le régiment rouge des gardes anglaises, couché derrière les haies, se leva, une nuée de mitraille cribla le drapeau tricolore frissonnant autour de nos aigles, tous se ruèrent, et le suprême carnage commença.

The imperial guard felt in the shadows the army giving way around them, and the vast shaking of the rout, they heard the scavenging! which had replaced the long live the emperor! and, with the flight behind her, she went on, more and more struck down and dying more with every step she took.

It was like seeing twenty Victories entering on the field of battle with their wings spread, and those who were the victors, believing themselves to be vanquished, fell back. But Wellington shouted, ‘Up, Guards, and at ’em!’ The red regiment of English Guards lying behind the hedges sprang up, a hail of grapeshot riddled the tricolour flag fluttering round our eagles, all charged at each other, and the final carnage began.

"Montfermeil est situé entre Livry et Chelles, sur la lisière méridionale de ce haut plateau qui sépare l’Ourcq de la Marne. Aujourd’hui c’est un assez gros bourg, orné, toute l’année, de villas en plâtre, et, le dimanche, de bourgeois épanouis. En 1823, il n’y avait à Montfermeil ni tant de maisons blanches ni tant de bourgeois satisfaits. Ce n’était qu’un village dans les bois. On y rencontrait bien çà et là quelques maisons de plaisance du dernier siècle, reconnaissables à leur grand air, à leurs balcons en fer tordu et à ces longues fenêtres dont les petits carreaux font sur le blanc des volets fermés toutes sortes de verts différents. Mais Montfermeil n’en était pas moins un village. Les marchands de drap retirés et les agréés en villégiature ne l’avaient pas encore découvert. C’était un endroit paisible et charmant, qui n’était sur la route de rien ; on y vivait à bon marché de cette vie paysanne si abondante et si facile. Seulement l’eau y était rare à cause de l’élévation du plateau.","Montfermeil is located between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge of this high plateau which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. Today it is a fairly large town, adorned all year round with plaster villas and, on Sundays, with flourishing bourgeois. In 1823, there were neither so many white houses nor so many satisfied bourgeois in Montfermeil. It was just a village in the woods. Here and there one came across a few country houses of the last century, recognizable by their open air, their balconies of twisted iron and those long windows whose little panes make all sorts of different greens against the white of closed shutters. But Montfermeil was no less a village. The retired cloth merchants and vacationers had not yet discovered it. It was a peaceful and lovely place, which was not on the road to anything; one lived there cheaply from this peasant life so abundant and so easy. Only water was scarce there because of the elevation of the plateau.","Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles on the southern edge of that high plateau separating the Ourcq from the Marne.

But Montfermeil was nonetheless a village. Retired drapers and professional holidaymakers had not yet discovered it. It was a peaceful and charming place that was not on the way to anywhere. There, at little expense, people lived that peasant life of great bounty and ease.

Some pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be sure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in twisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but Montfermeil was nonetheless a village. Retired cloth-merchants and rusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful and charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there people lived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy; only, water was rare there, on account of the elevation of the plateau.","MONTFERMEIL is situated between Livry and Chelles, upon the southern slope of the high plateau which separates the Ourcq from the Marne.

In 1823, there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so many comfortable citizens; it was nothing but a village in the woods.

"Cet arrangement fut accepté avec une soumission absolue par mademoiselle Baptistine.

"Quoi qu’il en soit, au moment même où il s’aperçut que Jean Valjean lui échappait, Javert ne perdit pas la tête. Sûr que le forçat en rupture de ban ne pouvait être bien loin, il établit des guets, il organisa des souricières et des embuscades et battit le quartier toute la nuit. La première chose qu’il vit, ce fut le désordre du réverbère dont la corde était coupée. Indice précieux qui l’égara pourtant en ce qu’il fit dévier toutes les recherches vers le cul-de-sac Genrot. Il y a dans ce cul-de-sac des murs assez bas qui donnent sur des jardins dont les enceintes touchent à d’immenses terrains en friche. Jean Valjean avait dû évidemment s’enfuir par là.

Sure that the convict breaking his ban could not be far away, he set up lookouts, he organized mousetraps and ambushes and scoured the neighborhood all night. The first thing he saw was the mess of the street lamp whose cord was cut. A precious clue which however misled him in that it diverted all research towards the cul-de-sac Genrot. There are fairly low walls in this cul-de-sac that overlook gardens whose enclosures adjoin immense wastelands. Jean Valjean must evidently have fled that way. The fact is that, if he had penetrated a little further into the cul-de-sac Genrot, he would probably have done so, and he was lost.

Sure that the ex-convict who had violated the conditions of his release could not be very far away, he posted lookouts, set up traps and ambushes, and combed the neighbourhood all night long. The first thing he saw was the damage to the street lamp whose rope had been cut. A precious clue that led him astray, however, by directing all his searches around Cul-de-Sac Genrot. There were in this blind alley fairly low walls enclosing gardens whose boundaries bordered on vast tracts of wasteland. Evidently Jean Valjean must have fled in that direction. The fact is, had he gone a little further down Cul-de-Sac Genrot, he might well have done so, and that would have been his undoing. Javert scoured these gardens and this wasteland as if he might have been searching for a needle.","However that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean Valjean had escaped him, Javert did not lose his head. Sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be far off, he established sentinels, he organized traps and ambuscades, and beat the quarter all that night. The first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope had been cut. A precious sign which, however, led him astray, since it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the Cul-de-Sac Genrot. In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land. Jean Valjean evidently must have fled in that direction. The fact is, that had he penetrated a little further in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot, he would probably have done so and have been lost. Javert explored these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle.","However this may be, even at the moment when he perceived that Jean Valjean had escaped him, Javert did not lose his presence of mind. Sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be far away, he set watches, arranged traps and ambushes, and beat the quarter the night through. The first thing that he saw was the displacement of the lamp, the rope of which was cut. Precious indication, which led him astray, however, by directing all his researches towards the Cul-de-sac Genrot. There are in that cul-de-sac some rather low walls which face upon gardens the limits of which extend to some very large uncultivated grounds. Jean Valjean evidently must have fled that way. The fact is that, if he had penetrated into the Cul-de-sac Genrot a little further, he would have done so, and would have been lost.

"Il se leva debout, hésita encore un moment, et écouta ; tout se taisait dans la maison ; alors il marcha droit et à petits pas vers la fenêtre qu’il entrevoyait. La nuit n’était pas très obscure ; c’était une pleine lune sur laquelle couraient de larges nuées chassées par le vent. Cela faisait au dehors des alternatives d’ombre et de clarté, des éclipses, puis des éclaircies, et au dedans une sorte de crépuscule. Ce crépuscule, suffisant pour qu’on pût se guider, intermittent à cause des nuages, ressemblait à l’espèce de lividité qui tombe d’un soupirail de cave devant lequel vont et viennent des passants. Arrivé à la fenêtre, Jean Valjean l’examina. Elle était sans barreaux, donnait sur le jardin et n’était fermée, selon la mode du pays, que d’une petite clavette. Il l’ouvrit, mais, comme un air froid et vif entra brusquement dans la chambre, il la referma tout de suite. Il regarda le jardin de ce regard attentif qui étudie plus qu’il ne regarde. Le jardin était enclos d’un mur blanc assez bas, facile à escalader. Au fond, au delà, il distingua des têtes d’arbres également espacées, ce qui indiquait que ce mur séparait le jardin d’une avenue ou d’une ruelle plantée.","He rose to his feet, hesitated a moment longer, and listened; everything was silent in the house; then he walked straight and with small steps towards the window which he caught a glimpse of. The night was not very dark; it was a full moon over which ran large clouds driven by the wind. Outside there were alternating shadows and light, eclipses, then clearings, and inside a sort of twilight. This twilight, sufficient for guidance, intermittent because of the clouds, resembled the kind of lividity which falls from a cellar vent in front of which passers-by come and go. Arrived at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had no bars, looked out on the garden, and was only closed, according to the fashion of the country, by a small key. He opened it, but, as a sharp cold air suddenly entered the room, he closed it again immediately. He gazed at the garden with that attentive gaze which studies more than it looks. The garden was enclosed by a fairly low white wall, easy to climb. In the background, beyond, he could make out the heads of trees equally spaced, which indicated that this wall separated the garden from an avenue or a planted lane.","He stood up, hesitated yet a moment, and listened. All was quiet in the house. Then walking gingerly he went directly to the window, which he could see. It was not a very dark night. There was a full moon with large clouds driven by the wind coursing across it. This created alternating darkness and light outside, eclipses then brightnesses, and inside a kind of half-light. This half-light, sufficient for a person to find his way by, and intermittent on account of the clouds, was like that sort of leaden wanness that comes in through a basement window with passers-by coming and going in front of it. When he reached the window Jean Valjean examined it. There were no bars on it, it opened on to the garden and was simply fastened with a small latch, according to local custom. He opened it, but as a rush of biting cold air came into the room he immediately shut it again. He observed the garden with that attentive gaze that does not so much look as study. The garden was enclosed by a fairly low white wall, easy to climb. Beyond the wall at the bottom of the garden he could discern regularly spaced-out tree-tops, which indicated that the wall separated the garden from a tree-lined avenue or lane.","He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all was quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not very dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort of twilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passers-by come and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed it again immediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.","He rose to his feet, hesitated for a moment longer and listened; all was still in the house; he walked straight and cautiously towards the window, which he could discern. The night was not very dark; there was a full moon, across which large clouds were driving before the wind. This produced alternations of light and shade, out-of-doors eclipses and illuminations, and in-doors a kind of glimmer. This glimmer, enough to enable him to find his way, changing with the passing clouds, resembled that sort of livid light, which falls through the window of a dungeon before which men are passing and repassing. On reaching the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had no bars, opened into the garden, and was fastened, according to the fashion of the country, with a little wedge only. He opened it; but as the cold, keen air rushed into the room, he closed it again immediately. He looked into the garden with that absorbed look which studies rather than sees. The garden was enclosed with a white wall quite low, and readily scaled. Beyond, against the sky, he distinguished the tops of trees at equal distances apart, which showed that this wall separated the garden from an avenue or a lane planted with trees."

"La maison n’avait pas une porte qui fermât à clef. La porte de la salle à manger qui, nous l’avons dit, donnait de plain-pied sur la place de la cathédrale, était jadis ornée de serrures et de verrous comme une porte de prison. L’évêque avait fait ôter toutes ces ferrures, et cette porte, la nuit comme le jour, n’était fermée qu’au loquet. Le premier passant venu, à quelque heure que ce fût, n’avait qu’à la pousser. Dans les commencements, les deux femmes avaient été fort tourmentées de cette porte jamais close ; mais M. de Digne leur avait dit : Faites mettre des verrous à vos chambres, si cela vous plaît. Elles avaient fini par partager sa confiance ou du moins par faire comme si elles la partageaient. Madame Magloire seule avait de temps en temps des frayeurs. Pour ce qui est de l’évêque, on peut trouver sa pensée expliquée ou du moins indiquée dans ces trois lignes écrites par lui sur la marge d’une bible : « Voici la nuance : la porte du médecin ne doit jamais être fermée, la porte du prêtre doit toujours être ouverte. »","The house did not have a lockable door. The door to the dining room, which as we have said opened directly onto the cathedral square, was once adorned with locks and bolts like a prison door.

In the beginning, the two women had been greatly tormented by this never-closed door; but M. de Digne had said to them: Have your rooms bolted, if you like.

"Un détail que nous ne devons pas omettre, c’est qu’il était d’une force physique dont n’approchait pas un des habitants du bagne. A la fatigue, pour filer un câble, pour virer un cabestan, Jean Valjean valait quatre hommes. Il soulevait et soutenait parfois d’énormes poids sur son dos, et remplaçait dans l’occasion cet instrument qu’on appelle cric et qu’on appelait jadis orgueil, d’où a pris nom, soit dit en passant, la rue Montorgueil près des halles de Paris. Ses camarades l’avaient surnommé Jean-le-Cric. Une fois, comme on réparait le balcon de l’hôtel de ville de Toulon, une des admirables cariatides de Puget qui soutiennent ce balcon se descella et faillit tomber. Jean Valjean, qui se trouvait là, soutint de l’épaule la cariatide et donna le temps aux ouvriers d’arriver.","A detail that we must not omit is that he had a physical strength that none of the inhabitants of the prison did not approach. When fatigued, to spin a cable, to turn a capstan, Jean Valjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and supported enormous weights on his back, and on occasion replaced that instrument which is called a jack and which was formerly called orgueil, from which took its name, by the way, the rue Montorgueil near halls of Paris. His comrades had nicknamed him Jean-le-Cric. Once, while repairing the balcony of the town hall of Toulon, one of Puget's admirable caryatids which support this balcony came unsealed and nearly fell. Jean Valjean, who was there, supported the caryatid with his shoulder and gave the workmen time to arrive.","One detail we must not fail to mention is that he possessed a physical strength far exceeding that any of other inmate of the prison hulks. Paying out a cable or winding a capstan, Jean Valjean could take the strain of four men. He sometimes lifted and supported enormous weights on his back and in cases of necessity acted as a substitute for that implement known as a cric *, in the past called an orgueil, from which incidentally the name of Rue Montorgueil, near the central market in Paris, derives. His comrades had nicknamed him Jean-le-Cric. Once, when repairs were being made to the balcony of Toulon’s city hall, one of Puget’s splendid caryatids that support the balcony became dislodged and almost fell. Jean Valjean, who happened to be there, took the caryatid’s weight on his shoulder, giving the workmen time to get there.","One detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan, Jean Valjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced that implement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly called orgueil [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the name of the Rue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were repairing the balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those admirable caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the point of falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the caryatid with his shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.","We must not omit one circumstance, which is, that in physical strength he far surpassed all the other inmates of the prison. At hard work, at twisting a cable, or turning a windlass, Jean Valjean was equal to four men. He would sometimes lift and hold enormous weights on his back, and would occasionally act the part of what is called a jack, or what was called in old French an orgeuil, whence came the name, we may say by the way, of the Rue Montorgeuil near the Halles of Paris. His comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack. At one time, while the balcony of the City Hall of Toulon was undergoing repairs, one of Puget’s admirable caryatides, which support the balcony, slipped from its place, and was about to fall, when Jean Valjean, who happened to be there, held it up on his shoulder till the workmen came."

"La nuit continuait de tomber. Le vent froid des Alpes soufflait. A la lueur du jour expirant, l’étranger aperçut dans un des jardins qui bordent la rue une sorte de hutte qui lui parut maçonnée en mottes de gazon. Il franchit résolûment une barrière de bois et se trouva dans le jardin. Il s’approcha de la hutte ; elle avait pour porte une étroite ouverture très basse et elle ressemblait à ces constructions que les cantonniers se bâtissent au bord des routes. Il pensa sans doute que c’était en effet le logis d’un cantonnier ; il souffrait du froid et de la faim ; il s’était résigné à la faim, mais c’était du moins là un abri contre le froid. Ces sortes de logis ne sont habituellement pas occupés la nuit. Il se coucha à plat ventre et se glissa dans la hutte. Il y faisait chaud, et il y trouva un assez bon lit de paille. Il resta un moment étendu sur ce lit, sans pouvoir faire un mouvement tant il était fatigué. Puis, comme son sac sur son dos le gênait et que c’était d’ailleurs un oreiller tout trouvé, il se mit à déboucler une des courroies. En ce moment, un grondement farouche se fit entendre. Il leva les yeux. La tête d’un dogue énorme se dessinait dans l’ombre à l’ouverture de la hutte.","Night continued to fall. The cold wind from the Alps was blowing. As the light of day expired, the stranger saw in one of the gardens bordering the street a sort of hut which seemed to him to be built of turf. He resolutely crossed a wooden gate and found himself in the garden. He approached the hut; it had a very low, narrow opening for its door, and it resembled those constructions that the road-menders build for themselves along the roads. He doubtless thought that it was indeed the dwelling of a road-mender; he suffered from cold and hunger; he had resigned himself to hunger, but at least that was shelter from the cold. These kinds of lodgings are usually not occupied at night. He lay down on his stomach and slipped into the hut. It was warm there, and he found a fairly good bed of straw. He remained stretched out on this bed for a moment, unable to move, he was so tired. Then, as his bag on his back bothered him and as it was, moreover, a ready-made pillow, he began to unbuckle one of the straps. At this moment, a fierce growl was heard. He looked up. The head of an enormous mastiff loomed in the shadows at the opening of the hut.","It was getting darker. The cold Alpine wind was blowing. In the fading daylight the stranger noticed in one of the gardens that lined the street a kind of hut that seemed to be made of clods of turf.

It had a very low, narrow opening for a doorway, and it looked like those sheds that road labourers build for themselves by the side of the road.

This sort of shed is not usually occupied at night. He threw himself flat on his stomach and crept into the hut. It was warm inside and he found a reasonably good bed of straw. He lay for a moment stretched out on this bed, incapable of any movement, so exhausted was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back felt uncomfortable and as it would do for a pillow, he started unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment he heard a ferocious growl. He looked up.

Madeleine passed down a street, calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, it happened that a tall man dressed in an iron-grey frock coat, armed with a large cane and wearing a hat down, turned abruptly behind him, and followed him with his eyes until he had disappeared, crossing his arms, shaking his head slowly, and raising his upper lip with his lower lip up to his nose, sort of significant grimace which could be translated as: ―But what is that man? ―Of course I saw him somewhere. ―Anyway, I'm still not his dupe.","Often when Monsieur Madeleine went by in the street, peaceable, loving, with the blessings of everyone around him, a tall man dressed in an iron-grey frock-coat, armed with a stout walking-stick and wearing his hat pulled down, would swing round behind him and follow him with his eyes until he was out of sight, folding his arms, slowly shaking his head and pursing his upper and lower lips towards his nose, a sort of meaningful grimace that might be translated as ‘Now who on earth is that man? I’m sure I’ve seen him somewhere before … Anyhow, I’m not in the least taken in by him.’","It frequently happened that when M.

I certainly have seen him somewhere. In any case, I am not his dupe.”","Often, when Monsieur Madeleine passed along the street, calm, affectionate, followed by the benedictions of all, it happened that a tall man, wearing a flat hat and an iron-grey coat, and armed with a stout cane, would turn around abruptly behind him, and follow him with his eyes until he disappeared, crossing his arms, slowly shaking his head, and pushing his upper with his under lip up to his nose, a sort of significant grimace which might be rendered by: “But what is that man? I am sure I have seen him somewhere. At all events, I at least am not his dupe.”"

"Tout en berçant ses deux petites, la mère chantonnait d’une voix fausse une romance alors célèbre :","While cradling her two little ones, the mother hummed in a false voice a then famous romance:","As she swung her two little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice a then well known ballad: ‘A warrior so bold and a virgin so bright …’","As she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated:—",While rocking the babes the mother sang with a voice out of tune a then popular song:
"C’était une flûte dont quelqu’un jouait dans le voisinage. Cette flûte jouait toujours le même air, un air aujourd’hui bien lointain : Ma Zétulbé, viens régner sur mon âme, et on l’entendait deux ou trois fois dans la journée. Les jeunes filles passaient des heures à écouter, les mères vocales étaient bouleversées, les cervelles travaillaient, les punitions pleuvaient. Cela dura plusieurs mois. Les pensionnaires étaient toutes plus ou moins amoureuses du musicien inconnu. Chacune se rêvait Zétulbé. Le bruit de la flûte venait du côté de la rue Droit-Mur ; elles auraient tout donné, tout compromis, tout tenté pour voir, ne fût-ce qu’une seconde, pour entrevoir, pour apercevoir, le « jeune homme » qui jouait si délicieusement de cette flûte et qui, sans s’en douter, jouait en même temps de toutes ces âmes. Il y en eut qui s’échappèrent par une porte de service et qui montèrent au troisième sur la rue Droit-Mur, afin d’essayer de voir par les jours de souffrance. Impossible. Une alla jusqu’à passer son bras au-dessus de sa tête par la grille et agita son mouchoir blanc. Deux furent plus hardies encore. Elles trouvèrent moyen de grimper jusque sur un toit et s’y risquèrent et réussirent enfin à voir « le jeune homme. » C’était un vieux gentilhomme émigré, aveugle et ruiné, qui jouait de la flûte dans son grenier pour se désennuyer.","It was a flute that someone was playing in the neighborhood. This flute always played the same air, an air now very distant: Ma Zétulbé, come reign over my soul, and we heard it two or three times during the day. Young girls spent hours listening, vocal mothers were upset, brains worked, punishments rained down. This lasted several months. The boarders were all more or less in love with the unknown musician. Each dreamed of being Zétulbé. The sound of the flute came from the direction of the rue Droit-Mur; they would have given everything, compromised everything, tried everything to see, if only for a second, to catch a glimpse, to catch a glimpse of the ""young man"" who played the flute so deliciously and who, without suspecting it, was playing at the same time of all these souls. There were some who escaped through a back door and went up to the third floor on the rue Droit-Mur, in order to try to see through the days of suffering. Impossible. One went so far as to put her arm above her head through the grating and waved her white handkerchief. Two were bolder still. They found a way to climb onto a roof and ventured there and finally managed to see “the young man. He was an old emigrant gentleman, blind and ruined, who played the flute in his attic to get bored.","It was a flute that someone was playing near by. This flute always played the same tune, a tune very remote from the present, ‘My Zétulbé, come reign o’er my soul’, and it was to be heard two or three times a day.

The girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was Zétulbé. The sound of the flute came from the direction of Rue Droit-Mur. They would have given all, risked all, attempted all, to see if only for a second, to glimpse, to clap eyes on the ‘young man’ who played that flute so delightfully and who, without suspecting it, played on all these souls at the same time. There were some girls who slipped out by a service entrance and climbed up to the third floor on Rue Droit-Mur to try to see through the skylights. Impossible! One even thrust her arm through the grating above her head and waved her white handkerchief. Two were yet more audacious. They found a way up to a roof and ventured out on to it, and finally managed to see ‘the young man’. He was a blind old émigré, a ruined gentleman, playing the flute in his garret in order to pass the time.","It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood.

The pupils were all more or less in love with the unknown musician. Each one imagined herself Zétulba.

There were some who escaped by a back door, and climbed up to the third story on the Rue Droit Mur, incurring days of suffering in the endeavour to see him. Impossible.

Il rouvrit les yeux, se dressa brusquement sur son séant, étendit le bras et tâta son havre-sac qu’il avait jeté dans le coin de l’alcôve, puis il laissa pendre ses jambes et poser ses pieds à terre, et se trouva, presque sans savoir comment, assis sur son lit.","His mind oscillated for a whole hour in fluctuations with which some struggle was certainly mingled.

"La porte n’était autre chose qu’un assemblage de planches vermoulues grossièrement liées par des traverses pareilles à des bûches mal équarries. Elle s’ouvrait immédiatement sur un roide escalier à hautes marches, boueux, plâtreux, poudreux, de la même largeur qu’elle, qu’on voyait de la rue monter droit comme une échelle et disparaître dans l’ombre entre deux murs. Le haut de la baie informe que battait cette porte était masqué d’une volige étroite au milieu de laquelle on avait scié un jour triangulaire, tout ensemble lucarne et vasistas quand la porte était fermée. Sur le dedans de la porte un pinceau trempé dans de l’encre avait tracé en deux coups de poing le chiffre 52, et au-dessus de la volige le même pinceau avait barbouillé le numéro 50 ; de sorte qu’on hésitait. Où est-on ? Le dessus de la porte dit : au numéro 50 ; le dedans réplique : non, au numéro 52.

The top of the shapeless bay that beat this door was masked by a narrow batten in the middle of which a triangular opening had been sawn, all together window and vasistas when the door was closed. On the inside of the door a brush dipped in ink had traced the number 52 with two strokes of the fist, and above the batten the same brush had smeared the number 50; so that we hesitated.

The top of the crude opening in which this door was set was covered with a thin panel, in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawn, as both fanlight and ventilator when the door was shut. On the door itself a brush dipped in ink had in a couple of strokes traced the figure 52, and above the panel the same brush had daubed the number 50, thereby creating uncertainty. Where are we?
