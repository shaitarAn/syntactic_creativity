"Nous le répétons, qui ne voit que de cette façon elle est bien plus indélébile? De solide qu’elle était elle devient vivace. Elle passe de la durée à l’immortalité.

From being solid, it has become perennial. It has passed from duration to immortality. A great body may be demolished, but how can ubiquity be rooted out? Had a flood come, the mountain would have disappeared beneath the waves long before the birds ceased to fly above it; and if but a single ark should float on the surface of the cataclysm, they would rest upon it, survive with it, watch with it the going down of the waters; and the new world which rose from that chaos would, on awakening, behold hovering aloft, winged and living, the thought of the world which had been swallowed up.","We repeat, who does not perceive that in this form it is far more indelible?

"Dom Claude, abîmé en lui-même, ne l’écoutait plus. Charmolue, en suivant la direction de son regard, vit qu’il s’était fixé machinalement à la grande toile d’araignée qui tapissait la lucarne. En ce moment, une mouche étourdie qui cherchait le soleil de mars vint se jeter à travers ce filet et s’y englua. À l’ébranlement de sa toile, l’énorme araignée fit un mouvement brusque hors de sa cellule centrale, puis d’un bond elle se précipita sur la mouche, qu’elle plia en deux avec ses antennes de devant, tandis que sa trompe hideuse lui fouillait la tête. – Pauvre mouche ! dit le procureur du roi en cour d’église, et il leva la main pour la sauver. L'archidiacre, comme réveillé en sursaut, lui retint le bras avec une violence convulsive.","Dom Claude, damaged in himself, no longer listened to him. Charmolue, following the direction of his gaze, saw that he had attached himself mechanically to the large spider web that lined the skylight. At that moment, a stunned fly seeking the March sun came and threw itself through this net and got stuck in it. At the shaking of its web, the huge spider made a sudden movement out of its central cell, then with a leap it rushed on the fly, which it bent in half with its front antennae, while its trunk hideous rummaged in his head. - Poor fly! said the king’s procurator in the church court, and he raised his hand to save her. The archdeacon, as if awakened with a start, held his arm with convulsive violence.","Dom Claude, lost in his own thoughts, did not hear him. Charmolue, following the direction of his gaze saw that it was fixed mechanically upon the large cobweb which covered the window. At this instant a rash fly, in search of the March sun, plunged headlong into the trap and was caught in it. At the vibration of its web the huge spider made a sudden sally from its central cell, and with one bound fell upon the fly, which it doubled up with its front antennæ, while its hideous proboscis dug out the head. “Poor fly!” said the king’s proxy to the Ecclesiastical Court; and he raised his hand to save it. The archdeacon, with a start, held back his arm with convulsive force.","Dom Claude, buried in his own thoughts, no longer listened to him.

"Tout en laissant flotter dans cet horizon de brume et de nuit son unique regard, le sonneur sentait au dedans de lui-même une inexprimable inquiétude. Depuis plusieurs jours il était sur ses gardes. Il voyait sans cesse rôder autour de l’église des hommes à mine sinistre qui ne quittaient pas des yeux l’asile de la jeune fille. Il songeait qu’il se tramait peut-être quelque complot contre la malheureuse réfugiée. Il se figurait qu’il y avait une haine populaire sur elle comme il y en avait une sur lui, et qu’il se pourrait bien qu’il arrivât bientôt quelque chose. Aussi se tenait-il sur son clocher, aux aguets, rêvant dans son rêvoir, comme dit Rabelais, l’œil tour à tour sur la cellule et sur Paris, faisant sûre garde, comme un bon chien, avec mille défiances dans l’esprit.","While letting his unique gaze float in this horizon of mist and night, the bell ringer felt within himself an inexpressible anxiety. For several days he had been on his guard. He constantly saw grim-looking men prowling around the church, never taking their eyes off the young girl's asylum. He was thinking that maybe there was some conspiracy going on against the unfortunate refugee. He imagined that there was popular hatred on her as there was on him, and that something might well happen soon. So he stood on his belfry, on the lookout, dreaming in his dream, as Rabelais says, his eye in turn on the cell and on Paris, keeping sure guard, like a good dog, with a thousand suspicions in his mind. .","While his one eye roamed over the expanse of mist and night, the ringer felt within him an inexplicable sense of alarm. For some days he had been upon his guard. He had constantly seen evil-looking men prowling about the church, and never taking their eyes from the young girl’s hiding-place. He fancied that there might be some plot brewing against the unfortunate refugee. He imagined that she was a victim to popular hatred like himself, and that something might come of it soon. He therefore stationed himself upon his tower, on the alert, “dreaming in his dreamery,” as Rabelais has it, his eye by turns bent upon the cell and upon Paris, keeping faithful watch, like a trusty dog, with a thousand doubts and fears.","As the only eye of the bellringer peered into that horizon of mist and night, he felt within him an inexpressible uneasiness.

He fancied that some plot might be in process of formation against the unhappy refugee.

vaste symphonie en pierre, pour ainsi dire ; œuvre colossale d’un homme et d’un peuple, tout ensemble une et complexe comme les Iliades et les Romanceros dont elle est sœur; produit prodigieux de la cotisation de toutes les forces d’une époque, où sur chaque pierre on voit saillir en cent façons la fantaisie de l’ouvrier disciplinée par le génie de l’artiste ; sorte de création humaine, en un mot, puissante et féconde comme la création divine dont elle semble avoir dérobé le double caractère : variété, éternité.","And first of all, to cite only a few capital examples, there are certainly few more beautiful architectural pages than this facade where, successively and at the same time, the three portals hollowed out in a pointed arch, the embroidered and serrated cord of twenty-eight royal niches, the immense central rose window flanked by its two side windows like the priest of the deacon and the sub-deacon, the tall and frail gallery of trefoil arcades which carries a heavy platform on its fine columns, finally the two black and massive towers with their slate canopies, harmonious parts of a magnificent whole, superimposed in five gigantic floors, develop to the eye, in crowds and without disturbance, with their innumerable details of statuary, sculpture and carving, powerfully rallied to the tranquil grandeur of the whole;

as it were, a vast symphony in stone; the colossal work of one man and one nation, one and yet complex, like the Iliad and the old Romance epics, to which it is akin; the tremendous sum of the joint contributions of all the forces of an entire epoch, in which every stone reveals, in a hundred forms, the fancy of the workman disciplined by the genius of the artist,—a sort of human creation, in brief, powerful and prolific as the Divine creation, whose double characteristics, variety and eternity, it seems to have acquired.","And, in the first place, to cite only a few leading examples, there certainly are few finer architectural pages than this façade, where, successively and at once, the three portals hollowed out in an arch;

"– Sire ! votre majesté daignera m’entendre ! Sire ! n’éclatez pas en tonnerre sur si peu de chose que moi. La grande foudre de Dieu ne bombarde pas une laitue. Sire, vous êtes un auguste monarque très puissant, ayez pitié d’un pauvre homme honnête, et qui serait plus empêché d’attiser une révolte qu’un glaçon de donner une étincelle ! Très gracieux sire, la débonnaireté est vertu de lion et de roi. Hélas ! la rigueur ne fait qu’effaroucher les esprits, les bouffées impétueuses de la bise ne sauraient faire quitter le manteau au passant, le soleil donnant de ses rayons peu à peu l’échauffe de telle sorte qu’il le fera mettre en chemise. Sire, vous êtes le soleil. Je vous le proteste, mon souverain maître et seigneur, je ne suis pas un compagnon truand, voleur et désordonné. La révolte et les briganderies ne sont pas de l’équipage d’Apollo. Ce n’est pas moi qui m’irai précipiter dans ces nuées qui éclatent en des bruits de séditions. Je suis un fidèle vassal de votre majesté. La même jalousie qu’a le mari pour l’honneur de sa femme, le ressentiment qu’a le fils pour l’amour de son père, un bon vassal les doit avoir pour la gloire de son roi, il doit sécher pour le zèle de sa maison, pour l’accroissement de son service. Toute autre passion qui le transporterait ne serait que fureur. Voilà, sire, mes maximes d’état. Donc, ne me jugez pas séditieux et pillard à mon habit usé aux coudes. Si vous me faites grâce, sire, je l’userai aux genoux à prier Dieu soir et matin pour vous ! Hélas ! je ne suis pas extrêmement riche, c’est vrai. Je suis même un peu pauvre. Mais non vicieux jour cela. Ce n’est pas ma faute. Chacun sait que les grandes richesses ne se tirent pas des belles-lettres, et que les plus consommés aux bons livres n’ont pas toujours gros feu l’hiver. La seule avocasserie prend tout le grain et ne laisse que la paille aux autres professions scientifiques. Il y a quarante très excellents proverbes sur le manteau troué des philosophes. Oh ! sire ! la clémence est la seule lumière qui puisse éclairer l’intérieur d’une grande âme. La clémence porte le flambeau devant toutes les autres vertus. Sans elle, ce sont des aveugles qui cherchent Dieu à tâtons. La miséricorde, qui est la même chose que la clémence, fait l’amour des sujets qui est le plus puissant corps de garde à la personne du prince. Qu’est-ce que cela vous fait, à vous majesté dont les faces sont éblouies, qu’il y ait un pauvre homme de plus sur la terre ? un pauvre innocent philosophe, barbotant dans les ténèbres de la calamité, avec son gousset vide qui résonne sur son ventre creux ? D’ailleurs, sire, je suis un lettré. Les grands rois se font une perle à leur couronne de protéger les lettres. Hercules ne dédaignait pas le titre de Musagetes. Mathias Corvin favorisait Jean de Monroyal, l’ornement des mathématiques. Or, c’est une mauvaise manière de protéger les lettres que de pendre les lettrés. Quelle tache à Alexandre s’il avait fait pendre Aristoteles ! Ce trait ne serait pas un petit moucheron sur le visage de sa réputation pour l’embellir, mais bien un malin ulcère pour le défigurer. Sire ! j’ai fait un très expédient épithalame pour madamoiselle de Flandre et monseigneur le très auguste dauphin. Cela n’est pas d’un boute-feu de rébellion. Votre majesté voit que je ne suis pas un grimaud, que j’ai étudié excellemment, et que j’ai beaucoup d’éloquence naturelle. Faites-moi grâce, sire. Cela faisant, vous ferez une action galante à Notre-Dame, et je vous jure que je suis très effrayé de l’idée d’être pendu !","- Sire! your majesty will deign to hear me! Sire! don’t burst into thunder over so little as me. The great thunderbolt of God does not bombard a lettuce. Sire, you are a very powerful august monarch, have pity on a poor honest man, and who would be more prevented from stirring up a revolt than an ice cube giving a spark! Very gracious sire, good-naturedness is the virtue of a lion and a king. Alas! the severity only frightens the spirits, the fiery gusts of the north wind cannot make the passer-by leave the coat, the sun giving out its rays little by little warms it so that it will make him put on his shirt. Sire, you are the sun. I protest to you, my sovereign master and lord, I am not a mobster, thief and disorderly companion. Revolt and brigandry are not Apollo's crew. It is not I who will rush into these clouds which burst into sounds of sedition. I am a faithful vassal of your majesty. The same jealousy that the husband has for the honor of his wife, the resentment that the son has for the love of his father, a good vassal must have them for the glory of his king, he must dry up for zeal of his house, for the increase of his service. Any other passion that would transport him would only be fury. There, sire, my maxims of state. So, don't judge me to be seditious and a looter by my worn-out coat on the elbows. If you will spare me, sire, I will wear him down on my knees praying to God night and morning for you! Alas! I'm not extremely wealthy, that's true. I am even a little poor. But no vicious day that. It's not my fault. Everyone knows that great wealth cannot be derived from belles-lettres, and that the most consumed with good books do not always have a big fire in winter. The single avocado takes all the grain and leaves only the chaff to other scientific professions. There are forty very excellent proverbs on the holed mantle of the philosophers. Oh ! sire! mercy is the only light that can illuminate the interior of a great soul. Mercy carries the torch before all the other virtues. Without it, they are blind people who are groping for God. Mercy, which is the same as clemency, makes the love of the subjects who is the most powerful body of guard in the person of the prince. What does it do to you, your majesty whose faces are dazzled, that there is one more poor man on earth? a poor innocent philosopher, dabbling in the shadows of calamity, with his empty pocket echoing on his hollow stomach? Besides, sire, I am a scholar. Great kings make a pearl in their crown to protect the letters. Hercules did not disdain the title of Musagetes. Mathias Corvin favored Jean de Monroyal, the ornament of mathematics. Hanging scholars is a bad way to protect letters. What a stain on Alexander if he had hanged Aristoteles! This trait would not be a small gnat on the face of his reputation to beautify him, but a malicious ulcer to disfigure him. Sire! I made a very expedient epithalame for Madamoiselle de Flandre and Monsignor the very august Dauphin. This is not a fiery rebellion. Your Majesty sees that I am not a jerk, that I have studied excellently, and that I have a great deal of natural eloquence. Do me thanks, sire. In doing so, you will be doing a gallant deed in Notre Dame, and I swear to you that I am very afraid of being hanged!","“Sire, your Majesty will deign to hear me. Sire, let not your thunders fall upon so small a thing as I! The thunderbolts of God never strike a lettuce. Sire, you are an august and very mighty monarch; have pity on a poor honest man, who would find it harder to kindle a revolt than an icicle to emit a spark. Most gracious lord, magnanimity is a virtue of kings and of royal beasts. Alas! rigor does but anger the minds of men; the fierce blasts of winter could not make the traveler doff his cloak, while the sun shining down, little by little warmed him to such a degree that he stripped to his shirt. Sire, you are the sun. I protest to you, my sovereign lord and master, that I am not of the company of the Vagrants. I am neither disorderly nor a thief. Rebellion and brigandage arc not of Apollo’s train. I am not one to rush into those clouds which burst in thunders of sedition. I am a faithful vassal of your Majesty. A good subject should feel the same jealousy for the glory of his king that the husband feels for the honor of his wife, the same affection with which the son responds to his father’s love; he should burn with zeal for his house, for the increase of his service. Any other passion which possessed him would be mere madness. Such, Sire, are my political maxims. Do not, therefore, judge me to be a rebel and a plunderer, by my ragged dress. If you will but pardon me, Sire, I will wear it threadbare at the knees in praying to God for you night and morning! Alas! I am not exceeding rich, ‘tis true. I am indeed rather poor; but not vicious, for all that. It is not my fault. Every one knows that great wealth is not to be derived from literature, and that the most accomplished writers have not always much fire in winter. Lawyers get all the grain, and leave nothing but the chaff for the rest of the learned professions. There are forty most excellent proverbs about the tattered cloak of the philosopher. Oh, Sire, clemency is the only light which can illumine the interior of a great soul! Clemency bears the torch for all the other virtues. Without her, they are but blind, and gropers after God. Mercy, which is the same thing as clemency, produces those loving subjects who are the most potent body-guard of princes. What matters it to you,—to you whose majesty dazzles all who behold it,—if there be one poor man the more upon the earth, a poor innocent philosopher floundering in the darkness of calamity, with an empty stomach and an empty purse? Besides, Sire, I am a scholar. Great kings add a pearl to their crown when they encourage letters. Hercules did not disdain the title of Musagetes. Matthias Corvinus favored Jean of Monroyal, the ornament of mathematics. Now, it is a poor way of protecting letters, to hang the learned. What a blot upon Alexander’s fame if he had hanged Aristotle! The deed would not have been a tiny patch upon the visage of his reputation to enhance its beauty, but a malignant ulcer to disfigure it. Sire, I wrote a most fitting epithalamium for the Lady of Flanders, and my lord the most august Dauphin. That is no fire-brand of rebellion. Your Majesty sees that I am no mere scribbler, that I have studied deeply, and that I have much natural eloquence. Pardon me, Sire. By so doing, you will perform an act of gallantry to Our Lady; and I vow that I am mightily frightened at the very idea of being hanged!”","""Sire! will your majesty deign to hear me. Sire! break not in thunder over so small a thing as myself. God's great lightning doth not bombard a lettuce. Sire, you are an august and, very puissant monarch; have pity on a poor man who is honest, and who would find it more difficult to stir up a revolt than a cake of ice would to give out a spark! Very gracious sire, kindness is the virtue of a lion and a king. Alas! rigor only frightens minds; the impetuous gusts of the north wind do not make the traveller lay aside his cloak; the sun, bestowing his rays little by little, warms him in such ways that it will make him strip to his shirt. Sire, you are the sun. I protest to you, my sovereign lord and master, that I am not an outcast, thief, and disorderly fellow. Revolt and brigandage belong not to the outfit of Apollo. I am not the man to fling myself into those clouds which break out into seditious clamor. I am your majesty's faithful vassal. That same jealousy which a husband cherisheth for the honor of his wife, the resentment which the son hath for the love of his father, a good vassal should feel for the glory of his king; he should pine away for the zeal of this house, for the aggrandizement of his service. Every other passion which should transport him would be but madness. These, sire, are my maxims of state: then do not judge me to be a seditious and thieving rascal because my garment is worn at the elbows. If you will grant me mercy, sire, I will wear it out on the knees in praying to God for you night and morning! Alas! I am not extremely rich, 'tis true. I am even rather poor. But not vicious on that account. It is not my fault. Every one knoweth that great wealth is not to be drawn from literature, and that those who are best posted in good books do not always have a great fire in winter. The advocate's trade taketh all the grain, and leaveth only straw to the other scientific professions. There are forty very excellent proverbs anent the hole–ridden cloak of the philosopher. Oh, sire! clemency is the only light which can enlighten the interior of so great a soul. Clemency beareth the torch before all the other virtues. Without it they are but blind men groping after God in the dark. Compassion, which is the same thing as clemency, causeth the love of subjects, which is the most powerful bodyguard to a prince. What matters it to your majesty, who dazzles all faces, if there is one poor man more on earth, a poor innocent philosopher spluttering amid the shadows of calamity, with an empty pocket which resounds against his hollow belly?

"Ce mot fit en effet une grande impression sur Phœbus, mais non celle que le sourd en attendait. On se rappelle que notre galant officier s’était retiré avec Fleur-de-Lys quelques moments avant que Quasimodo sauvât la condamnée des mains de Charmolue. Depuis, dans toutes ses visites au logis Gondelaurier, il s’était bien gardé de reparler de cette femme dont le souvenir, après tout, lui était pénible ; et de son côté Fleur-de-Lys n’avait pas jugé politique de lui dire que l’égyptienne vivait. Phœbus croyait donc la pauvre Similar morte, et qu’il y avait déjà un ou deux mois de cela. Ajoutons que depuis quelques instants le capitaine songeait à l’obscurité profonde de la nuit, à la laideur surnaturelle, à la voix sépulcrale de l’étrange messager, que minuit était passé, que la rue était déserte comme le soir où le moine-bourru l’avait accosté, et que son cheval soufflait en regardant Quasimodo.","This word indeed made a great impression on Phoebus, but not the one the deaf person expected. We remember that our gallant officer retired with Fleur-de-Lys a few moments before Quasimodo saved the condemned woman from Charmolue's hands. Since then, in all his visits to Logis Gondelaurier, he has been careful not to speak again of this woman whose memory, after all, was painful to him; and Fleur-de-Lys, for her part, did not consider it political to tell him that the Egyptian was alive. Phoebus therefore believed poor Similar was dead, and that it was already a month or two ago. Let us add that for a few moments the captain had been thinking of the deep darkness of the night, of the supernatural ugliness, of the sepulchral voice of the strange messenger, that midnight had passed, that the street was deserted like the evening when the monk-surru had accosted him, and his horse was puffing while looking at Quasimodo.","These words did indeed make a strong impression upon Phoebus, but not of the nature which the deaf man expected.

Since then, during his visits to the Gondelaurier house he had carefully avoided all mention of the woman, whose memory was painful to him; and on her side, Fleur-de-Lys had not thought it politic to tell him that the gipsy still lived. Phoebus therefore supposed poor “Similar” to have died some two or three months before. Let us add that for some moments past the captain had been pondering on the exceeding darkness of the night, the supernatural ugliness and sepulchral tones of the strange messenger, the fact that it was long past midnight, that the street was as deserted as on the night when the goblin monk addressed him, and that his horse snorted at the sight of Quasimodo.","This word did, indeed, produce a great effect on Phoebus, but not of the kind which the deaf man expected.

"Ce n’était pas du reste chose très rare dans les villes du moyen âge que cette espèce de tombeaux. On rencontrait souvent, dans la rue la plus fréquentée, dans le marché le plus bariolé et le plus assourdissant, tout au beau milieu, sous les pieds des chevaux, sous la roue des charrettes en quelque sorte, une cave, un puits, un cabanon muré et grillé, au fond duquel priait jour et nuit un être humain, volontairement dévoué à quelque lamentation éternelle, à quelque grande expiation. Et toutes les réflexions qu’éveillerait en nous aujourd’hui cet étrange spectacle, cette horrible cellule, sorte d’anneau intermédiaire de la maison et de la tombe, du cimetière et de la cité, ce vivant retranché de la communauté humaine et compté désormais chez les morts, cette lampe consumant sa dernière goutte d’huile dans l’ombre, ce reste de vie vacillant dans une fosse, ce souffle, cette voix, cette prière éternelle dans une boîte de pierre, cette face à jamais tournée vers l’autre monde, cet œil déjà illuminé d’un autre soleil, cette oreille collée aux parois de la tombe, cette âme prisonnière dans ce corps, ce corps prisonnier dans ce cachot, et sous cette double enveloppe de chair et de granit le bourdonnement de cette âme en peine, rien de tout cela n’était perçu par la foule. La piété peu raisonneuse et peu subtile de ce temps-là ne voyait pas tant de facettes à un acte de religion. Elle prenait la chose en bloc, et honorait, vénérait, sanctifiait au besoin le sacrifice, mais n’en analysait pas les souffrances et s’en apitoyait médiocrement. Elle apportait de temps en temps quelque pitance au misérable pénitent, regardait par le trou s’il vivait encore, ignorait son nom, savait à peine depuis combien d’années il avait commencé à mourir, et à l’étranger qui les questionnait sur le squelette vivant qui pourrissait dans cette cave, les voisins répondaient simplement, si c'était un homme : – « C'est le reclus » ; si c’était une femme : – « C'est la recluse ».","It was not, moreover, a very rare thing in the towns of the Middle Ages that this species of tombs.

The little reasoning and unsubtle piety of that time did not see so many facets in an act of religion. She took it as a whole, and honored, venerated, sanctified the sacrifice if necessary, but did not analyze its sufferings and felt poorly for it. From time to time she brought the miserable penitent some sustenance, looked through the hole if he was still alive, did not know his name, hardly knew how many years ago he had begun to die, and to the stranger who questioned them about the A living skeleton that was rotting in this cellar, the neighbors would simply reply, if it was a man: - ""He's the recluse""; if it was a woman: - ""She's the recluse"".","Nor was this sort of tomb a great rarity in the cities of the Middle Ages.

"– C'est le paradis! s’écria Gringoire. Et se penchant sur les sculptures avec la mine éblouie d’un démonstrateur de phénomènes vivants : Est-ce donc que vous ne trouvez pas, par exemple, cette métamorphose de basse-taille exécutée avec beaucoup d’adresse, de mignardise et de patience? Regardez cette colonnette. Autour de quel chapiteau avez-vous vu feuilles plus tendres et mieux caressées du ciseau ? Voici trois rondes-bosses de Jean Maillevin. Ce ne sont pas les plus belles œuvres de ce grand génie. Néanmoins, la naïveté, la douceur des visages, la gaieté des attitudes et des draperies, et cet agrément inexplicable qui se mêle dans tous les défauts, rendent les figurines bien égayées et bien délicates, peut-être même trop. – Vous trouvez que ce n’est pas divertissant ?","- It is paradise! cried Gringoire. And leaning over the sculptures with the dazzled look of a demonstrator of living phenomena: So don't you find, for example, this low-rise metamorphosis performed with great skill, cuteness and patience? Look at this post. Around which marquee have you seen softer leaves and better caressed with the chisel? Here are three roundabouts from Jean Maillevin. These are not the finest works of this great genius. Nevertheless, the naivety, the softness of the faces, the gaiety of the attitudes and the draperies, and this inexplicable pleasure which is mixed in all the faults, make the figurines very bright and very delicate, perhaps even too much. - Do you think that’s not entertaining?","“It is paradise!” exclaimed Gringoire. And bending over the sculptures with the ravished mien of a demonstrator of living phenomena, he added: “For instance, don’t you think that metamorphosis in low-relief is carved with exceeding skill, refinement, and patience? Just look at this little column. Around what capital did you ever see foliage more graceful or more daintily chiseled? Here are three of Jean Maillevin’s alto-relievos. They are not the finest works of that great genius. Still, the ingenuousness, the sweetness of the faces, the careless ease of the attitudes and draperies, and that inexplicable charm which is mingled with all their defects, make these tiny figures most delicate and delightful, perhaps almost too much so.

"– Messire, dit piteusement Gringoire, c’est en effet un prodigieux accoutrement, et vous m’en voyez plus penaud qu'un chat coiffé d’une calebasse. C'est bien mal fait, je le sens, d’exposer messieurs les sergents du guet à bâtonner sous cette casaque l’humérus d’un philosophe pythagoricien. Mais que voulez-vous, mon révérend maître ? la faute en est à mon ancien justaucorps qui m’a lâchement abandonné au commencement de l’hiver, sous prétexte qu’il tombait en loques et qu’il avait besoin de s’aller reposer dans la hotte du chiffonnier. Que faire ? la civilisation n’en est pas encore arrivée au point que l’on puisse aller tout nu, comme le voulait l’ancien Diogénès. Ajoutez qu’il ventait un vent très froid, et ce n’est pas au mois de janvier qu’on peut essayer avec succès de faire faire ce nouveau pas à l’humanité. Cette casaque s’est présentée. Je l’ai prise, et j’ai laissé là ma vieille souquenille noire, laquelle, pour un hermétique comme moi, était fort peu hermétiquement close. Me voilà donc en habit d’histrion, comme saint Genest. Que voulez-vous ? c’est une éclipse. Apollo a bien gardé les gorrines chez Admétès.","'Sir,' said Gringoire piteously, 'it is indeed a stupendous outfit, and you see me more sheepish than a cat wearing a calabash. It is very badly done, I feel it, to expose the sergeants of the watch to baton under this cloak the humerus of a Pythagorean philosopher. But what do you want, my reverend master? blame it on my old leotard which cowardly abandoned me at the onset of winter on the pretext that it was falling apart and needed to go and rest in the ragpicker's hood. What to do ? civilization has not yet come to the point that one can go naked, as ancient Diogenes wanted. Add that it was a very cold wind, and January is not the month when we can successfully try to take this new step for humanity. This jacket presented itself. I took it, and I left my old black strainer there, which, for a hermetic like me, was not hermetically sealed. So here I am in an entertainer's habit, like Saint Genest. What do you want ? it is an eclipse. Apollo kept the gorrins well at Admétès.","“Sir,” said Gringoire, in piteous tones, “it is in sooth a monstrous garb, and I feel as much abashed as a cat with a calabash on her head. ‘Tis very ill done, I feel, to expose the gentlemen of the watch to the risk of cudgelling the shoulders of a Pythagorean philosopher under this loose coat. But what else could I do, my reverend master? The blame belongs entirely to my old doublet, which basely deserted me at the very beginning of winter, on the plea that it was falling to pieces, and must needs take a little rest in some rag-picker’s basket. What could I do? Civilization has not yet reached the point where a man may go naked, as Diogenes of old desired. Besides, the wind blew very cold, and the month of January is not a good time to introduce such a new measure to mankind with any hope of success. This coat offered itself; I accepted it, and left behind my old black frock, which, for a Hermetic like myself, was far from being hermetically closed. So here I am in the dress of a mountebank, like Saint Genest. How can I help it? It is an eclipse; but even Apollo kept the swine of Admetus.”","""Messire,"" said Gringoire, piteously, ""it is, in fact, an amazing accoutrement.

"– ... D’autres ont pensé, continua l’archidiacre rêveur, qu’il valait mieux opérer sur un rayon de Sirius. Mais il est bien malaisé d’avoir ce rayon pur, à cause de la présence simultanée des autres étoiles qui viennent s’y mêler. Flamel estime qu’il est plus simple d’opérer sur le feu terrestre. Flamel ! quel nom de prédestiné, Flamma ! – Oui, le feu. Voilà tout. – Le diamant est dans le charbon, l’or est dans le feu. – Mais comment l’en tirer? – Magistri affirme qu’il y a certains noms de femme d’un charme si doux et si mystérieux qu’il suffit de les prononcer pendant l’opération... – Lisons ce qu’en dit Manou : « Où les femmes sont honorées, les divinités sont réjouies ; où elles sont méprisées, il est inutile de prier Dieu. – La bouche d’une femme est constamment pure; c’est une eau courante, c’est un rayon de soleil. – Le nom d’une femme doit être agréable, doux, imaginaire ; finir par des voyelles longues, et ressembler à des mots de bénédiction. » – ...

That is all: the diamond lurks in the coal; gold is to be found in fire. But how to extract it? Magistri declares that there are certain feminine names possessing so sweet and mysterious a spell that it is enough to pronounce them during the operation. Let us read what Manu says under this head: ‘Where women are reverenced, the divinities rejoice; where they are scorned, it is vain to pray to God. A woman’s mouth is ever pure; it is like running water, it is like a sunbeam.

"Le lecteur n’a peut-être pas oublié l’effronté mendiant qui était venu se cramponner, dès le commencement du prologue, aux franges de l’estrade cardinale. L'arrivée des illustres conviés ne lui avait nullement fait lâcher prise, et tandis que prélats et ambassadeurs s’encaquaient, en vrais harengs flamands, dans les stalles de la tribune, lui s’était mis à l’aise, et avait bravement croisé ses jambes sur l’architrave. L'insolence était rare, et personne ne s’en était aperçu au premier moment, l’attention étant tournée ailleurs. Lui, de son côté, ne s’apercevait de rien dans la salle ; il balançait sa tête avec une insouciance de napolitain, répétant de temps en temps dans la rumeur, comme par une machinale habitude : « La charité, s’il vous plaît ! » Et certes il était, dans toute l’assistance, le seul probablement qui n’eût pas daigné tourner la tête à l’altercation de Coppenole et de l’huissier. Or, le hasard voulut que le maître chaussetier de Gand, avec qui le peuple sympathisait déjà si vivement et sur qui tous les yeux étaient fixés, vînt précisément s’asseoir au premier rang de l’estrade au-dessus du mendiant; et l’on ne fut pas médiocrement étonné de voir l’ambassadeur flamand, inspection faite du drôle placé sous ses yeux, frapper amicalement sur cette épaule couverte de haillons. Le mendiant se retourna ; il y eut surprise, reconnaissance, épanouissement des deux visages, etc. ; puis, sans se soucier le moins du monde des spectateurs, le chaussetier et le malingreux se mirent à causer à voix basse, en se tenant les mains dans les mains, tandis que les guenilles de Clopin Trouillefou étalées sur le drap d’or de l’estrade faisaient l’effet d’une chenille sur une orange.","The reader has perhaps not forgotten the brazen beggar who had come to cling, from the beginning of the prologue, to the fringes of the cardinal platform. The arrival of the illustrious guests had by no means made him let go, and while the prelates and ambassadors encased themselves, like real Flemish herrings, in the stalls of the tribune, he had made himself comfortable, and had bravely crossed his legs on the architrave. Insolence was rare, and no one noticed it at the first moment, attention being turned elsewhere. He, for his part, noticed nothing in the room; he nodded his head with Neapolitan carelessness, repeating from time to time in the rumor, as though out of mechanical habit: ""Charity, please! And certainly he was probably the only one in the whole audience who hadn't deigned to turn his head at Coppenole and the bailiff's argument. As luck would have it, the master hosier of Ghent, with whom the people already sympathized so keenly and on whom all eyes were fixed, came to sit in the first row of the platform above the beggar; and we were not mildly astonished to see the Flemish Ambassador, inspection made of the odd one placed before his eyes, a friendly knock on that shoulder covered with rags. The beggar turned around; there was surprise, recognition, blooming of the two faces, etc. ; then, without caring the least for the spectators, the hosier and the sickly man began to talk in low voices, holding his hands in his hands, while Clopin Trouillefou's rags spread out on the gold cloth of the house. The platform looked like a caterpillar on an orange.","The reader may perhaps recall the impudent beggar who clung to the fringes of the Cardinal’s dais at the opening of the prologue. The arrival of the distinguished guests did not cause him to relax his hold; and while prelates and ambassadors were packed as close as Dutch herrings in the seats upon the platform, he made himself quite comfortable, and coolly crossed his legs upon the architrave. Such insolence was unusual, and no one noted it at the moment, attention being fixed elsewhere. He for his part saw nothing in the hall; he swayed his head to and fro with the careless ease of a Neapolitan, repeating ever and anon amid the din, as if mechanically, “Charity, kind people!” and certainly he was the only one in the entire audience who did not deign to turn his head to listen to the altercation between Coppenole and the usher. Now, as chance would have it, the master hosier of Ghent, with whom the people already sympathized strongly, and upon whom all eyes were fixed, seated himself in the front row upon the platform, just above the beggar; and they were not a little amazed to see the Flemish ambassador, after glancing at the rascal beneath him, give him a friendly slap upon his tattered shoulder. The beggar turned; surprise, recognition, delight, were visible in both faces, then, without paying the slightest heed to the throng of spectators, the hosier and the scurvy knave fell to talking in low tones, clasping each other’s hands; while the rags of Clopin Trouillefou, displayed against the cloth of gold of the dais, produced the effect of a caterpillar upon an orange.","The reader has, probably, not forgotten the impudent beggar who had been clinging fast to the fringes of the cardinal's gallery ever since the beginning of the prologue. The arrival of the illustrious guests had by no means caused him to relax his hold, and, while the prelates and ambassadors were packing themselves into the stalls—like genuine Flemish herrings—he settled himself at his ease, and boldly crossed his legs on the architrave. The insolence of this proceeding was extraordinary, yet no one noticed it at first, the attention of all being directed elsewhere. He, on his side, perceived nothing that was going on in the hall; he wagged his head with the unconcern of a Neapolitan, repeating from time to time, amid the clamor, as from a mechanical habit, ""Charity, please!"" And, assuredly, he was, out of all those present, the only one who had not deigned to turn his head at the altercation between Coppenole and the usher. Now, chance ordained that the master hosier of Ghent, with whom the people were already in lively sympathy, and upon whom all eyes were riveted—should come and seat himself in the front row of the gallery, directly above the mendicant; and people were not a little amazed to see the Flemish ambassador, on concluding his inspection of the knave thus placed beneath his eyes, bestow a friendly tap on that ragged shoulder. The beggar turned round; there was surprise, recognition, a lighting up of the two countenances, and so forth; then, without paying the slightest heed in the world to the spectators, the hosier and the wretched being began to converse in a low tone, holding each other's hands, in the meantime, while the rags of Clopin Trouillefou, spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dais, produced the effect of a caterpillar on an orange."

"Les grimaces commencèrent. La première figure qui apparut à la lucarne, avec des paupières retournées au rouge, une bouche ouverte en gueule et un front plissé comme nos bottes à la hussarde de l’empire, fit éclater un rire tellement inextinguible qu’Homère eût pris tous ces manants pour des dieux. Cependant la grand’salle n’était rien moins qu’un Olympe, et le pauvre Jupiter de Gringoire le savait mieux que personne. Une seconde, une troisième grimace succédèrent, puis une autre, puis une autre, et toujours les rires et les trépignements de joie redoublaient. Il y avait dans ce spectacle je ne sais quel vertige particulier, je ne sais quelle puissance d’enivrement et de fascination dont il serait difficile de donner une idée au lecteur de nos jours et de nos salons. Qu’on se figure une série de visages présentant successivement toutes les formes géométriques, depuis le triangle jusqu’au trapèze, depuis le cône jusqu’au polyèdre ; toutes les expressions humaines, depuis la colère jusqu’à la luxure; tous les âges, depuis les rides du nouveau-né jusqu’aux rides de la vieille moribonde ; toutes les fantasmagories religieuses, depuis Faune jusqu’à Belzébuth ; tous les profils animaux, depuis la gueule jusqu’au bec, depuis la hure jusqu’au museau. Qu’on se représente tous les mascarons du Pont-Neuf, ces cauchemars pétrifiés sous la main de Germain Pilon, prenant vie et souffle, et venant tour à tour vous regarder en face avec des yeux ardents ; tous les masques du carnaval de Venise se succédant à votre lorgnette ; en un mot, un kaléidoscope humain.","The grimaces began. The first figure that appeared at the window, with eyelids turned red, an open mouthed mouth and a forehead wrinkled like our boots in the hussar of the empire, made burst out a laugh so inextinguishable that Homer would have taken all these peasants. for gods. However, the main hall was nothing less than an Olympus, and poor Jupiter de Gringoire knew that better than anyone. A second, a third grimace followed, then another, then another, and still the laughter and the stamps of joy redoubled. There was in this spectacle I do not know what particular vertigo, I do not know what power of intoxication and fascination which it would be difficult to give the reader an idea in our days and in our living rooms. Imagine a series of faces successively presenting all the geometric shapes, from the triangle to the trapezoid, from the cone to the polyhedron; all human expressions, from anger to lust; all ages, from the wrinkles of the newborn to the wrinkles of the dying old woman; all religious phantasmagoria, from Faun to Beelzebub; all animal profiles, from mouth to beak, from head to muzzle. Imagine all the mascarons of Pont-Neuf, those petrified nightmares under the hand of Germain Pilon, coming to life and breathing, and coming in turn to look you in the face with ardent eyes; all the masks of the Venice carnival following one another on your spyglass; in short, a human kaleidoscope.","The grimaces began.

And yet, the great hall was anything but an Olympus, and Gringoire’s poor Jupiter knew this better than any one. A second, a third wry face fol- 46 lowed, then another, and another; and still the shouts of laughter and stamps of delight increased.

Then, if your view ran along the bank, from east to west, from the Tournelle to the Tour de Nesle, there was a long cordon of houses, with carved beams, stained–glass windows, each story projecting over that beneath it, an interminable zigzag of bourgeois gables, frequently interrupted by the mouth of a street, and from time to time also by the front or angle of a huge stone mansion, planted at its ease, with courts and gardens, wings and detached buildings, amid this populace of crowded and narrow houses, like a grand gentleman among a throng of rustics. There were five or six of these mansions on the quay, from the house of Lorraine, which shared with the Bernardins the grand enclosure adjoining the Tournelle, to the Hôtel de Nesle, whose principal tower ended Paris, and whose pointed roofs were in a position, during three months of the year, to encroach, with their black triangles, upon the scarlet disk of the setting sun."

"Depuis la matinée du pilori, les voisins de Notre-Dame avaient cru remarquer que l’ardeur carillonneuse de Quasimodo s’était fort refroidie. Auparavant c’étaient des sonneries à tout propos, de longues aubades qui duraient de prime à complies, des volées de beffroi pour une grand’messe, de riches gammes promenées sur les clochettes pour un mariage, pour un baptême, et s’entremêlant dans l’air comme une broderie de toutes sortes de sons charmants. La vieille église, toute vibrante et toute sonore, était dans une perpétuelle joie de cloches. On y sentait sans cesse la présence d’un esprit de bruit et de caprice qui chantait par toutes ces bouches de cuivre. Maintenant cet esprit semblait avoir disparu ; la cathédrale paraissait morne et gardait volontiers le silence. Les fêtes et les enterrements avaient leur simple sonnerie, sèche et nue, ce que le rituel exigeait, rien de plus. Du double bruit que fait une église, l’orgue au dedans, la cloche au dehors, il ne restait que l’orgue. On eût dit qu’il n’y avait plus de musicien dans les clochers. Quasimodo y était toujours pourtant. Que s’était-il donc passé en lui? Était-ce que la honte et le désespoir du pilori duraient encore au fond de son cœur, que les coups de fouet du tourmenteur se répercutaient sans fin dans son âme, et que la tristesse d’un pareil traitement avait tout éteint chez lui, jusqu’à sa passion pour les cloches ? ou bien, était-ce que Marie avait une rivale dans le cœur du sonneur de Notre-Dame, et que la grosse cloche et ses quatorze sœurs étaient négligées pour quelque chose de plus aimable et de plus beau ?","Since the morning of the pillory, the neighbors of Notre-Dame had thought they had noticed that Quasimodo's bellowing ardor had cooled off considerably. Previously they were ringtones for any purpose, long aubades which lasted from premium to compline, flights of belfries for a high mass, rich scales carried on the bells for a wedding, for a baptism, and intermixing in looks like an embroidery of all kinds of charming sounds. The old church, all vibrant and all sonorous, was in a perpetual joy of bells. One constantly felt there the presence of a spirit of noise and caprice singing through all those brass mouths. Now that spirit seemed to be gone; the cathedral seemed dreary and was happy to remain silent. Parties and funerals had their simple ringing, dry and naked, which the ritual demanded, nothing more. Of the double noise made by a church, the organ inside, the bell outside, only the organ remained. It looked like there were no more musicians in the bell towers. Quasimodo was still there, however. What had happened to him? Was it that the shame and despair of the pillory still lingered in the depths of his heart, that the tormentor's lashes reverberated endlessly in his soul, and that the sadness of such treatment had extinguished everything in him, until to his passion for bells? Or was it that Marie had a rival in the heart of the ringer of Notre Dame, and that the big bell and her fourteen sisters were neglected for something more amiable and more beautiful?","Ever since the morning when he was pilloried, the people living in the neighborhood of Notre-Dame fancied that Quasimodo’s zeal for bell-ringing had grown very cold. Up to that time he had pulled the bells upon every occasion and no occasion at all; their music sounded from prime to complines; the belfry rang a peal for high mass, or the bells sounded a merry chime for a wedding or a christening, mingling and blending in the air like a rich embroidery of all sorts of melodious sounds. The old church, resonant and re-echoing, was forever sounding its joy-bells. There seemed to be an ever-present spirit of noise and caprice, which shouted and sang through those brazen tongues. Now that spirit seemed to have vanished; the cathedral seemed somber, and given over to silence; for festivals and funerals there was still the simple tolling, dry and bare, such as the ritual required, and nothing more; of the double noise which a church sends forth, from its organ within and its bells without, only the organ remained. It seemed as if there were no musician left in the belfry towers. And yet, Quasimodo was still there. What had happened to him? Did the shame and despair felt upon the pillory still rankle within him; did the executioner’s lashes still tingle in his soul; and had the agony caused by such treatment killed all emotion within him, even his passion for the bells? Or had big Marie a rival in the heart of the ringer of Notre-Dame, and were the big bell and her fourteen sisters neglected for a fairer and more attractive object?","After the morning in the pillory, the neighbors of Notre–Dame thought they noticed that Quasimodo's ardor for ringing had grown cool. Formerly, there had been peals for every occasion, long morning serenades, which lasted from prime to compline; peals from the belfry for a high mass, rich scales drawn over the smaller bells for a wedding, for a christening, and mingling in the air like a rich embroidery of all sorts of charming sounds. The old church, all vibrating and sonorous, was in a perpetual joy of bells. One was constantly conscious of the presence of a spirit of noise and caprice, who sang through all those mouths of brass. Now that spirit seemed to have departed; the cathedral seemed gloomy, and gladly remained silent; festivals and funerals had the simple peal, dry and bare, demanded by the ritual, nothing more. Of the double noise which constitutes a church, the organ within, the bell without, the organ alone remained. One would have said that there was no longer a musician in the belfry. Quasimodo was always there, nevertheless; what, then, had happened to him? Was it that the shame and despair of the pillory still lingered in the bottom of his heart, that the lashes of his tormentor's whip reverberated unendingly in his soul, and that the sadness of such treatment had wholly extinguished in him even his passion for the bells? or was it that Marie had a rival in the heart of the bellringer of Notre–Dame, and that the great bell and her fourteen sisters were neglected for something more amiable and more beautiful?"
"Et elle voulut tendre vers lui ses bras tremblants d’amour et de ravissement, mais ils étaient attachés. Alors elle vit le capitaine froncer le sourcil, une belle jeune fille qui s’appuyait sur lui le regarder avec une lèvre dédaigneuse et des yeux irrités, puis Phœbus prononça quelques mots qui ne vinrent pas jusqu’à elle, et tous deux s’éclipsèrent précipitamment derrière le vitrail du balcon qui se referma.","And she wanted to stretch out her arms, trembling with love and delight, to him, but they were tied.

"Quasimodo avait repris, en apparence du moins, son impassibilité première. Il avait essayé d’abord sourdement et sans grande secousse extérieure de rompre ses liens. On avait vu son œil s’allumer, ses muscles se roidir, ses membres se ramasser, et les courroies et les chaînettes se tendre. L'effort était puissant, prodigieux, désespéré ; mais les vieilles gênes de la prévôté résistèrent. Elles craquèrent, et voilà tout. Quasimodo retomba épuisé. La stupeur fit place sur ses traits à un sentiment d’amer et profond découragement. Il ferma son œil unique, laissa tomber sa tête sur sa poitrine et fit le mort.","Quasimodo had resumed, at least in appearance, his original impassibility. He had first tried silently and without much external shock to break his bonds. Her eye had been seen to light up, her muscles to stiffen, her limbs to curl up, and the straps and chains to tighten. The effort was powerful, prodigious, desperate; but the provost's old genes resisted. They cracked, and that was all. Quasimodo fell back exhausted. Astonishment gave way to a feeling of bitter and deep discouragement. He closed his one eye, let his head fall on his chest, and played dead.","Quasimodo had resumed, apparently at least, his former impassivity.

Surprise gave way, upon his features, to a look of bitter and profound dejection. He closed his single eye, dropped his head upon his breast, and feigned death.","Quasimodo had resumed, to all appearance, his first imperturbability.

"La bohémienne dansait.

"À la bastille Saint-Antoine, au Palais de Justice de Paris, au Louvre, ces édifices souterrains étaient des prisons. Les étages de ces prisons, en s’enfonçant dans le sol, allaient se rétrécissant et s'assombrissant. C'étaient autant de zones où s’échelonnaient les nuances de l’horreur. Dante n’a rien pu trouver de mieux pour son enfer. Ces entonnoirs de cachots aboutissaient d’ordinaire à un cul de basse-fosse à fond de cuve où Dante a mis Satan, où la société mettait le condamné à mort. Une fois une misérable existence enterrée là, adieu le jour, l’air, la vie, ogni speranza. Elle n’en sortait que pour le gibet ou le bûcher. Quelquefois elle y pourrissait. La justice humaine appelait cela oublier. Entre les hommes et lui, le condamné sentait peser sur sa tête un entassement de pierres et de geôliers, et la prison tout entière, la massive bastille n’était plus qu’une énorme serrure compliquée qui le cadenassait hors du monde vivant.","At the Bastille Saint-Antoine, at the Palais de Justice in Paris, at the Louvre, these underground buildings were prisons. The floors of these prisons, sinking into the ground, would shrink and darken. These were all areas of the shades of horror. Dante couldn't find anything better for his hell. These dungeon funnels usually ended in a bottom pit where Dante put Satan, where society put the condemned man to death. With a miserable existence buried there, farewell to the day, the air, the life, ogni speranza. She only came out for the gallows or the stake. Sometimes it rotted there. Human justice called it forgetting. Between the men and himself, the condemned man felt a heap of stones and jailers weigh on his head, and the entire prison, the massive bastille, was no more than a huge complicated lock that padlocked him out of the living world.","In the Bastille Saint-Antoine, the Palace of Justice at Paris, and the Louvre, these underground structures were prisons. The various stories of these prisons as they sank deeper into the ground became darker and more contracted. They formed so many zones presenting various degrees of horror. Dante could have found no better image of his hell. These tunnel-like dungeons usually ended in a deep hole like a tub, such as Dante chose for the abode of Satan, and where society placed those condemned to death. When once any poor wretch was buried there, he bade farewell to light, air, life, all hope; he never left it save for the gallows or the stake. Sometimes he lay there and rotted. Human justice styled this “forgetting.” Between mankind and himself the prisoner felt that a mountain of stones and jailers weighed him down; and the entire prison, the massive fortress, became but a huge complicated lock which shut him off from the living world.","At the fortress of Saint–Antoine, at the Palais de Justice of Paris, at the Louvre, these subterranean edifices were prisons.

These tunnels of cells usually terminated in a sack of a lowest dungeon, with a vat–like bottom, where Dante placed Satan, where society placed those condemned to death.

"Quelque chose d’assez semblable à la cellule de Faust s’offrit à la vue de Jehan quand il eut hasardé sa tête par la porte entrebâillée. C'était de même un réduit sombre et à peine éclairé. Il y avait aussi un grand fauteuil et une grande table, des compas, des alambics, des squelettes d’animaux pendus au plafond, une sphère roulant sur le pavé, des hippocéphales pêle-mêle avec des bocaux où tremblaient des feuilles d’or, des têtes de mort posées sur des vélins bigarrés de figures et de caractères, de gros manuscrits empilés tout ouverts sans pitié pour les angles cassants du parchemin, enfin, toutes les ordures de la science, et partout, sur ce fouillis, de la poussière et des toiles d’araignée; mais il n’y avait point de cercle de lettres lumineuses, point de docteur en extase contemplant la flamboyante vision comme l’aigle regarde son soleil.","Something quite similar to Faust's cell presented itself to Jehan's sight when he ventured his head through the half-open door.

"Cependant dans la taverne même, le vin et le jeu étaient une si puissante diversion aux idées qui occupaient ce soir-là la truanderie, qu’il eût été difficile de deviner aux propos des buveurs de quoi il s’agissait.

"C'est ainsi que l’art merveilleux du moyen âge a été traité presque en tout pays, surtout en France. On peut distinguer sur sa ruine trois sortes de lésions qui toutes trois l’entament à différentes profondeurs : le temps d’abord, qui a insensiblement ébréché çà et là et rouillé partout sa surface ; ensuite, les révolutions politiques et religieuses, lesquelles, aveugles et colères de leur nature, se sont ruées en tumulte sur lui, ont déchiré son riche habillement de sculptures et de ciselures, crevé ses rosaces, brisé ses colliers d’arabesques et de figurines, arraché ses statues, tantôt pour leur mitre, tantôt pour leur couronne ; enfin, les modes, de plus en plus grotesques et sottes, qui depuis les anarchiques et splendides déviations de la Renaissance, se sont succédé dans la décadence nécessaire de l’architecture. Les modes ont fait plus de mal que les révolutions. Elles ont tranché dans le vif, elles ont attaqué la charpente osseuse de l’art, elles ont coupé, taillé, désorganisé, tué l’édifice, dans la forme comme dans le symbole, dans sa logique comme dans sa beauté. Et puis, elles ont refait ; prétention que n’avaient eue du moins ni le temps, ni les révolutions. Elles ont effrontément ajusté, de par le bon go t, sur les blessures de l’architecture gothique, leurs misérables colifichets d’un jour, leurs rubans de marbre, leurs pompons de métal, véritable lèpre d’oves, de volutes, d’entournements, de draperies, de guirlandes, de franges, de flammes de pierre, de nuages de bronze, d’amours replets, de chérubins bouffis, qui commence à dévorer la face de l’art dans l’oratoire de Catherine de Médicis, et le fait expirer, deux siècles après, tourmenté et grimaçant, dans le boudoir de la Dubarry.","This is how the marvelous art of the Middle Ages was treated in almost all countries, especially in France. We can distinguish three kinds of lesions on its ruin which all three begin at different depths: first, which has imperceptibly chipped here and there and rusted its surface everywhere; then, the political and religious revolutions, which, blind and angry of their nature, rushed in tumult on him, tore his rich clothing of sculptures and carvings, punctured his rosettes, broke his necklaces of arabesques and figurines, torn off his statues, sometimes for their miter, sometimes for their crown; finally, the increasingly grotesque and foolish fashions which, since the anarchic and splendid deviations of the Renaissance, have followed one another in the necessary decadence of architecture. Fashions have done more harm than revolutions. They cut through life, they attacked the bone structure of art, they cut, carved, disorganized, killed the edifice, in form as in symbol, in its logic as in its beauty. And then they did it again; a claim that at least neither the time nor the revolutions had. They have brazenly adjusted, by good taste, on the wounds of Gothic architecture, their miserable trinkets for a day, their marble ribbons, their metal pompoms, veritable leprosy of ovals, volutes, entournements, draperies, garlands, fringes, stone flames, bronze clouds, plump loves, puffy cherubs, which begins to devour the face of art in the oratory of Catherine de Medici, and makes him expire, two centuries later, tormented and grimacing, in the boudoir of Dubarry.","Thus was the marvelous art of the Middle Ages treated in almost every land, but particularly in France. We find three sorts of injury upon its ruins, these three marring it to different depths: first, Time, which has made insensible breaches here and there, mildewed and rusted the surface everywhere; then, political and religious revolutions, which, blind and fierce by nature, fell furiously upon it, rent its rich array of sculpture and carving, shivered its rose-windows, shattered its necklaces of arabesques and quaint figures, tore down its statues,—sometimes because of their miter, sometimes because of their crown; lastly, changing fashion, ever more grotesque and absurd, from the anarchic and splendid deviations of the Renaissance down to the necessary decline of architecture. Fashion did more harm than revolutions. Fashion cut into the living flesh, attacked the very skeleton and framework of art; it chopped and hewed, dismembered, slew the edifice, in its form as well as in its symbolism, in its logic no less than in its beauty. But fashion restored,—a thing which neither time nor revolution ever pretended to do. Fashion, on the plea of “good taste,” impudently adapted to the wounds of Gothic architecture the paltry knick-knacks of a day,—marble ribbons, metallic plumes, a veritable leprosy of egg-shaped mouldings, of volutes, wreaths, draperies, spirals, fringes, stone flames, bronze clouds, lusty cupids, and bloated cherubs, which began to ravage the face of art in the oratory of Catherine de Médicis, and destroyed it, two centuries later, tortured and distorted, in the boudoir of Mme. Dubarry.","'Tis thus that the marvellous art of the Middle Ages has been treated in nearly every country, especially in France. One can distinguish on its ruins three sorts of lesions, all three of which cut into it at different depths; first, time, which has insensibly notched its surface here and there, and gnawed it everywhere; next, political and religious revolution, which, blind and wrathful by nature, have flung themselves tumultuously upon it, torn its rich garment of carving and sculpture, burst its rose windows, broken its necklace of arabesques and tiny figures, torn out its statues, sometimes because of their mitres, sometimes because of their crowns; lastly, fashions, even more grotesque and foolish, which, since the anarchical and splendid deviations of the Renaissance, have followed each other in the necessary decadence of architecture. Fashions have wrought more harm than revolutions. They have cut to the quick; they have attacked the very bone and framework of art; they have cut, slashed, disorganized, killed the edifice, in form as in the symbol, in its consistency as well as in its beauty. And then they have made it over; a presumption of which neither time nor revolutions at least have been guilty. They have audaciously adjusted, in the name of ""good taste,"" upon the wounds of gothic architecture, their miserable gewgaws of a day, their ribbons of marble, their pompons of metal, a veritable leprosy of egg–shaped ornaments, volutes, whorls, draperies, garlands, fringes, stone flames, bronze clouds, pudgy cupids, chubby–cheeked cherubim, which begin to devour the face of art in the oratory of Catherine de Medicis, and cause it to expire, two centuries later, tortured and grimacing, in the boudoir of the Dubarry."

C'étaient, derrière la Bastille, vingt masures pelotonnées autour des curieuses sculptures de la Croix-Faubin et des arcs-boutants de l’abbaye Saint-Antoine des Champs; puis Popincourt, perdu dans les blés ; puis la Courtille, joyeux village de cabarets ; le bourg Saint-Laurent avec son église dont le clocher de loin semblait s’ajouter aux tours pointues de la Porte Saint-Martin ; le faubourg Saint-Denis avec le vaste enclos de Saint-Ladre ; hors de la Porte Montmartre, la Grange-Batelière ceinte de murailles blanches ; derrière elle, avec ses pentes de craie, Montmartre qui avait alors presque autant d’églises que de moulins, et qui n’a gardé que les moulins, car la société ne demande plus maintenant que le pain du corps. Enfin, au delà du Louvre on voyait s’allonger dans les prés le faubourg Saint-Honoré, déjà fort considérable alors, et verdoyer la Petite-Bretagne, et se dérouler le Marché-aux-Pourceaux, au centre duquel s’arrondissait l’horrible fourneau à bouillir les faux-monnayeurs. Entre la Courtille et Saint-Laurent votre œil avait déjà remarqué au couronnement d’une hauteur accroupie sur des plaines désertes une espèce d’édifice qui ressemblait de loin à une colonnade en ruine debout sur un soubassement déchaussé. Ce n’était ni un Parthénon, ni un temple de Jupiter Olympien. C'était Montfaucon.","Beyond the walls, a few suburbs crowded at the gates, but fewer and more scattered than those of the University. Behind the Bastille, there were twenty hovels curled up around the curious sculptures of the Croix-Faubin and the flying buttresses of the Saint-Antoine des Champs abbey; then Popincourt, lost in the wheat; then La Courtille, a happy village of cabarets; the village of Saint-Laurent with its church, the steeple of which from a distance seemed to add to the pointed towers of the Porte Saint-Martin; the Faubourg Saint-Denis with the vast enclosure of Saint-Ladre; outside the Porte Montmartre, the Grange-Batelière surrounded by white walls; behind it, with its chalk slopes, Montmartre, which then had almost as many churches as there were mills, and which has kept only the mills, for society now only asks for the bread of the body. Finally, beyond the Louvre we could see the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, already very considerable at the time, stretching out in the meadows, and greening Little Britain, and unfolding the Marché-aux-Pourceaux, in the center of which rounded off the horrible cooking stove for counterfeiters. Between Courtille and Saint-Laurent your eye had already noticed at the crowning of a height crouching over deserted plains a sort of edifice which from a distance resembled a ruined colonnade standing on a bare plinth. It was neither a Parthenon nor a temple of Olympian Jupiter. It was Montfaucon.","Outside the walls, some few suburbs crowded to the gates; but there were not so many houses, nor were they so close together, as in the University quarter. There were, behind the Bastille, some twenty huts, built close around the Cross of Faubin with its curious carvings, and the Abbey of Saint-Antoine des Champs with its buttresses; then came Popincourt, hidden in wheat-fields; then Courtille, a jolly village of taverns; the borough of Saint-Laurent, with its church, whose steeple at a distance seemed to be a part of the pointed towers of the Porte Saint-Martin; the Faubourg Saint-Denis, with the vast enclosure of Saint-Ladre; outside the Porte Montmartre, Grange-Batelière, surrounded by white walls; behind it, with its chalky slopes, Montmartre, which then held almost as many churches as windmills, and which has kept only the mills,—for society now prefers material to spiritual bread. Lastly, beyond the Louvre the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, even then of considerable extent, stretched away into the fields, and Little Britain looked green in the distance, and the Pig-market was plainly visible, in the midst of it the horrible caldron for boiling alive coiners of counterfeit money. Between Courtille and Saint-Laurent the eye noted, on the summit of a height situated in the midst of bare plains, a sort of structure looking from a distance like a ruined colonnade standing upon bare foundations. It was neither a Parthenon nor a temple to Olympian Jove; it was Montfaucon. ay","Beyond the walls, several suburban villages pressed close about the gates, but less numerous and more scattered than those of the University. Behind the Bastille there were twenty hovels clustered round the curious sculptures of the Croix–Faubin and the flying buttresses of the Abbey of Saint–Antoine des Champs; then Popincourt, lost amid wheat fields; then la Courtille, a merry village of wine–shops; the hamlet of Saint–Laurent with its church whose bell tower, from afar, seemed to add itself to the pointed towers of the Porte Saint–Martin; the Faubourg Saint–Denis, with the vast enclosure of Saint–Ladre; beyond the Montmartre Gate, the Grange–Batelière, encircled with white walls; behind it, with its chalky slopes, Montmartre, which had then almost as many churches as windmills, and which has kept only the windmills, for society no longer demands anything but bread for the body. Lastly, beyond the Louvre, the Faubourg Saint–Honoré, already considerable at that time, could be seen stretching away into the fields, and Petit–Bretagne gleaming green, and the Marché aux Pourceaux spreading abroad, in whose centre swelled the horrible apparatus used for boiling counterfeiters. Between la Courtille and Saint–Laurent, your eye had already noticed, on the summit of an eminence crouching amid desert plains, a sort of edifice which resembled from a distance a ruined colonnade, mounted upon a basement with its foundation laid bare.

Elle avait soin de s’habiller le matin dans l’angle de sa logette, de peur que quelque habitant des greniers voisins ne la vît par la lucarne.","So each rising sun found her more peaceful, breathing better, less pale. As her wounds closed, her grace and beauty bloomed again on her face, but more collected and rested. His old character came back to him too, something even of his gaiety, his pretty pout, his love for his goat, his taste for singing, his modesty. She was careful to dress in the corner of her cubicle in the morning, lest some inhabitant of the neighboring attics might see her through the skylight.","Thus, each day’s rising sun found her more composed, breathing better, less pale. As her inward wounds were healed, her grace and beauty bloomed again, although she was more reserved and quiet. Her former disposition also returned,—something even of her gaiety, her pretty pout, her love for her goat, her passion for singing, and her modesty. She was careful to dress herself every morning in the corner of her cell, lest the inmate of some neighboring garret should spy her through the window.","Thus every sunrise found her more calm, breathing better, less pale. In proportion as her inward wounds closed, her grace and beauty blossomed once more on her countenance, but more thoughtful, more reposeful. Her former character also returned to her, somewhat even of her gayety, her pretty pout, her love for her goat, her love for singing, her modesty. She took care to dress herself in the morning in the corner of her cell for fear some inhabitants of the neighboring attics might see her through the window."
"– Il y a apparence, répondit le compère, qui balbutiait, encore tout étourdi du brusque et inexplicable changement qui venait de s’opérer dans les pensées du roi.","""It seems,"" replied the confederate, stammering, still dazed by the sudden and inexplicable change which had just taken place in the king's thoughts.","“It looks that way,” said the compere, who still stammered and hesitated, utterly astounded by the sudden and inexplicable change which had been wrought in the king’s sentiments.","""So it appears,"" said the gossip, who still stammered, utterly astounded by the abrupt and inexplicable change which had just taken place in the king's thoughts."
"Épuisée, elle retomba contre la muraille, et alors la crainte de la mort s’empara d’elle. Elle songea à la beauté de la vie, à la jeunesse, à la vue du ciel, aux aspects de la nature, à l’amour, à Phœbus, à tout ce qui s’enfuyait et à tout ce qui s’approchait, au prêtre qui la dénonçait, au bourreau qui allait venir, au gibet qui était là. Alors elle sentit l’épouvante lui monter jusque dans les racines des cheveux, et elle entendit le rire lugubre de la recluse qui lui disait tout bas: – Hah! hah! hah! tu vas être pendue !","Exhausted, she fell back against the wall, and then the fear of death seized her. She thought of the beauty of life, of youth, of the sight of the sky, of the aspects of nature, of love, of Phoebus, of all that fled and all that approached, the priest who denounced her, to the executioner who was about to come, to the gibbet who was there. Then she felt terror rise to the roots of her hair, and she heard the lugubrious laugh of the recluse who whispered to her: – Hah! haha! haha! you will be hanged!","Exhausted, she sank back, and the fear of death took possession of her. She thought of the beauty of life, of youth, of the sight of the sky, of the various aspects of Nature, of the love of Phœbus, of all that was behind her and of all that was rapidly coming upon her, of the priest who would denounce her, of the hangman who would soon arrive, of the gallows which was already there. Then terror rose to the very roots of her hair, and she heard the melancholy laugh of the recluse, as she whispered in her ear,— “Ha! ha! ha! You shall be hanged!”","She fell back against the wall exhausted, and then the fear of death took possession of her. She thought of the beauty of life, of youth, of the view of heaven, the aspects of nature, of her love for Phoebus, of all that was vanishing and all that was approaching, of the priest who was denouncing her, of the headsman who was to come, of the gallows which was there. Then she felt terror mount to the very roots of her hair and she heard the mocking laugh of the recluse, saying to her in a very low tone: ""Hah! hah! hah! you are going to be hanged!"""
"On ne saurait se faire une idée de sa joie les jours de grande volée. Au moment où l’archidiacre l’avait lâché et lui avait dit : Allez ! il montait la vis du clocher plus vite qu’un autre ne l’eût descendue. Il entrait tout essoufflé dans la chambre aérienne de la grosse cloche ; il la considérait un moment avec recueillement et amour ; puis il lui adressait doucement la parole, il la flattait de la main, comme un bon cheval qui va faire une longue course. Il la plaignait de la peine qu’elle allait avoir. Après ces premières caresses, il criait à ses aides, placés à l’étage inférieur de la tour, de commencer. Ceux-ci se pendaient aux câbles, le cabestan criait, et l’énorme capsule de métal s’ébranlait lentement. Quasimodo, palpitant, la suivait du regard. Le premier choc du battant et de la paroi d’airain faisait frissonner la charpente sur laquelle il était monté. Quasimodo vibrait avec la cloche. Vah ! criait-il avec un éclat de rire insensé. Cependant le mouvement du bourdon s’accélérait, et à mesure qu’il parcourait un angle plus ouvert, l’œil de Quasimodo s’ouvrait aussi de plus en plus phosphorique et flamboyant. Enfin la grande volée commençait, toute la tour tremblait, charpentes, plombs, pierres de taille, tout grondait à la fois, depuis les pilotis de la fondation jusqu’aux trèfles du couronnement. Quasimodo alors bouillait à grosse écume ; il allait, venait ; il tremblait avec la tour de la tête aux pieds. La cloche, déchaînée et furieuse, présentait alternativement aux deux parois de la tour sa gueule de bronze d’où s’échappait ce souffle de tempête qu’on entend à quatre lieues. Quasimodo se plaçait devant cette gueule ouverte ; il s’accroupissait, se relevait avec les retours de la cloche, aspirait ce souffle renversant, regardait tour à tour la place profonde qui fourmillait à deux cents pieds au-dessous de lui et l’énorme langue de cuivre qui venait de seconde en seconde lui hurler dans l’oreille. C'était la seule parole qu’il entendît, le seul son qui troublât pour lui le silence universel. Il s’y dilatait comme un oiseau au soleil. Tout à coup la frénésie de la cloche le gagnait ; son regard devenait extraordinaire ; il attendait le bourdon au passage, comme l’araignée attend la mouche, et se jetait brusquement sur lui à corps perdu. Alors, suspendu sur l’abîme, lancé dans le balancement formidable de la cloche, il saisissait le monstre d’airain aux oreillettes, l’étreignait de ses deux genoux, l’éperonnait de ses deux talons, et redoublait de tout le choc et de tout le poids de son corps la furie de la volée. Cependant la tour vacillait ; lui, criait et grinçait des dents, ses cheveux roux se hérissaient, sa poitrine faisait le bruit d’un soufflet de forge, son œil jetait des flammes, la cloche monstrueuse hennissait toute haletante sous lui, et alors ce n’était plus ni le bourdon de Notre-Dame ni Quasimodo, c’était un rêve, un tourbillon, une tempête ; le vertige à cheval sur le bruit; un esprit cramponné à une croupe volante ; un étrange centaure moitié homme, moitié cloche ; une espèce d’Astolphe horrible emporté sur un prodigieux hippogriffe de bronze vivant.","One could not form an idea of his joy on the days of great flight. The moment the archdeacon had let go and said to him: Come on! he was climbing the steeple screw faster than anyone else would have lowered it. He entered the air chamber of the big bell breathlessly; he looked at her for a moment with recollection and love; then he spoke to her gently, he flattered her with his hand, like a good horse about to make a long race. He pitied her for the pain she was going to have. After those first strokes, he shouted for his helpers, placed on the lower level of the tower, to begin. These hung from the cables, the capstan screamed, and the huge metal capsule shook slowly. Quasimodo, throbbing, followed her with his eyes. The first shock of the clapper and the brass wall made the frame on which it was mounted shiver. Quasimodo vibrated with the bell. Vah! he cried with a mad burst of laughter. However, the movement of the drone accelerated, and as it traversed a more open angle, Quasimodo's eye also opened more and more phosphoric and flaming. Finally the great flight began, the whole tower was shaking, frames, sinkers, freestone, everything rumbled at the same time, from the pilings of the foundation to the clovers of the crown. Quasimodo then boiled in a heavy foam; he was going, coming; he was shaking with the tower from head to toe. The bell, unleashed and furious, presented alternately to the two walls of the tower its bronze jaw from which escaped that stormy breath that can be heard from four leagues away. Quasimodo placed himself in front of this open mouth; he crouched down, got up with the returns of the bell, inhaled that breathtaking breath, looked in turn at the deep place which swarmed two hundred feet below him and the enormous brass tongue which came from second to second yell in his ear. It was the only word he heard, the only sound that disturbed the universal silence for him. He dilated there like a bird in the sun. Suddenly the frenzy of the bell overtook him; his gaze became extraordinary; he waited for the bumblebee as it passed, as the spider waits for the fly, and suddenly threw itself at it headlong. Then, suspended over the abyss, launched into the formidable swing of the bell, he seized the brass monster by the ear cups, embraced it with both knees, spurred it with both heels, and redoubled all the shock and with all the weight of his body the fury of the volley. However, the tower wavered; him, cried and gnashed his teeth, his red hair stood on end, his chest made the noise of a forge bellows, his eye threw flames, the monstrous bell neighed all panting beneath him, and then it was no longer the bourdon de Notre-Dame ni Quasimodo, it was a dream, a whirlwind, a storm; vertigo straddling noise; a mind clinging to a flying rump; a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a kind of horrible Astolphus carried over a prodigious living bronze hippogriff.","It is impossible to give any idea of his joy on those days when full peals were rung. When the archdeacon dismissed him with the word “Go,” he ran up the winding staircase more rapidly than any one else could have gone down. He reached the aerial chamber of the big bell, breathless; he gazed at it an instant with love and devotion, then spoke to it gently, and patted it, as you would a good horse about to take a long journey. He condoled with it on the hard work before it. After these initiatory caresses he called to his assistants, stationed on a lower story of the tower, to begin. They then hung upon the ropes, the windlass creaked, and the enormous mass of metal moved slowly. Quasimodo, panting with excitement, followed it with his eye. The first stroke of the clapper upon its brazen wall made the beam on which he stood quiver. Quasimodo vibrated with the bell. “Here we go! There we go!” he shouted with a mad burst of laughter. But the motion of the great bell grew faster and faster, and as it traversed an ever-increasing space, his eye grew bigger and bigger, more and more glittering and phosphorescent. At last the full peal began; the whole tower shook: beams, leads, broad stones, all rumbled together, from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils at the top. Then Quasimodo’s rapture knew no bounds: he came and went; he trembled and shook from head to foot with the tower. The bell, let loose, and frantic with liberty, turned its jaws of bronze to either wall of the tower in turn,—jaws from which issued that whirlwind whose roar men heard for four leagues around. Quasimodo placed himself before those gaping jaws! he rose and fell with the swaying of the bell, inhaled its tremendous breath, gazed now at the abyss swarming with people like ants, two hundred feet below him, and now at the huge copper clapper which from second to second bellowed in his ear. That was the only speech which he could hear, the only sound that broke the universal silence reigning around him. He basked in it as a bird in the sunshine. All at once the frenzy of the bell seized him; his look became strange; he waited for the passing of the bell as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself headlong upon it. Then, suspended above the gulf, launched upon the tremendous vibration of the bell, he grasped the brazen monster by its ears, clasped it with his knees, spurred it with his heels, doubling the fury of the peal with the whole force and weight of his body. As the tower shook, he shouted and gnashed his teeth, his red hair stood erect, his chest labored like a blacksmith’s bellows, his eye flashed fire, the monstrous steed neighed and panted under him; and then the big bell of Notre-Dame and Quasimodo ceased to exist: they became a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest; vertigo astride of uproar; a spirit clinging to a winged crupper; a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrid Astolpho, borne aloft by a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze.8","No idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was sounded. At the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him, and said, ""Go!"" he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any one else could have descended it. He entered perfectly breathless into the aerial chamber of the great bell; he gazed at her a moment, devoutly and lovingly; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his hand, like a good horse, which is about to set out on a long journey. He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer. After these first caresses, he shouted to his assistants, placed in the lower story of the tower, to begin. They grasped the ropes, the wheel creaked, the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion. Quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled. The first shock of the clapper and the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver. Quasimodo vibrated with the bell. ""Vah!"" he cried, with a senseless burst of laughter. However, the movement of the bass was accelerated, and, in proportion as it described a wider angle, Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely, phosphoric and flaming. At length the grand peal began; the whole tower trembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit. Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with the tower. The bell, furious, running riot, presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat, whence escaped that tempestuous breath, which is audible leagues away. Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed by turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet below him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after second, to howl in his ear. It was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke for him the universal silence. He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun. All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his look became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed, as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly upon it, with might and main. Then, suspended above the abyss, borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen monster by the ear–laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on with his heels, and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body. Meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth, his red hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a bellows, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting, beneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre–Dame nor Quasimodo : it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted astride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper, a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible Astolphus, borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze."

"1 Nous avons vu avec une douleur mêlée d’indignation qu’on songeait à agrandir, à refondre, à remanier, c’est-à-dire à détruire cet admirable palais. Les architectes de nos jours ont la main trop lourde pour toucher à ces délicates œuvres de la Renaissance. Nous espérons toujours qu’ils ne l’oseront pas. D’ailleurs, cette démolition des Tuileries maintenant ne serait pas seulement une voie de fait brutale dont rougirait un vandale ivre, ce serait un acte de trahison.

The Tuileries are no longer simply a masterpiece of sixteenth century art, it is a page in nineteenth century history. This palace is no longer for the king, but for the people.

"Vus à vol d’oiseau, ces trois bourgs, la Cité, l’Université, la Ville, présentaient chacun à l’œil un tricot inextricable de rues bizarrement brouillées. Cependant, au premier aspect, on reconnaissait que ces trois fragments de cité formaient un seul corps. On voyait tout de suite deux longues rues parallèles sans rupture, sans perturbation, presque en ligne droite, qui traversaient à la fois les trois villes d’un bout à l’autre, du midi au nord, perpendiculairement à la Seine, les liaient, les mêlaient, infusaient, versaient, transvasaient sans relâche le peuple de l’une dans les murs de l’autre, et des trois n’en faisaient qu’une. La première de ces deux rues allait de la Porte Saint-Jacques à la porte Saint-Martin ; elle s’appelait rue Saint-Jacques dans l’Université, rue de la Juiverie dans la Cité, rue Saint-Martin dans la Ville ; elle passait l’eau deux fois sous le nom de Petit-Pont et de Pont Notre-Dame. La seconde, qui s’appelait rue de la Harpe sur la rive gauche, rue de la Barillerie dans l’île, rue Saint-Denis sur la rive droite, Pont Saint-Michel sur un bras de la Seine, Pont-au-Change sur l’autre, allait de la Porte Saint-Michel dans l’Université à la Porte Saint-Denis dans la Ville. Du reste, sous tant de noms divers, ce n’étaient toujours que deux rues, mais les deux rues mères, les deux rues génératrices, les deux artères de Paris. Toutes les autres veines de la triple ville venaient y puiser où s’y dégorger.","Seen from a bird's eye view, these three towns, the City, the University, the City, each presented to the eye an inextricable knit of oddly blurred streets. However, at first glance, it was recognized that these three city fragments formed a single body. We immediately saw two long parallel streets without interruption, without disturbance, almost in a straight line, which crossed the three towns from one end to the other, from south to north, perpendicular to the Seine, linking them, mingled them, infused, poured, poured relentlessly the people of one into the walls of the other, and of the three made only one. The first of these two streets ran from the Porte Saint-Jacques to the Porte Saint-Martin; it was called rue Saint-Jacques in the University, rue de la Juiverie in the City, rue Saint-Martin in the City; it passed water twice under the names of Petit-Pont and Pont Notre-Dame. The second, which was called rue de la Harpe on the left bank, rue de la Barillerie in the island, rue Saint-Denis on the right bank, Pont Saint-Michel on an arm of the Seine, Pont-au-Change on the other, went from the Porte Saint-Michel in the University to the Porte Saint-Denis in the City. Moreover, under so many different names, they were still only two streets, but the two mother streets, the two generating streets, the two arteries of Paris. All the other veins of the triple city came to draw or to drain themselves from it.","A bird‘s-eye view of these three boroughs-the City, the University, and the Town-presented an inextricable network of streets strangely entangled. But still, even at first sight, it was apparent that these three fragments of a city formed but one body. One saw at once two long parallel streets, without break or deviation, running almost in a straight line, and traversing the three towns from end to end, from north to south, perpendicular to the Seine, connecting them, uniting them, infusing, pouring, and incessantly decanting the people of the one into the precincts of the other, and making of the three but one. One of these two streets led from the Porte Saint-Jacques to the Porte Saint-Martin; it was known as Rue Saint-Jacques in the University, Rue de la Juiverie in the City, Rue Saint-Martin in the Town; it crossed the water twice under the name of the Petit-Pont and the Pont Notre-Dame. The other, known as Rue de la Harpe on the left bank of the river, Rue de la Barillerie on the island, Rue Saint-Denis on the right bank, Pont Saint-Michel over one arm of the Seine, Pont-au-Change over the other, ran from the Porte Saint-Michel in the University to the Porte Saint-Denis in the Town. And yet, under all these various names, they were still the same two streets, the two parent streets, the two original streets, the two arteries of Paris. All the other veins of the triple town proceeded from or emptied into them.","From a bird's–eye view, these three burgs, the City, the Town, and the University, each presented to the eye an inextricable skein of eccentrically tangled streets. Nevertheless, at first sight, one recognized the fact that these three fragments formed but one body. One immediately perceived three long parallel streets, unbroken, undisturbed, traversing, almost in a straight line, all three cities, from one end to the other; from North to South, perpendicularly, to the Seine, which bound them together, mingled them, infused them in each other, poured and transfused the people incessantly, from one to the other, and made one out of the three. The first of these streets ran from the Porte Saint–Martin: it was called the Rue Saint–Jacques in the University, Rue de la Juiverie in the City, Rue Saint– Martin in the Town; it crossed the water twice, under the name of the Petit Pont and the Pont Notre–Dame. The second, which was called the Rue de la Harpe on the left bank, Rue de la Barillerié in the island, Rue Saint–Denis on the right bank, Pont Saint–Michel on one arm of the Seine, Pont au Change on the other, ran from the Porte Saint–Michel in the University, to the Porte Saint–Denis in the Town. However, under all these names, there were but two streets, parent streets, generating streets,—the two arteries of Paris. All the other veins of the triple city either derived their supply from them or emptied into them."

"Personne n’avait encore remarqué, dans la galerie des statues des rois, sculptés immédiatement au-dessus des ogives du portail, un spectateur étrange qui avait tout examiné jusqu’alors avec une telle impassibilité, avec un cou si tendu, avec un visage si difforme, que, sans son accoutrement mi-parti rouge et violet, on eût pu le prendre pour un de ces monstres de pierre par la gueule desquels se dégorgent depuis six cents ans les longues gouttières de la cathédrale. Ce spectateur n’avait rien perdu de ce qui s’était parié depuis midi devant le portail de Notre-Dame. Et dès les premiers instants, sans que personne songeât à l’observer, il avait fortement attaché à l’une des colonnettes de la galerie une grosse corde à nœuds, dont le bout allait traîner en bas sur le perron. Cela fait, il s’était mis à regarder tranquillement, et à siffler de temps en temps quand un merle passait devant lui. Tout à coup, au moment où les valets du maître des œuvres se disposaient à exécuter l’ordre flegmatique de Charmolue, il enjamba la balustrade de la galerie, saisit la corde des pieds, des genoux et des mains, puis on le vit couler sur la façade, comme une goutte de pluie qui glisse le long d’une vitre, courir vers les deux bourreaux avec la vitesse d’un chat tombé d’un toit, les terrasser sous deux poings énormes, enlever l’égyptienne d’une main, comme un enfant sa poupée, et d’un seul élan rebondir jusque dans l’église, en élevant la jeune fille au-dessus de sa tête, et en criant d’une voix formidable : Asile !","No one had yet noticed, in the gallery of the statues of kings, carved immediately above the arched arches of the portal, a strange spectator who had examined everything until then with such impassibility, with such a strained neck, with such a face. misshapen, that, without his half-red and purple attire, he might have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose jaws the long gutters of the cathedral have been disgorging for six hundred years. This spectator had lost nothing of what had been bet since midday in front of the portal of Notre-Dame. And from the first moment, without anyone thinking of observing him, he had strongly attached to one of the small columns of the gallery a large knotted rope, the end of which was going to drag down on the steps. This done, he had taken to watching quietly, and whistling every now and then when a blackbird walked past him. Suddenly, just as the master's servants were preparing to carry out Charmolue's phlegmatic order, he stepped over the balustrade of the gallery, seized the rope with his feet, knees and hands, then he was seen to sink on. the facade, like a drop of rain sliding down a window, running towards the two executioners with the speed of a cat fallen from a roof, knocking them down with two enormous fists, kidnapping the Egyptian with one hand , like a child its doll, and with a single impulse bounce back into the church, raising the young girl above her head, and shouting in a formidable voice: Asylum!","No one had observed, in the gallery of statues of the kings carved just above the pointed arches of the porch, a strange spectator who had until now watched all that happened with such impassivity, with so outstretched a neck, so deformed a visage, that, had it not been for his party-colored red and violet garb, he might have passed for one of those stone monsters through whose jaws the long cathedral gutters have for six centuries past disgorged themselves. This spectator had lost nothing that had passed since noon before the doors of Notre-Dame. And at the very beginning, unseen by any one, he had firmly attached to one of the small columns of the gallery a strong knotted rope, the end of which trailed upon the ground below. This done, he began to look about him quietly, and to whistle from time to time when a blackbird flew by him. All at once, just as the hangman’s assistants were preparing to execute Charmolue’s phlegmatic order, he bestrode the balustrade of the gallery, seized the rope with his feet, knees, and hands; then he slid down the façade as a drop of rain glides down a window-pane, rushed towards the two executioners with the rapidity of a cat falling from a roof, flung them to the ground with his two huge fists, seized the gipsy girl in one hand, as a child might a doll, and with one bound was in the church, holding her above his head, and shouting in a tremendous voice,— “Sanctuary!”","No one had yet observed in the gallery of the statues of the kings, carved directly above the arches of the portal, a strange spectator, who had, up to that time, observed everything with such impassiveness, with a neck so strained, a visage so hideous that, in his motley accoutrement of red and violet, he might have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose mouths the long gutters of the cathedral have discharged their waters for six hundred years. This spectator had missed nothing that had taken place since midday in front of the portal of Notre–Dame.

"Cependant la voix publique avait fait connaître à l’archidiacre de quelle manière miraculeuse l’égyptienne avait été sauvée. Quand il apprit cela, il ne sut ce qu’il en éprouvait.

"Il est certain enfin que l’archidiacre s’était accommodé, dans celle des deux tours qui regarde sur la Grève, tout à côté de la cage aux cloches, une petite cellule fort secrète où nul n’entrait, pas même l’évêque, disait-on, sans son congé. Cette cellule avait été jadis pratiquée presque au sommet de la tour, parmi les nids de corbeaux, par l’évêque Hugo de Besançon1, qui y avait maléficié dans son temps. Ce que renfermait cette cellule, nul ne le savait ; mais on avait vu souvent, des grèves du Terrain, la nuit, à une petite lucarne qu’elle avait sur le derrière de la tour, paraître, disparaître et reparaître à intervalles courts et égaux une clarté rouge, intermittente, bizarre, qui semblait suivre les aspirations haletantes d’un soufflet et venir plutôt d’une flamme que d’une lumière. Dans l’ombre, à cette hauteur, cela faisait un effet singulier et les bonnes femmes disaient : Voilà l’archidiacre qui souffle, l’enfer pétille là-haut.","Finally, it is certain that the archdeacon had accommodated himself, in the one of the two towers which looks on the Grève, right next to the cage with the bells, a small very secret cell where no one entered, not even the bishop, they said, without his leave. This cell had in the past been used almost at the top of the tower, among the crows' nests, by Bishop Hugo de Besançon1, who had malfunctioned there in his time. What this cell contained, no one knew; but we had often seen, from the strikes of the Land, at night, at a small skylight which it had on the back of the tower, appear, disappear and reappear at short and equal intervals a red, intermittent, bizarre light, which seemed to follow the panting aspirations of a bellows and come rather from a flame than from a light. In the shadows, at this height, it had a singular effect and the good women would say: Here is the archdeacon blowing, hell is sparkling up there.","Certain it is, lastly, that the archdeacon had arranged for himself, in that one of the two towers which looks upon the Place de Grève, close beside the belfry a very secret little cell, where none might enter without his leave, not even the bishop, it was said. This cell, contrived in old times, had been almost at the very summit of the tower, among the crows’ nests, by Bishop Hugh of Besançon,bm who practiced sorcery there in his time. What this cell contained, no one knew; but from the shore of the Terrain there was often seen at night, through a small dormer-window at the back of the tower, a strange, red, intermittent light, appearing, disappearing, and reappearing at brief and regular intervals, and seeming to follow the blasts of a bellows, and to proceed rather from the flame of a fire than from the light of a candle. In the. darkness, at that height, it produced a singular effect; and the gossips would say, “There’s the archdeacon blowing again! Hell is sparkling up there!”","Furthermore, it is certain that the archdeacon had established himself in that one of the two towers which looks upon the Grève, just beside the frame for the bells, a very secret little cell, into which no one, not even the bishop, entered without his leave, it was said. This tiny cell had formerly been made almost at the summit of the tower, among the ravens' nests, by Bishop Hugo de Besançon[26] who had wrought sorcery there in his day. What that cell contained, no one knew; but from the strand of the Terrain, at night, there was often seen to appear, disappear, and reappear at brief and regular intervals, at a little dormer window opening upon the back of the tower, a certain red, intermittent, singular light which seemed to follow the panting breaths of a bellows, and to proceed from a flame, rather than from a light. In the darkness, at that height, it produced a singular effect; and the goodwives said: ""There's the archdeacon blowing! hell is sparkling up yonder!"""

Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, pour me la reprendre si vite, il valait mieux ne pas me la donner. Vous ne savez donc pas que nos enfants tiennent à notre ventre, et qu’une mère qui a perdu son enfant ne croit plus en Dieu ? – Ah ! misérable que je suis, d’être sortie ce jour-là ! – Seigneur ! Seigneur ! pour me l’ôter ainsi, vous ne m’aviez donc jamais regardée avec elle, lorsque je la réchauffais toute joyeuse à mon feu, lorsqu’elle me riait en me tétant, lorsque je faisais monter ses petits pieds sur ma poitrine jusqu’à mes lèvres ?

Oh ! si je savais où traîne un pan de votre robe, je m’y cramponnerais de mes deux mains, et il faudrait bien que vous me rendissiez mon enfant ! Son joli petit soulier, est-ce que vous n’en avez pas pitié, Seigneur? Pouvez-vous condamner une pauvre mère à ce supplice de quinze ans ? Bonne Vierge ! bonne Vierge du ciel ! mon enfant-Jésus à moi, on me l’a pris, on me l’a volé, on l’a mangé sur une bruyère, on a bu son sang, on a mâché ses os ! Bonne Vierge, ayez pitié de moi !

Hélas ! Dieu mon Seigneur, je ne suis qu’une vile pécheresse ; mais ma fille me rendait pieuse.

"Devant le portail central, il s’arrêta. L'escorte se rangea en bataille des deux côtés. La foule fit silence, et au milieu de ce silence plein de solennité et d’anxiété les deux battants de la grande porte tournèrent, comme d’eux-mêmes, sur leurs gonds qui grincèrent avec un bruit de fifre. Alors on vit dans toute sa longueur la profonde église, sombre, tendue de deuil, à peine éclairée de quelques cierges scintillant au loin sur le maître-autel, ouverte comme une gueule de taverne au milieu de la place éblouissante de lumière. Tout au fond, dans l’ombre de l’abside, on entrevoyait une gigantesque croix d’argent, développée sur un drap noir qui tombait de la voûte au pavé. Toute la nef était déserte. Cependant on voyait remuer confusément quelques têtes de prêtres dans les stalles lointaines du chœur, et au moment où la grande porte s’ouvrit il s’échappa de l’église un chant grave, éclatant et monotone qui jetait comme par bouffées sur la tête de la condamnée des fragments de psaumes lugubres.","In front of the central portal, he stopped.

Deep down, in the shadow of the apse, we caught a glimpse of a gigantic silver cross, developed on a black sheet that fell from the vault to the pavement. The whole nave was deserted. However, a few priests' heads could be seen moving confusedly in the distant stalls of the choir, and at the moment when the great door opened a grave, dazzling and monotonous song escaped from the church which threw as if in puffs on the head of the choir. the condemned from the gloomy psalms fragments.","Before the central door it stopped.

At the very end, in the shadows of the chancel, a huge silver cross was dimly visible, standing out in relief against a black cloth which hung from the roof to the floor. The whole nave was empty; but heads of priests were seen moving confusedly among the distant choir-stalls, and, at the moment that the great door was thrown open, a loud, solemn, and monotonous chant proceeded from the church, casting fragments of dismal psalms, like gusts of wind, upon the prisoner’s head:—","It halted before the central portal.

"Il ne reste aujourd’hui qu’un bien imperceptible vestige de la place de Grève telle qu’elle existait alors. C'est la charmante tourelle qui occupe l’angle nord de la place, et qui, déjà ensevelie sous l’ignoble badigeonnage qui empâte les vives arêtes de ses sculptures, aura bientôt disparu peut-être, submergée par cette crue de maisons neuves qui dévore si rapidement toutes les vieilles façades de Paris.","Today only a very imperceptible vestige of the Place de Grève remains as it then existed.

"Enfin on fit des livres. Les traditions avaient enfanté des symboles, sous lesquels elles disparaissaient comme le tronc de l’arbre sous son feuillage ; tous ces symboles, auxquels l’humanité avait foi, allaient croissant, se multipliant, se croisant, se compliquant de plus en plus ; les premiers monuments ne suffisaient plus à les contenir ; ils en étaient débordés de toutes parts ; à peine ces monuments exprimaient-ils encore la tradition primitive, comme eux simple, nue et gisante sur le sol. Le symbole avait besoin de s’épanouir dans l’édifice. L'architecture alors se développa avec la pensée humaine ; elle devint géante à mille têtes et à mille bras, et fixa sous une forme éternelle, visible, palpable, tout ce symbolisme flottant. Tandis que Dédale, qui est la force, mesurait, tandis qu’Orphée, qui est l’intelligence, chantait, le pilier qui est une lettre, l’arcade qui est une syllabe, la pyramide qui est un mot, mis en mouvement à la fois par une loi de géométrie et par une loi de poésie, se groupaient, se combinaient, s’amalgamaient, descendaient, montaient, se juxtaposaient sur le sol, s’étageaient dans le ciel, jusqu’à ce qu’ils eussent écrit, sous la dictée de l’idée générale d’une époque, ces livres merveilleux qui étaient aussi de merveilleux édifices ; la pagode d’Eklinga, le Rhamseïon d’Égypte, le temple de Salomon.","Finally we made books. The traditions had given birth to symbols, under which they disappeared like the trunk of a tree under its foliage; all these symbols, in which humanity had faith, were growing, multiplying, intersecting, becoming more and more complicated; the first monuments were no longer sufficient to contain them; they were overwhelmed on all sides; hardly these monuments still expressed the primitive tradition, like them simple, naked and lying on the ground. The symbol needed to flourish in the building. Architecture then developed with human thought; she became a giant with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, and fixed in an eternal, visible, palpable form all this floating symbolism. While Daedalus, who is force, measured, while Orpheus, who is intelligence, sang, the pillar which is a letter, the arch which is a syllable, the pyramid which is a word, set in motion by at the same time by a law of geometry and by a law of poetry, grouped, combined, amalgamated, descended, ascended, juxtaposed on the ground, staged in the sky, until they had written , under the dictation of the general idea of an epoch, those marvelous books which were also marvelous buildings; the pagoda of Eklinga, the Rhamseion of Egypt, the temple of Solomon.","Finally, men made books. Traditions gave birth to symbols, which hid them as the leaves hide the trunk of a tree; all these symbols, in which humanity believed, grew, multiplied, crossed one another, became more and more complicated; the first monuments were no longer sufficient to contain them; they overflowed them on every side; these monuments barely sufficed to express the primitive tradition, as bare, as simple, and as plain as themselves. Symbolism must needs expand into an edifice. Architecture, therefore, was developed parallel with human thought; it became a thousand-headed, thousand-armed giantess, and fixed all that floating symbolism in an eternal, visible, palpable form. While Dædalus, that is, force, measured; while Orpheus, which is to say, intellect, sang, the column, which is a letter, the arcade, which is a syllable, the pyramid, which is a word, set in motion alike by a geometric and a poetic law, grouped, combined, blended, rose, fell, were juxtaposed upon the ground, placed in rows one above another in air, until they had written, at the dictation of the universal idea of an epoch, those marvelous books which were also marvelous buildings,—the pagoda at Eklinga, the Egyptian Rhamseïon, the Temple of Solomon.","At last they made books. Traditions had brought forth symbols, beneath which they disappeared like the trunk of a tree beneath its foliage; all these symbols in which humanity placed faith continued to grow, to multiply, to intersect, to become more and more complicated; the first monuments no longer sufficed to contain them, they were overflowing in every part; these monuments hardly expressed now the primitive tradition, simple like themselves, naked and prone upon the earth. The symbol felt the need of expansion in the edifice. Then architecture was developed in proportion with human thought; it became a giant with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, and fixed all this floating symbolism in an eternal, visible, palpable form. While Daedalus, who is force, measured; while Orpheus, who is intelligence, sang;—the pillar, which is a letter; the arcade, which is a syllable; the pyramid, which is a word,—all set in movement at once by a law of geometry and by a law of poetry, grouped themselves, combined, amalgamated, descended, ascended, placed themselves side by side on the soil, ranged themselves in stories in the sky, until they had written under the dictation of the general idea of an epoch, those marvellous books which were also marvellous edifices: the Pagoda of Eklinga, the Rhamseion of Egypt, the Temple of Solomon."

"Je ne crois pas qu’il y ait rien au monde de plus riant que les idées qui s’éveillent dans le cœur d’une mère à la vue du petit soulier de son enfant. Surtout si c’est le soulier de fête, des dimanches, du baptême, le soulier brodé jusque sous la semelle, un soulier avec lequel l’enfant n’a pas encore fait un pas. Ce soulier-là a tant de grâce et de petitesse, il lui est si impossible de marcher, que c’est pour la mère comme si elle voyait son enfant. Elle lui sourit, elle le baise, elle lui parle. Elle se demande s’il se peut en effet qu’un pied soit si petit ; et, l’enfant fût-il absent, il suffit du joli soulier pour lui remettre sous les yeux la douce et fragile créature. Elle croit le voir, elle le voit, tout entier, vivant, joyeux, avec ses mains délicates, sa tête ronde, ses lèvres pures, ses yeux sereins dont le blanc est bleu. Si c’est l’hiver, il est là, il rampe sur le tapis, il escalade laborieusement un tabouret, et la mère tremble qu’il n’approche du feu. Si c’est l’été, il se traîne dans la cour, dans le jardin, arrache l’herbe d’entre les pavés, regarde naïvement les grands chiens, les grands chevaux, sans peur, joue avec les coquillages, avec les fleurs, et fait gronder le jardinier qui trouve le sable dans les plates-bandes et la terre dans les allées. Tout rit, tout brille, tout joue autour de lui comme lui, jusqu’au souffle d’air et au rayon de soleil qui s’ébattent à l’envi dans les boucles follettes de ses cheveux. Le soulier montre tout cela à la mère et lui fait fondre le cœur comme le feu une cire.","I don't think there is anything in the world more laughing than the thoughts that awaken in a mother's heart at the sight of her child's little shoe. Especially if it is the holiday shoe, for Sundays, for baptism, the shoe embroidered right down to the sole, a shoe with which the child has not yet taken a step. This shoe has so much grace and smallness, it is so impossible for her to walk, that it is for the mother as if she were seeing her child. She smiles at him, she kisses him, she talks to him. She wonders if it could indeed be that a foot is so small; and, even if the child were absent, all that was needed was the pretty shoe to put the gentle and fragile creature before his eyes. She thinks she sees him, she sees him, whole, alive, joyful, with her delicate hands, her round head, her pure lips, her serene eyes whose white is blue. If it's winter, he's there, he crawls on the carpet, he laboriously climbs a stool, and the mother trembles that he approaches the fire. If it is summer, he crawls in the yard, in the garden, pulls the grass from between the paving stones, naively looks at the big dogs, the big horses, without fear, plays with the shells, with the flowers , and scolds the gardener who finds sand in the flower beds and earth in the alleys. Everything laughs, everything shines, everything plays around him like him, until the breath of air and the ray of sunlight frolic in the wild curls of his hair. The shoe shows all this to the mother and melts her heart like a wax fire.","I do not think that there is anything in the world more delightful than the ideas aroused in a mother’s heart by the sight of her child’s little shoe, especially if it be a best shoe, a Sunday shoe, a christening shoe, a shoe embroidered down to the very sole, a shoe in which the child has never yet taken a step. That shoe is so dainty, so tiny, it is so impossible for it to walk, that it is to the mother as if she saw her child itself. She smiles at it, kisses it, talks to it; she asks it if there can really be so small a foot; and if the child be absent, the pretty shoe is quite enough to bring the sweet and fragile creature before her eyes. She fancies she sees it; she does see it, from head to foot full of life and laughter, with its delicate hands, its round head, its pure lips, its clear eyes, whose very white is blue. If it be winter, it is there; it crawls over the carpet; it laboriously climbs upon a stool, and the mother trembles lest it go too near the fire. If it be summer, it creeps about the courtyard or the garden, pulls up the grass which grows between the paving-stones, gazes innocently and fearlessly at the big dogs and horses, plays with shells and flowers, and makes the gardener scold when he finds sand on his borders and dirt in his paths. All is bright and gay; all is mirth around it like itself, even to the breeze and the sunbeam, which vie with each other in sporting among the light curls of its hair. The shoe shows the mother all this, and makes her heart melt within her like wax before the fire.","I do not believe that there is anything sweeter in the world than the ideas which awake in a mother's heart at the sight of her child's tiny shoe; especially if it is a shoe for festivals, for Sunday, for baptism, the shoe embroidered to the very sole, a shoe in which the infant has not yet taken a step. That shoe has so much grace and daintiness, it is so impossible for it to walk, that it seems to the mother as though she saw her child. She smiles upon it , she kisses it, she talks to it; she asks herself whether there can actually be a foot so tiny; and if the child be absent, the pretty shoe suffices to place the sweet and fragile creature before her eyes. She thinks she sees it , she does see it, complete, living, joyous, with its delicate hands, its round head, its pure lips, its serene eyes whose white is blue. If it is in winter, it is yonder, crawling on the carpet, it is laboriously climbing upon an ottoman, and the mother trembles lest it should approach the fire. If it is summer time, it crawls about the yard, in the garden, plucks up the grass between the paving–stones, gazes innocently at the big dogs, the big horses, without fear, plays with the shells, with the flowers, and makes the gardener grumble because he finds sand in the flower–beds and earth in the paths. Everything laughs, and shines and plays around it, like it, even the breath of air and the ray of sun which vie with each other in disporting among the silky ringlets of its hair.

"Chacune des sections de cette procession grotesque avait sa musique particulière. Les égyptiens faisaient détonner leurs balafos et leurs tambourins d’Afrique. Les argotiers, race fort peu musicale, en étaient encore à la viole, au cornet à bouquin et à la gothique rubebbe du douzième siècle.

Mais c’est autour du pape des fous que se déployaient, dans une cacophonie magnifique, toutes les richesses musicales de l’époque.

"Après quelques degrés montés et descendus dans des couloirs si sombres qu’on les éclairait de lampes en plein jour, la Esmeralda, toujours entourée de son lugubre cortège, fut poussée par les sergents du palais dans une chambre sinistre. Cette chambre, de forme ronde, occupait le rez-de-chaussée de l’une de ces grosses tours qui percent encore, dans notre siècle, la couche d’édifices modernes dont le nouveau Paris a recouvert l’ancien. Pas de fenêtre à ce caveau, pas d’autre ouverture que l’entrée, basse et battue d’une énorme porte de fer. La clarté cependant n’y manquait point. Un four était pratiqué dans l’épaisseur du mur. Un gros feu y était allumé, qui remplissait le caveau de ses rouges réverbérations, et dépouillait de tout rayonnement une misérable chandelle posée dans un coin. La herse de fer qui servait à fermer le four, levée en ce moment, ne laissait voir, à l’orifice du soupirail flamboyant sur le mur ténébreux, que l’extrémité inférieure de ses barreaux, comme une rangée de dents noires, aiguës et espacées, ce qui faisait ressembler la fournaise à l’une de ces bouches de dragons qui jettent des flammes dans les légendes. À la lumière qui s’en échappait, la prisonnière vit tout autour de la chambre des instruments effroyables dont elle ne comprenait pas l’usage. Au milieu gisait un matelas de cuir presque posé à terre, sur lequel pendait une courroie à boucle, rattachée à un anneau de cuivre que mordait un monstre camard sculpté dans la clef de la voûte. Des tenailles, des pinces, de larges fers de charrue, encombraient l’intérieur du four et rougissaient pêle-mêle sur la braise. La sanglante lueur de la fournaise n’éclairait dans toute la chambre qu’un fouillis de choses horribles.","After a few steps up and down in corridors so dark that they were lit with lamps in broad daylight, the Esmeralda, still surrounded by her dismal procession, was pushed by the palace sergeants into a grim room. This round room occupied the ground floor of one of those large towers which still pierce, in our century, the layer of modern buildings with which the new Paris has covered the old. No window to this vault, no other opening than the entrance, low and beaten with an enormous iron door. There was no lack of clarity, however. A furnace was made in the thickness of the wall. A large fire was lighted there, which filled the cellar with its red reverberations, and deprived of all radiance a miserable candle placed in a corner. The iron portcullis which served to close the oven, raised at this moment, only allowed to see, through the opening of the flaming window on the dark wall, the lower extremity of its bars, like a row of black, sharp teeth. spaced apart, which made the furnace look like one of those flaming dragon mouths in legends. In the escaping light, the prisoner saw appalling instruments all around the chamber which she did not understand the use of. In the middle was a leather mattress almost lying on the ground, on which hung a looped strap, attached to a copper ring bit by a camard monster carved in the keystone of the vault. Pliers, pliers, and large plowshares littered the interior of the oven and blushed pell-mell on the embers. The bloody glow of the furnace lit up a jumble of horrible things throughout the room.","After going up a few steps and down a few steps in corridors so dark that they were lighted with lamps at midday, Esmeralda, still surrounded by her dismal escort, was pushed by the sergeants of the Palace into a room of forbidding appearance. This room, round in form, occupied the ground-floor of one of those great towers which still rise above the layer of modern structures with which the new Paris has covered the old city. There were no windows in this vault, nor was there any opening save the low entrance closed by a huge iron door. Still, there was no lack of light; a furnace was built in the thickness of the wall; a vast fire had been kindled in it, which filled the vault with its red glow, and robbed a paltry candle, placed in a corner, of all its radiance. The iron grating which served to close the furnace was just now raised, only showing, at the mouth of the flaming chasm against the dark wall, the lower edge of its bars, like a row of sharp black teeth set at regular intervals, which made the furnace look like the mouth of one of those legendary dragons that spit forth fire. By the light which it cast, the prisoner saw, all around the room, terrible instruments whose use she did not understand. In the middle of the room was a leather mattress laid almost flat upon the ground, over which hung a strap with a buckle, attached to a copper ring held by a flat-nosed monster carved on the keystone of the vaulted ceiling. Pincers, nippers, and broad plowshares filled the interior of the furnace, and glowed in a confused white-hot heap upon the living coals. The blood-red light of the furnace illuminated in the entire room nothing but a mass of horrible objects.","After ascending and descending several steps in the corridors, which were so dark that they were lighted by lamps at mid–day, La Esmeralda, still surrounded by her lugubrious escort, was thrust by the police into a gloomy chamber. This chamber, circular in form, occupied the ground floor of one of those great towers, which, even in our own century, still pierce through the layer of modern edifices with which modern Paris has covered ancient Paris. There were no windows to this cellar; no other opening than the entrance, which was low, and closed by an enormous iron door. Nevertheless, light was not lacking; a furnace had been constructed in the thickness of the wall; a large fire was lighted there, which filled the vault with its crimson reflections and deprived a miserable candle, which stood in one corner, of all radiance. The iron grating which served to close the oven, being raised at that moment, allowed only a view at the mouth of the flaming vent–hole in the dark wall, the lower extremity of its bars, like a row of black and pointed teeth, set flat apart; which made the furnace resemble one of those mouths of dragons which spout forth flames in ancient legends. By the light which escaped from it, the prisoner beheld, all about the room, frightful instruments whose use she did not understand. In the centre lay a leather mattress, placed almost flat upon the ground, over which hung a strap provided with a buckle, attached to a brass ring in the mouth of a flat–nosed monster carved in the keystone of the vault. Tongs, pincers, large ploughshares, filled the interior of the furnace, and glowed in a confused heap on the coals. The sanguine light of the furnace illuminated in the chamber only a confused mass of horrible things."

He had not noticed, that at the moment when he was closing the doors, the archdeacon had passed close to him and betrayed some displeasure on seeing him bolting and barring with care the enormous iron locks which gave to their large leaves the solidity of a wall. Dom Claude's air was even more preoccupied than usual. Moreover, since the nocturnal adventure in the cell, he had constantly abused Quasimodo, but in vain did he ill treat, and even beat him occasionally, nothing disturbed the submission, patience, the devoted resignation of the faithful bellringer. He endured everything on the part of the archdeacon, insults, threats, blows, without murmuring a complaint. At the most, he gazed uneasily after Dom Claude when the latter ascended the staircase of the tower; but the archdeacon had abstained from presenting himself again before the gypsy's eyes."
"Elle était là, perdue dans les ténèbres, ensevelie, enfouie, murée. Qui l’eût pu voir en cet état, après l’avoir vue rire et danser au soleil, eût frémi. Froide comme la nuit, froide comme la mort, plus un souffle d’air dans ses cheveux, plus un bruit humain à son oreille, plus une lueur de jour dans ses yeux, brisée en deux, écrasée de chaînes, accroupie près d’une cruche et d’un pain sur un peu de paille dans la mare d’eau qui se formait sous elle des suintements du cachot, sans mouvement, presque sans haleine, elle n’en était même plus à souffrir, Phœbus, le soleil, midi, le grand air, les rues de Paris, les danses aux applaudissements, les doux babillages d’amour avec l’officier, puis le prêtre, la matrulle, le poignard, le sang, la torture, le gibet, tout cela repassait bien encore dans son esprit, tantôt comme une vision chantante et dorée, tantôt comme un cauchemar difforme ; mais ce n’était plus qu’une lutte horrible et vague qui se perdait dans les ténèbres, ou qu’une musique lointaine qui se jouait là-haut sur la terre, et qu’on n’entendait plus à la profondeur où la malheureuse était tombée.","She was there, lost in the darkness, buried, buried, walled up. Anyone who could have seen her in this state, after having seen her laugh and dance in the sun, would have shuddered. Cold as night, cold as death, no more a breath of air in her hair, no more a human sound in her ear, no more a daylight in her eyes, broken in two, crushed in chains, squatting near a jug and a loaf of bread on a little straw in the pool of water that formed under her from the oozes of the dungeon, without movement, almost without breath, she was no longer even suffering, Phoebus, the sun, noon , the open air, the streets of Paris, the dances to applause, the sweet babbling of love with the officer, then the priest, the matrulle, the dagger, the blood, the torture, the gallows, all this went back well again in his mind, sometimes like a singing golden vision, sometimes like a misshapen nightmare; but it was no more than a horrible and vague struggle which was lost in the darkness, or a distant music which was played up there on the earth, and which one no longer heard at the depth where the unhappy woman had fallen.","There she lay, lost in the darkness, buried, entombed, immured. Whoever had seen her in that state, after having seen her laugh and dance in the sunshine, must have shivered. Cold as night, cold as death, not a breath of air to flutter her hair, not a human sound in her ear, not a ray of daylight in her eyes, bent double, crushed beneath her chains, crouching beside a jug and a loaf of bread, upon a little straw, in the pool of water formed beneath her by the damp oozing of her cell, motionless, nearly breathless, she was almost beyond all sense of suffering. Phoebus, the sun, high noon, the fresh air, the streets of Paris, her dancing always hailed with applause, the sweet prattle of love with the officer; then the priest, the old hag, the dagger, the blood, the torture, and the gallows,—all these things had hovered before her, now like a gay and golden vision, now like a monstrous nightmare; but they were now naught but a vague and horrible struggle lost in the darkness, or like distant music played above, on the earth, and no longer heard in the depths to which the wretched girl had fallen.","There she lay, lost in the shadows, buried, hidden, immured. Any one who could have beheld her in this state, after having seen her laugh and dance in the sun, would have shuddered.

"Cet étrange accompagnement, qui rendait la pièce difficile à suivre, indignait d’autant plus Gringoire qu’il ne pouvait se dissimuler que l’intérêt allait toujours croissant et qu’il ne manquait à son ouvrage que d’être écouté. Il était en effet difficile d’imaginer une contexture plus ingénieuse et plus dramatique. Les quatre personnages du prologue se lamentaient dans leur mortel embarras, lorsque Vénus en personne, vera incessu patuit dea, s’était présentée à eux, vêtue d’une belle cotte-hardie armoriée au navire de la ville de Paris. Elle venait elle-même réclamer le dauphin promis à la plus belle. Jupiter, dont on entendait la foudre gronder dans le vestiaire, l’appuyait, et la déesse allait l’emporter, c’est-à-dire, sans figure, épouser monsieur le dauphin, lorsqu’une jeune enfant, vêtue de damas blanc et tenant en main une marguerite (diaphane personnification de mademoiselle de Flandre), était venue lutter avec Vénus. Coup de théâtre et péripétie. Après controverse, Vénus, Marguerite et la cantonade étaient convenues de s’en remettre au bon jugement de la sainte Vierge. Il y avait encore un beau rôle, celui de dom Pèdre, roi de Mésopotamie. Mais, à travers tant d’interruptions, il était difficile de démêler à quoi il servait. Tout cela était monté par l’échelle.","This strange accompaniment, which made the piece difficult to follow, outraged Gringoire all the more as he could not hide from himself as interest was ever growing and all that was needed in his work was to be listened to. It was indeed difficult to imagine a more ingenious and more dramatic texture. The four characters in the prologue were lamenting in their mortal embarrassment, when Venus herself, vera incessu patuit dea, presented herself to them, dressed in a beautiful coat of arms emblazoned on the ship of the city of Paris. She herself came to claim the dolphin promised to the most beautiful. Jupiter, whose lightning thundering in the cloakroom could be heard, supported it, and the goddess was going to carry it, that is to say, without a figure, to marry Monsieur the Dauphin, when a young child, dressed in white damask and holding in hand a daisy (diaphanous personification of Mademoiselle de Flandre), had come to fight with Venus. A dramatic twist and a twist. After controversy, Venus, Marguerite and the township had agreed to rely on the good judgment of the Blessed Virgin. There was still a fine role, that of Dom Pèdre, king of Mesopotamia. But, through so many interruptions, it was difficult to disentangle what he was used for. It all went up the ladder.","This strange accompaniment, which made it very hard to follow the play, enraged Gringoire all the more because he could not blind himself to the fact that the interest was constantly increasing, and that all his work needed was to be heard. It was indeed difficult to conceive of a more ingenious and more dramatic context. The four characters of the prologue were lamenting their terrible embarrassment, when Venus in person (vera incessu patuit dea) appeared before them, clad in a fine coat of mail, emblazoned with the ship from the seal of the city of Paris. She came herself to claim the dolphin promised to the fairest of the fair. Jupiter, whose thunder was heard muttering in the dressing-room below, supported her claim, and the goddess was about to triumph,—that is, speaking without metaphor, to marry the Dauphin,—when a young child, habited in white damask and holding a daisy (an obvious allusion to the Lady of Flanders), came to contest the prize with Venus. Theatrical effect and sudden change of affairs! After some controversy, Venus, Margaret, and those behind the scenes agreed to refer the matter to the wise decision of the Holy Virgin. There was also another fine part, that of Don Pedro, King of Mesopotamia; but amid so many interruptions it was difficult to discover the object of his introduction. All these characters came up the ladder.","This strange accompaniment, which rendered it difficult to follow the piece, made Gringoire all the more indignant because he could not conceal from himself the fact that the interest was continually increasing, and that all his work required was a chance of being heard.

The four personages of the prologue were bewailing themselves in their mortal embarrassment, when Venus in person, (vera incessa patuit dea) presented herself to them, clad in a fine robe bearing the heraldic device of the ship of the city of Paris. She had come herself to claim the dolphin promised to the most beautiful. Jupiter, whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing–room, supported her claim, and Venus was on the point of carrying it off,—that is to say, without allegory, of marrying monsieur the dauphin, when a young child clad in white damask, and holding in her hand a daisy (a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite of Flanders) came to contest it with Venus. Theatrical effect and change. After a dispute, Venus, Marguerite, and the assistants agreed to submit to the good judgment of time holy Virgin.

"Et d’abord, bourdonnement dans les oreilles, éblouissement dans les yeux. Au-dessus de nos têtes une double voûte en ogive, lambrissée en sculptures de bois, peinte d’azur, fleurdelysée en or ; sous nos pieds, un pavé alternatif de marbre blanc et noir. À quelques pas de nous, un énorme pilier, puis un autre, puis un autre ; en tout sept piliers dans la longueur de la salle, soutenant au milieu de sa largeur les retombées de la double voûte. Autour des quatre premiers piliers, des boutiques de marchands, tout étincelantes de verre et de clinquants ; autour des trois derniers, des bancs de bois de chêne, usés et polis par le haut-de-chausses des plaideurs et la robe des procureurs. À l’entour de la salle, le long de la haute muraille, entre les portes, entre les croisées, entre les piliers, l’interminable rangée des statues de tous les rois de France depuis Pharamond ; les rois fainéants, les bras pendants et les yeux baissés ; les rois vaillants et bataillards, la tête et les mains hardiment levées au ciel. Puis, aux longues fenêtres ogives, des vitraux de mille couleurs ; aux larges issues de la salle, de riches portes finement sculptées ; et le tout, voûtes, piliers, murailles, chambranles, lambris, portes, statues, recouvert du haut en bas d’une splendide enluminure bleu et or, qui, déjà un peu ternie à l’époque où nous la voyons, avait presque entièrement disparu sous la poussière et les toiles d’araignée en l’an de grâce 1549, où Du Breul l’admirait encore par tradition.","And first, ringing in the ears, glare in the eyes. Above our heads a double pointed vault, paneled in wood sculptures, painted azure, fleurdelysee in gold; under our feet, an alternating paving stone of white and black marble. A few paces from us, a huge pillar, then another, then another; in all, seven pillars running the length of the hall, supporting the fallout of the double vault in the middle of its width. Around the first four pillars, merchant's shops, all sparkling with glass and tinsel; around the last three, oak benches, worn and polished by the breeches of the litigants and the dresses of the attorneys. Around the hall, along the high wall, between the doors, between the windows, between the pillars, the endless row of statues of all the kings of France since Pharamond; lazy kings with hanging arms and downcast eyes; valiant and battling kings, head and hands boldly raised to heaven. Then, with the long pointed windows, stained glass windows of a thousand colors; at the wide exits of the room, rich, intricately carved doors; and the whole, vaults, pillars, walls, jambs, paneling, doors, statues, covered from top to bottom with a splendid blue and gold illumination, which, already a little tarnished at the time when we see it, had almost entirely disappeared under the dust and cobwebs in the year of grace 1549, where Du Breul still admired him by tradition.","First of all there is a ringing in our ears, a dimness in our eyes.

Around the hall, along the lofty wall, between the doors, between the casements, between the pillars, is an unending series of statues of all the kings of France, from Pharamond down,—the sluggard kings, with loosely hanging arms and downcast eyes; the brave and warlike kings, with head and hands boldly raised to heaven. Then in the long pointed windows, glass of a thousand hues; at the wide portals of the hall, rich doors finely carved; and the whole—arches, pillars, walls, cornices, wainscot, doors, and statues—covered from top to bottom with a gorgeous coloring of blue and gold, which, somewhat tarnished even at the date when we see it, had almost disappeared under dust and cobwebs in the year of grace 1549, when Du Breuil admired it from hearsay alone.","And, first of all, there is a buzzing in the ears, a dazzlement in the eyes.

"Quasimodo s’était arrêté sous le grand portail. Ses larges pieds semblaient aussi solides sur le pavé de l’église que les lourds piliers romans. Sa grosse tête chevelue s’enfonçait dans ses épaules comme celle des lions qui eux aussi ont une crinière et pas de cou. Il tenait la jeune fille toute palpitante suspendue à ses mains calleuses comme une draperie blanche ; mais il la portait avec tant de précaution qu’il paraissait craindre de la briser ou de la faner. On eût dit qu’il sentait que c’était une chose délicate, exquise et précieuse, faite pour d’autres mains que les siennes. Par moments, il avait l’air de n’oser la toucher, même du souffle. Puis, tout à coup, il la serrait avec étreinte dans ses bras, sur sa poitrine anguleuse, comme son bien, comme son trésor, comme eût fait la mère de cette enfant ; son œil de gnome, abaissé sur elle, l’inondait de tendresse, de douleur et de pitié, et se relevait subitement plein d’éclairs. Alors les femmes riaient et pleuraient, la foule trépignait d’enthousiasme, car en ce moment-là Quasimodo avait vraiment sa beauté. Il était beau, lui, cet orphelin, cet enfant trouvé, ce rebut, il se sentait auguste et fort, il regardait en face cette société dont il était banni, et dans laquelle il intervenait si puissamment, cette justice humaine à laquelle il avait arraché sa proie, tous ces tigres forcés de mâcher à vide, ces sbires, ces juges, ces bourreaux, toute cette force du roi qu’il venait de briser, lui infime, avec la force de Dieu.","Quasimodo had stopped under the large gate. Its broad feet seemed as solid on the pavement of the church as the heavy Roman pillars. His large, hairy head sank into his shoulders like that of lions who also have a mane and no neck. He held the young girl, all throbbing, suspended from his callused hands like a white drapery; but he wore it so carefully that he seemed afraid of breaking or fading it. It was as if he sensed that it was a delicate, exquisite and precious thing, made for other hands than his own. There were times when he didn't seem to dare touch her, even with his breath. Then, suddenly, he hugged her tightly in his arms, on his angular bosom, like his property, like his treasure, as the mother of this child would have done; his gnomish eye, lowered on her, flooded her with tenderness, pain and pity, and suddenly rose brightly. So the women were laughing and crying, the crowd was stamping with enthusiasm, because at that moment Quasimodo really had his beauty. He was handsome, this orphan, this foundling, this scum, he felt august and strong, he looked in the face at this society from which he was banished, and in which he intervened so powerfully, this human justice from which he had torn his prey, all these tigers forced to chew empty, these minions, these judges, these executioners, all this strength of the king that he had just broken, he tiny, with the strength of God.","Quasimodo had paused beneath the great portal, his broad feet seeming as firmly rooted to the pavement of the church as the heavy Roman pillars. His big bushy head was buried between his shoulders like the head of a lion which also has a mane and no neck. He held the young girl, trembling from head to foot, suspended in his horny hands like a white drapery; but he carried her as carefully as if he feared he should break or injure her. He seemed to feel that she was a delicate, exquisite, precious thing, made for other hands than his. At times he looked as if he dared not touch her, even with his breath. Then, all at once, he pressed her close in his arms, upon his angular bosom, as his treasure, his only wealth, as her mother might have done. His gnome-like eye, resting upon her, flooded her with tenderness, grief, and pity, and was suddenly lifted, flashing fire. Then the women laughed and wept, the mob stamped with enthusiasm, for at that instant Quasimodo was truly beautiful. He was beautiful,—he, that orphan, that foundling, that outcast; he felt himself to be august and strong; he confronted that society from which he was banished, and with whose decrees he had so powerfully interfered, that human justice from which he had wrested its prey, all those tigers with empty jaws, those myrmidons, those judges, those executioners, all that royal will which he had crushed, he,—the lowliest of creatures, with the strength of God.16","Quasimodo had halted beneath the great portal, his huge feet seemed as solid on the pavement of the church as the heavy Roman pillars.

À travers un vitrage fêlé, il vit une salle sordide, qui réveilla un souvenir confus dans son esprit. Dans cette salle, mal éclairée d’une lampe maigre, il y avait un jeune homme blond et frais, à figure joyeuse, qui embrassait, avec de grands éclats de rire, une jeune fille fort effrontément parée.

"C'est là qu’après sa course effrénée et triomphale sur les tours et les galeries, Quasimodo avait déposé la Esmeralda. Tant que cette course avait duré, la jeune fille n’avait pu reprendre ses sens, à demi assoupie, à demi éveillée, ne sentant plus rien sinon qu’elle montait dans l’air, qu’elle y flottait, qu’elle y volait, que quelque chose l’enlevait au-dessus de la terre.

Alors sa paupière retombait; elle croyait que tout était fini, qu’on l’avait exécutée pendant son évanouissement, et que le difforme esprit qui avait présidé à sa destinée l’avait reprise et l’emportait.

"La présence de cet être extraordinaire faisait circuler dans toute la cathédrale je ne sais quel souffle de vie. Il semblait qu’il s’échappât de lui, du moins au dire des superstitions grossissantes de la foule, une émanation mystérieuse qui animait toutes les pierres de Notre-Dame et faisait palpiter les profondes entrailles de la vieille église. Il suffisait qu’on le sût là pour que l’on crût voir vivre et remuer les mille statues des galeries et des portails. Et de fait, la cathédrale semblait une créature docile et obéissante sous sa main ; elle attendait sa volonté pour élever sa grosse voix ; elle était possédée et remplie de Quasimodo comme d’un génie familier. On eût dit qu’il faisait respirer l’immense édifice. Il y était partout en effet, il se multipliait sur tous les points du monument. Tantôt on apercevait avec effroi au plus haut d’une des tours un nain bizarre qui grimpait, serpentait, rampait à quatre pattes, descendait en dehors sur l’abîme, sautelait de saillie en saillie, et allait fouiller dans le ventre de quelque gorgone sculptée; c’était Quasimodo dénichant des corbeaux. Tantôt on se heurtait dans un coin obscur de l’église à une sorte de chimère vivante, accroupie et renfrognée ; c’était Quasimodo pensant. Tantôt on avisait sous un clocher une tête énorme et un paquet de membres désordonnés se balançant avec fureur au bout d’une corde; c’était Quasimodo sonnant les vêpres ou l’angélus. Souvent, la nuit, on voyait errer une forme hideuse sur la frêle balustrade découpée en dentelle qui couronne les tours et borde le pourtour de l’abside; c’était encore le bossu de Notre-Dame. Alors, disaient les voisines, toute l’église prenait quelque chose de fantastique, de surnaturel, d’horrible ; des yeux et des bouches s’y ouvraient çà et là ; on entendait aboyer les chiens, les guivres, les tarasques de pierre qui veillent jour et nuit, le cou tendu et la gueule ouverte, autour de la monstrueuse cathédrale ; et si c’était une nuit de Noël, tandis que la grosse cloche qui semblait râler appelait les fidèles à la messe ardente de minuit, il y avait un tel air répandu sur la sombre façade qu’on eût dit que le grand portail dévorait la foule et que la rosace la regardait. Et tout cela venait de Quasimodo. L'Égypte l’eût pris pour le dieu de ce temple ; le moyen âge l’en croyait le démon ; il en était l’âme.","The presence of this extraordinary being made circulate in all the cathedral I do not know what breath of life. It seemed as if there was escaping from him, at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre Dame and made the deep bowels of the old church throb. It was enough that one knew it there for one to believe to see living and moving the thousand statues of the galleries and the portals. And indeed, the cathedral seemed a docile and obedient creature under his hand; she waited for her will to raise her loud voice; she was possessed and filled with Quasimodo like a familiar genius. It looked like he was breathing the huge edifice. It was everywhere indeed, it multiplied on all points of the monument. Sometimes one saw with terror at the top of one of the towers a strange dwarf who climbed, meandered, crawled on all fours, descended out onto the abyss, leaped from protrusion to protrusion, and was going to search in the belly of some sculpted gorgon. ; it was Quasimodo unearthing crows. Sometimes in a dark corner of the church we encountered a sort of living chimera, crouching and scowling; it was Quasimodo thinking. Sometimes under a steeple we saw an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was Quasimodo sounding vespers or angelus. Often at night, a hideous form could be seen wandering on the frail lace-cut balustrade that crowns the towers and borders the perimeter of the apse; he was still the hunchback of Notre-Dame. So, the neighbors said, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths opened here and there; you could hear the dogs barking, the guivres, the stone tarascans who watch day and night, their necks outstretched and their mouths open, around the monstrous cathedral; and if it was Christmas night, while the big bell which seemed to moan called the faithful to the fiery midnight mass, there was such an air spread over the gloomy facade that it seemed as if the great portal was devouring the hall. crowd and that the rose window gazed at her. And it all came from Quasimodo. Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple; the Middle Ages believed the demon; he was the soul of it.","The presence of this extraordinary being pervaded the whole cathedral with a peculiar breath of life. It seemed, at least in the opinion of the grossly superstitious mob, as if mysterious emana tions issued from him, animating every stone in Notre-Dame and making the very entrails of the old church throb and palpitate. His mere presence there was enough to lead the vulgar to fancy that the countless statues in the galleries and over the doors moved and breathed. And in very truth the cathedral seemed a creature docile and obedient to his hand: it awaited his pleasure to lift up its mighty voice; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo as with a familiar spirit. He might be said to make the vast edifice breathe. He was indeed omnipresent in it, he multiplied himself at every point of the structure. Sometimes the terrified spectator saw an odd dwarf on the extreme pinnacle of one of the towers, climbing, creeping, writhing, crawling on all fours, descending head-first into the abyss, leaping from one projection to another, and diving deep into the maw of some sculptured gorgon: it was Quasimodo hunting for crows’ nests. Sometimes a visitor stumbled over a sort of living nightmare, crouching and scowling in a dark corner of the church; it was Quasimodo absorbed in thought. Sometimes an enormous head and a bundle of ill-adjusted limbs might be seen swaying frantically to and fro from a rope ’s end under a belfry: it was Quasimodo ringing the Vespers or the Angelus. Often by night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail, delicately wrought railing which crowns the towers and runs round the top of the chancel: it was still the hunchback of Notre-Dame. Then, so the neighbors said, the whole church took on a fantastic, supernatural, horrible air,—eyes and mouths opened wide here and there; the dogs and dragons and griffins of stone which watch day and night, with outstretched necks and gaping jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barked loudly. And if it were a Christmas night, while the big bell, which seemed uttering its death-rattle, called the faithful to attend the solemn midnight mass, the gloomy façade assumed such an aspect that it seemed as if the great door were devouring the crowd while the rose-window looked on. And all this was due to Quasimodo. Egypt would have taken him for the god of the temple; the Middle Ages held him to be its demon: he was its soul.","The presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral. It seemed as though there escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre–Dame, and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate. It sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion. And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo, as with a familiar spirit. One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe. He was everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the structure. Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers, a fantastic dwarf climbing, writhing, crawling on all fours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to projection, and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows. Again, in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera, crouching and scowling; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought. Sometimes one caught sight, upon a bell tower, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus. Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework, which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse; again it was the hunchback of Notre–Dame. Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the gargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking. And, if it was a Christmas Eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the death rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the rose window was watching it. And all this came from Quasimodo. Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple; the Middle Ages believed him to be its demon: he was in fact its soul."

"D’ailleurs, il redoublait de sévérité et n’avait jamais été plus exemplaire. Par état comme par caractère il s’était toujours tenu éloigné des femmes; il semblait les haïr plus que jamais.

Il était sur ce point tellement jaloux d’austérité et de réserve que lorsque la dame de Beaujeu, fille du roi, vint au mois de décembre 1481 visiter le cloître de Notre-Dame, il s’opposa gravement à son entrée, rappelant à l’évêque le statut du Livre Noir, daté de la vigile Saint-Barthélemy 1334, qui interdit l’accès du cloître à toute femme « quelconque, vieille ou jeune, maîtresse ou chambrière ». Sur quoi l’évêque avait été contraint de lui citer l’ordonnance du légat Odo qui excepte certaines grandes dames, aliquæ magnates mulieres, quæ sine scandalo evitari non possunt.

Besides, sire, I did not betray your majesty, 'twas Monsieur d'Angers; and I have on my foot a very heavy chain, and a great ball of iron at the end, much heavier than it should be in reason. Eh! sire! Have pity on me!"""

"Ce n’était point chose très rare dans les villes du moyen âge qu’une entreprise comme celle que les truands tentaient en ce moment sur Notre-Dame. Ce que nous nommons aujourd’hui police n’existait pas alors. Dans les cités populeuses, dans les capitales surtout, pas de pouvoir central, un, régulateur. La féodalité avait construit ces grandes communes d’une façon bizarre. Une cité était un assemblage de mille seigneuries qui la divisaient en compartiments de toutes formes et de toutes grandeurs. De là mille polices contradictoires, c’est-à-dire pas de police. À Paris, par exemple, indépendamment des cent quarante et un seigneurs prétendant censive, il y en avait vingt-cinq prétendant justice et censive, depuis l’évêque de Paris, qui avait cent cinq rues, jusqu’au prieur de Notre-Dame des Champs, qui en avait quatre. Tous ces justiciers féodaux ne reconnaissaient que nominalement l’autorité suzeraine du roi. Tous avaient droit de voirie. Tous étaient chez eux. Louis XI, cet infatigable ouvrier qui a si largement commencé la démolition de l’édifice féodal, continuée par Richelieu et Louis XIV au profit de la royauté, et achevée par Mirabeau au profit du peuple, Louis XI avait bien essayé de crever ce réseau de seigneuries qui recouvrait Paris, en jetant violemment tout au travers deux ou trois ordonnances de police générale. Ainsi, en 1465, ordre aux habitants, la nuit venue, d’illuminer de chandelles leurs croisées, et d’enfermer leurs chiens, sous peine de la hart ; même année, ordre de fermer le soir les rues avec des chaînes de fer, et défense de porter dagues ou armes offensives la nuit dans les rues. Mais, en peu de temps, tous ces essais de législation communale tombèrent en désuétude. Les bourgeois laissèrent le vent éteindre leurs chandelles à leurs fenêtres, et leurs chiens errer ; les chaînes de fer ne se tendirent qu’en état de siège ; la défense de porter dagues n’amena d’autres changements que le nom de la rue Coupe-Gueule au nom de rue Coupe-Gorge, ce qui est un progrès évident. Le vieil échafaudage des juridictions féodales resta debout ; immense entassement de bailliages et de seigneuries se croisant sur la ville, se gênant, s’enchevêtrant, s’emmaillant de travers, s’échancrant les uns les autres ; inutile taillis de guets, de sous-guets et de contre-guets, à travers lequel passaient à main armée le brigandage, la rapine et la sédition. Ce n’était donc pas, dans ce désordre, un événement inouï que ces coups de main d’une partie de la populace sur un palais, sur un hôtel, sur une maison, dans les quartiers les plus peuplés. Dans la plupart des cas, les voisins ne se mêlaient de l’affaire que si le pillage arrivait jusque chez eux. Ils se bouchaient les oreilles à la mousquetade, fermaient leurs volets, barricadaient leurs portes, laissaient le débat se vider avec ou sans le guet, et le lendemain on se disait dans Paris : – Cette nuit, Étienne Barbette a été forcé. – Le maréchal de Clermont a été pris au corps, etc. – Aussi, non seulement les habitations royales, le Louvre, le Palais, la Bastille, les Tournelles, mais les résidences simplement seigneuriales, le Petit-Bourbon, l’Hôtel de Sens, l’Hôtel d’Angoulême, etc., avaient leurs créneaux aux murs et leurs mâchicoulis au-dessus des portes. Les églises se gardaient par leur sainteté. Quelques-unes pourtant, du nombre desquelles n’était pas Notre-Dame, étaient fortifiées. L'abbé de Saint-Germain-des-Prés était crénelé comme un baron, et il y avait chez lui encore plus de cuivre dépensé en bombardes qu’en cloches. On voyait encore sa forteresse en 1610. Aujourd’hui il reste à peine son église.","It was not very rare in medieval towns for an enterprise like the one the mobsters were now attempting on Notre Dame. What we now call the police did not exist then. In the populous cities, in the capitals especially, no central power, one, regulator. Feudalism had built these large towns in a bizarre fashion. A city was an assembly of a thousand seigneuries which divided it into compartments of all shapes and sizes. Hence a thousand contradictory fonts, that is to say no font. In Paris, for example, apart from the one hundred and forty-one lords claiming to be censive, there were twenty-five claiming justice and censive, from the bishop of Paris, who had one hundred and five streets, to the prior of Notre-Dame des Champs, which had four. All these feudal vigilantes only nominally recognized the king's suzerain authority. All had the right to public roads. They were all at home. Louis XI, this indefatigable worker who so widely began the demolition of the feudal building, continued by Richelieu and Louis XIV for the benefit of royalty, and completed by Mirabeau for the benefit of the people, Louis XI had indeed tried to burst this network of seigneuries which covered Paris, throwing violently through two or three ordinances of general police. Thus, in 1465, order to the inhabitants, at nightfall, to light their windows with candles, and to lock up their dogs, on pain of hart; same year, order to close the streets in the evening with iron chains, and prohibition to carry daggers or offensive weapons at night in the streets. But, in a short time, all these attempts at municipal legislation fell into disuse. The citizens allowed the wind to extinguish their candles at their windows, and their dogs to roam; the iron chains were tightened only in a state of siege; the ban on carrying daggers led to no other changes than the name from rue Coupe-Gueule to rue Coupe-Gorge, which is clear progress. The old scaffolding of feudal jurisdictions remained standing; immense heap of bailiwicks and seigneuries crossing over the city, interfering, entangling, entangling askew, indenting each other; useless copses of lookouts, sub-guets and counter-guets, through which armed robbery, plunder and sedition passed. So it was not, in this disorder, an unheard-of event that these helping hands from part of the populace on a palace, on a hotel, on a house, in the most populous districts. In most cases, neighbors only got involved if the looting reached their homes. They covered their ears with the musketeers, closed their shutters, barricaded their doors, allowed the debate to be emptied with or without the watch, and the next day we said to each other in Paris: - This night, Étienne Barbette was forced. - Marshal de Clermont was taken to the body, etc. - Also, not only the royal residences, the Louvre, the Palace, the Bastille, the Tournelles, but the simply stately residences, the Petit-Bourbon, the Hôtel de Sens, the Hôtel d'Angoulême, etc., had their own battlements on the walls and their machicolations above the doors. The churches were guarded by their holiness. Some, however, of which the number was not Notre-Dame, were fortified. The Abbé de Saint-Germain-des-Prés was crenellated like a baron, and in his house there was still more copper spent on bombards than on bells. Its fortress could still be seen in 1610. Today it barely remains its church.","Such an attack as the vagrants were now planning to make upon Notre-Dame was no very uncommon thing in the towns of the Middle Ages. What are now known as police did not then exist. There was no central, controlling power in populous cities, or more particularly in capitals. The feudal system constructed these large communities after a strange fashion. A city was a collection of a thousand seigniories, or manors, which divided it up into districts of all shapes and sizes. Hence arose a thousand contradictory police forces; that is, no police at all. In Paris, for instance, independently of the one hundred and forty-one nobles laying claim to manorial rights, there were twenty-five who also claimed the additional right to administer justice,—from the Bishop of Paris who owned one hundred and five streets, down to the Prior of Notre-Dame des Champs who owned but four. All these feudal justiciaries recognized the supreme power of the king only in name. All had right of way; all were on their own ground. Louis XI, that indefatigable la borer who did such good work in beginning the demolition of the feudal structure, carried on by Richelieu and Louis XIV to the advantage of royalty, and completed by Mirabeau to the advantage of the people,—Louis XI had indeed striven to break this network of seigniories which enveloped Paris, by hurling violently athwart it two or three police ordinances. Thus in 1465 the inhabitants were commanded to light their windows with candles at nightfall, and to shut up their dogs, under pain of the halter; during the same year an order was issued that the streets must be closed with iron chains after dark, and citizens were forbidden to wear daggers or any offensive weapons in the street at night. But all these attempts at municipal legislation soon fell into disuse. People let the wind blow out the candles in their windows, and allowed their dogs to roam; the iron chains were only put up in time of siege; the prohibition of daggers led to but little change. The old framework of feudal jurisdiction remained standing,—an immense number of bailiwicks and seigniories, crossing one another throughout the city, crowded, tangled, interlapping, and interwoven; a useless confusion of watches, sub-watches, and counter-watches, in spite of which brigandage, rapine, and sedition were carried on by main force. It was not, therefore, an unheard-of thing, in the midst of such disorder, for a part of the populace to make a bold attack upon a palace, a great mansion, or a house, in the most thickly settled quarters of the town. In the majority of cases the neighbors did not meddle with the matter, unless the pillage extended to their own houses. They turned a deaf ear to the musketry, closed their shutters, barricaded their doors, left the outbreak to be settled with or without the watch, and next day it would be reported: “Last night Etienne Bar-bette’s house was entered.” “Marshal Clermont was carried off,” etc. Accordingly, not only royal habitations, the Louvre, the Palace, the Bastille, the Tournelles, but the houses of the nobility, the Petit-Bourbon, the Hotel de Sens, Hotel D‘Angouleme, etc., had their battlemented walls and their portcullises. Churches were guarded by their sanctity. Certain of them, however, but not Notre-Dame, were fortified. The abbot of Saint-Germain-des-Prés was as strongly intrenched as any baron, and more brass was consumed there in bombards than in bells. His fortress was still standing in 1610. Now the church alone exists, and that in ruins.","An enterprise like that which the vagabonds were now undertaking against Notre– Dame was not a very rare thing in the cities of the Middle Ages. What we now call the ""police"" did not exist then. In populous cities, especially in capitals, there existed no single, central, regulating power. Feudalism had constructed these great communities in a singular manner. A city was an assembly of a thousand seigneuries, which divided it into compartments of all shapes and sizes. Hence, a thousand conflicting establishments of police; that is to say, no police at all. In Paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty–one lords who laid claim to a manor, there were five and twenty who laid claim to a manor and to administering justice, from the Bishop of Paris, who had five hundred streets, to the Prior of Notre–Dame des Champs, who had four. All these feudal justices recognized the suzerain authority of the king only in name. All possessed the right of control over the roads. All were at home. Louis XI., that indefatigable worker, who so largely began the demolition of the feudal edifice, continued by Richelieu and Louis XIV. for the profit of royalty, and finished by Mirabeau for the benefit of the people,—Louis XI. had certainly made an effort to break this network of seignories which covered Paris, by throwing violently across them all two or three troops of general police. Thus, in 1465, an order to the inhabitants to light candles in their windows at nightfall, and to shut up their dogs under penalty of death; in the same year, an order to close the streets in the evening with iron chains, and a prohibition to wear daggers or weapons of offence in the streets at night. But in a very short time, all these efforts at communal legislation fell into abeyance. The bourgeois permitted the wind to blow out their candles in the windows, and their dogs to stray; the iron chains were stretched only in a state of siege; the prohibition to wear daggers wrought no other changes than from the name of the Rue Coupe –Gueule to the name of the Rue–Coupe–Gorge[60] which is an evident progress. The old scaffolding of feudal jurisdictions remained standing; an immense aggregation of bailiwicks and seignories crossing each other all over the city, interfering with each other, entangled in one another, enmeshing each other, trespassing on each other; a useless thicket of watches, sub–watches and counter–watches, over which, with armed force, passed brigandage, rapine, and sedition. Hence, in this disorder, deeds of violence on the part of the populace directed against a palace, a hotel, or house in the most thickly populated quarters, were not unheard–of occurrences. In the majority of such cases, the neighbors did not meddle with the matter unless the pillaging extended to themselves. They stopped up their ears to the musket shots, closed their shutters, barricaded their doors, allowed the matter to be concluded with or without the watch, and the next day it was said in Paris, ""Etienne Barbette was broken open last night. The Marshal de Clermont was seized last night, etc."" Hence, not only the royal habitations, the Louvre, the Palace, the Bastille, the Tournelles, but simply seignorial residences, the Petit–Bourbon, the Hôtel de Sens, the Hôtel d' Angoulême, etc., had battlements on their walls, and machicolations over their doors. Churches were guarded by their sanctity. Some, among the number Notre–Dame, were fortified. The Abbey of Saint–German–des– Pres was castellated like a baronial mansion, and more brass expended about it in bombards than in bells. Its fortress was still to be seen in 1610. To–day, barely its church remains."

"Le personnage qui entra avait une robe noire et la mine sombre. Ce qui frappa au premier coup d’œil notre ami Jehan (qui, comme on s’en doute bien, s’était arrangé dans son coin de manière à pouvoir tout voir et tout entendre selon son bon plaisir), c’était la parfaite tristesse du vêtement et du visage de ce nouveau venu. Il y avait pourtant quelque douceur répandue sur cette figure, mais une douceur de chat ou de juge, une douceur doucereuse. Il était fort gris, ridé, touchait aux soixante ans, clignait des yeux, avait le sourcil blanc, la lèvre pendante et de grosses mains. Quand Jehan vit que ce n’était que cela, c’est-à-dire sans doute un médecin ou un magistrat, et que cet homme avait le nez très loin de la bouche, signe de bêtise, il se rencoigna dans son trou, désespéré d’avoir à passer un temps indéfini en si gênante posture et en si mauvaise compagnie.","The character who entered wore a black robe and a dark face.

There was, however, some sweetness spread over that face, but a sweetness of a cat or a judge, a sugary sweetness. He was very gray, wrinkled, almost sixty years old, blinked his eyes, had a white eyebrow, a drooping lip, and big hands. When Jehan saw that it was just that, that is to say probably a doctor or a magistrate, and that this man had his nose very far from his mouth, a sign of stupidity, he came together in his hole, desperate to have to spend an indefinite time in such awkward posture and in such bad company.","The person who entered wore a black gown and a gloomy air.

Yet a certain amiability pervaded the countenance, albeit it was the amiability of a cat or a judge,—a sickly amiability. The man was very grey, wrinkled, bordering on sixty years; had white eyebrows, hanging lip, and big hands. When Jehan saw that he was a mere nobody,—that is, probably a doctor or a magistrate, and that his nose was very far away from his mouth, a sure sign of stupidity,—he curled himself up in his hiding-place, in despair at having to pass an indefinite length of time in so uncomfortable a position and in such poor company.","The personage who entered wore a black gown and a gloomy mien.

There was, nevertheless, some sweetness diffused over that face, but it was the sweetness of a cat or a judge, an affected, treacherous sweetness.

"Quant aux monuments modernes du Paris neuf nous nous dispenserons volontiers d’en parler. Ce n’est pas que nous ne les admirions comme il convient. La Sainte-Geneviève de M. Soufflot est certainement le plus beau gâteau de Savoie qu’on ait jamais fait en pierre. Le palais de la Légion d’honneur est aussi un morceau de pâtisserie fort distingué. Le dôme de la Halle au blé est une casquette de jockey anglais sur une grande échelle. Les tours Saint-Sulpice sont deux grosses clarinettes, et c’est une forme comme une autre ; le télégraphe tortu et grimaçant fait un aimable accident sur leur toiture. Saint-Roch a un portail qui n’est comparable pour la magnificence qu’à Saint-Thomas d’Aquin. Il a aussi un calvaire en ronde-bosse dans une cave et un soleil de bois doré. Ce sont là des choses tout à fait merveilleuses. La lanterne du labyrinthe du Jardin des Plantes est aussi fort ingénieuse. Quant au palais de la Bourse, qui est grec par sa colonnade, romain par le plein cintre de ses portes et fenêtres, de la Renaissance par sa grande voûte surbaissée, c’est indubitablement un monument très correct et très pur. La preuve, c’est qu’il est couronné d’un attique comme on n’en voyait pas à Athènes, belle ligne droite, gracieusement coupée çà et là par des tuyaux de poêle. Ajoutons que, s’il est de règle que l’architecture d’un édifice soit adaptée à sa destination de telle façon que cette destination se dénonce d’elle-même au seul aspect de l’édifice, on ne saurait trop s’émerveiller d’un monument qui peut être indifféremment un palais de roi, une chambre des communes, un hôtel de ville, un collège, un manège, une académie, un entrepôt, un tribunal, un musée, une caserne, un sépulcre, un temple, un théâtre. En attendant, c’est une Bourse. Un monument doit en outre être approprié au climat. Celui-ci est évidemment construit exprès pour notre ciel froid et pluvieux. Il a un toit presque plat comme en Orient, ce qui fait que l’hiver, quand il neige, on balaye le toit, et il est certain qu’un toit est fait pour être balayé. Quant à cette destination dont nous parlions tout à l’heure, il la remplit à merveille ; il est Bourse en France, comme il eût été temple en Grèce. Il est vrai que l’architecte a eu assez de peine à cacher le cadran de l’horloge qui eût détruit la pureté des belles lignes de la façade ; mais en revanche on a cette colonnade qui circule autour du monument, et sous laquelle, dans les grands jours de solennité religieuse, peut se développer majestueusement la théorie des agents de change et des courtiers de commerce.","As for the modern monuments of new Paris, we will gladly dispense with them. It’s not that we don’t admire them properly. M. Soufflot's Sainte-Geneviève is certainly the most beautiful Savoy cake that has ever been made in stone. The Palace of the Legion of Honor is also a very distinguished piece of pastry. The Wheat Hall dome is an English jockey cap on a large scale. The Saint-Sulpice towers are two big clarinets, and it's a shape like any other; the twisted and grimacing telegraph makes a pleasant accident on their roof. Saint-Roch has a portal which is comparable for magnificence only to Saint-Thomas d'Aquin. It also has a calvary in the round in a cellar and a sun of golden wood. These are very wonderful things. The lantern in the labyrinth of the Jardin des Plantes is also very ingenious. As for the Stock Exchange Palace, which is Greek by its colonnade, Roman by the semicircular arch of its doors and windows, from the Renaissance by its large low vault, it is undoubtedly a very correct and very pure monument. The proof is that it is crowned with an attic like none seen in Athens, a beautiful straight line, gracefully cut here and there by stove pipes. Let us add that, if it is the rule for the architecture of a building to be adapted to its destination in such a way that this destination reveals itself only to the appearance of the building, one cannot be too amazed. of a monument which can be either a king's palace, a chamber of commons, a town hall, a college, a merry-go-round, an academy, a warehouse, a tribunal, a museum, a barracks, a sepulcher, a temple, a theater. In the meantime, it's a stock exchange. A monument must also be appropriate for the climate. This one is obviously built on purpose for our cold and rainy skies. It has an almost flat roof like in the East, so that in winter, when it snows, you sweep the roof, and it is certain that a roof is made to be swept. As for this destination we were talking about earlier, it fills it wonderfully; it is a stock exchange in France, as it would have been a temple in Greece. It is true that the architect had enough difficulty in hiding the face of the clock which would have destroyed the purity of the beautiful lines of the facade; but on the other hand there is this colonnade which circulates around the monument, and under which, in the great days of religious solemnity, the theory of stockbrokers and commercial brokers can majestically develop.","As for the modern monuments of new Paris, we would gladly forbear to speak of them. This is not because we do not admire them as they deserve. M. Soufflot’s Sainte-Geneviève is assuredly the best fancy cake that was ever made of stone. The Palace of the Legion of Honor is also a very elegant piece of confectionery. The dome of the Corn-market is an English jockey-cap on a large scale. The towers of Saint-Sulpice are two big clarionets, and that is a very good shape in its way; the telegraph wire, twisting and wriggling, makes a pretty diversity upon their roof. Saint-Roch has a doorway only comparable in magnificence to that of the church of Saint-Thomas d‘Aquin. It has also a Calvary in high relief in a cellar, and a sun made of gilded wood. These are very marvelous matters. The lantern in the labyrinth of the Botanical Garden, too, is very ingenious. As for the Exchange, which has a Greek colonnade, Roman semicircular arches over its doors and windows, and a great elliptic vault of the period of the Renaissance, it is undoubtedly a very correct and very pure piece of architecture: the proof being, that it is crowned with an attic such as Athens never saw,—a beautiful straight line gracefully broken here and there by chimney-pots. Let us add, that if it be the rule that the architectural design of a building should be adapted to its purpose, so that this purpose shall be self-evident from one look at the edifice, we cannot too much wonder at a public building which might be indifferently a royal palace, a House of Commons, a town-hall, a college, a riding-school, a warehouse, a courthouse, a museum, a barrack, a tomb, a temple, or a theater. And, after all, it is an Exchange! Moreover, a building should be appropriate to the climate. This is evidently built for our cold and rainy sky. It has a roof almost as flat as if it were in the Orient, so that in winter, when it snows, the roof can be swept; and it is evident that roofs were made to be swept. As for that purpose to which we alluded just now, it fulfils it marvellously well; it is an Exchange in France, as it would have been a temple in Greece. True, the architect took great pains to hide the face of the clock, which would have destroyed the purity of the fine lines of the front; but, to make amends for this, there is that colonnade which runs round the building, and under which, on high holidays or religious festivals, the theories of stock-brokers and exchange-agents may be solemnly unfolded.","So far as the modern monuments of new Paris are concerned, we would gladly be excused from mentioning them. It is not that we do not admire them as they deserve. The Sainte–Geneviève of M. Soufflot is certainly the finest Savoy cake that has ever been made in stone. The Palace of the Legion of Honor is also a very distinguished bit of pastry. The dome of the wheat market is an English jockey cap, on a grand scale. The towers of Saint–Sulpice are two huge clarinets, and the form is as good as any other; the telegraph, contorted and grimacing, forms an admirable accident upon their roofs. Saint–Roch has a door which, for magnificence, is comparable only to that of Saint–Thomas d'Aquin. It has, also, a crucifixion in high relief, in a cellar, with a sun of gilded wood. These things are fairly marvellous. The lantern of the labyrinth of the Jardin des Plantes is also very ingenious. As for the Palace of the Bourse, which is Greek as to its colonnade, Roman in the round arches of its doors and windows, of the Renaissance by virtue of its flattened vault, it is indubitably a very correct and very pure monument; the proof is that it is crowned with an attic, such as was never seen in Athens, a beautiful, straight line, gracefully broken here and there by stovepipes. Let us add that if it is according to rule that the architecture of a building should be adapted to its purpose in such a manner that this purpose shall be immediately apparent from the mere aspect of the building, one cannot be too much amazed at a structure which might be indifferently—the palace of a king, a chamber of communes, a town–hall, a college, a riding–school, an academy, a warehouse, a court–house, a museum, a barracks, a sepulchre, a temple, or a theatre. However, it is an Exchange. An edifice ought to be, moreover, suitable to the climate. This one is evidently constructed expressly for our cold and rainy skies. It has a roof almost as flat as roofs in the East, which involves sweeping the roof in winter, when it snows; and of course roofs are made to be swept. As for its purpose, of which we just spoke, it fulfils it to a marvel; it is a bourse in France as it would have been a temple in Greece. It is true that the architect was at a good deal of trouble to conceal the clock face, which would have destroyed the purity of the fine lines of the façade; but, on the other hand, we have that colonnade which circles round the edifice and under which, on days of high religious ceremony, the theories of the stock–brokers and the courtiers of commerce can be developed so majestically."

"Il attendait depuis un quart d’heure ; il lui semblait avoir vieilli d’un siècle. Tout à coup il entendit craquer les ais de l’escalier de bois. Quelqu’un montait. La trappe se rouvrit, une lumière reparut. Il y avait à la porte vermoulue de son bouge une fente assez large, il y colla son visage. De cette façon il pouvait voir tout ce qui se passait dans la chambre voisine.

"Avec le brusque soubresaut de cette araignée que nous avons vue se jeter sur une mouche au tremblement de sa toile, elle courut à sa lucarne, qui donnait, comme on sait, sur la place de Grève.

"Ce fut sans doute cette popularité, acquise à si juste titre, qui le préserva, à son entrée, de tout mauvais accueil de la part de la cohue, si mécontente le moment d’auparavant, et fort peu disposée au respect d’un cardinal le jour même où elle allait élire un pape. Mais les parisiens ont peu de rancune ; et puis, en faisant commencer la représentation d’autorité, les bons bourgeois l’avaient emporté sur le cardinal, et ce triomphe leur suffisait. D’ailleurs monsieur le cardinal de Bourbon était bel homme, il avait une fort belle robe rouge qu’il portait fort bien ; c’est dire qu’il avait pour lui toutes les femmes, et par conséquent la meilleure moitié de l’auditoire.

Moreover, the Cardinal de Bourbon was a handsome man, he had a very beautiful red dress which he wore very well; that is, he had all the women on his side, and therefore the better half of the audience.

Besides, the Cardinal was a remarkably handsome man; he had a very gorgeous red robe which was most becoming; which is as much as to say that all the women, and consequently the better half of the audience, were on his side.

"Cette nuit-là donc, Quasimodo, après avoir donné un coup d’œil à ses pauvres cloches si délaissées, à Jacqueline, à Marie, à Thibauld, était monté jusque sur le sommet de la tour septentrionale, et là, posant sur les plombs sa lanterne sourde bien fermée, il s’était mis à regarder Paris. La nuit, nous l’avons déjà dit, était fort obscure. Paris, qui n’était, pour ainsi dire, pas éclairé à cette époque, présentait à l’œil un amas confus de masses noires, coupé çà et là par la courbe blanchâtre de la Seine. Quasimodo n’y voyait plus de lumière qu’à une fenêtre d’un édifice éloigné dont le vague et sombre profil se dessinait bien au-dessus des toits, du côté de la Porte Saint-Antoine. Là aussi il y avait quelqu’un qui veillait.","That night, therefore, Quasimodo, after having given a glance at his poor so neglected bells, at Jacqueline, at Marie, at Thibauld, had climbed to the top of the northern tower, and there, posing on the leads his dark lantern firmly closed, he had begun to look at Paris. The night, as we have already said, was very dark. Paris, which was, so to speak, not lit at that time, presented to the eye a confused cluster of black masses, cut here and there by the whitish curve of the Seine. Quasimodo could only see light there from a window of a distant building, the vague and somber profile of which stood out high above the roofs, on the side of the Porte Saint-Antoine. There too there was someone watching.","That night, then, Quasimodo, after giving a glance at his poor forsaken bells,—at Jacqueline, Marie, and Thibauld—had ascended to the roof of the north tower, and there, placing his well-closed dark-lantern upon the leads, gazed out over Paris. The night, as we have already said, was very dark. Paris, which at this time was but scantily lighted, presented to the eye a confused collection of black masses, intersected here and there by the silvery bend of the Seine. Quasimodo saw but a single light, and that in the window of a distant structure, the dim, dark outlines of which were distinctly visible above the roofs, in the direction of Porte Saint-Antoine. There, too, some one was watching.","On that night, accordingly, Quasimodo, after having cast a glance at his poor bells which he so neglected now, Jacqueline, Marie, and Thibauld, mounted to the summit of the Northern tower, and there setting his dark lanturn, well closed, upon the leads, he began to gaze at Paris. The night, as we have already said, was very dark. Paris which, so to speak was not lighted at that epoch, presented to the eye a confused collection of black masses, cut here and there by the whitish curve of the Seine.

"Toutefois, avec tant de motifs de prendre la vie en patience et en joie, messire Robert d’Estouteville s’était éveillé le matin du 7 janvier 1482 fort bourru et de massacrante humeur. D’où venait cette humeur? c’est ce qu’il n’aurait pu dire lui-même. Était-ce que le ciel était gris ? que la boucle de son vieux ceinturon de Montlhéry était mal serrée, et sanglait trop militairement son embonpoint de prévôt? qu’il avait vu passer dans la rue sous sa fenêtre des ribauds lui faisant nargue, allant quatre de bande, pourpoint sans chemise, chapeau sans fond, bissac et bouteille au côté ? Était-ce pressentiment vague des trois cent soixante-dix livres seize sols huit deniers que le futur roi Charles VIII devait l’année suivante retrancher des revenus de la prévôté ?

Where did this mood come from? that's what he couldn't have said himself. Was the sky gray? that the buckle of his old Montlhéry belt was loosely tightened, and strapped too militarily his plumpness as a provost? whom he had seen pass in the street under his window of the chicks mocking him, going four of gang, doublet without shirt, hat without bottom, bissac and bottle to the side? Was this vague premonition of the three hundred and seventy pounds sixteen sols eight deniers that the future King Charles VIII was to cut from the provost's income the following year? The reader can choose; as for us, we would be inclined to think simply that he was in a bad mood, because he was in a bad mood.","And yet, with all these motives for taking life patiently and pleasantly, Master Robert d‘Estouteville waked on the morning of Jan. 7, 1482, in a very sulky and disagreeable mood. Whence came this ill-humor? He could not have told you himself. Was it because the sky was overcast; because the buckle of his old Montlhéry belt was fastened too tight, and girt his provostship’s goodly portliness in too military a fashion; because he had seen a band of ragamuffins march through the street below his window, mocking him as they passed in double file, wearing doublets without shirts, crownless hats, and wallet and flask at their side? Was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy pounds, sixteen pence, and eight farthings which the future king, Charles VIII, was to cut off from the revenues of the provosty? The reader can take his choice; as for us, we incline to the belief that he was out of temper simply because he was out of temper.","Nevertheless, with so many reasons for taking life patiently and joyously, Messire Robert d'Estouteville woke up on the morning of the seventh of January, 1482, in a very surly and peevish mood. Whence came this ill temper? He could not have told himself. Was it because the sky was gray? or was the buckle of his old belt of Montlhéry badly fastened, so that it confined his provostal portliness too closely? had he beheld ribald fellows, marching in bands of four, beneath his window, and setting him at defiance, in doublets but no shirts, hats without crowns, with wallet and bottle at their side? Was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy livres, sixteen sous, eight farthings, which the future King Charles VII. was to cut off from the provostship in the following year?

"Cependant, quand le soleil du moyen âge est tout à fait couché, quand le génie gothique s’est à jamais éteint à l’horizon de l’art, l’architecture va se ternissant, se décolorant, s’effaçant de plus en plus. Le livre imprimé, ce ver rongeur de l’édifice, la suce et la dévore. Elle se dépouille, elle s’effeuille, elle maigrit à vue d’œil. Elle est mesquine, elle est pauvre, elle est nulle. Elle n’exprime plus rien, pas même le souvenir de l’art d’un autre temps. Réduite à elle-même, abandonnée des autres arts parce que la pensée humaine l’abandonne, elle appelle des manœuvres à défaut d’artistes. La vitre remplace le vitrail. Le tailleur de pierre succède au sculpteur. Adieu toute sève, toute originalité, toute vie, toute intelligence. Elle se traîne, lamentable mendiante d’atelier, de copie en copie. Michel-Ange, qui dès le seizième siècle la sentait sans doute mourir, avait eu une dernière idée, une idée de désespoir. Ce titan de l’art avait entassé le Panthéon sur le Parthénon, et fait Saint-Pierre de Rome. Grande œuvre qui méritait de rester unique, dernière originalité de l’architecture, signature d’un artiste géant au bas du colossal registre de pierre qui se fermait. Michel-Ange mort, que fait cette misérable architecture qui se survivait à elle-même à l’état de spectre et d’ombre? Elle prend Saint-Pierre de Rome, et le calque, et le parodie. C'est une manie. C'est une pitié. Chaque siècle a son Saint-Pierre de Rome ; au dix-septième siècle le Val-de-Grâce, au dix-huitième Sainte-Geneviève. Chaque pays a son Saint-Pierre de Rome. Londres a le sien. Pétersbourg a le sien. Paris en a deux ou trois. Testament insignifiant, dernier radotage d’un grand art décrépit qui retombe en enfance avant de mourir.","However, when the sun of the Middle Ages is completely down, when the Gothic genius is forever extinguished on the horizon of art, the architecture goes tarnishing, fading, fading more and more . The printed book, this edifice gnawing worm, sucks and devours her. She is stripping, she is stripping, she is visibly thinning. She's mean, she's poor, she sucks. She no longer expresses anything, not even the memory of the art of another time. Reduced to itself, abandoned by the other arts because human thought abandons it, it calls for maneuvers in the absence of artists. The glass replaces the stained glass. The stonemason succeeds the sculptor. Goodbye all sap, all originality, all life, all intelligence. She dragged herself along, a miserable workshop beggar, from copy to copy. Michelangelo, who from the sixteenth century no doubt felt her dying, had had a last idea, an idea of despair. This titan of art had crowded the Pantheon onto the Parthenon, and made St. Peter of Rome. A great work that deserved to remain unique, the latest architectural originality, the signature of a giant artist at the bottom of the colossal stone register that closed. Michelangelo dead, what is this miserable architecture doing, surviving itself in the state of specter and shadow? She takes St. Peter's in Rome, and copies it, and parodies it. It's a fad. It's a pity. Each century has its Saint-Pierre de Rome; in the seventeenth century the Val-de-Grâce, in the eighteenth Sainte-Geneviève. Each country has its St. Peter's in Rome. London has its own.

It ceased to express anything, even the memory of the art of former ages. Reduced to itself, abandoned by the other arts because human thought has abandoned it, it calls in journeymen for lack of artists; plain glass takes the place of painted windows; the stonecutter succeeds the sculptor. Farewell to all vigor, originality, life, and intellect. Architecture now crawled, like a pitiful beggar of the studios, from copy to copy. Michael Angelo, who had doubtless foreseen its death from the dawn of the sixteenth century, had a last inspiration,—the inspiration of despair. That Titan of art piled the Pantheon upon the Parthenon, and created St. Peter’s Church at Rome.

Michael Angelo dead, what did this wretched architecture do, which survived itself in a spectral, ghost-like state? It took St. Peter’s at Rome, copied it, and parodied it. It was mere mania. It was pitiable. Every century had its St. Peter’s; in the seventeenth century it was the Val-de-Grâce, in the eighteenth, Sainte-Geneviève. Every country had its St. Peter’s; London had its own; St. Petersburg had its own; Paris had two or three,—a worthless legacy, the last unmeaning drivel of a great art grown old and reduced to dotage before it died!","Nevertheless, when the sun of the Middle Ages is completely set, when the Gothic genius is forever extinct upon the horizon, architecture grows dim, loses its color, becomes more and more effaced.

He thus advanced through the thickest of the cavalry, with the quiet slowness, the nodding of his head and the regular breathlessness of a reaper cutting into a field of wheat. It was Clopin Trouillefou. An arquebus shot downed him.","One man had a large shining scythe, with which he mowed the legs of the horses. It was a frightful sight.

"Pour le spectateur qui arrivait essoufflé sur ce faîte, c’était d’abord un éblouissement de toits, de cheminées, de rues, de ponts, de places, de flèches, de clochers.

"Les grands édifices, comme les grandes montagnes, sont l’ouvrage des siècles. Souvent l’art se transforme qu’ils pendent encore : pendent opera interrupta; ils se continuent paisiblement selon l’art transformé.

The thing is accomplished without disturbance, without effort, without reaction, according to a natural and quiet law.

Of course, there is material for very big books, and often the universal history of mankind, in these successive welds of several arts at different heights on the same monument.

Il y a encore un coquin d’arbre qu’on appelle le luxurieux, pour avoir servi aux plaisirs d’une princesse fameuse et d’un connétable de France galant et bel esprit. – Hélas ! nous autres pauvres philosophes nous sommes à un connétable ce qu’un carré de choux et de radis est au jardin du Louvre.

"Sans doute la Esmeralda ne songeait pas au capitaine sans amertume. Sans doute il était affreux qu’il eût été trompé aussi lui, qu’il eût cru cette chose impossible, qu’il eût pu comprendre un coup de poignard venu de celle qui eût donné mille vies pour lui. Mais enfin, il ne fallait pas trop lui en vouloir: n’avait-elle pas avoué son crime ? n’avait-elle pas cédé, faible femme, à la torture ? Toute la faute était à elle. Elle aurait dû se laisser arracher les ongles plutôt qu’une telle parole. Enfin, qu’elle revît Phœbus une seule fois, une seule minute, il ne faudrait qu’un mot, qu’un regard pour le détromper, pour le ramener. Elle n’en doutait pas. Elle s’étourdissait aussi sur beaucoup de choses singulières, sur le hasard de la présence de Phœbus le jour de l’amende honorable, sur la jeune fille avec laquelle il était. C'était sa sœur sans doute. Explication déraisonnable, mais dont elle se contentait, parce qu’elle avait besoin de croire que Phœbus l’aimait toujours et n’aimait qu’elle. Ne lui avait-il pas juré ? Que lui fallait-il de plus, naïve et crédule qu’elle était ? Et puis, dans cette affaire, les apparences n’étaient-elles pas bien plutôt contre elle que contre lui ? Elle attendait donc.

No doubt it was dreadful that he too had been deceived, that he had believed this thing impossible, that he could have understood a stab from the one who would have given a thousand lives for him. But anyway, you couldn't blame her too much: hadn't she confessed to her crime? had she not given in, weak woman, to torture? It was all her fault. She should have let her fingernails pulled out rather than such a word. Finally, if she saw Phoebus again just once, a single minute, it would only take a word, a glance to undeceive him, to bring him back. She didn't doubt it. She was also giddy over many peculiar things, over the chance of Phoebus being present on the day of the honorable fine, over the young girl he was with. It was his sister, no doubt. An unreasonable explanation, but one that she was satisfied with, because she needed to believe that Phoebus still loved her and only loved her. Hadn't he sworn to her? What more did she need, naive and gullible that she was? And then, in this case, weren't appearances more against her than against him? So she was waiting. She hoped.","Undoubtedly Esmeralda’s thoughts of the captain were tinged with bitterness. Undoubtedly it was frightful that he too should have been deceived, he who should have deemed such a thing impossible,—that he should have believed the stab to come from her, who would have given a thousand lives for him. But, after all, she must not blame him too severely; had she not confessed her crime? Had she not, weak woman that she was, yielded to torture? The fault was wholly hers. She should have let them tear out every nail rather than wrest a single word from her. Well, could she but see Phœbus once more, for one moment only, it would need but a word, a look, to undeceive him, to bring him back. She had no doubts in the matter. She also strove to account to herself for various strange facts,—for the accident of Phœbus’s presence on the day of her doing penance, and for the young girl with whom he was. Probably she was his sister. An improbable explanation, but one with which she contented herself, because she needed to believe that Phœbus still loved her, and loved her alone. Had he not sworn it to her? What more did she want, simple, credulous girl that she was? And then, in this business, were not appearances much more against her than against him? She therefore waited; she hoped.","La Esmeralda did not think of the captain without bitterness, no doubt.

"C'est un édifice de la transition.

"Une autre fois, il se présenta à la porte de la cellule (où il n’entrait jamais) au moment où la Esmeralda chantait une vieille ballade espagnole, dont elle ne comprenait pas les paroles, mais qui était restée dans son oreille parce que les bohémiennes l’en avaient bercée tout enfant.

The hapless bell ringer fell to his knees in the doorway and pleadingly clasped his large, shapeless hands. - Oh ! he said painfully, I beg you to continue and do not chase me away. - She did not want to distress him, and, all trembling, resumed her romance. By degrees, however, her dread dissipated, and she let herself go completely to the impression of the melancholy and dragging air which she was singing.

"Le lecteur n’a peut-être pas oublié qu’une partie de la Cour des Miracles était enclose par l’ancien mur d’enceinte de la ville, dont bon nombre de tours commençaient dès cette époque à tomber en ruine. L'une de ces tours avait été convertie en lieu de plaisir par les truands. Il y avait cabaret dans la salle basse, et le reste dans les étages supérieurs. Cette tour était le point le plus vivant et par conséquent le plus hideux de la truanderie. C'était une sorte de ruche monstrueuse qui y bourdonnait nuit et jour. La nuit, quand tout le surplus de la gueuserie dormait, quand il n’y avait plus une fenêtre allumée sur les façades terreuses de la place, quand on n’entendait plus sortir un cri de ces innombrables maisonnées, de ces fourmilières de voleurs, de filles et d’enfants volés ou bâtards, on reconnaissait toujours la joyeuse tour au bruit qu’elle faisait, à la lumière écarlate qui, rayonnant à la fois aux soupiraux, aux fenêtres, aux fissures des murs lézardés, s’échappait pour ainsi dire de tous ses pores.","The reader may not have forgotten that part of the Court of Miracles was enclosed by the ancient city wall, many of the towers of which were starting to crumble by this time. One of these towers had been converted into a place of pleasure by the mobsters. There was a cabaret in the lower hall, and the rest on the upper floors. This tower was the most alive and therefore the most hideous point of the crook. It was a sort of monstrous hive that buzzed there night and day. At night, when all the surplus of the gueuserie slept, when there was no longer a lighted window on the earthy facades of the square, when a cry could no longer be heard issuing from these innumerable households, from these anthills of thieves, of girls and stolen or bastard children, we always recognized the merry tower by the noise it made, by the scarlet light which, shining at the same time from the basement windows, from the windows, from the cracks in the cracked walls, thus escaped tell from all his pores.","The reader may remember that a part of the Court of Miracles was enclosed by the ancient boundary wall of the city, many of whose towers had at this time begun to fall into ruin. One of these towers had been made into a pleasure-house by the Vagabonds. There was a tavern in the lower portion, and other things above. This tower was the most lively and consequently the most horrible spot in the Vagrant community. It was a sort of monstrous bee-hive, which buzzed and hummed night and day. At night, when all the surplus beggars were asleep, when there was not a window still lighted in any of the dirty houses in the square, when no sound was longer to be heard from any of the innumerable hovels, the abode of swarms of thieves, prostitutes, and stolen children or foundlings, the jolly tower might always be known by the noise which rose from it, by the red light which, beaming alike from chimneys, windows, and cracks in the crumbling walls, escaped, as it were, at every pore.","The reader has probably not forgotten that a part of the Cour de Miracles was enclosed by the ancient wall which surrounded the city, a goodly number of whose towers had begun, even at that epoch, to fall to ruin.

This was the most lively, and consequently the most hideous, point of the whole outcast den. It was a sort of monstrous hive, which buzzed there night and day.

"À n’envisager ici que l’architecture européenne chrétienne, cette sœur puînée des grandes maçonneries de l’Orient, elle apparaît aux yeux comme une immense formation divisée en trois zones bien tranchées qui se superposent : la zone romane1, la zone gothique, la zone de la Renaissance, que nous appellerions volontiers gréco-romaine. La couche romane, qui est la plus ancienne et la plus profonde, est occupée par le plein cintre, qui reparaît porté par la colonne grecque dans la couche moderne et supérieure de la Renaissance. L'ogive est entre deux. Les édifices qui appartiennent exclusivement à l’une de ces trois couches sont parfaitement distincts, uns et complets. C'est l’abbaye de Jumièges, c’est la cathédrale de Reims, c’est Sainte-Croix d’Orléans. Mais les trois zones se mêlent et s’amalgament par les bords, comme les couleurs dans le spectre solaire. De là les monuments complexes, les édifices de nuance et de transition. L'un est roman par les pieds, gothique au milieu, gréco-romain par la tête. C'est qu’on a mis six cents ans à le bâtir. Cette variété est rare. Le donjon d’Étampes en est un échantillon. Mais les monuments de deux formations sont plus fréquents. C'est Notre-Dame de Paris, édifice ogival, qui s’enfonce par ses premiers piliers dans cette zone romane où sont plongés le portail de Saint-Denis et la nef de Saint-Germain-des-Prés. C'est la charmante salle capitulaire demi-gothique de Bocherville à laquelle la couche romane vient jusqu’à mi-corps. C'est la cathédrale de Rouen qui serait entièrement gothique si elle ne baignait pas l’extrémité de sa flèche centrale dans la zone de la Renaissance2.","Considering here only Christian European architecture, this younger sister of the great masonry of the East, it appears to the eyes as an immense formation divided into three clearly marked zones which overlap: the Romanesque zone1, the Gothic zone, the Renaissance zone, which we would like to call Greco-Roman. The Roman layer, which is the oldest and the deepest, is occupied by the semicircular arch, which reappears carried by the Greek column in the modern and upper layer of the Renaissance. The warhead is in between. Buildings that belong exclusively to one of these three layers are perfectly distinct, one and complete. It is Jumièges Abbey, it is Reims Cathedral, it is Sainte-Croix d´Orléans. But the three areas intertwine and merge at the edges, like the colors in the solar spectrum. Hence the complex monuments, the edifices of shade and transition. One is Roman by the feet, Gothic in the middle, Greco-Roman by the head. It is because it took six hundred years to build it. This variety is rare. The Dungeon of Etampes is a sample of this. But the monuments of two formations are more frequent. It is Notre-Dame de Paris, an ogival edifice, which sinks through its first pillars into this Romanesque area where the portal of Saint-Denis and the nave of Saint-Germain-des-Prés are plunged. It is the charming semi-Gothic chapter house of Bocherville in which the Romanesque layer comes down to mid-length. It is Rouen Cathedral which would be entirely Gothic if it did not bathe the end of its central spire in the Renaissance zone2.","Considering here Christian European architecture only, that younger sister of the grand piles of the Orient, we may say that it strikes the eye as a vast formation divided into three very distinct zones or layers, one resting upon the other; the Roman zone,at the Gothic zone, the zone of the Renaissance, which may be called the Greco-Roman. The Romans stratum, which is the oldest and the lowest, is occupied by the semicircular arch, which reappears, together with the Greek column, in the modern and uppermost stratum of the Renaissance. The pointed arch is between the two. The buildings belonging to any one of these three strata are perfectly distinct, uniform, and complete. Such are the Abbey of Jumiéges, the Cathedral of Rheims, the Church of the Holy Cross at Orleans. But the three zones are blended and mingled at the edges, like the colors in the solar spectrum. Hence, we have certain complex structures, buildings of gradation and transition, which may be Roman at the base, Gothic in the middle, and Greco-Roman at the top. This is caused by the fact that it took six hundred years to build such a fabric. This variety is rare. The donjon-keep at Etampes is a specimen. But monuments of two formations are more frequent. Such is Notre-Dame de Paris, a structure of the pointed arch, its earliest columns leading directly to that Roman zone, of which the portal of Saint-Denis and the nave of Saint-Germain-des-Prés are perfect specimens. Such is the charming semi-Gothic chapter-house of Bocherville, where the Roman layer reaches midway. Such is the cathedral of Rouen, which would be wholly Gothic if the tip of its central spire did not dip into the zone of the Renaissance.au","Not to consider here anything except the Christian architecture of Europe, that younger sister of the great masonries of the Orient, it appears to the eyes as an immense formation divided into three well–defined zones, which are superposed, the one upon the other: the Romanesque zone[20], the Gothic zone, the zone of the Renaissance, which we would gladly call the Greco–Roman zone.

"– Je suis au bout de ma finance, poursuivit le docteur, et il serait vraiment dommage que la maison n’eût pas de toit.

Il y a aussi une Cérès. C'est encore une très belle divinité. Elle est assise sur des gerbes de blé, et coiffée d’une guirlande galante d’épis entrelacés de salsifis et autres fleurs. Il ne se peut rien voir de plus amoureux que ses yeux, de plus rond que ses jambes, de plus noble que son air, de mieux drapé que sa jupe. C'est une des beautés les plus innocentes et les plus parfaites qu’ait produites le pinceau.","'I'm at the end of my finances,' the doctor continued, 'and it would be a shame if the house didn't have a roof.

There is a Diana in the air who flies, but so excellent, so tender, so delicate, of such ingenuous action, her head so well groomed and crowned with a crescent, the flesh so white that it gives temptation to those who look at her too curiously. There is also a Ceres. He is still a very beautiful deity. She is seated on sheaves of wheat, and wearing a gallant garland of ears intertwined with salsify and other flowers. Nothing can be seen more in love than her eyes, more round than her legs, more noble than her air, better draped than her skirt.

"Dom Claude Frollo n’avait abandonné du reste ni la science, ni l’éducation de son jeune frère, ces deux occupations de sa vie. Mais avec le temps il s’était mêlé quelque amertume à ces choses si douces. À la longue, dit Paul Diacre, le meilleur lard rancit. Le petit Jehan Frollo, surnommé du Moulin à cause du lieu où il avait été nourri, n’avait pas grandi dans la direction que Claude avait voulu lui imprimer. Le grand frère comptait sur un élève pieux, docile, docte, honorable. Or le petit frère, comme ces jeunes arbres qui trompent l’effort du jardinier et se tournent opiniâtrement du côté d’où leur viennent l’air et le soleil, le petit frère ne croissait et ne multipliait, ne poussait de belles branches touffues et luxuriantes que du côté de la paresse, de l’ignorance et de la débauche. C'était un vrai diable, fort désordonné, ce qui faisait froncer le sourcil à dom Claude, mais fort drôle et fort subtil, ce qui faisait sourire le grand frère. Claude l’avait confié à ce même collège de Torchi où il avait passé ses premières années dans l’étude et le recueillement ; et c’était une douleur pour lui que ce sanctuaire autrefois édifié du nom de Frollo en fût scandalisé aujourd’hui. Il en faisait quelquefois à Jehan de fort sévères et de fort longs sermons, que celui-ci essuyait intrépidement. Après tout, le jeune vaurien avait bon cœur, comme cela se voit dans toutes les comédies. Mais, le sermon passé, il n’en reprenait pas moins tranquillement le cours de ses séditions et de ses énormités. Tantôt c’était un béjaune (on appelait ainsi les nouveaux débarqués à l’Université) qu’il avait houspillé pour sa bienvenue ; tradition précieuse qui s’est soigneusement perpétuée jusqu’à nos jours. Tantôt il avait donné le branle à une bande d’écoliers, lesquels étaient classiquement jetés sur un cabaret, quasi classico excitati, puis avaient battu le tavernier « avec bâtons offensifs », et joyeusement pillé la taverne jusqu’à effondrer les muids de vin dans la cave. Et puis, c’était un beau rapport en latin que le sous-moniteur de Torchi apportait piteusement à dom Claude avec cette douloureuse émargination : Rixa ; prima causa vinum optimum potatum. Enfin on disait, horreur dans un enfant de seize ans, que ses débordements allaient souventes fois jusqu’à la rue de Glatigny.","Dom Claude Frollo had not given up either science or the education of his younger brother, these two occupations of his life. But with time some bitterness had mingled with these sweet things. In the long run, says Paul Deacon, the best bacon turns rancid. Little Jehan Frollo, nicknamed du Moulin because of the place where he had been fed, had not grown in the direction Claude had wanted to give him. The big brother was counting on a pious, docile, learned, honorable pupil. Now the little brother, like those young trees which deceive the gardener's effort and stubbornly turn towards the side from which they come from the air and the sun, the little brother neither grew nor multiplied, did not grow beautiful bushy branches and lush than on the side of laziness, ignorance and debauchery. He was a real devil, very messy, which made Dom Claude frown, but very funny and very subtle, which made the big brother smile. Claude had entrusted him to the same college in Torchi where he had spent his early years in study and meditation; and it was a pain for him that this once-built sanctuary called Frollo was scandalized by it today. He sometimes made very severe and very long sermons to Jehan, which the latter endured intrepidly. After all, the young rascal had a good heart, as it shows in all comedies. But, the sermon over, he nonetheless quietly resumed the course of his seditions and enormities. Sometimes it was a bejaune (so called the new arrivals at the University) that he had scolded for his welcome; a precious tradition that has carefully continued to this day. At one time he had set in motion a group of schoolchildren, who were classically thrown at a cabaret, almost classico excitati, then had beaten the tavern keeper ""with offensive sticks"", and merrily plundered the tavern until the wine barrels collapsed in The cave. And then, it was a beautiful report in Latin that Torchi's sub-instructor pitifully brought to Dom Claude with this painful emargination: Rixa; prima causa vinum optimum potatum. Finally, it was said, horror in a sixteen-year-old child, that his excesses often went as far as the rue de Glatigny.","Now, Dombg Claude Frollo had not given up either science or the education of his younger brother,—those two occupations of his life. But time had imparted a slight bitterness to these things once so sweet. “The best bacon in the world,” says Paul Diacre, “grows rancid at last.” Little Jehan Frollo, surnamed “du Moulin,” from the place where he was put to nurse, had not grown up in the path in which Claude would have led him. The big brother expected him to be a pious, docile, studious, honorable pupil. Now, the little brother, like those young trees which foil the gardener’s every effort, and turn obstinately towards the sun and air,—the little brother only grew and flourished, only put forth fine leafy and luxuriant branches, in the direction of idleness, ignorance, and debauchery. He was a perfect imp, utterly lawless, which made Dom Claude frown; but very shrewd and witty, which made the big brother smile. Claude had confided him to that same College of Torchi where he had passed his own early years in study and meditation; and it cost him many a pang that this sanctuary once so edified by the name of Frollo should now be scandalized by it. He sometimes read Jehan very long and very severe lectures on this text, but the latter bore them without wincing. After all, the young scamp had a good heart, as every comedy shows us is always the case. But the lecture over, he resumed his riotous ways with perfect tranquillity. Now it was a yellow beak (as newcomers at the University were called) whom he mauled for his entrance fee,—a precious tradition which has been carefully handed down to the present day. Now he headed a band of students who had fallen upon some tavern in classic style, quasi classico excitati, then beaten the landlord “with offensive cudgels,” and merrily sacked the house, even to staving in the casks of wine in the cellar; and then it was a fine report in Latin which the submonitor of Torchi brought ruefully to Dom Claude, with this melancholy marginal note: “Rixa; prima causa vinum optimum potatum.”bh Lastly, it was reported—horrible to relate of a sixteen-year-old lad—that his excesses often took him even to the Rue de Glatigny.bi","Dom Claude Frollo had, however, abandoned neither science nor the education of his young brother, those two occupations of his life. But as time went on, some bitterness had been mingled with these things which were so sweet. In the long run, says Paul Diacre, the best lard turns rancid.

The big brother counted upon a pious, docile, learned, and honorable pupil.

He was a regular devil, and a very disorderly one, who made Dom Claude scowl; but very droll and very subtle, which made the big brother smile. Claude had confided him to that same college of Torchi where he had passed his early years in study and meditation; and it was a grief to him that this sanctuary, formerly edified by the name of Frollo, should to–day be scandalized by it.

Il les tenait sans cesse attachés sur la bohémienne, et tandis que la folle jeune fille de seize ans dansait et voltigeait au plaisir de tous, sa rêverie, à lui, semblait devenir de plus en plus sombre.

"Cette cellule était célèbre dans Paris depuis près de trois siècles que madame Rolande de la Tour-Roland, en deuil de son père mort à la croisade, l’avait fait creuser dans la muraille de sa propre maison pour s’y enfermer à jamais, ne gardant de son palais que ce logis dont la porte était murée et la lucarne ouverte, hiver comme été, donnant tout le reste aux pauvres et à Dieu. La désolée demoiselle avait en effet attendu vingt ans la mort dans cette tombe anticipée, priant nuit et jour pour l’âme de son père, dormant dans la cendre, sans même avoir une pierre pour oreiller, vêtue d’un sac noir, et ne vivant que de ce que la pitié des passants déposait de pain et d’eau sur le rebord de sa lucarne, recevant ainsi la charité après l’avoir faite. À sa mort, au moment de passer dans l’autre sépulcre, elle avait légué à perpétuité celui-ci aux femmes affligées, mères, veuves ou filles, qui auraient beaucoup à prier pour autrui ou pour elles, et qui voudraient s’enterrer vives dans une grande douleur ou dans une grande pénitence. Les pauvres de son temps lui avaient fait de belles funérailles de larmes et de bénédictions ; mais, à leur grand regret, la pieuse fille n’avait pu être canonisée sainte, faute de protections. Ceux d’entre eux qui étaient un peu impies avaient espéré que la chose se ferait en paradis plus aisément qu’à Rome, et avaient tout bonnement prié Dieu pour la défunte, à défaut du pape. La plupart s’étaient contentés de tenir la mémoire de Rolande pour sacrée et de faire reliques de ses haillons. La ville, de son côté, avait fondé, à l’intention de la demoiselle, un bréviaire public qu’on avait scellé près de la lucarne de la cellule, afin que les passants s’y arrêtassent de temps à autre, ne fût-ce que pour prier, que la prière fît songer à l’aumône, et que les pauvres recluses, héritières du caveau de madame Rolande, n’y mourussent pas tout à fait de faim et d’oubli.","This cell had been famous in Paris for nearly three centuries when Madame Rolande de la Tour-Roland, in mourning for her father who died in the Crusade, had had it dug in the wall of her own house to lock herself there forever, keeping of his palace only this dwelling whose door was walled up and the skylight open, winter and summer, giving all the rest to the poor and to God. The sorry young lady had indeed waited twenty years for death in this anticipated tomb, praying night and day for the soul of her father, sleeping in the ashes, without even having a stone for a pillow, dressed in a black bag, and not alive only from what the pity of passers-by deposited bread and water on the edge of his window, thus receiving charity after having done it. When she died, when she passed into the other sepulcher, she had bequeathed it in perpetuity to the afflicted women, mothers, widows or daughters, who would have much to pray for others or for themselves, and who would like to bury themselves alive. in great pain or in great penance. The poor of his time had given him a beautiful funeral of tears and blessings; but, to their great regret, the pious girl could not be canonized a saint for lack of protections. Those of them who were a little godless had hoped that the thing would be done in Paradise more easily than in Rome, and had simply prayed to God for the deceased, in default of the Pope. Most had contented themselves with holding Rolande's memory sacred and making relics of her rags. The town, for its part, had founded a public breviary for the young lady, which had been sealed near the window of the cell, so that passers-by would stop there from time to time. what to pray, that the prayer makes one think of alms, and that the poor recluses, heiresses of the vault of Madame Rolande, did not die there altogether of hunger and oblivion.","This cell has been celebrated throughout Paris for almost three centuries; since Madame Rolande, of the Tour-Roland, being in mourning for her father, who died while on a Crusade, had it hewed out of the wall of her own house and shut herself up in it forever, keeping no part of her palace but this one lodging , the door of which was walled up and the window open, in winter as in summer, giving all the rest of her property to God and the poor. The desolate dame did indeed await death for twenty years within this premature tomb, praying night and day for her father’s soul, sleeping upon a bed of ashes, without even a stone for pillow, clad in black sack-cloth, and living on such portions of bread and water as the pity of the passers-by placed on her window-sill; thus accepting charity after having bestowed it. At her death, as she was about to pass to another tomb, she bequeathed this one in perpetuity to all afflicted women, mothers, widows, or daughters, who had great need to pray for others or themselves, and who wished to bury themselves alive in token of their great grief or great penitence. The poor of her time paid her the best of funeral rites in their tears and blessings; but, to their great regret, the pious dame could not be canonized a saint, for lack of patronage. Those of them who were inclined to be impious hoped that the matter might be more readily arranged in paradise than at Rome, and quite simply prayed to God instead of to the Pope, for the deceased. Most of them were satisfied with holding her memory sacred and making relics of her rags. The city, for its part, founded for the lady’s sake a public breviary, which was fastened to the wall near the window of the cell, so that those who passed might occasionally stop, if only to pray, that so the prayer might lead them to think of alms, and that the poor recluses, the heirs of Madame Rolande’s cell, might not die of hunger and neglect.","This little cell had been celebrated in Paris for nearly three centuries, ever since Madame Rolande de la Tour–Roland, in mourning for her father who died in the Crusades, had caused it to be hollowed out in the wall of her own house, in order to immure herself there forever, keeping of all her palace only this lodging whose door was walled up, and whose window stood open, winter and summer, giving all the rest to the poor and to God. The afflicted damsel had, in fact, waited twenty years for death in this premature tomb, praying night and day for the soul of her father, sleeping in ashes, without even a stone for a pillow, clothed in a black sack, and subsisting on the bread and water which the compassion of the passers–by led them to deposit on the ledge of her window, thus receiving charity after having bestowed it. At her death, at the moment when she was passing to the other sepulchre, she had bequeathed this one in perpetuity to afflicted women, mothers, widows, or maidens, who should wish to pray much for others or for themselves, and who should desire to inter themselves alive in a great grief or a great penance. The poor of her day had made her a fine funeral, with tears and benedictions; but, to their great regret, the pious maid had not been canonized, for lack of influence. Those among them who were a little inclined to impiety, had hoped that the matter might be accomplished in Paradise more easily than at Rome, and had frankly besought God, instead of the pope, in behalf of the deceased. The majority had contented themselves with holding the memory of Rolande sacred, and converting her rags into relics. The city, on its side, had founded in honor of the damoiselle, a public breviary, which had been fastened near the window of the cell, in order that passers–by might halt there from time to time, were it only to pray; that prayer might remind them of alms, and that the poor recluses, heiresses of Madame Rolande's vault, might not die outright of hunger and forgetfulness."

"Non qu’il fût profond politique, et qu’il se fît une affaire des suites possibles du mariage de madame sa cousine Marguerite de Bourgogne avec monsieur son cousin Charles, dauphin de Vienne ; combien durerait la bonne intelligence plâtrée du duc d’Autriche et du roi de France, comment le roi d’Angleterre prendrait ce dédain de sa fille, cela l’inquiétait peu, et il fêtait chaque soir le vin du cru royal de Chaillot, sans se douter que quelques flacons de ce même vin (un peu revu et corrigé, il est vrai, par le médecin Coictier), cordialement offerts à Edouard IV par Louis XI, débarrasseraient un beau matin Louis XI d’Edouard IV. La moult honorée ambassade de monsieur le duc d’Autriche n’apportait au cardinal aucun de ces soucis, mais elle l’importunait par un autre côté. Il était en effet un peu dur, et nous en avons déjà dit un mot à la deuxième page de ce livre, d’être obligé de faire fête et bon accueil, lui Charles de Bourbon, à je ne sais quels bourgeois ; lui cardinal, à des échevins ; lui français, joyeux convive, à des flamands buveurs de bière ; et cela en public. C'était là, certes, une des plus fastidieuses grimaces qu’il eût jamais faites pour le bon plaisir du roi.","Not that he was deeply political, and that he cared about the possible consequences of the marriage of his cousin Marguerite of Burgundy with his cousin Charles, Dauphin of Vienna; how long the plastered good intelligence of the Duke of Austria and the King of France would last, how the King of England would take this disdain of his daughter, that worried him little, and he celebrated every evening the wine of the royal vintage of Chaillot, without to suspect that a few bottles of this same wine (a little revised and corrected, it is true, by the doctor Coictier), cordially offered to Edward IV by Louis XI, would one fine morning rid Louis XI of Edward IV. The honored embassy of the Duke of Austria did not bring the cardinal any of these worries, but it annoyed him in another way. He was indeed a little harsh, and we have already said a word about it on the second page of this book, to be obliged to give a warm welcome, he Charles of Bourbon, to I do not know what bourgeois; he cardinal, to aldermen; he French, happy guest, to Flemish beer-drinkers; and that in public. It was, of course, one of the most tiresome grimaces he had ever made for the king's pleasure.","Not that he was much of a politician, or that he troubled himself much about the possible results of the marriage of his cousin, Lady Margaret of Burgundy, with his cousin Charles, Dauphin of Vienna ; he cared very little about the duration of the friendship patched up between the Duke of Austria and the King of France, or about the King of England’s opinion of the slight put upon his daughter! and he tested the royal vintage of Chaillot every evening, without suspecting that a few flasks of that same wine (slightly doctored and improved by Doctor Coictier, to be sure), cordially presented to Edward IV by Louis XI would one fine day rid Louis XI of Edward IV. The very honorable embassy of the Duke of Austria brought none of these cares to the Cardinal’s mind, but it troubled him in another way. It was indeed rather hard, and we have already spoken a word in regard to it in an earlier page of this book, to be forced to welcome and entertain—he, Charles of Bourbon—these nondescript citizens; he, a cardinal, to condescend to aldermen; he, a Frenchman and a bon-viveur, to befriend Flemish beer-drinkers, and in public too! This was assuredly one of the most painful farces he had ever been compelled to play for the King’s pleasure.","Not that he was a profound politician, nor was he borrowing trouble about the possible consequences of the marriage of his cousin Marguerite de Bourgoyne to his cousin Charles, Dauphin de Vienne; nor as to how long the good understanding which had been patched up between the Duke of Austria and the King of France would last; nor how the King of England would take this disdain of his daughter. All that troubled him but little; and he gave a warm reception every evening to the wine of the royal vintage of Chaillot, without a suspicion that several flasks of that same wine (somewhat revised and corrected, it is true, by Doctor Coictier), cordially offered to Edward IV. by Louis XI. , would, some fine morning, rid Louis XI. of Edward IV. ""The much honored embassy of Monsieur the Duke of Austria,"" brought the cardinal none of these cares, but it troubled him in another direction. It was, in fact, somewhat hard, and we have already hinted at it on the second page of this book,—for him, Charles de Bourbon, to be obliged to feast and receive cordially no one knows what bourgeois;—for him, a cardinal, to receive aldermen;—for him, a Frenchman, and a jolly companion, to receive Flemish beer–drinkers,—and that in public!

"Maintenant, si le dénombrement de tant d’édifices, quelque sommaire que nous l’ayons voulu faire, n’a pas pulvérisé, à mesure que nous la construisions, dans l’esprit du lecteur, l’image générale du vieux Paris, nous la résumerons en quelques mots. Au centre, l’île de la Cité, ressemblant par sa forme à une énorme tortue et faisant sortir ses ponts écaillés de tuiles comme des pattes, de dessous sa grise carapace de toits. À gauche, le trapèze monolithe, ferme, dense, serré, hérissé, de l’Université. À droite, le vaste demi-cercle de la Ville beaucoup plus mêlé de jardins et de monuments. Les trois blocs, Cité, Université, Ville, marbrés de rues sans nombre. Tout au travers, la Seine, la « nourricière Seine », comme dit le père Du Breul, obstruée d’îles, de ponts et de bateaux. Tout autour, une plaine immense, rapiécée de mille sortes de cultures, semée de beaux villages ; à gauche, Issy, Vanvres, Vaugirard, Montrouge, Gentilly avec sa tour ronde et sa tour carrée, etc. ; à droite, vingt autres depuis Conflans jusqu’à la Ville-l’Évêque. À l’horizon, un ourlet de collines disposées en cercle comme le rebord du bassin. Enfin, au loin, à l’orient, Vincennes et ses sept tours quadrangulaires ; au sud, Bicêtre et ses tourelles pointues ; au septentrion, Saint-Denis et son aiguille; à l’occident, Saint-Cloud et son donjon. Voilà le Paris que voyaient du haut des tours de Notre-Dame les corbeaux qui vivaient en 1482.","Now, if the enumeration of so many buildings, however summary we may have chosen, has not pulverized, as we build it, in the mind of the reader, the general image of old Paris, we summarize it in a few words. In the center, the Ile de la Cité, resembling an enormous turtle in shape and popping out its scaly tiled bridges like legs, from under its gray shell of roofs. On the left, the monolithic, firm, dense, tight, spiky trapezoid of the University. To the right, the vast semi-circle of the City, much more mixed with gardens and monuments. The three blocks, City, University, City, marbled with countless streets. All across, the Seine, the “nurturing Seine”, as Father Du Breul says, blocked by islands, bridges and boats. All around, an immense plain, patched with a thousand kinds of cultures, strewn with beautiful villages; on the left, Issy, Vanvres, Vaugirard, Montrouge, Gentilly with its round tower and its square tower, etc. ; on the right, twenty others from Conflans to Ville-l'Évêque.

Finally, in the distance, to the east, Vincennes and its seven quadrangular towers; to the south, Bicêtre and its pointed turrets; to the north, Saint-Denis and its needle; to the west, Saint-Cloud and its keep.

To the left, the close, compact, crowded, monolithic trapezium of the University; to the right, the vast semicircle of the Town, where houses and gardens were much more mingled,—the three districts, City, University, and Town, veined with countless streets. In and out, through the whole, ran the Seine,—“the nourishing Seine,” as Father du Breuil calls it,—obstructed with islands, bridges, and boats; all around an immense plain, green with a thousand different crops, and sprinkled with lovely villages: to the left, Issy, Vanvres, Vaugirard, Mon trouge, Gentilly with its round tower and its square tower, etc.; to the right, a score of others, from Conflans to Ville-l‘Evêque; on the horizon, a line of hills arranged in a circle like the rim of the basin. Finally, in the distance, to the eastward, Vincennes and its seven quadrangular towers; to the south, Bicêtre, and its pointed turrets; to the north, Saint-Denis and its spire; to the west, Saint-Cloud and its donjon. Such was Paris as seen from the top of the towers of Notre-Dame by the ravens who lived in 1482.","Now, if the enumeration of so many edifices, summary as we have endeavored to make it, has not shattered in the reader's mind the general image of old Paris, as we have constructed it, we will recapitulate it in a few words.

On the left, the monolithic trapezium, firm, dense, bristling, of the University; on the right, the vast semicircle of the Town, much more intermixed with gardens and monuments. The three blocks, city, university, and town, marbled with innumerable streets. Across all, the Seine, ""foster–mother Seine,"" as says Father Du Breul, blocked with islands, bridges, and boats. All about an immense plain, patched with a thousand sorts of cultivated plots, sown with fine villages. On the left, Issy, Vanvres, Vaugirarde, Montrouge, Gentilly, with its round tower and its square tower, etc.; on the right, twenty others, from Conflans to Ville–l'Evêque. On the horizon, a border of hills arranged in a circle like the rim of the basin. Finally, far away to the east, Vincennes, and its seven quadrangular towers to the south, Bicêtre and its pointed turrets; to the north, Saint–Denis and its spire; to the west, Saint Cloud and its donjon keep. Such was the Paris which the ravens, who lived in 1482, beheld from the summits of the towers of Notre–Dame."

Qu’est-ce que tu dis là, méchant, pour me déchirer le cœur ? Oh ! va ! prends-moi, prends tout ! fais ce que tu voudras de moi. Je suis à toi. Que m’importe l’amulette ! que m’importe ma mère ! c’est toi qui es ma mère, puisque je t’aime ! Phœbus, mon Phœbus bien-aimé, me vois-tu ? c’est moi, regarde-moi.

Eh bien, non ! ne nous marions pas, cela t’ennuie. Et puis, qu’est-ce que je suis, moi ? une misérable fille du ruisseau, tandis que toi, mon Phœbus, tu es gentilhomme. Belle chose vraiment ! une danseuse épouser un officier! j’étais folle. Non, Phœbus, non, je serai ta maîtresse, ton amusement, ton plaisir, quand tu voudras, une fille qui sera à toi, je ne suis faite que pour cela, souillée, méprisée, déshonorée, mais qu’importe! aimée. Je serai la plus fière et la plus joyeuse des femmes. Et quand je serai vieille ou laide, Phœbus, quand je ne serai plus bonne pour vous aimer, monseigneur, vous me souffrirez encore pour vous servir. D’autres vous broderont des écharpes. C'est moi la servante, qui en aurai soin. Vous me laisserez fourbir vos éperons, brosser votre hoqueton, épousseter vos bottes de cheval. N’est-ce pas mon Phœbus, que vous aurez cette pitié ? En attendant, prends-moi ! tiens, Phœbus, tout cela t’appartient, aime-moi seulement ! Nous autres égyptiennes, il ne nous faut que cela, de l’air et de l’amour.","- I don't love you! cried the poor unhappy child, and at the same time she hanged herself to the captain, whom she made sit beside her. I don't love you, my Phoebus! What are you saying there, mean, to rip my heart out? Oh ! goes ! take me, take it all! do what you want with me. I'm yours. What do I care about the amulet! what does my mother care! you are my mother, since I love you! Phoebus, my beloved Phoebus, do you see me? it's me, look at me. It is this little one that you do not want to push away, who is coming, who is herself coming to get you. My soul, my life, my body, my person, all of this is yours, my captain. Well no ! don't get married, that bothers you. And then, what am I? a miserable girl from the stream, while you, my Phoebus, are a gentleman. Beautiful thing really! a dancer marry an officer! I was crazy. No, Phoebus, no, I will be your mistress, your amusement, your pleasure, when you want, a girl who will be yours, I was made only for that, soiled, despised, dishonored, but what does it matter! loved. I will be the proudest and the happiest of women. And when I am old or ugly, Phoebus, when I am no longer good to love you, monseigneur, you will still suffer me to serve you. Others will embroider scarves for you. I am the servant, who will take care of it. You will let me polish your spurs, brush your hiccups, dust your horse boots. Isn't it my Phoebus, that you will have this pity? In the meantime, take me! hey, Phoebus, this all belongs to you, just love me! All we Egyptians need is air and love.","I see very plainly that you do not love me!” “I do not love him!” exclaimed the unhappy creature, and at the same time she hung upon the captain, whom she drew to a seat by her side. “I not love you, my Phoebus? How can you say so, you wicked man, to break my heart? Oh, come! take me, take everything! Do with me what you will; I am yours. What do I care for the amulet! What is my mother to me now! You are my mother, for I love you! Phoebus, my adored Phoebus, do you see me? It is I, look at me; it is that little girl whom you cannot repulse, who comes,—who comes herself in search of you. My soul, my life, my person, are yours; I am all yours, my captain. No, then, we will not marry; it would trouble you; and what am I? A miserable child of the gutter; while you, my Phoebus, are a gentleman. A fine thing, truly,—a dancing-girl to marry an officer! I was mad. No, Phoebus, no; I will be your mistress, your amusement, your pleasure, when you will; always yours. I am only made for that,—to be soiled, despised, dishonored; but what matter? I shall be loved. I shall be the proudest and happiest of women. And when I grow old or ugly, Phoebus, when I am no longer fit to love you, my lord, you will still suffer me to serve you. Others may embroider your scarves; but I, your servant, will take care of them. You will let me polish your spurs, brush your coat, dust your riding-boots.

We gipsy girls need nothing else,—nothing but air and love.”","I see plainly that you do not love me!""

What art thou saying, wicked man, to break my heart? Oh, take me! take all! do what you will with me, I am thine. What matters to me the amulet! What matters to me my mother! ' Tis thou who art my mother since I love thee! Phoebus, my beloved Phoebus, dost thou see me? ' Tis I. Look at me; 'tis the little one whom thou wilt surely not repulse, who comes, who comes herself to seek thee. My soul, my life, my body, my person, all is one thing—which is thine, my captain. Well, no! We will not marry, since that displeases thee; and then, what am I? a miserable girl of the gutters; whilst thou, my Phoebus, art a gentleman. A fine thing, truly! A dancer wed an officer! I was mad. No, Phoebus, no; I will be thy mistress, thy amusement, thy pleasure, when thou wilt; a girl who shall belong to thee. I was only made for that, soiled, despised, dishonored, but what matters it?—beloved. I shall be the proudest and the most joyous of women. And when I grow old or ugly, Phoebus, when I am no longer good to love you, you will suffer me to serve you still. Others will embroider scarfs for you; 'tis I, the servant, who will care for them.

"À la fin du quinzième siècle, le formidable gibet, qui datait de 1328, était déjà fort décrépit. Les poutres étaient vermoulues, les chaînes rouillées, les piliers verts de moisissure. Les assises de pierre de taille étaient toutes refendues à leur jointure, et l’herbe poussait sur cette plate-forme où les pieds ne touchaient pas. C'était un horrible profil sur le ciel que celui de ce monument ; la nuit surtout, quand il y avait un peu de lune sur ces crânes blancs, ou quand la bise du soir froissait chaînes et squelettes et remuait tout cela dans l’ombre. Il suffisait de ce gibet présent là pour faire de tous les environs des lieux sinistres.","At the end of the fifteenth century, the formidable gallows, which dated from 1328, was already very decrepit. The beams were worm-eaten, the chains rusty, the pillars green with mold. The courses of hewn stone were all split at their joints, and the grass grew on this platform where the feet did not touch. It was a horrible profile against the sky, that of this monument; especially at night, when there was a little moonlight on those white skulls, or when the evening wind rustled chains and skeletons and stirred it all up in the shadows. It was enough to have this gibbet present there to make all the surroundings sinister places.",,

"– Sur mon âme ! s’écria tout à coup Gringoire, nous sommes allègres et joyeux comme des ascalaphes ! Nous observons un silence de pythagoriciens ou de poissons ! Pasque-Dieu ! mes amis, je voudrais bien que quelqu’un me parlât. – La voix humaine est une musique à l’oreille humaine. Ce n’est pas moi qui dis cela, mais Didyme d’Alexandrie, et ce sont d’illustres paroles. – Certes, Didyme d’Alexandrie n’est pas un médiocre philosophe. Une parole, ma belle enfant ! dites-moi, je vous supplie, une parole. – À propos, vous aviez une drôle de petite singulière moue; la faites-vous toujours? Savez-vous, ma mie, que le parlement a toute juridiction sur les lieux d’asile, et que vous couriez grand péril dans votre logette de Notre-Dame ? Hélas ! le petit oiseau trochilus fait son nid dans la gueule du crocodile. – Maître, voici la lune qui reparaît. – Pourvu qu’on ne nous aperçoive pas ! – Nous faisons une chose louable en sauvant madamoiselle, et cependant on nous pendrait de par le roi si l’on nous attrapait. Hélas ! les actions humaines se prennent par deux anses. On flétrit en moi ce qu’on couronne en toi. Tel admire César qui blâme Catilina. N’est-ce pas, mon maître ? Que dites-vous de cette philosophie? Moi, je possède la philosophie d’instinct, de nature, ut apes geometriam – Allons! personne ne me répond. Les fâcheuses humeurs que vous avez là tous deux! Il faut que je parle tout seul. C'est ce que nous appelons en tragédie un monologue. – Pasque-Dieu! – Je vous préviens que je viens de voir le roi Louis onzième et que j’en ai retenu ce jurement. – Pasque-Dieu donc ! ils font toujours un fier hurlement dans la Cité. – C'est un vilain méchant vieux roi. Il est tout embrunché dans les fourrures. Il me doit toujours l’argent de mon épithalame, et c’est tout au plus s’il ne m’a pas fait pendre ce soir, ce qui m’aurait fort empêché. – Il est avaricieux pour les hommes de mérite. Il devrait bien lire les quatre livres de Salvien de Cologne Adversus avaritiam. En vérité ! c’est un roi étroit dans ses façons avec les gens de lettres, et qui fait des cruautés fort barbares. C'est une éponge à prendre l’argent posée sur le peuple. Son épargne est la ratelle qui s’enfle de la maigreur de tous les autres membres. Aussi les plaintes contre la rigueur du temps deviennent murmures contre le prince. Sous ce doux sire dévot, les fourches craquent de pendus, les billots pourrissent de sang, les prisons crèvent comme des ventres trop pleins. Ce roi a une main qui prend et une main qui pend. C'est le procureur de dame Gabelle et de monseigneur Gibet. Les grands sont dépouillés de leurs dignités et les petits sans cesse accablés de nouvelles foules. C'est un prince exorbitant. Je n’aime pas ce monarque. Et vous, mon maître ?","""On my soul!"" exclaimed Gringoire suddenly, ""we are gay and joyous as ascalaphes!"" We observe a silence of Pythagoreans or Pisces!

"Ce n’était pas chose aisée de pénétrer ce jour-là dans cette grand’salle, réputée cependant alors la plus grande enceinte couverte qui fût au monde. (Il est vrai que Sauval n’avait pas encore mesuré la grande salle du château de Montargis.) La place du Palais, encombrée de peuple, offrait aux curieux des fenêtres l’aspect d’une mer, dans laquelle cinq ou six rues, comme autant d’embouchures de fleuves, dégorgeaient à chaque instant de nouveaux flots de têtes. Les ondes de cette foule, sans cesse grossies, se heurtaient aux angles des maisons qui s’avançaient çà et là, comme autant de promontoires, dans le bassin irrégulier de la place. Au centre de la haute façade gothique1 du Palais, le grand escalier, sans relâche remonté et descendu par un double courant qui, après s’être brisé sous le perron intermédiaire, s’épandait à larges vagues sur ses deux pentes latérales, le grand escalier, dis-je, ruisselait incessamment dans la place comme une cascade dans un lac. Les cris, les rires, le trépignement de ces mille pieds faisaient un grand bruit et une grande clameur. De temps en temps cette clameur et ce bruit redoublaient, le courant qui poussait toute cette foule vers le grand escalier rebroussait, se troublait, tourbillonnait. C'était une bourrade d’un archer ou le cheval d’un sergent de la prévôté qui ruait pour rétablir l’ordre ; admirable tradition que la prévôté a léguée à la connétablie, la connétablie à la maréchaussée, et la maréchaussée à notre gendarmerie de Paris.","It was not easy to enter this great hall that day, however, then known as the largest covered enclosure in the world. (It is true that Sauval had not yet measured the great hall of the castle of Montargis.) The Place du Palais, crowded with people, offered to the curious from the windows the appearance of a sea, in which five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, at every moment disgorged new waves of heads. The waves of this crowd, constantly magnified, collided with the corners of the houses which jutted out here and there, like so many promontories, in the irregular basin of the place. In the center of the high Gothic facade1 of the Palace, the grand staircase, relentlessly ascended and descended by a double current which, after breaking under the intermediate porch, spread out in large waves on its two lateral slopes, the grand staircase , I said, flowed incessantly in the place like a waterfall in a lake. The cries, the laughter, the stamping of those thousand feet made a great noise and a great clamor. From time to time this clamor and this noise redoubled, the current which pushed all this crowd towards the great staircase turned back, was disturbed, whirled. It was a thud from an archer or the horse of a provost sergeant rushing to restore order; admirable tradition that the provost bequeathed to the constabulary, the constable to the constabulary, and the constabulary to our gendarmerie in Paris.","It was no easy matter to make a way into the great hall upon that day, although it was then held to be the largest enclosure under cover in the world (at that time, Sauvalc had not yet measured the great hall of the castle at Montargis). The courtyard, filled with people, looked to the spectators at the windows like a vast sea into which five or six streets, like the mouths of so many rivers, constantly disgorged new waves of heads. The billowing crowd, growing ever greater, dashed against houses projecting here and there like so many promontories in the irregular basin of the courtyard. In the middle of the lofty Gothic façade of the Palace was the great staircase, up and down which flowed an unending double stream, which, after breaking upon the intermediate landing, spread in broad waves over its two side slopes; the great staircase, I say, poured a steady stream into the courtyard, like a waterfall into a lake. Shouts, laughter, and the tramp of countless feet made a great amount of noise and a great hubbub. From time to time the hubbub and the noise were redoubled; the current which bore this throng towards the great staircase was turned back, eddied, and whirled. Some archer had dealt a blow, or the horse of some provost’s officer had administered a few kicks to restore order,—an admirable tradition, which has been faithfully handed down through the centuries to our present Parisian police.","It was no easy matter on that day, to force one's way into that grand hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of the Château of Montargis).

The waves of this crowd, augmented incessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected here and there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of the place. In the centre of the lofty Gothic[1] façade of the palace, the grand staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which, after parting on the intermediate landing–place, flowed in broad waves along its lateral slopes,—the grand staircase, I say, trickled incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The cries, the laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great noise and a great clamor. From time to time, this noise and clamor redoubled; the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed backwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the buffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost's sergeants, which kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the provostship has bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the maréchaussée, the maréchaussée to our gendarmeri of Paris."

"Il est certain que, si Ravaillac n’avait point assassiné Henri IV, il n’y aurait point eu de pièces du procès de Ravaillac déposées au greffe du Palais de Justice ; point de complices intéressés à faire disparaître lesdites pièces ; partant, point d’incendiaires obligés, faute de meilleur moyen, à brûler le greffe pour brûler les pièces, et à brûler le Palais de Justice pour brûler le greffe ; par conséquent enfin, point d’incendie de 1618.

The old Palace would still be standing with its old large hall; I could say to the reader: Go see her; and we would both be exempt, me from doing it, him from reading a description of it as it is. - Which proves this new truth: that great events have incalculable consequences.","It is certain that if Ravaillac had not assassinated Henry IV there would have been no documents relating to his case deposited in the Record Office of the Palace of Justice; no accomplices interested in making off with the said documents, accordingly no incendiaries, forced for want of better means to burn the Record Office in order to burn up the documents, and to burn the Palace of Justice in order to burn the Record Office; consequently, therefore, no fire in 1618. The old Palace would still be standing, with its great hall; I might be able to say to my reader, “Go and look at it,” and we should thus both of us be spared the need,—I of writing, and he of reading, an indifferent description; which proves this novel truth,—that great events have incalculable results.","It is certain, that if Ravaillac had not assassinated Henri IV. , there would have been no documents in the trial of Ravaillac deposited in the clerk's office of the Palais de Justice, no accomplices interested in causing the said documents to disappear; hence, no incendiaries obliged, for lack of better means, to burn the clerk's office in order to burn the documents, and to burn the Palais de Justice in order to burn the clerk's office; consequently, in short, no conflagration in 1618.

"Et en creusant ainsi son âme, quand il vit quelle large place la nature y avait préparée aux passions, il ricana plus amèrement encore. Il remua au fond de son cœur toute sa haine, toute sa méchanceté, et il reconnut, avec le froid coup d’œil d’un médecin qui examine un malade, que cette haine, que cette méchanceté n’étaient que de l’amour vicié; que l’amour, cette source de toute vertu chez l’homme, tournait en choses horribles dans un cœur de prêtre, et qu’un homme constitué comme lui, en se faisant prêtre, se faisait démon. Alors il rit affreusement, et tout à coup il redevint pâle en considérant le côté le plus sinistre de sa fatale passion, de cet amour corrosif, venimeux, haineux, implacable, qui n’avait abouti qu’au gibet pour l’une, à l’enfer pour l’autre : elle condamnée, lui damné.","And thus digging his soul, when he saw what a large place nature had prepared there for passions, he sneered even more bitterly.

So he laughed horribly, and suddenly he turned pale again, considering the most sinister side of his fatal passion, of that corrosive, poisonous, hateful, implacable love, which had only ended in a gibbet for one, hell for the other: she condemned, he damned.","And as he thus searched his soul, when he saw how large a space Nature had reserved therein for the passions, he sneered more bitterly still. He stirred up all the hatred and malice from the very depths of his heart; and he recognized, with the cold gaze of a physician studying his patient, that this malice was nothing but love perverted; that love, the source of all virtue in man, turned to horrible things in the heart of a priest, and that a man formed like him, when he became a priest became a demon. Then he laughed fearfully, and all at once he again turned pale, as he considered the most forbidding side of his fatal passion,—of that corrosive, venomous, malignant, implacable love which led but to the gallows for one, to hell for the other: she condemned, he damned.","And as he thus sifted his soul to the bottom, when he perceived how large a space nature had prepared there for the passions, he sneered still more bitterly.

"Ce qu’il aimait avant tout dans l’édifice maternel, ce qui réveillait son âme et lui faisait ouvrir ses pauvres ailes qu’elle tenait si misérablement reployées dans sa caverne, ce qui le rendait parfois heureux, c’étaient les cloches.

"Vis-à-vis la haute cathédrale rougie par le couchant, sur le balcon de pierre pratiqué au-dessus du porche d’une riche maison gothique qui faisait l’angle de la place et de la rue du Parvis, quelques belles jeunes filles riaient et devisaient avec toute sorte de grâce et de folie. À la longueur du voile qui tombait, du sommet de leur coiffe pointue enroulée de perles, jusqu’à leurs talons, à la finesse de la chemisette brodée qui couvrait leurs épaules en laissant voir, selon la mode engageante d’alors, la naissance de leurs belles gorges de vierges, à l’opulence de leurs jupes de dessous, plus précieuses encore que leur surtout (recherche merveilleuse !), à la gaze, à la soie, au velours dont tout cela était étoffé, et surtout à la blancheur de leurs mains qui les attestait oisives et paresseuses, il était aisé de deviner de nobles et riches héritières. C'était en effet damoiselle Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier et ses compagnes, Diane de Christeuil, Amelotte de Montmichel, Colombe de Gaillefontaine, et la petite de Champchevrier ; toutes filles de bonne maison, réunies en ce moment chez la dame veuve de Gondelaurier, à cause de monseigneur de Beaujeu et de madame sa femme, qui devaient venir au mois d’avril à Paris, et y choisir des accompagneresses d’honneur pour madame la Dauphine Marguerite, lorsqu’on l’irait recevoir en Picardie des mains des flamands. Or, tous les hobereaux de trente lieues à la ronde briguaient cette faveur pour leurs filles, et bon nombre d’entre eux les avaient déjà amenées ou envoyées à Paris. Celles-ci avaient été confiées par leurs parents à la garde discrète et vénérable de madame Aloïse de Gondelaurier, veuve d’un ancien maître des arbalétriers du roi, retirée avec sa fille unique, en sa maison de la place du parvis Notre-Dame, à Paris.","Opposite the high cathedral, reddened by the setting sun, on the stone balcony above the porch of a rich Gothic house which formed the corner of the square and the rue du Parvis, a few beautiful young girls were laughing. and chatted with all kinds of grace and madness.

Now, all the squires around thirty leagues were asking for this favor for their daughters, and many of them had already brought or sent them to Paris.

"Les quatre personnages, après avoir largement recueilli le paiement de leurs révérences en applaudissements, entamèrent, au milieu d’un religieux silence, un prologue dont nous faisons volontiers grâce au lecteur. Du reste, ce qui arrive encore de nos jours, le public s’occupait encore plus des costumes qu’ils portaient que du rôle qu’ils débitaient; et en vérité c’était justice. Ils étaient vêtus tous quatre de robes mi-parties jaune et blanc, qui ne se distinguaient entre elles que par la nature de l’étole ; la première était en brocart, or et argent, la deuxième en soie, la troisième en laine, la quatrième en toile. Le premier des personnages portait en main droite une épée, le second deux clefs d’or, le troisième une balance, le quatrième une bêche ; et pour aider les intelligences paresseuses qui n’auraient pas vu clair à travers la transparence de ces attributs, on pouvait lire en grosses lettres noires brodées : au bas de la robe de brocart, JE M’APPELLE NOBLESSE ; au bas de la robe de soie, JE M’APPELLE CLERGÉ ; au bas de la robe de laine, JE M’APPELLE MARCHANDISE ; au bas de la robe de toile, JE M’APPELLE LABOUR. Le sexe des deux allégories mâles était clairement indiqué à tout spectateur judicieux par leurs robes moins longues et par la cramignole qu’elles portaient en tête, tandis que les deux allégories femelles, moins court-vêtues, étaient coiffées d’un chaperon.","The four characters, after having largely received the payment of their bows in applause, began, in the midst of religious silence, a prologue which we gladly do thanks to the reader.

They were all dressed in yellow and white half-parted dresses, which stood out from each other only by the nature of the stole; the first was in brocade, gold and silver, the second in silk, the third in wool, the fourth in linen. The first of the figures carried a sword in his right hand, the second two golden keys, the third a scales, the fourth a spade; and to help lazy minds who may not have seen clearly through the transparency of these attributes, one could read in big black embroidered letters: at the bottom of the brocade dress, MY NAME IS NOBLESSE; at the bottom of the silk dress, MY NAME IS CLERGY; at the bottom of the wool dress, MY NAME IS MERCHANDISE; at the bottom of the canvas dress, MY NAME IS LABOR. The gender of the two male allegories was clearly indicated to any judicious spectator by their shorter dresses and the cramignole they wore at the head, while the two female allegories, less short-dressed, were capped with a hood.","These four personages, having been abundantly repaid for their bows by applause, began, amid devout silence, a prologue which we gladly spare the reader.

"Cependant, que devient l’imprimerie? Toute cette vie qui s’en va de l’architecture vient chez elle. À mesure que l’architecture baisse, l’imprimerie s’enfle et grossit. Ce capital de forces que la pensée humaine dépensait en édifices, elle le dépense désormais en livres. Aussi dès le seizième siècle la presse, grandie au niveau de l’architecture décroissante, lutte avec elle et la tue. Au dix-septième, elle est déjà assez souveraine, assez triomphante, assez assise dans sa victoire pour donner au monde la fête d’un grand siècle littéraire. Au dix-huitième, longtemps reposée à la cour de Louis XIV, elle ressaisit la vieille épée de Luther, en arme Voltaire, et court, tumultueuse, à l’attaque de cette ancienne Europe dont elle a déjà tué l’expression architecturale. Au moment où le dix-huitième siècle s’achève, elle a tout détruit. Au dix-neuvième, elle va reconstruire.","However, what happens to the printing press? All that life that goes with architecture comes to her. As architecture declines, the printing press swells and grows. This capital of force that human thought was spending on buildings, it now spends on books. Also from the sixteenth century the press, grown to the level of decreasing architecture, struggles with it and kills it. In the seventeenth, she was already sovereign enough, triumphant enough, sufficiently established in her victory to give the world the celebration of a great literary century. In the eighteenth century, long rested at the court of Louis XIV, she seized the old sword of Luther, in Voltaire's weapon, and ran, tumultuous, to attack this ancient Europe, whose architectural expression she had already killed. By the time the eighteenth century comes to an end, it has destroyed everything. In the nineteenth, it will rebuild.","But what was printing doing? All the life which architecture lost, flushed its veins. In proportion as architecture degenerated, printing throve and flourished. The capital of forces which human thought had expended in building, it henceforth expended in books. So from the dawn of the sixteenth century onward, the press, grown to the level of the declining architecture, wrestled with it and slew it. In the seventeenth century it was already sufficiently supreme, sufficiently triumphant, sufficiently sure of victory, to give the world the spectacle of a great literary age. In the eighteenth century, after a long interval of rest at the court of Louis XIV, it once more grasped the old sword of Luther, armed Voltaire with it, and hastened tumultuously forth to attack that ancient Europe whose architectural expression it had already destroyed. When the eighteenth century closed, it had uprooted everything. In the nineteenth, it will reconstruct.","Meanwhile what becomes of printing? All the life which is leaving architecture comes to it. In proportion as architecture ebbs, printing swells and grows. That capital of forces which human thought had been expending in edifices, it henceforth expends in books. Thus, from the sixteenth century onward, the press, raised to the level of decaying architecture, contends with it and kills it. In the seventeenth century it is already sufficiently the sovereign, sufficiently triumphant, sufficiently established in its victory, to give to the world the feast of a great literary century. In the eighteenth, having reposed for a long time at the Court of Louis XIV., it seizes again the old sword of Luther, puts it into the hand of Voltaire, and rushes impetuously to the attack of that ancient Europe, whose architectural expression it has already killed. At the moment when the eighteenth century comes to an end, it has destroyed everything. In the nineteenth, it begins to reconstruct."

"Quand la recluse vit cela, elle se dressa brusquement sur les genoux, écarta ses cheveux de son visage, puis laissa retomber ses mains maigres et écorchées sur ses cuisses. Alors de grosses larmes sortirent une à une de ses yeux, elles descendaient par une ride le long de ses joues comme un torrent par le lit qu’il s’est creusé. En même temps elle se mit à parler, mais d’une voix si suppliante, si douce, si soumise et si poignante, qu’à l’entour de Tristan plus d’un vieil argousin qui aurait mangé de la chair humaine s’essuyait les yeux.","When the recluse saw this, she jerked up on her knees, brushed her hair away from her face, then let her thin, scraped hands fall to her thighs.

Then great tears fell, one by one, from her eyes; they flowed down her cheeks through a furrow, like a torrent through a bed which it has hollowed for itself.

"Au quinzième siècle, la Seine baignait cinq îles dans l’enceinte de Paris : l’île Louviers, où il y avait alors des arbres et où il n’y a plus que du bois ; l’île aux Vaches et l’île Notre-Dame, toutes deux désertes, à une masure près, toutes deux fiefs de l’évêque (au dix-septième siècle, de ces deux îles on en a fait une, qu’on a bâtie, et que nous appelons l’île Saint-Louis) ; enfin la Cité, et à sa pointe l’îlot du passeur aux vaches qui s’est abîmé depuis sous le terre-plein du Pont-Neuf. La Cité alors avait cinq ponts ; trois à droite, le Pont Notre-Dame et le Pont-au-Change, en pierre, le Pont-aux-Meuniers, en bois ; deux à gauche, le Petit-Pont, en pierre, le Pont-Saint-Michel, en bois : tous chargés de maisons. L'Université avait six portes bâties par Philippe-Auguste : c’étaient, à partir de la Tournelle, la Porte Saint-Victor, la Porte Bordelle, la Porte Papale, la Porte Saint-Jacques, la Porte Saint-Michel, la Porte Saint-Germain. La Ville avait six portes bâties par Charles V; c’étaient, à partir de la Tour de Billy, la Porte Saint-Antoine, la Porte du Temple, la Porte Saint-Martin, la Porte Saint-Denis, la Porte Montmartre, la Porte Saint-Honoré. Toutes ces portes étaient fortes, et belles aussi, ce qui ne gâte pas la force. Un fossé large, profond, à courant vif dans les crues d’hiver, lavait le pied des murailles tout autour de Paris ; la Seine fournissait l’eau. La nuit on fermait les portes, on barrait la rivière aux deux bouts de la ville avec de grosses chaînes de fer, et Paris dormait tranquille.","In the fifteenth century, the Seine bathed five islands within the walls of Paris: Île Louviers, where there were then trees and where there is only wood; Île aux Vaches and Île Notre-Dame, both deserted, except for a hovel, both fiefdoms of the bishop (in the seventeenth century, of these two islands we made one, that we have built, and which we call Île Saint-Louis); finally the City, and at its point the islet of the cow ferryman, which has since been damaged under the pont-Neuf platform. The City then had five bridges; three on the right, the Pont Notre-Dame and the Pont-au-Change, in stone, the Pont-aux-Meuniers, in wood; two on the left, the Petit-Pont, in stone, the Pont-Saint-Michel, in wood: all loaded with houses.

All these doors were strong, and beautiful too, which does not spoil the strength.

"Depuis combien de temps y était-elle, elle ne le savait. Elle avait souvenir d’un arrêt de mort prononcé quelque part contre quelqu’un, puis qu’on l’avait emportée, elle, et qu’elle s’était réveillée dans la nuit et dans le silence, glacée. Elle s’était traînée sur les mains, alors des anneaux de fer lui avaient coupé la cheville du pied, et des chaînes avaient sonné. Elle avait reconnu que tout était muraille autour d’elle, qu’il y avait au-dessous d’elle une dalle couverte d’eau et une botte de paille. Mais ni lampe, ni soupirail. Alors, elle s’était assise sur cette paille, et quelquefois, pour changer de posture, sur la dernière marche d’un degré de pierre qu’il y avait dans son cachot. Un moment, elle avait essayé de compter les noires minutes que lui mesurait la goutte d’eau, mais bientôt ce triste travail d’un cerveau malade s’était rompu de lui-même dans sa tête et l’avait laissée dans la stupeur.","How long had she been there, she didn't know. She remembered a death warrant passed on someone somewhere, then taken away, and she woke up in the night and in the silence, freezing cold. She had crawled on her hands, so iron rings cut off her ankle, and chains rang. She had recognized that everything was a wall around her, that there was a slab below her covered with water and a bundle of straw. But neither lamp nor window. So she sat on that straw, and sometimes, to change her posture, on the last step of a stone step that was in her dungeon. For a moment she had tried to count the dark minutes the drop of water measured in her, but soon this sad work of a sick brain had snapped of itself in her head and left her in awe.","How long had she been there?

She had dragged herself about on her hands and knees; then iron rings had cut her ankle, and chains had clanked. She discovered that there was a wall all about her, that there was a tiled floor under her, covered with water, and a bundle of straw; but neither lamp nor ventilator. Then she seated herself upon the straw, and occasionally, for a change of position, on the last step of some stone stairs in her cell. At one time she tried to count the dark moments measured for her by the drop of water; but soon this sad task of a diseased brain ceased of its own accord, and left her in a stupor.","How long had she been there?

She had dragged herself along on her hands. Then iron rings that cut her ankles, and chains had rattled. She had recognized the fact that all around her was wall, that below her there was a pavement covered with moisture and a truss of straw; but neither lamp nor air–hole. Then she had seated herself on that straw and, sometimes, for the sake of changing her attitude, on the last stone step in her dungeon. For a while she had tried to count the black minutes measured off for her by the drop of water; but that melancholy labor of an ailing brain had broken off of itself in her head, and had left her in stupor."

These objects had so little value that the executioner probably did not want them. The other, which held this one tightly embraced, was a human skeleton. It was noticed that he had a deviated spine, his head between the shoulder blades, and one leg shorter than the other.

"Le bateau voguait lentement vers la rive droite. La jeune fille observait avec une terreur secrète l’inconnu. Il avait rebouché soigneusement la lumière de sa lanterne sourde. On l’entrevoyait dans l’obscurité, à l’avant du bateau, comme un spectre. Sa carapoue, toujours baissée, lui faisait une sorte de masque, et à chaque fois qu’il entr’ouvrait en ramant ses bras où pendaient de larges manches noires, on eût dit deux grandes ailes de chauve-souris. Du reste, il n’avait pas encore dit une parole, jeté un souffle. Il ne se faisait dans le bateau d’autre bruit que le va-et-vient de la rame, mêlé au froissement des mille plis de l’eau le long de la barque.","The boat sailed slowly towards the right bank. The young girl gazed with secret terror at the stranger. He had carefully plugged the light of his deaf lantern. He could be seen in the dark, at the front of the boat, like a ghost.

Besides, he had not yet said a word, breathed. There was no noise in the boat other than the coming and going of the oar, mingled with the rustling of the thousand folds of water alongside the boat.","The boat proceeded slowly towards the right bank. The young girl watched the stranger with secret dread.

Moreover, he had not yet breathed a word. The only sound in the boat was that of the oars, mingled with the ripple of the water against the side of the boat.","The boat made its way slowly towards the right shore.

"Tout à coup, au-dessus de la tête de Phœbus, elle vit une autre tête, une figure livide, verte, convulsive, avec un regard de damné. Près de cette figure il y avait une main qui tenait un poignard. C'était la figure et la main du prêtre. Il avait brisé la porte et il était là. Phœbus ne pouvait le voir.

The girl was motionless, frozen, mute, at the frightful apparition, like a dove which chances to raise its head at the instant when the sea-eagle glares into its nest with fiery eyes.","All at once, above Phoebus's head she beheld another head; a green, livid, convulsed face, with the look of a lost soul; near this face was a hand grasping a poniard.—It was the face and hand of the priest; he had broken the door and he was there. Phoebus could not see him. The young girl remained motionless, frozen with terror, dumb, beneath that terrible apparition, like a dove which should raise its head at the moment when the hawk is gazing into her nest with its round eyes."
"C'était vraiment un spectacle digne d’un spectateur plus intelligent que Phœbus, de voir comme ces belles filles, avec leurs langues envenimées et irritées, serpentaient, glissaient et se tordaient autour de la danseuse des rues. Elles étaient cruelles et gracieuses. Elles fouillaient, elles furetaient malignement de la parole dans sa pauvre et folle toilette de paillettes et d'oripeaux. C'étaient des rires, des ironies, des humiliations sans fin. Les sarcasmes pleuvaient sur l’égyptienne, et la bienveillance hautaine, et les regards méchants. On eût cru voir de ces jeunes dames romaines qui s’amusaient à enfoncer des épingles d’or dans le sein d’une belle esclave.

They looked like elegant huntress greyhounds, with open nostrils, fiery eyes, around a poor wood doe that the master's gaze forbids them to devour.","It was indeed a scene worthy of a more intelligent spectator than Phoebus, to see how these beautiful girls, with their angry, venomous tongues, glided and twisted and twined about the street dancer; they were cruel and yet gracious; they maliciously searched and scanned her shabby, fantastic garb of rags and tinsel. Their laughter, their mockery, and their sneers were endless. Sarcasms rained upon the gipsy, with wicked glances and a haughty pretence of benevolence. They were like those young Roman damsels who amused themselves by plunging golden pins into the bosom of a beautiful slave girl.

"Tous les yeux s’étaient levés vers le haut de l’église. Ce qu’ils voyaient était extraordinaire. Sur le sommet de la galerie la plus élevée, plus haut que la rosace centrale, il y avait une grande flamme qui montait entre les deux clochers avec des tourbillons d’étincelles, une grande flamme désordonnée et furieuse dont le vent emportait par moments un lambeau dans la fumée. Au-dessous de cette flamme, au-dessous de la sombre balustrade à trèfles de braise, deux gouttières en gueules de monstres vomissaient sans relâche cette pluie ardente qui détachait son ruissellement argenté sur les ténèbres de la façade inférieure. À mesure qu’ils approchaient du sol, les deux jets de plomb liquide s’élargissaient en gerbes, comme l’eau qui jaillit des mille trous de l’arrosoir. Au-dessus de la flamme, les énormes tours, de chacune desquelles on voyait deux faces crues et tranchées, l’une toute noire, l’autre toute rouge, semblaient plus grandes encore de toute l’immensité de l’ombre qu’elles projetaient jusque dans le ciel. Leurs innombrables sculptures de diables et de dragons prenaient un aspect lugubre. La clarté inquiète de la flamme les faisait remuer à l’œil. Il y avait des guivres qui avaient l’air de rire, des gargouilles qu’on croyait entendre japper, des salamandres qui soufflaient dans le feu, des tarasques qui éternuaient dans la fumée. Et parmi ces monstres ainsi réveillés de leur sommeil de pierre par cette flamme, par ce bruit, il y en avait un qui marchait et qu’on voyait de temps en temps passer sur le front ardent du bûcher comme une chauve-souris devant une chandelle.","All eyes were raised to the top of the church. What they saw was extraordinary. On the top of the highest gallery, higher than the central rose window, there was a great flame which rose between the two steeples with whirlwinds of sparks, a great disordered and furious flame of which the wind carried at times a fragment in the smoke. Below this flame, below the dark balustrade with ember clovers, two gutters in the mouths of monsters relentlessly vomited this fiery rain which released its silvery stream on the darkness of the lower facade. As they approached the ground, the two jets of liquid lead widened in sprays, like water spurting out of a thousand holes in the watering can. Above the flame, the enormous towers, of each of which one saw two raw and sliced faces, one completely black, the other completely red, seemed even greater for all the immensity of the shadow. projected into the sky. Their countless sculptures of devils and dragons took on a gloomy appearance. The worried clarity of the flame made them stir in their eyes. There were guivres which looked as if they were laughing, gargoyles you thought you could hear barking, salamanders blowing in the fire, tarascans sneezing in the smoke. And among these monsters thus awakened from their sleep of stone by this flame, by this noise, there was one who walked and that we saw from time to time pass over the fiery forehead of the stake like a bat in front of a candle. .","All eyes were turned to the top of the church. What they saw was most strange. Upon the top of the topmost gallery, higher than the central rose-window, a vast flame ascended between the two belfries with whirling sparks,—a vast flame, fierce and strong, fragments of which were ever and anon borne away by the wind with the smoke. Below this flame, below the dark balustrade with its glowing trefoils, two spouts, terminating in gargoyles, vomiting un-intermittent sheets of fiery rain, whose silvery streams shone out distinctly against the gloom of the lower part of the cathedral front. As they approached the ground, these jets of liquid lead spread out into sheaves, like water pouring from the countless holes of the rose in a watering-pot. Above the flame, the huge towers, each of which showed two sides, clear and trenchant, one all black, the other all red, seemed even larger than they were, from the immensity of the shadow which they cast, reaching to the very sky. Their innumerable carvings of demons and dragons assumed a mournful aspect. The restless light of the flames made them seem to move. There were serpents, which seemed to be laughing, gargoyles yelping, salamanders blowing the fire, dragons sneezing amid the smoke. And among these monsters, thus wakened from their stony slumbers by the flame, by the noise, there was one that walked about, and moved from time to time across the fiery front of the burning pile like a bat before a candle.","All eyes were raised to the top of the church.

"C'était un fort heureux personnage, en l’an de grâce 1482, que noble homme Robert d’Estouteville, chevalier, sieur de Beyne, baron d’Yvri et Saint-Andry en la Marche, conseiller et chambellan du roi, et garde de la prévôté de Paris. Il y avait déjà près de dix-sept ans qu’il avait reçu du roi, le 7 novembre 1465, l’année de la comète1, cette belle charge de prévôt de Paris, qui était réputée plutôt seigneurie qu’office, dignitas, dit Joannes Lœmnœus, quæ cum non exigua potestate politiam concernente, atque prærogativis multis et juribus conjuncta est. La chose était merveilleuse en 82 qu’un gentilhomme ayant commission du roi et dont les lettres d’institution remontaient à l’époque du mariage de la fille naturelle de Louis XI avec monsieur le bâtard de Bourbon. Le même jour où Robert d’Estouteville avait remplacé Jacques de Villiers dans la prévôté de Paris, maître Jean Dauvet remplaçait messire Hélye de Thorrettes dans la première présidence de la cour de parlement, Jean Jouvenel des Ursins supplantait Pierre de Morvilliers dans l’office de chancelier de France, Regnault des Dormans désappointait Pierre Puy de la charge de maître des requêtes ordinaires de l’hôtel du roi. Or, sur combien de têtes la présidence, la chancellerie et la maîtrise s’étaient-elles promenées depuis que Robert d’Estouteville avait la prévôté de Paris ! Elle lui avait été baillée en garde, disaient les lettres patentes ; et certes, il la gardait bien. Il s’y était cramponné, il s’y était incorporé, il s’y était identifié. Si bien qu’il avait échappé à cette furie de changement qui possédait Louis XI, roi défiant, taquin et travailleur qui tenait à entretenir, par des institutions et des révocations fréquentes, l’élasticité de son pouvoir. Il y a plus, le brave chevalier avait obtenu pour son fils la survivance de sa charge, et il y avait déjà deux ans que le nom de noble homme Jacques d’Estouteville, écuyer, figurait à côté du sien en tête du registre de l’ordinaire de la prévôté de Paris. Rare, certes, et insigne faveur ! Il est vrai que Robert d’Estouteville était un bon soldat, qu’il avait loyalement levé le pennon contre la ligue du bien public, et qu’il avait offert à la reine un très merveilleux cerf en confitures le jour de son entrée à Paris en 14... Il avait plus la bonne amitié de messire Tristan l’Hermite, prévôt des maréchaux de l’hôtel du roi. C'était donc une très douce et plaisante existence que celle de messire Robert. D’abord, de fort bons gages, auxquels se rattachaient et pendaient, comme des grappes de plus à sa vigne, les revenus des greffes civil et criminel de la prévôté, plus les revenus civils et criminels des auditoires d’Embas du Châtelet, sans compter quelque petit péage au pont de Mantes et de Corbeil, et les profits du tru sur l’esgrin de Paris, sur les mouleurs de bûches et les mesureurs de sel. Ajoutez à cela le plaisir d’étaler dans les chevauchées de la ville et de faire ressortir sur les robes mi-parties rouge et tanné des échevins et des quarteniers son bel habit de guerre que vous pouvez encore admirer aujourd’hui sculpté sur son tombeau à l’abbaye de Valmont en Normandie, et son morion tout bosselé à Montlhéry. Et puis, n’était-ce rien que d’avoir toute suprématie sur les sergents de la douzaine, le concierge et guette du Châtelet, les deux auditeurs du Châtelet, auditores Castelleti, les seize commissaires des seize quartiers, le geôlier du Châtelet, les quatre sergents fieffés, les cent vingt sergents à cheval, les cent vingt sergents à verge, le chevalier du guet avec son guet, son sous-guet, son contre-guet et son arrière-guet ? N’était-ce rien que d’exercer haute et basse justice, droit de tourner, de pendre et de traîner, sans compter la menue juridiction en premier ressort, in prima instantia, comme disent les chartes, sur cette vicomté de Paris, si glorieusement apanagée de sept nobles bailliages ? Peut-on rien imaginer de plus suave que de rendre arrêts et jugements, comme faisait quotidiennement messire Robert d’Estouteville, dans le Grand-Châtelet, sous les ogives larges et écrasées de Philippe-Auguste ? et d’aller, comme il avait coutume chaque soir, en cette charmante maison sise rue Galilée dans le pourpris du Palais-Royal, qu’il tenait du chef de sa femme, madame Ambroise de Loré, se reposer de la fatigue d’avoir envoyé quelque pauvre diable passer la nuit de son côté dans « cette petite logette de la rue de l’Escorcherie, en laquelle les prévôts et échevins de Paris voulaient faire leur prison ; contenant icelle onze pieds de long, sept pieds et quatre pouces de lez et onze pieds de haut2 » ?","He was a very happy personage, in the year of grace 1482, that noble man Robert d'Estouteville, knight, sieur de Beyne, baron d'Yvri and Saint-Andry en la Marche, counselor and chamberlain of the king, and guard of the provost of Paris. It was already nearly seventeen years since he had received from the king, on November 7, 1465, the year of the comet1, this fine office of provost of Paris, which was considered rather seigneury than office, dignitas, dit Joannes Lœmnœus, quæ cum non exigua potestate politiam concernente, atque prærogativis multis and juribus conjuncta est. It was wonderful in 82 that a gentleman having commission from the king and whose letters of institution dated back to the time of the marriage of the natural daughter of Louis XI to the bastard of Bourbon. The same day that Robert d'Estouteville had replaced Jacques de Villiers in the provost of Paris, Maître Jean Dauvet replaced Messire Hélye de Thorrettes in the first presidency of the court of parliament, Jean Jouvenel des Ursins supplanted Pierre de Morvilliers in the office of Chancellor of France, Regnault des Dormans disappointed Pierre Puy with the office of master of ordinary requests of the king's hotel. Now, how many heads have the presidency, the chancellery and the control been on since Robert d´Estouteville had the provost of Paris! She had been bailed out for him, said the letters patent; and of course he kept it well. He had clung to it, he had become part of it, he had identified with it. So much so that he had escaped that fury for change which possessed Louis XI, a defiant, teasing and hardworking king who insisted on maintaining, through institutions and frequent dismissals, the elasticity of his power. There is more, the brave knight had obtained for his son the survival of his office, and it was already two years that the name of noble man Jacques d'Estouteville, squire, appeared next to his at the head of the register of the Ordinary of the Provost of Paris. Rare, certainly, and a great favor! It is true that Robert d'Estouteville was a good soldier, that he had loyally raised the pennon against the league of the public good, and that he had offered the queen a very marvelous deer in jams on the day of his entry into Paris. in 14 ... He no longer had the good friendship of Messire Tristan l'Hermite, marshal of the king's hotel. It was therefore a very sweet and pleasant existence that of Messire Robert. First, very good wages, to which were attached and hung, like clusters more to his vineyard, the income of the civil and criminal registries of the provost, plus the civil and criminal income of the audiences of Embas du Châtelet, without to count some small toll at the bridge of Mantes and Corbeil, and the profits of the tru on the esgrin of Paris, on the moulders of logs and the salt measurers. Add to that the pleasure of showing off in the rides of the city and of bringing out on the red and tanned half-part dresses of the aldermen and quarteniers his beautiful war dress that you can still admire today carved on his tomb in the abbey of Valmont in Normandy, and its dented morion in Montlhéry. And then, was it nothing to have supremacy over the sergeants of the dozen, the concierge and watchman of the Châtelet, the two auditors of the Châtelet, Castelleti auditores, the sixteen commissioners of the sixteen districts, the jailer of the Châtelet, the four armed sergeants, the one hundred and twenty mounted sergeants, the one hundred and twenty rod sergeants, the knight of the watch with his watch, his sub-watch, his counter-watch and his rear-watch? Was it nothing to exercise high and low justice, the right to turn, hang and drag, not to mention the small jurisdiction in first resort, in prima instantia, as the charters say, over this viscount of Paris, if gloriously prerogative of seven noble bailiwicks? Can one imagine anything sweeter than rendering judgments and judgments, as Messire Robert d'Estouteville did every day, in the Grand-Châtelet, under the large and crushed warheads of Philippe-Auguste? and to go, as he was accustomed every evening, to this charming house located rue Galilée in the purple of the Palais-Royal, which he held from the head of his wife, Madame Ambroise de Loré, to rest from the fatigue of having sent some poor devil to spend the night on his side in ""that little cabin in the rue de l'Escorcherie, in which the provosts and aldermen of Paris wanted to make their prison; containing it eleven feet long, seven feet and four inches lez and eleven feet high2 ”?","A very lucky fellow, in the year of grace 1482, was that noble gentleman Robert d‘Estouteville, knight, Lord of Beyne, Baron of Ivry and St. Andry in La Marche, councillor and chamberlain to the king, and keeper of the provosty of Paris. It was some seventeen years since he received from the king, Nov. 7, 1465, the year of the comet,bw the handsome appointment of provost of Paris, which was regarded rather as a dignity than an office. “Dignitas,” says Joannes Lœmnœus, “quæ cum non exigua potestate politiam concernente, atque praærogativis multis et juribus conjuncta est. ”bx It was an extraordinary thing in 1482 for a gentleman to hold a commission from the king; and a gentleman, too, whose appointment dated back to the time of the marriage of Louis XI’s natural daughter to the Bastard of Bourbon. On the same day that Robert d’Estouteville succeeded Jacques de Villiers as provost of Paris, Master Jehan Dauvet took the place of Master Hélye de Thorrettes as first president of the court of Parliament, Jehan Jou venel des Ursins supplanted Pierre de Morvilliers in the office of Lord Chancellor of France, Regnault des Dormans deprived Pierre Puy of his place as referendary in ordinary to the king’s household. Now, through how many hands had the presidency, chancellorship, and referendaryship not passed since Robert d‘Estouteville was made provost of Paris! The office was “granted into his keeping,” said the letters-patent; and certainly he kept it well. He clung to it , he identified himself with it, he made himself so much a part of it that he escaped that passion for change which possessed Louis XI, the suspicious, stingy, industrious king who insisted on keeping up the elasticity of his power by constant removals and appointments. Nay, more: the worthy knight had obtained the reversion of his office for his son, and for the last two years the name of the noble Jacques d‘Estouteville, Esquire, had figured beside his own at the head of the ordinary of the provosty of Paris. Assuredly a rare and signal mark of favor! True, Robert d’Estouteville was a good soldier; he had loyally raised his standard against “the league of the public weal,” and had offered the queen a very marvelous stag made of sweetmeats on the day she entered Paris, in 14—. Besides, he had a good friend in Master Tristan l‘Hermite, provost of the marshals of the king’s household. Master Robert, therefore, led a very smooth and pleasant life. In the first place, he had a capital salary, to which were attached and hung, like so many additional bunches of grapes to his vine, the revenues of the civil and criminal registries of the provostship, besides the civil and criminal revenues of the Inferior Courts of the Châtelet, not to mention some slight toll on the Pont de Mantes and Pont de Corbeil, the tax on all the onions, leeks, and garlic brought into Paris, and the tax on wood meters and salt measures. Add to this the pleasure of displaying his fine suit of armor within the city limits, and showing off among the party-colored red and tan robes of the sheriffs and district police which you may still admire carved upon his tomb at the Abbey of Valmont in Normandy, as you may also see his embossed morion at Montlhéry. And then,—was it nothing to have supreme power over the twelve sergeants, the porter and warder of the Châtelet, the two auditors of the Châtelet (auditores castelleti), the sixteen commissaries of the sixteen quarters of the city, the jailer of the Châtelet, the four ennobled officers of the peace, the hundred and twenty mounted police, the hundred and twenty vergers, the captain of the watch, his under-watch, counter-watch, and rear-watch? Was it nothing to administer high and low justice, to exercise the right to turn, hang, and draw, to say nothing of the minor jurisdiction “in the first instance” (in prima instantia, as the charters say) of that viscounty of Paris, so gloriously provided with seven noble bailiwicks? Can anything be imagined more agreeable than to give judgments and decrees, as Master Robert d’Estouteville did daily at the Grand-Châtelet, under the broad flat arches of Philip Augustus; and to return, as he was wont to do every evening, to that charming house in the Rue Galilée, within the precincts of the royal palace, which he held by right of his wife, Madame Ambroise de Lore, there to rest from the labor of sending some poor devil to pass his night in “that little lodge in the Rue de l‘Escorcherie, wherein the provosts and sheriffs of Paris frequently used as a prison,—the same measuring eleven feet in length, seven feet and four inches in width, and eleven feet in height?”by","A very happy personage in the year of grace 1482, was the noble gentleman Robert d'Estouteville, chevalier, Sieur de Beyne, Baron d'Ivry and Saint Andry en la Marche, counsellor and chamberlain to the king, and guard of the provostship of Paris. It was already nearly seventeen years since he had received from the king, on November 7, 1465, the comet year,[27] that fine charge of the provostship of Paris, which was reputed rather a seigneury than an office. Dignitas, says Joannes Loemnoeus, quoe cum non exigua potestate politiam concernente, atque proerogativis multis et juribus conjuncta est. A marvellous thing in '82 was a gentleman bearing the king's commission, and whose letters of institution ran back to the epoch of the marriage of the natural daughter of Louis XI. with Monsieur the Bastard of Bourbon. The same day on which Robert d'Estouteville took the place of Jacques de Villiers in the provostship of Paris, Master Jehan Dauvet replaced Messire Helye de Thorrettes in the first presidency of the Court of Parliament, Jehan Jouvenel des Ursins supplanted Pierre de Morvilliers in the office of chancellor of France, Regnault des Dormans ousted Pierre Puy from the charge of master of requests in ordinary of the king's household. Now, upon how many heads had the presidency, the chancellorship, the mastership passed since Robert d'Estouteville had held the provostship of Paris. It had been ""granted to him for safekeeping,"" as the letters patent said; and certainly he kept it well. He had clung to it , he had incorporated himself with it, he had so identified himself with it that he had escaped that fury for change which possessed Louis XI., a tormenting and industrious king, whose policy it was to maintain the elasticity of his power by frequent appointments and revocations. More than this; the brave chevalier had obtained the reversion of the office for his son, and for two years already, the name of the noble man Jacques d'Estouteville, equerry, had figured beside his at the head of the register of the salary list of the provostship of Paris. A rare and notable favor indeed! It is true that Robert d'Estouteville was a good soldier, that he had loyally raised his pennon against ""the league of public good,"" and that he had presented to the queen a very marvellous stag in confectionery on the day of her entrance to Paris in 14… Moreover, he possessed the good friendship of Messire Tristan l'Hermite, provost of the marshals of the king's household. Hence a very sweet and pleasant existence was that of Messire Robert. In the first place, very good wages, to which were attached, and from which hung, like extra bunches of grapes on his vine, the revenues of the civil and criminal registries of the provostship, plus the civil and criminal revenues of the tribunals of Embas of the Châtelet, without reckoning some little toll from the bridges of Mantes and of Corbeil, and the profits on the craft of Shagreen–makers of Paris, on the corders of firewood and the measurers of salt. Add to this the pleasure of displaying himself in rides about the city, and of making his fine military costume, which you may still admire sculptured on his tomb in the abbey of Valmont in Normandy, and his morion, all embossed at Montlhéry, stand out a contrast against the parti–colored red and tawny robes of the aldermen and police. And then, was it nothing to wield absolute supremacy over the sergeants of the police, the porter and watch of the Châtelet, the two auditors of the Châtelet, auditores castelleti, the sixteen commissioners of the sixteen quarters, the jailer of the Châtelet, the four enfeoffed sergeants, the hundred and twenty mounted sergeants, with maces, the chevalier of the watch with his watch, his sub–watch, his counter–watch and his rear–watch? Was it nothing to exercise high and low justice, the right to interrogate, to hang and to draw, without reckoning petty jurisdiction in the first resort (in prima instantia, as the charters say), on that viscomty of Paris, so nobly appanaged with seven noble bailiwicks? Can anything sweeter be imagined than rendering judgments and decisions, as Messire Robert d'Estouteville daily did in the Grand Châtelet, under the large and flattened arches of Philip Augustus? and going, as he was wont to do every evening, to that charming house situated in the Rue Galilee, in the enclosure of the royal palace, which he held in right of his wife, Madame Ambroise de Lore, to repose after the fatigue of having sent some poor wretch to pass the night in ""that little cell of the Rue de Escorcherie, which the provosts and aldermen of Paris used to make their prison; the same being eleven feet long, seven feet and four inches wide, and eleven feet high?""[28]"

Do you see? you will leave me my child, when you know! I am a poor girl of joy. It was the gypsies who stole it from me. I even kept his shoe for fifteen years. Here it is. She had that foot. At Reims ! The Chantefleurie! Rue Folle-Peine! You may have experienced this. It was me. In your youth, then, it was fine weather. We spent good quarters of an hour. You will take pity on me, will you not, my lords? The Egyptians stole it from me, they hid it from me for fifteen years. I thought she was dead. Imagine, my good friends, that I thought she was dead, I spent fifteen years here, in this cellar, without a fire in winter. It's hard, that. The poor dear little shoe! I cried so much that the good Lord heard me. Last night he gave me back my daughter. It's a miracle of God. She wasn't dead. You won't take it from me, I'm sure. Even if it was me, I wouldn't say, but her, a child of sixteen! give him time to see the sun! ""What did she do to you?"" Nothing at all. Me niether.

The good Lord, who is the master, did not give it back to me for nothing! The king ! you say the king! It won't give him much pleasure if they kill my little girl! And then the king is good! It's my daughter ! she's my daughter, mine! she is not the king! it is not yours! I want to leave ! we want to go!

She is my daughter, you see,—my dear little daughter whom I lost! Listen. It is quite a story. You must know that I was once very friendly with the soldiers. They were always kind to me in the days when little boys threw stones at me because I led a light life. Do you see? You will leave me my child, when you know all! I am a poor woman of the town. The gipsies stole her away from me. I kept her shoe for fifteen years. Stay; here it is. That was the size of her foot. Paquette Chantefleurie, at Rheims.—Rue Folle-Peine! Perhaps you knew her once. That was I. When you were young, you led a merry life; there were fine doings then. You will take pity on me, won’t you, gentlemen? The gipsies stole her from me; they kept her hidden from me for fifteen years. I thought she was dead. Only fancy, my kind friends, I thought she was dead. I have spent fifteen years here, in this cave, with never a spark of fire in winter. That was hard to bear, that was. The poor, dear little shoe! I have shed so many tears that the good God heard me. Last night he gave me back my girl. The good God wrought a miracle. She was not dead. You will not take her from me, I am sure. If it were only myself, I would not complain; but for her, a child of sixteen! Let her have time to see the sun! What has she done to you? Nothing at all. No more have I. If you only knew that I have nobody but her, that I am old, that she is a blessing sent down to me by the Holy Virgin! And then, you are all so kind! You did not know that she was my daughter; now you know it. Oh, I love her! Mr. Provost, I would rather have a hole through my heart than a scratch on her finger. You look like a good, kind gentleman! What I tell you, explains the whole thing, doesn’t it? Oh, if you ever had a mother, sir! You are the captain; leave me my child!

There is one thing which I must say to you. She is my daughter, do you see? my dear little daughter whom I had lost! Listen. It is quite a history. Consider that I knew the sergeants very well. They were always good to me in the days when the little boys threw stones at me, because I led a life of pleasure. Do you see? You will leave me my child when you know! I was a poor woman of the town. It was the Bohemians who stole her from me. And I kept her shoe for fifteen years. Stay, here it is. That was the kind of foot which she had. At Reims! La Chantefleurie! Rue Folle–Peine! Perchance, you knew about that. It was I. In your youth, then, there was a merry time, when one passed good hours. You will take pity on me, will you not, gentlemen? The gypsies stole her from me; they hid her from me for fifteen years. I thought her dead. Fancy, my good friends, believed her to be dead. I have passed fifteen years here in this cellar, without a fire in winter. It is hard. The poor, dear little shoe! I have cried so much that the good God has heard me. This night he has given my daughter back to me. It is a miracle of the good God. She was not dead. You will not take her from me, I am sure. If it were myself, I would say nothing; but she, a child of sixteen! Leave her time to see the sun! What has she done to you? nothing at all. Nor have I. If you did but know that she is all I have, that I am old, that she is a blessing which the Holy Virgin has sent to me! And then, you are all so good! You did not know that she was my daughter; but now you do know it. Oh! I love her! Monsieur, the grand provost. I would prefer a stab in my own vitals to a scratch on her finger! You have the air of such a good lord! What I have told you explains the matter, does it not? Oh! if you have had a mother, monsiegneur! you are the captain, leave me my child! Consider that I pray you on my knees, as one prays to Jesus Christ! I ask nothing of any one; I am from Reims, gentlemen; I own a little field inherited from my uncle, Mahiet Pradon. I am no beggar.

"Cependant la danseuse restait immobile sur le seuil de la porte. Son apparition avait produit sur ce groupe de jeunes filles un effet singulier. Il est certain qu’un vague et indistinct désir de plaire au bel officier les animait toutes à la fois, que le splendide uniforme était le point de mire de toutes leurs coquetteries, et que, depuis qu’il était présent, il y avait entre elles une certaine rivalité secrète, sourde, qu’elles s’avouaient à peine à elles-mêmes, et qui n’en éclatait pas moins à chaque instant dans leurs gestes et leurs propos. Néanmoins, comme elles étaient toutes à peu près dans la même mesure de beauté, elles luttaient à armes égales, et chacune pouvait espérer la victoire. L'arrivée de la bohémienne rompit brusquement cet équilibre. Elle était d’une beauté si rare qu’au moment où elle parut à l’entrée de l’appartement il sembla qu’elle y répandait une sorte de lumière qui lui était propre. Dans cette chambre resserrée, sous ce sombre encadrement de tentures et de boiseries, elle était incomparablement plus belle et plus rayonnante que dans la place publique. C'était comme un flambeau qu’on venait d’apporter du grand jour dans l’ombre. Les nobles damoiselles en furent malgré elles éblouies. Chacune se sentit en quelque sorte blessée dans sa beauté. Aussi leur front de bataille, qu’on nous passe l’expression, changea-t-il sur-le-champ, sans qu’elles se disent un seul mot. Mais elles s’entendaient à merveille. Les instincts de femmes se comprennent et se répondent plus vite que les intelligences d’hommes. Il venait de leur arriver une ennemie : toutes le sentaient, toutes se ralliaient. Il suffit d’une goutte de vin pour rougir tout un verre d’eau ; pour teindre d’une certaine humeur toute une assemblée de jolies femmes, il suffit de la survenue d’une femme plus jolie, – surtout lorsqu’il n’y a qu’un homme.","However, the dancer remained motionless on the threshold of the door. His appearance had produced a singular effect on this group of young girls. It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all at the same time, that the splendid uniform was the focal point of all their coquetry, and that, since he had been present, there had been between they had a certain secret, muffled rivalry, which they hardly admitted to themselves, and which nonetheless burst forth at every moment in their gestures and their words. However, as they were all roughly in the same measure of beauty, they fought on an equal footing, and each could hope for victory. The arrival of the gypsy abruptly upset this balance. She was so rare in beauty that the moment she appeared at the entrance to the apartment it seemed as if she was shedding a kind of light all her own. In this cramped room, under this dark frame of hangings and woodwork, she was incomparably more beautiful and more radiant than in the public square. It was like a torch that had just been brought into the shadows. The noble damsels were in spite of themselves dazzled. Each felt somehow hurt in her beauty. So their battle front, let's face it, he instantly changed, without them saying a single word. But they got along wonderfully. The instincts of women understand and respond to each other faster than the intelligences of men. An enemy had just arrived: all felt it, all rallied. It only takes one drop of wine to redden an entire glass of water; to put a certain mood on a whole congregation of pretty women, all it takes is the appearance of a prettier woman - especially when there is only one man.","But the dancer stood motionless at the door. Her appearance produced a strange effect upon the group of young girls. It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all alike; that his splendid uniform was the aim of all their coquetries; and that so long as he was present there was a certain secret lurking rivalry among them, which they hardly confessed to themselves, but which none the less appeared every instant in their gestures and words. Still, as they were possessed of an almost equal share of beauty, the contest was a fair one, and each might well hope for victory. The gipsy’s arrival abruptly destroyed this equilibrium. Her beauty was so remarkable that when she appeared on the threshold of the room she seemed to diffuse a sort of light peculiar to herself. Shut into this room, in this dark frame of hangings and wainscotting, she was incomparably more beautiful and more radiant than in the public square. She was like a torch brought from broad daylight into darkness. The noble maidens were dazzled in spite of themselves. Each of them felt her beauty in some sort impaired. Therefore their battle-front (if we may be pardoned the expression) changed at once, without exchanging a word. Still, they understood one another to perfection. The instincts of women read and reply to one another more rapidly than the understandings of men. An enemy had arrived; all felt it, all rallied for mutual support. A drop of wine is enough to redden a whole glass of water; the entrance of a prettier woman than themselves is enough to tinge a whole party of pretty women with a certain amount of ill-humor,—especially when there is but one man present.","Meanwhile, the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold. Her appearance had produced a singular effect upon these young girls.

Nevertheless, as they were all very nearly equal in beauty, they contended with equal arms, and each could hope for the victory.—The arrival of the gypsy suddenly destroyed this equilibrium. Her beauty was so rare, that, at the moment when she appeared at the entrance of the apartment, it seemed as though she diffused a sort of light which was peculiar to herself.

Each one felt herself, in some sort, wounded in her beauty. Hence, their battle front (may we be allowed the expression,) was immediately altered, although they exchanged not a single word. But they understood each other perfectly. Women's instincts comprehend and respond to each other more quickly than the intelligences of men. An enemy had just arrived; all felt it—all rallied together. One drop of wine is sufficient to tinge a glass of water red; to diffuse a certain degree of ill temper throughout a whole assembly of pretty women, the arrival of a prettier woman suffices, especially when there is but one man present."

"Cependant le jour continuait de baisser. L'être vivant qui existait encore en lui songea confusément au retour. Il se croyait loin de Paris ; mais, en s’orientant, il s’aperçut qu’il n’avait fait que tourner l’enceinte de l’Université. La flèche de Saint-Sulpice et les trois hautes aiguilles de Saint-Germain-des-Prés dépassaient l’horizon à sa droite. Il se dirigea de ce côté. Quand il entendit le qui-vive des hommes d’armes de l’abbé autour de la circonvallation crénelée de Saint-Germain, il se détourna, prit un sentier qui s’offrit à lui entre le moulin de l’abbaye et la maladrerie du bourg, et au bout de quelques instants se trouva sur la lisière du Pré-aux-Clercs. Ce pré était célèbre par les tumultes qui s’y faisaient jour et nuit; c’était l’hydre des pauvres moines de Saint-Germain, quod monachis Sancti-Germani pratensis hydra fuit, clericis nova semper dissidiorum capita suscitantibus. L'archidiacre craignit d’y rencontrer quelqu’un ; il avait peur de tout visage humain ; il venait d’éviter l’Université, le bourg Saint-Germain, il voulait ne rentrer dans les rues que le plus tard possible. Il longea le Pré-aux-Clercs, prit le sentier désert qui le séparait du Dieu-Neuf, et arriva enfin au bord de l’eau. Là, dom Claude trouva un batelier qui, pour quelques deniers parisis, lui fit remonter la Seine jusqu’à la pointe de la Cité, et le déposa sur cette langue de terre abandonnée où le lecteur a déjà vu rêver Gringoire, et qui se prolongeait au delà des jardins du roi, parallèlement à l’île du Passeur-aux-Vaches.","However, the day continued to decline. The living being that still existed in him thought vaguely of the return. He thought he was far from Paris; but, as he orientated himself, he found that he had only circled the University grounds. The spire of Saint-Sulpice and the three high needles of Saint-Germain-des-Prés protruded the horizon to its right. He walked over that way. When he heard the quivering of the abbot's men-at-arms around the crenellated circumvallation of Saint-Germain, he turned away, took a path which opened up to him between the abbey mill and the awkwardness of the town, and after a few moments found himself on the edge of Pré-aux-Clercs. This meadow was famous for the tumults which took place there day and night; it was the hydra of the poor monks of Saint-Germain, quod monachis Sancti-Germani pratensis hydra fuit, clericis nova semper dissidiorum capita eloquitantibus. The archdeacon was afraid to meet someone there; he was afraid of every human face; he had just avoided the University, the village of Saint-Germain, he wanted to return to the streets only as late as possible. He walked along the Pré-aux-Clercs, took the deserted path that separated him from the Dieu-Neuf, and finally came to the water's edge. There, Dom Claude found a boatman who, for a few deniers parisis, took him up the Seine to the Pointe de la Cité, and deposited him on this abandoned tongue of land where the reader has already seen Gringoire dreaming, and which continued beyond the king's gardens, parallel to the island of Passeur-aux-Vaches.","Meantime, the day continued to decline. That spark of life which still burned within him dreamed dimly of returning home. He fancied himself remote from Paris; but on examination he discovered that he had merely made the circuit of the University. The spire of Saint-Sulpice and the three lofty pinnacles of Saint-Germain-des-Prés rose above the horizon on his right. He proceeded in that direction. When he heard the challenge of the abbot’s men-at-arms around the battlemented walls of Saint-Germain he turned aside, took a footpath which he saw between the abbey mill and the lazaretto of the suburb, and in a few moments found himself at the edge of the Pré-aux-Clercs. This meadow was famous for the riots going on there continually, day and night; it was the “hydra-headed monster” of the poor monks of Saint-Germain: “Quod monachis Sancti-Germani pratensis hydra fuit, clericis nova semper dissidiorum capita suscitantibus. ”dj The archdeacon dreaded meeting some one there; he was afraid of any human face; he had shunned the University and the village of Saint-Germain; he was determined not to enter the city streets any earlier than he could help. He skirted the Pré-aux-Clercs, took the deserted path dividing it from the Dieu-Neuf, and at last reached the bank of the river. There he found a boatman, who for a few farthings rowed him up the Seine as far as the City, where he landed him on that strip of waste land where the reader has already seen Gringoire indulging in a reverie, and which extended beyond the king’s gardens, parallel with the island of the Passeur-aux-Vaches.","Meanwhile, the day continued to decline.

"Quand il rentra dans les rues, les passants qui se coudoyaient aux lueurs des devantures de boutiques lui faisaient l’effet d’une éternelle allée et venue de spectres autour de lui.

"Comme nous venons de le dire, le quartier de palais dont nous avons tâché de donner quelque idée au lecteur, en n’indiquant néanmoins que les sommités, emplissait l'angle que l’enceinte de Charles V faisait avec la Seine à l’orient. Le centre de la Ville était occupé par un monceau de maisons à peuple. C'était là en effet que se dégorgeaient les trois ponts de la Cité sur la rive droite, et les ponts font des maisons avant des palais. Cet amas d’habitations bourgeoises, pressées comme les alvéoles dans la ruche, avait sa beauté. Il en est des toits d’une capitale comme des vagues d’une mer, cela est grand. D’abord les rues, croisées et brouillées, faisaient dans le bloc cent figures amusantes. Autour des Halles, c’était comme une étoile à mille raies. Les rues Saint-Denis et Saint-Martin, avec leurs innombrables ramifications, montaient l’une après l’autre comme deux gros arbres qui mêlent leurs branches. Et puis, des lignes tortues, les rues de la Plâtrerie, de la Verrerie, de la Tixeranderie, etc., serpentaient sur le tout. Il y avait aussi de beaux édifices qui perçaient l’ondulation pétrifiée de cette mer de pignons. C'était, à la tête du Pont-aux-Changeurs derrière lequel on voyait mousser la Seine sous les roues du Pont-aux-Meuniers, c’était le Châtelet, non plus tour romaine comme sous Julien l’Apostat, mais tour féodale du treizième siècle, et d’une pierre si dure que le pic en trois heures n’en levait pas l’épaisseur du poing. C'était le riche clocher carré de Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, avec ses angles tout émoussés de sculptures, déjà admirable, quoiqu’il ne fût pas achevé au quinzième siècle. Il lui manquait en particulier ces quatre monstres qui, aujourd’hui encore, perchés aux encoignures de son toit, ont l’air de quatre sphinx qui donnent à deviner au nouveau Paris l’énigme de l’ancien; Rault, le sculpteur, ne les posa qu’en 1526, et il eut vingt francs pour sa peine. C'était la Maison-aux-Piliers, ouverte sur cette place de Grève dont nous avons donné quelque idée au lecteur. C'était Saint-Gervais, qu’un portail de bon go t a gâté depuis ; Saint-Méry dont les vieilles ogives étaient presque encore des pleins cintres ; Saint-Jean dont la magnifique aiguille était proverbiale ; c’étaient vingt autres monuments qui ne dédaignaient pas d’enfouir leurs merveilles dans ce chaos de rues noires, étroites et profondes. Ajoutez les croix de pierre sculptées plus prodiguées encore dans les carrefours que les gibets ; le cimetière des Innocents dont on apercevait au loin par-dessus les toits l’enceinte architecturale ; le pilori des Halles, dont on voyait le faîte entre deux cheminées de la rue de la Cossonnerie ; l’échelle de la Croix-du-Trahoir dans son carrefour toujours noir de peuple ; les masures circulaires de la Halle au blé ; les tronçons de l’ancienne clôture de Philippe-Auguste qu’on distinguait çà et là, noyés dans les maisons, tours rongées de lierre, portes ruinées, pans de murs croulants et déformés ; le quai avec ses mille boutiques et ses écorcheries saignantes ; la Seine chargée de bateaux du Port-au-Foin au For-l’Évêque ; et vous aurez une image confuse de ce qu’était en 1482 le trapèze central de la Ville.","As we have just said, the district of palaces of which we have tried to give some idea to the reader, while indicating only the luminaries, filled the angle which the enclosure of Charles V made with the Seine to the east. . The center of the city was occupied by a heap of houses for the people. It was there, in fact, that the three bridges of the City on the right bank were disgorged, and the bridges make houses before palaces. This cluster of bourgeois dwellings, pressed together like honeycombs in a beehive, had its beauty. It is with the roofs of a capital like waves of a sea, that is great. At first the streets, crossed and confused, made a hundred funny figures in the block. Around Les Halles, it was like a star with a thousand stripes. The streets of Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, with their innumerable ramifications, rose one after the other like two large trees intermingling their branches. And then, tortoise lines, the streets of La Plâtrerie, de la Verrerie, de la Tixeranderie, etc., meandered all over the place. There were also beautiful buildings that pierced the petrified ripple of this sea of gables. It was, at the head of the Pont-aux-Changeurs behind which we could see the Seine foaming under the wheels of the Pont-aux-Meuniers, it was the Châtelet, no longer a Roman tower as under Julien the Apostate, but a feudal tower of the thirteenth century, and of a stone so hard that the pick in three hours did not lift the thickness of the fist. It was the rich square bell tower of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, with its angles all blunt with carvings, already admirable, although it was not completed in the fifteenth century. He missed in particular those four monsters which, even today, perched in the corners of his roof, look like four sphinxes which give the new Paris to guess the enigma of the old; Rault, the sculptor, did not put them down until 1526, and he had twenty francs for his trouble. It was the Maison-aux-Piliers, open to the Place de Grève, of which we have given the reader some idea. It was Saint-Gervais, which a tasteful portal has since spoiled; Saint-Méry, whose old arches were almost still full arches; Saint-Jean, whose magnificent needle was proverbial; they were twenty other monuments which did not disdain to bury their wonders in this chaos of dark streets, narrow and deep. Add the sculpted stone crosses that are even more lavish in the crossroads than the gibbets; the cemetery of the Innocents, the architectural enclosure of which could be seen in the distance above the roofs; the Halles pillory, the top of which could be seen between two chimneys in the rue de la Cossonnerie; the scale of the Croix-du-Trahoir in its crossroads always black with people; the circular huts of the wheat market; the sections of the old Philippe-Auguste fence that could be seen here and there, drowned in the houses, towers eaten away by ivy, ruined doors, crumbling and deformed sections of walls; the quay with its thousand shops and bleeding flayings; the Seine laden with boats from Port-au-Foin to For-l'Évêque; and you will have a confused picture of what the city's central trapezoid was in 1482.","As we have just observed, the region of the Palace—some idea of which we have striven to give the reader, although alluding to its principal features only—filled up the angle formed on the east by the Seine and the boundary wall of Charles V. The heart of the Town was occupied by a group of common houses. There the three bridges leading from the City discharged themselves upon the right bank; and bridges lead to the building of houses rather than of palaces. This collection of ordinary houses, crowded together like cells in a hive, was not without a beauty of its own. The roofs of a great city have a certain grandeur, like the waves of the sea. In the first place, the streets, crossed and intertangled, formed a hundred droll figures; around the markets, they looked like a myriad-rayed star. The Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, with their endless ramifications, climbed the hill side by side, like two great trees with intermingling branches; and then crooked lines, like the Rues de la Plâtrerie, de la Verrerie, de la Tixeranderie, etc., twisted and wound in and out among the whole. There were also fine structures piercing through the fixed swell of this sea of gables. At the end of the Pont-aux-Changeurs, behind which the Seine foamed beneath the wheels of the Pont-aux-Meuniers, there was the Châtelet, no longer a Roman tower, as in the days of Julian the Apostate, but a feudal tower of the thirteenth century, and constructed of a stone so hard that three hours’ work with the pick would not remove a piece the size of a man’s fist ; there was the superb square bell-tower of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, all its angles softened by sculptures, even then worthy of admiration, although it was not finished in the fifteenth century. (It lacked particularly those four monsters which even yet, perched on the corners of its roof, look like four sphinxes giving modern Paris the riddle of the ancient Paris to solve. Rault the sculptor put them up in 1526, and he was paid only twenty francs for his pains!) There was the Maison-aux-Piliers, opening on the Place de Grève, of which we have already given the reader some idea; there was Saint-Gervais, which a porch “in good taste” has since spoiled; Saint-Méry, whose old pointed arches were a close approach to the semicircular; Saint-Jean, whose magnificent spire had passed into a proverb; there were at least twenty other edifices, which did not disdain to bury their marvels in this wilderness of deep, dark, and narrow streets. Add to this the carved stone crosses, even more abundant at cross-roads than gibbets; the Cemetery of the Innocents, whose wall, a fine specimen of architecture, was visible from a distance, over the house-tops; the pillory of les Halles, the top of which peeped between two chimneys in the Rue de la Cossonnerie; the “ladder” of the Croix-du-Trahoir at the cross-roads, always black with people; the circular booths of the Corn-market; the remains of the ancient wall of Philip Augustus, visible here and there, lost among the houses, towers overgrown with ivy, ruined gates, crumbling, shapeless fragments of masonry; the quay with its countless shops and its bloody knackers’ yards; the Seine, covered with boats, from the Port au Foin to For-l‘Evêque,—and you will have a dim idea of what the central portion of the town was in 1482.","As we have just said, the quarter of the palace, of which we have just endeavored to give the reader some idea by indicating only the chief points, filled the angle which Charles V.'s wall made with the Seine on the east. The centre of the Town was occupied by a pile of houses for the populace. It was there, in fact, that the three bridges disgorged upon the right bank, and bridges lead to the building of houses rather than palaces. That congregation of bourgeois habitations, pressed together like the cells in a hive, had a beauty of its own. It is with the roofs of a capital as with the waves of the sea,—they are grand.

The Rues Saint–Denis and Saint–Martin, with their innumerable ramifications, rose one after the other, like trees intertwining their branches; and then the tortuous lines, the Rues de la Plâtrerie, de la Verrerie, de la Tixeranderie, etc., meandered over all. There were also fine edifices which pierced the petrified undulations of that sea of gables. At the head of the Pont aux Changeurs, behind which one beheld the Seine foaming beneath the wheels of the Pont aux Meuniers, there was the Chalelet, no longer a Roman tower, as under Julian the Apostate, but a feudal tower of the thirteenth century, and of a stone so hard that the pickaxe could not break away so much as the thickness of the fist in a space of three hours; there was the rich square bell tower of Saint–Jacques de la Boucherie, with its angles all frothing with carvings, already admirable, although it was not finished in the fifteenth century. (It lacked, in particular, the four monsters, which, still perched to–day on the corners of its roof, have the air of so many sphinxes who are propounding to new Paris the riddle of the ancient Paris. Rault, the sculptor, only placed them in position in 1526, and received twenty francs for his pains.) There was the Maison–aux–Piliers, the Pillar House, opening upon that Place de Grève of which we have given the reader some idea; there was Saint–Gervais, which a front ""in good taste"" has since spoiled; Saint–Méry, whose ancient pointed arches were still almost round arches; Saint–Jean, whose magnificent spire was proverbial; there were twenty other monuments, which did not disdain to bury their wonders in that chaos of black, deep, narrow streets. Add the crosses of carved stone, more lavishly scattered through the squares than even the gibbets; the cemetery of the Innocents, whose architectural wall could be seen in the distance above the roofs; the pillory of the Markets, whose top was visible between two chimneys of the Rue de la Cossonnerie; the ladder of the Croix–du–Trahoir, in its square always black with people; the circular buildings of the wheat mart; the fragments of Philip Augustus's ancient wall, which could be made out here and there, drowned among the houses, its towers gnawed by ivy, its gates in ruins, with crumbling and deformed stretches of wall; the quay with its thousand shops, and its bloody knacker's yards; the Seine encumbered with boats, from the Port au Foin to Port–l'Evêque, and you will have a confused picture of what the central trapezium of the Town was like in 1482."

"L'homme à la lanterne marcha droit à la pointe du Terrain. Il y avait là, au bord extrême de l’eau, le débris vermoulu d’une haie de pieux maillée de lattes où une basse vigne accrochait quelques maigres branches étendues comme les doigts d’une main ouverte. Derrière, dans l’ombre que faisait ce treillis, une petite barque était cachée. L'homme fit signe à Gringoire et à sa compagne d’y entrer. La chèvre les y suivit. L'homme y descendit le dernier.

Then he cut the mooring line from the boat, dragged it away from the shore with a long fang, and, seizing two oars, sat down in the bow, rowing with all his might out to sea. The Seine is very rapid in this place, and he had enough difficulty in leaving the tip of the island.","The man with the lantern walked straight to the end of the Terrain.

"Les grands-blancs, les petits-blancs, les targes, les liards-à-l’aigle pleuvaient. Tout à coup elle passa devant Gringoire. Gringoire mit si étourdiment la main à sa poche qu’elle s’arrêta. – Diable ! dit le poète en trouvant au fond de sa poche la réalité, c’est-à-dire le vide. Cependant la jolie fille était là, le regardant avec ses grands yeux, lui tendant son tambour, et attendant. Gringoire suait à grosses gouttes. S'il avait eu le Pérou dans sa poche, certainement il l’eût donné à la danseuse ; mais Gringoire n’avait pas le Pérou, et d’ailleurs l’Amérique n’était pas encore découverte.","The great whites, the small whites, the targes, the eagle liards were raining. Suddenly she passed in front of Gringoire.

However the pretty girl was there, looking at him with her big eyes, handing him her drum, and waiting. Gringoire was sweating profusely. If he had had Peru in his pocket, he would certainly have given it to the dancer; but Gringoire did not have Peru, and America was not yet discovered.","Big pieces of silver, little pieces of silver, pennies, and farthings, rained into it.

But there stood the pretty girl, looking at him with her big eyes, holding out her tambourine, and waiting. Gringoire was in an agony. If he had had the wealth of Peru in his pocket, he would certainly have given it to the dancing-girl; but Gringoire did not possess the wealth of Peru, and moreover America had not then been discovered.","Big blanks, little blanks, targes[8] and eagle liards showered into it.

"Ce n’est pas que la blessure de Phœbus n’eût été grave, mais elle l’avait été moins que l’archidiacre ne s’en flattait. Le maître-myrrhe, chez lequel les soldats du guet l’avaient transporté dans le premier moment, avait craint huit jours pour sa vie, et le lui avait même dit en latin. Toutefois, la jeunesse avait repris le dessus ; et, chose qui arrive souvent, nonobstant pronostics et diagnostics, la nature s’était amusée à sauver le malade à la barbe du médecin. C'est tandis qu’il gisait encore sur le grabat du maître-myrrhe qu’il avait subi les premiers interrogatoires de Philippe Lheulier et des enquêteurs de l’official, ce qui l’avait fort ennuyé. Aussi, un beau matin, se sentant mieux, il avait laissé ses éperons d’or en paiement au pharmacopole, et s’était esquivé. Cela, du reste, n’avait apporté aucun trouble à l’instruction de l’affaire. La justice d’alors se souciait fort peu de la netteté et de la propreté d’un procès au criminel. Pourvu que l’accusé fût pendu, c’est tout ce qu’il lui fallait. Or, les juges avaient assez de preuves contre la Esmeralda. Ils avaient cru Phœbus mort, et tout avait été dit.","It was not that Phoebus's injury would not have been serious, but it had been less so than the Archdeacon expected. The master myrrh, to whom the soldiers of the watch had transported him at the first moment, had feared eight days for his life, and had even told him in Latin. However, the youth had gained the upper hand; and, something that often happens, notwithstanding prognoses and diagnoses, nature had fun saving the sick man with the doctor's beard. It was while he was still lying on the myrrh master's pallet that he had undergone the first interrogations of Philippe Lheulier and the official's investigators, which had bothered him. So one fine morning, feeling better, he had left his gold spurs in payment at the pharmacopoly, and slipped away. This, moreover, had not disturbed the investigation of the case. The courts of the day cared little for the neatness and neatness of a criminal trial. Provided the accused was hanged, that was all he needed. However, the judges had enough evidence against Esmeralda. They had believed Phoebus dead, and all had been said.","Not that Phœbus’s wound was not severe, but it was less so than the archdeacon flattered himself. The surgeon, to whose house the soldiers of the watch had at once carried him, had for a week feared for his life, and even told him so in Latin. However, youth triumphed ; and, as frequently happens, prognosis and diagnosis to the contrary, Nature amused herself by saving the patient in spite of the doctor. It was while he still lay upon his sick-bed that he underwent the first examination from Philippe Lheulier and the board of inquiry from the Bishop’s Court, which annoyed him exceedingly. Accordingly, one fine morning, feeling better, he left his golden spurs in payment of the doctor, and slipped away. This circumstance, moreover, did not at all disturb the legal proceedings. Justice in those days cared little for precision and accuracy in a criminal suit. Provided the prisoner were hanged, that was all that was necessary. Now, the judges had proof enough against Esmeralda. They believed Phoebus to be dead, and that was the end of the matter.","It was not that Phoebus's wound had not been serious, but it had not been as much so as the archdeacon believed. The physician, to whom the soldiers of the watch had carried him at the first moment, had feared for his life during the space of a week, and had even told him so in Latin. But youth had gained the upper hand; and, as frequently happens, in spite of prognostications and diagnoses, nature had amused herself by saving the sick man under the physician's very nose. It was while he was still lying on the leech's pallet that he had submitted to the interrogations of Philippe Lheulier and the official inquisitors, which had annoyed him greatly. Hence, one fine morning, feeling himself better, he had left his golden spurs with the leech as payment, and had slipped away. This had not, however, interfered with the progress of the affair.

"– Mauvaise ! reprit le poète. N’importe, vous ne m’irriterez pas. Tenez, vous m’aimerez peut-être en me connaissant mieux ; et puis vous m’avez conté votre histoire avec tant de confiance que je vous dois un peu la mienne. Vous saurez donc que je m’appelle Pierre Gringoire, et que je suis fils du fermier du tabellionage de Gonesse. Mon père a été pendu par les bourguignons et ma mère éventrée par les picards, lors du siège de Paris, il y a vingt ans. À six ans donc, j’étais orphelin, n’ayant pour semelle à mes pieds que le pavé de Paris. Je ne sais comment j’ai franchi l’intervalle de six ans à seize. Une fruitière me donnait une prune par-ci, un talmellier me jetait une croûte par-là ; le soir je me faisais ramasser par les onze-vingts qui me mettaient en prison, et je trouvais là une botte de paille. Tout cela ne m’a pas empêché de grandir et de maigrir, comme vous voyez. L'hiver, je me chauffais au soleil, sous le porche de l’hôtel de Sens, et je trouvais fort ridicule que le feu de la Saint-Jean fût réservé pour la canicule. À seize ans, j’ai voulu prendre un état. Successivement j’ai tâté de tout. Je me suis fait soldat ; mais je n’étais pas assez brave. Je me suis fait moine ; mais je n’étais pas assez dévot. Et puis, je bois mal. De désespoir, j’entrai apprenti parmi les charpentiers de la grande coignée ; mais je n’étais pas assez fort. J’avais plus de penchant pour être maître d’école ; il est vrai que je ne savais pas lire ; mais ce n’est pas une raison. Je m’aperçus au bout d’un certain temps qu’il me manquait quelque chose pour tout; et voyant que je n’étais bon à rien, je me fis de mon plein gré poète et compositeur de rythmes. C'est un état qu’on peut toujours prendre quand on est vagabond, et cela vaut mieux que de voler, comme me le conseillaient quelques jeunes fils brigandiniers de mes amis. Je rencontrai par bonheur un beau jour dom Claude Frollo, le révérend archidiacre de Notre-Dame. Il prit intérêt à moi, et c’est à lui que je dois d’être aujourd’hui un véritable lettré, sachant le latin depuis les Offices de Cicero jusqu’au Mortuologe des pères célestins, et n’étant barbare ni en scolastique, ni en poétique, ni en rythmique, ni même en hermétique, cette sophie des sophies. C'est moi qui suis l’auteur du mystère qu’on a représenté aujourd’hui avec grand triomphe et grand concours de populace en pleine grand’salle du Palais. J’ai fait aussi un livre qui aura six cents pages sur la comète prodigieuse de 1465 dont un homme devint fou. J’ai eu encore d’autres succès. Étant un peu menuisier d’artillerie, j’ai travaillé à cette grosse bombarde de Jean Maugue, que vous savez qui a crevé au Pont de Charenton le jour où l’on en a fait l’essai, et tué vingt-quatre curieux. Vous voyez que je ne suis pas un méchant parti de mariage. Je sais bien des façons de tours fort avenants que j’enseignerai à votre chèvre ; par exemple, à contrefaire l’évêque de Paris, ce maudit pharisien dont les moulins éclaboussent les passants tout le long du Pont-aux-Meuniers. Et puis, mon mystère me rapportera beaucoup d’argent monnayé, si l’on me le paie. Enfin, je suis à vos ordres, moi, et mon esprit, et ma science, et mes lettres, prêt à vivre avec vous, damoiselle, comme il vous plaira, chastement ou joyeusement, mari et femme, si vous le trouvez bon, frère et sœur, si vous le trouvez mieux.","- Nad ! resumed the poet. Regardless, you won't irritate me. Here, you might like me by knowing me better; and then you told me your story with so much confidence that I owe you mine. You will therefore know that my name is Pierre Gringoire, and that I am the son of the farmer of the Gonesse tabellionage. My father was hanged by the Burgundians and my mother disembowelled by the Picardies during the siege of Paris twenty years ago. At six years old, therefore, I was an orphan, having for sole at my feet only the pavement of Paris. I don't know how I got over the six to sixteen-year-old gap. A fruit grower gave me a plum here, a talmellier threw me a crust there; in the evening I was picked up by the eleven and twenty who put me in prison, and I found a bundle of straw there. All this hasn't stopped me from growing and losing weight, as you can see. In winter, I warmed myself in the sun, under the porch of the Hôtel de Sens, and I found it very ridiculous that the Saint-Jean fire was reserved for the heatwave. At sixteen, I wanted to take a state. Successively I dabbled in everything. I became a soldier; but I was not brave enough. I made myself a monk; but I was not devout enough. And then, I drink badly. In despair, I apprenticed among the carpenters of the great coignée; but I wasn’t strong enough. I was more inclined to be a schoolmaster; it is true that I did not know how to read; but that's no reason. I realized after a while that I was missing something for everything; and seeing that I was good for nothing, I willingly made myself a poet and composer of rhythms. It's a state you can still get when you're a wanderer, and it's better than stealing, as some young brigandine sons of my friends advised me. Fortunately, one fine day I met Dom Claude Frollo, the Reverend Archdeacon of Notre-Dame. He took an interest in me, and it is to him that I owe to be a true scholar today, knowing Latin from the Offices of Cicero to the Mortuologe of the celestial fathers, and not being barbarian nor in scholasticism, neither in poetics, nor in rhythm, nor even in hermetics, this sophie of sophies. It is I who am the author of the mystery which has been represented today with great triumph and a great concourse of the populace in the middle of the Great Hall of the Palace. I have also made a book which will have six hundred pages on the prodigious comet of 1465 about which a man went mad. I had other successes as well. Being a bit of an artillery carpenter, I worked on that big Jean Maugue bombard, which you know which burst at the Pont de Charenton the day it was tested, and killed twenty-four curious people. You see I'm not a bad wedding party. I know many ways of very pleasant tricks that I will teach your goat; for example, to counterfeit the bishop of Paris, this cursed Pharisee whose mills splash passers-by all along the Pont-aux-Meuniers. Besides, my mystery will earn me a lot of cash, if paid. Finally, I am at your command, me, and my mind, and my science, and my letters, ready to live with you, damsel, as you please, chastely or happily, husband and wife, if you find it good, brother and sister, if you find it better.","“Cruel girl!” replied the poet. “Never mind, you shall not vex me. Stay; perhaps you will love me when you know me better; and then you told me your history so confidingly that I owe you somewhat of mine. You must know, then, that my name is Pierre Gringoire, and that I am the son of the notary of Gonesse. My father was hanged by the Burgundians and my mother ripped up by the Picards, at the time of the siege of Paris, now twenty years ago. At the age of six years, therefore, I was left an orphan, with no sole to my foot but the pavement of Paris. I don’t know how I managed to exist from six to sixteen. A fruit-seller would give me a plum, a baker would throw me a crust; at nightfall I would contrive to be caught by the watch, who put me in prison, and there I found a bundle of straw. All this did not hinder me from growing tall and thin, as you see. In winter time I warmed myself in the sun, under the portico of the Hotel de Sens, and I thought it very absurd that the bale-fires of St. John should be deferred until the dog-days. At the age of sixteen I wished to learn a trade. I tried everything in turn. I became a soldier, but I was not brave enough. I turned monk, but I was not pious enough; and then, I’m no drinker. In despair, I became a carpenter’s apprentice, but I was not strong enough. I had more liking for the schoolmaster’s trade; true, I did not know how to read, but that was no hindrance. After a time, I discovered that I lacked some necessary quality for everything; and seeing that I was good for nothing, I became a poet and composer of rhymes, of my own free will. That is a trade that one can always take up when one is a vagabond; and it is better than stealing, as certain thievish young friends of mine advised. By good luck, I one fine day encountered Dom Claude Frollo, the reverend archdeacon of Notre-Dame. He took an interest in me, and it is to him I owe it that I am now a genuine man of letters, knowing Latin, from Cicero’s Offices to the necrology of the Celestine Fathers, and being ignorant of neither scholastics, poetry, nor rhythm, that sophism of sophisms. I am the author of the miracle-play performed today with great triumph, and before a great concourse of people, in the hall of the Palace. I have also written a book which will make six hundred pages, on the wonderful comet of 1465, which drove one man mad. I have also had other successes. Being somewhat of an engineer, I worked on Jean Maugue’s great bomb, which you know burst on Charenton Bridge the day that it was to be tested, and killed twenty-four of the curious spectators. You see that I am by no means a bad match. I know a great many sorts of delightful tricks which I will teach your goat; for instance, how to take off the Bishop of Paris, that accursed Parisian whose mills bespatter all those who pass over the Pont-aux-Meuniers. And then, my miracle-play will bring me in plenty of ready money if they pay me. Finally, I am at your service, I and my wit and my science and my learning, —ready to live with you, lady, as it may please you: soberly or merrily; as husband and wife if you see fit; as brother and sister if you prefer.”","""Naughty girl!"" retorted the poet. ""Never mind, you shall not provoke me. Wait, perhaps you will love me more when you know me better; and then, you have told me your story with so much confidence, that I owe you a little of mine. You must know, then, that my name is Pierre Gringoire, and that I am a son of the farmer of the notary's office of Gonesse. My father was hung by the Burgundians, and my mother disembowelled by the Picards, at the siege of Paris, twenty years ago. At six years of age, therefore, I was an orphan, without a sole to my foot except the pavements of Paris. I do not know how I passed the interval from six to sixteen.

In the winter I warmed myself in the sun, under the porch of the Hôtel de Sens, and I thought it very ridiculous that the fire on Saint John's Day was reserved for the dog days. At sixteen, I wished to choose a calling. I tried all in succession. I became a soldier; but I was not brave enough. I became a monk; but I was not sufficiently devout; and then I'm a bad hand at drinking. In despair, I became an apprentice of the woodcutters, but I was not strong enough; I had more of an inclination to become a schoolmaster; 'tis true that I did not know how to read, but that's no reason. I perceived at the end of a certain time, that I lacked something in every direction; and seeing that I was good for nothing, of my own free will I became a poet and rhymester. That is a trade which one can always adopt when one is a vagabond, and it's better than stealing, as some young brigands of my acquaintance advised me to do. One day I met by luck, Dom Claude Frollo, the reverend archdeacon of Notre–Dame. He took an interest in me, and it is to him that I to–day owe it that I am a veritable man of letters, who knows Latin from the de Officiis of Cicero to the mortuology of the Celestine Fathers, and a barbarian neither in scholastics, nor in politics, nor in rhythmics, that sophism of sophisms. I am the author of the Mystery which was presented to–day with great triumph and a great concourse of populace, in the grand hall of the Palais de Justice. I have also made a book which will contain six hundred pages, on the wonderful comet of 1465, which sent one man mad. I have enjoyed still other successes.

I know a great many sorts of very engaging tricks, which I will teach your goat; for example, to mimic the Bishop of Paris, that cursed Pharisee whose mill wheels splash passers–by the whole length of the Pont aux Meuniers. And then my mystery will bring me in a great deal of coined money, if they will only pay me. And finally, I am at your orders, I and my wits, and my science and my letters, ready to live with you, damsel, as it shall please you, chastely or joyously; husband and wife, if you see fit; brother and sister, if you think that better."""
"Il en était de sa voix comme de sa danse, comme de sa beauté. C'était indéfinissable et charmant ; quelque chose de pur, de sonore, d’aérien, d’ailé, pour ainsi dire. C'étaient de continuels épanouissements, des mélodies, des cadences inattendues, puis des phrases simples semées de notes acérées et sifflantes, puis des sauts de gammes qui eussent dérouté un rossignol, mais où l’harmonie se retrouvait toujours, puis de molles ondulations d’octaves qui s’élevaient et s’abaissaient comme le sein de la jeune chanteuse.

Fate has delivered us over to each other. Your life is in my hands; my soul rests in yours. Beyond this place and this night all is dark. Hear me, then. I am going to tell you— But first, speak not to me of your Phœbus.” (As he said this he came and went, like a man who cannot remain quietly in one place, dragging her after him.) “Speak not of him. If you but mention his name, I know not what I shall do, but it will be something terrible.”","""Listen!"" he said to her; and she shuddered at the sound of that fatal voice which she had not heard for a long time. He continued speaking with those brief and panting jerks, which betoken deep internal convulsions. "" Listen! we are here. I am going to speak to you. This is the Grève. This is an extreme point. Destiny gives us to one another. I am going to decide as to your life; you will decide as to my soul. Here is a place, here is a night beyond which one sees nothing. Then listen to me. I am going to tell you… In the first place, speak not to me of your Phoebus. (As he spoke thus he paced to and fro, like a man who cannot remain in one place, and dragged her after him.) Do not speak to me of him. Do you see? If you utter that name, I know not what I shall do, but it will be terrible."""

"J’avais su qui tu étais, égyptienne, bohémienne, gitane, zingara, comment douter de la magie ? Écoute. J’espérai qu’un procès me débarrasserait du charme. Une sorcière avait enchanté Bruno d’Ast, il la fit brûler et fut guéri. Je le savais. Je voulus essayer du remède. J’essayai d’abord de te faire interdire le parvis Notre-Dame, espérant t’oublier si tu ne revenais plus. Tu n’en tins compte. Tu revins. Puis il me vint l’idée de t’enlever. Une nuit je le tentai. Nous étions deux. Nous te tenions déjà, quand ce misérable officier survint. Il te délivra. Il commençait ainsi ton malheur, le mien et le sien. Enfin, ne sachant plus que faire et que devenir, je te dénonçai à l’official. Je pensais que je serais guéri, comme Bruno d’Ast. Je pensais aussi confusément qu’un procès te livrerait à moi, que dans une prison je te tiendrais, je t’aurais, que là tu ne pourrais m’échapper, que tu me possédais depuis assez longtemps pour que je te possédasse aussi à mon tour. Quand on fait le mal, il faut faire tout le mal. Démence de s’arrêter à un milieu dans le monstrueux! L'extrémité du crime a des délires de joie.

I hoped a trial would rid me of the spell. A witch had enchanted Bruno d'Ast, he had her burned and was healed. I knew it. I wanted to try some remedy. First I tried to get you banned from Notre Dame Square, hoping to forget you if you didn't come back. You didn’t take it into account. You came back. Then it occurred to me to kidnap you. One night I tried it. We were two. We were already holding you, when that miserable officer arrived. He delivered you. He thus began your misfortune, mine and hers. Finally, not knowing what to do and what to do with it, I reported you to the official. I thought I would be cured, like Bruno d´Ast.

A priest and a witch can melt into each other in delight on the straw bale of a dungeon!","“I had learned who you were,—a gipsy. How could I doubt your magic powers? I hoped that a criminal suit would set me free from your spell. A sorceress once enchanted Bruno d‘Ast; he had her burned alive, and was cured. I knew it. I decided to try this remedy. I at first attempted to have you forbidden all access to the square in front of Notre-Dame, hoping that I might forget you if you no longer came thither. You paid no heed to the prohibition; you returned. Then I thought of carrying you off. One night, I tried to do so. There were two of us. We already had you in our grasp, when that miserable officer appeared. He rescued you. He thus began your misfortune, mine, and his own. Finally, not knowing what to do or what would become of me, I denounced you to the judges. “I thought that I should be cured, like Bruno d‘Ast. I also vaguely thought that a criminal trial would make you mine; that in a prison I should have you, should be able to hold you mine; that there you could not escape me; that you had possessed me so long that I might well possess you in my turn.
