Ce bruit, d’abord faible, puis précis, puis lourd et sonore, s’approchait lentement, sans halte, sans interruption, avec une continuité tranquille et terrible. On n’entendait rien que cela. C’était tout ensemble le silence et le bruit de la statue du commandeur, mais ce pas de pierre avait on ne sait quoi d’énorme et de multiple qui éveillait l’idée d’une foule en même temps que l’idée d’un spectre. On croyait entendre marcher l’effrayante statue Légion. Ce pas approcha ; il approcha encore, et s’arrêta. Il sembla qu’on entendît au bout de la rue le souffle de beaucoup d’hommes. On ne voyait rien pourtant, seulement on distinguait tout au fond, dans cette épaisse obscurité, une multitude de fils métalliques, fins comme des aiguilles et presque imperceptibles, qui s’agitaient, pareils à ces indescriptibles réseaux phosphoriques qu’au moment de s’endormir on aperçoit, sous ses paupières fermées, dans les premiers brouillards du sommeil. C’étaient les bayonnettes et les canons de fusil confusément éclairés par la réverbération lointaine de la torche.","A few more moments passed, then the sound of footsteps, measured, heavy, numerous, was distinctly heard in the direction of Saint-Leu. This noise, at first faint, then precise, then heavy and sonorous, approached slowly, without halt, without interruption, with a tranquil and terrible continuity. We heard nothing but that. It was all together the silence and the noise of the statue of the commander, but this step in stone had something enormous and multiple about it that aroused the idea of a crowd at the same time as the idea of a ghost. We thought we heard the frightening Legion statue walking. This step approached; he approached again, and stopped. It seemed as if the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street. Nothing could be seen, however, only one could distinguish at the far end, in this thick darkness, a multitude of metallic wires, fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which were moving like those indescribable phosphoric networks that at the moment of falling asleep one sees, under his closed eyelids, in the first mists of sleep. There were bayonets and gun barrels dimly lit by the distant reverberation of the torch.","Another few minutes went by. Then from the direction of St-Leu the sound of footsteps could be heard distinctly – regular, thudding, numerous. This sound, faint at first, then clear, then heavy and reverberating, approached slowly, without cease, uninterrupted, with a calm and terrible continuousness. Nothing else could be heard. It was at once silence and the sound of the Commendatore’s statue, but that tread of stone had something tremendous and manifold about it that gave rise to the idea of a throng and at the same time the idea of a ghost. It sounded like the terrifying statue of Legion on the march. The tread came nearer. Nearer still it came, then stopped. The breathing of many men at the end of the street seemed to be audible. Yet nothing could be seen – except, just discernible in that pitch-darkness beyond, a multitude of metallic lines, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, moving restlessly like those indescribable phosphorescent patterns that you see beneath your closed eyelids in the first mists of sleep, just as you drift off. These were bayonets and gun barrels dimly lit by the distant reflection of the torch.","Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, heavy, and numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu. This sound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy and sonorous, approached slowly, without halt, without intermission, with a tranquil and terrible continuity. Nothing was to be heard but this. It was that combined silence and sound, of the statue of the commander, but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng, and, at the same time, the idea of a spectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marching onward. This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, and stopped. It seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath one’s closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the moment when one is dropping off to sleep. These were bayonets and gun-barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch.","A few moments more elapsed, then a sound of steps, measured, heavy, numerous, was distinctly heard from the direction of Saint Leu. This sound, at first faint, then distinct, then heavy and sonorous, approached slowly, without halt, without interruption, with a tranquil and terrible continuity. Nothing but this could be heard. It was at once the silence and the sound of the statue of the Commander, but this stony tread was so indescribably enormous and so multiplex, that it called up at the same time the idea of a throng and of a spectre. You would have thought you heard the stride of the fearful statue Legion. This tread approached; it approached still nearer, and stopped. They seemed to hear at the end of the street the breathing of many men. They saw nothing, however, only they discovered at the very end, in that dense obscurity, a multitude of metallic threads, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which we perceive under our closed eyelids at the moment of going to sleep, in the first mists of slumber. They were bayonets and musket barrels dimly lighted up by the distant reflection of the torch."
"Grâce à la révolution, les conditions sociales sont changées. Les maladies féodales et monarchiques ne sont plus dans notre sang. Il n’y a plus de moyen âge dans notre constitution. Nous ne sommes plus aux temps où d’effroyables fourmillements intérieurs faisaient irruption, où l’on entendait sous ses pieds la course obscure d’un bruit sourd, où apparaissaient à la surface de la civilisation on ne sait quels soulèvements de galeries de taupes, où le sol se crevassait, où le dessus des cavernes s’ouvrait, et où l’on voyait tout à coup sortir de terre des têtes monstrueuses.","Thanks to the revolution, social conditions are changed.

"― Rue Plumet ! tu dis rue Plumet ? ― Voyons donc ! ― N’y a-t-il pas une caserne par là ? ― Mais oui, c’est ça. Ton cousin Théodule m’en a parlé. Le lancier, l’officier. ― Une fillette, mon bon ami, une fillette ! ― Pardieu oui, rue Plumet. C’est ce qu’on appelait autrefois la rue Blomet. ― Voilà que ça me revient. J’en ai entendu parler de cette petite de la grille de la rue Plumet. Dans un jardin. Une Paméla. Tu n’as pas mauvais goût. On la dit proprette. Entre nous, je crois que ce dadais de lancier lui a un peu fait la cour. Je ne sais pas jusqu’où cela a été. Enfin ça ne fait rien. D’ailleurs il ne faut pas le croire. Il se vante. Marius ! je trouve ça très bien qu’un jeune homme comme toi soit amoureux. C’est de ton âge. Je t’aime mieux amoureux que jacobin. Je t’aime mieux épris d’un cotillon, sapristi ! de vingt cotillons que de monsieur de Robespierre. Pour ma part, je me rends cette justice qu’en fait de sans-culottes, je n’ai jamais aimé que les femmes. Les jolies filles sont les jolies filles, que diable ! il n’y a pas d’objection à ça. Quant à la petite, elle te reçoit en cachette du papa. C’est dans l’ordre. J’ai eu des histoires comme ça, moi aussi. Plus d’une. Sais-tu ce qu’on fait ? on ne prend pas la chose avec férocité ; on ne se précipite pas dans le tragique ; on ne conclut pas au mariage et à monsieur le maire avec son écharpe. On est tout bêtement un garçon d’esprit. On a du bon sens. Glissez, mortels, n’épousez pas. On vient trouver le grand-père qui est bonhomme au fond, et qui a bien toujours quelques rouleaux de louis dans un vieux tiroir ; on lui dit : Grand-père, voilà. Et le grand-père dit : C’est tout simple. Il faut que jeunesse se passe et que vieillesse se casse. J’ai été jeune, tu seras vieux. Va, mon garçon, tu rendras ça à ton petit-fils. Voilà deux cents pistoles. Amuse-toi, mordi ! Rien de mieux ! C’est ainsi que l’affaire doit se passer. On n’épouse point, mais ça n’empêche pas. Tu me comprends ?","- Plumet Street ! you say rue Plumet? ―Let's see! ""Isn't there a barracks over there?"" - Yes that's it. Your cousin Theodule told me about it. The lancer, the officer. ―A little girl, my good friend, a little girl! ―Pardieu yes, rue Plumet. This is what used to be called rue Blomet. ―It comes back to me. I heard about it from that little one at the Rue Plumet gate. In a garden. A Pamela. You don't have bad taste. It is said to be clean. Between us, I think that jerk of a lancer has been courting her a bit. I don't know how far it went. Finally it does nothing. Besides, you shouldn't believe it. He is boasting. Marius! I find it very good that a young man like you is in love. It's your age. I like you better in love than Jacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat, damn it! twenty petticoats than Monsieur de Robespierre. For my part, I do myself the justice that in terms of sans-culottes, I have never loved anyone but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, damn it! there is no objection to that. As for the little one, she receives you secretly from the father. It's in order. I've had stories like that, too. More than one. Do you know what we do? we don't take it with ferocity; one does not rush into tragedy; we do not conclude with marriage and the mayor with his scarf. We are quite simply a boy of spirit. We have common sense. Slip, mortals, do not wed. They come to find the grandfather, who is basically a good man, and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer; they say to him: Grandfather, there you are. And the grandfather said: It's very simple. Youth must pass and old age must break. I was young, you will be old. Come on, boy, you'll give it back to your grandson. Here are two hundred pistoles. Have fun, bitch! Nothing better ! This is how the business should be. We do not marry, but that does not prevent. You understand me ?","‘Rue Plumet! You said Rue Plumet? Now let’s see! Isn’t there a barracks near there? Of course, that’s it. Your cousin Théodule mentioned it to me. The lancer, the officer. A young filly, my dear fellow, a young filly! Yes, by God, Rue Plumet. It used to be called Rue Blomet. It all comes back to me now. I’ve heard talk of that girl behind the railings in Rue Plumet. In a garden. A Pamela. Not a bad choice. She’s very well turned out, I’m told. Between ourselves, I think that booby of a lancer courted her a little. I don’t know how far it went. Anyway, it doesn’t matter. Besides, he’s not to be believed. He’s a braggart, Marius! I think it’s very acceptable that a young man like you should be in love. It’s natural at your age. I like you better for being in love than for being a Jacobin. I like you better for running after a woman – good heavens, twenty women – than for being enamoured of Monsieur de Robespierre. For my part, I give myself credit for the fact that the only sans-culottes I ever liked were women! * Pretty girls are pretty girls, damn it! There’s no denying that. As for your sweetheart, she’s seeing you in secret, keeping her father in the dark. That’s the way these things are done. I had affairs like that too. More than one. You know how to deal with it? You don’t take it too seriously. You don’t go making a tragedy of it. You don’t decide to get wed with monsieur le maire in his sash presiding. You just stick to being a clever lad. You’re sensible. “So, Lightly touch and quickly go” and no getting married. You come and look up your grandfather, who’s a good fellow at heart and always has a few rolls of gold coins in some old drawer. You say to him, “Grandfather, it’s like this.” And your grandfather says, “It’s only natural!” The young must live and the old must die. I’ve been young, and you’ll be old. Now, my boy, you pass that on to your grandson. Here’s two thousand francs. Enjoy yourself, by God! Best thing you can do! That’s the way to deal with it. There’s no reason to get married. You understand?’","“The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you say?—Let us see!—Are there not barracks in that vicinity?—Why, yes, that’s it. Your cousin Théodule has spoken to me about it. The lancer, the officer. A gay girl, my good friend, a gay girl!—Pardieu, yes, the Rue Plumet. It is what used to be called the Rue Blomet.—It all comes back to me now. I have heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the Rue Plumet. In a garden, a Pamela. Your taste is not bad. She is said to be a very tidy creature. Between ourselves, I think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting her a bit. I don’t know where he did it. However, that’s not to the purpose. Besides, he is not to be believed. He brags, Marius! I think it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love. It’s the right thing at your age. I like you better as a lover than as a Jacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat, sapristi! with twenty petticoats, than with M. de Robespierre. For my part, I will do myself the justice to say, that in the line of sans-culottes, I have never loved any one but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the deuce! There’s no objection to that. As for the little one, she receives you without her father’s knowledge. That’s in the established order of things. I have had adventures of that same sort myself. More than one. Do you know what is done then? One does not take the matter ferociously; one does not precipitate himself into the tragic; one does not make one’s mind to marriage and M. le Maire with his scarf. One simply behaves like a fellow of spirit. One shows good sense. Slip along, mortals; don’t marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who is a good-natured fellow at bottom, and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer; you say to him: ‘See here, grandfather.’ And the grandfather says: ‘That’s a simple matter. Youth must amuse itself, and old age must wear out. I have been young, you will be old. Come, my boy, you shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two hundred pistoles. Amuse yourself, deuce take it!’ Nothing better! That’s the way the affair should be treated. You don’t marry, but that does no harm. You understand me?”","“Rue Plumet!—you say Rue Plumet?—Let us see now!—Are there not some barracks down there? Why yes, that is it. Your cousin Théodule has told me about her. The lancer, the officer.—A lassie, my good friend, a lassie!—Lord yes, Rue Plumet. That is what used to be called Rue Blomet. It comes back to me now. I have heard tell about this little girl of the grating in the Rue Plumet. In a garden, a Pamela. Your taste is not bad. They say she is nice. Between ourselves, I believe that ninny of a lancer has paid his court to her a little. I do not know how far it went. After all that does not amount to anything. And then, we must not believe him. He is a boaster. Marius! I think it is very well for a young man like you to be in love. It belongs to your age. I like you better in love than as a Jacobin. I like you better taken by a petticoat, Lord! by twenty petticoats, than by Monsieur de Robespierre. For my part, I do myself this justice that in the matter of sansculottes, I have never liked anything but women. Pretty women are pretty women, the devil! there is no objection to that. As to the little girl, she receives you unknown to papa. That is all right. I have had adventures like that myself. More than one. Do you know how we do? we don’t take the thing ferociously; we don’t rush into the tragic; we don’t conclude with marriage and with Monsieur the Mayor and his scarf. We are altogether a shrewd fellow. We have good sense. Slip over it, mortals, don’t marry. We come and find grandfather who is a goodman at heart, and who almost always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer; we say to him: ‘Grandfather, that’s how it is.’ And grandfather says: ‘That is all natural. Youth must fare and old age must wear. I have been young, you will be old. Go on, my boy, you will repay this to your grandson. There are two hundred pistoles. Amuse yourself, roundly! Nothing better! that is the way the thing should be done. We don’t marry, but that doesn’t hinder.’ You understand me?”"

"A l’instant où l’insurrection, surgissant du choc du peuple et de la troupe devant l’Arsenal, détermina un mouvement d’avant en arrière dans la multitude qui suivait le corbillard et qui, de toute la longueur des boulevards, pesait, pour ainsi dire, sur la tête du convoi, ce fut un effrayant reflux. La cohue s’ébranla, les rangs se rompirent, tous coururent, partirent, s’échappèrent, les uns avec les cris de l’attaque, les autres avec la pâleur de la fuite. Le grand fleuve qui couvrait les boulevards se divisa en un clin d’œil, déborda à droite et à gauche et se répandit en torrents dans deux cents rues à la fois avec le ruissellement d’une écluse lâchée. En ce moment un enfant déguenillé qui descendait par la rue Ménilmontant, tenant à la main une branche de faux-ébénier en fleur qu’il venait de cueillir sur les hauteurs de Belleville, avisa dans la devanture de boutique d’une marchande de bric-à-brac un vieux pistolet d’arçon. Il jeta sa branche fleurie sur le pavé, et cria :","At the moment when the insurrection, arising from the shock of the people and the troops in front of the Arsenal, determined a movement back and forth in the multitude which followed the hearse and which, from the whole length of the boulevards, weighed down, so to speak, at the head of the convoy, there was a frightful ebb. The crowd broke up, the ranks broke, all ran, left, escaped, some with the cries of the attack, others with the pallor of flight. The great river which covered the boulevards divided in the twinkling of an eye, overflowed right and left, and poured out in torrents through two hundred streets at a time with the trickle of a loose sluice. At this moment a ragged child walking down the rue Ménilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of flowering false ebony which he had just picked on the heights of Belleville, saw in the front of the shop a bric-a-brac seller. at brac an old pommel pistol. He threw his flowering branch on the pavement, and cried:","At that moment during the insurrection when the people and the troops suddenly came up against each other in front of the Arsenal, the forward motion of the multitude following the hearse all the way down the boulevards – pressing, as it were, on the head of the procession – was thrown into reverse, causing a terrifying backward surge. The crowd swayed, broke ranks; everybody ran, bolted, fled, some with cries of attack, others with the pallor of flight. The great river filling the boulevards divided in the blink of an eye, overflowed to right and left and went rushing down two hundred streets at once like water pouring from an opened sluice gate. At that moment a ragged child, coming down Rue Ménilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of laburnum blossom he had just picked on the heights of Belleville, caught sight of an old saddle pistol on display outside a bric-à-brac shop. Throwing his branch of blossom to the ground, he cried, ‘Mère Thingummy, I’m borrowing this what’s-it of yours!’","At the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock of the populace and the military in front of the Arsenal, started a movement in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the hearse and which, through the whole length of the boulevards, weighed, so to speak, on the head of the procession, there arose a frightful ebb. The rout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, made their escape, some with shouts of attack, others with the pallor of flight. The great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling, overflowed to right and left, and spread in torrents over two hundred streets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose.

The mass wavered, the ranks broke, all ran, darted, slipped away, some with cries of attack, others with the pallor of flight. The great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling, overflowed on the right and on the left, and poured in torrents into two hundred streets at once with the rushing of an opened mill-sluice. At this moment a ragged child who was coming down the Rue Ménilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of laburnum in bloom, which he had just gathered on the heights of Belleville, caught sight, before a second-hand dealer’s shop, of an old horse pistol.

"Ce qui s’était passé peut être dit en quelques mots. Éponine avait tout fait. Après la soirée du 3 juin, elle avait eu une double pensée, déjouer les projets de son père et des bandits sur la maison de la rue Plumet, et séparer Marius de Cosette. Elle avait changé de guenilles avec le premier jeune drôle venu qui avait trouvé amusant de s’habiller en femme pendant qu’Éponine se déguisait en homme. C’était elle qui au Champ de Mars avait donné à Jean Valjean l’avertissement expressif : Déménagez. Jean Valjean était rentré en effet et avait dit à Cosette : Nous partons ce soir et nous allons rue de l’Homme-Armé avec Toussaint. La semaine prochaine nous serons à Londres. Cosette, atterrée de ce coup inattendu, avait écrit en hâte deux lignes à Marius. Mais comment faire mettre la lettre à la poste ? Elle ne sortait pas seule, et Toussaint, surprise d’une telle commission, eût à coup sûr montré la lettre à M. Fauchelevent. Dans cette anxiété, Cosette avait aperçu à travers la grille Éponine en habits d’homme, qui rôdait maintenant sans cesse autour du jardin. Cosette avait appelé « ce jeune ouvrier » et lui avait remis cinq francs et la lettre, en lui disant : Portez cette lettre tout de suite à son adresse. Éponine avait mis la lettre dans sa poche. Le lendemain 5 juin, elle était allée chez Courfeyrac demander Marius, non pour lui remettre la lettre, mais, chose que toute âme jalouse et aimante comprendra, « pour voir ». Là elle avait attendu Marius, ou au moins Courfeyrac, — toujours pour voir. — Quand Courfeyrac lui avait dit : nous allons aux barricades, une idée lui avait traversé l’esprit. Se jeter dans cette mort-là comme elle se serait jetée dans toute autre, et y pousser Marius. Elle avait suivi Courfeyrac, s’était assurée de l’endroit où l’on construisait la barricade ; et bien sûre, puisque Marius n’avait reçu aucun avis et qu’elle avait intercepté la lettre, qu’il serait à la nuit tombante au rendez-vous de tous les soirs, elle était allée rue Plumet, y avait attendu Marius, et lui avait envoyé, au nom de ses amis, cet appel qui devait, pensait-elle, l’amener à la barricade. Elle comptait sur le désespoir de Marius quand il ne trouverait pas Cosette ; elle ne se trompait pas. Elle était retournée de son côté rue de la Chanvrerie. On vient de voir ce qu’elle y avait fait. Elle était morte avec cette joie tragique des cœurs jaloux qui entraînent l’être aimé dans leur mort, et qui disent : personne ne l’aura !","What happened can be said in a few words. Éponine had done everything. After the evening of June 3, she had had a double thought, to foil the plans of her father and the bandits on the house in the rue Plumet, and to separate Marius from Cosette. She had changed rags with the first young fellow who had found it amusing to dress as a woman while Éponine disguised herself as a man. It was she who at the Champ de Mars had given Jean Valjean the express warning: Move out. Jean Valjean had indeed returned and had said to Cosette: We are leaving this evening and we are going to the Rue de l'Homme-Armé with Toussaint. Next week we will be in London. Cosette, overwhelmed by this unexpected blow, had hastily written two lines to Marius. But how to get the letter mailed? She did not go out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such an errand, would certainly have shown the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this anxiety, Cosette had seen through the gate Éponine in men's clothes, who was now prowling incessantly around the garden. Cosette had called ""this young workman"" and had given him five francs and the letter, saying to him: Take this letter at once to his address. Éponine had put the letter in her pocket. The next day, June 5, she had gone to Courfeyrac to ask for Marius, not to give him the letter, but, something that every jealous and loving soul will understand, ""to see."" There she had waited for Marius, or at least Courfeyrac—always to see. — When Courfeyrac had said to him: we are going to the barricades, an idea had crossed his mind. To throw herself into that death as she would have thrown herself into any other, and push Marius into it. She had followed Courfeyrac, had made sure of the place where the barricade was being built; and of course, since Marius had received no notice and she had intercepted the letter, that he would be at nightfall at the rendezvous every evening, she had gone to rue Plumet, had waited for Marius there, and had sent her, in the name of her friends, this appeal which must, she thought, lead her to the barricade. She counted on Marius' despair when he did not find Cosette; she was not mistaken. She had returned to her side of the rue de la Chanvrerie. We just saw what she had done there. She had died with that tragic joy of jealous hearts which drag the loved one into their death, and which say: no one will have it!","What had happened may be told in a few words. Éponine was responsible for everything. Following that evening of the third of June, her intention had been twofold: to thwart her father and those villains in their designs on the house in Rue Plumet, and to keep Marius away from Cosette. She had swapped her ragged clothes for those of the first young joker to come along who found it amusing to dress up as a woman while Éponine disguised herself as a man. It was she who in the Champ de Mars had given Jean Valjean that explicit warning: ‘Move house.’ Jean Valjean had actually gone home and said to Cosette, ‘We’re leaving this evening and going to Rue de l’Homme-Armé with Toussaint. Next week, we’ll be in London.’ Shocked by this unexpected blow, Cosette had hastily written a few lines to Marius. But how was the letter to be delivered? She never went out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such an errand, would certainly have shown the letter to Monsieur Fauchelevent. In her perplexity Cosette had caught sight through the railings of Éponine dressed as a man, who now prowled around the garden incessantly. Cosette had called ‘this young workman’ to her and handed over five francs and the letter, saying, ‘Take this letter straight away to its destination.’ Éponine put the letter in her pocket. The next day, on the fifth of June, she went to Courfeyrac’s and asked for Marius, not to deliver the letter but, something every jealous and loving heart will understand, ‘just to see’. There she waited for Marius, or at least for Courfeyrac – still, just to see. When Courfeyrac told her ‘We’re going to the barricades’ an idea entered her mind. To cast herself into that death as she would have cast herself into any death, and to ensure that Marius did likewise. She had followed Courfeyrac and made sure of where the barricade was being built. And quite certain, since Marius had received no warning and she had intercepted the letter, that he would be at the meeting-place he came to every evening at nightfall , she had gone to Rue Plumet, waited for Marius there, and made that appeal to him in the name of his friends that she thought would bring him to the barricade. She was counting on Marius’s despair when he failed to find Cosette. She had not been mistaken. She herself returned to Rue de la Chanvrerie. We have just seen what she did there. She died feeling that tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag their beloved into death with them, and who say, ‘No one shall have him!’","What had taken place may be related in a few words. Éponine had been the cause of everything. After the evening of the 3d of June she had cherished a double idea, to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius and Cosette. She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman, while Éponine disguised herself like a man. It was she who had conveyed to Jean Valjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning: “Leave your house.” Jean Valjean had, in fact, returned home, and had said to Cosette: “We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l’Homme Armé with Toussaint. Next week, we shall be in London.” Cosette, utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow, had hastily penned a couple of lines to Marius. But how was she to get the letter to the post? She never went out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such a commission, would certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this dilemma, Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Éponine in man’s clothes, who now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette had called to “this young workman” and had handed him five francs and the letter, saying: “Carry this letter immediately to its address.” Éponine had put the letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th of June, she went to Courfeyrac’s quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose of delivering the letter, but,—a thing which every jealous and loving soul will comprehend,—“to see.” There she had waited for Marius, or at least for Courfeyrac, still for the purpose of seeing. When Courfeyrac had told her: “We are going to the barricades,” an idea flashed through her mind, to fling herself into that death, as she would have done into any other, and to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac, had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of construction; and, quite certain, since Marius had received no warning, and since she had intercepted the letter, that he would go at dusk to his trysting place for every evening, she had betaken herself to the Rue Plumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of his friends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the barricade. She reckoned on Marius’ despair when he should fail to find Cosette; she was not mistaken. She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself. What she did there the reader has just seen. She died with the tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death, and who say: “No one shall have him!”","What happened may be told in a few words.

"A la barricade de la rue des Ménétriers, un homme bien mis distribuait de l’argent aux travailleurs.

"Tant que dura le mois de mai de cette année 1832, il y eut là, toutes les nuits, dans ce pauvre jardin sauvage, sous cette broussaille chaque jour plus odorante et plus épaissie, deux êtres composés de toutes les chastetés et de toutes les innocences, débordant de toutes les félicités du ciel, plus voisins des archanges que des hommes, purs, honnêtes, enivrés, rayonnants, qui resplendissaient l’un pour l’autre dans les ténèbres. Il semblait à Cosette que Marius avait une couronne et à Marius que Cosette avait un nimbe. Ils se touchaient, ils se regardaient, ils se prenaient les mains, ils se serraient l’un contre l’autre ; mais il y avait une distance qu’ils ne franchissaient pas. Non qu’ils la respectassent ; ils l’ignoraient. Marius sentait une barrière, la pureté de Cosette, et Cosette sentait un appui, la loyauté de Marius. Le premier baiser avait été aussi le dernier. Marius, depuis, n’était pas allé au delà d’effleurer de ses lèvres la main, ou le fichu, ou une boucle de cheveux de Cosette. Cosette était pour lui un parfum et non une femme. Il la respirait. Elle ne refusait rien et il ne demandait rien. Cosette était heureuse, et Marius était satisfait. Ils vivaient dans ce ravissant état qu’on pourrait appeler l’éblouissement d’une âme par une âme.

"La visite eut lieu. Ce fut une campagne redoutable ; une bataille nocturne contre la peste et l’asphyxie. Ce fut en même temps un voyage de découvertes. Un des survivants de cette exploration, ouvrier intelligent, très jeune alors, en racontait encore il y a quelques années les curieux détails que Bruneseau crut devoir omettre dans son rapport au préfet de police, comme indignes du style administratif. Les procédés désinfectants étaient à cette époque très rudimentaires. A peine Bruneseau eut-il franchi les premières articulations du réseau souterrain, que huit des travailleurs sur vingt refusèrent d’aller plus loin. L’opération était compliquée ; la visite entraînait le curage ; il fallait donc curer, et en même temps arpenter ; noter les entrées d’eau, compter les grilles et les bouches, détailler les branchements, indiquer les courants à points de partage, reconnaître les circonscriptions respectives des divers bassins, sonder les petits égouts greffés sur l’égout principal, mesurer la hauteur sous clef de chaque couloir, et la largeur, tant à la naissance des voûtes qu’à fleur du radier, enfin déterminer les ordonnées du nivellement au droit de chaque entrée d’eau, soit du radier de l’égout, soit du sol de la rue. On avançait péniblement. Il n’était pas rare que les échelles de descente plongeassent dans trois pieds de vase. Les lanternes agonisaient dans les miasmes. De temps en temps, on emportait un égoutier évanoui. A de certains endroits, précipice. Le sol s’était effondré, le dallage avait croulé, l’égout s’était changé en puits perdu ; on ne trouvait plus le solide ; un homme disparut brusquement ; on eut grand’peine à le retirer. Par le conseil de Fourcroy, on allumait de distance en distance, dans les endroits suffisamment assainis, de grandes cages pleines d’étoupe imbibée de résine. La muraille, par places, était couverte de fongus difformes, et l’on eût dit des tumeurs ; la pierre elle-même semblait malade dans ce milieu irrespirable.","The visit took place. It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal battle against pestilence and asphyxiation. It was also a voyage of discovery. One of the survivors of this exploration, an intelligent workman, very young then, still recounted some years ago the curious details which Bruneseau thought he should omit in his report to the prefect of police, as unworthy of the administrative style. The disinfectant processes were at that time very rudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first joints of the underground network when eight out of twenty workers refused to go any further. The operation was complicated; the visit entailed the cleaning out; it was therefore necessary to clear out, and at the same time to survey; note the water inlets, count the grids and mouths, detail the connections, indicate the currents at the dividing points, recognize the respective circumscriptions of the various basins, probe the small sewers grafted onto the main sewer, measure the height under lock and key of each corridor, and the width, both at the birth of the vaults and flush with the apron, finally determine the ordinates of the leveling at the right of each water inlet, either from the apron of the sewer, or from the ground of the street . We progressed painfully. It was not uncommon for companionway ladders to dip into three feet of mud. The lanterns were dying in the miasma. From time to time, a fainted sewer was taken away. In some places, precipice. The ground had collapsed, the paving had crumbled, the sewer had turned into a cesspool; the solid could no longer be found; a man suddenly disappeared; we had great difficulty in removing it. On Fourcroy's advice, large cages full of tow soaked in resin were lit from time to time, in places sufficiently sanitized. The wall, in places, was covered with deformed fungus, and one would have said tumors; the stone itself seemed ill in this unbreathable environment.","The visit took place.

Disinfection procedures were very rudimentary in those days. Bruneseau had hardly gone beyond the first intersections of that subterranean network when eight of the twenty workmen refused to go any further. The operation was complicated. The visit involved cleaning. So there was cleaning to be done, and at the same time surveying: noting water inlets, counting gratings and outlets, detailing the branch structure, indicating the currents where the waters divided, identifying the respective perimeters of the various sewage basins, probing the smaller drains grafted on to the main drain, measuring the maximum height of each drain and the width, at the base of the vault as well as at floor level, and lastly plotting the level of every water inlet relative to both drain floor and street. Progress was arduous. It was not uncommon for the ladders descending into the sewers to plunge into three feet of sludge. The lamps guttered in the miasmic fumes. Every now and then a sewerman was carried out unconscious. At certain points, a precipitous drop. The ground had given way, the paving had collapsed, the drain had turned into a soak-pit. There was nothing solid left. A man suddenly disappeared. He was rescued with the greatest difficulty. On the advice of Fourcroy they lighted, at regular intervals, in duly sanitized locations, big wire-mesh containers filled with resin-soaked tow. The wall was covered in some places with gnarled fungi that looked like tumours. The very stone itself seemed diseased in this unbreathable atmosphere.","The visit took place.

The processes of disinfection were, at that epoch, extremely rudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first articulations of that subterranean network, when eight laborers out of the twenty refused to go any further. The operation was complicated; the visit entailed the necessity of cleaning; hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same time, to proceed; to note the entrances of water, to count the gratings and the vents, to lay out in detail the branches, to indicate the currents at the point where they parted, to define the respective bounds of the divers basins, to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal sewer, to measure the height under the key-stone of each drain, and the width, at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom, in order to determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each water-entrance, either of the bottom of the arch, or on the soil of the street. They advanced with toil. The lanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere. From time to time, a fainting sewerman was carried out. At certain points, there were precipices. The soil had given away, the pavement had crumbled, the sewer had changed into a bottomless well; they found nothing solid; a man disappeared suddenly; they had great difficulty in getting him out again. On the advice of Fourcroy, they lighted large cages filled with tow steeped in resin, from time to time, in spots which had been sufficiently disinfected. In some places, the wall was covered with misshapen fungi,—one would have said tumors; the very stone seemed diseased within this unbreathable atmosphere.","THE VISIT was made.

"Il se remit à marcher et alla à l’autre bout du salon. A l’instant où il se retourna, il s’aperçut que Marius le regardait marcher. Alors il lui dit avec un accent inexprimable :","He started walking again and went to the other end of the living room. The moment he turned, he perceived that Marius was watching him walk. Then he said to him with an inexpressible accent:","He started moving about again, and walked to the other end of the drawing room. As he turned round he noticed that Marius was watching him. Then in an indescribable tone of voice he said, ‘I drag my leg a little.","He took up his march again, and walked to the other end of the drawing-room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived that Marius was watching his walk. Then he said, with an inexpressible intonation:","He resumed his walk and went to the other end of the parlour.

"Fallait-il donc finir là ? Que faire ? que devenir ? Rétrograder ; recommencer le trajet effrayant qu’il avait déjà parcouru ; il n’en avait pas la force. D’ailleurs, comment traverser de nouveau cette fondrière d’où l’on ne s’était tiré que par miracle ? Et après la fondrière, n’y avait-il pas cette ronde de police à laquelle, certes, on n’échapperait pas deux fois ? Et puis où aller ? quelle direction prendre ? Suivre la pente, ce n’était point aller au but. Arrivât-on à une autre issue, on la trouverait obstruée d’un tampon ou d’une grille. Toutes les sorties étaient indubitablement closes de cette façon. Le hasard avait descellé la grille par laquelle on était entré, mais évidemment toutes les autres bouches de l’égout étaient fermées. On n’avait réussi qu’à s’évader dans une prison.","Should it end there? What to do ? what to become? Downgrade; repeating the scary journey he had already traveled; he didn't have the strength. Besides, how to cross again this quagmire from which one had only escaped by a miracle? And after the quagmire, was there not this round of police which, of course, we would not escape twice? And then where to go? which direction to take? To follow the slope was not to go to the goal. Should we arrive at another exit, we would find it obstructed by a plug or a grating. All the exits were undoubtedly closed in this way. Chance had loosened the grating by which we had entered, but evidently all the other mouths of the sewer were closed. We had only managed to escape in a prison.","So must it end here? What could he do? What was to become of them? Go back, retrace the terrifying route he had already taken – he had not the strength for it. Besides, how was he to go back through that quagmire from which they had escaped only by a miracle? And after the quagmire, was there not the police patrol, which they surely would not evade twice? And then, where was he to go? What direction to take? Following the incline was no guarantee of being able to get out. Even if they were to reach another outlet, they would find it blocked by a manhole cover or a grating. Undoubtedly, every exit was likewise shut off. Chance had loosened the grating by which they had entered, but of course every other sewer mouth was closed. They had succeeded only in escaping into a prison.","Must he then stop there? What was he to do? What was to become of him? He had not the strength to retrace his steps, to recommence the journey which he had already taken. Besides, how was he to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle? And after the quagmire, was there not the police patrol, which assuredly could not be twice avoided? And then, whither was he to go? What direction should he pursue? To follow the incline would not conduct him to his goal. If he were to reach another outlet, he would find it obstructed by a plug or a grating. Every outlet was, undoubtedly, closed in that manner. Chance had unsealed the grating through which he had entered, but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred. He had only succeeded in escaping into a prison.","Must he then perish there? What should he do? what would become of them? go back; recommence the terrible road which he had already traversed; he had not the strength. Besides, how cross that quagmire again, from which he had escaped only by a miracle? And after the quagmire, was there not that police patrol from which, certainly, one would not escape twice? And then where should he go? what direction take? to follow the descent was not to reach the goal. Should he come to another outlet, he would find it obstructed by a door or a grating. All the outlets were undoubtedly closed in this way. Chance had unsealed the grating by which they had entered, but evidently all the other mouths of the sewer were fastened. He had only succeeded in escaping into a prison."
"Il aperçut le lit, et sur le matelas ce jeune homme sanglant, blanc d’une blancheur de cire, les yeux fermés, la bouche ouverte, les lèvres blêmes, nu jusqu’à la ceinture, tailladé partout de plaies vermeilles, immobile, vivement éclairé.","He saw the bed, and on the mattress this bloody young man, white with the whiteness of wax, his eyes closed, his mouth open, his lips pale, naked to the waist, slashed everywhere with vermilion wounds, motionless, enlightened.","He saw the bed, and on the mattress that young man: bleeding, white with the whiteness of wax, eyes closed, mouth open, lips pale, naked to the waist, slashed all over with crimson wounds, motionless, starkly lit.","He saw the bed, and on the mattress that young man, bleeding, white with a waxen whiteness, with closed eyes and gaping mouth, and pallid lips, stripped to the waist, slashed all over with crimson wounds, motionless and brilliantly lighted up.","He perceived the bed, and on the mattress that bleeding young man, white with a waxy whiteness, his eyes closed, his mouth open, his lips pallid, naked to the waist, gashed everywhere with red wounds, motionless, brightly lighted."

"C’est encore une loi de ces fraîches années de souffrance et de souci de ces vives luttes du premier amour contre les premiers obstacles, la jeune fille ne se laisse prendre à aucun piège, le jeune homme tombe dans tous. Jean Valjean avait commencé contre Marius une sourde guerre que Marius, avec la bêtise sublime de sa passion et de son âge, ne devina point. Jean Valjean lui tendit une foule d’embûches ; il changea d’heures, il changea de banc, il oublia son mouchoir, il vint seul au Luxembourg ; Marius donna tête baissée dans tous les panneaux ; et à tous ces points d’interrogation plantés sur sa route par Jean Valjean, il répondit ingénument oui.

Jean Valjean targeted him with a multitude of subterfuges. He changed his schedule, he moved to another bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came alone to the Luxembourg Gardens. Marius blundered headlong into every snare. And to all those question marks posted in his path by Jean Valjean he ingenuously answered yes. Yet Cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and imperturbable calm, so much so that Jean Valjean came to this conclusion: ‘That young whippersnapper is madly in love with Cosette but Cosette is not even aware of his existence.’","It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble, of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles, that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever, and that the young man falls into every one.

Jean Valjean laid a host of ambushes for him; he changed his hour, he changed his bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came alone to the Luxembourg; Marius dashed headlong into all these snares; and to all the interrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway, he ingenuously answered “yes.” But Cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity, so that Jean Valjean arrived at the following conclusion: “That ninny is madly in love with Cosette, but Cosette does not even know that he exists.”","There is another law of these young years of suffering and care, of these sharp struggles of the first love against the first obstacles, the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any toil, the young man falls into all.

"C’était précisément l’instant où Marius descendait gravement vers l’agonie et disait : ― Si je pouvais seulement la revoir avant de mourir ! — Si son souhait eût été réalisé, s’il eût vu en ce moment-là Cosette regardant un lancier, il n’eût pas pu prononcer une parole et il eût expiré de douleur.","It was precisely the moment when Marius descended gravely into agony and said: ―If I could only see her again before I die!

"Dieu ne peut rien ajouter au bonheur de ceux qui s’aiment que de leur donner la durée sans fin.

"Il est certain que, dans la matinée du 6 juin, l’insurrection eut, pendant une heure ou deux, une certaine recrudescence. L’obstination du tocsin de Saint-Merry ranima quelques velléités. Rue du Poirier, rue des Gravilliers, des barricades s’ébauchèrent. Devant la porte Saint-Martin, un jeune homme, armé d’une carabine, attaqua seul un escadron de cavalerie. A découvert, en plein boulevard, il mit un genou en terre, épaula son arme, tira, tua le chef d’escadron, et se retourna en disant : En voilà encore un qui ne nous fera plus de mal. Il fut sabré. Rue Saint-Denis, une femme tirait sur la garde municipale de derrière une jalousie baissée. On voyait à chaque coup trembler les feuilles de la jalousie. Un enfant de quatorze ans fut arrêté rue de la Cossonnerie avec ses poches pleines de cartouches. Plusieurs postes furent attaqués. A l’entrée de la rue Bertin-Poirée, une fusillade très vive et tout à fait imprévue accueillit un régiment de cuirassiers, en tête duquel marchait le général Cavaignac de Baragne. Rue Planche-Mibray, on jeta du haut des toits sur la troupe de vieux tessons de vaisselle et des ustensiles de ménage ; mauvais signe ; et quand on rendit compte de ce fait au maréchal Soult, le vieux lieutenant de Napoléon devint rêveur, se rappelant le mot de Suchet à Saragosse : Nous sommes perdus quand les vieilles femmes nous vident leur pot de chambre sur la tête.","It is certain that, on the morning of June 6, the insurrection had, for an hour or two, a certain recrudescence. The obstinacy of the tocsin of Saint-Merry revived some inclinations. Rue du Poirier, rue des Gravilliers, barricades were sketched out. In front of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a carbine, attacked alone a squadron of cavalry. Uncovered, in the middle of the boulevard, he knelt down, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the squadron leader, and turned around saying: Here is another one who will do us no more harm. He was sabered. Rue Saint-Denis, a woman was shooting at the municipal guard from behind a lowered blind. You could see the leaves of jealousy trembling at each stroke. A child of fourteen was arrested in the rue de la Cossonnerie with his pockets full of cartridges. Several posts were attacked. At the entrance to the rue Bertin-Poirée, a very lively and completely unexpected fusillade greeted a regiment of cuirassiers, at the head of which marched General Cavaignac de Baragne. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, old shards of crockery and household utensils were thrown from the roofs onto the troop; bad sign ; and when this fact was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon's old lieutenant became thoughtful, remembering Suchet's saying at Saragossa: We are lost when old women empty their chamber-pot on our heads.","It is unquestionable that during the morning of the sixth of June there was for an hour or two some sort of renewed outbreak of insurrection. The persistent tolling of St-Merry’s revived some fanciful notions. Attempts were made to build barricades in Rue du Poirier and Rue des Gravilliers. At the St-Martin gate, a lone young man armed with a rifle attacked a squadron of cavalry. Out in the open, in the middle of the boulevard, he went down on one knee, brought his weapon up to his shoulder, fired, killed the squadron commander, then turned away, saying, ‘That’s another one who won’t do us any more harm.’ He was cut down with the sword. In Rue St-Denis, a woman fired on the Municipal Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind could be seen vibrating at every shot. A fourteen-year-old child was arrested in Rue de la Cossonnerie with his pockets full of cartridges. Several police stations were attacked. At the entrance to Rue Bertin-Poirée, a very lively and quite unexpected volley of gunfire greeted a regiment of cuirassiers, General Cavaignac de Baragne marching at their head. In Rue Planche-Mibray bits of old broken crockery and household utensils were thrown down from the rooftops on to the soldiers. A bad sign. And when this incident was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon’s old lieutenant grew thoughtful, remembering Suchet’s words at Saragossa: ‘When old women empty their chamber-pots on our heads, we’re doomed.’","It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrection broke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. The obstinacy of the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades were begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In front of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a rifle, attacked alone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he placed one knee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the commander of the squadron, and turned away, saying: “There’s another who will do us no more harm.” He was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on the National Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot. A child fourteen years of age was arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with his pockets full of cartridges. Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue Bertin-Poirée, a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal General Cavaignac de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces of pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; a bad sign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon’s old lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet’s saying at Saragossa: “We are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre on our heads.”","It is certain that on the morning of the 6th of June the insurrection had, for an hour or two, a certain recrudescence. The obstinacy of the tocsin of Saint Merry reanimated some dull hopes. In the Rue du Poirier, in the Rue des Gravilliers, barricades were planned out. In front of the Porte Saint Martin, a young man, armed with a carbine, attacked singly a squadron of cavalry. Without any shelter, in the open boulevard, he dropped on one knee, raised his weapon to his shoulder, fired, killed the chief of the squadron, and turned round saying: “There is another who will do us no more harm.” He was sabred. In the Rue Saint Denis, a woman fired upon the Municipal Guard from behind a Venetian blind. The slats of the blind were seen to tremble at each report. A boy of fourteen was arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie with his pockets full of cartridges. Several posts were attacked. At the entrance of the Rue Bertin Poiree, a very sharp and entirely unexpected fusilade greeted a regiment of cuirassiers, at the head of which marched General Cavaignac de Baragne. In the Rue Planche Mibray they threw upon the troops, from the roofs, old fragments of household vessels and utensils; a bad sign; and when this fact was reported to Marshal Soult, the old lieutenant of Napoleon grew thoughtful, remembering the saying of Suchet at Saragossa: “We are lost when the old women empty their pots upon our heads.”"

"Il était nécessaire que le lendemain tout fût terminé, que le triomphe fût ici ou là, que l’insurrection fût une révolution ou une échauffourée. Le gouvernement le comprenait comme les partis ; le moindre bourgeois le sentait. De là une pensée d’angoisse qui se mêlait à l’ombre impénétrable de ce quartier où tout allait se décider ; de là un redoublement d’anxiété autour de ce silence d’où allait sortir une catastrophe. On n’y entendait qu’un seul bruit, bruit déchirant comme un râle, menaçant comme une malédiction, le tocsin de Saint-Merry. Rien n’était glaçant comme la clameur de cette cloche éperdue et désespérée se lamentant dans les ténèbres.","It was necessary that the next day all be over, that the triumph be here or there, that the insurrection be a revolution or a skirmish.

There was only one noise to be heard, a noise harrowing like a rattle, threatening like a curse, the tocsin of Saint-Merry. Nothing was chilling like the clamor of that desperate, desperate bell lamenting in the darkness.","By the next day it must all be over, triumph must lie either here or there; the insurrection must be a revolution, or a skirmish. The government understood this, as did all other parties. Every last bourgeois was aware of it. Hence a sense of anguish pervaded the impenetrable gloom of this neighbourhood where all would be decided. Hence a growing apprehension around that silence out of which a catastrophe would emerge. Here, there was only one sound to be heard, a sound as harrowing as the death-rattle, as menacing as a curse, the bell of St-Merry’s. Nothing was more chilling than the clangour of that distraught and desperate bell tolling in the darkness.","It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day, that triumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish.

Here only one sound was audible, a sound as heart-rending as the death rattle, as menacing as a malediction, the tocsin of Saint-Merry. Nothing could be more blood-curdling than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell, wailing amid the shadows.","All must be decided on the morrow, the triumph must be on this side or on that, the insurrection must be a revolution or a blunder.

"De qui était ce couplet qui lui servait à ponctuer sa marche, et toutes les autres chansons que, dans l’occasion, il chantait volontiers ? nous l’ignorons. Qui sait ? de lui peut-être. Gavroche d’ailleurs était au courant de tout le fredonnement populaire en circulation, et il y mêlait son propre gazouillement. Farfadet et galopin, il faisait un pot-pourri des voix de la nature et des voix de Paris. Il combinait le répertoire des oiseaux avec le répertoire des ateliers. Il connaissait des rapins, tribu contiguë à la sienne. Il avait, à ce qu’il paraît, été trois mois apprenti imprimeur. Il avait fait un jour une commission pour monsieur Baour-Lormian, l’un des quarante. Gavroche était un gamin de lettres.","By whom was this couplet which he used to punctuate his walk, and all the other songs which, on occasion, he gladly sang? we ignore it. Who knows ? from him maybe. Gavroche, moreover, was acquainted with all the popular humming in circulation, and he mixed in his own twittering. Leprechaun and rascal, he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertoire of birds with the repertoire of workshops. He knew of the rapins, a tribe contiguous to his own. He had, it seems, been an apprentice printer for three months. One day he had done an errand for Monsieur Baour-Lormian, one of the forty. Gavroche was a literary boy.","This verse that he marched along to, and all the other songs he would happily sing, given the opportunity – who were they written by? We do not know. Who can tell? By him, perhaps. In any event, Gavroche knew all the popular tunes in circulation, and he added his own chirpings to them. That impish little urchin created a medley of the voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory of birds with the repertory of workshops. He knew some artists’ apprentices, a tribe close to his own. He had apparently been apprenticed for three months to a printer. One day he had run an errand for Monsieur Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a gamin of letters.","Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march, and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? We know not. Who does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was well up in all the popular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them his own chirpings. An observing urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory of the workshops. He was acquainted with thieves, a tribe contiguous to his own. He had, it appears, been for three months apprenticed to a printer. He had one day executed a commission for M. Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a gamin of letters.","Whose was this refrain which served him to time his march, and all the other songs which, on occasion, he was fond of singing? we do not know. Who knows? his own perhaps. Gavroche besides kept up with all the popular airs in circulation, and mingled with them his own warbling. A sprite and a devil, he made a medley of the voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory of the workshops. He knew some painters’ boys, a tribe contiguous to his own. He had been, as it appears, three months a printer’s apprentice. He had done an errand one day for Monsieur Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a gamin of letters."

"Qu’on se souvienne de sa situation d’âme. Nous venons de le rappeler, tout n’était plus pour lui que vision. Son appréciation était trouble.

"Ce travail, propre à toute l’Europe, fit plus de ravage en Allemagne que partout ailleurs. En Allemagne, pendant une certaine période, résumée par Schiller dans son drame fameux les Brigands, le vol et le pillage s’érigeaient en protestation contre la propriété et le travail, s’assimilaient de certaines idées élémentaires, spécieuses et fausses, justes en apparence, absurdes en réalité, s’enveloppaient de ces idées, y disparaissaient en quelque sorte, prenaient un nom abstrait et passaient à l’état de théorie, et de cette façon circulaient dans les foules laborieuses, souffrantes et honnêtes, à l’insu même des chimistes imprudents qui avaient préparé la mixture, à l’insu même des masses qui l’acceptaient. Toutes les fois qu’un fait de ce genre se produit, il est grave. La souffrance engendre la colère ; et tandis que les classes prospères s’aveuglent, ou s’endorment, ce qui est toujours fermer les yeux, la haine des classes malheureuses allume sa torche à quelque esprit chagrin ou mal fait qui rêve dans un coin, et elle se met à examiner la société.

Whenever something like this happens, it is serious. Suffering breeds anger; and while the prosperous classes blind themselves, or go to sleep, which is always to close their eyes, the hatred of the unhappy classes lights its torch to some sorrowful or ill-made spirit dreaming in a corner, and it begins to examine the society.

Whenever this kind of thing happens, it is a serious matter. Suffering breeds anger, and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep, either way closing their eyes to it, the hatred of the poorer classes lights its torch at some overlooked and embittered or ill-natured mind and sets about examining society.

Whenever a fact of this sort presents itself, the case is grave.

"Disons-le du reste en passant, de quelques mots de ce qui précède on pourrait inférer entre les deux classes d’historiens une séparation tranchée qui n’existe pas dans notre esprit. Nul n’est bon historien de la vie patente, visible, éclatante et publique des peuples s’il n’est en même temps, dans une certaine mesure, historien de leur vie profonde et cachée ; et nul n’est bon historien du dedans s’il ne sait être, toutes les fois que besoin est, historien du dehors. L’histoire des mœurs et des idées pénètre l’histoire des événements, et réciproquement. Ce sont deux ordres de faits différents qui se répondent, qui s’enchaînent toujours et s’engendrent souvent. Tous les linéaments que la providence trace à la surface d’une nation ont leurs parallèles sombres, mais distincts, dans le fond, et toutes les convulsions du fond produisent des soulèvements à la surface. La vraie histoire étant mêlée à tout, le véritable historien se mêle de tout.","Let us say it in passing, from a few words of what precedes one could infer between the two classes of historians a clear separation which does not exist in our mind. No one is a good historian of the patent, visible, dazzling and public life of peoples if he is not at the same time, to a certain extent, a historian of their deep and hidden life; and no one is a good historian from within if he does not know how to be, whenever necessary, a historian from without. The history of mores and ideas penetrates the history of events, and vice versa. These are two different orders of facts which respond to each other, which are always linked together and often engender each other. All the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their dark but distinct parallels in the background, and all the convulsions of the background produce upheavals on the surface. True history being involved in everything, the true historian is involved in everything.","And incidentally, it needs to be said, from a few words above a clear-cut distinction between the two categories of historian might be inferred that does not exist in our mind. There is no good historian of the evident, the manifest and the remarkable, of the public life of nations, who is not also to some extent the historian of their underlying and hidden life. And there is no good historian of the nation from within who does not understand, when necessary, how to be the historian of the nation from without. The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events, and vice versa. They are phenomena of two different orders, which complement each other, which are always interrelated, and often follow from each other. All the features that providence draws on the surface of a nation have their dark but distinct parallels below, and all convulsions below produce upheavals above. True history being implicated in everything, everything is the business of the true historian.","Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind. No one is a good historian of the patent, visible, striking, and public life of peoples, if he is not, at the same time, in a certain measure, the historian of their deep and hidden life; and no one is a good historian of the interior unless he understands how, at need, to be the historian of the exterior also. The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events, and this is true reciprocally. They constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other, which are always interlaced, and which often bring forth results. All the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels, sombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface. True history being a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.","We must say, however, by the way, from some words of what precedes, a decided separation between the two classes of historians might be inferred, which does not exist in our mind. No man is a good historian of the open, visible, signal, and public life of the nations, if he is not, at the same time, to a certain extent, the historian of their deeper and hidden life; and no man is a good historian of the interior if he know not to be, whenever there is need, the historian of the exterior. The history of morals and ideas interpenetrate the history of events, and vice versa. They are two orders of different facts which answer to each other, which are always linked with and often produce each other. All the lineaments which Providence traces upon the surface of a nation have their dark but distinct parallels, in the bottom, and all the convulsions of the bottom produce upheavals at the surface. True history dealing with all, the true historian deals with all."

"Faire surnager et soutenir au-dessus de l’oubli, au-dessus du gouffre, ne fût-ce qu’un fragment d’une langue quelconque que l’homme a parlée et qui se perdrait, c’est-à-dire un des éléments, bons ou mauvais, dont la civilisation se compose ou se complique, c’est étendre les données de l’observation sociale, c’est servir la civilisation même. Ce service, Plaute l’a rendu, le voulant ou ne le voulant pas, en faisant parler le phénicien à deux soldats carthaginois ; ce service, Molière l’a rendu, en faisant parler le levantin et toutes sortes de patois à tant de ses personnages. Ici les objections se raniment. Le phénicien, à merveille ! le levantin, à la bonne heure ! même le patois, passe ! ce sont des langues qui ont appartenu à des nations ou à des provinces ; mais l’argot ? à quoi bon conserver l’argot ? à quoi bon « faire surnager » l’argot ?","To make float and sustain above oblivion, above the abyss, were it only a fragment of any language that man has spoken and which would be lost, that is to say, a of the elements, good or bad, of which civilization is composed or complicated, it is to extend the data of social observation, it is to serve civilization itself. This service, Plautus rendered it, willing it or not, by making the Phoenician speak to two Carthaginian soldiers; Molière rendered this service by making so many of his characters speak Levantine and all sorts of patois. Here the objections revive. The Phoenician, marvelously! the Levantine, good luck! even the patois, pass! they are languages that belonged to nations or provinces; but slang? why keep slang? what good is slang “floating”?","To preserve and save from oblivion, from the abyss, if only a fragment of any language that man has spoken and that would otherwise be lost – that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, contributing to the composition and the complexity of civilization – is to broaden the terms of social observation, to serve civilization itself. As Plautus served it, intentionally or not, by making two Carthaginian soldiers speak Phoenician. As Molière served it, by making so many of his characters speak the Levantine language and all sorts of dialects. At this point objections are raised yet again. Phoenician, excellent! Levantine, hurrah! Even dialect, fair enough! These are languages that have been associated with nations or provinces. But slang! What is the good of preserving slang? What is the good of keeping slang alive?","To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would, otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extend the records of social observation; is to serve civilization itself. This service Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by making two Carthaginian soldiers talk Phœnician; that service Molière rendered, by making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects. Here objections spring up afresh. Phœnician, very good! Levantine, quite right! Even dialect, let that pass! They are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang!

What is the good of assisting slang “to survive”?","To buoy up and to sustain above oblivion, above the abyss, were it only a fragment of any language whatever which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost, that is to say one of the elements, good or evil, of which civilisation is composed or with which it is complicated, is to extend the data of social observation; it is to serve civilisation itself. This service, Plautus rendered, intentionally or unintentionally, by making two Carthaginian soldiers speak Phœnician; this service Molière rendered, by making so many of his personages speak Levantine and all manner of patois. Here objections are revived; the Phœnician, perfectly right! the Levantine, well and good! even patois, so be it! these are languages which have belonged to nations or provinces; but argot? what is the use of preserving argot? what is the use of “buoying up” argot?"

"Ce qui avait appelé leur attention, c’est que ce bonhomme marchait en zigzag comme s’il était ivre.

"― Citoyens, vous représentez-vous l’avenir ? Les rues des villes inondées de lumières, des branches vertes sur les seuils, les nations sœurs, les hommes justes, les vieillards bénissant les enfants, le passé aimant le présent, les penseurs en pleine liberté, les croyants en pleine égalité, pour religion le ciel. Dieu prêtre direct, la conscience humaine devenue l’autel, plus de haines, la fraternité de l’atelier et de l’école, pour pénalité et pour récompense la notoriété, à tous le travail, pour tous le droit, sur tous la paix, plus de sang versé, plus de guerres, les mères heureuses ! Dompter la matière, c’est le premier pas ; réaliser l’idéal, c’est le second. Réfléchissez à ce qu’a déjà fait le progrès. Jadis les premières races humaines voyaient avec terreur passer devant leurs yeux l’hydre qui soufflait sur les eaux, le dragon qui vomissait du feu, le griffon qui était le monstre de l’air et qui volait avec les ailes d’un aigle et les griffes d’un tigre ; bêtes effrayantes qui étaient au-dessus de l’homme. L’homme cependant a tendu ses pièges, les pièges sacrés de l’intelligence, et il a fini par y prendre les monstres. Nous avons dompté l’hydre, et elle s’appelle le steamer ; nous avons dompté le dragon, et il s’appelle la locomotive ; nous sommes sur le point de dompter le griffon, nous le tenons déjà, et il s’appelle le ballon. Le jour où cette œuvre prométhéenne sera terminée et où l’homme aura définitivement attelé à sa volonté la triple Chimère antique, l’hydre, le dragon et le griffon, il sera maître de l’eau, du feu et de l’air, et il sera pour le reste de la création animée ce que les anciens dieux étaient jadis pour lui. Courage, et en avant ! Citoyens, où allons-nous ? A la science faite gouvernement, à la force des choses devenue seule force publique, à la loi naturelle ayant sa sanction et sa pénalité en elle-même et se promulguant par l’évidence, à un lever de vérité correspondant au lever du jour. Nous allons à l’union des peuples ; nous allons à l’unité de l’homme. Plus de fictions ; plus de parasites. Le réel gouverné par le vrai, voilà le but. La civilisation tiendra ses assises au sommet de l’Europe, et plus tard au centre des continents, dans un grand parlement de l’intelligence. Quelque chose de pareil s’est vu déjà. Les amphictyons avaient deux séances par an, l’une à Delphes, lieu des dieux, l’autre aux Thermopyles, lieu des héros. L’Europe aura ses amphyctions ; le globe aura ses amphictyons. La France porte cet avenir sublime dans ses flancs. C’est là la gestation du dix-neuvième siècle, ce qu’avait ébauché la Grèce est digne d’être achevé par la France. Écoute-moi, toi Feuilly, vaillant ouvrier, homme du peuple, homme des peuples. Je te vénère. Oui, tu vois nettement les temps futurs, oui, tu as raison. Tu n’avais ni père ni mère, Feuilly ; tu as adopté pour mère l’humanité et pour père le droit. Tu vas mourir ici, c’est-à-dire triompher. Citoyens, quoi qu’il arrive aujourd’hui, par notre défaite aussi bien que par notre victoire, c’est une révolution que nous allons faire. De même que les incendies éclairent toute la ville, les révolutions éclairent tout le genre humain. Et quelle révolution ferons-nous ? Je viens de le dire, la révolution du Vrai. Au point de vue politique, il n’y a qu’un seul principe, la souveraineté de l’homme sur lui-même. Cette souveraineté de moi sur moi s’appelle Liberté. Là où deux ou plusieurs de ces souverainetés s’associent commence l’état. Mais dans cette association il n’y a nulle abdication. Chaque souveraineté concède une certaine quantité d’elle-même pour former le droit commun. Cette quantité est la même pour tous. Cette identité de concession que chacun fait à tous s’appelle Égalité. Le droit commun n’est pas autre chose que la protection de tous rayonnant sur le droit de chacun. Cette protection de tous sur chacun s’appelle Fraternité. Le point d’intersection de toutes ces souverainetés qui s’agrègent s’appelle Société. Cette intersection étant une jonction, ce point est un nœud. De là ce qu’on appelle le lien social. Quelques-uns disent contrat social ; ce qui est la même chose, le mot contrat étant étymologiquement, formé avec l’idée de lien. Entendons-nous sur l’égalité ; car, si la liberté est le sommet, l’égalité est la base. L’égalité, citoyens, ce n’est pas toute la végétation à niveau, une société de grands brins d’herbe et de petits chênes ; un voisinage de jalousies s’entre-châtrant ; c’est, civilement, toutes les aptitudes ayant la même ouverture ; politiquement, tous les votes ayant le même poids ; religieusement, toutes les consciences ayant le même droit. L’Égalité a un organe, l’instruction gratuite et obligatoire. Le droit à l’alphabet, c’est par là qu’il faut commencer. L’école primaire imposée à tous, l’école secondaire offerte à tous, c’est là la loi. De l’école identique sort la société égale. Oui, enseignement ! Lumière ! lumière ! tout vient de la lumière et tout y retourne. Citoyens, le dix-neuvième siècle est grand, mais le vingtième siècle sera heureux. Alors plus rien de semblable à la vieille histoire ; on n’aura plus à craindre, comme aujourd’hui, une conquête, une invasion, une usurpation, une rivalité de nations à main armée, une interruption de civilisation dépendant d’un mariage de rois, une naissance dans les tyrannies héréditaires, un partage de peuples par congrès, un démembrement par écroulement de dynastie, un combat de deux religions se rencontrant de front, comme deux boucs de l’ombre, sur le pont de l’infini ; on n’aura plus à craindre la famine, l’exploitation, la prostitution par détresse, la misère par chômage, et l’échafaud, et le glaive, et les batailles, et tous les brigandages du hasard dans la forêt des événements. On pourrait presque dire : il n’y aura plus d’événements. On sera heureux. Le genre humain accomplira sa loi comme le globe terrestre accomplit la sienne ; l’harmonie se rétablira entre l’âme et l’astre ; l’âme gravitera autour de la vérité comme l’astre autour de la lumière. Amis, l’heure où nous sommes et où je vous parle est une heure sombre ; mais ce sont là les achats terribles de l’avenir. Une révolution est un péage. Oh ! le genre humain sera délivré, relevé et consolé ! Nous le lui affirmons sur cette barricade. D’où poussera-t-on le cri d’amour, si ce n’est du haut du sacrifice ? O mes frères, c’est ici le lieu de jonction de ceux qui pensent et de ceux qui souffrent ; cette barricade n’est faite ni de pavés, ni de poutres, ni de ferrailles ; elle est faite de deux monceaux, un monceau d’idées et un monceau de douleurs. La misère y rencontre l’idéal. Le jour y embrasse la nuit et lui dit : Je vais mourir avec toi et tu vas renaître avec moi. De l’étreinte de toutes les désolations jaillit la foi. Les souffrances apportent ici leur agonie, et les idées leur immortalité. Cette agonie et cette immortalité vont se mêler et composer notre mort. Frères, qui meurt ici meurt dans le rayonnement de l’avenir, et nous entrons dans une tombe toute pénétrée d’aurore.","―Citizens, do you imagine the future? The streets of the cities flooded with lights, green branches on the thresholds, the sister nations, the just men, the old men blessing the children, the past loving the present, the thinkers in full freedom, the believers in full equality, for religion the sky. God direct priest, the human conscience become the altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and the school, for penalty and for reward notoriety, to all the work, for all the right, on all peace , no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers! Taming matter is the first step; realizing the ideal is the second. Think about what progress has already done. Formerly the first human races saw with terror pass before their eyes the hydra which breathed on the waters, the dragon which vomited fire, the griffin which was the monster of the air and which flew with the wings of an eagle and the claws of a tiger; fearful beasts that were above man. Man, however, has laid his traps, the sacred traps of intelligence, and he has ended up catching the monsters there. We have tamed the hydra, and it is called the steamer; we have tamed the dragon, and it is called the locomotive; we are about to tame the griffin, we already have it, and it is called the ball. The day when this Promethean work will be finished and when man will have definitively harnessed to his will the ancient triple Chimera, the hydra, the dragon and the griffin, he will be master of water, fire and air, and he will be to the rest of animated creation what the old gods once were to him. Courage, and forward! Citizens, where are we going? To science made government, to the force of things become the only public force, to natural law having its sanction and its penalty in itself and promulgating itself by evidence, to a dawning of truth corresponding to the dawning of day. We are going to the union of peoples; we are going to the unity of man. More fiction; more pests. The real governed by the true, that is the goal. Civilization will hold its foundations at the summit of Europe, and later at the center of the continents, in a great parliament of intelligence. Something like this has happened before. The amphictyons had two sessions a year, one at Delphi, place of the gods, the other at Thermopylae, place of heroes. Europe will have its amphyctions; the globe will have its amphictyons. France carries this sublime future in her flanks. This is the gestation of the nineteenth century, what Greece had sketched out is worthy of being completed by France. Listen to me, you Feuilly, valiant worker, man of the people, man of the people. I venerate you. Yes, you clearly see future times, yes, you are right. You had neither father nor mother, Feuilly; you have adopted humanity as your mother and the law as your father. You will die here, that is to say triumph. Citizens, whatever happens today, by our defeat as well as by our victory, it is a revolution that we are going to make. Just as fires light up the whole city, so revolutions light up the whole human race. And what revolution will we make? I have just said it, the revolution of the True. From the political point of view, there is only one principle, the sovereignty of man over himself. This sovereignty of me over me is called Freedom. Where two or more of these sovereignties combine, the state begins. But in this association there is no abdication. Each sovereignty concedes a certain amount of itself to form common law. This quantity is the same for everyone. This identity of concession that each makes to all is called Equality. Common law is nothing other than the protection of all radiating on the rights of each. This protection of all over each is called Fraternity. The point of intersection of all these aggregate sovereignties is called Society. This intersection being a junction, this point is a node. Hence what is called the social bond. Some say social contract; which is the same thing, the word contract being etymologically, formed with the idea of bond. Let’s agree on equality; for, if liberty is the summit, equality is the base. Equality, Citizens, is not all vegetation level, a society of tall blades of grass and little oaks; a neighborhood of interlocking jealousies; it is, civilly, all the aptitudes having the same opening; politically, all votes having the same weight; religiously, all consciences having the same right. Equality has an organ, free and compulsory education. The right to the alphabet is where you have to start. Primary school imposed on all, secondary school offered to all, that is the law. From the identical school comes the equal society. Yes, teaching! Light ! light ! everything comes from light and everything returns to it. Citizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century will be happy. So nothing more like the old story; we will no longer have to fear, as today, a conquest, an invasion, a usurpation, an armed rivalry between nations, an interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings, a birth in hereditary tyrannies, a division of peoples by congress, a dismemberment by the collapse of a dynasty, a combat of two religions meeting head-on, like two goats in the shadows, on the bridge of infinity; we will no longer have to fear famine, exploitation, prostitution through distress, misery through unemployment, and the scaffold, and the sword, and battles, and all the brigandage of chance in the forest of events. One could almost say: there will be no more events. We will be happy. The human race will fulfill its law as the terrestrial globe fulfills its own; harmony will be restored between the soul and the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth as the star around the light. Friends, the hour where we are and where I speak to you is a dark hour; but these are the terrible purchases of the future. A revolution is a toll. Oh ! the human race will be delivered, uplifted and consoled! We affirm it to him on this barricade. From where will the cry of love be uttered, if not from the height of sacrifice? O my brothers, this is the meeting place of those who think and those who suffer; this barricade is made neither of cobblestones, nor of beams, nor of iron; it is made up of two heaps, a heap of ideas and a heap of pain. Misery meets the ideal. The day embraces the night there and says to it: I will die with you and you will be reborn with me. From the embrace of all desolation springs faith. Sufferings here bring their agony, and ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality will mingle and compose our death. Brothers, who dies here dies in the radiance of the future, and we enter a tomb full of dawn.","And Enjolras cried: ‘Citizens, do you visualize the future? The streets of cities bathed in light, green branches on the doorsteps, nations become sisters, men become just, old men blessing the young, the past cherishing the present, total freedom for thinkers, full equality for believers, for religion the firmament, God the unmediated priest, human conscience the altar, no more hatred, fraternity in workshop and school, reputation for sole punishment and reward, work for all, rights for all, peace for all, no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers! The taming of matter is the first step. The creation of the ideal is the second. Reflect on what progress has already accomplished. Long ago, seeing before them the hydra that breathed on the waters, the dragon that vomited fire, the griffin that was the monster of the air, flying with the wings of an eagle and the claws of a tiger – fearsome beasts that were superior to man – the earliest human races looked on in terror. Yet man laid his traps, the sacred traps of intelligence, and with them eventually caught these monsters. ‘We have tamed the hydra, and it is called the steamer. We have tamed the dragon, and it is called the locomotive. We are on the verge of taming the griffin, it is already in our possession, and it is called the balloon. The day when this Promethean work is done and man has finally harnessed to his will the threefold chimera of antiquity – hydra, dragon and griffin – he will be master of water, fire and air, and he will be to the rest of living creation what the ancient gods once were to him. Courage, and ever onward! Citizens, what lies ahead of us? Science made the principle of government, force of circumstance become the sole police force, natural law having its own inherent sanction and penalty and promulgating itself by evidence, a dawning of truth corresponding to the dawning of day. Ahead lies the unity of peoples, ahead lies the unity of mankind. No more fictions, no more parasites. Reality governed by truth, that is the goal. Civilization will hold its conclaves at Europe’s summit, and later the centre of continents, in a great assembly of intelligence. Something of the like has already been seen. The amphictyons held two sittings a year, one at Delphi, site of the gods, the other at Thermopylae, site of heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons, the globe will have its amphictyons. France carries in its womb this sublime future. This is the gestation of the nineteenth century. What Greece began is worthy of being completed by France. ‘Listen to me, Feuilly, valiant worker, man of the people, man of the peoples. I revere you. Yes, you see the future clearly, yes, you are right. You had neither father nor mother, Feuilly. You adopted humanity as your mother and right as your father. You’re going to die here – in other words, to triumph. Citizens, whatever happens today, by our defeat just as much as by our victory, what we are going to achieve is a revolution. As fires light up a whole city, so revolutions give light to the whole human race. And what revolution shall we bring about? I’ve just told you, the revolution of Truth. From the political point of view there is only one principle: man’s sovereignty over himself. This sovereignty of the self over the self is called Liberty. In the formation of an alliance between two or three of these sovereignties is the beginning of the State. But in this alliance there is no abdication. Each sovereignty concedes a certain amount of itself to form the sovereign law to which all are subject. That amount is the same for all. This uniformity of the concession each individual makes to all is called Equality. The sovereign law to which all are subject is nothing other than the protection of all deriving from the right of each individual. This protection of all over each individual is called Fraternity. The point of intersection between all these allied sovereignties is called Society. This intersection being a juncture, the point in question is a nexus. Hence what is called “the social bond”. Some say “social contract”, which is the same thing, the word “contract” being etymologically formed from the notion of binding. Let’s be clear what we mean by equality. For, if liberty is the summit, equality is the base. Equality, citizens, doesn’t mean vegetation all of one height, a society of huge blades of grass and tiny oak trees, a collective of mutually emasculating jealousies. It is, in civil terms, all who have the same aptitude having the same opportunity; in political terms, all votes having the same weight; in religious terms, all consciences having the same right. Equality has an agency: free and compulsory education. The right to the alphabet, that’s where to start. Primary schooling imposed on all, secondary schooling offered to all, that’s the rule of law. From identical schooling will come an equal society. Yes, teaching! Light! Light! Everything comes from light, and returns to it. Citizens, the nineteenth century is a great century, but the twentieth century will be a happy one. Nothing like the history of old – not any more. There’ll be no reason then to fear, as we do today, conquest, invasion, usurpation, rivalry between armed nations, civilization interrupted by a marriage of kings, a birth within the hereditary tyrannies, a partition of peoples by congress, dismemberment brought about by the collapse of a dynasty, a conflict between two religions coming up against each other, like two goats of darkness on the bridge of infinity. There’ll be no reason to fear famine, exploitation, prostitution as a result of poverty, destitution as a result of unemployment, and the sword, and the scaffold, the battles, and all the banditry of chance in the forest of incidents. You might almost say there will be no more incidents. People will be happy. Just as the terrestrial globe fulfils its own law, so too will the human race. Harmony will be re-established between soul and star. The soul will revolve around the truth, as the star revolves around light. Friends, the present moment in which I’m speaking to you is a grim moment. But these are the terrible costs of the future. A revolution is a toll. Oh! the human race will be delivered, raised up, consoled! On this barricade, we assure it of that. From where will the cry of love come, if not from the height of sacrifice? Oh my brothers, this is the juncture between those who think and those who suffer. This barricade is made not of cobblestones, or rafters, or ironmongery. It’s made of two piles – a pile of ideas and a pile of woes. Here, misery meets the ideal. Here, day embraces night and tells it: “I’m going to die with you, and you are going to be born again with me.” Faith springs from embracing every desolation. Sufferings bring here their agony, and ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality are about to combine and constitute our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies in the radiance of the future, and we go to a grave pervaded through and through by the light of dawn.’","“Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets of cities inundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, nations sisters, men just, old men blessing children, the past loving the present, thinkers entirely at liberty, believers on terms of full equality, for religion heaven, God the direct priest, human conscience become an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and the school, for sole penalty and recompense fame, work for all, right for all, peace over all, no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers! To conquer matter is the first step; to realize the ideal is the second. Reflect on what progress has already accomplished. Formerly, the first human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes, breathing on the waters, the dragon which vomited flame, the griffin who was the monster of the air, and who flew with the wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger; fearful beasts which were above man. Man, nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by intelligence, and finally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished the hydra, and it is called the locomotive; we are on the point of vanquishing the griffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the balloon. On the day when this Promethean task shall be accomplished, and when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple Chimæra of antiquity, the hydra, the dragon and the griffin, he will be the master of water, fire, and of air, and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods formerly were to him. Courage, and onward! Citizens, whither are we going? To science made government, to the force of things become the sole public force, to the natural law, having in itself its sanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence, to a dawn of truth corresponding to a dawn of day. We are advancing to the union of peoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. No more fictions; no more parasites. The real governed by the true, that is the goal. Civilization will hold its assizes at the summit of Europe, and, later on, at the centre of continents, in a grand parliament of the intelligence. Something similar has already been seen. The amphictyons had two sittings a year, one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the other at Thermopylæ, the place of heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons; the globe will have its amphictyons. France bears this sublime future in her breast. This is the gestation of the nineteenth century. That which Greece sketched out is worthy of being finished by France. Listen to me, you, Feuilly, valiant artisan, man of the people. I revere you. Yes, you clearly behold the future, yes, you are right. You had neither father nor mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity for your mother and right for your father. You are about to die, that is to say to triumph, here. Citizens, whatever happens to-day, through our defeat as well as through our victory, it is a revolution that we are about to create. As conflagrations light up a whole city, so revolutions illuminate the whole human race. And what is the revolution that we shall cause? I have just told you, the Revolution of the True. From a political point of view, there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man over himself. This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty. Where two or three of these sovereignties are combined, the state begins. But in that association there is no abdication. Each sovereignty concedes a certain quantity of itself, for the purpose of forming the common right. This quantity is the same for all of us. This identity of concession which each makes to all, is called Equality. Common right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming on the right of each. This protection of all over each is called Fraternity. The point of intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society. This intersection being a junction, this point is a knot. Hence what is called the social bond. Some say social contract; which is the same thing, the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a bond. Let us come to an understanding about equality; for, if liberty is the summit, equality is the base. Equality, citizens, is not wholly a surface vegetation, a society of great blades of grass and tiny oaks; a proximity of jealousies which render each other null and void; legally speaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity; politically, it is all votes possessed of the same weight; religiously, it is all consciences possessed of the same right. Equality has an organ: gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The right to the alphabet, that is where the beginning must be made. The primary school imposed on all, the secondary school offered to all, that is the law. From an identical school, an identical society will spring. Yes, instruction! light! light! everything comes from light, and to it everything returns. Citizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century will be happy. Then, there will be nothing more like the history of old, we shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, an invasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, an interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings, on a birth in hereditary tyrannies, a partition of peoples by a congress, a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty, a combat of two religions meeting face to face, like two bucks in the dark, on the bridge of the infinite; we shall no longer have to fear famine, farming out, prostitution arising from distress, misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword, and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events. One might almost say: There will be no more events. We shall be happy. The human race will accomplish its law, as the terrestrial globe accomplishes its law; harmony will be re-established between the soul and the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth, as the planet around the light. Friends, the present hour in which I am addressing you, is a gloomy hour; but these are terrible purchases of the future. A revolution is a toll. Oh! the human race will be delivered, raised up, consoled! We affirm it on this barrier. Whence should proceed that cry of love, if not from the heights of sacrifice?

Brothers, he who dies here dies in the radiance of the future, and we are entering a tomb all flooded with the dawn.”","“Citizens, do you picture to yourselves the future? The streets of the cities flooded with light, green branches upon the thresholds, the nations sisters, men just, the old men blessing the children, the past loving the present, thinkers in full liberty, believers in full equality, for religion the heavens; God priest direct, human conscience become the altar, no more hatred, the fraternity of the workshop and the school, for reward and for penalty notoriety, to all, labour, for all, law, over all, peace, no more bloodshed, no more war, mothers happy! To subdue matter is the first step; to realise the ideal is the second. Reflect upon what progress has already done. Once the early human races looked with terror upon the hydra which blew upon the waters, the dragon which vomited fire, the griffin monster of the air, which flew with the wings of an eagle and the claws of a tiger; fearful animals which were above man. Man, however, has laid his snares, the sacred snares of intelligence, and has at last caught the monsters.

Courage, and forward! Citizens, whither are we tending? To science made government, to the force of things, recognised as the only public force, to the natural law having its sanction and its penalty in itself and promulgated by its self-evidence, to a dawn of truth, corresponding with the dawn of the day. We are tending towards the union of the peoples; we are tending towards the unity of man. No more fictions; no more parasites. The real governed by the true, such is the aim. Civilisation will hold its courts on the summit of Europe, and later at the centre of the continents, in a grand parliament of intelligence. Something like this has been seen already. The Amphictyons had two sessions a year, one at Delphi, place of the gods, the other at Thermopylæ, place of the heroes. Europe will have her Amphictyons; the globe will have its Amphictyons. France bears within her the sublime future. This is the gestation of the nineteenth century. That which was sketched by Greece is worth being finished by France. Listen to me, then, Feuilly, valiant working-man, man of the people, man of the peoples, I venerate thee. Yes, thou seest clearly future ages; yes, thou art right. Thou hadst neither father nor mother, Feuilly ; thou hast adopted humanity for thy mother, and the right for thy father. Thou art going to die here; that is, to triumph. Citizens, whatever may happen to-day, through our defeat as well as through our victory, we are going to effect a revolution. Just as conflagrations light up the whole city, revolutions light up the whole human race. And what revolution shall we effect? I have just said, the revolution of the True. From the political point of view, there is but one single principle: the sovereignty of man over himself. This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty.

Equality has an organ: gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The right to the alphabet, we must begin by that. The primary school obligatory upon all the higher school offered to all, such is the law. From the identical school springs equal society. Yes, instruction! Light!

Men will no longer have to fear, as now, a conquest, an invasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations with the armed hand, an interruption of civilisation depending on a marriage of kings, a birth in the hereditary tyrannies, a partition of the peoples by a Congress, a dismemberment by the downfall of a dynasty, a combat of two religions meeting head to head, like two goats of darkness, upon the bridge of the infinite; they will no longer have to fear famine, speculation, prostitution from distress, misery from lack of work, and the scaffold, and the sword, and the battle, and all the brigandages of chance in the forest of events. We might almost say: there will be no events more. Men will be happy. The human race will fulfil its law as the terrestrial globe fulfils its; harmony will be re-established between the soul and the star; the soul will gravitate about the truth like the star about the light. Friends, the hour in which we live, and in which I speak to you, is a gloomy hour, but of such is the terrible price of the future. A revolution is a toll-gate. Oh! the human race shall be delivered, uplifted, and consoled! We affirm it on this barricade. Whence shall arise the shout of love, if it be not from the summit of sacrifice? O my brothers, here is the place of junction between those who think and those who suffer; this barricade is made neither of paving-stones, nor of timbers, nor of iron; it is made of two mounds, a mound of ideas and a mound of sorrows. Misery here encounters the ideal. Here day embraces night, and says: I will die with thee and thou shalt be born again with me. From the pressure of all desolations faith gushes forth. Sufferings bring their agony here, and ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality are to mingle and compose our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies in the radiance of the future, and we are entering a grave illuminated by the dawn.”"

"― Nous avons bien parlé de vous tous les deux. Cosette vous aime tant ! Vous n’oublierez pas que vous avez votre chambre ici. Nous ne voulons plus de la rue de l’Homme-Armé. Nous n’en voulons plus du tout. Comment aviez-vous pu aller demeurer dans une rue comme ça, qui est malade, qui est grognon, qui est laide, qui a une barrière à un bout, où l’on a froid, où l’on ne peut pas entrer ? Vous viendrez vous installer ici. Et dès aujourd’hui. Ou vous aurez affaire à Cosette. Elle entend nous mener tous par le bout du nez, je vous en préviens. Vous avez vu votre chambre, elle est tout près de la nôtre, elle donne sur les jardins ; on a fait arranger ce qu’il y avait à la serrure, le lit est fait, elle est toute prête, vous n’avez qu’à arriver. Cosette a mis près de votre lit une grande vieille bergère en velours d’Utrecht, à qui elle a dit : tends-lui les bras. Tous les printemps, dans le massif d’acacias qui est en face de vos fenêtres, il vient un rossignol. Vous l’aurez dans deux mois. Vous aurez son nid à votre gauche et le nôtre à votre droite. La nuit il chantera, et le jour Cosette parlera. Votre chambre est en plein midi. Cosette vous y rangera vos livres, votre voyage du capitaine Cook, et l’autre, celui de Vancouver, toutes vos affaires. Il y a, je crois, une petite valise à laquelle vous tenez, j’ai disposé un coin d’honneur pour elle. Vous avez conquis mon grand-père, vous lui allez. Nous vivrons ensemble. Savez-vous le whist ? vous comblerez mon grand-père, si vous savez le whist. C’est vous qui mènerez promener Cosette mes jours de palais, vous lui donnerez le bras, vous savez, comme au Luxembourg, autrefois. Nous sommes absolument décidés à être très heureux. Et vous en serez, de notre bonheur, entendez-vous, père. Ah çà, vous déjeunez avec nous aujourd’hui ?","“We have spoken well of you both. Cosette loves you so much! You will not forget that you have your room here. We no longer want the rue de l'Homme-Armé. We don't want any more. How could you have gone to live in a street like that, which is sick, which is grumpy, which is ugly, which has a gate at one end, where you are cold, where you cannot enter? You will come and settle here. And from today. Or you will have to deal with Cosette. She intends to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have seen your room, it is very close to ours, it overlooks the gardens; we've had what was at the lock fixed, the bed is made, she's all ready, all you have to do is arrive. Cosette has placed near your bed a large old armchair in Utrecht velvet, to which she said: hold out your arms to her. Every spring, in the clump of acacias opposite your windows, there comes a nightingale. You will have it in two months. You will have his nest on your left and ours on your right. At night he will sing, and by day Cosette will speak. Your room is at noon. Cosette will arrange your books there, your voyage of Captain Cook, and the other, that of Vancouver, all your belongings. There is, I believe, a small suitcase which you hold dear, I have arranged a corner of honor for it. You conquered my grandfather, you suit him. We will live together. Do you know whist? you will please my grandfather if you know whist. It is you who will take Cosette for a walk during my days in the palace, you will give her your arm, you know, as in the Luxembourg of old. We are absolutely determined to be very happy.

And from today. Or you’ll have Cosette to reckon with. She intends to have us under her thumb, I warn you. You’ve seen your room, it’s right next to ours, it looks out over the gardens. The lock’s been fixed, the bed’s made, it’s all ready, you just have to move in. Cosette has put by your bed a big old wing-backed chair covered with Utrecht velvet, and said to it, “Reach your arms out to him.” In the acacia bushes outside your windows there’s a nightingale that comes every spring. It’ll be there in another two months. You’ll have its nest on your left and ours on your right. At night it will sing, and in the daytime Cosette will talk. Your room faces due south. Cosette will put your books in it for you, your Captain Cook’s Voyage and the other one, by Vancouver – all your belongings. I believe there’s a small case that you’re attached to, I’ve arranged a little place of honour for it. You’ve won over my grandfather, he likes you. We shall live together. Do you play whist? My grandfather will be overjoyed if you play whist.

You have your own chamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the garden; the trouble with the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, it is all ready, you have only to take possession of it. Near your bed Cosette has placed a huge, old, easy-chair covered with Utrecht velvet and she has said to it: ‘Stretch out your arms to him.’ A nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite your windows, every spring.

"Les sentines et les égouts jouaient un grand rôle au moyen âge, au Bas-Empire et dans le vieil orient. La peste y naissait, les despotes y mouraient.

La fosse aux vermines de Bénarès n’est pas moins vertigineuse que la fosse aux lions de Babylone. Téglath-Phalasar, au dire des livres rabbiniques, jurait par la sentine de Ninive.

"Du reste, ce qu’on appelle beaucoup trop durement, dans de certains cas, l’ingratitude des enfants, n’est pas toujours une chose aussi reprochable qu’on le croit. C’est l’ingratitude de la nature. La nature, nous l’avons dit ailleurs, « regarde devant elle ». La nature divise les êtres vivants en arrivants et en partants. Les partants sont tournés vers l’ombre, les arrivants vers la lumière. De là un écart qui, du côté des vieux, est fatal, et, du côté des jeunes, involontaire. Cet écart, d’abord insensible, s’accroît lentement comme toute séparation de branches. Les rameaux, sans se détacher du tronc, s’en éloignent. Ce n’est pas leur faute. La jeunesse va où est la joie, aux fêtes, aux vives clartés, aux amours. La vieillesse va à la fin. On ne se perd pas de vue, mais il n’y a plus d’étreinte. Les jeunes gens sentent le refroidissement de la vie ; les vieillards celui de la tombe. N’accusons pas ces pauvres enfants.","Moreover, what is called much too harshly, in certain cases, the ingratitude of children, is not always such a reproachable thing as one might think. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have said elsewhere, “looks ahead”. Nature divides living beings into arriving and departing. The starters are turned towards the shadows, the newcomers towards the light. Hence a gap which, on the side of the old, is fatal, and, on the side of the young, involuntary. This gap, initially imperceptible, increases slowly like any separation of branches. The branches, without detaching themselves from the trunk, move away from it. It's not their fault. Youth goes where there is joy, to parties, to bright lights, to loves. Old age is coming to an end. We do not lose sight of each other, but there is no longer any embrace. Young people feel the chill of life; the old men that of the tomb. Let's not blame these poor children.","Besides, what in certain cases is far too harshly called the ingratitude of children is not always something as reprehensible as people believe. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have said elsewhere, ‘looks ahead’. Nature divides the living into those arriving and those departing. Those departing are turned towards the shadow, those arriving towards the light. Hence, a divergence that for the old is inevitable, and for the young unintentional. This divergence, at first imperceptible, slowly increases, like all separations into branches. Without becoming detached from the trunk, those branches grow away from it. It is not their fault. Youth goes where there is gladness, towards rejoicings, bright lights, love. Old age is directed towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other but they are no longer bound together. Young people feel the chill of life, old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor children.","Moreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, the ingratitude of children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have elsewhere said, “looks before her.” Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing. Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towards the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, and involuntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first insensible, increases slowly, like all separations of branches. The boughs, without becoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It is no fault of theirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love. Old age goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other, but there is no longer a close connection. Young people feel the cooling off of life; old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor children.","Moreover, what is called much too harshly, in certain cases, the ingratitude of children, is not always as blameworthy a thing as is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have said elsewhere, “looks forward.” Nature divides living beings into the coming and the going. The going are turned towards the shadow, the coming towards the light. Hence a separation, which, on the part of the old, is a fatality, and, on the part of the young, involuntary. This separation, at first insensible, gradually increases, like every separation of branches. The limbs, without parting from the trunk, recede from it. It is not their fault. Youth goes where joy is, to festivals, to brilliant lights, to loves. Old age goes to its end. They do not lose sight of each other, but the ties are loosened. The affection of the young is chilled by life; that of the old by the grave. We must not blame these poor children."

"A l’entrée de la rue des Prouvaires, la foule ne marchait plus. C’était un bloc résistant, massif, solide, compacte, presque impénétrable, de gens entassés qui s’entretenaient tout bas. Il n’y avait là presque plus d’habits noirs ni de chapeaux ronds. Des sarraus, des blouses, des casquettes, des têtes hérissées et terreuses. Cette multitude ondulait confusément dans la brume nocturne. Son chuchotement avait l’accent rauque d’un frémissement. Quoique pas un ne marchât, on entendait un piétinement dans la boue. Au delà de cette épaisseur de foule, dans la rue du Roule, dans la rue des Prouvaires, et dans le prolongement de la rue Saint-Honoré, il n’y avait plus une seule vitre où brillât une chandelle. On voyait s’enfoncer dans ces rues les files solitaires et décroissantes des lanternes. Les lanternes de ce temps-là ressemblaient à de grosses étoiles rouges pendues à des cordes et jetaient sur le pavé une ombre qui avait la forme d’une grande araignée. Ces rues n’étaient pas désertes. On y distinguait des fusils en faisceaux, des bayonnettes remuées et des troupes bivouaquant. Aucun curieux ne dépassait cette limite. Là cessait la circulation. Là finissait la foule et commençait l’armée.","At the entrance to the rue des Prouvaires, the crowd was no longer marching. It was a resistant, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable block of people huddled together, talking to each other in low tones. There were hardly any black coats or round hats there. Lab coats, smocks, caps, spiky, earthy heads. This multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal mist. His whisper had the hoarse accent of a shudder. Although not one was walking, a trampling in the mud was heard. Beyond this thickness of the crowd, in the rue du Roule, in the rue des Prouvaires, and in the extension of the rue Saint-Honoré, there was not a single window in which a candle shone. One could see the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns sinking into these streets. The lanterns of that time looked like big red stars hanging from strings and cast a shadow on the pavement in the shape of a large spider. These streets were not deserted. One could distinguish guns in bundles, bayonets moved and troops bivouacking. No curious person exceeded this limit. There the traffic ceased. There the crowd ended and the army began.","At the top of Rue des Prouvaires the crowd was stationary. Huge, resistant, solid, compact, it formed an almost impenetrable mass, crammed together and talking to each other in an undertone. Here were hardly any black coats or round hats. Smocks, overalls, caps, grimy faces and unkempt hair. This multitude swayed confusedly in the nocturnal mist. Its whisperings had the hoarse accents of agitation. Although not a soul stirred, the sound of tramping in the mud could be heard. Beyond this dense crowd, in Rue du Roule, Rue des Prouvaires and the continuation of Rue St-Honoré, there was not a single window where a candle glowed. Single and ever-diminishing rows of lanterns ran down those streets. The lanterns of those days looked like big red stars hanging from ropes, and cast a shadow on the pavement in the shape of a huge spider. These streets were not deserted. Here, stacks of rifles were discernible, and the stir of bayonets, and troops bivouacking. No one drawn by curiosity went beyond this boundary. Here, traffic ceased. Here, the crowd ended and the army began.","At the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked. It formed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together, and conversing in low tones. There were hardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock frocks, blouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, a dull trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of the throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the extension of the Rue Saint-Honoré, there was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance. The lanterns of that date resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes, and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider. These streets were not deserted. There could be descried piles of guns, moving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. No curious observer passed that limit. There circulation ceased.

"Jean Valjean le déconcertait. Tous les axiomes qui avaient été les points d’appui de toute sa vie s’écroulaient devant cet homme. La générosité de Jean Valjean envers lui Javert l’accablait.

Madeleine reparaissait derrière Jean Valjean, et les deux figures se superposaient de façon à n’en plus faire qu’une, qui était vénérable.

"Marius dérangea la grille et se précipita dans le jardin. Cosette n’était pas à la place où elle l’attendait d’ordinaire. Il traversa le fourré et alla à l’enfoncement près du perron. ― Elle m’attend là, dit-il. — Cosette n’y était pas. Il leva les yeux, et vit que les volets de la maison étaient fermés. Il fit le tour du jardin, le jardin était désert.

Il frappa, il frappa encore, au risque de voir la fenêtre s’ouvrir et la face sombre du père apparaître et lui demander : Que voulez-vous ? Ceci n’était plus rien auprès de ce qu’il entrevoyait. Quand il eut frappé, il éleva la voix et appela Cosette. ― Cosette ! cria-t-il. Cosette ! répéta-t-il impérieusement. On ne répondit pas. C’était fini.

He walked around the garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to the house, and, mad with love, drunk, terrified, exasperated with pain and anxiety, like a master who returns home at a bad hour, he knocked on the shutters.

Then he came back to the house and, crazed with love, delirious, terror-stricken, in a frenzy of grief and anxiety, like a master who returns home at a late hour he banged on the shutters.

"Les journaux du temps qui ont dit que la barricade de la rue de la Chanvrerie, cette construction presque inexpugnable, comme ils l’appellent, atteignait au niveau d’un premier étage, se sont trompés. Le fait est qu’elle ne dépassait pas une hauteur moyenne de six ou sept pieds. Elle était bâtie de manière que les combattants pouvaient, à volonté, ou disparaître derrière, ou dominer le barrage et même en escalader la crête au moyen d’une quadruple rangée de pavés superposés et arrangés en gradins à l’intérieur. Au dehors le front de la barricade, composé de piles de pavés et de tonneaux reliés par des poutres et des planches qui s’enchevêtraient dans les roues de la charrette Anceau et de l’omnibus renversé, avait un aspect hérissé et inextricable. Une coupure suffisante pour qu’un homme y pût passer avait été ménagée entre le mur des maisons et l’extrémité de la barricade la plus éloignée du cabaret, de façon qu’une sortie était possible. La flèche de l’omnibus était dressée droite et maintenue avec des cordes, et un drapeau rouge, fixé à cette flèche, flottait sur la barricade.","The newspapers of the time who said that the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, that almost impregnable construction, as they call it, reached to the level of a first floor, were mistaken. The fact is that she did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet.

Outside, the front of the barricade, composed of piles of paving stones and barrels connected by beams and planks which were entangled in the wheels of the Anceau cart and the overturned omnibus, had a bristling and inextricable appearance. A gap sufficient for a man to pass through had been made between the wall of the houses and the end of the barricade farthest from the tavern, so that an exit was possible.

"Cosette avec la servante occupait le pavillon ; elle avait la grande chambre à coucher aux trumeaux peints, le boudoir aux baguettes dorées, le salon du président meublé de tapisseries et de vastes fauteuils ; elle avait le jardin. Jean Valjean avait fait mettre dans la chambre de Cosette un lit à baldaquin d’ancien damas à trois couleurs, et un vieux et beau tapis de Perse acheté rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul chez la mère Gaucher, et, pour corriger la sévérité de ces vieilleries magnifiques, il avait amalgamé à ce bric-à-brac tous les petits meubles gais et gracieux des jeunes filles, l’étagère, la bibliothèque et les livres dorés, la papeterie, le buvard, la table à ouvrage incrustée de nacre, le nécessaire de vermeil, la toilette en porcelaine du Japon. De longs rideaux de damas fond rouge à trois couleurs pareils au lit pendaient aux fenêtres du premier étage. Au rez-de-chaussée, des rideaux de tapisserie. Tout l’hiver la petite maison de Cosette était chauffée du haut en bas. Lui, il habitait l’espèce de loge de portier qui était dans la cour du fond, avec un matelas sur un lit de sangle, une table de bois blanc, deux chaises de paille, un pot à l’eau de faïence, quelques bouquins sur une planche, sa chère valise dans un coin, jamais de feu. Il dînait avec Cosette, et il y avait un pain bis pour lui sur la table. Il avait dit à Toussaint lorsqu’elle était entrée : ― C’est mademoiselle qui est la maîtresse de la maison. ― Et vous, mo-onsieur ? avait répliqué Toussaint stupéfaite. ― Moi, je suis bien mieux que le maître, je suis le père.","Cosette with the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the large bedroom with painted overmantels, the boudoir with gilded strips, the president's salon furnished with tapestries and large armchairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had put in Cosette's bedroom a four-poster bed of old three-coloured damask, and an old and beautiful Persian rug bought in the rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul from Mother Gaucher, and, to correct the severity of these magnificent old things, he had amalgamated with this bric-a-brac all the cheerful and graceful little furniture of young girls, the shelf, the bookcase and the gilded books, the stationery, the blotter, the work table inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the vermeil kit, the Japanese porcelain toilet. Long damask curtains with a red background in three colours, like the bed, hung from the windows on the first floor. On the ground floor, tapestry curtains. All winter Cosette's little house was heated from top to bottom. He lived in the sort of porter's lodge which was in the back courtyard, with a mattress on a sling bed, a white wooden table, two straw chairs, an earthenware jug, a few books on a plank, his dear suitcase in a corner, never a fire. He was dining with Cosette, and there was brown bread for him on the table. He had said to Toussaint when she entered: “Mademoiselle is the mistress of the house. ―And you, sir? Toussaint replied in amazement. ―I am much better than the master, I am the father.","Cosette and the servant occupied the villa. She had the large bedroom with the painted panels, the dressing room with the gilded mouldings, the judge’s drawing room furnished with tapestries and huge armchairs. She had the garden. Jean Valjean had installed in Cosette’s bedroom a canopied bed of antique three-coloured damask and a beautiful old Persian carpet bought from Mère Gaucher in Rue du Figuier-St-Paul, and to offset the austerity of these magnificent antiques he had included in this miscellany all the charming little furnishings that delight young girls – ornament stand, bookcase, gilt-edged books, writing-case, blotter, work table inlaid with mother-of-pearl, silver-gilt dressing-table set, Japanese porcelain water jug and bowl. Long three-coloured damask curtains with a red background, like the curtains round the bed, hung at the upper-floor windows. On the ground floor were tapestry hangings. Cosette’s little house was heated from top to bottom throughout the winter.

He dined with Cosette and for him there would be a loaf of black bread on the table.

Jean Valjean had a canopied bed of antique damask in three colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased in the Rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher’s, put into Cosette’s chamber, and, in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things, he had amalgamated with this bric-à-brac all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls, an étagère, a bookcase filled with gilt-edged books, an inkstand, a blotting-book, paper, a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl, a silver-gilt dressing-case, a toilet service in Japanese porcelain.

"― Oui, répondit Combeferre, cela augmente la puissance balistique, mais diminue la justesse de tir. Dans le tir à courte distance, la trajectoire n’a pas toute la roideur désirable, la parabole s’exagère, le chemin du projectile n’est plus assez rectiligne pour qu’il puisse frapper les objets intermédiaires, nécessité de combat pourtant, dont l’importance croît avec la proximité de l’ennemi et la précipitation du tir. Ce défaut de tension de la courbe du projectile dans les canons rayés du seizième siècle tenait à la faiblesse de la charge ; les faibles charges, pour cette espèce d’engins, sont imposées par des nécessités de balistique, telles, par exemple, que la conservation des affûts. En somme, le canon, ce despote, ne peut pas tout ce qu’il veut ; la force est une grosse faiblesse. Un boulet de canon ne fait que six cents lieues par heure ; la lumière fait soixante-dix mille lieues par seconde. Telle est la supériorité de Jésus-Christ sur Napoléon.","―Yes, replied Combeferre, it increases the ballistic power, but decreases the accuracy of the shot. In short-range shooting, the trajectory does not have all the desirable stiffness, the parabola is exaggerated, the path of the projectile is no longer straight enough for it to be able to strike intermediate objects, a necessity of combat however, whose the importance increases with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the fire. This lack of tension in the curve of the projectile in the rifled guns of the sixteenth century was due to the weakness of the charge; the low loads, for this species of gear, are imposed by ballistic needs, such as, for example, the preservation of the mountings. In short, the cannon, this despot, cannot do everything it wants; strength is a big weakness. A cannonball travels only six hundred leagues per hour; light travels seventy thousand leagues per second. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon.","‘Yes,’ replied Combeferre, ‘that increases ballistic power but diminishes accuracy. Furthermore, at short range, the trajectory lacks the desired stability, it curves too much, the projectile’s path is no longer straight enough to allow it to hit all intervening objects – an essential requirement in battle and one whose importance increases with the enemy’s proximity and the rapidity of fire. This lack of stability in the trajectory of the projectile fired from the rifled cannon of the sixteenth century was due to the weakness of the charge. Weak charges for that sort of weapon are dictated by ballistic considerations, such as preserving the gun-carriage. In short, the cannon, despot that it is, can’t do everything it wants to. Strength is a great weakness. A cannon-ball travels only fifteen hundred miles an hour. Light travels a hundred and eighty thousand miles a second. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon.’","“Yes,” replied Combeferre, “that augments the projectile force, but diminishes the accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range, the trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola is exaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is, nevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increases with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge. This defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge; small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic necessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the gun-carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that it desires; force is a great weakness. A cannon-ball only travels six hundred leagues an hour; light travels seventy thousand leagues a second. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon.”","“Yes,” answered Combeferre, “that augments the ballistic power, but diminishes the accuracy of the aim. In a short range, the trajectory has not the stiffness desirable, the parabola is exaggerated, the path of the projectile is not rectilinear enough to permit it to hit the intermediate objects, a necessity of combat, however, the importance of which increases with the proximity of the enemy and the rapidity of the firing. This want of tension in the curve of the projectile, in the rifled cannon of the sixteenth century, is due to the feebleness of the charge; feeble charges, for this kind of arm, are required by the necessities of ballistics, such as, for instance, the preservation of the carriages. Upon the whole, artillery, that despot, cannot do all it would; strength is a great weakness. A cannon ball makes only two thousand miles an hour; light makes two hundred thousand miles a second. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon.”"

"La rue était déserte. Quelques bourgeois inquiets qui rentraient rapidement chez eux l’aperçurent à peine. Chacun pour soi dans les temps de péril. L’allumeur de nuit vint comme à l’ordinaire allumer le réverbère qui était précisément placé en face de la porte du no 7, et s’en alla.

Cependant, à peu près vers ce moment-là, une brusque détonation éclata du côté des halles, une seconde la suivit, plus violente encore ; c’était probablement cette attaque de la barricade de la rue de la Chanvrerie que nous venons de voir repoussée par Marius. A cette double décharge, dont la furie semblait accrue par la stupeur de la nuit, Jean Valjean tressaillit ; il se dressa du côté d’où le bruit venait ; puis il retomba sur la borne, il croisa les bras, et sa tête revint lentement se poser sur sa poitrine.","The street was deserted.

"― Vous n’échapperez pas à deux sermons, s’écria-t-il. Vous avez eu le matin celui du curé, vous aurez le soir celui du grand-père. Écoutez-moi ; je vais vous donner un conseil : adorez-vous. Je ne fais pas un tas de giries, je vais au but, soyez heureux. Il n’y a pas dans la création d’autres sages que les tourtereaux. Les philosophes disent : Modérez vos joies. Moi je dis : Lâchez-leur la bride, à vos joies. Soyez épris comme des diables. Soyez enragés. Les philosophes radotent. Je voudrais leur faire rentrer leur philosophie dans la gargoine. Est-ce qu’il peut y avoir trop de parfums, trop de boutons de rose ouverts, trop de rossignols chantants, trop de feuilles vertes, trop d’aurore dans la vie ? est-ce qu’on peut trop s’aimer ? est-ce qu’on peut trop se plaire l’un à l’autre ? Prends garde, Estelle, tu es trop jolie ! Prends garde, Némorin, tu es trop beau ! La bonne balourdise ! Est-ce qu’on peut trop s’enchanter, trop se cajoler, trop se charmer ? est-ce qu’on peut trop être vivant ? est-ce qu’on peut trop être heureux ? Modérez vos joies. Ah ouiche ! A bas les philosophes ! La sagesse, c’est la jubilation. Jubilez, jubilons. Sommes-nous heureux parce que nous sommes bons, ou sommes-nous bons parce que nous sommes heureux ? Le Sancy s’appelle-t-il le Sancy parce qu’il a appartenu à Harlay de Sancy, ou parce qu’il pèse cent six carats ? Je n’en sais rien ; la vie est pleine de ces problèmes-là ; l’important, c’est d’avoir le Sancy, et le bonheur. Soyons heureux sans chicaner. Obéissons aveuglément au soleil. Qu’est-ce que le soleil ? C’est l’amour. Qui dit amour, dit femme. Ah ! ah ! voilà une toute-puissance, c’est la femme. Demandez à ce démagogue de Marius s’il n’est pas l’esclave de cette petite tyranne de Cosette. Et de son plein gré, le lâche ! La femme ! Il n’y a pas de Robespierre qui tienne, la femme règne. Je ne suis plus royaliste que de cette royauté-là. Qu’est-ce qu’Adam ? C’est le royaume d’Ève. Pas de 89 pour Ève. Il y avait le sceptre royal surmonté d’une fleur de lys, il y avait le sceptre impérial surmonté d’un globe, il y avait le sceptre de Charlemagne qui était en fer, il y avait le sceptre de Louis le Grand qui était en or, la révolution les a tordus entre son pouce et son index, comme des fétus de paille de deux liards ; c’est fini, c’est cassé, c’est par terre, il n’y a plus de sceptre ; mais faites-moi donc des révolutions contre ce petit mouchoir brodé qui sent le patchouli ! Je voudrais vous y voir. Essayez. Pourquoi est-ce solide ? Parce que c’est un chiffon. Ah ! vous êtes le dix-neuvième siècle ? Eh bien, après ? Nous étions le dix-huitième, nous ! Et nous étions aussi bêtes que vous. Ne vous imaginez pas que vous ayez changé grand’chose à l’univers, parce que votre trousse-galant s’appelle le choléra-morbus, et parce que votre bourrée s’appelle la cachucha. Au fond, il faudra bien toujours aimer les femmes. Je vous défie de sortir de là. Ces diablesses sont nos anges. Oui, l’amour, la femme, le baiser, c’est un cercle dont je vous défie de sortir ; et, quant à moi, je voudrais bien y rentrer. Lequel de vous a vu se lever dans l’infini, apaisant tout au-dessous d’elle, regardant les flots comme une femme, l’étoile Vénus, la grande coquette de l’abîme, la Célimène de l’océan ? L’océan, voilà un rude Alceste. Eh bien, il a beau bougonner, Vénus paraît, il faut qu’il sourie. Cette bête brute se soumet. Nous sommes tous ainsi. Colère, tempête, coups de foudre, écume jusqu’au plafond. Une femme entre en scène, une étoile se lève ; à plat ventre ! Marius se battait il y a six mois ; il se marie aujourd’hui. C’est bien fait. Oui, Marius, oui, Cosette, vous avez raison. Existez hardiment l’un pour l’autre, faites-vous des mamours, faites-nous crever de rage de n’en pouvoir faire autant, idolâtrez-vous. Prenez dans vos deux becs tous les petits brins de félicité qu’il y a sur la terre, et arrangez-vous en un nid pour la vie. Pardi, aimer, être aimé, le beau miracle quand on est jeune ! Ne vous figurez pas que vous ayez inventé cela. Moi aussi, j’ai rêvé, j’ai songé, j’ai soupiré ; moi aussi, j’ai eu une âme clair de lune. L’amour est un enfant de six mille ans. L’amour a droit à une longue barbe blanche. Mathusalem est un gamin près de Cupidon. Depuis soixante siècles, l’homme et la femme se tirent d’affaire en aimant. Le diable, qui est malin, s’est mis à haïr l’homme ; l’homme, qui est plus malin, s’est mis à aimer la femme. De cette façon, il s’est fait plus de bien que le diable ne lui a fait de mal. Cette finesse-là a été trouvée dès le paradis terrestre. Mes amis, l’invention est vieille, mais elle est toute neuve. Profitez-en. Soyez Daphnis et Chloé en attendant que vous soyiez Philémon et Baucis. Faites en sorte que, quand vous êtes l’un avec l’autre, rien ne vous manque, et que Cosette soit le soleil pour Marius, et que Marius soit l’univers pour Cosette. Cosette, que le beau temps, ce soit le sourire de votre mari ; Marius, que la pluie, ce soit les larmes de ta femme. Et qu’il ne pleuve jamais dans votre ménage. Vous avez chipé à la loterie le bon numéro, l’amour dans le sacrement ; vous avez le gros lot, gardez-le bien, mettez-le sous clef, ne le gaspillez pas, adorez-vous, et fichez-vous du reste. Croyez ce que je dis là. C’est du bon sens. Bon sens ne peut mentir. Soyez-vous l’un pour l’autre une religion. Chacun a sa façon d’adorer Dieu. Saperlotte ! la meilleure manière d’adorer Dieu, c’est d’aimer sa femme. Je t’aime ! voilà mon catéchisme. Quiconque aime est orthodoxe. Le juron de Henri IV met la sainteté entre la ripaille et l’ivresse. Ventre-saint-gris ! je ne suis pas de la religion de ce juron-là. La femme y est oubliée. Cela m’étonne de la part du juron de Henri IV. Mes amis, vive la femme ! je suis vieux, à ce qu’on dit ; c’est étonnant comme je me sens en train d’être jeune. Je voudrais aller écouter des musettes dans les bois. Ces enfants-là qui réussissent à être beaux et contents, cela me grise. Je me marierais bellement si quelqu’un voulait. Il est impossible de s’imaginer que Dieu nous ait fait pour autre chose que ceci : idolâtrer, roucouler, adoniser, être pigeon, être coq, becqueter ses amours du matin au soir, se mirer dans sa petite femme, être fier, être triomphant, faire jabot ; voilà le but de la vie. Voilà, ne vous en déplaise, ce que nous pensions, nous autres, dans notre temps dont nous étions les jeunes gens. Ah ! vertu-bamboche ! qu’il y en avait donc de charmantes femmes, à cette époque-là, et des minois, et des tendrons ! J’y exerçais mes ravages. Donc aimez-vous. Si l’on ne s’aimait pas, je ne vois pas vraiment à quoi cela servirait qu’il y eût un printemps ; et, quant à moi, je prierais le bon Dieu de serrer toutes les belles choses qu’il nous montre, et de nous les reprendre, et de remettre dans sa boîte les fleurs, les oiseaux et les jolies filles. Mes enfants, recevez la bénédiction du vieux bonhomme.","“You will not escape two sermons,” he cried. In the morning you had that of the priest, in the evening you will have that of the grandfather. Listen to me ; I will give you a piece of advice: adore yourself. I don't do a lot of giries, I go to the point, be happy. There are no sages in creation other than the lovebirds. The philosophers say: Moderate your joys. I say: Let them loose the reins, to your joys. Be in love as devils. Be enraged. Philosophers ramble. I would like them to put their philosophy back into the gargoine. Can there be too many perfumes, too many open rosebuds, too many singing nightingales, too many green leaves, too much dawn in life? can we love each other too much? can we like each other too much? Take care, Estelle, you're too pretty! Take care, Nemorin, you are too handsome! The good clumsiness! Can we be too enchanted, too cajoled, too charmed? can we be too alive? can we be too happy? Moderate your joys. Oh yeah! Down with the philosophers! Wisdom is jubilation. Jubilee, let's jubilate. Are we happy because we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy called the Sancy because it belonged to Harlay de Sancy, or because it weighs one hundred and six carats? I do not know ; life is full of these problems; the important thing is to have the Sancy, and happiness. Let's be happy without quibbling. Blindly obey the sun. What is the sun? It's love. Who says love, says woman. Ah! ha! here is an omnipotence, it is the woman. Ask that demagogue Marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant Cosette. And of his own free will, the coward! Wife ! There is no such thing as Robespierre, women reign. I am no longer a royalist except for that royalty. What is Adam? This is the kingdom of Eve. No 89 for Eve. There was the royal scepter surmounted by a fleur-de-lis, there was the imperial scepter surmounted by a globe, there was Charlemagne's scepter which was made of iron, there was Louis the Great's scepter which was made of now, the revolution has twisted them between its thumb and its forefinger, like straws of two farthings; it's over, it's broken, it's on the ground, there is no longer a scepter; but make me revolutions against this little embroidered handkerchief which smells of patchouli! I would like to see you there. Try. Why is it solid? Because it's a rag. Ah! you are the nineteenth century? Well, after? We were the eighteenth, us! And we were as stupid as you. Do not imagine that you have changed much in the universe, because your kit-gallant is called the cholera-morbus, and because your bourrée is called the cachucha. Basically, it will always be necessary to love women. I dare you to get out of here. These devils are our angels. Yes, the love, the woman, the kiss, it is a circle which I challenge you to leave; and, as for me, I would very much like to return there. Which of you has seen rising in infinity, calming everything below her, looking at the waves like a woman, the star Venus, the great coquette of the abyss, the Celimene of the ocean? The ocean is a harsh Alceste. Well, no matter how much he grumbles, Venus appears, he must smile. This brute beast submits. We are all like that. Anger, storm, thunderbolts, foam to the ceiling. A woman enters the scene, a star rises; prone ! Marius was fighting six months ago; he is getting married today. It is well done. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are right. Boldly exist for each other, make love to each other, make us die of rage at not being able to do the same, idolize each other. Take in your two beaks all the little sprigs of bliss that there are on earth, and arrange yourself in a nest for life. Of course, to love, to be loved, the beautiful miracle when you are young! Don't imagine that you made that up. I too have dreamed, I have dreamed, I have sighed; I too had a moonlight soul. Love is a six thousand year old child. Love is entitled to a long white beard. Methuselah is a kid close to Cupid. For sixty centuries, man and woman have gotten out of trouble by loving. The devil, who is cunning, begin to hate man; the man, who is smarter, has come to love the woman. In this way, he has done himself more good than the devil has done him harm. This finesse was found in the earthly paradise. My friends, the invention is old, but it is brand new. Enjoy it. Be Daphnis and Chloe while waiting for you to be Philemon and Baucis. Make sure that, when you are with each other, you miss nothing, and that Cosette is the sun for Marius, and that Marius is the universe for Cosette. Cosette, may the good weather be your husband's smile; Marius, let the rain be your wife's tears. And may it never rain in your household. You have swiped the right number from the lottery, love in the sacrament; you have the jackpot, keep it safe, lock it up, don't waste it, adore yourself, and don't care about the rest. Believe what I'm saying here. It's common sense. Common sense cannot lie. Be for each other a religion. Everyone has their own way of worshiping God. Saperlotte! the best way to worship God is to love your wife. I love you ! this is my catechism. Anyone who loves is Orthodox. The oath of Henri IV puts holiness between feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris! I am not of that swearing religion. The woman is forgotten there. It amazes me from the oath of Henry IV. My friends, long live the woman! I am old, they say; It's amazing how young I feel. I would like to go and listen to bagpipes in the woods. These children who manage to be beautiful and happy, that intoxicates me. I would marry beautifully if someone wanted to. It is impossible to imagine that God made us for anything other than this: to idolize, to coo, to adonize, to be a pigeon, to be a rooster, to peck at his loves from morning to night, to admire himself in his little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant. , to make crop; this is the purpose of life. That, if you like it, is what we thought, the rest of us, in our time when we were young people. Ah! virtue-bamboche! What charming women there were at that time, and faces, and tendrons! I wreaked havoc there. So love yourself. If we didn't love each other, I don't really see what use it would be for there to be a spring; and, as for me, I would pray the good Lord to put away all the beautiful things he shows us, and to take them back from us, and to put the flowers, the birds and the pretty girls back in their box. My children, receive the old man's blessing.","‘You can’t escape two sermons!’ he exclaimed. ‘This morning you had the priest’s, this evening you shall have your grandfather’s. Listen, I’m going to give you a piece of advice: adore each other. I’m not beating about the bush, I’m coming straight to the point: be happy. The only creatures of wisdom are turtle-doves. Philosophers say: “Moderate your joys.” I say: “Give free rein to your joys. Be fiendishly smitten. Be frantically in love.” The philosophers talk nonsense. I’d like to ram their philosophy down their throats. Can there be too many perfumes, too many rosebuds coming into bloom, too many nightingales singing, too many green leaves, can there be in life too much dawn light? Can lovers love each other too much? Can they be too attractive to each other? Beware, Estelle, you’re too pretty! Beware, Némorin, you’re too handsome! What an absurdity! Is it possible to be too enchanting, too beguiling, too charming towards each other? Is it possible to be too much alive? To be too happy? Moderate your joys? Nothing of the kind! Down with philosophers! Wisdom is rejoicing. Rejoice, and let us rejoice. Are we happy because we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy diamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harlay de Sancy or because it weighs a hundred and six carats? What do I know? Life is full of such problems. The important thing is to have the Sancy, and to be happy. Let us be happy without quibbling. Let us blindly obey the sun. What is the sun? It’s love. Whoever says love, says woman. Ahah! Now there’s an almighty power: womankind. Ask that demagogue Marius if he’s not the slave of that little tyrant Cosette. And of his own free will, the craven fellow! Womankind! Regardless of any Robespierre, woman reigns. I’m no royalist any more, except as regards that particular royalty. What is Adam? The realm of Eve. No ’89 for Eve. There used to be the royal sceptre surmounted with a fleur-de-lys, there used to be the imperial sceptre surmounted with a globe, there used to be Charlemagne’s iron sceptre, there used to be Louis the Great’s gold sceptre – the revolution bent them between thumb and forefinger like worthless straws. Broken, done with, destroyed. No more sceptre. But go on, have a revolution against that little patchouli-scented embroidered handkerchief! I’d like to see it. Try! Why is it resistant? Because it’s just a piece of frippery. Ah, you’re the nineteenth century? Well, what of it? We were the eighteenth century. And we were as foolish as you are. Don’t imagine, because your killer of young men is called Cholera morbus and your bourrée is called the cachucha, that you’ve changed very much in the universe. Basically, women must always be loved. I defy you to find any way out of that. These she-devils are our angels. Yes, love, women, kisses, it’s a circle I defy you to escape. And as for myself, I should be only too happy to re-enter it. Which of you has seen the star Venus rising in the infinite, calming all beneath her, looking down on the waves like a woman, the great charmer of the abyss, the Célimène of the ocean? The ocean, now there’s a churlish Alceste. Well, grumble as he may, when Venus appears he can’t help but smile. That brute beast is tamed. We’re all like that. Anger, fury, thunderbolts, foam up to the ceiling. A woman comes on the scene, a star rises, and we’re grovelling! Marius was fighting six months ago. Today he’s getting married. Well done! Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you’re right. Be bold in existing for each other, caress each other, make us burst with rage that we can’t do likewise, idolize each other. Gather in your two beaks all the little wisps of happiness that there are on earth, and build yourselves a nest for life out of them. By God, to love, to be loved, the splendid miracle of being young! Don’t think you invented it. I’ve dreamed, I’ve imagined, I’ve sighed. I, too, have had a moonlight soul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love is entitled to a long white beard. Methuselah is a youngster compared with Cupid. It is by being in love that, for sixty centuries, men and women have got by. The devil, who is cunning, started to hate man. Man, who is even more cunning, started to love woman. That’s how he’s done himself more good than the devil has done him harm. This clever tactic dates all the way back to the Garden of Eden. It’s an old trick, my friends, yet as new a find as ever. Take advantage of it. Be Daphnis and Chloe until you become Philemon and Baucis. See to it that when you are together you lack for nothing, and that Cosette is for Marius the sun, and Marius is for Cosette the universe. May fair weather, for you, Cosette, be your husband’s smile. May rain, for you, Marius, be your wife’s tears. And may it never rain in your household. You’ve landed the winning number in the lottery: love in matrimony. You’ve won the big prize, look after it well, keep it under lock and key , don’t squander it, adore each other, and never mind the rest. Believe what I’m telling you. It’s good sense. Good sense cannot lie. Be a religion to each other. ‘Every man has his own way of adoring God. Heavens above! the best way to adore God is to love your wife. “I love you!” That’s my catechism. Whoever loves is orthodox. Henri IV’s oath places sanctity between feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris! * Mine is not the religion of that oath. Women have been left out. This amazes me in an oath coming from Henri IV. My friends, long live women! I’m old, so I’m told. It’s amazing how young I’m feeling right now. I’d like to go and listen to shepherd’s pipes playing in the woods. These children, contriving to be beautiful and happy – that makes me tipsy. I’d get married myself if anyone would have me. It’s impossible to imagine that God could have made us for anything else but this: to idolize, to preen, to be a dove, to be a peacock, to bill and coo from morning till night, to admire ourselves in our own little woman, to be proud, triumphant, to strut – that’s the aim of life. That, if you please, is what we thought in our day, when we were young. Ah, heavens alive! there were such lovely women then, such pretty little faces, such budding beauties! I made my conquests among them. So love each other. Without love between each other, I really don’t see what point there would be in having spring, and I personally would ask the good Lord to pack up all the beautiful things he shows us and take them away, and put the flowers, the birds and the pretty girls back in his box. My children, this fond old man gives you his blessing.’","“You shall not escape two sermons,” he exclaimed. “This morning you had one from the curé, this evening you shall have one from your grandfather. Listen to me; I will give you a bit of advice: Adore each other. I do not make a pack of gyrations, I go straight to the mark, be happy. In all creation, only the turtledoves are wise. Philosophers say: ‘Moderate your joys.’ I say: ‘Give rein to your joys.’ Be as much smitten with each other as fiends. Be in a rage about it. The philosophers talk stuff and nonsense. I should like to stuff their philosophy down their gullets again. Can there be too many perfumes, too many open rose-buds, too many nightingales singing, too many green leaves, too much aurora in life? can people love each other too much? can people please each other too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art too pretty! Have a care, Nemorin, thou art too handsome! Fine stupidity, in sooth! Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much? Can one be too much alive, too happy? Moderate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with the philosophers! Wisdom consists in jubilation. Make merry, let us make merry. Are we happy because we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy diamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harley de Sancy, or because it weighs six hundred carats? I know nothing about it, life is full of such problems; the important point is to possess the Sancy and happiness. Let us be happy without quibbling and quirking. Let us obey the sun blindly. What is the sun? It is love. He who says love, says woman. Ah! ah! behold omnipotence—women. Ask that demagogue of a Marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette. And of his own free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no Robespierre who keeps his place but woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist except towards that royalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. No ’89 for Eve. There has been the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there has been the imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, there has been the sceptre of Charlemagne, which was of iron, there has been the sceptre of Louis the Great, which was of gold,—the revolution twisted them between its thumb and forefinger, ha’penny straws; it is done with, it is broken, it lies on the earth, there is no longer any sceptre, but make me a revolution against that little embroidered handkerchief, which smells of patchouli! I should like to see you do it. Try. Why is it so solid? Because it is a gewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth century? Well, what then? And we have been as foolish as you. Do not imagine that you have effected much change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is called the cholera-morbus, and because your pourrée is called the cachuca. In fact, the women must always be loved. I defy you to escape from that. These friends are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss forms a circle from which I defy you to escape; and, for my own part, I should be only too happy to re-enter it. Which of you has seen the planet Venus, the coquette of the abyss, the Célimène of the ocean, rise in the infinite, calming all here below? The ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well, grumble as he will, when Venus appears he is forced to smile. That brute beast submits. We are all made so. Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, foam to the very ceiling. A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat on your face! Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day he is married. That is well. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Exist boldly for each other, make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same, idealize each other, catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth, and arrange yourselves a nest for life. Pardi, to love, to be loved, what a fine miracle when one is young! Don’t imagine that you have invented that. I, too, have had my dream, I, too, have meditated, I, too, have sighed; I, too, have had a moonlight soul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has the right to a long white beard. Methusalem is a street arab beside Cupid. For sixty centuries men and women have got out of their scrape by loving. The devil, who is cunning, took to hating man; man, who is still more cunning, took to loving woman. In this way he does more good than the devil does him harm. This craft was discovered in the days of the terrestrial paradise. The invention is old, my friends, but it is perfectly new. Profit by it. Be Daphnis and Chloe, while waiting to become Philemon and Baucis. Manage so that, when you are with each other, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may be the sun for Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, let your fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rain be your wife’s tears. And let it never rain in your household. You have filched the winning number in the lottery; you have gained the great prize, guard it well, keep it under lock and key, do not squander it, adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest. Believe what I say to you. It is good sense. And good sense cannot lie. Be a religion to each other. Each man has his own fashion of adoring God. Saperlotte! the best way to adore God is to love one’s wife. I love thee! that’s my catechism. He who loves is orthodox. The oath of Henri IV. places sanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris! I don’t belong to the religion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it. This astonishes me on the part of Henri IV. My friends, long live women! I am old, they say; it’s astonishing how much I feel in the mood to be young. I should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods. Children who contrive to be beautiful and contented,—that intoxicates me. I would like greatly to get married, if any one would have me. It is impossible to imagine that God could have made us for anything but this: to idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves, to be dove-like, to be dainty, to bill and coo our loves from morn to night, to gaze at one’s image in one’s little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant, to plume oneself; that is the aim of life. There, let not that displease you which we used to think in our day, when we were young folks. Ah! vertu-bamboche! what charming women there were in those days, and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses! I committed my ravages among them. Then love each other. If people did not love each other, I really do not see what use there would be in having any springtime; and for my own part, I should pray the good God to shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us, and to take away from us and put back in his box, the flowers, the birds, and the pretty maidens. My children, receive an old man’s blessing.”","“You shall not escape two sermons,” exclaimed he. “This morning you had the curé’s, to-night you shall have the grandfather’s. Listen to me; I am going to give you a piece of advice: Adore one another. I don’t make a heap of flourishes. I go to the end, be happy. The only sages in creation are the turtle-doves. The philosophers say: Moderate your joys. I say: Give them the rein. Be enamoured like devils. Be rabid. The philosophers dote. I would like to cram their philosophy back into their throats. Can there be too many perfumes, too many open rosebuds, too many nightingales singing, too many green leaves, too much aurora in life? can you love each other too much? can you please each other too much? Take care, Estelle, you are too pretty! Take care, Némorin, you are too handsome! The rare absurdity! Can you enchant each other too much, pet each other too much, charm each other too much? can you be too much alive? can you be too happy? Moderate your joys. Ah, pshaw! Down with the philosophers! Wisdom is jubilation. Jubilate, jubilate. Are we happy because we are good: or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy called the Sancy because it belonged to Harlay de Sancy, or because it weighs cent-six [a hundred and six] carats? I know nothing about it; life is full of such problems; the important thing is to have the Sancy, and happiness. Be happy without quibbling. Obey the sun blindly. What is the sun? It is love. Who says love, says woman. Ah, ha! There is an omnipotence; it is woman. Ask this demagogue of a Marius if he be not the slave of this little tyrant of a Cosette, and with his full consent, the coward. Woman! There is no Robespierre who holds out, woman reigns. I am no longer a royalist except for that royalty. What is Adam? He is the realm of Eve. No ’89 for Eve. There was the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur de lys; there was the imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe; there was the sceptre of Charlemagne, which was of iron; there was the sceptre of Louis XIV., which was of gold , the revolution twisted them between his thumb and finger like half-penny wisps of straw; they are finished, they are broken, they are on the ground, there is no longer a sceptre; but get me up some revolutions now against this little embroidered handkerchief which smells of patchouly! I would like to see you at it. Try. Why is it immovable? Because it is a rag. Ah! you are the nineteenth century! Well, what then? We were the eighteenth! and we were as stupid as you. Don’t imagine that you have changed any great thing in the universe because your stoop-galant is called the cholera morbus, and because your boree is called the cachucha. At heart you must always love women. I defy you to get away from that. These devilesses are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss, that is a circle which I defy you to get out of; and, as for myself, I would like very well to get back into it. Which of you has seen rising into the infinite, calming all beneath her, gazing upon the waves like a woman, the star Venus, the great coquette of the abyss, the Celimene of the ocean? The ocean is a rude Alceste. Well, he scolds in vain; Venus appears, he is obliged to smile. That brute beast submits. We are all so. Wrath, tempest, thunderbolts, foam to the sky. A woman enters on the scene, a star rises; flat on your face! Marius was fighting six months ago; he is marrying to-day. Well done. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are right. Live boldly for one another, my-love one another, make us die with rage that we cannot do as much, idolatrise each other. Take in your two beaks all the little straws of felicity on earth, and build yourselves a nest for life. By Jove, to love, to be loved, the admirable miracle when one is young! Don’t imagine that you have invented it. I, too, I have had my dream, my vision, my sighs; I, too, have had a moonlight soul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has a right to a long white beard. Methuselah is a gamin beside Cupid. For sixty centuries, man and woman have got out of the scrape by loving. The devil, who is malicious, took to hating man; man, who is more malicious, took to loving woman. In this way he has done himself more good than the devil has done him harm. This trick was discovered at the time of the earthly paradise. My friends, the invention is old, but it is quite new. Profit by it. Be Daphnis and Chloë, while you are waiting to be Philemon and Baucis. So act that, when you are with each other, there shall be nothing wanting, and that Cosette may be the sun to Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, let your fine weather be the smile of your husband: Marius! let your rain be the tears of your wife. And may it never rain in your household. You have filched the good number in the lottery, a love-match; you have the highest prize, take good care of it, put it under lock and key, don’t squander it, worship each other, and snap your fingers at the rest. Believe what I tell you. It is good sense. Good sense cannot lie. Be a religion to each other. Every one has his own way of worshipping God. Zounds! the best way to worship God is to love your wife. I love you! that is my catechism. Whoever loves is orthodox. Henry IV. ’s oath puts sanctity between gluttony and drunkenness. Ventresaint-gris! I am not of the religion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it. That astonishes me on the part of Henry IV. ’s oath. My friends, long live woman! I am old, they say; it is astonishing how I feel myself growing young again. I would like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods. These children who are so fortunate as to be beautiful and happy, that fuddles me. I would get married myself if anybody wished. It is impossible to imagine that God has made us for anything but this: to idolise, to coo, to plume, to be pigeons, to be cocks, to bill with our loves from morning to night, to take pride in our little wives, to be vain, to be triumphant, to put on airs; that is the aim of life. That is, without offence to you, what we thought, we old fellows, in our times when we were the young folks. Ah! odswinkers! what charming women there were in those days, and pretty faces, and lasses! There’s where I made my ravages. Then love each other. If people did not love one another, I really don’t see what use there would be in having any spring; and, for my part, I should pray the good God to pack up all the pretty things which he shows us, and take them away from us, and to put the flowers, the birds, and the pretty girls, back into his box. My children, receive the benediction of the old goodman.”"

"Il se dit qu’il était probablement dans l’égout des halles ; que, s’il choisissait la gauche et suivait la pente, il arriverait avant un quart d’heure à quelque embouchure sur la Seine entre le pont au Change et le Pont-Neuf, c’est-à-dire à une apparition en plein jour sur le point le plus peuplé de Paris.

Perhaps he would come out at a grating in the middle of a crossroads. Astounding the bystanders with the spectacle of two bloodied men emerging from the ground under their feet.

"Dans quelque cercle d’idées que tournât Marius, il en revenait toujours à une certaine horreur de Jean Valjean. Horreur sacrée peut-être, car, nous venons de l’indiquer, il sentait un quid divinum dans cet homme. Mais, quoi qu’on fit, et quelque atténuation qu’on y cherchât, il fallait bien toujours retomber sur ceci : c’était un forçat ; c’est-à-dire, l’être qui, dans l’échelle sociale, n’a même pas de place, étant au-dessous du dernier échelon. Après le dernier des hommes vient le forçat. Le forçat n’est plus, pour ainsi dire, le semblable des vivants. La loi l’a destitué de toute la quantité d’humanité qu’elle peut ôter à un homme. Marius, sur les questions pénales, en était encore, quoique démocrate, au système inexorable, et il avait, sur ceux que la loi frappe, toutes les idées de la loi. Il n’avait pas encore accompli, disons-le, tous les progrès. Il n’en était pas encore à distinguer entre ce qui est écrit par l’homme et ce qui est écrit par Dieu, entre la loi et le droit. Il n’avait point examiné et pesé le droit que prend l’homme de disposer de l’irrévocable et de l’irréparable. Il n’était pas révolté du mot vindicte. Il trouvait simple que de certaines effractions de la loi écrite fussent suivies de peines éternelles, et il acceptait, comme procédé de civilisation, la damnation sociale. Il en était encore là, sauf à avancer infailliblement plus tard, sa nature étant bonne, et au fond toute faite de progrès latent.","In whatever circle of ideas Marius turned, he always returned to a certain horror of Jean Valjean. Sacred horror perhaps, for, as we have just indicated, he sensed a quid divinum in this man. But, whatever we did, and whatever attenuation we sought, we always had to come back to this: he was a convict; that is to say, the being who, in the social ladder, does not even have a place, being below the last rung. After the last of men comes the convict. The convict is no longer, so to speak, the like of the living. The law stripped him of all the humanity that it can take from a man. Marius, on penal questions, was still, although a democrat, in the inexorable system, and he had, on those whom the law strikes, all the ideas of the law. He had not yet made, let's say, all the progress. He had not yet come to distinguish between what is written by man and what is written by God, between law and right. He had not examined and weighed the right that man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not revolted by the word vindictiveness. He found it simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal penalties, and he accepted, as a process of civilization, social damnation. He was still there, except to advance infallibly later, his nature being good, and basically all made up of latent progress.","In whatever mental circles Marius kept turning, he always came back to a certain horror of Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for as we have just mentioned he sensed a quid divinum in this man. But for all that anyone could do, and whatever extenuating circumstances might be sought, there was no avoiding the fact: the man was a convicted felon, that is to say, a creature who did not even have a place on the social ladder, being beneath the lowest rung. After the very least of men comes the convicted felon. Among the living, the convict is no longer, so to speak, among his like. The law has dispossessed him of all the humanity of which it can divest a man. On penal matters Marius, although a democrat, still upheld the unforgiving system, and about those whom the law punishes he was at one with the law. Let us say, he had not yet made full progress. He had not yet reached the stage of distinguishing between what is written by man and what is written by God, between law and rightfulness. He had not examined and weighed the right that man asserts to deal in the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not outraged by the words ‘punitive justice’. He found it natural that certain infringements of the written law should entail eternal suffering, and he accepted social damnation as a civilized proceeding. He was still at this stage, although bound to advance later – his nature being good and with the basic potential to progress.","In whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned to a certain horror for Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as we have just pointed out, he felt a quid divinum in that man. But do what he would, and seek what extenuation he would, he was certainly forced to fall back upon this: the man was a convict; that is to say, a being who has not even a place in the social ladder, since he is lower than the very lowest rung. After the very last of men comes the convict. The convict is no longer, so to speak, in the semblance of the living. The law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man. Marius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, though he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subject of those whom the law strikes. He had not yet accomplished all progress, we admit. He had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by God, between law and right. He had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not shocked by the word vindicte. He found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering, and he accepted, as the process of civilization, social damnation. He still stood at this point, though safe to advance infallibly later on, since his nature was good, and, at bottom, wholly formed of latent progress.","In whatever circle of ideas Marius turned, he always came back from it to a certain horror of Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as we have just indicated, he felt a quid divinum in this man. But, whatever he did, and whatever mitigation he sought, he was always obliged to fall back upon this: he was a convict; that is, the creature who, on the social ladder, has no place, being below the lowest round. After the lowest of men, comes the convict. The convict is no longer, so to speak, the fellow of the living. The law has deprived him of all the humanity which it can take from a man. Marius, upon penal questions, although a democrat, still adhered to the inexorable system, and he had, in regard to those whom the law smites, all the ideas of the law. He had not yet, let us say, adopted all the ideas of progress. He had not yet come to distinguish between what is written by man and what is written by God, between law and right. He had not examined and weighed the right which man assumes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He had not revolted from the word vengeance. He thought it natural that certain infractions of the written law should be followed by eternal penalties, and he accepted social damnation as growing out of civilisation. He was still at that point, infallibly to advance in time, his nature being good, and in reality entirely composed of latent progress."

Rien n’est plus lugubre que de contempler ainsi à nu, à la lumière de la pensée, le fourmillement effroyable de l’argot.

On croit voir une affreuse broussaille vivante et hérissée qui tressaille, se meut, s’agite, redemande l’ombre, menace et regarde.

Nothing is more lugubrious than to contemplate thus naked, in the light of thought, the frightful swarming of slang.

We believe we see a frightful living and bristling brushwood which quivers, moves, agitates, asks for shade, threatens and looks. One word looks like a claw, another like a dead and bloody eye; such a sentence seems to move like a crab's claw.

Nothing is more dismal than to contemplate the seething horror of slang exposed like this to the light of the intellect.

Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of slang. It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool.

"Tout en songeant ainsi, accablé, mais résolu, hésitant pourtant, et, en somme, frémissant devant ce qu’il allait faire, son regard errait dans l’intérieur de la barricade. Les insurgés y causaient à demi-voix, sans remuer, et l’on y sentait ce quasi-silence qui marque la dernière phase de l’attente. Au-dessus d’eux, à une lucarne d’un troisième étage, Marius distinguait une espèce de spectateur ou de témoin qui lui semblait singulièrement attentif. C’était le portier tué par Le Cabuc. D’en bas, à la réverbération de la torche enfouie dans les pavés, on apercevait cette tête vaguement. Rien n’était plus étrange, à cette clarté sombre et incertaine, que cette face livide, immobile, étonnée, avec ses cheveux hérissés, ses yeux ouverts et fixes et sa bouche béante, penchée sur la rue dans une attitude de curiosité. On eût dit que celui qui était mort considérait ceux qui allaient mourir. Une longue traînée de sang qui avait coulé de cette tête descendait en filets rougeâtres de la lucarne jusqu’à la hauteur du premier étage où elle s’arrêtait.","While thinking thus, overwhelmed, but resolute, hesitating nevertheless, and, in short, quivering before what he was about to do, his gaze wandered around the interior of the barricade. The insurgents were talking there in a low voice, without stirring, and one felt there that quasi-silence which marks the last phase of waiting. Above them, at a skylight of a third story, Marius distinguished a sort of spectator or witness who seemed to him singularly attentive. It was the porter killed by Le Cabuc. From below, by the reverberation of the torch buried in the cobblestones, you could vaguely see this head. Nothing was more strange, in this dark and uncertain light, than this livid, motionless, astonished face, with its bristling hair, its open and staring eyes and its gaping mouth, leaning over the street in an attitude of curiosity. One would have said that he who was dead considered those who were about to die. A long trail of blood which had flowed from this head descended in reddish threads from the skylight to the height of the first story, where it stopped.","While such was his train of thought and he despondent but resolute, yet still hesitant and in short quaking at what he was about to do, his eyes roamed the inside of the barricade. Here the insurgents chatted quietly without stirring, and there was a sense of that quasi-silence that marks the last phase of waiting. Above them, at a third-floor dormer window, Marius discerned a spectator or onlooker of sorts who seemed singularly attentive. It was the porter killed by Le Cabuc. By the reflection from the torch hidden among the paving-stones, the head could be dimly made out from below. Nothing was more fearsome in that weak and wavering light than that ghastly, still, astonished face, with its tousled hair, its staring eyes and its gaping mouth, bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity. It was as if the dead man were observing those about to die. A long trail of blood seeping from the head had trickled down in reddish streaks from the dormer window to the first-floor level, where it stopped.","As he meditated thus, dejected but resolute, hesitating in every direction, and, in short, shuddering at what he was about to do, his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade. The insurgents were here conversing in a low voice, without moving, and there was perceptible that quasi-silence which marks the last stage of expectation. Overhead, at the small window in the third story Marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly attentive. This was the porter who had been killed by Le Cabuc. Below, by the lights of the torch, which was thrust between the paving-stones, this head could be vaguely distinguished. Nothing could be stranger, in that sombre and uncertain gleam, than that livid, motionless, astonished face, with its bristling hair, its eyes fixed and staring, and its yawning mouth, bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity. One would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were about to die. A long trail of blood which had flowed from that head, descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor, where it stopped.","Even while thinking thus, overwhelmed but resolute, hesitating, however, and, indeed, shuddering in view of what he was about to do, his gaze wandered into the interior of the barricade. The insurgents were chatting in undertone, without moving about; and that quasi-silence was felt which marks the last phase of delay. Above them, at a third story window, Marius distinguished a sort of spectator or witness who seemed to him singularly attentive. It was the porter killed by Le Cabuc. From below, by the reflection of the torch hidden among the paving-stones, this head was dimly perceptible.

One would have said that he who was dead was gazing at those who were about to die. A long trail of blood which had flowed from his head, descended in ruddy streaks from the window to the height of the first story, where it stopped."
"Les prédestinations ne sont pas toutes droites, elles ne se développent pas en avenue rectiligne devant le prédestiné ; elles ont des impasses, des cœcums, des tournants obscurs, des carrefours inquiétants offrant plusieurs voies.

"Néanmoins, pour l’instant, il était prudent. Il venait de l’échapper belle. Il avait été, on le sait, ramassé dans le galetas Jondrette avec les autres bandits. Utilité d’un vice : son ivrognerie l’avait sauvé. On n’avait jamais pu éclaircir s’il était là comme voleur ou comme volé. Une ordonnance de non-lieu, fondée sur son état d’ivresse bien constaté dans la soirée du guet-apens, l’avait mis en liberté. Il avait repris la clef des bois. Il était revenu à son chemin de Gagny à Lagny faire, sous la surveillance administrative, de l’empierrement pour le compte de l’état, la mine basse, fort pensif, un peu refroidi pour le vol, qui avait failli le perdre, mais ne se tournant qu’avec plus d’attendrissement vers le vin, qui venait de le sauver.","Nevertheless, for now, he was cautious. He had just had a narrow escape. He had been, as we know, picked up in the Jondrette attic with the other bandits. Utility of a vice: his drunkenness had saved him. It had never been clear whether he was there as a thief or as stolen. A dismissal order, based on his well-known state of drunkenness on the evening of the ambush, had set him free. He had taken up the key to the woods. He had returned to his way from Gagny to Lagny to do, under administrative supervision, gravelling for the account of the state, looking low, very pensive, a little cold for the theft, which had almost lost him, but only turning with more tenderness to the wine, which had just saved him.","However, he was being careful for now. He had just had a narrow escape. As we know, he had been rounded up with the other ruffians in Jondrette’s garret. A vice may have its uses: his drunkenness had saved him. It could never be clarified whether he was there as robber or as robbed. A ruling of no case to answer, based on his well established state of inebriation on the evening of the ambush, secured his release. And he was off back to the woods. He had returned to the Gagny–Lagny road to do his road-building for the state under administrative supervision, looking downcast and extremely pensive, a little put off thieving, which had almost done for him; but turning to wine, which had just saved him, only with increased fondness.","Nevertheless, for an instant, he was prudent. He had just escaped neatly. He had been, as the reader is aware, picked up in Jondrette’s garret in company with the other ruffians. Utility of a vice: his drunkenness had been his salvation. The authorities had never been able to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a man who had been robbed. An order of nolle prosequi, founded on his well authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush, had set him at liberty. He had taken to his heels. He had returned to his road from Gagny to Lagny, to make, under administrative supervision, broken stone for the good of the state, with downcast mien, in a very pensive mood, his ardor for theft somewhat cooled; but he was addicted nonetheless tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him.","Nevertheless, for the moment, he was prudent.

"La tradition des voitures de masques remonte aux plus vieux temps de la monarchie.

Ils sont vingt dans une voiture de six. Il y en a sur le siège, sur le strapontin, sur les joues des capotes, sur le timon. Ils enfourchent jusqu’aux lanternes de la voiture. Ils sont debout, couchés, assis, jarrets recroquevillés, jambes pendantes. Les femmes occupent les genoux des hommes. On voit de loin sur le fourmillement des têtes leur pyramide forcenée. Ces carrossées font des montagnes d’allégresse au milieu de la cohue. Collé, Panard et Piron en découlent, enrichis d’argot. On crache de là-haut sur le peuple le catéchisme poissard.

Il n’y avait là que des yeux secs, éteints, ou lumineux d’une mauvaise lumière. La troupe d’escorte maugréait, les enchaînés ne soufflaient pas ; de temps en temps on entendait le bruit d’un coup de bâton sur les omoplates ou sur les têtes ; quelques-uns de ces hommes bâillaient ; les haillons étaient terribles ; les pieds pendaient, les épaules oscillaient, les têtes s’entre-heurtaient, les fers tintaient, les prunelles flambaient férocement, les poings se crispaient ou s’ouvraient inertes comme des mains de morts ; derrière le convoi, une troupe d’enfants éclatait de rire.","The men huddled together on the drays allowed themselves to be bumped about in silence. They were livid from the chill of the morning. They were all in slacks and bare feet in clogs. The rest of the costume was misery's fancy. Their accoutrements were hideously disparate; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin of rags. Ragged hats, tarred caps, dreadful woolen caps, and, near the bud, the black coat ripped at the elbows; several had women's hats; others were wearing a basket; you could see hairy chests, and through the tears in the clothes you could make out tattoos, temples of love, flaming hearts, Cupids. We also saw scars and unhealthy redness. Two or three had a straw rope fastened to the crossbeams of the dray, and suspended below them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of them held in his hand and put to his mouth something which looked like a black stone and which he seemed to bite; it was bread he ate. There were only eyes that were dry, dull, or glowing with bad light. The escorting troop grumbled, the chained ones did not breathe; from time to time one heard the sound of a cudgel on the shoulder blades or on the head; some of these men were yawning; the rags were terrible; feet dangled, shoulders swayed, heads clashed, irons clinked, eyes blazed fiercely, fists clenched or opened inert like the hands of the dead; behind the convoy, a troop of children burst out laughing.","The men huddled on the carts were jolted along in apathetic silence. They were leaden-hued with the morning chill. All wore duck-cloth trousers and wooden clogs on their bare feet. The rest of their attire depended on the vagaries of destitution. Their items of clothing were horribly ill-assorted. Nothing is more dismal than motley rags. Battered felt hats, oilcloth caps, hideous woollen skullcaps and beside the fatigue shirt a black coat worn through at the elbows. Many had women’s hats, others wore punnets on their heads. Hairy chests could be seen, and through the torn garments tattoos were discernible: temples of love, flaming hearts, cupids. Skin infections and unhealthy red blotches were also to be observed. Two or three had a straw rope attached to the crossbars of the dray and suspended beneath them like a stirrup that supported their feet. One of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something that looked like a black stone, which he seemed to be biting into. It was bread that he was eating. Here were none but dry eyes, dull eyes, or eyes with an evil glint in them. The escort troop cursed , the men in chains breathed not a word. From time to time you could hear the sound of a cudgel blow landed on shoulder blades or skulls. Some of these men yawned. Their raggedness was terrible. Feet dangled, shoulders swayed, heads banged together, fetters rattled, eyes blazed fiercely, fists clenched or opened inertly like the hands of corpses. Bursts of laughter came from a gaggle of children behind the convoy.","The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen trousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements were horribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps, and, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the elbow; many wore women’s headgear, others had baskets on their heads; hairy breasts were visible, and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried; temples of Love, flaming hearts, Cupids; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or three had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and suspended under them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing; it was bread which he was eating. There were no eyes there which were not either dry, dulled, or flaming with an evil light. The escort troop cursed , the men in chains did not utter a syllable; from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or skulls; some of these men were yawning ; their rags were terrible; their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their heads clashed together, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously, their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.","The men heaped upon the drays were silent as they were jolted along. They were livid with the chill of the morning. They all had tow trousers, and their bare feet were in wooden shoes. The rest of their costume was according to the fancy of misery. Their dress was hideously variegated: nothing is more dismal than the harlequin of rags. Felt hats jammed out of shape, glazed caps, horrible cloth caps, and beside the linen monkey-jacket, the black coat out at the elbows; several had women’s hats; others had baskets on their heads, hairy breasts could be seen, and through the holes in their clothing tattooings could be discerned; temples of love, burning hearts, cupids; eruptions, and red sores could also be seen. Two or three had a rope of straw fixed to the bars of the dray, and hung beneath them like a stirrup, which sustained their feet. One of them held in his hand and carried to his mouth something which looked like a black stone, which he seemed to be gnawing; it was bread which he was eating. There were none but dry eyes among them; they were rayless, or lighted with an evil light. The troop of escort was cursing, the chained did not whisper; from time to time there was heard the sound of the blow of a club upon their shoulders or their heads; some of these men were yawning; their rags were terrible; their feet hung down, their shoulders swung, their heads struck together, their irons rattled, their eyes glared fiercely, their fists were clenched or open inertly like the hands of the dead; behind the convoy a troop of children were bursting with laughter."
"Il y avait à Paris, à cette époque, dans un vieux logis borgne, rue Beautreillis, près de l’Arsenal, un juif ingénieux qui avait pour profession de changer un gredin en honnête homme. Pas pour trop longtemps, ce qui eût pu être gênant pour le gredin. Le changement se faisait à vue, pour un jour ou deux, à raison de trente sous par jour, au moyen d’un costume ressemblant le plus possible à l’honnêteté de tout le monde. Ce loueur de costumes s’appelait le Changeur ; les filous parisiens lui avaient donné ce nom, et ne lui en connaissaient pas d’autre. Il avait un vestiaire assez complet. Les loques dont il affublait les gens étaient à peu près possibles. Il avait des spécialités et des catégories ; à chaque clou de son magasin, pendait, usée et fripée, une condition sociale ; ici l’habit de magistrat, là l’habit de curé, là l’habit de banquier, dans un coin l’habit de militaire en retraite, ailleurs l’habit d’homme de lettres, plus loin l’habit d’homme d’état. Cet être était le costumier du drame immense que la friponnerie joue à Paris. Son bouge était la coulisse d’où le vol sortait et où l’escroquerie rentrait. Un coquin déguenillé arrivait à ce vestiaire, déposait trente sous, et choisissait, selon le rôle qu’il voulait jouer ce jour-là, l’habit qui lui convenait, et, en redescendant l’escalier, le coquin était quelqu’un. Le lendemain les nippes étaient fidèlement rapportées, et le Changeur, qui confiait tout aux voleurs, n’était jamais volé. Ces vêtements avaient un inconvénient, ils « n’allaient pas », n’étant point faits pour ceux qui les portaient, ils étaient collants pour celui-ci, flottants pour celui-là, et ne s’ajustaient à personne. Tout filou qui dépassait la moyenne humaine en petitesse ou en grandeur, était mal à l’aise dans les costumes du Changeur. Il ne fallait être ni trop gras ni trop maigre. Le Changeur n’avait prévu que les hommes ordinaires. Il avait pris mesure à l’espèce dans la personne du premier gueux venu, lequel n’est ni gros, ni mince, ni grand, ni petit. De là des adaptations quelquefois difficiles dont les pratiques du Changeur se tiraient comme elles pouvaient. Tant pis pour les exceptions ! L’habit d’homme d’état, par exemple, noir du haut en bas, et par conséquent convenable, eût été trop large pour Pitt et trop étroit pour Castelcicala. Le vêtement d’homme d’état était désigné comme il suit dans le catalogue du Changeur ; nous copions : « Un habit de drap noir, un pantalon de cuir de laine noir, un gilet de soie, des bottes et du linge. » Il y avait en marge : Ancien ambassadeur, et une note que nous transcrivons également : « Dans une boîte séparée, une perruque proprement frisée, des lunettes vertes, des breloques, et deux petits tuyaux de plume d’un pouce de long enveloppés de coton. » Tout cela revenait à l’homme d’état, ancien ambassadeur. Tout ce costume était, si l’on peut parler ainsi, exténué ; les coutures blanchissaient, une vague boutonnière s’entr’ouvrait à l’un des coudes ; en outre, un bouton manquait à l’habit sur la poitrine ; mais ce n’est qu’un détail ; la main de l’homme d’état, devant toujours être dans l’habit et sur le cœur, avait pour fonction de cacher le bouton absent.","There was in Paris at that time, in an old one-eyed house in the Rue Beautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was to change a scoundrel into an honest man. Not for too long, which could have been embarrassing for the scoundrel. The change was made on sight, for a day or two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume resembling as closely as possible the honesty of everyone. This costume rental company was called the Changer; the Parisian thieves had given him that name, and knew of no other. He had a fairly complete locker room. The rags with which he decked people out were almost possible. It had specialties and categories; on each nail of his shop hung, worn and crumpled, a social condition; here the magistrate's habit, there the priest's habit, there the banker's habit, in one corner the retired soldier's habit, elsewhere the man of letters' habit, further on the man's habit of state. This being was the costume designer for the immense drama that roguery plays out in Paris. His den was the backstage from which the theft emerged and where the swindle entered. A ragged rascal arrived at this cloakroom, deposited thirty sous, and chose, according to the part he wanted to play that day, the clothes that suited him, and, coming down the stairs, the rascal was somebody. The next day the clothes were faithfully brought back, and the Changer, who entrusted everything to the thieves, was never robbed. These clothes had one drawback, they ""didn't fit"", not being made for those who wore them, they were sticky for this one, floating for that one, and did not fit anyone. Any trickster who exceeded the human average in either smallness or height was uncomfortable in Changer costumes. You shouldn't be too fat or too thin. The Changer had foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken a measure of the species in the person of the first beggar to come, who is neither fat nor thin, neither tall nor small. Hence the sometimes difficult adaptations from which the practices of the Changer managed as best they could. So much for exceptions! The statesman's coat, for example, black from top to bottom, and therefore suitable, would have been too wide for Pitt and too narrow for Castelcicala. The statesman's garment was designated as follows in the catalog of the Changer; we copy: “A coat of black cloth, black woolen leather trousers, a silk waistcoat, boots and linen. There was in the margin: Former Ambassador, and a note which we also transcribe: ""In a separate box, a neatly curly wig, green glasses, charms, and two small feather pipes an inch long wrapped in cotton. It was all up to the statesman, a former ambassador. All this costume was, if one can speak thus, exhausted; the seams were white, a vague buttonhole opened at one of the elbows; moreover, a button was missing from the coat on the chest; But it's just a detail ; the statesman's hand, always having to be in the coat and over the heart, had the function of hiding the missing button.","There was in Paris at that time, in a disreputable old building in Rue Beautreillis near the Arsenal, a canny Jewish fellow who made a trade out of changing scoundrels into honest men. Not for too long – that might have inconvenienced the scoundrels. The change was in appearance, for a day or two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume that had as far as possible a look of commonplace honesty about it. This hirer-out of costumes was called the Changer. Parisian rogues had given him this name and knew him by no other. He had quite a comprehensive wardrobe. The cast-offs in which he rigged people out were just about passable. He had specialities and categories. On every nail in his shop hung a social station, worn and crumpled. Here, a magistrate’s garb; there, that of a clergyman; there, a banker’s; in one corner the garb of a retired military man, in another that of a man of letters, and over there, the garb of a statesman. This individual was the costumier of the immense drama staged in Paris by skulduggery. His den was the wings from which theft emerged and into which swindle stepped back again. A ragged rascal would come to this dressing room, pay thirty sous and select the appropriate outfit, depending on the role he wished to play that day; and on going back downstairs that rascal was a somebody. The next day the clothes were faithfully returned, and the Changer, who entrusted everything to those thieves, was never robbed. The clothes had one drawback: they ‘weren’t quite right’. Not having been made for those who wore them, they were tight on this one, loose on that one, and a good fit for no one. Any crook who was bigger or smaller than the human average was uncomfortable in the Changer’s costumes. You had to be neither too fat nor too thin. The Changer provided only for the ordinary man. He had taken as the measure for the entire species the physique of the average rascal who is neither stout nor slight, neither tall nor short. Hence the sometimes difficult accommodations whereby the Changer’s clients had to make the best of it. Too bad for any exceptions to the norm! The statesman’s coat, for instance, black from top to bottom and therefore respectable, would have been too big for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. The ‘statesman’s outfit’ was described in the Changer’s catalogue, from which we copy, as follows: ‘A coat of black cloth, trousers of thick black wool, silk waistcoat, boots and linen’. In the margin was written ‘Former ambassador’, and a note that we also transcribe: ‘In a separate box, a tidily curled wig, green spectacles, watch-charms, and two little quill tips, an inch long, wrapped in cotton’. All this belonged to the statesman, former ambassador. This whole costume was, if the expression may be allowed, on its last legs. The stitching was turning white, a kind of buttonhole was opening up on one of the elbows. Furthermore, one of the coat’s breast buttons was missing. But that is a mere trifle. The statesman’s hand, having always to be kept inside his coat and over his heart, served to conceal the missing button.","There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue Beautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was to change villains into honest men. Not for too long, which might have proved embarrassing for the villain. The change was on sight, for a day or two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible. This costumer was called “the Changer”; the pickpockets of Paris had given him this name and knew him by no other. He had a tolerably complete wardrobe. The rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable. He had specialties and categories; on each nail of his shop hung a social status, threadbare and worn; here the suit of a magistrate, there the outfit of a Curé, beyond the outfit of a banker, in one corner the costume of a retired military man, elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters, and further on the dress of a statesman. This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in Paris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into which roguery retreated. A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room, deposited his thirty sous and selected, according to the part which he wished to play, the costume which suited him, and on descending the stairs once more, the knave was a somebody. On the following day, the clothes were faithfully returned, and the Changer, who trusted the thieves with everything, was never robbed. There was one inconvenience about these clothes, they “did not fit”; not having been made for those who wore them, they were too tight for one, too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer’s costumes. It was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean. The Changer had foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand, who is neither stout nor thin, neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the Changer’s clients extricated themselves as best they might. So much the worse for the exceptions! The suit of the statesman, for instance, black from head to foot, and consequently proper, would have been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. The costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the Changer’s catalogue; we copy: “A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, boots and linen.” On the margin there stood: ex-ambassador, and a note which we also copy: “In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green glasses, seals, and two small quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton.” All this belonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole costume was, if we may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams were white, a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast; but this was only detail; as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent button.","There was in Paris, at that period, in an old shanty, in the Rue Beautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew, whose business it was to change a rascal into an honest man. Not for too long a time, which might have been uncomfortable for the rascal. The change was made at sight, for a day or two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume, resembling, as closely as possible, that of honest people generally. This renter of costumes was called the Changer; the Parisian thieves had given him this name, and knew him by no other. He had a tolerably complete wardrobe. The rags with which he tricked out his people were almost respectable. He had specialties and categories; upon each nail in his shop, hung, worn and rumpled, a social condition; here the magistrate’s dress, there the curé’s dress, there the banker’s dress, in one corner the retired soldier’s dress, in another the literary man’s dress, further on the statesman’s dress. This man was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in Paris. His hut was the greenroom whence robbery came forth, and whither swindling returned. A ragged rogue came to this wardrobe, laid down thirty sous, and chose, according to the part which he wished to play that day, the dress which suited him, and, when he returned to the street, the rogue was somebody. The next day the clothes were faithfully brought back, and the Changer, who trusted everything to the robbers, was never robbed. These garments had one inconvenience, they “were not a fit;” not having been made for those who wore them, they were tight for this man, baggy for that, and fitted nobody. Every thief who exceeded the human average in smallness or in bigness, was ill at ease in the costumes of the Changer. He must be neither too fat nor too lean. The Changer had provided only for ordinary men. He had taken the measure of the species in the person of the first chance vagabond, who was neither thick nor thin, neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations, sometimes difficult, with which the Changer’s customers got along as well as they could. So much the worse for the exceptions! The Statesman’s dress, for instance, black from top to toe, and consequently suitable, would have been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. The Statesman’s suit was described as follows in the Changer’s catalogue; we copy: “A black cloth coat, pantaloons of black doublemilled cassimere, a silk waistcoat, boots, and linen.” There was in the margin: “Ancient ambassador,” and a note which we also transcribe; “In a separate box, a wig neatly frizzled, green spectacles, trinkets, and two little quill tubes an inch in length wrapped in cotton.” This all went with the Statesman, ancient ambassador. This entire costume was, if we may use the word, emaciated; the seams were turning white, an undefined buttonhole was appearing at one of the elbows; moreover a button was missing on the breast of the coat; but this was a slight matter; as the Stateman’s hand ought always to be within the coat and upon the heart, its function was to conceal the absent button."

"De son côté, Cosette languissait. Elle souffrait de l’absence de Marius comme elle avait joui de sa présence, singulièrement, sans savoir au juste. Quand Jean Valjean avait cessé de la conduire aux promenades habituelles, un instinct de femme lui avait confusément murmuré au fond du cœur qu’il ne fallait pas paraître tenir au Luxembourg, et que si cela lui était indifférent, son père l’y remènerait. Mais les jours, les semaines et les mois se succédèrent. Jean Valjean avait accepté tacitement le consentement tacite de Cosette. Elle le regretta. Il était trop tard. Le jour où elle retourna au Luxembourg, Marius n’y était plus. Marius avait donc disparu ; c’était fini, que faire ? le retrouverait-elle jamais ? Elle se sentit un serrement de cœur que rien ne dilatait et qui s’accroissait chaque jour ; elle ne sut plus si c’était l’hiver ou l’été, le soleil ou la pluie, si les oiseaux chantaient, si l’on était aux dahlias ou aux pâquerettes, si le Luxembourg était plus charmant que les Tuileries, si le linge que rapportait la blanchisseuse était trop empesé ou pas assez, si Toussaint avait fait bien ou mal « son marché », et elle resta accablée, absorbée, attentive à une seule pensée, l’œil vague et fixe, comme lorsqu’on regarde dans la nuit la place noire et profonde où une apparition s’est évanouie.","For her part, Cosette languished. She suffered from Marius's absence as she had enjoyed his presence, singularly, without knowing exactly. When Jean Valjean had ceased to take her on the usual walks, a woman's instinct had confusedly murmured to her in the bottom of her heart that she must not appear to be staying at the Luxembourg, and that if it were indifferent to her, her father would take her back there. But the days, weeks and months followed one another. Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted Cosette's tacit consent. She regretted it. It was too late. The day she returned to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. Marius had therefore disappeared; it was over, what to do? would she ever find him again? She felt a pang of heart that nothing dilated and which increased every day; she no longer knew if it was winter or summer, sun or rain, if the birds were singing, if it was dahlias or daisies, if the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries, if the linen brought back by the laundress was too starched or not enough, whether Toussaint had done his ""market"" well or badly, and she remained overwhelmed, absorbed, attentive to a single thought, her eyes vague and fixed, as when one gazes into at night the dark and deep place where an apparition has vanished.","And meanwhile Cosette pined. She suffered from Marius’s absence as she had rejoiced in his presence, oddly, without really understanding why. When Jean Valjean stopped taking her out for their customary walks, a woman’s instinct murmured vaguely in the depths of her heart that she must not seem to care about the Luxembourg Gardens, and that if it was a matter of indifference to her, her father would take her there again. But days, weeks, months went by. Jean Valjean tacitly accepted Cosette’s tacit consent. She regretted it. It was too late. The day she went back to the Luxembourg Gardens, Marius was not there any more. So Marius was gone. That was the end of it, what could she do? Would she ever find him again? She felt a heartache that nothing could relieve, and which became more intense every day. She no longer knew whether it was winter or summer, sunshine or rain, whether the birds were singing, whether it was the time of year for dahlias or daisies, whether the Luxembourg Gardens were more attractive than the Tuileries Gardens, whether the linen that came back from the laundress was starched too much or too little, whether Toussaint had done well or badly with her shopping; and she remained despondent, lost to the world, mindful of one thing only, her eyes vague and staring like those of someone gazing in the dark at the pitch-blackness into which an apparition has vanished.","On her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of Marius as she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly being conscious of it.

But days, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted Cosette’s tacit consent. She regretted it. It was too late. So Marius had disappeared; all was over. The day on which she returned to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What was to be done? Should she ever find him again? She felt an anguish at her heart, which nothing relieved, and which augmented every day; she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer, whether it was raining or shining, whether the birds were singing, whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies, whether the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries, whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough, whether Toussaint had done “her marketing” well or ill; and she remained dejected, absorbed, attentive to but a single thought, her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished.","For her part, Cosette was languishing.

"Dans cette seconde moitié du dix-neuvième siècle où nous sommes, le maire et son écharpe, le prêtre et sa chasuble, la loi et Dieu, ne suffisent plus, il faut les compléter par le postillon de Longjumeau ; veste bleue aux retroussis rouges et aux boutons grelots, plaque en brassard, culotte de peau verte, jurons aux chevaux normands à la queue nouée, faux galons, chapeau ciré, gros cheveux poudrés, fouet énorme et bottes fortes. La France ne pousse pas encore l’élégance jusqu’à faire, comme la nobility anglaise, pleuvoir sur la calèche de poste des mariés une grêle de pantoufles éculées et de vieilles savates, en souvenir de Churchill, depuis Marlborough, ou Malbrouck, assailli le jour de son mariage par une colère de tante qui lui porta bonheur.

France does not yet push elegance so far as, like English nobility, to rain down on the post-carriage of the newlyweds a hail of worn-out slippers and old slippers, in memory of Churchill, from Marlborough, or Malbrouck, assailed the her wedding day by an aunt's wrath which brought her happiness. Slippers and slippers are not yet part of our nuptial celebrations; but, patience, the good taste continuing to spread, we will get there.","In this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living, the mayor and his sash, the priest and his chasuble, the law and God are no longer sufficient.

France does not yet take elegance as far as the English nobility does, to the point of pelting the newly-weds’ post-coach with a hail of shabby slippers and worn-out shoes, in memory of Churchill, later Marlborough, or Malbrouck, who was assailed on his wedding-day by an aunt’s fury that was to bring him good luck.

Grâce à d’habiles achats de terrains, l’ingénieux magistrat avait pu faire faire ce travail de voirie secrète chez lui, sur sa propre terre, et par conséquent sans contrôle. Plus tard il avait revendu par petites parcelles pour jardins et cultures les lots de terre riverains du corridor, et les propriétaires de ces lots de terre croyaient des deux côtés avoir devant les yeux un mur mitoyen, et ne soupçonnaient pas même l’existence de ce long ruban de pavé serpentant entre deux murailles parmi leurs plates-bandes et leurs vergers.

Later he had resold in small plots for gardens and crops the plots of land bordering the corridor, and the owners of these plots of land believed on both sides to have before their eyes a party wall, and did not even suspect the existence of this a long ribbon of pavement winding between two walls among their flowerbeds and their orchards.

Thanks to some canny land purchases, the clever judge had been able to have this secret passage built on his own property, and consequently without any interference.

"M. Gillenormand traversa toutes les angoisses d’abord, et ensuite toutes les extases. On eut beaucoup de peine à l’empêcher de passer toutes les nuits près du blessé ; il fit apporter son grand fauteuil à côté du lit de Marius ; il exigea que sa fille prît le plus beau linge de la maison pour en faire des compresses et des bandes. Mademoiselle Gillenormand, en personne sage et aînée, trouva moyen d’épargner le beau linge, tout en laissant croire à l’aïeul qu’il était obéi. M. Gillenormand ne permit pas qu’on lui expliquât que pour faire de la charpie la batiste ne vaut pas la grosse toile, ni la toile neuve la toile usée. Il assistait à tous les pansements dont mademoiselle Gillenormand s’absentait pudiquement. Quand on coupait les chairs mortes avec des ciseaux, il disait : aïe ! aïe ! Rien n’était touchant comme de le voir tendre au blessé une tasse de tisane avec son doux tremblement sénile. Il accablait le médecin de questions. Il ne s’apercevait pas qu’il recommençait toujours les mêmes.","M. Gillenormand went through all the anguish first, and then all the ecstasies. They had great difficulty in preventing him from spending all the nights with the wounded man; he had his big arm-chair brought beside Marius's bed; he demanded that his daughter take the finest linen in the house to make compresses and bandages. Mademoiselle Gillenormand, like a wise and elder person, found a way to spare the fine laundry, while letting the grandfather believe that he was obeyed. M. Gillenormand did not allow anyone to explain to him that for making lint batiste is not equal to coarse linen, nor new linen to worn linen. He was present at all the dressings from which Mademoiselle Gillenormand modestly absented herself. When we cut the dead flesh with scissors, he said: ouch! ouch! Nothing was more touching to see him handing the injured a cup of herbal tea with his gentle senile trembling. He overwhelmed the doctor with questions. He did not notice that he was always starting the same things over again.","Monsieur Gillenormand experienced every anguish to begin with, and then every ecstasy. It was very difficult to prevent him spending every night with the patient. He had his big armchair installed at Marius’s bedside.

As a sensible person of some seniority, Mademoiselle Gillenormand contrived to spare the fine linen while letting the grandfather believe he was being obeyed.

He did not notice that he always kept asking the same ones.","M. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, and then through every form of ecstasy. It was found difficult to prevent his passing every night beside the wounded man; he had his big armchair carried to Marius’ bedside; he required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages. Mademoiselle Gillenormand, like a sage and elderly person, contrived to spare the fine linen, while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed. M.

On peut faire en France des imitations comme en Allemagne. Il faut une petite enclume de deux pouces carrés et une lampe à esprit de vin pour amollir la cire. La cire autrefois se faisait avec de la résine et du noir de fumée et coûtait quatre francs la livre. J’ai imaginé de la faire avec de la gomme laque et de la térébenthine. Elle ne coûte plus que trente sous, et elle est bien meilleure. Les boucles se font avec un verre violet qu’on colle au moyen de cette cire sur une petite membrure en fer noir.

"Depuis qu’on était arrivé à Corinthe et qu’on avait commencé à construire la barricade, on n’avait plus guère fait attention au père Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf pourtant n’avait pas quitté l’attroupement. Il était entré dans le rez-de-chaussée du cabaret et s’était assis derrière le comptoir. Là, il s’était pour ainsi dire anéanti en lui-même. Il semblait ne plus regarder et ne plus penser. Courfeyrac et d’autres l’avaient deux ou trois fois accosté, l’avertissant du péril, l’engageant à se retirer, sans qu’il parût les entendre. Quand on ne lui parlait pas, sa bouche remuait comme s’il répondait à quelqu’un, et, dès qu’on lui adressait la parole, ses lèvres devenaient immobiles et ses yeux n’avaient plus l’air vivants. Quelques heures avant que la barricade fût attaquée, il avait pris une posture qu’il n’avait plus quittée, les deux poings sur ses deux genoux et la tête penchée en avant comme s’il regardait dans un précipice. Rien n’avait pu le tirer de cette attitude ; il ne paraissait pas que son esprit fût dans la barricade. Quand chacun était allé prendre sa place de combat, il n’était plus resté dans la salle basse que Javert lié au poteau, un insurgé le sabre nu veillant sur Javert, et lui, Mabeuf. Au moment de l’attaque, à la détonation, la secousse physique l’avait atteint et comme réveillé, il s’était levé brusquement, il avait traversé la salle, et à l’instant où Enjolras répéta son appel : ― Personne ne se présente ? on vit le vieillard apparaître sur le seuil du cabaret.","Since we had arrived in Corinth and started to build the barricade, we had hardly paid any attention to Father Mabeuf.

When no one spoke to him, his mouth moved as if he were answering someone, and as soon as someone spoke to him, his lips became still and his eyes no longer seemed alive. A few hours before the barricade was attacked, he had taken a posture that he had never left, his two fists on his two knees and his head bent forward as if he were looking down a precipice. Nothing could have drawn him out of this attitude; it did not appear that his mind was in the barricade. When each had gone to take his place in combat, the only person left in the lower room was Javert tied to the post, an insurgent with his bare saber watching over Javert, and he, Mabeuf. At the moment of the attack, at the detonation, the physical shock had reached him and as if awakened, he got up suddenly, he crossed the room, and the moment Enjolras repeated his call: ―Nobody present ? the old man was seen to appear on the threshold of the cabaret.","Since they had arrived at Corinthe and begun to build the barricade, hardly any further notice had been taken of Père Mabeuf. Yet Monsieur Mabeuf had not left the gathering. He had gone into the tavern downstairs and sat behind the counter. There he had, as it were, turned in on himself in self-obliteration. He seemed to see no more, to think no more. Courfeyrac and others had spoken to him two or three times, warning him of the danger, telling him to go home, but apparently without being heard. When he was not being spoken to, his mouth moved as though he were replying to someone, and as soon as anyone addressed him his lips became still and his eyes looked lifeless. Several hours before the barricade was attacked he had assumed an attitude that he had not since abandoned, his two hands on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were looking over a precipice. Nothing had been able to draw him out of this posture. It was as if his mind were not inside the barricade. When everyone had gone to take up position, ready for action, there remained in the downstairs room only Javert tied to the pillar, one insurgent with his sword drawn keeping an eye on Javert, and Mabeuf himself. At the moment of the attack, when the blast came, he felt the physical shock and it appeared to rouse him. He rose abruptly, crossed the room and just as Enjolras repeated his call ‘Is no one to volunteer?’ the old man was seen coming out of the tavern.","Since they had arrived at Corinthe, and had begun the construction of the barricade, no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf had not quitted the mob, however; he had entered the ground floor of the wine-shop and had seated himself behind the counter. There he had, so to speak, retreated into himself. He no longer seemed to look or to think. Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times, warning him of his peril, beseeching him to withdraw, but he did not hear them. When they were not speaking to him, his mouth moved as though he were replying to some one, and as soon as he was addressed, his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive. Several hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon, with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice. Nothing had been able to move him from this attitude; it did not seem as though his mind were in the barricade. When each had gone to take up his position for the combat, there remained in the tap-room where Javert was bound to the post, only a single insurgent with a naked sword, watching over Javert, and himself, Mabeuf. At the moment of the attack, at the detonation, the physical shock had reached him and had, as it were, awakened him; he started up abruptly, crossed the room, and at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal: “Does no one volunteer?” the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the wine-shop.","SINCE THEY HAD arrived at Corinth and had commenced building the barricade, hardly any attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, however, had not left the company. He had entered the ground floor of the wine-shop and sat down behind the counter. There he had been, so to speak, annihilated in himself. He no longer seemed to look or to think. Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times, warning him of the danger, entreating him to withdraw, but he had not appeared to hear them. When nobody was speaking to him, his lips moved as if he were answering somebody, and as soon as anybody addressed a word to him, his lips became still and his eyes lost all appearance of life. Some hours before the barricade was attacked, he had taken a position which he had not left since, his hands upon his knees and his head bent forward as if he were looking into an abyss. Nothing had been able to draw him out of this attitude; it appeared as if his mind were not in the barricade. When everybody had gone to take his place for the combat, there remained in the basement room only Javert tied to the post, an insurgent with drawn sabre watching Javert, and he, Mabeuf. At the moment of the attack, at the discharge, the physical shock reached him, and, as it were, awakened him; he rose suddenly, crossed the room, and at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal: “ Nobody volunteers?” they saw the old man appear in the doorway of the wine-shop."

"L’algèbre s’applique aux nuages ; l’irradiation de l’astre profite à la rose ; aucun penseur n’oserait dire que le parfum de l’aubépine est inutile aux constellations. Qui donc peut calculer le trajet d’une molécule ? que savons-nous si des créations de mondes ne sont point déterminées par des chutes de grains de sable ? qui donc connaît les flux et les reflux réciproques de l’infiniment grand et de l’infiniment petit, le retentissement des causes dans les précipices de l’être, et les avalanches de la création ? Un ciron importe ; le petit est grand, le grand est petit ; tout est en équilibre dans la nécessité ; effrayante vision pour l’esprit. Il y a entre les êtres et les choses des relations de prodige ; dans cet inépuisable ensemble, de soleil à puceron, on ne se méprise pas ; on a besoin les uns des autres. La lumière n’emporte pas dans l’azur les parfums terrestres sans savoir ce qu’elle en fait ; la nuit fait des distributions d’essence stellaire aux fleurs endormies. Tous les oiseaux qui volent ont à la patte le fil de l’infini. La germination se complique de l’éclosion d’un météore et du coup de bec de l’hirondelle brisant l’œuf, et elle mène de front la naissance d’un ver de terre et l’avénement de Socrate. Où finit le télescope, le microscope commence. Lequel des deux a la vue la plus grande ? Choisissez. Une moisissure est une pléiade de fleurs ; une nébuleuse est une fourmilière d’étoiles. Même promiscuité, et plus inouïe encore, des choses de l’intelligence et des faits de la substance. Les éléments et les principes se mêlent, se combinent, s’épousent, se multiplient les uns par les autres, au point de faire aboutir le monde matériel et le monde moral à la même clarté. Le phénomène est en perpétuel repli sur lui-même. Dans les vastes échanges cosmiques, la vie universelle va et vient en quantités inconnues, roulant tout dans l’invisible mystère des effluves, employant tout, ne perdant pas un rêve de pas un sommeil, semant un animalcule ici, émiettant un astre là, oscillant et serpentant, faisant de la lumière une force et de la pensée un élément, disséminée et indivisible, dissolvant tout, excepté ce point géométrique, le moi ; ramenant tout à l’âme atome ; épanouissant tout en Dieu ; enchevêtrant, depuis la plus haute jusqu’à la plus basse, toutes les activités dans l’obscurité d’un mécanisme vertigineux, rattachant le vol d’un insecte au mouvement de la terre, subordonnant, qui sait ? ne fût-ce que par l’identité de la loi, l’évolution de la comète dans le firmament au tournoiement de l’infusoire dans la goutte d’eau. Machine faite d’esprit. Engrenage énorme dont le premier moteur est le moucheron et dont la dernière roue est le zodiaque.","Algebra applies to clouds; the irradiation of the star benefits the rose; no thinker would dare to say that the fragrance of hawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who can calculate the path of a molecule? what do we know if the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand? who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely large and the infinitely small, the reverberation of causes in the precipices of being, and the avalanches of creation? A ciron matters; small is big, big is small; everything is balanced in necessity; frightening vision for the mind. There are marvelous relations between beings and things; in this inexhaustible combination, from sun to aphid, we do not mistake each other; we need each other. The light does not carry earthly perfumes into the azure without knowing what it does with them; the night makes distributions of stellar essence to the sleeping flowers. All flying birds have the thread of infinity on their feet. Germination is complicated by the hatching of a meteor and the peck of the swallow breaking the egg, and it leads to the birth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two has the greater view? Choose. A mold is a cluster of flowers; a nebula is an anthill of stars. The same promiscuity, and still more unheard of, of things of intelligence and facts of substance. The elements and the principles mingle, combine, marry, multiply one by the other, to the point of bringing the material world and the moral world to the same clarity. The phenomenon is in perpetual withdrawal into itself. In the vast cosmic exchanges, universal life comes and goes in unknown quantities, rolling everything in the invisible mystery of effluvia, using everything, not losing a dream of not a sleep, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling a star there, oscillating and winding, making light a force and thought an element, disseminated and indivisible, dissolving all but that geometric point, the self; bringing everything back to the atom soul; fulfilling everything in God; entangling, from the highest to the lowest, all activities in the darkness of a vertiginous mechanism, linking the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth, subordinating, who knows? if only by the identity of the law, the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusorium in the drop of water. Machine made of mind. Huge gear whose first motor is the gnat and whose last wheel is the zodiac.","Algebra applies to the clouds, the star’s radiance benefits the rose. No thinker would dare to say the scent of hawthorn is irrelevant to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate a molecule’s destiny? How do we know the creation of worlds is not determined by falling grains of sand? Who, then, is conversant with the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely small, the repercussions of causes in the abysses of being and the avalanches of creation? A mite matters. The small is great and the great is small. Everything is bound by necessity in equilibrium. Dreadful for the mind to envisage. There are extraordinary relations between creatures and things. In that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the aphid, none scorns the other. Each has need of the other. Light carries terrestrial perfumes into the blue not without full knowledge of what it is doing. Darkness distributes stellar essence to sleeping flowers. All birds that fly have attached to one leg the thread of infinity. Germination embraces in its complexity the explosion of a meteor and the breaking of the eggshell by the peck of the swallow’s beak, and is equally responsible for the birth of an earthworm and the coming of Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two has the greater vision? You choose. A patch of mould is a constellation of flowers. A nebula is an ant’s nest of stars. Similarly promiscuous and yet more extraordinary are things of the mind and facts of matter. Elements and principles mix, come together, wed, multiply by agency of each other, until the material and the moral worlds achieve the same clarity. The existential phenomenon is in perpetual convolution. In vast cosmic interchanges universal life, disseminated and indivisible, comes and goes in unknown quantities, drawing everything into the unseen mystery of emanations, making use of everything, wasting not one dream, not one sleeping moment, sowing the seed of some tiny creature here, reducing to smithereens an astral body there, weaving and wavering, making of light a force and of thought an element, disintegrating everything except that geometric point, the ego; reducing everything to the soul atom; bringing everything to fulfilment in God; implicating all activities, from the highest to the lowest, in the obscurity of a dizzying mechanism, connecting the flight of an insect with the movement of the earth, subordinating – who knows? if only by the application of the same law – the comet whirling in the firmament to the protozoa wriggling in the drop of water. A mind-made machine. A vast intermeshed apparatus whose prime motor is the gnat and whose ultimate wheel the Zodiac.","Algebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star profits the rose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the course of a molecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little, the reverberations of causes in the precipices of being, and the avalanches of creation? The tiniest worm is of importance; the great is little, the little is great; everything is balanced in necessity; alarming vision for the mind. There are marvellous relations between beings and things; in that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the grub, nothing despises the other; all have need of each other. The light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it is doing; the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers. All birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite. Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg, and it places on one level the birth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two possesses the larger field of vision? Choose. A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers; a nebula is an ant-hill of stars. The same promiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented, exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of substance.

The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself. In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities, rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia, employing everything, not losing a single dream, not a single slumber, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling to bits a planet there, oscillating and winding, making of light a force and of thought an element, disseminated and invisible, dissolving all, except that geometrical point, the I; bringing everything back to the soul-atom; expanding everything in God, entangling all activity, from summit to base, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth, subordinating, who knows?

"Chose bizarre, dans l’espèce de symphonie où Marius vivait depuis qu’il voyait Cosette, le passé, même le plus récent, était devenu tellement confus et lointain pour lui que ce que Cosette lui conta le satisfit pleinement. Il ne songea même pas à lui parler de l’aventure nocturne de la masure, des Thénardier, de la brûlure, et de l’étrange attitude et de la singulière fuite de son père. Marius avait momentanément oublié tout cela ; il ne savait même pas le soir ce qu’il avait fait le matin, ni où il avait déjeuné, ni qui lui avait parlé ; il avait des chants dans l’oreille qui le rendaient sourd à toute autre pensée, il n’existait qu’aux heures où il voyait Cosette.

Marius had momentarily forgotten all that; he did not even know in the evening what he had done in the morning, or where he had breakfasted, or who had spoken to him; he had songs in his ears which made him deaf to every other thought, he existed only at the hours when he saw Cosette. So, since he was in heaven, it was quite easy for him to forget the earth. Both bore with languor the indefinable weight of immaterial pleasures. Thus live these somnambulists who are called lovers.","Strange to say, within the harmony, as it were, that Marius inhabited since he had been seeing Cosette, the past, even the very recent past, had become so distant and confused that what Cosette told him satisfied him completely.

"Une rougeur pourtant découpait sur ce fond noir la haute toiture des maisons qui barraient la rue de la Chanvrerie du côté de Saint-Eustache. C’était le reflet de la torche qui brûlait dans la barricade de Corinthe. Marius s’était dirigé sur cette rougeur. Elle l’avait amené au Marché-aux-poirées, et il entrevoyait l’embouchure ténébreuse de la rue des Prêcheurs. Il y entra. La vedette des insurgés qui guettait à l’autre bout ne l’aperçut pas. Il se sentait tout près de ce qu’il était venu chercher, et il marchait sur la pointe du pied. Il arriva ainsi au coude de ce court tronçon de la ruelle Mondétour qui était, on s’en souvient, la seule communication conservée par Enjolras avec le dehors. Au coin de la dernière maison, à sa gauche, il avança la tête, et regarda dans le tronçon Mondétour.","A blush, however, stood out against this black background the high roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on the Saint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch burning in the barricade of Corinth. Marius had directed himself to this redness. She had taken him to the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Prêcheurs. He entered it. The insurgent star who was watching at the other end did not see him. He felt very close to what he had come to seek, and he walked on tiptoe. He thus arrived at the bend of this short section of the Mondétour lane which was, as we remember, the only communication maintained by Enjolras with the outside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he stuck his head out and looked down the Mondetour section.","A red glow, however, outlined against this dark background the high rooftops of the houses that closed off Rue de la Chanvrerie on the St-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch burning on the Corinthe barricade. Marius headed towards this red glow. It led him to the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he saw the dark opening of Rue des Prêcheurs.

So he came to the corner of that short stretch of the Mondétour alleyway that was, remember, the only communication route Enjolras had preserved with the outside world. At the last house on the left, he poked his head round the corner and looked down that section of Mondétour.","Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on the Saint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which was burning in the Corinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps towards that red light. It had drawn him to the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Prêcheurs. He entered it. The insurgents’ sentinel, who was guarding the other end, did not see him. He felt that he was very close to that which he had come in search of, and he walked on tiptoe. In this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of the Rue Mondétour which was, as the reader will remember, the only communication which Enjolras had preserved with the outside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he thrust his head forward, and looked into the fragment of the Rue Mondétour.","A red glare, however, cut out upon this dark background the high roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on the side towards Saint Eustache.

In spite of this antiquity, the authorities committed the error of confining in the New Building the most troublesome prisoners, of placing there “the hard cases,” as they say in prison parlance.","Bâtiment Neuf, the most cracked and decrepit affair in the world, was the weak point of the prison. The walls were so much corroded by saltpetre that they had been obliged to put a facing of wood over the arches of the dormitories, because the stones detached themselves and fell upon the beds of the prisoners. Notwithstanding this decay, the blunder was committed of shutting up in the Bâtiment Neuf the most dangerous of the accused, of putting “the hard cases” in there, as they say in prison language."

"Le salon, nous venons de le dire, était tout en désordre. Il semblait qu’en prêtant l’oreille on eût pu y entendre encore la vague rumeur de la noce. Il y avait sur le parquet toutes sortes de fleurs tombées des guirlandes et des coiffures. Les bougies brûlées jusqu’au tronçon ajoutaient aux cristaux des lustres des stalactites de cire. Pas un meuble n’était à sa place. Dans des coins, trois ou quatre fauteuils, rapprochés les uns des autres et faisant cercle, avaient l’air de continuer une causerie. L’ensemble était riant. Il y a encore une certaine grâce dans une fête morte. Cela a été heureux. Sur ces chaises en désarroi, parmi ces fleurs qui se fanent, sous ces lumières éteintes, on a pensé de la joie. Le soleil succédait au lustre, et entrait gaîment dans le salon.","The living room, as we have just said, was all in disorder. It seemed that if you listened carefully you could still hear the vague rumor of the wedding. There were all kinds of flowers on the floor that had fallen from garlands and headdresses. Candles burned to the stump added to the crystals of wax stalactite chandeliers. Not a piece of furniture was out of place. In the corners, three or four armchairs, close together and forming a circle, seemed to be carrying on a conversation. The whole thing was laughing. There is still a certain grace in a dead party. It was happy. On these chairs in disarray, among these withering flowers, under these extinguished lights, one thought of joy. The sun followed the chandelier, and merrily entered the drawing-room.","The drawing room, as we have just said, was in total disorder.

Not a single piece of furniture was in its rightful place. In various corners three or four armchairs, drawn up together in a circle, appeared to be continuing a conversation. The general effect was pleasing. There is a certain lingering charm about the aftermath of a celebration. It had been a happy occasion.

"Une après-midi, — c’était une des premières journées d’avril, déjà chaude, encore fraîche, le moment de la grande gaîté du soleil, les jardins qui environnaient les fenêtres de Marius et de Cosette avaient l’émotion du réveil, l’aubépine allait poindre, une bijouterie de giroflées s’étalait sur les vieux murs, les gueules-de-loup roses bâillaient dans les fentes des pierres, il y avait dans l’herbe un charmant commencement de pâquerettes et de boutons-d’or, les papillons blancs de l’année débutaient, le vent, ce ménétrier de la noce éternelle, essayait dans les arbres les premières notes de cette grande symphonie aurorale que les vieux poètes appelaient le renouveau, — Marius dit à Cosette : ― Nous avons dit que nous irions revoir notre jardin de la rue Plumet. Allons-y. Il ne faut pas être ingrats. — Et ils s’envolèrent comme deux hirondelles vers le printemps. Ce jardin de la rue Plumet leur faisait l’effet de l’aube. Ils avaient déjà derrière eux dans la vie quelque chose qui était comme le printemps de leur amour. La maison de la rue Plumet, étant prise à bail, appartenait encore à Cosette. Ils allèrent à ce jardin et à cette maison. Ils s’y retrouvèrent, ils s’y oublièrent. Le soir, à l’heure ordinaire, Jean Valjean vint rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. ― Madame est sortie avec Monsieur, et n’est pas rentrée encore, lui dit Basque. — Il s’assit en silence et attendit une heure. Cosette ne rentra point. Il baissa la tête et s’en alla.","One afternoon—it was one of the first days of April, already hot, still cool, the moment of the sun's great gaiety, the gardens which surrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette had the emotion of awakening, the hawthorn was about to break, a jewel of wallflowers was spread over the old walls, the pink snapdragons were yawning in the crevices of the stones, there was in the grass a charming beginning of daisies and buttercups. now, the white butterflies of the year were beginning, the wind, that fiddler of the eternal wedding, was trying out in the trees the first notes of that great auroral symphony which the old poets called the renewal, — Marius said to Cosette: “We have said that we would go and see our garden in the rue Plumet again. Let's go. You don't have to be ungrateful. “And they flew away like two swallows towards spring. This garden in the rue Plumet gave them the effect of dawn. They already had something behind them in life that was like the springtime of their love. The house in the rue Plumet, being taken on lease, still belonged to Cosette. They went to this garden and to this house. They met there, they forgot themselves there. In the evening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean came to the rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. “Madame went out with Monsieur, and hasn’t come back yet,” said Basque to him. “He sat in silence and waited an hour. Cosette did not return. He lowered his head and walked away.","One afternoon – it was one of the first days of April, already warm, still fresh, the sun’s moment of great gladness, in the surrounding gardens outside Marius and Cosette’s windows were the stirrings of an awakening, the hawthorn was about to blossom, an array of gillyflowers bejewelled the old walls, yawning pink snapdragons poked through cracks between the stones, there were daisies and buttercups starting to spangle the grass, white butterflies were making their first appearance of the year, the wind, that fiddler at the eternal wedding dance, was rehearsing in the trees the first notes of that great dawn symphony which the old poets called the springtide – Marius said to Cosette, ‘We said we’d return to see our garden in Rue Plumet. Let’s go there. We mustn’t forget it.’ And they flew off like two swallows towards springtime. This garden in Rue Plumet was like a dawn to them. Already they had something behind them in life that was, as it were, the springtime of their love. The house in Rue Plumet, taken on a lease, still belonged to Cosette. They went to that garden and to that house. There they rediscovered themselves, there they forgot themselves. That evening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean came to Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. ‘Madame went out with Monsieur and has not yet returned,’ Basque told him. He sat down in silence and waited an hour. Cosette did not return. He bowed his head and left.","One afternoon,—it was on one of those early days in April, already warm and fresh, the moment of the sun’s great gayety, the gardens which surrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking, the hawthorn was on the point of budding, a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance, the wind, that minstrel of the eternal wedding, was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand, auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide,—Marius said to Cosette:—“We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the Rue Plumet. Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful. ”—And away they flitted, like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of the Rue Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn.

"Certes, et nous y insistons, il ne s’était pas rendu sans résistance à ce monstre, à cet ange infâme, à ce héros hideux, dont il était presque aussi indigné que stupéfait. Vingt fois, quand il était dans cette voiture face à face avec Jean Valjean, le tigre légal avait rugi en lui.

This man is for ever a prisoner of the law. The law will do with him what it will. What could be more just? Javert had said all this to himself.

They succeeded in finding the carriage which had brought Marius to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire on the evening of the 6th of June. The coachman declared that, on the 6th of June, in obedience to the commands of a police-agent, he had stood from three o’clock in the afternoon until nightfall on the Quai des Champs-Élysées, above the outlet of the Grand Sewer; that, towards nine o’clock in the evening, the grating of the sewer, which abuts on the bank of the river, had opened; that a man had emerged therefrom, bearing on his shoulders another man, who seemed to be dead; that the agent, who was on the watch at that point, had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man; that, at the order of the police-agent, he, the coachman, had taken “all those folks” into his carriage; that they had first driven to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; that they had there deposited the dead man; that the dead man was Monsieur Marius, and that he, the coachman, recognized him perfectly, although he was alive “this time”; that afterwards, they had entered the vehicle again, that he had whipped up his horses; a few paces from the gate of the Archives, they had called to him to halt; that there, in the street, they had paid him and left him, and that the police-agent had led the other man away; that he knew nothing more; that the night had been very dark.","As for the other, as for the unknown man who had saved Marius, the researches at first had some result, then stopped short. They succeeded in finding the fiacre which had brought Marius to the Rue des Filles du Calvaire on the evening of the 6th of June. The driver declared that on the 6th of June, by order of a police officer, he had been “stationed,” from three o’clock in the afternoon until night, on the quai of the Champs-Elysées, above the outlet of the Grand Sewer; that, about nine o’clock in the evening, the grating of the sewer, which overlooks the river beach, was opened; that a man came out, carrying another man on his shoulders, who seemed to be dead; that the officer, who was watching at that point, arrested the living man, and seized the dead man; that, on the order of the officer, he, the driver, received “all those people” into the fiacre; that they went first to the Rue des Filles du Calvaire; that they left the dead man there; that the dead man was Monsieur Marius, and that he, the driver, recognised him plainly, although he was alive “this time”; that they then got into his carriage again; that he whipped up his horses; that, within a few steps of the door of the Archives, he had been called to stop; that there, in the street, he had been paid and left, and that the officer took away the other man; that he knew nothing more, that the night was very dark."

"Cosette ne se rappelait que confusément son enfance. Elle priait matin et soir pour sa mère qu’elle n’avait pas connue. Les Thénardier lui étaient restés comme deux figures hideuses à l’état de rêve. Elle se rappelait qu’elle avait été « un jour, la nuit » chercher de l’eau dans un bois. Elle croyait que c’était très loin de Paris. Il lui semblait qu’elle avait commencé à vivre dans un abîme et que c’était Jean Valjean qui l’en avait tirée. Son enfance lui faisait l’effet d’un temps où il n’y avait autour d’elle que des mille-pieds, des araignées et des serpents. Quand elle songeait le soir avant de s’endormir, comme elle n’avait pas une idée très nette d’être la fille de Jean Valjean et qu’il fût son père, elle s’imaginait que l’âme de sa mère avait passé dans ce bonhomme et était venue demeurer auprès d’elle.","Cosette remembered her childhood only vaguely. She prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. The Thénardiers had remained with him like two hideous figures in the state of a dream. She remembered that she had been ""one day, at night"" to fetch water in a wood. She thought it was very far from Paris. It seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it was Jean Valjean who had drawn her out of it. Her childhood seemed to her like a time when there were only centipedes, spiders and snakes around her. When she thought in the evening before going to sleep, as she had no very clear idea of being Jean Valjean's daughter and that he was her father, she imagined that her mother's soul had passed in this fellow and had come to stay with her.","Cosette only dimly remembered her early childhood. She prayed morning and evening for the mother she had not known. The Thénardiers stayed with her in a dreamlike way, as two hideous figures. She remembered that she had been to fetch water from the forest ‘one day, in the dark’. She thought that was somewhere very far away from Paris. It seemed to her she had started out living in a chasm, and it was Jean Valjean who had pulled her out of it. Her childhood seemed to her a time when there had been nothing around her but millipedes, spiders and snakes. Since the notion of being Jean Valjean’s daughter and of his being her father was not very clear to her, when in the evening before falling asleep her thoughts ran on, she imagined that her mother’s soul had entered the old man and come to stay close to her.","Cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood.

It seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean Valjean who had rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds, spiders, and serpents. When she meditated in the evening, before falling asleep, as she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean’s daughter, and that he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her.","Cosette had but vague remembrance of her childhood.

"On se barricadait dans les maisons ; les femmes et les mères s’inquiétaient ; on n’entendait que ceci : Ah mon Dieu ! il n’est pas rentré ! Il y avait à peine au loin quelques rares roulements de voitures. On écoutait, sur le pas des portes, les rumeurs, les cris, les tumultes, les bruits sourds et indistincts des choses dont on disait : C’est la cavalerie, ou : Ce sont des caissons qui galopent, les clairons, les tambours, la fusillade, et surtout ce lamentable tocsin de Saint-Merry. On attendait le premier coup de canon. Des hommes surgissaient au coin des rues et disparaissaient en criant : Rentrez chez vous ! Et l’on se hâtait de verrouiller les portes. On disait : Comment cela finira-t-il ? D’instant en instant, à mesure que la nuit tombait, Paris semblait se colorer plus lugubrement du flamboiement formidable de l’émeute.","We barricaded ourselves in the houses; women and mothers worried; we only heard this: Ah my God! he didn't come home! There were barely a few rare car bearings in the distance. We listened, on the steps of the doors, to the rumors, the cries, the tumults, the dull and indistinct noises of the things of which we said: It is the cavalry, or: These are the galloping caissons, the bugles, the drums, the fusillade, and above all that lamentable tocsin of Saint-Merry. We were waiting for the first cannon shot. Men would appear on street corners and disappear, shouting: Go home! And we hastened to lock the doors. They said: How will this end? From moment to moment, as night fell, Paris seemed to take on a more lugubrious color with the formidable blaze of the riot.","People barricaded themselves in their houses, wives and mothers fretted. The constant refrain was ‘Oh my God! He’s not home yet!’ Audible in the distance were no more than a few rare carriages rolling by. Out on their doorsteps people listened to the clamour, the shouting, the disturbance, muffled and indistinct sounds, things that prompted them to say, ‘It’s the cavalry’ or ‘ That’s wagons thundering about’; trumpets, drums, volleys of rifle-fire and above all that doleful tolling of St-Merry’s bell. Everyone was waiting for the first cannon to be fired. Armed men appeared at street corners, then disappeared, shouting, ‘Get inside!’ And people rushed to bolt their doors. They said, ‘How will it all end?’ With every passing moment, as darkness fell, Paris seemed to take on a more lurid hue from the tremendous blaze of the riot.","People barricaded themselves in their houses; wives and mothers were uneasy; nothing was to be heard but this: “ Ah! my God! He has not come home!” There was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be heard. People listened on their thresholds, to the rumors, the shouts, the tumult, the dull and indistinct sounds, to the things that were said: “It is cavalry,” or: “Those are the caissons galloping,” to the trumpets, the drums, the firing, and, above all, to that lamentable alarm peal from Saint-Merry. They waited for the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners of the streets and disappeared, shouting: “Go home!” And people made haste to bolt their doors. They said: “How will all this end?” From moment to moment, in proportion as the darkness descended, Paris seemed to take on a more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt.","People barricaded themselves in their houses; wives and mothers were terrified; you heard only this: Oh! my God! he has not come back!

"Jean Valjean redevint tout à fait tranquille ; quant à Cosette, elle ne remarqua pas beaucoup si le tuyau de poêle était bien dans la direction de l’ombre qu’elle avait vue ou cru voir, et si la lune se trouvait au même point du ciel. Elle ne s’interrogea point sur cette singularité d’un tuyau de poêle qui craint d’être pris en flagrant délit et qui se retire quand on regarde son ombre, car l’ombre s’était effacée quand Cosette s’était retournée et Cosette avait bien cru en être sûre. Cosette se rasséréna pleinement. La démonstration lui parut complète, et qu’il pût y avoir quelqu’un qui marchait le soir ou la nuit dans le jardin, ceci lui sortit de la tête.","Jean Valjean became completely calm again; as for Cosette, she did not notice much if the stovepipe was really in the direction of the shadow she had seen or thought she saw, and if the moon was at the same point in the sky. She did not wonder about this singularity of a stovepipe which fears being caught red-handed and which withdraws when one looks at its shadow, for the shadow had been effaced when Cosette had turned round and Cosette thought he was sure of it. Cosette completely reassured herself. The demonstration seemed to him complete, and that there could be someone walking in the evening or at night in the garden slipped his mind.","Jean Valjean’s peace of mind was fully restored. As for Cosette, she did not give much thought as to whether the stove pipe was in the same direction as the shadow she had seen, or thought she had seen, and whether the moon had been in the same part of the sky. She did not wonder about the peculiarity of a stove pipe that is afraid of being caught out in the open and draws back when someone looks at its shadow, for the shadow had vanished when Cosette turned round, and Cosette had felt very sure of this. Cosette’s fears were completely allayed. The demonstration seemed conclusive to her and put out of her mind the idea that there could be anyone walking in the garden in the evening or at night.","Jean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as for Cosette, she did not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought she had seen, and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky. She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot which is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when some one looks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when Cosette had turned round, and Cosette had thought herself very sure of this. Cosette’s serenity was fully restored. The proof appeared to her to be complete, and it quite vanished from her mind, whether there could possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at night.","Jean Valjean became entirely calm again; as to Cosette, she did not notice very carefully whether the stove-pipe was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought she saw, and whether the moon was in the same part of the sky. She made no question about the oddity of a stove-pipe which is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when you look at its shadow, for the shadow had disappeared when Cosette turned round, and Cosette had really believed that she was certain of that. Cosette was fully reassured. The demonstration appeared to her complete, and the idea that there could have been anybody walking in the garden that evening, or that night, no longer entered her head."
"C’est que de toutes les tortures qu’il avait subies dans cette longue question que lui donnait la destinée, celle-ci était la plus redoutable. Jamais pareille tenaille ne l’avait saisi.

Never had such pincers seized him. He felt the mysterious stirring of all the latent sensitivities. He felt the pinch of the unknown fiber. Alas, the supreme test, let's say better, the unique test, is the loss of the loved one.","The truth is that of all the tortures he had suffered during that lengthy persecution to which he was doomed, this was the most terrible. Never had he been so lacerated. He felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities. He felt agonized in every last fibre of his being. Alas! the supreme test, or rather, the only test, is the loss of the beloved.","It was because, of all the tortures which he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him, this was the most terrible. Never had such pincers seized him hitherto. He felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities. He felt the plucking at the strange chord. Alas! the supreme trial, let us say rather, the only trial, is the loss of the beloved being.","For, of all the tortures which he had undergone in that inquisition of destiny, this was the most fearful.

"Débarrassée est le mot. Il n’y avait chez cette femme qu’un fragment de nature. Phénomène dont il y a du reste plus d’un exemple. Comme la maréchale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, la Thénardier n’était mère que jusqu’à ses filles. Sa maternité finissait là. Sa haine du genre humain commençait à ses garçons. Du côté de ses fils sa méchanceté était à pic, et son cœur avait à cet endroit un lugubre escarpement. Comme on l’a vu, elle détestait l’aîné ; elle exécrait les deux autres. Pourquoi ? Parce que. Le plus terrible des motifs et la plus indiscutable des réponses : Parce que. ― Je n’ai pas besoin d’une tiaulée d’enfants, disait cette mère.","Cleared is the word. There was only a fragment of nature in this woman. A phenomenon of which there is more than one example. Like Maréchale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, Thénardier was only a mother up to her daughters. Her motherhood ended there. His hatred of the human race began with his boys. On the side of his sons his wickedness was sheer, and his heart there had a mournful escarpment. As we have seen, she hated the eldest; she hated the other two. Why ? Because. The most terrible of motives and the most indisputable of answers: Because. ""I don't need a slew of children,"" said this mother.","‘Disencumbered’ is the right word. There was only a fraction of natural feeling in that woman. A phenomenon of which there is more than one example, as a matter of fact. Like the Maréchale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the Thénardier woman was a mother only to her daughters. Her maternal instincts ended there. Her hatred of the human race began with her sons. Towards her boys she was downright cruel, and her heart was a bleak stone wall to them. As we have seen, she detested the eldest. She could not bear the sight of the other two. Why? Because. The most terrible of motives, the most indisputable of responses. Because. ‘I don’t need a gaggle of children,’ said this mother.","Got rid of is the word. There was but a mere fragment of nature in that woman.

"Comme il arrive toujours dans les changements à vue de cette espèce, Marius se demandait s’il n’avait pas de reproche à se faire à lui-même ? Avait-il manqué de divination ? Avait-il manqué de prudence ? S’était-il étourdi involontairement ? Un peu, peut-être. S’était-il engagé, sans assez de précaution pour éclairer les alentours, dans cette aventure d’amour qui avait abouti à son mariage avec Cosette ? Il constatait, — c’est ainsi, par une suite de constatations successives de nous-mêmes sur nous-mêmes, que la vie nous amende peu à peu, — il constatait le côté chimérique et visionnaire de sa nature, sorte de nuage intérieur propre à beaucoup d’organisations, et qui, dans les paroxysmes de la passion et de la douleur, se dilate, la température de l’âme changeant, et envahit l’homme tout entier, au point de n’en plus faire qu’une conscience baignée d’un brouillard. Nous avons plus d’une fois indiqué cet élément caractéristique de l’individualité de Marius. Il se rappelait que, dans l’enivrement de son amour, rue Plumet, pendant ces six ou sept semaines extatiques, il n’avait pas même parlé à Cosette de ce drame du bouge Gorbeau où la victime avait eu un si étrange parti pris de silence pendant la lutte et d’évasion après. Comment se faisait-il qu’il n’en eût point parlé à Cosette ? Cela pourtant était si proche et si effroyable ! Comment se faisait-il qu’il ne lui eût pas même nommé les Thénardier, et, particulièrement, le jour où il avait rencontré Éponine ? Il avait presque peine à s’expliquer maintenant son silence d’alors. Il s’en rendait compte cependant. Il se rappelait son étourdissement, son ivresse de Cosette, l’amour absorbant tout, cet enlèvement de l’un par l’autre dans l’idéal, et peut-être aussi, comme la quantité imperceptible de raison mêlée à cet état violent et charmant de l’âme, un vague et sourd instinct de cacher et d’abolir dans sa mémoire cette aventure redoutable dont il craignait le contact, où il ne voulait jouer aucun rôle, à laquelle il se dérobait, et où il ne pouvait être narrateur ni témoin sans être accusateur. D’ailleurs, ces quelques semaines avaient été un éclair ; on n’avait eu le temps de rien, que de s’aimer. Enfin, tout pesé, tout retourné, tout examiné, quand il eût raconté le guet-apens Gorbeau à Cosette, quand il lui eût nommé les Thénardier, quelles qu’eussent été les conséquences, quand même il eût découvert que Jean Valjean était un forçat, cela l’eût-il changé, lui Marius ? cela l’eût-il changée, elle Cosette ? Eût-il reculé ? L’eût-il moins adorée ? L’eût-il moins épousée ? Non. Cela eût-il changé quelque chose à ce qui s’était fait ? Non. Rien donc à regretter, rien à se reprocher. Tout était bien. Il y a un dieu pour ces ivrognes qu’on appelle les amoureux. Aveugle, Marius avait suivi la route qu’il eût choisie clairvoyant. L’amour lui avait bandé les yeux, pour le mener où ? Au paradis.","As always happens in sight changes of this kind, Marius wondered if he had no reason to reproach himself? Had he lacked divination? Had he been careless? Was he unintentionally dazed? A little, maybe. Had he embarked, without sufficient precaution to enlighten the surroundings, on this love affair which had ended in his marriage to Cosette? He noticed - it is thus, by a series of successive observations of ourselves on ourselves, that life improves us little by little - he noticed the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a kind of inner cloud proper to many organizations, and which, in the paroxysms of passion and pain, expands, the temperature of the soul changing, and invades the whole man, to the point of making one consciousness bathed in a fog. We have more than once indicated this characteristic element of the individuality of Marius. He remembered that, in the intoxication of his love, rue Plumet, during those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoken to Cosette of that drama at the Gorbeau den where the victim had had such a strange silence during the fight and escape afterwards. How was it that he had not mentioned it to Cosette? This, however, was so near and so dreadful! How was it that he had not even mentioned the Thénardiers to her, and particularly on the day he had met Éponine? He could hardly explain his silence now. He did realize it though. He remembered his bewilderment, his intoxication of Cosette, love absorbing everything, this abduction of one by the other in the ideal, and perhaps also, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming of the soul, a vague and deaf instinct to hide and to abolish in his memory this formidable adventure whose contact he feared, in which he did not want to play any role, from which he shirked, and in which he could not be the narrator nor a witness without being an accuser. Besides, those few weeks had been a flash; there had been no time for anything except to love each other. Finally, everything weighed, turned over, everything examined, when he had related the Gorbeau ambush to Cosette, when he had named the Thénardiers to her, whatever the consequences, even when he had discovered that Jean Valjean was a convict. Would that have changed him, Marius? would that have changed her, Cosette? Would he back down? Would he have adored her less? Would he have married her less? No. Would that have changed anything in what had been done? No. So nothing to regret, nothing to reproach yourself with. Everything was fine. There is a god for those drunkards called lovers. Blind, Marius had followed the road he would have chosen, seeing. Love had blindfolded him, to lead him where? In Paradise.","As always in such dramatic turnabouts, Marius wondered whether he had anything to blame himself for. Had he lacked discernment? Had he lacked caution? Had he been unintentionally thoughtless? A little, perhaps. Had he embarked on this love affair that had led to his marriage to Cosette without sufficient regard to her circumstances? He acknowledged – so it is, by a series of successive acknowledgements about ourselves to ourselves, that life improves us little by little – the fanciful and visionary side of his nature, a kind of inner haze typical of many constitutions and which, in the paroxysms of passion and of sorrow, expands with the soul’s changing temperature and entirely takes over, so that the individual is reduced to no more than a fog-bound consciousness. We have more than once pointed to this trait in Marius’s personality. He remembered that in the euphoria of his love, in Rue Plumet, during those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoken to Cosette of that puzzling drama in the Gorbeau tenement in which the victim had behaved so strangely, remaining silent during the fighting and taking flight afterwards. How was it that he had not spoken of this to Cosette? Yet it was so recent and so terrible! How was it that he had not even mentioned the Thénardiers’ name, and particularly on the day he encountered Éponine? Now he could hardly explain to himself his silence at the time. He was aware of it, though. He remembered his giddiness, his intoxicating passion for Cosette, love absorbing everything, each transporting the other into the realms of the ideal; and perhaps, too, like the little touch of reason mingling with that delightful and intense state of emotion, some underlying instinct to conceal and to blot from his memory that dreadful incident in which he feared any involvement, in which he wanted to play no part, from which he shied away, and of which he could be neither narrator nor witness without also accusing. Besides, those few weeks had gone by in flash. There had been no time for anything except loving each other. In any case, all things considered, weighed up, examined, supposing he had told Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, supposing he had mentioned the Thénardiers’ name to her, whatever the consequences might have been – even if he had discovered that Jean Valjean was a convicted felon – would that have changed him, Marius? Would that have changed Cosette? Would he have backed away? Would he have adored her any the less? Would he have married her any the less? No. Would it have changed anything that happened? No. Nothing to regret, then, nothing for which to reproach himself. Everything was fine. There is a god for those drunkards called lovers. Marius had blindly followed the path he would have chosen had he been able to see clearly. Love had blindfolded him, to lead him where? To paradise.","As is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. Had he been wanting in divination? Had he been wanting in prudence? Had he involuntarily dulled his wits? A little, perhaps. Had he entered upon this love affair, which had ended in his marriage to Cosette, without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings? He admitted,—it is thus, by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves, that life amends us, little by little,—he admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a sort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations, and which, in paroxysms of passion and sorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes, and invades the entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a conscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once indicated this characteristic element of Marius’ individuality. He recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet, during those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoken to Cosette of that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight. How had it happened that he had not mentioned this to Cosette? Yet it was so near and so terrible! How had it come to pass that he had not even named the Thénardiers, and, particularly, on the day when he had encountered Éponine? He now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time. Nevertheless, he could account for it. He recalled his benumbed state, his intoxication with Cosette, love absorbing everything, that catching away of each other into the ideal, and perhaps also, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure, contact with which he dreaded, in which he did not wish to play any part, his agency in which he had kept secret, and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser. Moreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had been no time for anything except love. In short, having weighed everything, turned everything over in his mind, examined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if he had told Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered that Jean Valjean was a convict, would that have changed him, Marius? Would that have changed her, Cosette? Would he have drawn back? Would he have adored her any the less? Would he have refrained from marrying her? No. Then there was nothing to regret, nothing with which he need reproach himself. All was well. There is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers. Marius blind, had followed the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight. Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither? To paradise.","As always happens in changes of view of this kind, Marius questioned himself whether he had not some fault to find with himself? Had he been wanting in perception? Had he been wanting in prudence? Had he been involuntarily stupefied? A little, perhaps. Had he entered, without enough precaution in clearing up its surroundings, upon this love adventure which had ended in his marriage with Cosette? He determined—it is thus, by a succession of determinations by ourselves in regard to ourselves, that life improves us little by little—he determined the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a sort of interior cloud peculiar to many organisations, and which, in paroxysms of passion and grief, dilates, the temperature of the soul changing, and pervades the entire man, to such an extent as to make him nothing more than a consciousness steeped in a fog. We have more than once indicated this characteristic element of Marius’ individuality. He recollected that, in the infatuation of his love, in the Rue Plumet, during those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoken to Cosette of that drama of the Gorbeau den in which the victim had taken the very strange course of silence during the struggle, and of escape after it. How had he managed not to speak of it to Cosette? Yet it was so near and so frightful. How had he managed not even to name the Thénardiers to her, and, particularly, the day that he met Eponine? He had great difficulty now in explaining to himself his former silence. He did account for it, however. He recalled his stupor, his intoxication for Cosette, love absorbing everything, that uplifting of one by the other into the ideal, and perhaps also, as the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul, a vague and dull instinct to hide and to abolish in his memory that terrible affair with which he dreaded contact, in which he wished to play no part, which he shunned, and in regard to which he could be neither narrator nor witness without being accuser. Besides, those few weeks had been but a flash; they had had time for nothing, except to love. Finally, everything being weighed, turned over, and examined, if he had told the story of the Gorbeau ambuscade to Cosette, if he had named the Thénardiers to her, what would have been the consequences, if he had even discovered Jean Valjean was a convict, would that have changed him, Marius? Would that have changed her, Cosette? Would he have shrunk back? Would he have adored her less? Would he the less have married her? No. Would it have changed anything in what had taken place? No. Nothing then to regret, nothing to reproach himself with. All was well. There is a God for these drunkards who are called lovers. Blind, Marius had followed the route which he would have chosen had he seen clearly. Love had bandaged his eyes, to lead him where? To Paradise."

"Abrégeons. La barricade avait lutté comme une porte de Thèbes, le cabaret lutta comme une maison de Saragosse. Ces résistances-là sont bourrues. Pas de quartier. Pas de parlementaire possible. On veut mourir pourvu qu’on tue. Quand Suchet dit : ― Capitulez, ― Palafox répond : « Après la guerre au canon, la guerre au couteau. » Rien ne manqua à la prise d’assaut du cabaret Hucheloup ; ni les pavés pleuvant de la fenêtre et du toit sur les assiégeants et exaspérant les soldats par d’horribles écrasements, ni les coups de feu des caves et des mansardes, ni la fureur de l’attaque, ni la rage de la défense, ni enfin, quand la porte céda, les démences frénétiques de l’extermination. Les assaillants, en se ruant dans le cabaret, les pieds embarrassés dans les panneaux de la porte enfoncée et jetée à terre, n’y trouvèrent pas un combattant. L’escalier en spirale, coupé à coups de hache, gisait au milieu de la salle basse, quelques blessés achevaient d’expirer, tout ce qui n’était pas tué était au premier étage, et là, par le trou du plafond, qui avait été l’entrée de l’escalier, un feu terrifiant éclata. C’étaient les dernières cartouches. Quand elles furent brûlées, quand ces agonisants redoutables n’eurent plus ni poudre ni balles, chacun prit à la main deux de ces bouteilles réservées par Enjolras et dont nous avons parlé, et ils tinrent tête à l’escalade avec ces massues effroyablement fragiles. C’étaient des bouteilles d’eau-forte. Nous disons telles qu’elles sont ces choses sombres du carnage. L’assiégé, hélas, fait arme de tout. Le feu grégeois n’a pas déshonoré Archimède, la poix bouillante n’a pas déshonoré Bayard. Toute la guerre est de l’épouvante, et il n’y a rien à y choisir. La mousqueterie des assiégeants, quoique gênée et de bas en haut, était meurtrière. Le rebord du trou du plafond fut bientôt entouré de têtes mortes d’où ruisselaient de longs fils rouges et fumants. Le fracas était inexprimable ; une fumée enfermée et brûlante faisait presque la nuit sur ce combat. Les mots manquent pour dire l’horreur arrivée à ce degré. Il n’y avait plus d’hommes dans cette lutte maintenant infernale. Ce n’étaient plus des géants contre des colosses. Cela ressemblait plus à Milton et à Dante qu’à Homère. Des démons attaquaient, des spectres résistaient.","Let's abbreviate. The barricade had struggled like a gate in Thebes, the cabaret struggled like a house in Saragossa. These resistances are gruff. Show no mercy. No parliamentarian possible. We want to die as long as we kill. When Suchet says: ―Surrender, ―Palafox replies: “After the cannon war, the knife war. Nothing was lacking in the storming of the Cabaret Hucheloup; neither the cobblestones raining from the window and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers by horrible crushings, nor the shots from the cellars and garrets, nor the fury of the attack, nor the rage of the defense, nor finally, when the door gave way, the frenzied madness of extermination. The assailants, rushing into the cabaret, their feet embarrassed in the panels of the door, which had been broken in and thrown to the ground, did not find a combatant there. The spiral staircase, cut with the blows of an axe, lay in the middle of the lower hall, a few wounded were nearing their end, all that had not been killed were on the first floor, and there, through the hole in the ceiling, which had been the entrance to the staircase, a terrifying fire broke out. These were the last cartridges. When they were burned, when these redoubtable dying had no more powder or bullets, each took in his hand two of these bottles reserved by Enjolras and of which we have spoken, and they resisted the escalation with these frightfully fragile clubs. They were bottles of aquafortis. We say as they are these dark things of carnage. The besieged, alas, makes arms of everything. Greek fire did not dishonor Archimedes, boiling pitch did not dishonor Bayard. All war is horror, and there is nothing to choose from. The musketry of the besiegers, though hampered and from the bottom up, was deadly. The rim of the hole in the ceiling was soon surrounded by dead heads from which streamed long red and smoking threads. The crash was inexpressible; a locked up and burning smoke made almost the night on this fight. Words fail to describe the horror that has reached this level. There were no more men in this now hellish struggle. It was no longer giants against colossi. It sounded more like Milton and Dante than Homer. Demons attacked, specters resisted.","To cut this long story short, the barricade had fought like one of the gates of Thebes; the tavern fought like one of the houses of Saragossa. Such resistances are obdurate. No quarter is given. No truce possible. Men are willing to die, provided they can kill. When Suchet says, ‘Capitulate’, Palafox replies, ‘From cannon warfare to knife warfare.’ The storming of the Hucheloup tavern lacked nothing – neither the cobblestones raining down from the windows and the roof on to the besiegers and provoking the soldiers by causing horrible injuries, nor the gunshots fired from the cellars and the dormer windows, nor the ferocity of the attack, nor the fierceness of the defence, nor finally, when the door gave way, the frenzied madness of the killing. Getting their feet entangled in the panels of the door that had been broken down and thrown to the ground, the assailants came rushing into the tavern to find not a single fighter there. The spiral staircase, cut down with an axe, lay in the middle of the downstairs room; there were a few wounded men breathing their last, anyone who had not been killed was on the first floor, and from there, through the hole in the ceiling that had been the staircase opening, a tremendous firing now broke out. These were the last of their cartridges. When they were used up, when these warriors facing death had no powder or bullets left, each took hold of two of the bottles set aside by Enjolras, mentioned earlier, and they held off the ascent of their attackers with these fearsomely fragile bludgeons. They were bottles of nitric acid. We relate these sombre facts of carnage as they were. The besieged, alas! use everything as a weapon. Greek fire brought no disgrace on Archimedes, boiling pitch brought no disgrace on Bayard. All war is terror, and there is nothing to choose between one form and another. Although constrained and directed upwards from below, the besiegers’ rifle-fire was deadly. The hole in the ceiling was soon ringed with the heads of the slain, with long, red rivulets streaming from them. The pandemonium was indescribable. Stifling, burning smoke created near-night above this conflict. There are no words to describe this degree of horror. These were no longer men taking part in the now infernal struggle. These were no longer giants against Titans. This was more Milton and Dante than Homer. Fiends attacked, phantoms resisted.","Let us abridge the tale. The barricade had fought like a gate of Thebes; the wine-shop fought like a house of Saragossa. These resistances are dogged. No quarter. No flag of truce possible. Men are willing to die, provided their opponent will kill them. When Suchet says:—“Capitulate,”—Palafox replies: “After the war with cannon, the war with knives.” Nothing was lacking in the capture by assault of the Hucheloup wine-shop; neither paving-stones raining from the windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers by crushing them horribly, nor shots fired from the attic-windows and the cellar, nor the fury of attack, nor, finally, when the door yielded, the frenzied madness of extermination. The assailants, rushing into the wine-shop, their feet entangled in the panels of the door which had been beaten in and flung on the ground, found not a single combatant there. The spiral staircase, hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the middle of the tap-room, a few wounded men were just breathing their last, every one who was not killed was on the first floor, and from there, through the hole in the ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs, a terrific fire burst forth. It was the last of their cartridges. When they were exhausted, when these formidable men on the point of death had no longer either powder or ball, each grasped in his hands two of the bottles which Enjolras had reserved, and of which we have spoken, and held the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs. They were bottles of aquafortis. We relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred. The besieged man, alas! converts everything into a weapon. Greek fire did not disgrace Archimedes, boiling pitch did not disgrace Bayard. All war is a thing of terror, and there is no choice in it. The musketry of the besiegers, though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below upwards, was deadly. The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain, whence dripped long, red and smoking streams, the uproar was indescribable; a close and burning smoke almost produced night over this combat. Words are lacking to express horror when it has reached this pitch. There were no longer men in this conflict, which was now infernal. They were no longer giants matched with colossi. It resembled Milton and Dante rather than Homer. Demons attacked, spectres resisted.","We must be brief. The barricade had struggled like a gate of Thebes; the wine-shop struggled like a house of Saragossa. Such resistances are dogged. No quarter. No parley possible. They are willing to die provided they kill. When Suchet says: “Capitulate,” Palafox answers: “After the war with cannon, war with the knife.” Nothing was wanting to the storming of the Hucheloup wine-shop: neither the paving-stones raining from the window and the roof upon the besiegers, and exasperating the soldiers by their horrible mangling, nor the shots from the cellars and the garret windows, nor fury of attack, nor rage of defence; nor, finally, when the door yielded, the frenzied madness of the extermination.

The spiral stairway, which had been cut down with the axe, lay in the middle of the basement room, a few wounded had just expired, all who were not killed were in the first story, and there, through the hole in the ceiling, which had been the entrance for the stairway, a terrific firing broke out. It was the last of the cartridges. When they were gone, when these terrible men in their death-agony had no longer either powder or ball, each took two of those bottles reserved by Enjolras, of which we have spoken, and they defended the ascent with these frightfully fragile clubs. They were bottles of aquafortis. We describe these gloomy facts of the carnage as they are. The besieged, alas, make a weapon of everything. Greek fire did not dishonour Archimedes, boiling pitch did not dishonour Bayard. All war is appalling, and there is nothing to choose in it. The fire of the besiegers, although difficult and from below upwards, was murderous. The edge of the hole in the ceiling was very soon surrounded with the heads of the dead, from which flowed long red and reeking lines. The uproar was inexpressible; a stifled and burning smoke made night almost over this combat. Words fail to express horror when it reaches this degree. There were men no longer in this now infernal conflict. They were no longer giants against colossi. It resembled Milton and Dante rather than Homer. Demons attacked, spectres resisted."

"― Écoute, repartit Gavroche, il ne faut plus geindre jamais pour rien. J’aurai soin de vous. Tu verras comme on s’amuse. L’été, nous irons à la Glacière avec Navet, un camarade à moi, nous nous baignerons à la gare, nous courrons tout nus sur les trains devant le pont d’Austerlitz, ça fait rager les blanchisseuses. Elles crient, elles bisquent, si tu savais comme elles sont farces ! Nous irons voir l’homme squelette. Il est en vie. Aux Champs-Élysées. Il est maigre comme tout, ce paroissien-là. Et puis je vous conduirai au spectacle. Je vous mènerai à Frédérick-Lemaître. J’ai des billets, je connais des acteurs, j’ai même joué une fois dans une pièce. Nous étions des mômes comme ça, on courait sous une toile, ça faisait la mer. Je vous ferai engager à mon théâtre. Nous irons voir les sauvages. Ce n’est pas vrai, ces sauvages-là. Ils ont des maillots roses qui font des plis, et on leur voit aux coudes des reprises en fil blanc. Après ça, nous irons à l’Opéra. Nous entrerons avec les claqueurs. La claque à l’Opéra est très bien composée. Je n’irais pas avec la claque sur les boulevards. A l’Opéra, figure-toi, il y en a qui payent vingt sous, mais c’est des bêtas. On les appelle des lavettes. ― Et puis nous irons voir guillotiner. Je vous ferai voir le bourreau. Il demeure rue des Marais. Monsieur Sanson. Il y a une boîte aux lettres à la porte. Ah ! on s’amuse fameusement !","“Listen,” rejoined Gavroche, “you must never complain again for nothing. I will take care of you. You'll see how much fun we have. In the summer, we'll go to La Glacière with Navet, a friend of mine, we'll swim at the station, we'll run naked on the trains in front of the Pont d'Austerlitz, it makes the laundresses rage. They shout, they bisque, if you only knew how farcical they are! We will go see the skeleton man. It is alive. To the Champs Elysees. He's skinny as hell, that parishioner. And then I'll drive you to the show. I'll take you to Frédérick-Lemaître. I have tickets, I know actors, I even acted in a play once. We were kids like that, we ran under a canvas, it made the sea. I'll get you hired at my theatre. We will go see the savages. That's not true, those savages. They have pink shirts that make folds, and we see their elbows with white thread covers. After that, we will go to the Opera. We will enter with the clickers. The slap at the Opera is very well composed. I would not go with the slap on the boulevards. At the Opera, imagine, there are some who pay twenty sous, but they are stupid. They are called washcloths. ―And then we will go and see the guillotine. I will show you the executioner. He lives on rue des Marais. Mr Sanson. There is a mailbox at the door. Ah! we are having fun!","‘Listen,’ Gavroche went on, ‘you must never ever snivel again over nothing. I’ll take care of you. You’ll see what fun we’ll have. In summer we’ll go to La Glacière with Navet, a comrade of mine, we’ll swim in the canal basin, we’ll run stark-naked on the barges in front of the Pont d’Austerlitz – that riles the washerwomen. They shout and holler, if you only knew how funny they are! We’ll go and see the skeleton man. He’s alive! In the Champs-Élysées. He’s as thin as anything, that character. And then I’ll take you to the theatre. I’ll take you to see Frédérick Lemaître. I’ve got tickets, I know some actors, I was even in a play once. We were little kids, and we ran under a sheet, and that made the sea. I’ll get you a job at my theatre. We’ll go and see the savages. They’re not real savages, these ones. They wear pink maillots that wrinkle, and you can see where their elbows’ve been darned with white thread. After that, we’ll go to the Opéra. We’ll go in with the hired clappers. The hired clappers at the Opéra are very select. I wouldn’t go with the clappers on the boulevards. At the Opéra, imagine, there’s some who pay twenty sous, but they’re boobies. Wet rags we call them. And then we’ll go and watch the guillotine at work. I’ll show you the executioner. He lives in Rue des Marais. Monsieur Sanson. There’s a letter-box in his front door. Oh! we’ll have terrific fun!’","“Listen,” went on Gavroche, “you must never bawl again over anything. I’ll take care of you. You shall see what fun we’ll have. In summer, we’ll go to the Glacière with Navet, one of my pals, we’ll bathe in the Gare, we’ll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at Austerlitz,—that makes the laundresses raging. They scream, they get mad, and if you only knew how ridiculous they are! We’ll go and see the man-skeleton. And then I’ll take you to the play. I’ll take you to see Frédérick Lemaître. I have tickets, I know some of the actors, I even played in a piece once. There were a lot of us fellers, and we ran under a cloth, and that made the sea. I’ll get you an engagement at my theatre. We’ll go to see the savages. They ain’t real, those savages ain’t. They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white. Then, we’ll go to the Opera. We’ll get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is well managed. I wouldn’t associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the Opera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but they’re ninnies. They’re called dishclouts. And then we’ll go to see the guillotine work. I’ll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais. Monsieur Sanson. He has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we’ll have famous fun!”","“Listen to me,” continued Gavroche, “you must never whine any more for anything. I will take care of you. You will see what fun we have. In summer we will go to the Glacière with Navet, a comrade of mine, we will go in swimming in the Basin, we will run on the track before the Bridge of Austerlitz all naked, that makes the washerwomen mad. They scream, they scold, if you only knew how funny they are! We will go to see the skeleton man. He is alive. At the Champs-Elysées. That parishioner is as thin as anything. And then I will take you to the theatre. I will take you to Frederick Lemaître’s. I have tickets, I know the actors, I even played once in a piece. We were mômes so high, we ran about under a cloth, that made the sea. I will have you engaged at my theatre. We will go and see the savages. They’re not real, those savages. They have red tights which wrinkle, and you can see their elbows darned with white thread. After that we will go to the Opera. We will go in with the claqueurs.

"On pillait une fabrique d’armes, boulevard Saint-Martin, et trois boutiques d’armuriers, la première rue Beaubourg, la deuxième rue Michel-le-Comte, l’autre, rue du Temple. En quelques minutes les mille mains de la foule saisissaient et emportaient deux cent trente fusils, presque tous à deux coups, soixante-quatre sabres, quatrevingt-trois pistolets.

"Du reste, il y a, et il convient d’ajouter cette distinction aux distinctions déjà indiquées dans un autre chapitre, il y a les insurrections acceptées qui s’appellent révolutions ; il y a les révolutions refusées qui s’appellent émeutes.

Si le peuple laisse tomber sa boule noire, l’idée est fruit sec, l’insurrection est échauffourée.","Moreover, there are, and this distinction should be added to the distinctions already indicated in another chapter, there are accepted insurrections which are called revolutions; there are the rejected revolutions which are called riots.

An insurrection that catches fire is an idea that in the people’s view has passed its test. If the people blackball it, the idea comes to nothing, the insurrection is snuffed.","Moreover, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to the distinctions already pointed out in another chapter,—there are accepted revolutions, revolutions which are called revolutions; there are refused revolutions, which are called riots.

If the people lets fall a black ball, the idea is dried fruit; the insurrection is a mere skirmish.","Still, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to the distinctions already indicated in another chapter, there are accepted insurrections which are called revolutions; there are rejected revolutions which are called émeutes.

"On comprend aussi que cette grille, si obligeamment ouverte devant Jean Valjean, était une habileté de Thénardier. Thénardier sentait Javert toujours là ; l’homme guetté a un flair qui ne le trompe pas ; il fallait jeter un os à ce limier. Un assassin, quelle aubaine ! C’était la part du feu, qu’il ne faut jamais refuser. Thénardier, en mettant dehors Jean Valjean à sa place, donnait une proie à la police, lui faisait lâcher sa piste, se faisait oublier dans une plus grosse aventure, récompensait Javert de son attente, ce qui flatte toujours un espion, gagnait trente francs, et comptait bien, quant à lui, s’échapper à l’aide de cette diversion.","We also understand that this gate, so obligingly opened in front of Jean Valjean, was a skill of Thénardier. Thénardier felt Javert still there; the man watched has a flair that does not deceive him; it was necessary to throw a bone to this bloodhound. An assassin, what a godsend! It was the share of the fire, which must never be refused. Thénardier, by putting Jean Valjean out in his place, gave a prey to the police, made him let go of his trail, made himself forgotten in a bigger adventure, rewarded Javert for his waiting, which always flatters a spy, earned thirty francs, and counted, as for him, to escape by means of this diversion.","And, of course, that grating so obligingly opened for Jean Valjean was an act of cunning on Thénardier’s part. Thénardier sensed that Javert was still there. The marked man has an instinct that never deceives him. Some bone had to be thrown to that sleuth-hound. A murderer, what a godsend! It was the sacrifice that had to be made. By sending Jean Valjean outside in his stead, Thénardier gave the police another quarry, made them leave off pursuing him, saw to it that he was forgotten about in a bigger operation, repaid Javert for his waiting – which always flatters a spy – earned himself thirty francs, and could count on making his own escape with the help of this diversion.","Thus it will be easily understood that that grating, so obligingly opened to Jean Valjean, was a bit of cleverness on Thénardier’s part. Thénardier intuitively felt that Javert was still there; the man spied upon has a scent which never deceives him; it was necessary to fling a bone to that sleuth-hound. An assassin, what a godsend! Such an opportunity must never be allowed to slip. Thénardier, by putting Jean Valjean outside in his stead, provided a prey for the police, forced them to relinquish his scent, made them forget him in a bigger adventure, repaid Javert for his waiting, which always flatters a spy, earned thirty francs, and counted with certainty, so far as he himself was concerned, on escaping with the aid of this diversion.","It is understood also that the opening of that grating so obligingly before Jean Valjean was a piece of shrewdness on the part of Thénardier. Thénardier felt that Javert was still there; the man who is watched has a scent which does not deceive him; a bone must be thrown to this hound. An assassin, what a godsend! It was the scapegoat, which must never be refused. Thénardier, by putting Jean Valjean out in his place, gave a victim to the police, threw them off his own track, caused himself to be forgotten in a larger matter, rewarded Javert for his delay, which always flatters a spy, gained thirty francs, and counted surely, as for himself, upon escaping by the aid of this diversion."
"Javert n’était pas facile à étonner. Cependant, tout maître qu’il était de lui, il ne put se soustraire à une commotion. Il resta béant et immobile.","Javert was not easily surprised. However, master as he was of himself, he could not escape a commotion. He remained gaping and motionless.","Javert was not easily surprised. But for all his self-control, he could not help giving a start. He remained dumbfounded and motionless.","Javert was not easily astonished. Still, master of himself though he was, he could not repress a start. He remained open-mouthed and motionless.","Javert was not easily astonished. Still, complete master as he was of himself, he could not escape an emotion. He stood aghast and motionless."

"Le lecteur a compris qu’Éponine, ayant reconnu à travers la grille l’habitante de cette rue Plumet où Magnon l’avait envoyée, avait commencé par écarter les bandits de la rue Plumet, puis y avait conduit Marius, et qu’après plusieurs jours d’extase devant cette grille, Marius, entraîné par cette force qui pousse le fer vers l’aimant et l’amoureux vers les pierres dont est faite la maison de celle qu’il aime, avait fini par entrer dans le jardin de Cosette comme Roméo dans le jardin de Juliette. Cela même lui avait été plus facile qu’à Roméo ; Roméo était obligé d’escalader un mur, Marius n’eut qu’à forcer un peu un des barreaux de la grille décrépite qui vacillait dans son alvéole rouillée, à la manière des dents des vieilles gens. Marius était mince et passa aisément.","The reader has understood that Éponine, having recognized through the gate the inhabitant of this rue Plumet where Magnon had sent her, had started by warding off the bandits from the rue Plumet, then had led Marius there, and that after several days of ecstasy in front of this gate, Marius, drawn by this force which pushes the iron towards the magnet and the lover towards the stones of which the house of the one he loves is made, had ended up entering the garden of Cosette like Romeo in Juliet's garden. Even that had been easier for him than for Romeo; Romeo was obliged to climb a wall, Marius had only to force a little one of the bars of the decrepit gate which wobbled in its rusty cell, like the teeth of old people. Marius was thin and passed easily.","It must be clear to the reader that Éponine, having recognized through the railing the girl who was living at that address on Rue Plumet where Magnon had sent her, had firstly warded off the villains from Rue Plumet and then taken Marius there; and after several days’ ecstasy in front of that railing, impelled by that force that draws the iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which his beloved’s house is built, Marius had finally entered Cosette’s garden as Romeo entered Juliet’s garden. This was even easier for him than for Romeo. Romeo had to scale a wall, Marius had just slightly to force one of the rickety railings that wobbled in its rusty socket the way old people’s teeth do. Marius was slim, and slipped through easily.","The reader has probably understood that Éponine, having recognized through the gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither Magnon had sent her, had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the Rue Plumet, and had then conducted Marius thither, and that, after many days spent in ecstasy before that gate, Marius, drawn on by that force which draws the iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built the house of her whom he loves, had finally entered Cosette’s garden as Romeo entered the garden of Juliet. This had even proved easier for him than for Romeo; Romeo was obliged to scale a wall, Marius had only to use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which vacillated in its rusty recess, after the fashion of old people’s teeth. Marius was slender and readily passed through.","THE READER HAS UNDERSTOOD that Eponine, having recognised through the grating the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet, to which Magnon had sent her, had begun by diverting the bandits from the Rue Plumet, had then conducted Marius thither, and that after several days of ecstasy before that grating, Marius, drawn by that force which pushes the iron towards the magnet and the lover towards the stones of which the house of her whom he loves is built, had finally entered Cosette’s garden as Romeo did the garden of Juliet. It had even been easier for him than for Romeo; Romeo was obliged to scale a wall, Marius had only to push aside a little one of the bars of the decrepit grating, which was loosened in its rusty socket, like the teeth of old people. Marius was slender, and easily passed through."

"Sur l’avis de la vedette qui avait observé la région des halles, Enjolras, de peur d’une surprise par derrière, prit une résolution grave.

"De circuit en circuit, il arriva dans une ruelle qu’il jugea être la rue de la Poterie ; vers le milieu de cette ruelle il se heurta à un obstacle. Il étendit les mains. C’était une charrette renversée ; son pied reconnut des flaques d’eau, des fondrières, des pavés épars et amoncelés. Il y avait là une barricade ébauchée et abandonnée. Il escalada les pavés et se trouva de l’autre côté du barrage. Il marchait très près des bornes et se guidait sur le mur des maisons. Un peu au delà de la barricade, il lui sembla entrevoir devant lui quelque chose de blanc. Il approcha, cela prit une forme. C’étaient deux chevaux blancs ; les chevaux de l’omnibus dételé le matin par Bossuet, qui avaient erré au hasard de rue en rue toute la journée et avaient fini par s’arrêter là, avec cette patience accablée des brutes qui ne comprennent pas plus les actions de l’homme que l’homme ne comprend les actions de la providence.","From circuit to circuit, he arrived in an alley which he judged to be the rue de la Poterie; towards the middle of this alley he ran into an obstacle. He stretched out his hands. It was an overturned cart; his foot recognized puddles, potholes, scattered and heaped cobblestones. There was a rough-hewn and abandoned barricade there. He scaled the cobblestones and found himself on the other side of the dam. He walked very close to the bollards and was guided by the wall of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, he thought he saw something white in front of him. He approached, it took on a form. They were two white horses; the horses of the omnibus unhitched in the morning by Bossuet, who had wandered haphazardly from street to street all day and had ended up stopping there, with that overwhelmed patience of brutes who no longer understand the actions of man that man does not understand the actions of providence.","Circling this way and that, he came to a little lane that he thought was Rue de la Poterie.

There was a skeleton barricade here that had been abandoned. He climbed over the cobblestones and found himself on the other side of the road block. He made his way along, keeping close to the kerb-posts, guiding himself by the walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade he thought he discerned something white in front of him. He drew nearer, it took on a shape. It was two white horses, the omnibus horses unhitched that morning by Bossuet.

"― L’amour, c’est bien ; mais il faut cela avec. Il faut de l’inutile dans le bonheur. Le bonheur, ce n’est que le nécessaire. Assaisonnez-le-moi énormément de superflu. Un palais et son cœur. Son cœur et le Louvre. Son cœur et les grandes eaux de Versailles. Donnez-moi ma bergère, et tâchez qu’elle soit duchesse. Amenez-moi Philis couronnée de bleuets et ajoutez-lui cent mille livres de rente. Ouvrez-moi une bucolique à perte de vue sous une colonnade de marbre. Je consens à la bucolique et aussi à la féerie de marbre et d’or. Le bonheur sec ressemble au pain sec. On mange, mais on ne dîne pas. Je veux du superflu, de l’inutile, de l’extravagant, du trop, de ce qui ne sert à rien. Je me souviens d’avoir vu dans la cathédrale de Strasbourg une horloge haute comme une maison à trois étages qui marquait l’heure, qui avait la bonté de marquer l’heure, mais qui n’avait pas l’air faite pour cela ; et qui, après avoir sonné midi ou minuit, midi, l’heure du soleil, minuit, l’heure de l’amour, ou toute autre heure qu’il vous plaira, vous donnait la lune et les étoiles, la terre et la mer, les oiseaux et les poissons, Phébus et Phébé, et une ribambelle de choses qui sortaient d’une niche, et les douze apôtres, et l’empereur Charles-Quint, et Éponine et Sabinus, et un tas de petits bonshommes dorés qui jouaient de la trompette, par-dessus le marché. Sans compter de ravissants carillons qu’elle éparpillait dans l’air à tout propos sans qu’on sût pourquoi. Un méchant cadran tout nu qui ne dit que les heures vaut-il cela ? Moi je suis de l’avis de la grosse horloge de Strasbourg, et je la préfère au coucou de la Forêt-Noire.","“Love is good; but it takes that with it. Happiness must be useless. Happiness is only what is necessary. Season it for me with plenty of superfluity. A palace and its heart. His heart and the Louvre. Its heart and the great waters of Versailles.

Open to me a bucolic as far as the eye can see under a marble colonnade. I consent to the bucolic and also to the magic of marble and gold. Dry happiness is like dry bread. We eat, but we don't dine. I want the superfluous, the useless, the extravagant, the excessive, the useless. I remember having seen in the cathedral of Strasbourg a tall clock like a three-storied house which marked the hour, which had the kindness to mark the hour, but which did not seem made for that; and which, after striking noon or midnight, noon, the hour of the sun, midnight, the hour of love, or any other hour you please, gave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, the birds and the fish, Phoebus and Phoebe, and a string of things coming out of a niche, and the twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles V, and Éponine and Sabinus, and a heap of little golden played the trumpet, to boot. Not to mention the lovely chimes that she scattered in the air at all times without anyone knowing why. Is a nasty bare dial that only says the hours worth that?

You must have the unnecessary as well as happiness. Happiness is just the essential. Season it generously with the superfluous. A palace and her heart. Her heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the great water features of Versailles. Give me my shepherdess, and have her be a duchess. Bring me Phyllis crowned with cornflowers, and allow her an income of a hundred thousand francs. Unfold for me beneath a marble colonnade an endless prospect of the pastoral. I accept the pastoral along with the magic of marble and gold. Happiness on its own is like dry bread. You eat, but you don’t dine. I want the superfluous, the unnecessary, the extravagant, the exorbitant, that which is of no use. I remember seeing in Strasbourg Cathedral a clock as tall as a three-storey house that struck the hours – that had the goodness to strike the hours but did not look as if that was what it was made for. And having struck midday or midnight – midday, the hour of the sun, midnight, the hour of love – or any other hour you like, it gave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, birds and fishes, Phoebus and Phoebe, and a whole procession of things that came out of a niche, and the twelve Apostles, and the emperor Charles the Fifth, and Eponina and Sabinus, and loads of little gilded men, playing the trumpet into the bargain. Not to mention the enchanting chimes it kept scattering into the air at all moments, no one knew why. Can a plain, ugly dial that merely tells the time equal that? I personally go for Strasbourg’s great clock, and I like it better than the Black Forest cuckoo clock.’","“Love is all very well; but there must be something else to go with it. The useless must be mingled with happiness. Happiness is only the necessary. Season that enormously with the superfluous for me. A palace and her heart. Her heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grand waterworks of Versailles. Give me my shepherdess and try to make her a duchess. Fetch me Phyllis crowned with corn-flowers, and add a hundred thousand francs income. Open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you can see, beneath a marble colonnade. I consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold. Dry happiness resembles dry bread. One eats, but one does not dine. I want the superfluous, the useless, the extravagant, excess, that which serves no purpose. I remember to have seen, in the Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, as tall as a three-story house which marked the hours, which had the kindness to indicate the hour, but which had not the air of being made for that; and which, after having struck midday, or midnight,—midday, the hour of the sun, or midnight, the hour of love,—or any other hour that you like, gave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, birds and fishes, Phœbus and Phœbe, and a host of things which emerged from a niche, and the twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and Éponine, and Sabinus, and a throng of little gilded goodmen, who played on the trumpet to boot. Without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through the air, on every occasion, without any one’s knowing why. Is a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal to that? For my part, I am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg, and I prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the Black Forest.”","“Love, all very well; but it needs that with it. The useless is needed in happiness. Happiness is only the essential. Season it for me enormously with the superfluous. A palace and her heart. Her heart and the Louvre.

"Le printemps à Paris est assez souvent traversé par des bises aigres et dures dont on est, non pas précisément glacé, mais gelé ; ces bises qui attristent les plus belles journées, font exactement l’effet de ces souffles d’air froid qui entrent dans une chambre chaude par les fentes d’une fenêtre ou d’une porte mal fermée. Il semble que la sombre porte de l’hiver soit restée entrebâillée et qu’il vienne du vent par là. Au printemps de 1832, époque où éclata la première grande épidémie de ce siècle en Europe, ces bises étaient plus âpres et plus poignantes que jamais. C’était une porte plus glaciale encore que celle de l’hiver qui était entr’ouverte. C’était la porte du sépulcre. On sentait dans ces bises le souffle du choléra.","Spring in Paris is quite often traversed by bitter, hard winds which freeze one, not exactly, but icy; these kisses which sadden the most beautiful days, have exactly the effect of these breaths of cold air which enter a warm room through the slits of a window or a badly closed door.

He is condemned to this terrible long, infallible, implacable funeral, impossible to delay or hasten, which lasts for hours, which never ends, which takes you up, free and in full health, which drags you by the feet, which, with each effort you attempt, with each clamor you push, drags you a little lower, which seems to punish you for your resistance by a redoubled embrace, which slowly brings the man back into the earth, giving him plenty of time to look at the horizon, the trees, the green countryside, the smoke from the villages in the plain, the sails of the ships on the sea, the birds flying and singing, the sun, the sky. The enlizement is the sepulcher which becomes a tide and which rises from the bottom of the earth towards a living being. Every minute is an inexorable buryer.

There he is in the sand up to his belly; the sand reaches the chest, it is no more than a bust. He raises his hands, lets out furious moans, clenches his nails on the shore, wants to hold on to this ash, leans on his elbows to tear himself away from this soft sheath, sobs frantically; the sand rises. The sand reaches the shoulders, the sand reaches the neck; the face alone is visible now. The mouth cries out, the sand fills it; silence. The eyes still look, the sand closes them; night.

The sand reaches his shoulders, the sand reaches his throat, only his face is visible now. His mouth cries out, the sand fills it. Silence. His eyes are still staring, the sand closes them. Night. Then his forehead narrows, a tuft of hair quivers above the sand; a hand emerges, breaks through the surface, flaps and flutters, and disappears. Dreadful obliteration of a man.","He shouts, he waves his hat, or his handkerchief, the sand continually gains on him; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far away, if the bank of sand is too ill-famed, there is no hero in the neighborhood, all is over, he is condemned to be engulfed. He is condemned to that terrible interment, long, infallible, implacable, which it is impossible to either retard or hasten, which lasts for hours, which will not come to an end, which seizes you erect, free, in the flush of health, which drags you down by the feet, which, at every effort that you attempt, at every shout that you utter, draws you a little lower, which has the air of punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp, which forces a man to return slowly to earth, while leaving him time to survey the horizon, the trees, the verdant country, the smoke of the villages on the plain, the sails of the ships on the sea, the birds which fly and sing, the sun and the sky. This engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide, and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man. Each minute is an inexorable layer-out of the dead.

Behold him in the sand up to his belly, the sand reaches to his breast, he is only a bust now. He uplifts his hands, utters furious groans, clenches his nails on the beach, tries to cling fast to that ashes, supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath, and sobs frantically; the sand mounts higher. The sand has reached his shoulders, the sand reaches to his throat; only his face is visible now. His mouth cries aloud , the sand fills it; silence. His eyes still gaze forth, the sand closes them, night. Then his brow decreases, a little hair quivers above the sand; a hand projects, pierces the surface of the beach, waves and disappears. Sinister obliteration of a man.","He calls, he waves his hat or his handkerchief, the sand gains on him more and more; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far off, if the sandbank is of too ill-repute, if there is no hero in sight, it is all over, he is condemned to enlizement. He is condemned to that appalling interment, long, infallible, implacable, impossible to slacken or to hasten, which endures for hours, which will not end, which seizes you erect, free and in full health, which draws you by the feet, which, at every effort that you attempt, at every shout that you utter, drags you a little deeper, which appears to punish you for your resistance by a redoubling of its grasp, which sinks the man slowly into the earth while it leaves him all the time to look at the horizon, the trees, the green fields, the smoke of the villages in the plain, the sails of the ships upon the sea, the birds flying and singing, the sunshine, the sky. Enlizement is the grave become a tide and rising from the depths of the earth towards a living man. Each minute is an inexorable enshroudress. The victim attempts to sit down, to lie down, to creep; every movement he makes, inters him; he straightens up, he sinks in; he feels that he is being swallowed up; he howls, implores, cries to the clouds, wrings his hands, despairs. Behold him waist deep in the sand; the sand reaches his breast, he is now only a bust. He raises his arms, utters furious groans, clutches the beach with his nails, would hold by that straw, leans upon his elbows to pull himself out of this soft sheath, sobs frenziedly; the sand rises. The sand reaches his shoulders, the sand reaches his neck; the face alone is visible now. The mouth cries, the sand fills it; silence. The eyes still gaze, the sand shuts them; night. Then the forehead decreases, a little hair flutters above the sand; a hand protrudes, comes through the surface of the beach, moves and shakes, and disappears. Sinister effacement of a man."

"L’argot étant l’idiome de la corruption, se corrompt vite. En outre, comme il cherche toujours à se dérober, sitôt qu’il se sent compris, il se transforme. Au rebours de toute autre végétation, tout rayon de jour y tue ce qu’il touche. Aussi l’argot va-t-il se décomposant et se recomposant sans cesse ; travail obscur et rapide qui ne s’arrête jamais. Il fait plus de chemin en dix ans que la langue en dix siècles. Ainsi le larton* devient le lartif ; le gail** devient le gaye ; la fertanche***, la fertille ; le momignard, le momacque ; les siques****, les frusques ; la chique*****, l’égrugeoir ; le colabre******, le colas. Le diable est d’abord gahisto, puis le rabouin, puis le boulanger ; le prêtre est le ratichon, puis le sanglier ; le poignard est le vingt-deux, puis le surin, puis le lingre ; les gens de police sont des railles, puis des roussins, puis des rousses, puis des marchands de lacets, puis des coqueurs, puis des cognes ; le bourreau est le taule, puis Charlot, puis l’atigeur, puis le becquillard. Au dix-septième siècle, se battre, c’était se donner du tabac ; au dix-neuvième, c’est se chiquer la gueule. Vingt locutions différentes ont passé entre ces deux extrêmes. Cartouche parlerait hébreu pour Lacenaire. Tous les mots de cette langue sont perpétuellement en fuite comme les hommes qui les prononcent.","Slang, being the idiom of corruption, quickly becomes corrupted. Moreover, as he always tries to escape, as soon as he feels understood, he is transformed. Unlike any other vegetation, any ray of daylight kills what it touches. So slang goes on decomposing and recomposing itself ceaselessly; dark and fast work that never stops. It makes more progress in ten years than the language in ten centuries. Thus the larton* becomes the lartif; the gail** becomes the gaye; the fertanche***, the fertile; the momignard, the momacque; the siques****, the togs; the quid*****, the égrégeoir; the colabre******, the cola.

Moreover, since it is always trying to dissimulate, as soon as it gets the feeling it can be understood, it changes. Unlike any other vegetation, contact with a ray of light kills it.

Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon as it feels that it is understood, it changes its form. Contrary to what happens with every other vegetation, every ray of light which falls upon it kills whatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant process of decomposition and recomposition; an obscure and rapid work which never pauses. It passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten centuries. Thus le larton (bread) becomes le lartif; le gail (horse) becomes le gaye; la fertanche (straw) becomes la fertille; le momignard (brat), le momacque; les fiques (duds), frusques; la chique (the church), l’égrugeoir; le colabre (neck), le colas.

"Il réalisait, dans toute son énergie, la vieille métaphore : ivre mort. Le hideux philtre absinthe-stout-alcool l’avait jeté en léthargie. Sa table étant petite, et ne pouvant servir à la barricade, on la lui avait laissée. Il était toujours dans la même posture, la poitrine pliée sur la table, la tête appuyée à plat sur les bras, entouré de verres, de chopes et de bouteilles. Il dormait de cet écrasant sommeil de l’ours engourdi et de la sangsue repue. Rien n’y avait fait, ni la fusillade, ni les boulets, ni la mitraille qui pénétrait par la croisée dans la salle où il était, ni le prodigieux vacarme de l’assaut. Seulement, il répondait quelquefois au canon par un ronflement. Il semblait attendre là qu’une balle vînt lui épargner la peine de se réveiller. Plusieurs cadavres gisaient autour de lui ; et, au premier coup d’œil, rien ne le distinguait de ces dormeurs profonds de la mort.","He was realizing, with all his energy, the old metaphor: dead drunk.

He was still in the same posture, his chest bent on the table, his head resting flat on his arms, surrounded by glasses, mugs and bottles. He slept that crushing sleep of the numbed bear and the satiated leech. Nothing had helped, neither the fusillade, nor the cannonballs, nor the grapeshot which entered through the window into the room where he was, nor the prodigious uproar of the assault. Only he sometimes answered the cannon with a snore. He seemed to be waiting there for a bullet to come to spare him the trouble of waking up. Several corpses lay around him; and, at first glance, nothing distinguished him from those deep sleepers of death.","He embodied with every fibre of his being the old metaphor ‘dead drunk’.

"Quand, à l’issue de toutes les cérémonies, après avoir prononcé devant le maire et devant le prêtre tous les oui possibles, après avoir signé sur les registres à la municipalité et à la sacristie, après avoir échangé leurs anneaux, après avoir été à genoux coude à coude sous le poêle de moire blanche dans la fumée de l’encensoir, ils arrivèrent se tenant par la main, admirés et enviés de tous, Marius en noir, elle en blanc, précédés du suisse à épaulettes de colonel frappant les dalles de sa hallebarde, entre deux haies d’assistants émerveillés, sous le portail de l’église ouvert à deux battants, prêts à remonter en voiture et tout étant fini, Cosette ne pouvait encore y croire. Elle regardait Marius, elle regardait la foule, elle regardait le ciel ; il semblait qu’elle eût peur de se réveiller. Son air étonné et inquiet lui ajoutait on ne sait quoi d’enchanteur. Pour s’en retourner, ils montèrent ensemble dans la même voiture, Marius près de Cosette ; M. Gillenormand et Jean Valjean leur faisaient vis-à-vis. La tante Gillenormand avait reculé d’un plan, et était dans la seconde voiture. ― Mes enfants, disait le grand-père, vous voilà monsieur le baron et madame la baronne avec trente mille livres de rente.

She looked at Marius, she looked at the crowd, she looked at the sky; it seemed that she was afraid to wake up. His astonished and worried look added something enchanting to him.

Aunt Gillenormand had taken a step back and was in the second carriage. “My children,” said the grandfather, “there you are, Monsieur le Baron and Madame la Baronne, with an income of thirty thousand francs.

She looked at Marius, she looked at the crowd, she looked at the sky: it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream. Her amazed and uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty. They entered the same carriage to return home, Marius beside Cosette; M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean sat opposite them; Aunt Gillenormand had withdrawn one degree, and was in the second vehicle. “My children,” said the grandfather, “here you are, Monsieur le Baron and Madame la Baronne, with an income of thirty thousand livres.” And Cosette, nestling close to Marius, caressed his ear with an angelic whisper: “So it is true.

She looked at Marius, she looked at the throng , she looked at the sky; it seemed as if she were afraid of awaking. Her astonished and bewildered air rendered her unspeakably bewitching. To return, they got into the same carriage, Marius by Cosette’s side; M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean sat opposite. Aunt Gillenormand had drawn back one degree, and was in the second carriage. “My children,” said the grandfather, “here you are Monsieur the Baron and Madame the Baroness, with thirty thousand francs a year.” And Cosette, leaning close up to Marius, caressed his ear with this angelic whisper: “It is true, then.

Du tesson elle conclut l’amphore, ou la cruche. Elle reconnaît à une empreinte d’ongle sur un parchemin la différence qui sépare la juiverie de la Judengasse de la juiverie du Ghetto. Elle retrouve dans ce qui reste ce qui a été, le bien, le mal, le faux, le vrai, la tache de sang du palais, le pâté d’encre de la caverne, la goutte de suif du lupanar, les épreuves subies, les tentations bien venues, les orgies vomies, le pli qu’ont fait les caractères en s’abaissant, la trace de la prostitution dans les âmes que leur grossièreté en faisait capables, et sur la veste des portefaix de Rome la marque du coup de coude de Messaline.","The social observer must step into these shadows.

With fingers accustomed to painting the delicate ribs of fans, Feuilly buttressed the barrels and the cart with two massive heaps of rubble. Rubble improvised like everything else and taken from who knows where. Support beams were torn from a neighbouring house front and laid on the casks. When Bossuet and Courfeyrac turned round, half the street was already blocked with a rampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the common people for building anew out of what has been demolished.","In the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars had been wrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of street had been unpaved; Gavroche and Bahorel had seized in its passage, and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; this dray contained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the piles of paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the widow Hucheloup’s empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime; Feuilly, with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans, had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one knows where. The beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet and Courfeyrac turned round, half the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing.","Meanwhile, in a few minutes, twenty iron bars had been wrested from the grated front of the wine-shop, twenty yards of pavement had been torn up, Gavroche and Bahorel had seized on its passage and tipped over the dray of a lime merchant named Anceau, this dray contained three barrels full of lime, which they had placed under the piles of paving stones; Enjolras had opened the trap-door of the cellar and all the widow Hucheloup’s empty casks had gone to flank the lime barrels; Feuilly, with his fingers accustomed to colour the delicate folds of fans, had buttressed the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of stones.

"Qu’on se rappelle cette situation de cœur que nous avons indiquée déjà. Aucun mariage n’était possible entre eux ; pas même celui des âmes ; et cependant il est certain que leurs destinées s’étaient épousées. Excepté Cosette, c’est-à-dire excepté une enfance, Jean Valjean n’avait, dans toute sa longue vie, rien connu de ce qu’on peut aimer. Les passions et les amours qui se succèdent n’avaient point fait en lui de ces verts successifs, vert tendre sur vert sombre, qu’on remarque sur les feuillages qui passent l’hiver et sur les hommes qui passent la cinquantaine. En somme, et nous y avons plus d’une fois insisté, toute cette fusion intérieure, tout cet ensemble, dont la résultante était une haute vertu, aboutissait à faire de Jean Valjean un père pour Cosette. Père étrange forgé de l’aïeul, du fils, du frère et du mari qu’il y avait dans Jean Valjean ; père dans lequel il y avait même une mère ; père qui aimait Cosette et qui l’adorait, et qui avait cette enfant pour lumière, pour demeure, pour famille, pour patrie, pour paradis.","Let us remember this situation of the heart which we have already indicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that of souls; and yet it is certain that their destinies were married. Except Cosette, that is to say except a childhood, Jean Valjean had, throughout his long life, known nothing of what one can love. The successive passions and loves had not produced in him those successive greens, soft green on dark green, which one notices on the foliage which passes the winter and on men who pass fifty. In short, and we have insisted on this more than once, all this interior fusion, all this union, the result of which was a high virtue, ended in making Jean Valjean a father for Cosette. Strange father forged from the grandfather, the son, the brother and the husband that there was in Jean Valjean; father in which there was even a mother; father who loved Cosette and who adored her, and who had this child for light, for home, for family, for fatherland, for paradise.","Remember, we have already commented on this state of the heart. No marriage was possible between them, not even that of souls. And yet it is unquestionable that their destinies were wedded to each other. Apart from Cosette, that is to say, apart from the duration of her childhood, throughout his long life Jean Valjean had known nothing of what love might be. No series of passions or affections had produced in him those successive greens, tender green on dark, that can be seen in foliage that lasts through winter and in men who last into their fifties. In short, and we have dwelt on this more than once, all taken together, this whole inner complexity, resulting in great virtuousness, made of Jean Valjean in the end a father for Cosette. A strange father, forged out of the grandfather, the son, the brother and the husband contained in Jean Valjean. A father in whom there was even a mother. A father who loved Cosette, who adored her, and for whom that child was light, home, family, country, paradise.","Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that of souls; and yet, it is certain that their destinies were wedded. With the exception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception of a childhood, Jean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long life, known anything of that which may be loved. The passions and loves which succeed each other had not produced in him those successive green growths, tender green or dark green, which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty. In short, and we have insisted on it more than once, all this interior fusion, all this whole, of which the sum total was a lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean a father to Cosette. A strange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, the brother, and the husband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whom there was included even a mother; a father who loved Cosette and adored her, and who held that child as his light, his home, his family, his country, his paradise.","Remember that condition of heart which we have already pointed out. No marriage was possible between them, not even that of souls; and still it was certain that their destinies were espoused. Except Cosette, that is to say, except a childhood, Jean Valjean, in all his long life, had known nothing of those objects which man can love. The passions and the loves which succeed one another, had not left on him those successive greens, a light green over a dark green, which we notice upon leaves that pass the winter, and upon men who pass their fifty years. In short, and we have more than once insisted upon it, all that interior fusion, all that whole, the resultant of which was a lofty virtue, ended in making of Jean Valjean a father for Cosette. A strange father forged out of the grandfather, the son, the brother, and the husband, which there was in Jean Valjean; a father in whom there was even a mother; a father who loved Cosette, and who adored her, and to whom that child was light, was home, was family, was country, was paradise."

Cosette, il est allé à la barricade pour me sauver. Comme c’est son besoin d’être un ange, en passant, il en a sauvé d’autres ; il a sauvé Javert. Il m’a tiré de ce gouffre pour me donner à toi. Il m’a porté sur son dos dans cet effroyable égout. Ah ! je suis un monstrueux ingrat. Cosette, après avoir été ta providence, il a été la mienne. Figure-toi qu’il y avait une fondrière épouvantable, à s’y noyer cent fois, à se noyer dans la boue, Cosette ! il me l’a fait traverser. J’étais évanoui ; je ne voyais rien, je n’entendais rien, je ne pouvais rien savoir de ma propre aventure.

Cosette, your father more than ever. Cosette, I guess. You told me that you never received the letter I sent you from Gavroche. It will have fallen into his hands. Cosette, he went to the barricade to save me. As is his need to be an angel, by the way, he saved others; he saved Javert. He pulled me from this abyss to give me to you. He carried me on his back into that dreadful sewer. Ah! I am a monstrous ingrate. Cosette, after having been your providence, he was mine. Imagine that there was a dreadful quagmire in which to drown a hundred times, to drown in the mud, Cosette! he took me through it.

"Le jour où leurs yeux se rencontrèrent et se dirent enfin brusquement ces premières choses obscures et ineffables que le regard balbutie, Cosette ne comprit pas d’abord. Elle rentra pensive à la maison de la rue de l’Ouest où Jean Valjean, selon son habitude, était venu passer six semaines. Le lendemain, en s’éveillant, elle songea à ce jeune homme inconnu, si longtemps indifférent et glacé, qui semblait maintenant faire attention à elle, et il ne lui sembla pas le moins du monde que cette attention lui fût agréable. Elle avait plutôt un peu de colère contre ce beau dédaigneux. Un fond de guerre remua en elle. Il lui sembla, et elle en éprouvait une joie encore tout enfantine, qu’elle allait enfin se venger.","The day when their eyes met and at last said abruptly to each other those first obscure and ineffable things that the gaze stammers, Cosette did not at first understand. She returned pensive to the house in the rue de l'Ouest where Jean Valjean, as usual, had come to spend six weeks. The next day, when she awoke, she thought of this unknown young man, so long indifferent and frozen, who now seemed to pay attention to her, and it did not seem to her in the least that this attention pleased her. She had rather a little anger towards this dismissive handsome. A background of war stirred within her. It seemed to her, and she still experienced a childish joy, that she was finally going to get her revenge.","The day when their eyes met and at last suddenly conveyed to each other those first obscure and ineffable things that glances impart falteringly, Cosette did not immediately understand.

On waking the next morning she thought of that strange young man, for so long cool and indifferent, who now seemed to be paying attention to her, and it did not seem to her in the least that this attention was welcome. On the contrary, she was a little cross with this disdainful Apollo. An underlying hostility stirred within her. She sensed, and this gave her a wholly childish joy, that she was at last to have her revenge.","On the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other those first, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, Cosette did not immediately understand.

"Elle se remit à contempler le cahier. Il était écrit d’une écriture ravissante, pensa Cosette ; de la même main, mais avec des encres diverses, tantôt très noires, tantôt blanchâtres, comme lorsqu’on met de l’encre dans l’encrier, et par conséquent à des jours différents. C’était donc une pensée qui s’était épanchée là, soupir à soupir, irrégulièrement, sans ordre, sans choix, sans but, au hasard. Cosette n’avait jamais rien lu de pareil. Ce manuscrit, où elle voyait plus de clarté encore que d’obscurité, lui faisait l’effet d’un sanctuaire entr’ouvert. Chacune de ces lignes mystérieuses resplendissait à ses yeux et lui inondait le cœur d’une lumière étrange. L’éducation qu’elle avait reçue lui avait parlé toujours de l’âme et jamais de l’amour, à peu près comme qui parlerait du tison et point de la flamme. Ce manuscrit de quinze pages lui révélait brusquement et doucement tout l’amour, la douleur, la destinée, la vie, l’éternité, le commencement, la fin. C’était comme une main qui se serait ouverte et lui aurait jeté subitement une poignée de rayons. Elle sentait dans ces quelques lignes une nature passionnée, ardente, généreuse, honnête, une volonté sacrée, une immense douleur et un espoir immense, un cœur serré, une extase épanouie. Qu’était-ce que ce manuscrit ? Une lettre. Lettre sans adresse, sans nom, sans date, sans signature, pressante et désintéressée, énigme composée de vérités, message d’amour fait pour être apporté par un ange et lu par une vierge, rendez-vous donné hors de la terre, billet doux d’un fantôme à une ombre. C’était un absent tranquille et accablé qui semblait prêt à se réfugier dans la mort et qui envoyait à l’absente le secret de la destinée, la clef de la vie, l’amour. Cela avait été écrit le pied dans le tombeau et le doigt dans le ciel. Ces lignes, tombées une à une sur le papier, étaient ce qu’on pourrait appeler des gouttes d’âme.","She went back to looking at the notebook. It was written in a ravishing hand, thought Cosette; by the same hand, but with various inks, sometimes very black, sometimes whitish, as when putting ink in the inkwell, and consequently on different days. So it was a thought that had poured out there, sigh after sigh, irregularly, without order, without choice, without goal, at random. Cosette had never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she saw even more light than darkness, produced on her the effect of a half-open sanctuary. Each of these mysterious lines shone in his eyes and flooded his heart with a strange light. The education she had received had always spoken to her of the soul and never of love, almost as one would speak of the ember and not of the flame. This fifteen-page manuscript suddenly and gently revealed to him all of love, pain, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning, the end. It was like a hand opening up and suddenly throwing a handful of rays at him. She felt in these few lines a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an immense pain and an immense hope, a tight heart, a fulfilled ecstasy. What was this manuscript? A letter. Letter without address, without name, without date, without signature, urgent and disinterested, enigma composed of truths, message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin, appointment given outside the earth, sweet note from a ghost to a shadow. He was a calm and overwhelmed absentee who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absentee the secret of destiny, the key to life, love. It had been written with the foot in the grave and the finger in the sky. These lines, falling one by one on the paper, were what one might call drops of soul.","She returned to studying the booklet. It was lovely handwriting, thought Cosette. All penned by the same hand, but with different inks – sometimes very black, sometimes pale as when water has been added to the inkwell – and therefore on different days. So this was a mind that had unburdened itself, sigh by sigh, irregularly, unmethodically, indiscriminately, erratically, at random. Cosette had never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she saw much more clarity than obscurity, gave her the impression of a sanctuary whose door stood ajar. Each one of these mysterious lines glowed before her eyes and bathed her heart in a strange light. The education she had received had always talked to her about the soul and never about love, rather as one might talk about the firebrand and not the flame. This fifteen-page manuscript suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all about love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning, the end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly thrown her a clutch of luminous rays. She sensed in these few lines a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, an inspired will, a boundless sorrow and a boundless hope, a heavy heart and a rapturous ecstasy. What was this manuscript? A letter. A letter without an address, without a name, without a date, without a signature, urgent and self-abnegating, an enigma composed of truths, a message of love to be delivered by an angel and read by a virgin, an out-of-this-world assignation, the love letter of a phantom to a shadow. It came from one, calm and despondent in his absence, who seemed ready to take refuge in death, sending to another, in her absence, the secret of fate, the key of life, love. This had been written with a foot in the grave and a finger in heaven. These lines, spilled on to the page one by one, were what might be called droplets from a soul.","She resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the most charming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but with divers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish, as when ink has been added to the inkstand, and consequently on different days. It was, then, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh, irregularly, without order, without choice, without object, hap-hazard. Cosette had never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she already perceived more light than obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a half-open sanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance. The education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul, and never of love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame. This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning, the end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays of light. In these few lines she felt a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an immense sorrow, and an immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy fully expanded. What was this manuscript? A letter. A letter without name, without address, without date, without signature, pressing and disinterested, an enigma composed of truths, a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin, an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the love-letter of a phantom to a shade. It was an absent one, tranquil and dejected, who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love, his lady, the secret of fate, the key of life, love. This had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven. These lines, which had fallen one by one on the paper, were what might be called drops of soul.","She began again to contemplate the letter. It was written in a ravishing handwriting, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but with different inks, sometimes very black, sometimes pale, as ink is put into the ink-stand, and consequently on different days. It was then a thought which had poured itself out there, sigh by sigh, irregularly, without order, without choice, without aim, at hazard. Cosette had never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she found still more clearness than obscurity, had the effect upon her of a half-opened sanctuary.

The education which she had received had always spoken to her of the soul and never of love, almost like one who should speak of the brand and not of the flame. This manuscript of fifteen pages revealed to her suddenly and sweetly the whole of love, the sorrow, the destiny, the life, the eternity, the beginning, the end.

What was this manuscript? a letter. A letter with no address, no name, no date, no signature, intense and disinterested, an enigma composed of truths, a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin, a rendezvous given beyond the earth, a love-letter from a phantom to a shade. He was a calm yet exhausted absent one, who seemed ready to take refuge in death, and who sent to the absent Her the secret of destiny, the key of life, love.

"A de certains moments, Jean Valjean souffrait tant qu’il devenait puéril. C’est le propre de la douleur de faire reparaître le côté enfant de l’homme. Il sentait invinciblement que Cosette lui échappait. Il eût voulu lutter, la retenir, l’enthousiasmer par quelque chose d’extérieur et d’éclatant. Ces idées, puériles, nous venons de le dire, et en même temps séniles, lui donnèrent, par leur enfantillage même, une notion assez juste de l’influence de la passementerie sur l’imagination des jeunes filles. Il lui arriva une fois de voir passer dans la rue un général à cheval en grand uniforme, le comte Coutard, commandant de Paris. Il envia cet homme doré ; il se dit quel bonheur ce serait de pouvoir mettre cet habit-là qui était une chose incontestable, que si Cosette le voyait ainsi, cela l’éblouirait, que lorsqu’il donnerait le bras à Cosette et qu’il passerait devant la grille des Tuileries, on lui présenterait les armes, et que cela suffirait à Cosette et lui ôterait l’idée de regarder les jeunes gens.","At certain moments, Jean Valjean suffered so much that he became childish. It is the nature of pain to bring out the childish side of man. He felt invincibly that Cosette was slipping away from him. He would have liked to struggle, to hold her back, to excite her with something exterior and dazzling. These ideas, childish, as we have just said, and at the same time senile, gave him, by their very childishness, a fairly accurate notion of the influence of trimmings on the imagination of young girls. Once upon a time he saw a general on horseback in full uniform, Comte Coutard, Commandant of Paris, pass in the street. He envied this golden man; he said to himself what happiness it would be to be able to put on that coat which was an indisputable thing, that if Cosette saw him thus, it would dazzle him, that when he gave his arm to Cosette and passed in front of the gate of the Tuileries, they would present arms to her, and that would be enough for Cosette and would deprive her of the idea of looking at young people.","At times Jean Valjean suffered so much he became childish. It is a characteristic of grief to bring out the child in the man. He had the unconquerable feeling that Cosette was slipping away from him. He wanted to fight back, to detain her, to win her over with something tangible and eye-catching. Such notions – childish notions, as we have just said, and at the same time typical of old age – by their very childishness gave him a fairly accurate idea of the influence of finery on young girls’ imaginations. He once happened to see a general ride past in the street, on horseback, in full dress uniform, Comte Coutard, the commander of Paris. He envied that gilded man. What an advantage it would be, he said to himself, to be able to wear that outfit, which was something that could not be ignored, and if Cosette saw him like that she would be dazzled, then he would give his arm to her and when they passed in front of the Tuileries gates the guard would present arms to him, and that would keep Cosette satisfied and she would think no more of looking at young men.","At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him. He would have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we have just said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very childishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on horseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the commandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what happiness it would be, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be dazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the Tuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice for Cosette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young men.","At certain moments, Jean Valjean suffered so much that he became puerile. It is the peculiarity of grief to bring out the childish side of man. He felt irresistibly that Cosette was escaping him. He would have been glad to put forth an effort, to hold her fast, to rouse her enthusiasm by something external and striking. These ideas, puerile, as we have just said, and at the same time senile, gave him by their very childishness a just idea of the influence of gewgaws over the imagination of young girls. He chanced once to see a general pass in the street on horseback in full uniform, Count Coutard, Commandant of Paris. He envied this gilded man, he thought what happiness it would be to be able to put on that coat which was an incontestable thing, that if Cosette saw him thus it would dazzle her, that when he should give his arm to Cosette and pass before the gate of the Tuileries they would present arms to him and that that would so satisfy Cosette that it would destroy her inclination to look at the young men."

"La barricade Saint-Antoine était monstrueuse ; elle était haute de trois étages et large de sept cents pieds. Elle barrait d’un angle à l’autre la vaste embouchure du faubourg, c’est-à-dire trois rues ; ravinée, déchiquetée, dentelée, hachée, crénelée d’une immense déchirure, contre-butée de monceaux qui étaient eux-mêmes des bastions, poussant des caps çà et là, puissamment adossée aux deux grands promontoires de maisons du faubourg, elle surgissait comme une levée cyclopéenne au fond de la redoutable place qui a vu le 14 juillet. Dix-neuf barricades s’étageaient dans la profondeur des rues derrière cette barricade mère. Rien qu’à la voir, on sentait dans le faubourg l’immense souffrance agonisante, arrivée à cette minute extrême où une détresse veut devenir une catastrophe. De quoi était faite cette barricade ? De l’écroulement de trois maisons à six étages, démolies exprès, disaient les uns. Du prodige de toutes les colères, disaient les autres. Elle avait l’aspect lamentable de toutes les constructions de la haine, la ruine. On pouvait dire : qui a bâti cela ? On pouvait dire aussi : qui a détruit cela ? C’était l’improvisation du bouillonnement. Tiens ! cette porte ! cette grille ! cet auvent ! ce chambranle ! ce réchaud brisé ! cette marmite fêlée ! Donnez tout ! jetez tout ! poussez, roulez, piochez, démantelez, bouleversez, écroulez tout ! C’était la collaboration du pavé, du moellon, de la poutre, de la barre de fer, du chiffon, du carreau défoncé, de la chaise dépaillée, du trognon de chou, de la loque, de la guenille et de la malédiction. C’était grand et c’était petit. C’était l’abîme parodié sur place par le tohu-bohu. La masse près de l’atome ; le pan de mur arraché et l’écuelle cassée ; une fraternisation menaçante de tous les débris ; Sisyphe avait jeté là son rocher et Job son tesson. En somme, terrible. C’était l’acropole des va-nu-pieds. Des charrettes renversées accidentaient le talus ; un immense haquet y était étalé, en travers, l’essieu vers le ciel, et semblait une balafre sur cette façade tumultueuse ; un omnibus, hissé gaîment à force de bras tout au sommet de l’entassement, comme si les architectes de cette sauvagerie eussent voulu ajouter la gaminerie à l’épouvante, offrait son timon dételé à on ne sait quels chevaux de l’air. Cet amas gigantesque, alluvion de l’émeute, figurait à l’esprit un Ossa sur Pélion de toutes les révolutions ; 93 sur 89, le 9 thermidor sur le 10 août, le 18 brumaire sur le 21 janvier, vendémiaire sur prairial, 1848 sur 1830. La place en valait la peine, et cette barricade était digne d’apparaître à l’endroit même où la Bastille avait disparu. Si l’océan faisait des digues, c’est ainsi qu’il les bâtirait. La furie du flot était empreinte sur cet encombrement difforme. Quel flot ? La foule. On croyait voir du vacarme pétrifié. On croyait entendre bourdonner, au-dessus de cette barricade, comme si elles eussent été là sur leur ruche, les énormes abeilles ténébreuses du progrès violent. Était-ce une broussaille ? était-ce une bacchanale ? était-ce une forteresse ? Le vertige semblait avoir construit cela à coups d’aile. Il y avait du cloaque dans cette redoute et quelque chose d’olympien dans ce fouillis. On y voyait, dans un pêle-mêle plein de désespoir, des chevrons de toits, des morceaux de mansardes avec leur papier peint, des châssis de fenêtres avec toutes leurs vitres plantés dans les décombres, attendant le canon, des cheminées descellées, des armoires, des tables, des bancs, un sens dessus dessous hurlant, et ces mille choses indigentes, rebuts même du mendiant, qui contiennent à la fois de la fureur et du néant. On eût dit que c’était le haillon d’un peuple, haillon de bois, de fer, de bronze, de pierre, et que le faubourg Saint-Antoine l’avait poussé là à sa porte d’un colossal coup de balai, faisant de sa misère sa barricade. Des blocs pareils à des billots, des chaînes disloquées, des charpentes à tasseaux ayant forme de potences, des roues horizontales sortant des décombres, amalgamaient à cet édifice de l’anarchie la sombre figure des vieux supplices soufferts par le peuple. La barricade Saint-Antoine faisait arme de tout ; tout ce que la guerre civile peut jeter à la tête de la société sortait de là ; ce n’était pas du combat, c’était du paroxysme ; les carabines qui défendaient cette redoute, parmi lesquelles il y avait quelques espingoles, envoyaient des miettes de faïence, des osselets, des boutons d’habit, jusqu’à des roulettes de tables de nuit, projectiles dangereux à cause du cuivre. Cette barricade était forcenée ; elle jetait dans les nuées une clameur inexprimable ; à de certains moments, provoquant l’armée, elle se couvrait de foule et de tempête ; une cohue de têtes flamboyantes la couronnait ; un fourmillement l’emplissait ; elle avait une crête épineuse de fusils, de sabres, de bâtons, de haches, de piques et de bayonnettes ; un vaste drapeau rouge y claquait dans le vent ; on y entendait les cris du commandement, les chansons d’attaque, des roulements de tambour, des sanglots de femme et l’éclat de rire ténébreux des meurt-de-faim. Elle était démesurée et vivante ; et, comme du dos d’une bête électrique, il en sortait un pétillement de foudres. L’esprit de révolution couvrait de son nuage ce sommet où grondait cette voix du peuple qui ressemble à la voix de Dieu ; une majesté étrange se dégageait de cette titanique hottée de gravats. C’était un tas d’ordures et c’était le Sinaï.","The Saint-Antoine barricade was monstrous; it was three stories high and seven hundred feet wide. It barred from one angle to the other the vast mouth of the faubourg, that is to say three streets; furrowed, jagged, jagged, chopped, crenellated with an immense tear, buttressed by heaps which were themselves bastions, pushing capes here and there, powerfully leaning against the two large promontories of houses in the suburb, it rose up like a cyclopean levee at the bottom of the formidable place which saw the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades ranged in the depth of the streets behind this mother barricade. Just to see her, one felt in the faubourg the immense agonizing suffering, arrived at this extreme moment when a distress wants to become a catastrophe. What was this barricade made of? About the collapse of three six-storey houses, demolished on purpose, some said. Of the prodigy of all anger, said the others. It had the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred, ruin. You could say: who built this? One could also say: who destroyed this? It was the improvisation of bubbling. Take ! this door ! this grid! that awning! this doorframe! this broken stove! this cracked pot! Give it all! throw it all away! push, roll, pick, dismantle, upset, collapse everything! It was the collaboration of the pavement, the rubble, the beam, the iron bar, the rag, the smashed tile, the ragged chair, the cabbage stalk, the rag, the rag and the curse. It was big and it was small. It was the abyss parodied on the spot by the hustle and bustle. The mass near the atom; the section of wall torn off and the bowl broken; a menacing fraternization of all the debris; Sisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job his shard. In short, awful. It was the acropolis of the barefoot. Overturned carts crashed the embankment; an immense dray was spread across it, the axle pointing skyward, and seemed like a gash on this tumultuous facade; an omnibus, gaily hoisted by force of arms to the very top of the heap, as if the architects of this savagery had wanted to add childishness to terror, offered its unhitched tiller to who knows what horses of the air. This gigantic heap, alluvium of the riot, figured in the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all the revolutions; 93 out of 89, 9 Thermidor on 10 August, 18 Brumaire on 21 January, Vendémiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. The place was worth it, and this barricade was worthy of appearing at the very spot where the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean made levees, this is how it would build them. The fury of the tide was imprinted on this deformed clutter. What flow? The crowd. We thought we were seeing a petrified din. One thought one heard humming, above this barricade, as if they had been there on their hive, the enormous dark bees of violent progress. Was it brushwood? was it a bacchanalia? was it a fortress? Vertigo seemed to have built this up with the wing strokes. There was a cesspool in this redoubt and something Olympian in this mess. We saw there, in a jumble full of despair, rafters of roofs, pieces of attics with their wallpaper, window frames with all their panes planted in the rubble, waiting for the gun, unsealed chimneys, cupboards , tables, benches, a howling upside down, and those thousand indigent things, even the beggar's scum, which contain both fury and nothingness. One would have said that it was the rag of a people, rag of wood, iron, bronze, stone, and that the Faubourg Saint-Antoine had pushed it there to its door with a colossal sweep of the broom, making his misery his barricade. Blocks resembling logs, dislocated chains, frames with battens in the form of gallows, horizontal wheels emerging from the rubble, amalgamated to this edifice of anarchy the gloomy figure of the old tortures suffered by the people. The Saint-Antoine barricade was the weapon of everything; everything that civil war can throw at the head of society came out of it; it was not combat, it was climax; the carbines which defended this redoubt, among which there were a few blunderbusses, fired crumbs of faience, bones, buttons of coats, even rollers of bedside tables, dangerous projectiles on account of the copper. This barricade was frenzied; it threw into the clouds an inexpressible clamor; at certain times, provoking the army, it was covered with crowds and storms; a crowd of flamboyant heads crowned it; a tingling filled it; it had a thorny crest of guns, sabers, clubs, axes, pikes, and bayonets; a huge red flag flapped in the wind; you could hear the shouts of command, the attack songs, drum rolls, women's sobs and the dark burst of starving laughter. She was oversized and lively; and, as from the back of an electric beast, there issued a crackle of lightning. The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of God; a strange majesty emanated from this titanic pile of rubble. It was a pile of garbage and it was Sinai.","The St-Antoine barricade was monstrous. It was three storeys high and seven hundred feet wide. Running from corner to corner, it barred the vast approach to this faubourg, that is to say, three streets. Gullied, jagged, indented, craggy, battlemented with a huge notch, buttressed with piles that were themselves bastions, throwing out headlands here and there, powerfully shored up by the two great promontories that were the district’s houses, it rose like a Cyclopean dyke at the end of the formidable square that had seen the fourteenth of July. Nineteen barricades were ranged at intervals in the streets extending behind this principal barricade. At the mere sight of it, you sensed in the faubourg the immense, agonizing suffering that had reached that ultimate moment when hardship is set to become a catastrophe. Of what was that barricade made? The destruction of three six-storey houses, purposely demolished, said some. All that stupendous anger, said others. It had the deplorable aspect of all of hatred’s edifices: ruin. You might say: Who built this? You might just as well say: Who destroyed this? It was the improvisation of ferment. Here! This door! This grating! This weatherboard! This window-frame! This broken brazier! This cracked pot! Hand it all over! Throw it all on! Push, roll, dig, dismantle, overturn, bring everything down! It was the collaboration of cobblestone, rubble-stone, wooden beam, iron bar, broken tile, bottomless chair, cabbage-stalk, rags, tags, tatters, and execration. It was huge and it was small. It was the abyss directly parodied by the chaos, the mass beside the atom, the torn-down wall and the broken pudding bowl, an ominous fraternization among all kinds of debris. Sisyphus had thrown his rock in there, and Job his pot shard. In a word, dreadful. It was the acropolis of the wretched. Overturned barrows gave the slope ruggedness. An enormous dray-cart lay across it, axle skywards, and looked like a scar on that battered façade. An omnibus, cheerfully hoisted by muscle strength alone to the very top of the pile, as though the architects of this monstrosity wanted to add to terror a gamin’s mischievousness, offered its unhitched shaft to what horses of the air no one knows. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of rioting, brought to mind the image of an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions: ’93 on ’89, the ninth of Thermidor on the tenth of August, the eighteenth of Brumaire on the twenty-first of January, Vendémiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. This site was worth the effort, and this barricade deserved to appear on the very spot where the Bastille disappeared. If the ocean made dykes, this is how it would build them. The fury of the surging torrent was imprinted on this shapeless mass. What surging torrent? The mob. You fancied you saw a petrified pandemonium. You fancied you heard the enormous sinister bees of violent progress buzzing over this barricade, as if they had their hive there. Was this an overgrown thicket? Was it a bacchanalian orgy? Was it a fortress? Vertigo seemed to have constructed it, with panache. There was something of the cesspool in that redoubt, and something of Olympia in that welter. You could see, in a jumble that spoke of despair, roof rafters, bits of attic with wallpaper on them, window-frames with all their panes planted in the wreckage, awaiting the cannon, detached chimneys, wardrobes, tables, benches, a howling topsy-turvy, and those countless destitute things, rejected even by the beggar, invested with both fury and nothingness. A people’s tatters, you would have said, tatters of wood, iron, bronze, stone, as if Faubourg St-Antoine had swept them there, in front of its door, with some colossal broom, making its barricade out of its poverty. Blocks of wood like executioner’s blocks, broken chains, wooden frames braced in the shape of a gibbet, horizontal wheels projecting from the wreckage, brought to this edifice of anarchy the dismal image of the old tortures suffered by the people. The St-Antoine barricade made a weapon of everything. Everything that civil war can hurl at society came out of here. This was not fighting, this was paroxysm. The rifles that defended this redoubt, among which were a few blunderbusses, fired fragments of broken crockery, gaming chips, coat-buttons, even the castors off night-stands – dangerous projectiles on account of the brass in them. This barricade was frenzied. It threw up at the clouds an indescribable din. At certain moments, to provoke the army, it resorted to crowd and tumult, and was crowned with a mass of blazing faces, filled with a seething multitude, its crest spiked with guns, sabres, cudgels, axes, pikes and bayonets. A huge red flag on it flapped in the wind. Shouts of command could be heard, songs of attack, the rolling of drums, the sobbing of women and lugubrious bursts of laughter from the famished. Enormous and alive it was, and crackles and sparks emitted from it, as from the back of some electric beast. The spirit of revolution clouded this summit from which roared the voice of the people, which is like the voice of God. A strange majesty emanated from this Titanic mound of rubble. It was a heap of detritus and it was Sinai.","The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories high, and seven hundred feet wide. It barred the vast opening of the faubourg, that is to say, three streets, from angle to angle; ravined, jagged, cut up, divided, crenelated, with an immense rent, buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there, powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the faubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the formidable place which had seen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades were ranged, one behind the other, in the depths of the streets behind this principal barricade. At the very sight of it, one felt the agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg, which had reached that point of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe. Of what was that barricade made? Of the ruins of three six-story houses demolished expressly, said some. Of the prodigy of all wraths, said others. It wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred, ruin. It might be asked: Who built this? It might also be said: Who destroyed this? It was the improvisation of the ebullition. Hold! take this door! this grating! this penthouse! this chimney-piece! this broken brazier! this cracked pot! Give all! cast away all! Push this roll, dig, dismantle, overturn, ruin everything! It was the collaboration of the pavement, the block of stone, the beam, the bar of iron, the rag, the scrap, the broken pane, the unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag, and the malediction. It was grand and it was petty. It was the abyss parodied on the public place by hubbub. The mass beside the atom; the strip of ruined wall and the broken bowl,—threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish. Sisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job his potsherd. Terrible, in short. It was the acropolis of the barefooted. Overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope; an immense dray was spread out there crossways, its axle pointing heavenward, and seemed a scar on that tumultuous façade; an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main force, to the very summit of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror, presented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses of the air. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt, figured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; ’93 on ’89, the 9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire on the 11th of January, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. The situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot whence the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean made dikes, it is thus that it would build. The fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass. What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbub petrified. One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there had been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress. Was it a thicket? Was it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress? Vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings. There was something of the cesspool in that redoubt and something Olympian in that confusion. One there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair, the rafters of roofs, bits of garret windows with their figured paper, window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the cannon, wrecks of chimneys, cupboards, tables, benches, howling topsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the very refuse of the mendicant, which contain at the same time fury and nothingness. One would have said that it was the tatters of a people, rags of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint Antoine had thrust it there at its door, with a colossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade. Blocks resembling headsman’s blocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets having the form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish, amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old tortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine converted everything into a weapon; everything that civil war could throw at the head of society proceeded thence; it was not combat, it was a paroxysm; the carbines which defended this redoubt, among which there were some blunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware bones, coat-buttons, even the casters from night-stands, dangerous projectiles on account of the brass. This barricade was furious; it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor; at certain moments, when provoking the army, it was covered with throngs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it; a swarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of guns, of sabres, of cudgels, of axes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast red flag flapped in the wind; shouts of command, songs of attack, the roll of drums, the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there. It was huge and living, and, like the back of an electric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning. The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of God; a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish. It was a heap of filth and it was Sinai.","The barricade Saint Antoine was monstrous; it was three stories high and seven hundred feet long. It barred from one corner to the other the vast mouth of the Faubourg, that is to say, three streets; ravined, jagged, notched, abrupt, indented with an immense rent, buttressed with mounds which were themselves bastions, pushing out capes here and there, strongly supported by the two great promontories of houses of the Faubourg , it rose like a cyclopean embankment at the foot of the terrible square which saw the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades stood at intervals along the streets in the rear of this mother barricade. Merely from seeing it, you felt in the Faubourg the immense agonising suffering which had reached that extreme moment when distress rushes into catastrophe. Of what was this barricade made? Of the ruins of three six-story houses, torn down for the purpose, said some. Of the prodigy of all passions said others. It had the woeful aspect of all the works of hatred: Ruin. You might say: who built that? You might also say: who destroyed that? It was the improvisation of ebullition. Here! that door! that grating! that shed! that casement! that broken furnace! that cracked pot! Bring all! throw on all! push, roll, dig, dismantle, overturn, tear down all! It was the collaboration of the pavement, the pebble, the timber, the iron bar, the chip, the broken square, the stripped chair, the cabbage stump, the scrap, the rag, and the malediction. It was great and it was little. It was the bottomless pit parodied upon the spot by chaos come again. The mass with the atom; the side wall thrown down and the broken dish; a menacing fraternisation of all rubbish. Sisyphus had cast in his rock and Job his potsherd. Upon the whole, terrible. It was the acropolis of the ragamuffins. Carts overturned roughened the slope; an immense dray was displayed there, crosswise, the axle pointing to the sky, and seemed a scar upon that tumultuous façade; an omnibus, cheerily hoisted by main strength to the very top of the pile, as if the architects of that savagery would add sauciness to terror, presented its unharnessed pole to unknown horses of the air. This gigantic mass, the alluvium of émeute, brought before the mind an Ossa upon Pelion of all the revolutions; ’93 upon ’89, the 9th Thermidor upon the 10th of August, the 18th Brumaire upon the 21st of January, Vendémaire upon Prairial, 1848 upon 1830. The place deserved the pains, and that barricade was worthy to appear on the very spot where the Bastille had disappeared. Were the ocean to make dykes, it would build them thus. The fury of the flood was imprinted upon that misshapen obstruction. What flood? The multitude. You would have thought you saw uproar petrified. You would have thought you heard, upon that barricade, as if there they had been upon their hive, the humming of the enormous black bees of progress by force. Was it a thicket? was it a Bacchanal? was it a fortress? Dizziness seemed to have built it by flappings of its wing. There was something of the cloaca in this redoubt and something of Olympus in this jumble. You saw there, in a chaos full of despair, rafters from roofs, patches from garrets with their wall paper , window sashes with all their glass planted in the rubbish, awaiting artillery, chimneys torn down, wardrobes, tables, benches, a howling topsy-turvy, and those thousand beggarly things, the refuse even of the mendicant, which contain at once fury and nothingness. One would have said that it was the tatters of a people, tatters of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint Antoine had swept them there to its door by one colossal sweep of the broom, making of its misery its barricade. Logs shaped like chopping blocks, dislocated chains, wooden frames with brackets having the form of gibbets, wheels projecting horizontally from the rubbish, amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the forbidding form of the old tortures suffered by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine made a weapon of everything; all that civil war can throw at the head of society came from it ; it was not battle, it was paroxysm; the carbines which defended that stronghold, among which were some blunderbusses, scattered bits of delftware, knuckle-bones, coat buttons, even table castors, dangerous projectiles on account of the copper. This barricade was furious; it threw up to the clouds an inexpressible clamour; at certain moments defying the army, it covered itself with multitude and with tempest; a mob of flaming heads crowned it; a swarming filled it; its crest was thorny with muskets, with swords, with clubs, with axes, with pikes, and with bayonets; a huge red flag fluttered in the wind; there were heard cries of command, songs of attack, the roll of the drum, the sobs of women, and the dark wild laughter of the starving. It was huge and living; and, as from the back of an electric beast there came from it a crackling of thunders. The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud that summit whereon growled this voice of the people which is like the voice of God; a strange majesty emanated from that titanic hodful of refuse. It was a garbage heap and it was Sinaï."

L’autre, un Moniteur du 15 juin 1832, constatait le suicide de Javert, ajoutant qu’il résultait d’un rapport verbal de Javert au préfet que, fait prisonnier dans la barricade de la rue de la Chanvrerie, il avait dû la vie à la magnanimité d’un insurgé qui, le tenant sous son pistolet, au lieu de lui brûler la cervelle, avait tiré en l’air.","These two newspapers, the reader knows them.

"Bruneseau, dans son exploration, procéda d’amont en aval. Au point de partage des deux conduites d’eau du Grand-Hurleur, il déchiffra sur une pierre en saillie la date 1550 ; cette pierre indiquait la limite où s’était arrêté Philibert Delorme, chargé par Henri II de visiter la voirie souterraine de Paris. Cette pierre était la marque du seizième siècle à l’égout ; Bruneseau retrouva la main-d’œuvre du dix-septième dans le conduit du Ponceau et dans le conduit de la rue Vieille-du-Temple, voûtés entre 1600 et 1650, et la main-d’œuvre du dix-huitième dans la section ouest du canal collecteur, encaissée et voûtée en 1740. Ces deux voûtes, surtout la moins ancienne, celle de 1740, étaient plus lézardées et plus décrépites que la maçonnerie de l’égout de ceinture, laquelle datait de 1412, époque où le ruisseau d’eau vive de Ménilmontant fut élevé à la dignité de Grand Égout de Paris, avancement analogue à celui d’un paysan qui deviendrait premier valet de chambre du roi ; quelque chose comme Gros-Jean transformé en Lebel.","Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded from upstream to downstream. At the dividing point of the two water pipes of the Grand-Hurleur, he deciphered on a projecting stone the date 1550; this stone indicated the limit where Philibert Delorme had stopped, commissioned by Henri II to visit the underground roads of Paris. This stone was the mark of the sixteenth century sewer; Bruneseau found the labor of the seventeenth in the conduit of the Ponceau and in the conduit of the rue Vieille-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650, and the labor of the eighteenth in the section west of the collecting canal, sunk and vaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the least ancient, that of 1740, were more cracked and more decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer, which dated from 1412, when the stream of eau vive de Ménilmontant was elevated to the dignity of Grand Sewer of Paris, an advancement analogous to that of a peasant who would become the king's first valet; something like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.","In his exploration Bruneseau followed the direction of the flow. At the head of the two Grand-Hurleur channels he deciphered on a projecting stone the date 1550. This stone marked the furthest that Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II with visiting Paris’s subterranean network, had reached. This stone was the sixteenth century’s mark on the sewer. Bruneseau found the seventeenth century’s handiwork in the Ponceau drain and the Rue Vieille-du-Temple drain, vaulted between 1600 and 1650, and the eighteenth century’s handiwork in the western section of the collector channel, which was enclosed and vaulted in 1740. These two vaultings, especially the one that was less old, of 1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the orbital sewer, which dated from 1412, when the Ménilmontant fresh-water brook was elevated to the rank of Paris’s main sewer, a promotion similar to that of a peasant appointed chief valet to the king, something like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.","Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill. At the point of separation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he deciphered upon a projecting stone the date of 1550; this stone indicated the limits where Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. with visiting the subterranean drains of Paris, had halted. This stone was the mark of the sixteenth century on the sewer; Bruneseau found the handiwork of the seventeenth century once more in the Ponceau drain of the old Rue Vieille-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650; and the handiwork of the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal, walled and vaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the less ancient, that of 1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer, which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh water of Ménilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand Sewer of Paris, an advancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valet de chambre to the King; something like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.","Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded from the head towards the mouth. At the point of separation of the two water pipes from the Grand Hurleur, he deciphered upon a projecting stone the date 1550; this stone indicated the limit reached by Philibert Delorme, who was charged by Henry II. with visiting the subterranean canals of Paris. This stone was the mark of the sixteenth century upon the sewer; Bruneseau also found the handiwork of the seventeenth century, in the conduit of the Ponceau and the conduit of the Rue Vieille du Temple, built between 1600 and 1650, and the handiwork of the eighteenth century in the western section of the collecting canal, banked up and arched in 1740. These two arches, especially the later one, that of 1740, were more cracked and more dilapidated than the masonry of the belt sewer, which dated from 1412, the epoch when the fresh-water brook of Ménilmontant was raised to the dignity of Grand Sewer of Paris, an advancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valet de chambre to the king; something like Gros Jean transformed into Lebel."

"Plusieurs semaines se passèrent ainsi. Une vie nouvelle s’empara peu à peu de Cosette ; les relations que crée le mariage, les visites, le soin de la maison, les plaisirs, ces grandes affaires.

"Les expériences sur l’indigo n’avaient pas mieux réussi au Jardin des plantes que dans son jardin d’Austerlitz. L’année d’auparavant, il devait les gages de sa gouvernante ; maintenant, on l’a vu, il devait les termes de son loyer. Le mont-de-piété, au bout de treize mois écoulés, avait vendu les cuivres de sa Flore. Quelque chaudronnier en avait fait des casseroles. Ses cuivres disparus, ne pouvant plus compléter même les exemplaires dépareillés de sa Flore qu’il possédait encore, il avait cédé à vil prix à un libraire-brocanteur planches et texte, comme défets. Il ne lui était plus rien resté de l’œuvre de toute sa vie. Il se mit à manger l’argent de ces exemplaires. Quand il vit que cette chétive ressource s’épuisait, il renonça à son jardin et le laissa en friche. Auparavant, et longtemps auparavant, il avait renoncé aux deux œufs et au morceau de bœuf qu’il mangeait de temps de temps. Il dînait avec du pain et des pommes de terre. Il avait vendu ses derniers meubles, puis tout ce qu’il avait en double en fait de literie, de vêtements et de couvertures, puis ses herbiers et ses estampes ; mais il avait encore ses livres les plus précieux, parmi lesquels plusieurs d’une haute rareté, entre autres les Quadrains historiques de la Bible, édition de 1560, la Concordance des Bibles de Pierre de Besse, les Marguerites de la Marguerite de Jean de La Haye avec dédicace à la reine de Navarre, le livre de la Charge et dignité de l’ambassadeur par le sieur de Villiers-Hotman, un Florilegium rabbinicum de 1644, un Tibulle de 1567 avec cette splendide inscription : Venetiis, in œdibus Manutianis ; enfin un Diogène Laërce, imprimé à Lyon en 1644, et où se trouvaient les fameuses variantes du manuscrit 411, treizième siècle, du Vatican, et celles des deux manuscrits de Venise, 393 et 394, si fructueusement consultés par Henri Estienne, et tous les passages en dialecte dorique qui ne se trouvent que dans le célèbre manuscrit du douzième siècle de la bibliothèque de Naples. M. Mabeuf ne faisait jamais de feu dans sa chambre et se couchait avec le jour pour ne pas brûler de chandelle. Il semblait qu’il n’eût plus de voisins, on l’évitait quand il sortait, il s’en apercevait. La misère d’un enfant intéresse une mère, la misère d’un jeune homme intéresse une jeune fille, la misère d’un vieillard n’intéresse personne. C’est de toutes les détresses la plus froide. Cependant le père Mabeuf n’avait pas entièrement perdu sa sérénité d’enfant. Sa prunelle prenait quelque vivacité lorsqu’elle se fixait sur ses livres, et il souriait lorsqu’il considérait le Diogène Laërce, qui était un exemplaire unique. Son armoire vitrée était le seul meuble qu’il eût conservé en dehors de l’indispensable.","The experiments on indigo had not succeeded any better in the Jardin des Plantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The year before, he owed his housekeeper's wages; now, as we have seen, he owed the terms of his rent. The pawnbroker, at the end of thirteen months, had sold the copperplates of his Flora. Some boilermaker had made saucepans out of it. His copperplates gone, no longer able to complete even the mismatched copies of his Flore which he still possessed, he had given up at a low price to a bookseller-second-hand dealer the plates and text, as scraps. Nothing remained of his life's work. He began to eat the money from these copies. When he saw that this meager resource was running out, he gave up his garden and left it fallow. Previously, and long before, he had given up the two eggs and the piece of beef that he ate from time to time. He dined with bread and potatoes.

His eye regained some vivacity when it was fixed upon his books, and he smiled when he thought of the Diogenes Laertius, which was a unique copy. His glass bookcase was the only piece of furniture which he had preserved beyond what was indispensable."

"Il poussa un affreux cri de joie intérieure. ― Ainsi, c’était fini. Le dénouement arrivait plus vite qu’on n’eût osé l’espérer. L’être qui encombrait sa destinée disparaissait. Il s’en allait de lui-même, librement, de bonne volonté. Sans que lui, Jean Valjean, eût rien fait pour cela, sans qu’il y eût de sa faute, « cet homme » allait mourir. Peut-être même était-il déjà mort. — Ici sa fièvre fit des calculs. — Non. Il n’est pas encore mort. La lettre a été visiblement écrite pour être lue par Cosette le lendemain matin ; depuis ces deux décharges qu’on a entendues entre onze heures et minuit, il n’y a rien eu ; la barricade ne sera sérieusement attaquée qu’au point du jour ; mais c’est égal, du moment où « cet homme » est mêlé à cette guerre, il est perdu ; il est pris dans l’engrenage. — Jean Valjean se sentait délivré. Il allait donc, lui, se retrouver seul avec Cosette. La concurrence cessait ; l’avenir recommençait. Il n’avait qu’à garder ce billet dans sa poche. Cosette ne saurait jamais ce que « cet homme » était devenu. « Il n’y a qu’à laisser les choses s’accomplir. Cet homme ne peut échapper. S’il n’est pas mort encore, il est sûr qu’il va mourir. Quel bonheur ! »","He let out a terrible cry of inner joy. ""So it was over. The denouement came sooner than we had dared to hope. The being that cluttered his destiny disappeared. He was leaving of his own accord, freely, of good will. Without him, Jean Valjean, having done anything about it, without his fault, ""this man"" was going to die. Maybe he was already dead. ""Here his fever made calculations."" - No. He's not dead yet. The letter was obviously written to be read by Cosette the next morning; since these two discharges which we heard between eleven o'clock and midnight, there has been nothing; the barricade will not be seriously attacked until daybreak; but all the same, the moment “this man” is involved in this war, he is lost; he is caught in the gears. — Jean Valjean felt freed. So he was going to find himself alone with Cosette. Competition ceased; the future was beginning again. He just had to keep this note in his pocket. Cosette would never know what ""that man"" had become. “You just have to let things happen. This man cannot escape. If he is not dead yet, he is sure he will die. What happiness! »","He uttered a dreadful cry of inward joy. So it was all over. The solution had come sooner than anyone might have dared hope. The individual who was such an unwelcome intrusion in his life was going to vanish. The man was going, of his own accord, freely, willingly. Without Jean Valjean having to do anything about it, without his having to take any blame for it, ‘that man’ was going to die. He might even be dead already. Here his feverishness made some calculations. ‘No, he’s not dead yet. The letter was obviously written to be read by Cosette tomorrow morning. Since those two volleys of gunfire we heard between eleven o’clock and midnight there’s been nothing more. The barricade won’t be seriously attacked until daybreak. But it makes no difference, from the moment “that man” became involved in this war, he was doomed. He’s caught up in the works.’ Jean Valjean felt liberated. So he was going to be left alone with Cosette. The rivalry was over. The future was beginning again. He had only to keep this note in his pocket. Cosette would never know what had become of ‘that man’. ‘Just let things take their course. That man can’t escape. If he’s not already dead, he’s going to die for sure. What luck!’","He uttered a frightful cry of inward joy. So it was all over. The catastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope. The being who obstructed his destiny was disappearing. That man had taken himself off of his own accord, freely, willingly. This man was going to his death, and he, Jean Valjean, had had no hand in the matter, and it was through no fault of his. Perhaps, even, he is already dead. Here his fever entered into calculations. No, he is not dead yet. The letter had evidently been intended for Cosette to read on the following morning; after the two discharges that were heard between eleven o’clock and midnight, nothing more has taken place; the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak; but that makes no difference, from the moment when “that man” is concerned in this war, he is lost; he is caught in the gearing. Jean Valjean felt himself delivered. So he was about to find himself alone with Cosette once more. The rivalry would cease; the future was beginning again. He had but to keep this note in his pocket. Cosette would never know what had become of that man. All that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course. This man cannot escape. If he is not already dead, it is certain that he is about to die. What good fortune!","He uttered a hideous cry of inward joy. So, it was finished. The end came sooner than he had dared to hope. The being who encumbered his destiny was disappearing. He was going away of himself, freely, of his own accord. Without any intervention on his, Jean Valjean’s part, without any fault of his, “that man” was about to die. Perhaps even he was already dead.—Here his fever began to calculate.—No. He is not dead yet. The letter was evidently written to be read by Cosette in the morning; since those two discharges which were heard between eleven o’clock and midnight, there had been nothing; the barricade will not be seriously attacked till daybreak; but it is all the same, for the moment “that man” meddled with this war, he was lost; he is caught in the net. Jean Valjean felt that he was delivered. He would then find himself once more alone with Cosette. Rivalry ceased; the future recommenced. He had only to keep the note in his pocket. Cosette would never know what had become of “that man.” “I have only to let things take their course. That man cannot escape. If he is not dead yet, it is certain that he will die. What happiness!”"

"L’attaque fut l’ouragan. La veille, dans l’obscurité, la barricade avait été approchée silencieusement comme par un boa.

La furie était maintenant l’habileté. Une puissante colonne d’infanterie de ligne, coupée à intervalles égaux de garde nationale et de garde municipale à pied, et appuyée sur des masses profondes qu’on entendait sans les voir, déboucha dans la rue au pas de course, tambour battant, clairon sonnant, bayonnettes croisées, sapeurs en tête, et, imperturbable sous les projectiles, arriva droit sur la barricade avec le poids d’une poutre d’airain sur un mur.","The attack was the hurricane.

The fury was now the skill. A powerful column of line infantry, cut off at equal intervals from the National Guard and the Municipal Guard on foot, and supported by deep masses which one heard without seeing them, debouched into the street at a run, drum beating, bugle sounding, bayonets crossed, sappers at the head, and, imperturbable under the projectiles, arrived straight on the barricade with the weight of a brazen beam on a wall.","It was a hurricane attack.

With massed support, heard though not seen, and reaching far back, a powerful column of line infantry, interspersed at regular intervals with National and Municipal Guardsmen on foot, to the beating of drum, to the blaring of bugle, bayonets levelled, pioneers leading the way, came pouring into the street at a run, imperturbable under fire, and with the force of a bronze battering-ram against a wall charged the barricade.","The attack was a hurricane.

"Cette marche était de plus en plus laborieuse. Le niveau de ces voûtes varie ; la hauteur moyenne est d’environ cinq pieds six pouces, et a été calculée pour la taille d’un homme ; Jean Valjean était forcé de se courber pour ne pas heurter Marius à la voûte ; il fallait à chaque instant se baisser, puis se redresser, tâter sans cesse le mur. La moiteur des pierres et la viscosité du radier en faisaient de mauvais points d’appui, soit pour la main, soit pour le pied. Il trébuchait dans le hideux fumier de la ville. Les reflets intermittents des soupiraux n’apparaissaient qu’à de très longs intervalles, et si blêmes que le plein soleil y semblait clair de lune ; tout le reste était brouillard, miasme, opacité, noirceur. Jean Valjean avait faim et soif ; soif surtout ; et c’est là, comme la mer, un lieu plein d’eau où l’on ne peut boire. Sa force, qui était prodigieuse, on le sait, et fort peu diminuée par l’âge, grâce à sa vie chaste et sobre, commençait pourtant à fléchir. La fatigue lui venait, et la force en décroissant faisait croître le poids du fardeau. Marius, mort peut-être, pesait comme pèsent les corps inertes. Jean Valjean le soutenait de façon que la poitrine ne fût pas gênée et que la respiration pût toujours passer le mieux possible. Il sentait entre ses jambes le glissement rapide des rats. Un d’eux fut effaré au point de le mordre. Il lui venait de temps en temps par les bavettes des bouches de l’égout un souffle d’air frais qui le ranimait.","This walk was more and more laborious. The level of these vaults varies; the average height is about five feet six inches, and has been calculated for the height of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend over so as not to knock Marius against the arch; you had to bend down at every moment, then straighten up, constantly feel the wall. The dampness of the stones and the viscosity of the slab made them bad points of support, either for the hand or for the foot. He stumbled in the hideous dunghill of the city. The intermittent reflections of the air vents appeared only at very long intervals, and so pale that the full sun there seemed like moonlight; everything else was fog, miasma, opacity, darkness. Jean Valjean was hungry and thirsty; especially thirst; and it is, like the sea, a place full of water where one cannot drink. His strength, which was prodigious, as we know, and very little diminished by age, thanks to his chaste and sober life, nevertheless began to weaken. Fatigue came to him, and the decreasing strength made the weight of the burden increase. Marius, perhaps dead, weighed as inert bodies weigh. Jean Valjean supported him in such a way that his chest was not hampered and that breathing could always pass as well as possible. He felt between his legs the rapid sliding of the rats. One of them was frightened to the point of biting him. From time to time there came to him through the flaps of the mouths of the sewer a breath of fresh air which revived him.","This progress became more and more arduous. The height of these vaults varies. The average height is about five feet six inches, and was calculated for the size of a man. Jean Valjean was forced to bend forward so as not to bump Marius against the ceiling. He had to keep crouching down, then straightening up, constantly feeling his way along the wall. The humidity of the stone and the sliminess of the floor offered poor purchase for either hand or foot. He stumbled along inside the city’s ghastly dung-pit. The intermittent glimmers of light from the air-wells appeared only at very long intervals, and so wanly that full sunlight seemed like moonlight. All the rest was murk, miasma, opacity, darkness. Jean Valjean was hungry and thirsty, most of all thirsty, and this, like the sea, was a place full of water where a man cannot drink. His strength, which as we know was extraordinary, and thanks to his chaste and sober life very little diminished by age, was nevertheless beginning to fail. He was growing weary, and his ebbing strength increased the weight of his burden. Marius, perhaps dead, had the weight of an inert body. Jean Valjean held him so that his chest was not constricted and he could breathe as freely as possible. Jean Valjean felt rats scampering between his legs. One of them took such fright, it bit him. He felt the occasional breath of air coming through the vents at the mouths of the sewer, reviving him.","This march became more and more laborious. The level of these vaults varies; the average height is about five feet, six inches, and has been calculated for the stature of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend over, in order not to strike Marius against the vault; at every step he had to bend, then to rise, and to feel incessantly of the wall. The moisture of the stones, and the viscous nature of the timber framework furnished but poor supports to which to cling, either for hand or foot. He stumbled along in the hideous dung-heap of the city. The intermittent gleams from the air-holes only appeared at very long intervals, and were so wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon; all the rest was mist, miasma, opaqueness, blackness. Jean Valjean was both hungry and thirsty; especially thirsty; and this, like the sea, was a place full of water where a man cannot drink. His strength, which was prodigious, as the reader knows, and which had been but little decreased by age, thanks to his chaste and sober life, began to give way, nevertheless. Fatigue began to gain on him; and as his strength decreased, it made the weight of his burden increase. Marius, who was, perhaps, dead, weighed him down as inert bodies weigh. Jean Valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed, and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible. Between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats. One of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him. From time to time, a breath of fresh air reached him through the vent-holes of the mouths of the sewer, and reanimated him.","This advance became more and more laborious. The level of these arches varies; the medium height is about five feet six inches, and was calculated for the stature of a man; Jean Valjean was compelled to bend so, as not to hit Marius against the arch; he had to stoop every second, then rise up, to grope incessantly for the wall. The moisture of the stones and the sliminess of the floor made them bad points of support, whether for the hand or the foot. He was wading in the hideous muck of the city. The occasional gleams from the air-holes appeared only at long intervals, and so ghastly were they that the noonday seemed but moonlight; all the rest was mist, miasma, opacity, blackness. Jean Valjean was hungry and thirsty; thirsty especially; and this place, like the sea, is one full of water where you cannot drink. His strength, which was prodigious, and very little diminished by age, thanks to his chaste and sober life, began to give way notwithstanding. Fatigue grew upon him, and as his strength diminished the weight of his load increased. Marius, dead perhaps, weighed heavily upon him as inert bodies do. Jean Valjean supported him in such a way that his breast was not compressed and his breathing could always be as free as possible. He felt the rapid gliding of the rats between his legs. One of them was so frightened as to bite him. There came to him from time to time through the aprons of the mouths of the sewer a breath of fresh air which revived him."

"L’inondation de 1802 est un des souvenirs actuels des parisiens de quatrevingts ans. La fange se répandit en croix place des Victoires, où est la statue de Louis XIV ; elle entra rue Saint-Honoré par les deux bouches d’égout des Champs-Élysées, rue Saint-Florentin, par l’égout Saint-Florentin, rue Pierre-à-Poisson par l’égout de la Sonnerie, rue Popincourt par l’égout du Chemin-Vert, rue de la Roquette par l’égout de la rue de Lappe ; elle couvrit le caniveau de la rue des Champs-Élysées jusqu’à une hauteur de trente-cinq centimètres ; et, au midi, par le vomitoire de la Seine faisant sa fonction en sens inverse, elle pénétra rue Mazarine, rue de l’Échaudé, et rue des Marais, où elle s’arrêta à une longueur de cent neuf mètres, précisément à quelques pas de la maison qu’avait habitée Racine, respectant, dans le dix-septième siècle, le poëte plus que le roi. Elle atteignit son maximum de profondeur rue Saint-Pierre où elle s’éleva à trois pieds au-dessus des dalles de la gargouille, et son maximum d’étendue rue Saint-Sabin où elle s’étala sur une longueur de deux cent trente-huit mètres.","The flood of 1802 is one of the current memories of eighty-year-old Parisians. The mire spread out in a cross on the Place des Victoires, where the statue of Louis XIV is; it entered rue Saint-Honoré by the two manholes of the Champs-Élysées, rue Saint-Florentin, by the sewer Saint-Florentin, rue Pierre-à-Poisson by the sewer of the Sonnerie, rue Popincourt by the sewer from Chemin-Vert, rue de la Roquette via the sewer from rue de Lappe; it covered the gutter of the rue des Champs-Élysées to a height of thirty-five centimeters; and, to the south, by the vomitory of the Seine performing its function in the opposite direction, it entered rue Mazarine, rue de l'Échaudé, and rue des Marais, where it stopped at a length of one hundred and nine meters, precisely a few not from the house in which Racine had lived, respecting, in the seventeenth century, the poet more than the king. It reached its maximum depth in Rue Saint-Pierre, where it rose three feet above the slabs of the gargoyle, and its maximum extent in Rue Saint-Sabin, where it spread out over a length of two hundred and thirty- eight meters.","The inundation of 1802 is still a vivid memory to Parisians in their eighties. The filth spread crosswise over Place des Victoires, where the statue of Louis XIV stands.

It filled the gutter running down the middle of Rue des Champs-Élysées to a depth of well over twelve inches. And, to the south, the outlet into the Seine backed up, sending it into Rue Mazarine, Rue de l’Échaudé and Rue des Marais, where after covering a hundred and twenty yards it stopped just a few paces short of the house where Racine had lived, showing greater respect for the seventeenth-century poet than for the king. It reached its maximum depth in Rue St-Pierre, where it rose three feet above the flagstones of the gutter, and its maximum expanse in Rue St-Sabin, where it stretched over two hundred and sixty yards.","The inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians of the age of eighty. The mud spread in cross-form over the Place des Victoires, where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the Rue Saint-Honoré by the two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Élysées, the Rue Saint-Florentin through the Saint-Florentin sewer, the Rue Pierre-à-Poisson through the sewer de la Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt, through the sewer of the Chemin-Vert, the Rue de la Roquette, through the sewer of the Rue de Lappe; it covered the drain of the Rue des Champs-Élysées to the height of thirty-five centimetres; and, to the South, through the vent of the Seine, performing its functions in inverse sense, it penetrated the Rue Mazarine, the Rue de l’Échaudé, and the Rue des Marais, where it stopped at a distance of one hundred and nine metres, a few paces distant from the house in which Racine had lived, respecting, in the seventeenth century, the poet more than the King. It attained its maximum depth in the Rue Saint-Pierre, where it rose to the height of three feet above the flag-stones of the water-spout, and its maximum length in the Rue Saint-Sabin, where it spread out over a stretch two hundred and thirty-eight metres in length.","The inundation of 1802 is a present reminiscence with Parisians of eighty.

It attained its maximum depth in the Rue Saint Pierre, where it rose three feet above the flagging of the water-spouts, and its maximum extent in the Rue Saint Sabin, where it spread out over a length of two hundred and sixty-one yards."

Le Thénardier essaya de se débarrasser des bras d’Éponine et grommela :,Thénardier tried to get rid of Éponine's arms and grumbled:,"Thénardier tried to free himself from Éponine’s arms, grumbling, ‘All right.","Thénardier tried to disentangle himself from Éponine’s arms, and grumbled:—","Thénardier tried to free himself from Eponine’s arms, and muttered:"
"Mais Enjolras et Marius, et sept ou huit ralliés autour d’eux, s’étaient élancés et les protégeaient. Enjolras avait crié aux soldats : N’avancez pas ! et un officier n’ayant pas obéi, Enjolras avait tué l’officier. Il était maintenant dans la petite cour intérieure de la redoute, adossé à la maison de Corinthe, l’épée d’une main, la carabine de l’autre, tenant ouverte la porte du cabaret qu’il barrait aux assaillants. Il cria aux désespérés : ― Il n’y a qu’une porte ouverte. Celle-ci. ― Et, les couvrant de son corps, faisant à lui seul face à un bataillon, il les fit passer derrière lui. Tous s’y précipitèrent. Enjolras, exécutant avec sa carabine, dont il se servait maintenant comme d’une canne, ce que les bâtonnistes appellent la rose couverte, rabattit les bayonnettes autour de lui et devant lui, et entra le dernier ; et il y eut un instant horrible, les soldats voulant pénétrer, les insurgés voulant fermer. La porte fut close avec une telle violence qu’en se remboîtant dans son cadre, elle laissa voir coupés et collés à son chambranle les cinq doigts d’un soldat qui s’y était cramponné.","But Enjolras and Marius, and seven or eight rallied around them, had rushed forward and protected them. Enjolras had shouted to the soldiers: Don't advance! and an officer not having obeyed, Enjolras had killed the officer. He was now in the little interior court of the redoubt, leaning against the house of Corinthe, sword in one hand, carbine in the other, holding open the door of the wine-shop which he barred against assailants. He cried out to the desperate: ―There is only one open door. This one. ―And, covering them with his body, facing a battalion alone, he made them pass behind him. Everyone rushed there. Enjolras, executing with his carbine, which he was now using as a cane, what the batonists call the covered rose, lowered the bayonets around him and in front of him, and entered the last; and there was a horrible moment, the soldiers wanting to enter, the insurgents wanting to close. The door was closed with such violence that, as it slid back into its frame, it revealed the five fingers of a soldier who had clung to it, cut and glued to its frame.","But Enjolras and Marius, and seven or eight others rallied around them, sprang forward to protect the men. Enjolras shouted to the soldiers, ‘Don’t come any nearer!’ And one officer having failed to obey, Enjolras had killed him. He was now in the little inner courtyard of the redoubt, with his back against the Corinthe building, sword in one hand, rifle in the other, holding open the door to the tavern, which he was barring to the assailants. ‘There’s only one open door, this one!’ he shouted to the desperate insurgents. And shielding them with his body, single-handedly confronting a whole battalion, he let them slip in behind him. All of them dashed inside. Executing with his rifle, which he was now using like a cane, what stick-fighters call a ‘covered rose’ around his head, Enjolras fended off the bayonets around and in front of him, and was the last to go in. And there was a terrible moment when the soldiers were trying to get in and the insurgents were trying to shut them out. The door was closed with such violence that, as it slammed shut, the five severed fingers of a soldier who had been clinging to the door-frame could be seen stuck on the inside of it.","But Enjolras and Marius, and the seven or eight rallied about them, sprang forward and protected them. Enjolras had shouted to the soldiers: “Don’t advance!” and as an officer had not obeyed, Enjolras had killed the officer. He was now in the little inner court of the redoubt, with his back planted against the Corinthe building, a sword in one hand, a rifle in the other, holding open the door of the wine-shop which he barred against assailants. He shouted to the desperate men:—“There is but one door open; this one. ”—And shielding them with his body, and facing an entire battalion alone, he made them pass in behind him. All precipitated themselves thither. Enjolras, executing with his rifle, which he now used like a cane, what single-stick players call a “covered rose” round his head, levelled the bayonets around and in front of him, and was the last to enter; and then ensued a horrible moment, when the soldiers tried to make their way in, and the insurgents strove to bar them out. The door was slammed with such violence, that, as it fell back into its frame, it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been clinging to it, cut off and glued to the post.","But Enjolras and Marius, with seven or eight who had been rallied about them, sprang forward and protected them. Enjolras cried to the soldiers: “Keep back!” and an officer not obeying, Enjolras killed the officer. He was now in the little interior court of the redoubt, with his back to the house of Corinth, his sword in one hand, his carbine in the other, keeping the door of the wine-shop open while he barred it against the assailants. He cried to the despairing: “There is but one door open. This one.” And, covering them with his body, alone facing a battalion, he made them pass in behind him. All rushed in, Enjolras executing with his carbine, which he now used as a cane, what cudgel-players call la rose couverte beat down the bayonets about him and before him, and entered last of all; and for an instant it was horrible, the soldiers struggling to get in, the insurgents to close the door. The door was closed with such violence that, in shutting into its frame, it exposed, cut off, and adhering to the casement, the thumb and fingers of a soldier who had caught hold of it."

"Comment était-il arrivé là ? C’est ce qu’on n’a jamais pu expliquer ni comprendre. Les éclairs avaient dû tout ensemble le gêner et l’aider. S’était-il servi des échelles et des échafaudages des couvreurs pour gagner de toit en toit, de clôture en clôture, de compartiment en compartiment, les bâtiments de la cour Charlemagne, puis les bâtiments de la cour Saint-Louis, le mur de ronde, et de là la masure sur la rue du Roi-de-Sicile ? Mais il y avait dans ce trajet des solutions de continuité qui semblaient le rendre impossible. Avait-il posé la planche de son lit comme un pont du toit du Bel-Air au mur du chemin de ronde, et s’était-il mis à ramper à plat ventre sur le chevron du mur de ronde tout autour de la prison jusqu’à la masure ? Mais le mur du chemin de ronde de la Force dessinait une ligne crénelée et inégale, il montait et descendait, il s’abaissait à la caserne des pompiers, il se relevait à la maison des bains, il était coupé par des constructions, il n’avait pas la même hauteur sur l’hôtel Lamoignon que sur la rue Pavée, il avait partout des chutes et des angles droits ; et puis les sentinelles auraient dû voir la sombre silhouette du fugitif ; de cette façon encore le chemin fait par Thénardier reste à peu près inexplicable. Des deux manières, fuite impossible. Thénardier, illuminé par cette effrayante soif de la liberté qui change les précipices en fossés, les grilles de fer en claies d’osier, un cul-de-jatte en athlète, un podagre en oiseau, la stupidité en instinct, l’instinct en intelligence, et l’intelligence en génie, Thénardier avait-il inventé et improvisé une troisième manière ? On ne l’a jamais su.","How had he got there? This has never been explained or understood. The lightning must have both hindered and aided him. Had he used the roofers' ladders and scaffolding to reach from roof to roof, from fence to fence, from compartment to compartment, the buildings of the Cour Charlemagne, then the buildings of the Cour Saint-Louis, the wall of round, and from there the hovel on the rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But there were breaks in this path that seemed to make it impossible. Had he placed the board of his bed like a bridge from the roof of the Bel-Air to the wall of the walkway, and had he begun to crawl on his stomach on the rafter of the wall of the walkway all around the prison until at home? But the wall of the walkway of La Force drew a crenellated and uneven line, it went up and down, it lowered at the fire station, it rose again at the bathhouse, it was cut off by buildings, it t was not the same height on the Hôtel Lamoignon as on the rue Pavée, there were falls and right angles everywhere; and then the sentries should have seen the dark silhouette of the fugitive; in this way, the path taken by Thenardier remains almost inexplicable. Either way, escape impossible. Thénardier, illuminated by that terrifying thirst for freedom which changes precipices into ditches, iron gates into wickerwork, a cripple into an athlete, a gout into a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into intelligence, and intelligence in genius, had Thenardier invented and improvised a third way? We never knew.","How had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explain or understand. The lightning must have been both a help and a hindrance to him. Had he made use of the roofers’ ladders and scaffolding to get from roof to roof, enclosure to enclosure, section to section, to the Cour Charlemagne buildings, then on to the Cour St-Louis buildings, the perimeter wall, and from there to the ruin on Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But that route posed problems that would have seemed to make it impossible. Did he use the wooden plank from his bed as a bridge from the Bel-Air roof to the perimeter walkway, and crawl flat on his stomach along the coping of the outer wall all around the prison to the ruined building? But the perimeter wall of La Force formed a crenellated and irregular line. It rose and fell, it went down by the firemen’s barracks, then it went up by the bath-house, intermediary structures cut across it; it was not the same height above Hôtel Lamoignon as above Rue Pavée, there were sheer drops and right-angled corners everywhere. And besides, the sentries would have seen the fugitive’s dark silhouette. So this way too, how Thénardier managed it remains more or less inexplicable. Impossible to escape either way. Inspired by that tremendous thirst for liberty that turns precipices into ditches, iron bars into willow hurdles, a sluggard into an athlete, a gouty cripple into a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into intelligence and intelligence into genius, had Thénardier come up with a third way? No one has ever found out.","How had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explain or understand. The lightning must, at the same time, have hindered and helped him. Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof, from enclosure to enclosure, from compartment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court, then to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, and thence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the Fine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut? But the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated and unequal line; it mounted and descended, it dropped at the firemen’s barracks, it rose towards the bath-house, it was cut in twain by buildings, it was not even of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavée; everywhere occurred falls and right angles; and then, the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence, the route taken by Thénardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two manners, flight was impossible. Had Thénardier, spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches, iron bars into wattles of osier, a legless man into an athlete, a gouty man into a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into intelligence, and intelligence into genius, had Thénardier invented a third mode? No one has ever found out.","How had he got there? That is what nobody has ever been able to explain or understand. The lightning must have both confused and helped him. Did he use the ladders and the scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof, from inclosure to inclosure, from compartment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court, then the buildings of the Cour Saint Louis, the encircling wall, and from thence to the ruin on the Rue du Roi de Sicile? But there were gaps in this route which seemed to render it impossible. Did he lay down the plank from his bed as a bridge from the roof of the Bel Air to the encircling wall, and did he crawl on his belly along the coping of the wall, all round the prison as far as the ruin? But the encircling wall of La Force followed an indented and uneven line, it rose and fell, it sank down to the barracks of the firemen, it rose up to the bathing-house, it was cut by buildings, it was not of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavée, it had slopes and right angles everywhere; and then the sentinels would have seen the dark outline of the fugitive; on this supposition again, the route taken by Thénardier is still almost inexplicable. By either way, an impossible flight. Had Thénardier, illuminated by that fearful thirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches, iron gratings into osier screens, a cripple into an athlete, an old gouty into a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into intelligence, and intelligence into genius, had Thénardier invented and extemporised a third method? It has never been known."

"Ce genre d’écroulement était alors fréquent dans le sous-sol des Champs-Élysées, difficilement maniable aux travaux hydrauliques et peu conservateur des constructions souterraines à cause de son excessive fluidité. Cette fluidité dépasse l’inconsistance des sables même du quartier Saint-Georges, qui n’ont pu être vaincus que par un enrochement sur béton, et des couches glaiseuses infectées de gaz du quartier des Martyrs, si liquides que le passage n’a pu être pratiqué sous la galerie des Martyrs qu’au moyen d’un tuyau en fonte. Lorsqu’en 1836 on a démoli sous le faubourg Saint-Honoré, pour le reconstruire, le vieil égout en pierre où nous voyons en ce moment Jean Valjean engagé, le sable mouvant, qui est le sous-sol des Champs-Élysées jusqu’à la Seine, fit obstacle, au point que l’opération dura près de six mois, au grand récri des riverains, surtout des riverains à hôtels et à carrosses. Les travaux furent plus que malaisés ; ils furent dangereux. Il est vrai qu’il y eut quatre mois et demi de pluie et trois crues de la Seine.","This kind of collapse was then frequent in the basement of the Champs-Élysées, difficult to handle for hydraulic works and not very conservative for underground constructions because of its excessive fluidity. This fluidity goes beyond the inconsistency of the very sands of the Saint-Georges district, which could only be overcome by rockfill on concrete, and of the gas-infected clay layers of the Martyrs district, so liquid that the passage could not be practiced under the gallery of the Martyrs only by means of a cast iron pipe. When in 1836 they demolished under the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, to rebuild it, the old stone sewer where we see at this moment Jean Valjean engaged, the quicksand, which is the basement of the Champs-Élysées until the Seine, became an obstacle, to the point that the operation lasted nearly six months, much to the outcry of local residents, especially residents with hotels and carriages. The work was more than difficult; they were dangerous. It is true that there were four and a half months of rain and three floods of the Seine.","This sort of subsidence was a common occurrence at that time in the subsoil under the Champs-Élysées, which presents difficulties for hydraulic works and is a poor medium for underground constructions on account of its excessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds the looseness of the sands of even the St-Georges district, which only concrete bedding has been able to overcome, and the clayey gas-contaminated strata of the Martyrs district, which are so liquid that the only way a passage could be created under the Martyrs tunnel was by means of a cast-iron pipe. When in 1836 the old stone sewer under Faubourg St-Honoré, in which we now see Jean Valjean, was demolished in order to rebuild it, the quicksand that is the subsoil of the Champs-Élysées all the way down to the Seine presented such an obstacle that the operation lasted nearly six months – to the loud protests of riverside dwellers, particularly riverside dwellers with private mansions and carriages. The construction work was more than difficult, it was dangerous. True, there were four and a half months of rain, and the Seine was in flood three times.","This sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the Champs-Élysées, difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad preservative of the subterranean constructions, on account of its excessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the sands of the Quartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered by a stone construction on a concrete foundation, and the clayey strata, infected with gas, of the Quartier des Martyrs, which are so liquid that the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des Martyrs was by means of a cast-iron pipe. When, in 1836, the old stone sewer beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, in which we now see Jean Valjean, was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it, the quicksand, which forms the subsoil of the Champs-Élysées as far as the Seine, presented such an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearly six months, to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside, particularly those who had hotels and carriages. The work was more than unhealthy; it was dangerous. It is true that they had four months and a half of rain, and three floods of the Seine.","This kind of settling was then frequent in the subsoil of the Champs-Elysées, very unfavourable for hydraulic works, and giving poor support to underground constructions, from its excessive fluidity. This fluidity surpasses even that of the sands of the Saint Georges quartier, which could only be overcome by stonework upon concrete, and the clayey beds infected with gas in the quartier of the Martyrs, so liquid that the passage could be effected under the gallery of the martyrs only by means of a metallic tube. When, in 1836, they demolished, for the purpose of rebuilding, the old stone sewer under the Faubourg Saint Honore, in which we find Jean Valjean now entangled, the quicksand, which is the subsoil from the Champs-Elysées to the Seine, was such an obstacle that the work lasted nearly six months, to the great outcry of the bordering proprietors, especially the proprietors of hotels and coaches. The work was more than difficult; it was dangerous. It is true that there were four months and a half of rain, and three risings of the Seine."

The reversal of the letters turned them into a bizarre scrawl, and he saw no sense in them. Then he said to himself, ‘But this doesn’t mean anything, there’s nothing written here.’ And with inexpressible relief he drew a deep breath. Who has not experienced such foolish joys in dreadful moments? The soul does not give in to despair without having exhausted every illusion.","Little by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked at Cosette’s blotting-book, and the consciousness of the reality returned to him. He caught up the blotter and said: “It comes from there.” He feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter, the reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and he saw no sense in it. Then he said to himself: “But this signifies nothing; there is nothing written here.” And he drew a long breath with inexpressible relief. Who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants? The soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions.","Little by little his perception became more precise; he looked at Cosette’s blotter, and the consciousness of the real fact returned to him. He took the blotter and said: “It comes from that.” He feverishly examined the five lines imprinted on the blotter, the reversal of the letters made a fantastic scrawl of them, and he saw no sense in them. Then he said to himself: “But that does not mean anything, there is nothing written there.” And he drew a long breath, with an inexpressible sense of relief. Who has not felt these silly joys in moments of horror? The soul does not give itself up to despair until it has exhausted all illusions."
"Et, à côté de cela, — toutes ces contradictions sont le jeu d’éclairs de l’amour, — ils riaient volontiers, et avec une liberté ravissante, et si familièrement qu’ils avaient parfois presque l’air de deux garçons. Cependant, à l’insu même des cœurs ivres de chasteté, la nature inoubliable est toujours là. Elle est là, avec son but brutal et sublime, et, quelle que soit l’innocence des âmes, on sent, dans le tête-à-tête le plus pudique, l’adorable et mystérieuse nuance qui sépare un couple d’amants d’une paire d’amis.","And besides that—all these contradictions are love's play of lightning—they laughed willingly, and with delightful freedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes almost looked like two boys. However, unbeknownst to even hearts drunk with chastity, the unforgettable nature is still there.

Still, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity, nature is always present and will not be forgotten. She is there with her brutal and sublime object; and however great may be the innocence of souls, one feels in the most modest private interview, the adorable and mysterious shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends.","And, by the side of this—all these contradictions are the lightning play of love—they were fond of laughing, and laughed with a charming freedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes seemed almost like two boys.

There she is, with her aim, animal yet sublime; and whatever may be the innocence of souls, we feel, in the most modest intercourse, the adorable and mysterious shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends."

"Cependant sur la rive gauche la cavalerie municipale s’ébranlait et venait barrer le pont, sur la rive droite les dragons sortaient des Célestins et se déployaient le long du quai Morland. Le peuple qui traînait Lafayette les aperçut brusquement au coude du quai et cria : les dragons ! Les dragons s’avançaient au pas, en silence, pistolets dans les fontes, sabres aux fourreaux, mousquetons aux porte-crosse, avec un air d’attente sombre.","However, on the left bank the municipal cavalry set off and came to block the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons came out of the Célestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The people dragging Lafayette saw them suddenly at the bend of the quay and shouted: the dragoons! The dragoons advanced at a walk, in silence, pistols in their holsters, sabers in their scabbards, carabiners in the butt-holders, with an air of gloomy expectation.","Meanwhile, moving off on the left bank, the municipal cavalry proceeded to bar the bridge, and emerging from the Célestins barracks on the right bank the dragoons deployed along Quai Morland. The people drawing Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them round the bend on the embankment and shouted, ‘The dragoons! The dragoons!’ The dragoons advanced at walking pace, in silence and with an air of grave expectation, their pistols in their holsters, their swords in their scabbards, their musketoons in their rifle buckets.","In the meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in motion, and came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the Célestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The men who were dragging Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quay and shouted: “The dragoons!” The dragoons advanced at a walk, in silence, with their pistols in their holsters, their swords in their scabbards, their guns slung in their leather sockets, with an air of gloomy expectation.","Meanwhile, on the left bank, the municipal cavalry was in motion, and had just barred the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons left the Célestins and deployed along the Quai Morland.

"La guerre civile ? qu’est-ce à dire ? Est-ce qu’il y a une guerre étrangère ? Est-ce que toute guerre entre hommes n’est pas la guerre entre frères ? La guerre ne se qualifie que par son but. Il n’y a ni guerre étrangère, ni guerre civile ; il n’y a que la guerre injuste et la guerre juste. Jusqu’au jour où le grand concordat humain sera conclu, la guerre, celle du moins qui est l’effort de l’avenir qui se hâte contre le passé qui s’attarde, peut être nécessaire. Qu’a-t-on à reprocher à cette guerre-là ? La guerre ne devient honte, l’épée ne devient poignard que lorsqu’elle assassine le droit, le progrès, la raison, la civilisation, la vérité. Alors, guerre civile ou guerre étrangère, elle est inique ; elle s’appelle le crime. En dehors de cette chose sainte, la justice, de quel droit une forme de la guerre en mépriserait-elle une autre ? de quel droit l’épée de Washington renierait-elle la pique de Camille Desmoulins ? Léonidas contre l’étranger, Timoléon contre le tyran, lequel est le plus grand ? l’un est le défenseur, l’autre est le libérateur. Flétrira-t-on, sans s’inquiéter du but, toute prise d’armes dans l’intérieur de la cité ? alors notez d’infamie Brutus, Marcel, Arnould de Blankenheim, Coligny. Guerre de buissons ? guerre de rues ? Pourquoi pas ? c’était la guerre d’Ambiorix, d’Artevelde, de Marnix, de Pélage. Mais Ambiorix luttait contre Rome, Artevelde contre la France, Marnix contre l’Espagne, Pélage contre les Maures ; tous contre l’étranger. Eh bien, la monarchie, c’est l’étranger ; l’oppression, c’est l’étranger ; le droit divin, c’est l’étranger. Le despotisme viole la frontière morale, comme l’invasion viole la frontière géographique. Chasser le tyran ou chasser l’anglais, c’est, dans les deux cas, reprendre son territoire. Il vient une heure où protester ne suffit plus ; après la philosophie il faut l’action ; la vive force achève ce que l’idée a ébauché ; Prométhée enchaîné commence, Aristogiton finit ; l’Encyclopédie éclaire les âmes, le 10 août les électrise. Après Eschyle, Thrasybule ; après Diderot, Danton. Les multitudes ont une tendance à accepter le maître. Leur masse dépose de l’apathie. Une foule se totalise aisément en obéissance. Il faut les remuer, les pousser, rudoyer les hommes par le bienfait même de leur délivrance, leur blesser les yeux par le vrai, leur jeter la lumière à poignées terribles. Il faut qu’ils soient eux-mêmes un peu foudroyés par leur propre salut ; cet éblouissement les réveille. De là la nécessité des tocsins et des guerres. Il faut que de grands combattants se lèvent, illuminent les nations par l’audace, et secouent cette triste humanité que couvrent d’ombre le droit divin, la gloire césarienne, la force, le fanatisme, le pouvoir irresponsable et les majestés absolues ; cohue stupidement occupée à contempler, dans leur splendeur crépusculaire, ces sombres triomphes de la nuit. A bas le tyran ! Mais quoi ? de qui parlez-vous ? appelez-vous Louis-Philippe le tyran ? Non ; pas plus que Louis XVI. Ils sont tous deux ce que l’histoire a coutume de nommer de bons rois ; mais les principes ne se morcellent pas, la logique du vrai est rectiligne, le propre de la vérité c’est de manquer de complaisance ; pas de concession donc ; tout empiétement sur l’homme doit être réprimé ; il y a le droit divin dans Louis XVI, il y a parce que Bourbon dans Louis-Philippe ; tous deux représentent dans une certaine mesure la confiscation du droit, et pour déblayer l’usurpation universelle, il faut les combattre ; il le faut, la France étant toujours ce qui commence. Quand le maître tombe en France, il tombe partout. En somme, rétablir la vérité sociale, rendre son trône à la liberté, rendre le peuple au peuple, rendre à l’homme la souveraineté, replacer la pourpre sur la tête de la France, restaurer dans leur plénitude la raison et l’équité, supprimer tout germe d’antagonisme en restituant chacun à lui-même, anéantir l’obstacle que la royauté fait à l’immense concorde universelle, remettre le genre humain de niveau avec le droit, quelle cause plus juste, et, par conséquent, quelle guerre plus grande ? Ces guerres-là construisent la paix. Une énorme forteresse de préjugés, de privilèges, de superstitions, de mensonges, d’exactions, d’abus, de violences, d’iniquités, de ténèbres, est encore debout sur le monde avec ses tours de haine. Il faut la jeter bas. Il faut faire crouler cette masse monstrueuse. Vaincre à Austerlitz, c’est grand, prendre la Bastille, c’est immense.","Civil war ? what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not all war between men war between brothers? War can only be qualified by its purpose. There is neither foreign war nor civil war; there is only unjust war and just war. Until the day when the great human concordat is concluded, war, at least that which is the effort of the hastening future against the lingering past, may be necessary. What can we blame for this war? War only becomes shameful, the sword becomes a dagger when it assassinates law, progress, reason, civilization, truth. So, civil war or foreign war, it is iniquitous; it is called crime. Apart from this holy thing, justice, what right has one form of war to despise another? by what right would the sword of Washington deny the pike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas versus the stranger, Timoleon versus the tyrant, which is greater? one is the defender, the other is the liberator. Will we stigmatize, without worrying about the goal, any takeover of arms in the interior of the city? then mark Brutus, Marcel, Arnould de Blankenheim, Coligny with infamy. Bush war? street war? Why not ? it was the war of Ambiorix, Artevelde, Marnix, Pelagius. But Ambiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde against France, Marnix against Spain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against the stranger. Well, monarchy is foreign; oppression is the foreigner; divine right is the foreigner. Despotism violates the moral boundary, as invasion violates the geographical boundary. To drive out the tyrant or drive out the English is, in both cases, to regain one's territory. There comes a time when protesting is no longer enough; after philosophy there must be action; living force completes what the idea has sketched out; Chained Prometheus begins, Aristogiton ends; the Encyclopedia enlightens souls, August 10 electrifies them. After Aeschylus, Thrasybulus; after Diderot, Danton. The multitudes have a tendency to accept the master. Their mass deposits apathy. A crowd is easily totaled in obedience. We must move them, push them, roughen men for the very benefit of their deliverance, hurt their eyes with the truth, throw terrible handfuls of light at them. They themselves must be a little overwhelmed by their own salvation; this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessity of tocsins and wars. It is necessary that great fighters arise, illuminate the nations by audacity, and shake this sad humanity which covers with shadow the divine right, the Caesarian glory, the force, the fanaticism, the irresponsible power and the absolute majesties; a crowd stupidly occupied in contemplating, in their twilight splendor, these dark triumphs of the night. Down with the tyrant! But what ? who are you talking about ? do you call Louis-Philippe the tyrant? No ; no more than Louis XVI. They are both what history has called good kings; but principles are not fragmented, the logic of truth is rectilinear, the characteristic of truth is to lack complacency; no concession therefore; any encroachment on man must be suppressed; there is divine right in Louis XVI, there is because Bourbon in Louis-Philippe; both represent to a certain extent the confiscation of rights, and to clear away universal usurpation they must be fought; it must, France always being what begins. When the master falls in France, he falls everywhere. In short, to restore social truth, to restore liberty to its throne, to restore the people to the people, to restore sovereignty to man, to replace the purple on the head of France, to restore reason and equity to their fullness, to suppress every germ of antagonism by restoring each to himself, to annihilate the obstacle which royalty poses to the immense universal concord, to put the human race back on a level with the law, what more just cause, and, consequently, what bigger war? These wars build peace. An enormous fortress of prejudices, privileges, superstitions, lies, exactions, abuses, violence, iniquities, darkness, is still standing on the world with its towers of hatred. You have to throw it down. This monstrous mass must be brought down. To win at Austerlitz is great, to take the Bastille is immense.","Civil war? What does that mean? Is there such a thing as foreign war? Is not all war between men war between brothers? War is defined only by its objective. There is no such thing as foreign or civil war, there is only unjust war and just war. Until the day when the great human pact is made, war may be necessary – at least the war that is the urgent future striving against the ever dawdling past. What is there, in such a war, to take exception to? War does not become a disgrace, the sword does not become a dagger, except when it murders rightfulness, progress, reason, civilization, truth. Then, whether civil war or foreign war, it is iniquitous. The word for it is ‘crime’. Without that sacred thing justice, by what right does one form of war despise another? By what right should Washington’s sword repudiate Camille Desmoulins’ pike? Leonidas against the stranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, which is the greater? One is the defender, the other the liberator. Shall any resort to arms within the city limits be condemned without regard to its purpose? Then brand with infamy Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von Blankenheim, Coligny. Skirmish war? Street war? Why not? Such was the war of Ambiorix, Artevelde, Marnix, Pelagius. But Ambiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde against France, Marnix against Spain, Pelagius against the Moors – all against the foreigner. Well, monarchy is the foreigner, oppression is the foreigner, divine right is the foreigner. Despotism violates the moral frontier just as invasion violates the geographical frontier. To drive out the tyrant or to drive out the English is in both cases to retake your own territory. There comes a time when to protest is no longer enough. After philosophy, action is needed. Direct force achieves what the mind first envisages. Prometheus Bound initiates, Aristogeiton concludes. The Encyclopaedia enlightens souls, the tenth of August galvanizes them. After Aeschylus, Thrasybulus. After Diderot, Danton. The multitudes tend to accept the master. Their mass creates a sediment of apathy. A crowd readily coheres in obedience. Men need to be stirred, driven, bullied by the very benefit they derive from their deliverance, their eyes need to be stung by the truth, they need to have light hurled at them in tremendous handfuls. They themselves need to be a little thunderstruck by their own salvation. This bedazzlement will rouse them. Hence the need for alarm signals and wars. Great combatants must rise up, enlighten nations by their audacity and shake up this sorry humanity kept in darkness by divine right, imperial glory, force, fanaticism, irresponsible power and absolute majesty; this stupefied throng lost in contemplation of these sinister triumphs of the night in their twilight splendour. Down with the tyrant! But just who are you talking about? Do you call Louis-Philippe a tyrant? No, no more than Louis XVI. They are both what history usually calls good kings. But principles are indivisible, the logic of truth is rectilinear, truth is inherently unaccommodating. So no compromises. All violation against man must be curbed. There is divine right in Louis XVI, there is ‘because a Bourbon’ in Louis-Philippe. Both represent to some degree a seizure of rights, and in order to do away with universal usurpation they must be opposed. This is essential, France being always the trail-blazer. When the master falls in France, he falls everywhere. In short, to re-establish social truth, to give liberty back her throne, to give the people back to the people, to give sovereignty back to man, to reinvest France with the purple of authority, fully to reinstate equity and reason, to suppress any form of antagonism by restoring self-determination to every individual, to destroy the obstacle that royalty presents to boundless universal concord, and to bring the human race back in line with rightfulness – what cause more just, and consequently what war more noble? Such wars build peace. An enormous fortress of prejudice, privilege, superstition, mendacity, extortion, abuse, violence, iniquity and darkness still stands on this earth with its towers of hatred. It must be pulled down. This monstrous mass must be overthrown. To triumph at Austerlitz is grand, to storm the Bastille is magnificent.","Civil war—what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not all war between men, war between brothers? War is qualified only by its object. There is no such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only just and unjust war. Until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded, war, that at least which is the effort of the future, which is hastening on against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may be necessary. What have we to reproach that war with? War does not become a disgrace, the sword does not become a disgrace, except when it is used for assassinating the right, progress, reason, civilization, truth. Then war, whether foreign or civil, is iniquitous; it is called crime. Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does one form of man despise another? By what right should the sword of Washington disown the pike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas against the stranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, which is the greater? the one is the defender, the other the liberator. Shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city’s limits without taking the object into a consideration? Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von Blankenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war? War of the streets? Why not? That was the war of Ambiorix, of Artevelde, of Marnix, of Pelagius. But Ambiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde against France, Marnix against Spain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against the foreigner. Well, the monarchy is a foreigner; oppression is a stranger; the right divine is a stranger. Despotism violates the moral frontier, an invasion violates the geographical frontier. Driving out the tyrant or driving out the English, in both cases, regaining possession of one’s own territory. There comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices; after philosophy, action is required; live force finishes what the idea has sketched out; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton ends; the encyclopedia enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies them. After Æschylus, Thrasybulus; after Diderot, Danton. Multitudes have a tendency to accept the master. Their mass bears witness to apathy. A crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience.

They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well-being; this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessity of tocsins and wars.

There is a divine right in Louis XVI. , there is because a Bourbon in Louis Philippe; both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right, and, in order to clear away universal insurrection, they must be combated; it must be done, France being always the one to begin. When the master falls in France, he falls everywhere. In short, what cause is more just, and consequently, what war is greater, than that which re-establishes social truth, restores her throne to liberty, restores the people to the people, restores sovereignty to man, replaces the purple on the head of France, restores equity and reason in their plenitude, suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself, annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord, and places the human race once more on a level with the right? These wars build up peace. An enormous fortress of prejudices, privileges, superstitions, lies, exactions, abuses, violences, iniquities, and darkness still stands erect in this world, with its towers of hatred.

"― César, dit Combeferre, est tombé justement. Cicéron a été sévère pour César, et il a eu raison. Cette sévérité-là n’est point la diatribe. Quand Zoïle insulte Homère, quand Mævius insulte Virgile, quand Visé insulte Molière, quand Pope insulte Shakespeare, quand Fréron insulte Voltaire, c’est une vieille loi d’envie et de haine qui s’exécute ; les génies attirent l’injure, les grands hommes sont toujours plus ou moins aboyés. Mais Zoïle et Cicéron, c’est deux. Cicéron est un justicier par la pensée de même que Brutus est un justicier par l’épée. Je blâme, quant à moi, cette dernière justice-là, le glaive ; mais l’antiquité l’admettait. César, violateur du Rubicon, conférant, comme venant de lui, les dignités qui venaient du peuple, ne se levant pas à l’entrée du sénat, faisait, comme dit Eutrope, des choses de roi et presque de tyran, regia ac pœne tyrannica. C’était un grand homme ; tant pis, ou tant mieux ; la leçon est plus haute. Ses vingt-trois blessures me touchent moins que le crachat au front de Jésus-Christ. César est poignardé par les sénateurs ; Christ est souffleté par les valets. A plus d’outrage, on sent le Dieu.","“Caesar,” said Combeferre, “just fell. Cicero was harsh on Caesar, and he was right. This severity is not the diatribe. When Zoïle insults Homer, when Mævius insults Virgil, when Visé insults Molière, when Pope insults Shakespeare, when Fréron insults Voltaire, it is an old law of envy and hatred that is executed; geniuses attract insult, great men are always more or less barked at. But Zoïle and Cicero are two. Cicero is a vigilante by thought just as Brutus is a vigilante by the sword. As for me, I blame that last justice, the sword; but antiquity admitted it. Caesar, violator of the Rubicon, conferring, as if coming from himself, the dignities which came from the people, not rising at the entrance of the senate, did, as Eutropius says, things of a king and almost of a tyrant, regia ac pœne tyrannica . He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much the better; the lesson is higher. His twenty-three wounds affect me less than the spit on the forehead of Jesus Christ. Caesar is stabbed by the senators; Christ is slapped by the servants. With more outrage, one feels the God.","‘Caesar,’ said Combeferre, ‘was justly brought down. Cicero was harshly critical of Caesar, and he was right to be. That harshness is no diatribe. When Zoilus insults Homer, when Maevius insults Virgil, when Visé insults Molière, when Pope insults Shakespeare, when Fréron insults Voltaire, it is an old law of envy and hatred that is being observed. Genius attracts insult, great men are always more or less subject to carping. But Zoilus and Cicero are two different matters. Cicero metes out justice by the intellect just as Brutus metes out justice by the sword. For my own part, I condemn this latter form of justice, the blade, but antiquity allowed it. Caesar, violator of the Rubicon, bestowing as if they derived from him the dignities that derived from the people, not rising for the Senate, acted, as Eutropius says, like a king and almost like a tyrant, regia ac poene tyrannica. He was a great man. Too bad. Or so much the better – the lesson is all the more edifying. His twenty-three wounds affect me less than the spitting in Jesus Christ’s face. Caesar is stabbed by the senators. Christ is treated with contempt by lackeys. In the greater outrage you sense the deity.’","“Cæsar,” said Combeferre, “fell justly. Cicero was severe towards Cæsar, and he was right. That severity is not diatribe. When Zoïlus insults Homer, when Mævius insults Virgil, when Visé insults Molière, when Pope insults Shakspeare, when Frederic insults Voltaire, it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out; genius attracts insult, great men are always more or less barked at. But Zoïlus and Cicero are two different persons. Cicero is an arbiter in thought, just as Brutus is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame that last justice, the blade; but, antiquity admitted it. Cæsar, the violator of the Rubicon, conferring, as though they came from him, the dignities which emanated from the people, not rising at the entrance of the senate, committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant, regia ac pene tyrannica. He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much the better; the lesson is but the more exalted. His twenty-three wounds touch me less than the spitting in the face of Jesus Christ. Cæsar is stabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by lackeys. One feels the God through the greater outrage.”","“Cæsar,” said Combeferre, “fell justly. Cicero was severe upon Cæsar, and he was right. This severity is not diatribe. When Zoïlus insults Homer, when Mævius insults Virgil, when Visé insults Molière, when Pope insults Shakspeare, when Fréron insults Voltaire, it is an old law of envy and hatred which is at work; genius attracts insult, great men are always barked at more or less. But Zoïlus and Cicero are two. Cicero is a judge through the soul, even as Brutus is a judge through the sword. I condemn, for my own part, that final justice, the sword; but antiquity admitted it. Cæsar, the violator of the Rubicon, conferring, as coming from himself, the dignities which came from the people, not rising upon the entrance of the senate, acted, as Eutropius says, the part of a king and almost of a tyrant, regia acpenè tyrannica. He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much the better; the lesson is the greater. His twenty-three wounds touch me less than the spittle in the face of Jesus Christ. Cæsar was stabbed by senators; Christ was slapped by lackeys. In the greater outrage, we feel the God.”"

"Marius était resté pensif. Il tenait donc enfin Thénardier. Cet homme qu’il avait tant désiré retrouver, était là. Il allait donc pouvoir faire honneur à la recommandation du colonel Pontmercy. Il était humilié que ce héros dût quelque chose à ce bandit, et que la lettre de change tirée du fond du tombeau par son père sur lui, Marius, fût jusqu’à ce jour protestée. Il lui paraissait aussi, dans la situation complexe où était son esprit vis-à-vis de Thénardier, qu’il y avait lieu de venger le colonel du malheur d’avoir été sauvé par un tel gredin. Quoi qu’il en fût, il était content. Il allait donc enfin délivrer de ce créancier indigne l’ombre du colonel, et il lui semblait qu’il allait retirer de la prison pour dettes la mémoire de son père.","Marius remained pensive. So he finally had Thénardier. This man he had so longed to find was there. He would therefore be able to do honor to Colonel Pontmercy's recommendation. He was humbled that this hero owed something to this bandit, and that the bill of exchange drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father on him, Marius, was protested to this day. It also seemed to him, in the complex situation in which his mind was vis-à-vis Thénardier, that there was reason to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a scoundrel. Either way, he was happy. He was therefore going at last to free the shadow of the Colonel from this unworthy creditor, and it seemed to him that he was going to withdraw the memory of his father from prison for debts.","Marius was left pensive. At last, then, he had got hold of Thénardier. Here was the man he had so much wanted to find. He was now going to be able to honour Colonel Pontmercy ’s request. He was mortified that this hero should be indebted in any way to this ruffian, and that payment on the letter of credit drawn on him, Marius, by his father from the depths of the grave should not have been made before now. It also seemed to him, in his complex state of mind with regard to Thénardier, that there was a case for avenging the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a villain. Be that as it may, he was content. He was finally going to redeem the colonel’s shade from this unworthy creditor, and it seemed to him that he was going to rescue his father’s memory from the debtors’ prison.","Marius had become thoughtful. So he had hold of Thénardier at last. That man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him. He could honor Colonel Pontmercy’s recommendation. He felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this villain, and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father upon him, Marius, had been protested up to that day. It also seemed to him, in the complex state of his mind towards Thénardier, that there was occasion to avenge the Colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal. In any case, he was content. He was about to deliver the Colonel’s shade from this unworthy creditor at last, and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his father’s memory from the debtors’ prison.","Marius remained absorbed in thought. At last, then, he had caught Thénardier; this man, whom he had so much desired to find again, was before him: so he would be able to do honour to Colonel Pontmercy’s injunction. He was humiliated that that hero should owe anything to this bandit, and that the bill of exchange drawn by his father from the depth of the grave upon him, Marius, should have been protested until this day. It appeared to him, also, in the complex position of his mind with regard to Thénardier, that here was an opportunity to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal. However that might be, he was pleased. He was about to deliver the colonel’s shade at last from his unworthy creditor, and it seemed to him that he was about to release his father’s memory from imprisonment for debt."

Pourquoi cet agent avait-il gardé le silence ? l’homme avait-il réussi à s’évader ? avait-il corrompu l’agent ? Pourquoi cet homme ne donnait-il aucun signe de vie à Marius qui lui devait tout ?

"Le sens révolutionnaire est un sens moral. Le sentiment du droit, développé, développe le sentiment du devoir. La loi de tous, c’est la liberté, qui finit où commence la liberté d’autrui, selon l’admirable définition de Robespierre. Depuis 89, le peuple tout entier se dilate dans l’individu sublimé ; il n’y a pas de pauvre qui, ayant son droit, n’ait son rayon ; le meurt-de-faim sent en lui l’honnêteté de la France ; la dignité du citoyen est une armure intérieure ; qui est libre est scrupuleux ; qui vote règne. De là l’incorruptibilité ; de là l’avortement des convoitises malsaines ; de là les yeux héroïquement baissés devant les tentations. L’assainissement révolutionnaire est tel qu’un jour de délivrance, un 14 juillet, un 10 août, il n’y a plus de populace. Le premier cri des foules illuminées et grandissantes c’est : mort aux voleurs ! Le progrès est honnête homme ; l’idéal et l’absolu ne font pas le mouchoir. Par qui furent escortés en 1848 les fourgons qui contenaient les richesses des Tuileries ? par les chiffonniers du faubourg Saint-Antoine. Le haillon monta la garde devant le trésor. La vertu fit ces déguenillés resplendissants. Il y avait là, dans ces fourgons, dans des caisses à peine fermées, quelques-unes même entr’ouvertes, parmi cent écrins éblouissants, cette vieille couronne de France toute en diamants, surmontée de l’escarboucle de la royauté, du régent, qui valait trente millions. Ils gardaient, pieds nus, cette couronne.","The revolutionary sense is a moral sense. The feeling of right, developed, develops the feeling of duty. The law of all is freedom, which ends where the freedom of others begins, according to Robespierre's admirable definition. Since 89, the entire people expands in the sublimated individual; there is no poor man who, having his right, does not have his ray; the starving man feels in him the honesty of France; the dignity of the citizen is an interior armour; who is free is scrupulous; whoever votes reigns. Hence incorruptibility; hence the abortion of unhealthy lusts; hence the eyes heroically lowered before the temptations. The revolutionary cleansing is such that on a day of deliverance, a July 14, an August 10, there is no longer a populace. The first cry of the enlightened and growing crowds is: Death to thieves! Progress is an honest man; the ideal and the absolute do not make the handkerchief. By whom were the vans which contained the riches of the Tuileries escorted in 1848? by the ragpickers of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. The ragman stood guard in front of the treasury. Virtue made these rags resplendent. There was there, in these vans, in cases barely closed, some even ajar, among a hundred dazzling cases, this old crown of France all in diamonds, surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty, of the regent, which was worth thirty million. They kept, barefoot, this crown.","Revolutionary awareness is moral awareness. The sense of right, once developed, develops the sense of duty. The universal law is liberty, which ends where the liberty of others begins, according to Robespierre’s admirable definition. Since ’89, the entire people has flourished in the sublimated individual. There is not a pauper who, given his rights, has not his ray of sunshine; the starving man senses within himself the integrity of France. The dignity of the citizen is an interior armour. Whoever is free is scrupulous. Whoever votes, rules. From that follows incorruptibility. From that follows the aborting of unhealthy feelings of envy. From that follows eyes heroically lowered in the face of temptation. Revolutionary recovery is such that on a day of deliverance, a fourteenth of July, a tenth of August, there is no longer any rabble. The first cry of the growing throngs of the enlightened is ‘Death to thieves!’ Progress is an honest man. Neither the ideal nor the absolute steal pocket handkerchiefs. By whom were the wagons containing the riches of the Tuileries escorted in 1848? By the rag-pickers of Faubourg St-Antoine. Tatters stood guard over treasure. This ragged crew were made magnificent by virtue. In those wagons, in those barely closed chests, some even half open, among countless dazzling caskets was that ancient crown of France encrusted with diamonds, surmounted by that royal gemstone, the Regent diamond, worth thirty million francs. Barefoot, they guarded that crown.","The revolutionary sense is a moral sense. The sentiment of right, once developed, develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all is liberty, which ends where the liberty of others begins, according to Robespierre’s admirable definition. Since ’89, the whole people has been dilating into a sublime individual; there is not a poor man, who, possessing his right, has not his ray of sun; the die-of-hunger feels within him the honesty of France; the dignity of the citizen is an internal armor; he who is free is scrupulous; he who votes reigns. Hence incorruptibility; hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts; hence eyes heroically lowered before temptations. The revolutionary wholesomeness is such, that on a day of deliverance, a 14th of July, a 10th of August, there is no longer any populace.

La nature hérissée et fauve s’effare à de certaines approches où elle croit sentir le surnaturel. Les forces de l’ombre se connaissent, et ont entre elles de mystérieux équilibres. Les dents et les griffes redoutent l’insaisissable. La bestialité buveuse de sang, les voraces appétits affamés en quête de la proie, les instincts armés d’ongles et de mâchoires qui ont pour source et pour but le ventre, regardent et flairent avec inquiétude l’impassible linéament spectral rôdant sous un suaire, debout dans sa vague robe frissonnante, et qui leur semble vivre d’une vie morte et terrible. Ces brutalités, qui ne sont que matière, craignent confusément d’avoir affaire à l’immense obscurité condensée dans un être inconnu. Une figure noire barrant le passage arrête net la bête farouche. Ce qui sort du cimetière intimide et déconcerte ce qui sort de l’antre ; le féroce a peur du sinistre ; les loups reculent devant une goule rencontrée.","What had just happened in this street would not have surprised a forest. The forests, the thickets, the heathers, the harshly intersecting branches, the tall grasses, exist in a dark way; the wild swarming there glimpses the sudden appearances of the invisible; what is below man distinguishes there through the mist what is beyond man; and the things unknown to us living confront each other in the night. The bristling and tawny nature is alarmed at certain approaches where it believes it senses the supernatural. The forces of darkness know each other, and have mysterious balances between them. Teeth and claws fear the elusive. Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious hungry appetites in search of prey, instincts armed with nails and jaws which have their source and their aim in the belly, look and sniff with anxiety the impassive spectral lineament prowling under a shroud, standing in her vague quivering dress, and which seems to them to be living a dead and terrible life. These brutalities, which are only matter, are confusedly afraid of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed in an unknown being. A black figure blocking the way stops the wild beast in its tracks. What comes out of the cemetery intimidates and disconcerts what comes out of the cave; the ferocious is afraid of the sinister; the wolves recoil before a ghoul they encounter.","What had just taken place in this street would have been no surprise in a forest. Stands of trees, underwoods, thickets, rampant and tangled branches, overgrown weeds, are inherently sinister. There, the teeming wilderness glimpses the sudden apparitions of the invisible. What lies beneath man perceives through the mist what lies beyond him. And things unknown to us in our lifetime confront each other in the dark. Bristling and farouche, nature takes fright at the approach of certain things in which it believes it detects the supernatural. The forces of darkness are familiar with each other and there are between them mysterious counter-balances. Tooth and claw fear the ungraspable. Bloodthirsty bestiality, ravenous, voracious appetites in search of prey, instincts armed with talons and jaws, beginning and ending only in the belly, watch and anxiously scent the shrouded spectral form on the prowl, standing impassively in the vagueness of its quivering robe and seemingly, to them, animated by a ghastly, deathly life force. These brute beasts of mere matter are obscurely afraid of dealing with the great unknown condensed into some strange being. A black figure barring the way stops the creature of the wild in its tracks. What emerges from the graveyard intimidates and confounds what emerges from the den. The ferocious is afraid of the sinister. Wolves back away from any encounter with a ghoul.","That which had just taken place in this street would not have astonished a forest.

Nature, bristling and wild, takes alarm at certain approaches in which she fancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces of the gloom know each other, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and claws fear what they cannot grasp.

"Un soir, c’était le 4 juin, ce qui n’empêchait pas que le père Gillenormand n’eût un très bon feu dans sa cheminée, il avait congédié sa fille qui cousait dans la pièce voisine.

Il était vêtu, selon sa mode, en incroyable, et ressemblait à un antique portrait de Garat.

"Tel était cet ancien Paris, livré aux querelles, aux indécisions et aux tâtonnements. Il fut longtemps assez bête. Plus tard, 89 montra comment l’esprit vient aux villes. Mais, au bon vieux temps, la capitale avait peu de tête ; elle ne savait faire ses affaires ni moralement ni matériellement, et pas mieux balayer les ordures que les abus. Tout était obstacle, tout faisait question. L’égout, par exemple, était réfractaire à tout itinéraire. On ne parvenait pas plus à s’orienter dans la voirie qu’à s’entendre dans la ville ; en haut l’inintelligible, en bas l’inextricable ; sous la confusion des langues il y avait la confusion des caves ; Dédale doublait Babel.","Such was this old Paris, given over to quarrels, indecisions and gropings.

Everything was an obstacle, everything was a question. The sewer, for example, was refractory to any itinerary.

The sewer, for example, followed no route. People could no more find their bearings down there than they could understand each other in the city. Above ground the unintelligible, below ground the unchartable. Beneath the confusion of tongues was the confusion of tunnels. Underlying Babel was the Labyrinth.","Such was this ancient Paris, delivered over to quarrels, to indecision, and to gropings. It was tolerably stupid for a long time.

"Êtes-vous ce qu’on appelle un heureux ? Eh bien, vous êtes triste tous les jours. Chaque jour a son grand chagrin ou son petit souci. Hier, vous trembliez pour une santé qui vous est chère, aujourd’hui vous craignez pour la vôtre ; demain ce sera une inquiétude d’argent, après-demain la diatribe d’un calomniateur, l’autre après-demain le malheur d’un ami ; puis le temps qu’il fait, puis quelque chose de cassé ou de perdu, puis un plaisir que la conscience et la colonne vertébrale vous reprochent ; une autre fois, la marche des affaires publiques.

"Une des chaises où il se laissa tomber était placée devant le miroir, si fatal pour lui, si providentiel pour Marius, où il avait lu sur le buvard l’écriture renversée de Cosette.

Ce qu’il avait sur le front, ce n’était plus la ride de l’âge, c’était la marque mystérieuse de la mort. On sentait là le creusement de l’ongle impitoyable.

What was on his forehead was no longer the wrinkle of age, it was the mysterious mark of death. One felt there the digging of the pitiless fingernail. Her cheeks were hanging down; the skin on his face had that color that would make it look like there was dirt on it already; the two corners of his mouth were lowered as in that mask which the ancients sculpted on tombs; he gazed into space with an air of reproach; one would have said one of those great tragic beings who have reason to complain of someone.","The chair into which he sank was placed in front of that mirror, so disastrous for him, so providential for Marius, in which he had read on the blotter Cosette’s reversed handwriting.

"Quant à Grantaire, depuis midi, il avait dépassé le vin, médiocre source de rêves. Le vin, près des ivrognes sérieux, n’a qu’un succès d’estime. Il y a, en fait d’ébriété, la magie noire et la magie blanche ; le vin n’est que la magie blanche. Grantaire était un aventureux buveur de songes. La noirceur d’une ivresse redoutable entr’ouverte devant lui, loin de l’arrêter, l’attirait. Il avait laissé là les bouteilles et pris la chope. La chope, c’est le gouffre. N’ayant sous la main ni opium, ni haschich, et voulant s’emplir le cerveau de crépuscule, il avait eu recours à cet effrayant mélange d’eau-de-vie, de stout et d’absinthe qui produit des léthargies si terribles. C’est de ces trois vapeurs, bière, eau-de-vie, absinthe, qu’est fait le plomb de l’âme. Ce sont trois ténèbres ; le papillon céleste s’y noie ; et il s’y forme, dans une fumée membraneuse vaguement condensée en aile de chauve-souris, trois furies muettes, le cauchemar, la nuit, la mort, voletant au-dessus de Psyché endormie.","As for Grantaire, since noon he had passed wine, a mediocre source of dreams. Wine, near serious drunkards, has only a success of esteem. There is, in terms of drunkenness, black magic and white magic; wine is just white magic. Grantaire was an adventurous drinker of dreams. The darkness of a formidable intoxication half-open before him, far from stopping him, attracted him. He left the bottles there and took the mug. The mug is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish at hand, and wanting to fill his brain with twilight, he had recourse to that frightful mixture of brandy, stout, and absinthe which produces such terrible lethargies. . It is of these three vapours, beer, brandy, absinthe, that the lead of the soul is made. These are three darknesses; the celestial butterfly drowns there; and there form, in a membranous smoke vaguely condensed into the wing of a bat, three mute furies, nightmare, night, death, hovering above sleeping Psyche.","Since noon Grantaire himself had moved on from wine, no great source of dreams. Among serious drinkers wine has only limited success. In the matter of drunkenness, there is white magic and black magic. Wine is only white magic. Grantaire was an adventurous drinker of dreams. As a prospect, the blackness of extreme drunkenness, far from deterring him, attracted him. He had forsaken the bottles and taken to the tankard. The tankard is the abyss. With neither opium nor hashish to hand, and wanting to fill his head with twilight, he had resorted to that dreadful mixture of brandy, stout and absinthe that produces such terrible lethargies. It is of these three vapours, beer, brandy and absinthe, that the leadenness of the soul is made. They are three darknesses in which the celestial butterfly drowns. And in a vaporous layer vaguely condensed into a bat’s wing, three silent Furies take shape, Nightmare, Night and Death, hovering over sleeping Psyche.","As for Grantaire, he had got beyond wine, that merely moderate inspirer of dreams, ever since midday. Wine enjoys only a conventional popularity with serious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matter of inebriety, white magic and black magic; wine is only white magic.

He had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass. The beer-glass is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on hand, and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight, he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which produces the most terrible of lethargies.

They are three grooms; the celestial butterfly is drowned in them; and there are formed there in a membranous smoke, vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat, three mute furies, Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover about the slumbering Psyche.","As for Grantaire, since noon, he had got beyond wine, an indifferent source of dreams.

The blackness of a fearful drunkenness yawning before him, far from checking him, drew him on. He had left the bottle behind and taken to the jug. The jug is the abyss. Having at his hand neither opium nor hashish, and wishing to fill his brain with mist, he had had recourse to that frightful mixture of brandy, stout, and absinthe, which produces such terrible lethargy. It is from these three vapours, beer, bandy, and absinthe; that the lead of the soul is formed.

"Les deux hôtes de Gavroche regardèrent autour d’eux et éprouvèrent quelque chose de pareil à ce qu’éprouverait quelqu’un qui serait enfermé dans la grosse tonne de Heidelberg, ou mieux encore, à ce que dut éprouver Jonas dans le ventre biblique de la baleine.

You could see here and there in the corners large blackish spots which seemed to be alive and which moved rapidly with a sudden, startled movement.","Gavroche’s two guests looked around them, and felt something rather similar to what anyone shut up inside the great Heidelberg tun would feel, or better still what Jonah must have felt in the biblical belly of the whale.

In less than a minute, two-thirds of the paving-stones which Enjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinth were carried up to the first story and to the garret; and before a second minute had elapsed, these stones, artistically laid one upon another, walled up half the height of the window on the first story and the dormer windows of the attic.

"Du reste, par sa fille Azelma, qu’il avait mise à la piste des mariés du 16 février, et par ses fouilles personnelles, il était parvenu à savoir beaucoup de choses, et, du fond de ses ténèbres, il avait réussi à saisir plus d’un fil mystérieux. Il avait, à force d’industrie, découvert, ou, tout au moins, à force d’inductions, deviné quel était l’homme qu’il avait rencontré un certain jour dans le Grand Égout. De l’homme, il était facilement arrivé au nom. Il savait que madame la baronne Pontmercy, c’était Cosette. Mais de ce côté-là, il comptait être discret. Qui était Cosette ? Il ne le savait pas au juste lui-même. Il entrevoyait bien quelque bâtardise, l’histoire de Fantine lui avait toujours semblé louche ; mais à quoi bon en parler ? Pour se faire payer son silence ? Il avait, ou croyait avoir, à vendre mieux que cela. Et, selon toute apparence, venir faire, sans preuve, cette révélation au baron Pontmercy : Votre femme est bâtarde, cela n’eût réussi qu’à attirer la botte du mari vers les reins du révélateur.","Moreover, through his daughter Azelma, whom he had put on the trail of the newlyweds of February 16, and through his personal excavations, he had managed to find out many things, and, from the depths of his darkness, he had succeeded in grasping more than one mysterious thread. He had, by dint of industry, discovered, or at least by dint of inductions, guessed who was the man he had met one day in the Great Sewer. From the man he had easily arrived at the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was Cosette. But on that side, he intended to be discreet. Who was Cosette? He just didn't know himself. He had a glimpse of some bastardy, Fantine's story had always seemed suspicious to him; but why talk about it? To be paid for his silence? He had, or believed he had, to sell better than that. And, to all appearance, to come and make this revelation to Baron Pontmercy, without proof: Your wife is a bastard, that would only have succeeded in drawing the husband's boot towards the loins of the revealer.","On the other hand, through his daughter Azelma, whom he had sent to track down the couple who were married on the sixteenth of February, and through his own personal delvings, he had managed to find out a great many things, and he had succeeded in unearthing from the shadows more than one mysterious lead. He had through industrious effort discovered, or at least through a process of intuitive reasoning guessed, who the man was that he had encountered one particular day in the Great Sewer. From the man, he had easily arrived at the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was Cosette. But in that respect he intended to be discreet. Who was Cosette? He did not know, exactly. He certainly harboured some suspicion of illegitimacy, Fantine’s story had always seemed dubious to him. But what was the good of mentioning that? To be paid for his silence? He had, or thought he had, something better than that to sell. And to come to Baron Pontmercy and without any proof to deliver this revelation, ‘Your wife is a bastard’, would in all likelihood have succeeded only in bringing the husband’s boot to meet the revealer’s backside.","However, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent of the married pair on the 16th of February, and through his own personal researches, he had succeeded in learning many things, and, from the depths of his own gloom, he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew. He had discovered, by dint of industry, or, at least, by dint of induction, he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he had easily reached the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was Cosette. But he meant to be discreet in that quarter. Who was Cosette? He did not know exactly himself. He did, indeed, catch an inkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine had always seemed to him equivocal; but what was the use of talking about that? in order to cause himself to be paid for his silence? He had, or thought he had, better wares than that for sale. And, according to all appearances, if he were to come and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation—and without proof: “Your wife is a bastard,” the only result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer.","Through his daughter Azelma, however, whom he had put upon the track of the couple married on the 16th of February, and through his own researches, he had succeeded in finding out many things and, from the depth of his darkness, he had been able to seize more than one mysterious clue.

"Brusquement, le soleil parut ; l’immense rayon de l’orient jaillit, et l’on eût dit qu’il mettait le feu à toutes ces têtes farouches. Les langues se délièrent ; un incendie de ricanements, de jurements et de chansons fit explosion. La large lumière horizontale coupa en deux toute la file, illuminant les têtes et les torses, laissant les pieds et les roues dans l’obscurité. Les pensées apparurent sur les visages ; ce moment fut épouvantable ; des démons visibles à masques tombés, des âmes féroces toutes nues. Éclairée, cette cohue resta ténébreuse. Quelques-uns, gais, avaient à la bouche des tuyaux de plume d’où ils soufflaient de la vermine sur la foule, choisissant les femmes ; l’aurore accentuait par la noirceur des ombres ces profils lamentables ; pas un de ces êtres qui ne fût difforme à force de misère ; et c’était si monstrueux qu’on eût dit que cela changeait la clarté du soleil en lueur d’éclair. La voiturée qui ouvrait le cortège avait entonné et psalmodiait à tue-tête avec une jovialité hagarde un pot-pourri de Désaugiers, alors fameux, la Vestale ; les arbres frémissaient lugubrement ; dans les contre-allées, des faces de bourgeois écoutaient avec une béatitude idiote ces gaudrioles chantées par des spectres.","Suddenly the sun appeared; the immense ray of the east sprang out, and one would have said that it set fire to all these savage heads. Tongues loosen; a fire of sneers, swears and songs erupted. The broad horizontal light bisected the entire line, illuminating heads and torsos, leaving feet and wheels in darkness. Thoughts appeared on the faces; this moment was terrible; visible demons with fallen masks, ferocious naked souls. Enlightened, this crowd remained dark. Some, gay, had feather pipes in their mouths from which they blew vermin on the crowd, choosing the women; the dawn accentuated by the blackness of the shadows these lamentable profiles; not one of these beings who was not deformed by dint of misery; and it was so monstrous that one would have said that it changed the brightness of the sun into a flash of lightning. The carriage which led the procession had intoned and chanted at the top of its voice with haggard joviality a medley of Désaugiers, then famous, La Vestale; the trees quivered mournfully; in the back alleys, the faces of bourgeois listened with idiotic bliss to these gaudrioles sung by specters.","Suddenly the sun appeared. A tremendous brightness spilled from the east and seemed to set all these savages alight. Tongues were loosened. There was an explosion of sniggering, swearing and singing. The broad horizontal beam cut the whole column in two, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and wheels in obscurity. Thoughts could be read on faces. It was a dreadful moment. Demons seen with their masks removed, brutal souls laid bare. Lit up, this mob remained sinister-looking. A cheerful few had quill pipes in their mouths which they used to blow vermin over the crowd, picking on the women. Dawn accentuated with dark shadows these appalling profiles. There was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by misery. And so monstrous a sight seemed to dim the sun’s brightness to a glimmer of lightning. The cartload at the head of the column had broken into song, and with frenetic jocularity were belting out the lyrics of a then famous medley by Désaugiers, ‘The Vestal Virgin’. The trees rustled mournfully. In the side-lanes running parallel to the highway, respectable citizens listened with idiotic delight on their faces to these bawdy songs sung by spectres.","Suddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orient burst forth, and one would have said that it had set fire to all those ferocious heads.

Thoughts made their appearance on these faces; it was a terrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed, fierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up, this wild throng remained in gloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows; there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness; and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun’s brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning. The wagon-load which headed the line had struck up a song, and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality, a pot-pourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called The Vestal; the trees shivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes, countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres.","Suddenly, the sun appeared; the immense radiance of the Orient burst forth, and one would have said that it set all these savage heads on fire.

"Il n’osait les appeler, un cri entendu pouvait tout perdre, il eut une idée, une dernière, une lueur ; il prit dans sa poche le bout de la corde de Brujon qu’il avait détaché de la cheminée du Bâtiment-Neuf, et le jeta dans l’enceinte de la palissade.","He dared not call them, a cry heard could ruin everything, he had an idea, a last, a gleam; he took from his pocket the end of Brujon's cord, which he had detached from the chimney of the Bâtiment-Neuf, and threw it into the enclosure of the palisade.","He dared not call out to them, a cry overheard might ruin everything. He had an idea, one last idea, one glimmer of an idea. He drew from his pocket Brujon’s bit of rope that he had untied from the chimney of the New Building, and threw it down inside the fenced area.","He dared not call to them; a cry might be heard and ruin everything.

"Il se trouva que l’amour qui se présenta était précisément celui qui convenait le mieux à l’état de son âme. C’était une sorte d’adoration à distance, une contemplation muette, la déification d’un inconnu. C’était l’apparition de l’adolescence à l’adolescence, le rêve des nuits devenu roman et resté rêve, le fantôme souhaité enfin réalisé et fait chair, mais n’ayant pas encore de nom, ni de tort, ni de tache, ni d’exigence, ni de défaut ; en un mot, l’amant lointain et demeuré dans l’idéal, une chimère ayant une forme. Toute rencontre plus palpable et plus proche eût à cette première époque effarouché Cosette, encore à demi plongée dans la brume grossissante du cloître. Elle avait toutes les peurs des enfants et toutes les peurs des religieuses mêlées. L’esprit du couvent, dont elle s’était pénétrée pendant cinq ans, s’évaporait encore lentement de toute sa personne et faisait tout trembler autour d’elle. Dans cette situation, ce n’était pas un amant qu’il lui fallait, ce n’était pas même un amoureux, c’était une vision. Elle se mit à adorer Marius comme quelque chose de charmant, de lumineux et d’impossible.","It turned out that the love that presented itself was precisely the one that best suited the state of his soul. It was a kind of adoration from a distance, a silent contemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the appearance of adolescence in adolescence, the dream of the nights become romance and remained dream, the desired ghost finally realized and made flesh, but not yet having a name, nor a wrong, nor a stain , neither of requirement, nor of defect; in a word, the distant and idealized lover, a chimera having a form. Any more palpable and nearer encounter would have frightened Cosette at this early stage, still half-immersed in the growing mist of the cloister. She had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns mixed together. The spirit of the convent, with which she had been imbued for five years, was still slowly evaporating from her whole person and made everything around her tremble. In this situation, it was not a lover he needed, it was not even a lover, it was a vision. She began to adore Marius as something charming, luminous and impossible.","It so happened that the love that visited itself on her was exactly the kind of love best suited to the state of her heart.

In a word, the distant lover still idealized, a chimera invested with form. Any closer and more palpable encounter would have affrighted Cosette at this initial stage when she was still half immersed in the magnifying mists of the cloister.

"Le passant qui s’engageait de la rue Saint-Denis dans la rue de la Chanvrerie la voyait peu à peu se rétrécir devant lui, comme s’il fût entré dans un entonnoir allongé.

Partez ! disparaissez ! Soyez heureux seulement, c’est tout ce que je désire. Ah ! monstre ! Voilà encore trois mille francs. Prenez-les.

Here are another three thousand francs. Take them. You will leave tomorrow, for America, with your daughter; for your wife is dead, you abominable liar. I will see to your departure, bandit, and I will charge you twenty thousand francs at that time.

I tell you that you’re the one guilty of all those crimes. Go away! Disappear! I just hope you’re successful. Ah, you monster! Here’s another three thousand francs. Take them.

"Le faubourg et sa redoute se prêtaient main-forte. Le faubourg s’épaulait à la redoute, la redoute s’acculait au faubourg. La vaste barricade s’étalait comme une falaise où venait se briser la stratégie des généraux d’Afrique. Ses cavernes, ses excroissances, ses verrues, ses gibbosités, grimaçaient, pour ainsi dire, et ricanaient sous la fumée. La mitraille s’y évanouissait dans l’informe ; les obus s’y enfonçaient, s’y engloutissaient, s’y engouffraient ; les boulets n’y réussissaient qu’à trouer des trous ; à quoi bon canonner le chaos ? Et les régiments, accoutumés aux plus farouches visions de la guerre, regardaient d’un œil inquiet cette espèce de redoute bête fauve, par le hérissement sanglier, et par l’énormité montagne.","The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other a hand. The faubourg shouldered the redoubt, the redoubt drove into the faubourg. The vast barricade stretched out like a cliff where the strategy of the generals of Africa had been shattered. Its caves, its excrescences, its warts, its humps, grimaced, so to speak, and snickered under the smoke. The grapeshot vanished there in the shapeless; the shells sank into it, were engulfed in it, were engulfed in it; the balls succeeded only in making holes in it; what's the use of cannonading chaos?

Shells sank into it, were swallowed up and lost in it. All that bullets succeeded in doing was to make holes in it. What was the use of cannonading chaos?

"― Allons, dit-il, il faut avoir un peu de pitié. Savez-vous de quoi il est question ici ? Il est question des femmes. Voyons. Y a-t-il des femmes, oui ou non ? y a-t-il des enfants, oui ou non ? y a-t-il, oui ou non, des mères, qui poussent des berceaux du pied et qui ont des tas de petits autour d’elles ? Que celui de vous qui n’a jamais vu le sein d’une nourrice lève la main. Ah ! vous voulez vous faire tuer, je le veux aussi, moi qui vous parle, mais je ne veux pas sentir des fantômes de femmes qui se tordent les bras autour de moi. Mourez, soit, mais ne faites pas mourir. Des suicides comme celui qui va s’accomplir ici sont sublimes, mais le suicide est étroit, et ne veut pas d’extension ; et dès qu’il touche à vos proches, le suicide s’appelle meurtre. Songez aux petites têtes blondes, et songez aux cheveux blancs. Écoutez, tout à l’heure Enjolras, il vient de me le dire, a vu au coin de la rue du Cygne une croisée éclairée, une chandelle à une pauvre fenêtre, au cinquième, et sur la vitre l’ombre toute branlante d’une tête de vieille femme qui avait l’air d’avoir passé la nuit et d’attendre. C’est peut-être la mère de l’un de vous. Eh bien, qu’il s’en aille, celui-là, et qu’il se dépêche d’aller dire à sa mère : Mère, me voilà ! Qu’il soit tranquille, on fera la besogne ici tout de même. Quand on soutient ses proches de son travail, on n’a plus le droit de se sacrifier. C’est déserter la famille, cela. Et ceux qui ont des filles, et ceux qui ont des sœurs ! Y pensez-vous ? Vous vous faites tuer, vous voilà morts, c’est bon, et demain ? Des jeunes filles qui n’ont pas de pain, cela est terrible. L’homme mendie, la femme vend. Ah ! ces charmants êtres si gracieux et si doux qui ont des bonnets de fleurs, qui emplissent la maison de chasteté, qui chantent, qui jasent, qui sont comme un parfum vivant, qui prouvent l’existence des anges dans le ciel par la pureté des vierges sur la terre, cette Jeanne, cette Lise, cette Mimi, ces adorables et honnêtes créatures qui sont votre bénédiction et votre orgueil, ah, mon Dieu, elles vont avoir faim ! Que voulez-vous que je vous dise ? Il y a un marché de chair humaine ; et ce nest pas avec vos mains d’ombres, frémissantes autour d’elles, que vous les empêcherez d’y entrer ! Songez à la rue, songez au pavé couvert de passants, songez aux boutiques devant lesquelles des femmes vont et viennent décolletées et dans la boue. Ces femmes-là aussi ont été pures. Songez à vos sœurs, ceux qui en ont. La misère, la prostitution, les sergents de ville, Saint-Lazare, voilà où vont tomber ces délicates belles filles, ces fragiles merveilles de pudeur, de gentillesse et de beauté, plus fraîches que les lilas du mois de mai. Ah ! vous vous êtes fait tuer ! ah ! vous n’êtes plus là ! C’est bien ; vous avez voulu soustraire le peuple à la royauté, vous donnez vos filles à la police. Amis, prenez garde, ayez de la compassion. Les femmes, les malheureuses femmes, on n’a pas l’habitude d’y songer beaucoup. On se fie sur ce que les femmes n’ont pas reçu l’éducation des hommes, on les empêche de lire, on les empêche de penser, on les empêche de s’occuper de politique ; les empêcherez-vous d’aller ce soir à la morgue et de reconnaître vos cadavres ? Voyons, il faut que ceux qui ont des familles soient bons enfants et nous donnent une poignée de main et s’en aillent, et nous laissent faire ici l’affaire tout seuls. Je sais bien qu’il faut du courage pour s’en aller, c’est difficile ; mais plus c’est difficile, plus c’est méritoire. On dit : J’ai un fusil, je suis à la barricade, tant pis, j’y reste. Tant pis, c’est bientôt dit. Mes amis, il y a un lendemain ; vous n’y serez pas à ce lendemain, mais vos familles y seront. Et que de souffrances ! Tenez, un joli enfant bien portant qui a des joues comme une pomme, qui babille, qui jacasse, qui jabote, qui rit, qu’on sent frais sous le baiser, savez-vous ce que cela devient quand c’est abandonné ? J’en ai vu un, tout petit, haut comme cela. Son père était mort. De pauvres gens l’avaient recueilli par charité, mais ils n’avaient pas de pain pour eux-mêmes. L’enfant avait toujours faim. C’était l’hiver. Il ne pleurait pas. On le voyait aller près du poêle où il n’y avait jamais de feu et dont le tuyau, vous savez, était mastiqué avec de la terre jaune. L’enfant détachait avec ses petits doigts un peu de cette terre et la mangeait. Il avait la respiration rauque, la face livide, les jambes molles, le ventre gros. Il ne disait rien. On lui parlait, il ne répondait pas. Il est mort. On l’a apporté mourir à l’hospice Necker, où je l’ai vu. J’étais interne à cet hospice-là. Maintenant, s’il y a des pères parmi vous, des pères qui ont pour bonheur de se promener le dimanche en tenant dans leur bonne main robuste la petite main de leur enfant, que chacun de ces pères se figure que cet enfant-là est le sien. Ce pauvre môme, je me le rappelle, il me semble que je le vois, quand il a été nu sur la table d’anatomie, ses côtes faisaient saillie sous sa peau comme les fosses sous l’herbe d’un cimetière. On lui a trouvé une espèce de boue dans l’estomac. Il avait de la cendre dans les dents. Allons, tâtons-nous en conscience et prenons conseil de notre cœur. Les statistiques constatent que la mortalité des enfants abandonnés est de cinquante-cinq pour cent. Je le répète, il s’agit des femmes, il s’agit des mères, il s’agit des jeunes filles, il s’agit des mioches. Est-ce qu’on vous parle de vous ? On sait bien ce que vous êtes ; on sait bien que vous êtes tous des braves, parbleu ! on sait bien que vous avez tous dans l’âme la joie et la gloire de donner votre vie pour la grande cause ; on sait bien que vous vous sentez élus pour mourir utilement et magnifiquement, et que chacun de vous tient à sa part du triomphe. A la bonne heure. Mais vous n’êtes pas seuls en ce monde. Il y a d’autres êtres auxquels il faut penser. Il ne faut pas être égoïstes.","―Come on, he said, you must have a little pity. Do you know what this is about? It is about women. Let's see. Are there women, yes or no? are there children, yes or no? are there, yes or no, mothers who push cradles with their feet and who have heaps of babies around them? Any of you that's never seen a nurse's breast, raise up your hand. Ah! you want to be killed, I want it too, I who speak to you, but I don't want to feel the ghosts of women wringing their arms around me. Die, be it, but don't kill. Suicides like the one that will take place here are sublime, but suicide is narrow, and does not want extension; and as soon as it touches your loved ones, suicide is called murder. Think of little blond heads, and think of white hair. Listen, just now Enjolras, he just told me, saw at the corner of the rue du Cygne a lighted window, a candle at a poor window, on the fifth floor, and on the pane the rickety shadow of a the face of an old woman who looked as if she had spent the night and was waiting. It may be the mother of one of you. Well, let that one go away and hurry up to tell his mother: Mother, here I am! Let him be quiet, we'll do the job here all the same. When you support your loved ones with your work, you no longer have the right to sacrifice yourself. That's deserting the family. And those who have daughters, and those who have sisters! Do you think about it? You get killed, you're dead, that's good, and tomorrow? Young girls who have no bread, that is terrible. The man begs, the woman sells. Ah! those charming beings, so gracious and so sweet, who have caps of flowers, who fill the house with chastity, who sing, who chatter, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, this Jeanne, this Lise, this Mimi, these adorable and honest creatures who are your blessing and your pride, ah, my God, they are going to be hungry! What do you want me to tell you? There is a market for human flesh; and it is not with your shadowy hands, quivering around them, that you will prevent them from entering! Think of the street, think of the pavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops in front of which women come and go, low-cut and in the mud. These women too were pure. Think of your sisters, those who have them. Misery, prostitution, policemen, Saint-Lazare, that's where these delicate beautiful girls will fall, these fragile marvels of modesty, kindness and beauty, fresher than the lilacs of May. Ah! you got yourself killed! ha! you are no longer there! It's good ; you wanted to save the people from royalty, you give your daughters to the police. Friends, take heed, have compassion. Women, unhappy women, we don't usually think about much. We trust that women have not received the education of men, we prevent them from reading, we prevent them from thinking, we prevent them from occupying themselves with politics; will you prevent them from going to the morgue tonight and recognizing your corpses? Why, those who have families must be good children and shake hands with us and go away, and leave us here to do our own thing. I know very well that it takes courage to leave, it is difficult; but the more difficult it is, the more meritorious it is. They say: I have a gun, I'm at the barricade, too bad, I'm staying there. Too bad, it's soon said. My friends, there is a tomorrow; you will not be there tomorrow, but your families will be there. And what suffering! Look, a pretty healthy child with cheeks like an apple, who chatters, who chatters, who jabbers, who laughs, who feels fresh under the kiss, do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned? I seen one, very small, high like that. His father was dead. Poor people had taken him in out of charity, but they had no bread for themselves. The child was still hungry. It was winter. He wasn't crying. We saw him go near the stove where there was never a fire and whose pipe, you know, was putty with yellow earth. The child used his little fingers to loosen a little of this earth and ate it. He had hoarse breathing, a livid face, limp legs, a big belly. He said nothing. We spoke to him, he did not answer. He is dead. He was brought to die at the Necker Hospice, where I saw him. I was an intern at that hospice. Now, if there are fathers among you, fathers who have the good fortune to walk on Sundays holding in their good sturdy hand the little hand of their child, let each of these fathers imagine that this child is his. This poor kid, I remember him, I seem to see him, when he was naked on the anatomy table, his ribs protruding from under his skin like the pits under the grass of a cemetery. They found a kind of mud in his stomach. He had ashes in his teeth. Come, let us feel our conscience and take advice from our hearts. Statistics show that the mortality of abandoned children is fifty-five percent. I repeat, it's about women, it's about mothers, it's about young girls, it's about kids. Do we talk to you about you? We know well what you are; we know very well that you are all brave, parbleu! it is well known that you all have in your soul the joy and the glory of giving your life for the great cause; it is well known that you feel chosen to die usefully and magnificently, and that each of you holds to his share of the triumph. All in good time. But you are not alone in this world. There are other beings to think about. You don't have to be selfish.","‘Come now, we must have a little pity,’ he said. ‘You know what’s at issue here? What’s at issue is women. Just consider. Are there women, yes or no? Are there children, yes or no? Are there mothers rocking cradles with their foot, and a whole brood of little ones around them, yes or no? Any one of you who has never seen the breast of a nursing woman, raise his hand. Ah! you want to get yourselves killed, and as I stand here talking to you, I do too. But I don’t want to sense around me the spectres of women wringing their hands. Die, that’s fine, but don’t cause others to die. Suicides like the one that is about to take place here are sublime, but suicide has a narrow compass that is not to be broadened. And as soon as it affects your family, suicide is murder. Think of the fair-haired youngsters, and think of the white-haired old folk. Listen. A little while ago, Enjolras has just told me, he saw at the corner of Rue du Cygne a lighted casement, a candle at a humble fifth-floor window, and on the glass the quivering shadow of someone’s head, that of an old lady who appeared to have been sitting up all night, waiting. Perhaps she’s the mother of one of you. Well, that man should leave, and hurry home to tell his mother, “Mother, here I am!” He needn’t worry, the job here will get done anyway. When it’s your work that’s supporting your family, you’ve no right to sacrifice yourself. Desertion of your family, that is. And those who have daughters, and those who have sisters! What are you thinking of? You get yourselves killed, then you’re dead, fine – and tomorrow? Young girls with nothing to eat, that’s terrible. A man begs, a woman sells. Ah! these delightful creatures, so charming and so gentle, who wear flowery bonnets, who sing, who chatter, who fill the house with chastity, who are like a living fragrance, who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, this Jeanne, this Lise, this Mimi, these adorable and respectable individuals who are a blessing to you, who are your pride, oh my God, they’ll go hungry! What can I say to you? There is a market for human flesh, and it’s not with your ghostly hands fluttering around them that you’ll prevent them from becoming part of it! Think of the street, think of the pavement thronged with passers-by, think of the shops and the women to-ing and fro-ing in front of them, revealingly clothed, women who have gone to the bad. Those women, too, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you who have them. Misery, prostitution, police patrols, St-Lazare, that’s what they’ll be reduced to, those lovely delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty, kindness and beauty, fresher than lilacs in the month of May. Ah, you’ve got yourselves killed! Ah, you’re not there any more! That’s fine. You wanted to deliver the people from royalty, and you hand your young girls over to the police. Friends, beware! Have some compassion! We’re not given to thinking about women very much. Poor women! We put our trust in the fact that women don’t get the education that men do, we prevent them from reading, we prevent them from thinking, we prevent them from being involved in politics. Will you prevent them from going to the morgue this evening to identify your bodies? Now then, those who have families must do the decent thing, shake hands with us and go, and leave us here to deal with this on our own. I know that it takes courage to go, it’s hard, but the harder it is, the more praiseworthy. You say: “I have a gun, I’m at the barricade, too bad, I’m staying here.” “Too bad” is easily said. My friends, there is a tomorrow, you won’t be here for that tomorrow, but your families will. And the suffering! Look, a fine healthy child with apple cheeks, who babbles, who prattles, who chatters, who laughs, whose smell you breathe in when you kiss him – you know what happens to him when he’s abandoned? I’ve seen one like him, a tiny little thing, just so high. His father was dead. He was taken in out of charity by poor people, but they had no bread for themselves. The child was always hungry. It was winter. He didn’t cry. You’d see him go up to the stove, where there was never any fire, and the stove pipe was sealed, you know, with yellow clay. The child would pick off a bit of this clay with his little fingers and eat it. His breathing was raspy, his face ashen, his legs weak, his stomach swollen. He said nothing. When you spoke to him, he didn’t answer. He died. He was brought to the Necker Hospital to die – that’s where I saw him. I was house-physician at that hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among you, fathers whose joy it is to go for a stroll on Sundays holding their child’s little hand in their own good strong hand, let every one of those fathers picture to himself that child as his own. That poor little mite , I remember him, I seem to see him now, when he lay naked on the autopsy table, his ribs protruding under his skin like the grass-covered mounds in a cemetery. There was some sort of mud found in his stomach. There was ash in his teeth. Now, let’s examine our consciences and allow our hearts to advise us. Statistics demonstrate that the mortality rate among abandoned children is fifty-five per cent. I repeat, what is at issue here is women, what is at issue is mothers, what is at issue is young girls, what is at issue is little kiddies. Is it you we’re talking about? We know what you are. We know that you’re all courageous men, by God! We know that you all set your minds on the joy and the honour of sacrificing your life for the great cause. We know that you feel you’ve been chosen to die usefully and magnificently, and that each one of you is determined to have his share of the glory. Good for you! But you’re not alone in this world. There are others you have to think of. You must not be selfish.’","“Come,” said he, “you must have a little pity. Do you know what the question is here? It is a question of women. See here. Are there women or are there not? Are there children or are there not? Are there mothers, yes or no, who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot of little ones around them? Let that man of you who has never beheld a nurse’s breast raise his hand. Ah! you want to get yourselves killed, so do I—I, who am speaking to you; but I do not want to feel the phantoms of women wreathing their arms around me. Die, if you will, but don’t make others die. Suicides like that which is on the brink of accomplishment here are sublime; but suicide is narrow, and does not admit of extension; and as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicide is murder. Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks. Listen, Enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the Rue du Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window, on the fifth floor, and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman, who had the air of having spent the night in watching. Perhaps she is the mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, and make haste, to say to his mother: ‘Here I am, mother!’ Let him feel at ease, the task here will be performed all the same. When one supports one ’s relatives by one’s toil, one has not the right to sacrifice one’s self. That is deserting one’s family. And those who have daughters! what are you thinking of? You get yourselves killed, you are dead, that is well. And tomorrow? Young girls without bread—that is a terrible thing. Man begs, woman sells. Ah! those charming and gracious beings, so gracious and so sweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with purity, who sing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, that Jeanne, that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures who are your blessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer hunger! What do you want me to say to you? There is a market for human flesh; and it is not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them, that you will prevent them from entering it! Think of the street, think of the pavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops past which women go and come with necks all bare, and through the mire. These women, too, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you who have them. Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare—that is what those beautiful, delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty, gentleness and loveliness, fresher than lilacs in the month of May, will come to. Ah! you have got yourselves killed! You are no longer on hand! That is well; you have wished to release the people from Royalty, and you deliver over your daughters to the police. Friends, have a care, have mercy. Women, unhappy women, we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought on them. We trust to the women not having received a man’s education, we prevent their reading, we prevent their thinking, we prevent their occupying themselves with politics; will you prevent them from going to the dead-house this evening, and recognizing your bodies? Let us see, those who have families must be tractable, and shake hands with us and take themselves off, and leave us here alone to attend to this affair. I know well that courage is required to leave, that it is hard; but the harder it is, the more meritorious. You say: ‘I have a gun, I am at the barricade; so much the worse, I shall remain there.’ So much the worse is easily said. My friends, there is a morrow; you will not be here to-morrow, but your families will; and what sufferings! See, here is a pretty, healthy child, with cheeks like an apple, who babbles, prattles, chatters, who laughs, who smells sweet beneath your kiss,—and do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned? I have seen one, a very small creature, no taller than that. His father was dead. Poor people had taken him in out of charity, but they had bread only for themselves. The child was always hungry. It was winter. He did not cry. You could see him approach the stove, in which there was never any fire, and whose pipe, you know, was of mastic and yellow clay. His breathing was hoarse, his face livid, his limbs flaccid, his belly prominent. He said nothing. If you spoke to him, he did not answer. He is dead. He was taken to the Necker Hospital, where I saw him. I was house-surgeon in that hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among you, fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on Sundays holding their child’s tiny hand in their robust hand, let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own. That poor brat, I remember, and I seem to see him now, when he lay nude on the dissecting table, how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was found in his stomach. There were ashes in his teeth. Come, let us examine ourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart. Statistics show that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty-five per cent. I repeat, it is a question of women, it concerns mothers, it concerns young girls, it concerns little children. Who is talking to you of yourselves? We know well what you are; we know well that you are all brave, parbleu! we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and the glory of giving your life for the great cause ; we know well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently, and that each one of you clings to his share in the triumph. Very well. But you are not alone in this world. There are other beings of whom you must think. You must not be egoists.”","“Come,” said he, “we must have a little pity. Do you know what the question is now? It is a question of women. Let us see. Are there any wives, yes or no? are there any children, yes or no? Are there, yes or no, any mothers, who rock the cradle with their foot and who have heaps of little ones about them? Let him among you who have never seen the breast of a nursing-woman hold up his hand. Ah! you wish to die, I wish it also, I, who am speaking to you, but I do not wish to feel the ghosts of women wringing their hands about me. Die, so be it, but do not make others die. Suicides like those which will be accomplished here are sublime; but suicide is strict, and can have no extension; and as soon as it touches those next you, the name of suicide is murder. Think of the little flaxen heads, and think of the white hairs. Listen, but a moment ago, Enjolras, he just told me of it, saw at the corner of the Rue du Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window, in the fifth story, and on the glass the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman who appeared to have passed the night in watching and to be still waiting. She is perhaps the mother of one of you. Well, let that man go away, and let him hasten to say to his mother: ‘Mother, here I am!’ Let him feel at ease, the work here will be done just as well. When a man supports his relatives by his labour, he has no right to sacrifice himself. That is deserting his family. And those who have daughters, and those who have sisters! Do you think of it? You get killed, here you are dead, very well, and to-morrow? Young girls who have no bread, that is terrible. Man begs, woman sells. Ah! those charming beings, so graceful and so sweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with chastity, who sing, who prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of maidens on the earth, that Jeanne, that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and noble creatures who are your benediction and your pride, oh, God, they will be hungry! What would you have me say to you? There is a market for human flesh; and it is not with your shadowy hands, fluttering about them, that you can prevent them from entering it! Think of the street, think of the pavement covered with passers, think of the shops before which women walk to and fro with bare shoulders, through the mud. Those women also have been pure. Think of your sisters, those who have them. Misery, prostitution, the sergents de ville, Saint Lazare, such will be the fall of those delicate beautiful girls, those fragile wonders of modesty, grace, and beauty, fresher than the lilacs of the month of May. Ah! you are killed! ah! you are no longer with them! Very well; you desired to deliver the people from monarchy, you give your maidens to the police. Friends, beware, have compassion. Women, hapless women, are not in the habit of reflecting much. We boast that women have not received the education of men, we prevent them from reading, we prevent them from thinking, we prevent them from interesting themselves in politics; will you prevent them from going tonight to the Morgue and identifying your corpses? Come, those who have families must be good fellows and give us a grasp of the hand and go away, and leave us to the business here all alone. I know well that it requires courage to go , it is difficult; but the more difficult it is, the more praiseworthy. You say: I have a musket, I am at the barricade, come the worst, I stay. Come the worst, that is very soon said. My friends, there is a morrow; you will not be here on that morrow, but your families will. And what suffering! See, a pretty, healthy child that has cheeks like an apple, that babbles, that prattles, that jabbers, that laughs, that smells sweet under the kiss, do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned? I saw one, very small, no taller than that. His father was dead. Some poor people had taken him in from charity, but they had no bread for themselves. The child was always hungry. It was winter. He did not cry. They saw him go up to the stove where there was never any fire, and the pipe of which, you know, was plastered with yellow clay. The child picked off some of that clay with his little fingers and ate it. His breathing was hard, his face livid, his legs soft, his belly big, He said nothing. They spoke to him, he did not answer. He died. He was brought to the Necker Hospital to die, where I saw him. I was surgeon at that hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among you, fathers whose delight it is to take a walk on Sunday holding in their great strong hand the little hand of their child, let each of those fathers imagine that that child is his own. That poor bird, I remember him well, it seems to me that I see him now, when he lay naked upon the dissecting table, his ribs projecting under his skin like graves under the grass of a church-yard. We found a kind of mud in his stomach. There were ashes in his teeth. Come, let us search our conscience and take counsel with our hearts. Statistics show that the mortality of abandoned children is fifty-five per cent. I repeat it, it is a question of wives, it is a question of mothers, it is a question of young girls, it is a question of babes. Do I speak to you for yourselves? We know very well what you are; we know very well that you are all brave, good heavens! we know very well that your souls are filled with joy and glory at giving your life for the great cause; we know very well that you feel that you are elected to die usefully and magnificently, and that each of you clings to his share of the triumph. Well and good. But you are not alone in this world. There are other beings of whom we must think. We must not be selfish.”"

"Cela dit, Gavroche s’en alla, ou, pour mieux dire, reprit vers le lieu d’où il venait son vol d’oiseau échappé. Il se replongea dans l’obscurité comme s’il y faisait un trou, avec la rapidité rigide d’un projectile ; la ruelle de l’Homme-Armé redevint silencieuse et solitaire ; en un clin d’œil, cet étrange enfant, qui avait de l’ombre et du rêve en lui, s’était enfoncé dans la brume de ces rangées de maisons noires, et s’y était perdu comme de la fumée dans des ténèbres ; et l’on eût pu le croire dissipé et évanoui, si, quelques minutes après sa disparition, une éclatante cassure de vitre et le patatras splendide d’un réverbère croulant sur le pavé n’eussent brusquement réveillé de nouveau les bourgeois indignés. C’était Gavroche qui passait rue du Chaume.","That said, Gavroche departed, or, to speak more correctly, resumed his escaped bird's flight towards the place whence he came. He plunged back into the darkness as if making a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the lane of the Homme-Armé became silent and solitary again; in the twinkling of an eye, this strange child, who had shadows and dreams in him, had sunk into the mist of these rows of black houses, and was lost there like smoke in the darkness. ; and one might have thought him dissipated and vanished, if, a few minutes after his disappearance, a dazzling break in the pane of glass and the splendid crash of a street lamp crumbling on the pavement had not suddenly awakened the indignant bourgeois again. It was Gavroche, who was passing Rue du Chaume.","That said, Gavroche set off again, or rather he winged his way back to where he had come from like an escaped bird returning home. As if piercing a hole in it, he shot off into the darkness with the undeviating speed of a projectile. That little street, l’Homme-Armé, became silent and desolate once again. In a twinkling that strange child, with dream and shadow in his make-up, had plunged into the gloom of those rows of dark houses and disappeared into the obscurity like smoke. And you might have thought he had melted away into nothingness if, a few minutes after his disappearance, an explosion of shattering glass and the glorious clatter of a lantern falling on to the street had not once again rudely awakened the indignant bourgeois residents. It was Gavroche making his way along Rue du Chaume.","That said, Gavroche took himself off, or, to describe it more exactly, fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like that of an escaped bird. He plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley of l’Homme Armé became silent and solitary once more; in a twinkling, that strange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, and was lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few minutes after his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche upon his way through the Rue du Chaume.","This said, Gavroche went away, or rather, resumed his flight like an escaped bird towards the spot whence he came. He replunged into the obscurity as if he made a hole in it, with the rapidity and precision of a projectile; the little Rue de l’Homme Armé again became silent and solitary; in a twinkling, this strange child, who had within him shadow and dream, was buried in the dusk of those rows of black houses, and was lost therein like smoke in the darkness; and one might have thought him dissipated and vanished, if, a few minutes after his disappearance, a loud crashing of glass and the splendid patatras of a lamp falling upon the pavement had not abruptly reawakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche passing along the Rue du Chaume."

"Quelques jours après, un matin, comme il faisait beau soleil et qu’ils étaient tous deux sur le perron du jardin, autre infraction aux règles que semblait s’être imposées Jean Valjean, et à l’habitude de rester dans sa chambre que la tristesse avait fait prendre à Cosette, Cosette, en peignoir, se tenait debout dans ce négligé de la première heure qui enveloppe adorablement les jeunes filles et qui a l’air du nuage sur l’astre ; et, la tête dans la lumière, rose d’avoir bien dormi, regardée doucement par le bonhomme attendri, elle effeuillait une pâquerette. Cosette ignorait la ravissante légende je t’aime un peu, passionnément, etc. ; qui la lui eût apprise ? Elle maniait cette fleur, d’instinct, innocemment, sans se douter qu’effeuiller une pâquerette, c’est éplucher un cœur. S’il y avait une quatrième Grâce appelée la Mélancolie, et souriante, elle eût eu l’air de cette Grâce-là. Jean Valjean était fasciné par la contemplation de ces petits doigts sur cette fleur, oubliant tout dans le rayonnement que cette enfant avait. Un rouge-gorge chuchotait dans la broussaille d’à côté. Des nuées blanches traversaient le ciel si gaîment qu’on eût dit qu’elles venaient d’être mises en liberté. Cosette continuait d’effeuiller sa fleur attentivement ; elle semblait songer à quelque chose ; mais cela devait être charmant ; tout à coup elle tourna la tête sur son épaule avec la lenteur délicate du cygne, et dit à Jean Valjean : Père, qu’est-ce que c’est donc que cela, les galères ?","A few days later, one morning, as the sun was shining and they were both on the garden steps, another breach of the rules that Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed on himself, and of the habit of staying in his room that the sadness had made Cosette take it, Cosette, in a bathrobe, stood upright in that negligee of the first hour which adorably envelops young girls and which looks like a cloud on the star; and, her head in the light, rosy from having slept well, watched gently by the tender fellow, she was picking the leaves from a daisy. Cosette was unaware of the delightful legend I love you a little, passionately, etc. ; who would have taught it to him? She handled this flower, instinctively, innocently, without suspecting that to peel a daisy is to peel a heart. If there was a fourth Grace called Melancholy, and smiling, she would have looked like that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of these little fingers on this flower, forgetting everything in the radiance that this child had. A robin was whispering in the brush nearby. White clouds crossed the sky so cheerfully that one would have said that they had just been set free. Cosette continued to pluck her flower attentively; she seemed to be thinking of something; but it must have been charming; suddenly she turned her head on her shoulder with the delicate slowness of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean: Father, what are these galleys?","One morning a few days later the sun was shining brightly, and in another departure from the rules that Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed on himself, and a departure too from the habit of remaining in her room that Cosette’s sadness had led her to adopt, they were both out on the garden steps. Cosette stood in her dressing-gown with that early-morning carelessness of appearance that is enchanting in a young girl, enveloping her rather like a cloud settled over a heavenly body. And with the light around her head, rosy from a good night’s sleep and watched lovingly by the fond old man, she was plucking the petals from a daisy. Cosette was unacquainted with that charming folklore tradition, ‘He loves me, he loves me not’ – who would have told her about it? She was toying with the flower instinctively, innocently, with no inkling that to pluck the petals from a daisy is to peel open a heart. If there were a fourth, smiling, Grace called Melancholy she would have borne a resemblance to that Grace. Jean Valjean gazed, spellbound, at those little fingers on that flower, forgetting everything in the radiance this child possessed. A robin chirped in the bushes near by. White clouds scudded across the sky so gaily that they looked as if they had just been set free. Cosette continued intently plucking at her flower. She seemed to be musing on something, but it must have been something pleasant. Suddenly she looked back over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean, ‘Father, what exactly are the prison hulks?’","Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and they were both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused Cosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star; and, with her head bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man, she was picking a daisy to pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful legend, I love a little, passionately, etc.—who was there who could have taught her? She was handling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If there were a fourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, she would have worn the air of that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower, and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child. A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, on one side. White cloudlets floated across the sky, so gayly, that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty. Cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower; she seemed to be thinking about something; but whatever it was, it must be something charming; all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean: “Father, what are the galleys like?”","Some days later, one morning, when the sun was bright, and they were both upon the garden steps, another infraction of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, and of the habit of staying in her room which sadness had imposed upon Cosette, Cosette, in her dressing-gown, was standing in that undress of the morning hour which is charmingly becoming to young girls, and which has the appearance of a cloud upon a star; and, with her head in the light, rosy from having slept well, under the tender gaze of the gentle goodman, she was picking a daisy in pieces. Cosette was ignorant of the transporting legend, I love thee a little, passionately, etc.; who should have taught it to her? She was fingering this flower, by instinct, innocently, without suspecting that to pick a daisy in pieces is to pluck a heart. Were there a fourth Grace named Melancholy, and were it smiling, she would have seemed that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of her slender fingers upon that flower, forgetting everything in the radiance of this child. A redbreast was twittering in the shrubbery beside them. White clouds were crossing the sky so gaily that one would have said they had just been set at liberty. Cosette continued picking her flower attentively; she seemed to be thinking of something; but that must have been pleasant. Suddenly she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate motion of the swan, and said to Jean Valjean: “Father, what are they then, the galley-slaves?”"

"Les attroupements, comme on sait, font boule de neige et agglomèrent en roulant un tas d’hommes tumultueux. Ces hommes ne se demandent pas entre eux d’où ils viennent. Parmi les passants qui s’étaient réunis au rassemblement conduit par Enjolras, Combeferre et Courfeyrac, il y avait un être portant la veste du portefaix usée aux épaules, qui gesticulait et vociférait et avait la mine d’une espèce d’ivrogne sauvage.

"Quand on détourne de la rue des Ballets dans la rue du Roi-de-Sicile, on rencontre presque tout de suite à droite un enfoncement sordide. Il y avait là au siècle dernier une maison dont il ne reste plus que le mur de fond, véritable mur de masure qui s’élève à la hauteur d’un troisième étage entre les bâtiments voisins. Cette ruine est reconnaissable à deux grandes fenêtres carrées qu’on y voit encore ; celle du milieu, la plus proche du pignon de droite, est barrée d’une solive vermoulue ajustée en chevron d’étai. A travers ces fenêtres on distinguait autrefois une haute muraille lugubre qui était un morceau de l’enceinte du chemin de ronde de la Force.","When you turn from the rue des Ballets into the rue du Roi-de-Sicile, you almost immediately encounter a sordid depression on the right. There was a house there in the last century of which only the back wall remains, a veritable hovel wall which rises to the height of a third floor between the neighboring buildings. This ruin is recognizable by two large square windows that can still be seen there; the middle one, closest to the right-hand gable, is barred with a worm-eaten joist fitted like a forestay rafter. Through these windows one could once make out a lugubrious high wall which was a piece of the enclosure of the walkway of La Force.","When you turn off Rue des Ballets into Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, you come almost at once to a squalid gap. In the last century there was a house here, of which all that remains is the back wall, the wall of a real barn of a place, rising between the adjoining buildings to third-floor level. This ruin is recognizable by the two large square windows still to be seen in it. The one in the middle, nearest the right-end gable, is barred with a worm-eaten beam, set strut-wise inside it. Through these windows you used to be able to see a grim high wall that was a section of La Force’s perimeter wall.","When one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin.

This ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen there; the middle one, that nearest the right gable, is barred with a worm-eaten beam adjusted like a prop. Through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall, which was a fragment of the outer wall of La Force.","On turning from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi de Sicile, on the right you meet almost immediately with a dirty recess. There was a house there in the last century, of which only the rear wall remains, a genuine ruin wall which rises to the height of the third story among the neighbouring buildings. This ruin can be recognised by two large square windows which may still be seen; the one in the middle, nearer the right gable, is crossed by a worm-eaten joist fitted like a cap-piece for a shore. Through these windows could formerly be discerned a high and dismal wall, which was a part of the encircling wall of La Force."
"Lorsqu’il s’agit de sonder une plaie, un gouffre ou une société, depuis quand est-ce un tort de descendre trop avant, d’aller au fond ? Nous avions toujours pensé que c’était quelquefois un acte de courage, et tout au moins une action simple et utile, digne de l’attention sympathique que mérite le devoir accepté et accompli.

"On s’en souvient, Jean Valjean était heureux dans le couvent, si heureux que sa conscience finit par s’inquiéter. Il voyait Cosette tous les jours, il sentait la paternité naître et se développer en lui de plus en plus, il couvait de l’âme cette enfant, il se disait qu’elle était à lui, que rien ne pouvait la lui enlever, que cela serait ainsi indéfiniment, que certainement elle se ferait religieuse, y étant chaque jour doucement provoquée, qu’ainsi le couvent était désormais l’univers pour elle comme pour lui, qu’il y vieillirait et qu’elle y grandirait, qu’elle y vieillirait et qu’il y mourrait, qu’enfin, ravissante espérance, aucune séparation n’était possible. En réfléchissant à ceci, il en vint à tomber dans des perplexités. Il s’interrogea. Il se demandait si tout ce bonheur était bien à lui, s’il ne se composait pas du bonheur d’un autre, du bonheur de cette enfant qu’il confisquait et qu’il dérobait, lui vieillard ; si ce n’était point là un vol ? Il se disait que cette enfant avait le droit de connaître la vie avant d’y renoncer, que lui retrancher, d’avance et en quelque sorte sans la consulter, toutes les joies sous prétexte de lui sauver toutes les épreuves, profiter de son ignorance et de son isolement pour lui faire germer une vocation artificielle, c’était dénaturer une créature humaine et mentir à Dieu. Et qui sait si, se rendant compte un jour de tout cela et religieuse à regret, Cosette n’en viendrait pas à le haïr ? Dernière pensée, presque égoïste et moins héroïque que les autres, mais qui lui était insupportable. Il résolut de quitter le couvent.","We remember, Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so happy that his conscience ended up worrying. He saw Cosette every day, he felt paternity being born and developing more and more within him, his soul nurtured this child, he told himself that she was his, that nothing could take her away from him, that it would be so indefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being gently challenged to it every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as for him, that he would grow old there and that she would grow up there, that she would grow old there and die there, that finally, ravishing hope, no separation was possible. Reflecting on this, he came to fall into perplexities. He wondered. He wondered if all this happiness was really his own, if it were not made up of the happiness of another, of the happiness of this child whom he was confiscating and stealing, he old man; if this was not a robbery? He said to himself that this child had the right to know life before renouncing it, that taking away from her, in advance and in a way without consulting her, all the joys under the pretext of saving her all the trials, taking advantage of her ignorance and of his isolation to make him germinate an artificial vocation, it was to denature a human creature and to lie to God. And who knows if, realizing all this one day and reluctantly religious, Cosette would not come to hate him? Last thought, almost selfish and less heroic than the others, but which was unbearable to him. He resolved to leave the convent.","Remember, Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so happy that his conscience eventually became troubled. He saw Cosette every day. He felt more and more a sense of paternity begin to grow and develop in him. He cherished that child. He told himself that she was his, that nothing could take her away from him, that it would be like this indefinitely. She would surely become a nun, being gently encouraged to do so every day; and, that being the case, the convent was now her universe, as it was his. He would grow old here and she would grow up here. She would grow old here and he would die here. In short – blissful expectation! – no separation was possible. Reflecting on this resulted in his falling into a state of perplexity. He questioned himself. He wondered if all this happiness really belonged to him, if it was not made up of someone else’s happiness – this child’s happiness which he in his old age was confiscating and appropriating – and if this was not robbery. He told himself, this child had a right to experience life before renouncing it, that to deprive her in advance of all the joys of life, and to some extent without consulting her, under the pretext of sparing her from all its tribulations, to take advantage of her ignorance and her isolation in order to foster in her a spurious vocation, was to pervert the nature of a human being and to lie to God. And who knows if Cosette, understanding all this some day and wishing she had not become a nun, would not come to hate him? A last thought, this; almost selfish and less heroic than the others, but one that was intolerable to him. He decided to leave the convent.","It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so happy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every day, he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more, he brooded over the soul of that child, he said to himself that she was his, that nothing could take her from him, that this would last indefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being thereto gently incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was for him, that he should grow old there, and that she would grow up there, that she would grow old there, and that he should die there; that, in short, delightful hope, no separation was possible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity. He interrogated himself. He asked himself if all that happiness were really his, if it were not composed of the happiness of another, of the happiness of that child which he, an old man, was confiscating and stealing; if that were not theft? He said to himself, that this child had a right to know life before renouncing it, that to deprive her in advance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys, under the pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her ignorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in her, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie to God. And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all this some day, and found herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come to hate him? A last, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the rest, but which was intolerable to him. He resolved to quit the convent.","As we remember, Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so happy that his conscience at last began to be troubled.

And who knows but, thinking over all this some day, and being a nun with regret, Cosette might come to hate him? a final thought, which was almost selfish and less heroic than the others, but which was insupportable to him.

"Et puis, elle aimait son père, c’est-à-dire Jean Valjean, de toute son âme, avec une naïve passion filiale qui lui faisait du bonhomme un compagnon désiré et charmant. On se souvient que M. Madeleine lisait beaucoup, Jean Valjean avait continué ; il en était venu à causer bien ; il avait la richesse secrète et l’éloquence d’une intelligence humble et vraie qui s’est spontanément cultivée. Il lui était resté juste assez d’âpreté pour assaisonner sa bonté ; c’était un esprit rude et un cœur doux.

"Il y avait au Châtelet de Paris une grande cave longue. Cette cave était à huit pieds en contre-bas au-dessous du niveau de la Seine. Elle n’avait ni fenêtres ni soupiraux, l’unique ouverture était la porte ; les hommes pouvaient y entrer, l’air non. Cette cave avait pour plafond une voûte de pierre et pour plancher dix pouces de boue. Elle avait été dallée ; mais, sous le suintement des eaux, le dallage s’était pourri et crevassé. A huit pieds au-dessus du sol, une longue poutre massive traversait ce souterrain de part en part ; de cette poutre tombaient, de distance en distance, des chaînes de trois pieds de long, et à l’extrémité de ces chaînes il y avait des carcans. On mettait dans cette cave les hommes condamnés aux galères jusqu’au jour du départ pour Toulon. On les poussait sous cette poutre où chacun avait son ferrement oscillant dans les ténèbres, qui l’attendait. Les chaînes, ces bras pendants, et les carcans, ces mains ouvertes, prenaient ces misérables par le cou. On les rivait, et on les laissait là. La chaîne étant trop courte, ils ne pouvaient se coucher. Ils restaient immobiles dans cette cave, dans cette nuit, sous cette poutre, presque pendus, obligés à des efforts inouïs pour atteindre au pain ou à la cruche, la voûte sur la tête, la boue jusqu’à mi-jambe, leurs excréments coulant sur leurs jarrets, écartelés de fatigue, ployant aux hanches et aux genoux, s’accrochant par les mains à la chaîne pour se reposer, ne pouvant dormir que debout, et réveillés à chaque instant par l’étranglement du carcan ; quelques-uns ne se réveillaient pas. Pour manger, ils faisaient monter avec leur talon le long de leur tibia jusqu’à leur main leur pain qu’on leur jetait dans la boue. Combien de temps demeuraient-ils ainsi ? Un mois, deux mois, six mois quelquefois ; un resta une année. C’était l’antichambre des galères. On était mis là pour un lièvre volé au roi. Dans ce sépulcre enfer, que faisaient-ils ? Ce qu’on peut faire dans un sépulcre, ils agonisaient, et ce qu’on peut faire dans un enfer, ils chantaient. Car où il n’y a plus l’espérance, le chant reste. Dans les eaux de Malte, quand une galère approchait, on entendait le chant avant d’entendre les rames. Le pauvre braconnier Survincent qui avait traversé la prison-cave du Châtelet disait : Ce sont les rimes qui m’ont soutenu. Inutilité de la poésie. A quoi bon la rime ? C’est dans cette cave que sont nées presque toutes les chansons d’argot. C’est du cachot du Grand-Châtelet de Paris que vient le mélancolique refrain de la galère de Montgomery : Timaloumisaine, timoulamison. La plupart de ces chansons sont lugubres ; quelques-unes sont gaies ; une est tendre :","There was a large long cellar at the Châtelet de Paris. This cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither windows nor ventilators, the only opening was the door; men could enter, air not. This cellar had a stone vault for ceiling and ten inches of mud for floor. It had been paved; but, under the seepage of the waters, the pavement had rotted and cracked. Eight feet above the ground, a long massive beam crossed this tunnel from one end to the other; from this beam fell, at intervals, chains three feet long, and at the end of these chains there were yokes. The men condemned to the galleys were put in this cellar until the day of departure for Toulon. They were pushed under this beam where each had his ironwork oscillating in the darkness, waiting for him. The chains, these hanging arms, and the yokes, these open hands, took these wretches by the neck. We riveted them, and we left them there. The chain being too short, they could not lie down. They remained motionless in this cellar, in this night, under this beam, almost hanging, forced to make incredible efforts to reach for the bread or the jug, the vault over their heads, the mud up to mid-leg, their excrement flowing on their knees, torn from fatigue, bending at the hips and knees, clinging by the hands to the chain to rest, unable to sleep except standing up, and constantly awakened by the strangulation of the yoke; some did not wake up. To eat, they pushed their heel up their shin up to their hand and threw their bread into the mud. How long did they remain like this? A month, two months, sometimes six months; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys. We were put there for a hare stolen from the king. In this sepulcher hell, what were they doing? What can be done in a grave, they were dying, and what can be done in a hell, they were singing. Because where there is no longer hope, the song remains. In the waters of Malta, when a galley approached, you heard the song before you heard the oars. The poor poacher Survincent who had passed through the Châtelet prison-cellar said: These are the rhymes that sustained me. Uselessness of poetry. What good is rhyme? It is in this cellar that almost all slang songs were born. It is from the dungeon of the Grand-Châtelet in Paris that comes the melancholy refrain of Montgomery's galley: Timaloumisaine, timoulamison. Most of these songs are mournful; some are gay; one is tender:","At the Châtelet in Paris there was a big long cellar. This cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither windows nor air-vents, the only opening was the door. Men could enter, air could not. This cellar had a stone vault for a ceiling and ten inches of mud for a floor. It had been flagged, but under the seeping water the flagstones had crumbled and cracked. Eight feet above the ground a long massive beam ran right across this basement. From this beam at regular intervals hung chains three feet long, and at the end of these chains were iron collars. Men who had been condemned to the prison hulks were put in this cellar until the day of departure for Toulon. They were shoved under this beam, where each had waiting for him, swinging in the dark, his restraints. The chains, those dangling arms, and the iron collars, those open hands, caught these wretches by the throat. They were shackled, and left there. As the chains were too short, they could not lie down. They stood motionless in that cellar, in that darkness, below that beam, virtually hanged, having to make unbelievable efforts to reach their bread or their jug, with the vault overhead, mud halfway up their legs, their own excrement running down the backs of their legs, racked with exhaustion, sagging at the hips and at the knees, clinging to the chains with their hands in order to rest, only able to sleep standing up, and woken at every moment by the strangling collar. Some did not wake. To eat, using their heels they nudged up their shins to within reach of their hands the bread that was thrown to them in the mud. How long did they remain like this? One month, two months, sometimes six. One was there a year. It was the antechamber to the prison hulks. People were put there for a hare stolen from the king. What did they do in this hellish tomb? What can be done in a tomb – they suffered agonies; and what can be done in hell – they sang. For where there is no further hope, there is still singing. In the waters off Malta, when a galley was approaching, the singing could be heard before the sound of the oars. Poor Survincent the poacher, who had been through the Châtelet prison cellar, used to say, ‘It was the rhymes that kept me going.’ The futility of poetry. What good is rhyme? It was this cellar that gave birth to nearly all the songs in argot. From this dungeon in Paris’s Grand-Châtelet came that melancholy refrain of Montgomery’s galley: Timaloumisaine, timoulamison. Most of these songs are lugubrious. Some are cheerful. One is tender:","There existed at the Châtelet in Paris a large and long cellar. This cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither windows nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enter there, air could not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and for floor ten inches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the floor, a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side; from this beam hung, at short distances apart, chains three feet long, and at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck. In this vault, men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure for Toulon. They were thrust under this beam, where each one found his fetters swinging in the darkness and waiting for him. The chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands, caught the unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted and left there. As the chain was too short, they could not lie down. They remained motionless in that cavern, in that night, beneath that beam, almost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to reach their bread, jug, or their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, filth flowing to their very calves, broken asunder with fatigue, with thighs and knees giving way, clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some rest, unable to sleep except when standing erect, and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar; some woke no more. In order to eat, they pushed the bread, which was flung to them in the mud, along their leg with their heel until it reached their hand. How long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six months sometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys. Men were put there for stealing a hare from the king. In this sepulchre-hell, what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, they went through the agonies of death, and what can man do in hell, they sang; for song lingers where there is no longer any hope. In the waters of Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song could be heard before the sound of the oars. Poor Survincent, the poacher, who had gone through the prison-cellar of the Châtelet, said: “It was the rhymes that kept me up.” Uselessness of poetry. What is the good of rhyme? It is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth. It is from the dungeon of the Grand-Châtelet of Paris that comes the melancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: “Timaloumisaine, timaloumison.” The majority of these songs are melancholy; some are gay; one is tender:—","There was at the Châtelet de Paris a broad long cellar. This cellar was eight feet deep below the level of the Seine. It had neither windows nor ventilators, the only opening was the door; men could enter, but not air. The cellar had for a ceiling a stone arch, and for a floor, ten inches of mud. It had been paved with tiles, but, under the oozing of the waters, the pavement had rotted and broken up. Eight feet above the floor, a long massive beam crossed this vault from side to side; from this beam there hung, at intervals, chains three feet in length, and at the end of these chains there were iron collars. Men condemned to the galleys were put into this cellar until the day of their departure for Toulon. They were pushed under this timber, where each had his iron swinging in the darkness, waiting for him. The chains, those pendent arms, and the collars, those open hands, seized these wretches by the neck. They were riveted, and they were left there. The chain being too short, they could not lie down. They remained motionless in this cave, in this blackness, under this timber, almost hung, forced to monstrous exertions to reach their bread or their pitcher, the arch above their heads, the mud up to their knees, their ordure running down their legs, collapsing with fatigue, their hips and knees giving way, hanging by their hands to the chain to rest themselves, unable to sleep except standing, and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar: some did not awake. In order to eat, they had to draw their bread, which was thrown into the mire, up the leg with the heel, within reach of the hand. How long did they continue thus? A month, two months, six months sometimes; one remained a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys. Men were put there for stealing a hare from the king. In this hell-sepulchre what did they do? What can be done in a sepulchre, they agonised, and what can be done in a hell, they sang. For where there is no more hope, song remains. In the waters of Malta, when a galley was approaching, they heard the song before they heard the oars. The poor poacher, Survincent, who had passed through the cellar-prison of the Châtelet said: it was the rhymes which sustained me. Uselessness of poetry. Of what use is rhyme? In this cellar almost all the argot songs took birth. It is from the dungeon of the Grand Châtelet de Paris that the melancholy galley refrain of Montgomery comes: Timaloumisaine, timoulamaison. Most of these songs are dreary; some are cheerful; one is tender:"

He had no longer any reason for existing.","However this might be, and it was always to this that he returned, one thing overruled all else for him, that was, that he had just committed an appalling infraction. He had closed his eyes upon a convicted second offender in breach of his ban. He had set a galley-slave at large. He had robbed the laws of a man who belonged to them. He had done that. He could not understand himself. He was not sure of being himself. The very reasons of his action escaped him; he caught only the whirl of them. He had lived up to this moment by that blind faith which a dark probity engenders. This faith was leaving him, this probity was failing him. All that he had believed was dissipated. Truths which he had no wish for inexorably besieged him. He must henceforth be another man. He suffered the strange pangs of a conscience suddenly operated upon for the cataract. He saw what he revolted at seeing. He felt that he was emptied, useless, broken off from his past life, destitute, dissolved. Authority was dead in him. He had no further reason for existence."

"La pente de Jean Valjean était, on le sait, d’aller aux endroits peu fréquentés, aux recoins solitaires, aux lieux d’oubli. Il y avait alors aux environs des barrières de Paris des espèces de champs pauvres, presque mêlés à la ville, où il poussait, l’été, un blé maigre, et qui, l’automne, après la récolte faite, n’avaient pas l’air moissonnés, mais pelés. Jean Valjean les hantait avec prédilection. Cosette ne s’y ennuyait point. C’était la solitude pour lui, la liberté pour elle. Là, elle redevenait petite fille, elle pouvait courir et presque jouer, elle ôtait son chapeau, le posait sur les genoux de Jean Valjean, et cueillait des bouquets. Elle regardait les papillons sur les fleurs, mais ne les prenait pas ; les mansuétudes et les attendrissements naissent avec l’amour, et la jeune fille, qui a en elle un idéal tremblant et fragile, a pitié de l’aile du papillon. Elle tressait en guirlandes des coquelicots qu’elle mettait sur sa tête, et qui, traversés et pénétrés de soleil, empourprés jusqu’au flamboiement, faisaient à ce frais visage rose une couronne de braises.","Jean Valjean's inclination was, as we know, to go to little frequented places, to solitary nooks, to places of oblivion. There were then, around the gates of Paris, a kind of poor field, almost mingled with the city, where a meager wheat grew in the summer, and which, in the autumn, after the harvest had been made, had not grown. looking harvested, but peeled. Jean Valjean haunted them with predilection. Cosette was not bored there. It was solitude for him, freedom for her. There she became a little girl again, she could run and almost play, she took off her hat, placed it on Jean Valjean's lap, and picked bouquets. She looked at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not take them; leniency and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl, who has in her a trembling and fragile ideal, takes pity on the butterfly's wing. She braided poppies into garlands which she placed on her head, and which, traversed and penetrated by the sun, flushed to the point of blaze, made a crown of embers on this fresh rosy face.","Jean Valjean’s inclination was, as we know, to go to out-of-the-way places, lonely spots, forgotten parts. In those days there were around the gates of Paris, almost part of the city, fields of a sort, of poor quality, where scraggly corn grew in summer, and which in the autumn after harvest looked not so much as if they had been reaped as stripped bare. Jean Valjean liked to frequent these fields. Cosette did not mind going there. To him it meant solitude, to her, freedom. There she became a little girl again, she could run about and almost play, she would take off her hat, rest it on Jean Valjean’s lap, and gather posies. She observed the butterflies on the flowers but did not catch them. Kindness and tenderness come with love, and the young girl who has a fluttering, fragile ideal inside her pities the butterfly’s wing. She wove garlands of poppies that she placed on her head, and suffused with the sunlight shining through them and turning them to blazing crimson, they formed a crown of burning embers above that fresh rosy face.","Jean Valjean’s inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least frequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then existed, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor meadows, which were almost confounded with the city, where grew in summer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been gathered, presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but peeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored there. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became a little girl once more, she could run and almost play; she took off her hat, laid it on Jean Valjean’s knees, and gathered bunches of flowers. She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them; gentleness and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed on her head, and which, crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowing until they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.","Jean Valjean’s inclination was, we know, to go to unfrequented spots, to solitary nooks, to neglected places. There were at that time in the neighbourhood of the barrières of Paris some poor fields, almost in the city, where there grew in summer a scanty crop of wheat, and which in autumn, after this was gathered, appeared not to have been harvested, but stripped. Jean Valjean had a predilection for these fields. Cosette did not dislike them. To him it was solitude, to her it was liberty. There she became a little girl again, she could run and almost play, she took off her hat, laid it on Jean Valjean’s knees, and gathered flowers. She looked at the butterflies upon the blossoms, but did not catch them; gentleness and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who has in her heart a trembling and fragile idea, feels pity for a butterfly’s wing. She wove garlands of wild poppies which she put upon her head and which, lit up and illuminated in the sunshine, and blazing like a flame, made a crown of fire for her fresh and rosy face."

"Au commencement de ce siècle, l’égout de Paris était encore un lieu mystérieux. La boue ne peut jamais être bien famée ; mais ici le mauvais renom allait jusqu’à l’effroi. Paris savait confusément qu’il avait sous lui une cave terrible. On en parlait comme de cette monstrueuse souille de Thèbes où fourmillaient des scolopendres de quinze pieds de long et qui eût pu servir de baignoire à Béhémoth. Les grosses bottes des égoutiers ne s’aventuraient jamais au delà de certains points connus. On était encore très voisin du temps où les tombereaux des boueurs, du haut desquels Sainte-Foix fraternisait avec le marquis de Créqui, se déchargeaient tout simplement dans l’égout. Quant au curage, on confiait cette fonction aux averses, qui encombraient plus qu’elles ne balayaient. Rome laissait encore quelque poésie à son cloaque et l’appelait Gémonies ; Paris insultait le sien et l’appelait le Trou punais. La science et la superstition étaient d’accord pour l’horreur. Le Trou punais ne répugnait pas moins à l’hygiène qu’à la légende. Le Moine bourru était éclos sous la voussure fétide de l’égout Mouffetard ; les cadavres des Marmousets avaient été jetés dans l’égout de la Barillerie ; Fagon avait attribué la redoutable fièvre maligne de 1685 au grand hiatus de l’égout du Marais qui resta béant jusqu’en 1833 rue Saint-Louis, presque en face de l’enseigne du Messager galant. La bouche d’égout de la rue de la Mortellerie était célèbre par les pestes qui en sortaient ; avec sa grille de fer à pointes qui simulait une rangée de dents, elle était dans cette rue fatale comme une gueule de dragon soufflant l’enfer sur les hommes. L’imagination populaire assaisonnait le sombre évier parisien d’on ne sait quel hideux mélange d’infini. L’égout était sans fond. L’égout, c’était le barathrum. L’idée d’explorer ces régions lépreuses ne venait pas même à la police. Tenter cet inconnu, jeter la sonde dans cette ombre, aller à la découverte dans cet abîme, qui l’eût osé ? C’était effrayant. Quelqu’un se présenta pourtant. Le cloaque eut son Christophe Colomb.","At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still a mysterious place. Mud can never be well known; but here the bad reputation went as far as terror. Paris vaguely knew that he had a terrible cellar beneath him. They spoke of it as of that monstrous defile of Thebes where scolopendras fifteen feet long swarmed and which could have served as a bathtub for Behemoth. The big boots of the sewers never ventured beyond certain known points. We were still very close to the time when the dumpsters of the scavengers, from the top of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis de Créqui, simply discharged into the sewer. As for cleaning, this function was entrusted to the showers, which obstructed more than they swept away. Rome still left some poetry in its cesspool and called it Gemonies; Paris insulted hers and called it the Punish Hole. Science and superstition agreed on horror. The Punish Hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend. Le Moine bourru was hatched under the fetid arch of the Mouffetard sewer; the corpses of the Marmosets had been thrown into the Barillerie sewer; Fagon had attributed the dreaded malignant fever of 1685 to the great hiatus in the Marais sewer which remained gaping until 1833 rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the Messager galant. The manhole in the Rue de la Mortellerie was famous for the plagues that issued from it; with its spiked iron gate that simulated a row of teeth, it stood in that fatal street like a dragon's mouth blowing hell on men. The popular imagination seasoned the dark Parisian sink with some hideous mixture of infinity. The sewer was bottomless. The sewer was the barathrum. The idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police. To tempt this stranger, to probe into this shadow, to discover in this abyss, who would have dared? It was scary. However, someone showed up. The sewer had its Christopher Columbus.","At the beginning of this century the Paris sewers were still a place of mystery. Filth will never be well thought of, but in this instance such was its ill-repute that it was regarded with dread. Paris knew in some confused way that there was underneath it a terrible cavern. People spoke of it as of that monstrous pit of Thebes teeming with fifteen-foot-long centipedes and that might have served Behemoth for a bathtub. The sewermen’s great boots never ventured beyond certain well known points. It was still very close to the time when waste-carts, on top of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis de Créqui, discharged their loads directly into the sewers. As for any flushing, responsibility for that task was entrusted to downpours of rain, which clogged rather than cleared. Rome still allowed its waste dump a little poetry, calling it the Gemonian Steps. Paris insulted its cloaca and called it the Stink-Hole. Science and superstition concurred in their horror. The Stink-Hole was no less loathsome to hygiene than to legend. Paris’s bogeyman flourished under the fetid vault of the Mouffetard drain. The corpses of the Marmousets had been thrown into the Barillerie drain. Fagon had attributed the terrible malignant fever of 1685 to the great long stretch of the Marais open drain, which remained uncovered in Rue St-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the Gallant Messenger, until 1833. The mouth of the Rue de la Mortellerie drain was famous for the vermin that came out of it. With the sharp points of its iron grating suggestive of a row of teeth, it was like a dragon’s maw in that deadly street, breathing hell over men. The popular imagination enlivened the grim Parisian sump with who knows what hideous mixture of infinitudes. The sewer was bottomless. The sewer was a barathrum. The idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police. To probe this unknown, to fathom this darkness, to go exploring this abyss – who would have dared? It was terrifying. Yet someone did volunteer. The sewer had its Christopher Columbus.","At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still a mysterious place. Mud can never enjoy a good fame; but in this case its evil renown reached the verge of the terrible. Paris knew, in a confused way, that she had under her a terrible cavern. People talked of it as of that monstrous bed of Thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet in length, and which might have served Behemoth for a bathtub. The great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain well-known points. We were then very near the epoch when the scavenger’s carts, from the summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis de Créqui, discharged their loads directly into the sewer. As for cleaning out,—that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather than swept away. Rome left some poetry to her sewer, and called it the Gemoniæ; Paris insulted hers, and entitled it the Polypus-Hole. Science and superstition were in accord, in horror. The Polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend. The goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer; the corpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la Barillerie; Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the great hiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which remained yawning until 1833 in the Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the Gallant Messenger. The mouth of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which had their source there; with its grating of iron, with points simulating a row of teeth, it was like a dragon’s maw in that fatal street, breathing forth hell upon men. The popular imagination seasoned the sombre Parisian sink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite. The sewer had no bottom. The sewer was the lower world. The idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police. To try that unknown thing, to cast the plummet into that shadow, to set out on a voyage of discovery in that abyss—who would have dared? It was alarming. Nevertheless, some one did present himself. The cesspool had its Christopher Columbus.","At the commencement of this century, the sewer of Paris was still a mysterious place. Mire can never be in good repute; but here ill-fame reached even fright. Paris dimly realised that she had a terrible cave beneath her. People talked of it as of that monstrous bog of Thebes which swarmed with scolopendras fifteen feet long, and which might have served as a bathing-tub for Behemoth. The big boots of the sewer-men never ventured beyond certain known points. They were still very near the time when the scavengers’ tumbrils, from the top of which Sainte Foix fraternised with the Marquis of Créqui, were simply emptied into the sewer. As for cleansing, that operation was confided to the showers, which obstructed more than they swept out. Rome still left some poetry to her cloaca, and called it Gemoniæ; Paris insulted hers and called it the Stink-Hole. Science and superstitions were at one in regard to the horror. The Stink-Hole was not less revolting to hygiene than to legend. The Goblin Monk had appeared under the fetid arch of the Mouffetard sewer; the corpses of the Marmousets had been thrown into the sewer of the Barillerie; Fagon had attributed the fearful malignant fever of 1685 to the great gap in the sewer of the Marais which remained yawning until 1833, in the Rue Saint Louis, almost in front of the sign of the Gallant Messenger. The mouth of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was famous for the pestilence which came from it; with its pointed iron grating which looked like a row of teeth, it lay in that fatal street like the jaws of a dragon blowing hell upon men. The popular imagination seasoned the gloomy Parisian sink with an indefinably hideous mixture of the infinite. The sewer was bottomless. The sewer was the barathrum. The idea of exploring these leprous regions did not occur even to the police. To tempt that unknown, to throw the lead into that darkness, to go on a voyage of discovery in that abyss, who would have dared? It was frightful. Somebody came forward, however. The cloaca had its Columbus."

"Il marcha droit à Enjolras, les insurgés s’écartaient devant lui avec une crainte religieuse, il arracha le drapeau à Enjolras, qui reculait pétrifié, et alors, sans que personne osât ni l’arrêter ni l’aider, ce vieillard de quatrevingts ans, la tête branlante, le pied ferme, se mit à gravir lentement l’escalier de pavés pratiqué dans la barricade. Cela était si sombre et si grand que tous autour de lui crièrent : Chapeau bas ! A chaque marche qu’il montait, c’était effrayant, ses cheveux blancs, sa face décrépite, son grand front chauve et ridé, ses yeux caves, sa bouche étonnée et ouverte, son vieux bras levant la bannière rouge, surgissaient de l’ombre et grandissaient dans la clarté sanglante de la torche, et l’on croyait voir le spectre de 93 sortir de terre, le drapeau de la terreur à la main.","He marched straight to Enjolras, the insurgents moved aside in front of him with religious fear, he tore the flag from Enjolras, who was recoiling petrified, and then, without anyone daring to either stop or help him, this old man of eighty , his head bobbing, his feet firm, began to climb slowly the staircase of cobblestones made in the barricade. It was so dark and so big that everyone around him shouted: Hats off! With each step he climbed, it was frightening, his white hair, his decrepit face, his great bald and wrinkled forehead, his sunken eyes, his astonished and open mouth, his old arm raising the red banner, rose from the shadow and grew in the bloody light of the torch, and one thought one saw the specter of 93 rising from the ground, the flag of terror in hand.","He walked straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents making way before him with a religious awe. He snatched the flag from Enjolras, who fell back, paralysed, and then, since no one dared stop him or help him, this old man of eighty – head shaking, but firm-footed – began slowly to ascend the flight of cobblestones set into the barricade. So solemn and so noble was this, that all around him cried, ‘Bravo!’ With every step he climbed, the effect was terrifying: rising out of the darkness, and magnified in the blood-red light of the torch, his white hair, his age-worn face, his broad brow, bald and wrinkled, his sunken eyes, his amazed and gaping mouth, his old arm holding high the red banner – it might have been the spectre of ’93 emerging from the earth, holding the flag of the Terror in his hand.","He strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing before him with a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled in amazement and then, since no one dared to stop or to assist him, this old man of eighty, with shaking head but firm foot, began slowly to ascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade. This was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried: “Off with your hats!” At every step that he mounted, it was a frightful spectacle; his white locks, his decrepit face, his lofty, bald, and wrinkled brow, his amazed and open mouth, his aged arm upholding the red banner, rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch, and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of ’93 emerging from the earth, with the flag of terror in his hand.","He walked straight to Enjolras, the insurgents fell back before him with a religious awe, he snatched the flag from Enjolras, who drew back petrified, and then, nobody daring to stop him, or to aid him, this old man of eighty, with shaking head but firm foot, began to climb slowly up the stairway of paving-stones built into the barricade.

"Marius se figurait la vie avec Cosette comme cela, sans autre chose ; venir tous les soirs rue Plumet, déranger le vieux barreau complaisant de la grille du président, s’asseoir coude à coude sur ce banc, regarder à travers les arbres la scintillation de la nuit commençante, faire cohabiter le pli du genou de son pantalon avec l’ampleur de la robe de Cosette, lui caresser l’ongle du pouce, lui dire tu, respirer l’un après l’autre la même fleur, à jamais, indéfiniment. Pendant ce temps-là les nuages passaient au-dessus de leur tête. Chaque fois que le vent souffle, il emporte plus de rêves de l’homme que de nuées du ciel.","Marius imagined life with Cosette like that, nothing else; come every evening to the rue Plumet, disturb the obliging old bar of the president's gate, sit elbow to elbow on this bench, gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the beginning of night, make the crease of the knee of his trousers coexist with the fullness of Cosette's dress, caressing her thumbnail, telling her you are, breathing the same flower one after another, forever, indefinitely. During this time the clouds passed over their heads. Every time the wind blows, it carries away more of man's dreams than clouds of heaven.","Marius imagined life with Cosette just like this, without anything more: coming every evening to Rue Plumet, moving aside the obliging old railing in the judge’s gate, sitting close to each other on this bench, gazing through the trees at the twinkling of oncoming night, accommodating his trouser knee to the fullness of Cosette’s gown, caressing her thumbnail, calling her tu, taking turns to smell the scent of the same flower, for ever, without end. Meanwhile, the clouds passed above their heads.

"Parvenu au premier étage, il fit une pause. Toutes les voies douloureuses ont des stations. La fenêtre du palier, qui était une fenêtre-guillotine, était ouverte. Comme dans beaucoup d’anciennes maisons, l’escalier prenait jour et avait vue sur la rue. Le réverbère de la rue, situé précisément en face, jetait quelque lumière sur les marches, ce qui faisait une économie d’éclairage.","When he reached the first floor, he paused. All painful pathways have stations. The landing window, which was a sash window, was open. As in many old houses, the staircase opened up to the light and looked out onto the street. The street lamp, located directly opposite, threw some light on the steps, which made a saving of lighting.","When he reached the first floor, he paused.

"Tout ce vieux quartier des halles, qui est comme une ville dans la ville, que traversent les rues Saint-Denis et Saint-Martin, où se croisent mille ruelles et dont les insurgés avaient fait leur redoute et leur place d’armes, lui eût apparu comme un énorme trou sombre creusé au centre de Paris. Là le regard tombait dans un abîme. Grâce aux réverbères brisés, grâce aux fenêtres fermées, là cessait tout rayonnement, toute vie, toute rumeur, tout mouvement. L’invisible police de l’émeute veillait partout, et maintenait l’ordre, c’est-à-dire la nuit. Noyer le petit nombre dans une vaste obscurité, multiplier chaque combattant par les possibilités que cette obscurité contient, c’est la tactique nécessaire de l’insurrection. A la chute du jour, toute croisée où une chandelle s’allumait avait reçu une balle. La lumière était éteinte, quelquefois l’habitant tué. Aussi rien ne bougeait. Il n’y avait rien là que l’effroi, le deuil, la stupeur dans les maisons ; dans les rues une sorte d’horreur sacrée. On n’y apercevait même pas les longues rangées de fenêtres et d’étages, les dentelures des cheminées et des toits, les reflets vagues qui luisent sur le pavé boueux et mouillé. L’œil qui eût regardé d’en haut dans cet amas d’ombre eût entrevu peut-être çà et là, de distance en distance, des clartés indistinctes faisant saillir des lignes brisées et bizarres, des profils de constructions singulières, quelque chose de pareil à des lueurs allant et venant dans des ruines ; c’est là qu’étaient les barricades. Le reste était un lac d’obscurité, brumeux, pesant, funèbre, au-dessus duquel se dressaient, silhouettes immobiles et lugubres, la tour Saint-Jacques, l’église Saint-Merry, et deux ou trois autres de ces grands édifices dont l’homme fait des géants et dont la nuit fait des fantômes.","All this old district of Les Halles, which is like a city within the city, crossed by the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a thousand alleys intersect and which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their place of arms, would have appeared like a huge dark hole dug in the center of Paris. There the gaze fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lampposts, thanks to the closed windows, there ceased all radiance, all life, all noise, all movement. The invisible riot police watched everywhere, and maintained order, that is to say, at night. To drown the few in a vast darkness, to multiply each combatant by the possibilities that this darkness contains, this is the necessary tactic of the insurrection. At nightfall, every window where a candle was lighted had received a bullet. The light was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant killed. Also nothing was moving. There was nothing there but terror, mourning, amazement in the houses; in the streets a kind of sacred horror. You couldn't even see the long rows of windows and stories, the indentations of the chimneys and the roofs, the vague reflections that gleam on the muddy and wet pavement. The eye which had looked from above into this mass of shadow would perhaps have glimpsed here and there, from distance to distance, indistinct lights projecting broken and bizarre lines, profiles of singular constructions, something like lights coming and going in ruins; that's where the barricades were. The rest was a lake of darkness, misty, heavy, funereal, above which rose, motionless and lugubrious silhouettes, the Saint-Jacques tower, the Saint-Merry church, and two or three other of those great buildings whose man makes giants and whose night makes ghosts.","That whole ancient district of Les Halles, which is like a city within a city, with Rue St-Denis and Rue St-Martin cutting through it and crisscrossed by countless little lanes, and which the insurgents had made their redoubt and parade ground, would have appeared to such a being like a huge black hole sunk into the centre of Paris. To gaze on that was to look down into an abyss. Thanks to the shattered street lanterns, thanks to the closed windows, all light, all life, all sound, all movement ceased here. Keeping watch everywhere, and maintaining order, was the riot’s invisible police force – that is to say, the night. To hide in immense obscurity its small numbers, to multiply every combatant by the possibilities this obscurity contains, are the necessary tactics of insurrection. At nightfall, every window where a candle was lighted had been hit by a bullet. The light was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant killed. So nothing stirred. Here inside the houses was nothing but terror, bereavement, bewilderment, and in the streets a kind of awed horror. The long rows of windows and upper storeys, the irregular outlines of chimneys and roofs, and the vague reflections glistening on the wet and muddy pavements – not even these were discernible. Any eye looking down from above on that mass of shadow might perhaps have caught a glimpse here and there, at remote intervals, of paler patches throwing into relief bizarre broken lines, the contours of peculiar constructions, something resembling glimmers of light coming and going amid the ruins. That is where the barricades were located. The rest was a dark lake, vaporous, oppressive, dismal, and rising above it the still and gloomy silhouettes of the tower of St-Jacques, the church of St-Merry, and two or three more of those great edifices of which man makes giants and night makes phantoms.","All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a city, through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a thousand lanes cross, and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold, would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the glance fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the closed windows, there all radiance, all life, all sound, all movement ceased. The invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere, and maintained order, that is to say, night. The necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity, to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains. At dusk, every window where a candle was burning received a shot. The light was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing was stirring. There was nothing but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses; and in the streets, a sort of sacred horror. Not even the long rows of windows and stores, the indentations of the chimneys, and the roofs, and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy pavements, were visible. An eye cast upward at that mass of shadows might, perhaps, have caught a glimpse here and there, at intervals, of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines, and profiles of singular buildings, something like the lights which go and come in ruins; it was at such points that the barricades were situated. The rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy, and funereal, above which, in motionless and melancholy outlines, rose the tower of Saint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry, and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms.","All that old quartier of the markets, which is like a city within the city, which is traversed by the Rues Saint Denis and Saint Martin, where a thousand little streets cross each other, and of which the insurgents had made their stronghold and their field of arms, would have appeared to him like an enormous black hole dug out in the centre of Paris. There the eye fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lamps, thanks to the closed windows, there ceased all radiance, all life, all sound, all motion. The invisible police of the émeute watched everywhere, and maintained order, that is night. To drown the smallness of their number in a vast obscurity and to multiply each combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains, are the necessary tactics of insurrection. At nightfall, every window in which a candle was lighted had received a ball. The light was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant killed. Thus nothing stirred. There was nothing there but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses; in the streets a sort of sacred horror. Even the long ranges of windows and of stories were not perceptible, the notching of the chimneys and the roofs, the dim reflections which gleam on the wet and muddy pavement. The eye which might have looked from above into that mass of shade would have caught a glimpse here and there perhaps, from point to point, of indistinct lights, bringing out broken and fantastic lines, outlines of singular constructions, something like ghostly gleams, coming and going among ruins; these were the barricades. The rest was a lake of obscurity, misty, heavy, funereal, above which rose, motionless and dismal silhouettes, the tower Saint Jacques, the church Saint Merry, and two or three others of those great buildings of which man makes giants and of which night makes phantoms."
"Enfin ! après quatre ans ! Il le saisit, pour ainsi dire, tout entier d’un coup d’œil. Il le trouva beau, noble, distingué, grandi, homme fait, l’attitude convenable, l’air charmant. Il eut envie d’ouvrir les bras, de l’appeler, de se précipiter, ses entrailles se fondirent en ravissement, les paroles affectueuses le gonflaient et débordaient de sa poitrine ; enfin toute cette tendresse se fit jour et lui arriva aux lèvres, et, par le contraste qui était le fond de sa nature, il en sortit une dureté.

Il avait regretté la promesse à laquelle il s’était laissé entraîner. Il s’était beaucoup dit qu’il avait eu tort de faire cette concession au désespoir. Il s’était borné à éloigner peu à peu Jean Valjean de sa maison et à l’effacer le plus possible dans l’esprit de Cosette.

He had, as it were, always placed himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that in this way she would not notice him or think of him. It was more than obliteration, it was eclipse.","Before his marriage, as we have explained, Marius had asked Monsieur Fauchelevent no questions, and since his marriage he had been afraid to ask Jean Valjean any.

He had contented himself with keeping Jean Valjean away from his house little by little, and causing him to fade as much as possible from Cosette’s mind.

"Dès qu’ils ne furent plus en vue, l’aîné se coucha vivement à plat ventre sur le rebord arrondi du bassin, et, s’y cramponnant de la main gauche, penché sur l’eau, presque prêt à y tomber, étendit avec sa main droite sa baguette vers le gâteau. Les cygnes, voyant l’ennemi, se hâtèrent et en se hâtant firent un effet de poitrail utile au petit pêcheur ; l’eau devant les cygnes reflua, et l’une de ces molles ondulations concentriques poussa doucement la brioche vers la baguette de l’enfant. Comme les cygnes arrivaient, la baguette toucha le gâteau. L’enfant donna un coup vif, ramena la brioche, effraya les cygnes, saisit le gâteau, et se redressa. Le gâteau était mouillé ; mais ils avaient faim et soif. L’aîné fit deux parts de la brioche, une grosse et une petite, prit la petite pour lui, donna la grosse à son petit frère, et lui dit :","As soon as they were no longer in sight, the eldest quickly lay down on his stomach on the rounded edge of the basin, and, clinging to it with his left hand, bent over the water, almost ready to fall into it, stretched out with his right hand his wand towards the cake. The swans, seeing the enemy, hastened and in hastening made a chest effect useful to the little fisherman; the water in front of the swans receded, and one of those soft concentric undulations gently pushed the bun towards the child's wand. As the swans arrived, the wand touched the cake. The child gave a sharp blow, brought back the bun, frightened the swans, seized the cake, and straightened up. The cake was wet; but they were hungry and thirsty. The eldest divided the brioche into two parts, a large one and a small one, took the small one for himself, gave the large one to his little brother, and said to him:","As soon as they had disappeared from view, the older lad quickly lay flat on his stomach on the curved edge of the pond and, clinging to it with his left hand, leaning over the water, almost falling in, with his right hand he reached his stick out towards the brioche. Seeing the enemy, the swans came hurrying, and in hurrying created an effect with their breasts that was useful to the little angler. The water in front of the swans backed up, and one of those gentle concentric ripples gently nudged the brioche towards the child’s stick. Just as the swans arrived, the stick touched it. The child delivered a sharp swipe, drew in the brioche, frightened away the swans, grabbed the brioche, and stood up. The pastry was wet. But they were hungry and thirsty. The older boy broke the brioche into two pieces, one big and one small, took the small one for himself, gave the big one to his brother and said to him, ‘Ram that down your muzzle.’","As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin, and clinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water, on the verge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his stick towards the cake.

Just as the swans came up, the stick touched the cake. The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in the brioche, frightened away the swans, seized the cake, and sprang to his feet. The cake was wet; but they were hungry and thirsty. The elder broke the cake into two portions, a large one and a small one, took the small one for himself, gave the large one to his brother, and said to him:","As soon as they were out of sight, the elder quickly lay down with his face over the rounded edge of the basin, and, holding by it with his left hand, hanging over the water, almost falling in, with his right hand reached his stick towards the cake.

"Au bout de quelques instants, il n’était plus aveugle. Un peu de lumière tombait du soupirail par où il s’était glissé, et son regard s’était fait à cette cave. Il commença à distinguer quelque chose. Le couloir où il s’était terré, nul autre mot n’exprime mieux la situation, était muré derrière lui. C’était un de ces culs-de-sac que la langue spéciale appelle branchements. Devant lui, il y avait un autre mur, un mur de nuit. La clarté du soupirail expirait à dix ou douze pas du point où était Jean Valjean, et faisait à peine une blancheur blafarde sur quelques mètres de la paroi humide de l’égout. Au delà, l’opacité était massive ; y pénétrer paraissait horrible, et l’entrée y semblait un engloutissement. On pouvait s’enfoncer pourtant dans cette muraille de brume, et il le fallait. Il fallait même se hâter. Jean Valjean songea que cette grille, aperçue par lui sous les pavés, pouvait l’être par les soldats, et que tout tenait à ce hasard. Ils pouvaient descendre eux aussi dans le puits et le fouiller. Il n’y avait pas une minute à perdre. Il avait déposé Marius sur le sol, il le ramassa, ceci est encore le mot vrai, le reprit sur ses épaules et se mit en marche. Il entra résolûment dans cette obscurité.","After a few moments, he was no longer blind. A little light fell from the ventilator through which he had slipped, and his gaze had become familiar with this cellar. He began to make out something. The corridor where he had holed up, no other word describes the situation better, was walled behind him. It was one of those cul-de-sacs which special language calls connections. Ahead of him was another wall, a wall of night. The brightness of the air-hole expired ten or twelve paces from the point where Jean Valjean was, and scarcely cast a pale whiteness on a few yards of the damp wall of the sewer. Beyond that, the opacity was massive; To enter it seemed horrible, and to enter it seemed like an engulfment. We could, however, sink into this wall of mist, and we had to. We even had to hurry. Jean Valjean thought that this grating, which he saw under the paving stones, might have been seen by the soldiers, and that everything depended on this chance. They too could descend into the well and search it. There was not a minute to lose. He had placed Marius on the ground, he picked him up, this is still the true word, took him back on his shoulders and set off. He entered resolutely into this darkness.","After a few moments he was no longer blind. A little light came down the air-well he had slipped into, and his eyes had adjusted to this cellar. He began to discern something. The passage in which he had gone to ground – no other expression better describes the situation – ended in a wall behind him. It was one of those blind alleys for which the technical term is ‘lateral sewer’. In front of him was another wall, a wall of blackness. The light from the air-well gave out ten or twelve paces from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and cast the merest deathly pallor on a few yards of the damp sewer wall. Beyond, the opacity was massive. To penetrate it seemed horrifying, and entering it like being swallowed up. Yet it was possible for a man to force his way through that wall of fog, and it had to be done. Indeed, it had to be done quickly. That grating, Jean Valjean thought, that he had noticed under the cobblestones might also be noticed by the soldiers; everything depended on that accident of fate. They too might descend, and search this air-well. There was not a minute to lose. He had put Marius down on the ground, now he gathered him up – that again is the appropriate term – settled him back on his shoulders, and set off. He resolutely entered that darkness.","After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind. A little light fell through the man-hole through which he had descended, and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern. He began to distinguish something.

In front of him there was another wall, a wall like night.

Beyond, the opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed horrible, an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment. A man could, however, plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do. Haste was even requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under the flag-stones might also catch the eye of the soldiery, and that everything hung upon this chance. They also might descend into that well and search it. There was not a minute to be lost. He had deposited Marius on the ground, he picked him up again,—that is the real word for it,—placed him on his shoulders once more, and set out. He plunged resolutely into the gloom.","After a few moments, he ceased to be blind. A little light fell from the air-hole through which he had slipped in, and his eye became accustomed to this cave.

It was one of those cul-de-sacs technically called branchments. Before him, there was another wall, a wall of night.

"Nous disons fentes étroites, et nous ne pouvons pas donner une plus juste idée de ces ruelles obscures, resserrées, anguleuses, bordées de masures à huit étages. Ces masures étaient si décrépites que, dans les rues de la Chanvrerie et de la Petite-Truanderie, les façades s’étayaient de poutres allant d’une maison à l’autre. La rue était étroite et le ruisseau large, le passant y cheminait sur le pavé toujours mouillé, côtoyant des boutiques pareilles à des caves, de grosses bornes cerclées de fer, des tas d’ordures excessifs, des portes d’allées armées d’énormes grilles séculaires.

These tenement buildings were so decrepit that in Rue de la Chanvrerie and Rue de la Petite-Truanderie the façades were shored up with beams running across from one house to another.

"En floréal, cet énorme buisson, libre derrière sa grille et dans ses quatre murs, entrait en rut dans le sourd travail de la germination universelle, tressaillait au soleil levant presque comme une bête qui aspire les effluves de l’amour cosmique et qui sent la séve d’avril monter et bouillonner dans ses veines, et, secouant au vent sa prodigieuse chevelure verte, semait sur la terre humide, sur les statues frustes, sur le perron croulant du pavillon et jusque sur le pavé de la rue déserte, les fleurs en étoiles, la rosée en perles, la fécondité, la beauté, la vie, la joie, les parfums. A midi mille papillons blancs s’y réfugiaient, et c’était un spectacle divin de voir là tourbillonner en flocons dans l’ombre cette neige vivante de l’été. Là, dans ces gaies ténèbres de la verdure, une foule de voix innocentes parlaient doucement à l’âme, et ce que les gazouillements avaient oublié de dire, les bourdonnements le complétaient. Le soir une vapeur de rêverie se dégageait du jardin et l’enveloppait ; un linceul de brume, une tristesse céleste et calme, le couvraient ; l’odeur si enivrante des chèvrefeuilles et des liserons en sortait de toute part comme un poison exquis et subtil ; on entendait les derniers appels des grimpereaux et des bergeronnettes s’assoupissant sous les branchages ; on y sentait cette intimité sacrée de l’oiseau et de l’arbre ; le jour les ailes réjouissent les feuilles, la nuit les feuilles protègent les ailes.","In Floréal, this enormous bush, free behind its gate and within its four walls, went into heat in the deaf work of universal germination, quivered in the rising sun almost like a beast that sucks in the scents of cosmic love and smells of sap of April rose and bubbled in his veins, and, shaking in the wind his prodigious green hair, sowed on the damp earth, on the rough statues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion and even on the pavement of the deserted street, the flowers in stars, the dew in pearls, fertility, beauty, life, joy, perfumes. At noon a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, and it was a divine spectacle to see the living summer snow swirling there in flakes in the shadow. There, in that gay darkness of greenery, a host of innocent voices spoke softly to the soul, and what the chirps had forgotten to say, the buzzes completed. In the evening a vapor of reverie emanated from the garden and enveloped it; a shroud of mist, a celestial and calm sadness, covered him; the intoxicating smell of honeysuckle and bindweed issued from it everywhere like an exquisite and subtle poison; you could hear the last calls of treecreepers and wagtails dozing under the branches; one felt there the sacred intimacy of the bird and the tree; by day the wings gladden the leaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.","During Floréal this huge wilderness, free behind its bars and within its four walls, went into rut, part of the secret process of universal germination; it quivered in the rising sun, almost like an animal breathing in rushes of cosmic love and feeling the April sap rising and bubbling in its veins; and shaking its extraordinary green mane in the wind, it scattered over the damp earth, the worn statues, the crumbling steps to the house and even the pavement of the deserted street, starry flowers, beads of dew, fecundity, beauty, life, joy, fragrances. At noon countless white butterflies would take refuge here; and it was a heavenly sight to see, whirling about in the shade, flurries of those living snows of summertime. There, in those merry green shadows, a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and anything the twitterings had forgotten to say was made up for by the hummings. In the evening, a haze of reverie rose from the garden to envelop it. A shroud of mist, a calm and celestial sadness, lay over it. Such a heady perfume of honeysuckle and convolvulus emanated from everywhere, like an exquisite and subtle poison. You could hear the last cries of the tree-creepers and the wagtails as they dozed off among the branches. You could sense that sacred intimacy between birds and trees: by day the wings gladden the leaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.","In Floréal34 this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and within its four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered in the rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love, and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins, and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks, sprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced statues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement of the deserted street, flowers like stars, dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy, perfumes. At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of verdure, a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed. In the evening, a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it; a shroud of mist, a calm and celestial sadness covered it; the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it, like an exquisite and subtle poison; the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches; one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees; by day the wings rejoice the leaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.","In Floréal, this enormous shrub, free behind its grating and within its four walls, warmed into the deep labour of universal germination, thrilled at the rising sun almost like a stag which inhales the air of universal love and feels the April sap mounting and boiling in his veins, and shaking its immense green antlers in the wind, scattered over the moist ground, over the broken statues, over the sinking staircase of the summer-house, and even over the pavement of the deserted street, flowers in stars, dew in pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy, perfume. At noon, a thousand white butterflies took refuge in it, and it was a heavenly sight to see this living snow of summer whirling about in flakes in the shade. There, in this gay darkness of verdure, a multitude of innocent voices spoke softly to the soul, and what the warbling had forgotten to say, the humming completed. At night, a dreamy vapour arose from the garden and wrapped it around; a shroud of mist, a calm and celestial sadness, covered it; the intoxicating odour of honeysuckles and bindweed rose on all sides like an exquisite and subtle poison; you heard the last appeals of the woodpecker, and the wagtails drowsing under the branches; you felt the sacred intimacy of bird and tree; by day the wings rejoiced the leaves; by night the leaves protected the wings."

"Un soir que ces bises soufflaient rudement, au point que janvier semblait revenu et que les bourgeois avaient repris les manteaux, le petit Gavroche, toujours grelottant gaîment sous ses loques, se tenait debout et comme en extase devant la boutique d’un perruquier des environs de l’Orme-Saint-Gervais. Il était orné d’un châle de femme en laine, cueilli on ne sait où, dont il s’était fait un cache-nez. Le petit Gavroche avait l’air d’admirer profondément une mariée en cire, décolletée et coiffée de fleurs d’oranger, qui tournait derrière la vitre, montrant, entre deux quinquets, son sourire aux passants ; mais en réalité il observait la boutique afin de voir s’il ne pourrait pas « chiper » dans la devanture un pain de savon, qu’il irait ensuite revendre un sou à un « coiffeur » de la banlieue.

"Cette fille Magnon, dont il a été question quelques pages plus haut, était la même qui avait réussi à faire renter par le bonhomme Gillenormand les deux enfants qu’elle avait. Elle demeurait quai des Célestins, à l’angle de cette antique rue du Petit-Musc qui a fait ce qu’elle a pu pour changer en bonne odeur sa mauvaise renommée. On se souvient de la grande épidémie de croup qui désola, il y a trente-cinq ans, les quartiers riverains de la Seine à Paris, et dont la science profita pour expérimenter sur une large échelle l’efficacité des insufflations d’alun, si utilement remplacées aujourd’hui par la teinture externe d’iode. Dans cette épidémie, la Magnon perdit, le même jour, l’un le matin, l’autre le soir, ses deux garçons, encore en très bas âge. Ce fut un coup. Ces enfants étaient précieux à leur mère ; ils représentaient quatrevingts francs par mois. Ces quatrevingts francs étaient fort exactement soldés, au nom de M. Gillenormand, par son receveur de rentes, M. Barge, huissier retiré, rue du Roi-de-Sicile. Les enfants morts, la rente était enterrée. La Magnon chercha un expédient. Dans cette ténébreuse maçonnerie du mal dont elle faisait partie, on sait tout, on se garde le secret, et l’on s’entr’aide. Il fallait deux enfants à la Magnon ; la Thénardier en avait deux. Même sexe, même âge. Bon arrangement pour l’une, bon placement pour l’autre. Les petits Thénardier devinrent les petits Magnon. La Magnon quitta le quai des Célestins et alla demeurer rue Clocheperce. A Paris, l’identité qui lie un individu à lui-même se rompt d’une rue à l’autre.","This Magnon girl, of whom we spoke a few pages earlier, was the same one who had succeeded in bringing in the two children she had through goodman Gillenormand. She lived on the Quai des Célestins, at the corner of that ancient rue du Petit-Musc, which did what she could to change her bad reputation into a good smell. We remember the great epidemic of croup which devastated, thirty-five years ago, the districts bordering the Seine in Paris, and of which science took advantage to experiment on a large scale with the effectiveness of insufflations of alum, if usefully replaced today by the external tincture of iodine. In this epidemic, the Magnon lost, the same day, one in the morning, the other in the evening, her two boys, still very young. It was a hit. These children were precious to their mother; they represented eighty francs a month. These eighty francs were very exactly settled, in the name of M. Gillenormand, by his tax-collector, M. Barge, retired usher, rue du Roi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the income was buried. La Magnon looked for an expedient. In this dark masonry of evil of which she was a part, we know everything, we keep secrets, and we help each other. Magnon needed two children; the Thénardier had two. Same sex, same age. Good arrangement for one, good placement for the other. The little Thénardiers became the little Magnon. La Magnon left the Quai des Célestins and went to live in rue Clocheperce.

These children were precious to their mother. They represented eighty francs a month. Those eighty francs were paid very punctually in the name of Monsieur Gillenormand by the collector of his rents, Monsieur Barge, a retired bailiff in Rue du Roi-de-Sicile. Once the children were dead, that was the end of the income. La Magnon sought a way round this. In that shady freemasonry of villainy to which she belonged, everything is common knowledge, no one betrays a secret, and everybody helps each other out. La Magnon needed two children. The Thénardiers had two children. The same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for her, a good investment for them. The little Thénardiers became the little Magnons.

These children were precious to their mother; they represented eighty francs a month. These eighty francs were paid with great exactness, in the name of M. Gillenormand, by his rent-agent, M. Barge, retired constable, Rue du Roi de Sicile. The children dead, the income was buried. Magnon sought for an expedient. In that dark masonry of evil of which she was a part, everything is known, secrets are kept, and each aids the other. Magnon needed two children! the Thénardiess had two. Same sex, same age. Good arrangement for one, good investment for the other. The little Thénardiers became the little Magnons. Magnon left the Quai des Célestins and went to live in the Rue Clocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual to himself is broken from one street to another."
"Les despotes sont pour quelque chose dans les penseurs. Parole enchaînée, c’est parole terrible. L’écrivain double et triple son style quand le silence est imposé par un maître au peuple. Il sort de ce silence une certaine plénitude mystérieuse qui filtre et se fige en airain dans la pensée. La compression dans l’histoire produit la concision dans l’historien. La solidité granitique de telle prose célèbre n’est autre chose qu’un tassement fait par le tyran.",Despots have something to do with thinkers. Chained speech is terrible speech. The writer doubles and triples his style when silence is imposed by a master on the people. Out of this silence emerges a certain mysterious plenitude which filters and freezes in bronze in thought. Compression in history produces conciseness in the historian. The granitic solidity of such famous prose is nothing other than a compaction made by the tyrant.,"Despots have their effect on thinkers. Fettered speech is fearsome speech. The virtuosity of a writer’s style increases twofold, threefold, when a master imposes silence on the people. Out of this silence comes a certain mysterious plenitude that filters into the mind and sets like bronze. Historical repression produces conciseness in the historian. The granite solidity of some celebrated prose is nothing other than a density created by the tyrant’s oppression.",Despots count for something in the question of philosophers. A word that is chained is a terrible word. The writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed on a nation by its master. From this silence there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and there congeals into bronze. The compression of history produces conciseness in the historian. The granite solidity of such and such a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant.,Despots are an aid to thinkers. Speech enchained is speech terrible. The writer doubles and triples his style when silence is imposed by a master upon the people. There springs from this silence a certain mysterious fulness which filters and freezes into brass in the thoughts. Compression in the history produces conciseness in the historian. The granitic solidity of some celebrated prose is only a condensation produced by the tyrant.
"Quand Cosette sortait avec lui, elle s’appuyait sur son bras, fière, heureuse, dans la plénitude du cœur. Jean Valjean, à toutes ces marques d’une tendresse si exclusive et si satisfaite de lui seul, sentait sa pensée se fondre en délices. Le pauvre homme tressaillait inondé d’une joie angélique ; il s’affirmait avec transport que cela durerait toute la vie ; il se disait qu’il n’avait vraiment pas assez souffert pour mériter un si radieux bonheur, et il remerciait Dieu, dans les profondeurs de son âme, d’avoir permis qu’il fût ainsi aimé, lui misérable, par cet être innocent.","When Cosette went out with him, she leaned on his arm, proud, happy, in the fullness of her heart.

"― Comme on est bête ! Je croyais que je ne la verrais plus. Figurez-vous, monsieur Pontmercy, qu’au moment où vous êtes entré, je me disais : C’est fini. Voilà sa petite robe, je suis un misérable homme, je ne verrai plus Cosette, je disais cela au moment même où vous montiez l’escalier. Étais-je idiot ! Voilà comme on est idiot ! Mais on compte sans le bon Dieu. Le bon Dieu dit : Tu t’imagines qu’on va t’abandonner, bêta ! Non. Non, ça ne se passera pas comme ça. Allons, il y a là un pauvre bonhomme qui a besoin d’un ange. Et l’ange vient ; et l’on revoit sa Cosette ! et l’on revoit sa petite Cosette ! Ah ! j’étais bien malheureux !","―How stupid we are! I thought I would never see her again. Imagine, Mr. Pontmercy, that when you came in, I said to myself: It's over. Here's her little dress, I'm a wretched man, I'll never see Cosette again, I was saying that just as you were going up the stairs. Was I stupid! That's how stupid we are! But we count without the good Lord. The good Lord says: Do you imagine that we are going to abandon you, stupid! No. No, it won't be like that. Come on, there's a poor fellow there who needs an angel. And the angel comes; and we see his Cosette again! and we see his little Cosette again! Ah! I was very unhappy!","Jean Valjean mumbled, ‘How stupid! I thought I’d never see her again. Imagine, Monsieur Pontmercy, at the very moment you came in, I was saying to myself, “That’s all over. Here’s her little dress, I’m a wretched man, I shall never see Cosette again” – I was saying that at the very moment you were climbing the stairs. What a fool I was! That’s how foolish you can be! But that’s not taking the good Lord into account. The good Lord says, “You think you’re going to be abandoned, silly! No, no, it’s not going to turn out like that.

"Dernière question enfin ; mais à celle-ci pas de réponse. Cette question, Marius la sentait comme une tenaille. Comment se faisait-il que l’existence de Jean Valjean eût coudoyé si longtemps celle de Cosette ? Qu’était-ce que ce sombre jeu de la providence qui avait mis cet enfant en contact avec cet homme ? Y a-t-il donc aussi des chaînes à deux forgées là-haut, et Dieu se plaît-il à accoupler l’ange avec le démon ? Un crime et une innocence peuvent donc être camarades de chambrée dans le mystérieux bagne des misères ? Dans ce défilé de condamnés qu’on appelle la destinée humaine, deux fronts peuvent passer l’un près de l’autre, l’un naïf, l’autre formidable, l’un tout baigné des divines blancheurs de l’aube, l’autre à jamais blêmi par la lueur d’un éternel éclair ? Qui avait pu déterminer cet appareillement inexplicable ? De quelle façon, par suite de quel prodige, la communauté de vie avait-elle pu s’établir entre cette céleste petite et ce vieux damné ? Qui avait pu lier l’agneau au loup, et, chose plus incompréhensible encore, attacher le loup à l’agneau ? Car le loup aimait l’agneau, car l’être farouche adorait l’être faible, car, pendant neuf années, l’ange avait eu pour point d’appui le monstre. L’enfance et l’adolescence de Cosette, sa venue au jour, sa virginale croissance vers la vie et la lumière, avaient été abritées par ce dévouement difforme. Ici, les questions s’exfoliaient, pour ainsi parler, en énigmes innombrables, les abîmes s’ouvraient au fond des abîmes, et Marius ne pouvait plus se pencher sur Jean Valjean sans vertige. Qu’était-ce donc que cet homme précipice ?","Last question finally; but to this no answer. This question, Marius felt like a pincer. How was it that the existence of Jean Valjean had so long rubbed shoulders with that of Cosette? What was this dark game of providence that had brought this child into contact with this man? So are there also two-chains forged up there, and does God like to mate the angel with the demon? Can a crime and an innocence be roommates in the mysterious penal colony of misery? In this procession of the condemned that we call human destiny, two fronts can pass near each other, one naive, the other formidable, one completely bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn, the another forever paled by the gleam of eternal lightning? Who could have determined this inexplicable pairing? In what way, as a result of what prodigy, could the community of life have been established between this celestial little one and this damned old man? Who had been able to bind the lamb to the wolf, and, something more incomprehensible still, to bind the wolf to the lamb? Because the wolf loved the lamb, because the fierce being adored the weak being, because, for nine years, the angel had had the monster as his point of support. Cosette's childhood and adolescence, her birth, her virginal growth towards life and light, had been sheltered by this deformed devotion. Here the questions exfoliated, so to speak, into innumerable enigmas, the abysses opened up at the bottom of the abysses, and Marius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without dizziness. What was this precipice man?","Then the final question. But to this one there was no answer. Marius was tortured by this question: how was it that Jean Valjean’s life had for so long been linked with Cosette’s? What sinister game of Providence was it that had put that child in contact with this man? So are coupling manacles forged on high, too, and does God take pleasure in pairing angel with demon? So crime and innocence can be room-mates in the mysterious prison-hulk of wretchedness? In that procession of the condemned called human destiny, is it possible for two beings, one clear-browed, the other fearsome, one bathed through and through in the divine purity of dawn, the other for ever caught in the ghastly glimmer of eternal lightning, to walk side by side? Who could have brought about that unaccountable pairing? How, as a result of what extraordinary circumstances, did that heavenly child and that old criminal come to share each other’s life? Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf; and, yet more incomprehensible, the wolf to the lamb? Because the wolf loved the lamb, because that savage creature adored the weak one, because for nine years the angel’s stay and support had been the monster. Cosette’s childhood and adolescence, her development, her virginal growth towards life and light, had been protected by that anomalous devotion. At this point the questions shed, as it were, like fallen leaves, countless enigmas; abysses opened up at the bottom of abysses, and Marius could no longer focus his mind on Jean Valjean without feeling dizzy. What on earth was this chasm of a man?","This was the final question, to be sure; but to this there was no reply. This question Marius felt like pincers. How had it come to pass that Jean Valjean’s existence had elbowed that of Cosette for so long a period? What melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed that child in contact with that man? Are there then chains for two which are forged on high? and does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon? So a crime and an innocence can be room-mates in the mysterious galleys of wretchedness? In that defiling of condemned persons which is called human destiny, can two brows pass side by side, the one ingenuous, the other formidable, the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn, the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning? Who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing off? In what manner, in consequence of what prodigy, had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal? Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still more incomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf loved the lamb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble one, for, during the space of nine years, the angel had had the monster as her point of support. Cosette’s childhood and girlhood, her advent in the daylight, her virginal growth towards life and light, had been sheltered by that hideous devotion. Here questions exfoliated, so to speak, into innumerable enigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses, and Marius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without becoming dizzy. What was this man-precipice?","Finally, a last question: but to this no answer. This question Marius felt like a sting. How did it happen that Jean Valjean’s existence had touched Cosette’s so long? What was this gloomy game of providence which had placed this child in contact with this man? Are coupling chains then forged on high also, and does it please God to pair the angel with the demon? Can then a crime and an innocence be room-mates in the mysterious galleys of misery? In this strait of the condemned, which is called human destiny, can two foreheads pass close to one another, the one childlike, the other terrible, the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of the dawn, the other for ever pallid with the glare of an eternal lightning? Who could have determined this inexplicable fellowship? In what manner, through what prodigy, could community of life have been established between this celestial child and this old wretch? Who had been able to bind the lamb to the wolf, and, a thing still more incomprehensible, attach the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf loved the lamb, for the savage being adored the frail being, for, during nine years, the angel had had the monster for a support. Cosette’s childhood and youth, her coming to the day, her maidenly growth towards life and light, had been protected by this monstrous devotion. Here, the questions exfoliated, so to speak, into innumerable enigmas, abyss opened at the bottom of abysm, and Marius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without dizziness. What then was this man precipice?"

"L’eau s’infiltrait dans de certains terrains sous-jacents, particulièrement friables ; le radier, qu’il fût de pavé, comme dans les anciens égouts ou de chaux hydraulique sur béton, comme dans les nouvelles galeries, n’ayant plus de point d’appui, pliait. Un pli dans un plancher de ce genre, c’est une fente, c’est l’écroulement. Le radier croulait sur une certaine longueur.

"― Monsieur Fauchelevent, lui disait l’aïeul, voilà un beau jour. Je vote la fin des afflictions et des chagrins. Il ne faut plus qu’il y ait de tristesse nulle part désormais. Pardieu ! je décrète la joie ! Le mal n’a pas le droit d’être. Qu’il y ait des hommes malheureux, en vérité, cela est honteux pour l’azur du ciel. Le mal ne vient pas de l’homme, qui, au fond, est bon. Toutes les misères humaines ont pour chef-lieu et pour gouvernement central l’enfer, autrement dit les Tuileries du diable. Bon, voilà que je dis des mots démagogiques à présent ! Quant à moi, je n’ai plus d’opinion politique ; que tous les hommes soient riches, c’est-à-dire joyeux, voilà à quoi je me borne.","“Monsieur Fauchelevent,” said the grandfather to him, “it’s been a fine day. I vote the end of afflictions and sorrows. There shouldn't be any sadness anywhere anymore. Pardieu! I decree joy! Evil has no right to be. That there are unhappy men, in truth, that is shameful for the azure of the sky. Evil does not come from man, who, deep down, is good. All human miseries have Hell as their capital and central government, in other words the Devil's Tuileries. Well, here I am saying demagogic words now! As for me, I no longer have a political opinion; that all men be rich, that is to say happy, that is what I limit myself to.","‘Monsieur Fauchelevent,’ the grandfather said to him, ‘this is a marvellous day. I vote for an end to affliction and sorrow. There must be no more sadness anywhere from now on. By heaven! I decree joy! Suffering has no right to exist. Really, it’s an insult to the azure of the skies that there should be any unhappy men. The problem doesn’t lie with man, who is fundamentally good. The seat and ministry of all human miseries is hell, in other words the devil’s Tuileries. Well now, here I am, talking like a demagogue! For myself, I’ve no longer any political opinions. Let all men be rich, that’s to say, happy, I’ll confine myself to that.’","“Monsieur Fauchelevent,” said the grandfather to him, “this is a fine day. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. Henceforth, there must be no sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I decree joy! Evil has no right to exist. That there should be any unhappy men is, in sooth, a disgrace to the azure of the sky. Evil does not come from man, who is good at bottom. All human miseries have for their capital and central government hell, otherwise, known as the Devil’s Tuileries. Good, here I am uttering demagogical words! As far as I am concerned, I have no longer any political opinions; let all men be rich, that is to say, mirthful, and I confine myself to that.”","“Monsieur Fauchelevent,” said the grandfather to him, “this is a happy day. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. There must no longer be any sadness anywhere henceforth. By Jove! I decree joy! Evil has no right to be.

"Troisièmement, l’expédient. L’argot vit sur la langue. Il en use à sa fantaisie, il y puise au hasard, et il se borne souvent, quand le besoin surgit, à la dénaturer sommairement et grossièrement. Parfois, avec les mots usuels ainsi déformés, et compliqués de mots d’argot pur, il compose des locutions pittoresques où l’on sent le mélange des deux éléments précédents, la création directe et la métaphore : — Le cab jaspine, je marronne que la roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri, le chien aboie, je soupçonne que la diligence de Paris passe dans le bois. — Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussière, la fée est bative, le bourgeois est bête, la bourgeoise est rusée, la fille est jolie. — Le plus souvent, afin de dérouter les écouteurs, l’argot se borne à ajouter indistinctement à tous les mots de la langue une sorte de queue ignoble, une terminaison en aille, en orgue, en iergue, ou en uche.

Slang lives on the tongue. He uses it as he pleases, he draws from it at random, and he often limits himself, when the need arises, to denaturing it summarily and grossly. Sometimes, with the usual words thus deformed, and complicated with words of pure slang, he composes picturesque phrases in which one senses the mixture of the two preceding elements, direct creation and metaphor: — Le cab jaspine, je brunne que Pantin's caravan is toiling in the sabri, the dog is barking, I suspect that the diligence from Paris is passing through the woods. — The dab is sinve, the dabuge is merloussière, the fairy is silly, the bourgeois is stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the girl is pretty. - Most often, in order to confuse the listeners, slang limits itself to adding indiscriminately to all the words of the language a sort of ignoble tail, an ending in aille, in organ, in iergue, or in uche. Thus: Vouziergue find bonorgue this gigotmuche? Do you find this lamb good? Sentence addressed by Cartouche to a teller, in order to know if the sum offered for the escape suited him. — The ending in mar was added fairly recently.","Thirdly, expediency. Slang lives off the language. It does what it likes with it, it draws on it at random and, where need arises, it is often content to alter it in a crude and summary fashion. Occasionally, with ordinary words distorted in this way and the addition of words of pure slang, picturesque phrases are created in which you can sense the mixture of the two elements just mentioned, sheer invention and metaphor: Le cab jaspine, je marronne que la roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri, ‘The dog is barking, I suspect that the coach for Paris is passing through the woods.’ Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussière, la fée est bative, ‘The bourgeois gent is stupid, his bourgeois wife is sly, their daughter is pretty.’ More often than not, so as to baffle anyone listening, slang merely adds indiscriminately to every word of the language a sort of ignominious tail, an ending in -aille, -orgue, -iergue or -uche. Thus: Vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche? ‘Is this leg of mutton to your liking?’ Which is what Cartouche said to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered for his escape was satisfactory. The -mar ending is a fairly recent addition.","In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses it in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and it often confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross and summary fashion.

Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussière, la fée est bative, the bourgeois is stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the daughter is pretty.

"Lamarque était un homme de renommée et d’action. Il avait eu successivement, sous l’empire et sous la restauration, les deux bravoures nécessaires aux deux époques, la bravoure des champs de bataille et la bravoure de la tribune. Il était éloquent comme il avait été vaillant ; on sentait une épée dans sa parole. Comme Foy, son devancier, après avoir tenu haut le commandement, il tenait haut la liberté. Il siégeait entre la gauche et l’extrême gauche, aimé du peuple parce qu’il acceptait les chances de l’avenir, aimé de la foule parce qu’il avait bien servi l’empereur. Il était, avec les comtes Gérard et Drouet, un des maréchaux in petto de Napoléon. Les traités de 1815 le soulevaient comme une offense personnelle. Il haïssait Wellington d’une haine directe qui plaisait à la multitude ; et depuis dix-sept ans, à peine attentif aux événements intermédiaires, il avait majestueusement gardé la tristesse de Waterloo. Dans son agonie, à sa dernière heure, il avait serré contre sa poitrine une épée que lui avaient décernée les officiers des Cent-jours. Napoléon était mort en prononçant le mot armée, Lamarque en prononçant le mot patrie.","Lamarque was a man of fame and action. He had had successively, under the Empire and under the Restoration, the two braveries necessary to the two periods, the bravery of the battlefields and the bravery of the tribune. He was eloquent as he had been valiant; one felt a sword in his speech. Like Foy, his predecessor, after having held command high, he held liberty high. He sat between the left and the extreme left, loved by the people because he accepted the chances of the future, loved by the crowd because he had served the emperor well. He was, with Counts Gerard and Drouet, one of Napoleon's marshals in petto. The treaties of 1815 raised it as a personal offence. He hated Wellington with a direct hatred which pleased the multitude; and for seventeen years, scarcely attentive to intermediate events, he had majestically preserved the sadness of Waterloo. In his agony, at his last hour, he had clutched to his chest a sword bestowed on him by the officers of the Hundred Days. Napoleon had died pronouncing the word army, Lamarque pronouncing the word fatherland.","Lamarque was a man of renown and a man of action. He had shown in succession, under the Empire and under the Restoration, the two kinds of bravery needed for those two periods, bravery on the battlefield and bravery on the floor of the debating chamber.

Like his predecessor Foy, having distinguished himself as a military commander he distinguished himself as a champion of liberty. He sat between the left and the extreme left, loved by the people because he welcomed the possibilities of the future, loved by the masses because he had served the emperor well. Along with Comtes Gérard and Drouet, he was one of Napoleon’s marshals in petto. The treaties of 1815 grieved him like a personal insult. He hated Wellington with a blunt hatred that pleased the crowd. And for seventeen years, scarcely attentive to intervening events, he had majestically retained the sadness of Waterloo. At the last, in his dying hour, he clasped to his breast a sword that had been presented to him by the officers of the Hundred Days. Napoleon died with the word ‘army’ on his lips, Lamarque with the word ‘country’.","Lamarque was a man of renown and of action.

"A un quart de lieue de là, de l’angle de la rue du Temple qui débouche sur le boulevard près du Château-d’Eau, si l’on avançait hardiment la tête en dehors de la pointe formée par la devanture du magasin Dallemagne, on apercevait au loin, au delà du canal, dans la rue qui monte les rampes de Belleville, au point culminant de la montée, une muraille étrange atteignant au deuxième étage des façades, sorte de trait d’union des maisons de droite aux maisons de gauche, comme si la rue avait replié d’elle-même son plus haut mur pour se fermer brusquement. Ce mur était bâti avec des pavés. Il était droit, correct, froid, perpendiculaire, nivelé à l’équerre, tiré au cordeau, aligné au fil à plomb. Le ciment y manquait sans doute, mais comme à de certains murs romains, sans troubler sa rigide architecture. A sa hauteur on devinait sa profondeur. L’entablement était mathématiquement parallèle au soubassement. On distinguait d’espace en espace, sur la surface grise, des meurtrières presque invisibles qui ressemblaient à des fils noirs. Ces meurtrières étaient séparées les unes des autres par des intervalles égaux. La rue était déserte à perte de vue. Toutes les fenêtres et toutes les portes fermées. Au fond se dressait ce barrage qui faisait de la rue un cul-de-sac ; mur immobile et tranquille ; on n’y voyait personne, on n’y entendait rien ; pas un cri, pas un bruit, pas un souffle. Un sépulcre.","A quarter of a league from there, from the corner of the rue du Temple which leads to the boulevard near the Château-d'Eau, if you boldly put your head outside the point formed by the front of the Dallemand store , we could see in the distance, beyond the canal, in the street which goes up the ramps of Belleville, at the highest point of the ascent, a strange wall reaching to the second floor of the facades, a kind of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left, as if the street had folded up its highest wall of its own accord to close abruptly. This wall was built with paving stones. It was straight, correct, cold, perpendicular, leveled at square, drawn with a line, aligned with a plumb line. The cement was no doubt missing there, but as with certain Roman walls, without disturbing its rigid architecture. From its height one guessed its depth. The entablature was mathematically parallel to the base. You could make out, from space to space, on the gray surface, almost invisible loopholes that looked like black threads. These loopholes were separated from each other by equal intervals. The street was deserted as far as the eye could see. All windows and doors closed. At the bottom stood this barrier which made the street a cul-de-sac; motionless and quiet wall; one saw no one there, one heard nothing there; not a cry, not a sound, not a breath. A sepulchre.","Not half a mile away, at the corner of Rue du Temple where it joins the boulevard near the Châteaud’Eau, if you boldly stuck your head out of the Dallemagne shop-front, which formed one of the projecting points, you could see in the distance, beyond the canal, at the very top of the street that climbs the slopes of Belleville, a strange wall reaching the façades’ second storey, a kind of link between the houses on the right and the houses on the left, as though the street had risen up to the height of its highest wall in order to close itself off abruptly. This wall was built of cobblestones. It was plumb-straight, perfectly aligned, precise, perpendicular, squared, level. It probably had no cement but, as with some Roman walls, without detriment to its sturdy architecture. You could tell how thick it was from its height. The coping was exactly parallel with the base. Discernible at intervals in its grey surface were almost invisible loopholes, like black threads. These loopholes were equally spaced. The street was deserted as far as the eye could see. All windows and doors were closed. Rising at the end of the street, this barrier created a dead end. A wall, still and quiet. No one to be seen, nothing to be heard. Not a cry, not a sound, not a breath. A sepulchre.","A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple which debouches on the boulevard near the Château-d’Eau, if one thrust one’s head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the Dallemagne shop, one perceived in the distance, beyond the canal, in the street which mounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating point of the rise, a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts, a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left, as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly. This wall was built of paving-stones. It was straight, correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled with the square, laid out by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of course, but, as in the case of certain Roman walls, without interfering with its rigid architecture. The entablature was mathematically parallel with the base. From distance to distance, one could distinguish on the gray surface, almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads. These loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as the eye could reach. All windows and doors were closed.

This wall was built of paving-stones. It was straight, correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled with the square, built by the line, aligned by the plummet. Cement doubtless there was none, but as in certain Roman walls, that did not weaken its rigid architecture. From its height its depth could be guessed. The entablature was mathematically parallel to the base. Here and there could be distinguished, on the grey surface, loopholes almost invisible, which resembled black threads. These loopholes were separated from each other by equal intervals. The street was deserted as far as could be seen. Every window and every door closed.

It’s not the dying so much; you die, for one must die, and that’s all right ; it’s the abomination of feeling those people touch you. And then, their knives; they can’t be able to cut well with them!

"La réalité est qu’ils étaient moins sauvés que Jean Valjean ne le croyait. Des périls d’un autre genre et non moins grands les attendaient peut-être.

"Ainsi, — et dans le grossissement de l’angoisse, et dans l’illusion d’optique de la consternation, tout ce qui eût pu restreindre et corriger son impression s’effaçait, et la société, et le genre humain, et l’univers se résumaient désormais à ses yeux dans un linéament simple et terrible, — ainsi la pénalité, la chose jugée, la force due à la législation, les arrêts des cours souveraines, la magistrature, le gouvernement, la prévention et la répression, la sagesse officielle, l’infaillibilité légale, le principe d’autorité, tous les dogmes sur lesquels repose la sécurité politique et civile, la souveraineté, la justice, la logique découlant du code, l’absolu social, la vérité publique, tout cela, décombre, monceau, chaos ; lui-même Javert, le guetteur de l’ordre, l’incorruptibilité au service de la police, la providence-dogue de la société, vaincu et terrassé ; et sur toute cette ruine un homme debout, le bonnet vert sur la tête et l’auréole au front ; voilà à quel bouleversement il en était venu ; voilà la vision effroyable qu’il avait dans l’âme.","Thus, - and in the magnification of anguish, and in the optical illusion of consternation, all that could have restricted and corrected his impression was erased, and society, and the human race, and the universe were henceforth summed up in his eyes in a simple and terrible lineament—thus penalty, res judicata, the force due to legislation, the judgments of sovereign courts, the magistracy, government, prevention and repression, wisdom official, legal infallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which political and civil security rests, sovereignty, justice, the logic deriving from the code, the social absolute, public truth, all this, rubble , heap, chaos; himself Javert, the watchman of order, incorruptibility in the service of the police, the mastiff-providence of society, vanquished and overthrown; and over all this ruin a man standing, the green cap on his head and the halo on his forehead; this is what an upheaval he had come to; such was the dreadful vision which he had in his soul.","This being the case – and everything that might have curbed and corrected his impression was effaced by the exaggeration of anguish and by the distortion of dismay, and society and the human race and the universe were now reduced in his eyes to hideously simplified contours – this being the case, then, punishment, the final sentence, the force of law, the rulings of sovereign courts, the magistrature, the government, prevention and repression, official wisdom, legal infallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which political and civil security rest, sovereignty, justice, the logic following from the law as it stands, the social absolute, the public truth – all this was rubble, debris, chaos.

"L’aïeul eut de la tête aux pieds tout le frisson que peuvent avoir des membres ossifiés, ses yeux dont la cornée était jaune à cause du grand âge se voilèrent d’une sorte de miroitement vitreux, toute sa face prit en un instant les angles terreux d’une tête de squelette, ses bras tombèrent pendants comme si un ressort s’y fût brisé, et sa stupeur se traduisit par l’écartement des doigts de ses deux vieilles mains toutes tremblantes, ses genoux firent un angle en avant, laissant voir par l’ouverture de la robe de chambre ses pauvres jambes nues hérissées de poils blancs, et il murmura :","The ancestor had from head to toe all the shiver that ossified limbs can have, his eyes, whose corneas were yellow because of old age, veiled themselves in a sort of glassy shimmer, his whole face took on the angles earthy with the head of a skeleton, his arms fell down as if a spring had broken there, and his amazement was expressed by the separation of the fingers of his two old hands, all trembling, his knees made an angle forward, leaving see through the opening of the dressing gown his poor bare legs bristling with white hair, and he murmured:","The grandfather shuddered from head to foot as much as ossified limbs would allow; a kind of vitreous sheen veiled his eyes whose corneas were yellowed because of his great age; his whole face acquired in an instant the ashen angularity of a skeleton’s skull, his arms hung loose as though a spring had broken, and his amazement was conveyed by the outspread fingers of his two aged hands all atremble; his knees were bent, exposing through the front of his dressing-gown his poor bare legs bristling with white hairs, and he murmured, ‘Marius!’","The grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified limbs can tremble, his eyes, whose corneæ were yellow on account of his great age, were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter, his whole face assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull, his arms fell pendent, as though a spring had broken, and his amazement was betrayed by the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands, which quivered all over, his knees formed an angle in front, allowing, through the opening in his dressing-gown, a view of his poor bare legs, all bristling with white hairs, and he murmured:","The grandfather had, from head to foot, as much of a shiver as ossified limbs can have; his eyes, the cornea of which had become yellow from his great age, were veiled with a sort of glassy haze; his whole face assumed in an instant the cadaverous angles of a skeleton head, his arms fell pendent as if a spring were broken in them, and his stupefied astonishment was expressed by the separation of the fingers of his aged, tremulous hands; his knees bent forward, showing through the opening of his nightgown his poor naked legs bristling with white hairs, and he murmured:"
"L’utopie d’ailleurs, convenons-en, sort de sa sphère radieuse en faisant la guerre. Elle, la vérité de demain, elle emprunte son procédé, la bataille, au mensonge d’hier. Elle, l’avenir, elle agit comme le passé. Elle, l’idée pure, elle devient voie de fait. Elle complique son héroïsme d’une violence dont il est juste qu’elle réponde ; violence d’occasion et d’expédient, contraire aux principes, et dont elle est fatalement punie. L’utopie insurrection combat, le vieux code militaire au poing ; elle fusille les espions, elle exécute les traîtres, elle supprime des êtres vivants et les jette dans les ténèbres inconnues. Elle se sert de la mort, chose grave. Il semble que l’utopie n’ait plus foi dans le rayonnement, sa force irrésistible et incorruptible. Elle frappe avec le glaive. Or aucun glaive n’est simple. Toute épée a deux tranchants ; qui blesse avec l’un se blesse à l’autre.","Utopia, moreover, let us agree, emerges from its radiant sphere by waging war. She, the truth of tomorrow, she borrows her process, the battle, from the lie of yesterday. She, the future, acts like the past. She, the pure idea, becomes an assault. It complicates its heroism with a violence to which it is just that it respond; occasional and expedient violence, contrary to principles, and for which it is fatally punished. The insurrection utopia is fighting, the old military code in hand; it shoots spies, it executes traitors, it suppresses living beings and casts them into unknown darkness. She uses death, a serious thing. It seems that utopia no longer has faith in radiation, its irresistible and incorruptible force. She strikes with the sword. But no sword is simple. Every sword has two edges; who hurts with one hurts the other.","In any case, let us admit that, when it makes war, Utopia forsakes its radiant sphere. The truth of tomorrow, which it is, borrows its method of operation, armed conflict, from the untruth of yesterday. The future, which it is, behaves like the past. The pure ideal, which it is, becomes an act of violence. It complicates its heroism with a violence for which it is rightly accountable, an opportunistic and expedient violence that goes against principle and for which it is inevitably punished. The Utopian insurrection fights upholding the old military code. It shoots spies, it executes traitors, it does away with living beings and casts them into uncharted darkness. It resorts to death, which is a serious matter. It is as if Utopia had no more faith in radiance, in its irresistible and incorruptible force. It strikes with the sword. Now, no sword cuts only one way. Every blade is double-edged. Whoever wounds with one edge wounds himself on the other.","Utopia, moreover, we must admit, quits its radiant sphere when it makes war. It, the truth of to-morrow, borrows its mode of procedure, battle, from the lie of yesterday. It, the future, behaves like the past. It, pure idea, becomes a deed of violence. It complicates its heroism with a violence for which it is just that it should be held to answer; a violence of occasion and expedient, contrary to principle, and for which it is fatally punished. The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the old military code in its fist; it shoots spies, it executes traitors; it suppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness. It makes use of death, a serious matter. It seems as though Utopia had no longer any faith in radiance, its irresistible and incorruptible force. It strikes with the sword. Now, no sword is simple. Every blade has two edges; he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other.","Utopia, moreover, we must admit, departs from its radiant sphere in making war.

She compromises her heroism by a violence for which it is just that she should answer; a violence of opportunity and of expediency, contrary to principles, and for which she is fatally punished.
