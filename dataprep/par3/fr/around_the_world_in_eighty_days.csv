"Le lendemain, les habitants de Saville-row auraient été bien surpris, si on leur eût affirmé que Mr. Fogg avait réintégré son domicile. Portes et fenêtres, tout était clos. Aucun changement ne s'était produit à l'extérieur.","The next day, the inhabitants of Saville-row would have been very surprised if they had been told that Mr. Fogg had returned to his home.

No change had occurred on the outside.",The following day the inhabitants of Savile Row would certainly have been surprised to be informed that Mr Fogg was back in residence.

"Oui ! c'était un étonnement de tous les jours pour Passepartout, qui lisait tant de reconnaissance envers son maître dans les yeux de la jeune femme ! Décidément Phileas Fogg n'avait de cœur que ce qu'il en fallait pour se conduire héroïquement, mais amoureusement, non ! Quant aux préoccupations que les chances de ce voyage pouvaient faire naître en lui, il n'y en avait pas trace. Mais Passepartout, lui, vivait dans des transes continuelles. Un jour, appuyé sur la rambarde de l'« engine-room », il regardait la puissante machine qui s'emportait parfois, quand dans un violent mouvement de tangage, l'hélice s'affolait hors des flots. La vapeur fusait alors par les soupapes, ce qui provoqua la colère du digne garçon.","Yes ! it was a daily astonishment for Passepartout, who read so much gratitude towards his master in the eyes of the young woman! Definitely Phileas Fogg had only enough heart to behave heroically, but lovingly, no! As for the preoccupations that the chances of this trip might arouse in him, there was no trace of them. But Passepartout lived in continual trances. One day, leaning on the railing of the ""engine-room"", he watched the powerful machine which sometimes got carried away when, in a violent pitching movement, the propeller panicked out of the waves. The steam then burst through the valves, which angered the worthy fellow.","Yes. This was an unfailing source of amazement to Passepartout, who read all that gratitude towards his master in the young woman’s eyes. It was clear that Phileas Fogg had what it took to be a hero, but certainly not what was needed to be a lover. As for concern about the success of the journey, he gave no sign of any. Passepartout, however, was constantly on tenterhooks. One day when he was leaning on the handrail of the engine room, he watched the powerful machinery race away from time to time as the boat pitched suddenly, making the propeller spin wildly clean out of the water. Steam then came pouring out of the valves, making the dear fellow very angry.","the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout’s great surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune. It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in Aouda’s eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless. As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries. One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant."
"À midi, la Tankadère n'était pas à plus de quarante-cinq milles de Shangaï. Il lui restait six heures encore pour gagner ce port avant le départ du paquebot de Yokohama.",At noon the Tankadere was not more than forty-five miles from Shanghai. He still had six hours to reach this port before the steamer left Yokohama.,By midday the Tankadère was only about forty-five miles from Shanghai.

There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish that distance."
"Cependant le paquebot s'avançait rapidement. Le 13, on eut connaissance de Moka, qui apparut dans sa ceinture de murailles ruinées, au-dessus desquelles se détachaient quelques dattiers verdoyants. Au loin, dans les montagnes, se développaient de vastes champs de caféiers. Passepartout fut ravi de contempler cette ville célèbre, et il trouva même qu'avec ces murs circulaires et un fort démantelé qui se dessinait comme une anse, elle ressemblait à une énorme demi-tasse.","However, the steamer was advancing rapidly. On the 13th, Moka was known, which appeared in its belt of ruined walls, above which rose a few verdant date palms. In the distance, in the mountains, were developing vast fields of coffee trees. Passepartout was delighted to contemplate this famous city, and he even found that with these circular walls and a dismantled fort that stood out like a cove, it looked like an enormous half-cup.","Meanwhile the ship was making rapid progress. On 13 October, Mocha4 was sighted, surrounded by its ruined walls above which stood out green date palms. In the distance, towards the mountains, huge fields of coffee plants stretched out. Passepartout was delighted to contemplate this famous town, and he even thought that with its circular walls and its tumbled-down fort sticking out like a handle it looked like a giant-sized coffee cup.","Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th, Mocha, surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing, was sighted, and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields. Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer."
"Que faisait donc cet original, emprisonné dans le Mongolia ? D'abord il faisait ses quatre repas par jour, sans que jamais ni roulis ni tangage pussent détraquer une machine si merveilleusement organisée. Puis il jouait au whist.","What was this eccentric doing, imprisoned in Mongolia? First he ate his four meals a day, without ever rolling or pitching being able to disturb such a marvelously organized machine. Then he played whist.","So what was this eccentric doing, imprisoned as he was on the Mongolia? First of all, he took his four daily meals, without the rolling or pitching of the ship ever being able to disturb such a perfectly regulated piece of machinery. Then he played whist.","How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the Mongolia? He made his four hearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably, for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself."

À grande vitesse !","- What ! careful ! cried Colonel Proctor, who was surprised at this word, heard by chance. At high speed, we tell you! Do you understand ? High speed !","‘What! Sensible!’ exclaimed Colonel Proctor, who jumped at the mention of this word, which he’d accidentally overheard. ‘Do you understand? At full speed!’","“What!

"Et, en effet, il n'était pas une heure, que ce guide habile, abandonnant la barre, se précipitait aux drisses des voiles et les amenait en bande, pendant que le traîneau, emporté par son irrésistible élan, franchissait encore un demi-mille à sec de toile. Enfin il s'arrêta, et Mudge, montrant un amas de toits blancs de neige, disait :","And, in fact, it was not one o'clock when this skilful guide, leaving the helm, rushed to the halyards of the sails and brought them in a band, while the sledge, carried away by its irresistible momentum, crossed another half-hour. dry mile of canvas. At last he stopped, and Mudge, pointing to a cluster of snow-white roofs, said:","And sure enough, less than an hour later this skilful guide left the helm, rushed to the halyards and lowered the sails while the sledge, carried along by its own momentum, travelled another half a mile with all its sails taken in. At last it came to a standstill and Mudge, pointing to a collection of snow-covered roofs, said, ‘We’ve arrived.’","In less than an hour he left the rudder and furled his sails, whilst the sledge, carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it, went on half a mile further with its sails unspread.

"Tout en faisant ses emplettes, Passepartout eut bientôt vu la ville, autrefois défendue par un fort magnifique qui est devenu une prison d'État. Plus de commerce, plus d'industrie dans cette cité, jadis industrielle et commerçante. Passepartout, qui cherchait vainement un magasin de nouveautés, comme s'il eût été dans Regent-street à quelques pas de Farmer et Co., ne trouva que chez un revendeur, vieux juif difficultueux, les objets dont il avait besoin, une robe en étoffe écossaise, un vaste manteau, et une magnifique pelisse en peau de loutre qu'il n'hésita pas à payer soixante-quinze livres (1 875 F). Puis, tout triomphant, il retourna à la gare.","While shopping, Passepartout soon saw the town, once defended by a magnificent fort that became a state prison. More trade, more industry in this city, formerly industrial and commercial. Passepartout, who was looking in vain for a novelty store, as if he had been in Regent-street a few steps from Farmer and Co., found only in a dealer, an old difficult Jew, the objects he needed, a dress in Scottish fabric, a huge coat, and a magnificent otter-skin fur coat for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds (1,875 F). Then, all triumphant, he returned to the station.","As he made his purchases it didn’t take Passepartout long to see the whole of the town, which in the past had been defended by a magnificent fort that is now a state prison. There were no longer any businesses or industries in what had previously been an important commercial and industrial centre. Passepartout searched in vain for a department store as if he was in Oxford Street, but he had to go to a second-hand shop run by a pernickety old Jew to find the items he needed, a tartan dress, a large cloak and a magnificent fur coat made out of otter’s skin, which he had no hesitation in paying £75 for. Then he returned in triumph to the station.","Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, to take a good look at the city. It was formerly defended by a noble fort, which has since become a state prison; its commerce has dwindled away, and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street. At last he came upon an elderly, crusty Jew, who sold second-hand articles, and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff, a large mantle, and a fine otter-skin pelisse, for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds. He then returned triumphantly to the station."
"Cependant Mr. Fogg ne se déconcertait pas, et il allait continuer ses recherches, dût-il pousser jusqu'à Macao, quand il fut accosté par un marin sur l'avant-port.","However Mr. Fogg was not disconcerted, and he was going to continue his search, even if he had to push as far as Macao, when he was accosted by a sailor on the outer harbour.","However, Mr Fogg was not in the least put out and he was intent on continuing his efforts, even if he had to go as far afield as Macao, when a sailor came up to him in the outer harbour.","But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves."

"Il faut renoncer à peindre l'anxiété dans laquelle, pendant trois jours, vécut tout ce monde de la société anglaise.

Even the police had no idea of the whereabouts of Inspector Fix, who had so unfortunately followed the wrong lead. None of this, however, prevented the betting from starting up again and on an even greater scale. Like a racehorse, Phileas Fogg was now into the final straight.

"Cette circonstance impressionna vivement la jeune femme. Elle s'était attachée à l'homme qui, si froidement que ce fût, lui donnait chaque jour les marques du plus absolu dévouement. Elle ne comprenait pas, sans doute, toute la profondeur du sentiment que lui inspirait son sauveur, et à ce sentiment elle ne donnait encore que le nom de reconnaissance, mais, à son insu, il y avait plus que cela. Aussi son cœur se serra-t-il, quand elle reconnut le grossier personnage auquel Mr. Fogg voulait tôt ou tard demander raison de sa conduite. Évidemment, c'était le hasard seul qui avait amené dans ce train le colonel Proctor, mais enfin il y était, et il fallait empêcher à tout prix que Phileas Fogg aperçut son adversaire.","This circumstance deeply impressed the young woman. She had attached herself to the man who, however coldly, showed her every day the marks of the most absolute devotion. She doubtless did not understand all the depth of the feeling which her savior inspired in her, and to this feeling she still gave only the name of gratitude, but, unbeknownst to her, there was more than that. And so her heart sank when she recognized the rude personage to whom Mr. Fogg wanted sooner or later to ask the reason for his conduct. Obviously, it was chance alone that had brought Colonel Proctor on this train, but he was there anyway, and Phileas Fogg had to be prevented at all costs from seeing his adversary.","This incident had a considerable effect on the young woman. She had become attached to the man who, for all his coldness, gave her every day ample evidence of his complete devotion. No doubt she was unaware of the depth of the feeling that her saviour aroused in her and gratitude was still the only name she gave it, but without her knowing there was more to it than that. She therefore became very tense when she recognized the vulgar character whom, sooner or later, Mr Fogg would want to call to account for his behaviour. It was obviously a sheer coincidence that Colonel Proctor had got on this train, but that was the fact of the matter and Phileas Fogg had to be prevented at all costs from catching sight of his opponent.","Not wishing to be recognised, the young woman drew back from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery. She was attached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion. She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was really more than that. Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for his conduct. Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctor on this train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all hazards, that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary."
"— Sans doute, répondit Gauthier Ralph. Je suis de l'avis de Mr. Fogg. La terre a diminué, puisqu'on la parcourt maintenant dix fois plus vite qu'il y a cent ans. Et c'est ce qui, dans le cas dont nous nous occupons, rendra les recherches plus rapides.","""No doubt,"" replied Gauthier Ralph. I agree with Mr. Fogg. The earth has shrunk, since it is now traversed ten times faster than a hundred years ago. And that is what, in the case we are dealing with, will make searches faster.","‘Certainly,’ replied Gauthier Ralph. ‘I agree with Mr Fogg. The earth has got smaller because you can now travel around it ten times as quickly as a hundred years ago. And, in relation to this particular case, that’s what will speed up the police inquiries.’","“Certainly,” returned Ralph. “I agree with Mr. Fogg. The world has grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago. And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed.”"

It was possible, therefore, that they might meet up with him again in Yokohama, and it would be easy to find out if he had got there on the Carnatic.","Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely disappeared.

"Mr. Fogg, ne voulant pas exposer Mrs. Aouda aux tortures d'une traversée en plein air, par ce froid que la vitesse rendrait plus insupportable encore, lui proposa de rester sous la garde de Passepartout à la station de Kearney.

In any case, he wouldn’t have wanted to leave his master for anything in the world since Fix was to remain with him.","But Aouda refused to separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was delighted with her decision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix was with him."

"Cette locomotive qui marchait à petite vapeur, en jetant de grands coups de sifflet, c'était celle qui, après avoir été détachée du train, avait continué sa route avec une si effrayante vitesse, emportant le chauffeur et le mécanicien inanimés.

She had run on the rails for several miles; then the fire had gone down, for lack of fuel; the steam had slackened, and an hour later, slowing its progress little by little, the engine finally stopped twenty miles beyond the station of Kearney.","This locomotive that was moving forward so slowly, letting out loud blasts on the whistle, was the one that after being uncoupled from the train had continued to run at such a terrifying speed, taking with it the fireman and the driver, who were both unconscious. It had gone on for a few miles, but then the fire had died down because of a lack of fuel. The steam had given out and an hour later, after gradually slowing down, the engine at last came to a halt about twenty miles beyond the station at Kearney.","The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles, was that which, having been detached from the train, had continued its route with such terrific rapidity, carrying off the unconscious engineer and stoker. It had run several miles, when, the fire becoming low for want of fuel, the steam had slackened; and it had finally stopped an hour after, some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney."

Continuing the road in the direction of Omaha was prudent; going back to the train, which the Indians were perhaps still looting, was dangerous… It doesn't matter!

It was she who whistled in the mist.","The driver had no hesitation about what to do. The sensible thing was to continue in the direction of Omaha. To go back towards the train, which the Sioux might still be in the process of ransacking, was fraught with danger. Never mind this.

This was the whistling noise heard in the fog.","He did not hesitate what to do. It would be prudent to continue on to Omaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train, which the Indians might still be engaged in pillaging.

"On comprend à quel point l'agent devait être intrigué. Il se demanda s'il n'y avait pas dans cette affaire quelque criminel enlèvement. Oui ! cela devait être ! Cette idée s'incrusta dans le cerveau de Fix, et il reconnut tout le parti qu'il pouvait tirer de cette circonstance.

He wondered if there was not some criminal kidnapping involved in this affair. Yes ! it had to be! This idea sank into Fix's brain, and he recognized all the advantage he could derive from this circumstance.

He wondered if there might not be an element of criminal abduction about this business. Yes! That must be it! This idea took a firm hold in Fix’s mind and he realized all the advantage he could derive from the situation. Whether the young woman was married or not, it was still an abduction, and in Hong Kong it was possible to stir up enough trouble for the abductor for him not simply to buy his way out.","He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue. Whether the young woman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money."

"Ce départ précipité de Londres, peu de temps après le vol, cette grosse somme emportée, cette hâte d'arriver en des pays lointains, ce prétexte d'un pari excentrique, tout confirmait et devait confirmer Fix dans ses idées. Il fit encore parler le Français et acquit la certitude que ce garçon ne connaissait aucunement son maître, que celui-ci vivait isolé à Londres, qu'on le disait riche sans savoir l'origine de sa fortune, que c'était un homme impénétrable, etc. Mais, en même temps, Fix put tenir pour certain que Phileas Fogg ne débarquait point à Suez, et qu'il allait réellement à Bombay.","This hasty departure from London shortly after the flight, this large sum carried off, this haste to arrive in distant lands, this pretext for an eccentric bet, all confirmed and were to confirm Fix in his ideas.

He got the Frenchman to tell him more and became convinced that this fellow didn’t know his master at all, that the latter lived alone in London, that he was thought to be rich but no one knew where his money came from, that he was an unfathomable individual, etc. But at the same time Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not disembark at Suez and that he really was going to Bombay.","The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet - all confirmed Fix in his theory.

"Mais les éléphants sont chers dans l'Inde, où ils commencent à devenir rares. Les mâles, qui seuls conviennent aux luttes des cirques, sont extrêmement recherchés.

"Anglais, à coup sûr, Phileas Fogg n'était peut-être pas londonner. On ne l' avait jamais vu ni à la bourse, ni à la banque, ni dans aucun des comptoirs de la cité. Ni les bassins ni les docks de Londres n'avaient jamais reçu un navire ayant pour armateur Phileas Fogg. Ce gentleman ne figurait dans aucun comité d'administration. Son nom n'avait jamais retenti dans un collège d'avocats, ni au temple, ni à Lincoln's-Inn, ni à Gray's-Inn. Jamais il ne plaida ni à la cour du chancelier, ni au banc de la reine, ni à l'échiquier, ni en cour ecclésiastique. Il n'était ni industriel, ni négociant, ni marchand, ni agriculteur. Il ne faisait partie ni de l'Institution royale de la Grande-Bretagne, ni de l'Institution de Londres, ni de l'Institution des Artisans, ni de l'Institution Russell, ni de l'Institution littéraire de l'Ouest, ni de l'Institution du Droit, ni de cette Institution des Arts et des Sciences réunis, qui est placée sous le patronage direct de Sa Gracieuse Majesté.

He had never been seen either at the stock exchange, or at the bank, or at any of the counters in the city.

His name had never sounded in a college of lawyers, nor in the temple, nor in Lincoln's-Inn, nor in Gray's-Inn. He never pleaded either at the court of the chancellor, or at the queen's bench, or at the exchequer, or in the ecclesiastical court.

Finally, he belonged to none of the many societies that abound in the capital of England, from the Society of the Armonica to the Entomological Society, founded mainly for the purpose of destroying harmful insects.","Though he was undoubtedly English, Phileas Fogg was not necessarily a Londoner. He had never been seen at the Stock Exchange or the Bank of England, or in any of the financial institutions of the City. No dock or basin in London had ever handled a ship whose owner was called Phileas Fogg. The gentleman in question did not figure on any list of board of directors.

He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan’s Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences.

"Quant à Passepartout, il s'était pris très sérieusement à méditer sur le singulier hasard qui avait mis, encore une fois, Fix sur la route de son maître. Et, en effet, on eût été étonné à moins. Ce gentleman, très aimable, très complaisant à coup sûr, que l'on rencontre d'abord à Suez, qui s'embarque sur le Mongolia, qui débarque à Bombay, où il dit devoir séjourner, que l'on retrouve sur le Rangoon, faisant route pour Hong-Kong, en un mot, suivant pas à pas l'itinéraire de Mr. Fogg, cela valait la peine qu'on y réfléchît. Il y avait là une concordance au moins bizarre. À qui en avait ce Fix ? Passepartout était prêt a parier ses babouches — il les avait précieusement conservées — que le Fix quitterait Hong-Kong en même temps qu'eux, et probablement sur le même paquebot.","As for Passepartout, he had taken himself very seriously to meditate on the singular chance which had once again put Fix in the path of his master. And, indeed, one would have been astonished had it not been so. This gentleman, very pleasant, very obliging for sure, whom we meet first in Suez, who embarks on the Mongolia, who disembarks in Bombay, where he says he must stay, who we find on the Rangoon , on his way to Hong-Kong, in a word, following Mr. Fogg's itinerary step by step, it was worth thinking about. There was a concordance there, at least bizarre. Who had this Fix? Passepartout was ready to bet his slippers—he had carefully kept them—that the Fix would leave Hong Kong at the same time as them, and probably on the same liner.","Passepartout, for his part, had begun to think very hard about the strange coincidence that had resulted once again in Fix meeting up with his master during their travels and, all in all, that was hardly surprising. This gentleman, who was very friendly and certainly very obliging, who had turned up in Suez then embarked on the Mongolia and disembarked at Bombay, where he said he had to stay, who then showed up again on the Rangoon, on the way to Hong Kong, who in a word was following Mr Fogg step by step on his journey: all this really was something to think about. There was something strange, at the very least, about all these coincidental meetings. Who was this Fix after? Passepartout was ready to bet his oriental slippers – he had taken great care of them – that this Fix fellow would leave Hong Kong at the same time as them and probably by the same steamer.","Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board the Mongolia, who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the Rangoon, was following Mr. Fogg’s tracks step by step. What was Fix’s object? Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes - which he religiously preserved - that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them, and probably on the same steamer."
"Autour du lac, la campagne était admirablement cultivée, car les Mormons s'entendent aux travaux de la terre : des ranchos et des corrals pour les animaux domestiques, des champs de blé, de maïs, de sorgho, des prairies luxuriantes, partout des haies de rosiers sauvages, des bouquets d'acacias et d'euphorbes, tel eût été l'aspect de cette contrée, six mois plus tard ; mais en ce moment le sol disparaissait sous une mince couche de neige, qui le poudrait légèrement.","Around the lake, the countryside was admirably cultivated, for the Mormons understood how to work the land: ranchos and corrals for domestic animals, fields of wheat, corn, sorghum, luxuriant meadows, hedges everywhere. wild roses, clumps of acacias and euphorbias, such would have been the aspect of this country six months later; but at this moment the ground was disappearing under a thin layer of snow, which powdered it slightly.","The countryside surrounding the lake is extremely well cultivated, since the Mormons are experts at working the land.

"Le temps, assez beau jusqu'alors, changea avec le dernier quartier de la lune. Il y eut grosse mer. Le vent souffla quelquefois en grande brise, mais très heureusement de la partie du sud-est, ce qui favorisait la marche du steamer. Quand il était maniable, le capitaine faisait établir la voilure. Le Rangoon, gréé en brick, navigua souvent avec ses deux huniers et sa misaine, et sa rapidité s'accrut sous la double action de la vapeur et du vent. C'est ainsi que l'on prolongea, sur une lame courte et parfois très fatigante, les côtes d'Annam et de Cochinchine.","The weather, which had been fairly fine until then, changed with the last quarter of the moon. There was a heavy sea. The wind sometimes blew in a strong breeze, but very fortunately from the south-eastern part, which favored the progress of the steamer. When it was manageable, the captain had the sails set. The Rangoon, rigged as a brig, often sailed with her two topsails and her foresail, and her speed increased under the double action of steam and wind. This is how we prolonged, on a short and sometimes very tiring wave, the coasts of Annam and Cochinchina.","The weather, which had been generally fine up to then, changed as the moon entered its last quarter. The sea became rough. The wind sometimes got up, but very fortunately it was blowing from the south-east, which helped the steamer to go faster. When the wind was moderate the captain put up the sails. The Rangoon, which had the rigging of a brig, often sailed with its two topsails and its foresail, and its speed increased under the combined effect of steam and wind. And so it was that they followed the coastline of Annam and Cochin China2 on a choppy and very tiring sea.","The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last quarter of the moon. The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus aided the steamer’s progress. The captain as often as possible put up his sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China."

"En sortant de Sacramento, le train, après avoir dépassé les stations de Junction, de Roclin, d'Auburn et de Colfax, s'engagea dans le massif de la Sierra Nevada. Il était sept heures du matin quand fut traversée la station de Cisco. Une heure après, le dortoir était redevenu un wagon ordinaire et les voyageurs pouvaient à travers les vitres entrevoir les points de vue pittoresques de ce montagneux pays. Le tracé du train obéissait aux caprices de la Sierra, ici accroché aux flancs de la montagne, là suspendu au-dessus des précipices, évitant les angles brusques par des courbes audacieuses, s'élançant dans des gorges étroites que l'on devait croire sans issues. La locomotive, étincelante comme une châsse, avec son grand fanal qui jetait de fauves lueurs, sa cloche argentée, son « chasse-vache », qui s'étendait comme un éperon, mêlait ses sifflements et ses mugissements à ceux des torrent et des cascades, et tordait sa fumée à la noire ramure des sapins.","Leaving Sacramento, the train, after passing the stations of Junction, Roclin, Auburn and Colfax, entered the Sierra Nevada massif. It was seven o'clock in the morning when the Cisco station was crossed. An hour later, the dormitory had once again become an ordinary train car and through the windows travelers could catch a glimpse of the picturesque views of this mountainous country. The route of the train obeyed the whims of the Sierra, here clinging to the sides of the mountain, there suspended above the precipices, avoiding abrupt angles by daring curves, rushing into narrow gorges that one had to believe without issues. The locomotive, sparkling like a reliquary, with its great beacon which cast wild lights, its silver bell, its ""cow-hunter"", which extended like a spur, mingled its whistles and its bellows with those of the torrents and the waterfalls. , and twisted its smoke in the black branches of the fir trees.","After Sacramento the train, once it had gone past the stations at Junction, Rochin, Auburn and Colfax, entered the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It was seven o’clock in the morning when it went through the station at Cisco. One hour later the dormitory was once again an ordinary carriage and the travellers were able to catch a glimpse through the windows of the picturesque panoramas of this mountainous region. The route taken by the train followed the twists and turns of the Sierra, at times clinging to the mountainside, at others hanging over precipices, avoiding tight corners by cutting bold curves, rushing into narrow gorges with apparently no way through. The locomotive sparkled like a box of jewels, with its great lantern that gave off a yellowish light, its silver bell and its cowcatcher that jutted out like a spur, and as it went the noise of its whistling and roaring mingled with the sound of the streams and waterfalls and its smoke twisted itself around the black branches of the fir trees.","The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction, Roclin, Auburn, and Colfax, entered the range of the Sierra Nevada. ‘Cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car, and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming. The railway track wound in and out among the passes, now approaching the mountain-sides, now suspended over precipices, avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves, plunging into narrow defiles, which seemed to have no outlet. The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a weird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a spur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines."

"Ce qui était certain toutefois, c'est que, depuis de longues années, Phileas Fogg n'avait pas quitté Londres. Ceux qui avaient l'honneur de le connaître un peu plus que les autres attestaient que, — si ce n'est sur ce chemin direct qu' il parcourait chaque jour pour venir de sa maison au club, — personne ne pouvait prétendre l'avoir jamais vu ailleurs. Son seul passe-temps était de lire les journaux et de jouer au whist. À ce jeu du silence, si bien approprié à sa nature, il gagnait souvent, mais ses gains n'entraient jamais dans sa bourse et figuraient pour une somme importante à son budget de charité. D'ailleurs, il faut le remarquer, Mr. Fogg jouait évidemment pour jouer, non pour gagner. Le jeu était pour lui un combat, une lutte contre une difficulté, mais une lutte sans mouvement, sans déplacement, sans fatigue, et cela allait à son caractère.","What was certain, however, was that for many years Phileas Fogg had not left London. Those who had the honor of knowing him a little better than the others testified that—except on this direct route he traveled every day to come from his house to the club—no one could claim to have him. never seen elsewhere. His only pastime was reading newspapers and playing whist. At this game of silence, so appropriate to his nature, he often won, but his winnings never entered his purse and figured for a large sum in his charitable budget. Besides, it should be noted, Mr. Fogg obviously played to play, not to win. The game was for him a fight, a fight against a difficulty, but a fight without movement, without movement, without fatigue, and that suited his character.","What was beyond doubt, however, was that Phileas Fogg had not been outside London for many years. Those who had the privilege of knowing him better than most could confirm that the only sightings of him were as he walked each day from his house straight to his club. His only pastimes were reading the newspapers and playing whist. He often won when he played this silent game that was so well suited to his temperament, but his winnings never went into his own pocket. They made up instead a large part of what he gave to charity. It should also be noted that it was obvious that Mr Fogg played for enjoyment and not to win. The game of whist was for him a combat, a struggle against difficulty, but a struggle that did not require him to go anywhere or travel around or tire himself out, and all that suited his temperament.","It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years. Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist. He often won at this game, which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes."
"En effet, le General-Grant, le 23 novembre, passait au cent quatre-vingtième méridien, celui sur lequel se trouvent, dans l'hémisphère austral, les antipodes de Londres. Sur quatre-vingts jours mis à sa disposition, Mr. Fogg, il est vrai, en avait employé cinquante-deux, et il ne lui en restait plus que vingt-huit à dépenser. Mais il faut remarquer que si le gentleman se trouvait à moitié route seulement « par la différence des méridiens », il avait en réalité accompli plus des deux tiers du parcours total. Quels détours forcés, en effet, de Londres à Aden, d'Aden à Bombay, de Calcutta à Singapore, de Singapore à Yokohama ! À suivre circulairement le cinquantième parallèle, qui est celui de Londres, la distance n'eût été que de douze mille milles environ, tandis que Phileas Fogg était forcé, par les caprices des moyens de locomotion, d'en parcourir vingt-six mille dont il avait fait environ dix-sept mille cinq cents, à cette date du 23 novembre. Mais maintenant la route était droite, et Fix n'était plus là pour y accumuler les obstacles !","In fact, the General Grant, on November 23, passed the one hundred and eightieth meridian, that on which are found, in the southern hemisphere, the antipodes of London. Out of eighty days at his disposal, Mr. Fogg, it is true, had used up fifty-two, and he had but twenty-eight left to spend. But it should be noted that if the gentleman was only halfway ""by the difference of the meridians"", he had in reality accomplished more than two-thirds of the total course. What forced detours, indeed, from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to Singapore, from Singapore to Yokohama! To follow in a circle the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the distance would have been only about twelve thousand miles, while Phileas Fogg was forced, by the caprices of the means of locomotion, to cover twenty-six thousand of which he had made about seventeen thousand five hundred, on this date, November 23rd. But now the road was straight, and Fix was no longer there to pile up obstacles!","So it was that on 23 November the General Grant reached the 180th meridian, the one which in the southern hemisphere stands at the antipodes of London. Of the eighty days he had available, it is true that Mr Fogg had used up fifty-two and had only twenty-eight left. But it should be remembered that if the gentleman was only halfway in terms of the difference of meridians, in reality he had completed more than two-thirds of his total journey. This was the result of all those enforced detours between London and Aden, between Aden and Bombay, between Calcutta and Singapore and between Singapore and Yokohama. If he had followed all the way the fiftieth parallel, the one which runs through London, the distance would only have been about 12,000 miles, whereas Phileas Fogg was obliged by the vagaries of his means of transport to cover 26,000 miles, of which he had done about 17,500 by this date of 23 November. But now the route was direct and Fix was no longer around to put more obstacles in their way.","The General Grant passed, on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and was at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true, exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour, and there were only twenty-eight left. But, though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November, accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred. And now the course was a straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!"

"En effet, aucun des autres paquebots qui font le service direct entre l'Amérique et l'Europe, ni les transatlantiques français, ni les navires du « White-Star-line », ni les steamers de la Compagnie Imman, ni ceux de la ligne Hambourgeoise, ni autres, ne pouvaient servir les projets du gentleman.","In fact, none of the other steamers which make the direct service between America and Europe, neither the French transatlantic ships, nor the ships of the ""White-Star-line"", nor the steamers of the Imman Company, nor those of the Hamburg line, nor others, could not serve the projects of the gentleman.","No other steamer plying the direct route from America to Europe could further the gentleman’s plans. This applied to the French transatlantic steamers, the ships of the White Star Line, the steamers of the Inman Company, those of the Hamburg Line and any others.",None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects.
"Mais alors une pensée vint à Passepartout, cette pensée terrible qu'il était décidément la cause de tout ce malheur ! En effet, pourquoi avait il caché cette aventure à Mr. Fogg ? Quand Fix avait révélé et sa qualité d'inspecteur de police et la mission dont il était chargé, pourquoi avait-il pris sur lui de ne point avertir son maître ? Celui-ci, prévenu, aurait sans doute donné à Fix des preuves de son innocence ; il lui aurait démontré son erreur ; en tout cas, il n'eût pas véhiculé à ses frais et à ses trousses ce malencontreux agent, dont le premier soin avait été de l'arrêter, au moment où il mettait le pied sur le sol du Royaume-Uni. En songeant à ses fautes, à ses imprudences, le pauvre garçon était pris d'irrésistibles remords. Il pleurait, il faisait peine à voir. Il voulait se briser la tête !","But then a thought came to Passepartout, this terrible thought that he was definitely the cause of all this misfortune! Indeed, why had he concealed this adventure from Mr. Fogg? When Fix had revealed both his status as a police inspector and the mission with which he was charged, why had he taken it upon himself not to inform his master? The latter, warned, would no doubt have given Fix proofs of his innocence; he would have shown him his error; in any case, he would not have conveyed at his expense and on his heels this unfortunate agent, whose first care had been to arrest him, the moment he set foot on the soil of the United Kingdom. Thinking of his faults, his imprudences, the poor fellow was seized with irresistible remorse. He was crying, it was painful to see. He wanted to break his head!","But then something occurred to Passepartout, the terrible thought that he was the cause of this whole disaster. Why on earth had he concealed the situation from Mr Fogg? When Fix had revealed that he was a police inspector and that his task was to arrest Mr Fogg, why had he taken it upon himself not to alert his master? If he had warned him, his master would certainly have given Fix proof of his innocence and would have shown him his error. In any case, he wouldn’t have dragged the wretched detective behind him all around the world and at his own expense when the man’s main concern was to arrest him the moment he set foot on British soil.1 When he thought about all his foolishness and carelessness, the poor fellow was overcome with remorse. He cried; he was a pathetic sight. He wanted to knock himself senseless.","The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of this new misfortune! Had he not concealed Fix’s errand from his master? When Fix revealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr. Fogg? If the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master, only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil. Passepartout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains out."
"Mr. Fogg répondit que l'honneur serait pour lui, et Fix — qui tenait à ne point le perdre de vue — lui demanda la permission de visiter avec lui cette curieuse ville de San Francisco. Ce qui fut accordé.","Mr. Fogg replied that the honor would be his, and Fix—who was anxious not to lose sight of him—asked him permission to visit the curious city of San Francisco with him. which was granted.","Mr Fogg replied that the honour was all his, and Fix, who was anxious not to let him out of his sight, asked permission to accompany him around this fascinating city of San Francisco. Permission was duly granted.",Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective - who was determined not to lose sight of him - begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco - a request which Mr. Fogg readily granted.
"Le Mongolia avait encore seize cent cinquante milles à faire avant d'atteindre Bombay, et il devait rester quatre heures à Steamer-Point, afin de remplir ses soutes.","The Mongolia still had sixteen hundred and fifty miles to go before reaching Bombay, and she was to remain four hours at Steamer Point, in order to fill her holds.","The Mongolia still had 1,650 miles to do before reaching Bombay and it would take four hours at Steamer Point for it to refill its coal bunkers.","The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up."
"— Oh ! pour cela, j'en suis sûr ! » s'écria Passepartout, riant de plus belle.","- Oh ! for that, I'm sure! exclaimed Passepartout, laughing even more.","‘Oh, I’m quite sure of that!’ exclaimed Passepartout, laughing even more.","“Oh, I am quite sure of that!” cried Passepartout, laughing heartily."

"Passepartout ignorait ceci : c'est que si le cadran de sa montre eût été divisé en vingt-quatre heures comme les horloges italiennes, il n'aurait eu aucun motif de triompher, car les aiguilles de son instrument, quand il était neuf heures du matin à bord, auraient indiqué neuf heures du soir, c'est-à-dire la vingt et unième heure depuis minuit, — différence précisément égale à celle qui existe entre Londres et le cent quatre-vingtième méridien.","Passepartout did not know this: if the dial of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours like the Italian clocks, he would have had no reason to triumph, for the hands of his instrument, when it was nine o'clock in the morning, morning on board, would have indicated nine o'clock in the evening, that is to say the twenty-first hour after midnight, a difference precisely equal to that which exists between London and the one hundred and eightieth meridian.","What Passepartout didn’t know was that if he’d had a watch with a twenty-four-hour face, like Italian watches, he would have had no reason to be so triumphant, because the hands on his instrument would have shown nine o’clock in the evening , that is the twenty-first hour since midnight, whereas the time on board was nine o’clock in the morning. This was exactly the same difference as that between London time and the 180th meridian.","Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then, instead of as now indicating nine o’clock in the morning, indicate nine o’clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian."

"Le 16 décembre, c'était le soixante quinzième jour écoulé depuis le départ de Londres. En somme, l'Henrietta n'avait pas encore un retard inquiétant. La moitié de la traversée était à peu près faite, et les plus mauvais parages avaient été franchis. En été, on eût répondu du succès. En hiver, on était à la merci de la mauvaise saison. Passepartout ne se prononçait pas. Au fond, il avait espoir, et, si le vent faisait défaut, du moins il comptait sur la vapeur.","December 16 was the seventy-fifth day since leaving London. In short, the Henrietta was not yet alarmingly late. Half of the crossing was nearly done, and the worst parts had been crossed. In summer, we would have answered success.

Deep down he was hopeful and, if the wind failed, he was counting on steam to get them there.","The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg’s departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed. Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst localities had been passed. In summer, success would have been well-nigh certain. In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad season. Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret, and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed them, they might still count on the steam."

"Passepartout, réveillé, regardait, et ne pouvait croire qu'il traversait le pays des Indous dans un train du « Great peninsular railway ». Cela lui paraissait invraisemblable. Et cependant rien de plus réel ! La locomotive, dirigée par le bras d'un mécanicien anglais et chauffée de houille anglaise, lançait sa fumée sur les plantations de caféiers, de muscadiers, de girofliers, de poivriers rouges. La vapeur se contournait en spirales autour des groupes de palmiers, entre lesquels apparaissaient de pittoresques bungalows, quelques viharis, sortes de monastères abandonnés, et des temples merveilleux qu'enrichissait l'inépuisable ornementation de l'architecture indienne. Puis, d'immenses étendues de terrain se dessinaient à perte de vue, des jungles où ne manquaient ni les serpents ni les tigres qu'épouvantaient les hennissements du train, et enfin des forêts, fendues par le tracé de la voie, encore hantées d'éléphants, qui, d'un œil pensif, regardaient passer le convoi échevelé.","Passepartout, awake, watched, and could not believe that he was crossing the country of the Hindus in a train of the Great Peninsular Railway. It seemed unbelievable to him. And yet nothing more real! The locomotive, steered by the arm of an English mechanic and heated with English coal, threw its smoke over the plantations of coffee trees, nutmeg trees, clove trees, red pepper trees. The steam twisted in spirals around groups of palm trees, between which appeared picturesque bungalows, a few viharis, sorts of abandoned monasteries, and marvelous temples enriched by the inexhaustible ornamentation of Indian architecture. Then, immense expanses of land stretched out as far as the eye could see, jungles where there was no shortage of snakes or tigers terrified by the neighing of the train, and finally forests, split by the layout of the track, still haunted by elephants, who, with a thoughtful eye, watched the disheveled convoy pass.","When he awoke, Passepartout saw to his amazement that he was crossing the Indian subcontinent in a train belonging to the Great Peninsular Railway. He couldn’t believe it. And yet it really was true. The locomotive, driven by an English engineman and fuelled by English coal, poured out its smoke over plantations of cotton, coffee, nutmeg, cloves and red pepper. The steam spiralled up over clumps of palm trees, between which could be seen picturesque bungalows, a few viharas or monasteries, now in ruins, and some wonderful temples decorated with the inexhaustible richness of detail of Indian architecture. Then there were huge expanses of land stretching as far as the eye could see, jungles teeming with snakes and tigers frightened by the rushing of the train, and finally forests that the route of the railway had sliced through but were still the haunt of elephants, which looked on thoughtfully as the convoy swept breathlessly by.","Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train. The locomotive, guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture. Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive eyes, gazed at the train as it passed."

"Passepartout partit aussitôt et courut les rues de la ville. Allahabad, c'est la cité de Dieu, l'une des plus vénérées de l'Inde, en raison de ce qu'elle est bâtie au confluent de deux fleuves sacrés, le Gange et la Jumna, dont les eaux attirent les pèlerins de toute la péninsule.

In addition, it is well known that, according to the legends of the Ramayana,1 the Ganges has its source in the heavens from where, thanks to Brahma, it comes down to this earth.","Passepartout started off forthwith, and found himself in the streets of Allahabad, that is, the City of God, one of the most venerated in India, being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers, Ganges and Jumna, the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula.

"Passepartout n'était point un de ces frontins ou mascarilles qui, les épaules hautes, le nez au vent, le regard assuré, l'œil sec, ne sont que d'impudents drôles. Non. Passepartout était un brave garçon, de physionomie aimable, aux lèvres un peu saillantes, toujours prêtes à goûter ou à caresser, un être doux et serviable, avec une de ces bonnes têtes rondes que l'on aime à voir sur les épaules d'un ami. Il avait les yeux bleus, le teint animé, la figure assez grasse pour qu'il pût lui-même voir les pommettes de ses joues, la poitrine large, la taille forte, une musculature vigoureuse, et il possédait une force herculéenne que les exercices de sa jeunesse avaient admirablement développée. Ses cheveux bruns étaient un peu rageurs. Si les sculpteurs de l'antiquité connaissaient dix-huit façons d'arranger la chevelure de Minerve, Passepartout n'en connaissait qu'une pour disposer la sienne : trois coups de démêloir, et il était coiffé.","Passepartout was not one of those frontins or mascarilles who, with their high shoulders, their noses in the wind, their eyes assured, their eyes dry, are nothing but impudent jokers. No. Passepartout was a good fellow, with an amiable countenance, slightly protruding lips, always ready to taste or caress, a gentle and helpful being, with one of those good round heads that one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend. He had blue eyes, a lively complexion, a face fat enough for him to see the cheekbones of his cheeks, a broad chest, a strong build, a vigorous musculature, and he possessed a Herculean strength that exercises of his youth had admirably developed. His brown hair was a little raging. If the sculptors of antiquity knew eighteen ways of arranging Minerva's hair, Passepartout knew only one to arrange his own: three strokes of the comb, and he had his hair done.","Passepartout was not one of those cheeky or scheming servants who strut about, trying to be clever and cocky. On the contrary he was a good chap with a friendly face and prominent lips that were made for eating, drinking and kissing. He was a kind and helpful soul, with just the type of roundish head that you’d like to see on a friend’s shoulders. He had blue eyes, a bright complexion, a plump face and puffy cheeks, a broad chest, a thick waist, powerful muscles and an immense strength, further developed by plenty of exercise during his youth. His brown hair was rather unruly. If the sculptors of antiquity knew eighteen different ways of arranging Minerva’s tresses,3 Passepartout knew only one way of doing his hair: dragging a comb through it three times.","Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend. His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva’s tresses, Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet."

Sa fortune ne se composait plus que des vingt mille livres déposées chez Baring frères, et ces vingt mille livres, il les devait à ses collègues du Reform-Club. Après tant de dépenses faites, ce pari gagné ne l'eût pas enrichi sans doute, et il est probable qu'il n'avait pas cherché à s'enrichir — étant de ces hommes qui parient pour l'honneur —, mais ce pari perdu le ruinait totalement. Au surplus, le parti du gentleman était pris. Il savait ce qui lui restait à faire.","This gentleman had received the blow which struck him with his usual impassivity. Ruin ! and through the fault of this clumsy police inspector! After walking with a sure step during this long journey, after having overthrown a thousand obstacles, braved a thousand dangers, having still found time to do some good on his way, failing in port before a brutal event which he could not have foreseen , and against which he was disarmed: it was terrible! Of the considerable sum he had taken with him at the start, there remained only an insignificant remainder. His fortune now consisted of only the twenty thousand pounds deposited with Baring brothers, and these twenty thousand pounds he owed to his colleagues at the Reform Club. After so much spending, this bet won would doubtless not have enriched him, and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself — being one of those men who bet for honor — but this bet lost totally ruined him. Moreover, the gentleman's side was taken. He knew what he had to do.","The gentleman had responded to this blow with his usual impassiveness. He was ruined and it was all the fault of this bungling police inspector. After travelling at a steady pace during this long journey, after overcoming a thousand obstacles, braving a thousand dangers and finding the time to do some good on the way, to fail at his port of arrival in such violent circumstances, which he could not have foreseen and was powerless to combat, was a terrible thing. Of the sizeable sum of money he had taken with him when he set out, only an insignificant amount was left over. All that remained of his fortune was the £20,000 deposited with Baring Brothers, and even those £20,000 were what he owed to his colleagues from the Reform Club. After spending so much money, even if he had won his bet he probably wouldn’t have been very much richer – anyway, that probably hadn’t been his aim, since he was the sort of man who bet for honour not gain – but losing his bet spelt his financial ruin. In any case the gentleman had made up his mind. He knew what was left for him to do.","He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity. Ruined! And by the blundering of the detective! After having steadily traversed that long journey, overcome a hundred obstacles, braved many dangers, and still found time to do some good on his way, to fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseen, and against which he was unarmed; it was terrible! But a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him. There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at Barings, and this amount he owed to his friends of the Reform Club. So great had been the expense of his tour that, even had he won, it would not have enriched him; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself, being a man who rather laid wagers for honour’s sake than for the stake proposed. But this wager totally ruined him. Mr. Fogg’s course, however, was fully decided upon; he knew what remained for him to do."

Le brave garçon, tantôt lancé sur le cou de l'éléphant, tantôt rejeté sur la croupe, faisait de la voltige, comme un clown sur un tremplin. Mais il plaisantait, il riait au milieu de ses sauts de carpe, et, de temps en temps, il tirait de son sac un morceau de sucre, que l'intelligent Kiouni prenait du bout de sa trompe, sans interrompre un instant son trot régulier.","As for Passepartout, posted on the animal's back and directly subjected to blows and backlashes, he was careful, on his master's recommendation, not to hold his tongue between his teeth, for it would have been cut off.

The dear fellow was sometimes hurled forward on to the elephant’s neck and at other times thrown backward on to its rump, as if he was doing acrobatics like a clown on a trampoline. But he was joking and laughing while leaping up in the air, and from time to time he pulled out of his bag a lump of sugar, which the clever Kiouni took with the end of his trunk, without for a moment breaking his steady trot.","As for Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast’s back, and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along, he was very careful, in accordance with his master’s advice, to keep his tongue from between his teeth, as it would otherwise have been bitten off short. The worthy fellow bounced from the elephant’s neck to his rump, and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing, and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket, and inserted it in Kiouni’s trunk, who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot."

"Le visage de Passepartout se rembrunit en même temps que le ciel, et, pendant deux jours, l'honnête garçon éprouva de mortelles transes. Mais Phileas Fogg était un marin hardi, qui savait tenir tête à la mer, et il fit toujours route, même sans se mettre sous petite vapeur. L'Henrietta, quand elle ne pouvait s'élever à la lame, passait au travers, et son pont était balayé en grand, mais elle passait.

"Dans cette portion du territoire qui s'étend entre San Francisco et Sacramento, le sol est peu accidenté. Cette partie du chemin de fer, sous le nom de « Central Pacific road », prit d'abord Sacramento pour point de départ, et s'avança vers l'est à la rencontre de celui qui partait d'Omaha. De San Francisco à la capitale de la Californie, la ligne courait directement au nord-est, en longeant American-river, qui se jette dans la baie de San Pablo. Les cent vingt milles compris entre ces deux importantes cités furent franchis en six heures, et vers minuit, pendant qu'ils dormaient de leur premier sommeil, les voyageurs passèrent à Sacramento. Ils ne virent donc rien de cette ville considérable, siège de la législature de l'État de Californie, ni ses beaux quais, ni ses rues larges, ni ses hôtels splendides, ni ses squares, ni ses temples.","In this portion of the territory which extends between San Francisco and Sacramento, the ground is not very uneven. This part of the railroad, under the name of the ""Central Pacific road"", took at first Sacramento as a point of departure, and advanced towards the east to meet that which started from Omaha.

The hundred and twenty miles comprised between these two important cities were crossed in six hours, and towards midnight, while they slept their first sleep, the travelers passed through Sacramento. They therefore saw nothing of this considerable city, seat of the legislature of the State of California, neither its beautiful quays, nor its broad streets, nor its splendid hotels, nor its squares, nor its temples.","In this part of the country between San Francisco and Sacramento the land is fairly flat. This section of the line, called the Central Pacific Railroad, first took Sacramento as its startingpoint and then went east to meet up with the line coming from Omaha.

"Fix, lui, ne voyait pas ces choses du même œil. Bien au contraire. Cette tempête lui plaisait. Sa satisfaction aurait même été sans bornes, si le Rangoon eût été obligé de fuir devant la tourmente. Tous ces retards lui allaient, car ils obligeraient le sieur Fogg à rester quelques jours à Hong-Kong. Enfin, le ciel, avec ses rafales et ses bourrasques, entrait dans son jeu. Il était bien un peu malade, mais qu'importe ! Il ne comptait pas ses nausées, et, quand son corps se tordait sous le mal de mer, son esprit s'ébaudissait d'une immense satisfaction.","Fix didn't see these things the same way. Quite the contrary. This storm pleased him. His satisfaction would even have been boundless, if the Rangoon had been obliged to flee before the storm. All these delays suited him, for they would oblige Mr. Fogg to stay a few days in Hong Kong. Finally, the sky, with its gusts and squalls, came into its game. It was a little ill, but who cares! He did not count his nausea, and when his body writhed with seasickness, his mind was filled with immense satisfaction.","Fix didn’t see things in the same light. Far from it. This storm was exactly what he wanted. His satisfaction would have known no bounds if the Rangoon had been forced to run before the storm. Any delay like this suited him because it would force this man Fogg to spend a few days in Hong Kong. At last the weather, in the form of gusts and gales, was on his side. Admittedly he wasn’t well, but what did that matter! He lost count of the number of times he’d been sick, but when his body was writhing from the effects of seasickness his mind was revelling in an immense sense of satisfaction.","Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light. The storm greatly pleased him. His satisfaction would have been complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves. Each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies, with the gusts and squalls. It mattered not that they made him sea-sick - he made no account of this inconvenience; and, whilst his body was writhing under their effects, his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation."
"Depuis cette rencontre, Passepartout et Fix causèrent souvent ensemble. L'inspecteur de police tenait à se lier avec le domestique du sieur Fogg. Cela pouvait le servir à l'occasion. Il lui offrait donc souvent, au bar-room du Mongolia, quelques verres de whisky ou de pale-ale, que le brave garçon acceptait sans cérémonie et rendait même pour ne pas être en reste, — trouvant, d'ailleurs, ce Fix un gentleman bien honnête.","Since that meeting, Passepartout and Fix often talked together. The police inspector wanted to make friends with Mr. Fogg's servant. It could come in handy on occasion. So he often offered him, in the bar-room of the Mongolia, a few glasses of whiskey or pale ale, which the worthy fellow accepted without ceremony and even returned so as not to be outdone—finding, moreover, this Fix a very honest gentleman.","After this meeting Passepartout and Fix often chatted together. The police inspector wanted to get to know the servant of this man Fogg. He might be of use to him at some point. So in the bar of the Mongolia he often offered to buy him a few glasses of whisky or pale ale, and the dear fellow accepted them without protest and even returned the compliment, not to feel indebted to him. He thought that this Fix was after all a decent sort of chap.","After this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting together, the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man’s confidence.

"Le lendemain, Passepartout, éreinté, affamé, se dit qu'il fallait manger à tout prix, et que le plus tôt serait le mieux.

It followed the right bank of Platte-river throughout its course. The sleigh, shortening this route, took the bowstring described by the railway. Mudge could not fear being stopped by the Platte-river, at that little bend which it makes in front of Fremont, since its waters were frozen. The path was therefore entirely cleared of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had therefore only two circumstances to fear: damage to the apparatus, a change or a drop in the wind.","The prairie, which the sledge was directly cutting across, was as flat as the sea.

It followed the right bank of the Platte River for the whole of the way. The sledge took a shorter route, going in a straight line instead of following the curve chosen by the railroad. There was no need for Mudge to fear being stopped by the Platte River at the small bend it makes before Fremont because its waters were frozen over. The way was therefore completely free of obstacles and so there were only two things for Phileas Fogg to be afraid of: damage to the craft and a change of direction or drop in the wind.","The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was as flat as a sea.

And that's why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy, why the captain was locked in his cabin, and why the Henrietta was heading for Liverpool. Only, it was very clear, to see Mr. Fogg maneuvering, that Mr. Fogg had been a sailor.","What had happened was perfectly simple. Phileas Fogg wanted to get to Liverpool, but the captain didn’t want to take him there. Phileas Fogg had then agreed to travel to Bordeaux and during the thirty hours he’d been on board he had put his banknotes to work so effectively that the crew, the sailors and the stokers – a motley collection of individuals who were on pretty bad terms with the captain – had been won over. This is why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy, why the captain was locked up in his cabin and, lastly, why the Henrietta was heading for Liverpool. It was, though, very clear from the way he set about things that Mr Fogg had been a sailor.","What had happened was very simple. Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there. Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body. This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta was directing her course towards Liverpool. It was very clear, to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor."
"« Je crois prudent de nous retirer, dit Fix, qui ne tenait pas à ce que « son homme » reçût un mauvais coup ou se fît une mauvaise affaire. S'il est question de l'Angleterre dans tout ceci et qu'on nous reconnaisse, nous serons fort compromis dans la bagarre !","'I think it prudent to retire,' said Fix, who did not want 'his man' to take a bad beating or get himself a bad deal. If England is involved in all this and we are recognized, we will be very compromised in the fight!","‘I think it would be wise to withdraw,’ said Fix, who certainly didn’t want his man to be hurt or to get into trouble. ‘If this has got anything to do with Britain and they recognize us, then we are bound to get caught up in the brawl.’","“It would be prudent for us to retire,” said Fix, who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to London. “If there is any question about England in all this, and we were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us.”"

"Donc, par le mauvais temps, il convenait de prendre de grandes précautions. Il fallait quelquefois mettre à la cape sous petite vapeur. C'était une perte de temps qui ne paraissait affecter Phileas Fogg en aucune façon, mais dont Passepartout se montrait extrêmement irrité. Il accusait alors le capitaine, le mécanicien, la Compagnie, et envoyait au diable tous ceux qui se mêlent de transporter des voyageurs. Peut-être aussi la pensée de ce bec de gaz qui continuait de brûler à son compte dans la maison de Saville-row entrait-elle pour beaucoup dans son impatience.","So, in bad weather, great precautions had to be taken. It was sometimes necessary to put the cape under light steam. It was a waste of time which did not seem to affect Phileas Fogg in any way, but which Passepartout was extremely irritated with.

Perhaps also the thought of that gaslight which continued to burn on its own account in the house at Saville-row had much to do with its impatience.","Thus, when the weather was bad, extreme caution was needed. It was sometimes necessary to heave to at low steam. The resulting loss of time did not seem to affect Phileas Fogg in the least, but Passepartout got extremely annoyed. At such times he blamed the captain, the chief engineer and the Company, and he cursed all those involved in transporting passengers. Perhaps, too, the thought of the gas bill he would have to pay back in Savile Row had something to do with his impatience.","Owing to the defective construction of the Rangoon, however, unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least. Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows. Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly burning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot impatience."

"Que faisait pendant cette traversée l'inspecteur Fix, si malencontreusement entraîné dans un voyage de circumnavigation ? Au départ de Calcutta, après avoir laissé des instructions pour que le mandat, s'il arrivait enfin, lui fût adressé à Hong-Kong, il avait pu s'embarquer à bord du Rangoon sans avoir été aperçu de Passepartout, et il espérait bien dissimuler sa présence jusqu'à l'arrivée du paquebot. En effet, il lui eût été difficile d'expliquer pourquoi il se trouvait à bord, sans éveiller les soupçons de Passepartout, qui devait le croire à Bombay.

On leaving Calcutta, after having left instructions so that the money order, if it finally arrived, would be sent to him in Hong-Kong, he had been able to embark on board the Rangoon without having been seen from Passepartout, and he hoped conceal his presence until the liner arrives. In fact, it would have been difficult for him to explain why he was on board without arousing the suspicions of Passepartout, who must have believed him in Bombay.

It would indeed have been difficult for him to explain his presence on board without arousing Passepartout’s suspicions, since the latter must have thought he was in Bombay. But, as it turned out, he was destined to meet up with the dear fellow once again in circumstances that will soon be explained.","What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country, doing all this while?

Few animals were observed on the route; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout with laughter."
"Pendant la nuit suivante, le Mongolia franchit le détroit de Bab-el-Mandeb, dont le nom arabe signifie la Porte des Larmes, et le lendemain, 14, il faisait escale à Steamer-Point, au nord-ouest de la rade d'Aden.

This was where it was due to take on more fuel.","The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic The Bridge of Tears, and the next day they put in at Steamer Point, north-west of Aden harbour, to take in coal.

"La maison de Saville-row, sans être somptueuse, se recommandait par un extrême confort. D'ailleurs, avec les habitudes invariables du locataire, le service s'y réduisait à peu. Toutefois, Phileas Fogg exigeait de son unique domestique une ponctualité, une régularité extraordinaires. Ce jour-là même, 2 octobre, Phileas Fogg avait donné son congé à James Forster, — ce garçon s'étant rendu coupable de lui avoir apporté pour sa barbe de l'eau à quatre-vingt-quatre degrés Fahrenheit au lieu de quatre-vingt-six, — et il attendait son successeur, qui devait se présenter entre onze heures et onze heures et demie.","The Saville-row house, without being sumptuous, was recommended by its extreme comfort. Besides, with the invariable habits of the tenant, the service there was reduced to little. However, Phileas Fogg demanded extraordinary punctuality and regularity from his only servant.

In any case, because the habits of its occupant never varied, serving him was a simple matter. However, Phileas Fogg required his only servant to be extremely punctual and reliable. On that particular day, 2 October, Phileas Fogg had dismissed James Forster, as the fellow had committed the crime of bringing him his water for shaving at a temperature of eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit, instead of eighty-six, and he was waiting for his replacement, who was due to arrive between eleven o’clock and half past eleven.","The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly comfortable. The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular. On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house between eleven and half-past."

"De dire si le caractère expansif de ce garçon s'accorderait avec celui de Phileas Fogg, c'est ce que la prudence la plus élémentaire ne permet pas. Passepartout serait-il ce domestique foncièrement exact qu'il fallait à son maître ? On ne le verrait qu'à l'user. Après avoir eu, on le sait, une jeunesse assez vagabonde, il aspirait au repos. Ayant entendu vanter le méthodisme anglais et la froideur proverbiale des gentlemen, il vint chercher fortune en Angleterre. Mais, jusqu'alors, le sort l'avait mal servi. Il n'avait pu prendre racine nulle part. Il avait fait dix maisons. Dans toutes, on était fantasque, inégal, coureur d' aventures ou coureur de pays, — ce qui ne pouvait plus convenir à Passepartout. Son dernier maître, le jeune lord Longsferry, membre du parlement, après avoir passé ses nuits dans les « oysters-rooms » d'Hay-Market, rentrait trop souvent au logis sur les épaules des policemen. Passepartout, voulant avant tout pouvoir respecter son maître, risqua quelques respectueuses observations qui furent mal reçues, et il rompit. Il apprit, sur les entrefaites, que Phileas Fogg, esq., cherchait un domestique. Il prit des renseignements sur ce gentleman. Un personnage dont l'existence était si régulière, qui ne découchait pas, qui ne voyageait pas, qui ne s'absentait jamais, pas même un jour, ne pouvait que lui convenir. Il se présenta et fut admis dans les circonstances que l'on sait.","To say whether the expansive character of this boy would agree with that of Phileas Fogg, is what the most elementary prudence does not permit. Could Passepartout be the fundamentally exact servant his master needed? We would only see it by using it. After having had, as we know, a rather wandering youth, he longed for rest. Having heard the praises of English Methodism and the proverbial coldness of gentlemen, he came to seek his fortune in England. But, until then, fate had served him badly. He couldn't take root anywhere. He had made ten houses. In all of them, one was fantastic, unequal, adventure seeker or country runner—which could no longer suit Passepartout. Its last master, the young Lord Longsferry, a Member of Parliament, after spending his nights in the oyster-rooms of Hay Market, too often returned home on the shoulders of the policemen. Passepartout, wanting above all to be able to respect his master, ventured a few respectful observations which were badly received, and he broke off. He learned meanwhile that Phileas Fogg, esq., was looking for a servant. He inquired about this gentleman. A character whose existence was so regular, who never slept, who never travelled, who never went away, not even a day, could only suit him. He presented himself and was admitted under the circumstances which we know.","Whether someone of his extrovert nature would get on with a person like Phileas Fogg was too early to say. Would Passepartout be the sort of servant, precise as clockwork, that his master needed? Only time would tell. After having had an adventurous youth, as has been seen, all he wanted was a quiet life. Having heard people sing the praises of the methodical nature4 of the English and the proverbial coldness of their gentlemen, he had come to England in search of fortune. But so far luck had not been on his side. He had not been able to settle down anywhere. He had worked in ten different households. In every one the people had been temperamental or unpredictable, eager to seek out adventure or explore other countries, something that no longer suited Passepartout. His most recent master, the young Lord Longsferry, a Member of Parliament, regularly needed to be helped back home by policemen after his late nights out on the town. Since what Passepartout wanted most was a master he could look up to, he ventured some polite observations, but they were not appreciated and so he left. He discovered in the meanwhile that Phileas Fogg, Esq., was looking for a servant. He made some enquiries about this gentleman. Someone whose daily life was so well ordered, someone who never spent the night away from home and didn’t travel or even go away for a day, was bound to suit him. He went along to his house and was taken on in the circumstances already outlined.","It would be rash to predict how Passepartout’s lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required; experience alone could solve the question. Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so far he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten English houses. But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure. His last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the morning on policemen’s shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after. He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen."

At one point, a man had approached, even spoken to him, but the agent had sent him away, after responding to his words with a negative sign.","Fix still remained motionless in the same place, but he, too, was unable to sleep. At one point someone went up to him and even said something to him, but the detective sent him away, after replying to him with a shake of the head.","Fix remained stationary in the same place, but did not sleep.

"Personne ne se hasarda à contredire le missionnaire, dont l'exaltation contrastait avec sa physionomie naturellement calme. Mais, sans doute, sa colère s'expliquait par ce fait que le mormonisme était actuellement soumis à de dures épreuves.

Il s'était rendu maître de l'Utah, et l'avait soumis aux lois de l'Union, après avoir emprisonné Brigham Young, accusé de rébellion et de polygamie. Depuis cette époque, les disciples du prophète redoublaient leurs efforts, et, en attendant les actes, ils résistaient par la parole aux prétentions du Congrès.","No one ventured to contradict the missionary, whose exaltation contrasted with his naturally calm countenance. But, doubtless, his anger was explained by the fact that Mormonism was at present subjected to severe trials.

He had made himself master of Utah, and had subjected it to the laws of the Union, after having imprisoned Brigham Young, accused of rebellion and polygamy. Since that time, the disciples of the prophet redoubled their efforts, and, while awaiting deeds, they resisted by word of mouth the pretensions of the Congress.","No one had the temerity to contradict the missionary, whose state of excitement was in sharp contrast to the naturally calm expression on his face. But his anger was in all probability due to the fact that the Mormons were at present suffering trials and tribulations, since the government of the United States had only recently, and with considerable difficulty overcome these fanatics for independence. It had taken control of Utah and had made it subject to federal law after imprisoning Brigham Young for insurrection and polygamy. Since then, the prophet’s disciples had become even more active and, before resorting to more extreme measures, were using the spoken word to oppose the demands of Congress.","No one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tone contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage. No doubt his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually subjected. The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule.

Also, in Passepartout's story of his adventures, he only accused and excused himself of having been surprised by opium intoxication in a Yokohama tobacconist.","At the mention of the name Fix, Passepartout didn’t bat an eyelid. He thought the moment had not yet come for him to tell his master what had transpired between the detective and himself. And so, in the version Passepartout gave of his adventures, he put all the blame on himself for having been overcome by the effects of opium in a smoking den in Hong Kong,1 for which he apologized.","Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name. He thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what had taken place between the detective and himself; and, in the account he gave of his absence, he simply excused himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness, in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong."
"Or, précisément, ainsi que le disait le Morning-Chronicle, on avait lieu de supposer que l'auteur du vol ne faisait partie d'aucune des sociétés de voleurs d'Angleterre. Pendant cette journée du 29 septembre, un gentleman bien mis, de bonnes manières, l'air distingué, avait été remarqué, qui allait et venait dans la salle des payements, théâtre du vol. L'enquête avait permis de refaire assez exactement le signalement de ce gentleman, signalement qui fut aussitôt adressé à tous les détectives du Royaume-Uni et du continent. Quelques bons esprits — et Gauthier Ralph était du nombre — se croyaient donc fondés à espérer que le voleur n'échapperait pas.","Now, precisely, as the Morning Chronicle said, there was reason to suppose that the author of the theft was not a member of any of the societies of thieves in England. During the day of September 29, a well-dressed, well-mannered, distinguished-looking gentleman had been noticed walking back and forth in the payment room, the scene of the theft. The investigation had made it possible to redo quite exactly the description of this gentleman, description which was immediately sent to all the detectives of the United Kingdom and the continent. A few good minds—and Gauthier Ralph was among them—believed themselves justified in hoping that the thief would not escape.","As it happened, just as the Morning Chronicle claimed, there was reason to believe that the person responsible for the theft was not a member of the criminal fraternity. During that day of 29 September, a well-dressed, well-mannered and distinguished-looking gentleman had been noticed pacing around in the cash room, the scene of the crime. The investigation had made it possible to put together quite an accurate description of the gentleman and it had then been sent immediately to every detective in the United Kingdom and on the continent. Some wise souls – and Gauthier Ralph was one of them – therefore felt justified in thinking that the thief would not get away.","There were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said, that the thief did not belong to a professional band. On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed. A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension."

"Pendant cette matinée, au-delà de la station de Malligaum, les voyageurs traversèrent ce territoire funeste, qui fut si souvent ensanglanté par les sectateurs de la déesse Kâli. Non loin s'élevaient Ellora et ses pagodes admirables, non loin la célèbre Aurungabad, la capitale du farouche Aureng-Zeb, maintenant simple chef-lieu de l'une des provinces détachées du royaume du Nizam. C'était sur cette contrée que Feringhea, le chef des Thugs, le roi des Étrangleurs, exerçait sa domination. Ces assassins, unis dans une association insaisissable, étranglaient, en l'honneur de la déesse de la Mort, des victimes de tout âge, sans jamais verser de sang, et il fut un temps où l'on ne pouvait fouiller un endroit quelconque de ce sol sans y trouver un cadavre. Le gouvernement anglais a bien pu empêcher ces meurtres dans une notable proportion, mais l'épouvantable association existe toujours et fonctionne encore.","During this morning, beyond the station of Malligaum, the travelers crossed this fatal territory, which was so often bloodied by the followers of the goddess Kali. Not far away rose Ellora and its admirable pagodas, not far away the famous Aurungabad, the capital of the fierce Aureng-Zeb, now the simple chief town of one of the provinces detached from the kingdom of the Nizam. It was over this country that Feringhea, the chief of the Thugs, the king of the Stranglers, exercised his domination. These assassins, united in an elusive association, strangled, in honor of the goddess of Death, victims of all ages, without ever shedding blood, and there was a time when one could not search any place of this ground without finding a corpse there. The English government may well have prevented these murders to a considerable extent, but the dreadful association still exists and still functions.","That morning, beyond the station at Malegaon, the travellers went through the forbidding area that was so often the scene of bloody crimes committed by the votaries of the goddess Kali. Not far away they could see Ellora and its wonderful temples and also the famous city of Aurungabad, once the fearsome Aurungzeb’s capital city3 but now merely an administrative town in one of the isolated provinces of the Nizam of Hyderabad’s dominions. This was the area that used to be controlled by Feringheea, the chief of the Thugs, the king of the Stranglers.4 These assassins, who had banded together in an organization that lay beyond the reach of the law, strangled their victims, whatever their age, in honour of the goddess of death without ever shedding blood, and there was a time when it was impossible to dig below the surface of the soil without finding a dead body. The British government has, it is true, succeeded in reducing the number of murders, but this terrifying organization still exists and continues to operate.","The travellers crossed, beyond Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam. It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These ruffians, united by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction. The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites."
"Treize cents milles environ séparent Singapore de l'île de Hong-Kong, petit territoire anglais détaché de la côte chinoise.

"En effet, Hong-Kong était encore une terre anglaise, mais la dernière qui se rencontrât sur le parcours. Au-delà, la Chine, le Japon, l'Amérique offraient un refuge à peu près assuré au sieur Fogg. À Hong-Kong, s'il y trouvait enfin le mandat d'arrestation qui courait évidemment après lui, Fix arrêtait Fogg et le remettait entre les mains de la police locale. Nulle difficulté. Mais après Hong-Kong, un simple mandat d'arrestation ne suffirait plus. Il faudrait un acte d'extradition. De là retards, lenteurs, obstacles de toute nature, dont le coquin profiterait pour échapper définitivement. Si l'opération manquait à Hong-Kong, il serait, sinon impossible, du moins bien difficile, de la reprendre avec quelque chance de succès.","Indeed, Hong Kong was still English land, but the last to meet on the course. Beyond that, China, Japan, and America offered an almost certain refuge to Mr. Fogg. In Hong Kong, if he finally found the warrant for his arrest, which obviously was after him, Fix would arrest Fogg and hand him over to the local police. No difficulty. But after Hong Kong, a simple arrest warrant would no longer suffice. It would take an act of extradition. Hence delays, delays, obstacles of every kind, which the rascal would take advantage of to escape definitively. If the operation failed in Hong-Kong, it would be, if not impossible, at least very difficult, to resume it with any chance of success.","Hong Kong was, it must be remembered, another British possession, but it was the last one on the journey. After that, China, Japan and America offered a more or less safe haven to this man Fogg. In Hong Kong, if he finally got hold of the arrest warrant that must surely be on its way, Fix could arrest Fogg and hand him over to the local police. There was no problem about that. But after Hong Kong a straightforward arrest warrant would no longer be enough. Extradition papers would be needed. That would lead to further delay, lengthy procedures and obstacles of all sorts, which the scoundrel would take advantage of to get away once and for all. If the operation failed in Hong Kong, it would be, if not downright impossible, at least very difficult to repeat it with any real chance of success.","Hong Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan, America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge. If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no further trouble. But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result in delays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice."
"Sir Francis Cromarty était furieux. Passepartout eût volontiers assommé le conducteur, qui n'en pouvait mais. Il n'osait regarder son maître.","Sir Francis Cromarty was furious. Passepartout would have gladly knocked out the driver, who couldn't help it. He dared not look at his master.","Sir Francis Cromarty was furious. Passepartout would have cheerfully assaulted the guard, though it really wasn’t his fault. He didn’t dare look at his master.","Sir Francis was furious. Passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor down, and did not dare to look at his master."
"Puis Passepartout se trouva dans les champs, au milieu des immenses rizières. Là s'épanouissaient, avec des fleurs qui jetaient leurs dernières couleurs et leurs derniers parfums, des camélias éclatants, portés non plus sur des arbrisseaux, mais sur des arbres, et, dans les enclos de bambous, des cerisiers, des pruniers, des pommiers, que les indigènes cultivent plutôt pour leurs fleurs que pour leurs fruits, et que des mannequins grimaçants, des tourniquets criards défendent contre le bec des moineaux, des pigeons, des corbeaux et autres volatiles voraces. Pas de cèdre majestueux qui n'abritât quelque grand aigle ; pas de saule pleureur qui ne recouvrît de son feuillage quelque héron mélancoliquement perché sur une patte ; enfin, partout des corneilles, des canards, des éperviers, des oies sauvages, et grand nombre de ces grues que les Japonais traitent de « Seigneuries », et qui symbolisent pour eux la longévité et le bonheur.","Then Passepartout found himself in the fields, in the middle of immense rice paddies. There bloomed, with flowers that shed their last colors and their last perfumes, dazzling camellias, carried no longer on shrubs, but on trees, and, in the enclosures of bamboo, cherry trees, plum trees, apple trees. , which the natives cultivate rather for their flowers than for their fruits, and which grimacing mannequins, screaming turnstiles defend against the beaks of sparrows, pigeons, crows and other voracious fowls. No majestic cedar that did not shelter some great eagle; no weeping willow that did not cover with its foliage some heron perched melancholy on one leg; finally, everywhere crows, ducks, sparrowhawks, wild geese, and a large number of those cranes which the Japanese call ""lordships"" and which symbolize for them longevity and happiness.","Then Passepartout found himself in the countryside, surrounded by immense rice fields. Here camellias the size not of shrubs but trees provided a brilliant display with flowers that showed their fading colours and exuded fading fragrances, and inside bamboo enclosures were cherry trees, plum trees and apple trees, which the inhabitants grow more for their blossom than their fruit and which are protected by fierce-looking scarecrows and noisy whirligigs from the beaks of sparrows, pigeons, crows and other ravenous birds. There was not a single majestic cedar without its great eagle, not a single weeping willow without a heron sheltering in its foliage, balancing melancholically on one leg. Finally there were everywhere rooks, ducks, sparrow-hawks, wild geese and a large number of the type of crane the Japanese call ‘lordships’, which are for them symbols of longevity and happiness.","He went on till he found himself in the fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations. There he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds. On the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes, which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity."
"Passepartout mit le pied, sans aucun enthousiasme, sur cette terre si curieuse des Fils du Soleil. Il n'avait rien de mieux à faire que de prendre le hasard pour guide, et d'aller à l'aventure par les rues de la ville.","Passepartout set foot, without any enthusiasm, on this curious land of the Sons of the Sun.

"Ce point est une relâche importante du Pacifique, où font escale tous les steamers employés au service de la poste et des voyageurs entre l'Amérique du Nord, la Chine, le Japon et les îles de la Malaisie.

"Quant à ce que pensait alors l'inspecteur de police ce serait difficile à dire.

"Mr. Fogg et ses compagnons ne trouvèrent pas la cité fort peuplée. Les rues étaient presque désertes, — sauf toutefois la partie du Temple, qu'ils n'atteignirent qu'après avoir traversé plusieurs quartiers entourés de palissades. Les femmes étaient assez nombreuses, ce qui s'explique par la composition singulière des ménages mormons. Il ne faut pas croire, cependant, que tous les Mormons soient polygames. On est libre, mais il est bon de remarquer que ce sont les citoyennes de l'Utah qui tiennent surtout à être épousées, car, suivant la religion du pays, le ciel mormon n'admet point à la possession de ses béatitudes les célibataires du sexe féminin. Ces pauvres créatures ne paraissaient ni aisées ni heureuses. Quelques-unes, les plus riches sans doute, portaient une jaquette de soie noire ouverte à la taille, sous une capuche ou un châle fort modeste. Les autres n'étaient vêtues que d'indienne.","Mr. Fogg and his companions did not find the city heavily populated. The streets were almost deserted—except, however, the part of the Temple, which they reached only after having passed through several districts surrounded by palisades. The women were quite numerous, which is explained by the singular composition of Mormon households. It should not be assumed, however, that all Mormons are polygamous. We are free, but it is good to note that it is the citizens of Utah who especially want to be married, because, according to the religion of the country, the Mormon heaven does not admit to the possession of its beatitudes the celibates of female sex. These poor creatures didn't seem easy or happy. Some, the wealthiest no doubt, wore a black silk jacket open at the waist, under a very modest hood or shawl. The others were dressed only in calico.","Mr Fogg and his companions didn’t find many people about in the town. The streets were almost deserted, with the notable exception of the part near the Temple, which they reached after going through several areas that were surrounded by high fences. There were quite a large number of women, which is due to the unusual nature of the Mormon household. It should not be thought, however, that all Mormons are polygamous. It is a question of individual choice, but it should be noted that it is primarily the women in Utah who wish to get married, because according to the local religion the Mormon heaven does not allow unmarried members of the female sex to enjoy the blessings it provides. These poor creatures seemed neither wealthy nor happy. Some of them, doubtless the wealthiest, wore black silk jackets open at the waist, beneath a hood or a very simple shawl. The others were dressed only in cotton prints.","The place did not seem thickly populated. The streets were almost deserted, except in the vicinity of the temple, which they only reached after having traversed several quarters surrounded by palisades. There were many women, which was easily accounted for by the “peculiar institution” of the Mormons; but it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists. They are free to marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as, according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys. These poor creatures seemed to be neither well off nor happy. Some - the more well-to-do, no doubt - wore short, open, black silk dresses, under a hood or modest shawl; others were habited in Indian fashion."

"Passepartout avait même éprouvé une forte envie de serrer la main de son allié Fix.

"Pendant toute la journée, l'embarcation courut ainsi vers le nord, emportée par les lames monstrueuses, en conservant heureusement une rapidité égale à la leur. Vingt fois elle faillit être coiffée par une de ces montagnes d'eau qui se dressaient à l'arrière ; mais un adroit coup de barre, donné par le pilote, parait la catastrophe. Les passagers étaient quelquefois couverts en grand par les embruns qu'ils recevaient philosophiquement. Fix maugréait sans doute, mais l'intrépide Aouda, les yeux fixés sur son compagnon, dont elle ne pouvait qu'admirer le sang-froid, se montrait digne de lui et bravait la tourmente à ses côtés. Quant à Phileas Fogg, il semblait que ce typhon fût partie de son programme.","Throughout the day, the boat thus ran towards the north, carried away by the monstrous waves, fortunately maintaining a speed equal to theirs. Twenty times she almost had her hair covered by one of those mountains of water that rose behind her; but a skilful turn of the helm, given by the pilot, appeared the catastrophe. The passengers were sometimes covered in greatness by the spray which they philosophically received. Fix grumbled no doubt, but the intrepid Aouda, his eyes fixed on his companion, whose composure she could only admire, proved worthy of him and braved the storm at his side. As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed that this typhoon was part of his program.","So, for the whole of that day, the vessel headed north, swept along by the monstrous waves but fortunately going at the same speed as them. Many times it was almost engulfed by one of these mountains of water that reared up behind it, but the captain’s deft touch at the helm prevented disaster. The passengers were sometimes soaked by spray but reacted stoically. Fix was grumbling away, it was true, but the intrepid Mrs Aouda kept her eyes firmly fixed on her companion, whose composure she couldn’t help admiring, and proved herself worthy of him as she stood by his side to face the storm. As for Phileas Fogg himself, he made it look as if the typhoon had been part of his plan.","The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to theirs. Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her. The passengers were often bathed in spray, but they submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed it, no doubt; but Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm. As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme."
"Passepartout, qui avait suivi avec émotion les incidents de cette gymnastique, vint contempler ce retardataire, auquel il s'intéressa vivement, quand il apprit que ce citoyen de l'Utah n'avait ainsi pris la fuite qu'à la suite d'une scène de ménage.","Passepartout, who had followed the incidents of this gymnastics with emotion, came to contemplate this latecomer, in whom he took a keen interest, when he learned that this citizen of Utah had thus fled only following a domestic scene.","Passepartout, who had been watching this acrobatic performance with considerable excitement, went up to have a look at this latecomer and became particularly interested in him when he learnt that this citizen of Utah had only taken flight in this way because of a domestic argument.","Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast, approached him with lively interest, and learned that he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene."
"Là, le gentleman commença par rassurer Mrs. Aouda, lui disant que les fanfarons n'étaient jamais à craindre. Puis il pria Fix de lui servir de témoin dans la rencontre qui allait avoir lieu. Fix ne pouvait refuser, et Phileas Fogg reprit tranquillement son jeu interrompu, en jouant pique avec un calme parfait.","There the gentleman began by reassuring Mrs. Aouda, telling him that boasters were never to be feared. Then he asked Fix to serve as his witness in the meeting which was about to take place. Fix could not refuse, and Phileas Fogg quietly resumed his interrupted game, playing spades with perfect calm.","Once he was inside, the first thing he did was to reassure Mrs Aouda by saying that loudmouths were never people to be afraid of.

"Pendant les quelques instants qu'il venait d'entrevoir Phileas Fogg, Passepartout avait rapidement, mais soigneusement examiné son futur maître. C' était un homme qui pouvait avoir quarante ans, de figure noble et belle, haut de taille, que ne déparait pas un léger embonpoint, blond de cheveux et de favoris, front uni sans apparences de rides aux tempes, figure plutôt pâle que colorée, dents magnifiques. Il paraissait posséder au plus haut degré ce que les physionomistes appellent « le repos dans l'action » , faculté commune à tous ceux qui font plus de besogne que de bruit. Calme, flegmatique, l'œil pur, la paupière immobile, c'était le type achevé de ces anglais à sang-froid qui se rencontrent assez fréquemment dans le royaume-uni, et dont Angelica Kauffmann a merveilleusement rendu sous son pinceau l'attitude un peu académique. Vu dans les divers actes de son existence, ce gentleman donnait l'idée d'un être bien équilibré dans toutes ses parties, justement pondéré, aussi parfait qu'un chronomètre de Leroy ou de Earnshaw. C'est qu'en effet, Phileas Fogg était l'exactitude personnifiée, ce qui se voyait clairement à « l'expression de ses pieds et de ses mains » , car chez l'homme, aussi bien que chez les animaux, les membres eux-mêmes sont des organes expressifs des passions.","During the few moments that he had just glimpsed Phileas Fogg, Passepartout had quickly but carefully examined his future master. He was a man who could have been forty years old, of noble and handsome face, tall, not disfigured by a slight plumpness, fair hair and sideburns, even forehead without the appearance of wrinkles at the temples, face rather pale than colored. , beautiful teeth. He seemed to possess in the highest degree what physiognomists call ""rest in action,"" a faculty common to all who do more work than noise. Calm, phlegmatic, with pure eyes, motionless eyelids, he was the consummate type of those cold-blooded Englishmen who are met with quite frequently in the United Kingdom, and whose attitude Angelica Kauffmann has wonderfully rendered under her brush. a bit academic. Seen in the various acts of his existence, this gentleman gave the idea of a being well balanced in all his parts, justly weighted, as perfect as a Leroy or Earnshaw chronometer. For, indeed, Phileas Fogg was accuracy personified, which was plainly seen in the ""expression of his feet and hands,"" for in man, as well as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive organs of the passions.","During the brief opportunity he had just had of seeing Phileas Fogg, Passepartout had quickly but carefully observed his future master. He was a man of perhaps forty, with fine and noble features, tall of stature if slightly portly, with fair hair and whiskers, a smooth forehead with no sign of wrinkles around the temples, a complexion that was pale rather than full of colour and magnificent teeth. He seemed the very embodiment of what the physiognomists1 call ‘stillness in the midst of agitation’, a quality common to all those who prefer action to words. Calm, phlegmatic, with clear eyes and a firm gaze, he was the perfect example of the cool-headed Englishman, a type commonly encountered in England and one that the paintings of Angelica Kauffmann2 have captured perfectly in rather a formal pose. As he went about his daily business, the gentleman gave the impression of something perfectly calibrated and finely balanced, like a chronometer made by a master craftsman. Phileas Fogg was indeed the paragon of precision, as could be seen from the expressiveness of his feet and hands since in human beings as well as in animals the limbs are themselves a means of expressing feelings.","During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been carefully observing him. He appeared to be a man about forty years of age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his face rather pale, his teeth magnificent. His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call “repose in action,” a quality of those who act rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas. Seen in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer. Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions."
Phileas Fogg paya l'Indien en bank-notes qui furent extraites du fameux sac. Il semblait vraiment qu'on les tirât des entrailles de Passepartout. Puis Mr. Fogg offrit à Sir Francis Cromarty de le transporter à la station d'Allahabad. Le brigadier général accepta. Un voyageur de plus n'était pas pour fatiguer le gigantesque animal.,Phileas Fogg paid the Indian in banknotes which were extracted from the famous bag.

One extra traveller would not make any difference for this enormous animal.","Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag, a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals.

Passepartout, encore abasourdi, pressait machinalement contre lui le sac aux bank-notes.","The night was dark. A light rain was falling. Phileas Fogg, leaning in his corner, did not speak. Passepartout, still stunned, mechanically pressed the banknote bag against him.","It was pitch dark, and it was drizzling with rain. Phileas Fogg, sitting in his corner, didn’t say a word. Passepartout, still in a state of shock, was clinging on to the bag of banknotes, like an automaton.","The night was dark, and a fine, steady rain was falling. Phileas Fogg, snugly ensconced in his corner, did not open his lips. Passepartout, not yet recovered from his stupefaction, clung mechanically to the carpet-bag, with its enormous treasure."
"— Bien. Vous avez donc vingt heures de retard. Entre vingt et douze, l'écart est de huit. C'est huit heures à regagner. Voulez-vous tenter de le faire ?","- Good. So you're twenty hours late.

You have eight hours to make up. Do you want to attempt it?’,“Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind. Twelve from twenty leaves eight. You must regain eight hours. Do you wish to try to do so?”
"— Et il se porte bien, Mr. Fogg ? demanda Fix du ton le plus naturel.","""And is he well, Mr. Fogg?"" asked Fix in the most natural tone.","‘Is Mr Fogg keeping well?’ Fix asked, sounding quite casual.","“And Mr. Fogg is getting on well?” asked Fix, in the most natural tone in the world."

If only it was an American boat. We might go up in smoke, but at least we’d be travelling faster!’","“The valves are not sufficiently charged!” he exclaimed. “We are not going. Oh, these English!

"Mais il convient de faire observer ici — ce qui rend le fait plus explicable — que cet admirable établissement de « Bank of England » paraît se soucier extrêmement de la dignité du public. Point de gardes, point d'invalides, point de grillages ! L'or, l'argent, les billets sont exposés librement et pour ainsi dire à la merci du premier venu. On ne saurait mettre en suspicion l'honorabilité d'un passant quelconque. Un des meilleurs observateurs des usages anglais raconte même ceci : dans une des salles de la banque où il se trouvait un jour, il eut la curiosité de voir de plus près un lingot d'or pesant sept à huit livres, qui se trouvait exposé sur la tablette du caissier ; il prit ce lingot, l'examina, le passa à son voisin, celui-ci à un autre, si bien que le lingot, de main en main, s'en alla jusqu'au fond d'un corridor obscur, et ne revint qu'une demi-heure après reprendre sa place, sans que le caissier eût seulement levé la tête.","But it should be observed here—which makes the fact more explicable—that this admirable institution of the ""Bank of England"" appears to be extremely concerned about the dignity of the public. No guards, no invalids, no fences! Gold, silver, banknotes are exposed freely and, so to speak, at the mercy of the first comer. One could not put in suspicion the honorability of any passer-by. One of the best observers of English customs even recounts the following: in one of the rooms of the bank where he was one day, he had the curiosity to see more closely an ingot of gold weighing seven to eight pounds, which was displayed on the cashier's tablet; he took this ingot, examined it, passed it to his neighbour, the latter to another, so that the ingot, from hand to hand, went to the end of a dark corridor, and never returned. only half an hour later to resume his place, without the cashier having even raised his head.","But it should be pointed out here – and this makes what happened somewhat easier to explain – that this admirable institution called the Bank of England seems to be extremely concerned for the dignity of the public. There are no guards, no former soldiers and no grilles. Gold, silver and banknotes are on open display at the mercy, so to speak, of all-comers. It would be unthinkable to question the honesty of any member of the public. One of the keenest observers of English society even recounts the following anecdote: one day when he happened to be in one of the rooms in the Bank, he was eager to have a close-up view of a gold ingot, weighing between seven and eight pounds, which was lying on the cashier’s desk for all to see. He picked up the ingot, examined it, handed it to the person next to him, who in turn passed it on, the result being that the gold bar went down to the end of a dark corridor only to come back to its original place half an hour later, without the cashier even looking up.","Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public. There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy of the first comer. A keen observer of English customs relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds. He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour. Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his head."

"D'ailleurs Fix, il faut le dire, n'y comprenait plus rien ! La conquête de lHenrietta, l'achat de son équipage, ce Fogg manœuvrant comme un marin consommé, tout cet ensemble de choses l'étourdissait. Il ne savait plus que penser ! Mais, après tout, un gentleman qui commençait par voler cinquante-cinq mille livres pouvait bien finir par voler un bâtiment. Et Fix fut naturellement amené à croire que lHenrietta, dirigée par Fogg, n'allait point du tout à Liverpool, mais dans quelque point du monde où le voleur, devenu pirate, se mettrait tranquillement en sûreté! Cette hypothèse, il faut bien l'avouer, était on ne peut plus plausible, et le détective commençait à regretter très sérieusement de s'être embarqué dans cette affaire.","Besides Fix, it must be said, no longer understood anything! The conquest of the Henrietta, the purchase of her crew, this Fogg maneuvering like a consummate sailor, all this set of things stunned him. He didn't know what to think anymore! But, after all, a gentleman who started by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end up stealing a building. And Fix was naturally led to believe that the Henrietta, directed by Fogg, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the world where the thief, become a pirate, would put himself in safety! This hypothesis, it must be admitted, was very plausible, and the detective was beginning to very seriously regret having embarked on this affair.","In any case, it has to be said that Fix no longer had a clue about what was going on. This whole sequence of events, the takeover of the Henrietta, the bribing of the crew and Fogg navigating like an experienced sailor, had him baffled. He just didn’t know what to think. But after all a gentleman who started out by stealing £55,000 could easily end up stealing a sailing ship. And Fix naturally went on to conclude that under Phileas Fogg’s command the Henrietta was not heading for Liverpool at all but for some other part of the world where the thief, who had now turned into a pirate, could safely spend the rest of his life. It has to be admitted that this was a perfectly plausible explanation, and the detective was beginning seriously to regret ever having got caught up in this business.","Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on. The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him. He did not know what to think. For, after all, a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg’s command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself in safety. The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair."

"On voyait ces ruminants — ces buffalos, comme les appellent improprement les Américains — marcher ainsi de leur pas tranquille, poussant parfois des beuglements formidables.

"Cette représentation fut ce que sont toutes ces exhibitions d'acrobates. Mais il faut bien avouer que les Japonais sont les premiers équilibristes du monde. L'un, armé de son éventail et de petits morceaux de papier, exécutait l'exercice si gracieux des papillons et des fleurs. Un autre, avec la fumée odorante de sa pipe, traçait rapidement dans l'air une série de mots bleuâtres, qui formaient un compliment à l'adresse de l'assemblée. Celui-ci jonglait avec des bougies allumées, qu'il éteignit successivement quand elles passèrent devant ses lèvres, et qu'il ralluma l'une à l'autre sans interrompre un seul instant sa prestigieuse jonglerie. Celui-là reproduisit, au moyen de toupies tournantes, les plus invraisemblables combinaisons ; sous sa main, ces ronflantes machines semblaient s'animer d'une vie propre dans leur interminable giration ; elles couraient sur des tuyaux de pipe, sur des tranchants de sabre, sur des fils de fer, véritables cheveux tendus d'un côté de la scène à l'autre ; elles faisaient le tour de grands vases de cristal, elles gravissaient des échelles de bambou, elles se dispersaient dans tous les coins, produisant des effets harmoniques d'un étrange caractère en combinant leurs tonalités diverses. Les jongleurs jonglaient avec elles, et elles tournaient dans l'air ; ils les lançaient comme des volants, avec des raquettes de bois, et elles tournaient toujours ; ils les fourraient dans leur poche, et quand ils les retiraient, elles tournaient encore, — jusqu'au moment où un ressort détendu les faisait s'épanouir en gerbes d'artifice !","This performance was what all these exhibitions of acrobats are. But it must be admitted that the Japanese are the first tightrope walkers in the world. One, armed with his fan and small pieces of paper, performed the graceful exercise of butterflies and flowers. Another, with the fragrant smoke of his pipe, quickly traced in the air a series of bluish words, which formed a compliment addressed to the assembly. The latter was juggling with lighted candles, which he extinguished successively when they passed before his lips, and which he relighted one after the other without interrupting for a single moment his prestigious juggling. This one reproduced, by means of spinning tops, the most improbable combinations; under his hand, these humming machines seemed to come alive with a life of their own in their interminable gyration; they ran over pipe stems, over saber edges, over iron wires, real hair stretched from one side of the stage to the other; they made the rounds of large crystal vases, they climbed bamboo ladders, they scattered in every corner, producing harmonic effects of a strange character by combining their various tonalities. The jugglers juggled with them, and they turned in the air; they threw them like shuttlecocks, with wooden paddles, and they kept spinning; they stuffed them into their pockets, and when they took them out they still turned—until the moment when a relaxed spring caused them to burst forth into sheaves of artifice!","It was the usual sort of acrobatic display, but it must be admitted that the Japanese have the best balancing acts in the world. One of the performers, equipped with his fan and small pieces of paper, gracefully imitated the movement of butterflies and flowers. Another, using the sweet-smelling smoke from his pipe, traced a rapid series of blue-coloured words in the air, spelling out compliments to the audience. Another juggled with lighted candles, which he extinguished one by one as they passed in front of his lips and then relit one from the other without interrupting for a moment his wonderful feat of juggling. Another managed to make spinning-tops perform the most amazing figures. In his hands these whirring machines seemed to take on a life of their own in their unending girations. They ran along pipe-stems, sabre blades and wires as thin as wisps of hair, which stretched from one side of the stage to the other. They went around the rims of large crystal vases, climbed up bamboo ladders and then scattered to every corner, producing strange sound effects by the combination of their different tones. The jugglers juggled with them and they spun in the air. They threw them up like shuttlecocks by means of wooden rackets and they continued to spin. They stuffed them in their pockets and when they took them out the tops were still spinning – until the moment when, at the release of a spring, they burst out into a dazzling firework display.","The performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.

Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders, dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone. The jugglers tossed them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores, and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and took them out still whirling as before."

"En dernier ressort, Fix était bien décidé à tout avouer à Passepartout, à lui faire connaître ce maître qu'il servait et dont il n'était certainement pas le complice. Passepartout, éclairé par cette révélation, devant craindre d'être compromis, se rangerait sans doute à lui, Fix.

Un mot de Passepartout à son maître eût suffi à compromettre irrévocablement l'affaire.","As a last resort, Fix had made up his mind to confess everything to Passepartout, to introduce him to this master whom he served and whose accomplice he was certainly not. Passepartout, enlightened by this revelation, having to fear being compromised, would no doubt side with him, Fix.

A note from Passepartout to his master would have sufficed to compromise the affair irrevocably.","As a last resort Fix was quite determined to reveal everything to Passepartout, to make him realize the truth about the master he served, even though he definitely wasn’t his accomplice. After being enlightened by these revelations, Passepartout would fear being implicated and would certainly side with him, Fix. Nevertheless, this was a risky tactic and one only to be used when all else had failed. One word from Passepartout to his master would be enough to completely wreck the whole plan.","Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg’s accomplice, he was very certain. The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an ally of the detective. But this method was a dangerous one, only to be employed when everything else had failed. A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin all."

"En effet, les navires de la Compagnie péninsulaire, qui font le service des mers de Chine, ont un sérieux défaut de construction. Le rapport de leur tirant d'eau en charge avec leur creux a été mal calculé, et, par suite, ils n'offrent qu'une faible résistance à la mer. Leur volume, clos, impénétrable à l'eau, est insuffisant. Ils sont « noyés », pour employer l'expression maritime, et, en conséquence de cette disposition, il ne faut que quelques paquets de mer, jetés à bord, pour modifier leur allure. Ces navires sont donc très inférieurs — sinon par le moteur et l'appareil évaporatoire, du moins par la construction, — aux types des Messageries françaises, tels que l'Impératrice et le Cambodge. Tandis que, suivant les calculs des ingénieurs, ceux-ci peuvent embarquer un poids d'eau égal à leur propre poids avant de sombrer, les bateaux de la Compagnie péninsulaire, le Golgonda, le Corea, et enfin le Rangoon, ne pourraient pas embarquer le sixième de leur poids sans couler par le fond.","Indeed, the ships of the Peninsular Company, which make the service of the seas of China, have a serious defect of construction. The ratio of their draft under load to their depth has been badly calculated, and as a result they offer little resistance to the sea. Their volume, enclosed, impenetrable to water, is insufficient. They are ""drowned,"" to use the maritime expression, and, as a result of this arrangement, only a few swells, thrown on board, are needed to modify their pace. These ships are therefore very inferior—if not in engine and evaporation apparatus, at least in construction—to the types of the French Messageries, such as the Empress and the Cambodia. While, according to the calculations of the engineers, these can embark a weight of water equal to their own weight before sinking, the boats of the Peninsular Company, the Golgonda, the Corea, and finally the Rangoon, could not embark one-sixth of their weight without sinking to the bottom.","The truth is that the ships of the P&O line which sail the China Seas have a serious design fault. The ratio between their draught when laden and their depth has been wrongly calculated and as a result they lack stability in heavy seas. The volume of the ship that is enclosed and watertight is insufficient. The ships are ‘drowned’, to use the sailing term, and because of this lay-out, a few heavy waves washing over the deck are enough to slow them down. These ships are therefore far inferior – if not by their engines and their steam apparatus, then at least in their design – to the sorts of ships used by the French mail service, such as the Impératrice and the Cambodge. Whereas, according to the engineers’ calculations, the latter can take on board a weight of water equal to their own weight before sinking, the P&O ships, the Golconda, the Korea and lastly the Rangoon, could not take on board a sixth of their weight without going down.","The captain as often as possible put up his sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China. Owing to the defective construction of the Rangoon, however, unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least."

However, it now no longer exists and the British possessions in India come under the direct authority of the Crown.","The celebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756, when the English first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city of Madras, down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection.

"Quant à Passepartout, on devine dans quelle colère peu dissimulée il passa ce temps d'épreuve. Jusqu'alors tout avait si bien marché ! La terre et l'eau semblaient être à la dévotion de son maître. Steamers et railways lui obéissaient. Le vent et la vapeur s'unissaient pour favoriser son voyage. L'heure des mécomptes avait-elle donc enfin sonné ? Passepartout, comme si les vingt mille livres du pari eussent dû sortir de sa bourse, ne vivait plus. Cette tempête l'exaspérait, cette rafale le mettait en fureur, et il eût volontiers fouetté cette mer désobéissante ! Pauvre garçon ! Fix lui cacha soigneusement sa satisfaction personnelle, et il fit bien, car si Passepartout eût deviné le secret contentement de Fix, Fix eût passé un mauvais quart d'heure.","As for Passepartout, we can guess in what little concealed anger he spent this time of trial. So far everything had gone so well! Earth and water seemed to be devout to his master. Steamers and railways obeyed him. The wind and the vapor united to favor its journey. Had the hour of setbacks finally come? Passepartout, as if the twenty thousand pounds of the wager had to come out of his purse, was no longer living. This storm exasperated him, this gust infuriated him, and he would gladly have whipped this disobedient sea! Poor boy ! Fix carefully hid his personal satisfaction from him, and he did well, for if Passepartout had guessed Fix's secret contentment, Fix would have had a bad time.","As for Passepartout, it is easy to imagine what little effort he made to disguise his anger during this ordeal. Up until then everything had gone so well. Land and sea seemed at his master’s command. Steamers and railways obeyed him. Wind and steam united to further his progress. Was this the turning-point with things starting to go wrong? Passepartout was on tenterhooks, as if the £20,000 for the bet had come out of his own pocket. The storm got on his nerves, the gale infuriated him and he would happily have whipped the sea for its disobedience.1 Poor chap! Fix was careful to conceal from him his personal satisfaction and that was the sensible thing to do, because if Passepartout had sensed his secret enjoyment of the situation, Fix would have been in for it.","Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather. Everything had gone so well till now! Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master’s service; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam united to speed his journey. Had the hour of adversity come? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket. The storm exasperated him, the gale made him furious, and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience. Poor fellow! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction, for, had he betrayed it, Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence."
"En première ligne s'avançaient des prêtres, coiffés de mitres et vêtus de longues robes chamarrées. Ils étaient entourés d'hommes, de femmes, d'enfants, qui faisaient entendre une sorte de psalmodie funèbre, interrompue à intervalles égaux par des coups de tam-tams et de cymbales. Derrière eux, sur un char aux larges roues dont les rayons et la jante figuraient un entrelacement de serpents, apparut une statue hideuse, traînée par deux couples de zébus richement caparaçonnés. Cette statue avait quatre bras ; le corps colorié d'un rouge sombre, les yeux hagards, les cheveux emmêlés, la langue pendante, les lèvres teintes de henné et de bétel. À son cou s'enroulait un collier de têtes de mort, à ses flancs une ceinture de mains coupées. Elle se tenait debout sur un géant terrassé auquel le chef manquait.","In the front line came priests, wearing miters and dressed in long, colorful robes. They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sounded a sort of funeral psalmody, interrupted at equal intervals by the sound of tom-toms and cymbals. Behind them, on a chariot with large wheels whose spokes and rim represented an interlacing of serpents, appeared a hideous statue, dragged by two couples of richly caparisoned zebus. This statue had four arms; the body colored a dark red, the haggard eyes, the matted hair, the hanging tongue, the lips dyed with henna and betel. Around her neck was a necklace of skulls, around her sides a belt of severed hands. She was standing on a fallen giant whose leader was missing.","At the front came the priests, wearing mitres and long, brightly decorated robes. They were surrounded by men, women and children, who were chanting a sort of funeral hymn, interrupted at regular intervals by the playing of gongs and cymbals. Behind them, on a cart with large wheels, the spokes and rims of which represented intertwined snakes, there appeared a hideous statue pulled by two pairs of zebus richly decked out. The statue had four arms. Its body was dark red, its eyes wild and staring, its hair tangled, its tongue lolling and its lips dyed with henna and betel juice. Around its neck was draped a garland of death’s heads and around its waist a girdle of severed hands. It was standing over a felled giant, whose head had been cut off.","First came the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed in long lace robes. They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels, the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other. Upon the car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus, stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red, with haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips tinted with betel. It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant."
"Passepartout, n'étant point homme à laisser languir une idée, se dirigea vers le port de Yokohama. Mais à mesure qu'il s'approchait des docks, son projet, qui lui avait paru si simple au moment où il en avait eu l'idée, lui semblait de plus en plus inexécutable. Pourquoi aurait-on besoin d'un cuisinier ou d'un domestique à bord d'un paquebot américain, et quelle confiance inspirerait-il, affublé de la sorte ? Quelles recommandations faire valoir ? Quelles références indiquer ?","Passepartout, not being a man to let an idea languish, headed for the port of Yokohama. But as he approached the docks, his project, which had seemed so simple to him when he had had the idea, seemed to him more and more unrealizable. Why would one need a cook or a servant on board an American ocean liner, and what confidence would he inspire decked out like that? What recommendations should be made? Which references to indicate?","Passepartout was not the type who would let an idea go to waste and so he headed for Yokohama harbour. But the closer he got to the docks, the more his plan, which had looked so simple on the spur of the moment, seemed impractical. Why would they need a cook or servant on board an American steamer, and how would anyone trust him in his present get-up? What recommendations or references did he have?","Passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging, and directed his steps towards the docks. But, as he approached them, his project, which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow more and more formidable to his mind. What need would they have of a cook or servant on an American steamer, and what confidence would they put in him, dressed as he was? What references could he give?"
"Il savait quelques refrains de France et d'Angleterre, et il résolut de les essayer.

The Japanese must certainly be music lovers, since everything is done at home to the sounds of cymbals, tom-toms and drums, and they could only appreciate the talents of a European virtuoso.","He knew a few French and English popular songs and he made up his mind to try them out. The Japanese must certainly be keen on music since they did everything to the accompaniment of cymbals, drums and tambourines, and they were bound to appreciate the talents of a European virtuoso.","He knew several French and English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals, tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European talent."

"C'étaient, en effet, le maître et le serviteur. Le maître présenta son passeport, en priant laconiquement le consul de vouloir bien y apposer son visa.","They were, indeed, master and servant. The master presented his passport, laconically asking the consul to affix his visa to it.",This time it was the master and his servant. The master showed his passport and asked the consul in the fewest possible words to be so kind as to stamp it.,"The consul did not finish his sentence, for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door, and two strangers entered, one of whom was the servant whom Fix had met on the quay. The other, who was his master, held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it."
"Quelle traversée ! Les voyageurs, pressés les uns contre les autres, ne pouvaient se parler. Le froid, accru par la vitesse, leur eût coupé la parole. Le traîneau glissait aussi légèrement à la surface de la plaine qu'une embarcation à la surface des eaux —, avec la houle en moins. Quand la brise arrivait en rasant la terre, il semblait que le traîneau fût enlevé du sol par ses voiles, vastes ailes d'une immense envergure. Mudge, au gouvernail se maintenait dans la ligne droite, et, d'un coup de godille il rectifiait les embardées que l'appareil tendait à faire. Toute la toile portait. Le foc avait été perqué et n'était plus abrité par la brigantine. Un mât de hune fut guindé, et une flèche, tendue au vent, ajouta sa puissance d'impulsion à celle des autres voiles. On ne pouvait l'estimer, mathématiquement, mais certainement la vitesse du traîneau ne devait pas être moindre de quarante milles à l'heure.","What a crossing! The travellers, pressed against each other, could not speak to each other. The cold, increased by the speed, would have cut them off. The sled glided as lightly over the surface of the plain as a boat over the surface of the water—minus the swell. When the breeze came skimming the ground, it seemed as if the sledge had been lifted from the ground by its sails, vast wings of immense span. Mudge, at the helm, kept himself in a straight line, and with a stroke of his scull he corrected the yaws that the craft tended to make. The whole canvas bore. The jib had been sunk and was no longer sheltered by the brigantine. A topmast was stilted, and a jib, stretched to the wind, added its momentum to that of the other sails. It couldn't be estimated, mathematically, but certainly the speed of the sled couldn't be less than forty miles an hour.","What a journey it turned out to be! The travellers, huddled up against one another, were unable to speak. The cold, intensified by the speed, would have prevented the words from coming out of their mouths. The sledge glided over the surface of the plain as lightly as a vessel over the surface of the water – minus the swell. When the wind came skimming along the ground, it looked as if the sledge would be lifted into the air by its sails, huge wings with a vast span. Mudge, at the rudder, kept it going straight, and with a touch on the oar he prevented the contraption from veering to one side, which it had a tendency to do. All the sails caught the wind. The jib had been perked and was no longer shielded by the spanker. A topmast was hoisted and a topsail, put out into the wind, added its driving force to the other sails. It was impossible to work it out exactly, but the sledge must certainly have attained a speed of no less than forty knots.","What a journey! The travellers, huddled close together, could not speak for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they were going. The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves.

Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a straight line, and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make. All the sails were up, and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine. A top-mast was hoisted, and another jib, held out to the wind, added its force to the other sails.

"Mais pendant cette conférence, le train avait marché rapidement, et, vers midi et demi, il touchait à sa pointe nord-ouest le grand lac Salé.

The cheers increased, accompanied by shouting and booing. The poles carrying the banners were turned into offensive weapons. Hands gave way to fists everywhere. On the tops of carriages that had stopped and omnibuses that had been brought to a standstill, people were trading punches. Everything served as a missile. Boots and shoes came flying through the air and it even seemed as if a few revolvers were being fired, giving an added touch of local colour to the shouting of the crowd.","Aouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg’s arm, observed the tumultuous scene with surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was.

"Certes, l'honnête garçon avait, par prévision, aussi copieusement déjeuné qu'il avait pu avant de quitter le Carnatic ; mais après une journée de promenade, il se sentit l'estomac très creux. Il avait bien remarqué que moutons, chèvres ou porcs, manquaient absolument aux étalages des bouchers indigènes, et, comme il savait que c'est un sacrilège de tuer les bœufs, uniquement réservés aux besoins de l'agriculture, il en avait conclu que la viande était rare au Japon. Il ne se trompait pas ; mais à défaut de viande de boucherie, son estomac se fût fort accommodé des quartiers de sanglier ou de daim, des perdrix ou des cailles, de la volaille ou du poisson, dont les Japonais se nourrissent presque exclusivement avec le produit des rizières. Mais il dut faire contre fortune bon cœur, et remit au lendemain le soin de pourvoir à sa nourriture.","Certainly, the honest boy had, by anticipation, lunched as copiously as he could before leaving the Carnatic; but after a day's walk he felt very hollow in his stomach. He had noticed that sheep, goats or pigs were absolutely lacking in the displays of the native butchers, and, as he knew that it was a sacrilege to kill oxen, reserved solely for the needs of agriculture, he had concluded that the meat was rare in Japan. He was not wrong ; but in the absence of butcher's meat, his stomach would have been well adapted to quarters of wild boar or deer, partridges or quails, poultry or fish, on which the Japanese feed almost exclusively with the produce of the rice fields. But he had to put up a good heart against his fortune, and put off until the next day the care of providing for his food.","Admittedly the trusty fellow had taken the precaution of having a hearty meal before leaving the Carnatic, but after a day’s walk, he felt pretty hungry. He had been quick to notice that there was absolutely no mutton, goat or pork on the stands of the local butchers, and because he knew that it was against their religion to kill cattle, which were used only for agricultural purposes, he had come to the conclusion that meat was very scarce in Japan. He was quite right about this but if he couldn’t eat butcher’s meat his stomach would have made do quite happily with a joint or two of wild boar or deer, a few partridges or quails, some poultry or fish, which together with rice make up the staple diet of the Japanese. However, he had to make the best of things and so he put off until the next day the question of finding something to eat.","The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic; but, as he had been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming importunate. He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat, nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle, which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama - nor was he mistaken; and, in default of butcher’s meat, he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish, which, with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively. But he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning."

Indeed, since he had left London, as much in travel expenses as in premiums, in the purchase of an elephant, in deposits and in fines, Phileas Fogg had already sown more than five thousand pounds (125,000 fr.) on his road, and the so much per cent of the sum recovered, attributed to the detectives, was always diminishing.","The police inspector was justified in thinking this. It was certainly true that since leaving London, between the cost of travel, the money spent on rewards, buying an elephant and paying the bail and the fines, Phileas Fogg had already used up more than £5,000 to get this far, and the proportion of the amount recovered, which would go to the detectives, was getting smaller all the time.","The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture.

"Il est opportun de faire connaître quelles pensées occupaient alors l'esprit de Passepartout. Jusqu'à son arrivée à Bombay, il avait cru et pu croire que ces choses en resteraient là. Mais maintenant, depuis qu'il filait à toute vapeur à travers l'Inde, un revirement s'était fait dans son esprit. Son naturel lui revenait au galop. Il retrouvait les idées fantaisistes de sa jeunesse, il prenait au sérieux les projets de son maître, il croyait à la réalité du pari, conséquemment à ce tour du monde et à ce maximum de temps, qu'il ne fallait pas dépasser. Déjà même, il s'inquiétait des retards possibles, des accidents qui pouvaient survenir en route. Il se sentait comme intéressé dans cette gageure, et tremblait à la pensée qu'il avait pu la compromettre la veille par son impardonnable badauderie. Aussi, beaucoup moins flegmatique que Mr. Fogg, il était beaucoup plus inquiet. Il comptait et recomptait les jours écoulés, maudissait les haltes du train, l'accusait de lenteur et blâmait in petto Mr. Fogg de n'avoir pas promis une prime au mécanicien. Il ne savait pas, le brave garçon, que ce qui était possible sur un paquebot ne l'était plus sur un chemin de fer, dont la vitesse est réglementée.","It is appropriate to make known what thoughts then occupied the mind of Passepartout. Until his arrival in Bombay, he had believed and could have believed that these things would end there. But now, since he was speeding across India, a shift had taken place in his mind. His naturalness came back to him at a gallop. He rediscovered the fanciful ideas of his youth, he took his master's projects seriously, he believed in the reality of the bet, consequently in this world tour and in this maximum time, which he must not exceed. Already he was worrying about possible delays, accidents that might occur on the way. He felt himself to be interested in this wager, and trembled at the thought that he had been able to compromise it the day before by his unforgivable idleness. Also, much less phlegmatic than Mr. Fogg, he was much more worried. He counted and recounted the days that had passed, cursed the train's halts, accused it of being slow and blamed Mr. Fogg in petto for not having promised the mechanic a bonus. Little did he know, good fellow, that what was possible on a steamer was no longer possible on a railroad, the speed of which is regulated.","It is worth explaining at this point the thoughts that were going through Passepartout’s mind. Up until his arrival in Bombay, he had believed quite reasonably that that was as far as things would go. But now, since he had been speeding across India, he had undergone a change of mind. His natural instincts had returned with a vengeance. He rediscovered all the fanciful ideas of his younger days; he took his master’s plans seriously; he believed that the bet was for real, as were the journey around the world and the maximum number of days that they mustn’t exceed. Already even he was worrying about possible delays and accidents that might occur on the way. He felt caught up in this bet and trembled at the thought that he might have jeopardized it the previous day by the unforgivable way he had wandered off sightseeing. Therefore, being much less phlegmatic than Mr Fogg, he was much more anxious. He counted over and over the days that had gone, cursing the train every time it halted, accusing it of being too slow, and inwardly criticizing Mr Fogg, for not having offered the driver a reward. The dear fellow did not realize that what was possible on a steamboat was not possible on a railway where the speed is regulated.","Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie. Up to his arrival at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there; but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams. His old vagabond nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him. He came to regard his master’s project as intended in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period. Already he began to worry about possible delays, and accidents which might happen on the way. He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before. Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could not be done on the railway."

"Depuis ce jour, Passepartout et le détective se rencontrèrent fréquemment, mais l'agent se tint dans une extrême réserve vis-à-vis de son compagnon, et il n'essaya point de le faire parler.

On one or two occasions only did he catch sight of Mr Fogg, who was happy to remain in the main lounge of the Rangoon, either because he was keeping Mrs Aouda company or because he was playing whist, an unvarying part of his daily routine.","The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview, though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg.

"Là, suspendu d'une main entre le wagon des bagages et le tender, de l'autre il décrocha les chaînes de sûreté ; mais par suite de la traction opérée, il n'aurait jamais pu parvenir à dévisser la barre d'attelage, si une secousse que la machine éprouva n'eût fait sauter cette barre, et le train, détaché, resta peu à peu en arrière, tandis que la locomotive s'enfuyait avec une nouvelle vitesse.","There, suspended with one hand between the baggage car and the tender, with the other he unhooked the safety chains; but as a result of the traction operated, he would never have been able to unscrew the drawbar, if a shock which the machine experienced had not caused this bar to jump, and the train, detached, remained little by little behind. , while the locomotive ran away with a new speed.","Hanging by one hand between the luggage van and the tender, he used his other hand to unhook the safety chains, but because of the force of traction he would never have managed to undo the coupling-pin if a sudden jolt of the engine hadn’t released it, so that the carriages, detached from the engine, were gradually left behind, while the locomotive sped ahead even faster.","There, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender, with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing to the traction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar, had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out.

"Au lieu de s'embarquer en Angleterre pour les États-Unis, comme un coquin vulgaire, ce Fogg avait fait le grand tour et traversé les trois quarts du globe, afin de gagner plus sûrement le continent américain, où il mangerait tranquillement le million de la Banque, après avoir dépisté la police. Mais une fois sur la terre de l'Union, que ferait Fix ? Abandonnerait-il cet homme ? Non, cent fois non ! et jusqu'à ce qu'il eût obtenu un acte d'extradition, il ne le quitterait pas d'une semelle. C'était son devoir, et il l'accomplirait jusqu'au bout.

But once on Union land, what would Fix do? Would he abandon this man? No, a hundred times no! and until he had obtained an act of extradition, he would not leave it a single inch. It was his duty, and he would fulfill it to the end. In any case, a happy circumstance had occurred: Passepartout was no longer with his master, and above all, after Fix's confidences, it was important that master and servant never see each other again.","Instead of leaving England for the United States, like any ordinary criminal, this man Fogg had gone the long way round and crossed three quarters of the globe in order to have a better chance of getting to America where he would quietly get through all the Bank’s money once the police were off his trail. But what would Fix do once he was in the United States? Would he give up on his man? No way. Until he received the extradition papers he wouldn’t let Fogg out of his sight.

In any case, one thing had worked in his favour: Passepartout was no longer there to help his master, and, above all, after the secrets Fix had already given away, it was vital that master and servant should not see each other ever again.","Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank. But, once in the United States, what should he, Fix, do? Should he abandon this man? No, a hundred times no! Until he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an hour. It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end.

At such times the ladies disappeared, the pianos fell silent and the singing and dancing all stopped. And yet, despite the gale and the swell, the steamer, thanks to its powerful engines, continued on schedule down towards the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb.","But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long and narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the Mongolia, with her long hull, rolled fearfully. Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good ship ploughed straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb."

"Le développement panoramique de ces îles était superbe. D'immenses forêts de lataniers, d'arecs, de bambousiers, de muscadiers, de tecks, de gigantesques mimosées, de fougères arborescentes, couvraient le pays en premier plan, et en arrière se profilait l'élégante silhouette des montagnes. Sur la côte pullulaient par milliers ces précieuses salanganes, dont les nids comestibles forment un mets recherché dans le Céleste Empire. Mais tout ce spectacle varié, offert aux regards par le groupe des Andaman, passa vite, et le Rangoon s'achemina rapidement vers le détroit de Malacca, qui devait lui donner accès dans les mers de la Chine.","The scenic development of these islands was superb. Immense forests of lataniers, areca, bamboo, nutmeg, teak, gigantic mimosa, tree ferns, covered the country in the foreground, and behind loomed the elegant silhouette of the mountains.

But all this varied spectacle, presented to the gaze by the group of Andamans, passed quickly, and the Rangoon proceeded rapidly towards the straits of Malacca, which were to give her access to the seas of China.","The panoramic view of the islands was magnificent. Immense forests of fan palms, areca palms, bamboo, nutmeg, teaks, giant mimosas and tree-ferns made up the landscape to the foreground and behind it stood the majestic backdrop of the mountains. The coastline was swarming with thousands of these precious sea-swallows whose edible nests provide the Chinese with one of their most sought after delicacies. But the whole of this diverse spectacle offered by the view of the Andaman Islands soon came to an end and the Rangoon headed swiftly for the Strait of Malacca, which led on to the China Seas.","The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb.

"Non ! rien. En sortant du bureau des passeports, Phileas Fogg se rendit tranquillement à la gare, et là il se fit servir à dîner. Entre autres mets, le maître d'hôtel crut devoir lui recommander une certaine gibelotte de « lapin du pays », dont il lui dit merveille.","Nope ! nothing. Leaving the passport office, Phileas Fogg went quietly to the station, and there he was served dinner.

Among the dishes served up to him, the landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of “native rabbit,” on which he prided himself."
"C'est en 1862 que, malgré l'opposition des députés du Sud, qui voulaient une ligne plus méridionale, le tracé du rail-road fut arrêté entre le quarante et unième et le quarante-deuxième parallèle. Le président Lincoln, de si regrettée mémoire, fixa lui-même, dans l'État de Nebraska, à la ville d'Omaha, la tête de ligne du nouveau réseau. Les travaux furent aussitôt commencés et poursuivis avec cette activité américaine, qui n'est ni paperassière ni bureaucratique. La rapidité de la main-d'œuvre ne devait nuire en aucune façon à la bonne exécution du chemin. Dans la prairie, on avançait à raison d'un mille et demi par jour. Une locomotive, roulant sur les rails de la veille, apportait les rails du lendemain, et courait à leur surface au fur et à mesure qu'ils étaient posés.","It was in 1862 that, despite the opposition of the deputies from the South, who wanted a more southern line, the route of the rail-road was stopped between the forty-first and the forty-second parallel. President Lincoln, of so late memory, himself fixed, in the State of Nebraska, at the city of Omaha, the head of line of the new network. Work was immediately started and continued with this American activity, which is neither paperwork nor bureaucratic. The speed of the labor should in no way harm the proper execution of the path. In the prairie, we advanced at the rate of a mile and a half a day. A locomotive, running on the rails of the day before, brought the rails of the next day, and ran over their surface as they were laid.","It was in 1862 that, despite the opposition of representatives from the southern states, who wanted a line further to the south, it was decided that the route for the new railroad would run between the forty-first and forty-second parallels. The late, lamented President Lincoln himself chose the town of Omaha in the state of Nebraska as the starting-point of the new network. Work began immediately and was carried out in typical American style, without too much paperwork or bureaucratic fuss. The speed with which the track was laid would not at all affect the quality of its contruction. Over the prairies the work progressed at a mile and a half per day. A locomotive running along the track that had been laid the previous day transported the rails for the day after and worked its way along them as they were being laid.","It was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, who wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels. President Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska. The work was at once commenced, and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution. The road grew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day. A locomotive, running on the rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laid on the morrow, and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position."

"L'éléphant fit entendre quelques grognement de satisfaction. Puis, prenant Passepartout par la ceinture et l'enroulant de sa trompe, il l'enleva jusqu'à la hauteur de sa tête. Passepartout, nullement effrayé, fit une bonne caresse à l'animal, qui le replaça doucement à terre, et, à la poignée de trompe de l'honnête Kiouni, répondit une vigoureuse poignée de main de l'honnête garçon.","The elephant gave a few growls of satisfaction. Then, taking Passepartout by the belt and encircling it with his trunk, he lifted it up to the height of his head. Passepartout, not at all frightened, gave the animal a good caress, which gently placed it back on the ground, and, to the handle of the honest Kiouni's trunk, answered a vigorous handshake from the honest boy.","The elephant gave out a few grunts of satisfaction. Then he took Passepartout by the waist and, wrapping his trunk around him, lifted him as high as his head.

"— Monsieur le consul, répondit dogmatiquement l'inspecteur de police, les grands voleurs ressemblent toujours à d'honnêtes gens. Vous comprenez bien que ceux qui ont des figures de coquins n'ont qu'un parti à prendre, c'est de rester probes, sans cela ils se feraient arrêter.

You understand well that those who have the faces of rascals have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest, otherwise they would be arrested. Honest countenances are the ones that must be stared at above all. Difficult work, I agree, and which is no longer a trade, but art. »","‘My dear consul,’ the police inspector replied in a dogmatic tone of voice, ‘great thieves always look like respectable people. You must understand that people who look like crooks have only one option, to remain on the right side of the law. Otherwise they would be arrested. It’s the honest-looking faces you have to examine closely. A difficult task, I admit, and one that makes this not just a job but an art.’","“Consul,” remarked the detective, dogmatically, “great robbers always resemble honest folks. Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand. The artistic thing is, to unmask honest countenances; it’s no light task , I admit, but a real art.”"
"On vivait donc bien à bord du Mongolia, dans cette société de fonctionnaires, auxquels se mêlaient quelques jeunes Anglais, qui, le million en poche, allaient fonder au loin des comptoirs de commerce. Le « purser », l'homme de confiance de la Compagnie, l'égal du capitaine à bord, faisait somptueusement les choses. Au déjeuner du matin, au lunch de deux heures, au dîner de cinq heures et demie, au souper de huit heures, les tables pliaient sous les plats de viande fraîche et les entremets fournis par la boucherie et les offices du paquebot. Les passagères — il y en avait quelques-unes — changeaient de toilette deux fois par jour. On faisait de la musique, on dansait même, quand la mer le permettait.","We therefore lived well on board the Mongolia, in this society of functionaries, with whom a few young Englishmen mingled, who, with the million in their pocket, went to found trading posts far away. The purser, the Company's right-hand man, the captain's equal on board, did things sumptuously. At breakfast in the morning, at lunch at two o'clock, at dinner at half-past five, at supper at eight o'clock, the tables were bent under the dishes of fresh meat and the entremets provided by the butcher's shop and the galleys of the liner. The passengers—there were a few of them—changed clothes twice a day. We made music, we even danced, when the sea allowed it.","Life on board the Mongolia was therefore one of luxury with a society made up of public servants supplemented by the occasional young English millionaire off to set up a trading post in some far-off part of the empire. The purser, the company’s most trusted employee and the equal of the captain on board, did things in style. At breakfast, lunch at two o’clock, dinner at half past five and supper at eight o’clock, the tables groaned under plates of fresh meat and side dishes served up from the ship’s meat store and galley. The female passengers – there were some – changed dresses twice a day. There was music and even dancing on board, when the state of the sea allowed.","What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the Mongolia.

C'est du flair qu'il faut avoir, et le flair est comme un sens spécial auquel concourent l'ouïe, la vue et l'odorat. J'ai arrêté dans ma vie plus d'un de ces gentlemen, et pourvu que mon voleur soit à bord, je vous réponds qu'il ne me glissera pas entre les mains.","""Monsieur le consul,"" replied Fix, ""we feel these people rather than recognize them."" You have to have flair, and flair is like a special sense to which hearing, sight and smell contribute. I have arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my life, and provided my thief is on board, I assure you that he will not slip through my hands.","‘My dear sir,’ replied Fix, ‘you sniff out this sort of individual rather than recognize them. It’s nose that you need and nose is like an extra sense, a combination of hearing, sight and smell. In my lifetime I’ve arrested more than one of these gentlemen, and as long as my thief really is on board I can guarantee you that he won’t slip through my fingers.’","“A man rather feels the presence of these fellows, consul, than recognises them. You must have a scent for them, and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, and smelling. I’ve arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and, if my thief is on board, I’ll answer for it; he’ll not slip through my fingers.”"
"— Cinquante-cinq mille livres ! reprit Fix, qui força Passepartout à se rasseoir, après avoir fait apporter un flacon de brandy, — et si je réussis, je gagne une prime de deux mille livres.

Do you want five hundred (12,500 fr.) on condition that you help me?","‘£55,000,’ Fix went on, forcing Passepartout to sit down again after ordering another flagon of brandy. ‘And if I’m successful I earn a reward of £2,000. Would you fancy £500, if you agree to help me?’","Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: “Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you’ll help me, I’ll let you have five hundred of them.” “Help you?”"
"Le courtier auquel s'adressa Mr. Fogg connaissait en effet le négociant parsi. Mais, depuis deux ans, celui-ci n'habitait plus la Chine. Sa fortune faite, il s'était établi en Europe — en Hollande, croyait-on —, ce qui s'expliquait par suite de nombreuses relations qu'il avait eues avec ce pays pendant son existence commerciale.","The broker whom Mr. Fogg contacted did indeed know the Parsi trader. But for two years he had no longer lived in China. His fortune made, he had established himself in Europe—in Holland, it was believed—which was explained by the numerous relations he had had with that country during his commercial existence.","The broker who Mr Fogg spoke to did indeed know the Parsee businessman. However, the latter had not lived in China for the past two years. After making his fortune he had settled in Europe – probably Holland, which was understandable given the large number of trading connections he had had with that country during his time as a businessman.","Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange, where, he did not doubt, every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee merchant.

He had certainly not made the bet in order to win money and he had only committed these £20,000 – half of his fortune – because he expected to have to spend the other half on carrying out this difficult, not to say impossible, mission. His opponents, for their part, seemed uncomfortable, not because of the amount of money at stake but because they felt embarrassed about the one-sidedness of the arrangement.","A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties, during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure. He certainly did not bet to win, and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds, half of his fortune, because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult, not to say unattainable, project. As for his antagonists, they seemed much agitated; not so much by the value of their stake, as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend."

"« Soit ! se dit Fix, après le premier moment de colère, mon mandat n'est plus bon ici, il le sera en Angleterre. Ce coquin a tout l'air de revenir dans sa patrie, croyant avoir dépisté la police.

As far as the money is concerned, I just hope to goodness there’ll be some left. Nevertheless, between the cost of the journey, the bonuses, the court case, the fines, the elephant and assorted expenses, my man must already have spent £5,000 during his travels. Never mind. The Bank’s not short of money!’","“Well,” thought Fix, after a moment of anger, “my warrant is not good here, but it will be in England. The rogue evidently intends to return to his own country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track. Good! I will follow him across the Atlantic. As for the money, heaven grant there may be some left! But the fellow has already spent in travelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts of charges, more than five thousand pounds. Yet, after all, the Bank is rich!”"

Mr. Fogg lightly squeezed his companion's fingers. Compliments from Mrs. Aouda were more affectionate. She would never forget what she owed Sir Francis Cromarty.

Mr. Fogg lightly pressed him by the hand. The parting of Aouda, who did not forget what she owed to Sir Francis, betrayed more warmth; and, as for Passepartout, he received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general."

En d'autres termes, pendant que Phileas Fogg, marchant vers l'est, voyait le soleil passer quatre-vingts fois au méridien, ses collègues restés à Londres ne le voyaient passer que soixante-dix-neuf fois. C'est pourquoi, ce jour-là même, qui était le samedi et non le dimanche, comme le croyait Mr. Fogg, ceux-ci l'attendaient dans le salon du Reform-Club.","Indeed, in marching towards the east, Phileas Fogg went towards the sun, and, consequently, the days diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction. Now, there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the earth's circumference, and these three hundred and sixty degrees, multiplied by four minutes, give precisely twenty-four hours — that is to say, this day unconsciously gained. In other words, while Phileas Fogg, walking east, saw the sun pass eighty times over the meridian, his colleagues in London saw it pass only seventy-nine times. That is why, on that very day, which was Saturday and not Sunday, as Mr. Fogg believed, they were waiting for him in the salon of the Reform Club.","By travelling eastwards Phileas Fogg had gone towards the sun and therefore the days became shorter for him by four minutes with every degree of longitude he crossed in that direction. As the earth has a circumference of 360 degrees, these 360 degrees multiplied by four minutes give exactly twenty-four hours, that is, the day that he had gained without being aware of it. In other words, by going eastwards Phileas Fogg had seen the sun cross the meridian eighty times, whereas his colleagues back in London had only seen it cross seventy-nine times. This is why on that very day, which was a Saturday and not a Sunday, as Phileas Fogg thought, these gentlemen were waiting for him in the drawing-room of the Reform Club.","In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction. There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty degrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four hours - that is, the day unconsciously gained. In other words, while Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times. This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday, and not Sunday, as Mr. Fogg thought."
"— C'est vu, répondit Mr. Fogg. Je pense que nous devrons attendre la nuit pour agir ?","""It's seen,"" replied Mr. Fogg. I think we'll have to wait until nightfall to act?","‘We have,’ answered Mr Fogg. ‘I feel we must wait until nightfall before taking action.’","“That is foreseen,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I think we must wait till night before acting.”"
"Quoi qu'il en soit, Mr. Fogg avait soigneusement posé sa montre sur une table et il en regardait les aiguilles marcher. Pas une parole ne s'échappait de ses lèvres, mais son regard avait une fixité singulière.","Be that as it may, Mr. Fogg had carefully placed his watch on a table and was watching the hands move. Not a word escaped his lips, but his gaze had a singular fixity.","Whatever the case, Mr Fogg had carefully placed his watch on the table and he was looking at the hands move forward. Not a word crossed his lips, but there was an especially intent look on his face.","However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table, and observed its advancing hands. Not a word escaped his lips, but his look was singularly set and stern."
"Mais — contretemps funeste — des gardes se montrèrent au chevet de la pagode, et s'y installèrent de manière à empêcher toute approche.","But—a disastrous setback—guards appeared at the apse of the pagoda, and installed themselves there in such a way as to prevent any approach.",But by an unfortunate turn of events some guards showed up at the back of the temple and took up position there in order to prevent anyone getting near.,"But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise."

"Passepartout songea alors à visiter les paquebots en partance pour l'Amérique. Il comptait s'offrir en qualité de cuisinier ou de domestique, ne demandant pour toute rétribution que le passage et la nourriture. Une fois à San Francisco, il verrait à se tirer d'affaire. L'important, c'était de traverser ces quatre mille sept cents milles du Pacifique qui s'étendent entre le Japon et le Nouveau Monde.","Passepartout then thought of visiting the steamers leaving for America. He counted on offering himself as a cook or a servant, asking for payment only for passage and food. Once in San Francisco, he would see to getting by.

He was planning to offer his services as a cook or servant, and wanted in return only his food and passage. Once he’d reached San Francisco he’d see about sorting out his other problems.

"Le lendemain, 8 novembre, au lever du soleil, la goélette avait fait plus de cent milles. Le loch, souvent jeté, indiquait que la moyenne de sa vitesse était entre huit et neuf milles.

Si le vent tenait dans ces conditions, les chances étaient pour elle.","The next day, November 8, at sunrise, the schooner had traveled over a hundred miles. The log, often cast, indicated that her average speed was between eight and nine miles. The Tankadère had some reach in her sails which were all carrying and she obtained, under this speed, her maximum speed. If the wind held in those conditions, the odds were in her favor.","By sunrise the following morning, 8 November, the schooner had done more than a hundred miles. The log,1 which was frequently dropped into the water, showed that the average speed was between eight and nine knots. The Tankadère had slack in its sails, which were all out, and with this setting it could reach its maximum speed. If the wind held, all would be well.","At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more than one hundred miles. The log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles.
