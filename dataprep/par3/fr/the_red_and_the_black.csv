"— Eh bien, messieurs! faites-moi destituer, s’était écrié le vieux curé, d’une voix tremblante. Je n’en habiterai pas moins le pays. On sait qu’il y a quarante-huit ans, j’ai hérité d’un champ qui rapporte huit cents livres. Je vivrai avec ce revenu. Je ne fais point d’économies illicites dans ma place, moi, messieurs, et c’est peut-être pourquoi je ne suis pas si effrayé quand on parle de me la faire perdre.","“Well, gentlemen! have me dismissed, cried the old priest, in a trembling voice. I shall none the less live in the country. We know that forty-eight years ago I inherited a field that yields eight hundred pounds. I will live on this income. I make no illicit savings in my place, me, gentlemen, and that is perhaps why I am not so frightened when people talk of making me lose it.","“Well then, gentlemen, dismiss me,” the old priest cried, his voice trembling. “I’m still going to live here. Everyone knows that, forty-eight years ago, I inherited land that brings in eight hundred francs. I will live on that. I don’t put away anything from my salary, which may be why I’m never frightened when there’s talk of taking it away from me.”","“Well, gentlemen, turn me out then,” the old curé exclaimed in a trembling voice; “I shall still continue to live in the district. As you know, I inherited forty-eight years ago a piece of land that brings in eight hundred francs a year; I shall live on that income. I do not save anything out of my living, gentlemen; and that is perhaps why, when you talk to me about it, I am not particularly frightened.”"
"C’est qu’il avait maintenant pour implacable ennemie cette imagination puissante, autrefois sans cesse employée à lui peindre dans l’avenir des succès si brillants.","It was because he now had for implacable enemy that powerful imagination, formerly incessantly employed to paint for him such brilliant successes in the future.","His implacable enemy, now, was precisely that powerful imagination, once so interminably busy, painting for him a future full of brilliant successes.",The fact was that the same powerful imagination which had formerly been continuously employed in painting a successful future in the most brilliant colours had now been transformed into his implacable enemy.

There was not much to learn. The chevalier was most anxious to know with whom he had fought a duel.,They had scarcely taken leave of each other before the Chevalier de Beauvoisis had enquiries made.

"Ses yeux exprimaient le feu de la conscience et le mépris des vains jugements des hommes; ils rencontrèrent ceux de Mlle de La Mole tout près de lui, et ce mépris, loin de se changer en air gracieux et civil, sembla redoubler.","His eyes expressed the fire of conscience and contempt for the vain judgments of men; they met those of Mademoiselle de La Mole very close to him, and this contempt, far from changing into a gracious and civil air, seemed to redouble.","His glance glowed with moral fire, and with contempt for men’s senseless decisions. His eyes met those of Mademoiselle de La Mole, so extremely close by, and his contempt, far from shifting to graciousness and civility, became even stronger.","His eyes expressed the fire of his own conscience; they met the eyes of Mademoiselle de la Mole who was close by him, and their contempt, so far from changing into politeness, seemed to redouble."
"Mais laissons ce petit homme à ses petites craintes pourquoi a-t-il pris dans sa maison un homme de coeur tandis qu’il lui fallait l’âme d’un valet? Que ne sait-il choisir ses gens? La marche ordinaire du XIXe siècle est que, quand un être puissant et noble rencontre un homme de coeur, il le tue, l’exile, l’emprisonne ou l’humilie tellement, que l’autre a la sottise d’en mourir de douleur. Par hasard ici, ce n’est pas encore l’homme de coeur qui souffre. Le grand malheur des petites villes de France et des gouvernements par élections comme celui de New York, c’est de ne pas pouvoir oublier qu’il existe au monde des êtres comme M. de Rênal. Au milieu d’une ville de vingt mille habitants, ces hommes font l’opinion publique, et l’opinion publique est terrible dans un pays qui a la charte. Un homme doué d’une âme noble, généreuse, et qui eût été votre ami, mais qui habite à cent lieues, juge de vous par l’opinion publique de votre ville, laquelle est faite par les sots que le hasard a fait naître nobles, riches et modérés. Malheur à qui se distingue.","But let's leave this little man to his little fears why did he take into his house a man of heart when he needed the soul of a valet? Why does he not know how to choose his people? The ordinary course of the nineteenth century is that, when a powerful and noble being meets a man of heart, he kills him, exiles him, imprisons him or humiliates him so much that the other is foolish enough to die of it. pain. By chance here, it is not yet the man of heart who suffers. The great misfortune of the small towns of France and of governments by elections like that of New York, is not being able to forget that there exist in the world beings like M. de Rênal. In the midst of a city of twenty thousand inhabitants, these men form public opinion, and public opinion is terrible in a country which has the charter. A man endowed with a noble, generous soul, and who would have been your friend, but who lives a hundred leagues away, judges you by the public opinion of your city, which is made by the fools whom chance has given birth to nobles. , rich and moderate. Woe to him who stands out.","But let’s leave this petty man and his petty fears: Why did he bring a man of spirit into his house, when what he needed was someone with a servant’s heart? Why doesn’t he know how to pick people? The usual procedure in the nineteenth century is that, meeting a man of spirit, a powerful nobleman promptly kills him, exiles him, throws him into prison, or so humiliates him that he commits stupid acts and, deep in sorrow, dies for them. Here, by accident, it’s still not the man of spirit who’s been suffering. The great misfortune of France’s small towns, and of places governed by elections (like New York), is that they can’t escape from people like Monsieur de Rênal. In a city of twenty thousand inhabitants, it’s these men who shape public opinion, and public opinion is a frightful thing in a country that has a constitution. A noble-souled, generous man who ought to be your friend, but who lives five hundred miles away, judges you by the public opinion of your city, which is formulated by fools to whom chance has granted noble birth, making them rich and safely moderate. But woe to the man who stands out from the rest!","Let us leave this petty man to his petty fears; why did he take a man of spirit into his household when he needed someone with the soul of a valet? Why can’t he select his staff? The ordinary trend of the nineteenth century is that when a noble and powerful individual encounters a man of spirit, he kills him, exiles him and imprisons him, or so humiliates him that the other is foolish enough to die of grief. In this country it so happens that it is not merely the man of spirit who suffers. The great misfortunes of the little towns of France and of representative governments, like that of New York, is that they find it impossible to forget the existence of individuals like M. de Rênal. It is these men who make public opinion in a town of twenty thousand inhabitants, and public opinion is terrible in a country which has a charter of liberty. A man, though of a naturally noble and generous disposition, who would have been your friend in the natural course of events, but who happens to live a hundred leagues off, judges you by the public opinion of your town which is made by those fools who have chanced to be born noble, rich and conservative. Unhappy is the man who distinguishes himself."
"— Quoi! pour M. de Caylus aussi! s’écria Julien; et toute l’amère jalousie d’un amant délaissé éclatait dans ce mot. Mathilde en jugea ainsi, et n’en fut point offensée.","- What! for M. de Caylus too! cried Julien; and all the bitter jealousy of a neglected lover burst forth in that word. Mathilde thought so, and was not offended.","“No! For Monsieur de Caylus too!” Julien exclaimed, all the bitter jealousy of a discarded lover ringing in his words. That was how Mathilde took it, and was not a bit offended.","“What! M. de Caylus as well!” exclaimed Julien, and all the jealousy of a discarded lover burst out in those words. Mathilde thought as much, but did not feel at all insulted."

"Julien vit avec étonnement cet abbé ouvrir hardiment la lettre adressée à l’évêque. La belle figure du grand vicaire exprima bientôt une surprise mêlée de vif plaisir, et redoubla de gravité. Pendant qu’il lisait, Julien, frappé de sa bonne mine, eut le temps de l’examiner. Cette figure eût eu plus de gravité sans la finesse extrême qui apparaissait dans certains traits, et qui fût allée jusqu’à dénoter la fausseté si le possesseur de ce beau visage eût cessé un instant de s’en occuper. Le nez très avancé formait une seule ligne parfaitement droite, et donnait par malheur à un profil, fort distingué d’ailleurs, une ressemblance irrémédiable avec la physionomie d’un renard. Du reste, cet abbé qui paraissait si occupé de la démission de M. Pirard, était mis avec une élégance qui plut beaucoup à Julien, et qu’il n’avait jamais vue à aucun prêtre.","Julien saw with astonishment this abbé boldly open the letter addressed to the bishop. The handsome face of the vicar-general soon expressed surprise mingled with lively pleasure, and redoubled in gravity. While he was reading, Julien, struck by his good looks, had time to examine him. This face would have had more gravity had it not been for the extreme delicacy that appeared in certain features, and which would have gone so far as to denote falsity if the possessor of this beautiful face had ceased for a moment to concern himself with it. The very prominent nose formed a single perfectly straight line, and unfortunately gave to a profile, very distinguished moreover, an irremediable resemblance to the physiognomy of a fox. Besides, this abbé, who seemed so preoccupied with the resignation of M. Pirard, was dressed with an elegance which pleased Julien very much, and which he had never seen in any priest.","Julien watched, astonished, as this priest boldly opened a letter addressed to the bishop. The vicar-general’s handsome face first expressed surprise, mixed with lively pleasure, and then became extremely somber. While he was reading, Julien—struck by his fine appearance—had the time to consider him more carefully. His face might have seemed a good deal more sober, had it not been for the sharp keenness notable in certain of its features, so marked that they would have been an indication of duplicity, if the possessor of so handsome an appearance had ever, even for an instant, stopped thinking of himself. His nose, quite prominent, was shaped in an unbroken straight line, creating a profile—though otherwise eminently distinguished—unfortunately and irremediably like that of a fox. For the rest, this ecclesiastic, who seemed so utterly absorbed in Father Pirard’s letter of resignation, was dressed with an elegance that Julien found most attractive, and that he had never seen on any other priest.","Julien was astonished to see this Abbé boldly open the letter which was addressed to the Bishop. The face of the Grand Vicar soon expressed surprise, tinged with a lively pleasure, and became twice as grave as before. Julien, struck with his good appearance, found time to scrutinise him while he was reading. This face would have possessed more dignity had it not been for the extreme subtlety which appeared in some features, and would have gone to the fact of actually denoting falseness if the possessor of this fine countenance had ceased to school it for a single minute. The very prominent nose formed a perfectly straight line and unfortunately gave to an otherwise distinguished profile, a curious resemblance to the physiognomy of a fox. Otherwise this Abbé, who appeared so engrossed with Monsieur Pirard’s resignation, was dressed with an elegance which Julien had never seen before in any priest and which pleased him exceedingly."
"Sur le premier plan parurent des intrigues très compliquées ourdies, depuis deux ans, auprès du préfet de Besançon. Elles étaient appuyées par des lettres venues de Paris, et écrites par ce qu’il y a de plus illustre. Il s’agissait de faire de M. de Moirod, c’était l’homme le plus dévot du pays, le premier, et non pas le second adjoint du maire de Verrières.","In the foreground appeared very complicated intrigues hatched for two years with the prefect of Besançon. They were supported by letters from Paris, and written by the most illustrious. It was a question of making M. de Moirod, he was the most devout man in the country, the first, and not the second, deputy to the mayor of Verrières.","To begin with, there were complex machinations, set in motion two years earlier by the governor at Besançon. These had the support of letters from Paris, written by men at the very highest levels. It was all about arranging for Monsieur de Moirod—the most pious man in the whole region—to be the first (not the second, but the first) deputy to the mayor of Verrières.","In the first place there were the very complicated intrigues which had been woven for the last two years around the prefect of Besançon. They were backed up by letters from Paris, written by the cream of the aristocracy.

"Mais à quoi bon nommer ses amis, ses ennemis? Tout cela est laid, et d’autant plus laid que le dessein est plus vrai. Ce sont cependant là les seuls professeurs de morale qu’ait le peuple, et sans eux que deviendrait-il? Le journal pourra-t-il jamais remplacer le curé?","But why name his friends, his enemies? All this is ugly, and all the more ugly the truer the design. These are, however, the only moral teachers the people have, and without them what would become of them? Will the newspaper ever be able to replace the priest?","What does it accomplish, mentioning his friends, his enemies? It’s all incredibly ugly, and uglier still because the picture is entirely true. Yet for ordinary people, these men are the only teachers of morality they possess—and without those men, what would happen to ordinary people? Can the newspaper ever replace the parish priest?","But what is the good of enumerating his friends and his enemies? The whole business is squalid, and all the more squalid in proportion to the truth of the picture. And yet the clergy supply the only teachers of morals which the people have. What would happen to the people without them? Will the paper ever replace the curé?"

"La cloche du déjeuner eut grand’peine à l’éveiller, il parut à la salle à manger. Bientôt après Mathilde y entra.

"— J’ai envie de pousser l’expérience jusqu’au bout, répondit le marquis. L’abbé Pirard prétend que nous avons tort de briser l’amour-propre des gens que nous admettons auprès de nous.

You can only push against something that pushes back, etc. The young man is unseemly only because his is not a face with which we are familiar.

"Julien mit tellement les auditeurs à leur aise sur son infortune, qu’à la fin du dîner, lorsque la conversation générale eut pris un autre cours, Mlle Mathilde faisait des questions à son frère sur les détails de l’événement malheureux. Ses questions se prolongeant, et Julien rencontrant ses yeux plusieurs fois, il osa répondre directement, quoiqu’il ne fût pas interrogé, et tous trois finirent par rire, comme auraient pu faire trois jeunes habitants d’un village au fond d’un bois.","Julien made the listeners so comfortable about his misfortune that at the end of dinner, when the general conversation had taken another course, Mademoiselle Mathilde asked her brother questions about the details of the unfortunate event. His questions continuing, and Julien meeting his eyes several times, he dared to answer directly, although he was not questioned, and all three ended up laughing, as three young inhabitants of a village deep in the woods might have done. .","Julien made those who heard him feel so comfortable about his mishap that, when dinner was over, and the general conversation had taken a different direction, Mademoiselle Mathilde put more questions to her brother about the unlucky occasion. Her questions were elaborate, and took a very long time to deal with. Julien several times made eye contact with her and did not hesitate, though he had not been directly queried, to give her plain replies, and all three of them, in the end, were laughing, just like three young villagers in the woods.","Julien put his listeners so thoroughly at their ease over his misfortune that at the end of the dinner, when the general conversation had gone off on to another subject, Mademoiselle Mathilde asked her brother some questions over the details of the unfortunate occurrence. As she put numerous questions, and as Julien met her eyes several times, he ventured to answer himself, although the questions had not been addressed to him, and all three of them finished up by laughing just as though they had all been inhabitants of some village in the depths of a forest."
"La conversation fut infinie entre les deux amis. Julien changea de couleur, lorsque Fouqué lui dit:",The conversation was endless between the two friends.

"Ces yeux n’exprimeront bientôt que le plus froid dédain, se dit Julien, si je me laisse entraîner au bonheur de l’aimer. Cependant, d’une voix éteinte et avec des paroles qu’elle avait à peine la force d’achever, elle lui répétait, en ce moment l’assurance de tous ses regrets pour des démarches que trop d’orgueil avait pu conseil.","Those eyes will soon express only the coldest disdain, thought Julien, if I allow myself to be carried away by the happiness of loving him. However, in a faint voice and with words which she had hardly the strength to finish, she repeated to him, at this moment, the assurance of all her regrets for steps which too much pride had been able to advise.","“Soon,” he said to himself, “these eyes will express nothing but cold disdain, if I let the happiness of loving her carry me away.” Meanwhile, her voice weak, and in words she was barely able to articulate, in this moment of reassurance she repeated her regret for everything her excessive pride had led her to do.","“Those eyes will soon express nothing but the coldest disdain,” said Julien to himself, “if I allow myself to be swept away by the happiness of loving her.” She, however, kept repeatedly assuring him at this moment, in a hushed voice, and in words which she had scarcely the strength to finish, of all her remorse for those steps which her inordinate pride had dictated."

Julien's confessor, Jansenist as he was, was not sheltered from an intrigue of the Jesuits, and, unwittingly, became their instrument.","Two things occurred to trouble this peaceful existence.

"Je pourrais être veuve, grand Dieu! pensa Mme de Rênal. Mais presque au même instant, elle se dit: Si je n’empêche pas ce duel, comme certainement je le puis, je serai la meurtrière de mon mari.","I could be a widow, good God! thought Madame de Rênal. But almost at the same moment she said to herself: If I do not prevent this duel, as I certainly can, I shall be my husband's murderer.","“I might become a widow, good Lord!” thought Madame de Rênal. But at almost the same moment, she told herself: “If I don’t stop this duel, as I certainly can, I’ll be my husband’s murderer.”","“Great Heavens!

"Dans le temps qu’il se croyait méprisé de Mathilde, Julien était devenu l’un des hommes les mieux mis de Paris. Mais encore avait-il un avantage sur les gens de cette espèce; une fois sa toilette arrangée, il n’y songeait plus.","In the days when he thought he was despised by Mathilde, Julien had become one of the best-dressed men in Paris. But still he had an advantage over people of this species; once his toilette had been arranged, he no longer thought of it.","While Mathilde had so totally scorned him, Julien had become one of the best-dressed men in Paris. But he still had an advantage over men of that sort: once he was dressed, he thought no more about it.","During the period when he thought himself scorned by Mathilde, Julien had become one of the best dressed men in Paris. He had, moreover, a further advantage over other dandies, inasmuch as once he had finished dressing, he never gave a further thought to his appearance."
"Ce mot fut dit avec bonheur. Il y avait une fermeté qui cherche à s’environner de politesse; il décida M. de Rênal. Mais, suivant l’habitude de la province, il parla encore pendant longtemps, revint sur tous les arguments, sa femme le laissait dire, il y avait encore de la colère dans son accent. Enfin deux heures de bavardage inutile épuisèrent les forces d’un homme qui avait subi un accès de colère de toute une nuit. Il fixa la ligne de conduite qu’il allait suivre envers M. Valenod, Julien et même Élisa.","This word was said with happiness. There was a firmness that seeks to surround itself with politeness; he decided M. de Renal. But, as is the custom in the provinces, he spoke for a long time, returned to all the arguments, his wife let him say it, there was still anger in his accent. Finally, two hours of useless chatter exhausted the strength of a man who had suffered an all-night fit of anger. He fixed the line of conduct he was going to follow towards M. Valenod, Julien and even Élisa.","She phrased it masterfully, displaying a steadiness that was acting as if it were struggling to wrap itself in politeness. It was decisive for Monsieur de Rênal. Still, observing country procedures, he went on talking for a long time, reviewing all the arguments; his wife allowed him to talk: there was still anger in his voice. In the end, two hours of pointless jabbering exhausted the strength of a man who had been dealing with anger the whole night. He settled the approach he would take to Monsieur Valenod, to Julien, and even to Elisa.","These words proved a lucky shot. They possessed a firmness which endeavoured to clothe itself with courtesy. It decided M. de Rênal, but following the provincial custom, he still thought for a long time, and went again over all his arguments; his wife let him speak. There was still a touch of anger in his intonation. Finally two hours of futile rant exhausted the strength of a man who had been subject during the whole night to a continuous fit of anger. He determined on the line of conduct he was going to follow with regard to M. Valenod, Julien and even Elisa."
"En approchant de son usine, le père Sorel appela Julien de sa voix de stentor, personne ne répondit. Il ne vit que ses fils aînés, espèces de géants qui, armés de lourdes haches, équarrissaient les troncs de sapin, qu’ils allaient porter à la scie. Tout occupés à suivre exactement la marque noire tracée sur la pièce de bois, chaque coup de leur hache en séparait des copeaux énormes. Ils n’entendirent pas la voix de leur père. Celui-ci se dirigea vers le hangar en y entrant, il chercha vainement Julien à la place qu’il aurait dû occuper, à côté de la scie. Il l’aperçut à cinq ou six pieds plus haut, à cheval sur l’une des pièces de la toiture. Au lieu de surveiller attentivement l’action de tout le mécanisme, Julien lisait. Rien n’était plus antipathique au vieux Sorel; il eût peut-être pardonné à Julien sa taille mince peu propre aux travaux de force, et si différente de celle de ses aînés; mais cette manie de lecture lui était odieuse, il ne savait pas lire lui-même.","Approaching his factory, Father Sorel called Julien in his stentorian voice, no one answered. He saw only his eldest sons, sort of giants who, armed with heavy axes, were squaring up the fir trunks, which they were going to carry to the saw. Engrossed in following exactly the black mark traced on the piece of wood, each blow of their ax separated enormous shavings. They did not hear their father's voice. The latter walked towards the shed on entering it, he looked in vain for Julien at the place he should have occupied, next to the saw. He saw her five or six feet higher up, astride one of the pieces of the roof. Instead of carefully watching the action of the whole mechanism, Julien was reading. Nothing was more antipathetic to old Sorel; he would perhaps have forgiven Julien for his slender build, unfit for hard work, and so different from that of his elders; but this mania for reading was odious to him, he did not know how to read himself.","Walking over to his factory, Père Sorel bellowed for Julien; there was no response. All he could see were his older sons, giantlike fellows who, armed with heavy axes, were squaring up fir-tree trunks, then lugging them to the saw. Completely occupied with following exactly the black line drawn on the wood, with each swing of the axe they would pare away enormous chips. They could not hear their father’s voice. Sorel went into the shed and looked in vain for his youngest son, in the spot next to the saw where he was supposed to be. He found him, finally, five or six feet higher up, sitting on one of the roof beams. Instead of carefully watching over the working of the machinery, Julien was reading. For old Sorel, nothing could have been more objectionable; he might have forgiven Julien his small size, hardly suited for hard labor, and utterly unlike his older brothers, but he himself could not read, and this mania for reading was repulsive to him.","Approaching his workshop, Father Sorel called Julien in his stentorian voice; nobody answered. He only saw his giant elder sons, who, armed with heavy axes, were cutting up the pine planks which they had to carry to the saw. They were engrossed in following exactly the black mark traced on each piece of wood, from which every blow of their axes threw off enormous shavings. They did not hear their father’s voice. The latter made his way towards the shed. He entered it and looked in vain for Julien in the place where he ought to have been by the side of the saw. He saw him five or six feet higher up, sitting astride one of the rafters of the roof. Instead of watching attentively the action of the machinery, Julien was reading. Nothing was more antipathetic to old Sorel. He might possibly have forgiven Julien his puny physique, ill adapted as it was to manual labour, and different as it was from that of his elder brothers; but he hated this reading mania. He could not read himself."
"Un instant après, Julien se retrouva vis-à-vis M. de Rênal:","A moment later, Julien found himself face to face with M. de Rênal:","The next minute, Julien came back into the room:",A minute afterwards Julien found himself opposite M. de Rênal.

"Les grandes chaleurs arrivèrent. On prit l’habitude de passer les soirées sous un immense tilleul à quelques pas de la maison. L’obscurité y était profonde.

"Et sa physionomie trahissait ce mépris, qui n’en est que plus piquant, parce qu’on voit que la politesse s’impose le devoir de le cacher.","And his countenance betrayed this contempt, which is all the more piquant, because one sees that politeness imposes on itself the duty of concealing it.","And his face showed his scorn, which was no less barbed because it was obvious that politeness obliged him to mask it.","“Thought is lacking,” answered Altamira, and his face betrayed that contempt which is only more deadly from the very fact that a manifest effort is being made to hide it as a matter of politeness."
"Où est la vérité? Dans la religion… Oui, ajouta-t-il avec le sourire amer du plus extrême mépris, dans la bouche des Maslon, des Frilair, des Castanède… Peut-être dans le vrai christianisme, dont les prêtres ne seraient pas plus payés que les apôtres ne l’ont été?… Mais saint Paul fut payé par le plaisir de commander, de parler, de faire parler de soi…","Where is the truth?

"Ils ont faim peut-être en ce moment, se dit-il à lui-même; sa gorge se serra, il lui fut impossible de manger et presque de parler. Ce fut bien pis un quart d’heure après, on entendant de loin en loin quelques accents d’une chanson populaire et, il faut l’avouer, un peu ignoble, que chantait l’un des reclus. M. Valenod regarda un de ses gens en grande livrée, qui disparut, et bientôt on n’entendit plus chanter. Dans ce moment, un valet offrait à Julien du vin du Rhin, dans un verre vert, et Mme Valenod avait soin de lui faire observer que ce vin coûtait neuf francs la bouteille pris sur place. Julien, tenant son verre vert, dit à M. Valenod:","They may be hungry right now, he said to himself; his throat constricted, it was impossible for him to eat and almost to speak. It was much worse a quarter of an hour later, we heard from time to time some accents of a popular song and, it must be admitted, a little ignoble, which one of the recluses was singing. M. Valenod looked at one of his people in full livery, who disappeared, and soon no more singing was heard. At this moment a valet was offering Julien some Rhine wine in a green glass, and Madame Valenod was careful to point out to him that this wine cost nine francs a bottle taken on the spot. Julien, holding his green glass, said to M. Valenod:","His throat tightened. He could not eat and almost could not speak. It grew worse a quarter of an hour later: they could hear, as if from a distance, phrases from a popular song—more than a little vulgar, it must be admitted—being sung by one of the shut-in poor. Monsieur Valenod glanced at one of his people, wearing full livery, who disappeared; soon they heard no more singing. Just then, a servant brought Julien Rhine wine, in a green glass, and Madame Valenod took pains to explain that this cost nine francs a bottle, if bought locally. Julien accepted his green glass and said to Monsieur Valenod:","He found it impossible to eat and almost impossible to speak. Matters became much worse a quarter of an hour afterwards; they heard in the distance some refrains of a popular song that was, it must be confessed, a little vulgar, which was being sung by one of the inmates. M. Valenod gave a look to one of his liveried servants who disappeared and soon there was no more singing to be heard. At that moment a valet offered Julien some Rhine wine in a green glass and Madame Valenod made a point of asking him to note that this wine cost nine francs a bottle in the market. Julien held up his green glass and said to M. Valenod,"
"Ce jugement conjugal était raisonnable. Le maire de Verrières devait une réputation d’esprit et surtout de bon ton à une demi-douzaine de plaisanteries dont il avait hérité d’un oncle. Le vieux capitaine de Rênal servait avant la Révolution dans le régiment d’infanterie de M. le duc d’Orléans, et, quand il allait à Paris, était admis dans les salons du prince. Il y avait vu Mme de Montesson, la fameuse Mme de Genlis, M. Ducrest, l’inventeur du Palais-Roval. Ces personnages ne reparaissaient que trop souvent dans les anecdotes de M. de Rênal. Mais peu à peu ce souvenir de choses aussi délicates à raconter était devenu un travail pour lui, et depuis quelque temps, il ne répétait que dans les grandes occasions ses anecdotes relatives à la maison d’Orléans. Comme il était d’ailleurs fort poli, excepté lorsqu’on parlait d’argent, il passait, avec raison, pour le personnage le plus aristocratique de Verrières.","This marital judgment was reasonable. The mayor of Verrières owed a reputation for wit and above all good taste to half a dozen jokes he had inherited from an uncle. The old Captain de Rênal served before the Revolution in the infantry regiment of the Duc d'Orléans, and when he went to Paris he was admitted to the prince's salons. He had seen Mme de Montesson, the famous Mme de Genlis, M. Ducrest, the inventor of the Palais-Roval. These characters reappeared only too often in M. de Rênal's anecdotes. But little by little this memory of things so delicate to tell had become a job for him, and for some time past he had only repeated on special occasions his anecdotes relating to the house of Orleans. As he was, moreover, very polite, except when it came to money, he passed, with good reason, for the most aristocratic personage in Verrières.","Nor was this marital opinion an irrational one. His Honor the Mayor of Verrières owed his reputation for wit and, above all, for good breeding to half a dozen jokes he had inherited from an uncle.

There, he had seen Madame de Montesson, the celebrated Madame de Genlis, and Monsieur Ducrest, who had redesigned the Royal Palace. These personages kept popping up, over and over, in Monsieur de Rênal’s stories. But little by little this echo of events exceedingly ticklish in the telling became laborsome for him, and after a time he repeated his anecdotes about the House of Orléans only on great occasions. Besides, since he was extremely polite, except when the topic was money, he was very properly thought of as the most aristocratic person in all Verrières.","This conjugal opinion was quite sound. The Mayor of Verrières had a reputation for wit, and above all, a reputation for good form, on the strength of a half-a-dozen “chestnuts” which he had inherited from an uncle.

He had seen Madame de Montesson, the famous Madame de Genlis, M. Ducret, the inventor, of the Palais-Royal. These personages would crop up only too frequently in M. de Rênal’s anecdotes. He found it, however, more and more of a strain to remember stories which required such delicacy in the telling, and for some time past it had only been on great occasions that he would trot out his anecdotes concerning the House of Orleans. As, moreover, he was extremely polite, except on money matters, he passed, and justly so, for the most aristocratic personage in Verrières."

Her conscience and her pride impelled her to ask, for a young girl, a truly extraordinary question.","“Yes,” he was saying to Comte Altamira as he passed by her, “Danton was a real man.” “Heavens, can he be a Danton?” said Mathilde to herself, “but he has so noble a face, and that Danton was so horribly ugly, a butcher I believe.” Julien was still fairly near her. She did not hesitate to call him; she had the consciousness and the pride of putting a question that was unusual for a young girl."
"«Je ne paraîtrai point le jour du jugement monsieur parce que ma présence pourrait jeter de la défaveur sur la cause de M. Sorel. Je ne désire qu’une chose au monde et avec passion, c’est qu’il soit sauvé. N’en doutez point, l’affreuse idée qu’à cause de moi un innocent a été conduit à la mort empoisonnerait le reste de ma vie et sans doute l’abrégerait. Comment pourriez-vous le condamner à mort, tandis que moi je vis? Non, sans doute, la société n’a point le droit d’arracher la vie, et surtout à un être tel que Julien Sorel. Tout le monde, à Verrières, lui a connu des moments d’égarement. Ce pauvre jeune homme a des ennemis puissants; mais, même parmi ses ennemis (et combien n’en a-t-il pas!) quel est celui qui met en doute ses admirables talents et sa science profonde? Ce n’est pas un sujet ordinaire que vous allez juger, monsieur. Durant près de dix-huit mois, nous l’avons tous connu pieux, sage, appliqué; mais, deux ou trois fois par an, il était saisi par des accès de mélancolie qui allaient jusqu’à l’égarement. Toute la ville de Verrières, tous nos voisins de Vergy où nous passons la belle saison, ma famille entière, M. le sous-préfet lui-même, rendront justice à sa piété exemplaire; il sait par coeur toute la sainte Bible. Un impie se fût-il appliqué pendant des années à apprendre le livre saint? Mes fils auront l’honneur de vous présenter cette lettre: ce sont des enfants. Daignez les interroger, monsieur, ils vous donneront sur ce pauvre jeune homme tous les détails qui seraient encore nécessaires pour vous convaincre de la barbarie qu’il y aurait à le condamner. Bien loin de me venger, vous me donneriez la mort.","“I will not appear on the day of the judgment sir because my presence could throw disfavor on the cause of Mr. Sorel. I only want one thing in the world and with passion, and that is for him to be saved. Do not doubt it, the dreadful idea that because of me an innocent man was led to death would poison the rest of my life and would doubtless shorten it. How could you condemn him to death, while I live? No, no doubt, society has no right to snatch life, and especially from a being such as Julien Sorel. Everyone at Verrières has experienced moments of bewilderment. This poor young man has powerful enemies; but, even among his enemies (and how many does he not have!) who doubts his admirable talents and his profound knowledge? It's no ordinary subject you're going to judge, sir. For nearly eighteen months, we all knew him pious, wise, diligent; but, two or three times a year, he was seized by fits of melancholy which went as far as bewilderment. The whole town of Verrières, all our neighbors in Vergy where we spend the summer, my whole family, the sub-prefect himself, will do justice to his exemplary piety; he knows the whole Holy Bible by heart. Would an impious person have applied himself for years to learning the holy book? My sons will have the honor of presenting this letter to you: they are children. Deign to question them, sir, they will give you about this poor young man all the details that would still be necessary to convince you of the barbarism that would be involved in condemning him. Far from avenging me, you would kill me.","I will not appear at the trial, sir, because my presence might prejudice Monsieur Sorel’s case. There is only one thing in the world I passionately desire, which is that he be saved. Please be in no doubt: the frightful idea that, because of me, an innocent man has been consigned to death, would poison the rest of my life and, without any doubt, would shorten it. How could you condemn him to death, while I live on? No, surely society has no right to strip away life, and above all the life of someone like Julien Sorel. Everyone in Verrières has known some of his wilder moments. This poor young man has many powerful enemies, but even among his enemies (and how many of them there are!) is there anyone who doubts his wonderful gifts and his profound learning? This is not an ordinary citizen, sir, the man on whom you will be passing judgment. For nearly eighteen months we have all known him to be pious, wise, hardworking. Yet two or three times a year, he was overtaken by fits of melancholy that approached aberration. The whole town of Verrières, all our neighbors at Vergy, where we spend our summers, our whole family, and the deputy governor of the district himself, will affirm his exemplary piety: he knows the Holy Bible by heart. Would anyone lacking in piety have worked so hard, over the years, to memorize the holy book? My sons will have the honor of bringing you this letter: they are children. Take the trouble to question them, sir: they will give you whatever details, about this poor young man, that might yet be needed to convince you of how barbarous it would be to convict him. Far from revenging me, you would be killing me.","“I shall not appear on the day of the trial, Monsieur, because my presence might be prejudicial to M. Sorel’s case. I only desire one thing in the world, and that I desire passionately—for him to be saved. Have no doubt about it, the awful idea that I am the cause of an innocent man being led to his death would poison the rest of my life and would no doubt curtail it. How can you condemn him to death while I continue to live? No, there is no doubt about it, society has no right to take away a man’s life, and above all, the life of a being like Julien Sorel. Everyone at Verrières knew that there were moments when he was quite distracted. This poor young man has some powerful enemies, but even among his enemies, (and how many has he not got?) who is there who casts any doubt on his admirable talents and his deep knowledge? The man whom you are going to try, Monsieur, is not an ordinary person. For a period of nearly eighteen months we all knew him as a devout and well-behaved student. Two or three times in the year he was seized by fits of melancholy that went to the point of distraction. The whole town of Verrières, all our neighbours at Vergy, where we live in the fine weather, my whole family, and monsieur the sub-prefect himself will render justice to his exemplary piety. He knows all the Holy Bible by heart. Would a blasphemer have spent years of study in learning the Sacred Book? My sons will have the honour of presenting you with this letter; they are children. Be good enough to question them, Monsieur, they will give you all the details concerning this poor young man which are necessary to convince you of how barbarous it would be to condemn him. Far from revenging me, you would be putting me to death."

"Ah! c’est un bon mot que je viens de me dire! quel dommage qu’il ne soit pas venu de façon à m’en faire honneur. Mathilde avait trop de goût pour amener dans la conversation un bon mot fait d’avance, mais elle avait aussi trop de vanité pour ne pas être enchantée d’elle-même. Un air de bonheur remplaça dans ses traits l’apparence de l’ennui. Le marquis de Croisenois, qui lui parlait toujours, crut entrevoir le succès, et redoubla de faconde.","Ah! That's a good word I just said to myself! what a pity that he did not come in such a way as to do me honor. Mathilde had too much taste to bring a good word made in advance into the conversation, but she also had too much vanity not to be enchanted with herself. An air of happiness replaced in his features the appearance of boredom. The Marquis de Croisenois, who was still talking to him, thought he saw success, and redoubled his boldness.","“Ah! What I just said to myself was indeed very well said! What a pity it didn’t pop out when it could have earned me a reputation!” She had too much taste to toss a prefabricated witticism into a conversation, but she also had too much vanity not to be delighted at herself. An expression of pleasure replaced that of boredom. Marquis de Croisenois, who had gone on talking to her, felt he was being successful, and his glibness was heightened.","“It is the only thing which cannot be bought.” “Why, that’s an epigram I just said; what a pity it did not come at a moment when I could have reaped all the credit for it.” Mathilde had too much taste to work into the conversation a prepared epigram but at the same time she was too vain not to be extremely pleased with herself. A happy expression succeeded the palpable boredom of her face. The Marquis de Croisenois, who had never left off talking, saw a chance of success and waxed twice as eloquent."

"Ce n’est pas M. de Rênal, pensa-t-il, il tire trop mal pour cela. Les chiens couraient en silence à ses côtés un second coup cassa apparemment la patte à un chien car il se mit à pousser des cris lamentables. Julien sauta le mur d’une terrasse, fit à couvert une cinquantaine de pas, et se remit à fuir dans une autre direction.

He heard voices calling back and forth, and he distinctly saw the valet, his enemy, firing a gun. A farmer fired, too, from the other side of the garden.

"Elle osa aller jusque chez le libraire de Verrières, malgré son affreuse réputation de libéralisme. Là, elle choisit pour dix louis de livres qu’elle donna à ses fils. Mais ces livres étaient ceux qu’elle savait que Julien désirait. Elle exigea que là, dans la boutique du libraire, chacun des enfants écrivît son nom sur les livres qui lui étaient échus en partage. Pendant que Mme de Rênal était heureuse de la sorte de réparation qu’elle avait l’audace de faire à Julien, celui-ci était étonné de la quantité de livres qu’il apercevait chez le libraire. Jamais il n’avait osé entrer en un lieu aussi profane; son coeur palpitait. Loin de songer à deviner ce qui se passait dans le coeur de Mme de Rênal, il rêvait profondément au moyen qu’il y aurait, pour un jeune étudiant en théologie, de se procurer quelques-uns de ces livres. Enfin il eut l’idée qu’il serait possible, avec de l’adresse, de persuader à M. de Rênal qu’il fallait donner pour sujet de thème à ses fils l’histoire des gentilshommes célèbres nés dans la province. Après un mois de soins, Julien vit réussir cette idée, et à un tel point, que, quelque temps après, il osa hasarder, en parlant à M. de Rênal, la mention d’une action bien autrement pénible pour le noble maire, il s’agissait de contribuer à la fortune d’un libéral, en prenant un abonnement chez le libraire. M. de Rênal convenait bien qu’il était sage de donner à son fils aîné l’idée de visu de plusieurs ouvrages qu’il entendrait mentionner dans la conversation, lorsqu’il serait à l’École militaire, mais Julien voyait M. le maire s’obstiner à ne pas aller plus loin. Il soupçonnait une raison secrète, mais ne pouvait la deviner.","She dared to go as far as the Verrieres bookseller, despite his frightful reputation for liberalism. There she chose for ten louis de livres which she gave to her sons. But these books were the ones she knew Julien wanted. She demanded that there, in the bookseller's shop, each of the children write his name on the books which had fallen to his share. While Madame de Rênal was happy with the kind of reparation she had the audacity to make to Julien, the latter was astonished at the quantity of books he saw at the bookseller's. Never had he dared to enter such a profane place; his heart was throbbing. Far from dreaming of guessing what was passing in Madame de Rênal's heart, he dreamed deeply of the means there would be for a young student of theology to procure some of these books. Finally he had the idea that it would be possible, with skill, to persuade M. de Rênal that his sons should be given the subject of the theme of the history of famous gentlemen born in the provinces. After a month of care, Julien saw this idea succeed, and to such an extent that, some time later, he dared to venture, in speaking to M. de Rênal, the mention of an action much more painful for the noble mayor, it was a question of contributing to the fortune of a liberal, by taking out a subscription at the bookseller. M. de Rênal agreed that it was wise to give his eldest son a first-hand idea of several works he would hear mentioned in conversation when he was at the Ecole Militaire, but Julien saw M. le mayor persist in not going any further. He suspected a secret reason, but could not guess it.","For all the frightfully liberal reputation of the store’s proprietor, she was courageous enough to walk, with Julien and her children, right into the bookstore in Verrières. There, she picked out, for two hundred and fifty francs, volumes which she gave to her sons. But these were books she knew Julien had been wanting. She required that, right there in the shop, the children inscribe their names in the volumes given them. Although Madame de Rênal was happy with the kind of amends she’d been able to make to Julien, he was astonished by the quantity of books he saw. He had never dared go into a place so profane; his heart beat wildly. Far from having any notion of what Madame de Rênal was feeling, he longed for a way that would allow him, as a young theology student, to obtain some of these books. And then he thought, if he did it skillfully, he might be able to persuade Monsieur de Rênal that he ought to set his sons, as a subject for the writing of themes, the lives of celebrated gentlemen born in the province. After a month of careful preparation, Julien worked out the idea, and to such a point that he risked raising, while speaking to Monsieur de Rênal, a matter which might well have been, in different circumstances, distressing to the noble mayor—namely, the notion of contributing to a liberal’s fortune by taking out a subscription at the bookstore. Monsieur de Rênal certainly agreed that it would be sensible to give his oldest son a visual impression of books he might hear mentioned in conversation, once he was attending military school. But Julien saw that His Honor the Mayor had dug in his heels and would go no further. Julien suspected some hidden reason, but could not imagine what it might be.","She dared to go as far as the shop of the bookseller of Verrières, in spite of his awful reputation for Liberalism. In the shop she chose ten louis worth of books for a present for her sons. But these books were those which she knew Julien was wanting. She insisted on each child writing his name then and there in the bookseller’s shop in those books which fell to his lot. While Madame de Rênal was rejoicing over the kind reparation which she had had the courage to make to Julien, the latter was overwhelmed with astonishment at the quantity of books which he saw at the bookseller’s. He had never dared to enter so profane a place. His heart was palpitating. Instead of trying to guess what was passing in Madame de Rênal’s heart he pondered deeply over the means by which a young theological student could procure some of those books. Eventually it occurred to him that it would be possible, with tact, to persuade M. de Rênal that one of the proper subjects of his sons’ curriculum would be the history of the celebrated gentlemen who had been born in the province. After a month of careful preparation Julien witnessed the success of this idea. The success was so great that he actually dared to risk mentioning to M. de Rênal in conversation, a matter which the noble mayor found disagreeable from quite another point of view. The suggestion was to contribute to the fortune of a Liberal by taking a subscription at the bookseller’s. M. de Rênal agreed that it would be wise to give his elder son a first hand acquaintance with many works which he would hear mentioned in conversation when he went to the Military School. But Julien saw that the mayor had determined to go no further. He suspected some secret reason but could not guess it."

She assumed without telling herself that between husband and wife there was no sweeter relationship. She especially loved M. de Rênal when he spoke to her of his plans for their children, one of whom he intended for the sword, the second for the magistracy, and the third for the Church. In short, she found M. de Rênal much less boring than all the men she knew.","This was, in short, an artless soul who had never so much as thought of passing judgment on her husband and admitting to herself that he bored her. It seemed to her, though not in so many words, that no relationship between husband and wife could be any better. She was especially fond of Monsieur de Rênal when he spoke to her about his plans for their children, the first of whom he meant to make a soldier, the second a judge, and the third a priest. That is, she found Monsieur de Rênal less boring than any other man she knew.","She was a naïve soul, who had never educated herself up to the point of judging her husband and confessing to herself that he bored her. She supposed, without actually formulating the thought, that there was no greater sweetness in the relationship between husband and wife than she herself had experienced. She loved M. de Rênal most when he talked about his projects for their children. The elder he had destined for the army, the second for the law, and the third for the Church. To sum up, she found M. de Rênal much less boring than all the other men of her acquaintance."
"Comme tous les êtres médiocres que le hasard met en présence des manoeuvres d’un grand général, Julien ne comprenait rien à l’attaque exécutée par le jeune Russe sur le coeur de la sévère Anglaise. Les quarante premières lettres n’étaient destinées qu’à se faire pardonner la hardiesse d’écrire. Il fallait faire contracter à cette douce personne, qui peut-être s’ennuyait infiniment, l’habitude de recevoir des lettres peut-être un peu moins insipides que sa vie de tous les jours.","Like all mediocre beings whom chance brings face to face with the maneuvers of a great general, Julien understood nothing of the attack executed by the young Russian on the heart of the severe Englishwoman. The first forty letters were only intended to make up for the boldness of writing. It was necessary to make this sweet person, who perhaps was infinitely bored, contract the habit of receiving letters perhaps a little less insipid than her everyday life.","Like all mediocre men, placed by chance amid the maneuvers of some great general, Julien understood nothing of the young Russian’s attack on the lovely English Quakeress. The only purpose of the first forty letters had been to excuse his boldness in daring to writing at all. It had been necessary to create, in this sweet young woman (who may well have become infinitely bored), the habit of receiving letters just a little less insipid, perhaps, than her everyday existence.","Like all mediocre individuals, who chance to come into contact with the manœuvres of a great general, Julien understood nothing of the attack executed by the young Russian on the heart of the young English girl. The only purpose of the first forty letters was to secure forgiveness for the boldness of writing at all. The sweet person, who perhaps lived a life of inordinate boredom, had to be induced to contract the habit of receiving letters, which were perhaps a little less insipid than her everyday life."

"Absorbé par ces idées sévères, le peu qu’il daignait comprendre des mots obligeants des deux amies lui déplaisait comme vide de sens, niais, faible, en un mot féminin.","Absorbed by these severe ideas, the little that he deigned to understand of the obliging words of the two friends displeased him as meaningless, silly, weak, in a word feminine.","Completely caught up in these fierce ideas, the kindly words of the two ladies—what little of them he bothered to make out—annoyed him: they were senseless, foolish, weak-minded and, in a word, feminine.","And absorbed as he was by these stern ideas, such few courteous words of his two friends as he deigned to take the trouble to understand, displeased him as devoid of sense, silly, feeble, in a word—feminine."
"C’est à la circonstance dont nous venons de parler que Julien dut l’humanité du geôlier de Verrières; c’était toujours ce M. Noiroud, ministériel parfait, auquel nous avons vu la présence de M. Appert faire une si belle peur.","It is to the circumstance of which we have just spoken that Julien owed the humanity of the jailer of Verrières; it was always this Mr. Noiroud, perfect ministerial, to whom we saw the presence of Mr. Appert frighten so much.","And this, which we have just been recounting, was responsible for the Verrières jailer’s humanity to Julien. This was, as ever, Monsieur Noiroud, the perfect bureaucrat, in whom we have seen Monsieur Appert’s presence strike such notable fear.","It was this circumstance, which we have just mentioned, that Julien had to thank for the humanity of the gaoler of Verrières. It was still the same M. Nolraud, that ideal official, whom he remembered as being so finely alarmed by M. Appert’s presence."
"Aujourd’hui, messieurs, ce n’est plus un homme qu’il faut immoler, c’est Paris. Toute la France copie Paris. A quoi bon armer vos cinq cents hommes par département? Entreprise hasardeuse et qui n’en finira pas. A quoi bon mêler la France à la chose qui est personnelle à Paris? Paris seul avec ses journaux et ses salons a fait le mal, que la nouvelle Babylone périsse.","Today, gentlemen, it is no longer a man who must be sacrificed, it is Paris. All of France copies Paris. What good is arming your five hundred men per department? A risky business that will never end. What is the use of involving France in the thing which is personal in Paris? Paris alone with its newspapers and its salons has done the harm, may the new Babylon perish.","“Today, gentlemen, it’s not a man we need to burn, but Paris. France follows Paris in everything. What good will it do to arm your five hundred men, in every administrative department? That’s a risky task, and it will be endless. Why entangle France in a matter which depends entirely on Paris? Paris alone, with its newspapers and its drawing rooms, has created the evil. Let this modern Babylon perish.","“To-day, gentlemen, it is not a man who has to be sacrificed, it is Paris. What is the use of arming your five hundred men in each department, a hazardous and interminable enterprise? What is the good of involving France in a matter which is personal to Paris?

"Au moment où Mme Derville renouvelait la proposition de rentrer au salon, Julien serra fortement la main qu’on lui abandonnait.","At the moment when Madame Derville renewed the proposal to return to the drawing-room, Julien shook firmly the hand which had been left to him.","Just as Madame Derville was again proposing a return to the drawing room, Julien gave a hard squeeze to the hand that had surrendered to him.","At the moment when Madame Derville was repeating her suggestion to go back to the salon, Julien squeezed vigourously the hand that was abandoned to him."
"Elle avait l’air de revenir de si loin, et cette question avait si peu de rapport avec tout ce que le pauvre marquis lui disait depuis cinq minutes, que son amabilité en fut déconcertée. C’était pourtant un homme d’esprit et fort renommé comme tel.","She seemed to have come from so far away, and this question had so little connection with all that the poor marquis had been telling her for five minutes, that her friendliness was disconcerted. He was, however, a man of wit and very renowned as such.","She seemed to be coming back from very far away, and this query had so little connection with everything the poor marquis had been saying to her, for the past five minutes, that his poise was shaken. But he was a man of spirit, and well known on that score.","Her thoughts seemed to have been so far away, and this question had so little connection with all that the poor marquis had been saying for the last five minutes, that his good temper was ruffled. He was nevertheless a man of wit and celebrated for being so."
"Par exemple, pour tout au monde, Mathilde n’aurait pas manqué la messe un dimanche; presque tous les jours elle y accompagnait sa mère. Si, dans le salon de l’hôtel de La Mole, quelque imprudent oubliait le lieu où il était et se permettait l’allusion la plus éloignée à une plaisanterie contre les intérêts vrais ou supposés du trône ou de l’autel, Mathilde devenait à l’instant d’un sérieux de glace. Son regard, qui était si piquant, reprenait toute la hauteur impassible d’un vieux portrait de famille.","For example, for all the world, Mathilde would not have missed mass on a Sunday; almost every day she accompanied her mother there. If, in the salon of the Hôtel de La Mole, some imprudent person forgot where he was and allowed himself the remotest allusion to a joke against the real or supposed interests of the throne or the altar, Mathilde became the moment of an icy seriousness. His gaze, which was so piquant, took on all the impassive loftiness of an old family portrait.","For example: Nothing could make Mathilde miss Sunday mass; she went to church with her mother virtually every day. If some careless fellow, in the de La Mole drawing room, happened to forget where he was and allowed himself even a distantly barbed remark about the true or pretended interests of either church or state, Mathilde immediately turned seriously icy. Her glance went from liveliness to all the impenetrable haughtiness of an old family portrait.","For instance, Mathilde would not have missed mass on Sunday for anything in the world. She accompanied her mother there nearly every time. If, when in the salon of the Hôtel de la Mole, some indiscreet man forgot where he was, and indulged in the remotest allusion to any jest against the real or supposed interests of Church or State, Mathilde immediately assumed an icy seriousness. Her previously arch expression re-assumed all the impassive haughtiness of an old family portrait."
"— Pardonnez-moi, reprit Julien; j’y ai été pour dîner une fois la semaine chez l’ambassadeur du roi, qui est le plus poli des hommes.","""Pardon me,"" resumed Julien; I have been there to dine once a week with the king's ambassador, who is the most polite of men.","“Excuse me,” replied Julien. “I had dinner every week at our ambassador’s home, and he is the most polite of men.”","“Pardon me,” answered Julien. “I went there to dine once a week with the King’s ambassador, who is the most polite of men.”"
"Le soir, au jardin, Mme Derville arrangea si bien les choses, qu’elle se trouva placée entre Mme de Rênal et Julien. Mme de Rênal qui s’était fait une image délicieuse du plaisir de serrer la main de Julien, et de la porter à ses lèvres, ne put pas même lui adresser un mot.","In the evening, in the garden, Madame Derville arranged things so well that she found herself placed between Madame de Rênal and Julien. Madame de Rênal, who had formed a delicious image of the pleasure of shaking Julien's hand and bringing it to her lips, could not even say a word to him.","In the garden that evening, Madame Derville managed things so well that she located herself between Madame de Rênal and Julien. Madame de Rênal, who’d been indulging in delightful anticipation of squeezing Julien’s hand, and bringing it to her lips, could not so much as speak a word to him.","Madame Derville arranged things so adroitly that evening in the garden, that she found herself placed between Madame de Rênal and Julien. Madame de Rênal, who had thought in her imagination how delicious it would be to press Julien’s hand and carry it to her lips, was not able to address a single word to him."
"Ce jour-là, après le déjeuner, comme Mme de La Mole lui demandait une brochure séditieuse et pourtant assez rare, que le matin son curé lui avait apportée en secret, Julien, en la prenant sur une console, fit tomber un vieux vase de porcelaine bleue, laid au possible.","That day, after lunch, as Madame de La Mole asked him for a seditious and yet rather rare pamphlet, which his priest had brought him in secret in the morning, Julien, taking it from a console table, dropped an old vase of blue porcelain, ugly as can be.","That day, after lunch, when Madame de La Mole was asking him for a seditious and distinctly rare pamphlet, brought to the library that morning by her parish priest, Julien knocked over an old vase, in blue porcelain, and almost inconceivably ugly.","The same day after breakfast Madame de la Mole asked him for a fairly rare, seditious pamphlet which her curé had surreptitiously brought her in the morning, and Julien, as he took it from a bracket, knocked over a blue porcelain vase which was as ugly as it could possibly be."
"— Ah! je te revois avant que de mourir, est-ce une illusion? s’écria-t-il en se jetant à ses pieds.","- Ah! I see you again before I die, is it an illusion? he cried, throwing himself at her feet.","“Ah! I’m seeing you before I die.

"«M. de La Vernaye serait à vos pieds, éperdu de reconnaissance, s’il savait tout ce que vous daignez faire pour lui.

"En l’écoutant parler, Mathilde était choquée de cet air de triomphe. Il est donc mon maître! se dit-elle. Déjà elle était en proie au remords. Sa raison avait horreur de l’insigne folie qu’elle venait de commettre. Si elle l’eût DU, elle eût anéanti elle et Julien. Quand, par instants la force de sa volonté faisait taire les remords, des sentiments de timidité et de pudeur souffrante la rendaient fort malheureuse. Elle n’avait nullement prévu l’état affreux où elle se trouvait.","Listening to him speak, Mathilde was shocked by this air of triumph. So he is my master! she says to herself. Already she was a prey to remorse. Her reason abhorred the flagrant madness she had just committed. If she had DU, she would have annihilated her and Julien.

She had no idea of the terrible state she was in.","Listening to him speak, Mathilde was shocked by his sense of triumph. “He’s already my master!” she told herself. She felt remorse gripping her; her rational mind was horrified by the remarkable act of madness she’d committed. Had she been able to, she would have annihilated both herself and Julien. When by sheer force of will she could momentarily beat back remorse, shyness and suffering modesty made her wretchedly miserable. She had had no idea of the frightful state in which she would find herself.","As she listened to him speaking, Mathilde was shocked by this air of triumph. “So he is my master,” she said to herself; she was already a prey to remorse. Her reason was horrified at the signal folly which she had just committed. If she had had the power she would have annihilated both herself and Julien. When for a few moments she managed by sheer will-power to silence her pangs of remorse, she was rendered very unhappy by her timidity and wounded shame. She had quite failed to foresee the awful plight in which she now found herself."

Adolphe, we could get the last of your people to take out a subscription at the bookseller.""","“In order to avoid such subjects as the triumph of the Jacobin party,” said the young tutor, “while in the meantime giving me information needed to reply to Monsieur Adolphe, perhaps we could have the very least of your people take out a bookstore subscription.”","“In order to prevent the Jacobin Party having the slightest pretext for a score,” said the young tutor, “and yet give me the means of answering M. de Adolphe ’s question, you can make your most menial servant take out a subscription at the booksellers.”"
"Julien pouvait espérer un évêché, si M. de La Mole arrivait au ministère; mais, à ses yeux, tous ces grands intérêts s’étaient comme recouverts d’un voile. Son imagination ne les apercevait plus que vaguement et pour ainsi dire dans le lointain. L’affreux malheur qui en faisait un maniaque lui montrait tous les intérêts de la vie dans sa manière d’être avec Mlle de La Mole. Il calculait qu’après cinq ou six ans de soins, il parviendrait à s’en faire aimer de nouveau.","Julien could hope for a bishopric if M. de La Mole arrived at the ministry; but, in his eyes, all these great interests were covered with a veil. His imagination no longer saw them except vaguely and, so to speak, in the distance.

He calculated that after five or six years of care, he would succeed in making himself loved again.","If Monsieur de La Mole became a minister, it might be possible for Julien to become a bishop, but for him all these large concerns could be glimpsed only as if through a veil. His mind mostly perceived them vaguely, at best, and as it were from a distance.

He had estimated that, after five or six years of trying, he would get her to love him again.","If M. de la Mole became a minister, Julien could hope for a bishopric: but all these important interests seemed to be veiled and hazy. His imagination only perceived them very vaguely, and so to speak, in the far distance.

"A Paris, la position de Julien envers Mme de Rênal eût été bien vite simplifiée; mais à Paris, l’amour est fils des romans. Le jeune précepteur et sa timide maîtresse auraient retrouvé dans trois ou quatre romans et jusque dans les couplets du Gymnase, l’éclaircissement de leur position. Les romans leur auraient tracé le rôle à jouer, montré le modèle à imiter, et ce modèle, tôt ou tard, et quoique sans nul plaisir, et peut-être en rechignant, la vanité eût forcé Julien à le suivre.","In Paris, Julien's position towards Madame de Rênal would have been quickly simplified; but in Paris, love is the child of novels. The young tutor and his timid mistress would have found in three or four novels and even in the verses of the Gymnase, the clarification of their position. The novels would have outlined for them the role to play, shown the model to imitate, and this model, sooner or later, and although without any pleasure, and perhaps reluctantly, vanity would have forced Julien to follow it.","In Paris, Julien’s position vis-à-vis Madame de Rênal would have been quickly resolved, but in Paris love is born out of the pages of romantic fiction. The young tutor and his shy mistress could have found enlightenment for themselves in three or four of these novels, and even in high school poetry. The novels would have outlined what roles to play, giving them models to imitate, and sooner or later, perhaps without much pleasure, and even sullenly, vanity would have compelled Julien to play out the game.","If the scene had been Paris, Julien’s position towards Madame de Rênal would have been soon simplified. But at Paris, love is a creature of novels.

The novels which have traced out for them the part they would play, and showed them the model which they were to imitate, and Julien would sooner or later have been forced by his vanity to follow that model, even though it had given him no pleasure and had perhaps actually gone against the grain."
"Ce moment fut le plus éprouvant de sa vie. Il lui était si facile de s’engager dans un des beaux régiments en garnison à Besançon!

"Ne soyez pas inquiet, ce ne sera point une conversation confuse, chacun parlera à son tour, je ne veux pas dire avec ordre, ajouta le marquis en reprenant l’air fin et léger qui lui était si naturel. Pendant que nous parlerons, vous écrirez une vingtaine de pages; vous reviendrez ici avec moi, nous réduirons ces vingt pages à quatre. Ce sont ces quatre pages que vous me réciterez demain matin, au lieu de tout le numéro de la Quotidienne. Vous partirez aussitôt après, il faudra courir la poste comme un jeune homme qui voyage pour ses plaisirs. Votre but sera de n’être remarqué de personne. Vous arriverez auprès d’un grand personnage. Là, il vous faudra plus d’adresse. Il s’agit de tromper tout ce qui l’entoure; car parmi ses secrétaires, parmi ses domestiques, il y a des gens vendus à nos ennemis, et qui guettent nos agents au passage pour les intercepter. Vous aurez une lettre de recommandation insignifiante.","Don't worry, it won't be a confused conversation, each one will speak in turn, I don't mean in order, added the Marquis, assuming the air of lightness which was so natural to him. While we speak, you will write about twenty pages; you will come back here with me, we will reduce these twenty pages to four. It is these four pages that you will recite to me tomorrow morning, instead of the whole issue of the Quotidienne. You will leave immediately afterwards, you will have to run the post office like a young man who travels for his pleasures. Your goal will be to not be noticed by anyone. You will come to a great character. There, you will need more address. It is about deceiving everything around him; for among his secretaries, among his servants, there are people sold to our enemies, and who lie in wait for our agents as they pass to intercept them. You will have a meaningless letter of recommendation.","“Don’t be concerned: this will not be a disorderly conversation; each will speak when his turn arrives. I don’t mean in some formal sequence,” the marquis added, returning to the light, subtle way so natural to him. “While we are speaking, you will write perhaps twenty pages. We’ll come back here, you and I, and we’ll reduce those twenty pages to four. These are the four pages you will recite back to me, tomorrow morning, instead of the whole issue of The Legitimist. You’ll leave for London soon afterward. You will have to travel as a young pleasure seeker. Your goal: not to be noticed by anyone. In London, you will go to a very great person. Once there, you’ll need a good deal more skill. It will be a question of deceiving all those who surround him: whether among his secretaries, or whether among his servants, there are people who have been bought by our enemies, and who are on the watch for our agents, whenever they come, so as to intercept them. “You will carry a letter of recommendation, of no significance.","“Do not be uneasy. It will not be a confused conversation by any means. Each one will speak in his turn, though not necessarily in an orderly manner,” added the marquis, falling back into that light, subtle manner which was so natural to him. “While we are talking, you will write out twenty pages and will come back here with me, and we will get those twenty pages down to four, and those are the four pages you will recite to me to-morrow morning instead of the four pages of the Quotidienne. You will leave immediately afterwards. You must post about like a young man travelling on pleasure. Your aim will be to avoid attracting attention. You will arrive at the house of a great personage. You will there need more skill. Your business will then be to take in all his entourage, for among his secretaries and his servants are some people who have sold themselves to our enemies, and who spy on our travelling agents in order to intercept them. “You will have an insignificant letter of introduction."
"— Ceci me plaît, dit le marquis, j’en ferai le camarade de mon fils, cela suffira-t-il?","""I like that,"" said the marquis, ""I'll make him my son's comrade, will that be enough?""","“I like that,” said the marquis. “I’ll make him my son’s companion.

"Je me suis donc donné un maître! se disait Mlle de La Mole en se promenant agitée dans sa chambre. Il est rempli d’honneur, à la bonne heure; mais si je pousse à bout sa vanité, il se vengera en faisant connaître la nature de nos relations. Tel est le malheur de notre siècle, les plus étranges égarements même ne guérissent pas de l’ennui. Julien était le premier amour de Mathilde, et, dans cette circonstance de la vie qui donne quelques illusions tendres même aux âmes les plus sèches, elle était en proie aux réflexions les plus amères.","So I gave myself a master! Mademoiselle de La Mole said to herself as she walked restlessly about her room. It is filled with honour, well and good; but if I push his vanity to the limit, he will avenge himself by making known the nature of our relations. Such is the misfortune of our century, even the strangest aberrations do not cure boredom. Julien was Mathilde's first love, and in this circumstance of life which gives some tender illusions even to the driest souls, she was a prey to the most bitter reflections.","“I’ve given myself a master!” Mademoiselle de La Mole told herself, succumbing to the blackest, most sorrowful regret. “He’s enormously honorable, for what that’s worth, but if I push his vanity over the edge, he’ll take his revenge by letting the world know our relationship.” Mathilde had never had a lover, and being in a state which makes even the sourest souls dream tender illusions, she was consumed by the bitterest of black thoughts.","“I have given myself a master,” said Mademoiselle de la Mole to herself, a prey to the blackest sorrow. “Luckily he is honour itself, but if I offend his vanity, he will revenge himself by making known the nature of our relations.” Mathilde had never had a lover, and though passing through a stage of life which affords some tender illusions even to the coldest souls, she fell a prey to the most bitter reflections."

If I had any power, instead of being, as I am, a mere atom, I’d have three men killed if I could save the lives of four.”","“Upon my word,” said Julien, “the end justifies the means. If instead of being an insignificant man I had some power, I would have three men hanged in order to save four men’s lives.”"
"On lui demandait une réponse décisive avec une hauteur qui augmenta sa gaieté intérieure. Il se donna le plaisir de mystifier, pendant deux pages, les personnes qui voudraient se moquer de lui, et ce fut encore par une plaisanterie qu’il annonça, vers la fin de sa réponse, son départ décidé pour le lendemain matin.","He was asked for a decisive answer with a haughtiness which increased his inner gaiety. He gave himself the pleasure of mystifying, for two pages, those who would make fun of him, and it was again in a joke that he announced, towards the end of his answer, his departure decided for the next morning.","With a haughtiness that fueled his inner delight, the letter asked for a decisive reply. He amused himself, as he wrote his two pages, by playfully toying with the people who might be trying to make a fool of him and, still in this humor, toward the end of his response, announced that he would be leaving the following morning.","He was asked, with a poignancy which merely increased his inner gaiety, to give a definite answer.

"Une personne était plus heureuse que lui. D’abord elle l’avait vu passer d’une des croisées de l’hôtel de ville; montant ensuite en calèche et faisant rapidement un grand détour, elle arriva à temps pour frémir, quand son cheval l’emporta hors du rang. Enfin, sa calèche sortant au grand galop par une autre porte de la ville, elle parvint à rejoindre la route par où le roi devait passer, et put suivre la garde d’honneur à vingt pas de distance, au milieu d’une noble poussière. Dix mille paysans crièrent: Vive le roi, quand le maire eut l’honneur de haranguer Sa Majesté. Une heure après, lorsque, tous les discours écoutés, le roi allait entrer dans la ville, la petite pièce de canon se remit à tirer à coups précipités. Mais un accident s’ensuivit, non pour les canonniers qui avaient fait leurs preuves à Leipzig et à Montmirail mais pour le futur premier adjoint, M. de Moirod. Son cheval le déposa mollement dans l’unique bourbier qui fût sur la grande route, ce qui fit esclandre, parce qu’il fallut le tirer de là pour que la voiture du roi put passer.","One person was happier than him. First she had seen him pass from one of the windows of the Hôtel de Ville; then getting into a carriage and making a quick detour, she arrived in time to shudder when her horse carried her off the line. Finally, her carriage exiting at full gallop through another gate of the city, she succeeded in rejoining the road by which the king was to pass, and was able to follow the guard of honor at a distance of twenty paces, in the midst of a noble dust. . Ten thousand peasants shouted: Long live the king, when the mayor had the honor of haranguing His Majesty. An hour later, when all the speeches had been listened to, the king was about to enter the city, the little piece of cannon began to fire again with hasty shots. But an accident ensued, not for the gunners who had proven themselves at Leipzig and Montmirail but for the future first deputy, M. de Moirod. His horse deposited him limply in the only quagmire that was on the main road, which caused a scandal, because he had to be pulled out of there so that the king's carriage could pass.","There was one person still happier. She had first seen him as he passed the town hall’s casement windows. Then, riding in a light carriage, and quickly making a large detour, she arrived just in time to shudder as his horse drove out of the line. Finally, her carriage dashing at full gallop, heading out one of the other town gates, she managed to reappear at the spot where the king was to pass, and proceeded on just behind the slowly advancing lines, no more then twenty paces distant, in the middle of all the noble dust. Ten thousand peasants shouted when the mayor had the honor of speechifying for His Majesty: “Long live the king!” Another hour afterward, when all the speeches had been listened out to the very last word, the king actually entered the town and the little cannon began to fire like mad. Alas, then came an accident—not to the cannoneers, who had proven their worth at Leipzig and Montmirail, but to the future first deputy, Monsieur de Moirod. His horse threw him off, and he landed, gently, right in the only pool of mud along the whole route, which was scandalous, because he had to be hauled out of there before the king ’s carriage went by.","One person was happier than he. She had first seen him pass from one of the folding windows in the Hotel de Ville. Then taking her carriage and rapidly making a long detour, she arrived in time to shudder when his horse took him outside the line. Finally she put her carriage to the gallop, left by another gate of the town, succeeded in rejoining the route by which the King was to pass, and was able to follow the Guard of Honour at twenty paces distance in the midst of a noble dust. Six thousand peasants cried “Long live the King,” when the mayor had the honour to harangue his Majesty. An hour afterwards, when all the speeches had been listened to, and the King was going to enter the town, the little cannon began again to discharge its spasmodic volleys. But an accident ensued, the victim being, not one of the cannoneers who had proved their mettle at Leipsic and at Montreuil, but the future deputy-mayor, M. de Moirod. His horse gently laid him in the one heap of mud on the high road, a somewhat scandalous circumstance, inasmuch as it was necessary to extricate him to allow the King to pass."
"Cette idée qui, pour la première fois, paraissait aussi nettement à son imagination, l’occupa tout entier après les premières minutes de promenade données au sentiment du danger.","This idea, which, for the first time, appeared so clearly to his imagination, occupied him entirely after the first minutes of the walk given to the feeling of danger.","This idea, for the first time clearly presenting itself to his mind, took over his thoughts, after the first few minutes of his walk, which had been filled with the sense of danger.","This idea, which had not previously presented itself with so much definiteness to his imagination, completely engrossed him during his walk after the first few minutes which he had spent thinking about his danger."

"Ce raisonnement était fort sage. Mais le lendemain, le bras de Mathilde, entrevu entre la manche de sa robe et son gant, suffisait pour plonger notre jeune philosophe dans des souvenirs cruels, et qui cependant l’attachaient à la vie.

Well! he said to himself then, I will follow this Russian policy to the end. How will this end?","This was eminently good thinking. Yet the next day, a glimpse of Mathilde’s arm, displayed between the sleeve of her dress and her glove, was all it took to plunge our young philosopher into cruel recollection, which all the same linked him, once again, to life. “All right!” he then said to himself. “I’ll pursue this Russian diplomacy till it finishes. How will it end?","This reasoning was very logical.

"Julien fut très embarrassé, il avait copié ligne par ligne, sans songer à ce qu’il écrivait, et apparemment avait oublié de substituer aux mots Londres et Richemond, qui se trouvaient dans l’original, ceux de Paris et Saint-Cloud.

"L’un d’eux, Falcoz, homme d’esprit et de coeur, marchand de papier à Verrières, avait acheté une imprimerie dans le chef-lieu du département et entrepris un journal. La congrégation avait résolu de le ruiner: son journal avait été condamné, son brevet d’imprimeur lui avait été retiré. Dans ces tristes circonstances, il essaya d’écrire à M. de Rênal pour la première fois depuis dix ans. Le maire de Verrières crut devoir répondre en vieux Romain: Si le ministre du roi me faisait l’honneur de me consulter, je lui dirais: Ruinez sans pitié tous les imprimeurs de province et mettez l’imprimerie en monopole comme le tabac. Cette lettre à un ami intime, que tout Verrières admira dans le temps, M. de Rênal sen rappelait les termes avec horreur. Qui m’eût dit qu’avec mon rang, ma fortune, mes croix, je le regratterais un jour?

Under these sad circumstances, he tried to write to M. de Rênal for the first time for ten years. The mayor of Verrières thought he had to answer in old Roman language: If the king's minister would do me the honor of consulting me, I would say to him: Ruin all the printers in the provinces without pity and put printing as a monopoly like tobacco. This letter to a close friend, whom all Verrieres admired at the time, M. de Rênal remembered the terms with horror. Who would have told me that with my rank, my fortune, my crosses, I would scratch it one day?

In these difficult circumstances, he tried writing, for the first time in ten years, to Monsieur de Rênal.

Luckily, however, he had not thought of spying on his wife.","One of them, Falcoz, a paper-merchant of Verrières, and a man of intellect and spirit, had bought a printing press in the chief town of the department and undertaken the production of a journal.

"Il n’y a pas trop d’affectation dans le style, se dit Julien, cherchant par ses remarques littéraires à contenir la joie qui contractait ses joues et le forçait à rire malgré lui.","There's not too much affectation in the style, Julien told himself, trying through his literary remarks to contain the joy that contracted his cheeks and forced him to laugh in spite of himself.","“Her style isn’t too terribly affected,” Julien said to himself, trying to make use of literary observations to restrain a joy that made him suck in his cheeks and, in spite of himself, laugh out loud. “So!”","“The style is too affected,” said Julien to himself, as he endeavoured to control by his literary criticism the joy which was spreading over his cheeks and forcing him to smile in spite of himself."
— Ah! beaucoup dans ce moment! mais je ne regretterais pas de vous avoir connu.,- Ah! a lot right now! but I would not regret having known you.,"“Ah, very much, right at the moment. But I wouldn’t regret having known you.”","“Oh, very much at a moment like this, but I should not regret having known you.”"
"Le lendemain, Julien assista à deux cours de théologie, et revint ensuite transcrire une vingtaine de lettres. Il trouva établi près de lui, dans la bibliothèque, un jeune homme mis avec beaucoup de soin; mais la tournure était mesquine, et la physionomie celle de l’envie.","The next day, Julien attended two courses in theology, and then returned to transcribe about twenty letters. He found seated near him, in the library, a young man dressed with great care; but the bearing was petty, and the countenance one of envy.","The next day, Julien attended two theology classes, and returned, in order to transcribe twenty letters. He found seated very near him, in the library, a young man carefully but shabbily dressed, and a face stamped with envy.","On the following day Julien attended two theology lectures, and then came back to copy out about twenty letters. He found a young man, who though very carefully dressed, had a mean appearance and an envious expression, established near him in the library."
— Que m’importe? il m’a regardé.,"""What do I care?"" he looked at me.",“Who cares? He was looking at me.”,“What does it matter? He looked at me.”
"Il fut peu sensible au premier aspect de Paris, aperçu dans le lointain. Les châteaux en Espagne sur son sort à venir avaient à lutter avec le souvenir encore présent des vingt-quatre heures qu’il venait de passer à Verrières. Il se jurait de ne jamais abandonner les enfants de son amie, et de tout quitter pour les protéger, si les impertinences des prêtres nous donnent la république et les persécutions contre les nobles.","He was insensitive to the first sight of Paris, seen in the distance. The castles in Spain about his future fate had to struggle with the still present memory of the twenty-four hours he had just spent at Verrieres. He swore to himself never to abandon the children of his friend, and to leave everything to protect them, if the impertinence of the priests gave us the republic and the persecutions against the nobles.","He paid little attention to the first view of Paris, seen in the distance. Constructing castles in the air had been warring against lingering, still palpable memories of the twenty-four hours just spent in Verrières. He silently swore never to abandon his beloved’s children; he’d leave everything in order to protect them, should priestly arrogance ever bring on a republic and persecution of the aristocracy.","He appreciated but little the first sight of Paris as perceived in the distance. The castles in the air he had built about his future had to struggle with the still-present memory of the twenty-four hours that he had just passed in Verrières. He vowed that he would never abandon his mistress’s children, and that he would leave everything in order to protect them, if the impertinence of the priests brought about a republic and the persecution of the nobles."
"— Oui, il paraît que votre esprit était bien loin. N’oubliez jamais qu’un ambassadeur, et de votre âge encore, ne doit pas avoir l’air de forcer la confiance.","- Yes, it seems that your mind was far away. Never forget that an ambassador, even your age, should not appear to force trust.","“Yes, it did seem that your mind was far away. Do not forget that an ambassador, and above all one of your age, should never seem to be seeking information he has not been offered.”","“Yes, it seems your mind was a very long way off. Remember that an emissary, and particularly one of your age, should not appear to be a man who forces confidences.”"
"— Surtout n’ayez l’air que d’un fat qui voyage pour tuer le temps, lui dit-il avec amitié, au moment où il quittait le salon. Il y avait peut-être plus d’un faux frère dans notre assemblée d’hier soir.","""Above all, don't look like a fool who travels to kill time,"" he said to her amiably, as he was leaving the drawing-room. There was maybe more than one false brother in our congregation last night.","“Never stop looking like a fop, traveling to kill time,” he told Julien, just as the younger man was leaving. His voice was friendly. “There may have been more than one false friend at our meeting, last night.”","“Above all, mind you look like a coxcomb who is simply travelling to kill time,” he said affectionately to him when he was leaving the salon. “Perhaps there was more than one treacherous brother in this evening’s meeting.”"

"Julien né manqua pas l’adjudication du bail. Il y avait foule dans une salle mal éclairée; mais tout le monde se toisait d’une façon singulière. Tous les yeux étaient fixés sur une table, où Julien aperçut, dans un plat d’étain, trois petits bouts de bougie allumés. L’huissier criait: Trois cents francs, messieurs!","Julien did not miss the auction of the lease. There was a crowd in a poorly lit room; but everyone looked at each other in a strange way. All eyes were fixed on a table, where Julien saw, in a pewter dish, three small bits of lighted candle. The usher shouted: Three hundred francs, gentlemen!","Julien would not have missed the auction. The dimly lit room was crowded, but everyone was inspecting everyone else in the oddest way. Then all eyes fixed on a tin plate, on which Julien noticed three candles burning. The bailiff shouted: “Three hundred francs, gentlemen!” “Three hundred francs!","Julien made a point of being present at the auction of the lease. There was a crowd in the badly-lighted hall, but everybody kept quizzing each other in quite a singular way. All eyes were fixed on a table where Julien perceived three little lighted candle-ends on a tin plate. The usher was crying out “Three hundred francs, gentlemen.”"
"Son âme fut inondée de bonheur, non qu’il aimât Mme de Rênal, mais un affreux supplice venait de cesser. Pour que Mme Derville ne s’aperçût de rien, il se crut obligé de parler, sa voix alors était éclatante et forte. Celle de Mme de Rênal, au contraire, trahissait tant d’émotion, que son amie la crut malade et lui proposa de rentrer. Julien sentit le danger: Si Mme de Rênal rentre au salon, je vais retomber dans la position affreuse où j’ai passé la journée. J’ai tenu cette main trop peu de temps pour que cela compte comme un avantage qui m’est acquis.","His soul was inundated with happiness, not that he loved Madame de Rênal, but a terrible torture had just ceased. To prevent Madame Derville from noticing anything, he thought himself obliged to speak, his voice then sounding loud and loud. Madame de Rênal's, on the contrary, betrayed so much emotion that her friend thought she was ill and suggested that she come home. Julien sensed the danger: If Madame de Rênal returns to the salon, I will fall back into the dreadful position in which I have spent the day. I held that hand too short a time for it to count as a vested advantage.","Happiness flooded across his heart: it was not that he loved Madame de Rênal, but the horrible torture was over. Madame Derville saw nothing, so he felt obliged to go on talking; his voice became bright and strong. Madame de Rênal’s, on the other hand, shook with such emotion that her friend thought she was ill and suggested she return to the house. Julien sensed the danger: “If Madame de Rênal goes back to the drawing room, I’m going to tumble into the frightful position I’ve been in all day. I haven’t held this hand captive long enough for the victory to count.”","His soul was inundated with happiness, not that he loved Madame de Rênal, but an awful torture had just ended. He thought it necessary to say something, to avoid Madame Derville noticing anything. His voice was now strong and ringing. Madame de Rênal’s, on the contrary, betrayed so much emotion that her friend thought she was ill, and suggested her going in. Julien scented danger, “if Madame de Rênal goes back to the salon, I shall relapse into the awful state in which I have been all day. I have held the hand far too short a time for it really to count as the scoring of an actual advantage.”"
"Julien entra dans l’église neuve de Verrières. Toutes les fenêtres hautes de l’édifice étaient voilées avec des rideaux cramoisis. Julien se trouva à quelques pas derrière le banc de Mme de Rênal. Il lui sembla qu’elle priait avec ferveur. La vue de cette femme qui l’avait tant aimé fit trembler le bras de Julien d’une telle façon, qu’il ne put d’abord exécuter son dessein. Je ne le puis, se disait-il à lui-même; physiquement, je ne le puis.","Julien entered the new church at Verrières. All the high windows of the building were veiled with crimson curtains.

There’s even one from yesterday.","“Finding Napoleon’s portrait,” he said to himself, “in the possession of a man who professes so great a hate for the usurper!

"Je ne vous cacherai pas que le jeune comte de La Mole doit vous mépriser d’abord, parce que vous n’êtes qu’un petit bourgeois.

You, you’re the son of a Verrières carpenter who, what’s even worse, began by working for his father.

"A son premier regard dans l’appartement, Mlle de La Mole fut rassurée. D’abord c’était un laquais en livrée fort élégante, qui lui avait ouvert. Le salon où on la fit attendre étalait ce luxe fin et délicat, si différent de la magnificence grossière, et que l’on ne trouve à Paris que dans les meilleures maisons. Dès qu’elle aperçut M. de Frilair qui venait à elle d’un air paterne, toutes les idées de crime atroce disparurent. Elle ne trouva pas même sur cette belle figure, l’empreinte de cette vertu énergique et quelque peu sauvage si antipathique à la société de Paris. Le demi-sourire qui animait les traits du prêtre, qui disposait de tout à Besançon, annonçait l’homme de bonne compagnie, le prélat instruit, l’administrateur habile. Mathilde se crut à Paris.","At her first glance into the apartment, Mademoiselle de La Mole was reassured. First it was a lackey in very elegant livery who opened the door. The drawing-room where she was made to wait displayed that fine and delicate luxury, so different from crude magnificence, which one finds in Paris only in the best houses. As soon as she saw M. de Frilair coming towards her with a paternal air, all thoughts of an atrocious crime disappeared. She did not find even in this handsome face the imprint of that energetic and somewhat savage virtue so antipathetic to Paris society. The half-smile which animated the features of the priest, who disposed of everything in Besançon, announced the man of good company, the educated prelate, the skilful administrator. Mathilde thought she was in Paris.","Her first glimpse of the vicar-general’s rooms reassured her. First, the door was opened by a servant in very elegant livery. The drawing room where one waited displayed a subtle, delicate luxury to be found, in Paris, only in the best houses. The moment she saw Father de Frilair, who approached her most paternally, all her notions of horrible criminality disappeared. The appearance of this handsome man did not in the least evoke a sense of energetic virtue, more than a little barbaric, so obnoxious to Paris society. The half smile on the priest’s face—he who controlled everything in Besançon—proclaimed a man of good manners, the learned prelate, the crafty administrator. Mathilde felt herself back in Paris.","After her first look at the apartment, Mademoiselle de la Mole felt reassured. In the first place, the lackey who had opened the door to her had on a very elegant livery.

As soon as she noticed M. de Frilair coming towards her with quite a paternal air, all her ideas of his criminality disappeared. She did not even find on his handsome face the impress of that drastic and somewhat savage courage which is so antipathetic to Paris society.

"Il eût voulu pouvoir se battre à l’instant. Mais une difficulté l’arrêtait. Dans tout ce grand Paris, où prendre un témoin? il n’avait pas un ami. Il avait eu plusieurs connaissances; mais toutes, régulièrement, au bout de six semaines de relations, s’éloignaient de lui. Je suis insociable, et m’en voilà cruellement puni, pensa-t-il.

He had no friends. He had had a few acquaintances, but after six weeks they had all dropped him. “I am unsocial, and I’m being harshly punished for it,” he thought.

He did not have a single friend.

Julien was frank with him."
"La profondeur, l’inconnu du caractère de Julien eussent effrayé, même en nouant avec lui une relation ordinaire. Et elle en allait faire son amant, peut-être son maître!","The depth, the unknownness of Julien's character would have frightened people, even if they had entered into an ordinary relationship with him.

"Vers les midi Julien arriva. On entendit le pas du cheval retentir dans la cour. Julien descendit. Mathilde le fit appeler, et se jeta dans ses bras presque à la vue de sa femme de chambre. Julien ne fut pas très reconnaissant de ce transport, il sortait fort diplomate et fort calculateur de sa longue conférence avec l’abbé Pirard. Son imagination était éteinte par le calcul des possibles. Mathilde, les larmes aux yeux, lui apprit qu’elle avait vu sa lettre de suicide.","Around noon Julien arrived. The footsteps of the horse echoed in the yard. Julien got off. Mathilde sent for him, and threw herself into his arms almost at the sight of her maid.

"Ce que je fais est bien hardi, pensa Julien en sortant de l’hôtel de Fervaques, mais tant pis pour Korasoff. Oser écrire à une vertu si célèbre! Je vais en être traité avec le dernier mépris, et rien ne m’amusera davantage. C’est, au fond, la seule comédie à laquelle je puisse être sensible.

Yes, to ridicule this so odious being, whom I call myself, will amuse me.

Imagine daring to write love letters to such a celebrated prude! I’ll be treated with the utmost contempt, and nothing could please me more. And, really, this is the only kind of comedy I care for. Yes: To cover this disgusting creature I call me in ridicule, that will please me. If I took myself seriously, I’d commit a crime, just for the distraction.”","“I am taking a very bold course!” thought Julien as he came out of the Hôtel de Fervaques, “but all the worse for Korasoff. To think of daring to write to so virtuous a celebrity. I shall be treated with the utmost contempt, and nothing will amuse me more. It is really the only comedy that I can in any way appreciate. Yes, it will amuse me to load with ridicule that odious creature whom I call myself. If I believed in myself, I would commit some crime to distract myself.”"
"Je comprends, pensa Julien; il ne serait pas fâché de me voir épargner la façon de ma mort à son valet de chambre… Qu’il me tue, à la bonne heure c’est une satisfaction que je lui offre… Mais, parbleu, j’aime la vie… Je me dois à mon fils.","I understand, thought Julien; he would not be sorry to see me spare the way of my death to his valet de chambre… Let him kill me, at the right time it is a satisfaction that I offer him… But, parbleu, I love life… I owe myself to my son.","“I quite understand,” Julien thought. “He wouldn’t regret it, if I spared his valet the trouble of killing me. . . .

"Certaine de l’affection de Julien, peut-être sa vertu eût trouvé des forces contre lui. Tremblante de le perdre à jamais, sa passion l’égara jusqu’au point de reprendre la main de Julien que, dans sa distraction, il avait laissée appuyée sur le dossier d’une chaise. Cette action réveilla ce jeune ambitieux: il eût voulu qu’elle eût pour témoins tous ces nobles si fiers qui, à table, lorsqu’il était au bas bout avec les enfants, le regardaient avec un sourire si protecteur.

Shaking from fear of losing him, her passion came to the point of reaching for his hand, which in his self-absorption he had left lying along the back of a chair, and taking it in hers. This revived his youthful ambition. He would have preferred that what she had done be witnessed by all those terribly proud, noble folk who, with patronizing smiles, had looked down at him, seated with her children at the foot of her husband’s table. “This woman can’t really despise me, not now.

I owe it to myself to be her lover.” Such a thought would never have occurred to him, before his friend’s ingenuous confidences.","If she had been certain of Julien’s affection, her virtue would possibly have found strength to resist him. But trembling lest she should lose him for ever, she was distracted by her passion to the point of taking again Julien’s hand, which he had left in his absent-mindedness leaning on the back of the chair.

"Mais il ne put plus obtenir de réponse sensée. De temps à autre, M.

"— Ah! oui, le duc de Luxembourg à Montmorency accompagne un M. Coindet du côté de Paris…, reprit Mlle de La Mole avec le plaisir et l’abandon de la première jouissance de pédanterie.

It was even more than was required to raise Julien ’s admiration to the maximum.

"Ce regard est peut-être une comédie, pensa Julien; mais cette respiration pressée, mais tout ce trouble! Bah! se dit-il, qui suis-je pour juger de toutes ces choses? Il s’agit ici de ce qu’il y a de plus sublime et de plus fin parmi les femmes de Paris. Cette respiration pressée qui a été sur le point de me toucher, elle l’aura étudiée chez Léontine Fay, qu’elle aime tant.","This look is perhaps a comedy, thought Julien; but this hurried breathing, all this trouble! Bah! he said to himself, who am I to judge of all these things? It is a question here of what is most sublime and finest among the women of Paris. This hurried breathing that was about to touch me, she will have studied it with Léontine Fay, whom she loves so much.","“Her expression is perhaps part of the comedy,” thought Julien, “but that rapid breathing—all that agitation! Bah!” he told himself. “Who am I to pass judgment on all this? This is the Parisian woman at her most sublime, her most subtle. This quick breath, which almost moved me, is something she must have learned from Léontine Fay, that actress she loves so much.”","“Perhaps that look is a pose,” thought Julien, “but how about that hurried breathing and all that agitation? Bah,” he said to himself, “who am I to judge of such things? We are dealing with the cream of Parisian sublimity and subtlety. As for that hurried breathing which was on the point of affecting me, she no doubt studied it with Léontine Fay, whom she likes so much.”"
"Dans ses moments d’oubli d’ambition, Julien admirait avec transport jusqu’aux chapeaux, jusqu’aux robes de Mme de Rênal. Il ne pouvait se rassasier du plaisir de sentir leur parfum. Il ouvrait son armoire de glace et restait des heures entières, admirant la beauté et l’arrangement de tout ce qu’il y trouvait. Son amie, appuyée sur lui, le regardait; lui regardait ces bijoux, ces chiffons qui, la veille d’un mariage, emplissent une corbeille de noce.","In his moments of forgotten ambition, Julien admired with transport even the hats, even the dresses of Madame de Rênal.

His friend, leaning on him, looked at him; he looked at those jewels, those rags which, on the eve of a wedding, fill a wedding basket.","When he forgot ambition, briefly, Julien was extravagantly pleased even by Madame de Rênal’s hats and by her dresses. He could not get enough of the pleasures he took in her perfume. He opened her glass cabinet and spent hours on end admiring the beauty as well as the placement of everything he found. His beloved, leaning against him, watched him as he looked at her jewels and her frills and laces, the presents that, before a marriage, fill the wedding baskets set out on display.","In those moments when he forgot his ambition, Julien admired ecstatically even the hats and even the dresses of Madame de Rênal.

"— De 1806 à 1814, l’Angleterre n’a eu qu’un tort, dit-il, c’est de ne pas agir directement et personnellement sur Napoléon.

"Peu à peu l’agitation de Julien se calma; la prudence surnagea. Il se dit, comme son maître Tartuffe, dont il savait le rôle par coeur:","Little by little Julien's agitation subsided; caution prevailed. He said to himself, like his master Tartuffe, whose role he knew by heart:","Gradually, Julien grew calmer; caution came floating to the surface. He recited to himself the words of his model and master, that great hypocrite, Molière’s Tartuffe:",Julien’s agitation became gradually calmed. Prudence emerged to the top. He said to himself like his master Tartufe whose part he knew by heart:
"Pour Julien, jamais il ne s’était trouvé aussi près de ces terribles instruments de l’artillerie féminine. Il est impossible, se disait-il, qu’à Paris on ait quelque chose de plus beau! Alors il ne trouvait point d objection à son bonheur. Souvent la sincère admiration et les transports de sa maîtresse lui faisaient oublier la vaine théorie qui l’avait rendu si compassé et presque si ridicule dans les premiers moments de cette liaison. Il y eut des moments où, malgré ses habitudes d’hypocrisie, il trouvait une douceur extrême à avouer à cette grande dame qui l’admirait, son ignorance d’une foule de petits usages. Le rang de sa maîtresse semblait l’élever au-dessus de lui-même. Mme de Rênal, de son côté, trouvait la plus douce des voluptés morales à instruire ainsi, dans une foule de petites choses, ce jeune homme rempli de génie, et qui était regardé par tout le monde comme devant un jour aller si loin. Même le sous-préfet et M. Valenod ne pouvaient s’empêcher de l’admirer: ils lui en semblaient moins sots. Quant à Mme Derville, elle était bien loin d’avoir à exprimer les mêmes sentiments. Désespérée de ce qu’elle croyait deviner, et voyant que les sages avis devenaient odieux à une femme qui, à la lettre, avait perdu la tête, elle quitta Vergy, sans donner une explication qu’on se garda de lui demander. Mme de Rênal en versa quelques larmes, et bientôt il lui sembla que sa félicité redoublait. Par ce départ, elle se trouvait presque toute la journée tête à tête avec son amant.","For Julien, he had never been so close to these terrible instruments of feminine artillery. It is impossible, he said to himself, that in Paris there is something more beautiful! So he found no objection to his happiness. Often the sincere admiration and transports of his mistress made him forget the vain theory which had made him so stiff and almost so ridiculous in the first moments of this affair. There were times when, despite his habits of hypocrisy, he found an extreme sweetness in confessing to this great lady who admired him his ignorance of a host of petty customs. His mistress's rank seemed to raise him above himself. Madame de Rênal, for her part, found the sweetest of moral pleasures in thus instructing, in a host of little things, this young man filled with genius, and who was looked upon by everyone as one day destined to go so far. Even the sub-prefect and M. Valenod could not help admiring him: they seemed less stupid to him. As for Madame Derville, she was far from having to express the same sentiments. Despairing of what she believed she had guessed, and seeing that wise advice became odious to a woman who, literally, had lost her mind, she left Vergy, without giving an explanation, which no one took care to ask of her. Madame de Rênal shed a few tears, and soon it seemed to her that her happiness redoubled. By this departure, she found herself most of the day face to face with her lover.","Julien had never found himself so close to these awesome instruments of feminine artillery. “It’s not possible,” he said to himself, “that Paris could have anything more beautiful!” And then he could see nothing objectionable in his happiness. Quite often honest admiration, and his mistress’s ecstasies, made him forget the empty theory that, early on in this relationship, had tied him into knots and made him very nearly ridiculous. There were moments when, despite his habitual hypocrisy, he discovered a wonderful sweetness in confiding to this noble lady, for whom he had so much admiration, his ignorance about all manner of society’s little ways. His mistress’s rank seemed to lift him equally high. As for Madame de Rênal, she found the sweetest and most moral of sensual pleasures in teaching him about this abundance of trifles—he, a young man of genius, widely regarded as someone who, one day, would go far. Even the deputy governor of the district, and Monsieur Valenod, did not hesitate to admire him; they struck her, because of that, as less stupid. Madame Derville could not have agreed, not at all. Depressed by what she thought she was seeing, and finding her wise advice hateful to a woman literally out of her mind, she left Vergy without any explanation—which, indeed, no one bothered to ask of her. Madame de Rênal shed a few tears, and soon realized that her happiness had vastly increased. With Madame Derville gone, she could spend almost the entire day alone with her lover.","As for Julien, he had never been so near to those terrible instruments of feminine artillery. “It is impossible,” he said to himself, “for there to be anything more beautiful in Paris.” He could find no flaw in his happiness. The sincere admiration and ecstacies of his mistress would frequently make him forget that silly pose which had rendered him so stiff and almost ridiculous during the first moments of the intrigue. There were moments where, in spite of his habitual hypocrisy, he found an extreme delight in confessing to this great lady who admired him, his ignorance of a crowd of little usages. His mistress’s rank seemed to lift him above himself. Madame de Rênal, on her side, would find the sweetest thrill of intellectual voluptuousness in thus instructing in a number of little things this young man who was so full of genius, and who was looked upon by everyone as destined one day to go so far. Even the sub-prefect and M. Valenod could not help admiring him. She thought it made them less foolish. As for Madame Derville, she was very far from being in a position to express the same sentiments. Rendered desperate by what she thought she divined, and seeing that her good advice was becoming offensive to a woman who had literally lost her head, she left Vergy without giving the explanation, which her friend carefully refrained from asking. Madame de Rênal shed a few tears for her, and soon found her happiness greater than ever. As a result of her departure, she found herself alone with her lover nearly the whole day."

"Ce n’était pas, il est vrai, cette volupté de l’âme qu’il avait trouvée quelquefois auprès de Mme de Rênal. Quelle différence, grand Dieu! Il n’y avait rien de tendre dans ses sentiments de ce premier moment. C’était le plus vif bonheur d’ambition, et Julien était surtout ambitieux. Il parla de nouveau des gens par lui soupçonnés, et des précautions qu’il avait inventées. En parlant, il songeait aux moyens de profiter de sa victoire.","It was not, it is true, that voluptuousness of the soul which he had sometimes found near Madame de Rênal. What a difference, great God! There was nothing tender in his feelings from that first moment. It was the liveliest happiness of ambition, and Julien was above all ambitious. He spoke again of the people suspected by him, and of the precautions he had invented. As he spoke, he thought of ways to profit from his victory.","It was not, indeed, that same intensity of sensual pleasure he had experienced, several times, with Madame de Rênal. He felt no tenderness whatever: this was the vigorous happiness of ambition, for Julien was ambitious, above all else. Once again, he talked about the people he had suspected, and the precautions he had devised. As he spoke, he thought how best to take advantage of his triumph.","It was not, it was true, that soulful pleasure which he had sometimes found with Madame de Rênal. There was no element of tenderness in the feelings of these first few minutes. It was the keen happiness of a gratified ambition, and Julien was, above all, ambitious.

"Pendant tout le temps usurpé dans la vie de Julien par l’épisode Fervaques, Mlle de La Mole avait besoin de prendre sur elle pour ne pas songer à lui. Son âme était en proie à de violents combats: quelquefois elle se flattait de mépriser ce jeune homme si triste; mais, malgré elle, sa conversation la captivait. Ce qui l’étonnait surtout, c’était sa fausseté parfaite, il ne disait pas un mot à la maréchale qui ne fût un mensonge, ou du moins un déguisement abominable de sa façon de penser, que Mathilde connaissait si parfaitement sur presque tous les sujets.

Tanbeau, qui tiennent le même langage!","During all the time usurped in Julien's life by the Fervaques episode, Mlle de La Mole needed to take it upon herself not to think of him.

What astonished him above all was his perfect falsity, he did not say a word to the Maréchale that was not a lie, or at least an abominable disguise of his way of thinking, which Mathilde knew so perfectly about almost every subject. topics.

Tanbeau, who use the same language!","During the time carved out of Julien’s life by Madame de Fervaques, Mademoiselle de La Mole had to try not thinking of him. There was a violent struggle in her soul: sometimes she was proud of despising someone so woebegone, but in spite of herself she found his conversation captivating. What especially amazed her was its perfect falsity: every word he said to Madame de Fervaques was either a lie or, at least, a horrific camouflaging of his real thought, with which, on virtually every subject imaginable, Mathilde was completely familiar. She found this Machiavellianism striking. “What depth!” she told herself. “How different from the grandiloquent simpletons, or the vulgar rascals who, like Monsieur Tanbeau, use exactly the same language!”","Mademoiselle de la Mole needed to exercise her self-control to avoid thinking of Julien during the whole period filled by the de Fervaques episode.

She was particularly astonished by his absolute falseness. He did not say a single word to the maréchale which was not a lie, or at any rate, an abominable travesty of his own way of thinking, which Mathilde knew so perfectly in every phase. This Machiavellianism impressed her. “What subtlety,” she said to herself. “What a difference between the bombastic coxcombs, or the common rascals like Tanbeau who talk in the same strain.”"

"M. de Rênal laissa sa femme dans la première boutique de nouveautés où elle entra, pour aller faire quelques visites. Il revint plus morose que le matin, il était convaincu que toute la ville s’occupait de lui et de Julien. A la vérité, personne ne lui avait encore laissé soupçonner la partie offensante des propos du public. Ceux qu’on avait redits à M. le maire avaient trait uniquement à savoir si Julien resterait chez lui avec six cents francs, ou accepterait les huit cents francs offerts par M. le directeur du dépôt.","M. de Rênal left his wife in the first novelty shop she entered to go and pay a few visits. He returned more morose than in the morning, he was convinced that the whole town was taking care of him and Julien. In truth, no one had yet let him suspect the offensive part of the comments of the public. Those which had been repeated to the mayor related solely to knowing whether Julien would stay at home with six hundred francs, or would accept the eight hundred francs offered by the director of the depot.","Monsieur de Rênal left his wife, in order to pay some visits, when she went into the first drapery shop. He came back even glummer than before: he was convinced that the whole world was thinking of nothing but him and Julien. In fact, nobody had given him the slightest indication that, in the eyes of the public, he might be the offended party. Whatever had been recounted to His Honor the Mayor was exclusively concerned with Julien, and whether he’d be staying for six hundred francs, or accepting the eight hundred offered by Monsieur Valenod.","M. de Rênal left his wife in the first draper’s shop which she entered and went to pay some visits. He came back more morose than he had been in the morning. He was convinced that the whole town was busy with himself and Julien. As a matter of fact no one had yet given him any inkling as to the more offensive part of the public gossip. Those items which had been repeated to M. the mayor dealt exclusively with the question of whether Julien would remain with him with six hundred francs, or would accept the eight hundred francs offered by M. the director of the workhouse."

"Dans cet instant, s’il se fût présenté quelque moyen honnête de renouer, elle l’eût saisi avec plaisir. Julien enfermé à double tour dans sa chambre, était en proie au plus violent désespoir. Dans ses idées folles, il pensait à se jeter à ses pieds. Si au lieu de se tenir dans un lieu écarté, il eût erré au jardin et dans l’hôtel de manière à se tenir à portée des occasions, il eût peut-être, en un seul instant, changé en bonheur le plus vif son affreux malheur.","At that moment, if there had presented itself some honest means of reconnecting, she would have seized upon it with pleasure. Julien, double-locked in his room, was in the grip of the most violent despair. In his mad ideas, he thought of throwing himself at her feet. If instead of staying in a remote place, he had wandered in the garden and in the hotel so as to keep himself within reach of opportunities, he would perhaps, in a single instant, have changed his dreadful happiness into the liveliest happiness. misfortune.","Just then, had she been offered some more or less honorable way of restarting their love affair, she’d gladly have taken it. Julien, who’d double-locked himself into his room, was overcome by the most violent despair. Among other crazy notions, he thought of throwing himself at her feet. If, instead of hiding himself in a secluded place, he had gone wandering in the garden and around the house, so he could be ready for whatever might happen, he might conceivably, in no more than a second, have changed his frightful misery into the liveliest happiness.","If at that moment some honourable means of reconciliation had presented itself, she would have embraced it with pleasure. Julien, locked in his room, was a prey to the most violent despair. He thought in his madness of throwing himself at her feet. If, instead of hiding himself in an out of the way place, he had wandered about the garden of the hôtel so as to keep within reach of any opportunity, he would perhaps have changed in a single moment his awful unhappiness into the keenest happiness."

"Peut-être eût-elle été heureuse d’être devinée; du moins le succès eût-il dépendu entièrement de la grâce avec laquelle Julien eût exprimé cette idée, et du moment qu’il eût choisi.

"La journée fut ennuyeuse pour Julien, il la passa toute entière à exécuter avec gaucherie son plan de séduction.

"— Il est inutile de regarder par la fenêtre, cria-t-il sottement à Julien. Me voici fourré dans une conspiration tout au moins, pensa celui-ci. Heureusement, elle n’est pas de celles qui conduisent en place de Grève. Quand il y aurait du danger, je dois cela et plus encore au marquis. Heureux s’il m’était donné de réparer tout le chagrin que mes folies peuvent lui causer un jour!","""It's useless to look out the window,"" he cried foolishly to Julien. Here I am stuck in a conspiracy at least, thought this one. Fortunately, she is not one of those who drive in Place de Grève. When there is danger, I owe that and more to the Marquis. Happy if it were granted to me to repair all the sorrow that my follies can cause him one day!","“You’ll learn nothing by peering through the window!” he shouted, stupidly, at Julien. “Here I am,” thought our hero, “caught up in a conspiracy, or maybe something more. Luckily, it’s not the sort that leads to the executioner’s block. But even if there’s danger, I owe the marquis that, and more. Happily, I’ll have the chance to atone for all the sorrows I may bring him, some day.” Julien went into the next room.","“It is no good looking out of the window,” he stupidly cried to Julien—“so here I am more or less mixed up in a conspiracy,” thought the latter. “Fortunately it is not one of those which lead to the Place-de-Grève. Even though there were danger, I owe this and even more to the marquis, and should be glad to be given the chance of making up for all the sorrow which my madness may one day occasion him.”"

"Après avoir lu sans plaisir d’abord les longues lettres de Julien, Mme de Fervaques commençait à en être occupée; mais une chose la désolait: quel dommage que M. Sorel ne soit pas décidément prêtre! On pourrait l’admettre à une sorte d’intimité; avec cette croix et cet habit presque bourgeois, on est exposé à des questions cruelles, et que répondre? Elle n’achevait pas sa pensée: quelque amie maligne peut supposer et même répandre que c’est un petit cousin subalterne, parent de mon père, quelque marchand décoré par la garde nationale.","After having read Julien's long letters without pleasure at first, Madame de Fervaques began to be occupied with them; but one thing distressed her: what a pity that Mr. Sorel was not definitely a priest!

She did not finish her thought: some mischievous friend may suppose and even spread that he is a junior cousin, a relative of my father, some merchant decorated by the National Guard.","Having read the first of Julien’s long letters without pleasure, Madame de Fervaques now began to find them interesting. But there was something making her unhappy: “What a shame that Monsieur Sorel is not determined to be a priest! He could then be admitted to a certain intimacy. But wearing that medal, and with his virtually bourgeois clothing, cruel questions might be asked—and how could they be answered?” Her mind did not carry that question any further. “Some wicked friend might imagine things, and even spread a rumor that he was a minor relation, from my father’s family, a businessman who got the medal for service in the National Guard.”","Madame de Fervaques had begun reading Julien’s long letters without any pleasure, but she now began to think about them; one thing, however, grieved her. “What a pity that M. Sorel was not a real priest!

Sometimes, their happiness took on all the appearance of sin.","Henceforth their happiness was of a quite superior character. The flame which consumed them was more intense.

"— Qui sait? peut-être avons-nous encore des sensations après notre mort, disait-il un jour à Fouqué. J’aimerais assez à reposer, puisque reposer est le mot, dans cette petite grotte de la grande montagne qui domine Verrières. Plusieurs fois, je te l’ai conté; retiré la nuit dans cette grotte, et ma vue plongeant au loin sur les plus riches provinces de France, l’ambition a enflammé mon coeur: alors, c’était ma passion… Enfin, cette grotte m’est chère, et l’on ne peut disconvenir qu’elle ne soit située d’une façon à faire envie à l’âme d’un philosophe… eh bien! ces bons congréganistes de Besançon font argent de tout; si tu sais t’y prendre, ils te vendront ma dépouille mortelle…","- Who knows? perhaps we still have sensations after our death, he said one day to Fouqué. I would rather like to rest, since rest is the word, in this little cave in the big mountain overlooking Verrières. Many times I have told it to you; retired at night in this grotto, and my view plunging in the distance over the richest provinces of France, ambition inflamed my heart: then, it was my passion… Finally, this grotto is dear to me, and one cannot deny that it is situated in a way to make the soul of a philosopher envious… well! those good congregationalists from Besançon make money from everything; if you know how to do it, they will sell you my mortal remains...","“Who knows? Maybe we still feel things, after our death,” he’d said to Fouqué one day. “I’d like to rest, considering that ‘rest’ is the right word, in that little cave up on the tall mountain, overlooking Verrières. I spent the night there more than once, as I’ve told you, and I could see in the distance the richest provinces in all France. My heart was burning with ambition: that was my true passion, then . . . Anyway, that cave is dear to me, and no one can argue it isn’t situated where a philosopher might envy me. . . . All right! These fine Besançon fanatics, these Congregationalists of the Holy Virgin, are good at making money out of anything. If you handle it properly, they’ll sell you my mortal remains.","“Who knows? Perhaps we have still some sensations after our death,” he had said one day to Fouqué. “I should like to rest, for rest is the right word, in that little grotto in the great mountain which dominates Verrières. Many a time, as I have told you, I have spent the night alone in that grotto, and as my gaze would plunge far and wide over the richest provinces of France, ambition would inflame my heart. In those days it was my passion.... Anyway, I hold that grotto dear, and one cannot dispute that its situation might well arouse the desires of the philosopher’s soul . . . Well, you know! those good priests of Besançon will make money out of everything. If you know how to manage it, they will sell you my mortal remains.”"
"— M. le maire, continua Julien, m’a remis cinq fois trente-six francs depuis que j’habite sa maison; je suis prêt à montrer mon livre de dépenses à M. de Rênal et à qui que ce soit, même à M.

Note, added the marquis, with a very serious air, and cutting short the thanksgiving, that I do not want to get you out of your situation. It is always a fault and a misfortune for the protector as for the protected. When my lawsuits bore you, or when you no longer suit me, I will ask for a good cure for you, like that of our friend the Abbé Pirard, and no more, added the Marquis very curtly.","“You went to look for this medal,” the marquis said, handing it to him. “I don’t want you to leave off wearing black, but I’m also used to the more entertaining tone I employ with the man in blue. Until further orders, here’s what you’re to do: pay attention. When I see you wearing this medal, you’ll be the younger son of my friend, the Duke of Chaulnes, who plainly has for the last six months been functioning as a diplomat. Please note,” added the marquis, speaking very seriously and cutting off any expression of gratitude, “that I do not wish to raise you above your proper station. That is always a mistake, and just as unfortunate for the protector as for the protected. When my lawsuits begin to bore you, or when you’re no longer acceptable to me, I’ll find you a good parish, like that of our friend Father Pirard, and that’s all,” added the marquis, rather curtly.","“You went to fetch this cross you see here,” said the marquis to him. “I do not want to make you leave off your black suit, and I have got accustomed to the more amusing tone I have assumed with the man who wears the blue suit. So understand this until further orders. When I see this cross, you will be my friend, the Duke of Chaulne’s younger son, who has been employed in the diplomatic service the last six months without having any idea of it. Observe,” added the marquis very seriously, cutting short all manifestations of thanks, “that I do not want you to forget your place. That is always a mistake and a misfortune both for patron and for dependent. When my lawsuits bore you, or when you no longer suit me, I will ask a good living like that of our good friend the Abbé Pirard’s for you, and nothing more,” added the marquis dryly."
"Elle revenait du village. Elle était allée entendre la messe dans l’église de Vergy.

"Pendant vingt minutes, Julien parla sur ce ton; il dit tout ce qu’il avait sur le coeur; l’avocat général, qui aspirait aux faveurs de l’aristocratie, bondissait sur son siège; mais malgré le tour un peu abstrait que Julien avait donné à la discussion toutes les femmes fondaient en larmes.

"Julien ne pouvait douter de la sincérité de Mlle de La Mole l’accent de la vérité était trop évident dans tout ce qu’elle disait.

"— D’aucun, et c’est ce qui me perd. Voici toute ma politique: J’aime la musique, la peinture, un bon livre est un événement pour moi; je vais avoir quarante-quatre ans. Que me reste-t-il à vivre? Quinze, vingt trente ans tout au plus? Eh bien! je tiens que dans trente ans, les ministres seront un peu plus adroits, mais tout aussi honnêtes gens que ceux d’aujourd’hui. L’histoire d’Angleterre me sert de miroir pour notre avenir. Toujours il se trouvera un roi qui voudra augmenter sa prérogative; toujours l’ambition de devenir député la gloire et les centaines de mille francs gagnés par Mirabeau empêcheront de dormir les gens riches de la province: ils appelleront cela être libéral et aimer le peuple. Toujours l’envie de devenir pair ou gentilhomme de la Chambre galopera les ultras. Sur le vaisseau de l’État, tout le monde voudra s’occuper de la manoeuvre car elle est bien payée. N’y aura-t-il donc jamais une pauvre petite place pour le simple passager?","“None, and that’s what ruins me.

I believe that in thirty years, the ministers will be a little more skilful, but just as honest people as those of today. The history of England serves me as a mirror for our future. There will always be a king who will want to increase his prerogative; the ambition to become a deputy, glory and the hundreds of thousand francs earned by Mirabeau will keep the rich people of the provinces awake: they will call that being liberal and loving the people. Always the desire to become a peer or a gentleman of the Chamber will gallop the ultras. On the ship of state, everyone will want to take care of the maneuver because it is well paid. Will there never be a poor little place for the simple passenger?","“None, and that’s been my ruination. Here’s my politics: I love music, painting; a good book is sensational, for me; I’m going on forty-four. How much longer do I have? Fifteen—twenty—thirty years at the most. So! It strikes me that, in thirty years, government ministers will be a little smarter, but just as decent fellows as the ones we have now. English history, I think, is a mirror for looking into our future. There’ll always be a king trying to increase his power, and people trying to get into Parliament—and Mirabeau’s reputation, plus the hundreds of thousands of francs he made, will go on keeping rich provincials from sleeping at night. They’ll label themselves liberals, and claim they’re on the people’s side. There’ll always be right-wingers desperately trying to become noblemen, or gentlemen of the king’s chambers. When it comes to the Ship of State, everyone wants to steer, because the job pays so well. But will there ever be some little spot that’s open to an ordinary passenger?”","“To none and that’s what ruins me. That’s all there is to be said about my political life—I like music and painting. A good book is an event for me. I am going to be forty-four. How much longer have I got to live? Fifteen—twenty—thirty years at the outside. Well, I want the ministers in thirty years’ time to be a little cleverer than those of to-day but quite as honest. The history of England serves as a mirror for our own future. There will always be a king who will try to increase his prerogative. The ambition of becoming a deputy, the fame of Mirabeau and the hundreds of thousand francs which he won for himself will always prevent the rich people in the province from going to sleep; they will call that being Liberal and loving the people.

"Dans les moments où la présence d’enfants trop intelligents les réduisait à ne parler que le langage de la froide raison, c’était avec une docilité parfaite que Julien la regardant avec des yeux étincelants d’amour, écoutait ses explications du monde comme il va. Souvent, au milieu du récit de quelque friponnerie savante, à l’occasion d’un chemin ou d’une fourniture qui étonnait son esprit, l’attention de Mme de Rênal s’égarait tout à coup jusqu’au délire; Julien avait besoin de la gronder, elle se permettait avec lui les mêmes gestes intimes qu’avec ses enfants. C’est qu’il y avait des jours où elle avait l’illusion de l’aimer comme son enfant. Sans cesse n’avait-elle pas à répondre à ses questions naïves sur mille choses simples qu’un enfant bien né n’ignore pas à quinze ans? Un instant après, elle l’admirait comme son maître. Son génie allait jusqu’à l’effrayer; elle croyait apercevoir plus nettement chaque jour, le grand homme futur dans ce jeune abbé. Elle le voyait pape, elle le voyait premier ministre comme Richelieu.","At times when the presence of overly intelligent children reduced them to speaking only the language of cold reason, it was with perfect docility that Julien, looking at her with eyes sparkling with love, listened to her explanations of the world as he goes. Often, in the middle of the recital of some scholarly roguery, on the occasion of a path or a provision which astonished her mind, Madame de Rênal's attention would suddenly wander to the point of delirium; Julien needed to scold her, she allowed herself the same intimate gestures with him as with her children. It was because there were days when she had the illusion of loving him like her child. Didn't she constantly have to answer his naive questions about a thousand simple things that a well-born child knows at fifteen? A moment later, she admired him as her master. His genius went so far as to frighten him; she thought she perceived more clearly each day the future great man in this young abbé. She saw him as Pope, she saw him as Prime Minister like Richelieu.","When the presence of very perceptive children forced them to speak only in the language of cold reason, Julien watched her with the glowing eyes of love and, perfectly docile, listened as she explained how the world worked. Often, in the middle of her narrative of some masterly bit of knavery, having to do with constructing a road or providing supplies, Madame de Rênal would suddenly forget herself, losing control almost to the point of frenzy, and Julien would have to speak sharply to her, for she was allowing herself familiarities with him, exactly the sort of intimate gestures she used with the children. And there were days when she imagined loving him as if he were her child. Didn’t she always have to answer his simple-minded questions about a thousand elementary things, matters of which no well-born child of fifteen would be ignorant? The next minute, she adored him as her master. His genius almost frightened her: she thought herself able to see in this young ecclesiastic, each day more clearly, the great man of the future. She could see him as the pope, she could see him as prime minister, like de Richelieu.","On the occasions when the presence of the precocious children reduced them to speaking the language of cold reason, Julien looking at her with eyes sparkling with love, would listen with complete docility to her explanations of the world as it is. Frequently, in the middle of an account of some cunning piece of jobbery, with reference to a road or a contract, Madame de Rênal’s mind would suddenly wander to the very point of delirium. Julien found it necessary to scold her. She indulged when with him in the same intimate gestures which she used with her own children. The fact was that there were days when she deceived herself that she loved him like her own child. Had she not repeatedly to answer his naïve questions about a thousand simple things that a well-born child of fifteen knows quite well? An instant afterwards she would admire him like her master. His genius would even go so far as to frighten her. She thought she could see more clearly every day the future great man in this young Abbé.

"Pendant que Mme de Rênal était en proie à ce qu’a de plus cruel la passion terrible dans laquelle le hasard l’avait engagée, Julien poursuivait son chemin gaiement au milieu des plus beaux aspects que puissent présenter les scènes de montagnes.

Le sentier qu’il suivait, s’élevant peu à peu parmi de grands bois de hêtres, forme des zigzags infinis sur la pente de la haute montagne qui dessine au nord la vallée du Doubs. Bientôt les regards du voyageur, passant par-dessus les coteaux moins élevés qui contiennent le cours du Doubs vers le midi, s’étendirent jusqu’aux plaines fertiles de la Bourgogne et du Beaujolais. Quelque insensible que l’âme de ce jeune ambitieux fût à ce genre de beauté, il ne pouvait s’empêcher de s’arrêter de temps à autre, pour regarder un spectacle si vaste et si imposant.","While Madame de Rênal was a prey to the cruellest of the terrible passions into which chance had engaged her, Julien pursued his way gaily amidst the most beautiful aspects that mountain scenes can present. You had to cross the big chain north of Vergy. The path he was following, rising little by little among great beech woods, forms endless zigzags on the slope of the high mountain which outlines the valley of the Doubs to the north. Soon the gaze of the traveler, passing over the lower hills which contain the course of the Doubs towards the south, extended to the fertile plains of Burgundy and Beaujolais. However insensitive the soul of this ambitious young man was to this kind of beauty, he could not help stopping from time to time to gaze at such a vast and imposing spectacle.","While Madame de Rênal was lying, cruelly gripped by the dreadful passion into which chance had drawn her, Julien went cheerfully on his way, in the middle of the most gorgeous scenery mountains can offer. He had to cross the high range north of Vergy. The path he was following, which rose gradually through towering beech trees, zigzagged back and forth along the slopes of the prominent great mountain, north of the Doubs valley. Soon, as he passed above the lesser hills through which, on its way south, the Doubs flowed, he could see all the way to the fertile plains of Burgundy and Beaujolais. Although not markedly sensitive to this sort of beauty, the ambitious young man could not help stopping, from time to time, to contemplate so vast and imposing a spectacle.","While Madame de Rênal was a prey to all the poignancy of the terrible passion in which chance had involved her, Julien went merrily on his way, surrounded by the most beautiful views that mountain scenery can offer. He had to cross the great chain north of Vergy. The path which he followed rose gradually among the big beech woods, and ran into infinite spirals on the slope of the high mountain which forms the northern boundary of the Doubs valley. Soon the traveller’s view, as he passed over the lower slopes bounding the course of the Doubs towards the south, extends as far as the fertile plains of Burgundy and Beaujolais. However insensible was the soul of this ambitious youth to this kind of beauty, he could not help stopping from time to time to look at a spectacle at once so vast and so impressive."
"Et il se rappela quelques regards remplis de dédain, à lui adressés par Mme de La Mole, et surtout par les dames ses amies.","And he remembered a few looks filled with disdain, addressed to him by Madame de La Mole, and especially by the ladies of her friends.","And he recalled looks of disdain cast on him by Madame de La Mole, and especially by the ladies, her friends.","And he remembered certain disdainful looks which Madame de la Mole, and especially her lady friends, had favoured him with."
"— Souvenez-vous, monsieur, lui dit-elle, qu’il ne faut pas aimer Bonaparte quand on m’aime; on peut tout au plus l’accepter comme une nécessité imposée par la Providence. Du reste, cet homme n’avait pas l’âme assez flexible pour sentir les chefs-d’oeuvre des arts.","“Remember, sir,” she said to him, “one must not love Bonaparte when one loves me; one can at most accept it as a necessity imposed by Providence. Besides, this man did not have a soul flexible enough to feel the masterpieces of the arts.","The most I can allow is that they accept him as a necessity imposed by Providence. In any case, the man lacked a soul sufficiently flexible for appreciating artistic masterpieces.”","As he took leave of the maréchale in the vestibule of the opera, she said to him, “Remember, monsieur, one must not like Bonaparte if you like me; at the best he can only be accepted as a necessity imposed by Providence. Besides, the man did not have a sufficiently supple soul to appreciate masterpieces of art.”"

"Enfin il va me dire son secret, pensa Julien, le voilà qui me parle de lui; il y a épanchement. Mais rien d’imprudent ne fut dit par cet homme évidemment exalté. Et pourtant il a beaucoup travaillé, il est heureux, se dit Julien, le bon vin n’a pas été épargné. Quel homme! quel exemple pour moi! à lui le pompon. (C’était un mauvais mot qu’il tenait du vieux chirurgien.)","Anyway, he's going to tell me his secret, thought Julien, here he is talking to me about himself; there is an outpouring. But nothing rash was said by this evidently exalted man. And yet he has worked a lot, he is happy, says Julien, good wine has not been spared. What a man! what an example for me! to him the pompom. (It was a bad word he got from the old surgeon.)","“Finally,” thought Julien, “he’s going to tell me his secret. He’s telling me about himself, it’s pouring out of him. But even though he’s obviously excited, he hasn’t spoken a careless word. He’s worked hard, yes, and he’s happy,” Julien said to himself, “and he’s been putting away a lot of this first-class wine. What a man! What an example for me! He’s way ahead of all the others.” (He’d learned this slangy talk from the old surgeon-major.)","“So he is going to tell me his secret at last,” said Julien. “Now he is going to talk about himself. He is expanding.” But nothing imprudent was said by the man in spite of his evident exaltation. “All the same he has worked a great deal,” said Julien to himself. “He is happy. What a man! What an example for me! He really takes the cake.” (This was a vulgar phrase which he had learned from the old surgeon)."
"Il serait plaisant qu’elle m’aimât! Qu’elle m’aime ou non, continuait Julien, j’ai pour confidente intime une fille d’esprit, devant laquelle je vois trembler toute la maison, et, plus que tous les autres, le marquis de Croisenois. Ce jeune homme si poli, si doux, si brave, et qui réunit tous les avantages de naissance et de fortune dont un seul me mettrait le coeur si à l’aise! Il en est amoureux fou, c’est-à-dire autant qu’un Parisien peut être amoureux, il doit l’épouser. Que de lettres M. de la Mole m’a fait écrire aux deux notaires pour arranger le contrat! Et moi qui me vois, le matin, si subalterne la plume à la main, deux heures après, ici dans le jardin, je triomphe de ce jeune homme si aimable, car enfin, les préférences sont frappantes, directes. Peut-être aussi elle hait en lui un mari futur. Elle a assez de hauteur pour cela. Et alors, les bontés qu’elle a pour moi, je les obtiens à titre de confident subalterne!","It would be nice if she loved me! Whether she loves me or not, continued Julien, my intimate confidant is a clever girl, before whom I see the whole house tremble, and, more than all the others, the Marquis de Croisenois. This young man, so polite, so gentle, so brave, and who combines all the advantages of birth and fortune, a single one of which would put my heart so at ease! He is madly in love with her, that is to say as much as a Parisian can be in love, he must marry her. How many letters M. de la Mole had me write to the two notaries to arrange the contract! And I who see myself, in the morning, so subaltern with pen in hand, two hours later, here in the garden, I triumph over this young man who is so amiable, because after all, the preferences are striking, direct. Perhaps she also hates him as a future husband. She has enough height for that. And then, the kindnesses she has for me, I obtain them as a subordinate confidant!","“It would be a good joke, if she loved me! But whether she does or she doesn’t,” Julien went on, “I have for my friend a girl who’s intelligent, in front of whom the whole house trembles, and most of all the Marquis de Croisenois—that infinitely polished young man, so gentle, so courageous, who has all the advantages of birth and fortune, either one of which would put my heart so completely at ease! He’s wildly in love; he’ll surely marry her. Just consider all the letters Monsieur de La Mole has had me write to the lawyers on both sides, to settle the terms of the marriage contract! And I, who see myself so much the underling, with my pen in my hand, here I am, two hours later, in the garden again, victorious over this fine, good young man—for her preference is striking, utterly plain to see. And perhaps she dislikes him as a possible husband. She’s arrogant enough for that. And all the kindnesses she shows me, they come to me in my role as an employee-confidant!","“It would be humorous if she loved me but whether she loves me or not,” went on Julien, “I have for my confidential friend a girl of spirit before whom I see the whole household quake, while the Marquis de Croisenois does so more than anyone else. Yes, to be sure, that same young man who is so polite, so gentle, and so brave, and who has combined all those advantages of birth and fortune a single one of which would put my heart at rest—he is madly in love with her, he ought to marry her. How many letters has M. de la Mole made me write to the two notaries in order to arrange the contract? And I, though I am an absolute inferior when I have my pen in my hand, why, I triumph over that young man two hours afterwards in this very garden; for, after all, her preference is striking and direct. Perhaps she hates him because she sees in him a future husband. She is haughty enough for that. As for her kindness to me, I receive it in my capacity of confidential servant."
"Ce refus de tutoiement, cette façon brusque de briser un lien si tendre, et sur lequel il comptait encore, portèrent jusqu’au délire le transport d’amour de Julien.","This refusal to use familiarity, this sudden way of breaking such a tender bond, one on which he still counted, carried Julien's transport of love to the point of delirium.","These rejections, this sharp way of snapping so tender a tie, one he still counted on, drove Julien almost to the height of passionate delirium.","This refusal of all endearments, this abrupt way of breaking so tender a tie which he thought still subsisted, carried the transports of Julien’s love to the point of delirium."

"C’était pendant que ces grandes incertitudes agitaient Mathilde, que Julien ne comprenait pas ses longs regards qui s’arrêtaient sur lui. Il trouvait bien un redoublement de froideur dans les manières du comte Norbert, et un nouvel accès de hauteur dans celles de MM. de Caylus, de Luz et de Croisenois. Il y était accoutumé. Ce malheur lui arrivait quelquefois à la suite d’une soirée où il avait brillé plus qu’il ne convenait à sa position. Sans l’accueil particulier que lui faisait Mathilde, et la curiosité que tout cet ensemble lui inspirait, il eût évité de suivre au jardin ces brillants jeunes gens à moustaches, lorsque, les après-dîners, ils y accompagnaient Mlle de La Mole.","It was while these great uncertainties were agitating Mathilde that Julien did not understand her long gaze which rested on him. He found a redoubling of coldness in the manners of Count Norbert, and a new access of haughtiness in those of MM. of Caylus, Luz and Croisenois. He was used to it. This misfortune sometimes befell him after an evening when he had shone more than was befitting his position. If it hadn't been for the special welcome given him by Mathilde, and the curiosity which this whole ensemble inspired in him, he would have avoided following these brilliant young men with mustaches into the garden when, after dinner, they accompanied Mademoiselle de La Mole there.","While Mathilde was struggling with these intense doubts, Julien was bewildered by the long, lingering glances she lavished on him. He was experiencing vastly increased coldness from Count Norbert, and new onslaughts of arrogance from Messieurs de Caylus, de Luz, and de Croisenois. He was used to that. Sometimes it happened on days when, the evening before, he’d been more brilliant than suited his position. Without the unusual reception Mathilde gave him, and the curiosity inspired in him by this entire circle of young aristocrats, he would have refrained from following the shining young fellows with mustaches into the garden, after dinner, as they went walking with Mademoiselle de la Mole.","It was while Mathilde was a prey to these great fits of uncertainty that Julien was baffled by those long looks of hers which lingered upon him. He noticed, no doubt, an increased frigidity in the manner of Comte Norbert, and a fresh touch of haughtiness in the manner of MM. de Caylus, de Luz and de Croisenois. He was accustomed to that. He would sometimes be their victim in this way at the end of an evening when, in view of the position he occupied, he had been unduly brilliant. Had it not been for the especial welcome with which Mathilde would greet him, and the curiosity with which all this society inspired him, he would have avoided following these brilliant moustachioed young men into the garden, when they accompanied Mademoiselle de la Mole there, in the hour after dinner."

"Julien était à six pas du roi, qui réellement priait avec abandon. Il remarqua, pour la première fois, un petit homme au regard spirituel et qui portait un habit presque sans broderies. Mais il avait un cordon bleu de ciel par-dessus cet habit fort simple. Il était plus près du roi que beaucoup d’autres seigneurs, dont les habits étaient tellement brodés d’or, que, suivant l’expression de Julien, on ne voyait pas le drap. Il apprit quelques moments après, que c’était M. de La Mole. Il lui trouva l’air hautain et même insolent.","Julien was six paces from the king, who was really praying with abandon.

He learned a few moments later that it was M. de La Mole. He found her to look haughty and even insolent.","Julien was six paces away from the king, who in fact was praying fervently. Then he noticed, for the first time, a little man with a spiritual face, wearing virtually no ornaments. But there was a sky blue decoration underneath his very plain garments. Julien was closer to him than he was to most of the other lords, whose clothing was so heavily ornamented that—as Julien put it—the cloth itself could not be seen. This little man, as he soon learned, was Monsieur de La Mole. He struck Julien as proud and even arrogant.","Julien was six paces from the King, who was really praying with devotion. He noticed for the first time a little man with a witty expression, who wore an almost plain suit. But he had a sky-blue ribbon over this very simple suit.

He learnt some minutes later that it was Monsieur de la Mole. He thought he looked haughty, and even insolent."
"Cet amour, loin de s’éteindre comme il l’espérait, fit des progrès rapides. Elle est folle il est vrai, se disait-il en est-elle moins adorable? est-il possible d’être plus jolie? Tout ce que la civilisation la plus élégante peut présenter de vifs plaisirs, n’était-il pas réuni comme à l’envi chez Mlle de La Mole? Ces souvenirs de bonheur passé s’emparaient de Julien, et détruisaient rapidement tout l’ouvrage de la raison.","This love, far from dying out as he had hoped, made rapid progress. She's crazy, it's true, he said to himself, is she less adorable for that? is it possible to be prettier? All that the most elegant civilization can present lively pleasures, was it not united as one could wish at Mlle de La Mole? These memories of past happiness seized Julien, and quickly destroyed all the work of reason.","This love, far from flickering out, as he had hoped it would, made rapid progress. “She’s crazy, of course she is,” he told himself. “But does that make her less adorable? Is it possible to be prettier? Isn’t every vivid pleasure the most elegant of civilizations can offer—isn’t all of it absolutely, perfectly united in Mademoiselle de La Mole?” These memories of past happiness overwhelmed Julien, and rapidly tore down what reason had tried to erect.","Far, however, from being extinguished as he had hoped it would be, his love grew more and more rapidly. “She is mad, it is true,” he said to himself. “Is she any the less adorable for that? Is it possible for anyone to be prettier? Is not Mademoiselle de la Mole the ideal quintessence of all the most vivid pleasures of the most elegant civilisation?” These memories of a bygone happiness seized hold of Julien’s mind, and quickly proceeded to destroy all the work of his reason."
"Quand il avait cru voir que Mlle de La Mole traitait bien son prétendu, en rentrant chez lui, Julien ne pouvait s’empêcher de regarder ses pistolets avec amour.","When he thought he saw that Mademoiselle de La Mole was treating her suitor well, on returning home, Julien could not help gazing lovingly at his pistols.","When he’d seen Mademoiselle de La Mole treating her future husband particularly well, Julien would return to his room, unable to keep from loving glances at his pistols.","When he thought he had noticed that Mademoiselle de la Mole was beginning to encourage her intended, Julien could not help looking tenderly at his pistols as he went up to his room."

Yet these children, so eminently accomplished at fifteen, at eighteen turn common. The passionate shyness one finds in the provinces sometimes rises above itself, and then it shapes the will. Approaching this very pretty girl, who’d taken the trouble to speak to him, Julien—becoming courageous, precisely because he’d overcome shyness—thought: “I have to tell her the truth.”","What pity will not our provincial inspire in the young lycée scholars of Paris, who, at the early age of fifteen, know already how to enter a café with so distinguished an air?

"Julien avait attaché la corde au dernier échelon de l’échelle, il la descendait doucement, et en se penchant beaucoup en dehors du balcon pour faire en sorte qu’elle ne touchât pas les vitres.

"Même quand elle n’eut plus rien à lui refuser, elle repoussait Julien loin d’elle, avec une indignation réelle, et ensuite se jetait dans ses bras. Aucun projet ne paraissait dans toute cette conduite. Elle se croyait damnée sans rémission, et cherchait à se cacher la vue de l’enfer, en accablant Julien des plus vives caresses. En un mot, rien n’eût manqué au bonheur de notre héros, pas même une sensibilité brûlante dans la femme qu’il venait d’enlever, s’il eût su en jouir.

"— Puisque vous ne vous ennuyez pas trop dans les visites que vous avez la bonté de faire à un pauvre vieillard malade, lui dit le marquis, il faudrait lui parler de tous les petits incidents de votre vie, mais franchement et sans songer à autre chose qu’à raconter clairement et d’une façon amusante. Car il faut s’amuser continua le marquis; il n’y a que cela de réel dans la vie. Un homme ne peut pas me sauver la vie à la guerre tous les jours, ou me faire tous les jours cadeau d’un million; mais si j’avais Rivarol, ici, auprès de ma chaise longue, tous les jours il m’ôterait une heure de souffrances et d’ennui. Je l’ai beaucoup vu à Hambourg, pendant l’émigration.","""Since you don't get too bored visiting a poor sick old man,"" said the marquis, ""you should talk to him about all the little incidents of your life, but frankly and without thinking of anything else."" only to be told clearly and in an amusing way. For one must amuse oneself, continued the marquis; that is all that is real in life. A man can't save my life in war every day, or give me a million every day; but if I had Rivarol, here, by my chaise-longue, every day it would save me an hour of suffering and boredom. I saw him a lot in Hamburg, during the emigration.","“Seeing that you’re not too profoundly bored, making these kind visits to a poor old man,” the marquis told him, “why don’t you tell him all the trifling episodes of your life, but straightforwardly and without thinking about anything except telling them clearly and in such a fashion that they’ll be entertaining? Entertainment is essential,” the marquis continued. “That’s life’s only reality. A man can hardly save my life each and every day, or be perpetually giving me gifts of a million francs. But if I had old Rivarol here, every day, right here next to my couch, he’d take away an hour of boredom and pain. I knew him well, in Hamburg, when we were in exile.”","“As you are not exactly bored,” said the marquis to him, “by these visits which you are kind enough to pay to a poor old man, you must tell him about all the little incidents of your life, but you must be frank and think of nothing except narrating them clearly and in an amusing way. For one must amuse oneself,” continued the marquis. “That’s the only reality in life. I can’t have my life saved in a battle every day, or get a present of a million francs every day, but if I had Rivarol here by my sofa, he would rid me every day of an hour of suffering and boredom. I saw a lot of him at Hamburg during the emigration.”"

"L’autre incident qui fut bien autrement sensible à Julien, vint de Mme de Rênal.

I don't know what intriguing friend had succeeded in persuading this naive and timid soul that it was her duty to leave for Saint-Cloud, and go and throw herself at the knees of King Charles X.",". . .” The other episode, which was far more painful to Julien, stemmed from Madame de Rênal.

"— Rien de plus facile, ce me semble, que de résumer notre position, dit le jeune évêque d’Agde, avec le feu concentré et contraint du fanatisme le plus exalté.

By this point, his soul was bubbling over like lava at Vesuvius.","“Nothing is easier, it seems to me, than summing up our position,” said the young bishop of Agde, with the restrained concentrated fire of the most exalted fanaticism.

"Le voir, le tirer par sa grande jaquette, le faire tomber de son siège et l’accabler de coups de cravache ne fut que l’affaire d’un instant.

Everyone agrees on the vast intelligence, and even more on the good sense, of this happy man you are shielding. What could be simpler than to hide himself in Monsieur de Rênal’s gardens, which he knew so well? There, with the virtual certainty of not being seen, or arrested, or even suspected, he could have killed the woman who had made him so jealous.”","“Why,” he added, as he fixed his ardent eyes upon Mathilde, “should M. Sorel have chosen the church, if it were not for the reason that his rival was celebrating mass in it at that very moment?

"Julien finit par être profondément frappé des embrassements sans chaleur de ce cadavre vivant; il ne put penser à autre chose pendant plusieurs lieues.

"Le percepteur des contributions, l’homme des impositions indirectes, l’officier de gendarmerie, et deux ou trois autres fonctionnaires publics arrivèrent avec leurs femmes.

Accordingly, Julien regularly brought along an account book, in which he wrote down his orders, and the marquis initialed them.

"Mme de Rênal avait monté en courant les cent vingt marches du colombier, elle attachait le coin d’un mouchoir blanc à l’un des barreaux de fer de la petite fenêtre. Elle était la plus heureuse des femmes. Les larmes aux yeux, elle regardait vers les grands bois de la montagne. Sans doute, se disait-elle, de dessous un de ces hêtres touffus, Julien épie ce signal heureux. Longtemps elle prêta l’oreille, ensuite elle maudit le bruit monotone des cigales et le chant des oiseaux. Sans ce bruit importun, un cri de joie, parti des grandes roches, aurait pu arriver jusqu’ici. Son oeil avide dévorait cette pente immense de verdure sombre et unie comme un pré, que forme le sommet des arbres. Comment n’a-t-il pas l’esprit, se dit-elle tout attendrie d’inventer quelque signal pour me dire que son bonheur est égal au mien?

She was the happiest of women. With tears in her eyes, she looked towards the great woods of the mountain. No doubt, she said to herself, from under one of those thick beeches Julien is spying on this happy signal. For a long time she listened, then she cursed the monotonous sound of cicadas and the chirping of birds. Without this annoying noise, a cry of joy, starting from the big rocks, could have reached here. His avid eye devoured this immense slope of dark greenery, smooth as a meadow, which forms the tops of the trees.

"Les nuits de ces deux êtres furent bien différentes. Mme de Rênal était exaltée par les transports de la volupté morale la plus élevée.

Elle se vit aussi heureuse dans dix ans qu’elle l’était en ce moment. L’idée même de la vertu et de la fidélité jurée à M. de Rênal, qui l’avait agitée quelques jours auparavant, se présenta en vain, on la renvoya comme un hôte importun.

"— Je veux absolument prendre chez moi Sorel le fils du scieur de planches, dit M. de Rênal, il surveillera les enfants, qui commencent à devenir trop diables pour nous. C’est un jeune prêtre, ou autant vaut, bon latiniste, et qui fera faire des progrès aux enfants, car il a un caractère ferme, dit le curé. Je lui donnerai trois cents francs et la nourriture. J’avais quelques doutes sur sa moralité; car il était le benjamin de ce vieux chirurgien, membre de la Légion d’honneur, qui, sous prétexte qu’il était leur cousin, était venu se mettre en pension chez les Sorel. Cet homme pouvait fort bien n’être au fond qu’un agent secret des libéraux, il disait que l’air de nos montagnes faisait du bien à son asthme; mais c’est ce qui n’est pas prouvé. Il avait fait toutes les campagnes de Buonaparté en Italie; et même avait, dit-on, signé non pour l’Empire dans le temps. Ce libéral montrait le latin au fils Sorel et lui a laissé cette quantité de livres qu’il avait apportés avec lui. Aussi n’aurais-je jamais songé à mettre le fils du charpentier auprès de nos enfants; mais le curé, justement la veille de la scène qui vient de nous brouiller à jamais, m’a dit que ce Sorel étudie la théologie depuis trois ans, avec le projet d’entrer au séminaire; il n’est donc pas libéral, et il est latiniste.","""I absolutely want to take Sorel, the sawyer's son, into my house,"" said M. de Rênal. ""He will watch the children, who are beginning to become too devilish for us."" He is a young priest, or as much is worth, good Latinist, and who will make progress with the children, because he has a firm character, says the priest. I'll give him three hundred francs and food. I had some doubts about his morality; for he was the youngest child of that old surgeon, a member of the Legion of Honor, who, on the pretext that he was their cousin, had come to board with the Sorels. This man could very well be basically only a secret agent of the liberals, he said that the air of our mountains was good for his asthma; but that is unproven. He had made all the campaigns of Buonaparté in Italy; and even had, it is said, signed no for the Empire at the time. This liberal showed Latin to young Sorel and left him this quantity of books that he had brought with him. So I would never have dreamed of putting the carpenter's son with our children; but the priest, just the day before the scene which has just embroiled us forever, told me that this Sorel has been studying theology for three years, with plans to enter the seminary; he is therefore not a liberal, and he is a Latinist.","“I’ve really got to bring that Sorel into the house,” said Monsieur de Rênal. “The sawmill operator’s son. He’ll keep an eye on the children: they’re getting to be too much for you. He’s a young priest, or very nearly, an expert Latinist, and he’ll help the children make good progress, because Father Chélan tells me he’s a solid sort. I’ll give him three hundred francs and his board. “I had some doubts on the question of morality, because Sorel was the favorite of that old surgeon, the one who was a member of the Legion of Honor and who came to live with the Sorels, under the pretense that he was actually related to the family. The man might very well have been, after all, a secret agent for the liberals. He used to say that our mountain air was good for his asthma, but who knows if that was true or not? He was with Buonoparté on all his Italian campaigns, and once, I’ve heard, he even voted against the Empire. This liberal taught Latin to young Sorel, and left him all the books he’d brought with him. “Also, I would never have dreamed of having someone right out of a sawmill here in the house, around our children, but Father Chélan—actually, just the night before the quarrel that has estranged us forever—told me Sorel had been studying theology for three years, planning to enter the seminary, so he’s no liberal: he’s a Latinist.","“I really mean to take Sorel, the son of the sawyer, into the house,” said M. de Rênal; “he will look after the children, who are getting too naughty for us to manage. He is a young priest, or as good as one, a good Latin scholar, and will make the children get on. According to the curé, he has a steady character. I will give him three hundred francs a year and his board. I have some doubts as to his morality, for he used to be the favourite of that old Surgeon-Major, Member of the Legion of Honour, who went to board with the Sorels, on the pretext that he was their cousin. It is quite possible that that man was really simply a secret agent of the Liberals. He said that the mountain air did his asthma good, but that is something which has never been proved. He has gone through all Buonaparte’s campaigns in Italy, and had even, it was said, voted against the Empire in the plebiscite. This Liberal taught the Sorel boy Latin, and left him a number of books which he had brought with him. Of course, in the ordinary way, I should have never thought of allowing a carpenter’s son to come into contact with our children, but the curé told me, the very day before the scene which has just estranged us for ever, that Sorel has been studying theology for three years with the intention of entering a seminary. He is, consequently, not a Liberal, and he certainly is a good Latin scholar."
"Elle se garda de répondre, et se hâta de plaisanter son frère et le marquis de Croisenois sur la peur que leur faisait l’énergie.

It is basically only the fear of encountering the unforeseen, the fear of remaining short in the presence of the unforeseen...","She stopped herself from answering, and quickly began to tease both her brother and the Marquis de Croisenois about how afraid they were of anything or anyone energetic. At bottom, this was simply fear of encountering the unexpected, the terror of falling short in its presence.","She was careful not to answer, but hastened to rally her brother and the Marquis de Croisenois on the apprehension which energy caused them. “It is at bottom simply the fear of meeting the unexpected, the fear of being non-plussed in the presence of the unexpected—”"

They’d be more serious.”","He was going to write a countermanding letter to Fouqué when eleven o’clock struck. He noisily turned the lock of the door of his room as though he had locked himself in. He went with a sleuth-like step to observe what was happening over the house, especially on the fourth storey where the servants slept. There was nothing unusual. One of Madame de la Mole’s chambermaids was giving an entertainment; the servants were taking punch with much gaiety. “Those who laugh like that,” thought Julien, “cannot be participating in the nocturnal expedition; if they were, they would be more serious.”"
"Cette découverte, qui dans tout autre moment l’aurait plongée dans les remords et dans une agitation profonde ne fut pour elle qu’un spectacle singulier, mais comme indifférent. Son âme, épuisée par tout ce qu’elle venait d’éprouver, n’avait plus de sensibilité au service des passions.","This discovery, which at any other time would have plunged her into remorse and deep agitation, was for her only a singular spectacle, but as it were indifferent. Her soul, exhausted by all she had just experienced, had no longer any sensibility in the service of the passions.","At any other time, this discovery would have plunged her into all manner of repentance and a profound agitation, but now it seemed to her no more than a bizarre display, but of no particular significance. Her soul, exhausted by all she’d been going through, had no spark of sensitivity to enlist in passion’s cause.","This discovery, which at any other time would have plunged her into remorse and the deepest agitation, now only produced the effect of a singular, but as it were, indifferent spectacle. Her soul was exhausted by all that she had just gone through, and had no more sensibility to passion left."
"Ce mot rendit toute son activité à l’âme de Julien. On a voulu me perdre auprès de la maréchale; on lui a dit mon enthousiasme pour Napoléon. Ce fait l’a assez piquée pour qu’elle cède à la tentation de me le faire sentir. Cette découverte l’amusa toute la soirée, et le rendit amusant. Comme il prenait congé de la maréchale sous le vestibule de l’Opéra:","This word restored all its activity to Julien's soul. They wanted to lose me with the marshal; he was told of my enthusiasm for Napoleon. This fact stung her enough that she yielded to the temptation to make me feel it. This discovery amused him all evening, and made him amusing. As he took leave of the Maréchale in the vestibule of the Opera:","This observation restored full vigor to Julien’s soul. “Someone has been trying to ruin me with Madame de Fervaques. She’s been told of my enthusiasm for Napoleon. It annoys her enough so she’s willing to give in and show me her annoyance.” The realization amused him, all night long, and made him entertaining. As he was taking leave of her, in the opera lobby: “Remember, sir,” she told him, “that people who love me cannot also love Bonaparte.","The word Bonaparte restored to Julien all the activity of his mind. “They have tried to ruin me with the maréchale; they have told her of my enthusiasm for Napoleon. This fact has sufficiently piqued her to make her yield to the temptation to make me feel it.” This discovery amused him all the evening, and rendered him amusing. As he took leave of the maréchale in the vestibule of the opera, she said to him, “Remember, monsieur, one must not like Bonaparte if you like me; at the best he can only be accepted as a necessity imposed by Providence."
— C’est là ta physionomie d’autrefois! dit Julien ravi. Mais il faut passer dans la chambre du domestique.,"""That's your old face!"" says Julien delighted. But you have to go to the servant's room.","“But you’ll have to go through the valet’s bedroom,” said Julien, astonished.","“But you will have to pass through the servants’ room,” said Julien in astonishment."
"— Répondez-moi, du moins, dit enfin Mathilde du ton de voix le plus suppliant, mais sans oser regarder Julien. Vous savez bien que j’ai de l’orgueil; c’est le malheur de ma position et même de mon caractère, je l’avouerai; Mme de Fervaques m’a donc enlevé votre coeur… A-t-elle fait pour vous tous les sacrifices où ce fatal amour m’a entraînée?","""Answer me, at least,"" said Mathilde at last in the most pleading tone of voice, but without daring to look at Julien. You know very well that I have pride; it is the misfortune of my position and even of my character, I will admit it; Madame de Fervaques therefore took your heart away from me. Has she made for you all the sacrifices into which this fatal love has dragged me?","“At least answer me,” Mathilde said at last, in the most suppliant of voices, not yet daring to look at Julien. “You know very well how proud I am: it’s the sickness of my position, and even of my character. I admit it. So Madame de Fervaques has stolen your heart from me. . . . Has she made the same sacrifices for you, as this fatal love swept me into doing?”","“At least answer me,” Mathilde said at last, in the most supplicatory tone, but without daring to look at Julien: “You know how proud I am. It is the misfortune of my position, and of my temperament, too, I confess. Has Madame de Fervaques robbed me of your heart? Has she made the sacrifices to which my fatal love swept me?”"
Dans un moment d’attendrissement:,In a moment of tenderness:,"Once, in a tender moment:","“Here,” he said to his daughter in a moment of emotion, “is a gift of ten thousand francs a year."

L’impassible froideur de Julien redoubla le malheur d’orgueil qui déchirait l’âme de Mlle de La Mole.

"On entrait dans l’église par une porte latérale; tout à coup un bruit épouvantable fit retentir ses voûtes antiques Julien crut qu’elles s’écroulaient. C’était encore la petite pièce de canon; traînée par huit chevaux au galop, elle venait d’arriver; et à peine arrivée, mise en batterie par les canonniers de Leipzig, elle tirait cinq coups par minute, comme si les Prussiens eussent été devant elle.","One entered the church by a side door; suddenly a terrible noise resounded in its ancient vaults, Julien thought they were collapsing. It was still the small piece of cannon; dragged by eight galloping horses, she had just arrived; and as soon as it arrived, placed in battery by the gunners of Leipsic, it fired five shots a minute, as if the Prussians had been in front of it.","They entered the cloister through a side door. Suddenly a terrible noise shook the church’s ancient vaults; Julien thought they might collapse. But it was the old cannon, once again. Pulled by eight galloping horses, it had just arrived, and, barely on the ground, had been quickly maneuvered into position by the cannoneers of Leipzig, who were firing five times a minute, just as if they were facing the Prussians.",They entered the church by a side door; suddenly an awful noise made the ancient walls echo. Julien thought they were going to crumble. It was the little piece of artillery again. It had been drawn at a gallop by eight horses and had just arrived. Immediately on its arrival it had been run out by the Leipsic cannoneers and fired five shots a minute as though the Prussians had been the target.
"S’entendre appeler de nouveau monsieur, bien sérieusement, et par une dame si bien vêtue était au-dessus de toutes les prévisions de Julien: dans tous les châteaux en Espagne de sa jeunesse, il s’était dit qu’aucune dame comme il faut ne daignerait lui parler que quand il aurait un bel uniforme. Mme de Rênal de son côté était complètement trompée par la beauté du teint, les grands yeux noirs de Julien et ses jolis cheveux qui frisaient plus qu’à l’ordinaire parce que pour se rafraîchir il venait de plonger la tête dans le bassin de la fontaine publique. A sa grande joie elle trouvait l’air timide d’une jeune fille à ce fatal précepteur, dont elle avait tant redouté pour ses enfants la dureté et le ton rébarbatif. Pour l’âme si paisible de Mme de Rênal, le contraste de ses craintes et de ce qu’elle voyait fut un grand événement. Enfin elle revint de sa surprise. Elle fut étonnée de se trouver ainsi à la porte de sa maison avec ce jeune homme presque en chemise et si près de lui.","To hear himself called monsieur again, very seriously, and by a lady so well dressed was beyond all Julien's expectations: in all the castles in Spain of his youth, he had said to himself that no lady like him you wouldn't deign to speak to him until he had a nice uniform. Mme de Rênal, for her part, was completely deceived by the beauty of Julien's complexion, his big black eyes and his pretty hair, which was curly more than usual because to cool off he had just plunged his head into the basin of the public fountain. To her great joy she found the timid air of a young girl in this fatal tutor, whose harshness and forbidding tone she had so dreaded for her children. For Madame de Rênal's peaceful soul, the contrast between her fears and what she saw was a great event. Finally she recovered from her surprise. She was surprised to find herself thus at the door of her house with this young man almost in his shirt and so close to him.","Hearing himself again spoken to as “sir,” and perfectly seriously, and by a lady so elegantly dressed, went beyond any of Julien’s expectations: even in the castles in Spain he’d built as a child, he’d never contemplated that any lady of fashion would condescend to speak to him at all, until he was wearing a handsome uniform. For her part, Madame de Rênal was utterly beguiled by his fine complexion, his great black eyes, and his lovely hair, which was curlier than most men’s—since, to freshen up, he’d just plunged his head into the waters of the public fountain. To her deep pleasure, she’d seen the shy demeanor of a young girl in this fateful tutor, though on her children’s account she’d dreaded his harsh surliness. For so quiet and peaceful a soul as Madame de Rênal, the contrast between her fears and the reality she saw in front of her was a great event. She finally recovered from her surprise. She was amazed to find herself standing at the door to her own house, so close to a young man virtually in his shirtsleeves.","To hear himself called “Monsieur” again in all seriousness by so well dressed a lady was beyond all Julien’s expectations. He had always said to himself in all the castles of Spain that he had built in his youth, that no real lady would ever condescend to talk to him except when he had a fine uniform. Madame de Rênal, on her side, was completely taken in by Julien’s beautiful complexion, his big black eyes, and his pretty hair, which was more than usually curly, because he had just plunged his head into the basin of the public fountain in order to refresh himself. She was over-joyed to find that this sinister tutor, whom she had feared to find so harsh and severe to her children, had, as a matter of fact, the timid manner of a girl. The contrast between her fears and what she now saw, proved a great event for Madame de Rênal’s peaceful temperament. Finally, she recovered from her surprise. She was astonished to find herself at the gate of her own house talking in this way and at such close quarters to this young and somewhat scantily dressed man."
"Julien ne vit dans tout cela que la petitesse d’esprit d’un bourgeois de campagne. Il allait enfin paraître sur le théâtre des grandes choses. Il aimait mieux moins de certitude et des chances plus vastes. Dans ce coeur-là il n’y avait plus la moindre peur de mourir de faim. Le bonheur d’aller à Paris, qu’il se figurait peuplé de gens d’esprit fort intrigants, fort hypocrites, mais aussi polis que l’évêque de Besançon et que l’évêque d’Agde, éclipsait tout à ses yeux. Il se représenta humblement à son ami, comme privé de son libre arbitre par la lettre de l’abbé Pirard.","Julien saw in all this only the small-mindedness of a country bourgeois. He was finally about to appear on the stage of great things. He preferred less certainty and greater chances. In that heart there was no longer the slightest fear of dying of hunger.

He humbly represented himself to his friend, as deprived of his free will by Abbé Pirard's letter.","All Julien saw in this was the petty spirit of a provincial bourgeois. He was finally going to make his appearance in the theater of great events. The happiness of going to Paris—which he imagined peopled by cleverly scheming minds, distinctly hypocritical, but as polished as the Bishop of Besançon, or the Bishop of Agde—overshadowed thoughts of anything else. He explained to his friend that Father Pirard’s letter left him no other choice.","Julien saw nothing in this except the pettiness of spirit of a country bourgeois. At last he was going to make an appearance in the theatre of great events.

She’s no longer acting in her comedy; she can allow herself to listen to her heart. Accordingly, two letters a day.”","“So we are quite agreed,” he repeated to Julien for the tenth time. “When you talk to the young beauty, I mean the daughter of the Strasbourg stocking merchant in the presence of Madame de Dubois, not a trace of passion.

"Julien fut sur le point d’accepter; mais son devoir le rappelait auprès du grand personnage, en quittant Korasoff, il promit d’écrire. Il reçut la réponse à la note secrète qu’il avait apportée, et courut vers Paris; mais à peine eut-il été seul deux jours de suite, que quitter la France et Mathilde lui parut un supplice pire que la mort.

"Une heure ne s’était pas écoulée, qu’à son grand étonnement, il découvrit que Mme de Rênal lui faisait mystère de quelque chose. Elle interrompait ses conversations avec son mari dès qu’il paraissait et semblait presque désirer qu’il s’éloignât. Julien né se fit pas donner deux fois cet avis. Il devint froid et réservé; Mme de Rênal s’en aperçut et ne chercha pas d’explication. Va-t-elle me donner un successeur? pensa Julien. Avant-hier encore, si intime avec moi!

C’est comme les rois, jamais plus de prévenances qu’au ministre qui, en rentrant chez lui, va trouver sa lettre de disgrâce.","An hour had not elapsed when, to his great astonishment, he discovered that Madame de Rênal was keeping something secret from him.

It's like kings, never more thoughtful than to the minister who, on returning home, will find his letter of disgrace.","They had not been there an hour when, to his great surprise, Julien learned that Madame de Rênal was keeping something secret from him. She broke off her conversations with her husband, whenever he appeared, and almost seemed anxious for him to go away. There was no need to give that warning twice, not to Julien. He became distant, reserved; though Madame de Rênal was aware of it, she made no attempt to explain. “Am I to have a successor?” Julien thought. “Just two days ago she was exceedingly friendly! But I’ve heard that’s how these great ladies operate. They’re like kings: a government minister, without any warning, comes home after seeing his lord, and his letter of dismissal is there waiting for him.”","An hour had not passed before he discovered to his great surprise that Madame de Rênal had some mystery up her sleeve. Whenever he came into the room she would break off her conversation with her husband and would almost seem to desire that he should go away. Julien did not need to be given this hint twice. He became cold and reserved. Madame de Rênal noticed it and did not ask for an explanation. “Is she going to give me a successor,” thought Julien. “And to think of her being so familiar with me the day before yesterday, but that is how these great ladies are said to act. It’s just like kings. One never gets any more warning than the disgraced minister who enters his house to find his letter of dismissal.”"
"Mlle de La Mole insista pour ramener Julien à l’hôtel. Heureusement il pleuvait beaucoup.

"Toutefois, Julien avait des Journées affreuses. C’était pour accomplir le plus pénible des devoirs qu’il paraissait chaque jour dans le salon de la maréchale.

"L’air de malheur et de passion profonde avec lequel le pauvre garçon m’a dit ce mot d’amour naïf, au jardin, il y a huit jours, le prouve de reste, il faut convenir que j’ai été bien extraordinaire de me fâcher d’un mot où brillaient tant de respect, tant de passion. Ne suis-je pas sa femme? Son mot était naturel, et, il faut l’avouer, il était bien aimable.

Julien still loved me after eternal conversations, in which I had spoken to him, and with a great deal of cruelty I admit, only of the inclinations for love that the boredom of the life I lead had inspired in me for these young people of whose society he is so jealous. Ah! if he only knew how little danger they are to him! how with him they seem to me withered and pale copies of each other.","“The wretched look, the profound passion with which the poor fellow told me he loved me, a week ago, surely proves it. Yes, it’s true, it was quite extraordinary how I flared up at words so glowing with respect, and spoken with such passion. I’m his wife, am I not? What he said was perfectly reasonable and , I must say, I found it pleasant. Julien still loves me, even after those endless conversations when all I talked to him about, and so cruelly—I agree—were just vague stirrings of love, born out of the boredom of my existence, love that I imagined I felt for those young aristocrats: he’s so jealous of them. Ah, if he knew how little danger they represent for me! how, when I compare them to Julien, they seem bloodless, all of them copies of one another.”","“The air of unhappiness and deep passion with which the poor boy declared his love to me eight days ago proves it; I must own it was very extraordinary of me to manifest anger at words in which there shone so much respect and so much of passion. Am I not his real wife? Those words of his were quite natural, and I must admit, were really very nice. Julien still continued to love me, even after those eternal conversations in which I had only spoken to him (cruelly enough, I admit), about those weaknesses of love which the boredom of the life I lead had inspired in me for those young society men of whom he is so jealous. Ah, if he only knew what little danger he has to fear from them; how withered and stereotyped they seem to me in comparison with him.”"

Julien had never been so afraid in his life; he only saw the dangers of the enterprise, and had no enthusiasm.","“She’s insane,” Julien told himself.

"Les remords de la vertu et ceux de l’orgueil la rendaient, ce matin-là, également malheureuse. Elle était en quelque sorte anéantie par l’affreuse idée d’avoir donné des droits sur elle à un petit abbé fils d’un paysan. C’est à peu près, se disait-elle dans les moments où elle s’exagérait son malheur, comme si j’avais à me reprocher une faiblesse pour un des laquais.","The remorse of virtue and that of pride made her equally unhappy that morning. She was in a way devastated by the dreadful idea of having given rights over her to a grandfather, the son of a peasant. It is almost, she said to herself when she exaggerated her misfortune, as if I had to reproach myself for a weakness for one of the lackeys.","Remorse, caused by virtue and by pride, had made her, that morning, equally wretched. To some extent, she was overwhelmed by a frightful idea: she had given claims on herself to a petty priest, a peasant’s son. “This is almost the same,” she told herself, in moments of exaggerating her misery, “as if I had to reproach myself, having had a weakness for one of the servants.”","She was rendered equally unhappy this morning by remorseful virtue and remorseful pride. She felt to some extent pulverised by the idea of having given a little Abbé, who was the son of a peasant, rights over her. “It is almost,” she said to herself, in those moments when she exaggerated her own misfortune, “as though I had a weakness for one of my footmen to reproach myself with.”"
"— Vraiment elle met toutes voiles dehors pour plaire. Vois, vois ce sourire gracieux au moment où elle figure seule dans cette contredanse. C’est, d’honneur impayable.","- Really she puts all sails out to please. See, see that graceful smile when she figures alone in this contredanse. It is, of unpayable honor.","“Really, Fourmont’s set all her sails, determined to please. Look—look at that gracious smile, the instant the dance sets her off by herself. On my honor, that’s simply hysterical.”",“In truth she is straining every nerve to please. Just look at that gracious smile now that she is doing the figure in that quadrille all alone. On my honour it is unique.”
"L’homme aux gilets et à l’air paterne (c’était un évêque peut-être) souriait souvent, et alors ses yeux, entourés de paupières flottantes, prenaient un brillant singulier et une expression moins indécise que de coutume. Ce personnage, que l’on faisait parler le premier devant le duc (mais quel duc? se disait Julien), apparemment pour exposer les opinions et faire les fonctions d’avocat général, parut à Julien tomber dans l’incertitude et l’absence de conclusions décidées que l’on reproche souvent à ces magistrats. Dans le courant de la discussion, le duc alla même jusqu’à le lui reprocher.","The fatherly-looking man in the waistcoats (he was perhaps a bishop) smiled often, and then his eyes, surrounded by floating lids, took on a singular brilliance and an expression less indecisive than usual. This personage, who was made to speak first in front of the duke (but which duke? Julien thought to himself), apparently to expound opinions and perform the duties of Advocate General, seemed to Julien to fall into uncertainty and absence. conclusions that are often criticized for these magistrates. In the course of the discussion, the duke even went so far as to reproach him for it.","The triple-vested man, who bore a paternal look (a bishop, more than likely), laughed a good deal, and when he laughed his eyes, under their wavering lids, turned very bright and far less indecisive than usual. This man, the first to speak, after the duke was done (“but duke of what?” Julien asked himself), apparently so he could express the general opinion and serve the function of an assistant public prosecutor, seemed, to Julien’s mind, to fall into the vagueness and absence of definite conclusions for which, so often, such officers of the court are reproved. As the discussion continued, indeed, the duke went so far as to scold him on just that account.","The man with the waistcoats and the paternal expression (he was perhaps a bishop) often smiled and then his eyes, which were surrounded with a floating forest of eyebrows, assumed a singular brilliance and an unusually decided expression. This personage whom they made speak first before the duke (“but what duke is it?” thought Julien to himself) with the apparent object of expounding various points of view and fulfilling the functions of an advocate-general, appeared to Julien to fall into the uncertainty and lack of definiteness with which those officials are so often taxed. During the course of the discussion the duke went so far as to reproach him on this score."

If he did not wield it particularly deftly, he made up for that, as you’ll see, by the forcefulness of his words.","Little Tanbeau was trying to win his spurs by talking to some silent noblemen and some intriguers who, though shady, were all men of wit, and were on this particular night in great force in M. de la Mole’s salon (for he was mentioned for a place in the ministry).

"La méfiance et l’orgueil souffrant de Julien qui avait surtout besoin d’un amour à sacrifices, ne tinrent pas devant la vue d’un sacrifice si grand, si indubitable et fait à chaque instant.

This fear removed, Julien fell into all the madness of love, into its mortal uncertainties.","Julien’s mistrust, and his wounded pride, which had above all else required a sacrificial love, could not withstand so exceedingly great a sacrifice, so clear and plain and so constantly renewed. He worshiped Madame de Rênal. “She’s had every opportunity to be noble, and I’m a workman’s son—and she loves me. . . . When I’m with her, I’m not just a kind of valet, responsible for a lover’s duties.” With that fear banished, Julien fell into all the insanity of love and its mortal doubts.","The suspiciousness and morbid pride of Julien, who needed, above all, a self-sacrificing love, altogether vanished when he saw at every hour of the day so great and indisputable a sacrifice.

Deux mois, c’est bien des jours. Jamais je n’aurai été aussi heureux.","“Who knows what we find in the next life? answered Julien; maybe torments, maybe nothing at all.

Two months: that’s a great many days. I’ll never have been so happy!”","“Who knows what one will find in the other life,” answered Julien, “perhaps torment, perhaps nothing at all.

"— Vous allez peut-être devenir un fat, lui dit l’abbé d’un air sévère. Julien avait l’air d’un fort jeune homme en grand deuil, il était à la vérité très bien, mais le bon abbé était trop provincial lui-même pour voir que Julien avait encore cette démarche des épaules qui en province, est à la fois élégance et importance. En voyant Julien, le marquis jugea ses grâces d’une manière si différente de celle du bon abbé, qu’il lui dit:","“Perhaps you are going to become a fool,” said the abbé to him sternly. Julien looked like a very young man in deep mourning, he was actually very well, but the good abbé was too provincial himself to see that Julien still had that gait of his shoulders which in the provinces is both elegance and importance. On seeing Julien, the marquis judged his favors in such a different way from that of the good abbé, that he said to him:","“You’re well on the way to becoming a fop,” the priest told him, severely. Julien looked like a very young man in deep mourning. He seemed quite presentable, but the good priest was himself too much of a provincial to be aware that Julien still hunched his shoulders, which in the provinces is considered a sign of both elegance and importance. When the marquis saw the young man, he evaluated Julien’s gracefulness very differently. He said to Father Pirard:","“Perhaps you are going to become a fop,” said the Abbé to him severely. Julien looked like a very young man in full mourning; as a matter of fact, he looked very well, but the good Abbé was too provincial himself to see that Julien still carried his shoulders in that particular way which signifies in the provinces both elegance and importance. When the marquis saw Julien his opinion of his graces differed so radically from that of the good Abbé as he said,"

Qu’importent les hypocrisies des prêtres? peuvent-elles ôter quelque chose à la vérité et à la sublimité de l’idée de Dieu?","In that supreme moment, he was a believer.

Julien's presence made her trip this morning useless, which annoyed her all the more, as she had come to fetch the second volume of Voltaire's Princess of Babylon, a worthy complement to an eminently monarchical and religious education, chief work of the Sacred Heart! This poor girl, at nineteen, already needed the wit to be interested in a novel.","Next day, very early, Julien was in the library, copying letters, when Mademoiselle Mathilde came in, using a small, secret door, extremely well hidden by books. As Julien was admiring this device, Mademoiselle Mathilde seemed both surprised and distinctly annoyed at meeting him there. She had stiff curling paper in her hair; he found her haughty and almost masculine. Mademoiselle de La Mole was in the habit of taking books from her father’s library, without anyone’s knowledge. Julien’s presence, on this particular morning, made her errand impossible, which was all the more annoying since she had come to seek out the second volume of Voltaire’s Princess of Babylon, an indelicate book eminently suited to someone who had been educated in a deeply monarchist and religious institution—an educational masterpiece produced by the Sacred Heart of Jesus! At nineteen, this poor girl’s imagination already needed spicing, for her to find a novel interesting.","Julien was copying letters in the library very early the next day when Mademoiselle Mathilde came in by a little dummy door very well masked by the backs of the books. While Julien was admiring the device, Mademoiselle Mathilde seemed astonished and somewhat annoyed at finding him there: Julien saw that she was in curl papers and had a hard, haughty, and masculine expression. Mademoiselle de la Mole had the habit of surreptitiously stealing books from her father’s library. Julien’s presence rendered this morning’s journey abortive, a fact which annoyed her all the more as she had come to fetch the second volume of Voltaire’s Princess of Babylon, a worthy climax to one of the most eminently monarchical and religious educations which the convent of the Sacred Heart had ever provided. This poor girl of nineteen already required some element of spiciness in order to get up an interest in a novel."

"Grâce au ciel, disait M. de Rênal dans d’autres moments, je n’ai point de fille, et la façon dont je vais punir la mère ne nuira point à l’établissement de mes enfants; je puis surprendre ce petit paysan avec ma femme et les tuer tous les deux dans ce cas le tragique de l’aventure en ôtera peut-être le ridicule. Cette idée lui sourit; il la suivit dans tous ses détails. Le code pénal est pour moi, et, quoiqu’il arrive, notre congrégation et mes amis du jury me sauveront. Il examina son couteau de chasse qui était fort tranchant; mais l’idée du sang lui fit peur.","Thank heaven, said M. de Rênal at other times, I have no daughter, and the way in which I am going to punish the mother will not harm the establishment of my children; I can surprise this little peasant with my wife and kill them both in this case the tragedy of the adventure will perhaps take away the ridicule. This idea smiled upon him; he followed it in all its details. The penal code is for me, and no matter what, our congregation and my friends on the jury will save me. He examined his hunting knife, which was very sharp; but the idea of blood frightened him.","“God be praised,” said Monsieur de Rênal, at other moments, “that I don’t have a daughter: however I decide to punish the children’s mother, that won’t interfere with any doweries. Maybe I can catch the little peasant with my wife, and kill them both. That way, the tragedy might wipe away all the ridicule.” This idea made him smile; he worked it out in full detail. “The penal code is on my side and, no matter what happens, the Congregation of the Holy Virgin and my friends on the jury will save me.” He examined his hunting knife, which was very sharp. But the idea of blood frightened him.","“I have no daughter, thank heaven,” M. de Rênal would say at other times, “and the way in which I am going to punish the mother will consequently not be so harmful to my children’s household. I could surprise this little peasant with my wife and kill them both; in that case the tragedy of the situation would perhaps do away with the grotesque element.” This idea appealed to him. He followed it up in all its details. “The penal code is on my side, and whatever happens our congregation and my friends on the jury will save me.” He examined his hunting-knife which was quite sharp, but the idea of blood frightened him."

"Le soir, lorsque Julien paraissait en habit bleu, il n’était jamais question d’affaires. Les bontés du marquis étaient si flatteuses pour l’amour-propre toujours souffrant de notre héros, que bientôt, malgré lui, il éprouva une sorte d’attachement pour ce vieillard aimable. Ce n’est pas que Julien fût sensible, comme on l’entend à Paris; mais ce n’était pas un monstre, et personne, depuis la mort du vieux chirurgien-major, ne lui avait parlé avec tant de bonté. Il remarquait avec étonnement que le marquis avait pour son amour-propre des ménagements de politesse qu’il n’avait jamais trouvés chez le vieux chirurgien. Il comprit enfin que le chirurgien était plus fier de sa croix que le marquis de son cordon bleu. Le père du marquis était un grand seigneur.","In the evening, when Julien appeared in a blue coat, there was never any question of business. The kindnesses of the marquis were so flattering for the always suffering self-esteem of our hero, that soon, in spite of himself, he felt a kind of attachment for this amiable old man. It is not that Julien was sensitive, as one hears in Paris; but he was no monster, and no one since the death of the old surgeon-major had spoken to him with such kindness. He observed with astonishment that the marquis showed a polite consideration for his vanity which he had never found in the old surgeon. He finally understood that the surgeon was prouder of his cross than the marquis of his blue cord. The marquis's father was a great lord.","That evening, when Julien appeared in his blue suit, no business matters were even mentioned. The marquis’s benevolence was so flattering to our hero’s perpetually painful self-respect that, in spite of himself, he soon felt a degree of affection for the pleasant old man. Not that, in Parisian terms, Julien possessed any sensibility, but simply that he was not a monster, and that no one, since the old surgeon-major’s death, had spoken to him so kindly. And he was startled to realize that the marquis was more deftly discreet, in dealing with our hero’s sense of self-worth, than the old surgeon-major had been. It came to him, at last, that the surgeon-major was prouder of his small medal than the marquis was, wearing the noblest award in all France. The marquis’s father had been a very great lord.","Business was never talked when Julien appeared in the evening in his blue suit. The kindness of the marquis was so flattering to the self-respect of our hero, which was always morbidly sensitive, that in spite of himself, he soon came to feel a kind of attachment for this nice old man.

"Il faut, se disait Julien, que je me fasse à ces conversations. Quand on ne parlait pas de saucisses et de bonnes cures, on s’entretenait de la partie mondaine des doctrines ecclésiastiques; des différends des évêques et des préfets, des maires et des curés. Julien voyait apparaître l’idée d’un second Dieu, mais d’un Dieu bien plus à craindre et bien plus puissant que l’autre; ce second Dieu était le pape. On se disait mais en baissant la voix et quand on était bien sûr de n’être pas entendu par M. Pirard, que si le pape ne se donne pas la peine de nommer tous les préfets et tous les maires de France, c’est qu’il a commis à ce soin le roi de France, en le nommant fils aîné de l’Église.","I must, thought Julien, get used to these conversations. When we were not talking about sausages and good cures, we were talking about the worldly part of ecclesiastical doctrines; differences between bishops and prefects, mayors and parish priests. Julien saw the idea of a second God appear, but of a God much more to be feared and much more powerful than the other; this second God was the pope. We said to ourselves, but lowering our voices and when we were sure of not being heard by Mr. Pirard, that if the Pope does not take the trouble to appoint all the prefects and all the mayors of France, it is that he committed the King of France to this care, naming him the eldest son of the Church.","“I’ve got to participate in these conversations,” Julien told himself. “When they’re not talking about sausages and good old priests, they chatter about the worldly side of Church doctrine, like quarrels between bishops and governors, or between mayors and parish priests.” Julien saw the concept of a second God emerging, but a new God far more frightening and more powerful than the other one. This second God was the pope. They would say, but in low voices and when they were very sure Father Pirard could not hear them, that the pope didn’t bother naming all the governors and mayors in France, only because he’d given this responsibility to the French king when he’d declared him the Church’s elder son.","“I must take part in these conversations,” said Julien to himself. When they did not talk about sausages and good livings, the conversation ran on the worldly aspect of ecclesiastical doctrine, on the differences of bishops and prefects, of mayors and curés. Julien caught sight of the conception of a second god, but of a god who was much more formidable and much more powerful than the other one. That second god was the Pope. They said among themselves, in a low voice, however, and when they were quite sure that they would not be heard by Pirard, that the reason for the Pope not taking the trouble of nominating all the prefects and mayors of France, was that he had entrusted that duty to the King of France by entitling him a senior son of the Church."

"Bientôt elle revint, contre toute prudence, lui apportant une tasse de café, elle tremblait qu’il ne mourût de faim.

Madame de Rênal talked to them about Julien. The oldest responded warmly, and with regrets, but Julien saw that the younger one had very nearly forgotten him.","Soon she came back, in defiance of all prudence, bringing him a cup of coffee.

"Le bonheur de Julien fut, ce jour-là, sur le point de devenir durable. Il manqua à notre héros d’oser être sincère. Il fallait avoir le courage de livrer bataille, mais sur-le-champ; Mme de Rênal avait été étonnée du mot de Julien parce que les hommes de sa société répétaient que le retour de Robespierre était surtout possible à cause de ces jeunes gens des basses classes, trop bien élevés. L’air froid de Mme de Rênal dura assez longtemps et sembla marqué à Julien. C’est que la crainte de lui avoir dit indirectement une chose désagréable succéda chez elle à la répugnance pour le mauvais propos. Ce malheur se réfléchit vivement dans ses traits, si purs et si naïfs, quand elle était heureuse et loin des ennuyeux.","Julien's happiness that day was on the point of becoming lasting. Our hero failed to dare to be sincere. It was necessary to have the courage to give battle, but on the spot; Madame de Rênal had been astonished by Julien's remark because the men of her company repeated that the return of Robespierre was above all possible because of these young people from the lower classes, who were too well brought up. Madame de Rênal's cold air lasted quite a long time and seemed marked to Julien. It is that the fear of having said something disagreeable to her indirectly succeeded in her the repugnance for the bad remark. This misfortune is vividly reflected in her features, so pure and so naive, when she was happy and far from boring.","That day, Julien’s happiness had been close to stability. All that was missing was for our hero to have the courage of honesty. He needed the courage to do battle, but right on the spot. Madame de Rênal had been stunned by Julien’s words: upper-class people are always saying that we could certainly see Robespierre’s return, precisely because of the lower-class people who are being elevated far too high. Madame de Rênal’s coldness lasted a long time, and seemed to Julien unusually obvious. And the fear of having spoken unpleasantly to him, even indirectly, was followed by her disgust at what he had said. Unhappiness was clearly displayed on her face, so cloudless and simple when she was happy and untroubled.","That day Julien’s happiness almost became permanent. Our hero lacked the power of daring to be sincere. He ought to have had the courage to have given battle, and on the spot; Madame de Rênal had been astonished by Julien’s phrase, because the men in her circle kept on repeating that the return of Robespierre was essentially possible by reason of those over-educated young persons of the lower classes. Madame de Rênal’s coldness lasted a longish time, and struck Julien as marked. The reason was that the fear that she had said something in some way or other disagreeable to him, succeeded her annoyance for his own breach of taste. This unhappiness was vividly reflected in those features which looked so pure and so naïve when she was happy and away from intruders."

"Il vint lui dire un jour qu’à moins de tomber dans l’affreux péché du suicide, il devait faire toutes les démarches possibles pour obtenir sa grâce. Or, le clergé avant beaucoup d’influence au ministère de la Justice à Paris, un moyen facile se présentait: il fallait se convertir avec éclat…","He came to tell her one day that unless he fell into the dreadful sin of suicide, he must do everything possible to obtain his pardon. However, the clergy before much influence at the Ministry of Justice in Paris, an easy way presented itself: it was necessary to convert with brilliance...","One day he came to tell Julien that, to avoid the frightful sin of suicide, he needed to do everything he could to secure a pardon. Now, the Church having great influence with the Ministry of Justice, in Paris, there was a singularly open road: he needed to make as big a show as possible about having reformed his sinful soul.","He came to tell him one day that unless he meant to fall into the awful sin of suicide, he ought to take every possible step to procure his pardon.

"Mathilde courait seule à pied, dans les rues de Besançon, elle espérait n’être pas reconnue. Dans tous les cas, elle ne croyait pas inutile à sa cause de produire une grande impression sur le peuple. Sa folie songeait à le faire révolter pour sauver Julien marchant à la mort. Mlle de La Mole croyait être vêtue simplement et comme il convient à une femme dans la douleur; elle l’était de façon à attirer tous les regards.","Mathilde was running alone on foot, in the streets of Besançon, she hoped not to be recognized. In any case, she did not think it unnecessary for her cause to make a great impression on the people. His madness dreamed of making him revolt in order to save Julien marching to death. Mademoiselle de La Mole thought she was dressed simply and as befits a woman in pain; it was in such a way as to attract all eyes.","Mathilde hurried, alone and on foot, along the streets of Besançon; she hoped no one would recognize her. In any case, she thought it unwise for her cause to produce a great impression on ordinary people. She was foolish enough to dream of starting a revolution, to rescue Julien as he was going to his death. Mademoiselle de La Mole fancied herself dressed simply, as befitted a woman who was suffering; she was in fact dressed to catch every eye.","Mathilde walked about the Besançon streets alone: she hoped not to be recognised. In any case, she thought it would be of some use to her cause if she produced a great impression on the people. She thought, in her madness, of making them rebel in order to save Julien as he walked to his death. Mademoiselle de la Mole thought she was dressed simply and in a way suitable to a woman in mourning; she was dressed in fact in such a way as to attract every one’s attention."
"Au lieu de ces sages réflexions, l’âme de Julien, exaltée par ces sons si mâles et si pleins, errait dans les espaces imaginaires. Jamais il ne fera ni un bon prêtre, ni un grand administrateur. Les âmes qui s’émeuvent aussi sont bonnes tout au plus à produire un artiste. Ici éclate dans tout son jour la présomption de Julien. Cinquante, peut-être, des séminaristes ses camarades, rendus attentifs au réel de la vie par la haine publique et le jacobinisme qu’on leur montre en embuscade derrière chaque haie, en entendant la grosse cloche de la cathédrale, n’auraient songé qu’au salaire des sonneurs. Ils auraient examiné avec le génie de Barrême si le degré d’émotion du public valait l’argent qu’on donnait aux sonneurs. Si Julien eût voulu songer aux intérêts matériels de la cathédrale son imagination, s’élançant au-delà du but aurait pensé à économiser quarante francs à la fabrique et laissé perdre l’occasion d’éviter une dépense de vingt-cinq centimes.","Instead of these wise reflections, the soul of Julien, exalted by these sounds so male and so full, wandered in imaginary spaces. He will never make a good priest or a great administrator. Souls that are also moved are good at most for producing an artist. Here the presumption of Julien shines in all its light. Fifty, perhaps, of his fellow seminarians, made aware of the reality of life by public hatred and the Jacobinism shown to them in ambush behind every hedge, hearing the big bell of the cathedral, would have thought only to the bell ringers' wages. They would have examined with the genius of Barrême whether the degree of emotion of the public was worth the money given to the ringers. If Julien had wanted to think of the material interests of the cathedral, his imagination, rushing beyond the goal, would have thought of saving forty francs at the factory and wasted the opportunity of avoiding an expense of twenty-five centimes.","But instead of these wise reflections, Julien’s soul, exalted by these clear, bold sounds, wandered in imaginary places. He’ll never make a good priest, nor a great administrator. Souls stirred like this are good, at best, for making artists. Here, Julien’s vanity bursts into the full light of day. Perhaps fifty of his fellow seminarians—whom public opinion had made mindful of living reality, as had the Jacobinism showing itself to them, lying in ambush behind every bush—would have heard the great clock and thought of nothing but the bell ringers’ wages. They would then have considered, with all of Barême’s mathematical genius, whether the extent of public emotion justified what the bell ringers were paid. Had Julien cared to think about the cathedral’s material interests, his imagination might even have soared so far that it could have devised a way to save forty francs of Church funds, and how to avoid expenses of twenty-five pence.","Julien’s soul exalted by these sounds with all their virile fulness, instead of making these wise reflections, wandered in the realm of imagination. He will never turn out a good priest or a good administrator. Souls which get thrilled so easily are at the best only capable of producing an artist. At this moment the presumption of Julien bursts out into full view. Perhaps fifty of his comrades in the seminary made attentive to the realities of life by their own unpopularity and the Jacobinism which they are taught to see hiding behind every hedge, would have had no other thought suggested by the great bell of the cathedral except the wages of the ringers. They would have analysed with the genius of Barême whether the intensity of the emotion produced among the public was worth the money which was given to the ringers. If Julien had only tried to think of the material interests of the cathedral, his imagination would have transcended its actual object and thought of economizing forty francs on the fabric and have lost the opportunity of avoiding an expense of twenty-five centimes."

"L’ennui n’est donc point inhérent, se disait-il, à une conversation entre gens de haute naissance! Ceux-ci plaisantent de la procession de la Fête-Dieu, ils osent raconter et avec détails pittoresques des anecdotes fort scabreuses. Il ne leur manque absolument que le raisonnement sur la chose politique, et ce manque-là est plus que compensé par la grâce de leur ton et la parfaite justesse de leurs expressions.

The whole thing is mapped out beforehand, even the correct thing to say when you fall. Stretched on the turf, and with your hand on your heart, you must vouchsafe a generous forgiveness to the adversary, and a few words for a fair lady, who is often imaginary, or if she does exist, will go to a ball on the day of your death for fear of arousing suspicion."

"Julien se couvrit de gloire un jour dans le salon du duc de Fitz-Folke, qui l’avait engagé à dîner, ainsi que le prince Korasoff. On attendit pendant une heure.

Sa mine fut impayable.","Julien covered himself with glory one day in the drawing-room of the Duke of Fitz-Folke, who had invited him and Prince Korasoff to dinner. We waited for an hour.

His mine was priceless.","Julien covered himself with glory, one day, in the Duke de Fitz-Folke’s drawing room, where he and Prince Korasoff had been invited to dine. They waited for an entire hour.

Despite his foppish friends, he longed to meet the celebrated Philip Vane, the only philosopher England has had, after Locke.",Julien covered himself with glory one day in the Salon of the Duke of Fitz-Folke who had invited him to dinner together with the Prince Korasoff. They waited for an hour. The way in which Julien conducted himself in the middle of twenty people who were waiting is still quoted as a precedent among the young secretaries of the London embassy. His demeanour was unimpeachable.
"Accoutumé au naturel parfait qui brillait dans toute la conduite de Mme de Rênal, Julien ne voyait qu’affectation dans toutes les femmes de Paris; et, pour peu qu’il fût disposé à la tristesse, ne trouvait rien à leur dire. Mlle de La Mole fit exception.","Accustomed to the perfect naturalness which shone in all Madame de Rênal's conduct, Julien saw nothing but affectation in all the women of Paris; and, however little disposed to sadness, could find nothing to say to them. Mademoiselle de La Mole was an exception.","Accustomed to the perfect simplicity that glowed in everything Madame de Rênal said and did, all Julien had seen in Parisian women was affectation; and, whenever his mood was melancholic, he had nothing to say to them. Mademoiselle de La Mole was an exception.","Accustomed as he had been to the perfect naturalness which shone throughout Madame de Rênal’s whole demeanour, Julien could not help finding all the women of Paris affected, and, though by no means of a morose disposition, found nothing to say to them.

His soul was tortured by the idea of this filthy priest attracting a crowd and creating a scandal—“and doubtless he is repeating my name at every single minute!” This moment was more painful than death.

"Une heure après, la fatigue et la pitié qu’il sentait pour lui-même le disposaient à l’attendrissement. Il rencontra Mme de Rênal et prit sa main qu’il baisa avec plus de sincérité qu’il n’avait jamais fait. Elle rougit de bonheur, et presque au même instant repoussa Julien avec la colère de la jalousie. La fierté de Julien si récemment blessée en fit un sot dans ce moment. Il ne vit en Mme de Rênal qu’une femme riche, il laissa tomber sa main avec dédain et s’éloigna. Il alla se promener pensif dans le jardin, bientôt un sourire amer parut sur ses lèvres.","An hour later, the fatigue and pity he felt for himself disposed him to tenderness. He met Madame de Rênal and took her hand, which he kissed with more sincerity than he had ever done.

He saw in Madame de Rênal only a rich woman, he dropped her hand disdainfully and walked away. He went for a pensive walk in the garden, soon a bitter smile appeared on his lips.","An hour later, his weariness, and the pity he felt for himself, led him to feelings of tenderness. He found Madame de Rênal and, taking her hand, kissed it with more sincerity than ever before. She blushed with happiness and, virtually instantaneously, repulsed him, angry with jealousy. Julien’s pride, so recently wounded, turned him into a fool. All he could see in Madame de Rênal was a rich woman: he let her hand fall, disdainfully, and walked away. He went for a solitary, pensive walk in the garden; before too long, there was a bitter smile on his lips.","An hour afterwards, this fatigue, together with the pity which he felt for himself made him inclined to be more tender. He met Madame de Rênal and took her hand, which he kissed with more sincerity than he had ever done before. She blushed with happiness and almost simultaneously rebuffed Julien with all the anger of jealousy. Julien’s pride which had been so recently wounded made him act foolishly at this juncture. He saw in Madame de Rênal nothing but a rich woman, he disdainfully let her hand fall and went away. He went and walked about meditatively in the garden. Soon a bitter smile appeared on his lips."

"Julien était fou de joie; cet avancement était le premier qu’il obtenait; les avantages étaient immenses. Pour les concevoir, il faut avoir été condamné à passer des mois entiers sans un instant de solitude, et dans un contact immédiat avec des camarades pour le moins importuns, et la plupart intolérables. Leurs cris seuls eussent suffi pour porter le désordre dans une organisation délicate. La joie bruyante de ces paysans bien nourris et bien vêtus ne savait jouir d’elle-même, ne se croyait entière que lorsqu’ils criaient de toute la force de leurs poumons.","Julien was overjoyed; this promotion was the first he obtained; the benefits were immense. To conceive of them, one must have been condemned to spend whole months without a moment of solitude, and in immediate contact with comrades who are at least importunate, and most of them intolerable. Their cries alone would have sufficed to bring disorder to a delicate organization. The noisy joy of these well-fed and well-dressed peasants only knew how to enjoy itself, only believed itself complete when they cried out with all the force of their lungs.","Julien was wild with happiness. This was the first promotion he’d gotten; the advantages were immense. To properly understand, you must be condemned for months on end never to know solitude, placed in close contact with colleagues, at best tiresome, for the most part unendurable. Their loud voices would be enough to upset a delicate constitution. The noisy delight of these well-nourished, well-fed peasants could not be contained, or even believed in, unless they yelled as loud as their lungs would let them.","Julien was mad with joy. This promotion was the first which he had obtained. The advantages were immense. To realise them one must have been condemned to pass months on end without an instant’s solitude, and in immediate contact with comrades who were at the best importunate, and for the most part insupportable. Their cries alone would have sufficed to disorganise a delicate constitution. The noise and joy of these peasants, well-fed and well-clothed as they were, could only find a vent for itself, or believe in its own completeness when they were shouting with all the strength of their lungs."
"Julien répondit avec candeur, à l’étonnement de son évoque, que cet auteur ne se trouvait pas dans la bibliothèque du séminaire.","Julien answered with candor, to the astonishment of his bishop, that this author was not in the library of the seminary.","Julien replied frankly, to the bishop’s astonishment, that this author was not to be found in the seminary’s library.","To the astonishment of the prelate, Julien answered frankly that that author was not to be found in the seminary library."

"La crainte de mal faire et de heurter les idées tenues pour sacrées par les Caylus, les de Luz, les Croisenois avait assez peu d’empire sur son âme; de tels êtres ne lui semblaient pas faits pour la comprendre; elle les eût consultés s’il eût été question d’acheter une calèche ou une terre. Sa véritable terreur était que Julien ne fût mécontent d’elle.","The fear of doing wrong and offending the ideas held sacred by the Caylus, the de Luz, the Croisenois had little sway over his soul; such beings did not seem to her made to understand her; she would have consulted them if there had been any question of buying a carriage or a piece of land. Her real terror was that Julien would be displeased with her.","Fear of doing wrong and offending against the most sacred beliefs of the de Cayluses, the de Luzes, and the de Croisenoises, were hardly deeply seated in her soul. She did not think such people had been fashioned to understand her; had it been a question of buying a carriage, or a piece of property, she would have consulted them. Her true fear was that Julien might be disappointed in her.","The fear of doing wrong and of offending those ideas which the Caylus’s, the de Luz’s, the Croisenois’ held for sacred had little power over her soul.

"De retour à Vergy Julien ne descendit au jardin que lorsqu’il fut nuit close. Son âme était fatiguée de ce grand nombre d’émotions puissantes qui l’avaient agité dans cette journée, Que leur dirai-je? pensait-il avec inquiétude, en songeant aux dames. Il était loin de voir que son âme était précisément au niveau des petites circonstances qui occupent ordinairement tout l’intérêt des femmes. Souvent Julien était inintelligible pour Mme Derville et même pour son amie, et à son tour, ne comprenait qu’à demi tout ce qu’elles lui disaient. Tel était l’effet de la force, et si j’ose parler ainsi de la grandeur des mouvements de passion qui bouleversaient l’âme de ce jeune ambitieux. Chez cet être singulier, c’était presque tous les jours tempête.","Back in Vergy Julien only went down to the garden when it was dark. His soul was tired from so many powerful emotions that had stirred him that day, What shall I tell them? he thought uneasily, thinking of the ladies. He was far from seeing that his soul was precisely on the level of the petty circumstances which ordinarily occupy all the interest of women. Often Julien was unintelligible to Madame Derville and even to her friend, and in turn only half understood everything they said to him. Such was the effect of force, and if I dare speak thus, of the grandeur of the movements of passion which upset the soul of this ambitious young man. With this singular being, it was stormy almost every day.","Returning to Vergy, he didn’t go into the garden until darkness had settled down. His soul was weary, after all the powerful emotions he had been experiencing that day. “What will I say to them?” he thought uncomfortably, wondering about the two ladies. He had no idea that his soul functioned precisely at the level of petty events, which usually so preoccupy women. Often, Julien made no sense to Madame Derville, and even to her friend, and he himself understood no more than half of what they said to him. This was due to the power and, if I may speak in those terms, the grandeur that had been turning this young, ambitious man’s soul upside down. For this strange creature, almost every day was a stormy season.","On returning to Vergy, Julien waited till night had fallen before going down into the garden. His soul was fatigued by the great number of violent emotions which had agitated him during the day. “What shall I say to them?” he reflected anxiously, as he thought about the ladies. He was far from realising that his soul was just in a mood to discuss those trivial circumstances which usually monopolise all feminine interests. Julien was often unintelligible to Madame Derville, and even to her friend, and he in his turn only half understood all that they said to him. Such was the effect of the force and, if I may venture to use such language, the greatness of the transports of passion which overwhelmed the soul of this ambitious youth. In this singular being it was storm nearly every day."

"L’abbé fut étonné de l’air noble et du ton presque gai du marquis.

However, this future minister received him without any of those little manners of a great lord, so polite, but so impertinent to anyone who understands them.

"Julien ne put retenir ses larmes. Quelle indigne faiblesse! se dit-il avec rage.

Ces premières places que j’obtiens toujours n’ont servi qu’à me donner de mauvaises notes pour les véritables places que l’on obtient à la sortie du séminaire et où l’on gagne de l’argent. Chazel, qui a plus de science que moi jette toujours dans ses compositions quelque balourdise qui le fait reléguer à la cinquantième place; s’il obtient la première, c’est par distraction. Ah! qu’un mot, un seul mot de M. Pirard m’eût été utile!","So science is nothing here! he said to himself with vexation; progress in dogma, in sacred history, etc., counts only in appearance. Everything that is said on this subject is intended to ensnare fools like me. Alas! my only merit consisted in my rapid progress, in my way of grasping this nonsense. Do they really value them at their true value? do they judge them like me? And I had the foolishness to be proud of it! These first places that I always get have only served to give me bad marks for the real places that you get at the end of the seminar and where you earn money. Chazel, who has more knowledge than I always throws some clumsiness into his compositions which relegates him to the fiftieth place; if he gets the first, it is by distraction. Ah! that a word, a single word from M. Pirard would have been useful to me!","“So: knowledge is nothing here!” he said to himself, resentfully. “Progress in dogma, in Church history, etc., only seems to make any difference. Talking about knowledge is a deliberate trap, meant for fools like me to fall into. Alas! All I’ve accomplished is a swift mastery of all this twaddle. Do they really judge these things at their true value? Do they think of them as I do? And I’ve been stupid enough to feel proud! All I’ve gained, for all my long, unending parade of academic honors, is fierce, relentless enemies. Chazel, who really knows more than I do, always throws a whopping blunder into his papers, so he drops into fiftieth place. If he ever takes a first, it’s pure absentmindedness. Ah! How useful one word, one single word from Father Pirard would have been!”","“So knowledge is nothing here,” he said to himself with disgust. “Progress in doctrine, in sacred history, etc., only seem to count. Everything said on those subjects is only intended to entrap fools like me. Alas my only merit consists in my rapid progress, and in the way in which I grasp all their nonsense. Do they really value those things at their true worth? Do they judge them like I do. And I had the stupidity to be proud of my quickness. The only result of my coming out top has been to give me inveterate enemies. Chazel, who really knows more than I do, always throws some blunder in his compositions which gets him put back to the fiftieth place. If he comes out first, it is only because he is absent-minded. O how useful would one word, just one word, of M. Pirard, have been to me.”"

"Cependant sa distraction fut à demi vaincue par l’aspect de deux femmes fort bien mises qui étaient à genoux, l’une dans un confessionnal, et l’autre tout près de la première, sur une chaise. Il regardait sans voir; cependant, soit sentiment vague de ses devoirs, soit admiration pour la mise noble et simple de ces dames, il remarqua qu’il n’y avait pas de prêtre dans ce confessionnal. Il est singulier, pensa-t-il, que ces belles dames ne soient pas à genoux devant quelque reposoir, si elles sont dévotes; ou placées avantageusement au premier rang de quelque balcon, si elles sont du monde. Comme cette robe est bien prise! quelle grâce! Il ralentit le pas pour chercher à les voir.","However, his distraction was half conquered by the sight of two very well-dressed women who were on their knees, one in a confessional, and the other quite near the first, on a chair. He looked without seeing; however, either from a vague feeling of his duties, or from admiration for the noble and simple dress of these ladies, he noticed that there was no priest in this confessional. It is strange, he thought, that these beautiful ladies are not on their knees before some altar, if they are devout; or placed advantageously in the first row of some balcony, if they are of the world. How well this dress is taken! what Grace! He slows down to try to see them.","However, his abstraction was half broken by the sight of two women, extremely well dressed and on their knees, one already in a confessional, and the other close by, on a prayer stool. He was looking without seeing, but still, whether from some vague sense of his responsibilities, or perhaps admiring the two ladies’ fine, simple clothes, he noticed that there was no priest in the confessional. “Strange,” he thought. “Why aren’t these fine ladies on their knees at some temporary altar, if they’re in fact so devout? Or else set advantageously in the front row of a balcony, if they’re worldly women? How well designed that dress is! How charming!” He slowed down, trying to see it better.","His reverie was almost broken by the sight of two well-dressed women, one in the confessional, and the other on a chair quite near her. He looked without seeing, but noticed, however, either by reason of some vague appreciation of his duties or admiration for the aristocratic but simple dress of the ladies, that there was no priest in the Confessional. “It is singular,” he thought, “that if these fair ladies are devout, they are not kneeling before some altar, or that if they are in society they have not an advantageous position in the first row of some balcony. How well cut that dress is! How graceful!” He slackened his pace to try and look at them."

"La vue de la campagne sembla nouvelle à Mme de Rênal, son admiration allait jusqu’aux transports. Le sentiment dont elle était animée lui donnait de l’esprit et de la résolution. Dès le surlendemain de l’arrivée à Vergy M. de Rênal étant retourné à la ville, pour les affairés de la mairie, Mme de Rênal prit des ouvriers à ses frais. Julien lui avait donné l’idée d’un petit chemin sablé, qui circulerait dans le verger et sous les grands noyers, et permettrait aux enfants de se promener dès le matin, sans que leurs souliers fussent mouillés par la rosée. Cette idée fut mise à exécution, moins de vingt-quatre heures après avoir été conçue. Mme de Rênal passa toute la journée gaiement avec Julien à diriger les ouvriers.","The view of the countryside seemed new to Madame de Rênal, her admiration went even to transport. The sentiment with which she was animated gave her wit and resolution. Two days after his arrival in Vergy, M. de Rênal having returned to the city for the business of the town hall, Mme de Rênal hired workmen at her own expense. Julien had given him the idea of a little sandy path that would run through the orchard and under the tall walnut trees, and would allow the children to walk in the morning without their shoes getting wet with dew. This idea was put into execution, less than twenty-four hours after being conceived. Madame de Rênal spent the whole day cheerfully with Julien directing the workmen.","The view of the countryside seemed fresh and new to Madame de Rênal; her pleasure came very close to ecstasy. She drew courage and determination from the feelings it inspired in her. Two days after their arrival in Vergy, Monsieur de Rênal having gone back to the city on official mayoral business, Madame Rênal hired workmen—at her own expense. Julien had given her the idea of a little graveled walkway, encircling the orchard and running under the shade of the great walnut trees: this would allow the children to take morning walks without the dew wetting their shoes. The idea was carried to completion less than twenty-four hours after its conception. Madame de Rênal happily passed the entire day, together with Julien, giving orders to the workmen.","Madame de Rênal found the sight of the country novel: her admiration reached the point of enthusiasm. The sentiment by which she was animated gave her both ideas and resolution. M. de Rênal had returned to the town, for mayoral business, two days after their arrival in Vergy. But Madame de Rênal engaged workmen at her own expense. Julien had given her the idea of a little sanded path which was to go round the orchard and under the big walnut trees, and render it possible for the children to take their walk in the very earliest hours of the morning without getting their feet wet from the dew. This idea was put into execution within twenty-four hours of its being conceived. Madame de Rênal gaily spent the whole day with Julien in supervising the workmen."
"Soit hasard ou fait exprès de la part de Mlle de La Mole, Mathilde ne fut pas un instant seule ce jour-là. Le soir, en passant de la salle à manger au salon, elle trouva pourtant le moment de dire à Julien:","Either by chance or on purpose on the part of Mademoiselle de La Mole, Mathilde was not alone for a moment that day. In the evening, going from the dining room to the living room, she nevertheless found the moment to say to Julien:","Whether by chance, or because Madame de la Mole had been careful to arrange it that way, Mathilde was not left alone at any time during the entire day. But that evening, as they were going from the dining room into the drawing room, she found a moment to say to Julien:","Mathilde was not left alone for an instant that day, whether by chance or the deliberate policy of Madame de la Mole.

"Le matin il avait déjà refusé la visite de ce prêtre, mais cet homme s’était mis en tête de confesser Julien et de se faire un nom parmi les jeunes femmes de Besançon, par toutes les confidences qu’il prétendrait en avoir reçues.","In the morning he had already refused the visit of this priest, but this man had taken it into his head to confess Julien and to make a name for himself among the young women of Besançon, by all the confidences he claimed to have received from them.","He had already, that morning, refused to see this priest.

"Julien fit un effort pour marcher et réussit à ne pas tomber. Il remarqua qu’une petite fenêtre, voisine de la porte d’entrée, donnait sur La campagne. Il regarda les arbres; cette vue lui fit du bien, comme s’il eût aperçu d’anciens amis.","Julien made an effort to walk and managed not to fall. He noticed that a small window, near the front door, overlooked the countryside. He looked at the trees; the sight did him good, as if he had caught sight of old friends.","Julien forced himself to walk to the door, and then come back, without falling. He noticed that a small window, right alongside the door, opened onto country fields. He looked out at the trees; it did him good, like seeing old friends.","Julian made an effort to walk, and managed not to fall. He noticed that a little window near the entrance door looked out on to the country. He saw the trees; that sight did him as much good as the sight of old friends."
"Julien cherchait à ne pas s’exagérer cette singulière amitié. Il la comparait lui-même à un commerce armé. Chaque jour en se retrouvant, avant de reprendre le ton presque intime de la veille, on se demandait presque: Serons-nous aujourd’hui amis ou ennemis? Dans les premières phrases échangées, le fond des choses n’était plus rien. On n’était attentif des deux côtés qu’à la forme. Julien avait compris que se laisser offenser impunément une seule fois par cette fille si hautaine, c’était tout perdre. Si je dois me brouiller, ne vaut-il pas mieux que ce soit de prime abord, en défendant les justes droits de mon orgueil, qu’en repoussant les marques de mépris dont serait bientôt suivi le moindre abandon de ce que je dois à ma dignité personnelle?","Julien tried not to exaggerate this singular friendship. He himself compared it to an armed trade. Every day when we met, before resuming the almost intimate tone of the day before, we almost asked ourselves: Will we be friends or enemies today? In the first sentences exchanged, the bottom line was nothing. We were only attentive on both sides to the form. Julien had understood that to allow himself to be offended with impunity just once by this haughty girl was to lose everything. If I have to quarrel, isn't it better that it be at first sight, by defending the just rights of my pride, than by rejecting the marks of contempt which would soon be followed by the slightest abandonment of what I owe to my personal dignity?","Julien tried not to exaggerate this odd friendship. He described it to himself as a relationship at gunpoint. Every day, when they found themselves together again, and before they could resume the previous night’s almost intimate tone, they virtually had to ask themselves: “Will we be friends today, or enemies?” Julien was very well aware that, if he ever let himself be insulted, with impunity, by this haughty girl, everything was all over. “If I have to quarrel with her, wouldn’t it be better, in a proper defense of my pride, if I started it, instead of just repelling the signs of contempt that, surely, will follow right behind the very smallest surrender of my personal dignity?”","Julien endeavoured not to exaggerate this singular friendship. He himself compared it to an armed truce. When they met again each day, they almost seemed before they took up the almost intimate tone of the previous day to ask themselves “are we going to be friends or enemies to-day?” Julien had realised that to allow himself to be insulted with impunity even once by this haughty girl would mean the loss of everything. “If I have got to quarrel would it not be better that it should be straight away in defending the rights of my own pride, than in parrying the expressions of contempt which would follow the slightest abandonment of my duty to my own self-respect?”"

"Julien n’osa plus rêver avec abandon. Plus calme et moins amoureux, il trouva qu’il était imprudent d’aller voir Mme de Rênal dans sa chambre.

Growing calmer and less infatuated, he considered that it was imprudent to go and see Madame de Rênal in her room. It was better for her to come to him.

"Au bout du compte, ils ne m’ont point attrapé, se disait Julien, en préparant son départ. Que les plaisanteries que Mlle de La Mole fait à ces messieurs soient réelles ou seulement destinées à m’inspirer de la confiance je m’en suis amusé.","In the end, they didn't catch me, thought Julien, preparing to leave. Whether the jokes Mademoiselle de La Mole makes to these gentlemen are real or merely intended to inspire confidence in me, I am amused.","“After all, they haven’t snared me,” Julien said to himself as he got ready for his departure. “Whether Mademoiselle de La Mole’s witticisms about these gentlemen were genuine, or only intended to make me trust her, it’s been amusing.","“So, when we come to balance the account,” Julien said to himself, as he prepared his departure, “they have not caught me.

"Ce petit mémoire justificatif arrangé en forme de conte, que Fouqué ne devait ouvrir qu’en cas d’accident, Julien le fit aussi peu compromettant que possible pour Mlle de La Mole; mais enfin, il peignait fort exactement sa position.","This little explanatory memorandum arranged in the form of a tale, which Fouqué was only to open in the event of an accident, Julien made as little compromising as possible for Mlle de La Mole; but in the end he depicted his position very exactly.","The short manuscript he had enclosed, explaining and justifying, and which Fouqué was only to read in case of accident, had been written as a narrative; he had made it as minimally compromising as possible for Mademoiselle de La Mole, but nevertheless it clearly stated his own position.","Julien made this little memoir in defence of his position as little compromising as possible for Mademoiselle de la Mole. Fouqué was only to open it in the event of an accident. It was put in the form of a story, but in fact it exactly described his situation."
"Toute vraie passion ne songe qu’à elle. C’est pourquoi, ce me semble, toutes les passions sont si ridicules à Paris, où le voisin prétend toujours qu’on pense beaucoup à lui. Je me garderai de raconter les transports de Julien à la Malmaison. Il pleura. Quoi! malgré les vilains murs blancs construits cette année, et qui coupent ce parc en morceaux? — Oui, monsieur; pour Julien comme pour la postérité, il n’y avait rien entre Arcole, Sainte-Hélène et la Malmaison.","All true passion thinks only of itself. This is why, it seems to me, all the passions are so ridiculous in Paris, where the neighbor always pretends that they think a lot of him. I will refrain from recounting Julien's transports to Malmaison. He cried. What! despite the ugly white walls built this year, and which cut this park to pieces? - Yes sir; for Julien as for posterity, there was nothing between Arcole, Sainte-Hélène and Malmaison.","Go.” Real passion always thinks of nothing but itself. This is why, it seems to me, passions are so ridiculous in Paris, where your neighbor acts as if you’re always deeply attentive to him. I’ll spare you a description of Julien’s ecstasies at Malmaison, where Napoleon had held court. He wept. (What! In spite of the ugly white walls, just recently put up, chopping the whole property into tiny morsels? Yes, my dear reader: for Julien, as for posterity, the Battle of Arcola and Saint Helena and Malmaison were as good as one and the same.)","Get on.” Every real passion only thinks about itself. That is why, in my view, passions are ridiculous at Paris, where one’s neighbour always insists on one’s considering him a great deal. I shall refrain from recounting Julien’s ecstasy at La Malmaison. He wept. What! in spite of those wretched white walls, but this very year, which cut the path up into bits? Yes, monsieur, for Julien, as for posterity, there was nothing to choose between Arcole, Saint Helena, and La Malmaison."
"Voilà ce qui m’isole, et non l’absence d’un Dieu juste, tout-puissant, point méchant, point avide de vengeance…","This is what isolates me, and not the absence of a just God, almighty, not evil, not greedy for revenge...","“That’s what’s isolating me, not any lack of a just God, good, all-powerful, not a bit evil-minded, not at all greedy for revenge. . . .","“That is what makes me lonely, and not the absence of a God who is just, good and omnipotent, devoid of malice, and in no wise greedy of vengeance.”"
"— Reste avec moi, lui dit Fouqué, je vois que tu connais M. de Rênal, M. Valenod, le sous-préfet Maugiron, le curé Chélan; tu as compris les finesses du caractère de ces gens-là; te voilà en état de paraître aux adjudications. Tu sais l’arithmétique mieux que moi, tu tiendras mes comptes. Je gagne gros dans mon commerce. L’impossibilité de tout faire par moi-même, et la crainte de rencontrer un fripon dans l’homme que je prendrais pour associé, m’empêchent tous les jours d’entreprendre d’excellentes affaires. Il n’y a pas un mois que j’ai failli gagner six mille francs à Michaud de Saint-Amand, que je n’avais pas revu depuis six ans, et que j’ai trouvé par hasard à la vente de Pontarlier. Pourquoi n’aurais-tu pas gagné, toi, ces six mille francs ou du moins trois mille? car, si ce jour-là je t’avais eu avec moi, j’aurais mis l’enchère à cette coupe de bois, et tout le monde me l’eût bientôt laissée. Sois mon associé.","'Stay with me,' said Fouque to him, 'I see that you know M. de Rênal, M. Valenod, the sub-prefect Maugiron, the priest Chelan; you have understood the subtleties of the character of these people; now you are ready to appear at the auctions. You know arithmetic better than me, you will keep my accounts. I earn big in my business. The impossibility of doing everything by myself, and the fear of encountering a rogue in the man whom I would take for partner, prevent me every day from undertaking excellent business. Not a month ago I nearly won six thousand francs at Michaud de Saint-Amand, whom I had not seen for six years, and whom I found by chance at the Pontarlier sale. Why wouldn't you have won those six thousand francs, or at least three thousand? for if I had had you with me that day, I would have put up a bid for that log, and everyone would soon have left it to me. Be my partner.","“Stay here with me,” Fouqué told him. “I see you quite understand Monsieur de Rênal, and Monsieur Valenod, and the assistant governor, Maugiron, and the parish priest, Chélan. You have a nice understanding of the fine points of these people’s characters, you’ve readied yourself to handle all sorts of negotiations. You know more about arithmetic than I do; you could easily handle my accounts. I’m doing extremely well. Because I can’t possibly do everything by myself, and I’m terrified of meeting up with a scoundrel, if I take someone into the business, I’m losing good opportunities every day of the week. Less than a month ago, I passed a deal to Michaud, from Saint Armand, and he made six thousand francs. I hadn’t seen him in six years: we met, just by chance, at an auction in Pontarlier. Why couldn’t you have made—yes, you—those six thousand francs, or three thousand, anyway? Because if I’d had you with me that day, I could have bid for that timber cutting, and nobody could have stopped me. So be my partner.”","“Stay with me,” said Fouqué to him. “I see that you know M. de Rênal, M. Valenod, the sub-prefect Maugiron, the curé Chélan. You have understood the subtleties of the character of those people. So there you are then, quite qualified to attend auctions. You know arithmetic better than I do; you will keep my accounts; I make a lot in my business. The impossibility of doing everything myself, and the fear of taking a rascal for my partner prevents me daily from undertaking excellent business. It’s scarcely a month since I put Michaud de Saint-Amand, whom I haven’t seen for six years, and whom I ran across at the sale at Pontarlier in the way of making six thousand francs. Why shouldn’t it have been you who made those six thousand francs, or at any rate three thousand. For if I had had you with me that day, I would have raised the bidding for that lot of timber and everybody else would soon have run away. Be my partner.”"
"Malgré sa fierté, M. le maire a dû faire bien des démarches auprès du vieux Sorel, paysan dur et entêté; il a dû lui compter de beaux louis d’or pour obtenir qu’il transportât son usine ailleurs.

Cette grâce lui vint après les élections de 182…","Despite his pride, the mayor must have taken many steps with old Sorel, a tough and stubborn peasant; he had to pay him handsome louis d'or to get him to move his factory elsewhere.

This favour was accorded him after the election of 182—."
"— Oh! bien, dit Sorel, d’un ton de voix traînard, il ne reste donc plus qu’à nous mettre d’accord sur une seule chose, l’argent que vous lui donnerez.","- Oh! Well, said Sorel, in a drawling tone of voice, there remains only to agree on one thing, the money you will give him.","“Fine, fine,” said Sorel languidly. “So there’s only one thing left, to have everything arranged: how much you’re going to pay him.”","“Certainly!” “Well,” said Sorel, in a drawling voice, “all that remains to do is to agree on just one thing, the money which you will give him.”"

She refused to negotiate on any other bases than these: she would be Madame Sorel and live in poverty, with her husband, in Switzerland, or else at her father’s great house in Paris.

"Une heure sonna; entendre le son de la cloche et se dire: Je vais monter avec l’échelle, ne fut qu’un instant.","One o'clock struck; hear the sound of the bell and think: I am going to climb the ladder, was only for a moment.","He heard the clock sounding one, and he listened, and then he said, in a flash: “I’m going to climb up the ladder.”","One o’clock struck.

"Jamais elle n’avait ménagé sa vanité avec autant d’adresse. En moins de deux heures elle lui fit voir, et toujours par des raisons trouvées par lui, qu’il fallait marquer plus d’amitié que jamais à M. Valenod, et même reprendre Élisa dans la maison. Mme de Rênal eut besoin de courage pour se décider à revoir cette fille cause de tous ses malheurs. Mais cette idée venait de Julien.","Never had she spared her vanity with so much skill.

"Suis-je donc oublié de toute la terre? pensait-il. Il ne savait pas que M. Pirard avait reçu et jeté au feu quelques lettres timbrées de Dijon, et où, malgré les formes du style le plus convenable, perçait la passion la plus vive. De grands remords semblaient combattre cet amour. Tant mieux, pensait l’abbé Pirard, ce n’est pas du moins une femme impie que ce jeune homme a aimée.","Am I then forgotten by all the earth? he thought. He did not know that M. Pirard had received and thrown into the fire some letters stamped with Dijon, and in which, in spite of the forms of the most suitable style, pierced the most lively passion. Great remorse seemed to combat this love. So much the better, thought the Abbé Pirard, at least it was not an impious woman that this young man loved.","“Has the whole world forgotten me?” he thought. He did not know that Father Pirard had already received, and thrown into the fire, several letters postmarked in Dijon, on the pages of which, despite their highly proper language, he perceived intense passion. Equally intense remorse appeared to struggle against that love. “So much the better,” thought Father Pirard. “Certainly, it’s at least better than having been in love with an impious woman.”","“Am I then forgotten by the whole world,” he thought. He did not know that M. Pirard had received and thrown into the fire several letters with the Dijon stamp in which the most lively passion would pierce through the most formal conventionalism of style. “This love seems to be fought by great attacks of remorse. All the better,” thought the Abbé Pirard. “At any rate this lad has not loved an infidel woman.”"

Il y a déjà de la grandeur et de l’audace à oser aimer un homme placé si loin de moi par sa position sociale. Voyons: continuera-t-il à me mériter?

Each of my days will not coldly resemble that of the day before. There is already greatness and audacity in daring to love a man placed so far from me by his social position. Let's see: will he continue to deserve me? At the first weakness I see in him, I abandon him. A girl of my birth, and with the chivalrous character that people are willing to grant me (it was a saying of her father), should not behave like a fool.","“What great deed isn’t extreme when it’s first begun?

"Sa dépêche expédiée, Julien, content comme un chasseur qui, à six heures du matin, par un beau jour d’automne, débouche dans une plaine abondante en gibier, sortit pour aller demander conseil à M. Chélan. Mais avant d’arriver chez le bon curé, le ciel qui voulait lui ménager des jouissances, jeta sous ses pas M. Valenod, auquel il ne cacha point que son coeur était déchiré; un pauvre garçon comme lui se devait tout entier à la vocation que le ciel avait placée dans son coeur, mais la vocation n’était pas tout dans ce bas monde. Pour travailler dignement à la vigne du Seigneur, et n’être pas tout à fait indigne de tant de savants collaborateurs, il fallait l’instruction; il fallait passer au séminaire de Besançon deux années bien dispendieuses, il devenait donc indispensable et l’on pouvait dire que c’était en quelque sorte un devoir de faire des économies, ce qui était bien plus facile sur un traitement de huit cents francs payés par quartier qu’avec six cents francs qu’on mangeait de mois en mois. D’un autre côté, le ciel, en le plaçant auprès des jeunes de Rênal, et surtout en lui inspirant pour eux un attachement spécial, ne semblait-il pas lui indiquer qu’il n’était pas à propos d’abandonner cette éducation pour une autre…","His despatch dispatched, Julien, as happy as a hunter who, at six o'clock in the morning, on a fine autumn day, emerges into a plain abundant in game, went out to seek advice from M. Chélan. But before reaching the good priest, heaven, which wished to spare him enjoyment, threw under his feet M. Valenod, to whom he did not conceal that his heart was torn; a poor boy like him owed himself entirely to the vocation that heaven had placed in his heart, but vocation was not everything in this lowly world. To work worthily in the vineyard of the Lord, and not be altogether unworthy of so many learned collaborators, one needed instruction; it was necessary to spend two very expensive years at the seminary of Besançon, it therefore became essential and one could say that it was in a way a duty to save money, which was much easier on a salary of eight hundred francs paid by quarter than with the six hundred francs that we ate up from month to month. On the other hand, did not the sky, by placing him near the young people of Rênal, and above all by inspiring him with a special attachment for them, seem to indicate to him that it was not appropriate to abandon this education? for another...","His missive sent on its way, Julien—feeling as satisfied as a hunter who, at six A.M. on a beautiful autumn day, comes upon a field full of game—went to ask Father Chélan’s advice. But before he got to the good priest’s lodgings, heaven—wanting to contrive joyous occasions for him—set in his path Monsieur Valenod, from whom he did not conceal that his heart had been lacerated. A poor boy like him ought to be completely devoted to the vocation heaven had placed in his heart, but in this unspiritual world vocation is not everything. To do worthy work in Our Lord’s vineyard, and not to become entirely unworthy of his wise fellow workers, instruction was obligatory. Two expensive years must be spent in the seminary at Besançon; economies were therefore necessary; and that would be a great deal easier on a salary of eight hundred francs, rather than six hundred francs, which was eaten up, month by month. On the other hand, in placing him with the Rênal children, and above all by inspiring him with a special affection for them, wasn’t heaven indicating that this wasn’t the time to give up that educational process for a different one? . . .","Having sent off his despatch and feeling as satisfied as a hunter who at six o’clock in the morning on a fine autumn day, comes out into a plain that abounds with game, he went out to go and ask advice of M. Chélan. But before he had arrived at the good curé’s, providence, wishing to shower favours upon him, threw in his path M. de Valenod, to whom he owned quite freely that his heart was torn in two; a poor lad such as he was owed an exclusive devotion to the vocation to which it had pleased Heaven to call him. But vocation was not everything in this base world. In order to work worthily at the vine of the Lord, and to be not totally unworthy of so many worthy colleagues, it was necessary to be educated; it was necessary to spend two expensive years at the seminary of Besançon; saving consequently became an imperative necessity, and was certainly much easier with a salary of eight hundred francs paid quarterly than with six hundred francs which one received monthly. On the other hand, did not Heaven, by placing him by the side of the young de Rênals, and especially by inspiring him with a special devotion to them, seem to indicate that it was not proper to abandon that education for another one."

"Pendant que Julien, rempli de ses préjugés puisés dans les livres et dans les souvenirs de Verrières, poursuivait la chimère d’une maîtresse tendre et qui ne songe plus à sa propre existence du moment qu’elle a fait le bonheur de son amant, la vanité de Mathilde était furieuse contre lui.","While Julien, filled with his prejudices drawn from the books and memories of Verrières, pursued the chimera of a tender mistress who no longer thinks of her own existence as soon as she has made her lover happy, the Mathilde's vanity was furious with him.","While Julien, full of preconceived judgments, drawn from books as well as his memories of Verrières, was haunted by the chimera of a tender mistress who, from the moment she had made her lover happy, was no longer concerned with his existence, Mathilde’s vanity was wildly angry with him.","While Julien, full of those preconceived ideas which he had found in books and in his memories of Verrières, was chasing the phantom of a tender mistress, who from the minute when she has made her lover happy no longer thinks of her own existence, Mathilde’s vanity was infuriated against him."
"Mme de La Mole appela sa fille. L’hypocrisie, pour être utile, doit se cacher; et Julien, comme on voit, avait fait à Mlle de La Mole une demi-confidence sur son admiration pour Napoléon.","Madame de La Mole called her daughter. Hypocrisy, to be useful, must hide; and Julien, as we see, had given Mademoiselle de La Mole a half-confidence on his admiration for Napoleon.","Madame de La Mole called to her daughter.

"— Je ne m’abaisserai jamais à parler de mon courage, dit froidement Julien, c’est une bassesse. Que le monde juge sur les faits. Mais, ajouta-t-il en lui prenant la main, vous ne concevez pas combien je vous suis attaché, et quelle est ma joie de pouvoir prendre congé de vous avant cette cruelle absence.","""I'll never stoop to talking about my courage,"" said Julien coldly, ""it's baseness.""

Let the world decide, when I’ve done what I will do. But,” he added, taking her hand, “you don’t understand how deeply attached to you I am, and how happy it makes me to have this chance of taking leave of you, before our cruel separation.”","“I will never demean myself to speak about my courage,” said Julien, coldly, “it would be mean to do so.

"Il avait pris chez Fouqué un habit bourgeois, et c’est dans ce costume qu’il passa les ponts-levis.

Knowing quite well the history of the siege of 1674, he wanted to see, before he closed himself up in the seminary, the ramparts and the citadel. Two or three times, he came close to being stopped by the sentries: he got into places forbidden to the general public, on grounds of military security, but in fact so the armies could sell hay, for twelve or fifteen francs a year.","He had taken a civilian suit at Fouqué’s, and it was in this dress that he passed the drawbridge. Steeped as he was in the history of the siege of 1674, he wished to see the ramparts of the citadel before shutting himself up in the seminary. He was within an ace two or three times of getting himself arrested by the sentinel. He was penetrating into places which military genius forbids the public to enter, in order to sell twelve or fifteen francs worth of corn every year."
"Que seriez-vous devenu à Besançon, sans ce caprice du marquis de La Mole?

"— S’il est mort, je mourrai, dit-elle à son père.

"Si tout ceci n’est pas un jeu convenu avec le comte Norbert, il est clair que ce sont mes regards pleins de froideur qui ont allumé l’amour baroque que cette fille de si haute naissance s’avise d’avoir pour moi. Je serais un peu plus sot qu’il ne convient, si jamais je me laissais entraîner à avoir du goût pour cette grande poupée blonde. Ce raisonnement le laissa plus froid et plus calculant qu’il n’avait été de sa vie.","If all this is not an agreed game with Count Norbert, it is clear that it was my looks full of coldness that kindled the baroque love that this girl of such high birth takes it into her head to have for me.

This reasoning left him colder and more calculating than he had been in his life.","“If this isn’t just a game that she and Count Norbert are playing, then the fire of such a strange love, which this girl of high birth conceives she feels for me, must have been lit by the icy-cold looks I’ve showered on her.

I should be really too much of a fool if I ever allowed myself to take a fancy to that big blonde doll.” This train of reasoning left him colder and more calculating than he had ever been."
"Ce fut en vain qu’il appela Julien deux ou trois fois. L’attention que le jeune homme donnait à son livre! bien plus que le bruit de la scie l’empêcha d’entendre la terrible voix de son père. Enfin, malgré son âge, celui-ci sauta lestement sur l’arbre soumis à l’action de la scie, et de là sur la poutre transversale qui soutenait le toit. Un coup violent fit voler dans le ruisseau le livre que tenait Julien, un second coup aussi violent, donné sur la tête, en forme de calotte, lui fit perdre l’équilibre. Il allait tomber à douze ou quinze pieds plus bas, au milieu des leviers de la machine en action, qui l’eussent brisé, mais son père le retint de la main gauche, comme il tombait.","It was in vain that he called Julien two or three times. The attention the young man gave to his book! much more than the sound of the saw prevented him from hearing his father's terrible voice. Finally, in spite of his age, he leapt nimbly onto the tree subjected to the action of the saw, and from there onto the transverse beam which supported the roof. A violent blow caused the book Julien was holding to fly into the stream; a second equally violent blow, given to the head, in the shape of a skullcap, made him lose his balance. He was about to fall twelve or fifteen feet below, in the middle of the levers of the moving machine, which would have broken him, but his father held him back with his left hand as he fell.","He called Julien two or three times, without being heard. More even than the noise of the saw, the young man’s intense focus on his book blocked out his father’s terrible voice. At last, despite his age, Sorel jumped onto the tree trunk being fed into the saw, and from there got up to the roof beam. A violent blow sent Julien’s book flying into the running water; a second blow, just as powerful, struck the young man on top of his head, making him lose his balance. He was about to drop some twelve or fifteen feet, right onto the machine’s moving levers, which would have beaten him to a pulp, but his father grabbed him with his left hand, even as he fell.","It was in vain that he called Julien two or three times. It was the young man’s concentration on his book, rather than the din made by the saw, which prevented him from hearing his father’s terrible voice. At last the latter, in spite of his age, jumped nimbly on to the tree that was undergoing the action of the saw, and from there on to the cross-bar that supported the roof. A violent blow made the book which Julien held, go flying into the stream; a second blow on the head, equally violent, which took the form of a box on the ears, made him lose his balance. He was on the point of falling twelve or fifteen feet lower down into the middle of the levers of the running machinery which would have cut him to pieces, but his father caught him as he fell, in his left hand."
"Elle lui remit une lettre décachetée mais repliée. Lui, sans l’ouvrir, regardait sa femme avec des yeux fous.","She handed him an unsealed but folded letter.

"L’amour-propre de M. de Rênal était inquiet; loin de songer à examiner le précepteur, il était tout occupé à chercher dans sa mémoire quelques mots latins enfin, il put dire un vers d’Horace. Julien ne savait de latin que sa Bible. Il répondit en fronçant le sourcil:","M. de Rênal's vanity was uneasy; far from dreaming of examining the tutor, he was completely occupied in searching his memory for a few Latin words, at last he was able to say a line from Horace. Julien only knew Latin from his Bible. He answered with a frown:","Monsieur de Rênal’s self-esteem was disquieted. He had absolutely no interest in examining the tutor, being totally concerned with rummaging about in his memory for Latin words. At last, he was able to recite a line from Horace. The only Latin Julien knew was the Bible. Knitting his eyebrows, he replied:","M. de Rênal’s self-esteem became uneasy. Instead of thinking of examining the tutor, his mind was concentrated in racking his memory for some other Latin words. Eventually he managed to spout a phrase of Horace. Julien knew no other Latin except his Bible. He answered with a frown."
"Sa politesse fut récompensée, sur les huit heures, on annonça Mme la maréchale de Fervaques. Julien s’échappa et reparut bientôt, vêtu avec le plus grand soin. Mme de La Mole lui sut un gré infini de cette marque de respect, et voulut lui témoigner sa satisfaction, en parlant de son voyage à Mme de Fervaques. Julien s’établit auprès de la maréchale, de façon à ce que ses yeux ne fussent pas aperçus de Mathilde. Placé ainsi, suivant toutes les règles de l’art, Mme de Fervaques fut pour lui l’objet de l’admiration la plus ébahie. C’est par une tirade sur ce sentiment que commençait la première des cinquante-trois lettres dont le prince Korasoff lui avait fait cadeau.","His politeness was rewarded, at eight o'clock Madame la Maréchale de Fervaques was announced. Julien escaped and soon reappeared, dressed with the greatest care. Madame de La Mole was infinitely grateful to him for this mark of respect, and wished to show her satisfaction by speaking to Madame de Fervaques of her trip. Julien settled down near the Maréchale, so that her eyes would not be seen by Mathilde. Placed thus, according to all the rules of the art, Madame de Fervaques was for him the object of the most amazed admiration. It was with a tirade on this feeling that the first of the fifty-three letters which Prince Korasoff had given him began.","His politeness was rewarded: at eight o’clock, Madame de Fervaques was announced. Julien slipped away and soon returned, dressed with the greatest care. Madame de La Mole was profoundly grateful, observing that he’d shown her guest such respect, and, wishing to testify to her pleasure, began to speak to Madame de Fervaques about his trip. Julien took a position near the marshall’s widow, making sure that, from where he was, it was impossible for Mathilde to see his eyes. So situated, and obeying all the rules of the game, Madame de Fervaques was able to furnish him with a source of dazzled admiration. He expressed these sentiments in a speech, drawn from the opening paragraph of the first of the fifty-three letters, generously presented to him by Prince Korasoff.","His politeness was rewarded; madame la Maréchale de Fervaques was announced about eight o’clock. Julien retired and shortly afterwards appeared dressed with the greatest care. Madame de la Mole was infinitely grateful to him for this mark of respect and made a point of manifesting her satisfaction by telling Madame de Fervaques about his journey. Julien established himself near the maréchale in such a position that Mathilde could not notice his eyes. In this position he lavished in accordance with all the rules in the art of love, the most abject admiration on Madame de Fervaques. The first of the 53 letters with which Prince Korasoff had presented him commenced with a tirade on this sentiment."
"En arrivant au nº 103 (c’était une petite chambrette de huit pieds en carré, au dernier étage de la maison), Julien remarqua qu’elle donnait sur les remparts, et par-delà on apercevait la jolie plaine que le Doubs sépare de la ville.","Arriving at No. 103 (it was a small room, eight feet square, on the top floor of the house), Julien noticed that it overlooked the ramparts, and beyond that you could see the pretty plain that the Doubs separates from the city.","He’d been looking at the trunk for three hours, and never recognized it.

"Julien s’était reproché trop souvent d’avoir laissé passer cette première insulte, pour souffrir ce regard. Il en demanda l’explication. L’homme en redingote lui adressa aussitôt les plus sales injures: tout ce qui était dans le café les entoura; les passants s’arrêtaient devant la porte. Par une précaution de provincial, Julien portait toujours des petits pistolets, sa main les serrait dans sa poche d’un mouvement convulsif. Cependant il fut sage, et se borna à répéter à son homme de minute en minute: Monsieur votre adresse? je vous méprise.","Julien had reproached himself too often for having let this first insult pass, to endure this look. He asked for an explanation. The man in the frock coat immediately addressed the dirtiest insults to him: everyone in the cafe surrounded them; passers-by stopped in front of the door.

However, he was wise, and confined himself to repeating to his man from minute to minute: Sir, your address? I despise you.","Julien had too often blamed himself for allowing that insult to go by to tolerate this stare. He demanded an explanation. The frock-coated man replied with the filthiest insults. Everyone in the café gathered around them; passersby stopped in the doorway. As a cautious provincial, Julien never went out without his pistols; his hand closed convulsively on them, in his pocket. But he was sensible, and limited himself to repeating, regularly, “Sir, your address? You are despicable.”","Julien had reproached himself too often for having endured the other insult to put up with this stare. He asked for an explanation. The man in the tail-coat immediately addressed him in the lowest and most insulting language. All the people in the café surrounded them. The passers-by stopped before the door. Julien always carried some little pistols as a matter of precaution. His hand was grasping them nervously in his pocket. Nevertheless he behaved wisely and confined himself to repeating to his man “Monsieur, your address; I despise you.”"
"— Ceci n’en était pas une reprit Julien avec effusion; je vous le jure, monsieur, je pensais tout haut, je cherchais dans mon esprit la route la plus sûre.","""That was not one,"" replied Julien effusively; I swear to you, sir, I was thinking aloud, I was searching in my mind for the safest route.","“That wasn’t a question,” Julien replied volubly. “I swear it, sir.

Il faut que, les premiers jours, ma présence l’ait intimidé. Dans le fait, tout ce que l’on rencontre dans cette maison est bien léger; je n’y vois que des vertus aidées par la vieillesse, et qui avaient grand besoin des glaces de l’âge. Ce jeune homme aura su voir la différence, il écrit bien mais je crains fort que cette demande de l’éclairer de mes conseils, qu’il me fait dans sa lettre, ne soit au fond qu’un sentiment qui s’ignore soi-même.","This unforeseen event in his life made him speak like an angel; and as self-love creeps even into the courtyards which serve as a temple to the most august virtue.

In fact, everything that one encounters in this house is very light; I see in it only virtues aided by old age, and which had great need of the ice of age.

It must be that, at first, being in my presence intimidated him. And it is true that everyone I meet in that house tends to be frivolous. The only virtue I find there is the sort that age brings with it, and which the frosts of growing old have immensely assisted. This young man, surely, knows the difference. He writes well, but I strongly suspect that the request he made in his letter, that I give him my advice, must really be founded in feelings of which he is himself not fully aware. “All the same, how often conversions begin this way!","This unexpected turn in his life made him talk like an angel, and inasmuch as a certain element of self-appreciation will insinuate itself even into those hearts which serve as a temple for the most august virtue, the maréchale said to herself as she got into her carriage, “Madame de la Mole is right, this young priest has distinction. My presence must have overawed him at first. As a matter of fact, the whole tone of this house is very frivolous; I can see nothing but instances of virtue helped by oldness, and standing in great need of the chills of age.

"Julien vit qu’il fallait monter à l’échelle lui-même, son agilité le servit bien. Il se chargea de diriger les tapissiers de la ville. L’abbé Chas enchanté le regardait voltiger d’échelle en échelle. Quand tous les piliers furent revêtus de damas, il fut question d’aller placer cinq énormes bouquets de plumes sur le grand baldaquin, au-dessus du maître-autel. Un riche couronnement de bois doré est soutenu par huit grandes colonnes torses en marbre d’Italie. Mais pour arriver au centre du baldaquin, au-dessus du tabernacle, il fallait marcher sur une vieille corniche en bois, peut-être vermoulue et à quarante pieds d’élévation.","Julien saw that he had to climb the ladder himself, his agility served him well. He undertook to direct the upholsterers of the city. The enchanted Abbé Chas watched him flit from ladder to ladder.

A rich crowning of gilded wood is supported by eight large twisted columns in Italian marble. But to get to the center of the canopy, above the tabernacle, you had to walk over an old wooden ledge, perhaps worm-eaten, and forty feet up.","Julien realized he’d have to go up the ladders himself; his nimbleness clearly came in handy. He took charge of the local decorators. Father Chas, delighted, watched him flying from one ladder to the next. Once all the pillars were wrapped in damask, huge feather clusters, five in all, had to be set above the main altar canopy. It was a rich, crowning work, in gilded wood, supported by eight great columns of Italian marble, spiraling from top to bottom. But to reach the center of the canopy, it was necessary to walk along an ancient wooden cornice, which was perhaps worm-eaten but was certainly forty feet high.","Julien saw that he would have to climb the ladder himself.

The nominal salaries were the same, but without counting the fat capons, the eggs, the fresh butter, and a thousand other details, equally attractive.

The only errands that took her to Verrières were the necessity of buying the new Mulhouse summer dresses, which were just ready.","It is a singular thing, and one which few amongst us will believe, but Madame de Rênal had no specific object in taking so much trouble.

"Julien était trop malheureux et surtout trop agité pour deviner une manoeuvre de passion aussi compliquée, encore moins put-il voir tout ce qu’elle avait de favorable pour lui: il en fut la victime; jamais peut-être son malheur n’avait été aussi excessif. Ses actions étaient tellement peu sous la direction de son esprit, que si quelque philosophe chagrin lui eût dit: a Songez à profiter rapidement des dispositions qui vont vous être favorables, dans ce genre d’amour de tête, que l’on voit à Paris, la même manière d’être ne peut durer plus de deux jours, il ne l’eût pas compris. Mais quelque exalté qu’il fût, Julien avait de l’honneur. Son premier devoir était la discrétion; il le comprit. Demander conseil, raconter son supplice au premier venu eût été un bonheur comparable à celui du malheureux qui, traversant un désert enflammé, reçoit du ciel une gorgée d’eau glacée. Il connut le péril, il craignit de répondre par un torrent de larmes à l’indiscret qui l’interrogerait; il s’enferma chez lui.","Julien was too unhappy and above all too agitated to guess such a complicated maneuver of passion, even less could he see all that it had for him: he was the victim of it; never perhaps had his misfortune been so excessive. His actions were so little under the direction of his mind that if some chagrin philosopher had said to him: , the same way of being cannot last more than two days, he would not have understood it. But however enthusiastic he was, Julien had some honor. His first duty was discretion; he understood it. Asking for advice, recounting his ordeal to the first comer would have been a happiness comparable to that of the unfortunate who, crossing a fiery desert, receives from the sky a sip of icy water. He knew the danger, he feared to answer with a torrent of tears to the indiscreet who questioned him; he shut himself up at home.","Julien was too miserable, and above all too shaken, to comprehend so complicated a passionate maneuver; still less was he able to understand how strongly positive were her feelings about him. Her maneuver still further defeated him: never, in all probability, had his misery been so extreme. His mind had so little control over his actions that, if some sour-tongued philosopher had said to him—“Think how you can quickly take advantage of any favorable inclinations. In this sort of mind-made love, as one sees it in Paris, no state of being lasts longer than two days”—Julien would not have understood him. But however excited, however exalted he might be, he retained his sense of honor. His primary responsibility was discretion; he understood that. To seek advice, to tell his suffering to the first person who came along, would have been, for him, happiness like that experienced by the lost soul who, crossing a burning desert, is blessed by a falling drop of ice-cold water. He knew the danger, he was sure he’d reply to any indiscreet questioner with a flood of tears; he shut himself in his room.","Julien was too unhappy, and above all too agitated to appreciate so complicated a stratagem of passion. Still less was he capable of seeing how favourable it really was to him. He was duped by it. His unhappiness had perhaps never been so extreme. His actions were so little controlled by his intellect that if some mournful philosopher had said to him, “Think how to exploit as quickly as you can those symptoms which promise to be favourable to you. In this kind of head-love which is seen at Paris, the same mood cannot last more than two days,” he would not have understood him. But however ecstatic he might feel, Julien was a man of honour. Discretion was his first duty. He appreciated it. Asking advice, describing his agony to the first man who came along would have constituted a happiness analogous to that of the unhappy man who, when traversing a burning desert receives from heaven a drop of icy water. He realised the danger, was frightened of answering an indiscreet question by a torrent of tears, and shut himself up in his own room."

"Ce cruel soupçon changea toute la position morale de Julien. Cette idée trouva dans son coeur un commencement d’amour qu’elle n’eut pas de peine à détruire. Cet amour n’était fondé que sur la rare beauté de Mathilde, ou plutôt sur ses façons de reine et sa toilette admirable. En cela Julien était encore un parvenu. Une jolie femme du grand monde est, à ce qu’on assure, ce qui étonne le plus un paysan homme d’esprit, quand il arrive aux premières classes de la société. Ce n’était point le caractère de Mathilde qui faisait rêver Julien les jours précédents. Il avait assez de sens pour comprendre qu’il ne connaissait point ce caractère. Tout ce qu’il en voyait pouvait n’être qu’une apparence.","This cruel suspicion changed Julien's whole moral position. This idea found in her heart a beginning of love which she had no difficulty in destroying.

A pretty woman of the high world is, it is said, what most astonishes a peasant man of spirit, when he arrives at the first classes of society. It was not Mathilde's character that made Julien dream the previous days. He had enough sense to understand that he did not know this character. All he saw of it could only be an appearance.","This bitter suspicion shifted Julien’s entire moral framework. The destructive idea confronted a budding love in his heart; it had no difficulty killing it off. His love had been based only on Mathilde’s rare beauty, or more likely on her queenly manner and the wonderful way she dressed. In such things, Julien was still a self-made social climber. It’s always said that a pretty aristocratic woman is the most astonishing thing of all, for a spirited peasant, when he reaches the higher rungs of society. It was hardly Mathilde’s character, all this time, that had set Julien to dreaming. He was sensible enough to understand that, in fact, he knew nothing about her character. Everything he’d been seeing of it might be no more than a pretense.","This cruel suspicion completely changed Julien’s psychological condition. The idea found in his heart a budding love which it had no difficulty in destroying. This love was only founded on Mathilde’s rare beauty, or rather on her queenly manners and her admirable dresses.

We are assured that there is nothing equal to a pretty society woman for dazzling a peasant who is at the same time a man of intellect, when he is admitted to first class society.

"La possibilité de faire fortune avec Fouqué donnait une certaine facilité aux raisonnements de Julien; ils n’étaient plus aussi souvent gâtés par l’irritation, et le sentiment vif de sa pauvreté et de sa bassesse aux yeux du monde. Placé comme sur un promontoire élevé, il pouvait juger et dominait pour ainsi dire l’extrême pauvreté et l’aisance qu’il appelait encore richesse. Il était loin de juger sa position en philosophe, mais il eut assez de clairvoyance pour se sentir différent après ce petit voyage dans la montagne.","The possibility of making a fortune with Fouqué gave a certain facility to Julien's reasoning; they were no longer so often spoiled by irritation, and the keen sense of his poverty and baseness in the eyes of the world. Placed as on a high promontory, he could judge and dominated, so to speak, the extreme poverty and the ease which he still called wealth. He was far from judging his position as a philosopher, but he had enough clairvoyance to feel different after this little trip to the mountains.","The thought that he could have made money with Fouqué brought a certain ease to Julien’s mind: it was not so regularly corrupted by irritability and the strong sense of his poverty, his inferior status in the world’s eyes. Located as if on a high promontory, he was able to evaluate and, one might say, rise above both extreme poverty and the extreme comfort that, still, he called wealth. He was by no means possessed of a fully elaborated philosophy, but he had enough insight to feel himself different, after his short trip up the mountain.","The possibility of making a fortune with Fouqué gave a certain facility to Julien’s logic. It was not spoilt quite so frequently by the irritation and the keen consciousness of his poverty and low estate in the eyes of the world. Placed as it were on a high promontory, he was able to exercise his judgment, and had a commanding view, so to speak, of both extreme poverty and that competence which he still called wealth. He was far from judging his position really philosophically, but he had enough penetration to feel different after this little journey into the mountain."

"La maréchale annonça qu’elle allait à l’Opéra-Buffa. Julien y courut; il trouva le chevalier de Beauvoisis, qui l’emmena dans une loge de messieurs les gentilshommes de la chambre, justement à côté de la loge de Mme de Fervaques. Julien la regarda constamment. Il faut, se dit-il en rentrant à l’hôtel, que je tienne un journal de siège; autrement j’oublierais mes attaques. Il se força à écrire deux ou trois pages sur ce sujet ennuyeux, et parvint ainsi, chose admirable, à ne presque pas penser à Mlle de La Mole.","The Maréchale announced that she was going to the Opéra-Buffa. Julien ran there; he found the Chevalier de Beauvoisis, who took him to a box of gentlemen of the chamber, just next to Madame de Fervaques' box. Julien looked at her constantly. I must, he said to himself on returning to the hotel, keep a siege journal; otherwise I would forget my attacks. He forced himself to write two or three pages on this boring subject, and thus succeeded, admirable thing, in hardly thinking of Mademoiselle de La Mole.","The marshall’s widow had declared her intention of going to the opera buffa. Julien hurried over, and found the Chevalier de Beauvoisis, who conducted him to a box set aside for the king’s gentlemen-in-waiting, which was next to Madame de Fervaques’s private box. Julien never took his eyes off her. “I need,” he said to himself, when he left, “to begin a siege journal; otherwise I’ll forget my onslaughts.” He compelled himself to write two or three pages on this boring topic, and thus very nearly succeeded—what a wonderful thing!—in not thinking of Mademoiselle de La Mole.","The maréchale announced that she was going to the Opera-Bouffe. Julien rushed there. He ran across the Chevalier de Beauvoisis who took him into a box occupied by messieurs the Gentlemen of the Chamber, just next to Madame de Fervaques’ box.

"Peu à peu on prit la douce habitude d’écrire presque tous les jours.

What! to give presents to a man with whom we are perfectly happy, and who serves us well? it would be in the event that he neglected himself that his zeal would have to be stimulated.","“What foolishness!” he replied. “How now!

That would make sense only if he were negligent and we needed to stimulate his zeal.”","“What nonsense,” he answered, “the very idea of giving presents to a man with whom we are perfectly satisfied and who is a good servant. It will only be if he is remiss that we shall have to stimulate his zeal.”"

Mademoiselle de La Mole looked at him in astonishment: So I was on the point of being killed by my lover! she thought to herself.","The whole process, very slow toward the end, lasted a solid minute. . . .

"Comment! pensa Julien étonné et amusé, une personne d’une si haute vertu vanter un roman!

"Elle se promenait avec lui au moment de ce propos maladroit; elle le quitta, et son dernier regard exprimait le plus affreux mépris. Rentrée au salon, de toute la soirée elle ne le regarda plus.

"Julien avait beau se faire petit et sot, il ne pouvait plaire, il était trop différent. Cependant, se disait-il, tous ces professeurs sont gens très fins, et choisis entre mille; comment n’aiment-ils pas mon humilité? Un seul lui semblait abuser de sa complaisance à tout croire et à sembler dupe de tout. C’était l’abbé Chas-Bernard, directeur des cérémonies de la cathédrale, où, depuis quinze ans, on lui faisait espérer une place de chanoine; en attendant il enseignait l’éloquence sacrée au séminaire. Dans le temps de son aveuglement, ce cours était un de ceux où Julien se trouvait le plus habituellement le premier.

However, he said to himself, all these professors are very shrewd people, chosen from among a thousand; how do they not like my humility?

It was the Abbé Chas-Bernard, director of ceremonies at the cathedral, where for fifteen years he had been held out to hope for a place as a canon; meanwhile he was teaching sacred eloquence at the seminary. During the time of his blindness, this course was one of those where Julien was usually first. The Abbé Chas had left there to show him his friendship, and when he left his class he gladly took him under his arm to take a few tours of the garden.","Julien had tried in vain to make himself small and stupid: he could not be liked; he was far too different. “But,” he told himself, “all our professors are notable people and one in a thousand. Why aren’t they happy about my humility?” Just one of them seemed willing to waste his kindness by believing in and being fooled by everything. This was Father Chas-Bernard, director of ceremonials at the cathedral, where for fifteen years he’d been led to expect a post as canon, and where, while he waited, he taught sacred eloquence at the seminary. In Julien’s blind period, this was one of the classes where he was regularly the top student. Father Chas had demonstrated affection for this prize pupil; when class was over, he would take Julien’s arm and walk in the garden with him.","It was in vain that Julien pretended to be petty and stupid. He could not please; he was too different. Yet all these professors, he said to himself, are very clever people, men in a thousand. Why do they not like my humility? Only one seemed to take advantage of his readiness to believe everything, and apparently to swallow everything. This was the Abbé Chas-Bernard, the director of the ceremonies of the cathedral, where, for the last fifteen years, he had been given occasion to hope for a canonry. While waiting, he taught homiletics at the seminary. During the period of Julien’s blindness, this class was one of those in which he most frequently came out top. The Abbé Chas had used this as an opportunity to manifest some friendship to him, and when the class broke up, he would be glad to take him by the arm for some turns in the garden."
"Julien resta immobile, il ne voyait plus. Quand il revint un peu à lui, il aperçut tous les fidèles qui s’enfuyaient de l’église; le prêtre avait quitté l’autel.

"Il est possible que ce trio se moque de moi, pensait Julien. On connaît bien peu son caractère, si l’on ne voit pas déjà l’expression sombre et froide que prirent ses regards en répondant à ceux de Mathilde.

We know very little of her character, if we do not already see the somber and cold expression which her looks took on answering those of Mathilde.

Julien s’assura que la porte était fermée avec tous ses verrous; il pensait bien à regarder sous le lit, mais n’osait pas; on avait pu y placer un ou deux laquais. Enfin il craignit un reproche futur de sa prudence et regarda.","Then the embarrassment began again, it was great on both sides. Julien made sure that the door was closed with all its bolts; he was thinking of looking under the bed, but did not dare; one or two lackeys could have been placed there. Finally he feared a future reproach of his prudence and looked.","Then they were once again seriously embarrassed, both of them. Julien made sure that the door had been properly closed, all the bolts thrown. He’d thought of looking under the bed but did not dare; there could be a servant or two under there. In the end, he was so worried that prudence would make him regret the omission, at some future date, that he looked.","Then their embarrassment began again; it was great on both sides. Julien assured himself that the door was completely locked; he thought of looking under the bed, but he did not dare; “they might have stationed one or two lackeys there.” Finally he feared that he might reproach himself in the future for this lack of prudence, and did look."

"Telles furent les seules paroles que Julien entendit. Elles suffirent pour le pénétrer de la plus haute admiration. C’est ainsi, pensa-t-il, qu’on traite les affaires, que dirait ce grand homme d’État, s’il entendait les bavards passionnés d’il y a trois jours?","These were the only words Julien heard.

"Il se consola un peu par une idée, qu’il ne dit pas à sa femme: avec de l’adresse et en se prévalant des idées romanesques du jeune homme, il espérait l’engager, pour une somme moindre, à refuser les offres de M. Valenod.","He consoled himself a little with an idea, which he did not tell his wife: with skill and taking advantage of the young man's romantic ideas, he hoped to induce him, for a lesser sum, to refuse the offers. by M.

With the exercise of some skill, and by exploiting the romantic ideas of the young man, he hoped to be able to induce him to refuse M. Valenod’s offer at a cheaper price."
"Quand on m’aime! se répétait Julien, cela ne veut rien dire, ou veut tout dire. Voilà des secrets de langage qui manquent à nos pauvres provinciaux. Et il songea beaucoup à Mme de Rênal, en copiant une lettre immense destinée à la maréchale.","When I am loved! Julien repeated to himself, that means nothing, or means everything. These are the secrets of language that our poor provincials lack. And he thought a great deal about Madame de Rênal, while copying an immense letter intended for the Marshal.","“People who love me!” Julien was repeating. “Either that means nothing, or it means everything. Here are the secrets of language, unavailable to us poor provincials.” And as he copied out an immense letter, meant for the marshall’s widow, he spent much of the time thinking about Madame de Rênal.","Besides, the man did not have a sufficiently supple soul to appreciate masterpieces of art.” “When you like me,” Julien kept on repeating to himself, “that means nothing or means everything. Here we have mysteries of language which are beyond us poor provincials.” And he thought a great deal about Madame de Rênal, as he copied out an immense letter destined for the maréchale."

"Les phrases toutes faites convenaient assez à l’esprit de la maîtresse de la maison, elle adopta celle-ci sur Julien et se sut bon gré d’avoir engagé l’académicien à dîner. Il amuse M. de La Mole, pensait-elle.","The ready-made phrases suited the spirit of the mistress of the house well enough, she adopted this one on Julien and was glad to have invited the academician to dinner.

"Aucune hypocrisie ne venait altérer la pureté de cette âme naïve, égarée par une passion qu’elle n’avait jamais éprouvée. Elle était trompée, mais à son insu, et cependant un instinct de vertu était effrayé. Tels étaient les combats qui l’agitaient quand Julien parut au jardin. Elle l’entendit parler, presque au même instant elle le vit s’asseoir à ses côtés. Son âme fut comme enlevée par ce bonheur charmant qui depuis quinze jours l’étonnait plus encore qu’il ne la séduisait. Tout était imprévu pour elle. Cependant, après quelques instants, il suffit donc, se dit-elle, de la présence de Julien pour effacer tous ses torts? Elle fut effrayée; ce fut alors qu’elle lui ôta sa main.","No hypocrisy came to alter the purity of this naive soul, led astray by a passion she had never experienced. She was deceived, but unwittingly, and yet an instinct of virtue was frightened. Such were the combats which agitated him when Julien appeared in the garden. She heard him speak, almost at the same time she saw him sit beside her. Her soul was as if carried away by this charming happiness which for a fortnight had astonished her even more than it seduced her. Everything was unexpected for her. However, after a few moments, is it enough, she told herself, for Julien's presence to erase all her wrongs? She was frightened; it was then that she took her hand away from him.","No hypocrisy intruded on the purity of this naÏve soul, distracted by a passion it had never experienced. She was deceived, but all unawares, although a virtuous instinct took fright. These were the struggles still shaking her when Julien appeared in the garden. She heard his voice almost at the same moment she saw him sit down beside her. And her soul felt itself soaring, lifted by the bewitching happiness that, for two weeks, had seduced but had, even more, astonished her. For her, it was all unknown. However, a few moments later she asked herself: “Is Julien’s presence enough to wipe away all his wrongdoing?” She was frightened; that was when he had taken her hand.","No hypocrisy had sullied the purity of that naïve soul, now swept away by a passion such as it had never felt before. She deceived herself, but without knowing it. But none the less, a certain instinct of virtue was alarmed. Such were the combats which were agitating her when Julien appeared in the garden. She heard him speak and almost at the same moment she saw him sit down by her side. Her soul was as it were transported by this charming happiness which had for the last fortnight surprised her even more than it had allured. Everything was novel for her. None the less, she said to herself after some moments, “the mere presence of Julien is quite enough to blot out all his wrongs.” She was frightened; it was then that she took away her hand."
"— Ah! elle tiendra, dit-il à Julien d’un air content. Voulez-vous vous éloigner un peu?","- Ah! it will hold, he said to Julien with a pleased air. Do you want to step away a bit?","It will stay on,” he said to Julien happily. “Would you step back a bit?”","it will keep on,” he said to Julien with an air of satisfaction. “Do you mind going a little way off?”"
"Ces messieurs, quoique très nobles, pensa Julien, ne sont point ennuyeux comme les personnes qui viennent dîner chez M. de La Mole, et je vois pourquoi, ajouta-t-il un instant après ils se permettent d’être indécents. On parlait des danseuses que le public avait distinguées dans un ballet donné la veille. Ces messieurs faisaient allusion à des anecdotes piquantes que Julien et son témoin, le lieutenant du 96e, ignoraient absolument. Julien n’eut point la sottise de prétendre les savoir; il avoua de bonne grâce son ignorance. Cette franchise plut à l’ami du chevalier, il lui raconta ces anecdotes dans les plus grands détails, et fort bien.","These gentlemen, although very noble, thought Julien, are not boring like the people who come to dine with M. de La Mole, and I see why, he added a moment later, they allow themselves to be indecent. They were talking about the dancers whom the public had distinguished in a ballet given the day before. These gentlemen alluded to piquant anecdotes that Julien and his witness, the lieutenant of the 96th, were absolutely unaware of. Julien was not stupid enough to pretend to know them; he admitted his ignorance with good grace. This frankness pleased the knight's friend, he told him these anecdotes in the greatest detail, and very well.","“These gentlemen,” thought Julien, “although they’re noblemen, are not anything like so boring as those who dine with Monsieur de La Mole. And I see why,” he added, a moment later. “They allow themselves indecorous talk.” Some dancers were mentioned, who had been honored by the audience, at a ballet given the previous evening. The gentlemen told certain spicy stories that neither Julien nor his second, the lieutenant of the Ninety-sixth, had ever heard. Julien was not so stupid that he pretended to know them; he openly admitted his ignorance. His candor pleased the chevalier’s friend; he had told these stories in very substantial detail, and told them extremely well.","“These gentlemen, although very noble, are by no means as boring,” thought Julien, “as the people who come and dine at M. de la Mole’s, and I can see why,” he added a moment afterwards. “They allow themselves to be indecent.” They talked about the dancers that the public had distinguished with its favour at the ballet presented the night before. The two gentlemen alluded to some spicy anecdotes of which Julien and his second, the lieutenant of the 96th, were absolutely ignorant. Julien was not stupid enough to pretend to know them. He confessed his ignorance with a good grace. This frankness pleased the chevalier’s friend. He told him these stories with the greatest detail and extremely well."
"Le soleil en baissant, et rapprochant le moment décisif fit battre le coeur de Julien d’une façon singulière. La nuit vint. Il observa avec une joie qui lui ôta un poids immense de dessus la poitrine, qu’elle serait fort obscure. Le ciel chargé de gros nuages, promenés par un vent très chaud, semblait annoncer une tempête. Les deux amies se promenèrent fort tard. Tout ce qu’elles faisaient ce soir-là semblait singulier à Julien. Elles jouissaient de ce temps, qui, pour certaines âmes délicates, semble augmenter le plaisir d’aimer.","As the sun set, bringing the decisive moment closer, Julien's heart beat in a strange way. The night came. He observed with a joy that took an immense weight off his chest, that it would be very dark. The sky laden with heavy clouds, driven by a very hot wind, seemed to announce a storm. The two friends went for a walk very late. Everything they were doing that evening seemed strange to Julien. They enjoyed this time, which, for certain delicate souls, seems to increase the pleasure of loving.","The setting sun, and the decisive moment coming nearer, made Julien’s heart beat in the most remarkable fashion. Night fell. He saw, with a joy that lifted an immense weight from his heart, that it was going to be exceedingly dark. Heavy clouds filled the sky, blown by a hot, sticky wind: a storm seemed to be coming. The two women walked and walked, and it grew late. Everything they did on this night struck Julien as bizarre. They toyed with time: for certain sensitive souls, this appears to magnify the pleasures of love.","The setting of the sun which brought the crucial moment nearer and nearer made Julien’s heart beat in a strange way. Night came. He noticed with a joy, which took an immense weight off his heart, that it was going to be very dark. The sky, which was laden with big clouds that had been brought along by a sultry wind, seemed to herald a storm. The two friends went for their walk very late. All they did that night struck Julien as strange. They were enjoying that hour which seems to give certain refined souls an increased pleasure in loving."
"Une fille d’un caractère si altier se serait oubliée jusqu’à faire des avances matérielles!… Lui serrer le bras au jardin, un soir, quelle horreur! comme si elle n’avait pas eu cent moyens moins indécents de lui faire connaître qu’elle le distinguait.","A girl of such haughty character would have forgotten herself so far as to make material advances!… To shake her arm in the garden, one evening, what a horror! as if she had not had a hundred less indecent means of letting him know that she distinguished him.","“A girl of such lofty character, so far forgetting herself that she makes physical advances!

As if she hadn’t a hundred less indecent ways of letting him know she was thinking of him.",“The idea of a girl of so proud a character so far forgetting herself as to make physical advances! To think of pressing his arm in the garden in the evening! How horrible! As though there were not a hundred other less unseemly ways of notifying him that he was the object of her favour.
"Le lendemain, il surprit encore Norbert et sa soeur qui parlaient de lui. A son arrivée, un silence de mort s’établit, comme la veille. Ses soupçons n’eurent plus de bornes. Ces aimables jeunes gens auraient-ils entrepris de se moquer de moi? Il faut avouer que cela est beaucoup plus probable, beaucoup plus naturel qu’une prétendue passion de Mlle de La Mole, pour un pauvre diable de secrétaire. D’abord, ces gens-là ont-ils des passions? Mystifier est leur fort. Ils sont jaloux de ma pauvre petite supériorité de paroles. Être jaloux est encore un de leurs faibles. Tout s’explique dans ce système. Mlle de La Mole veut me persuader qu’elle me distingue, tout simplement pour me donner en spectacle à son prétendu.","The next day he again overheard Norbert and his sister talking about him. When he arrived, a dead silence fell, like the day before. His suspicions knew no bounds. Would these amiable young people have undertaken to make fun of me? It must be admitted that this is much more probable, much more natural than an alleged passion of Mademoiselle de La Mole for a poor devil of a secretary. First, do these people have passions? Mystifying is their forte. They are jealous of my poor little superiority of words. Being jealous is still one of their weaknesses. Everything is explained in this system. Mademoiselle de La Mole wants to persuade me that she distinguishes me, quite simply to show me off to her pretender.","Again the next day, he surprised Norbert and his sister, who had been speaking of him. As he joined them, a deathly silence fell, exactly like the previous evening. He was hugely suspicious. Are these pleasant young people planning a way to make fun of me? He had to admit this was far more likely, and much more natural, than Mademoiselle de La Mole’s pretended passion for a poor devil of a secretary. “In any case, do these people ever experience passion? Mystification is their specialty. They’re jealous of my tongue’s miserable little superiority. Jealousy remains one of their weaknesses. They’re transparently clear. Mademoiselle de La Mole wants me to think she’s interested in me, quite simply so she can turn me into a spectacle for her intended husband.”","The following day he again caught Norbert and his sister talking about him. A funereal silence was established on his arrival as on the previous day. His suspicions were now unbounded. “Can these charming young people have started to make fun of me? I must own this is much more probable, much more natural than any suggested passion on the part of Mademoiselle de la Mole for a poor devil of a secretary. In the first place, have those people got any passions at all? Mystification is their strong point. They are jealous of my poor little superiority in speaking. Being jealous again is one of their weaknesses. On that basis everything is explicable. Mademoiselle de la Mole simply wants to persuade me that she is marking me out for special favour in order to show me off to her betrothed.”"

"L’avocat, homme de règle et de formalités, le croyait fou et pensait avec le public que c’était la jalousie qui lui avait mis le pistolet à la main. Un jour, il hasarda de faire entendre à Julien que cette allégation, vraie ou fausse, serait un excellent moyen de plaidoirie. Mais l’accusé redevint en un clin d’oeil un être passionné et incisif.","The lawyer, a man of rules and formalities, believed him mad and thought with the public that it was jealousy that had put the gun in his hand. One day he ventured to make Julien understand that this allegation, true or false, would be an excellent means of pleading. But the accused became in the twinkling of an eye a passionate and incisive being.","The defense lawyer, a man of rules and formalities, thought Julien was crazy; like the public at large, he thought it was jealousy that had made him pick up his pistols.

But the accused was instantly transformed back into a fiery and mordant creature.","The advocate, who was a red-tape pedant, thought him mad, and believed, with the public, that it was jealousy which had led him to take up the pistol.

But the accused man became in a single minute a passionate and drastic individual."
"Le soir, Julien hésita beaucoup avant d’entrer au spectacle, il avait des idées étranges sur ce lieu de perdition.","In the evening, Julien hesitated a lot before entering the show, he had strange ideas about this place of perdition.","That evening, Julien hesitated a long time before allowing himself to go to the theater: he had strange notions about these hellish places.","In the evening, Julien hesitated a great deal before going to the theatre.

Je l’ai averti que j’avais à lui parler, et il ne daigne pas reparaître!","But, my God! she added almost with the desire to cry, isn't he a perfect man? it is the masterpiece of education of this century; you can't look at him without finding something lovable, and even witty, to tell you, he's brave… But this Sorel is singular, she thought, and her eyes changed from sad to angry. . I warned him that I had to speak to him, and he does not deign to reappear!","“But, God in heaven!” she added, very close to tears, “isn’t he a perfect man? He’s this century’s masterpiece of education: you just look at him, and he finds something lovable, even spiritual, to tell you. He’s brave. . . . But Sorel is peculiar,” she told herself, and her eyes exchanged their sorrowful appearance for an angry one. “I let him know I had something to tell him, and he can’t take the trouble to come back!”","“My God though,” she added, while she almost felt as if she would like to cry, “isn’t he really quite perfect? He’s a paragon of the education of the age; you can’t look at him without his finding something charming and even witty to say to you; he is brave. But that Sorel is strange,” she said to herself, and the expression of her eyes changed from melancholy to anger. “I told him that I had something to say to him and he hasn’t deigned to reappear.”"
"Julien ne comprenait rien à tous les noms modernes comme Southey, lord Byron, George, qu’il entendait prononcer pour la première fois. Mais il n’échappa à personne que, toutes les fois qu’il était question de faits passés à Rome, et dont la connaissance pouvait se déduire des ouvres d’Horace, de Martial, de Tacite, etc., il avait une incontestable supériorité.

But no one could doubt that, whenever events in Rome were at issue, knowledge of which could be gathered from the works of Horace, Martial, Tacitus, etc. , he was unquestionably the superior. Julien unceremoniously drew on ideas he’d acquired from the Bishop of Besançon, in the jolly discussion he’d had with that prelate. Nor were these the least appreciated.","Julien found meaningless such modern names as Southey, Lord Byron, and George IV, which he now heard pronounced for the first time.

Julien coolly appropriated several ideas which he had learnt from the bishop of Besançon in the historic conversation which he had had with that prelate. These ideas were not the least appreciated."
"Mais le juge était formaliste avant tout. Les déclarations de Julien n’abrégeaient nullement les interrogatoires, l’amour-propre du juge fut piqué.

"— Ou bien, dit Altamira sortant enfin de son profond silence, serait-ce ce que je t’ai dit vingt fois? tout simplement de la vanité française; c’est le souvenir de son père, le fameux marchand de draps, qui fait le malheur de ce caractère naturellement morne et sec.

Certainement on ne me reprochera pas une seconde faiblesse j’en mourrais de honte.","If there is a revolution, why shouldn't Julien Sorel play the role of Roland, and I that of Madame Roland? I like this role better than that of Madame de Staël: the immorality of conduct will be an obstacle in our century. Certainly no one will reproach me for a second weakness, I would die of shame.","“If there is another revolution, why couldn’t Julien play the role of Roland, and I the part of that Girondin leader, Madame Roland? I’d prefer being her to being Madame de Staël: in our time, personal immorality will be an obstacle. No one’s ever going to reproach me for falling twice; I’d die of shame.”",“If there is a revolution why should not Julien Sorel play the rôle of Roland and I the rôle of Madame Roland? I prefer that part to Madame de Stael’s; the immorality of my conduct will constitute an obstacle in this age of ours. I will certainly not let them reproach me with an act of weakness; I should die of shame.”
"Mais Julien s’était assuré qu’elle avait toujours dans sa chambre un ou deux des volumes les plus philosophiques de Voltaire. Lui-même volait souvent quelques tomes de la belle édition si magnifiquement reliée. En écartant un peu chaque volume de son voisin, il cachait l’absence de celui qu’il emportait; mais bientôt il s’aperçut qu’une autre personne lisait Voltaire. Il eut recours à une finesse de séminaire, il plaça quelques petits morceaux de crin sur les volumes qu’il supposait pouvoir intéresser Mlle de La Mole. Ils disparaissaient pendant des semaines entières.","But Julien had made sure that she always had one or two of Voltaire's most philosophical volumes in her room. He himself often stole a few volumes from the beautifully bound edition. By pushing each volume away from its neighbor a little, he hid the absence of the one he was carrying; but soon he perceived that another person was reading Voltaire. He had recourse to the finesse of a seminary, he placed a few small pieces of horsehair on the volumes which he supposed might interest Mlle de La Mole. They disappeared for whole weeks.","But Julien knew for sure that she always had, in her room, one or two of Voltaire’s most philosophical books. He himself had often secretly borrowed volumes of that magnificently bound edition. He would separate somewhat the remaining books, concealing what he had borrowed, but soon realized that someone else was reading Voltaire. He fell back on a seminary trick, putting a few strands of hair in volumes he imagined might well interest Mademoiselle de La Mole. As the weeks went by, all the hair disappeared.","But Julien had assured himself that she always had one or two of Voltaire’s most philosophic volumes in her room. He himself would often steal some tomes of that fine edition which was so magnificently bound.

"— Eh bien! monsieur, lui dit-il enfin avec un soupir et de l’air dont il eût appelé le chirurgien pour l’opération la plus douloureuse, j accède à votre demande. A compter d’après-demain, qui est le premier du mois, je vous donne cinquante francs par mois.","- Well! Sir, he said to him at last, with a sigh and the air he would have called for the surgeon for the most painful operation, I accede to your request. From the day after tomorrow, which is the first of the month, I will give you fifty francs a month.","At these words, Monsieur de Rênal saw Julien established at Monsieur Valenod’s house. “Ah well, sir,” he said at last, with a sigh and the same demeanor as when he asked a surgeon not to make things more painful than strictly necessary, “you’ll have what you want. Starting the day after tomorrow, which will be the first of the month, I’ll give you fifty francs a month.”","At these words M. de Rênal saw Julien installed with M.

"Un homme comme moi se doit de réparer cet échec, et saisissant le moment où l’on passait d’une pièce à l’autre, il crut de son devoir de donner un baiser à Mme de Rênal.","A man like me must repair this failure, and seizing the moment when we passed from one room to another, he thought it his duty to give Madame de Rênal a kiss.","“A man like me has got to reverse this defeat”—and seizing a moment when they were going from one room to another, he fancied himself obliged to give Madame de Rênal a kiss.","“A man like I am ought to make up for this check!” and seizing the moment when they were passing from one room to another, he thought it was his duty to give Madame de Rênal a kiss."

"Ils se parlaient sans cesse, et avec un intérêt extrême quoique toujours de choses fort innocentes.

It was no longer the intoxication of love, it was extreme gratitude.

La pauvreté de cette petite maison où l’on devrait vivre avec cinquante louis de rentes, se peignait à elle sous des couleurs ravissantes. Julien pourrait très bien se faire avocat à Bray, la sous-préfecture à deux lieues de Verrières; dans ce cas elle le verrait quelquefois.","Madame de Rênal thought herself ill; a sort of fever prevented him from falling asleep; she only lived when she had her maid or Julien in front of her.

A kind of fever prevented her from sleeping. She only lived when either her maid or Julien were in sight.

"— Tant pis! dit Julien; du moins, quand on fait des crimes, faut-il les faire avec plaisir; ils n’ont que cela de bon, et l’on ne peut même les justifier un peu que par cette raison.","- Never mind! said Julien; at least, when one commits crimes, one must do them with pleasure; they have only that good, and one cannot even justify them a little for that reason alone.","“So much the worse!” said Julien. “At the very least, crimes ought to be committed with pleasure. That’s the only good about them: How can we even begin to justify them for any other reason?”","People commit acts of the greatest cruelty, but without any feeling of cruelty.” “So much the worse,” said Julien; “when one does commit a crime one ought at least to take pleasure in committing it; that’s the only good thing they have about them and that’s the only way in which they have the slightest justification.”"
"L’humeur hautaine de Julien fut choquée de l’insolence des laquais. Il se mit à parcourir Tes dortoirs de l’antique abbaye, secouant toutes les portes qu’il rencontrait. Une fort petite céda à ses efforts, et il se trouva dans une cellule au milieu des valets de chambre de Monseigneur, en habit noir et la chaîne au cou. A son air pressé, ces messieurs le crurent mandé par l’évêque et le laissèrent passer. Il fit quelques pas et se trouva dans une immense salle gothique extrêmement sombre, et toute lambrissée de chêne noir; à l’exception d’une seule, les fenêtres en ogive avaient été murées avec des briques. La grossièreté de cette maçonnerie n’était déguisée par rien, et faisait un triste contraste avec l’antique magnificence de la boiserie. Les deux grands côtés de cette salle célèbre parmi les antiquaires bourguignons et que le duc Charles le Téméraire avait fait bâtir vers 1470 en expiation de quelque péché, étaient garnis de stalles de bois richement sculptées. On y voyait, figurés en bois de différentes couleurs, tous les mystères de l’Apocalypse.","Julien's haughty mood was shocked by the insolence of the lackeys. He began to walk through Your dormitories of the ancient abbey, shaking all the doors he came across. A very small girl yielded to his efforts, and he found himself in a cell among Monseigneur's servants, in black coats and chains around their necks. From his hurried air, these gentlemen thought he had been summoned by the bishop and let him pass. He took a few steps and found himself in an immense, extremely dark Gothic room, all paneled in black oak; except for one, the pointed windows had been bricked up. The coarseness of this masonry was disguised by nothing, and formed a sad contrast with the ancient magnificence of the woodwork. The two long sides of this hall, famous among Burgundian antique dealers and which Duke Charles the Bold had built around 1470 in expiation for some sin, were lined with richly carved wooden stalls. We saw there, figured in wood of different colors, all the mysteries of the Apocalypse.","Julien was too haughty not to be shocked by these lackeys’ insolence. He began to go from one door to another, through the old church’s interior, trying every door he met with. One small door opened at his touch, and he found himself in the middle of an anteroom full of His Lordship’s valets, all wearing black and wearing gold chains around their necks. Seeing how urgent he was, these gentlemen thought he’d been sent for by the bishop and allowed him to proceed. A few more steps, and Julien found himself in a huge Gothic hall, extremely dark, paneled in black oak; with a single exception, the high-pointed Gothic windows had been bricked over. There had been no attempt to disguise this coarse bricklaying, which was in sad contrast to the archaic beauty of the woodwork. The two longer walls of the hall, famous among Burgundy’s antiquarians, and which Duke Charles the Bold had erected, about 1470, in expiation of one or another sin, were furnished with wooden stalls, richly carved. All the mysteries of the Apocalypse were there, portrayed by wood painted in various colors.","Julien’s haughty temper was shocked by the lackeys’ insolence. He started to traverse the corridors of the ancient abbey, and to shake all the doors which he found. A very small one yielded to his efforts, and he found himself in a cell in the midst of Monseigneur’s valets, who were dressed in black suits with chains on their necks. His hurried manner made these gentlemen think that he had been sent by the bishop, and they let him pass. He went some steps further on, and found himself in an immense Gothic hall, which was extremely dark, and completely wainscotted in black oak. The ogive windows had all been walled in with brick except one. There was nothing to disguise the coarseness of this masonry, which offered a melancholy contrast to the ancient magnificence of the woodwork. The two great sides of this hall, so celebrated among Burgundian antiquaries, and built by the Duke, Charles the Bold, about 1470 in expiation of some sin, were adorned with richly sculptured wooden stalls. All the mysteries of the Apocalypse were to be seen portrayed in wood of different colours."

"Ces mots confirmèrent le bonheur de Julien, qui, dans ce moment, était extrême: il parla, il oublia de feindre, il parut l’homme le plus aimable aux deux amies qui l’écoutaient. Cependant il y avait encore un peu de manque de courage dans cette éloquence qui lui arrivait tout à coup. Il craignait mortellement que Mme Derville fatiguée du vent qui commençait à s’élever et qui précédait la tempête, ne voulût rentrer seule au salon. Alors il serait resté en tête-à-tête avec Mme de Rênal. Il avait eu presque par hasard le courage aveugle qui suffit pour agir; mais il sentait qu’il était hors de sa puissance de dire le mot le plus simple à Mme de Rênal. Quelque légers que fussent ses reproches, il allait être battu, et l’avantage qu’il venait d’obtenir anéanti.","These words confirmed Julien's happiness, which at that moment was extreme: he spoke, he forgot to pretend, he seemed the loveliest man to the two friends who were listening to him. However, there was still a little lack of courage in this eloquence which suddenly came to him.

Then he would have stayed alone with Madame de Rênal. He had had, almost by chance, the blind courage which suffices to act; but he felt that it was beyond his power to say the simplest word to Madame de Rênal. However slight his reproaches, he was about to be beaten, and the advantage he had just obtained annihilated.","Her words confirmed Julien’s happiness, which right then was extraordinarily full : he talked, he forgot to forge and counterfeit; both listening ladies found him the most amiable of men. But still, in the midst of his eloquence, he felt a sudden sinking fear. He was mortally afraid that Madame Derville, tired of the wind, which in advance of the storm was growing stronger, might want to go back to the drawing room by herself. And then he would be left face-to-face with Madame de Rênal. Almost accidentally, he had had enough blind courage to do what he’d meant to do, but he felt it was utterly out of his power to say the simplest word to Madame de Rênal. No matter how gently she might reprove him, he was going to be beaten in battle, and the advantage he had just won would be annihilated.","These words confirmed Julien’s happiness, which at the present moment was extreme; he spoke, he forgot to pose, and appeared the most charming man in the world to the two friends who were listening to him. Nevertheless, there was a slight lack of courage in all this eloquence which had suddenly come upon him. He was mortally afraid that Madame Derville would get tired of the wind before the storm, which was beginning to rise, and want to go back alone into the salon. He would then have remained tête-à-tête with Madame de Rênal. He had had, almost by accident that blind courage which is sufficient for action; but he felt that it was out of his power to speak the simplest word to Madame de Rênal.

"Le premier jour, les examinateurs nommés par le fameux grand vicaire de Frilair, furent très contrariés de devoir toujours porter le premier ou tout au plus le second, sur leur liste, ce Julien Sorel, qui leur était signalé comme le benjamin de l’abbé Pirard. Il y eut des paris au séminaire, que dans la liste de l’examen général, Julien aurait le numéro premier, ce qui emportait l’honneur de dîner chez Mgr l’évêque. Mais à la fin d’une séance, où il avait été question des Pères de l’Église, un examinateur adroit, après avoir interrogé Julien sur saint Jérôme et sa passion pour Cicéron, vint à parler d’Horace, de Virgile et des autres auteurs profanes. A l’insu de ses camarades, Julien avait appris par coeur un grand nombre de passages de ces auteurs. Entraîné par ses succès, il oublia le lieu où il était, et, sur la demande réitérée de l’examinateur, récita et paraphrasa avec feu plusieurs odes d’Horace. Après l’avoir laissé s’enferrer pendant vingt minutes, tout à coup l’examinateur changea de visage, et lui reprocha avec aigreur le temps qu’il avait perdu à ces études profanes, et les idées inutiles ou criminelles qu’il s’était mises dans la tête.","On the first day, the examiners appointed by the famous grand vicar of Frilair, were very upset to always have to put the first or at most the second, on their list, this Julien Sorel, who was announced to them as the youngest of the abbot Piard. There were bets at the seminary that in the list for the general examination, Julien would have the first number, which carried the honor of dining with the Bishop. But at the end of a session, where the question of the Fathers of the Church had been discussed, a skilful examiner, after having questioned Julian about Saint Jerome and his passion for Cicero, came to speak of Horace, Virgil and the others. lay authors. Unbeknownst to his comrades, Julien had memorized a large number of passages from these authors. Carried away by his successes, he forgot the place where he was, and, on the repeated request of the examiner, recited and paraphrased with fire several odes of Horace. After having left him locked away for twenty minutes, the examiner suddenly changed his countenance, and reproached him bitterly for the time he had wasted in these profane studies, and the useless or criminal ideas which he entertained. was put in the head.","After the first day, the examiners named by the famed Vicar-General de Frilair were very annoyed, always having to put first on their list, or at worst second, Julien Sorel; they had been told he was Father Pirard’s favorite. There had been bets made in the seminary that Julien would stand first on the examination list; whoever placed first was rewarded by a dinner with the bishop. But at the end of one session, when he had been examined on the Church Fathers, a clever examiner who’d first questioned him about Saint Jerome and that saint’s passion for Cicero, turned the subject to Horace, Virgil, and other profane writers. Julien’s classmates did not know it, but he had memorized a great many passages from these authors. Carried away by his success, Julien forgot where he was and, when the examiner repeated his question, he passionately recited several of Horace’s odes and then gave an analytical summary of each. The examiner gave him twenty minutes to bury himself in his own trap, then suddenly turned severe and issued a sharp scolding for the time Julien had wasted on these profane studies, and the useless, or sinful, ideas they had put in his head.","On the first day the examiners, nominated by the famous Grand Vicar de Frilair, were very irritated at always having to put first, or at any rate second, on their list, that Julien Sorel, who had been designated to them as the Benjamin of the Abbé Pirard.

But at the end of a sitting, dealing with the fathers of the Church, an adroit examiner, having first interrogated Julien on Saint Jerome and his passion for Cicero, went on to speak about Horace, Virgil and other profane authors. Julien had learnt by heart a great number of passages from these authors without his comrades’ knowledge. Swept away by his successes, he forgot the place where he was, and recited in paraphrase with spirit several odes of Horace at the repeated request of the examiner. Having for twenty minutes given him enough rope to hang himself, the examiner changed his expression, and bitterly reproached him for the time he had wasted on these profane studies, and the useless or criminal ideas which he had got into his head. “I am a fool, sir."

He said to himself: “I have to have one of these two women.” It would be distinctly nicer, he noted, paying court to Madame Derville, not because she would be more enjoyable, but because what she had seen was a tutor honored for his learning—not simply a workman, a carpenter, carrying a ratteen jacket under his arm, as Madame de Rênal had first seen him.","The sudden resolution which he had just made formed an agreeable distraction.

Yet how strongly these seemingly lofty persons, though under his surveillance, must desire their proceedings to remain secret!","As they went away from the mantelpiece they came near the lower end of the table where Julien was placed. His countenance became more and more embarrassed, for whatever efforts he made, he could not avoid hearing, and in spite of all his lack of experience he appreciated all the moment of the things which they were discussing with such complete frankness, and the importance which the high personages whom he apparently had under his observation must attach to their being kept secret."
"Julien fut maussade toute la soirée; jusqu’ici il n’avait été en colère qu’avec le hasard de la société, depuis que Fouqué lui avait offert un moyen ignoble d’arriver à l’aisance, il avait de l’humeur contre lui-même. Tout à ses pensées, quoique de temps en temps il dît quelques mots à ces dames, Julien finit, sans s’en apercevoir, par abandonner la main de Mme de Rênal. Cette réaction bouleversa l’âme de cette pauvre femme; elle y vit la manifestation de son sort.","Julien was sullen all evening; hitherto he had been angry only with the chance of society, since Fouqué had offered him an ignoble means of attaining ease, he had been angry with himself. Absorbed in his thoughts, although from time to time he said a few words to these ladies, Julien ended, without noticing it, by abandoning Madame de Rênal's hand. This reaction upset the soul of this poor woman; she saw in it the manifestation of her fate.","Julien was sullen and moody all night. He had only been angry, before, at fate and at society; now that Fouqué had offered him a vulgar way of achieving comfort, he was out of sorts with himself. Totally wrapped in his own thoughts, though from time to time he addressed a few words to the ladies, Julien ended by letting go of Madame de Rênal’s hand, not even knowing he’d done so. This shook the poor woman’s soul; it seemed to her a demonstration of her fate.","Julien sulked all the evening. Up to the present he had only been angry with the social order, but from that time that Fouqué had offered him an ignoble means of obtaining a competency, he was irritated with himself. Julien was so engrossed in his thoughts, that, although from time to time he said a few words to the ladies, he eventually let go Madame de Rênal ’s hand without noticing it. This action overwhelmed the soul of the poor woman. She saw in it her whole fate."
Mlle Mathilde essaya en vain de dissimuler un éclat de rire; ensuite son indiscrétion demanda des détails. Julien s’en tira avec beaucoup de simplicité; il eut de la grâce sans le savoir.,Mademoiselle Mathilde tried in vain to conceal a burst of laughter; then his indiscretion demanded details. Julien got off with great simplicity; he had grace without knowing it.,"Mademoiselle Mathilde tried, unsuccessfully, to hide her fit of laughter, and then indiscreetly requested a more detailed account. Julien behaved with great straightforwardness; he was gracious without knowing it.","Madame Mathilde made a futile effort to hide a burst of laughter, and subsequently was indiscreet enough to ask for details. Julien acquitted himself with much simplicity. He had grace without knowing it."
"En ce moment, il entendit un cri et fut rappelé aux choses de ce monde. Les femmes autour de lui sanglotaient il vit que toutes les figures étaient tournées vers une petite tribune pratiquée dans le couronnement d’un pilastre gothique. Il sut plus tard que Mathilde s’y était cachée. Comme le cri ne se renouvela pas, tout le monde se remit à regarder Julien, auquel les gendarmes cherchaient à faire traverser la foute.","At that moment he heard a cry and was called back to the things of this world. The women around him were sobbing. He saw that all the figures were turned towards a small platform made in the crowning of a Gothic pilaster. He learned later that Mathilde had hidden there. As the cry was not renewed, everyone went back to looking at Julien, whom the gendarmes were trying to get through the foute.","At that moment, he heard a cry and was recalled to the things of this world. All the women around him were crying: he saw every face turned toward a small gallery, built into the highest part of a Gothic column. He learned, later, that Mathilde had been hidden there.

"Eh bien, oui, mon ami, guillotiné dans trois jours répondit-il à l’interrupteur. M. de Cholin louera une fenêtre, de compte à demi avec l’abbé Maslon. Eh bien, pour le prix de location de cette fenêtre, lequel de ces deux dignes personnages volera l’autre?","Well, yes, my friend, guillotined in three days, he answered the switch. M. de Cholin will rent a window, on a half account with the Abbé Maslon. Well, for the rental price of this window, which of these two worthy characters will steal the other?","Yes, my friend, guillotined in three days,” he replied to whoever or whatever had interrupted him. “Monsieur de Cholin will rent a window, for watching the show; he’ll go halves with Father Maslon. And then, to pay themselves back, which one of these two worthies will rob the other?”","“Well, yes, my friend; guillotined in three days,” he answered the interrupter. “M. de Cholin will hire a window and share the expense with the Abbé Maslon.

And it is in this magnificent position that you want to give envy a fact to comment on?","“You are one of the most distinguished gentlemen in the province,” Madame de Rênal emphatically reaffirmed. “If the king were entirely free, and able to do justice to high breeding, you could imagine yourself, without any doubt whatever, in the House of Lords, etc. And being in so magnificent a position, you propose to give jealousy an occasion for comment?","“You are one of the most distinguished gentlemen in the province,” replied Madame de Rênal emphatically. “If the King were free and could give birth its proper due, you would no doubt figure in the Chamber of Peers, etc. And being in this magnificent position, you yet wish to give the envious a fact to take hold of."
"C’est toute la physionomie du vieil évêque de Besançon, pensa Julien. Cet homme appartenait évidemment à l’Église, il n’annonçait pas plus de cinquante à cinquante-cinq ans, on ne pouvait pas avoir l’air plus paterne.","That's the whole face of the old Bishop of Besançon, thought Julien. This man obviously belonged to the Church, he did not announce more than fifty to fifty-five years, one could not look more paternal.","“He looks a lot like the old Bishop of Besançon,” thought Julien. He was obviously an ecclesiastic, apparently of no more than fifty or fifty-five: no one could have looked more paternal.","“He looks exactly like the old bishop of Besançon,” thought Julien.

"— Prenez garde, mon enfant, à ce qui se passe dans votre coeur, dit le curé fronçant le sourcil; je vous félicite de votre vocation, si c’est à elle seule que vous devez le mépris d’une fortune plus que suffisante. Il y a cinquante-six ans sonnés que je suis curé de Verrières, et cependant, suivant toute apparence, je vais être destitué. Ceci m’afflige, et toutefois j ai huit cents livres de rente. Je vous fais part de ce détail afin que vous ne vous fassiez pas d’illusions sur ce qui vous attend dans l’état de prêtre. Si vous songez à faire la cour aux hommes qui ont la puissance, votre perte éternelle est assurée. Vous pourrez faire fortune, mais il faudra nuire aux misérables, flatter le sous-préfet, le maire, l’homme considéré et servir ses passions: cette conduite, qui dans le monde s’appelle savoir-vivre, peut, pour un laïc, n’être pas absolument incompatible avec le salut, mais, dans notre état, il faut opter il s’agit de faire fortune dans ce monde ou dans l’autre, il n’y a pas de milieu. Allez, mon cher ami, réfléchissez, et revenez dans trois jours me rendre une réponse définitive. J’entrevois avec peine, au fond de votre caractère, une ardeur sombre qui ne m’annonce pas la modération et la parfaite abnégation des avantages terrestres nécessaires à un prêtre; j’augure bien de votre esprit; mais, permettez-moi de vous le dire, ajouta le bon curé, les larmes aux yeux, dans l’état de prêtre, je tremblerai pour votre salut.","""Take care, my child, of what passes in your heart,"" said the cure, frowning; I congratulate you on your vocation, if it is to it alone that you owe the contempt of a fortune more than sufficient. It has been fifty-six years that I have been parish priest of Verrières, and yet, according to all appearances, I am going to be dismissed. This distresses me, and yet I have an income of eight hundred pounds. I am sharing this detail with you so that you have no illusions about what awaits you in the priesthood. If you think of courting men who have power, your eternal doom is certain. You will be able to make a fortune, but you will have to harm the poor, flatter the sub-prefect, the mayor, the respected man and serve his passions: this conduct, which in the world is called good manners, can, for a layman, not be absolutely incompatible with salvation, but, in our state, we must choose it is a question of making a fortune in this world or in the next, there is no middle ground. Come on, my dear friend, reflect, and come back in three days to give me a definitive answer. I see with difficulty, in the depths of your character, a gloomy ardor which does not announce to me the moderation and the perfect abnegation of the terrestrial advantages necessary to a priest; I augur well for your spirit; but, allow me to tell you, added the good priest, with tears in his eyes, in the state of a priest, I will tremble for your salvation.","“Be careful, my son, of what’s happening in your heart,” said the old priest, knitting his brows. “I congratulate you on your religious vocation, if it is that and that alone to which you owe this contempt for a more-than-sufficient fortune. Fifty-six years have tolled since I came to officiate in Verrières, but so far as I can see, I am going to be deprived of my parish. This grieves me, even though I have an income of eight hundred francs a year. I want to share these details with you, so you have no illusions as to what awaits you as a priest. If you dream of paying court to men of power, your eternal damnation is guaranteed. You could make a fortune, but you’d have to tread on the poor, flatter the deputy governor of the district, and the mayor, and all other men of substance, and assist them in their passions. For a layman, such conduct, which the world calls knowing how to live, is not incompatible with salvation. But with the likes of us, a choice has to be made: it’s a question of making your fortune in this world, or in the next. There’s no middle ground. Go now, my dear friend; consider; and come back in three days to tell me what you’ve decided. I have a troubled glimpse, deep down, of a dark ambition which does not speak to me of the temperance, the perfect surrender of worldly advantages, which a priest must have. I see good things in your spirit—but permit me to tell you,” added the good old man, tears in his eyes, “for you as a priest, ah, I tremble for your salvation.”","“Beware, my friend, of what is passing within your heart,” said the curé with a frown, “I congratulate you on your mission, if that is the only reason why you despise a more than ample fortune. It is fifty-six years since I was first curé of Verrières, and yet I shall be turned out, according to all appearances. I am distressed by it, and yet my income amounts to eight hundred francs. I inform you of this detail so that you may not be under any illusions as to what awaits you in your career as a priest. If you think of paying court to the men who enjoy power, your eternal damnation is assured. You may make your fortune, but you will have to do harm to the poor, flatter the sub-prefect, the mayor, the man who enjoys prestige, and pander to his passion; this conduct, which in the world is called knowledge of life, is not absolutely incompatible with salvation so far as a layman is concerned; but in our career we have to make a choice; it is a question of making one’s fortune either in this world or the next; there is no middle course. Come, my dear friend, reflect, and come back in three days with a definite answer. I am pained to detect that there is at the bottom of your character a sombre passion which is far from indicating to me that moderation and that perfect renunciation of earthly advantages so necessary for a priest; I augur well of your intellect, but allow me to tell you,” added the good curé with tears in his eyes, “I tremble for your salvation in your career as a priest.”"

But I’ve been on horseback half a dozen times in my life.”","“Great heavens!

"Julien s’échappa rapidement et monta dans les grands bois par lesquels on peut aller de Vergy à Verrières. Il ne voulait point arriver sitôt chez M. Chélan.

He did not want to arrive at M. Chelan's so soon. Far from wishing to compel himself to a new scene of hypocrisy, he needed to see clearly into his soul, and to give audience to the multitude of feelings which agitated him.","Julien escaped quickly, proceeding up the wide wood through which one went from Vergy to Verrières. He did not want to get to Father Chélan’s house too early.

"Ce n’est point l’amour non plus qui se charge de la fortune des jeunes gens doués de quelque talent comme Julien, ils s’attachent d’une étreinte invincible à une coterie, et quand la coterie fait fortune, toutes les bonnes choses de la société pleuvent sur eux. Malheur à l’homme d’étude qui n’est d’aucune coterie, on lui reprochera jusqu’à de petits succès fort incertains, et la haute vertu triomphera en le volant.

Ce sont de jeunes filles fraîches et jolies qui présentent aux coups de ces marteaux énormes les petits morceaux de fer qui sont rapidement transformés en clous. Ce travail, si rude en apparence, est un de ceux qui étonnent le plus le voyageur qui pénètre pour la première fois dans les montagnes qui séparent la France de l’Helvétie. Si, en entrant à Verrières, le voyageur demande à qui appartient cette belle fabrique de clous qui assourdit les gens qui montent la grande rue, on lui répond avec un accent traînard: Eh! elle est à M. le maire.","No sooner do you enter the city than you are stunned by the din of a noisy and seemingly terrible machine. Twenty heavy hammers, and falling with a noise which makes the pavement tremble, are raised by a wheel which the water of the torrent makes move.

These are fresh and pretty young girls who present to the blows of these enormous hammers the small pieces of iron which are quickly transformed into nails. This work, so hard in appearance, is one of those which most astonish the traveler who enters for the first time the mountains which separate France from Helvetia. If, on entering Verrières, the traveler asks who owns this fine nail factory which deafens people going up the main street, he is answered with a drawling accent: Hey! it belongs to the mayor.","Just inside the town, there is a stunning roar from a machine of frightful appearance.

And it’s pretty, smooth-cheeked young girls who offer pieces of iron to these enormous hammers, which quickly transform them into nails. This operation, visibly harsh and violent, is one of the things that most astonishes a first-time traveler, poking his way into the mountains separating France and Switzerland. And if the traveler, entering Verrières, asks who owns this noble nail-making factory, deafening everyone who walks along the main street, he’ll be told, in the drawling accent of the region, “Ah—it belongs to His Honor the Mayor.”","One has scarcely entered the town, before one is stunned by the din of a strident machine of terrifying aspect.

"Quant à moi, ce n’est pas mal, ajouta-t-il en comprimant sa joie le plus possible. J’ai su conserver la dignité de mon caractère. Je n’ai point dit que j’aimais.

I’ve not said I love her.” He set himself to studying her writing: Mademoiselle de La Mole employed an extremely well-shaped English hand. He felt the need for something physical, to distract him from a joy that was very nearly delirium.","“As for myself, I haven’t done so badly,” he added, restraining his joy as much as he could. “I have managed to preserve my self-respect.

"C’était par un beau jour d’automne que M. de Rênal se promenait sur le Cours de la Fidélité, donnant le bras à sa femme.

"— Il y a pourtant quelque chose là-dessous, répliqua le paysan malin, et il se tut un instant; mais je ne saurai rien de toi, maudit sournois.

"L’adversaire de Julien était un académicien des Inscriptions, qui, par hasard savait le latin, il trouva en Julien un très bon humaniste, n’eut plus la crainte de le faire rougir, et chercha réellement à l’embarrasser. Dans la chaleur du combat, Julien oublia enfin l’ameublement magnifique de la salle à manger il en vint à exposer sur les poètes latins des idées que l’interlocuteur n’avait lues nulle part. En honnête homme il en fit honneur au jeune secrétaire. Par bonheur, on entama une discussion sur la question de savoir si Horace a été pauvre ou riche: un homme aimable, voluptueux et insouciant, faisant des vers pour s’amuser, comme Chapelle, l’ami de Molière et de La Fontaine, ou un pauvre diable de poète lauréat suivant la cour et faisant des odes pour le jour de naissance du roi, comme Southey, l’accusateur de lord Byron. On parla de l’état de la société sous Auguste et sous George, aux deux époques l’aristocratie était toute-puissante; mais à Rome, elle se voyait arracher le pouvoir par Mécène, qui n’était que simple chevalier; et en Angleterre elle avait réduit George à peu près à l’état d’un doge de Venise. Cette discussion sembla tirer le marquis de l’état de torpeur, où l’ennui le plongeait au commencement du dîner.","Julien's adversary was an Academician of the Inscriptions, who, by chance knew Latin, he found in Julien a very good humanist, no longer had the fear of making him blush, and really tried to embarrass him. In the heat of the fight, Julien finally forgot the magnificent furnishings of the dining room; he came to expound ideas on the Latin poets that the interlocutor had not read anywhere. Like an honest man, he did the young secretary credit for it. Fortunately, a discussion began on the question of whether Horace had been poor or rich: an amiable, voluptuous and carefree man, writing verses to amuse himself, like Chapelle, the friend of Molière and La Fontaine, or a poor devil of a poet laureate following the court and making odes for the king's birthday, like Southey, the accuser of Lord Byron. We spoke of the state of society under Augustus and under George, at both times the aristocracy was all-powerful; but in Rome, she saw her power wrested from her by Maecenas, who was only a simple knight; and in England it had reduced George almost to the status of a Doge of Venice. This discussion seemed to rouse the marquis from the state of torpor into which boredom plunged him at the beginning of dinner.","His adversary, a member of the Paleographic Academy, who by chance knew Latin, seeing that Julien was a first-rate humanist, no longer worried about embarrassing him; he began a really serious interrogation. In the heat of combat, Julien was finally able to forget about the dining room’s decorations, and to bring forth ideas about the Roman poets that his questioner had never seen so much as mentioned in print. As an honest man, he was obliged to respect the young secretary. Luckily, they got into a discussion of whether Horace had been poor or rich. Had he been a friendly fellow, voluptuous and carefree, throwing off poems to amuse himself, like Chapelle, friend of Molière and La Fontaine, or was he a poor devil of a poet laureate, connected to court and turning out odes for the ruler’s birthday, like Southey, Byron’s attacker? They spoke of the state of society under Augustus and George IV, in both of which epochs the aristocracy had been all-powerful, though Maecenas, in Rome—not the simple knight he’d seemed—had stripped away that power, while in England the aristocracy had reduced George IV almost to the level of the Doge of Venice. This discussion appeared to draw the marquis out of the torpid state into which, when dinner had started, boredom had plunged him.","Julien’s adversary was a member of the Academy Inscriptions who chanced to know Latin.

"Pour un pauvre diable comme moi, se dit Julien, sans protecteurs et sans argent, il n’y aura pas grande différence entre un séminaire et une prison; il faut que je dépose mes habits bourgeois dans quelque auberge, où je reprendrai mon habit noir.

Would there be arrogant noblemen, today, if your Bonaparte hadn’t created barons and counts? No, that was already out of fashion.

Il fut assez sot pour penser: Elle pourrait me dire je l’ordonne, s’il s’agissait de quelque chose de relatif à l’éducation des enfants, mais en répondant à mon amour, elle suppose l’égalité. On ne peut aimer sans égalité…; et tout son esprit se perdit à faire des lieux communs sur l’égalité. Il se répétait avec colère ce vers de Corneille, que Mme Derville lui avait appris quelques jours auparavant:","Julien saw his awkwardness, he was in a bad mood. He deliberated a long time with himself, to know if he should be angry at this word: I order you. He was foolish enough to think: She could tell me I order it, if it was about the rearing of children, but in responding to my love, she assumes equality. One cannot love without equality…; and all his mind was lost in making platitudes about equality. He repeated angrily to himself this verse of Corneille, which Madame Derville had taught him a few days previously:","He saw how clumsy he had been and was in a surly mood. He considered for some while whether or not he ought to be angry about those words: I command you. He was enough of a fool to think: “She’s entitled to say ‘I order you,’ if it’s something about the children’s education. But in dealing with my love, she’s got to treat me as an equal. How can I love without equality . . . ?” And then his mind got busy, trying to track down commonplaces about equality. He repeated, angrily, a line from Corneille that Madame Derville had taught him a few days earlier:","Julien approached his own clumsiness. He was upset. He deliberated with himself for a long time, in order to ascertain whether or not he ought to be angry at the expression “I order you.” He was silly enough to think she might have said “I order you,” if it were some question concerning the children’s education, but in answering my love she puts me on an equality. It is impossible to love without equality . . . and all his mind ran riot in making common-places on equality. He angrily repeated to himself that verse of Corneille which Madame Derville had taught him some days before."
"A peine le ministre sorti, le général de Bonaparte avait fermé les yeux. En ce moment, il parla de sa santé, de ses blessures, consulta sa montre et s’en alla.","Scarcely had the Minister left than General Bonaparte had closed his eyes.

"Le silence, la solitude profonde, la fraîcheur des longues nefs rendaient plus douce la rêverie de Julien. Il ne craignait point d’être troublé par l’abbé fort occupé dans une autre partie de l’édifice. Son âme avait presque abandonné son enveloppe mortelle, qui se promenait à pas lents dans l’aile du nord confiée à sa surveillance. Il était d’autant plus tranquille, qu’il s’était assuré qu’il n’y avait dans les confessionnaux que quelques femmes pieuses son oeil regardait sans voir.","The silence, the profound solitude, the coolness of the long naves made Julien's reverie more pleasant. He had no fear of being disturbed by the busy Abbot in another part of the building. His soul had almost abandoned its mortal envelope, which was walking slowly in the north wing entrusted to his supervision. He was all the more tranquil because he had made sure that there were only a few pious women in the confessionals, his eye gazing without seeing.","The hushed quiet, the deep solitude, the cool freshness of the long aisles—everything made Julien’s daydreaming sweeter. He was not worried about Father Chas, who would not bother him, busy as he was elsewhere in the building. His soul had very nearly deserted its mortal shell, which was slowly walking down the north aisle, assigned to him for surveillance. He was still more tranquil because he’d made sure that all there was in the confessional booths was a scattering of pious women. His eyes looked but did not see.","The silence, the deep solitude, the freshness of the long naves sweetened Julien’s reverie. He did not fear being troubled by the Abbé Chas, who was engaged in another part of the building.

He was all the more tranquil when he had assured himself that there was no one in the confessional except some devout women. His eyes looked in front of him seeing nothing."
"Le prélat, de plus en plus content de la fin de sa soirée, parla un instant d’histoire ecclésiastique. Il vit que Julien ne comprenait pas. Le prélat passa à l’état moral de l’Empire romain, sous les empereurs du siècle de Constantin. La fin du paganisme était accompagnée de cet état d’inquiétude et de doute qui, au dix-neuvième siècle, désole les esprits tristes et ennuyés. Monseigneur remarqua que Julien ignorait presque jusqu’au nom de Tacite.","The prelate, more and more pleased with the end of his evening, spoke for a moment of ecclesiastical history. He saw that Julien did not understand. The prelate passed to the moral state of the Roman Empire, under the emperors of the century of Constantine. The end of paganism was accompanied by that state of restlessness and doubt which, in the nineteenth century, saddens sad and bored minds. Monseigneur noticed that Julien was almost unaware of the name of Tacitus.","Happier and happier with how his evening was ending, the bishop spoke for a bit about Church history. He saw that Julien did not understand. He went on to the moral condition of the Roman Empire, under the emperors of Constantine’s time. Paganism’s fall had been accompanied by the same uncertainty and doubt that, in the nineteenth century, afflicted sorrowful, weary minds. His Lordship noted that Julien barely knew Tacitus’s name.","The prelate, more and more satisfied with the end of his evening, talked for a moment of ecclesiastical history. He saw that Julien did not understand. The prelate passed on to the moral condition of the Roman Empire under the system of the Emperor Constantine. The end of paganism had been accompanied by that state of anxiety and of doubt which afflicts sad and jaded spirits in the nineteenth century. My Lord noticed Julien’s ignorance of almost the very name of Tacitus."
"— Non, répondit-il enfin, Julien n’est pas prêtre.","— No, he finally answered, Julien is not a priest.","“No,” he said at last. “Julien’s not a priest.”","“No,” he answered at last. “Julien is not a priest.”"

"A Verrières, Julien trouva M. Chélan occupé à déménager; il venait enfin d’être destitué, le vicaire Maslon le remplaçait. Julien aida le bon curé, et il eut l’idée d’écrire à Fouqué que la vocation irrésistible qu’il se sentait pour le saint ministère l’avait empêché d’accepter d’abord ses offres obligeantes, mais qu’il venait de voir un tel exemple d’injustice que peut-être il serait plus avantageux à son salut de ne pas entrer dans les ordres sacrés.","At Verrieres, Julien found M. Chelan busy moving house; he had finally just been deposed, the vicar Maslon replaced him. Julien helped the good priest, and he had the idea of writing to Fouqué that the irresistible vocation he felt for the holy ministry had prevented him from accepting his obliging offers at first, but that he had just to see such an example of injustice that perhaps it would be more advantageous to his salvation not to enter holy orders.","At Verrières, he found Father Chélan in the process of moving. He’d finally been forced out of office, and Father Maslon had replaced him. Julien helped the old priest, and had the notion of writing to Fouqué that the irresistible vocation he’d felt for the sacred ministry kept him, at first, from accepting his friend’s considerate offer, but that he’d just witnessed such an act of injustice that, perhaps, it would be better for his own salvation not to take holy orders.","At Verrières Julien found M. Chélan occupied in moving. He had just been deprived of his living; the curate Maslon was replacing him. Julien helped the good curé, and it occurred to him to write to Fouqué that the irresistible mission which he felt for the holy ministry had previously prevented him from accepting his kind offer, but that he had just seen an instance of injustice, and that perhaps it would be safer not to enter into Holy Orders."
"L’échelle toucha la terre, Julien parvint à la coucher dans la plate-bande de fleurs exotiques le long du mur.","The ladder touched the ground, Julien managed to lay it down in the bed of exotic flowers along the wall.","The ladder touched the ground; Julien managed to lay it down in a bed of exotic flowers, along the wall.",The ladder touched the ground.

"— C’est une institution fort salutaire, mais bien singulière, répondit Mme de Rênal; les femmes n’y sont point admises: tout ce que j’en sais, c’est que tout le monde s’y tutoie. Par exemple, ce domestique va y trouver M. Valenod, et cet homme si fier et si sot ne sera point fâché de s’entendre tutoyer par Saint-Jean, et lui répondra sur le même ton. Si vous tenez à savoir ce qu’on y fait, je demanderai des détails à M. de Maugiron et à M. Valenod. Nous payons vingt francs par domestique afin qu’un jour ils ne nous égorgent pas.","""It is a very salutary institution, but very singular,"" replied Madame de Rênal; women are not admitted there: all I know is that everyone is familiar with each other there. For example, this servant goes there to find M. Valenod, and this man, so proud and so stupid, will not be sorry to hear himself addressed by Saint-Jean, and will answer him in the same tone. If you insist on knowing what is being done there, I will ask M. de Maugiron and M. Valenod for details. We pay twenty francs per servant so that one day they won't cut our throats.","“It’s a completely respectable institution, but very odd,” replied Madame de Rênal. “Women are not allowed in. All I know is that everyone is on familiar terms with everyone else. For example, that servant will meet Monsieur Valenod, and that proud, stupid man won’t be in the least put out to hear himself addressed, intimately, as ‘Saint-Jean,’ and he’ll answer the servant just the same way. If you’re really interested in finding out, I’ll ask Monsieur de Maugiron and Monsieur Valenod for the details. It costs us twenty francs for every one of the servants, to keep them from cutting our throats, some fine day.”","“It’s a very literary institution, but a very curious one,” answered Madame de Rênal. “Women are not admitted to it. All I know is, that everybody uses the second person singular. This servant, for instance, will go and meet M. Valenod there, and the haughty prig will not be a bit offended at hearing himself addressed by Saint-Jean in that familiar way, and will answer him in the same way. If you are keen on knowing what takes place, I will ask M. de Maugiron and M. Valenod for details. We pay twenty francs for each servant, to prevent their cutting our throats one fine day.”"
"Cette idée singulière occupa Julien: se moquerait-il de moi? pensa-t-il. Il alla demander conseil à l’abbé Pirard, qui, moins poli que le marquis, ne lui répondit qu’en sifflant et parlant d’autre chose. Le lendemain matin, Julien se présenta au marquis, en habit noir, avec son portefeuille et ses lettres à signer. Il en fut reçu à l’ancienne manière. Le soir en habit bleu, ce fut un ton tout différent et absolument aussi poli que la veille.","This singular idea occupied Julien: would he make fun of me? he thought. He went to seek advice from the Abbé Pirard, who, less polite than the Marquis, answered him only by whistling and talking about something else. The next morning, Julien presented himself to the marquis, in a black coat, with his portfolio and his letters to sign. He was received in the old way. In the evening in a blue coat, it was an entirely different tone and absolutely as polite as the day before.","The whole strange business was troubling. “Is he making fun of me?” Julien wondered. He sought Father Pirard’s advice; less polite than the marquis, the good priest responded only by whistling and changing the subject. Next morning, Julien wore his black suit when he went to the marquis, carrying a letter case full of letters to be signed. He was received just as, before this new development, he had always been received. That evening, wearing the blue suit, the marquis once again behaved differently, exactly as polite as he’d been the first time Julien wore blue.","Julien was preoccupied by this strange idea. “Perhaps he is making fun of me,” he thought.

He was received in the old way, but when he wore the blue suit that evening, the marquis’s tone was quite different, and absolutely as polite as on the previous day."
"Élisa, la femme de chambre de Mme de Rênal, n’avait pas manqué de devenir amoureuse du jeune précepteur; elle en parlait souvent à sa maîtresse. L’amour de Mlle Élisa avait valu à Julien la haine d’un des valets. Un jour, il entendit cet homme qui disait à Élisa: Vous ne voulez plus me parler, depuis que ce précepteur crasseux est entré dans la maison. Julien ne méritait pas cette injure; mais, par instinct de joli garçon, il redoubla de soin pour sa personne. La haine de M. Valenod redoubla aussi. Il dit publiquement que tant de coquetterie ne convenait pas à un jeune abbé. A la soutane près c’était le costume que portait Julien.","Élisa, Madame de Rênal's maid, had not failed to fall in love with the young tutor; she often spoke of it to her mistress. Mademoiselle Élisa's love had earned Julien the hatred of one of the servants. One day, he heard this man saying to Élisa: You don't want to talk to me any more since that filthy tutor came into the house. Julien did not deserve this insult; but, by the instinct of a pretty boy, he redoubled his care for his person. M. Valenod's hatred also redoubled. He said publicly that such coquetry did not suit a young abbé. Apart from the cassock, it was the costume that Julien wore.","Elisa, Madame de Rênal’s chambermaid, had had no trouble falling in love with the young tutor; she spoke of him, often, to her mistress. Miss Elisa’s love had earned Julien the hatred of one of the menservants. One day, Julien overheard this man saying to Elisa: “You don’t want to talk to me anymore, since this filthy tutor’s come to the house.” Julien did not deserve this insult; nevertheless, with a handsome young fellow’s instincts, he paid even more attention to his appearance. Monsieur Valenod’s dislike grew in equal measure. He said publicly that so much coquetry was unsuitable for a young ecclesiastic. Aside from not wearing a cassock, this was indeed how Julien dressed.","Madame de Rênal’s housemaid, Elisa, had lost no time in falling in love with the young tutor. She often talked about him to her mistress. Elisa’s love had earned for Julien the hatred of one of the men-servants. One day he heard the man saying to Elisa, “You haven’t a word for me now that this dirty tutor has entered the household.” The insult was undeserved, but Julien with the instinctive vanity of a pretty boy redoubled his care of his personal appearance. M. Valenod’s hate also increased. He said publicly, that it was not becoming for a young Abbé to be such a fop. Madame de Rênal observed that Julien talked more frequently than usual to Mademoiselle Elisa."

"Les baisers remplis de passion, et tels que jamais elle n’en avait reçu de pareils lui firent tout à coup oublier que peut-être il aimait une autre femme. Bientôt il ne fut plus coupable à ses yeux.

Julien né pensait plus à sa noire ambition, ni à ses projets si difficiles à exécuter. Pour la première fois de sa vie, il était entraîné par le pouvoir de la beauté. Perdu dans une rêverie vague et douce, si étrangère à son caractère, pressant doucement cette main qui lui plaisait comme parfaitement jolie il écoutait à demi le mouvement des feuilles du tilleul; agitées par ce léger vent de la nuit, et les chiens du moulin du Doubs qui aboyaient dans le lointain.","The kisses filled with passion, and such as she had never received the like, suddenly made him forget that perhaps he loved another woman.

"Dans ce moment, le marquis de Croisenois s’avançait avec empressement vers Mlle de La Mole. Il fut un instant à trois pas d’elle, sans pouvoir pénétrer à cause de la foule.

"Julien se rassurait pendant ce long discours, il examinait Mme de Rênal. Tel est l’effet de la grâce parfaite quand elle est naturelle au caractère, et que surtout là personne qu’elle décore ne songe pas à avoir de la grâce; Julien, qui se connaissait fort bien en beauté féminine eût juré dans cet instant qu’elle n’avait que vingt ans. Il eut sur-le-champ l’idée hardie de lui baiser la main. Bientôt il eut peur de son idée, un instant après, il se dit: Il y aurait de la lâcheté à moi de ne pas exécuter une action qui peut m’être utile, et diminuer le mépris que cette belle dame a probablement pour un pauvre ouvrier à peine arraché à la scie. Peut-être Julien fut-il un peu encouragé par ce mot de joli garçon, que depuis six mois il entendait répéter le dimanche par quelques jeunes filles. Pendant ces débats intérieurs, Mme de Rênal lui adressait deux ou trois mots d’instruction sur la façon de débuter avec les enfants. La violence que se faisait Julien le rendit de nouveau fort pâle; il dit, d’un air contraint:","Julien reassured himself during this long speech, he examined Madame de Rênal. Such is the effect of perfect grace when it is natural to the character, and especially when the person whom it decorates does not dream of having grace; Julien, who knew very well about feminine beauty, would have sworn at that moment that she was only twenty years old. He immediately had the bold idea of kissing her hand. Soon he was afraid of his idea, a moment later he said to himself: It would be cowardly of me not to perform an action which can be useful to me, and to diminish the contempt that this beautiful lady probably has for a poor worker just torn from the saw. Perhaps Julien was a little encouraged by this word pretty boy, which for six months he had heard repeated on Sundays by some young girls. During these internal debates, Madame de Rênal addressed to him two or three words of instruction on how to begin with children. Julien's violence made him look very pale again; he said, with a constrained air:","Julien was studying Madame de Rênal as he delivered this long speech, and he felt a good deal more comfortable. This is always the effect of perfect graciousness when it springs from natural roots, and above all when the person displaying it never dreams of doing so. Julien, who was an excellent judge of female beauty, would at that moment have sworn that she could not be more than twenty. He suddenly, then and there, had the rash notion of kissing her hand. He was immediately afraid of his own idea. A moment later he said to himself: “It would be sheer cowardice not to do something that might prove distinctly useful to me—and would lessen the disdain this beautiful lady probably feels for a poor workman only just now freed from his saw.” Perhaps Julien was encouraged by the words handsome boy, which for six months he’d been hearing, every Sunday, from young girls. As he was silently debating with himself, Madame de Rênal made a few instructive comments on how to begin his work with the children. The violence of his inner struggle once again turned him exceedingly pale. Speaking stiffly, he said:","Julien had regained his confidence during this long speech. He was examining Madame de Rênal. Perfect grace works wonders when it is natural to the character, and above all, when the person whom it adorns never thinks of trying to affect it. Julien, who was quite a connoisseur in feminine beauty, would have sworn at this particular moment that she was not more than twenty. The rash idea of kissing her hand immediately occurred to him. He soon became frightened of his idea. A minute later he said to himself, it will be an act of cowardice if I do not carry out an action which may be useful to me, and lessen the contempt which this fine lady probably has for a poor workman just taken away from the saw-mill. Possibly Julien was a little encouraged through having heard some young girls repeat on Sundays during the last six months the words “pretty boy.” During this internal debate, Madame de Rênal was giving him two or three hints on the way to commence handling the children. The strain Julien was putting on himself made him once more very pale. He said with an air of constraint."

"Heureusement pour lui, même dans ce petit incident subalterne, l’intérieur de son âme répondait mal à son langage cavalier. Il avait peur de Mme de Rênal à cause de sa robe si jolie.

"Dans cette position, M. Valenod prévoyait une scène décisive avec son ancien confédéré M. de Rênal. Celui-ci lui adresserait des paroles dures, ce qui lui était assez égal; mais il pouvait écrire à Besançon et même à Paris. Un cousin de quelque ministre pouvait tomber tout à coup à Verrières, et prendre le dépôt de mendicité. M. Valenod pensa à se rapprocher des libéraux: c’est pour cela que plusieurs étaient invités au dîner où Julien récita. Il aurait été puissamment soutenu contre le maire. Mais des élections pouvaient survenir, et il était trop évident que le dépôt et un mauvais vote étaient incompatibles. Le récit de cette politique fort bien devinée par Mme de Rênal, avait été fait à Julien, pendant qu’il lui donnait le bras pour aller d’une boutique à l’autre, et peu à peu les avait entraînés au COURS DE LA FIDÉLITÉ, où ils passèrent plusieurs heures, presque aussi tranquilles qu’à Vergy.","In this position, M. Valenod foresaw a decisive scene with his former confederate M. de Rênal. The latter would address harsh words to him, which he did not mind; but he could write to Besançon and even to Paris.

Valenod thought of getting closer to the Liberals: that is why several were invited to the dinner where Julien recited. He would have been strongly supported against the mayor. But elections could come up, and it was all too obvious that tabling and a bad vote were incompatible. The story of this policy, very well guessed by Madame de Rênal, had been told to Julien, while he was giving her his arm to go from one shop to another, and had gradually drawn them into the COURSE OF LOYALTY. , where they spent several hours, almost as quiet as at Vergy.","At this juncture, Monsieur Valenod expected a decisive scene with his old associate, Monsieur de Rênal. The latter had spoken harsh words to him, which did not bother Monsieur Valenod a bit, but de Rênal had the power of direct communication with Besançon, and even with Paris. Some royal minister’s relative might suddenly drop down on Verrières and take over the Pauper’s Bureau. Monsieur Valenod wondered about approaching the liberals, which is why several of them had been invited to the occasion at which Julien recited. He would have powerful support against the mayor. But elections might intervene, and it was all too obvious that directing a bureau and giving votes to the opposition were incompatible. An account of these developments, very accurately puzzled out by Madame de Rênal, was passed along to Julien, as he lent her his arm and she went from shop to shop, until step by step they were brought to Loyalty Walkway, where they spent several hours almost as tranquilly as at Vergy.","Such being his position M. Valenod imagined in advance a decisive scene with his old colleague M. de Rênal. The latter might address to him some harsh words, which he would not mind much; but he might write to Besançon and even to Paris. Some minister’s cousin might suddenly fall down on Verrières and take over the workhouse. Valenod thought of coming to terms with the Liberals. It was for that purpose that several of them had been invited to the dinner when Julien was present. He would have obtained powerful support against the mayor but the elections might supervene, and it was only too evident that the directorship of the workhouse was inconsistent with voting on the wrong side. Madame de Rênal had made a shrewd guess at this intrigue, and while she explained it to Julien as he gave her his arm to pass from one shop to another, they found themselves gradually taken as far as the Cours de la Fidelite where they spent several hours nearly as tranquil as those at Vergy."

"Je ne trouve quant à moi qu’une chose à reprendre au COURS DE LA FIDÉLITÉ; on lit ce nom officiel en quinze ou vingt endroits, sur des plaques de marbre qui ont valu une croix de plus à M. de Rênal, ce que je reprocherais au Cours de la Fidélité, c’est la manière barbare dont l’autorité fait tailler et tondre jusqu’au vif ces vigoureux platanes. Au lieu de ressembler par leurs têtes basses rondes et aplaties, à la plus vulgaire des plantes potagères, ils ne demanderaient pas mieux que d’avoir ces formes magnifiques qu’on leur voit en Angleterre. Mais la volonté de M. le maire est despotique, et deux fois par an tous les arbres appartenant à la commune sont impitoyablement amputés. Les libéraux de l’endroit prétendent, mais ils exagèrent, que la main du jardinier officiel est devenue bien plus sévère depuis que M. le vicaire Maslon a pris l’habitude de s’emparer des produits de la tonte.","I can only find one thing to take back from the COURSE OF LOYALTY; we read this official name in fifteen or twenty places, on marble slabs which earned M. de Rênal another cross, what I would reproach the Cours de la Fidélité with is the barbaric way in which authority prune and mow these vigorous plane trees. Instead of resembling, by their low, round and flattened heads, the most vulgar of vegetable plants, they would like nothing better than to have those magnificent forms which one sees of them in England. But the will of the mayor is despotic, and twice a year all the trees belonging to the commune are pitilessly amputated. The liberals of the place claim, but they exaggerate, that the hand of the official gardener has become much more severe since Mr. the vicar Maslon has taken the habit of seizing the products of the mowing.","For myself, I find only one thing to object to, about LOYALTY WALKWAY. One can read this formal title in fifteen or twenty places, on marble plaques that earned Monsieur de Rênal an extra star on his official medal. But what I disapprove of about Loyalty Walkway is the barbarous way the authorities cut and clip those vigorous plane trees, down to the very quick. Instead of looking as if their heads were bowed low, plump and round and debased like the most vulgar of garden vegetables, they ask only to be granted the magnificent shapes one sees them assume in England. His Honor the Mayor is a despot, and twice a year all trees belonging to the town are shorn without pity. Those of liberal belief pretend (though they exaggerate) that the town gardener’s hand has become even more severe since Father Maslon decided to impound for church use the profits from this shearing.","I find personally only one thing at which to cavil in the COURS DE LA FIDELITE, (this official name is to be read in fifteen to twenty places on those immortal tiles which earned M. de Rênal an extra cross). The grievance I find in the Cours de la Fidelité is the barbarous manner in which the authorities have cut these vigorous plane trees and clipped them to the quick. In fact they really resemble with their dwarfed, rounded and flattened heads the most vulgar plants of the vegetable garden, while they are really capable of attaining the magnificent development of the English plane trees. But the wish of M. the mayor is despotic, and all the trees belonging to the municipality are ruthlessly pruned twice a year. The local Liberals suggest, but they are probably exaggerating, that the hand of the official gardener has become much more severe, since M. the Vicar Maslon started appropriating the clippings."

"— Voilà trente francs que l’imprudence de Grogeot vaut à la commune, disait l’un.","""Here are thirty francs that Grogeot's imprudence is worth to the commune,"" said one.","“There’s thirty francs that Grogeot’s arrogance is costing the city,” someone said.","“Here’s thirty francs that Grogeot’s recklessness is landing the municipality in for,” said one—“But,” answered another, “M. de Saint Giraud will revenge himself on Grogeot.”"

"L’abbé suivit Julien et l’enferma à clef. Celui-ci se mit aussitôt à visiter sa malle, au fond de laquelle la fatale carte était précieusement cachée. Rien ne manquait dans la malle, mais il y avait plusieurs dérangements; cependant la clef ne le quittait jamais. Quel bonheur, se dit Julien, que, pendant le temps de mon aveuglement, je n’aie jamais accepté la permission de sortir, que M. Castanède m’offrait si souvent avec une bonté que je comprends main tenant. Peut-être j’aurais eu la faiblesse de changer d’habits et d’aller voir la belle Amanda, je me serais perdu. Quand on a désespéré de tirer parti du renseignement de cette manière, pour ne pas le perdre on en a fait une dénonciation.","The abbé followed Julien and locked him in. The latter immediately began to inspect his trunk, at the bottom of which the fatal card was carefully hidden. Nothing was missing from the trunk, but there were several disturbances; however, the key never left him. What luck, thought Julien, that during the time of my blindness I never accepted the permission to go out, which M. Castanède so often offered me with a kindness that I now understand. Perhaps I would have had the weakness to change my clothes and go see the beautiful Amanda, I would have lost myself. When we despaired of taking advantage of intelligence in this way, in order not to lose it, we made a denunciation of it.","The director followed him in and locked the door. Then he set himself to inspecting Julien ’s trunk, at the bottom of which the fatal playing card had been carefully hidden. There was nothing missing from the trunk, but things had gotten disarranged—and yet he had always kept the key with him. “What good luck,” Julien told himself, “that during those days of my blindness, I never made use of permission to go out of the seminary, so often offered by Father Castaneda, and with a goodwill that, now, I quite understand. If I’d been weak enough to change my clothes and go see pretty Amanda, I’d have been lost. When they gave up on using their information that way, and not wanting to just throw it away, they denounced me.”","The Abbé followed Julien and locked him in. The latter immediately began to examine his trunk, at the bottom of which the fatal cards had been so carefully hidden. Nothing was missing in the trunk, but several things had been disarranged. Nevertheless, he had never been without the key. What luck that, during the whole time of my blindness, said Julien to himself, I never availed myself of the permission to go out that Monsieur Castanède would offer me so frequently, with a kindness which I now understand. Perhaps I should have had the weakness to have changed my clothes and gone to see the fair Amanda, and then I should have been ruined. When they gave up hope of exploiting that piece of information for the accomplishment of his ruin, they had used it to inform against him."
"Que de passion il y avait dans les yeux de cette pauvre Mme de Rênal, se dit Julien, quand, même après six mois de relations intimes, elle osait recevoir une lettre de moi! De sa vie, je crois, elle ne m’a regardé avec des yeux riants.","What passion there was in the eyes of that poor Madame de Rênal, thought Julien, when, even after six months of intimate relations, she dared to receive a letter from me! In her life, I believe, she never looked at me with laughing eyes.","“What passion there was in poor Madame de Rênal’s eyes,” Julien said to himself, “if, even after six months of our relationship, she dared accept a letter from me! Never in her life, I think, did she ever look at me with laughing eyes.”","“What passion there was in the eyes of that poor Madame de Rênal,” said Julien to himself, “when she ventured to receive a letter from me, even after six months of intimate relationship?

Que de cardinaux nés plus bas que moi et qui ont gouverné! mon compatriote Granvelle, par exemple.","Well! he said to himself, laughing like Mephistopheles, I have more wit than them; I know how to choose the uniform of my century. And he felt his ambition and his attachment to the ecclesiastical habit redouble. How many cardinals born lower than me and who have governed! my compatriot Granvelle, for example.","“Oh yes!” he told himself, laughing like Mephistopheles, “but I’m smarter than they are; I’ve chosen this century’s uniform.” He felt a surge, both in his ambition, and in his affection for ecclesiastical garb. “How many cardinals were born even lower than me, and have risen to authority! My countryman, Granvelle, for example.”","“Well,” he said to himself with a Mephistopheleian smile, “I have more brains than they. I am shrewd enough to choose the uniform of my century. And he felt a quickening of his ambition and of his attachment to his ecclesiastical dress. What cardinals of even lower birth than mine have not succeeded in governing!

"Julien fut étonné et encore plus fâché qu’elle lui fit un mystère de ce qui l’agitait. Je l’avais prévu, se disait-il avec amertume, son amour s’éclipse devant le bonheur de recevoir un roi dans sa maison. Tout ce tapage l’éblouit. Elle m’aimera de nouveau quand les idées de sa caste ne lui troubleront plus la cervelle.","Julien was astonished and even more angry that she made a mystery to him of what was agitating him. I had foreseen it, he thought bitterly, his love eclipsed by the happiness of having a king in his house. All this noise dazzled him. She will love me again when the ideas of her caste no longer trouble her brain.","Julien was astonished but, even more, angered that she was making a mystery of whatever might be troubling her. “I thought as much,” he told himself, bitterly. “The joy of receiving royalty in her house drives love from her mind. All this fussing simply dazzles her. She’ll love me again, when these class-inspired notions stop bothering her brain.”","Julien was astonished, and what was more, angry that she should make a mystery of what was disturbing her, “I had anticipated it,” he said bitterly to himself. “Her love is being overshadowed by the happiness of receiving a King in her house. All this hubbub overcomes her. She will love me once more when the ideas of her caste no longer trouble her brain.”"

En ce cas, mon opinion serait mon tyran.","""I'm independent, me,"" he said to a gentleman who was wearing too many plates, and who apparently he was making fun of. Why do they want me to be of the same opinion today as six weeks ago? In that case, my opinion would be my tyrant.","“I’m a freethinker, I really am,” he was saying to a man wearing three decorations; he appeared to be mocking his listener. “Why should anyone expect me, today, to hold the same opinions I had six weeks ago? If I did, my opinions would be tyrannical.”","“I am independent, I am,” he was saying to a gentleman with three stars, of whom apparently he was making fun. “Why insist on my having to-day the same opinion I had six weeks ago?

"Le hasard voulut que, ce soir-là, M. l’abbé de Frilair fût de service dans le salon de l’évêché; Monseigneur dînait à la préfecture.

"M. Valenod était ce qu’on appelle, à cent lieues de Paris, un faraud; c’est une espèce d’un naturel effronté et grossier. Son existence triomphante, depuis 1815, avait renforcé ses belles dispositions. Il régnait, pour ainsi dire, à Verrières, sous les ordres de M. de Rênal, mais beaucoup plus actif, ne rougissant de rien, se mêlant de tout, sans cesse allant, écrivant, parlant, oubliant les humiliations, n’ayant aucune prétention personnelle il avait fini par balancer le crédit de son maire, aux yeux du pouvoir ecclésiastique. M. Valenod avait dit en quelque sorte aux épiciers du pays: Donnez-moi les deux plus sots d’entre vous; aux gens de loi: indiquez-moi les deux plus ignares; aux officiers de santé: désignez-moi les deux plus charlatans. Quand il avait eu rassemblé les plus effrontés de chaque métier, il leur avait dit: régnons ensemble.","M. Valenod was what is called, a hundred leagues from Paris, a faraud; he is a species of a cheeky and coarse nature. Her triumphant existence since 1815 had strengthened her fine dispositions. He reigned, so to speak, at Verrières, under the orders of M. de Rênal, but much more active, blushing at nothing, meddling in everything, constantly going, writing, speaking, forgetting the humiliations, having no personal claim he had ended up swinging the credit of his mayor, in the eyes of the ecclesiastical power. M. Valenod had said, in a way, to the local grocers: Give me the two most stupid of you; to the people of law: tell me the two most ignorant; to the health officers: point out to me the two most charlatans. When he had assembled the most brazen of each profession, he had said to them: let us reign together.","Monsieur Valenod was what’s called, three hundred miles from Paris, a slick operator, a man of natural, coarse brazenness. His triumphant career, since 1815, had reinforced these handsome characteristics. He ruled, in other words, subject to Monsieur de Rênal’s orders, but being so much more active, never squeamish about anything, able to mix with the populace, always on the go, writing, speaking, brushing off humiliation, totally devoid of personal pretentions, he had come, in the eyes of the ecclesiastical power, to quite balance out his mayor. Monsieur Valenod had more or less said to the province’s grocers: “ Let me have the two most stupid among you.” He’d said to the purveyors of justice: “Show me your two most notable ignoramuses.” To the supervisors of health: “Tell me who are your two most crooked.” And when he had gathered together the most brazen, in every business and profession, he’d said to them: “Let’s rule together.”","M. le Valenod was what is called a hundred miles from Paris a faraud; that means a coarse imprudent type of man. His triumphant existence since 1815 had consolidated his natural qualities. He reigned, so to say, in Verrières subject to the orders of M. de Rênal; but as he was much more energetic, was ashamed of nothing, had a finger in everything, and was always going about writing and speaking, and was oblivious of all snubs, he had, although without any personal pretensions, eventually come to equal the mayor in reputation in the eyes of the ecclesiastical authorities. M. Valenod had, as it were, said to the local tradesmen “Give me the two biggest fools among your number;” to the men of law “Show me the two greatest dunces;” to the sanitary officials “Point out to me the two biggest charlatans.” When he had thus collected the most impudent members of each separate calling, he had practically said to them, “Let us reign together.”"

"L’oeil de Julien suivait le prétendu beau-frère; il le vit acheter un numéro à la poule que l’on jouait au plus éloigné des deux billards.

And still, she treats me exactly as if I had never written a word! Where will all of this end? Is my persistence as boring to her as it is to me?

"— On ne fait papes que des Italiens, répondit l’ami; mais pour sûr on tirera au sort parmi nous, pour des places de grands vicaires, de chanoines, et peut-être d’évêques. M. P…, évêque de Châlons, est fils d’un tonnelier: c’est l’état de mon père.","“Only Italians are made popes,” replied the friend; but for sure we will draw lots among us, for the places of grand vicars, canons, and perhaps bishops. M. P…, bishop of Châlons, is the son of a cooper: this is my father’s profession.","“Only Italians get to be pope,” said his friend. “But I’m sure they’ll pick some of us, the lucky ones, for posts as vicar-generals, canons, and maybe bishops. . . .

"Enfin, ces messieurs arrivèrent à la plus laide des pièces de ce superbe appartement: à peine s’il y faisait jour; là, se trouva un petit homme maigre, à l’oeil vif et en perruque blonde. L’abbé se retourna vers Julien et le présenta. C’était le marquis. Julien eut beaucoup de peine à le reconnaître, tant il lui trouva l’air poli. Ce n’était plus le grand seigneur à mine si altière de l’abbaye de Bray-le-Haut. Il sembla à Julien que sa perruque avait beaucoup trop de cheveux. A l’aide de cette sensation il ne fut point du tout intimidé. Le descendant de l’ami de Henri III lui parut d’abord avoir une tournure assez mesquine. Il était fort maigre et s’agitait beaucoup. Mais il remarqua bientôt que le marquis avait une politesse encore plus agréable à l’interlocuteur que celle de l’évêque de Besançon lui-même. L’audience ne dura pas trois minutes. En sortant, l’abbé dit à Julien:","Finally, these gentlemen arrived at the ugliest of rooms in this superb apartment: hardly any daylight there; there stood a thin, quick-eyed man in a blond wig. The abbé turned to Julien and introduced him. It was the Marquis. Julien had great difficulty in recognizing him, he thought he looked so polite. He was no longer the haughty-looking great lord of the abbey of Bray-le-Haut. It seemed to Julien that his wig had far too much hair. With the help of this sensation he was not intimidated at all. The descendant of the friend of Henri III seemed to him at first to have a rather mean appearance. He was very thin and moved around a lot. But he soon noticed that the Marquis had a politeness even more agreeable to the interlocutor than that of the Bishop of Besançon himself. The hearing did not last three minutes. On leaving, the abbot said to Julien:","The gentlemen finally came to the ugliest of all the rooms in this magnificent place: daylight scarcely reached it. And there they found a small, lean man, with sparkling eyes and a blond wig. Father Pirard turned to Julien and presented him. It was the marquis. He was so courteous that Julien was hard put to recognize him. He was no longer the high and mighty lord of Upper Bray, who carried himself so haughtily. Julien thought there was too much hair in his wig, and this impression helped him lose his shyness. At first, this descendant of Henry III’s friend seemed to him distinctly shabby. He was really very lean and rather excitable. But he soon noticed that the marquis spoke to people so politely that, indeed, it was pleasanter than even the Bishop of Besançon himself. The interview took no more than three minutes. As they left, Father Pirard said to Julien:","Finally our gentlemen arrived at the ugliest rooms in this superb suite. There was scarcely any light. They found there a little keen man with a lively eye and a blonde wig. The Abbé turned round to Julien and presented him. It was the marquis. Julien had much difficulty in recognising him, he found his manner was so polite. It was no longer the grand seigneur with that haughty manner of the abbey of Bray-le-Haut. Julien thought that his wig had far too many hairs. As the result of this opinion he was not at all intimidated. The descendant of the friend of Henry III. seemed to him at first of a rather insignificant appearance. He was extremely thin and very restless, but he soon noticed that the marquis had a politeness which was even more pleasant to his listener than that of the Bishop of Besançon himself.

"Ma présomption s’est si souvent applaudie de ce que j’étais différent des autres jeunes paysans! Eh bien, j’ai assez vécu pour voir que différence engendre haine, se disait-il un matin. Cette grande vérité venait de lui être montrée par une de ses plus piquantes irréussites. Il avait travaillé huit jours à plaire à un élève qui vivait en odeur de sainteté. Il se promenait avec lui dans la cour, écoutant avec soumission des sottises à dormir debout. Tout à coup le temps tourna à l’orage, le tonnerre gronda, et le saint élève s’écria, le repoussant d’une façon grossière:","My presumption was so often applauded because I was different from other young peasants! Well, I have lived long enough to see that difference breeds hatred, he said to himself one morning. This great truth had just been shown to him by one of his most piquant failures. He had worked eight days to please a pupil who lived in the odor of holiness. He walked with him in the yard, submissively listening to nonsense to sleep standing up. Suddenly the weather turned stormy, thunder rumbled, and the holy pupil cried out, pushing him away in a rude way:","“I’ve congratulated myself, often, for thinking I was different from the other young peasants! Well, I’ve lived long enough to see that difference creates hatred,” he told himself one morning. This great truth had just been demonstrated by one of his most stinging failures. He had labored for a week, making himself pleasant to one of the seminarians who lived as if already canonized. He walked with him in the courtyard, humbly listening to stupid prattle until he couldn’t keep his eyes open. Suddenly the weather turned stormy, thunder rumbled, and the saintly one called out, pushing Julien away in the rudest fashion:","“I have so often presumed to congratulate myself on being different from the other young peasants! Well, I have lived enough to realise that difference engenders hate,” he said to himself one morning. This great truth had just been borne in upon him by one of his most irritating failures.

He used to go out with him into the courtyard and listen submissively to pieces of fatuity enough to send one to sleep standing. Suddenly the weather turned stormy. The thunder growled, and the holy pupil exclaimed as he roughly pushed him away."

"— Voici la fin de tout, s’écria Mme de Rênal, en se jetant dans les bras de Julien.

"Julien, de son côté, avait vécu en véritable enfant depuis son se jour à la campagne, aussi heureux de courir à la suite des papillons que ses élèves. Après tant de contrainte et de politique habile, seul, loin des regards des hommes, et, par instinct, ne craignant point Mme de Rênal, il se livrait au plaisir d’exister, si vif à cet âge, et au milieu des plus belles montagnes du monde.","Julien, for his part, had lived like a real child since his day in the country, as happy to run after the butterflies as his pupils.

After so long a period of constraint and wary diplomacy, he was at last alone and far from human observation; he was instinctively free from any apprehension on the score of Madame de Rênal, and abandoned himself to the sheer pleasure of being alive, which is so keen at so young an age, especially among the most beautiful mountains in the world."

"Julien se tourna vivement, et frappé du regard si rempli de grâce de Mme de Rênal, il oublia une partie de sa timidité. Bientôt, étonné de sa beauté, il oublia tout, même ce qu’il venait faire. Mme de Rênal avait répété sa question.","Julien turned quickly, and struck by Madame de Rênal's gaze so full of grace, he forgot part of his shyness.

"D’après je ne sais quelle idée prise dans quelque récit de la bonne société, telle que l’avait vue le vieux chirurgien-major, dès qu’on se taisait dans un lieu où il se trouvait avec une femme, Julien se sentait humilié comme si ce silence eût été son tort particulier. Cette sensation était cent fois plus pénible dans le tête-à-tête. Son imagination remplie des notions les plus exagérées, les plus espagnoles, sur ce qu’un homme doit dire quand il est seul avec une femme, ne lui offrait dans son trouble que des idées inadmissibles. Son âme était dans les nues, et cependant il ne pouvait sortir du silence le plus humiliant. Ainsi son air sévère, pendant ses longues promenades avec Mme de Rênal et les enfants, était augmenté par les souffrances les plus cruelles. Il se méprisait horriblement. Si par malheur il se forçait à parler, il lui arrivait de dire les choses les plus ridicules. Pour comble de misère, il voyait et s’exagérait son absurdité, mais ce qu’il ne voyait pas, c’était l’expression de ses yeux; ils étaient si beaux et annonçaient une âme si ardente, que, semblables aux bons acteurs, ils donnaient quelquefois un sens charmant à ce qui n’en avait pas. Mme de Rênal remarqua que, seul avec elle, il n’arrivait jamais à dire quelque chose de bien que lorsque, distrait par quelque événement imprévu, il ne songeait pas à bien tourner un compliment. Comme les amis de la maison ne la gâtaient pas en lui présentant des idées nouvelles et brillantes, elle jouissait avec délices des éclairs d’esprit de Julien.","According to I don't know what idea taken from some account of good society, as the old surgeon-major had seen it, as soon as people were silent in a place where he was with a woman, Julien felt humiliated. as if this silence had been his particular fault. This sensation was a hundred times more painful in the tete-a-tete. His imagination, filled with the most exaggerated, the most Spanish notions of what a man should say when he is alone with a woman, offered him in his confusion only inadmissible ideas. His soul was in the clouds, and yet he could not emerge from the most humiliating silence. Thus his severe air, during his long walks with Madame de Rênal and the children, was increased by the most cruel sufferings. He despised himself horribly. If by misfortune he forced himself to speak, he happened to say the most ridiculous things. To crown his misery, he saw and exaggerated his absurdity, but what he did not see was the expression of his eyes; they were so beautiful and announced such an ardent soul that, like good actors, they sometimes gave a charming meaning to what had none. Madame de Rênal noticed that, alone with her, he never managed to say anything good except when, distracted by some unforeseen event, he did not think of turning a compliment well. As the friends of the house did not spoil her by presenting her with new and brilliant ideas, she enjoyed Julien's flashes of wit with delight.","Based on some idea or other, formed by a tale of high society narrated by the old surgeon-major, as soon as Julien was anywhere with a woman, and no one was speaking, he felt himself humiliated, exactly as if the silence was his fault. This feeling was a hundred times more painful when they were alone. His imagination sprouted the wildest Spanish-style notions as to what a man ought to say, finding himself alone with a woman: all the ideas presented him by his troubled mind were utterly impossible. No matter that his soul soared in the clouds, he was unable to break the humiliating silence. And so his severe bearing, on the long walks he took with Madame de Rênal and her children, was intensified by the cruelest kind of inner suffering. He found himself disgusting. If some ill luck forced him to speak, he managed to say the most ridiculous things. Worse yet, he saw how absurdly he was behaving, and then exaggerated it still further, but what he did not see was the expression in her eyes, so lovely and revealing so ardent a heart that, just as a good actor does, it gave meaning to words that had no meaning. She noticed how, alone with her, he never said anything worth saying except when, distracted by something unforeseen, he wasn’t trying to turn a well-phrased compliment. Since the friends of the house did not spoil her with new and brilliant ideas, she found Julien’s flashes of insight thoroughly delightful.","Owing to some mysterious idea, derived from some tale of good society, such as the old Surgeon-Major had seen it, Julien felt humiliated whenever the conversation languished on any occasion when he found himself in a woman’s society, as though the particular pause were his own special fault. This sensation was a hundred times more painful in tete-a-tete. His imagination, full as it was of the most extravagant and most Spanish ideas of what a man ought to say when he is alone with a woman, only suggested to the troubled youth things which were absolutely impossible. His soul was in the clouds. Nevertheless he was unable to emerge from this most humiliating silence. Consequently, during his long walks with Madame de Rênal and the children, the severity of his manner was accentuated by the poignancy of his sufferings. He despised himself terribly. If, by any luck, he made himself speak, he came out with the most absurd things. To put the finishing touch on his misery, he saw his own absurdity and exaggerated its extent, but what he did not see was the expression in his eyes, which were so beautiful and betokened so ardent a soul, that like good actors, they sometimes gave charm to something which is really devoid of it. Madame de Rênal noticed that when he was alone with her he never chanced to say a good thing except when he was taken out of himself by some unexpected event, and consequently forgot to try and turn a compliment. As the friends of the house did not spoil her by regaling her with new and brilliant ideas, she enjoyed with delight all the flashes of Julien’s intellect."

"Quelle honte pour moi si je suis éconduit! ce sera un remords à empoisonner toute ma vie se disait-il, jamais elle ne m’écrira. Dieu sait quand je reviendrai en ce pays! De ce moment tout ce qu’il y avait de céleste dans la position de Julien disparut rapidement de son coeur. Assis à côté d’une femme qu’il adorait, la serrant presque dans ses bras, dans cette chambre où il avait été si heureux, au milieu d’une obscurité profonde, distinguant fort bien que depuis un moment elle pleurait sentant, au mouvement de sa poitrine, qu’elle avait des sanglots, il eut le malheur de devenir un froid politique presque aussi calculant et aussi froid que lorsque, dans la cour du séminaire, il se voyait en butte à quelque mauvaise plaisanterie de la part d’un de ses camarades plus fort que lui. Julien faisait durer son récit, et parlait de la vie malheureuse qu’il avait menée depuis son départ de Verrières. Ainsi, se disait Mme de Rênal, après un an d’absence, privé presque entièrement de marques de souvenir, tandis que moi je l’oubliais il n’était occupé que des jours heureux qu’il avait trouvés à Vergy. Ses sanglots redoublaient. Julien vit le succès de son récit. Il comprit qu’il fallait tenter la dernière ressource: il arriva brusquement à la lettre qu’il venait de recevoir de Paris.","What a shame for me if I am turned away! it will be remorse to poison my whole life, he said to himself, she will never write to me. God knows when I will return to this country! From that moment everything celestial in Julien's position rapidly disappeared from his heart. Sitting next to a woman he adored, almost hugging her, in this room where he had been so happy, in the midst of deep darkness, clearly distinguishing that she had been crying for a while, feeling, moving his chest, that she was sobbing, he had the misfortune to become a cold politician almost as calculating and as cold as when, in the courtyard of the seminary, he saw himself the target of some bad joke on the part of a of his comrades stronger than him. Julien made his story last, and spoke of the unhappy life he had led since his departure from Verrières. Thus, Madame de Rênal said to herself, after a year's absence, deprived almost entirely of traces of memory, while I forgot him, he was occupied only with the happy days he had found at Vergy. Her sobs redoubled. Julien saw the success of his story. He understood that it was necessary to try the last resource: he arrived abruptly at the letter which he had just received from Paris.","“How I’ll be shamed, if I’m sent packing! Such a failure would poison my entire life,” he told himself. “She’ll never write to me. God only knows when I’ll come back to this part of the country!” Then and there, whatever admixture of the celestial there had been in Julien’s attitude, and in his heart, rapidly disappeared. Sitting next to a woman he adored, virtually holding her in his arms, in this very room where, once, he had been so happy, wrapped in total darkness, very much aware that a brief moment ago she had begun weeping, sensing her sobs from her heaving breast, he became, alas! a cold schemer, almost as calculating and cold as when, in the seminary courtyard, he’d found himself the target of some nasty joke, played by a classmate much stronger than he was. Julien dragged out his story, and spoke of the miserable existence he’d led since leaving Verrières. “So,” said Madame de Rênal to herself, “after a year away, almost completely deprived of any sign that he was remembered, and while I was forgetting him, all he thought about were the happy days he experienced at Vergy.” Her sobs grew stronger. Julien saw how successful his story had been. He understood that, now, he had to deploy his final resource: he turned, swiftly, to the letter he’d just received from Paris.","“What a disgrace for me if I am dismissed. My remorse will embitter all my life,” he said to himself, “she will never write to me. God knows when I shall come back to this part of the country.” From this moment Julien’s heart became rapidly oblivious of all the heavenly delights of his present position. Seated as he was close to a woman whom he adored and practically clasping her in his arms in this room, the scene of his former happiness, amid a deep obscurity, seeing quite clearly as he did that she had just started crying, and feeling that she was sobbing from the heaving of her chest, he was unfortunate enough to turn into a cold diplomatist, nearly as cold as in those days when in the courtyard of the seminary he found himself the butt of some malicious joke on the part of one of his comrades who was stronger than he was. Julien protracted his story by talking of his unhappy life since his departure from Verrières. “So,” said Madame de Rênal to herself, “after a year’s absence and deprived almost entirely of all tokens of memory while I myself was forgetting him, he only thought of the happy days that he had had in Verrières.” Her sobs redoubled. Julien saw the success of his story. He realised that he must play his last card. He abruptly mentioned a letter he had just received from Paris."
"Que de peine ne se donnait-il pas pour arriver à ce front béat et étroit, à cette physionomie de foi fervente et aveugle, prête à tout croire et à tout souffrir, que l’on trouve si fréquemment dans les couvents d’Italie, et dont à nous autres laïcs, le Guerchin a laissé de si parfaits modèles dans ses tableaux d’église.[*]","What pains did he not take to arrive at that happy and narrow forehead, that face of fervent and blind faith, ready to believe everything and to suffer everything, which one finds so frequently in the convents of Italy, and of which to us lay people Guercino left such perfect models in his church paintings.[*]","How hard he strove to achieve a face of fervent, blind faith, prepared to believe anything and suffer everything —the face so often found in Italian monasteries, and of which, among our nonecclesiastics, Guercino has left, in his religious paintings, such perfect models.

Comprenez donc, mon cher, combien la méprise est grave.","It is to show oneself inferior. Are you bored, on the contrary, it is what has tried in vain to please you that is inferior. Understand then, my dear, how serious the mistake is.","“It’s a demonstration of inferiority. If you really are bored, on the other hand, this sort of thing would show that whoever’s been trying hard to please you is your inferior. Understand me, my dear friend: showing contempt is a serious business.”","“That means showing one’s own inferiority; if, on the other hand you are bored, it is only what has made an unsuccessful attempt to please you, which is inferior. So realise, my dear friend, the enormity of your mistake.”"
"Mathilde croyait voir le bonheur. Cette vue toute-puissante sur les âmes courageuses, liées à un esprit supérieur, eut à lutter longuement contre la dignité et tous les sentiments de devoirs vulgaires. Un jour, elle entra chez sa mère, dès sept heures du matin, la priant de lui permettre de se réfugier à Villequier. La marquise ne daigna pas même lui répondre, et lui conseilla d’aller se remettre au lit. Ce fut le dernier effort de la sagesse vulgaire et de la déférence aux idées reçues.","Mathilde thought she saw happiness. This all-powerful view of courageous souls, linked to a superior spirit, had to struggle for a long time against dignity and all feelings of vulgar duty. One day she went to her mother's at seven o'clock in the morning, begging her to allow her to take refuge in Villequier. The Marquise did not even deign to answer him, and advised him to go back to bed. It was the last effort of vulgar wisdom and deference to received ideas.","Mathilde believed she was reaching happiness. This vista, all-powerful for courageous hearts bound to superior minds, had long been struggling against both her personal dignity and her sense of everyday responsibilities. One day she went to her mother, at seven in the morning, asking for permission to hide herself at Villequier. The marquise didn’t bother to answer, suggesting only that the girl go back to bed. This was a final effort by ordinary common sense and deference to received notions.","Mathilde thought she was in sight of happiness. This vista, irresistible as it is for those who combine a superior intellect with a courageous soul, had to struggle for a long time against her self-respect and all her vulgar duties. One day she went into her mother’s room at seven o’clock in the morning and asked permission to take refuge in Villequier. The marquise did not even deign to answer her, and advised her to go back to bed. This was the last effort of vulgar prudence and respect for tradition."
"M. de Croisenois alla le prier de les démentir: M. de Thaler lui montra des lettres anonymes à lui adressées, et remplies de détails rapprochés avec tant d’art qu’il fut impossible au pauvre marquis de ne pas entrevoir la vérité.","M. de Croisenois went to beg him to deny them: M. de Thaler showed him anonymous letters addressed to him, and filled with details brought together with such art that it was impossible for the poor Marquis not to glimpse the truth.","Monsieur de Croisenois requested that he publicly deny these statements. Monsieur de Thaler showed him certain anonymous letters he had received, full of details so skillfully juxtaposed that poor de Croisenois could not tell what was false and what was true.","M. de Croisenois went and asked him to recant them; M. de Thaler showed him some anonymous letters which had been sent to him, and which were full of details so artfully put together that the poor marquis could not help catching a glimpse of the truth."

"Cette lettre, extrêmement longue et à demi effacée par des larmes était bien de la main de Mme de Rênal elle était même écrite avec plus de soin qu’à l’ordinaire.","This letter, extremely long and half erased by tears, was indeed in Madame de Rênal's hand; it was even written with more care than usual.","This extremely long letter, partially erased by tears, had in fact been written by Madame de Rênal. She had written it, indeed, more carefully than usual.","This extremely long letter, which was almost blotted out by tears, was certainly in Madame de Rênal’s handwriting; it was even written with more than ordinary care."
"Enfin il atteignit le sommet de la grande montagne, près duquel il fallait passer pour arriver, par cette route de traverse, à la vallée solitaire qu’habitait Fouqué, le jeune marchand de bois son ami. Julien n’était point pressé de le voir, lui ni aucun autre être humain. Caché comme un oiseau de proie, au milieu des roches nues qui couronnent la grande montagne, il pouvait apercevoir de bien loin tout homme qui se serait approché de lui. Il découvrit une petite grotte au milieu de la pente presque verticale d’un des rochers. Il prit sa course, et bientôt fut établi dans cette retraite. Ici, dit-il avec des yeux brillants de joie, les hommes ne sauraient me faire de mal. Il eut l’idée de se livrer au plaisir d’écrire ses pensées, partout ailleurs si dangereux pour lui. Une pierre carrée lui servait de pupitre. Sa plume volait: il ne voyait rien de ce qui l’entourait. Il remarqua enfin que le soleil se couchait derrière les montagnes éloignées du Beaujolais.","Finally he reached the summit of the great mountain, near which he had to pass to arrive, by this side road, at the solitary valley inhabited by Fouqué, the young timber merchant his friend. Julien was in no hurry to see him or any other human being. Hidden like a bird of prey, among the bare rocks that crown the great mountain, he could see from afar any man who approached him. He discovered a small cave in the middle of the almost vertical slope of one of the rocks. He took his course, and was soon established in this retreat. Here, he said with eyes shining with joy, men can do me no harm. He had the idea of indulging in the pleasure of writing down his thoughts, everywhere else so dangerous for him. A square stone served as his desk. His pen flew: he saw nothing of his surroundings. He finally noticed that the sun was setting behind the distant Beaujolais mountains.","He finally reached the summit of the great mountain, near which the route he was following would take him, leading down to the isolated valley in which lived his friend, the young timber merchant, Fouqué. Julien felt no urgency about seeing him, neither him nor any other human being. Hidden like a hunting hawk amid the bare rocks crowning the mountain, he could spot from a long way off anyone who might be approaching him. He found a small cave set in the virtually vertical slope of a boulder. He climbed up and was soon settled in this hideaway. “Here,” he said, his eyes shining with pleasure, “no one could ever hurt me.” It occurred to him that he might linger, free to write out his thoughts, otherwise so risky if set down on paper. A square rock became his desk. His pen flew: he was not aware of where he was. Finally, he realized that the sun was setting behind the mountain range that went all the way to Beaujolais.","Finally, he reached the summit of the great mountain, near which he had to pass in order to arrive by this cross-country route at the solitary valley where lived his friend Fouqué, the young wood merchant. Julien was in no hurry to see him; either him, or any other human being. Hidden like a bird of prey amid the bare rocks which crowned the great mountain, he could see a long way off anyone coming near him. He discovered a little grotto in the middle of the almost vertical slope of one of the rocks. He found a way to it, and was soon ensconced in this retreat. “Here,” he said, “with eyes brilliant with joy, men cannot hurt me.” It occurred to him to indulge in the pleasure of writing down those thoughts of his which were so dangerous to him everywhere else. A square stone served him for a desk; his pen flew. He saw nothing of what was around him. He noticed at last that the sun was setting behind the distant mountains of Beaujolais."
Aux armes! s’écria Julien. Et il franchit d’un saut les marches du perron de l’hôtel. Il entra dans l’échoppe de l’écrivain du coin de la rue; il lui fit peur.,To arms! cried Julian. And he jumped up the steps of the front steps of the hotel. He walked into the writer's shop around the corner; he frightened her.,"“To arms!” Julien exclaimed to himself. Then he went out the front door, leaped down the steps, and went straight to the copyist stall at the corner. The man was frightened by his appearance.",“To arms!” exclaimed Julien. And he bounded up the flight of steps of the hôtel with one stride. He entered the stall of the street scrivener; he frightened him.
"— Enfin, la blessure n’est pas mortelle, lui dit Julien impatienté en s’avançant vers lui, tu m’en réponds sur ta vie?","— Finally, the wound is not mortal, said Julien impatiently, advancing towards him, can you tell me about your life?","“You mean, the wound wasn’t fatal?” Julien said impatiently. “You’d stake your life on that?”","“Anyway, the wound is not mortal,” said Julien to him impatiently, “you answer for it on your life?”"
"J’ai ma revanche! pensa-t-il. Enfin, voici un moyen de conduire cette petite personne si décidée; je tremblais de n’y pas réussir. L’air distingué et peu facile à mener redoublait à ses yeux le charme de la rare beauté qu’il voyait presque suppliante devant lui. Il reprit tout son sang-froid, et n’hésita point à retourner le poignard dans son coeur.","I have my revenge! he thought. Finally, here is a way to lead this determined little person; I trembled at not succeeding. Her air of distinction and not easy to lead redoubled in his eyes the charm of the rare beauty which he saw almost supplicating before him. He regained his composure, and did not hesitate to turn the dagger in his heart.","“Now I can even the score!” he thought. “Finally, I have a way of managing this very determined little lady: I was quivering, afraid of not finding one.” The noble and rather unmanageable charm of this beautiful woman doubled, in his eyes, as he saw her virtually a supplicant. He recovered his cold collectedness, and did not hesitate to twist the dagger in her heart.","“I have my revenge,” he thought. “After all, it’s a way of managing this decided young person. I was afraid that I should not succeed.” Her distinguished and intractable appearance intensified in his eyes the charm of the rare beauty whom he now saw practically entreating him. He regained all his self-possession—and he did not hesitate to move the dagger about in her heart."
"— Je ne puis, répondit-elle l’honneur parle, j’ai vu le devoir, il faut le suivre, et à l’instant.","""I cannot,"" she replied, honor speaks, ""I have seen the duty, it must be followed, and at once.""","“I can’t,” she answered. “Honor calls. I have seen my duty and I must observe it—and immediately.”","“I cannot,” she answered, “it is the voice of honour, I have seen my duty, I must follow it, and follow it at once.”"
"Le lendemain matin Julien trouva quelque chose d’étrange dans la manière dont ses camarades lui parlaient. Il n’en fut que plus réservé. Voilà, pensa-t-il, l’effet de la démission de M. Pirard. Elle est connue de toute la maison, et je passe pour son favori. Il doit y avoir de l’insulte dans ces façons; mais il ne pouvait l’y voir. Il y avait, au contraire, absence de haine dans les yeux de tous ceux qu’il rencontrait le long des dortoirs: Que veut dire ceci? C’est un piège sans doute, jouons serré. Enfin le petit séminariste de Verrières lui dit en riant:","The next morning Julien found something strange in the way his comrades spoke to him. He was all the more reserved. That, he thought, is the effect of M. Pirard's resignation. She is known to the whole house, and I pass for her favourite. There must be insult in these ways; but he could not see her there. There was, instead, an absence of hatred in the eyes of everyone he met along the dormitories: What does this mean? It's a trap no doubt, let's play tight. Finally the minor seminarian of Verrières said to him, laughing:","The next morning, Julien noticed something strange in the way his classmates spoke to him. It made him even more reserved. “Here we have,” he thought, “the effect of Father Pirard’s resignation. They all know it, and I’m supposed to be his favorite. There must be something nasty about this behavior.” But he could not see anything of the sort. On the contrary: he saw no hatred in the eyes of those he met, walking through the dormitory. “What does this mean? It must be a trap. Let me play this very close to the vest.” Then the little seminarian from Verrières shouted, laughing: “Corneli Taciti opera omnia, the complete works of Tacitus!”","The following morning Julien noticed a certain strangeness in the manner in which his comrades spoke to him. It only made him more reserved. “This,” he thought, “is the result of M. Pirard’s resignation. It is known over the whole house, and I pass for his favourite. There ought logically to be an insult in their demeanour.” But he could not detect it. On the contrary, there was an absence of hate in the eyes of all those he met along the corridors. “What is the meaning of this? It is doubtless a trap. Let us play a wary game.” Finally the little seminarist said to him with a laugh,"
"Mais où cet homme veut-il en venir avec toute cette friperie, pensait Julien? Cette préparation adroite dure depuis un siècle, et rien ne paraît. Il faut qu’il se méfie bien de moi! Il est plus adroit que tous les autres, dont en quinze jours on devine si bien le but secret. Je comprends, l’ambition de celui-ci souffre depuis quinze ans!","But where is this man going with all this thrift, thought Julien? This skilful preparation has lasted for a century, and nothing appears. He must be careful of me! He is more skilful than all the others, whose secret goal can be guessed so well in a fortnight. I get it, this one’s ambition has been suffering for fifteen years!","thought Julien. “He’s been building this up, like a master, for a hundred years, and there’s still nothing in sight. It’s got to be that he really mistrusts me! He’s smarter than all the others: in two weeks you can easily figure out their secret goal. But I understand: this fellow has been putting up with it for fifteen years!”","“But what is the fellow getting at with all this old clothes business,” thought Julien. “These adroit preliminaries have been going on for centuries, and nothing comes of them. He must be very suspicious of me. He is cleverer than all the others, whose secret aim can be guessed so easily in a fortnight. I understand. He must have been suffering for fifteen years from mortified ambition.”"
"Pour se donner une contenance, elle prit dans ses mains les lettres de Mme de Fervaques; elle les décachetait lentement. Elle eut un mouvement nerveux bien marqué, quand elle reconnut l’écriture de la maréchale. Elle tournait sans les lire les feuilles de ces lettres; la plupart avaient six pages.","To keep herself countenance, she took Madame de Fervaques's letters in her hands; she unsealed them slowly. She made a very marked nervous movement when she recognized the maréchale's handwriting. She turned over the sheets of these letters without reading them; most had six pages.","To help restore herself, she picked up Madame de Fervaques’s letters; she slowly opened them. She started, nervously and markedly, as she recognized the handwriting. She turned over all the pages, without reading them; most were six pages long.","In order to keep herself in countenance, she took Madame de Fervaques’ letters in her hands, and slowly broke the seals. She gave a noticeable nervous movement when she recognised the maréchale’s handwriting. She turned over the pages of these letters without reading them. Most of them were six pages."
"Il a sur moi un empire immense, puisqu’il règne par la terreur et peut me punir d’une peine atroce, si je le pousse à bout. Cette seule idée suffisait pour porter Mathilde à l’outrage, car le courage était la première qualité de son caractère. Rien ne pouvait lui donner quelque agitation et la guérir d’un fond d’ennui sans cesse renaissant que l’idée qu’elle jouait à croix ou pile son existence entière.","He has an immense empire over me, since he reigns by terror and can punish me with an atrocious punishment, if I push him to the limit. This idea alone was enough to bring Mathilde into outrage, for courage was the first quality of her character. Nothing could give her some agitation and cure her of an ever-recurring background of boredom than the idea that she was playing crosses or tails her entire existence.","“He has immense power over me, since he rules by terror and can punish me with tremendous pain if I push at him too hard.” This alone was enough to lead Mademoiselle de La Mole to show him stern disrespect: her character’s primary attribute was courage. Nothing could have set her in restless motion, and cure her of her endless boredom, without forever quickening her sense that she was gambling for the highest of all stakes, her very existence at risk.","“He has an immense dominion over me since his reign is one of terror, and he is capable, if I provoke him, of punishing me with an awful penalty.” This idea alone was enough to induce Mademoiselle de la Mole to insult him. Courage was the primary quality in her character. The only thing which could give her any thrill and cure her of a fundamental and chronically recurring ennui was the idea that she was staking her entire existence on a single throw."
"Il la trouva sombre et solitaire. A l’occasion d’une fête, toutes les croisées de l’édifice avaient été couvertes d’étoffe cramoisie. Il en résultait, aux rayons du soleil, un effet de lumière éblouissant, du caractère le plus imposant et le plus religieux. Julien tressaillit. Seul dans l’église, il s’établit dans le banc qui avait la plus belle apparence. Il portait les armes de M. de Rênal.","He found her dark and lonely. On the occasion of a feast, all the windows of the building had been covered with crimson cloth. There resulted, in the rays of the sun, a dazzling effect of light, of the most imposing and religious character. Julien started. Alone in the church, he established himself in the pew which had the most beautiful appearance. He bore the arms of M. de Rênal.","He found it dark and empty. When there was a holy day to be celebrated, all the casement windows were covered with crimson cloth. When the rays of the sun shone through, this produced a dazzling light, deeply impressive and profoundly religious. Julien shivered. All alone in the church, he seated himself in a strikingly attractive pew. It bore Monsieur de Rênal’s coat of arms.","He found it gloomy and deserted. All the transepts in the building had been covered with crimson cloth in celebration of a feast. The result was that the sun’s rays produced an effect of dazzling light of the most impressive and religious character. Julien shuddered. Finding himself alone in the church, he established himself in the pew which had the most magnificent appearance. It bore the arms of M. de Rênal."
"Au bout d’un quart d’heure, qui lui parut une journée, le portier à figure sinistre reparut sur le pas d’une porte à l’autre extrémité de la chambre, et, sans daigner parler lui fit signe d’avancer. Il entra dans une pièce encore plus grande que la première et fort mal éclairée. Les murs aussi étaient blanchis, mais il n’y avait pas de meubles. Seulement dans un coin près de la porte, Julien vit en passant un lit de bois blanc, deux chaises de paille, et un petit fauteuil en planches de sapin sans coussin. A l’autre extrémité de la chambre, près d’une petite fenêtre à vitres jaunies garnie de vases de fleurs tenus salement, il aperçut un homme assis devant une table, et couvert d’une soutane délabrée, il avait l’air en colère, et prenait l’un après l’autre une foule de petits carrés de papier qu’il rangeait sur sa table, après y avoir écrit quelques mots. Il ne s’apercevait pas de la présence de Julien. Celui-ci était immobile debout vers le milieu de la chambre, là où l’avait laissé le portier, qui était ressorti en fermant la porte.","After a quarter of an hour, which seemed like a day to him, the grim-faced porter reappeared on the step of a door at the other end of the room, and, without deigning to speak, beckoned him to come forward. He entered a room even larger than the first and very poorly lit. The walls were also whitewashed, but there was no furniture. Only in a corner near the door did Julien see, as he passed, a white wooden bed, two straw chairs, and a little fir-plank armchair without a cushion. At the other end of the room, near a small window with yellowed panes decorated with vases of flowers held dirty, he saw a man seated before a table, and covered with a dilapidated cassock, he looked angry. , and took one after the other a crowd of small squares of paper which he arranged on his table, after having written a few words on them. He did not notice Julien's presence. He was standing motionless in the middle of the room, where the porter had left him, who had come out closing the door.","A quarter of an hour later, which seemed to him an entire day, the ominous-looking porter reappeared, standing on the threshold of a door at the other end of the room; not troubling himself to speak, he signaled Julien to come. Our hero walked into a room even larger than the first, and even less well lit. Once again, the walls were whitewashed, but there was no furniture. Except that, in the corner nearest the door, Julien had seen a pine-board bed, two straw chairs, and a small armchair, also of pine, which had no cushions. At the far end of the room, near a small, yellow-paned window, there were some dirty flowerpots, and he saw a man in a shabby cassock, seated at a table. Apparently angry, he was plucking up a great many slips of paper, one after the other, writing a few words on each, and then arranging them on the table in front of him. He was not aware of Julien’s presence. The young man stayed more or less in the middle of the room, motionless, exactly where the porter—who had now gone out and shut the door—had left him.","At the end of a quarter of an hour, which seemed a whole day to him, the sinister-looking porter reappeared on the threshold of a door at the other end of the room, and without vouchsafing a word, signed to him to advance. He entered into a room even larger than the first, and very badly lighted. The walls also were whitened, but there was no furniture. Only in a corner near the door Julien saw as he passed a white wooden bed, two straw chairs, and a little pinewood armchair without any cushions. He perceived at the other end of the room, near a small window with yellow panes decorated with badly kept flower vases, a man seated at a table, and covered with a dilapidated cassock. He appeared to be in a temper, and took one after the other a number of little squares of paper, which he arranged on his table after he had written some words on them. He did not notice Julien’s presence. The latter did not move, but kept standing near the centre of the room in the place where the porter, who had gone out and shut the door, had left him."

"— Et remarquez, ajouta l’académicien, que Mlle de La Mole s’appelle Mathilde-Marguerite. La Mole était en même temps le favori du duc d’Alençon et l’intime ami du roi de Navarre, depuis Henri IV, mari de sa maîtresse. Le jour du mardi-gras de cette année 1574, la cour se trouvait à Saint-Germain avec le pauvre roi Charles IX, qui s’en allait mourant. La Mole voulut enlever les princes ses amis, que la reine Catherine de Médicis retenait comme prisonniers à la cour. Il fit avancer deux cents chevaux sous les murs de Saint-Germain, le duc d’Alençon eut peur, et La Mole fut jeté au bourreau.","""And notice,"" added the Academician, ""that Mademoiselle de La Mole is called Mathilde-Marguerite."" La Mole was at the same time the favorite of the Duke of Alençon and the intimate friend of the King of Navarre, since Henri IV, husband of his mistress. On Shrove Tuesday in 1574, the court was at Saint-Germain with poor King Charles IX, who was dying. La Mole wanted to kidnap the princes, his friends, whom Queen Catherine de Medici held as prisoners at court. He made two hundred horses advance under the walls of Saint-Germain, the Duc d'Alençon was frightened, and La Mole was thrown to the executioner.","De La Mole had been the adored lover of Queen Marguerite de Navarre—“and note,” added the academician, “that Mademoiselle de La Mole’s name is Mathilde-Marguerite. Young de La Mole was also the Duke d’Alençon’s favorite, and the King of Navarre’s close friend— his mistress’s husband, afterward Henry IV. On the day of Mardi Gras, in 1574, the royal court was at Saint-Germain, with poor King Charles IX, who was dying. De La Mole wanted to rescue his friends, the royal princes, held captive at the court by Queen Catherine de Médici. He brought two hundred horsemen to the very walls of Saint-Germain, the Duke d’Alençon was frightened, and de La Mole was thrown to the executioner.","La Mole was the adored lover of Queen Marguerite of Navarre and “observe,” continued the academician, “that Mademoiselle de la Mole’s full name is Mathilde Marguerite. La Mole was at the same time a favourite of the Duke d’Alençon and the intimate friend of his mistress’s husband, the King of Navarre, subsequently Henri IV. On Shrove Tuesday of that year 1574, the Court happened to be at St. Germain with poor King Charles IX. who was dying. La Mole wished to rescue his friends the princes, whom Queen Catherine of Medici was keeping prisoner in her Court. He advanced two hundred cavalry under the walls of St. Germain; the Duke d’Alençon was frightened and La Mole was thrown to the executioner."
STERNE,TERN,—STERNE,He heard a loud noise in the corridor.
"Les salons de l’aristocratie sont agréables à citer, quand on en sort, mais voilà tout. L’insignifiance complète, les propos communs surtout qui vont au-devant même de l’hypocrisie finissent par impatienter à force de douceur nauséabonde. La politesse toute seule n’est quelque chose par elle-même que les premiers jours. Julien l’éprouvait; après le premier enchantement, le premier étonnement: La politesse, se disait-il, n’est que l’absence de la colère que donneraient les mauvaises manières. Mathilde s’ennuyait souvent, peut-être se fût-elle ennuyée partout. Alors aiguiser une épigramme était pour elle une distraction et un vrai plaisir.","The salons of the aristocracy are pleasant to quote, when one leaves them, but that is all. The complete insignificance, the common remarks especially which go to the front even of the hypocrisy end up impatient by dint of nauseating sweetness. Politeness alone is something by itself only in the first days. Julien experienced it; after the first enchantment, the first astonishment: Politeness, he said to himself, is only the absence of the anger that bad manners would produce. Mathilde was often bored, perhaps she would have been bored everywhere. So sharpening an epigram was for her a distraction and a real pleasure.","Aristocratic drawing rooms are pleasant to discuss, when you’ve escaped from them, but that’s about all: sheer politeness, never progressing beyond politeness, is worth very little after first meetings. Julien had experienced this, too, after an initial enchantment, an initial surprise. “Politeness,” he told himself, “is merely the absence of that anger which creates bad manners.” Mathilde was frequently bored; it may well have been that she would have been bored wherever she was. Accordingly, honing an epigram was for her both a distraction and a genuine pleasure.","The salons of the aristocracy are nice enough to brag about when you leave them, but that is all; mere politeness alone only counts for something in its own right during the first few days. Julien experienced this after the first fascination and the first astonishment had passed off. “Politeness,” he said to himself “is nothing but the absence of that bad temper which would be occasioned by bad manners.” Mathilde was frequently bored; perhaps she would have been bored anywhere. She then found a real distraction and real pleasure in sharpening an epigram."
"Cette magnificence mélancolique, dégradée par la vue des briques nues et du plâtre encore tout blanc, toucha Julien. Il s’arrêta en silence. A l’autre extrémité de la salle, près de l’unique fenêtre par laquelle le jour pénétrait, il vit un miroir mobile en acajou. Un jeune homme, en robe violette et en surplis de dentelle, mais la tête nue, était arrêté à trois pas de la glace. Ce meuble semblait étrange en un tel lieu, et, sans doute, y avait été apporté de la ville. Julien trouva que le jeune homme avait l’air irrité; de la main droite, il donnait gravement des bénédictions du côté du miroir.","This melancholy magnificence, degraded by the sight of the bare bricks and the still white plaster, touched Julien. He stopped in silence. At the other end of the room, near the single window through which daylight entered, he saw a movable mahogany mirror. A young man, in a violet robe and lace surplice, but his head bare, had stopped three paces from the mirror. This piece of furniture seemed strange in such a place, and, no doubt, had been brought there from the city. Julien found that the young man looked irritated; with his right hand he gravely gave blessings from the side of the mirror.","Julien was moved by this melancholy magnificence, so disfigured by bare bricks and untouched white plaster. He stopped, silent. At the far end of the hall, near the one window through which daylight penetrated, he saw a large swing-mounted mirror, framed in mahogany. A young man in a purple cassock and a lace overrobe, his head bare, was standing three steps from the glass. It seemed an odd furnishing for such a place; clearly, it had been brought from town. Julien noted how the young man was frowning; the mirror showed him making the sign of the cross with his right hand, in utter gravity.","This melancholy magnificence, debased as it was by the sight of the bare bricks and the plaster (which was still quite white) affected Julien. He stopped in silence. He saw at the other extremity of the hall, near the one window which let in the daylight, a movable mahogany mirror. A young man in a violet robe and a lace surplice, but with his head bare, was standing still three paces from the glass. This piece of furniture seemed strange in a place like this, and had doubtless been only brought there on the previous day. Julien thought that the young man had the appearance of being irritated. He was solemnly giving benedictions with his right hand close to the mirror."
"Son amour et son bonheur augmentaient rapidement à mesure qu’il s’éloignait du moment de la bataille; il en était déjà à se blâmer. Comment ai-je pu lui résister! se disait-il, si elle allait ne plus m’aimer! un moment peut changer cette âme altière, et il faut convenir que je l’ai traitée d’une façon affreuse.","His love and happiness increased rapidly as he moved away from the moment of battle; he was already blaming himself. How could I resist him! he said to himself, if she were to stop loving me! a moment can change this haughty soul, and it must be admitted that I have treated it in a dreadful manner.","His love and his happiness grew rapidly, the more distant became the time of the battle; he had already begun to criticize himself. “How could I have resisted her?” he asked himself. “What if she won’t ever love me anymore? One instant can change that haughty heart, and it must be plain that I treated her abominably.”","His love and his happiness rapidly increased in proportion to the time that elapsed from the moment of the battle.

"— Il est sournois et porte un sabre, répondait le voisin, il serait assez traître pour leur couper la figure. Les propos de la société noble étaient plus dangereux.

The words of the noble society were more dangerous. The ladies wondered if it was from the mayor alone that this high impropriety came. In general, justice was done to his contempt for birth defects.","“He’s a sneaky sort, and he’s wearing a sword,” said a man nearby. “He’s vicious enough to slash them across the face.” The aristocracy’s remarks were deadlier. The ladies wondered if it had been the mayor all by himself who’d perpetrated this gross impropriety. Most of them knew the mayor’s contempt for those of low birth.","“He is cunning and carries a sabre,” answered her neighbour. “He would be dastardly enough to slash them in the face.” The conversation of aristocratic society was more dangerous. The ladies began to ask each other if the mayor alone was responsible for this grave impropriety. Speaking generally, they did justice to his contempt for lack of birth."

"Ainsi, partout de la fausseté, dit Julien. Voilà il signor Geronimo qui va à Londres avec soixante mille francs d’appointements. Sans le savoir-faire du directeur de San Carlino, sa voix divine n’eût peut-être été connue et admirée que dix ans plus tard… Ma foi, j’aimerais mieux être un Geronimo qu’un Rênal. Il n’est pas si honoré dans la société, mais il n’a pas le chagrin de faire des adjudications comme celle d’aujourd’hui, et sa vie est gaie.","Thus, falsehood everywhere, says Julien. Here is Signor Geronimo going to London with a salary of sixty thousand francs. Without the know-how of the director of San Carlino, his divine voice would perhaps not have been known and admired until ten years later... Well, I would rather be a Geronimo than a Rênal. He is not so honored in society, but he does not have the sorrow of making auctions like today's, and his life is gay.","“So: Falsity is everywhere,” Julien said to himself. “Here’s Signor Géronimo going to London with sixty thousand francs guaranteed. Without the calm worldliness of the San Carlino’s director, perhaps his divine voice might not have been known and admired for another ten years. Really, I’d much rather be a Géronimo than a de Rênal. The singer’s not so honored in Italian society, but he doesn’t have to experience the misery of auctions, like the one earlier today, and his life is merry.”","“And so, falsehood everywhere,” said Julien. “There is Signor Geronimo on his way to London with a salary of sixty thousand francs. But for the cleverness of the Director of San Carlino, his divine voice might not have been known and admired for another ten years, perhaps . . . Upon my soul, I would rather be a Geronimo than a Rênal. He is not so highly honoured in society, but he has not the humiliation of having to grant leases like that one today, and his is a merry life.”"

Accordingly, is there any hope of your succeeding? That is the question. This is a way of telling you that, as for myself, I failed. Now that I’m no longer angry, I try to rationalize it like this: she’s often irritable, and as I’ll explain in a moment, she can be quite spiteful.","“I understand,” he said to Julien at last. “Has the Maréchale de Fervaques had lovers, or has she not? Have you consequently any hope of success? That is the question. I don’t mind telling you, for my own part, that I have failed.

"La jalousie de ses frères, la présence d’un père despote et rempli d’humeur, avaient gâté aux yeux de Julien les campagnes des environs de Verrières. A Vergy il ne trouvait point de ces souvenirs amers; pour la première fois de sa vie il ne voyait point d’ennemi. Quand M. de Rênal était à la ville, ce qui arrivait souvent, il osait lire; bientôt, au lieu de lire la nuit, et encore en ayant soin de cacher sa lampe au fond d’un vase à fleurs renversé, il put se livrer au sommeil, le jour dans l’intervalle des leçons des enfants, il venait dans ces rochers avec le livre, unique règle de sa conduite et objet de ses transports. Il y trouvait à la fois bonheur, extase et consolation dans les moments de découragement.","The jealousy of his brothers, the presence of a despotic and ill-tempered father, had spoiled in Julien's eyes the countryside around Verrières. At Vergy he found none of these bitter memories; for the first time in his life he saw no enemy.

He had no bitter memories in Vergy; for the first time in his life there were no enemies anywhere in sight. When Monsieur de Rênal was in the city, as he often was, Julien was not afraid to read. Soon, instead of reading only at night and being careful, still, to hide his lamp under an inverted flower vase, he was able to let himself sleep; during the day, in the intervals between the children’s lessons, he brought a book to these great rocks, which were the sole supervisor of his behavior and the object of his immense delight.

"Il vit tout à coup Mme de Rênal froncer le sourcil, elle prit un air froid et dédaigneux, cette façon de penser lui semblait convenir à un domestique.

"Ce grand événement avait retrempé le zèle de tous ces messieurs, ils se seraient fâchés de bien peu de chose auparavant, ils ne se fâchèrent plus de rien. Rarement le manque d’égards était direct mais Julien avait déjà surpris à table deux ou trois petits dialogues brefs, entre le marquis et sa femme, cruels pour ceux qui étaient placés auprès d’eux. Ces nobles personnages ne dissimulaient pas le mépris sincère pour tout ce qui n’était pas issu de gens montant dans les carrosses du roi. Julien observa que le mot croisade était le seul qui donnât à leur figure l’expression du sérieux profond, mêlé de respect. Le respect ordinaire avait toujours une nuance de complaisance.","This great event had rekindled the zeal of all these gentlemen, they would have been angry at very little before, they were angry at nothing. The lack of respect was rarely direct, but Julien had already overheard two or three brief little conversations at the table between the Marquis and his wife, cruel for those who were placed near them. These noble characters did not hide the sincere contempt for all that did not come from people riding in the king's carriages. Julien observed that the word crusade was the only one that gave their faces the expression of profound seriousness, mingled with respect. Ordinary respect always had a shade of complacency.","This noble event had strengthened the zeal of all these gentlemen: if they’d been irritated, before, by almost anything, now they were irritated by nothing. Lack of respect for them was seldom blunt, but Julien had already been startled, two or three times, by brief exchanges between the marquis and his wife, which were hard on those seated around them. These aristocrats never disguised their honest scorn for everyone not descended from those who rode in the king’s carriage. Julien could see that the word Crusade was the only one at which their faces took on an expression of deep seriousness, blended with respect. Usually, their respect carried with it a flavor of condescension.","This great event had whetted the zeal of all these gentlemen. Previously there were few things to which they would have objected, now they objected to nothing. There was rarely any overt lack of consideration, but Julien had already caught at meals two or three little short dialogues between the marquis and his wife which were cruel to those who were seated near them. These noble personages did not conceal their sincere contempt for everyone who was not sprung from people who were entitled to ride in the carriages of the King. Julien noticed that the word crusade was the only word which gave their face an expression of deep seriousness akin to respect. Their ordinary respect had always a touch of condescension."

"Quelle vue charmante! s’écria Julien; en se parlant ainsi, il ne sentait pas ce qu’exprimaient ces mots.

But his thought treated Julien somewhat as an inferior being whose fortune one makes when and how one wants and whose love one does not even allow oneself to doubt.","“When I’m with someone like Julien, who is deficient only in wealth, as I am not, I will always draw people’s attention; I will not go through life unnoticed. Far from endlessly worrying about a revolution, as all my cousins do—they’re so afraid of the common people that they won’t scold a coachman who takes them where they don’t want to go —I’ll make sure I play a role, and a great one, because the man I’ve chosen has real character, and boundless ambition. What is he lacking? Friends, money? I’ll give him all that.” But in her mind she rather tended to treat Julien as an inferior, someone to be loved when she felt like it.","“Why, if I were the companion of a man like Julien, who only lacks the fortune that I possess, I should be continually exciting attention, I should not pass through life unnoticed. Far from incessantly fearing a revolution like my cousins who are so frightened of the people that they have not the pluck to scold a postilion who drives them badly, I should be certain of playing a rôle and a great rôle, for the man whom I have chosen has a character and a boundless ambition. What does he lack? Friends? Money? I will give them him.” But she treated Julien in her thoughts as an inferior being whose love one could win whenever one wanted."
"— Il me semble, dit Julien en rougissant beaucoup, que je ne devrais pas même répondre à un homme qui me méprise.","— It seems to me, said Julien, blushing deeply, that I shouldn't even answer a man who despises me.","“It would seem to me,” said Julien, turning very red, “that I need not reply at all to a man who shows himself contemptuous of me.”","“It seems to me,” said Julien, blushing violently, “that I ought not even to answer a man who despises me.”"
"— Sauvez-moi la vie, dit Julien à Mme de Rênal, vous seule le pouvez; car vous savez que le valet de chambre me hait à la mort. Je dois vous avouer, madame, que j’ai un portrait je l’ai caché dans la paillasse de mon lit.","'Save my life,' said Julien to Madame de Rênal, 'only you can; for you know the valet hates me to death. I must confess to you, Madame, that I have a portrait; I hid it in the straw mattress of my bed.","“Save my life,” Julien told Madame de Rênal. “You’re the only one who can do it: you know your husband’s valet detests me.

"Plus d’une heure après, quand M. de Rênal rentra avec le nouveau précepteur tout habillé de noir, il retrouva sa femme assise à la même place. Elle se sentit tranquillisée par la présence de Julien, en l’examinant elle oubliait d’en avoir peur. Julien ne songeait point à elle, malgré toute sa méfiance du destin et des hommes, son âme dans ce moment n’était que celle d’un enfant; il lui semblait avoir vécu des années depuis l’instant où, trois heures auparavant, il était tremblant dans l’église. Il remarqua l’air glacé de Mme de Rênal, il comprit qu’elle était en colère de ce qu’il avait osé lui baiser la main. Mais le sentiment d’orgueil que lui donnait le contact d’habits si différents de ceux qu’il avait coutume de porter, le mettait tellement hors de lui-même, et il avait tant envie de cacher sa joie, que tous ses mouvements avaient quelque chose de brusque et de fou. Mme de Rênal le contemplait avec des yeux étonnés.","More than an hour later, when M. de Rênal returned with the new tutor all dressed in black, he found his wife seated in the same place. She felt reassured by the presence of Julien, examining him she forgot to be afraid of him. Julien did not think of her, despite all his mistrust of fate and men, his soul at that moment was only that of a child; he seemed to have lived for years since the moment when, three hours before, he had been trembling in the church. He noticed Madame de Rênal's frozen look, he understood that she was angry that he had dared to kiss her hand. But the feeling of pride which the contact with clothes so different from those he was accustomed to wearing gave him, drove him so out of himself, and he wanted so much to hide his joy, that all his movements something abrupt and crazy. Madame de Rênal gazed at him with astonished eyes.","More than an hour later, when Monsieur de Rênal returned with the new tutor dressed all in black, he found his wife sitting exactly where he had left her. She felt herself soothed, now, by Julien’s presence; as she considered him, she forgot to be afraid. Julien did not think of her at all: in spite of his distrust for fate and men alike, at this moment his soul was nothing but a child’s. He felt that it had been years since, three hours earlier, he had knelt in the church, trembling. He noted Madame de Rênal’s distant air; he understood she was angry because he had dared kiss her hand. But the pride he felt, touching these new garments, so different from those he was used to wearing, threw him sharply out of equilibrium, and he tried so hard to hide his pleasure that everything he did became abrupt; he took on a distinctly foolish air. Madame de Rênal watched him, amazed.","When M. de Rênal came back with the new tutor in his black suit more than an hour later, he found his wife still seated in the same place. She felt calmed by Julien’s presence. When she examined him she forgot to be frightened of him. Julien was not thinking about her at all. In spite of all his distrust of destiny and mankind, his soul at this moment was as simple as that of a child. It seemed as though he had lived through years since the moment, three hours ago, when he had been all atremble in the church. He noticed Madame de Rênal’s frigid manner and realised that she was very angry, because he had dared to kiss her hand. But the proud consciousness which was given to him by the feel of clothes so different from those which he usually wore, transported him so violently and he had so great a desire to conceal his exultation, that all his movements were marked by a certain spasmodic irresponsibility. Madame de Rênal looked at him with astonishment."
"Rien ne put vaincre la vocation de Julien, Fouqué finit par le croire un peu fou. Le troisième jour, de grand matin, Julien quitta son ami pour passer la journée au milieu des rochers de la grande montagne. Il retrouva sa petite grotte, mais il n’avait plus la paix de l’âme, les offres de son ami la lui avaient enlevée. Comme Hercule il se trouvait non entre le vice et la vertu, mais entre là médiocrité suivie d’un bien-être assuré et tous les rêves héroïques de sa jeunesse. Je n’ai donc pas une véritable fermeté, se disait-il; et c’était là le doute qui lui faisait le plus de mal. Je ne suis pas du bois dont on fait les grands hommes, puisque je crains que huit années passées à me procurer du pain, ne m’enlèvent cette énergie sublime qui fait faire les choses extraordinaires.","Nothing could overcome Julien's vocation, Fouqué ended up believing him a little crazy. The third day, very early in the morning, Julien left his friend to spend the day among the rocks of the great mountain. He found his little cave, but he no longer had peace of mind, his friend's offers had taken it away from him. Like Hercules he found himself not between vice and virtue, but between mediocrity followed by assured well-being and all the heroic dreams of his youth. So I have no real firmness, he said to himself; and that was the doubt that hurt him the most. I am not the stuff of which great men are made, since I fear that eight years spent procuring myself bread will deprive me of that sublime energy which causes extraordinary things to be done.","Nothing could prove victorious over Julien’s vocation. In the end, Fouqué thought him slightly insane. The third day, early in the morning, Julien left his friend; he would spend the day walking, surrounded by the great mountain’s rocks and boulders. He located his little cave, but the peace he had brought there the first time had vanished: his friend’s proposals had swept it away. Like Hercules, he felt himself poised in the balance—not between good and evil, but between the mediocrity of an assured livelihood and all his heroic, youthful dreams. “I have no real steadiness,” he told himself, “which makes doubt all the more dangerous. I’m not made of the wood from which great men can be carved, so I worry that eight years spent earning my bread might deprive me of the sublime energy which makes extraordinary things possible.”","Nothing could conquer Julien’s vocation. Fouqué finished by thinking him a little mad. The third day, in the early morning, Julien left his friend, and passed the day amongst the rocks of the great mountain. He found his little cave again, but he had no longer peace of mind. His friend’s offers had robbed him of it. He found himself, not between vice and virtue, like Hercules, but between mediocrity coupled with an assured prosperity, and all the heroic dreams of his youth. “So I have not got real determination after all,” he said to himself, and it was his doubt on this score which pained him the most. “I am not of the stuff of which great men are made, because I fear that eight years spent in earning a livelihood will deprive me of that sublime energy which inspires the accomplishment of extraordinary feats.”"

"Ce fut après avoir fait partir cette lettre que, pour la première fois Julien, un peu revenu à lui, fut très malheureux. Chacune des espérances de l’ambition dut être arrachée successivement de son coeur par ce grand mot: Je mourrai, il faut mourir. La mort en elle-même n’était pas horrible à ses yeux. Toute sa vie n’avait été qu’une longue préparation au malheur, et il n’avait eu garde d’oublier celui qui passe pour le plus grand de tous.","It was after having sent this letter that, for the first time, Julien, who had come to himself a little, was very unhappy. Each of the hopes of ambition had to be torn successively from his heart by this great word: I will die, one must die. Death itself was not horrible to him. His whole life had been one long preparation for misfortune, and he had taken care not to forget the one who passes for the greatest of all.","Only after having sent this letter, and for the first time, was Julien, now a bit more himself, very miserable. All the expectations and hopes of ambition had to be yanked out of his heart, one after the other, by those immense words: I am going to die. Death did not seem to him, in and of itself, horrible. His whole life had been nothing but a long prelude to misery, nor did he have to worry that he might forget what commonly passed as the greatest event of all.","It was only after he had despatched this letter and had recovered himself a little, that Julien felt for the first time extremely unhappy. Those momentous words, I shall die, meant the successive tearing out of his heart of each individual hope and ambition. Death, in itself, was not horrible in his eyes. His whole life had been nothing but a long preparation for unhappiness, and he had made a point of not losing sight of what is considered the greatest unhappiness of all."

Il emprunta des outils à un ancien camarade, et eut bientôt bâti une sorte de bibliothèque dans laquelle il rangea les livres de M. Chélan.","Mr. Chélan had refused the lodgings that the most respected Liberals in the country had offered him when his dismissal drove him from the presbytery. The two rooms he had rented were cluttered with his books. Julien, wanting to show Verrières what a priest was, went to take from his father a dozen fir planks, which he himself carried on his back all along the main street. He borrowed some tools from an old comrade, and soon had built a kind of library in which he arranged M. Chelan's books.","After removal from office drove him out of the rectory, Father Chélan refused lodgings offered him, for political reasons, by the most substantial liberals in the region. The two rooms he’d rented were piled all over with books. Julien, wanting to show Verrières what being a priest was all about, got a dozen pine planks from his father, and lugged them down the highway on his back. Borrowing tools from an old friend, he soon constructed a set of bookshelves, in which he arranged Father Chélan’s books.","M. Chélan had refused the magnificent apartments which the most important Liberals in the district had offered him, when his loss of his living had necessitated his leaving the parsonage. The two rooms which he had rented were littered with his books. Julien, wishing to show Verrières what a priest could do, went and fetched a dozen pinewood planks from his father, carried them on his back all along the Grande-Rue, borrowed some tools from an old comrade and soon built a kind of bookcase in which he arranged M. Chélan’s books."
"Elle s’est appuyée sur mon bras d’une façon bien singulière! se disait Julien. Suis-je un fat, ou serait-il vrai qu’elle a du goût pour moi? Elle m’écoute d’un air si doux, même quand je lui avoue toutes les souffrances de mon orgueil! Elle qui a tant de fierté avec tout le monde! On serait bien étonné au salon, si on lui voyait cette physionomie. Très certainement cet air doux et bon, elle ne l’a avec personne.","She leaned on my arm in a very singular way! thought Julien. Am I fat, or would it be true that she has taste for me? She listens to me with such a sweet air, even when I confess to her all the sufferings of my pride! She who has so much pride with everyone! People would be very surprised in the drawing-room if they saw his countenance. Most certainly this sweet and good air, she does not have it with anyone.","“She leaned on my arm in such a peculiar way!” Julien said to himself. “Am I an arrogant puppy, or can she really have taken a liking to me? She listens to me so sweetly, even when I’m telling her what suffering my pride causes me! She, who’s so haughty with everyone! They’d be truly startled, in the drawing room, if they could see that look on her face. That sweetness, that goodness, isn’t something she ever shows, not to anybody.”","“She leaned on my arm in a very singular way,” said Julien to himself. “Am I a coxcomb, or is it true that she has taken a fancy to me? She listens to me so gently, even when I confess to her all the sufferings of my pride! She too, who is so haughty to everyone! They would be very astonished in the salon if they saw that expression of hers. It is quite certain that she does not show anyone else such sweetness and goodness.”"
"Craignant d’être rencontré dans ses courses à cheval, Julien leur avait dit que cet exercice lui était prescrit par les médecins. L’abbé Pirard l’avait mené dans plusieurs maisons jansénistes. Julien fut étonné, l’idée de la religion était invinciblement liée dans son esprit à celle d’hypocrisie et d’espoir de gagner de l’argent. Il admira ces hommes pieux et sévères qui ne songent pas au budget. Plusieurs jansénistes l’avaient pris en amitié et lui donnaient des conseils. Un monde nouveau s’ouvrait devant lui. Il connut chez les jansénistes un comte Altamira qui avait près de six pieds de haut, libéral condamné à mort dans son pays, et dévot. Cet étrange contraste, la dévotion et l’amour de la liberté, le frappa.","Fearing to be met in his horse races, Julien had told them that this exercise was prescribed to him by the doctors. Father Pirard had taken him to several Jansenist houses. Julien was astonished, the idea of religion was invincibly linked in his mind to that of hypocrisy and the hope of earning money. He admired these pious and severe men who do not think of the budget. Several Jansenists had befriended him and gave him advice. A new world opened up before him. Among the Jansenists he knew a Count Altamira who was nearly six feet tall, a liberal condemned to death in his country, and a devotee. This strange contrast, devotion and love of freedom, struck him.","Worried that his classmates might see him out on horseback, Julien told them this was exercise, and had been prescribed by his doctors. Father Pirard had taken him to several Jansenist communities. Julien was astonished: religion was inextricably tied, in his mind, to hypocrisy and the hope of acquiring riches. He admired these pious, stern men who did not concern themselves with making ends meet. Several Jansenists had become friendly, and given him advice. It was a new world opening in front of him. At one Jansenist community he met Count Altamira, nearly six feet tall, devout and a liberal, who had been condemned to death in his native country. He was struck by the strange contrast between piety and love of liberty.","Julien, fearing that he might meet people during his rides on horseback, had given out that this exercise had been prescribed by the doctors. The Abbé Pirard had taken him into several Jansenist societies. Julien was astonished; the idea of religion was indissolubly connected in his mind with the ideas of hypocrisy and covetousness. He admired those austere pious men who never gave a thought to their income. Several Jansenists became friendly with him and would give him advice. A new world opened before him. At the Jansenists’ he got to know a Comte Altamira, who was nearly six feet high, was a Liberal, a believer, and had been condemned to death in his own country. He was struck by the strange contrast of devoutness and love of liberty."

"Ce don qui classait la famille de Julien dans la partie de la société qu’il faut respecter, porta un coup mortel à l’envie. Il fut une supériorité consacrée par la fortune. Chazel et les plus distingués des séminaristes lui firent des avances, et se seraient presque plaints à lui de ce qu’il ne les avait pas avertis de la fortune de ses parents, et les avait ainsi exposés à manquer de respect à l’argent.","This gift, which placed Julien's family in the part of society that must be respected, dealt a mortal blow to envy.

His became a superiority consecrated by wealth.

So he reveled in the idea that his wife was innocent; this way of seeing did not put him in the need to show character, and suited him much better; how many slandered women have we not seen!","“I’m used to Louise,” he told himself. “She knows all my business: if I were free to marry tomorrow, I couldn’t replace her.” So he soothed himself with the notion that his wife was innocent. This way of looking at things did not require of him any demonstration of character, and it set everything in good order. “After all, how many slandered women have we seen!","“I am accustomed to Louise,” he said to himself, “she knows all my affairs.

"Lui, qui est réellement si beau se dit enfin Mathilde sortant de sa rêverie, faire un tel éloge de la laideur! Jamais de retour sur lui-même! Il n’est pas comme Caylus ou Croisenois.

This Sorel looks a good deal like my father when he does such a good imitation of Napoleon, at a ball.” She’d completely forgotten Danton. “I’m most definitely bored tonight.” She grasped her brother’s arm and, to his great regret, forced him to walk around the ballroom. She conceived the notion of listening in on Julien’s conversation with Altamira, the man under a death sentence.","“To think of a man who is as handsome as he is,” said Mathilde to herself as she emerged from her reverie, “praising ugliness in such a way, he is not like Caylus or Croisenois.

"Cet arrangement convient de plus d’une façon, continua M. de Rênal, en regardant sa femme d’un air diplomatique, le Valenod est tout fier des deux beaux normands qu’il vient d’acheter pour sa calèche.

"En achevant ces mots, M. de La Mole faisait passer Julien dans un salon resplendissant de dorures. Dans les occasions semblables, M. de Rênal ne manquait jamais de doubler le pas pour avoir l’avantage de passer le premier à la porte. La petite vanité de son ancien patron fit que Julien marcha sur les pieds du marquis, et lui fit beaucoup de mal à cause de sa goutte. Ah! il est balourd par-dessus le marché, se dit celui-ci. Il le présenta à une femme de haute taille et d’un aspect imposant. C’était la marquise. Julien lui trouva l’air impertinent, un peu comme Mme de Maugiron, la sous-préfète de l’arrondissement de Verrières, quand elle assistait au dîner de la Saint-Charles. Un peu troublé de l’extrême magnificence du salon, Julien n’entendit pas ce que disait M. de La Mole. La marquise daigna à peine le regarder. Il y avait quelques hommes parmi lesquels Julien reconnut avec un plaisir indicible le jeune évoque d’Agde, qui avait daigné lui parler quelques mois auparavant, à la cérémonie de Bray-le-Haut. Ce jeune prélat fut effrayé sans doute des yeux tendres que fixait sur lui la timidité de Julien, et ne se soucia point de reconnaître ce provincial.","As he finished these words, M. de La Mole ushered Julien into a salon resplendent with gilding. On similar occasions, M. de Rênal never failed to double his pace to have the advantage of passing first through the door. The petty vanity of his former boss caused Julien to step on the Marquis's feet, and hurt him a great deal because of his gout. Ah! he's clumsy on top of that, he thinks to himself. He introduced him to a tall, imposing woman. It was the Marquise. Julien thought he looked impertinent, a little like Madame de Maugiron, the sub-prefect of the arrondissement of Verrières, when she attended the Saint-Charles dinner. A little disturbed by the extreme magnificence of the drawing-room, Julien did not hear what M. de La Mole was saying. The Marquise scarcely deigned to look at him. There were a few men among whom Julien recognized with unspeakable pleasure the young bishop of Agde, who had condescended to speak to him a few months before, at the ceremony at Bray-le-Haut. This young prelate was doubtless frightened by the tender eyes fixed on him by Julien's shyness, and did not care to recognize this provincial.","Having said this, Monsieur de La Mole showed Julien into a drawing room, resplendent in its gilded decor. On similar occasions, Monsieur de Rênal had never failed to walk very fast, so he could go through the door first. His former employer’s petty vanity now caused Julien to step on the marquis’s feet, and give him a good deal of pain, on account of his gout. “Ah, to top it all off, he’s a clumsy oaf,” he said to himself. Julien was presented to a tall lady of imposing appearance. This was the marquise. Julien thought her insolent, rather like Madame de Maugiron, wife of the deputy governor of the Verrières district, when she’d attended the Saint Charles feast day dinner. A bit bothered by the drawing room’s excessive splendor, Julien did not listen to what Monsieur de La Mole was saying. The marquise scarcely troubled herself to look at him. There were a few men in attendance, among whom Julien recognized, with inexpressible pleasure, the young Bishop of Agde, who had been good enough to say a few words to him before the ceremony at Upper Bray. The young bishop was surely startled by the soft, shy glances fixed on him by Julien, and had no interest in recognizing this provincial.","As he finished the sentence M. de la Mole escorted Julien into a salon resplendent with gilding. On similar occasions M. de Rênal always made a point of doubling his pace so as to have the privilege of being the first to pass the threshold. His former employer’s petty vanity caused Julien to tread on the marquis ’s feet and hurt him a great deal because of his gout. “So he is clumsy to the bargain,” he said to himself. He presented him to a woman of high stature and of imposing appearance. It was the marquise. Julien thought that her manner was impertinent, and that she was a little like Madame de Maugiron, the wife of the sub-prefect of the arrondissement of Verrières when she was present at the Saint-Charles dinner. Rendered somewhat nervous by the extreme magnificence of the salon, Julien did not hear what M. de la Mole was saying. The marquise scarcely deigned to look at him. There were several men there, among whom Julien recognised with an inexpressible pleasure the young bishop of Agde who had deigned to speak to him some months before at the ceremony of Bray-le-Haut. This young prelate was doubtless frightened by the tender look which the timidity of Julien fixed on him, and did not bother to recognise “the provincial.”"

"M. de La Mole, impatienté contre son libraire, qui lui envoyait tous les faux Mémoires, chargea Julien d’acheter toutes les nouveautés un peu piquantes.

Certes, ce n’était pas Norbert qui lisait.","M. de La Mole, impatient with his bookseller, who sent him all the false Memoirs, instructed Julien to buy all the slightly spicy novelties. But, in order that the venom should not spread through the house, the secretary had orders to deposit these books in a small library, placed in the marquis' own bedroom. He was soon certain that, however little these new books were hostile to the interests of the throne and the altar, they were not long in disappearing. Certainly, it was not Norbert who was reading.","Monsieur de La Mole grew impatient with his bookseller, who was sending him all the so-called Memoirs, and ordered Julien to buy whatever new volumes were moderately racy. But to keep the poison from spreading through the house, the secretary had been directed to place these in a small bookcase right in the marquis’s room. Julien was soon positive that if any of these new volumes were, to any degree, hostile to the interests of church or throne, it did not take long for them to disappear. He was equally certain that it was not Norbert who was reading them.","M. de la Mole had lost patience with his bookseller, who always sent him all the spurious memoirs, and had instructed Julien to buy all the new books, which were at all stimulating. But in order to prevent the poison spreading over the household, the secretary was ordered to place the books in a little book-case that stood in the marquis’s own room. He was soon quite certain that although the new books were hostile to the interests of both State and Church, they very quickly disappeared. It was certainly not Norbert who read them."

Chelan. For my job, he added pleasantly, is to have lessons recited and to recite them myself.","He stood up, gravely, as six o’clock sounded, and told them of a new theological discussion by Ligorio, which he had been studying for recitation, the next day, to Father Chélan. “Because my business,” he added pleasantly, “is to hear lessons recited, and to recite them myself.”","As six o’clock struck he got up gravely and talked about a chapter in Ligorio’s New Theology which he had to learn by heart to recite on the following day to M.

"Si je demande à quelqu’un la cause de ce deuil, il se trouvera que je commets encore une gaucherie. Julien était tout à fait sorti des profondeurs de son enthousiasme. Il faut que je relise toutes les lettres que j’ai faites ce matin; Dieu sait les mots sautés et les balourdises que j’y trouverai. Comme il lisait avec une attention forcée la première de ces lettres, il entendit tout près de lui le bruissement d’une robe de soie, il se retourna rapidement; Mlle de La Mole était à deux pas de sa table, elle riait. Cette seconde interruption donna de l’humeur à Julien.","If I ask anyone the cause of this mourning, it will turn out that I am still committing an awkwardness. Julien had completely emerged from the depths of his enthusiasm. I must reread all the letters I wrote this morning; God knows the skipped words and the blunders I'll find there. As he was reading with forced attention the first of these letters, he heard quite close to him the rustling of a silk robe, he turned round quickly; Mademoiselle de La Mole was a stone's throw from her table, she was laughing. This second interruption put Julien in a bad mood.","“But if I ask someone this question, I may just be blundering all over again.” Julien had now emerged from the depths of his rapture. “I’ll have to reread the letters I’ve written this morning: God only knows all the words I’ve misspelled, and the mistakes I’ll find.” As he read over the letters, concentrating hard, he heard just behind him the rustle of a silk dress. He turned around rapidly. Mademoiselle de La Mole was no more than two feet away, and she laughed. This second interruption annoyed him.","“If I ask someone the reason for this mourning, they will think I am putting my foot in it again.” Julien had now quite emerged from the depth of his enthusiasm. “I must read over again all the letters I have written this morning. God knows how many missed-out words and blunders I shall find.” As he was forcing himself to concentrate his mind on the first of these letters, he heard the rustle of a silk dress near him. He suddenly turned round. Mademoiselle de la Mole was two yards from his table, she was smiling. This second interruption put Julien into a bad temper."

And me, thrown into the last row by a providence stepmother, me to whom she gave a noble heart and not a thousand francs a year, that is to say, no bread, exactly speaking, no bread, me refusing a pleasure who offers himself! A limpid spring that comes to quench my thirst in the burning desert of mediocrity that I cross so painfully! Well, not so stupid every man for himself in this desert of selfishness called life.","“How good of me,” he told himself, “me, a plebeian, to take pity on a family of such high rank! Me, who the Duke de Chaulnes calls a mere servant! How does the marquis build up his immense fortune? By mortgaging some of his income as soon as he learns, at court, that the next day there’ll be what looks like a coup d’état. And I, thrown to the lowest rungs by that harsh stepmother, Providence, me to whom she gave a noble heart and absolutely no income—which means no bread, to put it exactly, no bread at all—me, to turn down pleasure when it’s offered to me! Clear water seeking to quench my thirst, in this burning desert of mediocrity which I cross so painfully! Good Lord, I’m not so stupid as that! Everyone for himself, in this desert of egoism, better known as life.”","“How kind it is of me,” he said to himself, “me . . . a plebeian, takes pity on a family of this rank! Yes, me, whom the Duke of Chaulnes calls a servant! How does the marquis manage to increase his immense fortune? By selling stock when he picks up information at the castle that there will be a panic of a coup d’état on the following day. And shall I, who have been flung down into the lowest class by a cruel providence—I, whom providence has given a noble heart but not an income of a thousand francs, that is to say, not enough to buy bread with, literally not enough to buy bread with—shall I refuse a pleasure that presents itself? A limpid fountain which will quench my thirst in this scorching desert of mediocrity which I am traversing with such difficulty! Upon my word, I am not such a fool! Each man for himself in that desert of egoism which is called life.”"

"— Qu’importe! reprit fièrement Mlle de La Mole, qui osera dire qu’on m’entend? Je veux guérir à jamais votre petit amour-propre des idées qu’il a pu se figurer sur mon compte.","“What does it matter! resumed Mademoiselle de La Mole proudly, “who will dare to say that they hear me? I want to cure your petty self-esteem forever of the ideas it may have formed about me.",“I don’t care!” she responded haughtily. “Who’s going to dare tell me they’ve overheard me? I want to cure—forever!—any ideas your petty vanity may have had about me.”,“What does it matter?” Mademoiselle de la Mole answered haughtily. “Who will dare to say they have heard me? I want to cure your miserable vanity once and for all of any ideas you may have indulged in on my account.”
"— Je ne veux pas savoir où est cet homme, lui dit un jour le marquis; envoyez-lui cette lettre. Mathilde lut:","""I don't want to know where this man is,"" said the marquis to him one day; send him this letter. Mathilde read:","“I don’t want to know where that man is,” the marquis told her, one day. “Just send him this letter.” Mathilde read it:","“I don’t want to know where the man is,” said the marquis to her one day. “Send him this letter.” Mathilde read:"
"— Il y a meurtre, et meurtre avec préméditation, dit Julien au juge comme à l’avocat. J’en suis fâché, messieurs, ajouta-t-il en souriant; mais ceci réduit votre besogne à bien peu de chose.","""There is murder, and murder with premeditation,"" said Julien to the judge as to the lawyer. I am sorry, gentlemen,” he added, smiling; but this reduces your work to very little.","“It was murder, and premeditated,” Julien said to the judge as well as to the lawyer. “I’m sorry, gentlemen,” he added, smiling, “but this reduces your job to a very small affair.”","“There is murder, and murder with premeditation,” said Julien to the judge as he had done to the advocate, “I am sorry, gentlemen,” he added with a smile, “that this reduces your functions to a very small compass.”"
"Ses épaulettes étaient plus brillantes, parce qu’elles étaient neuves.","His shoulder pads were brighter, because they were new.","His silver shoulder-pieces shone more brightly, since they were new.","His epaulettes were more brilliant than those of the others, because they were new."
"Le lendemain, le surlendemain même froideur de sa part; elle ne le regardait point, elle ne s’apercevait pas de son existence. Julien, dévoré par la plus vive inquiétude, était à mille lieues des sentiments de triomphe qui l’avaient seuls animé le premier jour. Serait-ce, par hasard, se dit-il, un retour à la vertu? Mais ce mot était bien bourgeois pour l’altière Mathilde.","The next day, the day after, the same coldness on his part; she did not look at him, she did not notice his existence. Julien, devoured by the liveliest anxiety, was a thousand leagues from the feelings of triumph which alone had animated him on the first day. Could it be, he thought, a return to virtue? But this word was very bourgeois for the haughty Mathilde.","The next day, and the day after that, her coldness remained the same; she did not look at him; she was not aware of his existence. Gripped by intense discomfort, Julien was a thousand miles from the triumphant feelings which, that first day, had been all there was in his heart. “Could this, by any chance,” he asked himself, “be a return to virtue?” But this was too bourgeois a word for haughty Mathilde.","The day after, and the subsequent day, she showed the same coldness; she did not look at him, she did not notice his existence. Julien was devoured by the keenest anxiety and was a thousand leagues removed from that feeling of triumph which had been his only emotion on the first day. “Can it be by chance,” he said to himself, “a return to virtue?” But this was a very bourgeois word to apply to the haughty Mathilde."
"«Quelle idée a eue votre ami, vient de me dire M. de Frilair, d’aller réveiller et attaquer la petite vanité de cette aristocratie bourgeoise! Pourquoi parler de caste? Il leur a indiqué ce qu’ils devaient faire dans leur intérêt politique: ces nigauds n’y songeaient pas et étaient prêts à pleurer. Cet intérêt de caste est venu masquer à leurs yeux l’horreur de condamner à mort. Il faut avouer que M. Sorel est bien neuf aux affaires. Si nous ne parvenons à le sauver par le recours en grâce, sa mort sera une sorte de suicide…»","“What idea has your friend had, M. de Frilair has just told me, of going to wake up and attack the petty vanity of this bourgeois aristocracy! Why speak of caste? He told them what they had to do in their political interest: these simpletons didn't think about it and were ready to cry. This caste interest came to hide from their eyes the horror of condemning to death. It must be admitted that Mr. Sorel is quite new to business. If we don't manage to save him by means of clemency, his death will be a kind of suicide...""","“ ‘What could have been in your friend’s mind,’ Father de Frilair was just saying to me, ‘setting out to rouse and attack the petty vanity of that aristocratic bourgeois! Why talk about class? He showed them what they had to do, in their own political interest: these simpletons hadn’t ever thought of that; they were ready to weep for him. Raising the idea of class masked their eyes to the horror of passing a death sentence. It must be admitted that Monsieur Sorel is very much a novice in these matters. If we can’t save him, now, by an act of pardon, his death will be a sort of suicide. . . .’ ”","“Why did your friend take it into his head,” M. de Frilair just said to me, “to awaken and attack the petty vanity of that bourgeois aristocracy? Why talk about caste? He pointed out to them what they ought to do in their own political interest; the fools had not been giving it a thought and were quite ready to weep. That caste interest intervened and blinded their eyes to the horror of condemning a man to death. One must admit that M. Sorel is very inexperienced. If we do not succeed in saving him by a petition for a reprieve, his death will be a kind of suicide.”"
"L’angélique douceur que Mme de Rênal devait à son caractère et à son bonheur actuel n’était un peu altérée que quand elle venait à songer à sa femme de chambre Élisa. Cette fille fit un héritage, alla se confesser au curé Chélan et lui avoua le projet d’épouser Julien. Le curé eut une véritable joie du bonheur de son ami, mais sa surprise fut extrême, quand Julien lui dit d’un air résolu que l’offre de Mlle Élisa ne pouvait lui convenir.","The angelic gentleness which Madame de Rênal owed to her character and to her present happiness was only a little altered when she came to think of her chambermaid Elisa. This girl made an inheritance, went to confession to the priest Chélan and confessed to him the project of marrying Julien. The priest was truly delighted by his friend's happiness, but his surprise was extreme when Julien told him with a resolute air that Mademoiselle Élisa's offer could not suit him.","The angelic sweetness that came from Madame de Rênal’s very nature, and from her genuine goodness, was not in the least affected when she thought about her chambermaid, Elisa. Coming into some money, the girl admitted to her confessor, the parish priest, that she hoped to marry Julien. Monsieur Chélan was delighted by his young friend’s good fortune, but was extremely startled when Julien told him, most determinedly, that Mademoiselle Elisa’s offer did not suit him.","It was only when Madame de Rênal began to think of her maid Elisa that there was some slight change in that angelic sweetness which she owed both to her natural character and her actual happiness. The girl had come into a fortune, went to confess herself to the curé Chélan and confessed to him her plan of marrying Julien. The curé was truly rejoiced at his friend’s good fortune, but he was extremely surprised when Julien resolutely informed him that Mademoiselle Elisa’s offer could not suit him."
"Julien, pensif, comparait cette beauté blonde et gaie à certains souvenirs qui l’agitaient souvent. L’idée de la passion dont il avait été l’objet lui ôta presque toute sa timidité. La belle demoiselle n’avait qu’un instant; elle lut dans les regards de Julien.","Julien, pensive, compared this blond and cheerful beauty to certain memories that often agitated him. The idea of the passion of which he had been the object took away almost all his shyness. The beautiful young lady had but a moment; she read Julien's eyes.","Julien was thoughtful, comparing this bright, blonde beauty with memories that frequently stirred him. Thinking of the passion he’d evoked was almost enough to drive away his shyness. The pretty girl had very little time; she understood what she saw in Julien’s eyes.","Julien was pensively comparing this blonde and merry beauty with certain memories which would often thrill him. The thought of the passion of which he had been the object, nearly freed him from all his timidity. The pretty young woman had only one moment to save the situation. She read it in Julien’s looks."
"— Parbleu, jeune homme, vous êtes bon! s’écria Falcoz il s’est fait marteau pour n’être pas enclume, et un terrible marteau encore. Mais je le vois débordé par le Valenod. Connaissez-vous ce coquin-là? voilà le véritable. Que dira votre M. de Rênal lorsqu’il se verra destitué un de ces quatre matins, et le Valenod mis à sa place?","""Parbleu, young man, you are good!"" exclaimed Falcoz, he made himself a hammer so as not to be an anvil, and a terrible hammer still. But I see it overwhelmed by Valenod. Do you know that rascal? this is the real one. What will your M. de Rênal say when he sees himself dismissed one of these mornings, and the Valenod put in his place?","“By God, young man, that’s an example indeed!” exclaimed Falcoz. “He’s turned himself into a hammer, so he won’t become an anvil—and a really terrible hammer. But I suspect he’ll be pushed aside by Valenod. Do you know that scoundrel? He’s the real thing. What’s your Monsieur de Rênal going to say, early some morning, when he finds himself thrown out and Valenod taking his place?”","“Zounds, young man, you’re a nice one,” exclaimed Falcoz. “He turned spider so as not to be fly, and a terrible spider into the bargain. But I see that he is beaten by that man Valenod. Do you know that scoundrel? He’s the villain of the piece. What will your M. de Rênal say if he sees himself turned out one of these fine days, and Valenod put in his place?”"
"— Je veux tenter un dernier effort, dit-elle à sa femme de chambre, je parlerai à M. Julien.","'I want to make one last effort,' she said to her maid, 'I'll talk to Monsieur Julien.","“I’ll make one last try,” madame told the chambermaid; “I’ll talk to Monsieur Julien.”","“I will make a last attempt,” she said to her maid. “I will speak to M. Julien.”"
Jusque-là il s’était senti pénétré d’un mépris sans mélange pour tous les hommes qui assistaient au jugement. L’éloquence plate de l’avocat général augmenta ce sentiment de dégoût. Mais peu à peu la sécheresse d’âme de Julien disparut devant les marques d’intérêt dont il était évidemment l’objet.,Until then he had felt himself imbued with an unmitigated contempt for all the men who were present at the judgment. The flat eloquence of the Advocate General increased this feeling of disgust. But little by little Julien's dryness of soul disappeared before the marks of interest of which he was evidently the object.,"To that point, he felt himself overwhelmingly, and unmitigatedly, contemptuous of everyone on the prosecution side. The platitudinous eloquence of the prosecutor added to his disgust. But bit by bit Julien’s tepid soul quickened, in the face of the signs of interest obviously directed at him.","Up to the present, he had felt himself steeped in an unadulterated contempt for all the persons who were present at the trial. This sentiment of disgust was intensified by the stale eloquence of the advocate-general. But the coldness of Julien’s soul gradually disappeared before the marks of interest of which he was evidently the object."
"Mme de Rênal eut une peur extrême; elle laissa tomber ses ciseaux, son peloton de laine, ses aiguilles, et le mouvement de Julien put passer pour une tentative gauche destinée à empêcher la chute des ciseaux qu’il avait vus glisser. Heureusement ces petits ciseaux d’acier anglais se brisèrent, et Mme de Rênal ne tarit pas en regrets de ce que Julien ne s’était pas trouvé plus près d’elle.","Madame de Rênal was extremely frightened; she dropped her scissors, her ball of wool, her needles, and Julien's movement could pass for a clumsy attempt intended to prevent the fall of the scissors he had seen slipping. Fortunately, these little scissors of English steel broke, and Madame de Rênal did not stop regretting that Julien had not been closer to her.","She let her scissors drop, and her ball of woolen yarn, and her needle, and the forward movement of Julien’s boot was able to pass for a clumsy attempt at breaking the scissors’ fall, since he’d seen them sliding down. Luckily, the scissors, made of English steel, managed to shatter, and Madame de Rênal kept voicing her regret that Julien had not been standing closer.","Madame de Rênal was very much afraid, and let fall her scissors, her ball of wool and her needles, so that Julien’s movement could be passed for a clumsy effort, intended to prevent the fall of the scissors, which presumably he had seen slide. Fortunately, these little scissors of English steel were broken, and Madame de Rênal did not spare her regrets that Julien had not succeeded in getting nearer to her."
"Toutefois, si je n’obéis pas à cette velléité de caractère, je vois la possibilité d’une scène publique; un éclat abaisse ma position dans le monde, et peut me rendre moins aimable aux yeux de Julien. Après l’éclat… pauvreté pour dix ans; et la folie de choisir un mari à cause de son mérite ne peut se sauver du ridicule que par la plus brillante opulence. Si je vis loin de mon père, à son âge, il peut m’oublier… Norbert épousera une femme aimable adroite: le vieux Louis XIV fut séduit par la duchesse de Bourgogne…","However, if I do not obey this inclination of character, I see the possibility of a public scene; an outburst lowers my position in the world, and can make me less lovable in Julien's eyes. After the glare… poverty for ten years; and the folly of choosing a husband because of his merit can only be saved from ridicule by the most brilliant opulence. If I live far from my father, at his age, he can forget me... Norbert will marry a kind, skilful woman: the old Louis XIV was seduced by the Duchess of Burgundy...","“Just the same, if I don’t give in to this characteristic whim, I can see the real possibility of a public quarrel. A scandal would lower my social position, and might well make me less lovable to Julien. After a scandal . . . ten years of poverty—, and the madness of choosing a husband because of his merit, and nothing else, can only be rescued from ridicule by the most gleaming opulence. If I live far away from my father, at his age he might forget me. . . . Norbert will marry some lovable, clever woman: old Louis XIV was seduced by the Duchess of Burgundy.”","All the same, if I do not obey this whim of his, I see the possibility of a public scene; a scandal would lower my position in society, and might render me less fascinating in Julien’s eyes. After the scandal . . . ten years of poverty; and the only thing which can prevent marrying for merit becoming ridiculous is the most brilliant wealth. If I live far away from my father, he is old and may forget me . . . Norbert will marry some clever, charming woman; old Louis XIV. was seduced by the Duchess of Burgundy."

La séance recommença.,The session started again.,The trial resumed.,The court sat again.
"Pour Julien, excepté dans les moments usurpés par la présence de Mathilde, il vivait d’amour et sans presque songer à l’avenir. Par un étrange effet de cette passion, quand elle est extrême et sans feinte aucune, Mme de Rênal partageait presque son insouciance et sa douce gaieté.","For Julien, except in the moments usurped by Mathilde's presence, he lived on love and almost without thinking of the future. By a strange effect of this passion, when it is extreme and without any pretense, Madame de Rênal almost shared his carelessness and his gentle gaiety.","Aside from time stolen away by Mathilde, Julien lived a life of love in which there did not need to be a future. By a strange working of this passion, now that it was at fever pitch and without the slightest pretense, Madame de Rênal almost shared his jauntiness, his gentle gaiety.","As for Julien, except in those moments which were taken up by Mathilde’s presence, he lived on love with scarcely a thought for the future. “In former days,” Julien said to her, “when I might have been so happy, during our walks in the wood of Vergy, a frenzied ambition swept my soul into the realms of imagination."
"— Au fait, au fait, qui doit être fort plaisant avec ton caractère tranquille. Sont-ce les dernières élections qui te chassent de ta province?","- By the way, by the way, which must be very pleasant with your quiet character. Are the last elections driving you out of your province?","“Yes, yes—and by the way, that should all really please someone as peace loving as you. Is it these most recent elections driving you out of the provinces?”",Will there be never a poor little place for the simple passenger?” “Is it the last elections which are forcing you out of the province?”
"— Assez souvent, répondit Fouqué, d’un air interrogatif.","“Quite often,” replied Fouqué, with a questioning air.","“Pretty often,” answered Fouqué, questioningly.","“Pretty often,” said Fouqué in a questioning manner."
"Même en lui supposant l’imagination de Julien, un jeune homme élevé au milieu des tristes vérités de la société de Paris, eût été réveillé à ce point de son roman par la froide ironie, les grandes actions auraient disparu avec l’espoir d’y atteindre, pour faire place à la maxime si connue: Quitte-t-on sa maîtresse, on risque, hélas! d’être trompé deux ou trois fois par jour. Le jeune paysan ne voyait rien entre lui et les actions les plus héroïques, que le manque d’occasion.","Even assuming the imagination of Julien, a young man brought up in the midst of the sad truths of Paris society, would have been awakened at this point in his novel by the cold irony, the great actions would have disappeared with the hope of to reach it, to make room for the well-known maxim: Do you leave your mistress, you risk, alas! to be deceived two or three times a day. The young peasant saw nothing between him and the most heroic deeds, but lack of opportunity.","Even endowing him with an imagination like Julien’s, a young man brought up among the sad truths of Paris society would snap out of the novel he’d been reading, restored by the coldest irony: all the noble deeds would have vanished, along with any hope of accomplishing them, and they would be replaced by the familiar saying, “If you leave your mistress alone, alas, what you risk is being betrayed two or three times a day!” Our young peasant saw nothing blocking him from the most heroic deeds, except the opportunity to perform them.","A young man brought up in the environment of the sad truths of Paris society, would, on reaching this point in his romance, even if we assume him possessed of Julien’s imagination, have been brought back to himself by the cold irony of the situation. Great deeds would have disappeared from out his ken together with hope of achieving them and have been succeeded by the platitude. “If one leaves one’s mistress one runs alas! the risk of being deceived two or three times a day.” But the young peasant saw nothing but the lack of opportunity between himself and the most heroic feats."
"Elle ne parut point au dîner. Le soir elle vint un instant au salon, mais ne regarda pas Julien. Cette conduite lui parut étrange; mais, pensa-t-il, je dois me l’avouer, je ne connais les usages de la bonne compagnie que par les actions de la vie de tous les jours que j’ai vu faire cent fois, elle me donnera quelque bonne raison pour tout ceci. Toutefois, agité par la plus extrême curiosité, il étudiait l’expression des traits de Mathilde, il ne put pas se dissimuler qu’elle avait l’air sec et méchant. Évidemment ce n’était pas la même femme qui, la nuit précédente, avait ou feignait des transports de bonheur trop excessifs pour être vrais.","She did not appear at dinner. In the evening she came to the living room for a moment, but did not look at Julien. This behavior seemed strange to him; but, he thought, I must confess to myself, I only know the customs of good company by the actions of everyday life which I have seen done a hundred times, it will give me some good reason for all this. However, agitated by the most extreme curiosity, he studied the expression of Mathilde's features, he could not hide that she looked dry and mean. Evidently it was not the same woman who, the previous night, had or feigned transports of happiness too excessive to be true.","She did not come down to dinner. Later, she appeared in the drawing room, very briefly, but did not look at Julien. Her conduct seemed to him strange. “But,” he thought, “I don’t know their customs; she’ll give me some good reason for these things.” All the same, impelled by the strongest curiosity, he studied Mathilde’s expression, and could not conceal from himself that she seemed wry and nasty. This was obviously not the same woman who, the night before, had enjoyed—or had feigned—an ecstatic happiness far too great to be real.","She did not appear at dinner. She came for a minute into the salon in the evening, but did not look at Julien. He considered this behaviour strange, “but,” he thought, “I do not know their usages. She will give me some good reason for all this.” None the less he was a prey to the most extreme curiosity; he studied the expression of Mathilde’s features; he was bound to own to himself that she looked cold and malicious. It was evidently not the same woman who on the preceding night had had, or pretended to have, transports of happiness which were too extravagant to be genuine."
"— Ah! tu es toujours l’homme supérieur, celui que j’ai distingué! D’abord, j’ai offert cent francs à un secrétaire de juge, qui prétendait que mon entrée dans ce donjon était impossible. Mais l’argent reçu, cet honnête homme m’a fait attendre, a élevé des objections, j’ai pensé qu’il songeait à me voler…","- Ah! you are always the superior man, the one whom I have distinguished! First, I offered a hundred francs to a judge's secretary, who claimed that my entry into this dungeon was impossible. But the money received, this honest man kept me waiting, raised objections, I thought he was thinking of robbing me...","“Ah, you’re always the superior man I favored! First, I offered a hundred francs to a judge’s secretary, who acted as if my getting in here was an impossibility. But once the money was in his hand, this respectable man kept me waiting, and raised all sorts of objections. I wondered if he was thinking of robbing me.","you are still the same superior man whom I chose to favour. I started by offering a hundred francs to one of the judge’s secretaries, who alleged at first that my admission into this turret was impossible. But once he had got the money the worthy man kept me waiting, raised objections, and I thought that he meant to rob me—” She stopped."
— Danton n’était-il pas un boucher? lui dit-elle.,"""Wasn't Danton a butcher?"" she told him.",“Wasn’t Danton a butcher?” she said to him.,“Was not Danton a butcher?” she said to him.
Il s’arrêta tout à coup et devint rêveur. Il se trouvait de nouveau vis-à-vis cette idée si choquante pour Mathilde:,He suddenly stopped and became thoughtful. Once again he found himself face to face with this idea which was so shocking to Mathilde:,"He stopped abruptly, and returned to his daydreams. He faced, as he had earlier, the thought that had so shocked Mathilde: “In fifteen years, Madame de Rênal will adore my son, and you will have forgotten him.”","He stopped suddenly and became meditative. He found himself again confronted with the idea which shocked Mathilde so much: “In fifteen years, Madame de Rênal will adore my son and you will have forgotten him.”"
"Pourquoi ne passerais-je pas la nuit ici? se dit-il; j’ai du pain, et je suis libre! Au son de ce grand mot son âme s’exalta; son hypocrisie faisait qu’il n’était pas libre même chez Fouqué. La tête appuyée sur les deux mains, regardant la plaine, Julien resta dans cette grotte plus heureux qu’il ne l’avait été de la vie, agité par ses rêveries et par son bonheur de liberté. Sans y songer il vit s’éteindre, l’un après l’autre, tous les rayons du crépuscule. Au milieu de cette obscurité immense, son âme s’égarait dans la contemplation de ce qu’il s’imaginait rencontrer un jour à Paris. C’était d’abord une femme bien plus belle et d’un génie bien plus élevé que tout ce qu’il avait pu voir en province. Il aimait avec passion, il était aimé. S’il se séparait d’elle pour quelques instants, c’était pour aller se couvrir de gloire, et mériter d’en être encore plus aimé.","Why don't I spend the night here? he says to him; I have bread, and I am free! At the sound of this great word his soul was exalted; his hypocrisy meant that he was not free even at Fouqué's. His head resting on both hands, gazing out over the plain, Julien remained in this grotto happier than he had been in life, agitated by his daydreams and his happiness in freedom. Without thinking about it, he saw all the rays of twilight go out, one after another. In the midst of this immense darkness, his soul was lost in the contemplation of what he imagined he would encounter one day in Paris. First of all, she was a much more beautiful woman and of a much higher genius than anything he had seen in the provinces. He loved with passion, he was loved. If he separated from her for a few moments, it was to cover himself with glory, and to deserve to be loved even more.","“Why don’t I spend the night here?” he said to himself. “I’ve got some bread, and I’m free!” The echoes of these wondrous words rang in his soul: hypocrite that he was, he could not be free even with Fouqué. His head in his hands, Julien felt happier, in his cave, than he had ever been in his life, stirred by his wandering thoughts and by the sheer happiness of freedom. Not aware that he was watching, he saw the twilight slowly spreading. In the middle of vast darkness, his soul lost itself in thoughts of what it might be like when he got to Paris. First of all, there would be a woman, both good and beautiful, and with a mind finer than anything he had found in the countryside. He would love her passionately, and he would be loved. If he had to go away, though not for long, it would be to cover himself with glory, thus deserving her love even more.","“Why shouldn’t I pass the night here?” he said to himself. “I have bread, and I am free.” He felt a spiritual exultation at the sound of that great word. The necessity of playing the hypocrite resulted in his not being free, even at Fouqué’s. Leaning his head on his two hands, Julien stayed in the grotto, more happy than he had ever been in his life, thrilled by his dreams, and by the bliss of his freedom. Without realising it, he saw all the rays of the twilight become successively extinguished. Surrounded by this immense obscurity, his soul wandered into the contemplation of what he imagined that he would one day meet in Paris. First it was a woman, much more beautiful and possessed of a much more refined temperament than anything he could have found in the provinces. He loved with passion, and was loved. If he separated from her for some instants, it was only to cover himself with glory, and to deserve to be loved still more."
"Quel parti puis-je tirer de ces étranges confidences? se disait-il. Me voici tout d’un coup en relation intime avec une amie de la célèbre maréchale de Fervaques nièce toute-puissante de Mgr l’évoque de ***, par qui l’on est évêque en France.","What can I learn from these strange confidences? he said to himself. Here I am suddenly in intimate relationship with a friend of the famous Maréchale de Fervaques, all-powerful niece of the Bishop of ***, through whom one is a bishop in France.","“How should I act, in the face of these strange revelations? This sets me in a familiar relationship, all of a sudden, with a woman who is a friend of the famous Madame de Fervaques, niece of the all-powerful Bishop of ———, he who creates bishops here in France.","“What can I get out of these strange confidences?” he said to himself. “Here I am suddenly thrown into intimate relations with a friend of the celebrated Maréchale de Fervaques, who is the all-powerful niece of my lord, bishop of——who can make one a bishop of France."
"Le lendemain, de très grand matin, Julien était à plusieurs lieues de Paris, frappant à la porte du sévère janséniste. Il trouva, à son grand étonnement, qu’il n’était point trop surpris de sa confidence.","The next day, very early in the morning, Julien was several leagues from Paris, knocking at the severe Jansenist's door. He found, to his great astonishment, that he was not too surprised at her confidence.","The next day, very early in the morning, Julien was miles from Paris, knocking at the harsh Jansenist’s door. He discovered, to his immense astonishment, that Father Pirard was not particularly surprised by what he heard.","Very early the next day, Julien was several leagues away from Paris and knocked at the door of the severe Jansenist. He found to his great astonishment that he was not unduly surprised at his confidence."
"Elle s’attendait à des importunités, à des airs de malheur de la part de Julien; elle préparait ses réponses: car sans doute, au sortir du dîner, il essaierait de lui adresser quelques mots. Loin de là, il resta ferme au salon, ses regards ne se tournèrent pas même vers le jardin. Dieu sait avec quelle peine! Il vaut mieux avoir tout de suite cette explication, se dit Mlle de La Mole; elle alla seule au jardin, Julien n’y parut pas. Mathilde vint se promener près des portes-fenêtres du salon; elle le vit fort occupé à décrire à Mme de Fervaques les vieux châteaux en ruine qui couronnent les coteaux des bords du Rhin et leur donnent tant de physionomie. Il commençait à ne pas mal se tirer de la phrase sentimentale et pittoresque qu’on appelle esprit dans certains salons.","She expected importunities, airs of unhappiness from Julien; she was preparing her answers: for no doubt, after dinner, he would try to say a few words to her. Far from it, he remained firm in the living room, his eyes did not even turn towards the garden. God knows how painfully! It is better to have this explanation immediately, said Mademoiselle de La Mole to herself; she went alone to the garden, Julien did not appear there. Mathilde came for a walk near the French windows of the living room; she saw him very busy describing to Madame de Fervaques the old castles in ruins which crown the hillsides on the banks of the Rhine and give them so much character. He was beginning to manage quite well with the sentimental and picturesque phrase which is called wit in certain drawing-rooms.","She expected Julien to come pleading to her, she expected him to act miserable; she had her responses all prepared, because he would surely try to say something to her, as they left the table after dinner. He did nothing of the sort. He stayed steadily where he was, not even glancing toward the garden—God only knows with what painful effort! It would be better, having our explanations quickly said and done, thought Mademoiselle de La Mole. She went into the garden, alone. Julien did not follow her. Mathilde set herself to walking near the drawing room windows. She saw him deeply occupied, describing for Madame de Fervaques’s benefit the old ruined châteaux, crowning the hills along the banks of the Rhine and lending them so much character. He was beginning to do not too badly, developing the sentimental, picturesque phrases that in certain drawing rooms are called spirited, even witty.","She was expecting importunities and airs of unhappiness on the part of Julien; she commenced rehearsing her answers, for he would doubtless try to address some words to her when they left the dinner table. Far from that, he remained stubbornly in the salon and did not even look in the direction of the garden, though God knows what pain that caused him! “It is better to have this explanation out all at once,” thought Mademoiselle de la Mole; she went into the garden alone, Julien did not appear. Mathilde went and walked near the salon window. She found him very much occupied in describing to Madame de Fervaques the old ruined châteaux which crown the banks along the Rhine and invest them with so much atmosphere. He was beginning to acquit himself with some credit in that sentimental picturesque jargon which is called wit in certain salons."
"— J’ai ici trois cent vingt et un aspirants à l’état le plus saint, dit enfin l’abbé Pirard, d’un ton de voix sévère, mais non méchant: sept ou huit seulement me sont recommandés par des hommes tels que l’abbé Chélan; ainsi parmi les trois cent vingt et un, vous allez être le neuvième.

Go lock that door.","“I have here three hundred and twenty-one aspirants for the holiest of professions,” Father Pirard said at last, his voice severe but not unpleasant. “Only seven or eight have been recommended to me by people like Father Chélan.

Go lock that door.”","“I have here three hundred and twenty-one aspirants for the most holy state,” said the Abbé Pirard at last, in a tone, which though severe, was not malicious; “only seven or eight have been recommended to me by such men as the Abbé Chélan; so you will be the ninth of these among the three hundred and twenty-one.

How unworthy I would feel, both of you and of myself, if I tried to deceive him even for an instant.”","“I will write to my father,” said Mathilde to him one day, “he is more than a father to me, he is a friend; that being so, I think it unworthy both of you and of myself to try and deceive him, even for a single minute.”"

"Jadis, au couvent du Sacré-Coeur elle avait aimé Dieu avec passion; elle le craignit de même en cette circonstance. Les combats qui déchiraient son âme étaient d’autant plus affreux qu’il n’y avait rien de raisonnable dans sa peur. Julien éprouva que le moindre raisonnement l’irritait, loin de la calmer, elle y voyait le langage de l’enfer. Cependant, comme Julien aimait beaucoup lui-même le petit Stanislas, il était mieux venu à lui parler de sa maladie: elle prit bientôt un caractère grave. Alors le remords continu ôta à Mme de Rênal jusqu’à la faculté de dormir; elle ne sortait point d’un silence farouche: si elle eût ouvert la bouche, c’eût été pour avouer son crime à Dieu et aux hommes.","Formerly, at the convent of the Sacred Heart, she had loved God with passion; she feared him the same in this circumstance. The battles that tore his soul apart were all the more awful because there was nothing reasonable in his fear. Julien felt that the slightest argument irritated her, far from calming her, she saw in it the language of hell. However, as Julien was very fond of little Stanislas himself, he had better come to talk to him about his illness: it soon took on a serious character. Then continual remorse robbed Madame de Rênal of even her ability to sleep; she did not emerge from a savage silence: if she had opened her mouth, it would have been to confess her crime to God and to men.","Earlier, at the Sacred Heart convent, she’d loved God with a passion; even then she had feared Him. The struggles now lacerating her heart were even more frightful, because her fear had no basis in rational thought. Julien had learned that any attempt at rationality, far from calming her, proved inflammatory: she saw in it the language of hell. However, since Julien himself was very fond of little Stanislas, it was easier for him to talk to her about the child’s illness, which soon became serious. And then remorse kept pushing sleep away from her bed: all she could do was lie in a grim silence, for if she opened her mouth at all, what emerged were confessions of her sins against God and man.","In former times she had loved God passionately in the Convent of the Sacred Heart; in the present circumstances, she feared him with equal intensity. The struggles which lacerated her soul were all the more awful in that her fear was quite irrational. Julien found that the least argument irritated instead of soothing her. She saw in the illness the language of hell. Moreover, Julien was himself very fond of the little Stanislas. It soon assumed a serious character. Then incessant remorse deprived Madame de Rênal of even her power of sleep. She ensconced herself in a gloomy silence: if she had opened her mouth, it would only have been to confess her crime to God and mankind."
"Un jour, le marquis de Croisenois rendit à Mathilde une lettre assez compromettante qu’elle lui avait écrite la veille. Il croyait par cette marque de haute prudence avancer beaucoup ses affaires. Mais c’était l’imprudence que Mathilde aimait dans ses correspondances. Son plaisir était de jouer son sort. Elle ne lui adressa pas la parole de six semaines.","One day, the Marquis de Croisenois returned to Mathilde a rather compromising letter which she had written to him the day before. He believed by this mark of high prudence to advance his affairs much. But it was imprudence that Mathilde liked in her correspondence. His pleasure was to play his spell. She did not speak to him for six weeks.","One day, the Marquis de Croisenois sent her back a significantly compromising letter that, the previous night, she had written him. This demonstration of great prudence seemed to him quite helpful, as a way of furthering his cause. But recklessness was what Mathilde liked in her correspondence. She took real pleasure in games of that sort. She did not speak to him again for a full six weeks.",One day the Marquis de Croisenois returned to Mathilde a fairly compromising letter which she had written the previous night. He thought that he was thereby advancing his cause a great deal by taking this highly prudent step. But the very imprudence of her correspondence was the very element in it Mathilde liked. Her pleasure was to stake her fate. She did not speak to him again for six weeks.
"Dans la bataille qui se prépare, ajouta-t-il, l’orgueil de la naissance sera comme une colline élevée, formant position militaire entre elle et moi. C’est là-dessus qu’il faut manoeuvrer. J’ai fort mal fait de rester à Paris; cette remise de mon départ m’avilit et m’expose, si tout ceci n’est qu’un jeu. Quel danger y avait-il à partir? Je me moquais d’eux, s’ils se moquent de moi. Si son intérêt pour moi a quelque réalité, je centuplais cet intérêt.","In the coming battle, he added, the pride of birth will be like a high hill, forming a military position between her and me. This is where you have to maneuver. I did very badly to stay in Paris; this postponement of my departure debases me and exposes me, if all this is only a game. What danger was there in leaving? I laughed at them, if they laughed at me. If his interest in me has any reality, I increase that interest a hundredfold.","“In the coming combat,” he added, “pride of birth will be like a tall hill, constituting a military position between her and me. There’s where we’ll have to maneuver. I was very wrong to stay in Paris: putting off my departure is detrimental, and it leaves me vulnerable, if all this is indeed merely a game. What risk was there in going away? I’d be making fools of them, if they were making a fool of me. If she’s really interested in me, I’d be heightening it a hundredfold.”","“In the battle for which we are preparing,” he added, “pride of birth will be like a high hill which constitutes a military position between her and me. That must be the field of the manœuvres. I made a great mistake in staying in Paris; this postponing of my departure cheapens and exposes me, if all this is simply a trick. What danger was there in leaving? If they were making fun of me, I was making fun of them. If her interest for me was in any way real, I was making that interest a hundred times more intense.”"

"Julien savait la place qui, d’après la disposition des lumières, convenait au genre de beauté de Mme de Fervaques. Il s’y trouvait d’avance, mais avait grand soin de tourner sa chaise de façon à ne pas apercevoir Mathilde. Étonnée de cette constance à se cacher d’elle un jour elle quitta le canapé bleu et vint travailler auprès d’une petite table voisine du fauteuil de la maréchale. Julien la voyait d’assez près par-dessous le chapeau de Mme de Fervaques. Ces yeux, qui disposaient de son sort, l’effrayèrent d’abord, aperçus de si près, ensuite le jetèrent violemment hors de son apathie habituelle, il parla et fort bien.","Julien knew the place which, from the arrangement of the lights, suited Madame de Fervaques' type of beauty. He was there beforehand, but took great care to turn his chair so as not to see Mathilde. Surprised at this constancy in hiding from her one day, she left the blue sofa and went to work at a small table near the marshal's chair. Julien could see her pretty close under Madame de Fervaques's hat. Those eyes, which disposed of his fate, frightened him at first, seen so close, then threw him violently out of his habitual apathy, he spoke, and very well.","Julien understood the exact spot where, because of the lighting arrangements, Madame de Fervaques’s sort of beauty shone the most brilliantly. He would post himself there, in advance, but taking considerable pains to face so he could not see Mathilde. Stunned by his persistence in hiding from her, she abandoned the blue sofa, one day, and took her needlework to a small table near the armchair beside which he was posted. Julien saw how near she’d come, looking out from under Madame de Fervaques’s hat. Seeing those eyes, which held the key to his fate, was initially frightening. But then he wrenched himself out of his usual apathy and spoke extremely well.","Julien knew the place where the arrangement of the light suited Madame de Fervaques’ particular style of beauty.

"Aucun regret, aucun reproche ne vinrent gâter cette nuit qui sembla singulière plutôt qu’heureuse à Julien. Quelle différence, grand Dieu! avec son dernier séjour de vingt-quatre heures à Verrières!

Great heavens! what a difference to his last twenty-four hours’ stay in Verrières. These fine Paris manners manage to spoil everything, even love, he said to himself, quite unjustly."
"Quelques raisonnements qu’il se fît, Julien se trouva attendri comme un être pusillanime, et par conséquent malheureux de cette visite.","Whatever reasoning he formed, Julien found himself softened like a pusillanimous being, and consequently unhappy at this visit.","But whatever arguments he set forth, Julien felt himself full of pity, like some chicken-livered fellow, and so was made miserable by the visit.","In spite of all his argumentation, Julien felt as touched as any weak-minded person would have been, and consequently felt unhappy as the result of the visit."

"Mais, au milieu de cette prospérité, M. Valenod avait besoin de se rassurer, par de petites insolences de détail contre les grosses vérités qu’il sentait bien que tout le monde était en droit de lui adresser. Son activité avait redoublé depuis les craintes que lui avait laissées la visite de M. Appert; il avait fait trois voyages à Besançon; il écrivait plusieurs lettres chaque courrier; il en envoyait d’autres par des inconnus qui passaient chez lui à la tombée de la nuit. Il avait eu tort peut-être de faire destituer le vieux curé Chélan; car cette démarche vindicative l’avait fait regarder, par plusieurs dévotes de bonne naissance, comme un homme profondément méchant. D’ailleurs ce service rendu l’avait mis dans la dépendance absolue de M. le grand vicaire de Frilair, et il en recevait d’étranges commissions. Sa politique en était à ce point, lorsqu’il céda au plaisir d’écrire une lettre anonyme. Pour surcroît d’embarras sa femme lui déclara qu’elle voulait avoir Julien chez elle; sa vanité s’en était coiffée.","But, in the midst of this prosperity, M. Valenod needed to reassure himself, by small insolences of detail against the gross truths which he felt that everyone had the right to address to him. His activity had redoubled since the fears left in him by M. Appert's visit; he had made three trips to Besançon; he wrote several letters each post; he sent others by strangers who passed by his house at nightfall. He had perhaps been wrong to have the old Curé Chelan dismissed; for this vindictive step had caused him to be regarded by several devotees of good birth as a profoundly wicked man. Besides, this service rendered had placed him in absolute dependence on the vicar general of Frilair, and he received strange commissions from him. His politics had reached this point when he yielded to the pleasure of writing an anonymous letter. To add to his embarrassment, his wife told him that she wanted to have Julien at home; his vanity was covered with it.","Yet in the middle of all his prosperity, Monsieur Valenod felt the need to bolster his confidence by tiny, trivial acts of haughtiness, directed against the coarse truths he knew, quite well indeed, the whole world had the right to address to him. His activity had sharply multiplied since the fears he’d experienced, following Monsieur Appert’s visit. He’d made three trips to Besançon; every courier who’d ridden out of town carried letters from him; he’d sent others by the hands of people, known to no one, who came to his house when darkness fell. He had perhaps been wrong to take old Father Chélan’s office from him, for that vindictive proceeding had made him seem, to several devout people of good birth and breeding, a profoundly evil man. In addition, the clerical assistance rendered him, in this matter, left him absolutely dependent on the vicar-general, Monsieur de Frilair, and he’d already been asked to do some strange things. His political standing had reached this point when, indulging his personal pleasure, he wrote an anonymous letter. Even worse, his wife told him she wanted Julien to dine with them, a notion vanity had put into her head.","But in the middle of all this prosperity M. Valenod found it necessary to reassure himself by a number of petty acts of insolence on the score of the crude truths which he well realised that everybody was justified in addressing to him. His activity had redoubled since the fears which the visit of M. Appert had left him. He had made three journeys to Besançon. He wrote several letters by each courier; he sent others by unknown men who came to his house at nightfall. Perhaps he had been wrong in securing the dismissal of the old curé Chélan. For this piece of vindictiveness had resulted in his being considered an extremely malicious man by several pious women of good birth. Besides, the rendering of this service had placed him in absolute dependence on M. the Grand Vicar de Frilair from whom he received some strange commissions. He had reached this point in his intrigues when he had yielded to the pleasure of writing an anonymous letter, and thus increasing his embarrassment. His wife declared to him that she wanted to have Julien in her house; her vanity was intoxicated with the idea."
"Une heure après, Julien vit l’afficheur qui emportait ce gros paquet; il le suivit avec empressement. Je vais savoir le secret au premier coin de rue.","An hour later, Julien saw the bill-poster carrying away this large package; he followed him eagerly. I will know the secret around the first corner.","An hour later, the bill poster came and carried off the large package. Julien hurriedly followed after him. “At the very first street corner, I’m going to know the secret.”",An hour afterwards Julien saw the bill-poster carrying the big parcel. He followed him eagerly. “I shall learn the secret at the first street corner.”
"Ce serait un Danton! ajouta-t-elle après une longue et indistincte rêverie. Eh bien! la révolution aurait recommencé. Quels rôles joueraient alors Croisenois et mon frère? Il est écrit d’avance: La résignation sublime. Ce seraient des moutons héroïques, se laissant égorger sans mot dire. Leur seule peur en mourant serait encore d’être de mauvais goût. Mon petit Julien brûlerait la cervelle au jacobin qui viendrait l’arrêter, pour peu qu’il eût l’espérance de se sauver. Il n’a pas peur d’être de mauvais goût, lui.","It would be a Danton! she added after a long and indistinct reverie. Well! the revolution would have started again. What roles would Croisenois and my brother then play? It is written beforehand: Sublime resignation. They would be heroic sheep, allowing themselves to be slaughtered without saying a word. Their only fear in dying would still be to be in bad taste. My little Julien would burn the brains out of the Jacobin who came to arrest him, provided he had the slightest hope of saving himself. He's not afraid of being in bad taste.","“He’ll be a Danton!” she added, after a long, vague reverie. “Well! So the Revolution starts up again. What roles will Croisenois and my brother be playing? It’s been written out in advance: sublime resignation. They’ll be heroic sheep, they’ll let themselves be swallowed up without a word. Their only fear, as they die, will still be to do everything in good taste. My little Julien would blow out the brains of the Jacobin who comes to arrest him, no matter how small his hope of getting away. He’s not afraid of being in bad taste, not him.”","“He must be a Danton! she added after a long and vague reverie. Well, suppose the revolution begins again, what figures will Croisenois and my brother cut then? It is settled in advance: Sublime resignation. They will be heroic sheep who will allow their throats to be cut without saying a word. Their one fear when they die will still be the fear of being in bad form. If a Jacobin came to arrest my little Julien he would blow his brains out, however small a chance he had of escaping. He is not frightened of doing anything in bad form.”"

"Par bonheur Julien se fermait à clef dans sa chambre. Mme de Rênal eut la folle idée que cet avertissement n’était qu’un prétexte pour ne pas la voir. Elle perdit la tête absolument, et à l’heure ordinaire vint à sa porte. Julien qui entendit du bruit dans le corridor souffla sa lampe à l’instant. On faisait des efforts pour ouvrir sa porte était-ce Mme de Rênal était-ce un mari jaloux?","Luckily Julien locked himself in his room.

"Mais quoi! s’écriait-il tout à coup en marchant d’un pas convulsif; souffrirai-je comme si j’étais un homme de rien, un va-nu-pieds, quelle se moque de moi avec son amant? Faudra-t-il que tout Verrières fasse des gorges chaudes sur ma débonnaireté? Que n’a-t-on pas dit de Charmier (c’était un mari notoirement trompé du pays)? Quand on le nomme, le sourire n’est-il pas sur toutes les lèvres? Il est bon avocat, qui est-ce qui parle jamais de son talent pour la parole? Ah, Charmier, dit-on! le Charmier de Bernard, on le désigne ainsi le nom de l’homme qui fait son opprobre.","But what! he exclaimed suddenly, walking with a convulsive step; Will I suffer as if I were a nobody, a tramp, who laughs at me with her lover? Will all of Verrières have to gloat over my good-naturedness? What has not been said of Charmier (he was a notoriously deceived husband in the country)? When we name him, isn't a smile on everyone's lips? He is a good lawyer, who ever speaks of his talent for speech? Ah, Charmier, they say! Bernard's Charmier, it is thus designated the name of the man who makes him opprobrium.","“What’s going on here?” he suddenly exclaimed, while walking wildly up and down. “Why should I let her, and her lover, laugh at me as if I were a nobody, some barefoot beggar? Should everyone in Verrières be gloating at how good-natured I am? What haven’t they said about Charmier (who was a local fellow, a notorious cuckold)? As soon as they hear his name, doesn’t everybody start grinning? He’s a fine lawyer: Whoever says anything about the speeches he makes? ‘Ho, Charmier!’ they say, ‘Barnard’s Charmier’—which is what they call him, since that’s the name of the other fellow, the man who’s disgracing him.”","“How many calumniated women has one not seen?” “But,” he suddenly exclaimed, as he walked about feverishly, “shall I put up with her making a fool of me with her lover as though I were a man of no account, some mere ragamuffin? Is all Verrières to make merry over my complaisance? What have they not said about Charmier (he was a husband in the district who was notoriously deceived)? Was there not a smile on every lip at the mention of his name? He is a good advocate, but whoever said anything about his talent for speaking? ‘Oh, Charmier,’ they say, ‘ Bernard’s Charmier,’ he is thus designated by the name of the man who disgraces him.”"
"Il se sentit défaillir quand, arrivé au bureau des malles-poste, on lui apprit que, par un hasard singulier, il y avait une place dès le lendemain dans la malle de Toulouse. Il l’arrêta et revint à l’hôtel de La Mole, annoncer son départ au marquis.","He felt faint when, arriving at the post office, he was told that, by a singular coincidence, there was a place the next day in the Toulouse mail box. He stopped her and returned to the Hôtel de La Mole to announce his departure to the marquis.","He felt faint when, arriving at the mail-coach office, he found that by a strange coincidence there was an available seat, for the next day, in the coach going to Toulouse, the capital of Languedoc.

"— Figurez-vous, mon ami, disait l’abbé Chas, en s’arrêtant tout court, et ouvrant de grands yeux, que ces étoffes se tiennent droites tant il y a d’or. C’est l’opinion commune de tous les honnêtes gens de Besançon que, par le testament de la présidente, le trésor de la cathédrale sera augmenté de plus de dix chasubles, sans compter quatre ou cinq chapes pour les grandes fêtes. Je vais plus foin, ajoutait l’abbé Chas en baissant la voix, j’ai des raisons pour penser que la présidente nous laissera huit magnifiques flambeaux d’argent doré, que l’on suppose avoir été achetés en Italie, par le duc de Bourgogne Charles le Téméraire, dont un de ses ancêtres fut le ministre favori.","“Just imagine, my friend,” said the Abbé Chas, stopping short and opening his eyes wide, “that these stuffs stand up straight, so much gold is there. It is the common opinion of all the honest people of Besançon that, by the will of the president, the treasury of the cathedral will be increased by more than ten chasubles, without counting four or five copes for the great feasts. I'm going further, added Abbé Chas, lowering his voice, I have reason to think that the President will leave us eight magnificent candlesticks of gilded silver, which are supposed to have been bought in Italy, by the Duke of Bourgogne Charles le Téméraire, of whom one of his ancestors was the favorite minister.","It was universally believed, in Besançon, that by the terms of the president’s will the cathedral’s treasures would be enriched by more than ten chasubles, not counting four or five long mantles for high festivals. “I’d go even further,” added Father Chas, lowering his voice. “I have reason to believe the president left us eight magnificent candlesticks, of gilded silver, which are said to have been bought in Italy by Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, a favorite minister of whose was one of the president’s ancestors.” “But what’s he after, with all this old-clothes stuff?”","“Imagine, my friend,” the Abbé Chas would say, stopping abruptly, and staring with amazement, “that this material keeps quite stiff. There is so much gold in it. It is generally thought in Besançon that the will of the judge’s wife will result in the cathedral treasure being increased by more than ten chasubles, without counting four or five capes for the great feast. I will go further,” said the Abbé Chas, lowering his voice, “I have reasons for thinking the judge’s wife will leave us her magnificent silver gilt candlesticks, supposed to have been bought in Italy by Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, whose favourite minister was one of the good lady’s ancestors.”"

"Peu de jours après ce monologue, le quinzième régiment de hussards, l’un des plus brillants de l’armée, était en bataille sur la place d’armes de Strasbourg.

"Une pensée vint frapper Julien comme une découverte interrompre l’examen qu’il faisait de la lettre de Mathilde, et redoubler sa joie.

"— Le geôlier, lui dit-elle en rougissant beaucoup, est un homme cruel. Sans doute il va le maltraiter, croyant en cela faire une chose agréable pour moi… Cette idée m’est insupportable.

"A l’époque des examens, il y a avait deux mois peut-être qu’il n’avait parlé à Julien, et cependant il fut malade pendant huit jours, quand, en recevant la lettre officielle annonçant le résultat du concours, il vit le numéro 198 placé à côté du nom de cet élève qu’il regardait comme la gloire de sa maison.

He was thrilled when he discovered no anger in the young man, no plan for revenge, no discouragement.","At the time of the examinations, it was perhaps nearly two months since he had spoken to Julien, and nevertheless, he was ill for eight days when, on receipt of the official letter announcing the result of the competition, he saw the number 198 placed beside the name of that pupil whom he regarded as the glory of his town. This stern character found his only consolation in concentrating all his surveillance on Julien. He was delighted that he discovered in him neither anger, nor vindictiveness, nor discouragement."
"Si, avec sa pauvreté, Julien était noble, mon amour ne serait qu’une sottise vulgaire, une mésalliance plate; je n’en voudrais pas; il n’aurait point ce qui caractérise les grandes passions: l’immensité de la difficulté à vaincre et la noire incertitude de l’événement.","If, with his poverty, Julien were noble, my love would be nothing but vulgar folly, a flat misalliance; I wouldn't want it; he would not have what characterizes great passions: the immensity of the difficulty to be overcome and the dark uncertainty of the event.","“If Julien were noble, poor as he is, my love would be nothing but vulgar stupidity, an act of out-and-out miscegenation. I want nothing of the kind; it would have none of the qualities of a grand passion, none of the immense difficulties to be conquered, and the black uncertainty of what might come.”","“If Julien were noble as well as poor, my love would simply be a vulgar piece of stupidity, a sheer mésalliance; I would have nothing to do with it; it would be absolutely devoid of the characteristic traits of grand passion—the immensity of the difficulty to be overcome and the black uncertainty of the result.”"

"Le soir, à peine sortie de la prison, elle fit venir chez sa tante le prêtre qui s’était attaché à Julien comme à une proie, comme il ne voulait que se mettre en crédit auprès des jeunes femmes appartenant à la haute société de Besançon, Mme de Rênal l’engagea facilement à aller faire une neuvaine à l’abbaye de Bray-le-Haut.","In the evening, barely out of prison, she summoned to her aunt the priest who had attached himself to Julien as if to prey, as he only wanted to put himself in credit with the young women belonging to the high society of Besançon. , Madame de Rênal easily got him to go and make a novena at the abbey of Bray-le-Haut.","That evening, as soon as she’d left the prison and gone back to her aunt’s house, she summoned the priest who, like a hunting animal, had fastened himself onto Julien.

"Si Julien eût employé à examiner ce qui se passait dans le salon le temps qu’il mettait à s’exagérer la beauté de Mathilde, ou à se passionner contre la hauteur naturelle à sa famille, qu’elle oubliait pour lui, il eût compris en quoi consistait son empire sur tout ce qui l’entourait.

Bit by bit, she would become increasingly destructive of the offending party’s self-esteem. Since she had absolutely no interest in most of the things so very seriously sought by the rest of the family, to them she seemed forever cool and calm.","If Julien had employed the time which he spent in exaggerating Mathilde’s beauty or in working himself up into a rage against that family haughtiness which she was forgetting for his sake in examining what was going on in the salon, he would have understood the secret of her dominion over all that surrounded her.

Un mari qui se plaint se couvre de ridicule, chose tous les jours moins dangereuse en France; mais sa femme, s’il ne lui donne pas d’argent, tombe à l’état d’ouvrière à quinze sols par journée; et encore les bonnes âmes se font-elles un scrupule de l’employer.","Once or twice, during this great scene, Madame de Rênal was on the point of feeling some sympathy for the very real misfortune of this man who for twelve years had been her friend. But true passions are selfish. Besides, she was constantly expecting the acknowledgment of the anonymous letter he had received the day before, and this acknowledgment did not come. It was wanting to Madame de Rênal's security to know the ideas that might have been suggested to the man on whom her fate depended. Because, in the provinces, husbands are masters of public opinion. A husband who complains covers himself with ridicule, a less dangerous thing every day in France; but his wife, if he does not give her money, becomes a worker at fifteen sols a day; and even good souls make a scruple of employing it.","Once or twice, during this great scene, Madame de Rênal was close to some degree of compassion, on account of the man’s very real misery: he had been close to her for twelve years. But genuine passion is egotistic. Besides, from minute to minute she’d been waiting for him to acknowledge last night’s anonymous letter, and there had been no such acknowledgment. Madame de Rênal’s safety was not certain, lacking information about what ideas might have been suggested to this man, on whom her fate depended. In the countryside, of course, husbands are in charge of opinion. A moaning and groaning husband covers himself with ridicule (though from day to day this becomes less of a risk, in France), but his wife, if he refuses her money, lapses into the condition of a workman making fifteen cents a day, and respectable people are not always willing to hire her.","Madame de Rênal was on the point once or twice during this great scene of feeling some sympathy for the very real unhappiness of the man who had been so dear to her for twelve years. But true passions are selfish. Besides she was expecting him every instant to mention the anonymous letter which he had received the day before and he did not mention it. In order to feel quite safe, Madame de Rênal wanted to know the ideas which the letter had succeeded in suggesting to the man on whom her fate depended, for, in the provinces the husbands are the masters of public opinion. A husband who complains covers himself with ridicule, an inconvenience which becomes no less dangerous in France with each succeeding year; but if he refuses to provide his wife with money, she falls to the status of a labouring woman at fifteen sous a day, while the virtuous souls have scruples about employing her."

"Julien la serra dans ses bras avec la plus vive passion; jamais elle ne lui avait semblé si belle. Même à Paris, se disait-il confusément je ne pourrai rencontrer un plus grand caractère. Elle avait toute la gaucherie d’une femme peu accoutumée à ces sortes de soins, et en même temps le vrai courage d’un être qui ne craint que des dangers d’un autre ordre et bien autrement terribles.","Julien hugged her with the liveliest passion; she had never seemed so beautiful to him. Even in Paris, he said to himself confusedly, I could not meet a greater character. She had all the awkwardness of a woman unaccustomed to this kind of care, and at the same time the real courage of a being who fears only dangers of another order and far more terrible.","Julien took her in his arms with the liveliest passion: she had never seemed so beautiful. “Even in Paris,” he told himself, more than a little bewildered, “I’ll never find anyone with such a noble heart.” She had all the awkwardness of a woman not accustomed to waiting on others, and at the same time the true courage of someone who feared only perils of a very different sort, and very much more terrible.","Julien clasped her in his arms with the most lively passion. She had never seemed to him so beautiful. “I could not meet a woman of greater character even at Paris,” he said confusedly to himself. She combined all the clumsiness of a woman who was but little accustomed to paying attentions of this kind, with all the genuine courage of a person who is only afraid of dangers of quite a different sphere and quite a different kind of awfulness."

"— Enfin, elle est réparée. Monfleury est en vente, je perds cinquante mille francs, s’il le faut, mais je suis tout joyeux, je quitte cet enfer d’hypocrisie et de tracasseries. Je vais chercher la solitude et la paix champêtre au seul lieu où elles existent en France, dans un quatrième étage donnant sur les Champs-Élysées. Et encore j’en suis à délibérer, si je ne commencerai pas ma carrière politique, dans le quartier du Roule, par rendre le pain bénit à la paroisse.","“Finally, it's fixed. Monfleury is on sale, I lose fifty thousand francs, if necessary, but I am very happy, I am leaving this hell of hypocrisy and hassle. I seek solitude and rural peace in the only place where they exist in France, on a fourth floor overlooking the Champs-Élysées. And I am still deliberating whether I will not begin my political career, in the Roule district, by returning the blessed bread to the parish.","Oh, how offensive . . .” “I’ve finally taken care of that. My château is for sale, I’ll lose fifty thousand francs, if I have to, but I’ll be overjoyed: I’m getting out of that inferno of hypocrisy and petty troublemaking. I propose to look for the peace and solitude of the countryside in the only place in France where those things can be found, a fourth-floor apartment overlooking the Champs-Elysées. But I’m still wondering if, perhaps, I won’t begin my political career in Paris, selling consecrated bread to a neighborhood parish.”","“It is rectified at last. Monfleury is for sale. I will lose 50,000 francs if necessary, but I am over-joyed I am leaving that hell of hypocrisy and annoyance. I am going to look for solitude and rustic peace in the only place where those things are to be found in France, on a fourth storey looking on to the Champs-Elysées; and, moreover, I am actually deliberating if I shall not commence my political career by giving consecrated bread to the parish in the Roule quarter.”"
"Dans les jours de méfiance: Cette jeune fille se moque de moi, pensait Julien. Elle est d’accord avec son frère pour me mystifier. Mais elle a l’air de tellement mépriser le manque d’énergie de ce frère! Il est brave, et puis c’est tout, me dit-elle. Et encore, brave devant l’épée des Espagnols. A Paris tout lui fait peur, il voit partout le danger du ridicule. Il n’a pas une pensée qui ose s’écarter de la mode. C’est toujours moi qui suis obligé de prendre sa défense. Une jeune fille de dix-neuf ans! A cet âge peut-on être fidèle à chaque instant de la journée à l’hypocrisie qu’on s’est prescrite?","In the days of mistrust: This young girl is making fun of me, thought Julien. She agrees with her brother to mystify me. But she seems to despise this brother's lack of energy so much! He's brave, and that's all, she told me. And again, brave before the sword of the Spaniards. Everything in Paris frightens him, he sees everywhere the danger of ridicule. He does not have a thought that dares to deviate from fashion. It is always me who is obliged to defend him. A nineteen-year-old girl! At this age can one be faithful at every moment of the day to the hypocrisy that one has prescribed for oneself?","When he fell victim to mistrust: “She’s making fun of me, that girl,” Julien would think. “She and her brother have made a pact to bamboozle me. But she really seems to despise her brother’s listlessness! ‘He’s courageous, and that’s all he is,’ she told me. ‘He hasn’t got a single thought bold enough to defy fashion! I am always required to defend him. I’m a girl, I’m only nineteen! How can I be forever faithful, day after day, to the hypocrisy they demand of us?’","“That young girl is making fun of me,” Julien would think in his suspicious days. “She is acting in concert with her brother to make a fool of me. But she seems to have an absolute contempt for her brother’s lack of energy. He is brave and that is all. He has not a thought which dares to deviate from the conventional. It is always I who have to take up the cudgels in his defence. A young girl of nineteen! Can one at that age act up faithfully every second of the day to the part which one has determined to play?"
"Elle monta au second étage du château pâle comme si elle fût allée à la mort. Pour comble de misère, elle sentit qu’elle était sur le point de se trouver mal; mais la nécessité de rendre service à Julien lui rendit des forces.","She went up to the second floor of the pale castle as if she had gone to her death. To crown her misery, she felt that she was on the point of fainting; but the necessity of rendering a service to Julien gave him strength.","She climbed to the château’s second floor, as pale as if she were walking to her death. To add to her misery, she felt she was on the point of becoming ill, but having to be of service to Julien gave her strength.","She ascended the second storey of the château as pale as though she had been going to her death. Her misery was completed by the sensation that she was on the verge of falling ill, but the necessity of doing Julien a service restored her strength."
"— Il faut, dit-elle le soir à Julien d’un air fort sec, que vous m’apportiez des enveloppes sur lesquelles il y aura votre adresse.","""You must,"" she said to Julien in the evening very dryly, ""you must bring me some envelopes with your address on them.""","“It will be necessary,” she said to Julien that evening, very wryly, “for you to bring me some envelopes bearing your address.”","“You must bring me envelopes with your address on,” she said very drily to Julien in the evening."

"— Non, vous êtes seulement plus amoureux que je ne le croyais. Mme de Dubois est profondément occupée d’elle-même, comme toutes les femmes qui ont reçu du ciel ou trop de noblesse ou trop d’argent. Elle se regarde au lieu de vous regarder, donc elle ne vous connaît pas. Pendant les deux ou trois accès d’amour qu’elle s’est donnés en votre faveur, à grand effort d’imagination, elle voyait en vous le héros qu’elle avait rêvé, et non pas ce que vous êtes réellement.","“No, you're just more in love than I thought.

Madame de Dubois is profoundly concerned with herself, like all the women blessed by heaven either with an excess of nobility, or an excess of money. She thinks about herself instead of thinking about you, and so she knows nothing about you. During the two or three small fits of love she’s granted you, she made a huge imaginative effort to see in you the hero she’s always dreamed of, not you as you actually are.","“No, you are only more in love than I thought. Madame de Dubois is preoccupied with herself as are all women who have been favoured by heaven either with too much pedigree or too much money.

"Toutefois, que de conversions ont ainsi commencé! Ce qui me fait bien augurer de celle-ci, c’est la différence de son style avec celui des jeunes gens dont j’ai eu l’occasion de voir les lettres.

It is impossible not to recognize the anointing, a deep seriousness and a lot of conviction in the prose of this young Levite, he will have the doubtful virtue of Massillon.","“All the same, how often conversions begin this way! What makes me expect good things from this one is how differently he writes, compared to the other young men whose letters I’ve come upon. It’s impossible not to see spirituality, and deep seriousness and profound conviction, in this young ecclesiastic’s prose. He will become a master of sweet virtue, like Massillon himself.”","“Nevertheless how many conversions have begun like that! What makes me consider this a good omen is the difference between his style and that of the young people whose letters I have had an opportunity of seeing.

"Julien trouva le marquis furieux: pour la première fois de sa vie, peut-être, ce seigneur fut de mauvais ton; il accabla Julien de toutes les injures qui lui vinrent à la bouche.

"Mourir ainsi, mais non de ma main, ce n’est point un péché, pensait Mme de Rênal. Dieu me pardonnera peut-être de me réjouir de ma mort.

"C’était Mme de Rênal, qui avait fait un voyage à la ville, et qui, montant les escaliers quatre à quatre, et laissant ses enfants occupés d’un lapin favori qui était du voyage, était parvenue à la chambre de Julien un instant avant eux. Ce moment fut délicieux, mais bien court: Mme de Rênal avait disparu quand les enfants arrivèrent avec le lapin, qu’ils voulaient montrer à leur ami. Julien fit bon accueil à tous même au lapin. Il lui semblait retrouver sa famille, il sentit qu’il aimait ces enfants qu’il se plaisait à jaser avec eux. Il était étonné de là douceur de leur voix, de la simplicité et de la noblesse de leurs petites façons, il avait besoin de laver son imagination de toutes les façons d’agir vulgaires, de toutes les pensées désagréables au milieu desquelles il respirait à Verrières. C était toujours la crainte de manquer, c’étaient toujours le luxe et la misère se prenant aux cheveux.

Julien welcomed everyone, even the rabbit. It seemed to him to find his family, he felt that he loved these children that he enjoyed chatting with them. He was amazed at the sweetness of their voices, at the simplicity and nobility of their little ways, he needed to cleanse his imagination of all the vulgar ways of acting, of all the disagreeable thoughts in the midst of which he breathed at Verrières. . It was always the fear of missing out, it was always luxury and misery getting caught in the hair. The people with whom he dined, in connection with their roast, made confidences humiliating for them, and nauseating for those who heard them.","It was Madame de Rênal, who had come into town and, climbing the stairs four at a time, leaving her children busy with a pet rabbit they’d taken on their trip, had reached Julien’s room moments before they could.

"Combien de fois, songeant aux bals de Paris abandonnés la veille, et la poitrine appuyée contre ces grands blocs de pierre d’un beau gris tirant sur le bleu, mes regards ont plongé dans la vallée du Doubs! Au-delà, sur la rive gauche, serpentent cinq ou six vallées au fond desquelles l’oeil distingue fort bien de petits ruisseaux. Après avoir couru de cascade en cascade, on les voit tomber dans le Doubs. Le soleil est fort chaud dans ces montagnes; lorsqu’il brille d’aplomb, la rêverie du voyageur est abritée sur cette terrasse par de magnifiques platanes. Leur croissance rapide et leur belle verdure tirant sur le bleu, ils la doivent à la terre rapportée, que M. le maire a fait placer derrière son immense mur de soutènement, car, malgré l’opposition du conseil municipal, il a élargi la promenade de plus de six pieds (quoiqu’il soit ultra et moi libéral, je l’en loue); c’est pourquoi dans son opinion et dans celle de M. Valenod, l’heureux directeur du dépôt de mendicité de Verrières, cette terrasse peut soutenir la comparaison avec celle de Saint-Germain-en-Laye.","How many times, thinking of the balls in Paris abandoned the day before, and leaning my chest against these large blocks of stone of a beautiful gray verging on blue, have my eyes plunged into the Doubs valley! Beyond, on the left bank, meander five or six valleys at the bottom of which the eye can easily distinguish small streams. After running from waterfall to waterfall, we see them fall into the Doubs. The sun is very hot in these mountains; when it shines brightly, the traveller's reverie is sheltered on this terrace by magnificent plane trees. Their rapid growth and their beautiful blue-tinged greenery are due to the brought back earth, which the mayor had placed behind his immense retaining wall, because, despite the opposition of the municipal council, he widened the promenade more than six feet (although he is ultra and I liberal, I praise him); this is why in his opinion and that of Mr. Valenod, the happy director of the Verrières begging depot, this terrace can bear comparison with that of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.","How many times, dreaming about Parisian balls long left behind, with my chest pressed against those great blocks of stone—a lovely gray streaked with blue—has my glance plunged down into the valley through which the Doubs runs! Out there, along the left bank, five or six valleys go meandering, the eye easily able to distinguish small streams tumbling through them. Having splashed through one waterfall after another, one sees them pouring into the Doubs. The sun is powerful, in these mountains: when it shines directly overhead, a traveler’s daydreaming, as he stands on this raised earthwork, is sheltered by magnificent plane trees. They owe their rapid growth, as well as their beautiful foliage, green tinted with blue, to the earth brought by the mayor and deposited behind his huge retaining wall, for in spite of the Municipal Council’s opposition, he had enlarged the walkway by more than six feet— I commend him for this, although he is a monarchist and I a liberal—and indeed that is why, in his opinion and that of Monsieur Valenod, the fortunate director of the Pauper’s Bureau in Verrières, this raised earthwork can bear comparison to that of Paris’s Saint-Germain-en-Laye.","How many times have my looks plunged into the valley of the Doubs, as I thought of the Paris balls which I had abandoned on the previous night, and leant my breast against the great blocks of stone, whose beautiful grey almost verged on blue. Beyond the left bank, there wind five or six valleys, at the bottom of which I could see quite distinctly several small streams. There is a view of them falling into the Doubs, after a series of cascades. The sun is very warm in these mountains. When it beats straight down, the pensive traveller on the terrace finds shelter under some magnificent plane trees. They owe their rapid growth and their fine verdure with its almost bluish shade to the new soil, which M. the mayor has had placed behind his immense wall of support for (in spite of the opposition of the Municipal Council) he has enlarged the promenade by more than six feet (and although he is an Ultra and I am a Liberal, I praise him for it), and that is why both in his opinion and in that of M. Valenod, the fortunate Director of the workhouse of Verrières, this terrace can brook comparison with that of Saint-Germain en Laye."

"M. de Rênal avait ordonné à Julien de loger chez lui. Personne ne soupçonna ce qui s’était passé. Le troisième jour après son arrivée, Julien vit monter jusque dans sa chambre un non moindre personnage que M. le sous-préfet de Maugiron. Cc ne tut qu’après doux grandes heures de bavardage insipide et de grandes jérémiades sur la méchanceté des hommes, sur le peu de probité des gens chargés de l’administration des deniers publics, sur les dangers de cette pauvre France, etc., etc., que Julien vit poindre enfin le sujet de la visite. On était déjà sur le palier de l’escalier, et le pauvre précepteur à demi disgracié reconduisait avec le respect convenable le futur préfet de quelque heureux département, quand il plut à celui-ci de s’occuper de la fortune de Julien, de louer sa modération en affaires d’intérêt, etc., etc. Enfin M. de Maugiron le serrant dans ses bras de l’air le plus paterne lui proposa de quitter M. de Rênal et d’entrer chez un fonctionnaire qui avait des enfants à éduquer, et qui, comme le roi Philippe, remercierait le ciel, non pas tant de les lui avoir donnés que de les avoir fait naître dans le voisinage de M. Julien. Leur précepteur jouirait de huit cents francs d’appointements payables non pas de mois en mois, ce qui n’est pas noble, dit M. de Maugiron, mais par quartier, et toujours d’avance.","M. de Rênal had ordered Julien to lodge with him. No one suspected what had happened. On the third day after his arrival, Julien saw going up to his room a personage no less than the sub-prefect of Maugiron. Cc was silent only after sweet long hours of insipid chatter and great jeremiads on the wickedness of men, on the lack of probity of the people in charge of the administration of public funds, on the dangers of this poor France, etc., etc. ., that Julien saw finally dawn the subject of the visit. They were already on the landing of the stairs, and the poor, half-disgraced tutor was escorting the future prefect of some happy department with due respect, when it pleased the latter to concern himself with Julien's fortune, to rent his moderation in matters of interest, etc., etc. Finally, M. de Maugiron, hugging him with the most paternal air, suggested that he leave M. de Rênal and go to an official who had children to educate, and who, like King Philippe, would thank Heaven. , not so much for having given them to him as for having caused them to be born in the vicinity of M. Julien. Their tutor would enjoy a salary of eight hundred francs payable not from month to month, which is not noble, says M. de Maugiron, but by district, and always in advance.","Monsieur de Rênal had directed Julien to live in the Rênals’ Verrières house. No one had any idea what had happened. On the third day after his arrival, Julien was visited in his room by no less a personage than Monsieur de Maugiron, the deputy governor of the district. Only after two long hours of insipid verbiage, and jeremiads about the wickedness of human beings, the dishonesty of those in charge of the public treasury, the dangers facing our poor France, etc., etc., was Julien able to catch a glimpse of the point to this visit. They’d already gotten to the staircase landing, and the poor, half-disgraced tutor was in the process of saying farewell, with all proper signs of respect, when the future governor of some lucky district was pleased to concern himself with Julien’s well-being, praising his moderation in matters that affected his own self-interest, etc., etc. Finally, embracing Julien in the most fatherly way, he suggested to him that he depart from Monsieur de Rênal’s service, and make his entrance into the household of a civil servant who had children to educate and who, like King Philip, thanked heaven not simply for giving them to him but also for having brought them into a neighborhood where Monsieur Julien dwelled.

"Ce contretemps augmenta son agitation. Elle était dévorée d’un remords. Elle avait tant grondé Julien de l’imprudence qu’il avait faite en venant chez elle la nuit précédente, qu’elle tremblait qu’il ne vînt pas celle-ci. Elle quitta le jardin de bonne heure, et alla s’établir dans sa chambre. Mais ne tenant pas à son impatience, elle vint coller son oreille contre la porte de Julien. Malgré l’incertitude et la passion qui la dévoraient, elle n’osa point entrer. Cette action lui semblait la dernière des bassesses, car elle sert de texte à un dicton de province.","This mishap increased his agitation. She was devoured by remorse. She had so scolded Julien for the imprudence he had shown in coming to her house the night before that she was afraid he would not come this one.

That seemed to her the most degrading thing anyone could do (as the provincial proverb puts it).","This hitch increased her agitation. She was devoured by one pang of remorse.

"On ne connaît point les sources du Nil, se disait Julien; il n’a point été donné à l’oeil de l’homme de voir le roi des fleuves dans l’état de simple ruisseau: ainsi aucun oeil humain ne verra Julien faible d’abord parce qu’il ne l’est pas. Mais j’ai le coeur facile à toucher; la parole la plus commune, si elle est dite avec un accent vrai, peut attendrir ma voix et même faire couler mes larmes. Que de fois les coeurs secs ne m’ont-ils pas méprisé pour ce défaut! Ils croyaient que je demandais grâce: voilà ce qu’il ne faut pas souffrir.","We don't know the sources of the Nile, thought Julien; it has not been given to the eye of man to see the king of rivers in the state of a simple stream: thus no human eye will see Julien weak at first because he is not. But my heart is easy to touch; the most common word, if spoken with a true accent, can soften my voice and even make my tears flow. How often have dry hearts despised me for this fault! They thought I was asking for mercy: that's what you shouldn't suffer.","“We have no idea where the Nile begins,” he said to himself. “No human eye has ever been allowed to see the king of rivers as a simple little brook; so, too, no human eye will see Julien weak, first of all because he isn’t. But my heart is easily moved: perfectly ordinary words, if said truly, can affect my voice and even make my tears fall. How many times have dried-out hearts scorned me for this defect! They think I’m begging for mercy—and I can’t endure that.","“The sources of the Nile are unknown,” said Julien to himself: “it has not been vouchsafed to the human eye to see the King of rivers as a simple brook; similarly, no human eye shall see Julien weak. In the first place because he is not so. But I have a heart which it is easy to touch. The most commonplace words, if said in a genuine tone, can make my voice broken and even cause me to shed tears. How often have frigid characters not despised me for this weakness. They thought that I was asking a favour; that is what I cannot put up with."
"Julien étudiait, avec une attention voisine de l’envie les plus grossiers des petits paysans qui arrivaient au séminaire.

"Mme de Rênal, fort timide, et d’un caractère en apparence fort inégal était surtout choquée du mouvement continuel, et des éclats de voix de M. Valenod. L’éloignement qu’elle avait pour ce qu’à Verrières on appelle de la joie, lui avait valu la réputation d’être très fière de sa naissance. Elle n’y songeait pas, mais avait été fort contente de voir les habitants de la ville venir moins chez elle. Nous ne dissimulerons pas qu’elle passait pour sotte aux yeux de leurs dames, parce que sans nulle politique à l’égard de son mari, elle laissait échapper les plus belles occasions de se faire acheter de beaux chapeaux de Paris ou de Besançon. Pourvu qu’on la laissât seule errer dans son beau jardin, elle ne se plaignait jamais.","Madame de Rênal, very shy, and of an apparently very unequal character, was above all shocked by the continual movement and the outbursts of M. Valenod's voice. The estrangement she felt for what in Verrières is called joy had earned her the reputation of being very proud of her birth. She hadn't thought of it, but had been very happy to see the inhabitants of the city coming to her house less. We will not hide the fact that she was considered stupid in the eyes of their ladies, because without any policy towards her husband, she let slip the best opportunities of having beautiful hats bought in Paris or Besançon. Provided she was left to wander alone in her beautiful garden, she never complained.","Madame de Rênal, terribly shy and equally moody, was above all else disturbed at Monsieur Valenod’s incessant moving about, and the blaring of his voice. Her antipathy to what Verrières called pleasure had gotten her a reputation for snobbishness. No such thing had ever crossed her mind, but she’d been perfectly happy to see fewer and fewer townsfolk calling at her house. Nor should we hide the fact that, in the eyes of the town’s ladies, she was an outright fool, since with not the slightest regard for proper management of her husband, she passed over the loveliest opportunities for buying beautiful hats from Paris or Besançon. But if they just let her wander about in her fine garden, she never complained.","Madame de Rênal, who had a very shy, and apparently a very uneven temperament, was particularly shocked by M. Valenod’s lack of repose, and by his boisterous loudness. Her aloofness from what, in the Verrières’ jargon, was called “having a good time,” had earned her the reputation of being very proud of her birth. In fact, she never thought about it, but she had been extremely glad to find the inhabitants of the town visit her less frequently. We shall not deny that she passed for a fool in the eyes of their good ladies because she did not wheedle her husband, and allowed herself to miss the most splendid opportunities of getting fine hats from Paris or Besançon. Provided she was allowed to wander in her beautiful garden, she never complained."
"Je suis en retard! s’écria Julien, car il y a bien longtemps que je vois Mme de Fervaques.

He immediately set about transcribing that first love letter; it was a homily full of sentences on virtue and boring to death; Julien had the good fortune to fall asleep on the second page.","“I’m late!” he exclaimed to himself. “It’s been a very long time since I met Madame de Fervaques.” He quickly set to copying the first letter: it was a sermon, full of virtuous observations, and incredibly boring. He was lucky enough to fall asleep, by the second page.","“I am behind hand,” exclaimed Julien. “It is quite a long time since I met Madame de Fervaques.” He immediately began to copy out this first love letter. It was a homily packed with moral platitudes and deadly dull. Julien was fortunate enough to fall asleep at the second page."

Well, gentlemen, I will be brief.","“You’re pressuring me to be done,” he said angrily, and putting completely aside his smiling politeness, and the measured language that Julien had thought was an expression of his character: “You’re pressuring me to be done, you’re ignoring all the efforts I’ve been making to keep from offending anyone’s ears, no matter how long they may be. So, gentlemen, I will be brief.","“My audience is eager for me to finish,” he said vigorously, completely discarding that smiling politeness and that balanced diction that Julien thought had expressed his character so well. “It is eager for me to finish, it is not grateful to me for the efforts I am making to offend nobody’s ears, however long they may be.

"Le soir, il fit porter à la chapelle du séminaire dix livres de cierges économisés, dit-il, par les soins de Julien, et la rapidité avec laquelle il avait fait éteindre. Rien de moins vrai.

"— Pas de phrases, lui dit-il tout bas comme il allait prendre la parole.","'No sentences,' he said softly to her as he was about to speak.","“No fancy phrases,” Julien directed, as the lawyer prepared to speak.","“No phrases,” he said to him in a whisper, as he was about to commence his speech."
"Mme de Rênal répondit avec une indignation réelle, et nullement exagérée, à l’annonce impertinente que Julien osait lui faire. Il crut voir du mépris dans sa courte réponse. Il est sûr que dans cette réponse, prononcée fort bas, le mot fi donc avait paru. Sous prétexte de quelque chose à dire aux enfants, Julien alla dans leur chambre, et à son retour il se plaça à côté de Mme Derville et fort loin de Mme de Rênal. Il s’ôta ainsi toute possibilité de lui prendre la main. La conversation fut sérieuse, et Julien s’en tira fort bien, à quelques moments de silence près, pendant lesquels il se creusait la cervelle. Que ne puis-je inventer quelque belle manoeuvre, se disait-il, pour forcer Mme de Rênal à me rendre ces marques de tendresse non équivoques qui me faisaient croire il y a trois jours, qu’elle était à moi!","Madame de Rênal replied with real, and in no way exaggerated, indignation to the impertinent announcement which Julien dared to make to her. He thought he saw contempt in her short answer. It is certain that in this answer, pronounced very softly, the word fi therefore had appeared. Under the pretext of something to say to the children, Julien went into their room, and on his return he placed himself next to Madame Derville and very far from Madame de Rênal. He thus deprived himself of any possibility of taking her hand. The conversation was serious, and Julien got off very well, apart from a few moments of silence, during which he racked his brains. Why can't I invent some fine maneuver, he said to himself, to force Madame de Rênal to give me back those unequivocal tokens of tenderness which made me believe three days ago that she was mine!","Madame de Rênal responded to Julien’s rude announcement with genuine indignation, not in the least exaggerated. He thought he could hear a certain scorn in her brief reply. He was positive that, though she spoke very softly, he could make out the words don’t be a fool. Pretending he had something to tell the children, he rose and went to their room, and on his return seated himself next to Madame Derville, as far away from Madame de Rênal as he could get. He thereby relinquished any possibility of taking her hand. They were discussing weighty matters and Julien performed extremely well, aside from intervals of silence during which he sat racking his brain. “Why can’t I devise some fine maneuver,” he asked himself, “and compel Madame de Rênal to show signs of the undoubted affection that, three days ago, she convinced me she truly felt!”","Madame de Rênal answered the impertinent declaration which Julien had dared to make to her with indignation which was real and in no way exaggerated. He thought he could see contempt in her curt reply. The expression “for shame,” had certainly occurred in that whispered answer. Julien went to the children’s room under the pretext of having something to say to them, and on his return he placed himself beside Madame Derville and very far from Madame de Rênal. He thus deprived himself of all possibility of taking her hand. The conversation was serious, and Julien acquitted himself very well, apart from a few moments of silence during which he was cudgelling his brains. “Why can’t I invent some pretty manœuvre,” he said to himself, “which will force Madame de Rênal to vouchsafe to me those unambiguous signs of tenderness which a few days ago made me think that she was mine.”"

"Quand Julien aperçut les ruines pittoresques de l’ancienne église de Vergy, il remarqua que, depuis l’avant-veille, il n’avait pas pensé une seule fois à Mme de Rênal L’autre jour en partant cette femme m’a rappelé là distance infinie qui nous sépare, elle m’a traité comme le fils d’un ouvrier.

Of course, she wanted me to see how much she regretted having given me her hand, the previous night. . . . But still, she’s so pretty—and her hand! What a bewitching thing! And there’s such nobility in her eyes!”","When Julien perceived the picturesque ruins of the old church at Vergy, he noticed that he had not given a single thought to Madame de Rênal since the day before yesterday. “The other day, when I took my leave, that woman made me realise the infinite distance which separates us; she treated me like a labourer’s son. No doubt she wishes to signify her repentance for having allowed me to hold her hand the evening before.... It is, however very pretty, is that hand. What a charm, what a nobility is there in that woman’s expression!”"

"Il y avait de l’intimité dans cette question, et elle revenait en courant et essoufflée pour être avec lui. Julien était las de se mépriser. Par orgueil, il dit franchement sa pensée.

"Enfin le ciel eut pitié de cette mère malheureuse. Peu à peu Stanislas ne fut plus en danger.

"Dans une petite ville de l’Aveyron ou des Pyrénées, le moindre incident eût été rendu décisif par le feu du climat.

Things go very slowly, in the provinces; everything happens naturally, bit by bit.","If the scene had been laid in a small town in Aveyron or the Pyrenees, the slightest episode would have been rendered crucial by the fiery condition of the atmosphere.

"Heureusement pour la réputation de M. de Rênal comme administrateur, un immense mur de soutènement était nécessaire à la promenade publique qui longe la colline à une centaine de pieds au-dessus du cours du Doubs. Elle doit à cette admirable position une des vues les plus pittoresques de France. Mais, à chaque printemps, les eaux de pluie sillonnaient la promenade, y creusaient des ravins et le rendaient impraticable.

This inconvenience, felt by all, put M. de Rênal in the happy necessity of immortalizing his administration by a wall twenty feet high and thirty or forty fathoms long.","Happily for Monsieur de Rênal’s reputation as an administrator, a huge retaining wall was required for the public walkway running along the hillside, roughly a hundred feet above the Doubs. This wonderful location gives it one of the most picturesque views in all France. But every spring the rains had regularly furrowed the walkway, digging out gullies and rendering it impassable. This inconvenience, which affected everyone, placed Monsieur de Rênal under the fortunate obligation of immortalizing his administration by a wall twenty feet high and well over two hundred feet long.","Happily for the reputation of M. de Rênal as an administrator an immense wall of support was necessary for the public promenade which goes along the hill, a hundred steps above the course of the Doubs. This admirable position secures for the promenade one of the most picturesque views in the whole of France. But the rain water used to make furrows in the walk every spring, caused ditches to appear, and rendered it generally impracticable.

Taking it all round, I see in you a spark which one must not neglect."
"Ces dispositions qui s’accroissaient rapidement furent en partie devinées par la jalousie de Mathilde. Elle s’apercevait fort clairement qu’elle avait à lutter contre l’amour de la solitude. Quelquefois, elle prononçait avec terreur le nom de Mme de Rênal. Elle voyait frémir Julien. Sa passion n’eut désormais ni bornes, ni mesure.",These rapidly growing dispositions were partly divined by Mathilde's jealousy.

"Il n’était à Besançon que depuis quelques heures, et déjà il avait conquis un remords. Le vieux chirurgien-major lui avait donné autrefois, malgré sa goutte, quelques leçons d’escrime, telle était toute la science que Julien trouvait au service de sa colère.

In spite of his gout, the old surgeon-major, once upon a time, had given him a few fencing lessons; that was the only knowledge Julien possessed, of which his anger could make any use. But that difficulty would not have mattered, had he known how to show his anger except by striking out with his hands—and, if it had come to a fistfight, his rival, an enormous man, would have thrashed him and left him lying flat on the floor.","He had only been at Besançon some hours, and already he had overcome one pang of remorse.

"Au moment où il entra, deux grands valets de chambre, mieux mis que M. Valenod lui-même, déshabillaient Monseigneur. Ce prélat, avant d’en venir à M. Pirard crut devoir interroger Julien sur ses études. Il parla un peu de dogme, et fut étonné. Bientôt il en vint aux humanités, à Virgile, à Horace, à Cicéron.

Before he got to the question of Father Pirard, His Lordship felt it his duty to inquire into Julien’s studies. He mentioned a few issues of dogma, and was surprised by what he heard in response. Soon he turned to the humanities, to Virgil, to Horace, to Cicero. “These writers,” thought Julien, “earned me my one-hundred-ninety-eighth place.

"Mathilde se sentit saisie d’un bâillement irrésistible; à le voir, il lui semblait qu’elle reconnaissait les antiques dorures et les anciens habitués du salon paternel. Elle se faisait une image parfaitement ennuyeuse de la vie qu’elle allait reprendre à Paris. Et cependant, à Hyères, elle regrettait Paris.","Mathilde felt herself seized with an irresistible yawn; to see it, it seemed to her that she recognized the antique gilding and the old habitues of the paternal drawing-room.

"Il faut que je prenne du punch et que je danse beaucoup, se dit-elle, je veux choisir ce qu’il y a de mieux et faire effet à tout prix. Bon, voici ce fameux impertinent, le comte de Fervaques. Elle accepta son invitation, ils dansèrent. Il s’agit de voir, pensa-t-elle, qui des deux sera le plus impertinent; mais, pour me moquer pleinement de lui, il faut que je le fasse parler. Bientôt tout le reste de la contredanse ne dansa que par contenants. On ne voulait pas perdre une des reparties piquantes de Mathilde. M. de Fervaques se troublait, et, ne trouvant que des paroles élégantes au lieu d’idées faisait des mines, Mathilde, qui avait de l’humeur, fut cruelle pour lui, et s’en fit un ennemi. Elle dansa jusqu’au jour, et enfin se retira horriblement fatiguée. Mais, en voiture, le peu de forces qui lui restait était encore employé à la rendre triste et malheureuse. Elle avait été méprisée par Julien, et ne pouvait le mépriser.","I have to take punch and dance a lot, she thought to herself, I want to choose the best and have an effect at all costs. Well, here is that famous impertinent, the Comte de Fervaques. She accepted his invitation, they danced. It's a matter of seeing, she thought, which of the two will be more sassy; but, to make fun of him fully, I must make him talk. Soon all the rest of the contredanse danced only in containers. We didn't want to lose one of Mathilde's piquant repartee. M. de Fervaques was troubled, and, finding only elegant words instead of ideas, put on faces, Mathilde, who was in bad temper, was cruel to him, and made an enemy of him. She danced until daylight, and finally retired horribly tired. But, in the car, the little strength she had left was still used to make her sad and unhappy. She had been despised by Julien, and could not despise him.","“I need a glass of punch, and I have to dance and dance,” she told herself. “I’ll pick the best dancer here and, no matter what, I’ll make an impression. Fine: There’s that notoriously rude fellow, the Count de Fervaques.” She accepted his invitation; they danced. “It’s still an open question,” she thought, “which of us will be the rudest: if I intend to really show him up, I need to make him talk.” All the rest of them, soon, were simply walking through the steps: no one wanted to risk losing any of Mathilde’s keen-edged responses. Monsieur de Fervaques grew restless. He could not summon up neatly elegant phrases and, instead of ideas, resorted to letting himself look as angry as he felt. Mathilde, who was in a foul mood, treated him so savagely that she made herself an enemy. She danced until dawn, and finally left, incredibly weary. But as her carriage rolled away, whatever strength she had left was busily making her sad and miserable. She had been scorned by Julien, and she could not reply in kind.","“I must take some punch and dance a lot,” she said to herself. “I will pick out the best partner and cut some figure at any price. Good, there is that celebrated cynic, the Comte de Fervaques.” She accepted his invitation; they danced. “The question is,” she thought, “which of us two will be the more impertinent, but in order to make absolute fun of him, I must get him to talk.” Soon all the other members of the quadrille were dancing as a matter of formality; they did not want to lose any of Mathilde’s cutting repartee. M. de Fervaques felt uneasy and as he could only find elegant expressions instead of ideas, began to scowl. Mathilde, who was in a bad temper, was cruel, and made an enemy of him. She danced till daylight and then went home terribly tired. But when she was in the carriage the little vitality she had left was still employed in making her sad and unhappy. She had been despised by Julien and could not despise him. Julien was at the zenith of his happiness."
"Mme de Rênal remarqua qu’il parlait plus souvent que de coutume à Mlle Élisa; elle apprit que ces entretiens étaient causés par la pénurie de la très petite garde-robe de Julien. Il avait si peu de linge, qu’il était obligé de le faire laver fort souvent hors de la maison, et c’est pour ces petits soins qu’Élisa lui était utile. Cette extrême pauvreté, qu’elle ne soupçonnait pas, toucha Mme de Rênal, elle eut envie de lui faire des cadeaux, mais elle n’osa pas; cette résistance intérieure fut le premier sentiment pénible que lui causa Julien. Jusque-là le nom de Julien, et le sentiment d’une joie pure et tout intellectuelle, étaient synonymes pour elle. Tourmentée par l’idée de la pauvreté de Julien, Mme de Rênal parla à son mari de lui faire un cadeau de linge:","Mme de Rênal noticed that he spoke more often than usual to Mlle Élisa; she learned that these interviews were caused by the shortage of Julien's very small wardrobe. He had so little linen that he had to have it washed very often outside the house, and it was for these little cares that Elisa was useful to him. This extreme poverty, which she did not suspect, touched Madame de Rênal, she wanted to give her presents, but she did not dare; this inner resistance was the first painful feeling that Julien caused her. Until then the name of Julien, and the feeling of a pure and entirely intellectual joy, were synonymous for her. Tormented by the idea of Julien's poverty, Mme de Rênal spoke to her husband about giving him a gift of linen:","Madame de Rênal noticed that he spoke more often than usual with Elisa, and learned that these conversations were caused by the extraordinary poverty of Julien’s wardrobe. He had so little underclothing that he was regularly reduced to washing it, away from the house; for these petty attentions Elisa was useful to him. This utter poverty, which she had not suspected, moved Madame de Rênal; she wanted to give him gifts, but did not dare; and that inner conflict was the first painful feeling Julien caused her. To that point, Julien’s name and a feeling of chaste, completely intellectual happiness had become synonymous in her mind. Tormented by the idea of his poverty, Madame de Rênal asked her husband to give him a gift of underclothes.","She learnt that the reason of these interviews was the poverty of Julien’s extremely small wardrobe. He had so little linen that he was obliged to have it very frequently washed outside the house, and it was in these little matters that Elisa was useful to him.

"A cinq heures, Julien reçut une troisième lettre; elle lui fut lancée de la porte de la bibliothèque. Mlle de La Mole s’enfuit encore.

"Devant la porte, étaient réunies à genoux vingt-quatre jeunes filles, appartenant aux familles les plus distinguées de Verrières. Avant d’ouvrir la porte, l’évêque se mit à genoux au milieu de ces jeunes filles toutes jolies. Pendant qu’il priait à haute voix, elles semblaient ne pouvoir assez admirer ses belles dentelles, sa bonne grâce, sa figure si jeune et si douce. Ce spectacle fit perdre à notre héros ce qui lui restait de raison. En cet instant, il se fût battu pour l’Inquisition, et de bonne foi. La porte s’ouvrit tout à coup. La petite chapelle parut comme embrasée de lumière. On apercevait sur l’autel plus de mille cierges divisés en huit rangs, séparés entre eux par des bouquets de fleurs. L’odeur suave de l’encens le plus pur sortait en tourbillon de la porte du sanctuaire. La chapelle dorée à neuf était fort petite, mais très élevée. Julien remarqua qu’il y avait sur l’autel des cierges qui avaient plus de quinze pieds de haut. Les jeunes filles ne purent retenir un cri d’admiration. On n’avait admis dans le petit vestibule de la chapelle que les vingt-quatre jeunes filles, les deux curés et Julien.","In front of the door were gathered on their knees twenty-four young girls, belonging to the most distinguished families of Verrieres. Before opening the door, the bishop knelt down in the midst of these pretty young girls. While he prayed aloud, they seemed unable to admire enough his beautiful lace, his good grace, his face so young and so sweet. This spectacle made our hero lose what reason he had left. At that moment, he would have fought for the Inquisition, and in good faith. The door suddenly opened. The little chapel seemed to be ablaze with light. You could see on the altar more than a thousand candles divided into eight rows, separated from each other by bouquets of flowers. The sweet smell of the purest incense swirled out of the door of the sanctuary. The chapel, gilded as new, was very small, but very lofty. Julien noticed that there were candles on the altar that were more than fifteen feet high. The young girls could not restrain a cry of admiration. Only the twenty-four young girls, the two priests and Julien had been admitted into the little vestibule of the chapel.","Assembled in front of the door, on their knees, were twenty-four young girls, from Verrières’s most distinguished families. Before opening the door, the bishop knelt in the middle of these pretty girls. As he prayed in a firm voice, they seemed unable to help admiring his beautiful lacework, his graceful bearing, his young and very gentle face. Whatever remained of our hero’s rationality left him, as he saw this spectacle. At that moment, he would have gone to war for the Inquisition, and with deep conviction. Suddenly, the door opened. The small chapel seemed to be covered in light. On the altar stood more than a thousand candles, divided into eight rows separated from one another by bouquets of flowers. The sweet smell of the purest incense swept through the doorway like a whirlwind. Newly gilded, the chapel was very small indeed, but wonderfully exalted. Julien noticed that some of the altar candles were more than fifteen feet high. The girls could not restrain a cry of admiration. The only ones allowed into the chapel’s tiny vestibule were the twenty-four girls, the two priests, and Julien.","Twenty-four young girls belonging to the most distinguished families in Verrières were assembled in front of the door. The bishop knelt down in the midst of these pretty maidens before he opened the door.

This spectacle deprived our hero of his last remnants of reason. At this moment he would have fought for the Inquisition, and with a good conscience. The door suddenly opened. The little chapel was blazing with light. More than a thousand candles could be seen before the altar, divided into eight lines and separated from each other by bouquets of flowers. The suave odour of the purest incense eddied out from the door of the sanctuary. The chapel, which had been newly gilded, was extremely small but very high.

Comme Julien sortait:,As Julien was leaving:,"As Julien was leaving: “Altamira tells me you’re one of us,” Don Diego told him, as ever somber.","“Altamira informs me you are one of us,” said Don Diego, whose demeanour was growing graver and graver to Julien as he went out."

"Norbert n’était sensible qu’à quelques détails, qui, au milieu de tant de magnificence, n’avaient pu être soignés. Il évaluait la dépense de chaque chose et, à mesure qu’il arrivait à un total élevé, Julien remarqua qu’il s’en montrait presque jaloux et prenait de l’humeur.","Norbert was sensitive to only a few details, which, in the midst of so much magnificence, could not have been taken care of. He estimated the cost of each thing and, as he arrived at a high total, Julien noticed that he seemed almost jealous and got angry.","Norbert paid attention only to those few details, in the midst of such magnificence, which no one had been able to take care of. He calculated the cost of everything, and the higher the total went, the more jealous he seemed to grow—and, as Julien noticed, the worse his mood became.","Norbert was only struck by a few details which, in the midst of all that magnificence, had not been able to be attended to. He calculated the expense of each item, and Julien remarked that the nearer he got to a sum total, the more jealous and bad-tempered he appeared."
"— Je ne me fais plus aucune illusion, lui disait-elle, même dans les moments où elle osait se livrer à tout son amour: je suis damnée, irrésistiblement damnée. Tu es jeune, tu as cédé à mes séductions, le ciel peut te pardonner mais moi je suis damnée. Je le connais à un signe certain. J’ai peur: qui n’aurait pas peur devant la vue de l’enfer? Mais au fond, je ne me repens point. Je commettrais de nouveau ma faute si elle était à commettre. Que le ciel seulement ne me punisse pas dès ce monde, et dans mes enfants, et j’aurai plus que je ne mérite. Mais toi, du moins, mon Julien, s’écriait-elle dans d’autres moments, es-tu heureux? Trouves-tu que je t’aime assez?","""I no longer have any illusions,"" she would say to him, even when she dared to give herself up to all her love: ""I am damned, irresistibly damned."" You are young, you gave in to my seductions, heaven can forgive you but I am damned. I know him by a certain sign. I am afraid: who would not be afraid before the sight of hell? But deep down, I don't repent. I would commit my fault again if it were to be committed. May heaven only not punish me in this world, and in my children, and I will have more than I deserve. But you, at least, my Julien, she cried at other times, are you happy? Do you think I love you enough?","“I’m not deceiving myself,” she said inwardly, even when she dared surrender fully to her love. “I am damned, irremediably damned. You’re young, I seduced you and you yielded: heaven can pardon you. But me, I’m damned. I have absolute proof of that. I’m afraid: who wouldn’t be afraid, looking down into hell? But in my heart of hearts I feel no repentance. If I were given the chance, I’d commit my sin all over again. May heaven not punish me here and now, while I’m in this world, and not punish me through my children, and I’ll deserve nothing more. But you, at least, my Julien,” she cried aloud at other times, “are you happy? Do you think I love you enough?”","“I do not deceive myself any more,” she would say to him, even during the moments when she dared to surrender herself to his full love. “I am damned, irrevocably damned. You are young, heaven may forgive you, but I, I am damned. I know it by a certain sign. I am afraid—who would not be afraid at the sight of hell? But at the bottom of my heart I do not repent at all. I would commit my sin over again if I had the opportunity. If heaven will only forbear to punish me in this world and through my children, I shall have more than I deserve.

"Il regarda le ciel et fit un signe de croix. A la vue de ce signe sacré, Julien sentit diminuer l’horreur profonde qui, depuis son entrée dans cette maison, l’avait glacé.","He looked at the sky and made the sign of the cross. At the sight of this sacred sign, Julien felt the profound horror diminish which, since his entry into this house, had frozen him.","He looked upward and made the sign of the cross.

"Mais bientôt toute son attention fut absorbée par douze ou quinze jolies femmes qui, placées vis-à-vis la sellette de l’accusé, remplissaient les trois balcons au-dessus des juges et des jurés.

Minuit sonna pendant le silence qui suivit le beau mot je le ferai. Julien trouva que le son de la pendule avait quelque chose d’imposant et de funèbre. Il était ému.,Midnight struck during the silence that followed the beautiful word I will. Julien found that the sound of the clock had something imposing and funereal about it. He was moved.,"Midnight sounded, during the silence that followed those fine words: “I will do exactly that.” It seemed to Julien that there was something imposing and funereal in the striking pendulum.

"C’est elle, c’est sa bonté! se dit Julien attendri, elle veut me consoler; mais pourquoi pas une seule parole d’amitié?","It's her, it's her goodness! thought Julien, moved, she wants to console me; but why not a single word of friendship?","“It’s her, it’s her generosity!” Julien told himself, his heart softening. “She wants to comfort me.

"Lui faire peur! se répétait-il fièrement, et il avait raison d’être fier. Même dans ses moments les plus heureux, Mme de Rênal doutait toujours que mon amour fût égal au sien. Ici, c’est un démon que je subjugue, donc il faut subjuguer.","Scare him! he repeated proudly to himself, and he was right to be proud. Even in her happiest moments, Madame de Rênal always doubted that my love was equal to hers. Here, it is a demon that I am subjugating, so it is necessary to subjugate.","“Make her afraid!” he kept repeating proudly, and he had reason to be proud. Even in their happiest moments, Madame de Rênal had always doubted that his love equaled hers. “I’m subduing a demon, here, which must be subdued.”","“Frighten her!” he repeated proudly, and he had cause to be proud. “Madame de Rênal always doubted even in her happiest moments if my love was equal to her own. In this case I have to subjugate a demon, consequently I must subjugate her.”"
"Sa pensée ne s’arrêta pas davantage à ce raisonnement. Le jugement, l’ennui de paraître en public la défense il considérait tout cela comme de légers embarras, des cérémonies ennuyeuses auxquelles il serait temps de songer le jour même. Le moment de la mort ne l’arrêtait guère plus: J’y songerai après le jugement. La vie n’était point ennuyeuse pour lui, il considérait toutes choses sous un nouvel aspect, il n’avait plus d’ambition. Il pensait rarement à Mlle de La Mole. Ses remords l’occupaient beaucoup et lui présentaient souvent l’image de Mme de Rênal, surtout pendant le silence des nuits troublé seulement, dans ce donjon élevé, par le chant de l’orfraie!","His thoughts did not stop at this reasoning either. Judgment, the boredom of appearing in public, the defence, he considered all that to be trivial embarrassments, tedious ceremonies which it would be time to think about that very day. The moment of death did not stop him much more: I will think about it after the judgment. Life was not boring for him, he saw everything in a new light, he had no more ambition. He rarely thought of Mademoiselle de La Mole. His remorse occupied him greatly and often presented to him the image of Madame de Rênal, especially during the silence of the nights disturbed only, in this lofty dungeon, by the song of the orfray!","There was no point to even thinking about it, beyond this. The trial, the boredom of having to appear in public, his defense—all of those things seemed to him trivial embarrassments, boring ceremonies he need not think about, until the day came. The moment of his death hardly concerned him any more than these matters: “I’ll think about it after the trial’s over.” He did not find life boring: he found himself considering things from a new perspective. He had no more ambition. He seldom thought of Mademoiselle de La Mole. Remorse preoccupied him, and often presented him with the image of Madame de Rênal, especially during the nighttime silence, only disturbed, in his high tower, by the shrieking of an osprey.","His thoughts did not linger any further over this line of reasoning. As for the sentence, the disagreeableness of appearing in public, the defence, he considered all this as slight embarrassment, irksome formalities, which it would be time enough to consider on the actual day. The actual moment of death did not seize hold of his mind either. “I will think about it after the sentence.” Life was no longer boring, he was envisaging everything from a new point of view, he had no longer any ambition. He rarely thought about Mademoiselle de la Mole. His passion of remorse engrossed him a great deal, and often conjured up the image of Madame de Rênal, particularly during the silence of the night, which in this high turret was only disturbed by the song of the osprey."
"Julien était déjà froid et hautain. Il remercia, mais en termes très vagues et n’engageant à rien.

He expressed his thanks, but in the vaguest language, and without committing himself to anything. “Might it be possible,” he was asking himself, “that I could be the natural son of some great lord, exiled to our mountains by the dreaded Napoleon?” The more he considered it, the idea seemed to him less and less improbable. . . . “My hatred for my father would be one thing that proved it. . . . And I wouldn’t be a monster!”","Julien was already cold and haughty.

"En s’interrompant cent fois l’un l’autre, ils parvinrent à grand’peine à se raconter ce qu’ils ignoraient.

"Il y avait deux mois peut-être qu’il n’avait songé à Fouqué. J’étais un grand sot à Strasbourg, ma pensée n’allait pas au-delà du collet de mon habit.

What pleasure I’d give the likes of Father Maslon and Monsieur de Valenod if I die like a slob!”","It had perhaps been two months since he had given Fouqué a thought. “I was a great fool at Strasbourg.

"Mme de Rênal, riche héritière d’une tante dévote mariée à seize ans à un bon gentilhomme, n’avait de sa vie éprouvé ni vu rien qui ressemblât le moins du monde à l’amour. Ce n’était guère que son confesseur, le bon curé Chélan, qui lui avait parlé de l’amour, à propos des poursuites de M. Valenod, et il lui en avait fait une image si dégoûtante, que ce mot ne lui représentait que l’idée du libertinage le plus abject. Elle recardait comme une exception, ou même comme tout à fait hors de nature, l’amour tel qu’elle l’avait trouvé dans le très petit nombre de romans que le hasard avait mis sous ses yeux. Grâce à cette ignorance, Mme de Rênal, parfaitement heureuse, occupée sans cesse de Julien, était loin de se faire le plus petit reproche.","Madame de Rênal, rich heiress of a devout aunt married at sixteen to a good gentleman, had never in her life experienced or seen anything remotely resembling love. It was only her confessor, the good Curé Chélan, who had spoken to her of love, in connection with the pursuits of M. Valenod, and he had given her such a disgusting image of it, that this word only represented to her the idea of the most abject licentiousness. She regarded as an exception, or even as quite out of nature, love such as she had found it in the very few novels which chance had placed before her eyes. Thanks to this ignorance, Madame de Rênal, perfectly happy, constantly occupied with Julien, was far from making the slightest reproach.","At sixteen, Madame de Rênal, rich heiress of a devoted aunt, was married to a well-bred gentleman, having neither experienced nor witnessed, at any time in her life, anything that resembled in the slightest the world of love. Her confessor, the good parish priest, Father Chélan, had barely mentioned love to her, and then only in connection with Monsieur Valenod’s attempts, and had created in her mind a picture so disgusting that the very word had come to represent nothing but the most wretched debauchery. What she saw in the very small number of novels chance had placed in front of her eyes seemed purely exceptional, even completely unnatural. Thanks to this state of ignorance, Madame de Rênal was able, perfectly happily, to think constantly about Julien and yet remain quite remote from anything worthy of even the slightest censure.","Madame de Rênal, the rich heiress of a devout aunt, and married at sixteen to a respectable gentleman, had never felt or seen in her whole life anything that had the slightest resemblance in the whole world to love. Her confessor, the good curé Chélan, had once mentioned love to her, in discussing the advances of M. de Valenod, and had drawn so loathsome a picture of the passion that the word now stood to her for nothing but the most abject debauchery. She had regarded love, such as she had come across it, in the very small number of novels with which chance had made her acquainted, as an exception if not indeed as something absolutely abnormal. It was, thanks to this ignorance, that Madame de Rênal, although incessantly absorbed in Julien, was perfectly happy, and never thought of reproaching herself in the slightest."
"Ainsi, même cet imbécile de Cholin me montre le chemin qu’il faut suivre, se dit Julien.","So even that idiot Cholin is showing me the way to go, Julien thought.","“So even that imbecile De Cholin shows me the path that needs to be taken,” Julien told himself.","“So even that imbecile de Cholin shows me the way to go about things,” said Julien to himself."
"Il y avait là plusieurs libéraux riches, mais heureux pères d’enfants susceptibles d’obtenir des bourses, et en cette qualité subitement convertis depuis la dernière mission.

In spite of such cunning tricks, Monsieur de Rênal had never cared to have them to his house.

But rather than the language itself, what amused them was its oddity. It made them laugh.

Amanda le regarda d’un air étonné; ce regard changea le courage de Julien en témérité; cependant il rougit beaucoup en lui disant:,Amanda looked at him in astonishment; this look changed Julien's courage into temerity; however he blushed a great deal while saying to her:,"She looked at him, very surprised.

Slaves during the time of Spanish domination, they still retain this trait of the face of the fellah of Egypt.","Père Sorel, for it was indeed him, was very surprised—and even more pleased—by the strange arrangement Monsieur de Rênal proposed for his son. All the same, he listened with that air of downcast discontent, and absolutely no interest, which the shrewd inhabitants of these mountains understood only too well how to drape over themselves. They had been enslaved, ever since the days of Spanish domination, and they preserved this physiological trait of the fedayin of Egypt.","Father Sorel (for it was he) was very surprised, and even more pleased at the singular offer which M. de Rênal made him for his son Julien. None the less, he listened to it with that air of sulky discontent and apathy which the subtle inhabitants of these mountains know so well how to assume. Slaves as they have been since the time of the Spanish Conquest, they still preserve this feature, which is also found in the character of the Egyptian fellah."
"Sa physionomie eût suffi à elle seule, disait Mlle de La Mole, pour lui inspirer une joie éternelle. C’était un mélange singulier d’inquiétude et de désappointement; mais de temps à autre on y distinguait fort bien des bouffé es d’importance et de ce ton tranchant que doit avoir l’homme le plus riche de France, quand surtout il est assez bien fait de sa personne et n’a pas encore trente-six ans. Il est timidement insolent, disait M. de Croisenois. Le comte de Caylus, Norbert et deux ou trois jeunes gens à moustaches le persiflèrent tant qu’ils voulurent, sans qu’il s’en doutât, et enfin le renvoyèrent comme une heure sonnait:","Her countenance would have sufficed in itself, said Mademoiselle de La Mole, to inspire her with eternal joy. It was a singular mixture of anxiety and disappointment; but from time to time one could very well make out puffs of importance and that cutting tone which the richest man in France must have, especially when he is rather well made of person and is not yet thirty. -six years. He is timidly insolent, said M. de Croisenois. The Comte de Caylus, Norbert, and two or three mustachioed young people taunted him as much as they liked, without his suspecting it, and finally sent him away as one o'clock struck:","His face, Mademoiselle de La Mole declared, was in itself sufficient to inspire her with eternal joy. It was an odd blend of nervousness and disappointment, though from time to time it clearly displayed flushes of self-importance and of the sharp voice to be expected from the richest man in France, who after all was rather good-looking and not yet thirty-six. “He’s shyly insolent,” said Monsieur de Croisenois. Count de Caylus, Norbert, and two or three other young men with mustaches joked as they liked about him, bantering back and forth, without his knowing what they were up to. And then, as one o’clock sounded, they sent him on his way:","“His physiognomy would be sufficient in itself,” Mademoiselle de la Mole was fond of saying, “to have inspired her with a holy joy.” It was a singular mixture of anxiety and disappointment, but from time to time one could distinguish gusts of self-importance, and above all that trenchant tone suited to the richest man in France, especially when he had nothing to be ashamed of in his personal appearance and was not yet thirty-six. “He is timidly insolent,” M. de Croisenois would say. The Comte de Caylus, Norbert, and two or three moustachioed young people made fun of him to their heart’s content without him suspecting it, and finally packed him off as one o’clock struck."

M. de Frilair was exhausting all the resources of a very skilful mind to prove to her that Julien was unworthy of her.","Hearing this, Mathilde’s jealousy rose to the point of insanity. Father de Frilair had sworn that all his influence could not so defy the rules that she might see her beloved more than once a day.

"Voilà, se dit Mathilde, qui prouve joliment ma maxime La haute naissance ôte la force de caractère sans laquelle on ne se fait point condamner à mort! Je suis donc prédestinée à déraisonner ce soir. Puisque je ne suis qu’une femme comme une autre, eh bien, il faut danser. Elle céda aux instances du marquis de Croisenois, qui depuis une heure sollicitait une galope. Pour se distraire de son malheur en philosophie, Mathilde voulut être parfaitement séduisante, M. de Croisenois fut ravi.","There you have it, thought Mathilde, which nicely proves my maxim High birth takes away the strength of character without which one cannot be condemned to death! So I'm predestined to talk nonsense tonight. Since I'm just a woman like any other, well, you have to dance. She yielded to the entreaties of the Marquis de Croisenois, who for an hour had been asking for a gallop. To distract herself from her misfortune in philosophy, Mathilde wanted to be perfectly seductive, M. de Croisenois was delighted.","“There,” said Mathilde to herself. “That’s a really lovely proof of my maxim. High birth deprives a man of the strength of character without which no one can get himself condemned to death! So I’m fated, tonight, to babble nonsense. Since I’m a mere woman, no different from the others, well! I’ve got to dance.” She yielded to the Marquis de Croisenois’s urging: he’d been asking her for the last hour to dance with him. To keep from thinking about her bad luck as a philosopher, Mathilde wanted to be perfectly seductive. Monsieur de Croisenois was rapturously happy.","“So,” said Mathilde to herself, “what a pretty proof this is of my maxim, that good birth deprives a man of that force of character in default of which a man does not get condemned to death. I seem doomed to reason falsely to-night. Since I am only a woman like any other, well I must dance.” She yielded to the solicitations of M. de Croisenois who had been asking for a gallop for the last hour. To distract herself from her failure in philosophy, Mathilde made a point of being perfectly fascinating. M. de Croisenois was enchanted."
"— C’est que j’ai du caractère, moi, et le curé l’a bien vu. Ne dissimulons rien, nous sommes environnés de libéraux ici. Tous ces marchands de toile me portent envie, j’en ai la certitude, deux ou trois deviennent des richards, eh bien, j’aime assez qu’ils voient passer les enfants de M. de Rênal allant à la promenade sous la conduite de leur précepteur.

It may cost me a hundred crowns, but this must be classed as an expense necessary to maintain our rank.","“It’s because, me, I know what I’m doing—and our parish priest has seen that. Let’s be completely open about it: we’re surrounded by liberals, here. All these calico dealers are jealous of me, I’m quite sure of it; two or three have gotten rich—well now! I’m going to be powerfully pleased when they see Monsieur de Rênal’s children passing by, on their way to the walkway, accompanied by their tutor. That’s going to make an impression. My grandfather always used to tell us how, in his youth, he had a tutor. This one will cost me a hundred gold crowns, but we must see this expense as something necessary to preserve our social standing.”","“It is because I’m a man of character, as the curé found out right enough.

He was restrained only by the maxim he had made to himself never to hasten too much in business.","The tone of this response would have annoyed a less vulnerable man than the mayor of Verrières; he thought about an instant reply, chastising Julien then and there.

"Mme de Rênal eut un instant l’illusion que Julien pourrait accepter les offres de M. Valenod, et rester à Verrières. Mais ce n’était plus cette femme simple et timide de l’année précédente; sa fatale passion, ses remords l’avaient éclairée. Elle eut bientôt la douleur de se prouver à elle-même, tout en écoutant son mari, qu’une séparation au moins momentanée était devenue indispensable. Loin de moi Julien va retomber dans ses projets d’ambition si naturels quand on n’a rien. Et moi grand Dieu! je suis si riche! et si inutilement pour mon bonheur! Il m’oubliera. Aimable comme il est, il sera aimé, il aimera. Ah! malheureuse… De quoi puis-je me plaindre? Le ciel est juste, je n’ai pas eu le mérite de faire cesser le crime, il m’ôte le jugement.

Far from me Julien will fall back into his ambition projects so natural when you have nothing. And me great God! I am so rich! and so uselessly for my happiness! He will forget me. Lovable as he is, he will be loved, he will love. Ah! unhappy… What can I complain about? The sky is just, I did not have the merit to put an end to the crime, it takes away my judgment. It was up to me to win Élisa by dint of money, nothing was easier for me. I didn't bother to think for a moment, the wild imaginations of love took up all my time. I perish.","Madame de Rênal had a fleeting notion that Julien could accept Monsieur Valenod’s offer, and remain in Verrières.

"Moi, par exemple, homme tranquille et médiocre, je comptais mourir dans mon séminaire; j’ai eu l’enfantillage de m’y attacher. Eh bien! j’allais être destitué quand j’ai donné ma démission.

M. de La Mole, whom I had never seen, pulled me out of this bad situation, he had only one word to say, and I was given a cure of which all the parishioners are well-to-do people, above gross vices, and the income makes me ashamed, so little proportioned is it to my work. I only talked to you so long to put some lead in this head.","“Take me, for example, a quiet, mediocre man: I counted on dying in my seminary. I had the childishness to grow attached to it. Well!

Monsieur de La Mole, whom I’d never met, pulled me out of so tight a corner. All he had to say was a single word, and I was given a parish in which everyone is rich, set far above the worst vices, with a salary that embarrasses me, so out of proportion is it to the labor involved.

"Mon Dieu! qu’elle est belle! dit Julien en la voyant courir: voilà cet être qui se précipitait dans mes bras avec tant de fureur il n’y a pas quinze jours… et ces instants ne reviendront jamais! et c’est par ma faute! et au moment d’une action si extraordinaire, si intéressante pour moi, je n’y étais pas sensible!… Il faut avouer que je suis né avec un caractère bien plat et bien malheureux.","My God! that she is beautiful! said Julien, seeing her run: here is this being who rushed into my arms with such fury not two weeks ago... and these moments will never return! and it's my fault! and at the moment of such an extraordinary action, so interesting for me, I was not sensitive to it!… It must be confessed that I was born with a very flat and very unhappy character.","“My God, but she’s lovely!” said Julien, watching her run off. “Here’s this creature who threw herself into my arms, just a week ago, and with such passion! . . .

"Pour toute réponse, sa femme le prit à part, et lui exprima la nécessité d’éloigner Julien. Les heures de bonheur qu’elle venait de trouver lui avaient rendu l’aisance et la fermeté nécessaires pour suivre le plan de conduite qu’elle méditait depuis quinze jours. Ce qui achevait de troubler de fond en comble le pauvre maire de Verrières, c’est qu’il savait que l’on plaisantait publiquement dans la ville sur son attachement pour l’espèce. M. Valenod était généreux comme un voleur, et lui, il s’était conduit d’une manière plus prudente que brillante dans les cinq ou dix dernières quêtes pour la confrérie de Saint-Joseph, pour la congrégation de la Vierge, pour la congrégation du Saint-Sacrement, etc., etc., etc.","In response, his wife took him aside and expressed the need to send Julien away. The hours of happiness which she had just found had given her the ease and firmness necessary to follow the plan of conduct which she had been meditating on for a fortnight.

Valenod was generous as a thief, and he had behaved more prudently than brilliantly in the last five or ten collections for the brotherhood of Saint-Joseph, for the congregation of the Virgin, for the congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, etc., etc., etc.","His wife’s only response was to take him aside and explain how badly they needed to send Julien away. The happy hours she’d just experienced lent her the confidence and steadiness required, so she could carry out the plan she’d been evolving for two weeks. At bottom, what most disturbed the poor mayor was knowing he’d become the butt of jokes all over town, because of his fondness for cash. Monsieur Valenod was as generous as a burglar, and the mayor had behaved with more prudence than brilliance in the last five or six fund drives for the Brotherhood of Saint Joseph, the Congregation of the Holy Virgin, the Congregation of the Holy Sacrament, etc., etc., etc.","For answer, his wife took him on one side and declared that it was essential to send Julien away. The hours of happiness which she had just enjoyed had given her again the ease and firmness of demeanour necessary to follow out the plan of campaign which she had been hatching for a fortnight.

"Ainsi, après trois heures de dialogue, Julien obtint ce qu’il avait désiré avec tant de passion pendant les deux premières. Un peu plus tôt arrivés, le retour aux sentiments tendres, l’éclipse des remords chez Mme de Rênal eussent été un bonheur divin, ainsi obtenus avec art, ce ne fut plus qu’un triomphe.

Julien absolutely wanted, against his friend's insistence, to light the pilot light.","Thus, after talking for three hours, Julien obtained what, with so much passion, he’d desired for the first two of those hours. Had it happened a bit sooner, this reversion to tender emotions, this casting off of Madame de Rênal’s remorse, would have been divine happiness. Attained as it was, by artful skill, it was merely a pleasure. Julien was determined, despite his beloved’s protests, to turn on the night-light.","So it was in this way that, after a dialogue lasting three hours, Julien obtained what he desired so passionately during the first two hours. Madame de Rênal’s return to her tender feelings and this overshadowing of her remorse would have been a divine happiness had they come a little earlier; but, as they had been obtained by artifice, they were simply a pleasure. Julien insisted on lighting the nightlight in spite of his mistress’s opposition."
"Après dîner, il se trouva tout à fait débarrassé de l’accès d’enthousiasme qui l’avait obsédé toute la journée. Par bonheur, l’académicien qui savait le latin était de ce dîner. Voilà l’homme qui se moquera le moins de moi, se dit Julien, si, comme je le présume, ma question sur le deuil de Mlle de La Mole est une gaucherie.","After dinner he found himself quite rid of the fit of enthusiasm which had obsessed him all day. Fortunately, the academician who knew Latin was present at this dinner party. Here is the man who will laugh at me the least, Julien thought, if, as I presume, my question about the mourning of Mademoiselle de La Mole is clumsy.","After dinner, he realized that the flooding enthusiasm he had felt the entire day had completely left him. Luckily, the academician who knew Latin had been dining with them. “Here’s a man who wouldn’t likely make fun of me,” Julien told himself, “if, as I suspect it is, asking Mademoiselle de La Mole about her mourning would be a stupid blunder.”","After dinner he felt completely rid of the feeling which had obsessed him all day. Fortunately the academician who knew Latin was at dinner. “That’s the man who will make the least fun of me,” said Julien to himself, “if, as I surmise, my question about Mademoiselle de la Mole’s mourning is in bad taste.”"
"Elle tourna la tête vers lui lentement: il fut étonné de l’extrême douleur qui était dans ses yeux, c’était à ne pas reconnaître leur physionomie habituelle.","She turned her head towards him slowly: he was amazed at the extreme pain that was in her eyes, it was unrecognizable to their usual physiognomy.","Slowly, she turned her head toward him.

Filled with happiness by this feeling, he locked himself in his room, and gave himself up with a whole new pleasure to reading the exploits of his hero.","He woke at five the next day, and it would have been painfully cruel for Madame de Rênal, had she known it, but he barely gave her a thought. He had done his duty, performed a heroic act. This made him exceedingly happy, and he proceeded to shut himself in his room, where he read about his heroes’ exploits with a new pleasure.","He was called at five o’clock on the following day and scarcely gave Madame de Rênal a single thought. He had accomplished his duty, and a heroic duty too. The consciousness of this filled him with happiness; he locked himself in his room, and abandoned himself with quite a new pleasure to reading exploits of his hero."
"Quand enfin celui-ci fut seul dans sa petite chambre de bois de sapin: Il est vrai, se dit-il, je puis gagner ici quelques mille francs, puis reprendre avec avantage le métier de soldat ou celui de prêtre, suivant la mode qui alors régnera en France. Le petit pécule que j’aurai amassé, lèvera toutes les difficultés de détail. Solitaire dans cette montagne, j’aurai dissipé un peu l’affreuse ignorance où je suis de tant de choses qui occupent tous ces hommes de salon. Mais Fouqué renonce à se marier, il me répète que la solitude le rend malheureux. Il est évident que s’il prend un associé qui n’a pas de fonds à verser dans son commerce, c’est dans l’espoir de se faire un compagnon qui ne le quitte jamais.","When at last he was alone in his little room of fir wood: It's true, he said to himself, I can earn a few thousand francs here, then resume with advantage the profession of soldier or that of priest, according to the fashion that prevails. then will reign in France. The little savings that I will have amassed will remove all the difficulties of detail. Solitary in this mountain, I will have dispelled a little the dreadful ignorance in which I am of so many things which occupy all these men of salon. But Fouqué gives up getting married, he keeps telling me that loneliness makes him unhappy. It is obvious that if he takes on a partner who has no funds to put into his business, it is in the hope of making a companion who will never leave him.","When Julien was by himself, in his little pinewood room: “It’s true,” he told himself, “I could make thousands of francs out here, and then I’d be in a better position to become a soldier, or a priest, whichever would be better, whatever’s more in fashion, then. The modest savings I’ll have accumulated would remove all the petty details and difficulties. Alone up on this mountain, I’ll be freed from some of that awful ignorance I suffer from, all those things high society people take so seriously. But Fouqué doesn’t plan to get married, yet he keeps telling me that being alone makes him miserable. The real reason he’d take in a partner, someone who has no money to invest in his business, is the hope that he’ll find himself a companion, a person who’ll never leave him.","When, finally, the latter was alone in his little room of pinewood, he said to himself: “It is true I can make some thousands of francs here and then take up with advantage the profession of a soldier, or of a priest, according to the fashion prevalent in France. The little hoard that I shall have amassed will remove all petty difficulties. In the solitude of this mountain I shall have dissipated to some extent my awful ignorance of so many of the things which make up the life of all those men of fashion. But Fouqué has given up all thoughts of marriage, and at the same time keeps telling me that solitude makes him unhappy. It is clear that if he takes a partner who has no capital to put into his business, he does so in the hopes of getting a companion who will never leave him.”"
"A ce mot, qui fut entendu tous comme à l’envi firent compliment à Julien, non seulement sur le magnifique cadeau qu’il avait reçu de Monseigneur, mais aussi de la conversation de deux heures dont il avait été honoré. On savait jusqu’aux plus petits détails. De ce moment, il n’y eut plus d’envie; on lui fit la cour bassement: l’abbé Castanède, qui, la veille encore, était de la dernière insolence envers lui, vint le prendre par le bras et l’invita à déjeuner.","At this word, which was overheard, everyone complimented Julien, not only on the magnificent gift he had received from Monseigneur, but also on the two-hour conversation with which he had been honored. We knew down to the smallest details. From that moment there was no longer any desire; they courted him basely: the Abbé Castanède, who the day before had been extremely insolent towards him, came and took him by the arm and invited him to breakfast.","Everyone overhead these words, and they began to outdo each other, complimenting Julien not only for the magnificent gift he’d received from His Lordship, but also on the two-hour conversation with which he’d been honored. They knew everything, down to the smallest details. And after this, there was no more jealousy; they all paid him the most servile court; Father Castaneda, who had treated him, the evening before, with the utmost insolence, came and took him by the arm, inviting Julien to have lunch with him.","On hearing these words, they all congratulated Julien enviously, not only on the magnificent present which he had received from my lord, but also on the two hours’ conversation with which he had been honoured. They knew even its minutest details. From that moment envy ceased completely. They courted him basely. The Abbé Castanède, who had manifested towards him the most extreme insolence the very day before, came and took his arm and invited him to breakfast."

He won’t be of any use if his pride is wounded. You’ll turn him into an idiot.”","“I was forgetting to warn you of one thing,” said the Abbé. “This young man, though of low birth, has a high spirit.

"L’air de cet homme était pourtant singulier, se disait Julien; son oeil grossier m’examinait.","The air of this man was, however, singular, thought Julien; his coarse eye examined me.","However, Julien told himself, the postmaster had seemed strange. “He was studying me with his vulgar eyes.”","“That man looked strange though,” thought Julien to himself. “He was scrutinizing me with his brutal eyes.”"

"Quelques heures après, le grand soleil le surprit appuyé sur sa table. Un des moments les plus pénibles de sa vie était celui où, chaque matin, en s’éveillant, il s’apprenait son malheur. Ce jour-là, il acheva la copie de sa lettre presque en riant. Est-il possible, se disait-il, qu’il se soit trouvé un jeune homme pour écrire ainsi! Il compta plusieurs phrases de neuf lignes. Au bas de l’original, il aperçut une note au crayon:","A few hours later, the bright sun caught him leaning on his table. One of the most painful moments of his life was when, each morning, on waking, he learned of his misfortune. That day, he finished the copy of his letter almost laughing. Is it possible, he said to himself, that he had found a young man to write like this! He counted several nine-line sentences. At the bottom of the original he saw a note in pencil:","Some hours later, he was awakened by bright sunshine. One of the most painful moments in his life occurred, every morning, when he woke and was once again aware of his misery. But on this day, he completed his copy of the letter, laughing. “Is it really possible,” he was saying to himself, “that a young man truly exists, capable of writing like this!” He noted several sentences that ran a full nine lines each. At the close of the original, he saw a note, in pencil:","Some hours afterwards he was surprised to see the broad daylight as he leant on his desk. The most painful moments in his life were those when he woke up every morning to realise his unhappiness. On this particular day he finished copying out his letter in a state verging on laughter. “Is it possible,” he said to himself, “that there ever lived a young man who actually wrote like that?” He counted several sentences of nine lines each. At the bottom of the original he noticed a penciled note."
"— Pas mal, dit le marquis en riant. Au reste, je parie, monsieur l’homme profond, que vous n’avez pas deviné ce que vous êtes allé faire en Angleterre.","""Not bad,"" said the marquis, laughing. Besides, I wager, sir, you haven't guessed what you went to do in England.","“Not bad, not at all bad,” said the marquis, laughing. “But in any case, I’ll wager, Monsieur Profundity, that you haven’t figured out what you were sent to England to do.”","“Not bad,” said the marquis laughing. “Anyway I will wager Monsieur Deep-one that you have not guessed what you went to do in England.”"
"Assise sur le divan de la bibliothèque immobile et la tête tournée du côté opposé à Julien, elle était en proie aux plus vives douleurs que l’orgueil et l’amour puissent faire éprouver à une âme humaine. Dans quelle atroce démarche elle venait de tomber!","Seated motionless on the divan in the library, her head turned away from Julien, she was a prey to the keenest pains that pride and love can cause a human soul to experience. In what atrocious gait she had just fallen!","Seated on the library couch, unmoving, her head turned away from Julien, she was gripped by the sharpest sorrow pride and love can make a human heart feel. What horrible behavior she had fallen into!","Seated motionless on the library divan, with her head turned in the opposite direction to Julien, she was a prey to the most poignant anguish that pride and love can inflict upon a human soul. What an awful step she had just slipped into taking!"
"— Au premier venu! s’écria Julien, et il s’élança sur une vieille épée du Moyen Âge, qui était conservée dans la bibliothèque comme une curiosité.","- To the first comer! cried Julien, and he rushed at an old sword from the Middle Ages, which was kept in the library as a curiosity.","Julien exclaimed, running over to where, hung in the library as a curiosity, there was an ancient, medieval sword.","“The first man who came along,” cried Julien, and he made for an old mediaeval sword which was kept in the library as a curiosity."
"Julien se sentit irrité, mais pourtant elle avait raison. M. Pirard était sans contredit le plus honnête homme du salon, mais sa figure couperosée, qui s’agitait des bourrèlements de sa conscience, le rendait hideux en ce moment. Croyez après cela aux physionomies pensa Julien; c’est dans le moment où la délicatesse de l’abbé Pirard se reproche quelque peccadille, qu’il a l’air atroce; tandis que sur la figure de ce Napier, espion connu de tous, on lit un bonheur pur et tranquille. L’abbé Pirard avait fait cependant de grandes concessions à son parti; il avait pris un domestique, il était fort bien vêtu.","Julien felt irritated, but nevertheless she was right. M. Pirard was unquestionably the most honest man in the drawing-room, but his blotchy face, which stirred with the pangs of his conscience, made him hideous at the moment. Believe in faces after that, thought Julien; it is at the moment when the delicacy of the Abbé Pirard reproaches himself for some peccadillo, that he looks atrocious; while on the face of this Napier, a spy known to all, one reads a pure and tranquil happiness. The Abbé Pirard had, however, made great concessions to his party; he had hired a servant, he was very well dressed.","Julien was annoyed, but she was right. Certainly, no one could deny that Father Pirard was the most respectable man in the entire room, but his blotchy complexion, racked by his pangs of conscience, at that moment did make him hideous. “Better believe what faces tell you!” thought Julien. “It’s precisely when Father Pirard’s scrupulousness scolds him for some little sin that he looks atrocious, while on Napier’s face—that universally recognized spy—all you see is pure, calm happiness.” But Father Pirard had made some large concessions to his new role: he had hired a manservant, and he dressed very well.","Julien felt irritated, but she was right all the same. M. Pirard was unquestionably the most honest man in the salon, but his pimply face, which was suffering from the stings of conscience, made him look hideous at this particular moment. “Trust physiognomy after this,” thought Julien, “it is only when the delicate conscience of the Abbé Pirard is reproaching him for some trifling lapse that he looks so awful; while the expression of that notorious spy Napier shows a pure and tranquil happiness.” The Abbé Pirard, however, had made great concessions to his party. He had taken a servant, and was very well dressed."

"— Le pauvre Croisenois, disait-il à Mathilde, a été réellement bien raisonnable et bien honnête homme envers nous; il eût dû me haïr lors de vos imprudences dans le salon de madame votre mère, et me chercher querelle; car la haine qui succède au mépris est ordinairement furieuse…","'Poor Croisenois,' he said to Mathilde, 'was really a very reasonable and very honest man towards us; he ought to have hated me during your imprudences in your mother's salon, and to pick a quarrel with me; for the hatred that follows contempt is usually furious...","“Poor de Croisenois,” he said to Mathilde, “was really very reasonable and decent to us. He was obliged to hate me when you behaved so incautiously in your mother’s drawing room, and so he wanted a quarrel, since the hate that follows after contempt is usually a furious one.”","“Poor Croisenois,” he said to Mathilde, “really behaved very reasonably and very honourably towards us; he had ample ground for hating me and picking a quarrel with me, by reason of your indiscretion in your mother’s salon; for the hatred which follows on contempt is usually frenzied.”"
"— L’avenir se dessinait à mes yeux fort clairement. Après ma mort, je vous remariais à M. de Croisenois, qui aurait épousé une veuve. L’âme noble mais un peu romanesque de cette veuve charmante, étonnée et convertie au culte de la prudence vulgaire par un événement singulier, tragique et grand pour elle, eût daigné comprendre le mérite fort réel du jeune marquis. Vous vous seriez résignée à être heureuse du bonheur de tout le monde: la considération, les richesses, le haut rang… Mais, chère Mathilde, votre arrivée à Besançon, si elle est soupçonnée, va être un coup mortel pour M. de La Mole, et voilà ce que jamais je ne me pardonnerai. Je lui ai déjà causé tant de chagrin! L’académicien va dire qu’il a réchauffé un serpent dans son sein.","“The future was very clear to me. After my death, I remarried you to M. de Croisenois, who would have married a widow. The noble but somewhat romantic soul of this charming widow, astonished and converted to the cult of vulgar prudence by a singular event, tragic and great for her, would have deigned to understand the very real merit of the young marquis. You would have resigned yourself to being happy with everyone's happiness: consideration, wealth, high rank... But, dear Mathilde, your arrival in Besançon, if suspected, will be a mortal blow for M. de La Mole , and this is what I will never forgive myself for. I have already caused him so much grief! The academician is going to say that he has warmed a snake in his bosom.","“I saw the future wonderfully clearly. After my death, I saw you remarried to Monsieur de Croisenois, who would be marrying a widow. The noble but a bit romantic soul of this charming widow had been so shocked by a bizarre occurrence, for her both tragic and great, that she became a convert to the cult of common prudence, and took the trouble to understand the real worth of the young marquis. You would have been resigned to everyday happiness: respect, wealth, a lofty rank. . . . But, my dear Mathilde, your coming here, should it be suspected, would be a fatal blow for Monsieur de La Mole, and for that he will never forgive me. I’ve already caused him so much sorrow! The academician will be saying he nourished a serpent in his breast.”","“I sketched out the future very clearly. After my death I intended to remarry you to M. de Croisenois, who will officially of course then marry a widow. The noble but slightly romantic soul of this charming widow, who will have been brought back to the cult of vulgar prudence by an astonishing and singular event which played in her life a part as great as it was tragic, will deign to appreciate the very real merit of the young marquis. You will resign yourself to be happy with ordinary wordly happiness, prestige, riches, high rank. But, dear Mathilde, if your arrival at Besançon is suspected, it will be a mortal blow for M. de la Mole, and that is what I shall never forgive myself. I have already caused him so much sorrow. The academician will say that he has nursed a serpent in his bosom."
"Bien plus, peut-être il n’avait nul amour pour elle!","Even more, perhaps he had no love for her!","What’s more, quite possibly he had no love whatever for her!","What was more, he probably did not love her."
"Ceci devient sérieux, mon garçon, ajouta-t-il avec une gaieté et un accent gascons. Il y a de l’honur. Jamais un pauvre diable, jeté aussi bas que moi par le hasard, ne retrouvera une telle occasion: j’aurai des bonnes fortunes mais subalternes…","This is getting serious, my boy, he added with Gascon accent and gaiety. There is honor. Never a poor devil, thrown as low as me by chance, will find such an opportunity: I will have good fortunes, but subordinate ones...","“This is getting serious, my boy,” he added, clownishly, brightly. “It’s all about ’onor, it is. What poor devil, thrown so far down by chance, ever gets an opportunity like this? I’ll do well with other women, yes, but never one so high up.","“This is getting serious, my boy,” he added with a Gascon gaiety and accent. “Honour is at stake. A poor devil flung by chance into as low a grade as I am will never find such an opportunity again. I shall have my conquests, but they will be inferior ones."
"— M. Descoulis aura un nom dans l’histoire, reprit le marquis, il a fait la Restauration avec l’abbé de Pradt et MM. de Talleyrand et Pozzo di Borgo.","""M. Descoulis will have a name in history,"" resumed the marquis, ""he made the Restoration with the Abbé de Pradt and MM. of Talleyrand and Pozzo di Borgo.","“Monsieur Descoulis will have a place in history,” replied de Croisenois. “It was he who brought about the Restoration, along with Talleyrand and Pozzo di Borgo, not to mention Father de Pradt.”","“M. Descoulis will live in history,” replied the marquis. “He brought about the restoration together with the Abbé de Pradt and messieurs de Talleyrand and Pozzo di Borgo.”"
"— Monsieur, il est à deux genoux dans la boue, lui disait toujours le porte-clefs; il prie à haute voix et dit des litanies pour votre âme…","""Monsieur, he's on his knees in the mud,"" the turnkey always said to him; he prays aloud and says litanies for your soul...","“Sir, he’s on his knees in the mud,” the guard told him, each time. “He prays in a loud voice, and says prayers for your soul. . . .”","“Monsieur,” said the turnkey to him on each occasion, “he is on both his knees in the mud; he is praying at the top of his voice, and saying litanies for your soul."
"— Mais ne voyez-vous pas, lui dit Julien en souriant, que je me fais aussi coupable que vous pouvez le désirer? Allez, monsieur, vous ne manquerez pas la proie que vous poursuivez. Vous aurez le plaisir de condamner. Épargnez-moi votre présence.","""But don't you see,"" said Julien, smiling, ""that I'm making myself as guilty as you can wish?"" Come on, sir, you won't miss the prey you're after. You will have the pleasure of condemning. Spare me your presence.","“But don’t you see,” said Julien, smiling, “that I’m making myself as guilty as you could ever want? Face it, sir: there’ll be no difficulty nabbing the victim you’re chasing. You will have the pleasure of sentencing him. Spare me, please, having to deal with you.”","“Don’t you see,” said Julien to him with a smile, “that I am making myself out as guilty as you can possibly desire? Go away, Monsieur, you will not fail to catch the quarry you are pursuing. You will have the pleasure to condemn me. Spare me your presence.”"
"Et c’est là une femme amoureuse! pensa Julien, elle ose dire qu’elle aime! tant de sang-froid, tant de sagesse dans les précautions m’indiquent assez que je ne triomphe pas de M. de Croisenois comme je le croyais sottement, mais que tout simplement je lui succède. Au fait que m’importe! est-ce que je l’aime? je triomphe du marquis en ce sens, qu’il sera très fâché d’avoir un successeur, et plus fâché encore que ce successeur soit moi. Avec quelle hauteur il me regardait hier soir au café Tortoni, en affectant de ne pas me reconnaître; avec quel air méchant il me salua ensuite, quand il ne put plus s’en dispenser!","And that is a woman in love! thought Julien, she dares to say that she loves! so much coolness, so much wisdom in the precautions tell me enough that I am not triumphing over M. de Croisenois as I foolishly believed, but that quite simply I am succeeding him. Why don't I care! do I love him? I triumph over the marquis in the sense that he will be very angry to have a successor, and even more annoyed that this successor is me. How haughtily he looked at me last night at the Cafe Tortoni, affecting not to recognize me; with what a wicked air he afterwards saluted me, when he could no longer dispense with it!","“And this is a woman in love!” thought Julien. “She has the nerve to say she’s in love! Such calm, such sensible precautions, show me very plainly that I’m not triumphing over Monsieur de Croisenois, as I so foolishly believed. I’ve simply become his successor. Really, what does it matter? Am I in love with her? I’ve won a victory over de Croisenois, because he’ll be exceedingly angry, having a successor at all, and angrier still to have that successor be me. How arrogantly he looked at me, yesterday night, at Café Tortoni, pretending he didn’t even know me! How nastily he greeted me, afterward, when he couldn’t get out of it any longer.”","“So this is a woman in love,” thought Julien. “She actually dares to say that she is in love. So much self-possession and such shrewdness in taking precautions are sufficient indications that I am not triumphing over M. de Croisenois as I foolishly believed, but that I am simply succeeding him. As a matter of fact, what does it matter to me? Do I love her? I am triumphing over the marquis in so far as he would be very angry at having a successor, and angrier still at that successor being myself. How haughtily he looked at me this evening in the Café Tortoni when he pretended not to recognise me! And how maliciously he bowed to me afterwards, when he could not get out of it.”"
"— Ce n’est pas à l’étranger tout seul, continua le marquis du ton le plus mesuré, que nous pouvons devoir une nouvelle occupation militaire. Toute cette jeunesse, qui fait des articles incendiaires dans le Globe, vous donnera trois ou quatre mille jeunes capitaines, parmi lesquels peut se trouver un Kléber, un Hoche, un Jourdan, un Pichegru, mais moins bien intentionné.","""It is not to foreigners alone,"" continued the Marquis in the most measured tone, ""that we can owe a new military occupation. All this youth, who write incendiary articles in the Globe, will give you three or four thousand young captains, among whom may be a Kléber, a Hoche, a Jourdan, a Pichegru, but less well intentioned.","“It’s not only foreigners,” the marquis continued, his words carefully measured, “to whom we may owe a new military occupation. All the young fellows who write incendiary articles in The Globe may provide you with three or four thousand young captains, among whom, perhaps, might be found a Kléber, a Hoche, a Jourdain, a Pichegru, but not so well meaning.”","“It is not only on foreign powers,” continued the marquis in a more even tone, “on whom we shall be able to rely for a new military occupation. All those young men who write inflammatory articles in the Globe will provide you with three or four thousand young captains among whom you may find men with the genius, but not the good intentions of a Kléber, a Hoche, a Jourdan, a Pichegru.”"
"Lorsque Julien put sortir de la bibliothèque, il était tellement étonné, qu’il en sentait moins son malheur. Eh bien! elle ne m’aime plus, se répétait-il en se parlant tout haut comme pour s’apprendre sa position. Il paraît qu’elle ma aimé huit ou dix jours, et moi je l’aimerai toute la vie.","When Julien was able to leave the library, he was so surprised that he felt his misfortune less. Well! she no longer loves me, he repeated to himself, speaking aloud to himself as if to learn his position. It seems that she loved me for eight or ten days, and I will love her all my life.","When Julien was able to leave the library, he was so stunned that he actually could not feel his misery so deeply as before. “Well! She doesn’t love me anymore,” he kept repeating aloud, as if to help himself determine his position. “She has apparently loved me for a week or so—and I, I’ll love her forever.","When Julien was allowed to leave the library he was so astonished that he was less sensitive to his unhappiness. “She does not love me any more,” he repeated to himself, speaking aloud as though to teach himself how he stood. “It seems that she has loved me eight or ten days, but I shall love her all my life."
"De là le succès du petit paysan Julien. Elle trouva des jouissances douces, et toutes brillantes du charme de la nouveauté, dans la sympathie de cette âme noble et fière. Mme de Rênal lui eut bientôt pardonné son ignorance extrême gui était une grâce de plus, et la rudesse de ses façons qu’elle parvint à corriger. Elle trouva qu’il valait la peine de l’écouter, même quand on parlait des choses les plus communes, même quand il s’agissait d’un pauvre chien écrasé, comme il traversait la rue, par la charrette d’un paysan allant au trot. Le spectacle de cette douleur donnait son gros rire à son mari, tandis qu’elle voyait se contracter les beaux sourcils noirs et si bien arqués de Julien. La générosité, la noblesse d’âme, l’humanité lui semblèrent peu à peu n’exister que chez ce jeune abbé. Elle eut pour lui seul toute la sympathie et même l’admiration que ces vertus excitent chez les âmes bien nées.","Hence the success of the little peasant Julien. She found sweet pleasures, all shining with the charm of novelty, in the sympathy of this noble and proud soul. Madame de Rênal soon forgave him his extreme ignorance, which was one more grace, and the roughness of his manners, which she succeeded in correcting. She found it worth listening to, even when the most common things were being talked about, even when it was a question of a poor dog crushed, as he was crossing the street, by a peasant's cart going trotting pace. The spectacle of this pain gave her husband his hearty laugh, while she saw Julien's beautiful black eyebrows twitch so well arched. Generosity, nobility of soul, humanity seemed to him little by little to exist only in this young abbé. She had for him alone all the sympathy and even the admiration which these virtues excite in well-born souls.","All of which explains what went on with the little peasant, Julien. She discovered sweet pleasures and all the glowing charms of novelty in the affectionate ways of this noble, fierce soul. Madame de Rênal often had to excuse his extraordinary ignorance, which was yet another charm, as well as the coarseness of his manners, which she tried to correct. She learned that he took the trouble to listen to her, even when they spoke of the most ordinary things, like a poor dog run over, as it was crossing the street, by a peasant’s cart going quite fast. Seeing such small tragedies made her husband laugh his grossest laugh, whereas she could see the furrowing of Julien’s handsome, beautifully arched black eyebrows. Generosity, nobility of soul, humanity, little by little appeared to her to exist nowhere but in this young ecclesiastic. It was only for him that she felt the sympathy, even the admiration, that virtue arouses in well-born souls.","Hence the success of the little peasant Julien. She found in the sympathy of this proud and noble soul a sweet enjoyment which had all the glamour and fascination of novelty. Madame de Rênal soon forgave him that extreme ignorance, which constituted but an additional charm, and the roughness of his manner which she succeeded in correcting. She thought that he was worth listening to, even when the conversation turned on the most ordinary events, even in fact when it was only a question of a poor dog which had been crushed as he crossed the street by a peasant’s cart going at a trot. The sight of the dog’s pain made her husband indulge in his coarse laugh, while she noticed Julien frown, with his fine black eyebrows which were so beautifully arched. Little by little, it seemed to her that generosity, nobility of soul and humanity were to be found in nobody else except this young Abbé. She felt for him all the sympathy and even all the admiration which those virtues excite in well-born souls."

"Le marquis n’avait aucune inquiétude sur sa mémoire Julien lui avait récité plusieurs fois la note secrète, mais il craignait tort qu’il ne fût intercepté.","The marquis had no worries about his memory Julien had recited the secret note to him several times, but he was wrongly afraid that he would be intercepted.",The marquis was not worried about his memory. Julien had several times recited the secret note. What did worry Monsieur de La Mole was fear of Julien’s being intercepted.,The marquis had no anxiety on the score of his memory.

"Enfin, l’abbé de Frilair fut sûr de son empire. Il fit entendre à Mathilde (sans doute il mentait), qu’il pouvait disposer à son gré du ministère public, chargé de soutenir l’accusation contre Julien.","Finally, the Abbé de Frilair was sure of his empire. He gave Mathilde to understand (no doubt he was lying) that he could dispose of the public prosecutor's office, charged with supporting the accusation against Julien, as he pleased.","The vicar-general was finally sure he had everything under control. He let Mathilde know (and was surely lying) that he could do as he liked, in dealing with the public official who was prosecuting",At last the Abbé de Frilair was sure of his power over her. He gave Mathilde to understand (and he was doubtless lying) that he could do what he liked with the public official who was entrusted with the conduct of Julien ’s prosecution.
"C’est que votre société vieillie prise avant tout les convenances… Vous ne vous élèverez jamais au-dessus de la bravoure militaire; vous aurez des Murat, et jamais de Washington. Je ne vois en France que de la vanité. Un homme qui invente en parlant arrive facilement à une saillie imprudente, et le maître de la maison se croit déshonoré.","It's because your aging society values propriety above all... You will never rise above military bravery; you will have Murats, and never Washington. I see nothing but vanity in France. A man who invents while speaking easily comes to an imprudent projection, and the master of the house thinks himself dishonored.","“That’s because this withered old society of yours always puts propriety first. . . . France will never lift itself any higher than bravery in battle. You’ll always have Murats, but never a Washington. All I see in France is vanity. A creative man, talking easily, slips into a brilliant impropriety, and the master of the house thinks he’s been insulted.”","“The fact is, your effete society prizes conventionalism above everything else. You will never get beyond military bravery. You will have Murats, never Washingtons. I can see nothing in France except vanity. A man who goes on speaking on the spur of the moment may easily come to make an imprudent witticism and the master of the house thinks himself insulted.”"
"Le geôlier obéit. A peine la porte fut-elle fermée: Grand Dieu! elle n’est pas morte! s’écria Julien, et il tomba à genoux, pleurant à chaudes larmes.","The jailer obeys. Hardly had the door been closed: Great God! she is not dead! cried Julien, and he fell on his knees, weeping hot tears.","The jailer left. The door had barely closed behind him: “Good God! She’s not dead!” Julien exclaimed. And he fell to his knees, weeping hot tears.","The gaoler obeyed. Scarcely had the door shut, than Julien exclaimed: “Great God, she is not dead,” and he fell on his knees, shedding hot tears."
"Le désordre fut à son comble, comme disent les journaux en parlant de la chambre. Au bout d’un gros quart d’heure, le silence se rétablit un peu.","The disorder was at its height, as the newspapers say of the chamber. After a good quarter of an hour, the silence is restored a little.","Confusion was at its height, as the newspapers say, reporting on Parliament. After a long quarter of an hour, silence was partially restored.","The disorder was at its height, as the papers say when they talk of the Chamber. At the end of a long quarter of an hour a little quiet was established."
"Trois jours après, Julien avait trouvé le prétexte dont il eût dû se munir dès le premier jour; ce prétexte était une calomnie, mais qu’importe? Il avoua au curé, avec beaucoup d’hésitation, qu’une raison qu’il ne pouvait lui expliquer parce qu’elle nuirait à un tiers, l’avait détourné tout d’abord de l’union projetée. C’était accuser la conduite d’Élisa. M. Chélan trouva dans ses manières un certain feu tout mondain, bien différent de celui qui eût dû animer un jeune lévite.","Three days later, Julien had found the pretext with which he should have provided himself from the first day; this pretext was a calumny, but what does it matter? He confessed to the parish priest, with much hesitation, that a reason which he could not explain to him because it would harm a third party, had turned him away from the projected union at first. This was to blame Elisa's conduct. M. Chélan found in his manners a certain worldly fire, very different from that which should have animated a young Levite.","Three days later, Julien invented the excuse he should have found the very first day: it was slanderous, but what did that matter? He swore to the old priest, with much pretense of hesitation, that there was something he could not explain, because it would be damaging to a third party, which had from the first dissuaded him from agreeing to the marriage. It was as good as an accusation against Elisa. Monsieur Chélan felt a certain worldly warmth underlying his behavior—not what ought to be inspiring a prospective priest.","Three days later, Julien found the excuse with which he ought to have been prepared on the first day; the excuse was a piece of calumny, but what did it matter? He confessed to the curé, with a great deal of hesitation, that he had been persuaded from the suggested union by a reason he could not explain, inasmuch as it tended to damage a third party. This was equivalent to impeaching Elisa’s conduct. M. Chélan found that his manner betrayed a certain worldly fire which was very different from that which ought to have animated a young acolyte."
"Ce jeune sot, se dit-il bientôt, s’est fait une sorte de réputation dans ma maison, le Valenod peut le prendre chez lui, ou bien il épousera Élisa, et dans les deux cas au fond du coeur, il pourra se moquer de moi.","This young fool, he soon said to himself, has made a kind of reputation in my house, the Valenod can take him home, or else he will marry Élisa, and in both cases, from the bottom of his heart, he can laugh. of me.","“This young fool,” he said to himself after a moment, “has after a fashion earned himself a reputation, here in my house, and Valenod might take him into his, or else he might well marry Elisa, and in both cases, deep down in his heart, he might scoff at me.” Despite his prudent reflections, Monsieur de Rênal’s dissatisfaction did not blaze any the less brightly in the stream of vulgar comments that followed; they gradually began to irritate Julien.","“The young fool,” he said to himself shortly afterwards, “has won a kind of reputation in my house. That man Valenod may take him into his family, or he may quite well marry Elisa, and in either case, he will be able to have the laugh of me in his heart.” In spite of the wisdom of these reflections, M. de Rênal’s dissatisfaction did not fail to vent itself any the less by a string of coarse insults which gradually irritated Julien."
"Cette idée effaça toutes les autres. Bientôt après, Julien fut rappelé à lui-même par les marques d’assentiment du public. L’avocat venait de terminer sa plaidoirie. Julien se souvint qu’il était convenable de lui serrer la main. Le temps avait passé rapidement.","This idea erased all the others. Soon after, Julien was called back to himself by the marks of assent of the public. The lawyer had just finished his argument. Julien remembered that it was proper to shake his hand. Time had passed quickly.","This idea erased everything else from his mind. But not too long afterward, Julien was brought back to himself, hearing the sounds of public approval. His lawyer had just ended his speech. Julien reminded himself that it was proper to shake the lawyer’s hand. The time had gone by very quickly.",This idea effaced all others. Shortly afterwards Julien was brought back to reality by the public’s manifestation of applause. The advocate had just finished his speech. Julien remembered that it was good form to shake hands with him. The time had passed rapidly.
