"Qu'est-ce qu'un duel avec le plus terrible des bretteurs à côté d'un combat avec le plus génial des prestidigitateurs? Moi-même, je me faisais difficilement à cette pensée que j'allais entrer en lutte avec un homme qui n'est visible au fond que lorsqu'il le veut et qui, en revanche, voit tout autour de lui, quand toute chose pour vous reste obscure!... Avec un homme dont la science bizarre, la subtilité, l'imagination et l'adresse lui permettent de disposer de toutes les forces naturelles, combinées pour créer à vos yeux ou à vos oreilles l'illusion qui vous perd!... Et cela, dans les dessous de l'Opéra, c'est-à-dire au pays même de la fantasmagorie! Peut-on imaginer cela sans frémir? Peut-on seulement avoir une idée de ce qui pourrait arriver aux yeux ou aux oreilles d'un habitant de l'Opéra, si on avait enfermé dans l'Opéra—dans ses cinq dessous et ses vingt-cinq dessus—un Robert-Houdin féroce et «rigolo», tantôt qui se moque et tantôt qui hait! tantôt qui vide les poches et tantôt qui tue!... Pensez-vous à cela: «Combattre l'amateur de trappes?»—Mon Dieu! en a-t-il fabriqué chez nous, dans tous nos palais, de ces étonnantes trappes pivotantes qui sont les meilleures des trappes!—Combattre l'amateur de trappes au pays des trappes!...","What is a duel with the most terrible of swordsmen next to a fight with the most brilliant of conjurers? Myself, I had difficulty getting used to this thought that I was going to enter into a struggle with a man who is only visible deep down when he wants to and who, on the other hand, sees everything around him, when everything for remains obscure to you!... With a man whose bizarre science, subtlety, imagination and address allow him to dispose of all the natural forces, combined to create in your eyes or in your ears the illusion that lose!... And that, in the underbelly of the Opera, that is to say in the very land of phantasmagoria! Can we imagine that without shuddering? Can we even have an idea of what could happen to the eyes or the ears of an inhabitant of the Opera, if we had locked up in the Opera—in his five underwear and his twenty-five tops—a Robert-Houdin ferocious and ""funny"", sometimes mocking and sometimes hating! sometimes who empties the pockets and sometimes who kills!... Do you think of that: ""To fight the amateur of traps?""—My God! has he made among us, in all our palaces, those astonishing swinging traps which are the best of traps!—Fight the amateur of traps in the land of traps!...","Fighting a duel with the most reckless desperado was nothing compared to battling with one of the world’s greatest illusionists! I myself was daunted by the prospect of fighting a man who was only visible when he so wished, but saw everything while you yourself remained in the dark – a man whose uncanny science, cleverness, imagination and skill enabled him to draw upon all the resources of nature to deceive your eyes and ears, and lure you to your death – and all this beneath the stage of the Paris Opera House, the very home of phantasmagoria! How could one contemplate such a prospect without trembling to the core? Imagine pitting yourself against someone as talented as Robert-Houdin, but who mocks and hates by turns – empties pockets one minute only to kill the next – in a theatre with no fewer than five levels under the stage and twenty-five above!5 I was about to fight the Master of the Traps! I remembered all those pivoting trap doors – so effective, so deadly – he had installed in the palaces of Persia. And now it was in a world of traps that I was to confront the Master of the Traps!","What is a duel with the most fearsome bully compared with going up against the most brilliant of illusionists? Even I was unnerved by the thought of doing battle with a man who was visible only when he wanted to be but could see everything around him whereas you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face!… a man whose fantastic knowledge of science, subtle mind, imagination and sheer skill enabled him to exploit the forces of nature and combine them in ways that confuse the eyes and ears with deadly trickery!… And where better to do this than in the bowels of the Opera House, that land of dreams and make-believe! Can you imagine it without quaking? Can you have any idea of the effect on the eyes and ears of anyone sallying forth to do battle on the home territory—the Opera, with its five lower levels and twenty-five upper levels—of a kind of diabolical Robert-Houdin with a twisted sense of humour who would joke and hate by turns and steal and kill at will!… Ask yourself this: ‘How would I fight the King of Traps?’ By God! Did he not come to Persia and build inside our palaces astounding swivelling walls and trapdoors which have never been bettered? … How could anyone expect to beat the King of Traps in the Kingdom of Traps?","The little viscount is a brave fellow, but he knew hardly anything about his adversary; and it was so much the better. My great fear was that he was already somewhere near us, preparing the Punjab lasso. No one knows better than he how to throw the Punjab lasso, for he is the king of stranglers even as he is the prince of conjurors."

"Ainsi les heures passaient très lentes; il pouvait être onze heures et demie de la nuit quand il entendit distinctement marcher dans la chambre voisine de la sienne. C'était un pas léger, furtif. Christine ne s'était donc pas couchée? Sans raisonner ses gestes, le jeune homme s'habilla à la hâte, en prenant garde de faire le moindre bruit. Et, prêt à tout, il attendit. Prêt à quoi? Est-ce qu'il savait? Son cœur bondit quand il entendit la porte de Christine tourner lentement sur ses gonds. Où allait-elle à cette heure où tout reposait dans Perros? Il entr'ouvrit tout doucement sa porte et put voir, dans un rayon de lune, la forme blanche de Christine qui glissait précautionneusement dans le corridor. Elle atteignit l'escalier; elle descendit et, lui, au-dessus d'elle, se pencha sur la rampe. Soudain, il entendit deux voix qui s'entretenaient rapidement.

La forme blanche de Christine se dressait sur le quai désert.","Thus the hours passed very slowly; it might have been half-past eleven at night when he distinctly heard footsteps in the room next to his. It was a light, furtive step. Christine hadn't gone to bed then? Without reasoning his gestures, the young man dressed hastily, taking care to make the slightest noise. And, ready for anything, he waited. Ready for what? Did he know? His heart leapt when he heard Christine's door turn slowly on its hinges. Where was she going at this hour when everything rested in Perros? He opened his door very slowly and could see, in a ray of moonlight, the white form of Christine sliding cautiously down the corridor. She reached the stairs; she climbed down and he, above her, leaned over the banister. Suddenly, he heard two voices talking rapidly. A phrase came to him: ""Don't lose the key."" It was the voice of the hostess. Downstairs, the door was opened which gave on to the harbour. We closed it. And everything went back to calm. Raoul immediately returned to his room and ran to his window, which he opened. The white form of Christine stood on the deserted quay.","The hours passed very slowly. It was about half-past eleven when he distinctly heard light, furtive footsteps in the room next to his. Christine was not in her bed, then!

His heart leaped when he heard Christine’s door slowly turn on its hinges. Where could she be going at this hour, when the whole of Perros was asleep? He quietly opened his door and glimpsed her white figure cautiously slipping down the corridor in the moonlight. She reached the staircase and, as she descended, Raoul leaned over the banister. He heard two hurried voices. He only caught one sentence: ‘Don’t lose the key.’ It was the landlady’s voice. Someone opened the door that gave on to the waterfront and locked it again. All went quiet. Raoul rushed back to his room and quickly opened the window. The white figure of Christine stood on the deserted quayside.","The hours passed slowly. It must have been half past eleven when he distinctly heard someone moving in the room next to his. The footsteps were light and furtive. Hadn’t Christine gone to bed? Without thinking what he was doing, Raoul dressed quickly, taking care to make no noise. Then, ready for anything, he waited. But ready for what? He had no idea! His heart missed a beat when he heard Christine’s door creak on its hinges. Where could she be going at this time of night when everyone in Perros was asleep? He half opened his door and in a patch of moonlight glimpsed the white figure of Christine gliding cautiously along the corridor. She reached the stairs and went down them. Above her, he leaned over the banister. Suddenly he heard two voices talking urgently. He caught the words: ‘Don’t lose the key.’ It was Mme Tricard’s voice. Then the door overlooking the harbour opened and then closed. Everything went quiet once more. Raoul hurried back to his room, ran to the window and opened it. The white figure of Christine stood on the deserted jetty.","It was about half-past eleven when he distinctly heard some one moving, with a light, stealthy step, in the room next to his. Then Christine had not gone to bed! Without troubling for a reason, Raoul dressed, taking care not to make a sound, and waited. Waited for what? How could he tell? But his heart thumped in his chest when he heard Christine ’s door turn slowly on its hinges. Where could she be going, at this hour, when everyone was fast asleep at Perros? Softly opening the door, he saw Christine’s white form, in the moonlight, slipping along the passage. She went down the stairs and he leaned over the baluster above her. Suddenly he heard two voices in rapid conversation. He caught one sentence: “Don’t lose the key.” It was the landlady’s voice. The door facing the sea was opened and locked again. Then all was still. Raoul ran back to his room and threw back the window. Christine’s white form stood on the deserted quay."

"Enfin, je puis dire, en toute connaissance de cause, au lecteur: «Visitez un jour l'Opéra, demandez à vous y promener en paix sans cicérone stupide, entrez dans la loge n° 5 et frappez sur l'énorme colonne qui sépare cette loge de l'avant-scène; frappez avec votre canne ou avec votre poing et écoutez... jusqu'à hauteur de votre tête: la colonne sonne le creux! Et après cela, ne vous étonnez point qu'elle ait pu être habitée par la voix du Fantôme; il y a, dans cette colonne, de la place pour deux hommes. Que si vous vous étonnez que lors des phénomènes de la loge n°5 nul ne se soit retourné vers cette colonne, n'oubliez pas qu'elle offre l'aspect du marbre massif et que la voix qui était enfermée semblait plutôt venir du côté opposé (car la voix du fantôme ventriloque venait d'où il voulait). La colonne est travaillée, sculptée, fouillée et trifouillée par le ciseau de l'artiste. Je ne désespère pas de découvrir un jour le morceau de sculpture qui devait s'abaisser et se relever à volonté, pour laisser un libre et mystérieux passage à la correspondance du Fantôme avec Mme Giry et à ses générosités. Certes, tout cela, que j'ai vu, senti, palpé, n'est rien à côté de ce qu'en réalité un être énorme et fabuleux comme Erik a dû créer dans le mystère d'un monument comme celui de l'Opéra, mais je donnerais toutes ces découvertes pour celle qu'il m'a été donné de faire, devant l'administrateur lui-même, dans le bureau du directeur, à quelques centimètres du fauteuil: une trappe, de la largeur de la lame du parquet, de la longueur d'un avant-bras, pas plus... une trappe qui se rabat comme le couvercle d'un coffret, une trappe par où je vois sortir une main qui travaille avec dextérité dans le pan d'un habit à queue-de-morue qui traîne...","Finally, I can say, with full knowledge of the facts, to the reader: ""Visit the Opera one day, ask to walk there in peace without a stupid cicerone, enter box 5 and knock on the enormous column which separates this front-stage box; strike with your cane or with your fist and listen... up to the height of your head: the column sounds hollow! And after that, don't be surprised that she could have been inhabited by the voice of the Phantom; there is room in this column for two men. That if you are surprised that during the phenomena of lodge n°5 no one turned towards this column, do not forget that it offers the appearance of solid marble and that the voice which was locked up seemed rather to come from the side opposite (because the voice of the ghost ventriloquist came from where he wanted). The column is worked, sculpted, excavated and tampered with by the artist's chisel. I do not despair of discovering one day the piece of sculpture which was to be lowered and raised at will, to leave a free and mysterious passage to the correspondence of the Phantom with Mme Giry and to his generosity. Of course, all of this, which I saw, felt, touched, is nothing compared to what in reality an enormous and fabulous being like Erik had to create in the mystery of a monument like that of the Opera. , but I would give all these discoveries for the one I had the privilege of making, in front of the administrator himself, in the director's office, a few centimeters from the armchair: a trap door, the width of the slat of the floor, the length of a forearm, no more... a hatch that folds down like the lid of a box, a hatch through which I see a hand coming out working with dexterity in the tail of a coat cod-tail trailing...","Finally I invite the reader to visit the Paris Opera House in person. Ask permission to wander at your leisure in the playhouse without the escort of some ignorant cicerone. Enter Box Five and tap the enormous pillar that separates that box from the stage box; knock on it with your fist or your stick and listen carefully: you will notice that the pillar sounds hollow up to a man’s height. Hence my suggestion that the Phantom’s voice actually issued from that pillar: inside there is more than enough room to accommodate a man. Should you be amazed that no one before me has ever thought of examining this pillar, bear in mind that it has the appearance of solid marble, and that the voice contained therein seemed to come from the opposite direction (as we know, Erik was an expert ventriloquist and could throw his voice wherever he chose). The pillar is embellished with rich, elaborate ornamentation, and some day I hope to discover the particular motif that can be raised and lowered at will, and through which the Phantom was able to leave instructions to Mme Giry and reward her for her services. I imagine that the little I have seen, sensed or guessed of the Phantom’s work cannot compare with what this prodigious, fantastic character managed to achieve within the vast and mysterious edifice of the Paris Opera House; but I would readily trade all these discoveries for the one I was fortunate to make, in the presence of the administrator himself, inside the directorial office. Within a few inches of the desk-chair, I found a trap, the width of a floor-board and at most the length of a man’s forearm, whose door opened like the lid of a casket, and through which I could see in my mind’s eye a hand appear and adroitly reach for the back-pocket of a coat.","Finally, I can say to the reader without fear of contradiction: Visit the Opera one of these days, ask to be allowed to wander around alone, without some ignorant guide, go into Box 5 and tap the enormous column which separates it from the proscenium arch. Tap it with cane or fist and listen at head height: it will sound hollow! You won’t be surprised to learn that it was once the channel for the voice of the Phantom. Inside that column, there is room enough for two men, let alone one. If you are astonished that during all those mysterious occurrences in Box 5 no one ever took a moment to examine the column, remember that it looks like solid marble and that the voice which emerged from it seemed to come from the opposite wall (naturally, Erik being a ventriloquist, could make his voice come from whatever direction he chose). The column is ornately carved, having been worked and reworked by the sculptor’s chisel, and I have yet to locate the specific feature which was designed to be raised or lowered and thus facilitate the Phantom’s mysterious conversations and dealings with Mme Giry. * But everything I have managed to see, feel and touch represents just one small part of what a being as colossal and phenomenal as Erik must have secretly built inside an edifice as monumental as the Paris Opera House. Still, I would exchange all its remaining hidden mysteries for the one particular discovery I was privileged to make, in the Director’s office, in his presence. Only centimetres from his desk chair, I found a panel, no longer than a wooden floor block or a man’s forearm… a flap which closes like the lid of a chest, through which I could imagine a hand appear and skilfully rummage through the dangling tails of a man’s evening-dress coat…","He will find that the column sounds hollow. After that, do not be astonished by the suggestion that it was occupied by the voice of the ghost: there is room inside the column for two men. If you are surprised that, when the various incidents occurred, no one turned round to look at the column, you must remember that it presented the appearance of solid marble, and that the voice contained in it seemed rather to come from the opposite side, for, as we have seen, the ghost was an expert ventriloquist. The column was elaborately carved and decorated with the sculptor’s chisel; and I do not despair of one day discovering the ornament that could be raised or lowered at will, so as to admit of the ghost’s mysterious correspondence with Mame Giry and of his generosity. However, all these discoveries are nothing, to my mind, compared with that which I was able to make, in the presence of the acting-manager, in the managers’ office, within a couple of inches from the desk-chair, and which consisted of a trap-door, the width of a board in the flooring and the length of a man’s forearm and no longer; a trap-door that falls back like the lid of a box; a trap-door through which I can see a hand come and dexterously fumble at the pocket of a swallow-tail coat."
"Raoul vit Christine tendre les bras vers la voix, comme elle avait fait dans le cimetière de Perros, vers le violon invisible qui jouait La Résurrection de Lazare...","Raoul saw Christine stretch out her arms towards the voice, as she had done in the cemetery at Perros, towards the invisible violin playing The Resurrection of Lazare...",Raoul saw Christine hold out her arms to the voice as she had held them out to the invisible violin playing Lazarus in the churchyard at Perros.,"Raoul saw Christine reach out her hands to the voice, just as she had done in the cemetery at Perros when the unseen violinist had played The Resurrection of Lazarus…","Raoul saw Christine stretch out her arms to the voice as she had done, in Perros church-yard, to the invisible violin playing The Resurrection of Lazarus and nothing could describe the passion with which the voice sang:"

—Raoul!... Raoul!,"""Raoul!... Raoul!""",‘Raoul! Raoul!’,‘Raoul! Raoul!’,"When you hear the monster, warn us!” Then Christine gave way to fear."
"Ce soir-là, la confusion n'avait jamais été plus complète, mais Raoul n'avait jamais été moins timide. Il écartait d'une épaule solide tout ce qui lui faisait obstacle, ne s'occupant point de ce qui se disait autour de lui, n'essayant point de comprendre les propos effarés des machinistes. Il était uniquement préoccupé du désir de voir celle dont la voix magique lui avait arraché le cœur. Oui, il sentait bien que son pauvre cœur tout neuf ne lui appartenait plus. Il avait bien essayé de le défendre depuis le jour où Christine, qu'il avait connue toute petite, lui était réapparue. Il avait ressenti en face d'elle une émotion très douce qu'il avait voulu chasser, à la réflexion, car il s'était juré, tant il avait le respect de lui-même et de sa foi, de n'aimer que celle qui serait sa femme, et il ne pouvait, une seconde, naturellement, songer à épouser une chanteuse; mais voilà qu'à l'émotion très douce avait succédé une sensation atroce. Sensation? Sentiment? Il y avait là-dedans du physique et du moral. Sa poitrine lui faisait mal, comme, si on la lui avait ouverte pour lui prendre le cœur. Il sentait là un creux affreux, un vide réel qui ne pourrait jamais plus être rempli que par le cœur de l'autre! Ce sont là des événements d'une psychologie particulière qui, paraît-il, ne peuvent être compris que de ceux qui ont été frappés, par l'amour, de ce coup étrange appelé, dans le langage courant, «coup de foudre».","That evening, the confusion had never been more complete, but Raoul had never been less shy. With a solid shoulder he brushed aside everything that stood in his way, paying no attention to what was being said around him, not trying to understand the bewildered remarks of the stagehands. He was only preoccupied with the desire to see the one whose magical voice had ripped his heart out. Yes, he felt that his poor new heart no longer belonged to him. He had tried to defend him since the day Christine, whom he had known as a child, had reappeared. He had felt in front of her a very sweet emotion that he had wanted to drive away, on reflection, because he had sworn to himself, so much he had the respect of himself and of his faith, to love only that who would be his wife, and he couldn't, of course, for a second dream of marrying a singer; but now the very sweet emotion had been succeeded by an atrocious sensation. Sensation? Feeling? There was both physical and moral in it. His chest ached, as if someone had cut it open to take out his heart. He felt a terrible hollow there, a real emptiness that could never be filled except by the heart of the other! These are events of a particular psychology which, it seems, can only be understood by those who have been struck by love with that strange blow called, in common parlance, ""love at first sight.""","Never had the theatre been in such turmoil, nor Raoul so bold. He purposefully shouldered his way forward, ignoring what was being said around him, not even trying to make sense of the machinists’ startled comments. His desire to see the woman whose magic voice had captured his heart was his sole concern. He felt that his poor, pristine heart no longer belonged to him. Since Christine, whom he had known as a little girl, had reappeared, he had tried very hard, out of self-respect and faith, to defend himself against the tender feelings that she inspired in him; he had sworn to love only the woman that he would make his wife and, naturally, marrying a singer was out of the question. Now those tender feelings had given way to pain. Sensations? Sentiments? His response was at once physical and emotional. His chest hurt, as if it had been cut open and his heart removed. Inside he felt only a terrible hollowness, a genuine emptiness that could only be relieved by his winning the heart of the one he loved. The psychology of love is such that experiences of this kind can best be understood, it seems, by those to whom love, as the French coup de foudre suggests, has revealed itself with the unexpected abruptness of lightning.","That night, the chaos had never been so complete, but Raoul had never been less shy. Using his solid shoulder, he brushed aside anybody and anything that got in his way, paying no attention to the comments people made around him, and not even trying to understand what the flustered stagehands were saying. All he wanted was to see the woman whose magical voice had pierced his heart. Yes, he had the feeling that his poor, untried heart no longer belonged to him. He had tried, truly he had, to keep up his defences from the first moment Christine, whom he had known since she was a little girl, had come back into his life. In her presence he had felt sweet emotions which he had thought about and tried to chase away, for his self-respect and his religious upbringing had made him swear to love no woman except the one who would become his wife, and naturally there was no question that he should ever think of marrying a singer. But then those sweet emotions had been followed by a terrible sensation. Was it a sensation or was it a feeling? It was half physical, half emotion. He had an ache in his chest, as though someone had cut it open and removed his heart. It felt hollow, as if it were an empty space which could never be filled except by another heart. These are psychological symptoms of a particular kind which are said to be comprehensible only to those who have been similarly smitten and been struck by that strange lightning bolt called in common parlance: love at first sight.","They reached the stage and pushed through the crowd of gentlemen, scene-shifters, supers and chorus-girls, Raoul leading the way, feeling that his heart no longer belonged to him, his face set with passion, while Count Philippe followed him with difficulty and continued to smile."

"Raoul eut le temps de s'étonner une fois de plus—sans, du reste, faire aucune nouvelle observation, aucune! car en vérité, ce n'était pas le moment—de s'étonner, dis-je, en silence, de cette extraordinaire conception de la défense personnelle qui consistait à garder son pistolet dans sa poche pendant que la main restait toute prête à s'en servir comme si le pistolet était encore dans la main, à hauteur de l'œil; position d'attente du commandant de «feu!» dans le duel de cette époque.","Raoul had time to be astonished once more—without, moreover, making any new observation, none! for in truth, this was not the time—to wonder, I said silently, at this extraordinary conception of personal defense which consisted in keeping one's pistol in one's pocket while the hand remained quite ready to s use it as if the pistol were still in the hand, at eye level; waiting position of the commander of ""fire!"" in the duel of that time.",Raoul puzzled once more over this but refrained from making any comment. Now was not the time to question the Persian’s extraordinary notion of self-defence that consisted in keeping one’s pistol in one’s pocket while holding oneself ready to fire.,"Even so, he still kept his arm well up!… Raoul used the moment to wonder—though without adding any further comment, for this was hardly the time—to wonder, as I say, in silence at this strange version of self-defence which consisted of keeping your pistol in your pocket while your gun hand stayed free and ready to shoot as if you actually were holding the weapon in your hand at eye level, in the position required of duellists in those days as they waited for the signal to fire.","And Raoul, remembering the Persian’s observation—“I know these pistols can be relied upon”—was more and more astonished, wondering why any one should be so gratified at being able to rely upon a pistol which he did not intend to use!"

"Voilà donc un événement que M. Moncharmin trouve naturel. Un homme est pendu au bout d'une corde, on va le décrocher, la corde a disparu. Oh! M. Moncharmin a trouvé une explication bien simple. Écoutez-le: C'était l'heure de la danse, et coryphées et rats avaient bien vite pris leurs précautions contre le mauvais œil. Un point, c'est tout. Vous voyez d'ici le corps de ballet descendant l'échelle du portant et se partageant la corde de pendu en moins de temps qu'il ne faut pour l'écrire. Ce n'est pas sérieux. Quand je songe, au contraire, à l'endroit exact où le corps a été retrouvé—dans le troisième dessous de la scène—j'imagine qu'il pouvait y avoir quelque part un intérêt à ce que cette corde disparût après qu'elle eut fait sa besogne et nous verrons plus tard si j'ai tort d'avoir cette imagination-là.","Here, then, is an event that M. Moncharmin finds natural. A man is hanging from the end of a rope, we are going to unhook him, the rope has disappeared. Oh! Mr. Moncharmin has found a very simple explanation. Listen to him: It was time for the dance, and coryphees and rats had quickly taken their precautions against the evil eye. And that's all. From here, you can see the corps de ballet descending the ladder and sharing the hangman's rope in less time than it takes to write it. This is not serious. When I think, on the contrary, of the exact place where the body was found—in the third lower part of the scene—I imagine that there could be an interest somewhere in this rope disappearing after it had done its job and we will see later if I am wrong to have that imagination.","This is what M. Moncharmin termed ‘natural’ circumstances: a man is swinging at the end of a rope; they rush to cut him down; the rope has disappeared. Oh, Moncharmin’s explanation was straightforward enough! Listen to him: ‘The dancers were performing that night and took immediate precautions to procure a charm to ward off the Evil Eye.’ That was it! Picture the dancers scampering down the ladder, cutting up the deadly rope and sharing the pieces among themselves in less time than it took me to write about it! Nonsense! Personally, pondering on the event and the particular spot where the body was discovered – down on the third mezzanine – I believe that the vanishing of the rope, after it had done its murderous job, served some purpose; and time will show whether I am right.","In other words, it was a circumstance in which M. Moncharmin found nothing untoward. A man is found hanging at the end of a rope. But when help arrives to cut him down, the rope has disappeared: odd. Of course, M. Moncharmin came up with a simple enough explanation. This is what he said: ‘It was nearly time for the ballet and all the girls, seniors and beginners, had been quick to protect themselves against the evil eye.’ There, are you following? You can see it now, the whole of the company clambering down the frame ladder and cutting up and dividing a hanged man’s rope among themselves in less time than it takes to write it down. It’s laughable. When on the other hand I think of the exact spot where the body was found—under the stage, three levels down—I can imagine that there might just be someone somewhere who might want the rope to vanish into thin air after doing its deadly work. We will see in due course if I am right in imagining such a thing.","So this is an event which M. Moncharmin thinks natural. A man hangs at the end of a rope; they go to cut him down; the rope has disappeared. Oh, M. Moncharmin found a very simple explanation! Listen to him: “It was just after the ballet; and leaders and dancing-girls lost no time in taking their precautions against the evil eye.” There you are! Picture the corps de ballet scuttling down the Jacob’s ladder and dividing the suicide’s rope among themselves in less time than it takes to write! When, on the other hand, I think of the exact spot where the body was discovered—the third cellar underneath the stage—I imagine that somebody must have been interested in seeing that the rope disappeared after it had effected its purpose; and time will show if I am wrong."

It covered seventeen floors, from the lowest cellar to the roof, and was inhabited by an army of her subjects.

"... Avec quelles armes donc, si ce n'étaient celles de la musique? Oui, oui, plus il y songeait, plus il se persuadait que c'était de ce côté qu'il découvrirait la vérité. Avait-il oublié le ton dont, à Perros, elle lui avait appris qu'elle avait reçu la visite de l'envoyé céleste? Et l'histoire même de Christine, dans ces derniers temps, ne devait-elle point l'aider à éclairer les ténèbres où il se débattait? Avait-il ignoré le désespoir qui s'était emparé d'elle après la mort de son père et le dégoût qu'elle avait eu alors de toutes les choses de la vie, même de son art? Au Conservatoire, elle avait passé comme une pauvre machine chantante, dépourvue d'âme. Et, tout à coup, elle s'était réveillée, comme sous le souffle d'une intervention divine. L'ange de la musique était venu! Elle chante Marguerite de Faust et triomphe!... L'Ange de la musique!... Qui donc, qui donc se fait passer à ses yeux pour ce merveilleux génie?... Qui donc, renseigné sur la légende chère au vieux Daaé, en use à ce point que la jeune fille n'est plus entre ses mains qu'un instrument sans défense qu'il fait vibrer à son gré?","... With what weapons then, if not those of music? Yes, yes, the more he thought about it, the more he convinced himself that it was from there that he would discover the truth. Had he forgotten the tone in which, at Perros, she had informed him that she had received a visit from the celestial envoy? And couldn't Christine's own story, in recent times, help him to illuminate the darkness in which he struggled? Had he ignored the despair that had seized her after her father's death and the disgust she had felt then for all things in life, even for her art? At the Conservatory, she had passed like a poor singing machine, devoid of soul. And suddenly she woke up, as if under the breath of divine intervention. The angel of music had come! She sings Marguerite de Faust and triumphs!... The Angel of Music!... Who then, who passes herself off in her eyes as this marvelous genius?... Who then, informed about the legend dear to the old Daaé, uses it to such an extent that the young girl is no longer in his hands but a defenseless instrument that he makes vibrate at will?","By what means indeed, but those of music? The more he pondered over this, the more he convinced himself that the truth lay there. Had he forgotten the tone of her voice when she told him, at Perros, that she had been visited by a heavenly spirit? Was there some clue to the dark, prevailing mystery in Christine’s recent past? Had he given too little consideration to her sorrow at her father’s death and her ensuing disaffection with everything, including her art? At the Conservatoire, she had been but a poor, soulless, singing automaton. And then suddenly she had come to life as if through divine intervention. Visited by the Angel of Music! She sang Marguerite in Faust and triumphed! The Angel of Music! Who could make her believe that he was indeed this fabulous spirit? Who could know of the legend of Little Lotte and make use of it in such a way that Christine was, in his hands, no more than a helpless instrument to be played at will?","And what weapon if not music? Yes, of course! The more he thought about it, the more convinced he was that the truth lay there. Had he forgotten how her voice had sounded at Perros when she told him about the visit from a celestial messenger? And surely what had happened to her recently should help him answer the shadowy questions he was grappling with? Had he underestimated her grief for her dead father and forgotten her weary rejection of everything that is life, even her art? At the Conservatoire, she had been no more than a mechanical, soulless voice. Then, all of a sudden, she had woken up, as if she had been breathed on by the divine afflatus. The Angel of Music had come to her! She had sung Marguerite in Faust and scored a triumph!… So who exactly had managed to convince her he was a magical maestro? Who knew about M. Daaé’s favourite legend and was exploiting it to the point where she had become a helpless instrument in his hands which he plucked at will?","By what means indeed but that of music? He knew Christine’s story. After her father’s death, she acquired a distaste of everything in life, including her art. She went through the conservatorie like a poor soulless singing-machine. And, suddenly, she awoke as though through the intervention of a god. The Angel of Music appeared upon the scene! She sang Margarita in Faust and triumphed! ... The Angel of Music! ... For three months the Angel of Music had been giving Christine lessons...."
"Réponse.—Non, monsieur, non, non. Cependant, j'arrivai derrière elle en négligeant d'étouffer le bruit de mes pas. Je ne demandais alors qu'une chose, c'est qu'elle se retournât, qu'elle me vît et qu'elle me reconnut. Je venais de me dire, en effet, que ma poursuite était tout à fait incorrecte et que la façon d'espionnage à laquelle je me livrais était indigne de moi. Mais elle ne sembla point m'entendre et, de fait, elle agit comme si je n'avais pas été là. Elle quitta tranquillement le quai et puis, tout à coup, remonta rapidement le chemin. L'horloge de l'église venait de sonner minuit moins un quart, et il me parut que le son de l'heure avait déterminé la hâte de sa course, car elle se prit presque à courir. Ainsi arriva-t-elle à la porte du cimetière.","Answer.—No, sir, no, no. However, I came up behind her, neglecting to muffle the sound of my footsteps. I only asked one thing then, that she turn around, see me and recognize me. I had just said to myself, in fact, that my pursuit was completely incorrect and that the manner of espionage in which I indulged was unworthy of me. But she didn't seem to hear me and, in fact, she acts as if I hadn't been there. She quietly left the platform and then, suddenly, quickly went up the path. The church clock had just struck a quarter to midnight, and it seemed to me that the sound of the hour had determined the haste of her run, for she almost took to running. Thus she arrived at the gate of the cemetery.","Answer: ‘No, inspector , she did not, although I made no effort to deaden the sound of my footsteps when I caught up with her. In fact, I was only too anxious that she should look back, see me and acknowledge my presence. I realized that my following her was quite wrong – spying on her in such a fashion was unworthy of me; but she seemed not to hear me and acted as if I were not there. She left the quayside at a leisurely pace and then suddenly hurried up the road. The church clock had just struck a quarter to twelve. I thought this might be the reason for her sudden haste, for she began almost to run and continued in this fashion until she reached the graveyard.’","‘Ans. No, sir, she did not. I made no attempt to muffle the sound of my footsteps and I soon caught up with her. I asked just one thing of her, that she turn round, look at me and know it was me.

In fact, she behaved exactly as if I wasn’t there. She retraced her steps along the jetty and then suddenly headed very fast up the road. The church clock had just struck a quarter to twelve and I had the feeling that this was the reason why she was walking so quickly , for now she almost broke into a run. In this way she arrived at the entrance to the cemetery. ‘Qu.","R. “No, monsieur, no, although, when walking behind her, I took no pains to deaden the sound of my footsteps. In fact, I was anxious that she should turn round and see me. I realized that I had no excuse for following her and that this way of spying on her was unworthy of me. But she seemed not to hear me and acted exactly as though I were not there. She quietly left the quay and then suddenly walked quickly up the road. The church-clock had struck a quarter to twelve and I thought that this must have made her hurry, for she began almost to run and continued hastening until she came to the church.”"

"Combien de temps restai-je sans connaissance? Je ne saurais le dire. Quand je rouvris les yeux, nous étions toujours, l'homme noir et moi, au sein des ténèbres. Une lanterne sourde, posée par terre, éclairait le jaillissement d'une fontaine. L'eau, clapotante, sortie de la muraille, disparaissait presque aussitôt sous le sol sur lequel j'étais étendue; ma tête reposait sur le genou de l'homme au manteau et au masque noir et mon silencieux compagnon me rafraîchissait les tempes avec un soin, une attention, une délicatesse qui me parurent plus horribles à supporter que la brutalité de son enlèvement de tout à l'heure. Ses mains, si légères fussent-elles, n'en sentaient pas moins la mort. Je les repoussai, mais sans force. Je demandai dans un souffle: «Qui êtes-vous? où est la Voix?» Seul, un soupir me répondit. Tout à coup, un souffle chaud me passa sur le visage et vaguement, dans les ténèbres, à côté de la forme noire de l'homme, je distinguai une forme blanche. La forme noire me souleva et me déposa sur la forme blanche. Et aussitôt, un joyeux hennissement vint frapper mes oreilles stupéfaites et je murmurai: «César!» La bête tressaillit. Mon ami, j'étais à demi couchée sur une selle et j'avais reconnu le cheval blanc du Prophète, que j'avais gâté si souvent, de friandises. Or, un soir, le bruit s'était répandu dans le théâtre que cette bête avait disparu et qu'elle avait été volée par le fantôme de l'Opéra. Moi, je croyais à la Voix; je n'avais jamais cru au fantôme, et voilà cependant que je me demandai en frissonnant si je n'étais pas la prisonnière du fantôme! J'appelai, du fond du cœur, la Voix à mon secours, car jamais je ne me serais imaginée que la Voix et le fantôme étaient tout un! Vous avez entendu parler du fantôme de l'Opéra, Raoul?","How long was I unconscious? I would not know how to say it. When I opened my eyes again, the black man and I were still in the darkness. A dull lantern, placed on the ground, lit up the spouting of a fountain. The water, lapping, coming out of the wall, almost immediately disappeared under the ground on which I was stretched out; my head rested on the knee of the man in the coat and the black mask, and my silent companion cooled my temples with a care, an attention, a delicacy which seemed to me more horrible to bear than the brutality of his kidnapping just now. 'hour. Her hands, light as they were, still smelled of death. I pushed them away, but without strength. I asked under his breath, “Who are you? where is the Voice?” Only a sigh answered me. Suddenly, a hot breath passed over my face and vaguely, in the darkness, next to the black form of the man, I distinguished a white form. The black shape picked me up and set me down on the white shape. And immediately a happy neigh struck my amazed ears and I whispered: “Caesar!” The beast flinched. My friend, I was half lying on a saddle and I had recognized the Prophet's white horse, which I had so often spoiled with delicacies. Now, one evening, the rumor had spread in the theater that this animal had disappeared and that it had been stolen by the phantom of the Opera. I believed in the Voice; I had never believed in the ghost, and yet here I was wondering with a shudder if I was not the prisoner of the ghost! I called, from the bottom of my heart, for the Voice to help me, because never would I have imagined that the Voice and the ghost were all one! Have you heard of the Phantom of the Opera, Raoul?","‘I cannot say how long it was before I regained consciousness. When I opened my eyes, we were still – that man and I – surrounded by darkness. But by a dim lantern on the ground I saw running water. It bubbled out of the wall and disappeared almost at once into the ground upon which I was lying with my head resting on the knee of the masked man in the black cloak. My silent companion was bathing my temples with a care, an attention and a delicacy of manner that seemed even more horrible to bear than the brutality of my earlier abduction. However light his touch, his hands smelled of death. I tried to push them away, but I had no strength left. “Who are you?” I moaned. “Where is the Voice?” A sigh was his sole response. Suddenly, I felt a hot breath sweep over my face and, in the darkness, I vaguely made out a white shape beside the black figure. And then, as the man lifted me up on to this white shape, a joyous neighing came to my astounded ears and I murmured “César!” The animal quivered in response. Slumped in the saddle, I recognized the white horse from Le Prophète, which I had so often spoilt with treats. I remembered that one evening at the Opera, rumour had it that the horse had disappeared, stolen by the ghost. I believed in the Voice, but had never believed in the ghost. Now, however, I wondered with a shudder whether my abductor could be that ghost. I called upon the Voice for help with all my heart, for I could never imagine that he and the ghost were one and the same. You have heard the rumours of the Phantom of the Opera, Raoul, have you not?’","‘How long was I unconscious? I could not say. When I opened my eyes, I and the man in black were still surrounded by deep gloom. A dark lantern on the floor lit up a running spring. The water flowed directly out of the wall and drained away into the ground near where I was lying. My head was resting on the knee of the man in the cloak and the black mask and my silent companion was carefully bathing my temples, a gesture which, though kind and thoughtful, I found more horrible to bear than the brutal fact that he had just abducted me. His hands were gentle but did not smell any the less of death. I pushed them away weakly. I asked in a whisper: “Who are you? Where is the Voice?” The only answer was a sigh. And then a warm breath blew over my face and vaguely, though the gloom, next to the black outline of the man, I made out a white shape. The black shape hoisted me on to the white shape and to my astonishment I heard a delighted whinny. I murmured: “Caesar!” The animal started. I realized I was slumped on a saddle. I recognized the white stallion from Le Prophète which I had so often spoiled with sugar lumps. One night, a rumour had gone the rounds of the theatre to the effect that he had vanished, stolen by the Phantom of the Opera. I believed in the Voice but I had never believed in a Phantom. But now a tingle ran up my spine as I wondered if I was not the prisoner by the Phantom! From the depths of my being I called out to the Voice to save me, for I had never imagined that the Voice and the Phantom were one and the same! Have you ever heard of the Phantom of the Opera, Raoul?’","Then I fainted away. “When I opened my eyes, we were still surrounded by darkness. A lantern, standing on the ground, showed a bubbling well. The water splashing from the well disappeared, almost at once, under the floor on which I was lying, with my head on the knee of the man in the black cloak and the black mask. He was bathing my temples and his hands smelt of death. I tried to push them away and asked, ‘Who are you? Where is the voice?’ His only answer was a sigh. Suddenly, a hot breath passed over my face and I perceived a white shape, beside the man’s black shape, in the darkness. The black shape lifted me on to the white shape, a glad neighing greeted my astounded ears and I murmured, ‘César!’ The animal quivered. Raoul, I was lying half back on a saddle and I had recognized the white horse out of the Profeta, which I had so often fed with sugar and sweets. I remembered that, one evening, there was a rumour in the theatre that the horse had disappeared and that it had been stolen by the Opera ghost. I believed in the voice, but had never believed in the ghost. Now, however, I began to wonder, with a shiver, whether I was the ghost’s prisoner. I called upon the voice to help me, for I should never have imagined that the voice and the ghost were one. You have heard about the Opera ghost, have you not, Raoul?”"

"On jouait Faust, comme par hasard. La salle était des plus brillantes. Le faubourg était magnifiquement représenté. À cette époque, les abonnés ne cédaient point, ne louaient ni ne sous-louaient, ni ne partageaient leurs loges avec la finance ou le commerce ou l'étranger. Aujourd'hui, dans la loge du marquis un tel qui conserve toujours ce titre: loge du marquis un tel, puisque le marquis en est, de par contrat, titulaire, dans cette loge, disons-nous, se prélasse tel marchand de porc salé et sa famille,—ce qui est le droit du marchand de porc puisqu'il paie la loge du marquis.—Autrefois, ces mœurs étaient à peu près inconnues. Les loges d'Opéra étaient des salons ou l'on était à peu près sûr de rencontrer ou de voir des gens du monde qui, quelquefois, aimaient la musique.","We were playing Faust, as if by chance. The room was most brilliant. The suburb was magnificently represented. At that time, subscribers did not assign, rent or sublet, or share their boxes with finance or commerce or foreigners. Today, in the lodge of the marquis such and such who still retains this title: lodge of the marquis so and so, since the marquis is, by contract, holder of it, in this lodge, we say, such and such a salt pork merchant is lounging and his family—which is the pork merchant's right, since he pays for the lodge of the marquis.—Formerly, these manners were almost unknown. The Opera boxes were salons where one was almost sure to meet or see people of the world who sometimes loved music.","By coincidence, it was Faust that was being performed that evening before a highly distinguished house. In those days, the subscribers did not lend nor rent their boxes to bankers, merchants and foreigners, whose company they shunned. But no longer: today the box of the Earl of X – which is still known as the Earl of X’s box since the said Earl is its contractual owner – may well be occupied by a pork merchant who is perfectly entitled to lounge there with his family since he has paid the Earl for the privilege. This would have been practically unheard of in former times. Then Opera boxes were rather like salons where one could generally expect to meet or see fine society, some of whose members happened to be music lovers.","As it happened, Faust was being performed that night. There was a glittering audience. The Faubourg Saint-Germain was out in force. In those days, subscribers did not lend, let, sublet or share their boxes with bankers, businessmen or foreigners. Nowadays, ensconced in the Marquis de This or That’s box (still known as the Marquis de This or That’s box because the Marquis retains all his contractual rights to it), you will find some salt pork wholesaler and his family—and he is perfectly entitled to be there, since he has paid the Marquis for the privilege. But back then, such practices were almost unknown. Boxes at the Opera were in effect private salons where you were virtually certain to meet or see the most prominent socialites who, in rare instances, had a genuine feel for music.","They were giving Faust, as it happened, before a splendid house. The Faubourg was magnificently represented; and the paragraph in that morning’s Epoque had already produced its effect, for all eyes were turned to the box in which Count Philippe sat alone, apparently in a very indifferent and careless frame of mind."

"Et Raoul réfléchissait qu'une telle aventure n'était point exceptionnelle. Il se rappelait ce qui était arrivé à la princesse Belmonte, qui venait de perdre son mari et dont le désespoir était devenu de la stupeur... Depuis un mois, la princesse ne pouvait ni parler ni pleurer. Cette inertie physique et morale allait s'aggravant tous les jours et l'affaiblissement de la raison amenait peu à peu l'anéantissement de la vie. On portait tous les soirs la malade dans ses jardins; mais elle ne semblait même pas comprendre où elle se trouvait. Raff, le plus grand chanteur de l'Allemagne, qui passait à Naples, voulut visiter ces jardins, renommés pour leur beauté. Une des femmes de la princesse pria le grand artiste de chanter, sans se montrer, près du bosquet où elle se trouvait étendue. Raff y consentit et chanta un air simple que la princesse avait entendu dans la bouche de son mari aux premiers jours de leur hymen. Cet air était expressif et touchant. La mélodie, les paroles, la voix admirable de l'artiste, tout se réunit pour remuer profondément l'âme de la princesse. Les larmes lui jaillirent des yeux... elle pleura, fut sauvée et resta persuadée que son époux, ce soir-là, était descendu du ciel pour lui chanter l'air d'autrefois!","And Raoul reflected that such an adventure was not exceptional. He remembered what had happened to Princess Belmonte, who had just lost her husband and whose despair had become stupor... For a month, the princess could neither speak nor cry. This physical and moral inertia grew worse every day and the weakening of reason gradually led to the annihilation of life. The sick woman was taken to her gardens every evening; but she didn't even seem to understand where she was. Raff, Germany's greatest singer, who was passing through Naples, wished to visit these gardens, renowned for their beauty. One of the Princess's wives begged the great artist to sing, without showing himself, near the grove where she was lying. Raff consented and sang a simple tune that the princess had heard from her husband in the early days of their marriage. This tune was expressive and touching. The melody, the lyrics, the admirable voice of the artist, everything comes together to deeply stir the soul of the princess. Tears welled up in her eyes... she wept, was saved and remained convinced that her husband, that evening, had come down from heaven to sing her the tune of yesteryear!","‘This situation is not altogether without precedent,’ thought Raoul as he recollected the story of Princess Belmonte, whose despair at having lost her husband had turned into a state of stupor: for a month, the princess could neither speak nor show any feelings. Her mental and physical apathy worsened by the day; her powers of reason deteriorated, leading to a gradual weakening of all life in her. Every evening, she was carried into the famously beautiful gardens of her palace, but she appeared to be unaware of her surroundings. The renowned German singer Raff,1 passing through Naples, expressed the wish to visit those celebrated gardens and was asked to sing, out of sight, near the grove where the Princess was resting. Raff consented and sang a simple air that the Princess’s husband had sung to her in the early days of their marriage. It was an expressive, moving song. The melody, the words, the singer’s splendid voice, all combined to stir the soul of the Princess and revive her. Her eyes welled with tears; she wept. She was thus saved and remained convinced that her husband had come down from Heaven that evening to sing to her that half-forgotten melody from their past.","Still, thought Raoul, there was nothing all that strange about such a case. He recalled what had happened to Princess Belmonte who lost her husband: her grief had made her almost catatonic. For a month, she had not been able to speak or shed a tear. With her physical and spiritual inertia deepening day by day, her reason similarly declined and she was gradually heading towards the extinction of life. Each evening, she was carried out into her gardens, but she did not seem to know where she was. Raff, the greatest singer in all Germany, was passing through Naples and enquired if he could visit her gardens which were justly celebrated. One of the Princess’s ladies-in-waiting asked the great artist if he would sing from inside the grove just by where she was lying. He agreed and chose a simple song which the Princess’s husband had sung to her during the first days of their marriage. It was an expressive, touching little air. Melody, words, the artist’s fine voice, all combined to stir the depths of the Princess’s very soul. Tears sprang to her eyes… she wept, was saved and remained thereafter convinced that her husband had come down from heaven that evening to sing that old song for her!",For three months the Angel of Music had been giving Christine lessons....

"Alors, il retourna dans les campagnes, allant de foire en foire, raclant ses mélodies Scandinaves, cependant que son enfant, qui ne le quittait jamais, l'écoutait avec extase ou l'accompagnait en chantant. Un jour, à la foire de Limby, le professeur Valérius les entendit tous deux et les emmena à Gothenburg. Il prétendait que le père était le premier violoneux du monde et que sa fille avait l'étoffe d'une grande artiste. On pourvut à l'éducation et à l'instruction de l'enfant. Partout elle émerveillait un chacun par sa beauté, sa grâce et sa soif de bien dire et bien faire. Ses progrès étaient rapides. Le professeur Valérius et sa femme durent sur ces entrefaites, venir s'installer en France. Ils emmenèrent Daaé et Christine. La maman Valérius traitait Christine comme sa fille. Quant au bonhomme, il commençait à dépérir, pris du mal du pays. À Paris il ne sortait jamais. Il vivait dans une espèce de rêve qu'il entretenait avec son violon. Des heures entières, il s'enfermait dans sa chambre avec sa fille, et on l'entendait violoner et chanter tout doux, tout doux. Parfois, la maman Valérius venait les écouter derrière la porte, poussait un gros soupir, essuyait une larme et s'en retournait sur la pointe des pieds. Elle aussi avait la nostalgie de son ciel Scandinave.","So he returned to the countryside, going from fair to fair, scraping out his Scandinavian melodies, while his child, who never left him, listened to him ecstatically or accompanied him singing. One day at the fair in Limby, Professor Valerius heard them both and took them to Gothenburg. He claimed that the father was the first fiddler in the world and that his daughter had the makings of a great artist. Provision was made for the education and instruction of the child. Everywhere she amazed everyone with her beauty, her grace and her thirst for saying and doing well. His progress was rapid. Professor Valérius and his wife last in the meantime, come to settle in France. They took Daaé and Christine away. Mama Valérius treated Christine like her daughter. As for the good man, he was beginning to waste away, seized with homesickness. In Paris he never went out. He lived in a kind of dream that he entertained with his violin. For whole hours he locked himself in his room with his daughter, and we heard him fiddle and sing very softly, very softly. Sometimes Mama Valerius came to listen to them behind the door, heaved a heavy sigh, wiped away a tear and went back on tiptoe. She too was longing for her Scandinavian sky.","And so he returned to the countryside, travelling from fair to fair, scraping on his violin, while his child, who never left his side, listened to him in rapture or sang to his playing.

He maintained that the father was the best fiddler in the world and that the daughter had the makings of a great artist. He provided for her education and training. She made rapid progress, charming all who met her with her beauty, her graceful deportment and her eagerness to better herself. When Valerius and his wife went to live in France, they took Daaé and Christine with them. Mme Valerius treated Christine as her own daughter. Daaé, however, was so homesick that his health began to decline. When in Paris, he always remained indoors. He lived in a kind of dream, which he sustained with the help of his violin. For hours at a time, he shut himself away in his room with his daughter, playing and singing softly, all too softly. Sometimes Mme Valerius would come and listen behind the door, let out a heavy sigh, wipe a few tears from her eyes and then tiptoe away. For she too pined for the old country.","So he returned to the country, travelling from fair to fair, scratching out his Scandinavian tunes, while his daughter, who never left his side, listened transfixed or sang while he played.

"Il n'avait pas prononcé un mot, et ses voisins eux-mêmes n'eussent pu dire à quel moment précis il était venu s'asseoir là, mais chacun pensa que si les morts revenaient parfois s'asseoir à la table des vivants, ils ne pouvaient montrer de plus macabre visage. Les amis de MM. Firmin Richard et Armand Moncharmin crurent que ce convive décharné était un intime de MM. Debienne et Poligny, tandis que les amis de MM. Debienne et Poligny pensèrent que ce cadavre appartenait à la clientèle de MM. Richard et Moncharmin. De telle sorte qu'aucune demande d'explication, aucune réflexion déplaisante, aucune facétie de mauvais goût ne risqua de froisser cet hôte d'outre-tombe. Quelques convives qui étaient au courant de la légende du fantôme et qui connaissaient la description qu'en avait faite le chef machiniste,—ils ignoraient la mort de Joseph Buquet,—trouvaient in petto que l'homme du bout de la table aurait très bien pu passer pour la réalisation vivante du personnage créé, selon eux, par l'indécrottable superstition du personnel de l'Opéra; et cependant, selon la légende, le fantôme n'avait pas de nez et ce personnage en avait un, mais M. Moncharmin affirme dans ses «mémoires» que le nez du convive était transparent.—Son nez, dit-il, était long, fin, et transparent,—et j'ajouterai que cela pouvait être un faux nez. M. Moncharmin a pu prendre pour de la transparence ce qui n'était que luisant. Tout le monde sait que la science fait d'admirables faux nez pour ceux qui en ont été privés par la nature ou par quelqu'opération. En réalité, le fantôme est-il venu s'asseoir, cette nuit-là, an banquet des directeurs sans y avoir été invité? Et pouvons-nous être sûrs que cette figure était celle du fantôme de l'Opéra lui-même? Qui oserait le dire? Si je parle de cet incident ici, ce n'est point que je veuille une seconde faire croire ou tenter de faire croire au lecteur que le fantôme ait été capable d'une aussi superbe audace, mais parce qu'en somme la chose est très possible.","He had not uttered a word, and even his neighbors could not tell at what precise moment he had come to sit there, but everyone thought that if the dead sometimes came back to sit at the table of the living, they could not show a more macabre face. Friends of Messrs. Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin believed that this emaciated guest was an intimate of MM. Debienne and Poligny, while the friends of MM. Debienne and Poligny thought that this corpse belonged to the clientele of MM. Richard and Moncharmin. In such a way that no request for an explanation, no unpleasant reflection, no joke in bad taste risked offending this guest from beyond the grave. Some guests who were aware of the legend of the ghost and who knew the description given by the chief stagehand—they were unaware of the death of Joseph Buquet—thought in petto that the man at the end of the table would have very well could pass for the living realization of the character created, according to them, by the incorrigible superstition of the personnel of the Opera; and yet, according to legend, the phantom had no nose, and this personage had one, but M. Moncharmin affirms in his ""Memoirs"" that the guest's nose was transparent.—His nose, he says, was long , fine, and transparent,—and I will add that it might be a false nose. Mr. Moncharmin could take for transparency what was only shiny. Everyone knows that science makes wonderful false noses for those who have been deprived of them by nature or by some operation. In reality, did the ghost come and sit down that night at the directors' banquet uninvited? And can we be sure that this figure was that of the Phantom of the Opera itself? Who would dare to say it? If I speak of this incident here, it is not that I want for a second to make believe or try to make the reader believe that the ghost was capable of such superb audacity, but because in short the thing is very possible.","He had not uttered a word and even those sitting on either side of him were at a loss to say at what precise moment he had appeared; everyone felt nevertheless that had Death come and sat at the table of the living, he would not cut a more macabre figure. Richard and Moncharmin’s friends assumed that this spectre was one of Debienne and Poligny’s guests, while Debienne and Poligny’s friends thought that the cadaverous figure was there at the invitation of Richard and Moncharmin. Therefore no questions were asked, no disagreeable comments passed, nor jokes in poor taste made, that might offend the visitor from beyond the grave. Some of those who knew the story of the ghost and the description of him given by the chief machinist – Joseph Buquet’s death was still unknown to them – thought privately that the man at the end of the table might easily pass for the incarnation of the character whom they thought to be a figment of the staff’s incorrigible imagination. If their story were to be believed, the ghost had no nose; yet the character seated at the table had one. In his Memoirs, Armand Moncharmin claims that the nose of the guest in question was ‘long, thin and transparent’. Personally, I am inclined to suggest that it was false, and that Moncharmin mistook mere shininess for transparency. Thanks to the advances of science, as everyone knows, remarkably believable false noses can now be made for those people who have lost their own as a result of natural causes or an operation. Did the ghost really invite himself to the directors’ table that night? And can we be sure that the figure they described was indeed the Phantom of the Opera himself? Who can really know? I venture to mention the incident not because I have the slightest wish to make the reader believe that the Phantom was capable of such a magnificently bold move, but because, when all is said and done, it is quite possible.","He had not uttered a word and those sitting next to him could not have said at what precise moment he had materialized there, but everyone thought that if the dead ever return and sit at the table of the living, none of them would ever have a more macabre face. The friends of Armand Moncharmin and Firmin Richard assumed that the emaciated guest was an acquaintance of Debienne and Poligny, while the friends of Debienne and Poligny thought the corpse must be there at the invitation of Richard and Moncharmin. Thus no one asked questions, there were no unpleasant comments or jokes in poor taste: nothing was said that might ruffle the feathers of the guest from the lower depths. One or two guests who knew the legend of the Phantom of the Opera and had heard the description of the spectre the chief stage-setter had given —they didn’t know that Joseph Buquet was actually dead—were inwardly convinced that the man at the end of the table could easily pass as the living embodiment of the figment, as they thought, of the irredeemably superstitious imaginations of the Opera House staff. According to the legend, the Phantom had no nose; but the mysterious figure most certainly had one, though in his Memoirs M. Moncharmin says the guest’s nose was transparent. ‘ His nose’, he says, ‘was long, thin and transparent’—but I myself would say that the nose could have been false. Perhaps what M. Moncharmin thought was transparency was a trick of the light. It is known for a fact nowadays that technology can create very convincing false noses for those who have lost them as a result of an accident or following some medical procedure. Did the Phantom really come that evening and sit at the Directors’ banquet without being invited? And can we be sure that the apparition was really the Phantom of the Opera? Who can say? If I bring up this incident, it is not because I want for a moment to believe or try to persuade the reader to believe that the Phantom was capable of such brass-necked effrontery, but because it is a distinct possibility.","He himself did not speak a word and his very neighbours could not have stated at what precise moment he had sat down between them; but every one felt that if the dead did ever come and sit at the table of the living, they could not cut a more ghastly figure. The friends of Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin thought that this lean and skinny guest was an acquaintance of Debienne’s or Poligny ’s, while Debienne’s and Poligny’s friends believed that the cadaverous individual belonged to Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin’s party. The result was that no request was made for an explanation; no unpleasant remark; no joke in bad taste, which might have offended this visitor from the tomb. A few of those present who knew the story of the ghost and the description of him given by the chief scene-shifter—they did not know of Joseph Buquet’s death—thought, in their own minds, that the man at the end of the table might easily have passed for him; and yet, according to the story, the ghost had no nose and the person in question had. But M. Moncharmin declares, in his Memoirs, that the guest’s nose was transparent: “long, thin and transparent” are his exact words. I, for my part, will add that this might very well apply to a false nose. M. Moncharmin may have taken for transparency what was only shininess. Everybody knows that orthopaedic science provides beautiful false noses for those who have lost their noses naturally or as the result of an operation. Did the ghost really take a seat at the managers’ supper-table that night, uninvited? And can we be sure that the figure was that of the Opera ghost himself? Who would venture to assert as much? I mention the incident, not because I wish for a second to make the reader believe—or even to try to make him believe—that the ghost was capable of such a sublime piece of impudence; but because, after all, the thing is impossible."

"MM. Moncharmin et Richard, s'amusant ostensiblement et riant l'un de l'autre, remuaient les meubles de la loge, soulevaient les housses et les fauteuils et examinaient en particulier celui sur lequel la voix avait l'habitude de s'asseoir. Mais ils constatèrent que c'était un honnête fauteuil, qui n'avait rien de magique. En somme, la loge était la plus ordinaire des loges, avec sa tapisserie rouge, ses fauteuils, sa carpette et son appui-mains en velours rouge. Après avoir tâté le plus sérieusement du monde la carpette et n'avoir, de ce côté comme des autres, rien découvert de spécial, ils descendirent dans la baignoire du dessous, qui correspondait à la loge n° 5. Dans la baignoire n°5, qui est juste au coin de la première sortie de gauche des fauteuils d'orchestre, ils ne trouvèrent rien non plus qui méritât d'être signalé.","MM. Moncharmin and Richard, ostensibly amused and laughing at each other, moved the furniture in the box, lifted the slipcovers and armchairs, and examined in particular the one on which the voice used to sit. But they found that it was an honest armchair, which had nothing magic about it. In short, the box was the most ordinary of boxes, with its red upholstery, its armchairs, its rug, and its red velvet hand-rest. After having probed the rug as seriously as possible and having discovered nothing special on this side as on the others, they descended into the tub below, which corresponded to dressing room No. 5. In tub No. 5 , which is just around the corner from the first left exit from the orchestra seats, they also found nothing worth noting.","In truth, there was nothing to distinguish it from any of the others. Moncharmin and Richard, ostensibly enjoying themselves and joking with each other, moved the furniture around, lifted the dust-covers and the seats. They examined with particular care the chair from whence the voice spoke; but all they saw was a respectable chair with no magic about it. All in all, there was nothing exceptional about the box with its red hangings, its chairs, its carpet and its ledge covered in red velvet. Having purposefully felt along the carpet and discovered nothing special there or anywhere else, they went down into the box directly below the Phantom’s box and to the left of the first rows of stalls. There, they found nothing worthy of note either.","There was nothing to distinguish it from any of the others. M. Richard and M. Moncharmin, ostensibly highly amused and still having a laugh, made a great show of moving the furniture around, lifting the dust-covers and the chairs.

All in all, the box was the most ordinary of all the boxes, with its red hangings, chairs, carpet and armrest covered in red velvet. After inspecting the carpet with the greatest care and finding, here as elsewhere, nothing special, they moved down one floor into the box directly under Box 5 in the grand tier. In this ground-floor box 5, which is located near the exit from the orchestra stalls, stage-left, they found nothing worthy of note either.","There is nothing to distinguish it from any of the others.

"Soudain, devant le jeune homme, les ténèbres s'éclairèrent prudemment au feu d'une petite lanterne sourde, et Raoul eut un recul instinctif comme pour échapper à l'investigation d'un secret ennemi. Mais il comprit aussitôt que ce feu appartenait au Persan, dont il suivait tous les gestes. Le petit disque rouge se promenait sur les parois, en haut, en bas, tout autour d'eux, méticuleusement. Ces parois étaient formées, à droite d'un mur, à gauche d'une cloison en planches, au-dessus et au-dessous des planchers. Et Raoul se disait que Christine avait passé par là le jour où elle avait suivi la voix de l'Ange de la musique. Ce devait être là le chemin accoutumé d'Erik quand il venait à travers les murs surprendre la bonne foi et intriguer l'innocence de Christine. Et Raoul qui se rappelait les propos du Persan, pensa que ce chemin avait été mystérieusement établi par les soins du Fantôme lui-même. Or, il devait apprendre plus tard qu'Erik avait trouvé là, tout préparé pour lui, un corridor secret dont longtemps il était resté le seul à connaître l'existence. Ce corridor avait été créé lors de la Commune de Paris pour permettre aux geôliers de conduire directement leurs prisonniers aux cachots que l'on avait construits dans les caves, car les fédérés avaient occupé le bâtiment aussitôt après le 18 mars et en avaient fait tout en haut un point de départ pour les montgolfières chargées d'aller porter dans les départements leurs proclamations incendiaires, et, tout en bas, une prison d'État.","Suddenly, in front of the young man, the darkness was lighted up cautiously by the fire of a small deaf lantern, and Raoul instinctively recoiled as if to escape the investigation of a secret enemy. But he understood immediately that this fire belonged to the Persian, whose every move he followed. The small red disc was walking on the walls, above, below, all around them, meticulously. These walls were formed, to the right of a wall, to the left of a plank partition, above and below the floors. And Raoul said to himself that Christine had been there the day she had followed the voice of the Angel of Music. This must have been Erik's customary route when he came through the walls to surprise the good faith and intrigue the innocence of Christine. And Raoul, who remembered the words of the Persian, thought that this path had been mysteriously established by the care of the Phantom himself. However, he was to learn later that Erik had found there, all prepared for him, a secret corridor of which for a long time he had remained the only one to know of the existence. This corridor had been created during the Paris Commune to allow the jailers to lead their prisoners directly to the dungeons that had been built in the cellars, because the Federals had occupied the building immediately after March 18 and had done everything in above, a starting point for hot-air balloons charged with carrying their incendiary proclamations to the departments, and, at the very bottom, a state prison.","Suddenly the young man saw the faint, tentative glow of a bull’s eye lantern1 in front of him. He instinctively stepped back as if to escape the scrutiny of some unknown enemy; but he soon realized that the light belonged to the Persian and watched the little red disc glide over the walls, and then along the floor and the ceiling, as the Persian painstakingly inspected all about him. The wall on the right was of solid construction and the partition on the left was made of boards; the ceiling and the floor were wooden too. Christine must have passed through here, thought Raoul, when she followed the voice of the Angel of Music; and this must be the route Erik would have taken when he wanted to surprise and intrigue the trusting, innocent girl, casting his spell over her through the walls. Raoul, recalling his conversation with the Persian, assumed that this passage had been secretly built by the Phantom himself. In fact, he would later learn that Erik had found it ready made and for a long time was the only one who knew of its existence. It had been built at the time of the Paris Commune to allow the insurgents to take their prisoners straight down to the dungeon in the basement. The Opera House had been occupied from the first day of the uprising, on 18 March 1871: the lower part of the building became a prison and the rooftops were used to fly the hot-air balloons that carried revolutionary proclamations out to the rest of the country.2","Suddenly, the shadows were pierced by the cautious light of a small dark lantern. Raoul recoiled instinctively as if to evade the attack of a hidden enemy. Then he realized that the lamp, each one of whose movements he watched carefully, was the Persian’s. The small red circle wandered over the walls, up and down and all around them, missing nothing. The surfaces belonged, on the right, to a solid wall, and on the left to a wooden bulkhead which was also boarded overhead and underfoot. Raoul realized that Christine must have come this way on the night she had followed the voice of the Angel of Music. It had to be Erik’s usual route when he came to abuse her trusting, innocent heart. Remembering what the Persian had said, he assumed it had been mysteriously constructed by the Phantom himself. But later, he would learn that Erik had discovered that a secret passage had already been dug there, a hidden corridor whose existence had long remained unknown except to him. In fact, it had been made during the Paris Commune to allow jailers to take prisoners directly to the cells which had been built in the cellars, for the rebels had occupied the Opera House following the events of 18 March. * They had used its high roofs as a launching site for the hot-air balloons which were sent into départements throughout France to carry their revolutionary message, and its lower depths as a state prison.","Suddenly, the darkness was made visible by a small dark lantern and Raoul instinctively stepped backward as though to escape the scrutiny of a secret enemy. But he soon perceived that the light belonged to the Persian, whose movements he was closely observing. The little red disk was turned in every direction and Raoul saw that the floor, the walls and the ceiling were all formed of planking. It must have been the ordinary road taken by Erik to reach Christine’s dressing-room and impose upon her innocence. And Raoul, remembering the Persian’s remark, thought that it had been mysteriously constructed by the ghost himself. Later, he learned that Erik had found, all prepared for him, a secret passage, long known to himself alone and contrived at the time of the Paris Commune to allow the jailers to convey their prisoners straight to the dungeons that had been constructed for them in the cellars; for the Federates had occupied the opera-house immediately after the eighteenth of March and had made a starting-place right at the top for their Mongolfier balloons, which carried their incendiary proclamations to the departments, and a state prison right at the bottom.1"

"Au chevet de la vieille dame qui, assise dans son lit, tricotait, Christine faisait de la dentelle. Jamais ovale plus charmant, jamais front plus pur, jamais regard plus doux ne se penchèrent sur un ouvrage de vierge. De fraîches couleurs étaient revenues aux joues de la jeune fille. Le cerne bleuâtre de ses yeux clairs avait disparu. Raoul ne reconnut plus le visage tragique de la veille. Si le voile de la mélancolie répandu sur ces traits adorables n'était apparu au jeune homme comme le dernier vestige du drame inouï où se débattait cette mystérieuse enfant, il eût pu penser que Christine n'en était point l'incompréhensible héroïne.","At the bedside of the old lady who, sitting in her bed, was knitting, Christine was making lace.

The shadows circling her bright eyes had gone. Raoul did not recognize the tragic face of the night before.

"Le comte emmena son frère dîner au cabaret. Avec un aussi frais désespoir, il est probable que Raoul eût décliné, ce soir-là, toute invitation si, pour le décider, le comte ne lui avait appris que la veille au soir, dans une allée du Bois, la dame de ses pensées avait été rencontrée en galante compagnie. D'abord, le vicomte n'y voulut point croire et puis il lui fut donné des détails si précis qu'il ne protesta plus. Enfin, n'était-ce point là l'aventure la plus banale? On l'avait vue dans un coupé dont la vitre était baissée. Elle semblait aspirer longuement l'air glacé de la nuit. Il faisait un clair de lune superbe. On l'avait parfaitement reconnue. Quant à son compagnon, on n'en avait distingué qu'une vague silhouette, dans l'ombre. La voiture allait «au pas», dans une allée déserte, derrière les tribunes de Longchamp.","The Count took his brother to dinner at the cabaret. With such fresh despair, it is probable that Raoul would have declined any invitation that evening if, to decide so, the Count had not told him until the evening before, in an alley in the Bois, the lady of his thoughts. had been met in gallant company. At first the Viscount didn't want to believe it, and then he was given such precise details that he no longer protested. Finally, wasn't this the most banal adventure? She had been seen in a coupe with the window down. She seemed to be sucking in the icy night air for a long time. It was a superb moonlight. We had recognized her perfectly. As for his companion, only a vague silhouette could be made out in the shadows. The car was going “at a walk”, in a deserted alley, behind the stands of Longchamp.","The Count took his younger brother out to dinner that evening. Raoul’s despair was so profound that he would probably have declined the invitation if the Count had not told him, by way of enticement, that the lady of his thoughts had been seen at the Bois2 the previous evening, in the company of a man. The Viscount would not believe him at first, but was given so full and detailed a description that he was finally convinced. After all, was it not a commonplace occurrence? She had been seen in a brougham,3 with the window down, leisurely taking in the cool night air, and in the clear moonlight had been easily recognized. As for her companion, he was no more than a vague shadow glimpsed in the dark. The carriage moved at a walking pace along a lonely lane behind the grandstand of the race-course at Longchamp.4","The Count suggested taking his brother to dinner. If the hurt had not been so recent, Raoul would probably have declined all invitations that night. But, to talk him round the Count had told him that the woman of his thoughts had been seen in the Bois de Boulogne the night before, with a man. At first, the Viscount would not believe it. But when he was given time and place, he stopped objecting and allowed himself to be convinced. Surely it was a perfectly ordinary thing? She had been seen in a carriage with the window down. She seemed to be quietly taking in the icy night air. There was a bright moon, so there was no mistake: it was unquestionably her. As to her companion, he was no more than a vague silhouette in the dark interior of the carriage which had been travelling at walking pace along a deserted avenue behind the stands of Longchamp racecourse.","His brother suggested taking him out to dinner. Overcome as he was with despair, Raoul would probably have refused any invitation that evening, if the count had not, as an inducement, told him that the lady of his thoughts had been seen, the night before, in company of the other sex in the Bois.j At first, the viscount refused to believe; but he received such exact details that he ceased protesting. She had been seen, it appeared, driving in a brougham, with the window down. She seemed to be slowly taking in the icy night air. There was a glorious moon shining. She was recognized beyond a doubt. As for her companion, only his shadowy outline was distinguished leaning back in the dark. The carriage was going at a walking pace in a lonely drive behind the grand stand at Longchamp."

Thereupon he turns around, but this time, towards his lady and Isidore, and what does he see? Isidore, who had taken his lady's hand from behind and was covering it with kisses in the small hollow of his glove...just like that, my good gentlemen. (Mame Giry covers with kisses the corner of flesh left bare by her filoselle glove.) So you can imagine that it didn't happen sweetly! Click! Clack! Mr. Maniera, who was tall and strong like you, Mr. Richard; distributed a pair of slaps to M. Isidore Saack, who was thin and weak like M. Moncharmin, with all due respect. It was a scandal. In the room, people shouted: “Enough! Enough! He is going to kill him!...» Finally, Mr. Isidore Saack was able to escape...","(Smirking) As I said, Méphistophélès kept singing his serenade. (Resuming) “Beloved Catherine – Accord the bliss – To a mortal bending lowly – Of a kiss”,2 and just then the jeweller heard a voice in his right ear saying: “Oho! Julie wouldn’t deny Isidore a kiss!” So he turned to his wife, on his left, and what did he see? Isidore holding Mme Maniera’s hand from behind and kissing it feverishly through the little opening on the inside of her glove – like this, gentlemen (greedily kissing the patch of skin on the palm of her hand not covered by her glove). You can imagine that M. Maniera was not going to let it pass! Slap! Slap! So the jeweller, who was big and strong like you, M. Richard, repeatedly cuffed Isidore Saack, who was, saving your presence, small and puny like M. Moncharmin. The house was in uproar with people shouting: “Stop him! Stop him! He’ll kill him!” And then, at last, Isidore Saack managed to escape.’","(Here Mme Giry simpers coyly.) Anyroad, Mephistopheles carries on singing (Mme Giry sings): “Catherine, whom I adore… why deny me, I implore, a sweet and tender kiss?” and at that moment M. Maniera hears, again in his right ear, the same voice saying: “I don’t think Julie would deny Isidore who doth implore a kiss!” He turns sharply, this time to the left, towards his lady and Isidore, and what does he see? Isidore behind him holding his lady’s hand busily kissing it through the little opening near the button of her glove… like this, your honours. (Mme Giry kisses the round place on her own hand left bare by her rough silk glove.) As you can imagine, the next bit didn’t happen on the Q.T.! Biff! Bang! M. Maniera was big and strong just like yourself, M. Richard, and he lands a couple of beauties on Isidore Saack who was soft and wishy-washy like M. Moncharmin here, if he don’t mind me saying so. There was uproar in the auditorium. The audience was shouting: “That’s enough! Stop!… He’ll kill him!” In the end, M. Saack managed to get away.’","“Well, then, Mephistopheles went on with his serenade”—Mame Giry, burst into song again—“‘Saint, unclose thy portals holy and accord the bliss, to a mortal bending lowly, of a pardon-kiss.’ And then M. Maniera again hears the voice in his right ear, saying, this time, ‘Ha, ha! Julie wouldn’t mind according a kiss to Isidore!’ Then he turns around again, but, this time, to the left; and what do you think he sees? Isidore, who had taken his lady’s hand and was covering it with kisses through the little round place in the glove—like this, gentlemen”—rapturously kissing the bit of palm left bare in the middle of her thread gloves. “Then they had a lively time between them! Bang! Bang! M. Maniera, who was big and strong, like you, M. Richard, gave two blows to M. Isidore Saack, who was small and weak like M. Moncharmin, saving his presence. There was a great uproar. People in the house shouted, ‘That will do! Stop them! He’ll kill him!’ Then, at last, M. Isidore Saack managed to run away.”"

"Les deux plumes noires du chapeau couleur de suie, qui affectaient à l'ordinaire la forme de deux points d'interrogation, se muèrent aussitôt en point d'exclamation; quant au chapeau lui-même, il oscilla, menaçant sur son chignon en tempête.

"Chose curieuse, le vicomte avait pleinement confiance dans le Persan. Malgré qu'il ignorât tout de lui, et que la plupart de ses propos n'eussent fait qu'augmenter l'obscurité de cette aventure, il n'hésitait point à croire que, dans cette heure décisive, le Persan était avec lui contre Erik. Son émotion lui avait paru sincère quand il lui avait parlé du «monstre»; l'intérêt qu'il lui avait montré ne lui semblait point suspect. Enfin, si le Persan avait nourri quelque sinistre projet contre Raoul, il n'eût pas armé celui-ci de ses propres mains. Et puis, pour tout dire, ne fallait-il point arriver coûte, que coûte, auprès de Christine? Raoul n'avait pas le choix des moyens. S'il avait hésité, même avec des doutes sur les intentions du Persan, le jeune homme se fût considéré comme le dernier des lâches.","Curiously enough, the Viscount had full confidence in the Persian. Despite the fact that he knew nothing about him, and that most of his remarks had only increased the obscurity of this adventure, he did not hesitate to believe that, in this decisive hour, the Persian was with him against Eric. His emotion had seemed to him sincere when he had spoken to her of the ""monster""; the interest he had shown in her did not seem suspicious to her. Finally, if the Persian had nourished some sinister project against Raoul, he would not have armed the latter with his own hands. And then, to put it bluntly, shouldn't you have come at all costs to Christine? Raoul had no choice of means. If he had hesitated, even with doubts about the Persian's intentions, the young man would have considered himself the last of the cowards.","Strangely, the young man had total confidence in the Persian. Though he knew nothing about him, and his enigmatic remarks had only added to the mystery of their present undertaking, Raoul did not doubt for a moment that the Persian was on his side and against Erik at this decisive hour. When the Persian called the Phantom a ‘fiend’, he seemed quite sincere; and his interest in Raoul’s plight appeared genuine. Had he been scheming against Raoul, he would not have given him a pistol. Besides, Christine had to be reached at all cost. Raoul had no choice but to trust him. Had he wavered in his purpose out of diffidence, the young man would have thought himself the worst of cowards.","Curiously enough, Raoul had absolute confidence in the Persian. Though he knew nothing about him and despite the fact that the little he’d said had only made a baffling situation even more mysterious, he had no hesitation in believing that at this critical juncture the Persian was on his side and against Erik. He had seemed to mean it when he’d called him a ‘monster’ and there was nothing suspicious about the interest his took in Raoul’s predicament. And if the Persian had been planning some sinister move against him, he would hardly have given him a weapon. Anyway, nothing else mattered next to the vital business of finding Christine. Raoul did not have much freedom of action. Even if he’d had valid doubts about the Persian’s motives, he would have considered himself the most despicable of cowards if he had hesitated for one instant.","Curiously enough, the viscount had absolute confidence in the Persian, though he knew nothing about him. His emotion when speaking of the “monster” struck him as sincere; and, if the Persian had cherished any sinister designs against him, he would not have armed him with his own hands.

"Quand je me réveillai, j'étais seule, sur une chaise-longue, dans une petite chambre toute simple, garnie d'un lit banal en acajou, aux murs tendus de toile de Jouy, et éclairée par une lampe posée sur le marbre d'une vieille commode «Louis-Philippe». Quel était ce décor nouveau?... Je me passai la main sur le front, comme pour chasser un mauvais songe... Hélas! je ne fus pas longtemps à m'apercevoir que je n'avais pas rêvé! J'étais prisonnière et je ne pouvais sortir de ma chambre que pour entrer dans une salle de bains des plus confortables; eau chaude et eau froide à volonté. En revenant dans ma chambre, j'aperçus sur ma commode un billet à l'encre rouge qui me renseigna tout à fait sur ma triste situation et qui, si cela avait été encore nécessaire, eût enlevé tous mes doutes sur la réalité des événements: «Ma chère Christine, disait le papier, soyez tout à fait rassurée sur votre sort. Vous n'avez point au monde de meilleur, ni de plus respectueux ami que moi. Vous êtes seule, en ce moment, dans cette demeure qui vous appartient. Je sors pour courir les magasins et vous rapporter tout le linge dont vous pouvez avoir besoin.»","When I woke up, I was alone, on a chaise-longue, in a very simple little room, furnished with an ordinary mahogany bed, with walls hung with toile de Jouy, and lit by a lamp placed on the marble floor. an old Louis-Philippe chest of drawers. What was this new setting?... I passed my hand over my forehead, as if to drive away a bad dream... Alas! I was not long in realizing that I had not dreamed! I was a prisoner and could only leave my room to enter a very comfortable bathroom; unlimited hot and cold water. Returning to my room, I saw on my chest of drawers a note in red ink which told me completely about my sad situation and which, if it had still been necessary, would have removed all my doubts about the reality of the events: “My dear Christine, said the paper, be completely reassured about your fate. You have no better or more respectful friend in the world than me. You are alone, at this moment, in this house which belongs to you. I go out to run the shops and bring you all the linen you may need.”","‘When I woke up, I was alone, lying on a chaise longue in a simple bedroom hung with calico and furnished with a plain mahogany bed; a lamp was burning on the marble top of an old Louis-Philippe chest of drawers.9 Where was I?

"C'est à partir de ce jour que je renonçai à pénétrer dans sa demeure par le lac! Évidemment, cette entrée-là était trop bien gardée, surtout depuis qu'il savait que je la connaissais. Mais je pensais bien qu'il devait s'en trouver une autre, car plus d'une fois j'avais vu disparaître Erik dans le troisième dessous, alors que je le surveillais et sans que je pusse imaginer comment. Je ne saurais trop le répéter, depuis que j'avais retrouvé Erik, installé à l'Opéra, je vivais dans une perpétuelle terreur de ses horribles fantaisies, non point en ce qui pouvait me concerner, certes, mais je redoutais tout de lui pour les autres[10]. Et quand il arrivait quelque accident, quelque événement fatal, je ne manquais point de me dire: «C'est peut-être Erik!...» comme d'autres disaient autour de moi: «C'est le Fantôme!...» Que de fois n'ai-je point entendu prononcer cette phrase par des gens qui souriaient! Les malheureux! s'ils avaient su que ce fantôme existait en chair et en os et était autrement terrible que l'ombre vaine qu'ils évoquaient, je jure bien qu'ils eussent cessé de se moquer!... S'ils avaient su seulement ce dont Erik était capable, surtout dans un champ de manœuvre comme l'Opéra!... Et s'ils avaient connu le fin fond de ma pensée redoutable!...","It was from that day on that I gave up trying to enter his house by the lake! Obviously, that entrance was too well guarded, especially since he knew I knew it. But I thought there must be another one, because more than once I had seen Erik disappear in the third underside, while I was watching him and without my being able to imagine how. I cannot repeat it too often, since I had found Erik, installed at the Opera, I lived in a perpetual terror of his horrible fantasies, not at all as far as I was concerned, of course, but I dreaded everything about him for others[10]. And when some accident happened, some fatal event, I did not fail to say to myself: “It may be Erik!...” as others said around me: “It is the Phantom!... How many times have I heard this phrase pronounced by people who were smiling! Unfortunate! if they had known that this phantom existed in flesh and blood and was more terrible than the vain shadow they evoked, I swear they would have ceased to make fun!... If they had only known this of which Erik was capable, especially in a field of maneuver like the Opera!... And if they had known the depths of my formidable thought!...","Henceforth I relinquished all thought of reaching his lair from the lake. That route was obviously too well guarded, especially now that he knew that I was aware of it. But I felt that there must be another way into it, for on more than one occasion when I was spying on him below stage, I noticed that Erik was suddenly able to disappear from the third mezzanine. Yet I knew not how. I must repeat that ever since I had discovered that Erik had settled in the Opera House, I lived in perpetual terror of his devastating whims, not so much for my own sake as for that of others. * Whenever some accident, some fatal event occurred, I would ask myself: ‘Did Erik do this?’ while the others cried: ‘The ghost did it!’ – often enough with a smile on their faces! Poor devils! Had they known that their ghost was made of flesh and blood, and far more terrible than the vain shadow of their imagination, their smiles would have quickly faded. If only they had known to what extremes Erik could go, especially in an arena such as the Paris Opera House! Or had any inkling of the appalling fears that troubled me!","It was on that day that I gave up any idea of breaking into his house from the lake! The entrance on that side was clearly far too well guarded, especially now that he’d seen that I knew about it. But I suspected that there was another way in. More than once I’d followed Erik down to the third level where he would suddenly vanish, though I had been watching him closely, and I could never work out how he managed it. I cannot say too often that since I had found Erik ensconced in the Opera I had been living in a state of permanent fear of his murderous impulses, not because I was afraid for myself but because of what he might do to others.1 Whenever there was an accident in which someone was killed, I never failed to wonder: ‘Could it be Erik?…’ just as others would say: ‘The Phantom did it!’ How many times have I heard those words from people who spoke them with a smile on their lips! The fools! If they’d known that the Phantom was a creature of flesh and blood and far more dangerous than their inane ideas about ghosts, believe me, they’d have smiled on the other side of their faces!… If they’d only known what Erik was capable of, especially on a battleground like the Opera!… and if they’d only known how full of forebodings my real thoughts were…’","From that day, I gave up all thought of penetrating into his house by the lake. That entrance was obviously too well guarded, especially since he had learned that I knew about it. But I felt that there must be another entrance, for I had often seen Erik disappear in the third cellar, when I was watching him, though I could not imagine how. Ever since I had discovered Erik installed in the Opera, I lived in a perpetual terror of his horrible fancies, not in so far as I was concerned, but I dreaded everything for others.† And whenever some accident, some fatal event happened, I always thought to myself, “I should not be surprised if that were Erik,” even as others used to say, “It’s the ghost!” How often have I not heard people utter that phrase with a smile! Poor devils! If they had known that the ghost existed in the flesh, I swear they would not have laughed!"

"Christine se mit à écrire, posément, tranquillement, si pacifiquement, que Raoul, qui tremblait encore du drame qui les séparait, en fut singulièrement et fâcheusement impressionné. «Que de sang-froid!» se dit-il...

"—Ne le croyez point!... Erik avait besoin d'argent.. Se croyant hors de l'humanité, il n'était point gêné par le scrupule et il se servait des dons extraordinaires d'adresse et d'imagination qu'il avait reçus de la nature en compensation de l'atroce laideur dont elle l'avait doté, pour exploiter les humains, et cela quelquefois de la façon la plus artistique du monde, car le tour valait souvent son pesant d'or. S'il a rendu les quarante mille francs, de son propre mouvement, à MM. Richard et Moncharmin, c'est qu'au moment de la restitution il n'en avait plus besoin! Il avait renoncé à son mariage avec Christine Daaé. Il avait renoncé à toutes les choses du dessus de la terre.","—Don't believe it!...Erik needed money. he had received from nature in compensation for the atrocious ugliness with which she had endowed him, to exploit humans, and that sometimes in the most artistic way in the world, because the trick was often worth its weight in gold.

He had renounced his marriage with Christine Daaé. He had renounced all things above the earth.","‘Don’t you believe it,’ the Persian replied. ‘Erik needed money. And, thinking himself beyond the pale of humanity, was not held back by moral scruples. He employed the extraordinary skills and imagination that nature had bestowed upon him, in compensation for his monstrous ugliness, to prey upon his fellow-man, in ways that were not only sometimes artistically inventive but also often highly profitable. He returned the forty thousand francs because he no longer needed that money. He had abandoned his plan to marry Christine Daaé; he had renounced the world and all it offered.’","‘Don’t believe it for one moment!… Erik needed the money. Considering himself to be beyond the human pale, he was not constrained by moral scruples and used the immense gifts of dexterity and imagination which he had received from nature to compensate for the appalling disfigurement with which he had been afflicted: he used his talents to exploit people. His schemes, though sometimes devised and executed with the flair of an artist, usually made him a profit. If he returned the forty thousand francs to Messrs Richard and Moncharmin of his own accord, it was because he no longer needed the money! He had given up all thought of marrying Christine Daaé. He wanted nothing more to do with what life at ground level could offer.’","“Erik wanted money.

"Pendant que le bonhomme disait ces choses, Raoul regardait les yeux bleus et la chevelure dorée de Christine. Et Christine pensait que la petite Lotte était bienheureuse d'entendre en s'endormant l'Ange de la musique. Il n'était guère d'histoire du père Daaé où n'intervînt l'Ange de la musique, et les enfants lui demandaient des explications sur cet Ange, à n'en plus finir. Le père Daaé prétendait que tous les grands musiciens, tous les grands artistes reçoivent au moins une fois dans leur vie la visite de l'Ange de la musique. Cet Ange s'est penché quelquefois sur leur berceau, comme il est arrivé à la petite Lotte, et c'est ainsi qu'il y a de petits prodiges qui jouent du violon à six ans mieux que des hommes de cinquante, ce qui, vous l'avouerez, est tout à fait extraordinaire. Quelquefois, l'Ange vient beaucoup plus tard, parce que les enfants ne sont pas sages et ne veulent pas apprendre leur méthode et négligent leurs gammes. Quelquefois, l'Ange ne vient jamais, parce qu'on n'a pas le cœur pur ni une conscience tranquille. On ne voit jamais l'Ange, mais il se fait entendre aux âmes prédestinées. C'est souvent dans les moments qu'elles s'y attendent le moins, quand elles sont tristes et découragées. Alors, l'oreille perçoit tout à coup des harmonies célestes, une voix divine, et s'en souvient toute la vie. Les personnes qui sont visitées par l'Ange en restent comme enflammées. Elles vibrent d'un frisson que ne connaît point le reste des mortels. Et elles ont ce privilège de ne plus pouvoir toucher un instrument ou ouvrir la bouche pour chanter, sans faire entendre des sons qui font honte par leur beauté à tous les autres sons humains. Les gens qui ne savent pas que l'Ange a visité ces personnes disent qu'elles ont du génie.","While the fellow was saying these things, Raoul looked at Christine's blue eyes and golden hair. And Christine thought that little Lotte was happy to hear the Angel of Music in her sleep. There was hardly a story of Father Daaé where the Angel of Music did not intervene, and the children asked him endless explanations about this Angel. Father Daaé claimed that all great musicians, all great artists receive at least once in their life the visit of the Angel of Music. This Angel has sometimes leaned over their cradle, as happened to little Lotte, and it is thus that there are little prodigies who play the violin at six years old better than men of fifty, which, you will admit, is quite extraordinary. Sometimes the Angel comes much later, because the children are unwise and unwilling to learn their method and neglect their scales. Sometimes the Angel never comes, because you don't have a pure heart or a clear conscience. We never see the Angel, but he makes himself heard by predestined souls. It's often when they least expect it, when they're sad and discouraged. Then the ear suddenly perceives celestial harmonies, a divine voice, and remembers it for life. The people who are visited by the Angel remain inflamed by it. They vibrate with a shiver that the rest of mortals do not know. And they have this privilege of no longer being able to touch an instrument or open their mouths to sing, without making sounds that shame all other human sounds by their beauty. People who don't know that the Angel visited these people say they have genius.","While the old man told this story, Raoul gazed at Christine’s blue eyes and golden hair; and Christine felt that Lotte was very fortunate to hear the Angel of Music as she went to sleep. In fact, the Angel of Music featured in all but a few of the stories, and the children asked about him endlessly. Daaé maintained that all great musicians, all great performers were visited by the Angel of Music at least once in their lives. Sometimes the Angel leaned over their cradle, as happened to Lotte, which was why some child prodigies as young as six could play the violin better than men of fifty – and that, admittedly, was astounding. Sometimes the Angel came much later, because the children had been naughty and had not learned their lessons or practised their scales. And sometimes the Angel did not come at all because the children lacked a pure heart and a clear conscience. The Angel was never seen but could be heard by those who were meant to hear. This often happened when you least expected it, when you were sad and down-hearted. Then your ears would suddenly hear celestial harmonies, a divine voice, which you would remember for ever. Those who had been visited by the Angel were stirred. They experienced a thrill unknown to other mortals and henceforth could not touch an instrument or open their mouths to sing without producing sounds that put all other musicians to shame. The people who knew nothing about the angelic visitation called them geniuses.","When the fiddler reached that part of the story, Raoul would look at Christine’s blue eyes and golden hair. And Christine would think that little Lotte was very lucky to be able to hear the Angel of Music as she went to sleep. There was hardly a story which M. Daaé told that did not involve the Angel of Music, and both children asked him time and time again to say who this Angel was. He claimed that all great musicians, all great singers are visited by the Angel of Music at least once in their lives. Sometimes he leans over their cradles, as happened to little Lotte, and that is why there are child prodigies of six who play the violin better than grown men of fifty, a fact which, you must admit, is quite extraordinary. In other cases, the Angel appears much later because children are badly behaved and won’t learn their lessons or practise their scales. Sometimes the Angel never comes at all because some children don’t have a pure heart or a clear conscience. No one has ever seen the Angel, but he speaks to the hearts of the chosen. He often comes when they least expect it, when they feel downcast and discouraged. Then their ears fill with the harmonies of the spheres, a divine voice, and remember that moment for the rest of their lives. Those who are visited by the Angel blaze with a fire that never stops burning. They experience a thrill unknown to the rest of mortal kind. They are blessed, for they never pick up an instrument or open their mouths to sing without producing sounds whose beauty puts all other human sounds to shame. Those unaware that such fortunate individuals have been visited by the Angel say that they have been touched by genius.","While the old man told this story, Raoul looked at Christine’s blue eyes and golden hair; and Christine thought that Lotte was very lucky to hear the Angel of Music when she went to sleep. The Angel of Music played a part in all Daddy Daaé’s tales; and he maintained that every great musician, every great artist received a visit from the Angel at least once in his life. Sometimes the Angel leans over their cradle, as happened to Lotte, and that is how there are little prodigies who play the fiddle at six better than men at fifty, which, you must admit, is very wonderful. Sometimes, the Angel comes much later, because the children are naughty and won’t learn their lessons or practise their scales. And, sometimes, he does not come at all, because the children have a bad heart or a bad conscience. No one ever sees the Angel; but he is heard by those who are meant to hear him. He often comes when they least expect him, when they are sad and disheartened. Then their ears suddenly perceive celestial harmonies, a divine voice, which they remember all their lives. Persons who are visited by the Angel quiver with a thrill unknown to the rest of mankind. And they can not touch an instrument, or open their mouths to sing, without producing sounds that put all other human sounds to shame. Then people who do not know that the Angel has visited those persons say that they have genius."

"—Les onze heures qui doivent décider de la vie ou de la mort!... Il vient de me le répéter en partant, reprend la voix râlante de Christine... Il est épouvantable!...

C'est-à-dire que tu n'auras qu'à tourner le scorpion sur son pivot, dans la position contraire à celle où tu l'auras trouvé... cela signifiera à mes yeux, quand je rentrerai dans la chambre Louis-Philippe, dans la chambre des fiançailles: oui!... La sauterelle, elle, si tu la tournes, voudra dire: non! à mes yeux, quand, je rentrerai dans la chambre Louis-Philippe, dans la chambre de la mort!... Et il riait comme un démon ivre! Moi, je ne faisais que lui réclamer à genoux la clef de la chambre des supplices, lui promettant d'être à jamais sa femme s'il m'accordait cela... Mais il m'a dit qu'on n'aurait plus besoin jamais de cette clef et qu'il allait la jeter au fond du lac!... Et puis, en riant comme un démon ivre, il m'a laissé en me disant qu'il ne reviendrait que dans cinq minutes, à cause qu'il savait tout ce que l'on doit, quand on est un galant homme, à la pudeur des femmes!...

I don't want you to blush in front of me when you say ""yes"" to me, like shy fiancées!... What the devil! we know his world!” I told you he was like a drunken demon!... “Look!

In one of these caskets, you will find a scorpion and in the other a grasshopper, animals very well imitated in bronze from Japan; they are animals that say yes and no! That is to say that you will only have to turn the scorpion on its pivot, in the opposite position to that in which you will have found it... this will mean in my eyes, when I return to the room Louis -Philippe, in the engagement room: yes!... The grasshopper, if you turn it, will mean: no! in my eyes, when, I shall return to the Louis-Philippe room, to the room of death!... And he was laughing like a drunken demon! Me, all I did was ask him on my knees for the key to the torture chamber, promising to be his wife forever if he granted me that... But he told me that we wouldn't have any more ever need this key and that he was going to throw it at the bottom of the lake!... And then, laughing like a drunken demon, he left me, telling me that he would not be back for five that he knew all that one owes, when one is a gallant man, to the modesty of women!

A grasshopper doesn't just turn, it jumps!... it jumps!... it jumps pretty well!. ..","‘The hour that will decide between life or death! That’s what he said just before he left,’ Christine replied, in an agonized voice. ‘ He was terrifying. He raved like a madman, he tore off his mask and his yellow eyes shot flames!

Forever the gentleman, I will spare you your blushes. See” – he took one of the keys of life and death from his leather pouch – “here is the little bronze key to open the two ebony caskets on the mantelpiece in the Louis-Philippe room.

But if, on my return, I find that it is the grasshopper that has been chosen, then I shall it take to mean no and this room will become our mausoleum.” And once again he laughed diabolically. I continued to beg him for the key to the torture chamber, promising to be his wife if he granted me just that one wish. But he replied that there was no further need for that key and he would throw it into the lake! He left, warning me that he would be back in five minutes’ time, and his parting words were: “The grasshopper! Beware of the grasshopper! A grasshopper not only turns: it leaps … leaps into the air … straight up into the air.” ’","‘It’s the eleven o’clock which will decide between life and death… He told me so again as he was leaving,’ said Christine in a tight voice. ‘ He’s terrifying!… He’s raving, he’s torn his mask off and his yellow eyes flash fire!

I kept pleading with him on my knees to give me the key to the torture chamber, promising to be his wife for ever and ever if only he’d grant me that one wish… But he said we’d not be needing the key now and that he was going to throw it into the lake!… Then, still laughing crazily, he went out saying he would give me five minutes alone, for he was a gentleman and knew how a gentleman should treat a lady!… And he shouted as he left, he said: “Take care with the grasshopper!… Grasshoppers don’t just turn, they go off!… suddenly!…up into the air! … sky high!”’","“The eleven o‘clock that is to decide life or death! ...

"J'ai dit que cette chambre dans laquelle nous nous trouvions, M. le vicomte de Chagny et moi, était régulièrement hexagonale et garnie entièrement de glaces. On a vu depuis, notamment dans certaines expositions, de ces sortes de chambres absolument disposées ainsi et appelées: «maison des mirages» ou «palais des illusions». Mais l'invention en revient entièrement à Erik, qui construisit, sous mes yeux, la première salle de ce genre lors des Heures roses de Mazenderan. Il suffisait de disposer dans les coins quelque motif décoratif, comme une colonne, par exemple, pour avoir instantanément un palais aux mille colonnes, car, par l'effet des glaces, la salle réelle s'augmentait de six salles hexagonales dont chacune se multipliait à l'infini. Jadis, pour amuser «la petite sultane», il avait ainsi disposé un décor qui devenait le «temple innombrable»; mais la petite sultane se fatigua vite d'une aussi enfantine illusion, et alors Erik transforma son invention en chambre des supplices. Au lieu du motif architectural posé dans les coins, il mit au premier tableau un arbre de fer. Pourquoi cet arbre, qui imitait parfaitement la vie, avec ses feuilles peintes, était-il en fer? Parce qu'il devait être assez solide pour résister à toutes les attaques du «patient» que l'on enfermait dans la chambre des supplices. Nous verrons comment, par deux fois, le décor ainsi obtenu se transformait instantanément en deux autres décors successifs, grâce à la rotation automatique des tambours qui se trouvaient dans les coins et qui avaient été divisés par tiers, épousant les angles des glaces et supportant chacun un motif décoratif qui apparaissait tour à tour.","I said that this room in which we found ourselves, M. le Vicomte de Chagny and myself, was regularly hexagonal and furnished entirely with mirrors. We have since seen, especially in certain exhibitions, these sorts of rooms arranged absolutely in this way and called: ""house of mirages"" or ""palace of illusions"". But the invention lies entirely with Erik, who built, before my eyes, the first room of this kind during the Pink Hours of Mazenderan. It was enough to arrange some decorative motif in the corners, such as a column, for example, to instantly have a palace with a thousand columns, for, by the effect of the mirrors, the real hall was increased by six hexagonal halls, each of which multiplied to infinity. Formerly, to amuse ""the little sultana"", he had arranged a setting which became the ""innumerable temple""; but the little sultana soon grew tired of such a childish illusion, and so Erik transformed his invention into a torture chamber. Instead of the architectural motif placed in the corners, he put an iron tree on the first board. Why was this tree, which perfectly imitated life, with its painted leaves, made of iron? Because it had to be strong enough to withstand all the attacks of the ""patient"" who was locked up in the torture chamber. We will see how, twice, the decor thus obtained was instantly transformed into two other successive decors, thanks to the automatic rotation of the drums which were in the corners and which had been divided into thirds, marrying the angles of the mirrors and each supporting a decorative pattern that appeared in turn.","I have already said that the Viscount and I were trapped in a hexagonal room, regular in shape and lined with mirrors from top to bottom. Since then, many rooms have been designed on this model; they are mainly exhibited at fairgrounds and variously called ‘the hall of mirrors’, ‘the palace of illusions’ or some such name. But the author of this invention was none other than Erik himself. I saw him build the first room of this kind at the time of the Rosy Hours of Mazenderan. A single decorative feature placed in one corner, such as a column, was enough to create instantaneously a hall with a thousand columns; for, thanks to the mirrors, the real room was multiplied by six, each reflection being, in its turn, multiplied endlessly. To amuse the young sultana, Erik had designed a room that could thus become ‘an infinite temple’, but she soon tired of this trifling illusion, whereupon Erik turned the room into a torture chamber. An iron tree with painted leaves replaced the architectural motif in the corner. This tree was absolutely life-like but made of iron so as to withstand any assault from the ‘patient’ imprisoned in the chamber. The resulting view could, as we shall later see, change instantaneously through the use of automatically rotating winding-drums with varying painted motifs that fitted neatly into the angles of the mirrors. These allowed three different sets of decorative features to appear in sequence.","I HAVE explained that the chamber in which the Viscount and I found ourselves was a regular hexagon lined from floor to ceiling with reflecting glass. Since those days, certain shows and exhibitions have featured exact replicas of such chambers. They are usually called a ‘Hall of Mirrors’ or a ‘Palace of Illusions’. But their creation was entirely Erik’s own, as I know because I was there when he built the first chamber of this type in the era of the Rosy Hours of Mazanderan. All that was needed was to place a decorative object in one corner, a column for instance, to create an instant Palace of a Thousand Columns, for the combined effect of the reflection expanded the actual chamber by creating six further hexagonal chambers each of which was multiplied ad infinitum. In those days, to keep the Sultana amused, he had dreamed up a decor which became a ‘temple innumerable’. But the Sultana soon wearied of this basic optical effect, so Erik turned his invention into a torture chamber. For the architectural motif installed in one corner, he substituted a tree made of iron. Why was his tree, which was perfectly lifelike with its hand-painted leaves, made of iron? Because it needed to be strong enough to withstand the most frenzied onslaught by any ‘patient’ locked up in the torture chamber. We shall see, twice, how the illusion thus created could be changed instantly by bringing into play two additional motifs by means of rotating painted reflective inserts located in each corner. These revolving inserts had three distinct faces and slotted flush into the angles made by the silvered wall panels, each face having its own decorative motif which appeared as the insert revolved.","I have said that the room in which M. le Vicomte de Chagny and I were imprisoned was a regular hexagon, lined entirely with mirrors. Plenty of these rooms have been seen since, mainly at exhibitions: they are called “palaces of illusion,” or some such name. But the invention belongs entirely to Erik, who built the first room of this kind under my eyes, at the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan. A decorative object, such as a column, for instance, was placed in one of the corners and immediately produced a hall of a thousand columns; for, thanks to the mirrors, the real room was multiplied by six hexagonal rooms, each of which, in its turn, was multiplied indefinitely. But the little sultana soon tired of this infantile illusion, whereupon Erik altered his invention into a “torture-chamber.” For the architectural motive placed in one corner, he substituted an iron tree. This tree, with its painted leaves, was absolutely true to life and was made of iron so as to resist all the attacks of the “patient” who was locked into the torture-chamber. We shall see how the scene thus obtained was twice altered instantaneously into two successive other scenes, by means of the automatic rotation of the drums or rollers in the corners. These were divided into three sections, fitting into the angles of the mirrors and each supporting a decorative scheme that came into sight as the roller revolved upon its axis."

"À cet endroit de son récit, il paraît que le Fantôme se leva si solennellement que le Persan qui avait repris sa place dans son fauteuil dut se lever, lui aussi, comme obéissant au même mouvement et sentant qu'il était impossible de rester assis dans un moment aussi solennel et même (m'a dit le Persan lui-même) il ôta, bien qu'il eût la tête rase, son bonnet d'astrakan.","At this point in his story, it seems that the Phantom got up so solemnly that the Persian who had resumed his place in his armchair had to get up, too, as if obeying the same movement and feeling that it was impossible to remain seated in a moment so solemn and even (the Persian himself told me) he took off, although his head was shaved, his astrakhan cap.","At this point, the Phantom rose to his feet with such gravity that the Persian, who had returned to his chair, felt impelled to rise too, sensing that the solemnity of the moment demanded such a response.

"Pour moi, je ne vivais plus!... Bien qu'Erik m'eût annoncé fort solennellement qu'il avait bien changé et qu'il était devenu le plus vertueux des hommes, depuis qu'il était aimé pour lui-même, phrase qui me laissa sur le coup affreusement perplexe, je ne pouvais m'empêcher de frémir en songeant au monstre. Son horrible, unique et repoussante laideur le mettait au ban de l'humanité, et il m'était apparu bien souvent qu'il ne se croyait plus, par cela même, aucun devoir vis-à-vis de la race humaine. La façon dont il m'avait parlé de ses amours n'avait fait qu'augmenter mes transes, car je prévoyais dans cet événement auquel il avait fait allusion sur un ton de hâblerie que je lui connaissais, le cause de drames nouveaux et plus affreux que tout le reste. Je savais jusqu'à quel degré de sublime et désastreux désespoir pouvait aller la douleur d'Erik, et les propos qu'il m'avait tenus—vaguement annonciateurs de la plus horrible catastrophe—ne cessaient point d'habiter ma pensée redoutable.","For me, I no longer lived!... Although Erik had announced to me very solemnly that he had changed a great deal and that he had become the most virtuous of men since he was loved for himself, sentence that left me terribly perplexed, I couldn't help but shudder thinking about the monster. His horrible, unique and repulsive ugliness put him on the outskirts of humanity, and it had often occurred to me that he no longer believed himself, for that very reason, to have any duty towards the human race. The manner in which he had spoken to me of his loves had only increased my trances, for I foresaw in this event, to which he had alluded in a tone of boastfulness that I knew him, the cause of new and more dreadful dramas. than everything else. I knew to what degree of sublime and disastrous despair Erik's pain could go, and the words he had spoken to me—vaguely heralding the most horrible catastrophe—did not cease to inhabit my dreadful thoughts.","Or had any inkling of the appalling fears that troubled me! Erik had earnestly announced to me that he had changed, and had become the most virtuous of men since he was now loved for himself. This phrase disturbed me greatly – I could not help shuddering at the very thought of it. His ghastly, unique and repulsive ugliness had put him beyond the pale of humanity; I had gathered the impression that it had freed him from any obligations towards mankind. The tone of his voice when he boasted of his newly found love only served to further my anxiety: having heard it before, I dreaded that it might foreshadow new and more appalling atrocities. I knew to what sublime and disastrous climax Erik ’s despair could rise and the words he had spoken – vague intimations of impending disaster – left me in constant dread.","My life was no longer my own!… Erik had given me his solemn assurance that he had changed and that he had become a really good man ever since he had been loved for himself, words which left me totally baffled. But I could not repress a shudder whenever I thought of the monster. His horrifying, unique, repulsive ugliness placed him outside human society, and I had good reason to think that, as a direct consequence, he no longer felt he owed the human race anything. The way he had spoken of being in love merely increased my fears, for I saw in this new development which he spoke of in that boastful way he had, the seed of new horrors more vile than anything than had gone before. I knew to what sublime heights Erik’s sufferings could rise but also to what abysmal depths they could sink. What he had said to me—vague hints threatening the most appalling disasters—continued to dominate my worst thoughts.","If they had known that the ghost existed in the flesh, I swear they would not have laughed! Although Erik announced to me very solemnly that he had changed and that he had become the most virtuous of men since he was loved for himself—a sentence that, at first, perplexed me most terribly —I could not help shuddering when I thought of the monster. His horrible, unparalleled and repulsive uglinessput him without the pale of humanity; and it often seemed to me that, for this reason, he no longer believed that he had any duty toward the human race. The way in which he spoke of his love-affairs only increased my alarm, for I foresaw the cause of fresh and more hideous tragedies in this event to which he alluded so boastfully."
"Sur ce dernier coup, nous ne pûmes que nous lever et serrer chaleureusement les mains de nos deux prédécesseurs en les félicitant d'avoir imaginé cette charmante plaisanterie, qui prouvait que la vieille gaieté française ne perdait jamais ses droits. Richard crut même devoir ajouter qu'il comprenait maintenant pourquoi MM. Debienne et Poligny quittaient la direction de l'Académie nationale de musique. Les affaires n'étaient plus possibles avec un fantôme aussi exigeant.","On this last blow, we could only get up and warmly shake hands with our two predecessors, congratulating them on having thought up this charming joke, which proved that old French gaiety never lost its rights. Richard even thought it his duty to add that he now understood why MM. Debienne and Poligny left the management of the National Academy of Music. Business was no longer possible with such a demanding ghost.","Upon hearing this, we rose to our feet, warmly shook our predecessors’ hands and congratulated them on their charming little mystification, which proved that the old French sense of humour was not on the wane. Richard even added that he now understood why Debienne and Poligny were resigning their positions at the National Academy of Music. ‘Business as usual’ was clearly impossible with so demanding a ghost.","‘At this point all we could do was to rise, shake the hands of our two predecessors warmly and congratulate them on coming up with such a splendid leg-pull. It showed that the traditional French sense of fun was not dead. Richard went so far as to add that he now understood why Messrs Debienne and Poligny were retiring as Directors of the National Academy of Music: it would be impossible to run the place with a house Phantom that made such demands.","“When we saw this, there was nothing else for us to do but to rise from our chairs, shake our two predecessors warmly by the hand and congratulate them on thinking of this charming little joke, which proved that the old French sense of humour was never likely to become extinct.

"À l'époque des «pardons», des fêtes de villages, des danses et des «dérobées», il partit comme autrefois, avec son violon, et il avait le droit d'emmener sa fille pendant huit jours. On ne se lassait point de les écouter. Ils versaient pour toute l'année de l'harmonie dans les moindres hameaux, et couchaient la nuit dans des granges, refusant le lit de l'auberge, se serrant sur la paille l'un contre l'autre, comme au temps où ils étaient si pauvres en Suède.","At the time of ""pardons"", village festivals, dances and ""snatches"", he left as before, with his violin, and he had the right to take his daughter for eight days. We never got tired of listening to them. They poured harmony throughout the year into the smallest hamlets, and slept at night in barns, refusing the bed of the inn, huddled together on the straw, as in the days when they were so poor in Sweden.","Henceforth for a whole week during the religious festivals known as ‘pardons’ and other village celebrations and dances, he would go off with his fiddle as in the olden days, taking his daughter along with him. The villagers never tired of listening to them. Daaé and his daughter gave even the smallest of hamlets a cornucopia of musical delights to last them for a whole year. At night, having turned down the offer of a bed at the local inn, they slept in barns, lying close together on the straw as they had done in Sweden when they were very poor.","In those days of Breton pardons, or processional pilgrimages, of village fêtes, country dances and other local festivals, he would set out as he used to, with his violin and his daughter, for a week at a time. They filled the smallest hamlets with enough music to last the whole year. They slept in barns, in preference to a room at an inn, snuggling up next to each other in the straw just as in the old days when they were so poor in Sweden.","At the time of the “pardons,” or Breton pilgrimages, the village festival and dances, he went off with his fiddle, as in the old days, and was allowed to take his daughter with him for a week.

"Après avoir monté et descendu plusieurs escaliers inconnus de Raoul, les deux hommes se trouvèrent en face d'une porte que le Persan ouvrit avec un petit passe-partout qu'il tira d'une poche de son gilet. Le Persan, comme Raoul, était naturellement en habit. Seulement, si Raoul avait un chapeau haute forme, le Persan avait un bonnet d'astrakan, ainsi que je l'ai déjà fait remarquer. C'était un accroc au code d'élégance qui régissait les coulisses où le chapeau haute forme est exigé, mais il est entendu qu'en France on permet tout aux étrangers: la casquette de voyage aux Anglais, le bonnet d'astrakan aux Persans.","After going up and down several stairs unknown to Raoul, the two men found themselves in front of a door which the Persian opened with a small master key he took from a pocket in his waistcoat. The Persian, like Raoul, was naturally dressed. Only, if Raoul had a tall hat, the Persian had an astrakhan cap, as I have already pointed out. It was a hitch to the code of elegance that governed backstage where the tall hat is required, but it is understood that in France everything is allowed to foreigners: the travel cap to the English, the astrakhan cap to the Persians .","After ascending and descending several flights of stairs unknown to Raoul, the two men found themselves outside a door that the Persian opened with a master-key drawn from his waistcoat. Of course, the Persian and Raoul were still in dress-clothes; but, whereas Raoul wore a top hat, the Persian wore the astrakhan hat that I have already mentioned. This was a breach of the Opera dress code, which demanded that a top hat be worn backstage; save that in France foreigners may do as they please: the Englishman may keep his travelling-cap and the Persian his astrakhan hat.","They went up and down several flights of stairs unfamiliar to Raoul. Then they came to a door which the Persian unlocked with a small pass key which he took from his waistcoat pocket. Like Raoul, the Persian was, of course, in evening dress. But whereas Raoul had a top hat, the Persian was wearing, as I have already said, a kind of fez made of astrakhan. It was a departure from the strict dress code observed backstage where a topper is de rigueur. But in France, extreme latitude is allowed to foreigners: an Englishman may keep his travelling hat and a Persian his astrakhan fez.","After going up and down several staircases which Raoul had never seen before, the two men found themselves in front of a door which the Persian opened with a master-key. The Persian and Raoul were both, of course, in dress-clothes; but, whereas Raoul had a tall hat, the Persian wore the astrakhan cap which I have already mentioned. It was an infringement of the rule which insists upon the tall hat behind the scenes; but in France foreigners are allowed every license: the Englishman his travelling-cap, the Persian his cap of astrakhan."
"—Comment vous croyez-vous plus en sûreté dans cette loge que dans le théâtre? demanda Raoul. Puisque vous l'entendiez à travers les murs, il peut nous entendre.","""How do you think yourself safer in this box than in the theatre?"" asked Raoul. Since you heard him through the walls, he can hear us.","As they reached Christine’s dressing-room, he asked: ‘Why do you feel safer in this room than in any other part of the theatre? If you could hear him through the walls, he can hear us too.’","‘Do you think you’re safer here than in any other part of the theatre?’ asked Raoul. ‘If you can hear him through your wall, surely he can hear us.’","“Why do you think that you are safer in this room than on the stage?” asked Raoul. “You heard him through the walls here, therefore he can certainly hear us.”"
"Cette fois, Richard était reparti à rire de compagnie avec Moncharmin et le secrétaire Rémy; mais instruit par l'expérience, l'inspecteur ne riait plus. Appuyé au mur, il se demandait, en remuant fébrilement ses clefs dans sa poche, comment cette histoire allait finir. Et plus Mame Giry le prenait sur un ton «rogue», plus il craignait le retour de la colère de M. le directeur! Et maintenant, voilà que devant l'hilarité directoriale, Mame Giry osait devenir menaçante! menaçante en vérité!","This time, Richard had gone back to laughing in company with Moncharmin and the secretary Rémy; but learned by experience, the inspector no longer laughed. Leaning against the wall, he wondered, feverishly shifting his keys in his pocket, how this story was going to end. And the more Mame Giry took him in a ""sneer"" tone, the more he feared the return of the director's anger! And now, in front of the managerial hilarity, Mame Giry dared to become threatening! threatening indeed!","She stared at Richard who, together with Moncharmin and Rémy, the secretary, was laughing again. Only the house manager, seasoned by experience, was careful not to laugh. He was leaning against the wall, anxiously fumbling with the keys in his pocket and wondering where all this was going. And the more arrogant Mme Giry became, the more he feared some fresh outburst of directorial anger. In the face of the co-directors’ mirth, her tone became positively threatening.","This time, Richard burst out laughing again along with Moncharmin and Rémy, the secretary. Having learned by experience, the security officer took good care not to laugh. He leaned against the wall, nervously played with the keys in his pocket and wondered how it would all end. And the more irascible Mme Giry became, the more he was afraid M. Richard would lose his temper again. And now, confronted by the laughter of both Directors, Mme Giry was likely to turn nasty! Really nasty!","This time, Richard burst out laughing, as did Moncharmin and Rémy, the secretary. Only the inspector, warned by experience, was careful not to laugh, while Mame Giry ventured to adopt an attitude that was positively threatening."
"—Je comprends! je comprends! s'écria le vicomte, et il prit congé avec précipitation de la vieille maman qui se demandait en a parte si le vicomte n'était pas un peu toqué.","-I understand! I understand! exclaimed the Viscount, and he took leave with haste of the old mamma, who was wondering aside if the Viscount was not a little crazy.","‘Yes, I do see!’ cried the Viscount. And he took leave of Mme Valerius with such haste that she asked herself privately if the young nobleman was not a little off his head.","‘I do! I do indeed!’ cried the Viscount and he hurriedly departed, leaving the old lady wondering whether he was entirely right in the head.",I see!” cried the viscount.
"—On a, répondit-il, sur un ton singulier, les «rendez-vous» qu'on peut.","“We have,” he replied, in a singular tone, “the meetings we can.","‘ “One must create the opportunities one can,” he replied oddly.","‘“We must seize”, he said in a strange voice, “our opportunities whenever they arise.”","“After lunch, he rose and gave me the tips of his fingers, saying he would like to show me over his flat; but I snatched away my hand and gave a cry."

"Raoul vit alors son visage et ne put retenir une exclamation de surprise et d'effroi. Les fraîches couleurs d'autrefois avaient disparu. Une pâleur mortelle s'étendait sur ces traits qu'il avait connus si charmants et si doux, reflets de la grâce paisible et de la conscience sans combat. Comme ils étaient tourmentés maintenant! Le sillon de la douleur les avait impitoyablement creusés et les beaux yeux clairs de Christine, autrefois limpides comme les lacs qui servaient d'yeux à la petite Lotte, apparaissaient ce soir d'une profondeur obscure, mystérieuse et insondable, et tout cernés d'une ombre effroyablement triste.","Raoul then saw his face and could not restrain an exclamation of surprise and terror. The fresh colors of yesteryear had disappeared. A deathly pallor lay over those features he had known so charming and gentle, reflections of peaceful grace and unchallenged awareness. How tormented they were now! The furrow of pain had pitilessly dug them and Christine's beautiful clear eyes, once limpid like the lakes that served as eyes for little Lotte, appeared this evening from a dark, mysterious and unfathomable depth, and all surrounded by a frighteningly sad shadow.","He now saw her face and could not suppress a cry of surprise and shock. Gone was her fresh, glowing complexion. No longer a reflection of her tranquil disposition and untroubled conscience, her face – so charming and gentle in former days – was deadly pale. How anguished she looked now! Her features were cruelly furrowed by sorrow and her beautiful, limpid eyes – Little Lotte’s eyes – had become wells of deep, dark, unfathomable mystery and were bordered with terribly doleful shadows.","When he saw her face, he could not suppress an exclamation of shocked surprise. The freshness had gone from her cheeks. A deathly pallor had claimed her features which he remembered as sweet and lovely, the outer reflection of her candid nature and clear conscience. But how ravaged was that face now! Sorrow had ploughed deep, cruel furrows there and those bright eyes which once had been as blue and clear as the lakes which had described little Lotte’s gaze, tonight were bottomless, dark, mysterious, unfathomable and ringed with shadows of unutterable sadness.","Raoul now saw her face and could not restrain an exclamation of surprise and terror. The fresh complexion of former days was gone. A mortal pallor covered those features, which he had known so charming and so gentle, and sorrow had furrowed them with pitiless lines and traced dark and unspeakably sad shadows under her eyes."

"Et l'inspecteur ricana. Mais encore il comprit qu'il avait eu tort de ricaner, car il n'avait point plutôt prononcé ces mots: elle dit que c'est le fantôme de l'Opéra! que la physionomie de M.

But he also understood that he had been wrong to sneer, for he hadn't uttered those words earlier: she says it's the Phantom of the Opera! that M.

"Toute cette journée se passa en discussions, pourparlers, signatures ou ruptures de contrats; aussi je vous prie de croire que ce soir-là—le soir du 25 janvier—nos deux directeurs, fatigués par une âpre journée de colères, d'intrigues, de recommandations, de menaces, de protestations d'amour ou de haine, se couchèrent de bonne heure, sans avoir même la curiosité d'aller jeter un coup d'œil dans la loge numéro 5, pour savoir si MM. Debienne et Poligny trouvaient le spectacle à leur goût. L'Opéra n'avait point chômé depuis le départ de l'ancienne direction, et M. Richard avait fait procéder aux quelques travaux nécessaires, sans interrompre le cours des représentations.","The whole day was spent in discussions, parleys, signatures or breaches of contracts; so I beg you to believe that that evening—the evening of January 25—our two directors, tired by a harsh day of anger, intrigue, recommendations, threats, protestations of love or hatred, went to bed early, without even having the curiosity to go and have a look in box number 5, to find out if MM.

Richard had had the necessary works carried out without interrupting the course of the performances.","Throughout that day contracts were discussed, negotiated, signed or cancelled; and, that evening – the evening of January 25th – the two directors went to bed early. As you can imagine, after so many exhausting hours of angry exchanges, intrigue, recommendations, threats and professions of love or hatred, they retired without so much as a cursory glance at Box Five to see whether Debienne and Poligny were enjoying the performance. The Opera House had not stood idle since their departure, for although essential work had been carried out on Richard’s orders, it had not interfered with the scheduled performances.","The rest of the day was spent arguing, negotiating, signing or cancelling contracts.

"Il faut que je dise tout mon calcul. Je croyais que le monstre, chassé de sa demeure par la jalousie, me permettrait ainsi de pénétrer sans péril dans la maison du Lac, par le passage du troisième dessous. J'avais tout intérêt, pour tout le monde, à savoir exactement ce qu'il pouvait bien y avoir là dedans! Un jour, fatigué d'attendre une occasion, je fis jouer la pierre et aussitôt j'entendis une musique formidable; le monstre travaillait, toutes portes ouvertes chez lui, à son Don Juan triomphant. Je savais que c'était là l'œuvre de sa vie. Je n'avais garde de bouger et je restai prudemment dans mon trou obscur. Il s'arrêta un moment de jouer et se prit à marcher à travers sa demeure, comme un fou. Et il dit tout haut, d'une voix retentissante: «Il faut que tout cela soit fini avant! Bien fini!» Cette parole n'était pas encore pour me rassurer et, comme la musique reprenait, je fermai la pierre tout doucement. Or, malgré cette pierre fermée, j'entendais encore un vague chant lointain, lointain, qui montait du fond de la terre, comme j'avais entendu le chant de la sirène monter du fond des eaux. Et je me rappelai les paroles de quelques machinistes dont on avait souri au moment de la mort de Joseph Buquet: «Il y avait autour du corps du pendu comme un bruit qui ressemblait au chant des morts.»","I must say all my calculations. I believed that the monster, chased from its dwelling by jealousy, would thus allow me to penetrate without danger into the house of the Lake, by the passage of the third underside. I had every interest, for everyone, to know exactly what could be in there! One day, tired of waiting for an opportunity, I played the stone and immediately I heard wonderful music; the monster worked, all doors open at home, to his triumphant Don Juan. I knew that was his life's work. I was careful not to move and I stayed cautiously in my dark hole. He stopped playing for a moment and began to walk through his house like a madman. And he said aloud, in a resounding voice: “All this must be finished before! Well done!"" These words were not yet to reassure me and, as the music resumed, I closed the stone very gently. Now, in spite of this closed stone, I still heard a vague distant, distant song, which rose from the bottom of the earth, as I had heard the song of the siren rising from the bottom of the waters. And I remembered the words of some machinists who had been laughed at at the time of Joseph Buquet's death: ""There was a noise around the body of the hanged man that resembled the chanting of the dead.""","I had a plan. I thought that jealousy would draw him out of his retreat, thus enabling me to enter it safely from the third mezzanine. It was important, for everyone’s sake, that I should explore the place itself. One day, tired of waiting for an opportunity, I worked the stone and immediately heard the strains of sublime music: Erik was working at his Don Juan triomphant, with the internal doors wide open. I knew that he regarded it as his masterpiece. I stayed within the dark opening and listened, careful not to make the slightest movement. He stopped playing for a moment and began pacing to and fro like a madman. Then I heard him say, his voice resounding: ‘I have to finish it first! Finish it completely!’ This did nothing to reassure me either and, when the music resumed, I gently worked the stone shut again. But I could still hear the faint, distant music rising from the depths of the earth, just as the siren’s voice had risen from the depths of the lake. And I recalled the machinists’ claim, jokingly dismissed at the time, that on finding Joseph Buquet’s hanged body they had heard ‘something that sounded like music for the Dead’.","I must tell you how I read the situation. I reasoned that if the monster was lured out of his lair by jealousy, it would be my chance to get inside safely through the secret passage on the third level down. It was in my and everybody’s interest to know exactly what went on in there! One day, tired of waiting for an opportunity, I pressed the catch and immediately heard sounds of the most amazing music. The monster was working, with all the doors open, on his Don Juan Triumphant. I knew that he regarded it as his magnum opus. I was very careful not to move and stayed quietly where I was, in my dark corner. At one point, he stopped playing and began marching around his lair like someone demented shouting: ‘It’s got to be finished first, every last note of it!’ I did not find his words very reassuring and when the music started up again I carefully closed the stone. But even when it was fully shut, I could still hear faint, distant strains rising from the depth of the earth just as I had heard the song of the Siren rising from the depths of the lake. I remembered what the stagehands had said when Joseph Buquet had died, though it had raised a condescending smile at the time: they’d claimed to have ‘heard a sound like a death march echoing over the corpse’!","I must explain my whole plan. I thought that the monster, being driven from his house by jealousy, would thus enable me to enter it, without danger, through the passage in the third cellar. It was important, for everybody’s sake, that I should know exactly what was inside. One day, tired of waiting for an opportunity, I moved the stone and at once heard an astounding music: the monster was working at his Don Juan Triumphant, with every door in his house wide open. I knew that this was the work of his life. I was careful not to stir and remained prudently in my dark hole. He stopped playing, for a moment, and began walking about his place, like a madman. And he said aloud, at the top of his voice: “It must be finished first! Quite finished!” This speech was not calculated to reassure me and, when the music recommenced, I closed the stone very softly."

"Ils reculèrent encore, mais la figure-flamme avançait, avançait toujours, gagnant sur eux.

"Ils avaient à peu près la même petite âme rêveuse et calme. Ils ne se plaisaient qu'aux histoires, aux vieux contes bretons, et leur principal jeu était d'aller les chercher au seuil des portes, comme des mendiants. «Madame ou mon bon monsieur, avez-vous une petite histoire à nous raconter, s'il vous plaît?» Il était rare qu'on ne leur «donnât» point. Quelle est la vieille grand'mère bretonne qui n'a point vu, au moins une fois dans sa vie danser les korrigans, sur la bruyère, au clair de lune?","They pretty much had the same dreamy, quiet little soul. They only liked stories, old Breton tales, and their main game was to pick them up at doorsteps, like beggars. “Madame or my good sir, do you have a little story to tell us, please?” It was rare that we did not ""give"" them. Who is the old Breton grandmother who has not seen, at least once in her life, the korrigans dance on the heather, in the moonlight?","Both children were calm, imaginative little souls. They delighted in folk tales and old Breton legends, and would often go knocking on doors to beg for stories: ‘Madame,’ or ‘Mon bon monsieur, would you have a story for us?’ they asked. And more often than not, they were given one. Nearly every Breton grandmother has, at least once in her life, seen fairies frolic upon the heath by moonlight.","They both had similar dreamy, placid natures. What they loved best were stories and old Breton legends, and their favourite game was knocking on doors, like beggars, collecting new ones. ‘Sorry to bother you, Monsieur (or Madame), please do you have a story you could tell us?’ It was the exception if they weren’t offered one. Show me the old Breton grandmother who never at least once in her life saw elves and goblins dancing in the heather by moonlight!","They also both had the same calm and dreamy little cast of mind. They delighted in stories, in old Breton legends; and their favourite sport was to go and ask for them at the cottage-doors, like beggars: “Ma’am ...” or, “Kind gentleman ... have you a little story to tell us, please?” And it seldom happened that they did not have one “given” them; for nearly every old Breton grandame has, at least once in her life, seen the “korrigans”f dance by moonlight on the heather."

"En vérité, quand je songe à toutes les petitesses, les vilenies dont Christine Daaé eut à souffrir, à cette époque, de la part de cette Carlotta, je ne puis retenir mon courroux, et il ne m'étonne point que mon indignation se traduise par des aperçus un peu vastes sur l'art en général, et celui du chant en particulier, où les admirateurs de la Carlotta ne trouveront certainement point leur compte.","In truth, when I think of all the pettiness, the villainies which Christine Daaé had to suffer, at that time, from this Carlotta, I cannot restrain my anger, and it does not surprise me that my indignation is translated by somewhat broad insights into the art in general, and that of singing in particular, where admirers of La Carlotta will certainly not find what they are looking for.","In truth, when I consider all the pettiness and wickedness that Christine Daaé suffered at Carlotta’s hands during that time, I can barely contain my anger. It is no wonder that my indignation should be expressed in rather sweeping statements about art in general – and the art of singing in particular – which Carlotta’s admirers are bound to find unwarranted.","Truly, when I think of all the petty vexations and spitefulness Christine Daaé had to put up with from Carlotta at that time, I can barely contain my anger. No wonder I express my feelings as sweeping generalizations about art in general, and the art of singing in particular, which will certainly not please Carlotta’s many admirers.","Lastly, in the theatre itself, the celebrated, but heartless and soulless diva made the most scandalous remarks about Christine and tried to cause her endless minor unpleasantnesses."

"Or, ils aperçurent encore la tête en feu derrière leurs deux têtes. Elle les avait suivis...

And she must have run too and perhaps faster than them, because it seemed to them that she had come closer.","The head of fire was right behind them. It had followed.

"Raoul monta le grand escalier à minuit, moins cinq, ne s'attarda en aucune sorte à considérer autour de lui le spectacle des costumes multicolores s'étalant au long des degrés de marbre, dans l'un des plus somptueux décors du monde, ne se laissa entreprendre par aucun masque facétieux, ne répondit à aucune plaisanterie, et secoua la familiarité entreprenante de plusieurs couples déjà trop gais. Ayant traversé le grand foyer et échappé à une farandole qui, un moment, l'avait emprisonné, il pénétra enfin dans le salon que le billet de Christine lui avait indiqué. Là, dans ce petit espace, il y avait un monde fou; car c'était là le carrefour où se rencontraient tous ceux qui allaient souper à la Rotonde ou qui revenaient de prendre une coupe de champagne.

Raoul pensa que Christine avait, pour leur mystérieux rendez-vous, préféré cette cohue à quelque coin isolé: on y était, sous le masque, plus dissimulé.","Raoul went up the grand staircase at five minutes to midnight, in no way lingered to consider around him the spectacle of multicolored costumes spread out along the marble steps, in one of the most sumptuous settings in the world, allowed himself to be taken in by any facetious mask, answered no joke, and shook off the enterprising familiarity of several couples who were already too gay. Having crossed the large foyer and escaped a farandole which, for a moment, had imprisoned him, he finally entered the drawing-room that Christine's note had shown him. There, in this small space, there was a crazy world; for that was the crossroads where all those who went to supper at the Rotonde or who came back from a glass of champagne met. The tumult there was ardent and joyful. Raoul thought that Christine had, for their mysterious rendezvous, preferred this crowd to some isolated corner: we were there, under the mask, more concealed.","Raoul climbed the grand staircase at five minutes to midnight. He did not linger to admire the many-coloured costumes on display all the way up the marble steps of one of the most luxurious settings in the world; nor did he allow himself to be drawn into the facetious conversation of masked guests.

Crossing the big crush-room and escaping from the dancers’ farandole that had encircled him awhile, he at last entered the salon mentioned by Christine in her letter. The small room was crammed with people either on their way to supper at the restaurant in the Rotunda or back from raising a glass of champagne. In the midst of the gay and lively hubbub, Raoul thought that, for their mysterious assignation, Christine must have preferred this crowd to some lonely corner.","At five minutes to twelve, Raoul walked up the great staircase. He did not pause to survey the many multicoloured costumes that filled the length of the marble steps of one of the most sumptuous settings anywhere in the world. He did not allow himself to be detained by frivolous masks, did not respond to their antics and shrugged off the unashamed familiarities of several couples who were already shameless enough. After crossing the main lobby and avoiding a farandole which for one moment had trapped him, he finally reached the room specified in Christine’s note. It was small but was crammed with people, for it was where those on their way to have supper at the Rotonde met those who were on their way back after drinking a glass of champagne. The crowd was noisy and happy. Raoul thought that Christine had deliberately chosen this milling throng for their mysterious rendezvous rather than some quiet corner, for here, with a mask, they would be anonymous in the crowd.","Raoul climbed the grand staircase at five minutes to twelve, did not linger to look at the motley dresses displayed all the way up the marble steps, one of the richest settings in the world, allowed no facetious mask to draw him into a war of wits, replied to no jests and shook off the bold familiarity of a number of couples who had already become a trifle too gay. Crossing the crush-room and escaping from a mad whirl of dancers in which he was caught for a moment, he at last entered the room mentioned in Christine’s letter. He found it crammed; for this small space was the point where all those who were going to supper in the Rotunda crossed those who were returning from taking a glass of champagne. The fun, here, waxed fast and furious. Raoul leaned against a door-post and waited."

Elle ne pouvait s'expliquer ce phénomène, qui n'était point nouveau pour elle, que par l'intervention du fantôme. Ce fantôme, personne ne le voyait dans la loge, mais tout le monde pouvait l'entendre. Elle l'avait entendu souvent, elle, et on pouvait l'en croire, car elle ne mentait jamais.

Isidore Saack, whose leg the ghost had broken!","At this, realizing that Richard was about to erupt, Moncharmin intervened and took charge of the questioning. Thus, he learned that the attendant found it quite natural that one should hear a voice claiming that a box was occupied when there was clearly nobody there.

"Il a une voix d'homme, oh! une douce voix d'homme! Voilà comment ça se passe: Quand il vient à l'Opéra, il arrive d'ordinaire vers le milieu du premier acte, il frappe trois petits coups secs à la porte de la loge n° 5. La première fois que j'ai entendu ces trois coups-là, alors que je savais très bien qu'il n'y avait encore personne dans la loge, vous pensez si j'ai été intriguée! J'ouvre la porte, j'écoute, je regarde: personne! et puis voilà-t-il pas que j'entends une voix qui me dit: «Mame Jules» (c'est le nom de défunt mon mari), un petit «banc, s.v.p.?» Sauf vot'respect, m'sieur le directeur, j'en étais comme une tomate...

La voix, m'sieur le directeur, était assise sur le premier fauteuil du premier rang, à droite.

"Je suis sûr, bien sûr, d'avoir prié sur son cadavre, l'autre jour quand on l'a sorti de la terre, à l'endroit même où l'on enterrait les voix vivantes; c'était son squelette. Ce n'est point à la laideur de la tête que je l'ai reconnu, car lorsqu'ils sont morts depuis si longtemps, tous les hommes sont laids, mais à l'anneau d'or qu'il portait et que Christine Daaé était certainement venue lui glisser au doigt, avant de l'ensevelir, comme elle le lui avait promis.","I'm sure, of course, that I prayed over his corpse the other day when they took him out of the ground, in the very place where they buried the living voices; it was his skeleton. It was not by the ugliness of his head that I recognized him, because when they have been dead for so long, all men are ugly, but by the gold ring he wore and which Christine Daaé had certainly slipped on his finger, before burying him, as she had promised him.","Yes, I am quite sure those were his mortal remains that they exhumed from the spot where recordings of singers’ voices were to be buried for posterity.

It was his skeleton. It wasn’t the ugliness of the skull that told me it was him, for when people have been dead for as long as that, they’re all ugly. It was the plain gold ring he was wearing. Christine Daaé must have slipped it on his finger when, as promised, she had come to put him in his last resting place.","Yes, I am quite sure that I prayed beside his body, the other day, when they took it from the spot where they were burying the phonographic records.

"Raoul commençait à tenir cette sorte de propos bizarres qui répondaient si intimement et si logiquement aux préoccupations de son esprit et qui faisaient si bien suite aux confidences étranges, à la fois réelles et d'apparences surnaturelles, de Christine Daaé; et ces propos ne contribuèrent point peu à persuader à beaucoup que le cerveau du jeune homme était dérangé. Le comte lui-même y fut pris et plus tard le juge d'instruction, sur le rapport du commissaire de police, n'eut point de peine à conclure.","Raoul began to make this kind of bizarre remarks which responded so intimately and so logically to the preoccupations of his mind and which followed so well the strange confidences, both real and supernatural in appearance, of Christine Daaé; and these remarks contributed not a little to persuade many that the young man's brain was deranged. The count himself was caught there and later the examining magistrate, on the report of the commissioner of police, had no difficulty in coming to a conclusion.","Raoul continued with remarks such as these, which related directly and inextricably to his own concerns and naturally sprang from Christine Daaé’s revelations, whether real or fantastic. These apparent ramblings contributed in no small measure to the impression that the young man had lost his mind. The Count himself was convinced of it and later the examining magistrate, having read Inspector Mifroid ’s report, came to the same conclusion.","Raoul then began saying bizarre things of this kind which may have been closely and logically connected with what was in his mind and followed on naturally from the strange (but either real or seemingly supernatural) tale which Christine Daaé had told him, but they only encouraged people to think that he had become unhinged. Even the Count thought so and later the examining magistrate, after reading the police inspector’s report, was left in no doubt.","Raoul went on making this strange sort of remarks which corresponded so intimately and logically with the preoccupation of his brain and which, at the same time, tended to persuade many people that his mind was unhinged.

"Si je n'ai pu retrouver la demeure du Lac, Erik en ayant définitivement condamné toutes les entrées secrètes (et encore je suis sûr qu'il serait facile d'y pénétrer si l'on procédait au dessèchement du Lac, comme je l'ai plusieurs fois demandé à l'administration des beaux-arts)[12], je n'en ai pas moins découvert le couloir secret des communards, dont la paroi de planches tombe par endroits en ruines; et, de même, j'ai mis à jour la trappe par laquelle le Persan et Raoul descendirent dans les dessous du théâtre. J'ai relevé, dans le cachot des communards, beaucoup d'initiales tracées sur les murs par les malheureux qui furent enfermés là et, parmi ces initiales, un R et un C.—R C? Ceci n'est-il point significatif? Raoul de Chagny! Les lettres sont encore aujourd'hui très visibles. Je ne me suis pas, bien entendu, arrêté là. Dans le premier et le troisième dessous, j'ai fait jouer deux frappes d'un système pivotant, tout à fait inconnues aux machinistes, qui n'usent que de trappes à glissade horizontale.","If I have not been able to find the residence of the Lake, Erik having definitively closed all the secret entrances (and even then I am sure that it would be easy to penetrate there if the Lake was dried up, as I have I have several times asked the administration of the fine arts)[12], I nevertheless discovered the secret corridor of the Communards, whose wall of boards is falling in places in ruins; and, likewise, I brought to light the trap door through which the Persian and Raoul descended into the lower part of the theatre. I noted, in the dungeon of the communards, many initials traced on the walls by the unfortunates who were locked up there and, among these initials, an R and a C.—R C? Is this not significant? Raoul de Chagny! The letters are still very visible today. Of course, I did not stop there. In the first and third undersides, I played two strokes of a pivoting system, completely unknown to machinists, who only use trapdoors with horizontal sliding.","To my dismay, I have been unable to find a way into the lake-side retreat, Erik having closed off all the secret entrances to it; but I remain convinced that one could reach it if only the lake were drained, an undertaking I have repeatedly requested of the Ministry of Fine Arts. * Nevertheless, I have successfully entered the Communards’ secret passage, whose wooden side wall has now rotted in places; and I have located the trap through which Raoul and the Persian gained access to the mezzanines below stage. In the Communards’ dungeon, I noticed many initials etched on the walls by the poor wretches who must have been imprisoned there; among these were an ‘R’ and a ‘C’. Is that not significant? Perhaps ‘R C’ for ‘Raoul de Chagny’! And these initials are still perfectly legible today. Of course, I did not stop at that. I went down to the first and third mezzanines and discovered two traps with pivoting doors unknown to the machinists of the Opera House, who only use traps with horizontally sliding doors.","I have not, however, succeeded in locating the house by the lake. As a final act, Erik had destroyed all the secret entrances to it. But I remain convinced that it would be easy to reach it if the lake were drained, as I have several times proposed to the Ministry of Fine Arts.1 But at least I was able to find the Communards’ tunnel, though the planking has rotted in places, and also the trapdoor through which Raoul and the Persian dropped down into the lower levels of the theatre. In the cell dug by the Communards, I found initials scratched on the walls by those who were held there, and among them an ‘R’ and a ‘C’: ‘RC’? Surely this is significant: Raoul de Chagny! At the time of writing, the letters are still clearly visible. Of course, I did not stop there. In the first and third levels down, I managed to open two pivot-operated doors unknown to the stagehands who are familiar only with horizontal, sliding traps.","I have not been able to find the house on the lake, Erik’s having blocked up all the secret entrances.ac On the other hand, I have discovered the secret passage of the Communists, the planking of which is falling to pieces in parts, and also the trap-door through which Raoul and the Persian penetrated into the cellars of the opera-house. In the Communists’ dungeon, I noticed numbers of initials traced on the walls by the unfortunate people confined in it; and among these were an “R” and a “C.” R. C.: Raoul de Chagny. The letters are there to this day. If the reader will visit the Opera one morning and ask leave to stroll where he pleases, without being accompanied by a stupid guide, let him go to Box Five and knock with his fist or stick on the enormous column that separates this from the stage-box."

"—... Et si Gabriel est superstitieux! continua Jammes, cependant il est toujours poli et quand il voit le Persan, il se contente de mettre tranquillement sa main dans sa poche et de toucher ses clefs... Eh bien! aussitôt que la porte s'est ouverte devant le Persan, Gabriel ne fit qu'un bond du fauteuil où il était assis jusqu'à la serrure de l'armoire, pour toucher du fer! Dans ce mouvement, il déchira à un clou tout un pan de son paletot. En se pressant pour sortir, il alla donner du front contre une patère et se fit une bosse énorme; puis, en reculant brusquement, il s'écorcha le bras au paravent, près du piano; il voulut s'appuyer au piano, mais si malheureusement que le couvercle lui retomba sur les mains et lui écrasa les doigts; il bondit comme un fou hors du bureau et enfin prit si mal son temps en descendant l'escalier qu'il dégringola sur les reins toutes les marches du premier étage. Je passais justement à ce moment-là avec maman. Nous nous sommes précipitées pour le relever. Il était tout meurtri et avait du sang plein la figure, que ça nous en faisait peur. Mais tout de suite il s'est mis à nous sourire et à s'écrier: «Merci, mon Dieu! d'en être quitte pour si peu!» Alors, nous l'avons interrogé et il nous a raconté toute sa peur. Elle lui était venue de ce qu'il avait aperçu, derrière le Persan, le fantôme! le fantôme avec la tête de mort, comme l'a décrit Joseph Buquet.","""...And if Gabriel is superstitious!"" continued Jammes, however he is always polite and when he sees the Persian, he is content to quietly put his hand in his pocket and touch his keys. Well! as soon as the door opened in front of the Persian, Gabriel only jumped from the armchair in which he was seated to the lock of the cupboard, to touch iron! In this movement, he tore with a nail a whole section of his overcoat. As he hurried out, he thrust his forehead against a peg and made an enormous bump; then, stepping back abruptly, he scratched his arm on the screen, near the piano; he wanted to lean on the piano, but so unfortunately that the lid fell on his hands and crushed his fingers; he jumped like a madman out of the office and finally took his time so badly going down the stairs that he fell on his back all the steps of the first floor. I was just passing by at that time with mom. We rushed to pick him up. He was all bruised and had blood all over his face, it scared us. But immediately he began to smile at us and exclaim: “Thank you, my God! to be quit for so little!” So we interviewed him and he told us all about his fear. It had come to him from what he had seen, behind the Persian, the phantom! the ghost with the skull, as described by Joseph Buquet.","‘And you know too how superstitious Gabriel is,’ Little Jammes continued. ‘All the same, he’s never rude. When he meets the Persian, he gently slips his hand into his pocket and fingers his keys.12 Well, the moment the Persian appeared in the doorway, Gabriel leaped from his chair and reached out for the cupboard lock, so as to touch metal! In so doing, he ripped the tail of his jacket on a nail. Rushing out of the room, he bumped his forehead against a coat rack and, recoiling, grazed his arm on the screen by the piano; he leaned forward on to the piano to try and steady himself, but the lid fell and caught his fingers; then, he ran out of his room like a madman, tripped at the top of the first flight of stairs and tumbled down to the bottom. I was just passing by with Mother. We helped him up. He was badly bruised, with blood all over his face. What a frightful sight! Yet he grinned at us and sighed: “ Thank God, I escaped so lightly.” And as we pressed him to explain himself, he told us of his terror at seeing the ghost appear behind the Persian – the ghost with his skull head just as Joseph Buquet has described him.’","‘Gabriel’s ever so superstitious!’ Jammes went on, ‘but he’s always very polite. Whenever he sees the Persian he usually just puts one hand quietly in his pocket and touches his keys for luck… Well, the minute the door opened and he saw the Persian, Gabriel leaped out of his chair and had his hand on the lock of the cupboard like a shot, touching iron! In the process, he caught his coat on a nail and made a great big tear in it. He was so anxious to get out of there, that he bumped his forehead on a coat stand which left an almighty lump; and then, stepping back quickly, he brushed one arm against the screen next to the piano; he tried to steady himself by leaning on the piano but unfortunately the lid fell on his hands and trapped his fingers; he rushed out of the office like a lunatic and was in such a hurry to get away from the first floor that he tumbled all the way down the stairs and ended up on his back. I happened to be passing just then with my mother. We rushed to help him to his feet. He was black and blue and there was blood all over his face. It gave us an awful fright. But all at once he smiled at us and started shouting: “Thank you, God! for letting me off so lightly!” Then we asked him what was the matter and he told us all about being frightened. Do you know why? He’d seen the ghost! It had been standing just behind the Persian! The ghost with the death’s head, just the way Joseph Buquet had described him.’","“And you know how superstitious Gabriel is,” continued Jammes. “However, he is always polite. When he meets the Persian, he just puts his hand in his pocket and touches his keys. Well, the moment the Persian appeared in the doorway, Gabriel gave one jump from his chair to lock the cupboard, so as to touch iron! In doing so, he tore a whole skirt of his overcoat on a nail. Hurrying to get out of the room, he banged his forehead against a hat-peg and gave himself a huge bump; then, suddenly stepping back, he skinned his arm on the screen, near the piano; he tried to lean on the piano, but the lid fell on his hands and crushed his fingers; he rushed out of the office like a madman, slipped on the staircase and came down the whole of the first flight on his back. I was just passing with mother. We picked him up. He was covered with bruises and his face was all over blood. We were frightened out of our lives, but, all at once, he began to thank Providence that he had got off so cheaply. Then he told us what had frightened him. He had seen the ghost behind the Persian, the ghost with the death’s head, just like Joseph Buquet’s description!”"
"La main haute, prête à tirer! répéta hâtivement le compagnon de Raoul. Derrière eux, le mur, continuant à faire un tour complet sur lui-même, s'était refermé.","Hands high, ready to fire! hastily repeated Raoul's companion. Behind them, the wall, continuing to make a full turn on itself, had closed.","‘Keep your hand raised, ready to fire!’ Raoul’s companion repeated hurriedly. Having completed its rotation, the wall closed behind them.","‘KEEP your hand up, ready to shoot!’ Raoul’s companion said again. Behind them, the wall completed one full turn on its axis then closed softly behind them.","Your hand high, ready to fire!” repeated Raoul’s companion quickly. The wall, behind them, having completed the circle which it described upon itself, closed again; and the two men stood motionless for a moment, holding their breath."

Poligny était ce que l'on est convenu d'appeler un viveur).","These proofs, it was up to me to complete them, with the help of the daroga himself. I kept him up to date with my research and he guided it. For years and years he had not returned to the Opera, but he had preserved the most precise memory of the monument and he was no better guide to show me its most hidden corners. It was he again who showed me the sources from which I could draw, the characters to question; it was he who urged me to knock on M. Poligny's door, when the poor man was almost in agony. I did not know it so low and I will never forget the effect my questions about the ghost had on him. He looked at me as if he saw the devil and answered me only with a few sentences without sequence, but which attested (this was the main thing) how much F. de l'O. had, in his time, thrown the disturbance in this already very agitated life (M. Poligny was what one is agreed to call a viveur).","Since receiving the papers and relics promised by the Phantom, he was now in possession of the main evidence, and it fell to me to tie up the loose ends with his assistance. I kept him informed of my progress day by day and acted upon his suggestions. He had not returned to the Opera for many years, but his recollections of the building were so accurate that I could not have hoped for a better guide to its hidden recesses. He told me where I could gather further information and whom I should question. It was at his insistence that I called on M. Poligny, who was now close to death. I did not know beforehand that he was so gravely ill, and I shall never forget the effect that my questions about the Phantom had upon him. He looked at me as if I were Satan incarnate and answered with only a few brief, disconnected phrases. These confirmed – significantly – that, in his time, P. of the O. had brought disarray to Poligny’s life, which was already full of intrigues as he was something of a rake.","It fell to me to fill in the remaining gaps, which I did with his help. I kept him informed daily about the progress of my enquiries and he pointed me in the right direction. He had not been back to the Opera for many years, but his memories of the place were extremely accurate. I could not have had a better guide to assist me in exploring its remotest corners. He also told me the best places to get at the facts and the best people to interview. He it was who urged me to knock on the door of M. Poligny when the poor man was more or less on his deathbed. I had no idea he was so ill and I shall never forget the effect my questions about the Phantom had on him. He stared at me as if I were the devil incarnate and gave me a few disjointed answers which nevertheless confirmed (and that was what really mattered) the tremendous impact which the P. of the O. had made at the time on his somewhat irregular private life (he was what is usually called a rake).","It fell to my lot to complete those proofs with the aid of the daroga himself. Day by day, I kept him informed of the progress of my inquiries; and he directed them. He had not been to the Opera for years and years, but he had preserved the most accurate recollection of the building, and there was no better guide than he possible to help me discover its most secret recesses. He also told me where to gather further information, whom to ask; and he sent me to call on M. Poligny, at a moment when the poor man was nearly drawing his last breath. I had no idea that he was so very ill, and I shall never forget the effect which my questions about the ghost produced upon him. He looked at me as if I were the devil and answered only in a few incoherent sentences, which showed, however—and that was the main thing-the extent of the perturbation which O. G., in his time, had brought into that already very restless life (for M. Poligny was what people called a man of pleasure)."
"Armand Moncharmin a écrit de si volumineux mémoires qu'en ce qui concerne particulièrement la période assez longue de sa co-direction, on est en droit de se demander s'il trouva jamais le temps de s'occuper de l'Opéra autrement qu'en racontant ce qui s'y passait. M. Moncharmin ne connaissait pas une note de musique, mais il tutoyait le ministre de l'Instruction publique et des Beaux-Arts, avait fait un peu de journalisme sur le boulevard et jouissait d'une assez grosse fortune. Enfin, c'était un charmant garçon et qui ne manquait point d'intelligence puisque, décidé à commanditer l'Opéra, il avait su choisir celui qui en serait l'utile directeur et était allé tout droit à Firmin Richard.","Armand Moncharmin wrote such voluminous memoirs that, particularly with regard to the rather long period of his co-direction, one is entitled to wonder if he ever found the time to occupy himself with the Opera other than telling what happened there.

Moncharmin did not know a note of music, but he was familiar with the Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts, had done a little journalism on the boulevard and enjoyed a rather large fortune. Finally, he was a charming young man who was not lacking in intelligence since, having decided to sponsor the Opera, he had known how to choose who would be its useful director and had gone straight to Firmin Richard.","Armand Moncharmin wrote such voluminous Memoirs that we may well ask whether, during his years as co-director of the Paris Opera House, he ever found the time to discharge his duties other than by keeping a chronicle of events there. He had no knowledge of music; but he was on friendly terms with the Minister for Public Education and Fine Arts, had tried his hand as a theatre critic and enjoyed the advantages of a substantial private income. He was a charming fellow who, having decided to delegate some of his responsibilities at the Opera House, demonstrated a good deal of intelligence by choosing Firmin Richard as the most capable man to act as co-director.","ARMAND MONCHARMIN wrote such voluminous memoirs that we are perfectly entitled to ask how, especially during his lengthy term as co-Director of the Opera, he ever found time to do anything towards running the place beyond setting down everything that went on there. He knew nothing about music, but he was on first-name terms with the Minister of Education and Arts, had been a society journalist and enjoyed a large private income. Still, he was a very engaging man and not unintelligent because, having made up his mind to take the reins of the Opera, he knew exactly who he wanted to do the donkey work. Which was why he went straight to Firmin Richard…","Armand Moncharmin wrote such voluminous Memoirs during the fairly long period of his co-management that we may well ask if he ever found time to attend to the affairs of the Opera otherwise than by telling what went on there. M. Moncharmin did not know a note of music, but he called the minister of education and fine arts by his Christian name, had dabbled a little in society journalism and enjoyed a considerable private income. Lastly, he was a charming fellow and showed that he was not lacking in intelligence, for, as soon as he made up his mind to be a sleeping partner in the Opera, he selected the best possible active manager and went straight to Firmin Richard."

Il se frappait le front d'un index désolé pour faire comprendre aux directeurs que la mère Jules était bien certainement folle, pantomime qui engagea définitivement M. Richard à se séparer d'un inspecteur qui gardait dans son service une hallucinée. La bonne femme continuait, toute à son fantôme, vantant maintenant sa générosité.","Eh?

Moncharmin and Richard went up to the inspector, who, behind the usher, waved his arms with the intention of attracting the attention of his superiors.

The eyes of the two directors went from Mme Giry up to the house manager standing behind her and waving his arms to draw their attention.

From Mme Giry the twin gaze of Messrs Moncharmin and Richard rose until it stopped at the security officer who was standing behind her and waving his arms trying to catch his employers’ attention.

"«À propos de F. de l'O. (c'est M. Moncharmin qui parle), dont j'ai narré ici même, au commencement de mes Mémoires, quelques-unes des singulières fantaisies, je ne veux plus dire qu'une chose, c'est qu'il racheta par un beau geste tous les tracas qu'il avait causés à mon cher collaborateur et, je dois bien l'avouer, à moi-même. Il jugea sans doute qu'il y avait des limites à toute plaisanterie, surtout quand elle coûte aussi cher et quand le commissaire de police est «saisi», car, à la minute même où nous avions donné rendez-vous dans notre cabinet à M. Mifroid pour lui conter toute l'histoire, quelques jours après la disparition de Christine Daaé, nous trouvâmes sur le bureau de Richard, dans une belle enveloppe sur laquelle on lisait à l'encre rouge: De la part de F. de l'O., les sommes assez importantes qu'il avait réussi à faire sortir momentanément, et dans une manière de jeu, de la caisse directoriale. Richard fut aussitôt d'avis qu'on devait s'en tenir là et ne point pousser l'affaire. Je consentis à être de l'avis de Richard. Et tout est bien qui finit bien. N'est-ce pas, mon cher F. de l'O.?»","""About F. de l'O. (it is M. Moncharmin who speaks), of which I have narrated here, at the beginning of my Memoirs, some of the singular fantasies, I do not want to say more than one thing, it is that he redeemed by a nice gesture all the hassle he had caused to my dear collaborator and, I must admit, to myself. He doubtless judged that there were limits to any joke, especially when it costs so much and when the commissioner of police is ""seized"", because, the very minute we had made an appointment in our office with M. Mifroid to tell him the whole story, a few days after Christine Daaé's disappearance, we found on Richard's desk, in a beautiful envelope on which we read in red ink: From F. de l' O., the rather large sums which he had managed to extricate momentarily, and in a manner of play, from the managerial cash box. Richard was immediately of the opinion that we should stop there and not push the matter. I consented to agree with Richard. And all's well that ends well. Isn't it, my dear F. from the O.?""","As for P. of the O., some of whose vagaries have been described at the beginning of these Memoirs, I will only say that, with one fine gesture, he redeemed all the worry and embarrassment he had caused my dear friend and partner, and indeed myself. He must have felt that, with such considerable sums of money at stake, the practical joke had gone too far, particularly now the police had been informed. For no sooner had we arranged to meet Inspector Mifroid in our office to tell him the whole story – this was a few days after the final disappearance of Christine Daaé – than we found on Richard’s table a large envelope inscribed ‘With the compliments of P. of the O.’ in red ink. It contained all the money that he had, for his own amusement, successfully extorted from the directorial purse. Richard at once suggested that we should be content with this outcome and drop the matter altogether. I agreed with him. All’s well that ends well, P. of the O.!","‘With regard to the P. of the O.,’ wrote Moncharmin, ‘certain of whose fanciful exploits I recalled at the beginning of these Memoirs, I have only one thing to add and it is this. With one fine gesture, he redeemed all the trouble he caused my friend and co-Director and, I cannot deny it, myself. I assume that he eventually realized that a joke can be carried too far, especially when it involves large amounts of cash and a high-ranking police officer. A few days after the disappearance of Christine Daaé, at the very time which we had arranged to meet M. Mifroid in our office and were about to tell him the whole story, there on Richard’s desk we found a large envelope. On the outside the following words had been written in red ink: “With the compliments of the P. of the O.” Inside it were the very substantial sums which he had temporarily and amusingly managed to extract from the Directors’ strongbox. Richard immediately took the view that matters should be left there and no further action taken. I agreed to endorse Richard’s point of view. All’s well that ends well —don’t you agree, you mischievous P. of the O.?’","“As for O.G., some of whose curious tricks I have related in the first part of my Memoirs, I will only say that he redeemed by one spontaneous fine action all the worry which he had caused my dear friend and partner and, I am bound to say, myself.

Mifroid to tell him the whole story, a few days after the disappearance of Christine Daaé, we found, on Richard’s table, a large envelope, inscribed, in red ink, ‘With 0. G. ’s compliments.’ It contained the large sum of money which he had succeeded in playfully extracting, for the time being, from the treasury.

"Toutefois, je me résolus à agir sans plus tarder, personnellement. Le moment me semblait, du reste, propice. J'avais beaucoup de chances pour qu'Erik ne songeât, à cette heure, qu'à sa captive. Il fallait en profiter pour pénétrer dans sa demeure par le troisième dessous et je pensai, pour cette entreprise, à m'adjoindre ce pauvre petit désespéré de vicomte, qui, au premier mot, accepta avec une confiance en moi qui me toucha profondément; j'avais envoyé chercher mes pistolets par mon domestique. Darius nous rejoignit avec la boîte dans la loge de Christine. Je donnai un pistolet au vicomte et lui conseillai d'être prêt à tirer comme moi-même, car, après tout, Erik pouvait nous attendre derrière le mur. Nous devions passer par le chemin des communards et par la trappe.","However, I resolved to act without delay, personally. The moment seemed to me, moreover, propitious. I had a good chance that Erik was thinking, at this hour, only of his captive. It was necessary to take advantage of this to penetrate into his residence from below, and I thought, for this enterprise, of joining this poor little despairing Viscount, who, at the first word, accepted with a confidence in me which touched me deeply; I had sent for my pistols by my servant. Darius joined us with the box in Christine's dressing room. I gave the viscount a pistol and advised him to be ready to shoot like me, for after all Erik could wait for us behind the wall. We had to go through the path of the communards and through the trap door.","So I decided to act independently without delay. The moment seemed propitious for Erik was probably preoccupied with his captive, leaving me with the advantage. Now was the time to enter his retreat by stealth from the third mezzanine. Needing assistance in this undertaking, I approached the poor desperate Viscount, who agreed on the spot with a show of trust that deeply touched me. I had sent Darius, my servant, for the pistols; and when he joined us in the singer’s dressing-room, I gave one to the Viscount, advising him to hold himself, as I myself did, ready to fire. After all, Erik might be waiting for us behind the wall. We were to go along the Communards’ passage and then through the trap into the mezzanines.","Even so I decided I would have to do something myself, and without further delay. The time seemed right. I could reasonably assume that Erik would not be thinking about anything except his prisoner. I had to make the most of my opportunity to get into his house via the third level and I decided it would be useful to have young de Chagny, who was so desperate, come along with me. He agreed like a shot and showed a faith in me that I found very heartening. I had sent my servant to fetch my pistols. Darius brought the case to Christine’s dressing room. I gave one pistol to the Viscount and told him to be ready to use it, as I was, for Erik might be waiting for us behind the wall. We would travel down the Communards’ tunnel and then drop down onto the third level through the trap in the floor.","On the other hand, I resolved to act without further delay, as far as I was concerned. The chances were in my favour that Erik, at that moment, was thinking only of his captive. This was the moment to enter his house through the third cellar; and I resolved to take with me that poor little desperate viscount, who, at the first suggestion, accepted, with an amount of confidence in myself that touched me profoundly. I had sent my servant for my pistols. I gave one to the viscount and advised him to hold himself ready to fire, for, after all, Erik might be waiting for us behind the wall. We were to go by the Communists’ road and through the trap-door."

During my visit, I had noticed that there was no mirror anywhere to be seen; I was going to remark upon this, but Erik was already seated at the piano.","‘With that, we returned to the drawing room which we’d left a few moments before. It was then I realized that there were no mirrors anywhere in these rooms. I was about to comment on this when Erik sat down at the piano and said:","Thereupon we returned to the drawing-room. I noticed that there was no mirror in the whole apartment. I was going to remark upon this, but Erik had already sat down to the piano. He said, ‘You see, Christine, there is some music that is so terrible that it consumes all those who approach it."

"Raoul s'enfonçait les ongles dans les lèvres pour ne pas hurler: «Christine! C'est moi!... Réponds-moi si tu n'es pas morte, Christine?»","Raoul dug his nails into his lips so as not to scream: “Christine! It's me!...

"Elle ne souriait plus, elle ne plaisantait plus, Elle paraissait songer à une chose nouvelle qui lui entrait pour la première fois dans l'esprit. Son regard en était illuminé.","She was no longer smiling, she was no longer joking. She seemed to be thinking of a new thing which entered her mind for the first time. His gaze was lit up.","She spoke without smiling, no longer in jest. A new idea seemed to have occurred to her and her eyes brightened at the thought.","She stopped smiling, no longer playful.

She seemed to be thinking of some new thing that had entered her mind for the first time. Her eyes were all aglow with it.

"Il n'y avait plus qu'une issue possible, celle qui ouvrait sur la chambre Louis-Philippe, et dans laquelle se trouvaient Erik et Christine Daaé.

"Cependant, plus que ce bruit, l'absence de tout autre bruit était pour Raoul un affreux sujet d'angoisse.

Great gods! would they arrive too late?...","But even more unnerving was the absence of any other sound. How could that be?

"Il y avait une fois, dans un petit bourg, aux environs d'Upsal, un paysan qui vivait là, avec sa famille, cultivant la terre pendant la semaine et chantant au lutrin, le dimanche. Ce paysan avait une petite fille à laquelle, bien avant qu'elle sût lire, il apprit à déchiffrer l'alphabet musical. Le père de Daaé, était, sans qu'il s'en doutât peut-être, un grand musicien. Il jouait du violon et était considéré comme le meilleur ménétrier de toute la Scandinavie. Sa réputation s'étendait à la ronde et on s'adressait toujours à lui pour faire danser les couples dans les noces et les festins. La mère Daaé, impotente, mourut alors que Christine entrait dans sa sixième année. Aussitôt le père, qui n'aimait que sa fille et sa musique, vendit son lopin de terre et s'en fut chercher la gloire à Upsal. Il n'y trouva que la misère.","Once upon a time, in a small town near Uppsala, there was a peasant who lived there with his family, cultivating the land during the week and singing at the lectern on Sundays. This peasant had a little girl to whom, long before she knew how to read, he learned to decipher the musical alphabet. Daaé's father was, perhaps without his suspecting it, a great musician. He played the violin and was considered the finest fiddler in all of Scandinavia. His reputation spread all around and he was always called upon to make couples dance at weddings and feasts. Mother Daaé, helpless, died when Christine entered her sixth year. Immediately the father, who only loved his daughter and her music, sold his piece of land and went to seek glory in Uppsala. He found only misery there.","Once upon a time, there lived a peasant farmer with his family in a small market town near Uppsala. He tilled his land on weekdays and sang bass in the choir on Sundays. He taught his little girl to read music even before she knew her alphabet. Perhaps unbeknown to him, Christine Daaé’s father was a great musician. He played the violin and was regarded as the best fiddler in all Scandinavia. His reputation spread far and wide and he was often invited to set the couples spinning at weddings and other celebrations. His wife, an invalid, died as Christine reached her sixth year. Soon afterwards her father, who loved only his daughter and music, sold his smallholding and went to Uppsala in search of fame and fortune. Sadly, he only met with failure.","Once upon a time, in a small town not far from Uppsala, a peasant lived with his family, tilling the land during the week and singing bass in the church choir on Sundays.

Daaé, though he may not have known it, was a great musician. * He played the violin and was regarded as the finest fiddler in the whole of Scandinavia. His reputation had spread far and wide and it was always to him that people turned for someone to get the couples dancing at weddings and other festive occasions. Mme Daaé was not strong and died when Christine had just turned five. The father, who only loved his daughter and music, sold his field and set off to find fame and fortune at Uppsala. All he found was grinding poverty.","There was once, in a little market-town not far from Upsala, e a peasant who lived there with his family, digging the earth during the week and singing in the choir on Sundays.

"Je ne doutai donc point que je me trouvais aux prises avec une nouvelle invention d'Erik, mais encore une fois cette invention était si parfaite que, en me penchant au-dessus de la petite barque, j'étais moins poussé par le désir d'en découvrir la supercherie que de jouir de son charme.","I therefore had no doubt that I found myself struggling with a new invention of Erik's, but once again this invention was so perfect that, leaning over the little boat, I was less driven by the desire to only to discover its trickery than to enjoy its charm.","I had no doubt that the voice on the lake was yet another one of Erik’s inventions. But it was so perfect that, as I leaned out of the boat, I was driven by a desire not so much to discover the trick as to savour its charm.",I had no doubt that I was being tested by one of Erik’s new inventions. But I repeat: the illusion was so perfect that as I leaned over the side of my small boat I was less intent on my wish to discover how I was being fooled than on my urge to surrender to its charm.,"But this invention was so perfect that, as I leaned out of the boat, I was impelled less by a desire to discover its trick than to enjoy its charm; and I leaned out, leaned out until I almost overturned the boat."

"—... Oh! daroga, j'ai senti ses larmes couler sur mon front à moi! à moi! à moi! Elles étaient chaudes... elles étaient douces! elles allaient partout sous mon masque, ses larmes! elles allaient se mêler à mes larmes dans mes yeux!... elles coulaient jusque dans ma bouche...

Listen, daroga, listen, what I did... I tore off my mask so as not to lose a single one of her tears... And she did not run away!... And she is not not dead! She remained alive, crying... over me... with me... We cried together!... Lord of heaven! you have given me all the happiness in the world!...","‘Yes, Daroga, I felt her tears drop on my forehead! They were warm and soft! I felt them run under my mask and they mingled with my own tears. Yes, I felt her tears on my lips, on my tongue. And do you know what I did then, Daroga?

"Raoul crut qu'elle allait lui proposer quelque partie de campagne, loin de ce monument, qu'il détestait comme une prison et dont il sentait rageusement le geôlier se promener dans les murs... le geôlier Erik... Mais elle le conduisit sur la scène, et le fit asseoir sur la margelle de bois d'une fontaine, dans la paix et la fraîcheur douteuse d'un premier décor planté pour le prochain spectacle; un autre jour, elle erra avec lui, le tenant par la main, dans les allées abandonnées d'un jardin dont les plantes grimpantes avaient été découpées par les mains habiles d'un décorateur, comme si les vrais cieux, les vraies fleurs, la vraie terre lui étaient à jamais défendus et qu'elle fût condamnée à ne plus respirer d'autre atmosphère que celle du théâtre! Le jeune homme hésitait à lui poser la moindre question, car, comme il lui apparaissait tout de suite qu'elle n'y pouvait répondre, il redoutait de la faire inutilement souffrir. De temps en temps un pompier passait, qui veillait de loin sur leur idylle mélancolique. Parfois, elle essayait courageusement de se tromper et de le tromper sur la beauté mensongère de ce cadre inventé pour l'illusion des hommes. Son imagination toujours vive le parait des plus éclatantes couleurs et telles, disait-elle, que la nature n'en pouvait fournir de comparables. Elle s'exaltait, cependant que Raoul, lentement, pressait sa main fiévreuse. Elle disait: «Voyez, Raoul, ces murailles, ces bois, ces berceaux, ces images de toile peinte, tout cela a vu les plus sublimes amours, car ici elles ont été inventées par les poètes, qui dépassent de cent coudées la taille des hommes. Dites-moi donc que notre amour se trouve bien là, mon Raoul, puisque lui aussi a été inventé, et qu'il n'est, lui aussi, hélas! qu'une illusion!","Raoul thought she was going to offer him some part of the country, far from this monument, which he hated like a prison and of which he felt the jailer furiously walking around within the walls... the jailer Erik... But she led him on the stage, and made him sit on the wooden rim of a fountain, in the peace and dubious freshness of a first stage planted for the next spectacle; another day, she wandered with him, holding his hand, in the abandoned paths of a garden whose climbing plants had been cut by the skilful hands of a decorator, as if the real skies, the real flowers, the true land were forever forbidden to her and that she was condemned to breathe no more atmosphere than that of the theatre! The young man hesitated to ask her the slightest question, for, as it immediately seemed to him that she could not answer them, he was afraid of making her suffer unnecessarily. From time to time a fireman passed, watching over their melancholy idyll from afar. Sometimes she bravely tried to deceive herself and deceive him about the deceitful beauty of this frame invented for the illusion of men. Her ever-vivid imagination adorned her with the most dazzling colors, and such, she said, that nature could not furnish comparable ones. She was getting excited, while Raoul slowly squeezed her feverish hand. She said: “Look, Raoul, these walls, these woods, these cradles, these images of painted canvas, all this has seen the most sublime loves, because here they were invented by the poets, which exceed by a hundred cubits the size of the men. Tell me then that our love is really there, my Raoul, since he too was invented, and he too is, alas! what an illusion!","Raoul thought that she was proposing a stroll in the country far from the building that he now loathed; to him, it was a prison whose jailer he could feel stalking within – a jailer called Erik. But Christine led him to the stage and invited him to sit on the wooden lip of a fountain, in the unlikely coolness and peace of the first set for the next performance. On another occasion, she took him by the hand to a deserted garden where they wandered together amid vines whose leaves were cut-outs made by some skilful decorator. It was as if real skies, real flowers, real earth were forbidden her for all time, as if she were doomed to breathe no other air than that of this theatre. Raoul dared not question her: aware that she could provide no answer, he was reluctant to cause her unnecessary suffering. Now and again, a fireman would pass on his rounds, watching over their melancholy idyll from afar. Sometimes she bravely sought to deceive herself and to deceive him with the illusory beauty of this fake world. Her ever-lively imagination painted it in the most striking colours – colours, she said, unlike any that nature could provide. As her excitement grew, Raoul steadfastly held her feverish hand. ‘Look, Raoul!’ she said. ‘These walls, these woods, these bowers, these pictures painted on to the backcloth have witnessed the most sublime idylls, love stories invented by poets who soared ethereal above the common man. Tell me, Raoul, is this not a fitting place for our love, since it too was born out of fancy and is, alas, no more than an illusion?’","Raoul thought she was going to suggest an excursion to the country, an outing to somewhere away from that building which he now loathed: it was a jail and, with rage in his heart, he could sense its jailer walking inside the walls… a jailer named Erik… Instead, she led him on to the stage and sat him down on the wooden rim of a fountain in the quiet and rather faded surroundings of the set of the next production. On another occasion she took his hand and led him down deserted walks in a garden where climbing plants had been cut out by a clever set-designer. It was as if real skies, real flowers, real earth were permanently denied her and she was doomed never to breathe any air except that of a theatre! Raoul hesitated to ask her anything because he soon realized that she could not answer his questions and he did not wish to press her unnecessarily. From time to time they saw a fireman on routine duties, a solitary witness of their melancholy idyll. Sometimes she put on a brave face and tried to deceive both herself and Raoul by extolling the fake charms of some setting designed to stoke human illusions. Her imagination, always lively, painted it in dazzling colours which, she said, nature could not match, let alone improve on. She grew more excited while Raoul gently took her fevered hand. She said: ‘Raoul, look at those walls, the woods, the arbours, all these pictures on painted canvas! They have witnessed sublime love invented by poets who stand head and shoulders above other men. Admit it, Raoul: our love has a place among them, for it too is an invention and can never be more than an illusion!’","Raoul thought that she would propose a stroll in the country, far from that building which he detested as a prison whose jailer he could feel walking within the walls ... the jailer Erik ... But she took him to the stage and made him sit on the wooden curb of a well, in the doubtful peace and coolness of a first scene set for the evening’s performance. On another day, she wandered with him, hand in hand, along the deserted paths of a garden whose creepers had been cut out by a decorator’s skilful hands. It was as though the real sky, the real flowers, the real earth were forbidden her for all time"

Tout de même, je désirerais profiter de ce que vous n'avez pas encore jeté Christine Daaé à la porte pour l'entendre ce soir dans le rôle de Siebel, puisque celui de Marguerite, depuis son triomphe de l'autre jour, lui est interdit, et je vous prierai de ne point disposer de ma loge aujourd'hui ni les jours suivants; car je ne terminerai pas cette lettre sans vous avouer combien j'ai été désagréablement surpris, ces temps derniers, en arrivant à l'Opéra, d'apprendre que ma loge avait été louée,—au bureau de location,—sur vos ordres.","“My dear Director, I beg your pardon for coming to trouble you at these precious moments when you are deciding the fate of the best artists of the Opera, when you are renewing important engagements and when you conclude new ones; and that with a certainty of sight, an understanding of the theater, a science of the public and its tastes, an authority which came very near to stupefying my old experience. I am aware of what you have just done for Carlotta, Sorelli and little Jammes, and for a few others whose admirable qualities, talent or genius you have guessed. I write these words; it is obviously not for Carlotta, who sings like a syringe and who should never have left the Ambassadors or the Jacquin café; nor for Sorelli, who is especially successful in the bodywork; nor for little Jammes, who dances like a calf in the meadow. Neither is it for Christine Daaé, whose genius is certain, but whom you leave with jealous care away from any important creation. .)—Well, you're free to run your little business as you see fit, aren't you? All the same, I would like to take advantage of the fact that you have not yet thrown Christine Daaé out to hear her this evening in the role of Siebel, since that of Marguerite, since her triumph the other day, is forbidden, and I beg you not to dispose of my box today or the following days; for I will not end this letter without confessing to you how disagreeably surprised I was, lately, on arriving at the Opera, to learn that my box had been rented—at the rental office—on your orders.","DEAR DIRECTOR, – Please excuse my troubling you at perhaps one of those precious moments when you are deciding the fate of the most accomplished artists of the Opera House: extending important contracts, signing new ones and displaying in all this a sureness of judgement, a knowledge of the theatre, an understanding of the public and their taste, and an authority that – experienced as I am in these matters – I find almost astonishing. I know what you have just done for Carlotta, Sorelli and Little Jammes, as well as a few others whose admirable qualities, talent or genius you have divined. (You know perfectly well what this is about: I am not referring to Carlotta who cannot sing for toffee, and should have stayed at the Théâtre des Ambassadeurs and the Café Jacquin;7 nor to Sorelli whose success largely lies in the chassis department; nor to Little Jammes who dances like a heifer in a meadow; neither am I referring to Christine Daaé whose talent is unquestionable, but whom you invidiously prevent from singing new roles.) You are, after all, free to conduct your little business as you think fit, are you not? All the same, before you are minded to sack Christine Daaé, I should like to have the opportunity to hear her sing Siebel, as the role of Marguerite has been denied to her since her triumph of the other day. Please ensure that my box is placed at my disposal today and every day henceforth for, lately, on my arrival at the Opera I have had the disagreeable surprise to learn from the box-office that, on your orders, it was let for rent.","‘Dear Director, ‘I apologize for taking up your valuable time just now when you are busy deciding the fate of the Opera’s greatest artists, renewing important contracts and drafting new ones, all with a breadth of vision, an understanding of the theatre, a knowledge of the public and its tastes, and an unquestionable authority which, speaking as one with long experience of these matters, I find quite astonishing. I know what you have decided for La Carlotta, La Sorelli and the Jammes girl, and for one or two others in whom you have seen admirable signs of promise, of talent or genius. (You will surely know who I have in mind when I use those words; obviously not Carlotta who can’t sing to save her life and who should never have left Les Ambassadeurs or the Café Jacques; * nor La Sorelli who owes her success mostly to the way she’s built; nor the Jammes girl who dances like a cow in a field; nor Christine Daaé, who has genius but is assiduously sidelined and denied the chance of creating a role in an important new production.) Still, you are free to manage your little affairs as you think best, are you not? ‘However, before you get round to showing Christine Daaé the door, I would like to hear her sing Siebel, given that she has not been offered the role of Marguerite despite her great success last week. I would be obliged if you did not allow my box to be used today nor the next few days; for I will not end this letter without mentioning how surprised I was the other day when I came to the Opera only to be informed that you had left instructions, at the ticket office, that tickets for my box had been sold.","Dear Mr. Manager: I am sorry to have to trouble you at a time when you must be so very busy, renewing important engagements, signing fresh ones and generally displaying your excellent taste. I know what you have done for Carlotta, Sorelli and little Jammes and for a few others whose admirable qualities of talent or genius you have suspected. Of course, when I use these words, I do not mean to apply them to La Carlotta, who sings like a squirt and who ought never to have been allowed to leave the Ambassadeurs and the Café Jacquin; nor to La Sorelli, who owes her success mainly to the coach-builders; nor to little Jammes, who dances like a calf in a field. And I am not speaking of Christine Daaé either, though her genius is certain, whereas your jealousy prevents her from creating any important part. When all is said, you are free to conduct your little business as you think best, are you not? All the same, I should like to take advantage of the fact that you have not turned Christine Daaé out of doors by hearing her this evening in the part of Siebel, as that of Margarita has been forbidden her since her triumph of the other evening; and I will ask you not to dispose of my box today nor on the following days, for I can not end this letter without telling you how disagreeably surprised I have been once or twice, to hear, on arriving at the Opera, that my box had been sold, at the box-office, by your orders."

He seemed to enjoy a little more security than he had shown earlier when both of them had stopped at the third, did not depart from the attitude of the hand!...","Having now reached the stage cellar, the Persian breathed more easily.

"Et c'est là que nous les retrouverons avec les nouveaux directeurs MM. Armand Moncharmin et Firmin Richard. Les premiers connaissaient à peine les seconds, mais ils se répandirent en grandes protestations d'amitié et ceux-ci leur répondirent par mille compliments; de telle sorte que ceux des invités qui avaient redouté une soirée un peu maussade montrèrent immédiatement des mines réjouies. Le souper fut presque gai et l'occasion s'étant présentée de plusieurs toasts, M. le commissaire du gouvernement y fut si particulièrement habile, mêlant la gloire du passé aux succès de l'avenir, que la plus grande cordialité régna bientôt parmi les convives. La transmission des pouvoirs directoriaux s'était faite la veille, le plus simplement possible, et les questions qui restaient à régler entre l'ancienne et la nouvelle direction y avaient été résolues sous la présidence du commissaire du gouvernement dans un si grand désir d'entente de part et d'autre, qu'en vérité on ne pouvait s'étonner, dans cette soirée mémorable, de trouver quatre visages de directeurs aussi souriants.","And that's where we'll find them with the new MM directors. Armand Moncharmin and Firmin Richard. The former hardly knew the latter, but they burst into great protestations of friendship, and the latter replied to them with a thousand compliments; so that those of the guests who had feared a somewhat gloomy evening immediately showed happy faces. The supper was almost gay, and the occasion having presented itself for several toasts, the government commissioner was so particularly skilful at it, mingling the glory of the past with the successes of the future, that the greatest cordiality soon reigned among the guests. The transmission of managerial powers had taken place the day before, as simply as possible, and the questions which remained to be settled between the old and the new management had been resolved under the chairmanship of the government commissioner in such a great desire to agreement on both sides that, in truth, one could not be surprised, on this memorable evening, to find four faces of directors so smiling.","This is precisely where we find them now, in the company of the new directors, Messrs Armand Moncharmin and Firmin Richard. The outgoing directors hardly knew their successors, but made abundant professions of friendship and received myriad compliments in return; upon which, those of the guests who had dreaded the prospect of a somewhat tedious evening began to perk up. The supper was little short of lively and, when glasses were raised, the government representative proposed a toast to the glories of the past and the successes of the future with such consummate skill that the utmost cordiality soon reigned among the guests.","There is where we now catch up with them, along with the new team of Messrs Armand Moncharmin and Firmin Richard. The outgoing Directors barely knew their successors, but they put on a great show of friendship which was returned with interest. As a result, guests who had feared they were in for a dull evening began to look much happier. The supper livened up considerably and when the time came for toasts, the junior government minister acquitted himself so deftly, linking the great glories of the past with the great successes to come, that a mood of great conviviality settled on the whole gathering. The actual handing over of directorial powers had taken place informally the previous evening and all outstanding matters between the old Directors and the new had been settled by the junior minister with such good will on all sides that no one present on that memorable occasion had any reason to be surprised to find broad smiles on the faces of all four Directors.","Here they found the new managers, M. Armand Moncharmin and M. Firmin Richard, whom they hardly knew; nevertheless, they were lavish in protestations of friendship and received a thousand flattering compliments in reply, so that those of the guests who had feared that they had a rather tedious evening in store for them at once put on brighter faces. The supper was almost gay and a particularly clever speech of the representative of the government, mingling the glories of the past with the successes of the future, caused the greatest cordiality to prevail."

The people did not seem to me to be in their right mind; and they made stupid remarks. I said that, if the noise was repeated, I should be compelled to clear the box. The moment I left, I heard the laughing again, with fresh protests from the house. I returned with a municipal guard, who turned them out. They protested, still laughing, saying they would not go unless they had their money back. At last, they became quiet and I allowed them to enter the box again. The laughter at once recommenced; and this time, I had them turned out definitely."

The Persian stopped Raoul and, in a low voice, so low that Raoul could hardly hear him, he asked him:","They now stood in the centre of a vast, dimly lit room that resembled an empty town square. The Persian stopped Raoul and turned to him.","They were now in the middle of what looked like a regular Paris square. It was a large area dimly lit by one feeble lamp and was deserted.

The Persian stopped Raoul and, in the softest of whispers, asked:"
"Elle sut que le comte de Chagny, pour faire plaisir à son frère, avait fait des démarches très actives en sa faveur auprès de M. Richard; elle lui écrivit pour le remercier et aussi pour le prier de ne plus parler d'elle à ses directeurs. Quelles pouvaient bien être alors les raisons d'une aussi étrange attitude? Les uns ont prétendu qu'il y avait là un incommensurable orgueil, d'autres ont crié à une divine modestie. On n'est point si modeste que cela quand on est au théâtre; en vérité, je ne sais si je ne devrais point écrire simplement ce mot: effroi. Oui, je crois bien que Christine Daaé avait alors peur de ce qui venait de lui arriver et qu'elle en était aussi stupéfaite que tout le monde autour d'elle. Stupéfaite? Allons donc! J'ai là une lettre de Christine (collection du Persan) qui se rapporte aux événements de cette époque. Eh bien, après l'avoir relue, je n'écrirai point que Christine était stupéfaite ou même effrayée de son triomphe, mais bien épouvantée. Oui, oui... épouvantée! «Je ne me reconnais plus quand je chante!» dit-elle.","She learned that the Comte de Chagny, to please her brother, had taken very active steps in her favor with M. Richard; she wrote to thank him and also to beg him not to speak of her to his directors any more. What could well have been the reasons for such a strange attitude? Some claimed that there was an immeasurable pride there, others cried out for divine modesty. One is not so modest as that when one is at the theatre; in truth, I don't know if I shouldn't simply write this word: dread. Yes, I do believe that Christine Daaé was then afraid of what had just happened to her and that she was as amazed by it as everyone around her. Stunned? Let's go! I have here a letter from Christine (Persan collection) which relates to the events of that time. Well, after having read it again, I will not write that Christine was amazed or even frightened by her triumph, but quite terrified. Yes, yes... terrified! “I no longer recognize myself when I sing!” she says.","When she learned that, to please his brother, the Count de Chagny had diligently pleaded her cause with M. Richard, she wrote to thank him, but also asked him not to mention her again to the directors of the Opera House. What might be the reason for such curious behaviour? Some claimed that it was a mark of immeasurable pride; others spoke of her saint-like modesty. Yet, as a rule, artists are rarely so modest; in truth I am rather tempted to ascribe her actions to sheer dread. Yes, I believe that Christine Daaé was frightened by what had just happened to her, and was as taken aback by it as everybody else around her. I have here with me one of her letters (from the Persian’s collection) relating the events of that time. To suggest that Christine was taken aback or even frightened by her triumph is in fact an understatement: having reread the letter, I would say that she was terrified. Yes, yes, terrified. ‘I am no longer myself when I sing,’ she wrote.","She learned that to please his brother, the Count de Chagny had been actively promoting her interests with M. Richard. She wrote to thank him but asked him not to speak up for her to the Directors any more. Why such curious behaviour? Some took it as a sign of overweening arrogance, others of angelic modesty. But no one who treads the boards can afford to be quite so modest. Indeed, I’m not sure if I shouldn’t simply put her actions down to one word: fear. I truly believe Christine Daaé was frightened of what had happened to her and was as stunned as everyone else. Stunned? Surely not! But I have here a letter (from the Persian’s private collection) which throws light on the events of that time. Having reread it, I will not write that Christine was either stunned by or frightened of her triumph, but terrified of it. Yes: terrified! ‘I no longer know who I am when I sing!’ she says.","She knew that the Comte de Chagny, to please his brother, had done his best on her behalf with M. Richard; and she wrote to thank him and also to ask him to cease speaking in her favour. Her reason for this curious attitude was never known. Some pretended that it was due to overweening pride; others spoke of her heavenly modesty. But people on the stage are not so modest as all that; and I think that I shall not be far from the truth if I ascribe her action simply to fear. Yes, I believe that Christine Daaé was frightened by what had happened to her. I have a letter of Christine’s (it forms part of the Persian’s collection), relating to this period, which suggests a feeling of absolute dismay: “I don’t know myself when I sing,” writes the poor child."

Et cependant, ici, nous ne courons aucun danger; nous sommes chez nous, chez moi, dans le ciel, en plein air, en plein jour.

"Le comte estimait qu'à l'âge de Raoul trop de sagesse n'est plus tout à fait sage. C'était un caractère fort bien équilibré, que celui de Philippe, pondéré dans ses travaux, comme dans ses plaisirs, toujours d'une tenue parfaite, incapable de montrer à son frère un méchant exemple. Il l'emmena partout avec lui. Il lui fit même connaître le foyer de la danse. Je sais bien que l'on racontait que le comte était du «dernier bien» avec la Sorelli. Mais quoi! pouvait-on faire un crime à ce gentilhomme, resté célibataire, et qui, par conséquent, avait bien des loisirs devant lui, surtout depuis que ses sœurs étaient établies, de venir passer une heure ou deux, après son dîner, dans la compagnie d'une danseuse qui, évidemment, n'était point très, très spirituelle, mais qui avait les plus jolis yeux du monde? Et puis, il y a des endroits où un vrai Parisien, quand il tient le rang du comte de Chagny, doit se montrer, et, à cette époque, le foyer de la danse de l'Opéra était un de ces endroits-là.","The Count believed that at Raoul's age too much wisdom is no longer entirely wise. It was a character very well balanced, that of Philippe, balanced in his work, as in his pleasures, always of a perfect bearing, incapable of showing his brother a bad example. He took her everywhere with him. He even introduced her to the foyer of the dance. I know very well that it was said that the Count was of the ""last good"" with the Sorelli. But what! Could a crime be attributed to this gentleman, who had remained unmarried and who, consequently, had plenty of leisure ahead of him, especially since his sisters were established, of coming to spend an hour or two, after his dinner, in the company of a dancer who, obviously, was not very, very witty, but who had the prettiest eyes in the world? And then, there are places where a true Parisian, when he holds the rank of the Comte de Chagny, must show himself, and, at that time, the home of the dance at the Opera was one of those places.","He felt that Raoul had reached an age when one could be too good for one’s own good. Philippe, for his part, had a well-balanced character; he was measured in his approach to work and pleasure alike, perfectly mannered and quite incapable of setting a bad example to his brother. He took Raoul with him wherever he went. He even introduced him to the Ballet Room. I know that Philippe was said to be on ‘best terms’ with Sorelli. But what of it? He was a bachelor with plenty of time on his hands, especially now that his sisters were settled. Surely no one could reproach him for spending an hour or two after dinner in the company of a dancer who, though hardly noted for her sparkling wit, had the most beautiful eyes! Besides, there are places where a true Parisian of such great standing as the Count is duty bound to make an appearance; and, at that time, the Ballet Room was such a place.","The Count took the view that at Raoul’s age, being a goody-goody wasn’t altogether a good thing. He himself was level-headed, took his pleasures as soberly as he approached his work, always behaved impeccably, and was incapable of setting his brother a bad example. He took him everywhere, even to the foyer of the corps de ballet. I know of course that people said the Count was ‘very close’ to La Sorelli. But surely no one would criticize a gentleman who was single and therefore had lots of leisure time on his hands, especially now that his sisters had been suitably provided for, and begrudge him the right to spend a few hours, after dinner, in the company of a dancer who might not be particularly clever but had the prettiest eyes imaginable? Besides, there are places where a true Parisian, when he holds the rank of Count de Chagny, must be seen, and in those days the foyer of the corps de ballet was one of them. *","The count considered that, at Raoul’s age, it is not good to be too good. Philippe himself had a character that was very well-balanced in work and pleasure alike; his demeanour was always faultless; and he was incapable of setting his brother a bad example. He took him with him wherever he went. He even introduced him to the foyer of the ballet. I know that the count was said to be “on terms” with Sorelli. But it could hardly be reckoned as a crime for this nobleman, a bachelor, with plenty of leisure, especially since his sisters were settled, to come and spend an hour or two after dinner in the company of a dancer, who, though not so very, very witty, had the finest eyes that ever were seen! And, besides, there are places where a true Parisian, when he has the rank of the Comte de Chagny, is bound to show himself; and at that time the foyer of the ballet at the Opera was one of those places.5"

Richard était ce qu'on est convenu d'appeler un autoritaire, c'est-à-dire qu'il avait un fort mauvais caractère.","I will end my quotation here, from which it seems to me to follow quite clearly that if Mr. Firmin Richard loved almost all music and all musicians, it was the duty of all musicians to love Mr. Firmin Richard. Let's say in ending this brief portrait that Mr. Richard was what is commonly called an authoritarian, that is to say, he had a very bad character.","I need not quote further from this review, which already makes abundantly clear, I would think, that since Firmin Richard loved virtually all music and all musicians, so all musicians were duty bound to love Firmin Richard in return. Let me add, to complete this hasty portrait of him, that he had what some would euphemistically call an ‘authoritarian character’, and others a ‘foul temper’.","I will spare the reader the rest, for it must be pretty clear from it that if M. Richard liked every kind of music and all sorts of musicians, it was the duty of all musicians to like M. Firmin Richard. Let us conclude by saying according to the thumbnail sketch he was what is commonly called an autocrat, which is to say that he was not a very pleasant man.","Clearly, therefore, it was the duty of every sort of musician to like M. Firmin Richard. The only things to be said against him were that he was rather masterful in his ways and endowed with a very hasty temper."

"D'après le Persan, Erik était originaire d'une petite ville aux environs de Rouen. C'était le fils d'un entrepreneur de maçonnerie. Il avait fui de bonne heure le domicile paternel, où sa laideur était un objet d'horreur et d'épouvante pour ses parents. Quelque temps, il s'était exhibé dans les foires, où son imprésario le montrait comme «mort vivant». Il avait dû traverser l'Europe de foire en foire et compléter son étrange éducation d'artiste et de magicien à la source même de l'art et de la magie, chez les Bohémiens. Toute une période de l'existence d'Erik était assez obscure. On le retrouve à la foire de Nijni-Novgorod, où alors il se produisait dans toute son affreuse gloire. Déjà il chantait comme personne au monde n'a jamais chanté; il faisait le ventriloque et se livrait à des jongleries extraordinaires dont les caravanes, à leur retour en Asie, parlaient encore, tout le long du chemin. C'est ainsi que sa réputation passa les murs du palais de Mazenderan, où la petite sultane, favorite du sha-en-shah, s'ennuyait. Un marchand de fourrures, qui se rendait à Samarkand et qui revenait de Nijni-Novgorod, raconta les miracles qu'il avait vus sous la tente d'Erik. On fit venir le marchand au Palais, et le daroga de Mazenderan dut l'interroger. Puis, le daroga fut chargé de se mettre à la recherche d'Erik. Il le ramena en Perse, où pendant quelques mois il fit, comme on dit en Europe, la pluie et le beau temps. Il commit ainsi pas mal d'horreurs, car il semblait ne connaître ni le bien ni le mal, et il coopéra à quelques beaux assassinats politiques aussi tranquillement qu'il combattit, avec des inventions diaboliques, l'émir d'Afghanistan, en guerre avec l'Empire. Le sha-en-shah le prit en amitié. C'est à ce moment que se placent les Heures roses de Mazenderan, dont le récit du daroga nous a donné un aperçu. Comme Erik avait, en architecture, des idées tout à fait personnelles et qu'il concevait un palais comme un prestidigitateur peut imaginer un coffret à combinaisons, le sha-en-shah lui commanda une construction de ce genre, qu'il mena à bien et qui était, paraît-il, si ingénieuse que Sa Majesté pouvait se promener partout sans qu'on l'aperçût et disparaître sans qu'il fût possible de découvrir par quel artifice. Quand le sha-en-shah se vit le maître d'un pareil joyau, il ordonna, ainsi que l'avait fait certain Tsar à l'égard du génial architecte d'une église de la place Rouge, à Moscou, qu'on crevât à Erik ses yeux d'or. Mais il réfléchit que, même aveugle, Erik pourrait construire encore, pour un autre souverain, une aussi inouïe demeure, et puis, enfin, que, Erik vivant, quelqu'un avait le secret du merveilleux palais. La mort d'Erik fut décidée, ainsi que celle de tous les ouvriers qui avaient travaillé sous ses ordres. Le daroga de Mazenderan fut chargé de l'exécution de cet ordre abominable. Erik lui avait rendu quelques services et l'avait bien fait rire. Il le sauva en lui procurant les moyens de s'enfuir. Mais il faillit payer de sa tête cette faiblesse généreuse. Heureusement pour le daroga, on trouva, sur la rive de la mer Caspienne, un cadavre à moitié mangé par les oiseaux de mer et qui passa pour celui d'Erik, à cause que des amis du daroga avaient revêtu cette dépouille d'effets ayant appartenu à Erik lui-même. Le daroga en fut quitte pour la perte de sa faveur, de ses biens, et pour l'exil. Le Trésor persan continua cependant, car le daroga était issu de race royale, de lui faire une petite rente de quelques centaines de francs par mois, et c'est alors qu'il vint se réfugier à Paris.","According to the Persian, Erik was from a small town near Rouen. He was the son of a masonry contractor. He had fled early from his father's domicile, where his ugliness was an object of horror and terror for his parents. For some time he had exhibited himself at fairs, where his manager showed him to be ""living dead."" He had had to cross Europe from fair to fair and complete his strange education as an artist and magician at the very source of art and magic, among the Bohemians. A whole period of Erik's existence was quite obscure. We find him at the Nizhni-Novgorod fair, where he then performed in all his hideous glory. He was already singing like no one in the world has ever sung; he played the ventriloquist and gave himself up to extraordinary juggling which the caravans, on their return to Asia, still talked about all along the way. Thus his reputation passed the walls of the palace of Mazenderan, where the little sultana, favorite of the sha-en-shah, was bored. A fur trader, who was traveling to Samarkand and returning from Nizhny Novgorod, told of the miracles he had seen in Erik's tent. The merchant was summoned to the Palace, and the daroga of Mazenderan had to interrogate him. Then, the daroga was instructed to go in search of Erik. He brought him back to Persia, where for a few months he had, as they say in Europe, rain or shine. He thus committed a lot of horrors, because he seemed to know neither good nor evil, and he cooperated in some fine political assassinations as calmly as he fought, with diabolical inventions, the Emir of Afghanistan, at war with the Empire. The sha-en-shah befriended him. It is at this moment that the Pink Hours of Mazenderan take place, of which the story of the daroga has given us a glimpse. As Erik had, in architecture, completely personal ideas and that he conceived a palace as a magician can imagine a chest of combinations, the sha-en-shah commissioned a construction of this kind from him, which he carried out successfully. and which was, it seems, so ingenious that His Majesty could walk everywhere without being seen and disappear without it being possible to discover by what artifice. When the sha-en-shah saw himself the master of such a jewel, he ordered, as a certain Tsar had done with regard to the brilliant architect of a church in Red Square, in Moscow, that burst out Erik's golden eyes. But he reflected that, even blind, Erik could still build, for another sovereign, such an incredible residence, and then, finally, that, Erik alive, someone had the secret of the marvelous palace. Erik's death was decided, as well as that of all the workers who had worked under his orders. The daroga of Mazenderan was charged with the execution of this abominable order. Erik had done him a few favors and made him laugh. He saved him by providing him with the means to escape. But he nearly paid with his head for this generous weakness. Fortunately for the daroga, a corpse was found on the shore of the Caspian Sea, half eaten by seabirds and which passed for that of Erik, because friends of the daroga had dressed this body in effects having belonged to Erik himself. The daroga got off with the loss of his favour, of his possessions, and of exile. The Persian treasury continued, however, because the daroga was of royal descent, to make him a small income of a few hundred francs a month, and it was then that he came to take refuge in Paris.","According to the Persian, Erik had been born in a small town near Rouen and was the son of a builder.2 His ugliness filled his parents with horror and fear, and he ran away from home at an early age. For a time he was exhibited at fairs, where a showman advertised him as ‘the living corpse’. He must have crossed the whole of Europe, going from fair to fair, and completed his unconventional education as an artist and magician at the source of art and magic among the Romani.3 Little is known of Erik’s life during that time. He reappears at the fair of Nijny Novgorod,4 where he performed in all his hideous glory. He had already developed a unique singing voice; and his displays of ventriloquism and legerdemain5 were so dazzling that they were a constant topic of conversation among the travellers on their way to Asia. Spreading along the caravan routes, his reputation reached as far as the Mazenderan palace, where the young sultana, the Shah-in-Shah’s6 favourite, was suffering from intense boredom. A fur merchant, on his way to Samarkand7 from Nijny Novgorod, spoke of the wonders he had seen Erik perform, and was summoned to the palace. There he was questioned by the Daroga of Mazenderan, who instructed him to go back and procure Erik’s services. Thus Erik came to Persia and for a while enjoyed great influence at court. Seemingly unable to distinguish between right and wrong, he committed quite a few crimes during this period. He had a hand in a number of cold-blooded political assassinations and put some of his diabolical inventions to use when the Shah waged war against the Emir of Afghanistan.8 The Shah took to him and thus began the Rosy Hours of Mazenderan, which the Daroga mentioned in his narrative. When the Shah heard of Erik’s highly original ideas on the subject of architecture – he conceived of a building as a box of tricks – he asked him to design and construct a new palace. The result was said to be ingenious: His Majesty was able to come and go within the edifice without being seen, and to appear and disappear as if by magic. When he took possession of this gem, he decided to deal with Erik in the same way a certain tsar had treated the brilliant architect of a church on Red Square in Moscow:9 Erik’s yellow eyes would have to be put out. But then he reflected that, even if he were blind, Erik would still be able to design a grand palace on similar lines for another sovereign; and that, as long as Erik lived, someone would know the secret of that wondrous palace. So he ordered that Erik be executed, together with all the men who had worked under him. It fell to the Daroga of Mazenderan to carry out this abominable decree. Remembering that Erik had rendered him some services and often amused him, the Daroga enabled him to escape, and this generous gesture nearly cost him his life. Fortunately for the Daroga, a corpse, half eaten by birds of prey, happened to be found on the shore of the Caspian Sea; the Daroga’s friends dressed it in Erik’s clothes and passed it off as the body of the fugitive. The Daroga’s life was spared, but his property was confiscated and he was banished for ever. As a member of the royal family, however, he continued to receive from the Persian Treasury a modest pension of a few hundred francs per month, on which he lived when he fled to Paris.","According to the Persian, Erik was born in a small town near Rouen, the son of a builder. He had run away from home at an early age, for his ugliness filled his parents with horror and disgust. For a period he had been exhibited as a freak in fairground shows where he was billed as ‘The Living Corpse’. He seems to have travelled from fair to fair throughout Europe with a group of gypsies* with whom he completed his education as artist and magician. Then follows a blank phase of his life. He next surfaces at the Great Fair of Nizhnii Novgorod. * where, in all his majestic ugliness, he made a huge impression. By now, he had already learned to sing like no one else had ever sung before; he also demonstrated his skills as a ventriloquist and a magician of extraordinary dexterity. Caravans returning to Asia spread word of him and it was in this way that his fame travelled as far as the walls of the palace of Mazanderan where the young Sultana, the favourite wife of the Shah, was bored. A passing furmerchant, on his way to Samarkand from Nizhnii Novgorod, told stories of the wonders he had seen Erik perform. The merchant was summoned to the Palace and the Daroga of Mazanderan was charged with questioning him. The Daroga was ordered to find Erik. He brought him back to Persia where, for several months, as we say in Europe, he ‘ruled the roost’. He used his power to commit a number of atrocities, for he seemed to have forgotten the difference between good and evil. He participated in several elegantly planned political assassinations with the same cool calculation he brought to turning diabolical inventions of his own creation against the Emir of Afghanistan who was then at war with Persia. * The Shah took to him. It was now that we can place the Rosy Hours of Mazanderan of which the Persian’s narrative has given us some idea. Knowing that Erik had very particular ideas about architecture and thought of palaces the way magicians think of trick cabinets with false bottoms, the Shah commanded him to design and construct a building along just those lines. Erik obliged and the result was apparently so ingenious that His Highness could walk through every part of it without being seen and disappear without anyone knowing how. Now master of this gem, the Shah then behaved towards Erik the way a tsar had once treated the brilliant architect of a church in Red Square in Moscow: he ordered his yellow eyes to be put out. But, he thought, even if Erik were blind, he could still build a palace no less amazing for another monarch. At the very least, as long as Erik was alive, someone would know the secrets of his fabulous palace of tricks. So he decided that he and all the labourers who had worked under Erik’s orders would have to be put to death. The Daroga of Mazanderan was ordered to carry out this odious diktat. Erik had done him a few good turns in the past and often provided him with excellent entertainment. He saved Erik’s life by helping him to escape but his generous gesture almost cost him his own life. Fortunately for him, a body was washed up on the shores of the Caspian Sea. It had been half-eaten by seabirds but was identified as Erik’s because the Daroga’s friends had dressed the remains in clothes which had belonged to him. The Daroga escaped death but lost the Shah’s favour, his property was seized and he was banished. However, since he was of royal blood, the Persian exchequer continued to pay him a small pension worth a few hundred francs a month. It was then that he sought asylum in Paris.","According to the Persian’s account, Erik was born in a small town not far from Rouen. He was the son of a master-mason. He ran away at an early age from his father’s house, where his ugliness was a subject of horror and terror to his parents. For a time, he frequented the fairs, where a showman exhibited him as the “living corpse.” He seems to have crossed the whole of Europe, from fair to fair, and to have completed his strange education as an artist and magician at the very fountain-head of art and magic, among the Gipsies. A period of Erik’s life remained quite obscure. He was seen at the fair of Nijni-Novgorod,ad where he displayed himself in all his hideous glory. He already sang as nobody on this earth had ever sung before; he practised ventriloquism and gave displays of legerdemainae so extraordinary that the caravans returning to Asia talked about it during the whole length of their journey. In this way, his reputation penetrated the walls of the palace at Mazenderan, where the little sultana, the favourite of the Shah-in-Shah,af was boring herself to death. A dealer in furs, returning to Samarkandag from Nijni-Novgorod, told of the marvels which he had seen performed in Erik’s tent. The trader was summoned to the palace and the daroga of Mazenderan was told to question him. Next the daroga was instructed to go and find Erik. He brought him to Persia, where for some months Erik’s will was law. He was guilty of not a few horrors, for he seemed not to know the difference between good and evil. He took part calmly in a number of political assassinations ; and he turned his diabolical inventive powers against the Emir of Afghanistan, who was at war with the Persian empire.ah The Shah took a liking to him. This was the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, of which the daroga’s narrative has given us a glimpse. Erik had very original ideas on the subject of architecture and thought out a palace much as a conjuror contrives a trick-casket. The Shah ordered him to construct an edifice of this kind. Erik did so; and the building appears to have been so ingenious that His Majesty was able to move about in it unseen and to disappear without a possibility of the trick’s being discovered. When the Shah-in-Shah found himself the possessor of this gem, he ordered Erik’s yellow eyes to be put out. But he reflected that, even when blind, Erik would still be able to build so remarkable a house for another sovereign; and also that, as long as Erik was alive, some one would know the secret of the wonderful palace. Erik’s death was decided upon, together with that of all the labourers who had worked under his orders. The execution of this abominable decree devolved upon the daroga of Mazenderan. Erik had shown him some slight services and procured him many a hearty laugh. He saved Erik by providing him with the means of escape, but nearly paid with his head for his generous indulgence. Fortunately for the daroga, a corpse, half-eaten by the birds of prey, was found on the shore of the Caspian Sea, and was taken for Erik’s body, because the daroga’s friends had dressed the remains in clothing that belonged to Erik. The daroga was let off with the loss of the imperial favour, the confiscation of his property and an order of perpetual banishment. As a member of the Royal House, however, he continued to receive a monthly pension of a few hundred francs from the Persian treasury; and on this he came to live in Paris."

He was quite reassured as to the fate of Raoul Chagny and Christine Daaé; no one could have doubted the word of the weeping Erik that night."

"... La salle, d'un seul mouvement, s'est levée... Dans leur loge, les deux directeurs ne peuvent retenir une exclamation d'horreur... Spectateurs et spectatrices se regardent comme pour se demander les uns aux autres l'explication d'un aussi inattendu phénomène... Le visage de la Carlotta exprime la plus atroce douleur, ses yeux semblent hantés par la folie.

The poor woman sat up, her mouth still half-open, having finished letting “that solitary voice which sang in her heart pass...” But that mouth no longer sang... she no longer dared speak, more sound...","At that moment … At that very moment, something happened, something terrible, as I said, happened. The whole house rose to its feet as one. In Box Five, the directors could not suppress their cries of horror. Men and women in the audience, baffled by such a turn of events, exchanged startled looks as Carlotta’s face contorted in agony. There was madness in her haunted eyes. The wretched woman drew herself up, with her mouth still half-open, having just sung: ‘With its melody enwind me …’ But she was singing no longer. She dared not utter another word, nor make another sound.","At this point… at that exact moment… the awful thing happened, as I said… something dreadful. The audience got to its feet as one… In their box both Directors could not suppress a horrified cry… In the audience, men and women looked around as if to ask their neighbours for an explanation for such an unexpected phenomenon… La Carlotta’s face wore an expression of the deepest anguish, her eyes looked haunted, mad. The wretched creature drew herself up, her mouth still half-open, half delivered herself of that sweet soft melody which had enfolded her.

Then quickly, he returned to Raoul.","But the Persian left him little time for reflection. Instructing him to keep still, he briefly ran back up the stairs they had just descended.

"Et le rugissement recommença, plus formidable. Et le vicomte tira, mais je ne pense pas qu'il atteignit le lion; seulement, il cassa une glace; je le constatai le lendemain matin à l'aurore. Pendant la nuit, nous avions dû faire un bon chemin, car nous nous trouvâmes soudain au bord du désert, d'un immense désert de sable, de pierres et de rochers. Ce n'était vraiment point la peine de sortir de la forêt pour tomber dans le désert. De guerre lasse, je m'étais étendu à côté du vicomte, personnellement fatigué de chercher des ressorts que je ne trouvais pas.","And the roar began again, more formidable. And the viscount shot, but I don't think he hit the lion; only he broke an ice cream; I noticed it the next morning at dawn. During the night we must have come a long way, for we suddenly found ourselves on the edge of the desert, a huge desert of sand, stones and rocks. There was really no need to leave the forest to fall into the desert. Tired of the struggle, I lay down next to the viscount, personally tired of looking for springs that I couldn't find.","It roared again, louder than before, and the Viscount fired. I doubt that he shot the lion; though he hit a mirror, as I saw the next morning, at dawn. We must have covered some considerable distance during the night, for we suddenly found ourselves at the edge of a desert, a vast desert of sand and stone. There was little point in leaving the forest only to wander in a desert. I wearily lay down beside the Viscount, exhausted by my vain search for the elusive spring.","And roar again it did, even louder than before. The Viscount fired. I don’t think he hit the lion but he certainly shattered one entire panel. I saw the result next morning, at dawn. During the night, we must have covered a great deal of ground for we now suddenly found ourselves on the edge of a desert, an immense desert of sand, shale and rock. We were not tempted to exchange forest for desert. I stretched out next to the Viscount, exhausted by the effort of searching for but not finding the secret mechanism.","And the roaring began again, louder than before. And the viscount fired, but I do not think he hit the lion; only, he smashed a mirror, as I perceived the next morning, at day-break. We must have covered a good distance during the night, for we suddenly found ourselves on the edge of the desert, an immense desert of sand, stones and rocks. It was really not worth while leaving the forest to come upon the desert. Tired out, I flung myself down beside the viscount, for I had had enough of looking for springs which I could not find."
"En même temps que je tâtais les panneaux avec le plus grand soin, je m'efforçais de ne point perdre une minute car la chaleur me gagnait de plus en plus et nous cuisions littéralement dans cette forêt enflammée.","At the same time as I felt the panels with the greatest care, I tried not to lose a minute because the heat was gaining me more and more and we were literally cooking in this flaming forest.","I ran my fingers over the successive panels with great care, but also with great speed, for I was already suffering from the heat.

"—Le fantôme! reprit Richard à voix basse et comme s'il craignait d'être entendu par d'invisibles oreilles... le fantôme!

It's only you here and me!... and if the tickets disappear through no fault of our own, neither you nor me... we'll have to believe in the ghost... in the ghost...","‘The Phantom …’ resumed Richard, in a low voice, lest invisible ears should overhear him. ‘ The Phantom … Suppose for a moment that he were truly a ghost and it was he who knocked three times on this table, as we clearly heard just now, he who placed the trick envelopes here, he who spoke in Box Five, killed Joseph Buquet, unhooked the chandelier and is now robbing us!

And if the notes disappear without either you or I having anything to do with it, well then we shall have to believe in the ghost.’","‘The Phantom!’ continued Richard in a whisper, as if he feared being overheard by invisible ears… ‘What about this Phantom! Because if after all it was a ghost who gave those three loud knocks we heard distinctly… if it was a ghost who left magic envelopes for us… who was heard talking in Box 5… killed Joseph Buquet… unhooked the chandelier… and steals our money, just think a minute… There’s only the two of us here!… So if the money vanishes and neither of us has anything to do with it… we’ll have no option but to believe in a ghost, in the Phantom of the Opera!’","“The ghost!” continued Richard, in a low voice, as though fearing lest he should be overheard by invisible ears. “The ghost!

"Le ton de ces questions est si rude que Christine regarde Raoul, étonnée, et ne lui répond pas.

Un mari, un amant qui a tous les droits, ne parlerait pas autrement à sa femme ou à sa maîtresse qui l'aurait offensé.

The young man is himself stupefied by this sudden quarrel, which he dares at the very moment when he had promised himself to make Christine hear words of gentleness, love and submission.

But he himself is irritated by his faults, and judging himself stupid, he finds no other way out of this ridiculous situation than in the fierce decision he makes to show himself odious.","The harshness in his voice, as he put those questions to her, startled Christine. She stared at him without replying. As for Raoul, he was aghast, finding himself suddenly quarrelling with her at the very moment when he should have been murmuring tender loving words. He sounded like an offended husband or lover with righteous claims on his wife’s or mistress’s affections. He knew he had spoken out of turn and felt foolish but, in his anger with himself, he saw no better way out of this absurd situation than to behave in a resolutely odious manner.","The tone of these questions was so direct that Christine was taken aback and didn’t answer. Raoul too was stunned by this sudden quarrel which he had rashly started just when he’d vowed that he would speak to Christine only in words of kindness, love and respect. A husband or a lover who has earned the right, would have spoken no differently to a wife or mistress who had wronged him in some way. But he cursed himself for going too far and, knowing that he’d behaved foolishly, found no better way out of this ludicrous pass than by deciding to behave odiously.","The tone of these questions was so rough that Christine stared at Raoul without replying.

"Ils sont formidables et au nombre de cinq. Ils reproduisent tous les plans de la scène, ses trappes et ses trappillons. Les costières seules y sont remplacées par des rails. Des charpentes transversales supportent trappes et trappillons. Des poteaux, reposant sur des dés de fonte ou de pierre, de sablières ou «chapeaux de forme», forment des séries de fermes qui permettent de laisser un libre passage aux «gloires» et autres combinaisons ou trucs. On donne à ces appareils une certaine stabilité en les reliant au moyen de crochets de fer et suivant les besoins du moment. Les treuils, les tambours, les contrepoids sont généreusement distribués dans les dessous. Ils servent à manœuvrer les grands décors, à opérer les changements à vue, à provoquer la disparition subite des personnages de féerie. C'est des dessous, ont dit MM. X., Y., Z., qui ont consacré à l'œuvre de Garnier une étude si intéressante, c'est des dessous qu'on transforme les cacochymes en beaux cavaliers, les sorcières hideuses en fées radieuses de jeunesse. Satan vient des dessous, de même qu'il s'y enfonce. Les lumières de l'enfer s'en échappent, les chœurs des démons y. prennent place.","They are formidable and five in number. They reproduce all the plans of the stage, its trapdoors and its trappillons. The curbs alone are replaced by rails. Transversal frames support trapdoors and trapdoors. Posts, resting on cast iron or stone dice, sandpits or ""form caps"", form a series of trusses which allow free passage to ""glories"" and other combinations or tricks. These devices are given a certain stability by connecting them with iron hooks and according to the needs of the moment. The winches, the drums, the counterweights are generously distributed in the undersides. They are used to maneuver large sets, to make changes on sight, to cause the sudden disappearance of fairy characters. It's underwear, said MM. X., Y., Z., who have devoted such an interesting study to the work of Garnier, it is from underneath that one transforms cacochymes into handsome cavaliers, hideous witches into radiant fairies of youth. Satan comes from below, just as he sinks into it. The lights of hell escape from it, the choirs of demons there. take place.","These could be awesome, yet also charming – as delightful as a child’s puppet theatre and as horrifying as a vast cavern. The below-stage area was five floors deep and each level or ‘mezzanine’ replicated the lay-out of the stage itself with its traps and slider cuts for scenery; only the chariot slits in the stage floor were replaced by rails.4 These traps and cuts were supported by cross-joists. Posts rising from cast iron or stone dies and connected at the top to wall-plates or bars formed a series of trusses which allowed for the free passage of heavy stage machines such as the Paradiso; when necessary, these appliances were coupled together by connecting irons for added stability. Windlasses, drums and counterweights were everywhere; they served to manoeuvre bulky scenery and change scenes during performances, as well as conjure away the performers for spectacular effect. It was in the mezzanines, wrote Messrs X., Y. and Z. in their fascinating study of Garnier’s architectural masterpiece,5 that sallow dyspeptics were turned into beautiful knights, and hideous witches into radiant, youthful fairies. It was from those depths that Satan himself would rise, and into them that he sank once more. It was where the fires of Hell smouldered, the chorus of the demons lodged … and ghosts freely roamed.","There are five levels in all and they are intimidating. They replicate all the stage sets and traps large and small. But sliders and cuts in the stage floor are replaced here by rails. Trapdoors are supported by a framework of cross timbers. Props and piles resting on cast-iron or stone dies, templates and pockets of hard core form a succession of trusses which allow clear passage for hoists and other kinds of stage machinery. They are given extra stability by linking them together and anchoring them to iron brackets or by improvised clamps. Winches, rollers and counterweights are widely distributed throughout these lower levels. They are used to move large pieces of scenery, handle transformation scenes or enable performers in spectacle plays to vanish as if by magic. According to Messrs X, Y and Z, in their absorbing study of Charles Garnier’s masterpiece, it is from these lower depths that mere mortals are changed into handsome knights and hideous old witches into fairy queens bursting with youth. Satan rises from these lower regions and returns hither by the same token. The flames of hell reach out of them and choirs of demons take up their abode there… and ghosts are in their natural element.",The cellars of the Opera are enormous and they are five in number.
"Enfin, l'heure du rendez-vous arriva. Le visage couvert d'un loup garni d'une longue et épaisse dentelle, tout empierroté de blanc, le vicomte se prouva bien ridicule d'avoir endossé ce costume des mascarades romantiques. Un homme du monde ne se déguisait pas pour aller au bal de l'Opéra. Il eût fait sourire. Une pensée consolait le vicomte: c'était qu'on ne le reconnaîtrait certes pas! Et puis, ce costume et ce loup avaient un autre avantage: Raoul allait pouvoir se promener là-dedans «comme chez lui», tout seul, avec le désarroi de son âme et la tristesse de son cœur. Il n'aurait point besoin de feindre; il lui serait superflu de composer un masque pour son visage: il l'avait!","Finally, the hour of the meeting arrived. His face covered with a wolf trimmed with long, thick lace, all beaded in white, the viscount proved to be quite ridiculous for having donned this costume of romantic masquerades. A man of the world did not disguise himself to go to the ball at the Opera. He would have made you smile. One thought consoled the Viscount: it was that they would certainly not recognize him! And then, this costume and this wolf had another advantage: Raoul was going to be able to walk around in there ""like at home"", all alone, with the disarray of his soul and the sadness of his heart. He wouldn't need to pretend; it would be superfluous for him to compose a mask for his face: he had it!","The time of his assignation came at last. Clad from head to foot in white like a romantic pierrot, his face completely covered by a mask trimmed with heavy lace, the Viscount felt quite ridiculous. Gentlemen did not attend the ball of the Opera in fancy dress, for it would surely raise a smile. He was consoled by the thought that he would never be recognized. And his costume and mask had the added advantage of allowing him to move in society and yet be alone, somewhat comfortable with the distress of his soul and the sadness of his heart. He would not have to feign, he would not need to compose himself for his face was masked.","At last the appointed time came. With his face hidden by a black velvet mask trimmed with long, heavy lace, the Viscount de Chagny, got up like a white pierrot, felt ridiculous wearing fancy dress reminiscent of Romantic-era mummeries. No man of the world went to the Opera Ball in fancy dress! People would laugh! But one thought consoled the Viscount: there was no way he would be recognized! Besides, his costume and the mask had another advantage: he would be able to move around as freely as if he were at home, alone with his tortured soul and the ice in his heart. He would not need to pretend, nor compose his feature into a mask to cover his feelings: he had one already!","The hour of the appointment came at last. With his face in a mask trimmed with long, thick lace, looking like a pierrot in his white wrap, the viscount thought himself very ridiculous. Men of the world do not go to the Opera ball in fancy-dress! It was absurd. One thought, however, consoled the viscount: he would certainly never be recognized!1 This ball was an exceptional affair, given some time before Shrovetide,l in honour of the anniversary of the birth of a famous draftsman; and it was expected to be much gayer, noisier, more Bohemian than the ordinary masked ball."

Raoul let her do it and talk. He was silent. He was now afraid that the sound of his voice would suddenly make her think, stopping her in the still fragile course of her confidences.","She shivered again and leaned towards the closed trap, listening. Raoul said nothing, for he was afraid that the sound of his voice might interrupt the all too tenuous stream of her revelations.","She gave another shudder, then leaned over the trap and listened… Raoul let her do and say whatever she liked.

"Tout le monde remarqua que MM. les directeurs démissionnaires avaient l'air gai, ce qui, en province, n'eût paru naturel à personne, mais ce qui, à Paris, fut trouvé de fort bon goût. Celui-là ne sera jamais Parisien qui n'aura point appris à mettre un masque de joie sur ses douleurs et le «loup» de la tristesse, de l'ennui ou de l'indifférence sur son intime allégresse. Vous savez qu'un de vos amis est dans la peine, n'essayez point de le consoler; il vous dira qu'il l'est déjà; mais s'il lui est arrivé quelque événement heureux, gardez-vous de l'en féliciter; il trouve sa bonne fortune si naturelle qu'il s'étonnera qu'on lui en parle. À Paris, on est, toujours au bal masqué et ce n'est point au foyer de la danse que des personnages aussi «avertis» que MM. Debienne et Poligny eussent commis la faute de montrer leur chagrin qui était réel. Et ils souriaient déjà trop à la Sorelli, qui commençait à débiter son compliment quand une réclamation de cette petite folle de Jammes vint briser le sourire de MM. les directeurs d'une façon si brutale que la figure de désolation et d'effroi qui était dessous, apparut aux yeux de tous:","Everyone noticed that MM. the resigning directors looked cheerful, which in the provinces would not have seemed natural to anyone, but which, in Paris, was considered to be in very good taste. This one will never be a Parisian who has not learned to put a mask of joy on his pain and the ""wolf"" of sadness, boredom or indifference on his inner joy. You know that one of your friends is in trouble, do not try to console him; he will tell you that he already is; but if some happy event has happened to him, take care not to congratulate him on it; he finds his good fortune so natural that he will be surprised if anyone speaks to him about it. In Paris, we are always at the masked ball and it is not at the hearth of the dance that characters as ""informed"" as MM. Debienne and Poligny would have made the mistake of showing their grief, which was real. And they were already smiling too much at La Sorelli, who was beginning to spout her compliment when a complaint from that crazy little Jammes broke the smile of MM. directors in such a brutal way that the figure of desolation and dread which was below, appeared to the eyes of all:","Everyone noticed that the outgoing directors appeared cheery. This would have seemed surprising in the provinces, but in Paris it was thought to be in the best possible taste: true Parisians have learned to wear a mask of gaiety over their sorrows, and conversely a façade of sadness, boredom or indifference over their inward joy. Thus if you know that one of your friends is aggrieved, do not try to comfort him, for he will tell you that he has already recovered; on the other hand, when he meets with good fortune, take care not to congratulate him, for he finds his situation so very natural that he will be surprised that you should remark upon it. To the Parisian, life is but a masked ball, and the Ballet Room was the last place where two men as socially aware as Messrs Debienne and Poligny would make the mistake of betraying their grief, however genuine it might be. In fact, they were smiling a little too broadly as Sorelli began her speech. Then a cry from that little madcap Jammes suddenly erased their smiles, and the dismay and fear that lay hidden beneath became at once all too apparent: ‘","Everyone noticed how cheerful the outgoing Directors looked. Now, in the provinces, this would have seemed not at all appropriate. But in Paris it was considered to be in the best possible taste. No one can become properly Parisian until he or she has learned to put a happy face on their troubles and erect a façade of misery, worry and indifference to mask inner happiness. If you know that one of your friends has problems, don’t try to comfort him, he’ll only tell you there’s no need. But if something good happens to him, never congratulate him; he is so convinced his good luck is his due that he’s surprised anyone should bother even to mention it. Paris is one huge masked ball and people as much ‘in the swim’ as Messrs Debienne and Poligny were not likely to choose the foyer of the corps de ballet to display their worries which were real enough. They were already grinning far too broadly at La Sorelli who had just begun her little speech when a cry from that minx, the irrepressible Jammes, wiped the smiles off the faces of both Directors so suddenly that the utter dismay and panic which they concealed were brutally exposed for all to see:","Everybody remarked that the retiring managers looked cheerful, as is the Paris way. None will ever be true Parisian who has not learned to wear a mask of gaiety over his sorrows and one of sadness, boredom, or indifference over his inward joy.

"À nos pieds, je trouvai le lacet du Pendjab que j'avais tant redouté toute la soirée. J'étais convaincu que ce fil avait déjà servi pour Joseph Buquet. Le chef machiniste avait dû, comme moi, surprendre certain soir Erik au moment où il faisait jouer la pierre du troisième dessous. Curieux, il avait à son tour tenté le passage avant que la pierre ne se refermât et il était tombé dans la chambre des supplices, et il n'en était sorti que pendu. J'imaginai très bien Erik traînant le corps dont il voulait se débarrasser jusqu'au décor du Roi de Lahore et l'y suspendant, pour faire un exemple ou pour grossir la terreur superstitieuse qui devait l'aider à garder les abords de la caverne!","At our feet I found the Punjab lace that I had been dreading all evening. I was convinced that this thread had already been used for Joseph Buquet. The head machinist must have, like me, surprised Erik on a certain evening when he was playing the stone from the third down.

I was convinced that this rope had been responsible for Joseph Buquet’s death. Like me, the machinist must have seen Erik work the stone, and tried it for himself. Having reached the end of the passage, he had probably fallen into the torture chamber; and, with the stone closed, death by hanging had proved his only way out. I could imagine Erik dragging the body up and hanging it next to the scene from Le Roi de Lahore as an example to others or to fuel superstitious rumours, thus guarding his retreat against potential intruders!","On the floor I found the Punjab noose I had been dreading all night. I was convinced that it had already been used on Joseph Buquet who, like me, must have come upon Erik unawares as he was opening the stone in the wall on the third level.

He had then fallen into the torture chamber and left it sometime later, feet first, after he had hanged himself. I could easily picture Erik, having to dispose of the body, dragging it back up to the third level and hooking it on the flat from Le Roi de Lahore as an example or to stoke the superstitious terror which was so useful in guarding the approaches to his lair by the lake!","At our feet, I found the Punjab lasso which I had been dreading all the evening.

"Nul mieux que lui, ne sait lancer le lacet de Pendjab et il est le prince des étrangleurs comme il est le roi des prestidigitateurs. Quand il avait fini de faire rire la petite sultane, au temps des heures roses de Mazenderan, celle-ci demandait elle-même à ce qu'il s'amusât à la faire frissonner. Et il n'avait rien trouvé de mieux que le jeu du lacet du Pendjab. Erik qui avait séjourné dans l'Inde, en était revenu avec une adresse incroyable à étrangler. Il se faisait enfermer dans une cour où l'on amenait un guerrier,—le plus souvent, un condamné à mort—armé d'une longue pique et d'une large épée. Erik, lui, n'avait que son lacet, et c'était toujours dans le moment que le guerrier croyait abattre Erik d'un coup formidable, que l'on entendait le lacet siffler. D'un coup de poignet, Erik avait serré le mince lasso au col de son ennemi, et il le traînait aussitôt devant la petite sultane et ses femmes qui regardaient à une fenêtre et applaudissaient. La petite sultane apprit, elle aussi, à lancer le lacet du Pendjab et tua ainsi plusieurs de ses femmes et même de ses amies en visite. Mais je préfère quitter ce sujet terrible des Heures Roses de Mazenderan. Si j'en ai parlé, c'est que je dus, étant arrivé avec le vicomte de Chagny dans les dessous de l'Opéra, mettre en garde mon compagnon contre une possibilité toujours menaçante autour de nous, d'étranglement. Certes! une fois dans les dessous, mes pistolets ne pouvaient plus nous servir à rien, car j'étais bien sûr que du moment qu'il ne s'était point opposé du premier coup à notre entrée dans le chemin des communards, Erik ne se laisserait plus voir. Mais il pouvait toujours nous étrangler. Je n'eus point le temps d'expliquer tout cela au vicomte et même je ne sais si, ayant disposé de ce temps, j'en aurais usé pour lui raconter qu'il y avait quelque part, dans l'ombre, un lacet du Pendjab prêt à siffler. C'était bien inutile de compliquer la situation et je me bornai à conseiller à M. de Chagny de tenir toujours sa main à hauteur de l'œil, le bras replié dans la position du tireur au pistolet qui attend le commandement de feu. Dans cette position, il est impossible, même au plus adroit étrangleur, de lancer utilement le lacet du Pendjab. En même temps que le cou, il vous prend le bras ou la main et ainsi ce lacet, que l'on peut facilement délacer, devient inoffensif.","No one knows how to throw the Punjab lace better than him and he is the prince of stranglers as he is the king of conjurers. When he had finished making the little sultana laugh, in the days of Mazenderan's rosy hours, she herself asked that he amuse himself by making her shiver. And he hadn't found anything better than the game of Punjab shoelaces. Erik, who had been in India, had come back with an incredible ability to strangle. He had himself locked up in a courtyard where a warrior—most often a condemned man—armed with a long pike and a broad sword was brought. Erik only had his shoelace, and it was always in the moment when the warrior thought he was knocking down Erik with a formidable blow, that you could hear the shoelace hissing. With a flick of his wrist, Erik had tightened the slender lasso around his enemy's collar, and he immediately dragged it in front of the little sultana and her women, who were looking at a window and applauding. The little sultana also learned to throw the Punjab lace and thus killed several of her wives and even her visiting friends. But I prefer to leave this terrible subject of Les Heures Roses de Mazenderan. If I mentioned it, it was because I had to, having arrived with the Vicomte de Chagny in the basement of the Opera, warn my companion against the possibility, always threatening around us, of strangulation. Certainly! once inside, my pistols could no longer be of any use to us, for I was quite sure that as long as he hadn't opposed our entry into the path of the communards at the first attempt, Erik would not let himself go. see more. But he could still strangle us. I didn't have time to explain all this to the viscount and even I don't know if, having had that time, I would have used it to tell him that there was somewhere, in the shadows, a lace. from Punjab ready to whistle. It was useless to complicate the situation and I confined myself to advising M. de Chagny to always hold his hand at eye level, his arm bent in the position of a pistol shooter awaiting the command to fire. In this position, it is impossible, even for the most skilful strangler, to usefully throw the Punjab lace. At the same time as the neck, it takes your arm or hand and thus this lace, which can be easily untied, becomes harmless.","No one knew better than he how to throw the Punjab cord: if he were a king among illusionists, then he was a prince among stranglers too. He had lived in India and acquired exceptional skills in the art of strangulation. Later, during the Rosy Hours of Mazenderan, the young sultana, whom Erik was employed to amuse, demanded new thrills, and he had introduced the sport of the Punjab cord for her entertainment. In an enclosure, he would face an adversary – usually a man condemned to death – armed with a long pike and a broad sword; Erik’s only weapon was the cord; and, just when his opponent seemed about to kill him with a tremendous blow, the cord would hiss through the air. With a flick of the wrist, Erik would tighten its grip round the poor wretch’s neck and drag his body before the young sultana and her female companions, who watched from a window and applauded. The sultana herself learned to wield the cord, killing several of her companions – and even a few visiting friends. But I would rather not dwell on the painful events of the Rosy Hours of Mazenderan. I only mention all this to explain my concern with the ever-present threat, once the Viscount and I had reached the mezzanines, of death by strangulation. Down there, my pistols were of little use. Since Erik had not opposed us when we entered the Communards’ passage by the mirror, I was quite certain that henceforth he would not allow himself to be seen. All the same, he could still strangle us. I had no time to explain any of this to the Viscount; and I must confess that, had time permitted, I would have probably refrained from telling him that a Punjab cord, ready for use, might be lurking somewhere in the shadows. It would have merely complicated matters. I simply instructed the Viscount to follow my example and keep his hand at eye level, with his arm bent. This way we were sure to protect our necks, for even the most adroit wielder would have caught us around the hand or arm too, and the deadly weapon would have been rendered harmless.","No one is more skilled in the art of throwing a Punjab noose. Erik is the Prince of Stranglers just as he is the King of Illusionists. Whenever, back in the days of the Rosy Hours of Mazanderan, he’d made the Sultana laugh enough, she would order him to amuse her with exciting thrills and cruel entertainments. * He found that the best way of doing this was with the Punjab noose. Erik had lived in India and had returned with astonishing expertise as a strangler. He would be shut inside a closed yard where a warrior would be brought to him, usually a criminal awaiting execution. His opponent was given a long pike and a broad sword. Erik was armed only with his noose and it was invariably when the warrior thought he was about to cut Erik down with one mighty stroke that we heard the swish of the noose through the air. With a snap of the wrist, Erik wrapped the thin cord around the neck of his adversary and with it dragged the man to a window where the young Sultana, attended by her women, was watching and clapping her hands. She herself learned to throw the Punjab noose and throttled several of her attendants and even a number of her women friends who had come to call. But I would prefer to drop the awful subject of the Rosy Hours of Mazanderan. If I have brought it up, it is only because, having brought the Viscount de Chagny down to the lower levels, I needed to warn him that there was a real danger all around us that we might be strangled. Naturally, once we were in the bowels of the Opera, pistols were useless. Since Erik had made no move against us in the Communards’ Tunnel, I thought it unlikely that he would let us catch even a glimpse of him. But he could easily garrotte us. There wasn’t time to explain all this to the Viscount and even if there had been I’m not sure I would have spent it telling him that somewhere in the dark there was a Punjab noose just waiting to come flying in our direction. There was no point making the situation even more fraught so I merely told the Viscount to keep one hand up, at eye level, with his arm bent like a duellist who, pistol in hand, stands waiting for the command to fire. With the arm held thus, it is impossible for even the most skilful strangler to use a Punjab noose. It wraps itself round not just the neck but around the hand or arm too. It can then be easily removed and is thus neutralized.","No one knows better than he how to throw the Punjab lasso, for he is the king of stranglers even as he is the prince of conjurors. When he had finished making the little sultana laugh, at the time of the “rosy hours of Mazenderan,” she herself used to ask him to amuse her by giving her a thrill. It was then that he introduced the sport of the Punjab lasso. He had lived in India and acquired an incredible skill in the art of strangulation. He would make them lock him into a courtyard to which they brought a warrior—usually, a man condemned to death—armed with a long pike and broadsword. Erik had only his lasso; and it was always just when the warrior thought that he was going to fell Erik with a tremendous blow that we heard the lasso whistle through the air. With a turn of the wrist, Erik tightened the noose round his adversary’s neck and, in this fashion, dragged him before the little sultana and her women, who sat looking from a window and applauding. The little sultana herself learned to wield the Punjab lasso and killed several of her women and even of the friends who visited her. But I prefer to drop this terrible subject of the rosy hours of Mazenderan. I have mentioned it only to explain why, on arriving with the Vicomte de Chagny in the cellars of the Opera, I was bound to protect my companion against the ever-threatening danger of death by strangling. My pistols could serve no purpose, for Erik was not likely to show himself; but Erik could always strangle us. I had no time to explain all this to the viscount; besides, there was nothing to be gained by complicating the position. I simply told M. de Chagny to keep his hand at the level of his eyes, with the arm bent, as though waiting for the command to fire. With his victim in this attitude, it is impossible even for the most expert strangler to throw the lasso with advantage. It catches you not only round the neck, but also round the arm or hand. This enables you easily to unloose the lasso, which then becomes harmless."

Enfin, comment, privés de Carlotta, MM. Debienne et Poligny s'étaient-ils adressés à la Daaé? Ils connaissaient donc son génie caché? Et s'ils le connaissaient, pourquoi le cachaient-ils? Et elle, pourquoi le cachait-elle? Chose bizarre, on ne lui connaissait point de professeur actuel. Elle avait déclaré à plusieurs reprises que, désormais elle travaillerait toute seule. Tout cela était bien inexplicable.","However, a few subscribers protested. How could such a treasure have been concealed from them for so long? Christine Daaé had hitherto been a decent Siebel next to that slightly too splendidly material Marguerite who was Carlotta. And it had taken the incomprehensible and inexcusable absence of Carlotta, at this gala evening, so that at short notice little Daaé could give her full potential in a part of the program reserved for the Spanish diva! Finally, how, deprived of Carlotta, MM. Did Debienne and Poligny contact the Daaé? So they knew his hidden genius? And if they knew him, why were they hiding him? And she, why was she hiding it? Oddly enough, no current teacher was known to him. She had declared several times that from now on she would work alone. It was all quite inexplicable.","A number of subscribers protested: why had such a treasure been kept away from them for so long? Until now Christine Daaé had played an acceptable Siébel17 to Carlotta’s all too splendidly physical Marguerite. It was only owing to Carlotta’s unexpected and unexplained absence that Daaé had been able to show, at a moment’s notice, the full measure of her genius in a part of the programme usually reserved for the Spanish diva. When Carlotta withdrew, what made Messrs Debienne and Poligny think of Daaé? Had they known all along of her hidden talent? If so, why keep it hidden? Indeed, why had she chosen to conceal it? More baffling yet, she had, for all they knew, no singing master, having declared on several occasions that she had determined to work alone. The whole thing was a mystery.","But some subscribers protested. Why had such a pearl been kept hidden from them for so long? Until then, Christine Daaé had been adequate singing Siebel * to the Marguerite of the emphatically voluptuous Carlotta. It had taken the unexplained and inexplicable absence of Carlotta from the gala concert for Mlle Daaé, at short notice, to have her chance, to rise to the occasion and show what she could do in a part of the programme featuring the Spanish diva! Finally, what had made Messrs Debienne and Poligny think of Christine Daaé? Did it mean they had known about her great, hidden talent all along? And if they had, why had they kept it hidden? Oddly, she didn’t have a singing teacher at the time. Several times she had said that henceforth she would manage without one. It was all very puzzling.","A few subscribers, however, protested. Why had so great a treasure been kept from them all that time? Till then, Christine Daaé had played a good Siebel to Carlotta’s rather too splendidly material Margarita. And it had needed Carlotta’s incomprehensible and inexcusable absence from this gala night for the little Daaé, at a moment’s warning, to show all that she could do in a part of the programme reserved for the Spanish diva! Well, what the subscribers wanted to know was, why had Debienne and Poligny applied to Daaé, when Carlotta was taken ill? Did they know of her hidden genius? And, if they knew of it, why had they kept it hidden? And why had she kept it hidden? Oddly enough, she was not known to have a professor of singing at that moment. She had often said she meant to practise alone for the future. The whole thing was a mystery."

"«M. Firmin Richard est un musicien très distingué. Harmoniste habile, contrepointiste savant, la grandeur est le principal caractère de sa composition. Il a publié de la musique de chambre très appréciée des amateurs, de la musique pour piano, sonates ou pièces fugitives remplies d'originalité, un recueil de mélodies. Enfin, La Mort d'Hercule, exécutée aux concerts du Conservatoire, respire un souffle épique qui fait songer à Gluck, un des maîtres vénérés de M. Firmin Richard. Toutefois, s'il adore Gluck, il n'en aime pas moins Piccini; M. Richard, prend son plaisir où il le trouve. Plein d'admiration pour Piccini, il s'incline devant Meyerbeer, il se délecte de Cimarosa et nul n'apprécie mieux que lui l'inimitable génie de Weber. Enfin, en ce qui concerne Wagner. M. Richard n'est pas loin de prétendre qu'il est, lui, Richard, le premier en France et peut-être le seul à l'avoir compris.»","""Mr. Firmin Richard is a very distinguished musician. Skilled harmonist, skilful counterpointist, grandeur is the main character of his composition. He has published chamber music much appreciated by amateurs, piano music, sonatas or fleeting pieces full of originality, a collection of melodies. Finally, La Mort d'Hercule, performed at the concerts of the Conservatoire, exudes an epic breath that makes one think of Gluck, one of Mr. Firmin Richard's venerated masters. However, if he adores Gluck, he does not love Piccini any less; Mr. Richard, takes his pleasure where he finds it. Full of admiration for Piccini, he bows to Meyerbeer, he delights in Cimarosa and no one appreciates Weber's inimitable genius better than him. Finally, regarding Wagner. Mr. Richard is not far from claiming that he, Richard, is the first in France and perhaps the only one to have understood it.","M. Firmin Richard is a distinguished musician. An able harmonist and an accomplished contrapuntalist, he has composed essentially lofty pieces. In addition to his chamber music, greatly appreciated by connoisseurs, he has published scores for piano – sonatas and highly original fugitive pieces1 – as well as a collection of songs without words. Finally his Mort d’Hercule,2 performed in concert at the Conservatoire, has an epic breadth reminiscent of Gluck, who is one of his acknowledged masters. His love of Gluck, however, does not preclude him from admiring Piccinni;3 M. Richard takes his pleasure where he finds it. While revering Piccinni, he bows to Meyerbeer, relishes Cimarosa, and no one is known to appreciate Weber4 more wholeheartedly than he does. As for Wagner, M. Richard is close to claiming that he, Firmin Richard, is the first and perhaps the only person in France who understands him.5","‘He is a most distinguished musician. Skilled in harmony, knowledgeable in counterpoint, the hallmark of his compositions is a sense of spacious grandeur. He has published chamber music which is highly thought of by devotees of the genre, a quantity of piano music—sonatas and highly original occasional pieces—plus a set of songs without words. Most notably, The Death of Hercules, performed in concerts given at the Conservatoire,* has an epic quality to it which recalls Gluck, one of Maestro Firmin Richard’s revered masters. However, though he likes Gluck, that does not mean he dislikes Piccini: his tastes are catholic. He is full of admiration for Piccini, he doffs his cap to Meyerbeer, delights in Cimarosa and is second to none in his appreciation of the inimitable genius of Weber. As to Wagner, M. Richard claims that he was the first, and perhaps remains the only person in France to have understood him…’*","Firmin Richard was a very distinguished composer, who had published a number of successful pieces of all kinds and who liked nearly every form of music and every sort of musician.

"Ils se revirent trois ans plus tard; c'étaient des jeunes gens. Ceci se passa à Perros encore et Raoul en conserva une telle impression qu'elle le poursuivit toute sa vie. Le professeur Valérius était mort, mais la maman Valérius était restée en France, où ses intérêts la retenaient avec le bonhomme Daaé et sa fille, ceux-ci toujours chantant et jouant du violon, entraînant dans leur rêve harmonieux leur chère protectrice, qui semblait ne plus vivre que de musique. Le jeune homme était venu à tout hasard à Perros et, de même, il pénétra dans la maison habitée autrefois par sa petite amie. Il vit d'abord le vieillard Daaé, qui se leva de son siège les larmes aux yeux et qui l'embrassa, en lui disant qu'ils avaient conservé de lui un fidèle souvenir. De fait, il ne s'était guère passé de jour sans que Christine ne parlât de Raoul. Le vieillard parlait encore quand la porte s'ouvrit et, charmante, empressée, la jeune fille entra, portant sur un plateau le thé fumant. Elle reconnut Raoul et déposa son fardeau. Une flamme légère se répandit sur son charmant visage. Elle demeurait hésitante, se taisait. Le papa les regardait tous deux. Raoul s'approcha de la jeune fille et l'embrassa d'un baiser qu'elle n'évita point. Elle lui posa quelques questions, s'acquitta joliment de son devoir d'hôtesse, reprit le plateau et quitta la chambre. Puis elle alla se réfugier sur un banc dans la solitude du jardin. Elle éprouvait des sentiments qui s'agitaient dans son cœur adolescent pour la première fois. Raoul vint la rejoindre et ils causèrent jusqu'au soir, dans un grand embarras. Ils étaient tout à fait changés, ne reconnaissaient point leurs personnages, qui semblaient avoir acquis une importance considérable. Ils étaient prudents comme des diplomates et ils se racontaient des choses qui n'avaient point affaire avec leurs sentiments naissants. Quand ils se quittèrent, au bord de la route, Raoul dit à Christine, en déposant un baiser correct sur sa main tremblante: «Mademoiselle, je ne vous oublierai jamais!» Et il s'en alla en regrettant cette parole hardie, car il savait bien que Christine Daaé ne pouvait pas être la femme du vicomte de Chagny.","They met again three years later; they were young people. This happened again in Perros and Raoul retained such an impression of it that she pursued it all her life. Professor Valérius was dead, but the mother Valérius had remained in France, where her interests kept her with the good man Daaé and his daughter, the latter still singing and playing the violin, carrying their dear protectress, who seemed more live than music. The young man had come by chance to Perros and, likewise, he entered the house inhabited formerly by his girlfriend. First he saw the old man Daaé, who rose from his seat with tears in his eyes and kissed him, telling him that they had preserved a faithful memory of him. In fact, hardly a day had passed without Christine speaking of Raoul. The old man was still talking when the door opened and, charming, eager, the young girl entered, carrying the steaming tea on a tray. She recognized Raoul and put down her burden. A light flame spread over her charming face. She remained hesitant, was silent. Dad looked at them both. Raoul approached the young girl and kissed her with a kiss which she did not avoid. She asked him a few questions, acquitted herself nicely of her duty as hostess, took back the tray and left the room. Then she took refuge on a bench in the solitude of the garden. She felt feelings stirring in her teenage heart for the first time. Raoul joined her and they talked until evening, in great embarrassment. They were completely changed, did not recognize their personages, who seemed to have acquired considerable importance. They were prudent like diplomats and they told each other things that had nothing to do with their budding feelings. When they parted, by the side of the road, Raoul said to Christine, placing a correct kiss on her trembling hand: ""Mademoiselle, I will never forget you!"" And he went away regretting this bold word, for he knew very well that Christine Daaé could not be the wife of the Viscount de Chagny.","When they saw each other again, three years later at Perros, they were no longer children; and their meeting made such an impression on Raoul that it remained with him for the rest of his life. By then, Professor Valerius had died, but his widow stayed in France, where she was settled, together with Daaé and his daughter. As before, they would sing and play the violin, taking their beloved benefactress along with them into their melodious world, so that she now seemed to live on music alone. Having come to Perros in the hope of finding them, Raoul entered the cottage where Christine used to stay. He first saw her father, who got to his feet with tears in his eyes and embraced him. They remembered him fondly, said the old man; in fact, hardly a day had passed without Christine mentioning his name. Daaé was still talking when the door opened and his delightful, caring daughter appeared, carrying a pot of steaming tea. She recognized Raoul and put the tray down, blushing a little at the sight of him. She stood there hesitantly and said nothing while her father gazed at the two of them. Then Raoul went up to her and gave her a kiss, which she made no attempt to resist. She asked him a few questions, graciously attended to her duties as hostess, took up the tea-tray and left the room. She went out to seek comfort in the solitude of the garden and sat on a bench. Feelings that she had never known before now stirred in her young heart. Raoul joined her and they talked until evening – with much bashfulness on both sides. They were quite changed: they hardly recognized the characters they had become and seemed to have gained stature in each other’s eyes. They were as cautious as two diplomats and their conversation did not touch on their budding sentiments. When they took leave of each other by the roadside, Raoul pressed a kiss on Christine’s trembling hand and said: ‘Mademoiselle, I shall never forget you!’ But as he went away, he regretted his bold statement, for he knew that Christine could never be the wife of the Viscount de Chagny.","They saw each other again three years later. They were now adolescents. Again, they met at Perros and the episode made a strong impression on Raoul which stayed with him for the rest of his life. Professor Valerius had died but his widow had remained in France, where she had made a life for herself, with M. Daaé and his daughter who continued to sing and play the violin. Their generous patron seemed to live solely for music, their music, for she surrendered gladly to their sweet harmonies. The young Viscount had come to Perros on the off-chance of finding them, and it was now his good fortune to be back in the house where his little friend had stayed. The first person he saw was old Daaé, who got out of his chair, embraced him tearfully, and said of course they remembered him. In fact, hardly a day had gone by when Christine had not mentioned his name. The old man was still talking when the door opened and Christine, captivating and eager, entered carrying a laden tea tray. She knew Raoul at once and put the tray down. A faint blush flickered across her pretty face. Uncertain of herself, she did not speak. The father gazed at both of them. Raoul approached her and kissed her cheek. She did not try to evade the embrace. She asked him a few questions, did her duties as hostess with aplomb, picked up the tray and left the room. She ran out into the garden and found refuge on a bench in a quiet corner. She was shaken by emotions new to her adolescent heart. Raoul joined her there and they talked until evening, very awkwardly. They were both quite changed and were disconcerted by the changes in each other which seemed to be very marked. They were as wary as diplomats and spoke of things unconnected with their new feelings. When they parted at the roadside, Raoul kissed her trembling hand and said: ‘I shall never forget you!’ Then he walked away, already regretting his boldness, for he knew that Christine Daaé could never be the wife of the Viscount de Chagny.","Three years later, Raoul and Christine met again at Perros. Professor Valérius was dead, but his widow remained in France with Daddy Daaé and his daughter, who continued to play the violin and sing, wrapping in their dream of harmony their kind patroness, who seemed henceforth to live on music alone. The young man, as he now was, had come to Perros on the chance of finding them and went straight to the house in which they used to stay. He first saw the old man; and then Christine entered, carrying the tea-tray. She flushed at the sight of Raoul, who went up to her and kissed her. She asked him a few questions, performed her duties as hostess prettily, took up the tray again and left the room. Then she ran into the garden and took refuge on a bench, a prey to feelings that stirred her young heart for the first time. Raoul followed her and they talked till the evening, very shyly. They were quite changed, cautious as two diplomatists, and told each other things that had nothing to do with their budding sentiments. When they took leave of each other by the roadside, Raoul, pressing a kiss on Christine’s trembling hand, said: “Mademoiselle, I shall never forget you!” And he went away regretting his words, for he knew that Christine could not be the wife of the Vicomte de Chagny.3"

Ainsi, il sera impossible à la vieille de communiquer avec son fantôme.

On lui disait: «Qui est cette Mort rouge?» Il répondait: «C'est un monsieur déguisé avec une tête de mort et en grand manteau rouge.» On lui dit partout qu'elle venait de passer, la Mort rouge, traînant son royal manteau, mais il ne la rencontra nulle part, et il retourna, vers deux heures du matin, dans le couloir qui, derrière la scène, conduisait à la loge de Christine Daaé.","He watched her walk away...

I took a few timid, faltering steps towards her and she did not turn away. No, no, she stayed, she waited. I even think, Daroga, she leaned forward a little – oh, not much, but a little – as if to offer me her forehead, like a living bride. And … and … I … I kissed her! I did! I kissed her!

I swear to you that there is nothing.""","Thus the few precious days flew by. By feigning excessive interest in other matters, Raoul and Christine did their self-conscious best to hide from each other the sole concern of their hearts. Nevertheless Christine, who until then had shown herself the stronger of the two, suddenly grew anxious beyond words. In the course of their wanderings, she started running for no reason; or else she would stop abruptly and her hand, suddenly turning cold, would pull the young man back. Sometimes her eyes seemed to glimpse imaginary shadows. She cried: ‘This way’, and then ‘This way’, and then again ‘ This way’, with a breathless laugh that often led to tears. It was during those moments that Raoul wanted most to speak, to question her in spite of his promises. But she forestalled his questions with a feverish: ‘Nothing! I swear it is nothing.’","And so the precious days passed. By pretending to take an excessive interest in these peripheral matters, Raoul and Christine made clumsy attempts to hide from each other the one thought in their hearts. But this much was certain: Christine, until then the stronger of the two, suddenly became very tense and apprehensive. During their ‘outings’, she would start to run for no reason, and then stop dead and reach out to hold Raoul with a hand which had gone from warm to ice in an instant. Sometimes her eyes seemed to track imaginary shadows. She would cry: ‘This way!’ then ‘That way!’ then ‘Through here!’ , all the while half laughing, half gasping and often bursting into tears. Raoul would try to say something, ask questions despite his promise not to. But before he could frame a question, she would cut him off, saying: ‘It’s nothing. I swear it’s nothing!’","The precious days sped in this way; and Raoul and Christine, by affecting excessive interest in outside matters, strove awkwardly to hide from each other the one thought of their hearts. One fact was certain, that Christine, who until then had shown herself the stronger of the two, became suddenly inexpressibly nervous. When on their expeditions, she would start running without reason or else suddenly stop; and her hand, turning ice-cold in a moment, would hold the young man back. Sometimes her eyes seemed to pursue imaginary shadows. She cried, “This way,” and “This way,” and “This way,” laughing a breathless laugh that often ended in tears. Then Raoul tried to speak, to question her, in spite of his promises. But, even before he had worded his question, she answered feverishly: “Nothing ... I swear it is nothing.”"

"Christine Daaé, victime d'intrigues sur lesquelles nous reviendrons plus tard, ne retrouva point tout de suite à l'Opéra le triomphe de la fameuse soirée de gala. Depuis, cependant, elle avait eu l'occasion de se faire entendre en ville, chez la duchesse de Zurich, où elle chanta les plus beaux morceaux de son répertoire; et voici comment le grand critique X. Y. Z., qui se trouvait parmi les invités de marque, s'exprime sur son compte:","Christine Daaé, victim of intrigues to which we will return later, did not immediately find at the Opera the triumph of the famous gala evening.

Z., who was among the distinguished guests, expresses himself on his account:","Owing to various intrigues – of which more anon – Christine Daaé did not immediately repeat her famous gala evening triumph at the Paris Opera. She had, however, occasion to sing in town at the invitation of the Duchess of Zurich, when she performed the most beautiful pieces in her repertoire. The distinguished critic X.Y.Z., who was among the honoured guests that evening, gave the following account:","CHRISTINE DAAÉ, a victim of machinations to which we shall return, did not subsequently repeat the spectacular success at the Opera that she had enjoyed on the famous night of the gala concert. She was later given an opportunity to sing at the home of the Duchess of Zurich where she performed the loveliest items in her repertoire. This is what the great critic X.Y.Z., who was among the guests of note, had to say about her:","Christine Daaé, owing to intrigues to which I will return later, did not immediately continue her triumph at the Opera. After the famous gala night, she sang once at the Duchess de Zurich’s; but this was the last occasion on which she was heard in private."

"«La Sorelli, a écrit un chroniqueur célèbre, est une danseuse grande, belle, au visage grave et voluptueux, à la taille aussi souple qu'une branche de saule; on dit communément d'elle que c'est «une belle créature». Ses cheveux blonds et purs comme l'or couronnent un front mat au-dessous duquel s'enchâssent deux yeux d'émeraude. Sa tête se balance mollement comme une aigrette sur un cou long, élégant et fier. Quand elle danse, elle a un certain mouvement de hanches indescriptible, qui donne à tout son corps un frissonnement d'ineffable langueur. Quand elle lève les bras et se penche pour commencer une pirouette, accusant ainsi tout le dessin du corsage, et que l'inclinaison du corps fait saillir la hanche de cette délicieuse femme, il paraît que c'est un tableau à se brûler la cervelle.»","“La Sorelli, wrote a famous chronicler, is a tall, beautiful dancer, with a serious and voluptuous face, with a waist as supple as a willow branch; it is commonly said of her that she is ""a beautiful creature"". Her blond hair pure as gold crowns a matte forehead below which are set two emerald eyes. Her head swings limply like an egret on a long, elegant and proud neck. When she dances, she has a certain indescribable movement of the hips, which gives her whole body a shiver of ineffable languor. When she raises her arms and bends over to start a pirouette, thus emphasizing the whole design of the bodice, and the inclination of the body makes the hip of this delicious woman protrude, it seems that it is a picture to blow your brains out. .”","‘Sorelli,’ wrote a famous critic, ‘is a tall, handsome, willow-waisted ballerina, with a grave, sensuous face, who is often described as a “classic beauty”. Emerald-green eyes sparkle in her pale face, framed by rich, golden hair. Her head sways gently, feather-like, on her long, elegant and proud neck. At times, when she dances, a particular, indescribable movement of her hips sets her whole body a-quiver with an ineffable sensuality. When she raises her arms and bends forward at the start of a pirouette, with her corsage pressed tightly to her figure and her hip bone thrust forward , she is a sight, some say, to die for.’","One famous reviewer wrote: ‘La Sorelli is tall for a ballerina, beautiful, with solemn, sensual features and a waist as supple as a willow branch. Most people reckon her to be “a fine figure of a woman”. Her hair, as yellow and fine as spun gold, frames a smooth brow under which are set emerald-green eyes. Her head on a long, elegant, haughty neck sways gently, like a feathery plume. When she dances, she moves her hips in a manner that is not to be described but her whole body quivers with unutterable voluptuousness. When she raises her arms and bends forward before launching into a pirouette, thus revealing the contours of her bosom, or when the arch of her delicious body brings out the curve of her thigh, the sight is said to be enough to make a man blow his brains out.’","And the child reverently touched the little coral finger-ring which she wore as a charm against bad luck, while Sorelli, stealthily, with the tip of her pink right thumb-nail, made a St. Andrew’s cross on the wooden ring which adorned the fourth finger of her left hand."
"Les chevaux, la voiture, le cocher, les provisions, les bagages, l'argent nécessaire, l'itinéraire,—on ne devait pas prendre le chemin de fer pour dérouter le fantôme,—tout cela l'occupa jusqu'à neuf heures du soir.","The horses, the carriage, the coachman, the provisions, the luggage, the necessary money, the itinerary—we must not take the railway to confuse the phantom—all this occupied him until nine o'clock. of the evening.","The horses, the carriage, the coachman, the provisions, the luggage, the money required for the journey, the route to be taken – they would not travel by train so as to throw the Phantom off their trail – all this occupied him until nine o’clock in the evening.","Arranging for horses, a carriage, a driver, provisions, luggage, money for the journey, planning the route—they were not going by train, to make it harder for the Phantom to follow them—kept Raoul busy until nine in the evening.","The horses, the carriage, the coachman, the provisions, the luggage, the money required for the journey, the road to be taken (he had resolved not to go by train, so as to throw the ghost off the scent): all this had to be settled and provided for; and it occupied him until nine o’clock at night."

"Car c'était les fermeurs de portes... les anciens machinistes épuisés et dont une charitable direction avait eu pitié... Elle les avait faits fermeurs de portes dans les dessous, dans les dessus. Ils allaient et venaient sans cesse du haut en bas de la scène pour fermer les portes—et ils étaient aussi appelés en ce temps-là, car depuis, je crois bien qu'ils sont tous morts: «les chasseurs de courants d'air».","Because they were the door closers... the old exhausted machinists for whom a charitable direction had taken pity... It had made them door closers below, above. They were constantly going back and forth from top to bottom of the stage to close the doors—and they were also called in those days, because I believe they have all died since: ""the chasers of drafts "".","These door-shutters were worn-out machinists, on whom a charitable management had taken pity, giving them the task of shutting doors above and below the stage. They would continually come and go, closing one door after another, and were known in those days – they are undoubtedly all dead by now – as the ‘draught-stoppers’; for any draught is very bad for the voice.","They were the ‘door-boys… superannuated former stagehands on whom humane managements had taken pity. They had employed them as door-shutters below and above the stage. They came and went throughout the building, shutting traps and doors. They were also known as in those days (I believe they are all dead now) as ‘draught snuffers’.","They were the door-shutters, the old, worn-out scene-shifters, on whom a charitable management had taken pity, giving them the job of shutting doors above and below the stage. They went about incessantly, from top to bottom of the building, shutting the doors; and they were also called “The draught-expellers,” at least at that time, for I have little doubt that by now they are all dead."
"Ses amis furent fidèles à leur promesse. Ils étaient tous, ce soir-là, à l'Opéra, mais c'est en vain qu'ils cherchèrent autour d'eux ces féroces conspirateurs qu'ils avaient mission de combattre. Si l'on en exceptait quelques profanes, quelques honnêtes bourgeois dont la figure placide ne reflétait d'autre dessein que celui de réentendre une musique qui, depuis longtemps déjà, avait conquis leurs suffrages, il n'y avait là que des habitués dont les mœurs élégantes, pacifiques et correctes, écartaient toute idée de manifestation. La seule chose qui paraissait anormale était la présence de MM. Richard et Moncharmin dans la loge n° 5. Les amis de la Carlotta pensèrent que, peut-être, messieurs les directeurs avaient eu, de leur côté, vent du scandale projeté et qu'ils avaient tenu à se rendre dans la salle pour l'arrêter sitôt qu'il éclaterait, mais c'était là une hypothèse injustifiée, comme vous le savez; MM. Richard et Moncharmin ne pensaient qu'à leur fantôme.","His friends were faithful to their promise. They were all at the Opera that evening, but it was in vain that they looked around for these ferocious conspirators whom they had been sent to combat. If we excepted a few laymen, a few honest bourgeois whose placid faces reflected no other intention than that of re-hearing music which had long since won their suffrages, there were only regulars whose elegant, peaceful and correct manners, ruled out any idea of demonstration. The only thing that seemed abnormal was the presence of MM. Richard and Moncharmin in box no. 5. Carlotta's friends thought that perhaps the directors had heard of the projected scandal on their side and that they had insisted on going to the room to hear it. 'stop as soon as it burst, but that was an unwarranted assumption, as you know; MM. Richard and Moncharmin thought only of their ghost.","Her friends kept to their promise. They were all at the Opera that night, but looked round in vain for those fierce conspirators whom they were meant to silence. Except for a few outsiders – fine, upstanding citizens whose placid faces betrayed no more than the desire to hear again music which had earned their approval long ago – they found themselves as usual among patrons whose elegant, quiet and respectable manners ruled out any possibility of a riot. Unexpectedly, however, Box Five was occupied by Messrs Richard and Moncharmin. Carlotta’s friends assumed that, having perchance heard about the planned disturbance, the directors had decided to attend so as to intervene at once if need be; but, as the reader knows, this was not the true reason for their presence. Richard and Moncharmin were thinking only of their ghost.","Her friends were as good as their word. That night, they were all at the Opera, but they looked in vain for the wild conspirators they were there to silence. With the exception of a handful of outsiders, a small number of respectable citizens with placid faces that reflected no purpose other than of listening to music which they had long approved of, the audience consisted entirely of regulars whose refined, unwarlike, civilized manners ruled out any possibility of a riot. The only unusual thing was the presence of Messrs Richard and Moncharmin in Box 5. La Carlotta ’s friends thought that maybe both Directors had caught a whiff of possible trouble and wanted to be in the auditorium to stop it as soon as it began. But that was not the real reason, as the reader knows: both Directors were thinking only of the Phantom.","Her friends were faithful to their promise. They were all at the Opera that night, but looked round in vain for the fierce conspirators whom they were instructed to suppress. The only unusual thing was the presence of M. Richard and M. Moncharmin in Box Five.

M. Richard and M. Moncharmin were thinking of nothing but their ghost."
"Et le Persan, ayant fait passer Raoul par la porte qu'il venait d'ouvrir, lui montra, en face, la loge de l'actrice.","And the Persian, having led Raoul through the door he had just opened, showed him, opposite, the actress's dressing room.","With these words, the Persian let Raoul through the door that he had just unlocked and pointed to the singer’s room across the corridor.","Ushering Raoul through the door he had just opened , the Persian gestured to her dressing room which was exactly opposite.","And the Persian, letting Raoul through the door which he had just opened, showed him the actress’ room opposite."

He said he’d been marching continuously through the jungle for three days and three nights, looking for Christine Daaé.

"Tout de même ils avaient été si parfaitement joués, qu'ils ne purent, pendant les semaines qui suivirent, surmonter un certain accablement. Et c'était, ma foi, bien compréhensible. Si le commissaire ne fut point appelé dès lors, c'est qu'il ne faut pas oublier que MM. les directeurs gardaient tout au fond d'eux-mêmes, la pensée qu'une aussi bizarre aventure pouvait n'être qu'une haïssable plaisanterie montée, sans doute, par leurs prédécesseurs et dont il convenait de ne rien divulguer avant d'en connaître «le fin mot». Cette pensée, d'autre part, se troublait par instants chez Moncharmin d'un soupçon qui lui venait relativement à Richard lui-même, lequel avait quelquefois des imaginations burlesques. Et c'est ainsi que, prêts à toutes les éventualités, ils attendirent les événements en surveillant et en faisant surveiller la mère Giry à laquelle Richard voulut qu'on ne parlât de rien. «Si elle est complice, disait-il, il y a beau temps que les billets sont loin. Mais, pour moi, ce n'est qu'une imbécile!»","All the same they had been played so perfectly that they could not, during the weeks that followed, overcome a certain depression. And that was, well, quite understandable. If the commissioner was not summoned from then on, it is because we must not forget that MM. the directors kept deep in their minds the thought that such a bizarre adventure could only be a hateful joke set up, no doubt, by their predecessors and of which nothing should be divulged before knowing about it. “the end word”. This thought, on the other hand, was disturbed at times in Moncharmin by a suspicion which came to him relative to Richard himself, who sometimes had burlesque imaginations. And so it was that, ready for all eventualities, they awaited events by watching Mother Giry and having them watched, to whom Richard wanted nothing to be said. ""If she's an accomplice,"" he said, ""the tickets have long been gone."" But, to me, she's just a fool!""","All the same, they had been so thoroughly duped that they could not help feeling somewhat dejected during the following weeks, and understandably so. The reason why the directors did not call the police was that deep down they still entertained the idea that this whole situation, strange as it might appear, was no more than a vile practical joke undoubtedly visited upon them by their predecessors. Thus they felt that it was better to keep it to themselves for the time being. Besides, Moncharmin had the faint suspicion that Richard himself, who was occasionally given to whimsical pranks, might have a hand in it. So, bracing themselves for all contingencies, they awaited further events. They had arranged to keep Mme Giry under close watch, but at Richard’s insistence she was told nothing. ‘If she’s an accomplice,’ he said, ‘the notes went long ago. But, in my opinion, she’s just an idiot.’","Even so, they’d been so completely outmanoeuvred that during the weeks that followed they were unable to throw off the feeling that they had bitten off more than they could chew. Which was all too understandable. If the Inspector hadn’t been called in at that point, it was because it must not be forgotten that the Directors kept thinking privately that the whole bizarre episode was probably no more than some nasty practical joke played on them by their predecessors about which it was best to say nothing until they had found ‘the key to the mystery’. But for Moncharmin, this policy was at times undermined by a suspicion he harboured about Richard who was himself an occasional hoaxer. And so, ready for every contingency, they waited on events, watching Mme Giry and having her watched. Richard insisted that she be kept in the dark. ‘If she is an accomplice,’ he said, ‘those banknotes are long gone. But as far as I’m concerned, she’s just a stupid woman.’","Nevertheless, they had been so absolutely tricked that they were bound to suffer a certain dejection. And, upon my word, it was not difficult to understand. We must not forget that the managers had an idea at the back of their minds, all the time, that this strange incident might be an unpleasant practical joke on the part of their predecessors and that it would not do to divulge it prematurely. On the other hand, Moncharmin was sometimes troubled with a suspicion of Richard himself, who occasionally took fanciful whims into his head. And so they were content to await events, while keeping an eye on Mother Giry. Richard would not have her spoken to. “If she is a confederate,” he said, “the notes are gone long ago. But, in my opinion, she is merely an idiot.”"
"La première chose qu'elle vit en mettant son nez à la fenêtre, fut un corbillard. Le corbillard et la lettre la persuadèrent qu'elle courait, ce soir-là, les plus sérieux dangers.

She relied on them to be ready for any eventuality and to suppress the enemy should they, as she feared, create any disturbance.","The first thing she saw when she looked out of the window was a hearse.

She summoned every last one of her admirers to her house, told them that during the evening’s performance she would face a cabal organized by Christine Daaé, and urged them to respond in kind by packing the auditorium with her, Carlotta’s, own supporters. There was no shortage of them, was there? She counted on them to be prepared for any eventuality and to drown out the hecklers if, as she feared, they made trouble.","The first thing she saw, when looking out of her window, was a hearse.

"L'humilité de ce geste me redonna quelque courage; la lumière, en précisant toute chose autour de moi, me rendit à la réalité de la vie. Si extraordinaire qu'elle apparaissait, l'aventure s'entourait maintenant de choses mortelles que je pouvais voir et toucher. Les tapisseries de ces murs, ces meubles, ces flambeaux, ces vases et jusqu'à ces fleurs dont j'eus pu dire presque d'où elles venaient, dans leurs bannettes dorées, et combien elles avaient coûté, enfermaient fatalement mon imagination dans les limites d'un salon aussi banal que bien d'autres qui avaient au moins cette excuse de n'être point situés dans les dessous de l'Opéra. J'avais sans doute affaire à quelque effroyable original qui, mystérieusement, s'était logé dans les caves, comme d'autres, par besoin, et avec la muette complicité de l'administration, avaient trouvé un définitif abri dans les combles de cette tour de Babel moderne, où l'on intriguait, où l'on chantait dans toutes les langues, où l'on aimait dans tous les patois.","The humility of this gesture gave me some courage; the light, by clarifying everything around me, brought me back to the reality of life. Extraordinary as it seemed, the adventure was now surrounded by deadly things I could see and touch. The tapestries on these walls, these pieces of furniture, these torches, these vases and even these flowers, of which I could almost tell where they came from, in their gilded baskets, and how much they had cost, inevitably locked my imagination in the limits of a room as banal as many others which had at least this excuse of not being located below the Opera. I was no doubt dealing with some frightful oddball who had mysteriously lodged in the cellars, like others, out of need, and with the mute complicity of the administration, had found a definitive shelter in the attic of this modern tower of Babel, where people intrigued, where people sang in all languages, where people loved in all patois.","In the face of such humility I felt my courage return; and thanks to the light that threw everything around me into sharp relief, I regained a keen sense of reality. However extraordinary my situation, everything around me belonged to the visible, tangible world. The wall hangings, the furniture, the candles, the vases and even those mundane flowers in golden baskets – I could almost tell which florist had made them and how much they cost – confined my imagination to the limits of this drawing-room, which was much the same as any other, save it lay beneath the Paris Opera House. ‘I thought that the masked man must surely be some wicked eccentric, who had mysteriously settled down here, just as others lodged – for want of a better place and with the silent complicity of the administration – in the attics of this modern Tower of Babel, this land of intrigue where people sang in all languages and loved in all dialects.6","‘Such respect revived my courage. By making everything so clear and bright, the light also gave me back my sense of reality. Extraordinary though it was, all that had happened now seemed part of the world of mortal, visible, palpable things. The wall hangings, the furniture, torches and vases, even the tasteless flowers in their gilt baskets —I knew exactly where they’d come from and how much they had cost —limited my imagination to a drawing room as pedestrian and unsurprising as many others, though they could never be accused of being located in the bowels of the Opera House. I was very probably dealing with some deranged eccentric who for some reason had ended up in its deepest cellars as a last resort, just as many others, with the silent complicity of the management, had made permanent homes in the attics of that modern Tower of Babel where men and women plotted and sang in many languages and loved in every tongue known to humankind.","His humility gave me back some of my courage, and the light restored me to the realities of life. However extraordinary the adventure might be, I was now surrounded by mortal, visible, tangible things. The furniture, the hangings, the candles, the vases and the very flowers in their baskets, of which I could almost have told whence they came and what they cost, were bound to confine my imagination to the limits of a drawing-room quite as commonplace as any that, at least, had the excuse of not being in the cellars of the Opera. I had, no doubt, to do with a terrible, eccentric person, who, in some mysterious fashion, had succeeded in taking up his abode there, under the Opera house, five stories below the level of the ground."

"Certes, je savais que tout cela existait, et la vision de ce lac et de cette barque sous la terre n'avait rien de surnaturel. Mais songez aux conditions exceptionnelles dans lesquelles j'abordai ce rivage. Les âmes des morts ne devaient point ressentir plus d'inquiétude en abordant le Styx. Caron n'était certainement pas plus lugubre ni plus muet que la forme d'homme qui me transporta dans la barque. L'élixir avait-il épuisé son effet? la fraîcheur de ces lieux suffisait-elle à me rendre complètement à moi-même? Mais ma torpeur s'évanouissait, et je fis quelques mouvements qui dénotaient le recommencement de ma terreur. Mon sinistre compagnon dut s'en apercevoir, car, d'un geste rapide, il congédia César qui s'enfuit dans les ténèbres de la galerie et dont j'entendis les quatre fers battre les marches sonores d'un escalier, puis l'homme se jeta dans la barque qu'il délivra de son lien de fer; il s'empara des rames et rama avec force et promptitude. Ses yeux, sous le masque, ne me quittaient pas; je sentais sur moi le poids de leurs prunelles immobiles. L'eau, autour de nous, ne faisait aucun bruit. Nous glissions dans cette lueur bleuâtre que je vous ai dite et puis nous fûmes à nouveau tout à fait dans la nuit, et nous abordâmes. La barque heurta un corps dur. Et je fus encore emportée dans des bras. J'avais recouvré la force de crier. Je hurlai. Et puis, tout à coup, je me tus, assommée par la lumière. Oui, une lumière éclatante, au milieu de laquelle on m'avait déposée. Je me relevai, d'un bond. J'avais toutes mes forces. Au centre d'un salon qui ne me semblait paré, orné, meublé que de fleurs, de fleurs magnifiques et stupides à cause de rubans de soie qui les liaient à des corbeilles, comme on en vend dans les boutiques des boulevards, de fleurs trop civilisées comme celles que j'avais coutume de trouver dans ma loge après chaque «première»; au centre de cet embaumement très parisien, la forme noire d'homme au masque se tenait debout, les bras croisés... et elle parla:","Certainly, I knew that all this existed, and the vision of this lake and this boat under the ground had nothing supernatural about it. But think of the exceptional conditions in which I approached this shore. The souls of the dead should not feel more uneasiness on approaching the Styx. Caron was certainly no more lugubrious nor more mute than the shape of the man who transported me in the boat. Had the elixir exhausted its effect? Was the coolness of these places enough to bring me back completely to myself? But my torpor vanished, and I made a few movements which denoted the renewal of my terror. My sinister companion must have noticed it, for, with a quick gesture, he dismissed César, who fled into the darkness of the gallery and whose four irons I heard beat the sonorous steps of a staircase, then the man threw himself into the boat which he freed from its iron bond; he seized the oars and rowed with strength and speed. His eyes, under the mask, never left me; I felt the weight of their motionless pupils on me. The water around us made no sound. We slipped into that bluish light that I told you about and then we were again completely in the dark, and we landed. The boat hit a hard body. And I was again carried away in arms. I had regained the strength to scream. I screamed. And then, suddenly, I fell silent, stunned by the light. Yes, a dazzling light, in the middle of which I had been placed. I jumped up. I had all my strength. In the center of a living room which seemed to me adorned, adorned, furnished only with flowers, flowers which were magnificent and stupid because of the silk ribbons which tied them to baskets, such as are sold in the shops on the boulevards, flowers too civilized like the ones I used to find in my dressing room after each ""premiere""; in the center of this very Parisian embalming, the black form of a man in a mask was standing, his arms crossed... and he spoke:","‘There was nothing supernatural about the underground lake or the boat – I had already heard talk of these. But consider for a moment, Raoul, the exceptional circumstances by which I arrived upon that shore! The souls of the dead surely did not feel greater anguish upon reaching the River Styx, nor did Charon appear more doleful,5 more silent than the black figure now carrying me into the boat. Had the effects of the drug worn off? Or was the coolness of the air enough to revive me? My torpor was lifting and so my terror returned. My sinister companion must have noticed my restlessness for he swiftly sent César back with a single wave of his hand. I watched the horse vanish into the darkness of the gallery and heard its hooves ringing up the steps of a staircase while my escort quickly leaped into the boat and untied it. He took up the oars and rowed with relentless determination. His eyes, under the mask, never left me and I felt the weight of his still gaze upon me. The waters all around us were silent. We glided along in the pale blue light, and then we were plunged into utter darkness again. The boat bumped against something and, once more, I felt arms lifting me. Having regained enough strength, I screamed once more. But then I stopped suddenly, dazed by the light – the blinding light in the midst of which he had just set me down. I sprang to my feet, all my strength returned. I found myself in the middle of a drawing-room, which seemed to be decorated, adorned and furnished with nothing but flowers, flowers both magnificent and absurd because they were tied by silk ribbons to baskets like those sold in the shops on the boulevards. These stylish arrangements resembled the ones I used to find in my dressing-room after a first night. And, in the midst of this all too Parisian setting, stood, with arms crossed, the dark figure of the man in the mask. ‘ “Don’t be afraid, Christine,” he said.","‘Of course, I knew it was all real, that there was nothing supernatural about the sight of the underground lake and the boat. But remember for a moment the exceptional circumstances which had brought me to that shore. The souls of the dead as they reached the Styx never felt greater trepidation than I did! Charon himself * was not more grim or silent than the black figure which ferried me in that boat. Had the effect of the drug worn off? Had the coolness of the place been enough to restore me to myself? But my torpor evaporated, sensation returned and with it my terror. My ghostly captor noticed for, with a quick gesture, he dismissed Caesar who ran off into the darkness of the gallery where I heard his iron shoes clatter on echoing steps. Then the man jumped into the boat which he untied from its mooring ring. He took the oars and rowed with rapid, powerful strokes. Under the mask his eyes never left me and I felt their still gaze like a physical weight on me. The water made no noise around us. We glided through the bluish glow and then we were again swallowed up by the dark as we reached the shore. The boat struck solid ground. Again I was carried in his arms. By now I had regained enough strength to scream. And then, I stopped, dazed by light, a brilliant light which suddenly illuminated my surroundings. * I leaped to my feet. I felt strong again. I was in the middle of a drawing room which I thought at first was furnished and decorated with nothing but flowers. They were magnificent but also vulgar, for they were tied by silk ribbons in baskets like the ones they sell in shops on the Boulevards, hothouse blooms like those I used to find in my dressing room after every first night. In the middle of this fragrant, very Parisian setting the dark figure of the man in the mask stood with his arms folded. It spoke:","“Yes, but I knew that all that existed and that there was nothing supernatural about that underground lake and boat. But think of the exceptional conditions in which I arrived upon that shore!3 I don’t know whether the effect of the cordial had worn off when the man’s shape lifted me into the boat, but my terror began all over again. My gruesome escort must have noticed it, for he sent César back and I heard his hoofs trampling up a staircase while the man jumped into the boat, untied the rope that held it and seized the oars. He rowed with a quick, powerful stroke; and his eyes, under the mask, never left me. We slipped across the noiseless water in the bluey light which I told you of; then we were in the dark again and we touched shore. And I was once more taken up in the man’s arms. I cried aloud. And then, suddenly, I was silent, dazed by the light ... Yes, a dazzling light in the midst of which I had been put down. I sprang to my feet. I was in the middle of a drawing-room that seemed to me to be decorated, adorned and furnished with nothing but flowers, flowers both magnificent and stupid, because of the silk ribbons that tied them to baskets, like those which they sell in the shops on the boulevards. They were much too civilized flowers, like those which I used to find in my dressing-room after a first night. And, in the midst of all these flowers, stood the black shape of the man in the mask, with arms crossed, and he said, ‘Don’t be afraid, Christine; you are in no danger.’"

"Ainsi, ils arrivèrent aux toits. Elle glissait sur eux, légère et familière, comme une hirondelle. Leur regard, entre les trois dômes et le fronton triangulaire, parcourut l'espace désert. Elle respira avec force, au-dessus de Paris dont on découvrait toute la vallée en travail. Elle regarda Raoul avec confiance. Elle l'appela tout près d'elle, et côte à côte ils marchèrent, tout là-haut, sur les rues de zinc, dans les avenues en fonte; ils mirèrent leur forme jumelle dans les vastes réservoirs pleins d'une eau immobile où, dans la bonne saison, les gamins de la danse, une vingtaine de petits garçons plongent et apprennent à nager. L'ombre derrière eux, toujours fidèle à leurs pas, avait surgi, s'aplatissant sur les toits, s'allongeant avec des mouvements d'ailes noires, aux carrefours des ruelles de fer, tournant autour des bassins, contournant, silencieuse, les dômes; et les malheureux enfants ne se doutèrent point de sa présence, quand ils s'assirent enfin, confiants, sous la haute protection d'Apollon, qui dressait de son geste de bronze, sa prodigieuse lyre, au cœur d'un ciel en feu.","Thus, they arrived at the roofs. She glided over them, light and familiar, like a swallow. Their gaze, between the three domes and the triangular pediment, traveled the deserted space. She breathed hard, above Paris, the whole valley of which was seen in labour. She looked at Raoul with confidence. She called him close to her, and side by side they walked, up there, on the streets of zinc, in the avenues of cast iron; they reflected their twin form in the vast reservoirs full of still water where, in the right season, the kids at the dance, about twenty little boys dive and learn to swim. The shadow behind them, always faithful to their steps, had arisen, flattening itself on the roofs, lengthening with the movements of black wings, at the crossroads of the iron alleys, turning around the basins, circumventing, silent, the domes; and the unfortunate children had no idea of his presence, when they sat down at last, confident, under the high protection of Apollo, who raised with his bronze gesture his prodigious lyre in the heart of a sky on fire.","Thus they reached the roof. Light and easy, Christine glided over it like a swallow. Their eyes surveyed the open view between the three domes and the triangular pediment. Christine took a long, deep breath as she stood high above the city and gazed down at the busy valleys beneath her. She looked at Raoul confidently. She called him to her side, and together they took a walk along streets made of zinc and avenues cast in iron; they watched their twin reflections in the still water of the huge tanks1 into which, in the summer months, a score of little boys from the ballet school jumped and learned to swim. The shadow that had followed them still clung to their heels, lying low on the roof, reaching with its black wings over the metal crossroads, stealing by the tanks, skirting silently round the domes; but the trusting young lovers suspected nothing when at last they sat down under the mighty protection of Apollo thrusting his monumental lyre against the crimson sky with bronze grandeur.2","THEN they were outside, on the roof. Christine moved easily, with practised steps, as light as a swallow. They looked through the empty spaces between the three low domes and the triangular pediment. She breathed deeply as she gazed out over Paris which nestled in a valley grimly steeped in toil. She looked trustingly at Raoul, told him to come closer, and arm in arm they strolled along lead-paved streets and down iron avenues. They paraded their twin reflections in the great tanks of standing water where youngsters from the beginners’ class, a score of little boys, splash about and learn to swim in the summer months. The shadow behind them, still dogging their steps, had emerged too, flattening itself against roofs, growing longer each time it flapped its black wings where iron roads met, skirting the cisterns, silently circling the domes. The hapless couple never suspected it was there when they sat down, feeling safe at last under the high protection of Apollo who raised his mighty bronze lyre to a sky filled with crimson fire.","In this way, they reached the roof. Christine tripped over it as lightly as a swallow. Their eyes swept the empty space between the three domes and the triangular pediment. She breathed freely over Paris, the whole valley of which was seen at work below. She called Raoul to come quite close to her and they walked side by side along the zinc streets, in the leaden avenues ; they looked at their twin shapes in the huge tanks, full of stagnant watery1 where, in the hot weather, the little boys of the ballet, a score or so, learn to swim and dive. The shadow had followed behind them, clinging to their steps; and the two children little suspected its presence when they at last sat down, trustingly, under the mighty protection of Apollo, who, with a great bronze gesture, lifted his huge lyre to the heart of a crimson sky."
"Le comte de Chagny (Philippe-Georges-Marie) avait alors exactement quarante et un ans. C'était un grand seigneur et un bel homme.

His two sisters and his brother Raoul did not want to hear talk of partition, and they remained in joint ownership, leaving everything to Philippe, as if the right of primogeniture had not ceased to exist.

"Il apprit que Christine venait de monter dans sa chambre et qu'elle avait annoncé qu'elle ne descendrait pas pour dîner. Le jeune homme demanda si elle n'était point malade. La brave aubergiste lui répondit d'une façon ambiguë que, si elle était souffrante, ce devait être d'un mal qui n'était point bien grave, et, comme elle croyait à la fâcherie de deux amoureux, elle s'éloigna en haussant les épaules et en exprimant sournoisement la pitié qu'elle avait pour des jeunes gens, qui gaspillaient en vaines querelles les heures que le bon Dieu leur a permis de passer sur la terre. Raoul dîna tout seul, au coin de l'âtre et, comme vous pensez bien, de façon fort maussade. Puis, dans sa chambre, il essaya de lire, puis, dans son lit, il essaya dé dormir. Aucun bruit ne se faisait entendre dans l'appartement à côté. Que faisait Christine? Dormait-elle? Et si elle ne dormait point, à quoi pensait-elle? Et lui, à quoi pensait-il? Eût-il été seulement capable de le dire? La conversation étrange qu'il avait eue avec Christine l'avait tout à fait troublé!... Il pensait moins à Christine qu'autour de Christine, et cet «autour» était si diffus, si nébuleux, si insaisissable, qu'il en éprouvait un très curieux et très angoissant malaise.","He learned that Christine had just gone up to his room and that she had announced that she would not be coming down for dinner. The young man asked if she was ill. The brave innkeeper answered him in an ambiguous way that if she was unwell, it must be from an ailment that was not very serious, and, as she believed in the anger of two lovers, she went away, raising her voice. her shoulders and slyly expressing the pity she felt for young people, who wasted in vain quarrels the hours that the good Lord allowed them to spend on earth. Raoul dined alone, at the corner of the hearth and, as you can well imagine, in a very sullen way. Then, in his room, he tried to read, then, in his bed, he tried to sleep. No noise was heard in the apartment next door. What was Christine doing? Was she sleeping? And if she wasn't sleeping, what was she thinking? And he, what was he thinking? Would he have even been able to say it? The strange conversation he had had with Christine had completely disturbed him!... He was thinking less of Christine than of Christine, and this ""around"" was so diffuse, so nebulous, so elusive, that he felt a very curious and very agonizing uneasiness.","He learned that Christine had just retired to her room saying that she would not be down for dinner. The young man enquired if she was unwell from Mme Tricard, who replied ambiguously that if the young lady was sick, her sickness could not be very serious. Putting the whole thing down to a lovers’ tiff, she walked away, shrugging her shoulders and muttering that it was a pity that young people should vainly waste the hours the Good Lord had given them on this earth. Raoul dined alone next to the fireplace and, as the reader might imagine, in a melancholy mood. Finally he went up to his room, where he tried to read; then to bed, where he tried to sleep. He did not hear a sound from the adjoining room. What was Christine doing? Was she asleep? And if she was awake, what was she thinking? And what about him? What was he thinking? Could he even tell? His bizarre conversation with Christine had thoroughly unsettled him. He was thinking less about Christine herself than about her situation, which seemed to him so vague, so hazy and so elusive that he felt a strange unease and anguish.","He was told that Christine had gone up to her room saying that she would not be down for dinner. Raoul enquired if she was unwell. Mme Tricard answered ambiguously that if she was it couldn’t be anything very serious, and then, convinced the fuss was just a lovers’ tiff, she strode off with a shrug of her shoulders muttering that it was a shame that these young people were wasting time on silly quarrels which the good Lord had given them here below to enjoy themselves. Raoul dined alone, by the fire, and, as you will imagine, feeling very sorry for himself. Later, in his room, he tried to read. Later still, he went to bed and tried to sleep. No sound came from the room next door. What was Christine doing? Was she asleep? And if not, what was she thinking about? And what was he thinking about? Would he have been capable of saying? The strange conversation he’d had with Christine had disturbed him deeply!… He thought less of Christine than around her, and ‘around’ was a concept so diffuse, so nebulous, so elusive, that it made him oddly and painfully uneasy.","He was told that Christine had gone to her bedroom saying that she would not be down to dinner. Raoul dined alone, in a very gloomy mood. Then he went to his room and tried to read, went to bed and tried to sleep. There was no sound in the next room. The hours passed slowly. It was about half-past eleven when he distinctly heard some one moving, with a light, stealthy step, in the room next to his."

Je ne fus point mécontent de l'entendre parler ainsi. Il n'avait pas dit un mot de la forêt et j'espérai que la raison de mon compagnon pourrait lutter assez longtemps encore contre le supplice. Mais il ajouta:,"I was not displeased to hear him speak thus. He hadn't said a word about the forest, and I hoped that my companion's reason could struggle long enough against the torture. But he added:","I was not sorry to hear him speak thus. He had not referred to the forest, which gave me hope that his reason might still hold out against the torture for a time. But he added: ‘What consoles me is that Christine has until eleven o’clock tomorrow evening.",I wasn’t unhappy to hear him talk like that. He hadn’t said one word about the jungle and this made me hope that his mind could hold out for a little longer. But then he added:,I was not sorry to hear him talk like this. He had not said a word of the forest and I hoped that my companion’s reason would hold out some time longer against the torture. But he added:

And then I took the gun from him... and then I dragged myself on my knees until I had seen.,"But, as I stared at the Punjab cord, I saw something which caused me to start so violently that the Viscount stopped in his tracks even as he murmured: ‘Adieu, Christine …’ I grabbed his arm, took the pistol from him, and then crawled towards what I had seen.",I grabbed his arm and took the pistol from him… then I crawled on all fours towards what I had seen…,I took his arm.

"—Comment pouvez-vous, Christine, parler aussi légèrement de choses aussi graves? Nous ne nous reverrons peut-être jamais plus!... Je puis mourir pendant cette expédition!...","""How can you, Christine, speak so lightly of such serious matters?"" We may never see each other again!...

"Sa douleur n'en avait fait que grandir, et il finit par s'inquiéter de ne voir la chanteuse sur aucun programme. On donna Faust sans elle. Un après-midi, vers cinq heures, il fut s'enquérir auprès de la direction des causes de cette disparition de Christine Daaé. Il trouva des directeurs fort préoccupés. Leurs amis eux-mêmes ne les reconnaissaient plus: ils avaient perdu toute joie et tout entrain. On les voyait traverser le théâtre, tête basse, le front soucieux, et les joues pâles comme s'ils étaient poursuivis par quelque abominable pensée, ou en proie à quelque malice du destin qui vous prend son homme et ne le lâche plus.","His pain had only grown, and he ended up worrying about not seeing the singer on any program. Faust was given without her. One afternoon, around five o'clock, he went to inquire with the management of the causes of this disappearance of Christine Daaé. He found directors very preoccupied. Even their friends no longer recognized them: they had lost all joy and enthusiasm. You could see them crossing the theatre, heads lowered, worried brows, and pale cheeks, as if they were pursued by some abominable thought, or a prey to some malice of fate which takes its man from you and never lets go.","These uncertainties added to his grief and he eventually became quite concerned when her name never appeared on any programme. Even Faust was performed without her. At about five o’clock one afternoon, he went into the directors’ office to enquire about Christine and found Messrs Richard and Moncharmin both extremely anxious. Even their own friends did not recognize them: their cheerfulness and high spirits had gone. They were seen crossing the stage, heads down, brows knitted with worry and looking pale, as if they were being pursued by terrible thoughts or prey to some malicious fate.","But his heartache had continued to grow and eventually he became seriously concerned when her name failed to appear in the cast of any production. Faust was staged without her. One afternoon, at about five o’clock, he called on the Directors to ask why Christine Daaé had vanished without trace. Both men were now looking very worried. Even their friends no longer recognized them. They had lost all their zest and optimism. They could be seen walking around the Opera House, heads bowed, brows furrowed and pale-faced, as if they were haunted by some terrible thought or were the victims of the kind of malignant fate which attaches itself to a man and never lets him go.","His grief increased and he ended by being seriously alarmed at never seeing her name on the programme. Faust was played without her. One afternoon he went to the managers’ office to ask the reason of Christine’s disappearance. He found them both looking extremely worried.

"Seulement, écoute bien, daroga, comme vous criiez comme des possédés à cause de l'eau, Christine est venue à moi, ses beaux grands yeux bleus ouverts et elle m'a juré, sur son salut éternel, qu'elle consentait à être ma femme vivante! Jusqu'alors, dans le fond de ses yeux, daroga, j'avais toujours vu ma femme morte; c'était la première fois que j'y voyais ma femme vivante. Elle était sincère, sur son salut éternel.

She would not kill herself. Bargain. Half a minute later, all the waters had returned to the Lake, and I stuck out your tongue, daroga, because I really believed, my word, that you would stay there!... Finally!... Here!

Within moments, all the water had drained back into the lake; but I struggled to revive you, Daroga. In fact, I thought you were done for! But you lived! I had agreed to take you back up above ground.

I was to take you back to your apartment on the surface. When I’d got shot of you out of the Louis-Philippe salon, I went back there alone.’","Only, mark me, daroga, when you were yelling like the devil, because of the water, Christine came to me with her beautiful blue eyes wide open, and swore to me, as she hoped to be saved, that she consented to be my living wife! ...

When the narrow tube was upended, the falling pebbles hit the pins and bounced off one another, making a sound that imitated perfectly the patter of heavy rain.3","And then came the most unbearable torture of all: we heard rain but it did not rain! This was a truly diabolical invention… Of course, I knew how Erik made that sound too! He filled a long, narrow box with small stones.

As the stones dropped, they hit the vanes, cascaded from one to the next, and made a pattering sound indistinguishable from the pelting rain of a storm!","Lastly—and this was the most pitiless torture of all—we heard the rain and it was not raining! This was an infernal invention ... Oh, I knew well enough how Erik obtained it! He filled with little stones a very long and narrow box, broken up inside with wooden and metal projections.

I witnessed, devastated, panting, pitiful and defeated, the hatching of these gigantic chords where Pain was deified climb the sky as the eagle soars to the sun, and such a triumphal symphony seemed to set the world ablaze that I understood that the work was finally accomplished and that Ugliness, lifted on the wings of Love, had dared to look the Beauty!

Stunned, breathless, abject, beaten, I listened to that explosion of gigantic chords which made suffering divine. Then unexpectedly the notes rising up out of the abyss gathered themselves into one single, monumental menacing flight, into a turning, gyring swarm that took off into the heavens as the eagle soars towards the sun, and a triumphant concatenation of sounds seemed to set the world on fire.
