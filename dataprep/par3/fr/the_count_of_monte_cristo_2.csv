"—C'était donc à Caderousse que je comptais demander asile; mais, comme d'habitude, et même dans les circonstances ordinaires, nous n'entrions pas chez lui par la porte qui donnait sur la route, je résolus de ne pas déroger à cette coutume, j'enjambai la haie du jardin, je me glissai en rampant à travers les oliviers rabougris et les figuiers sauvages, et je gagnai, dans la crainte que Caderousse n'eût quelque voyageur dans son auberge, une espèce de soupente dans laquelle plus d'une fois j'avais passé la nuit aussi bien que dans le meilleur lit. Cette soupente n'était séparée de la salle commune du rez-de-chaussée de l'auberge que par une cloison en planches dans laquelle des jours avaient été ménagés à notre intention, afin que de là nous pussions guetter le moment opportun de faire reconnaître que nous étions dans le voisinage. Je comptais, si Caderousse était seul, le prévenir de mon arrivée, achever chez lui le repas interrompu par l'apparition des douaniers, et profiter de l'orage qui se préparait pour regagner les bords du Rhône et m'assurer de ce qu'étaient devenus la barque et ceux qui la montaient.

This loft was separated from the common room on the ground floor of the inn only by a partition made of planks in which openings had been made for our intention, so that from there we could wait for the opportune moment to recognize that we were in the neighborhood. I counted, if Caderousse was alone, to let him know of my arrival, to finish the meal at his place, interrupted by the appearance of the customs officers, and to take advantage of the storm which was brewing to return to the banks of the Rhône and make sure that had become the boat and those who rode it.

This hutch or cupboard was only separated from the main parlour on the ground floor of the inn by a wooden wall, in which holes had been drilled for us, so that we could wait there until the time was ripe for us to reveal our presence. If Caderousse was alone, I intended to announce my arrival to him, finish at this table the meal that had been interrupted by the arrival of the Customs men and take advantage of the coming storm to return to the banks of the Rhône and find out what had become of the ship and those on board. So I slipped into the hutch – and it was as well that I did so, because at that very moment Caderousse was returning home with a stranger.","""It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not to break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might have some guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed the night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence. My intention was, if Caderousse was alone, to acquaint him with my presence, finish the meal the custom-house officers had interrupted, and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhone, and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew.

Mais le démon de la spéculation ayant tiré une ligne, c'est-à-dire une rue à l'extrémité de ce potager, et la rue, avant d'exister, ayant déjà grâce à une plaque de fer bruni, reçu un nom, on pensa pouvoir vendre ce potager pour bâtir sur la rue, et faire concurrence à cette grande artère de Paris qu'on appelle le faubourg Saint-Honoré.","This grandiose entrance is doomed, despite the magnificent geraniums which grow in the two vases and sway their mottled leaves and purple flowers in the wind, since the owners of the hotel, and this is a long time ago, restricted themselves to possession of the hotel, of the courtyard planted with trees which overlooks the suburb, and of the garden enclosed by this gate, which formerly overlooked a magnificent kitchen garden of an acre annexed to the property. But the demon of speculation having drawn a line, that is to say a street at the end of this kitchen garden, and the street, before existing, having already, thanks to a plate of burnished iron, received a name , we thought we could sell this vegetable garden to build on the street, and compete with this great artery of Paris called the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.","Despite the splendid geraniums growing in the two vases which tossed their marbled leaves and purple flowers in the wind, this grandiose entrance had been condemned since the time – and it was some time earlier – when the owners of the mansion confined themselves to possession of the house itself, the tree-lined courtyard opening into the Faubourg and the garden behind the gateway we have mentioned, which formerly gave access to a magnificent vegetable garden, an acre in size, adjoining the property. But the demon of speculation drew a line, in the form of a street, along the side of the vegetable garden; the street, before it even existed except as a line, received a name, thanks to a polished-iron plaque; and someone had the idea that the vegetable garden could be sold for buildings along the street, to compete with the major Parisian thoroughfare called the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.","This noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom, had fallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself, with its thickly planted court-yard, opening into the Faubourg Saint-Honore, and to the garden shut in by this gate, which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of about an acre. For the demon of speculation drew a line, or in other words projected a street, at the farther side of the kitchen-garden. The street was laid out, a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate, but before construction was begun, it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables, by building along the line of the proposed street, and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg Saint-Honore itself, one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of Paris."

"Ce qui annonçait l’extrême habileté de l’intendant et la profonde science du maître, l’un pour servir, l’autre pour se faire servir, c’est que cette maison, déserte depuis vingt années, si sombre et si triste encore la veille, tout imprégnée qu’elle était de cette fade odeur qu’on pourrait appeler l’odeur du temps, avait pris en un jour, avec l’aspect de la vie, les parfums que préférait le maître, et jusqu’au degré de son jour favori; c’est que le comte, en arrivant, avait là, sous sa main, ses livres et ses armes; sous ses yeux ses tableaux préférés; dans les antichambres les chiens dont il aimait les caresses, les oiseaux dont il aimait le chant; c’est que toute cette maison, réveillée de son long sommeil, comme le palais de la Belle au bois dormant, vivait, chantait, s’épanouissait, pareille à ces maisons que nous avons depuis longtemps chéries, et dans lesquelles, lorsque par malheur nous les quittons, nous laissons involontairement une partie de notre âme.","What announced the extreme skill of the steward and the profound science of the master, one to serve, the other to be served, is that this house, deserted for twenty years, still so dark and so sad the day before, impregnated as it was with that insipid odor which one might call the odor of time, had taken on in one day, with the appearance of life, the perfumes which the master preferred, and to the degree of his favorite day; it is that the count, on arriving, had there, under his hand, his books and his weapons; before his eyes his favorite paintings; in the antechambers the dogs whose caresses he loved, the birds whose song he loved; it is that this whole house, awakened from its long slumber, like the palace of Sleeping Beauty, lived, sang, flourished, like those houses which we have long cherished, and in which, when by misfortune we leave them, we involuntarily leave a part of our soul.","In all, this house, which had been empty for twenty-five years and only the day before had been dark and gloomy, impregnated with what might be called the aroma of time, had in a single day recovered an appearance of life, full of the master’s favourite perfumes and even his preferred amount of daylight: nothing could better have illustrated the steward’s skill and his master’s understanding – the first, in what was needed to serve, the latter in what was needed to be served. When he came in, the count found his books and his weapons to hand, and his favourite paintings before his eyes. In the antechambers were the dogs it pleased him to stroke and the birds it pleased him to hear sing. Like the Sleeping Beauty’s castle, the whole house had been awakened from its long sleep and come to life; it sang and blossomed like one of those houses that we have long cherished and in which, when we are unfortunate enough to leave them, we involuntarily relinquish a part of our souls.","What, above all, manifested the shrewdness of the steward, and the profound science of the master, the one in carrying out the ideas of the other, was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy, impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time, had in a single day acquired the aspect of life, was scented with its master's favorite perfumes, and had the very light regulated according to his wish. When the count arrived, he had under his touch his books and arms, his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures; his dogs, whose caresses he loved, welcomed him in the ante-chamber; the birds, whose songs delighted him, cheered him with their music; and the house, awakened from its long sleep, like the sleeping beauty in the wood, lived, sang, and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished, and in which, when we are forced to leave them, we leave a part of our souls."

"—Oh! s'il eût été à moi, répondit Bertuccio, s'il eût été mon fils, ou tout au moins mon neveu, je l'eusse bien ramené au droit sentier, car la conscience donne la force.

Je donnai de bons conseils à ma sœur, qui, dans nos discussions, prenait sans cesse la défense du petit malheureux, et comme elle m'avoua que plusieurs fois des sommes assez considérables lui avaient manqué, je lui indiquai un endroit où elle pouvait cacher notre petit trésor. Quant à moi, ma résolution était prise. Benedetto savait parfaitement lire, écrire et compter, car lorsqu'il voulait s'adonner par hasard au travail, il apprenait en un jour ce que les autres apprenaient en une semaine.

Ce plan arrêté, je partis pour la France.","-Oh! if he had been mine, replied Bertuccio, if he had been my son, or at least my nephew, I would have brought him back to the right path, for conscience gives strength. But the idea that I was going to beat a child whose father I had killed made any correction impossible. I gave good advice to my sister, who, in our discussions, constantly took up the defense of the unfortunate little boy, and as she confessed to me that several times considerable sums of money had failed her, I pointed out to her a place where she could hide our little treasure. As for me, my resolution was taken. Benedetto knew how to read, write and count perfectly, because when he wanted to devote himself to work by chance, he learned in a day what the others learned in a week. My resolution, I say, was taken; I was to engage him as secretary on some ocean-going vessel, and, without warning him of anything, have him picked up one fine morning and carried on board; in this way, and recommending him to the captain, his whole future depended on him. This plan settled, I left for France.","Monte Cristo muttered. ‘Oh, if he had been mine,’ Bertuccio replied, ‘if he had been my own son, or at least my nephew, I should soon have brought him back to the straight and narrow, because a clean conscience gives a man strength.

I gave good advice to my sister, who always took the miserable child’s side whenever we talked about him and, since she confessed to me that she had several times lost quite large sums of money, I showed her a place where she could hide our little fortune. For my part, I had made up my mind what to do. Benedetto knew very well how to read, write and do sums, because when he happened to want to work he could learn in one day what took another child a week. As I said, my mind was made up. I would sign him on as secretary on some ocean-going ship and, without giving him any advance warning, have him picked up one fine morning and carried on board. In this way, if I recommended him to the captain, he would be entirely responsible for his own future. Having taken this decision, I set off for France.","""Sweet child,"" murmured Monte Cristo. ""Oh, had he been my own son,"" replied Bertuccio, ""or even my nephew, I would have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was striking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me to punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the unfortunate boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was already made up. Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the fit seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week.

On y pend, on y décapite et l'on y empale très agréablement les criminels; mais ceux-ci en fraudeurs adroits, ont su dépister la justice humaine et assurer le succès de leurs entreprises par des combinaisons habiles. Chez nous, un niais possédé du démon de la haine ou de la cupidité, qui a un ennemi à détruire ou un grand-parent à annihiler, s'en va chez un épicier, lui donne un faux nom qui le fait découvrir bien mieux que son nom véritable, et achète, sous prétexte que les rats l'empêchent de dormir, cinq à six grammes d'arsenic; s'il est très adroit, il va chez cinq ou six épiciers, et n'en est que cinq ou six fois mieux reconnu; puis, quand il possède son spécifique, il administre à son ennemi, à son grand-parent, une dose d'arsenic qui ferait crever un mammouth ou un mastodonte, et qui, sans rime ni raison, fait pousser à la victime des hurlements qui mettent tout le quartier en émoi. Alors arrive une nuée d'agents de police et de gendarmes, on envoie chercher un médecin qui ouvre le mort et récolte dans son estomac et dans ses entrailles l'arsenic à la cuiller. Le lendemain, cent journaux racontent le fait avec le nom de la victime et du meurtrier. Dès le soir même, l'épicier ou les épiciers vient ou viennent dire: «C'est moi qui ai vendu l'arsenic à monsieur.» Et plutôt que de ne pas reconnaître l'acquéreur, ils en reconnaîtront vingt; alors le niais criminel est pris, emprisonné, interrogé, confronté, confondu, condamné et guillotiné; ou si c'est une femme de quelque valeur, on l'enferme pour la vie. Voilà comme vos Septentrionaux entendent la chimie, madame. Desrues cependant était plus fort que cela, je dois l'avouer.","—No, madam, the fantastic no longer exists even in the East: there are also there, disguised under other names and hidden under other costumes, police commissioners, examining magistrates, prosecutors. of the king and the experts. Criminals are hanged, beheaded and impaled there very pleasantly; but the latter, as adroit fraudsters, knew how to track down human justice and ensure the success of their enterprises by skilful combinations. With us, a simpleton possessed by the demon of hatred or greed, who has an enemy to destroy or a grandparent to annihilate, goes to a grocer, gives him a false name which makes him discover much better than his real name, and buys, on the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, five or six grammes of arsenic; if he is very skilful, he goes to five or six grocers, and is only five or six times better recognized; then, when he possesses his specific, he administers to his enemy, his grandparent, a dose of arsenic which would kill a mammoth or a mastodon, and which, without rhyme or reason, makes the victim scream stir up the whole neighborhood. Then a swarm of police and gendarmes arrives, a doctor is sent to cut open the dead man and collect arsenic from his stomach and entrails with a spoon. The next day, a hundred newspapers tell the story with the name of the victim and the murderer. That very evening, the grocer or grocers came or came to say: “It was I who sold the arsenic to Monsieur.” And rather than not recognizing the purchaser, they will recognize twenty of them; then the stupid criminal is caught, imprisoned, interrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned and guillotined; or if she is a woman of any value, she is locked up for life. This is how your Northerners understand chemistry, Madame. Desrues however was stronger than that, I must admit.","‘No, Madame, the marvellous no longer exists even in the East.

In our country, when some fool is seized with the demon of hatred or greed, when he has an enemy to destroy or a grandparent to obliterate, he goes to a grocer, gives a false name (that will identify him more surely than his real one) and, pretending that the rats are keeping him awake, he buys five or six grammes of arsenic. If he is very clever, he goes to five or six grocers, so he will be five or six times more easily detected. Then, once he has his medicine, he administers a dose of arsenic to his enemy or his grandparent that would kill a mammoth or a mastodon, and this, without rhyme or reason, causes the victim to emit cries that put the whole district into a turmoil. At that, a crowd of policemen and gendarmes arrives. They send for a doctor who cuts the dead man open and takes arsenic by the spoonful out of his stomach and his entrails. The next day, a hundred newspapers report the matter with the name of the victim and the murderer. The very same evening, the grocer – or grocers – come and announce: “I sold this gentleman the arsenic.” They would identify twenty purchasers, rather than not identify this one. So the foolish criminal is caught, imprisoned, interrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned and guillotined. Or, if it is a woman of some status, then she is sentenced to life imprisonment.

Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose of, goes straight to the grocer's or druggist's, gives a false name, which leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or six grammes of arsenic — if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced; — then, when he has acquired his specific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which, without rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood.

And then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country, and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind , I besought him to receive my confession, under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil affair in all its details, as well as every other transaction of my life.

"«Je viens d'être miraculeusement sauvée avec mon fils par ce même comte de Monte-Cristo dont nous avons tant parlé hier soir, et que j'étais loin de me douter que je verrais aujourd'hui. Hier vous m'avez parlé de lui avec un enthousiasme que je n'ai pu m'empêcher de railler de toute la force de mon pauvre petit esprit, mais aujourd'hui je trouve cet enthousiasme bien au-dessous de l'homme qui l'inspirait. Vos chevaux s'étaient emportés au Ranelagh comme s'ils eussent été pris de frénésie, et nous allions probablement être mis en morceaux, mon pauvre Édouard et moi, contre le premier arbre de la route ou la première borne du village, quand un Arabe, un Nègre, un Nubien, un homme noir enfin, au service du comte, a, sur un signe de lui, je crois, arrêté l'élan des chevaux, au risque d'être brisé lui-même, et c'est vraiment un miracle qu'il ne l'ait pas été. Alors le comte est accouru, nous a emportés chez lui, Édouard et moi, et là a rappelé mon fils à la vie. C'est dans sa propre voiture que j'ai été ramenée à l'hôtel; la vôtre vous sera renvoyée demain. Vous trouverez vos chevaux bien affaiblis depuis cet accident; ils sont comme hébétés; on dirait qu'ils ne peuvent se pardonner à eux-mêmes de s'être laissé dompter par un homme. Le comte m'a chargée de vous dire que deux jours de repos sur la litière et de l'orge pour toute nourriture les remettront dans un état aussi florissant, ce qui veut dire aussi effrayant qu'hier.","“I have just been miraculously saved with my son by this same Count of Monte Cristo about whom we talked so much last night, and whom I had no idea I would see today. Yesterday you spoke to me of him with an enthusiasm which I could not help mocking with all the strength of my poor little mind, but today I find that enthusiasm far below the man who inspired. Your horses had gone wild at the Ranelagh as if they had been seized with a frenzy, and we were probably going to be torn to pieces, my poor Edouard and I, against the first tree in the road or the first milestone in the village, when an Arab , a Negro, a Nubian, a black man finally, in the service of the count, has, on a sign from him, I believe, stopped the rush of the horses, at the risk of being broken himself, and it is really a miracle he wasn't. So the Count came running, took us home, Edouard and me, and there called my son back to life. It was in his own car that I was brought back to the hotel; yours will be sent back to you tomorrow. You will find your horses much weakened since this accident; they are dazed; it looks like they can't forgive themselves for letting themselves be tamed by a man. The Count has told me to tell you that two days rest on the litter and barley for all food will restore them to as flourishing a state, which is to say as frightening as yesterday.","I have just been miraculously saved, together with my son, by that same Count of Monte Cristo about whom we spoke so much yesterday evening, but whom I never thought I should see today. Yesterday you spoke to me of him with such enthusiasm that it took all the strength of my feeble spirit to refrain from mockery, but today I find your enthusiasm falls well below the man who inspired it. On reaching the Ranelagh,3 your horses bolted as if touched by madness and we should probably have been dashed to pieces, poor Edouard and I, against the first tree on the road or the first village signpost, when an Arab, a Negro, a Nubian, in short, a black man, one of the count’s servants, I believe, at a sign from the count, stopped the horses in their tracks, though at the risk of being run down himself; indeed, it is a miracle that he was not. The count ran out and had us carried into his house, Edouard and me, where he brought my son back to life. I returned home in his own carriage; yours will be sent back to you tomorrow. You will find your horses much enfeebled after the accident. It is as though they were stunned: one would think they could not forgive themselves for having been tamed by a man. The count asks me to tell you that two days’ rest on straw and no food except barley will restore them to as healthy – that is to say, as terrifying – a state as before.","Dear Hermine, — I have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo we were talking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see to-day. I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits. Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they darted forward like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate, that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress, when a strange-looking man, — an Arab, a negro, or a Nubian, at least a black of some nation or other — at a signal from the count, whose domestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals, even at the risk of being trampled to death himself; and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape. The count then hastened to us, and took us into his house, where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to life. He sent us home in his own carriage. Yours will be returned to you to-morrow. You will find your horses in bad condition, from the results of this accident; they seem thoroughly stupefied, as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man. The count, however, his commissioned me to assure you that two or three days' rest, with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time, will bring them back to as fine, that is as terrifying, a condition as they were in yesterday."

Mais comme Lord Wilmore, en sa qualité d’ennemi du comte de Monte-Cristo, n’y mettait pas la même retenue que l’abbé, elles furent beaucoup plus étendues; il raconta la jeunesse de Monte-Cristo, qui, selon lui, était, à l’âge de dix ans, entré au service d’un de ces petits souverains de l’Inde qui font la guerre aux Anglais; c’est là qu’il l’avait, lui Wilmore, rencontré pour la première fois, et qu’ils avaient combattu l’un contre l’autre. Dans cette guerre, Zaccone avait été fait prisonnier, avait été envoyé en Angleterre, mis sur les pontons, d’où il s’était enfui à la nage. Alors avaient commencé ses voyages, ses duels, ses passions; alors était arrivée l’insurrection de Grèce, il avait servi dans les rangs des Grecs. Tandis qu’il était à leur service, il avait découvert une mine d’argent dans les montagnes de la Thessalie, mais il s’était bien gardé de parler de cette découverte à personne. Après Navarin, et lorsque le gouvernement grec fut consolidé, il demanda au roi Othon un privilège d’exploitation pour cette mine, ce privilège lui fut accordé. De là cette fortune immense qui pouvait, selon Lord Wilmore monter à un ou deux millions de revenu, fortune qui néanmoins, pouvait tarir tout à coup, si la mine elle-même tarissait.","They were more or less the same as those addressed to Father Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in his capacity as an enemy of the Count of Monte Cristo, did not exercise the same restraint as the abbot, they were much more extensive; he related the youth of Monte Cristo, who, according to him, had, at the age of ten, entered the service of one of those petty sovereigns of India who make war on the English; there he had first met him, Wilmore, and they had fought against each other. In this war, Zaccone had been taken prisoner, had been sent to England, put on the pontoons, whence he had escaped by swimming. Then had begun his travels, his duels, his passions; then had come the insurrection of Greece, he had served in the ranks of the Greeks. While in their service, he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly, but he was careful not to tell anyone about this discovery. After Navarino, and when the Greek government was consolidated, he asked King Othon for a privilege to operate this mine, this privilege was granted to him. Hence this immense fortune which could, according to Lord Wilmore, amount to one or two millions in income, a fortune which nevertheless could dry up suddenly, if the mine itself dried up.","The questions were roughly the same as those that had been asked of Abbé Busoni; but since Lord Wilmore, an enemy of the Count of Monte Cristo, did not show the same discretion as the abbé, his answers were much fuller. He described the count’s youth, saying that as a boy of ten he had entered into the service of one of those Indian princelings who make war against the English: this is where he and Lord Wilmore met for the first time and fought one another. In the course of the war, Zaccone was taken prisoner, sent to England and put in the hulks, from which he escaped by jumping into the water. This was the start of his journeys, his duels, his love affairs. When the Greeks rebelled, he fought for them against the Turks and, while in their service, discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly, about which he was careful to tell no one. When the Greek government was consolidated after the Battle of Navarino, he asked King Otto2 for a licence to exploit the mine, which was granted. Hence the vast fortune which, according to Lord Wilmore, might yield an income of two million, but which would at the same time dry up overnight, if the mine itself were to do so.","Then began the questions, which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abbe Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of the count's enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more numerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten years of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of India who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had escaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices; then the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the Grecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from every one. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was consolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district, which was given him. Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord Wilmore's opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum, — a precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine."

"—Eh mon Dieu, oui, un télégraphe. J’ai vu parfois au bout d’un chemin, sur un tertre, par un beau soleil, se lever ces bras noirs et pliants pareils aux pattes d’un immense coléoptère, et jamais ce ne fut sans émotion, je vous jure, car je pensais que ces signes bizarres fendant l’air avec précision, et portant à trois cents lieues la volonté inconnue d’un homme assis devant une table, à un autre homme assis à l’extrémité de la ligne devant une autre table, se dessinaient sur le gris du nuage ou sur l’azur du ciel, par la seule force du vouloir de ce chef tout-puissant: je croyais alors aux génies, aux sylphes, aux gnomes, aux pouvoirs occultes enfin, et je riais. Or, jamais l’envie ne m’était venue de voir de près ces gros insectes au ventre blanc, aux pattes noires et maigres, car je craignais de trouver sous leurs ailes de pierre le petit génie humain, bien gourmé, bien pédant, bien bourré de science, de cabale ou de sorcellerie. Mais voilà qu’un beau matin j’ai appris que le moteur de chaque télégraphe était un pauvre diable d’employé à douze cents francs par an, occupé tout le jour à regarder, non pas le ciel comme l’astronome, non pas l’eau comme le pêcheur, non pas le paysage comme un cerveau vide, mais bien l’insecte au ventre blanc, aux pattes noires, son correspondant, placé à quelque quatre ou cinq lieues de lui. Alors je me suis senti pris d’un désir curieux de voir de près cette chrysalide vivante et d’assister à la comédie que du fond de sa coque elle donne à cette autre chrysalide, en tirant les uns après les autres quelques bouts de ficelle.","“Oh my God, yes, a telegraph. I have sometimes seen at the end of a path, on a hillock, by a beautiful sun, these black arms rising and folding like the legs of an immense beetle, and it was never without emotion, I swear to you, because I thought that these bizarre signs cutting through the air with precision, and carrying three hundred leagues the unknown will of a man seated in front of a table, to another man seated at the end of the line in front of another table, were taking shape on the gray of the cloud or on the azure of the sky, by the sheer force of the will of this all-powerful leader: I then believed in genies, sylphs, gnomes, in short, in occult powers, and I laughed. Now, I had never wanted to see these big insects up close with their white bellies, their black, skinny legs, for I was afraid of finding under their stone wings the little human genius, well curvy, very pedantic, well stuffed with science, cabal or sorcery. But then one fine morning I learned that the engine of each telegraph was a poor devil of a clerk at twelve hundred francs a year, busy all day watching, not the sky like the astronomer, not the sky. water like the fisherman, not the landscape like an empty brain, but the insect with the white belly, the black legs, his correspondent, placed some four or five leagues from him. So I felt seized with a curious desire to see this living chrysalis up close and to witness the comedy that from the bottom of its shell it gives to this other chrysalis, pulling a few bits of string one after the other.","‘Yes, indeed, the very thing: a telegraph. Often, at the end of a road, on a hilltop, in the sunshine, I have seen those folding black arms extended like the legs of some giant beetle, and I promise you, never have I contemplated them without emotion, thinking that those bizarre signals so accurately travelling through the air, carrying the unknown wishes of a man sitting behind one table to another man sitting at the far end of the line behind another table, three hundred leagues away, were written against the greyness of the clouds or the blue of the sky by the sole will of that all-powerful master. Then I have thought of genies, sylphs, gnomes and other occult forces, and laughed. Never did I wish to go over and examine these great insects with their white bellies and slender black legs, because I was afraid that under their stone wings I would find the human genie, cramped, pedantic, stuffed with arcane science and sorcery. Then, one fine morning, I discovered that the motor that drives every telegraph is a poor devil of a clerk who earns twelve hundred francs a year and – instead of watching the sky like an astronomer, or the water like a fisherman, or the landscape like an idler – spends the whole day staring at the insect with the white belly and black legs that corresponds to his own and is sited some four or five leagues away. At this, I became curious to study this living chrysalis from close up and to watch the dumbshow that it offers from the bottom of its shell to that other chrysalis, by pulling bits of string one after the other.’","""Yes, a telegraph. I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message. I began to think of genii, sylphs, gnomes, in short, of all the ministers of the occult sciences, until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination. Now, it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects, with their long black claws, for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals, factions, and government intrigues. But one fine day I learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the heavens like an astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler, or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him, but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied, black-clawed fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him. At length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely, and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect-actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string."""

"Du côté de l'hôtel, les marronniers dont nous avons parlé couronnent la muraille, ce qui n'empêche pas d'autres arbres luxuriants et fleuris de glisser dans leurs intervalles leurs branches avides d'air. À un angle où le feuillage devient tellement touffu qu'à peine si la lumière y pénètre, un large banc de pierre et des sièges de jardin indiquent un lieu de réunion ou une retraite favorite à quelque habitant de l'hôtel situé à cent pas, et que l'on aperçoit à peine à travers le rempart de verdure qui l'enveloppe. Enfin, le choix de cet asile mystérieux est à la fois justifié par l'absence du soleil, par la fraîcheur éternelle même pendant les jours les plus brûlants de l'été, par le gazouillement des oiseaux et par l'éloignement de la maison et de la rue, c'est-à-dire des affaires et du bruit.","On the side of the hotel, the chestnut trees of which we have spoken crown the wall, which does not prevent other luxuriant and flowering trees from slipping their air-greedy branches into their intervals. At a corner where the foliage becomes so dense that hardly any light penetrates it, a broad stone bench and garden chairs indicate a meeting place or a favorite retreat for some inhabitant of the hotel a hundred paces away, and which one hardly sees through the rampart of greenery which envelops it. Finally, the choice of this mysterious asylum is justified at the same time by the absence of the sun, by the eternal freshness even during the hottest days of summer, by the chirping of the birds and by the distance from the house and from the street, i.e. business and noise.","On the side nearest to the mansion, the chestnut-trees which we mentioned crown the wall, though this does not prevent other luxuriantly flowering rivals from insinuating their branches between them in search of air. At a corner where the growth is so thick that the light can hardly penetrate, a wide stone bench and some garden seats mark a meeting place or favourite retreat of an inhabitant of the large house, which can hardly be seen through the protective wall of greenery around this spot, even though it is only a hundred yards away. Apart from that, the position of this mysterious shelter could have been dictated by: the absence of sun, giving a permanent chill to the air, on even the hottest summer days; the singing of the birds; and the distance from the house and from the street, that is to say from bustle and noise.","Towards the house the chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall, without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one corner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred paces off. Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion."

"—Et je la tiendrai, dit Morcerf; mais je crains bien que vous ne soyez fort désenchanté, mon cher comte, vous, habitué aux sites accidentés, aux événements pittoresques, aux fantastiques horizons. Chez nous, pas le moindre épisode du genre de ceux auxquels votre vie aventureuse vous a habitué. Notre Chimborazzo, c'est Montmartre; notre Himalaya, c'est le mont Valérien; notre Grand-Désert, c'est la plaine de Grenelle, encore y perce-t-on un puits artésien pour que les caravanes y trouvent de l'eau. Nous avons des voleurs, beaucoup même, quoique nous n'en ayons pas autant qu'on le dit, mais ces voleurs redoutent infiniment davantage le plus petit mouchard que le plus grand seigneur; enfin, la France est un pays si prosaïque, et Paris une ville si fort civilisée, que vous ne trouverez pas, en cherchant dans nos quatre-vingt-cinq départements, je dis quatre-vingt-cinq départements, car, bien entendu, j'excepte la Corse de la France, que vous ne trouverez pas dans nos quatre-vingt-cinq départements la moindre montagne sur laquelle il n'y ait un télégraphe, et la moindre grotte un peu noire dans laquelle un commissaire de police n'ait fait poser un bec de gaz. Il n'y a donc qu'un seul service que je puisse vous rendre, mon cher comte, et pour celui-là je me mets à votre disposition: vous présenter partout, ou vous faire présenter par mes amis, cela va sans dire. D'ailleurs, vous n'avez besoin de personne pour cela; avec votre nom, votre fortune et votre esprit (Monte-Cristo s'inclina avec un sourire légèrement ironique), on se présente partout soi-même, et l'on est bien reçu partout. Je ne peux donc en réalité vous être bon qu'à une chose. Si quelque habitude de la vie parisienne quelque expérience du confortable, quelque connaissance de nos bazars peuvent me recommander à vous, je me mets à votre disposition pour vous trouver une maison convenable. Je n'ose vous proposer de partager mon logement comme j'ai partagé le vôtre à Rome, moi qui ne professe pas l'égoïsme, mais qui suis égoïste par excellence; car chez moi, excepté moi, il ne tiendrait pas une ombre, à moins que cette ombre ne fût celle d'une femme.","""And I will keep it,"" said Morcerf; but I fear that you are very disenchanted, my dear count, you, accustomed to rugged sites, to picturesque events, to fantastic horizons. With us, not the slightest episode of the kind to which your adventurous life has accustomed you. Our Chimborazzo is Montmartre; our Himalayas are Mount Valerian; our Grand-Désert is the plain of Grenelle, and an artesian well is drilled there so that the caravans can find water there. We have thieves, many even, although we don't have as many as they say, but these thieves dread the smallest informer infinitely more than the greatest lord; finally, France is such a prosaic country, and Paris such a highly civilized city, that you will not find, by looking in our eighty-five departments, I say eighty-five departments, because, of course, I except Corsica of France, which you will not find in our eighty-five departments the least mountain on which there is not a telegraph, and the least somewhat dark cave in which a police commissioner has not put in a gaslight. There is therefore only one service that I can render you, my dear Count, and for that I place myself at your disposal: to introduce you everywhere, or to have you introduced by my friends, that goes without saying. Besides, you don't need anyone for that; with your name, your fortune and your wit (Monte-Cristo bowed with a slightly ironic smile), one presents oneself everywhere, and one is well received everywhere. So I can really only be good to you for one thing. If some habit of Parisian life, some experience of comfort, some knowledge of our bazaars can recommend me to you, I put myself at your disposal to find you a suitable house. I dare not suggest that you share my accommodation as I shared yours in Rome, I who do not profess selfishness, but who am selfish par excellence; for with me, except me, there would not hold a shadow, unless that shadow were that of a woman.","‘I shall keep it,’ said Morcerf. ‘But I am afraid that you will be very disappointed, my dear Count, accustomed as you are to mountainous terrain, picturesque events and fabulous horizons. Here, you will encounter not the slightest excitement of the kind to which your adventurous life has accustomed you. Our Chimborazzo is Montmartre, our Himalayas, the Mont Valérien, and our Great Desert, the Plaine de Grenelle: indeed, they are digging an artesian well there, for the caravans to have water. We do have thieves, quite a few as it happens, though not as many as people say; but these thieves fear the meanest copper’s nark infinitely more than they do the greatest peer of the realm. Finally, France is such a prosaic country and Paris such a highly civilized city that in all our eighty-five départements1 – I say eighty-five, because of course I do not count Corsica as a part of France – in all our eighty-five départements you will not find the smallest mountain without its telegraph or a single cave with the least blackness inside it, in which some police commissioner has not put a gaslight. So, my dear Count, there is only one service that I can perform for you, and I am entirely at your disposal: it goes without saying that I shall introduce you everywhere, or have you introduced by my friends. In any case, you have no need of that: your name, your fortune and your wit’ (Monte Cristo bowed with a faintly ironic smile) ‘will mean that you can present yourself anywhere with no further introduction, and be well received. In reality, there is only one way in which I can serve you. If my experience of Parisian life and its comforts, or my acquaintance with the market, may recommend me to you, then I am at your disposal to find you a suitable house. I would not dare to offer to let you share my lodgings as I shared yours in Rome – I who do not profess egoism but am a perfect egoist; for here there is no room to house even a shadow apart from myself, unless it were the shadow of a woman.’","""I will keep it,"" returned Morcerf; ""but I fear that you will be much disappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons.

We have plenty of thieves, though not so many as is said; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord. France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a city, that you will not find in its eighty-five departments — I say eighty-five, because I do not include Corsica — you will not find, then, in these eighty-five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp.

"—Oh! répliqua Morcerf en rougissant un peu, j'ai quitté le service, monsieur. Nommé pair sous la Restauration, j'étais de la première campagne, et je servais sous les ordres du maréchal de Bourmont; je pouvais donc prétendre à un commandement supérieur, et qui sait ce qui fût arrivé si la branche aînée fût restée sur le trône! Mais la révolution de Juillet était, à ce qu'il paraît, assez glorieuse pour se permettre d'être ingrate; elle le fut pour tout service qui ne datait pas de la période impériale; je donnai donc ma démission, car, lorsqu'on a gagné ses épaulettes sur le champ de bataille, on ne sait guère manœuvrer sur le terrain glissant des salons; j'ai quitté l'épée, je me suis jeté dans la politique, je me voue à l'industrie, j'étudie les arts utiles. Pendant les vingt années que j'étais resté au service, j'en avais bien eu le désir, mais je n'en avais pas eu le temps.","-Oh! replied Morcerf, blushing a little, I have left the service, sir. Appointed a peer under the Restoration, I was from the first campaign, and I served under the orders of Marshal de Bourmont; I could therefore claim a higher command, and who knows what would have happened if the elder branch had remained on the throne! But the July Revolution was, it seems, glorious enough to allow itself to be ungrateful; it was for any service that did not date from the imperial period; I therefore handed in my resignation, for when one has earned one's epaulets on the battlefield, one hardly knows how to maneuver on the slippery ground of salons; I left the sword, I threw myself into politics, I devote myself to industry, I study the useful arts. During the twenty years that I had remained in the service, I had had the desire to do so, but I had not had the time.","‘Oh!’ Morcerf exclaimed, blushing slightly. ‘I have left the service, Monsieur. I was given my peerage under the Restoration and served under Maréchal de Bourmont. For that reason, I might have hoped for some higher command: who knows what would have happened if the senior branch of the royal family had remained on the throne! But it seems that the July Revolution was glorious enough to afford ingratitude: it behaved thus to all whose service did not date back to the empire. So I resigned because, when a man has won his epaulettes on the battlefield, he does not know how to manoeuvre on the slippery surface of a drawing-room. I put down my sword and devoted myself to politics, to industry; I studied the useful arts. I had wanted to do that during my twenty years’ service to my country, but I did not have time.’","""Oh,"" replied Morcerf, reddening slightly, ""I have left the service, monsieur.

""I will not admit that word,"" returned the young man; ""it is at once cruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to time, Valentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere — have I not obeyed?

I have many of them. If this affair were to come out, it would be a triumph that would make them leap for joy and cover me with shame. Forgive me these base thoughts.

Si mon front est sévère c’est que bien des malheurs l’ont assombri, si mon cœur s’est pétrifié, c’est afin de pouvoir supporter les chocs qu’il a reçus. Je n’étais pas ainsi dans ma jeunesse, je n’étais pas ainsi ce soir des fiançailles où nous étions tous assis autour d’une table de la rue du Cours à Marseille. Mais, depuis, tout a bien changé en moi et autour de moi; ma vie s’est usée à poursuivre des choses difficiles et à briser dans les difficultés ceux qui, volontairement ou involontairement, par leur libre arbitre ou par le hasard, se trouvaient placés sur mon chemin pour me susciter ces choses. Il est rare que ce qu’on désire ardemment ne soit pas défendu ardemment par ceux de qui on veut l’obtenir ou auxquels on tente de l’arracher. Ainsi, la plupart des mauvaises actions des hommes sont venues au-devant d’eux, déguisées sous la forme spécieuse de la nécessité; puis, la mauvaise action commise dans un moment d’exaltation, de crainte et de délire, on voit qu’on aurait pu passer auprès d’elle en l’évitant. Le moyen qu’il eût été bon d’employer, qu’on n’a pas vu, aveugle qu’on était, se présente à vos yeux facile et simple; vous vous dites: Comment n’ai-je pas fait cela au lieu de faire cela? Vous, mesdames, au contraire, bien rarement vous êtes tourmentées par des remords, car bien rarement la décision vient de vous, vos malheurs vous sont presque toujours imposés, vos fautes sont presque toujours le crime des autres.","“Madame,” replied Villefort, “you know me; I am not a hypocrite, or at least I am not being hypocritical for no reason.

It is rare that what we ardently desire is not ardently defended by those from whom we want to obtain it or from whom we try to wrest it. Thus most of men's evil deeds have come before them, disguised under the specious form of necessity; then, the bad action committed in a moment of exaltation, fear and delirium, we see that we could have passed near it by avoiding it. The method which it would have been good to employ, which we did not see, blind as we were, presents itself to your eyes easy and simple; you say to yourself: How did I not do this instead of doing this? You, ladies, on the contrary, very rarely are tormented by remorse, because very rarely the decision comes from you, your misfortunes are almost always imposed on you, your faults are almost always the crime of others.","‘Madame,’ Villefort replied, ‘you know me. I am not a hypocrite – or, at least, I never dissemble without some purpose. My brow may be forbidding, but that is because it is darkened by many misfortunes; my heart may be stone, but it needs must be to withstand the blows that have assailed it. I was not like this in my youth, I was not like this at the betrothal feast in Marseille when we all sat at a table in the Rue du Cours. Since then, much has changed, both around me and within me. My life has been worn away in the pursuit of difficult things and in breaking down those who, voluntarily or otherwise, of their own free will or as a result of chance, stood in my way and raised such obstacles. It is rare to feel an ardent desire for something and not find that it is ardently defended by those from whom one would like to take it or seize it. So, most ill deeds present themselves to their perpetrators in the specious guise of necessity; then, when the deed has been committed – in a moment of passion, fear or delirium – one realizes that it might have been avoided. Blind as you were, you did not see the correct course of action, which now appears plainly and simply before you. You think: how can I have done that, instead of this? You ladies, on the other hand, are rarely tormented by remorse, because the decision rarely comes from you. Your misfortunes are almost always imposed on you and your errors almost always another’s crime.’","""Madame,"" replied Villefort, ""you know that I am no hypocrite, or, at least, that I never deceive without a reason. If my brow be severe, it is because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be petrified, it is that it might sustain the blows it has received. I was not so in my youth , I was not so on the night of the betrothal, when we were all seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles. But since then everything has changed in and about me; I am accustomed to brave difficulties, and, in the conflict to crush those who, by their own free will, or by chance, voluntarily or involuntarily, interfere with me in my career. It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it, or from whom we attempt to snatch it. Thus, the greater number of a man's errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity; then, after error has been committed in a moment of excitement, of delirium, or of fear, we see that we might have avoided and escaped it. The means we might have used, which we in our blindness could not see, then seem simple and easy, and we say, `Why did I not do this, instead of that?' Women, on the contrary, are rarely tormented with remorse; for the decision does not come from you, — your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you, and your faults the results of others' crimes."""

Au moment où elle se débat dans les convulsions de l'agonie, un vautour passe (il y a beaucoup de vautours dans le pays d'Adelmonte), celui-là fond sur le cadavre, l'emporte sur un rocher et en dîne. Trois jours après, le pauvre vautour, qui, depuis ce repas, s'est trouvé constamment indisposé, se sent pris d'un étourdissement au plus haut de la nue; il roule dans le vide et vient tomber lourdement dans votre vivier; le brochet, l'anguille et la murène mangent goulûment, vous savez cela, ils mordent le vautour.... Eh bien, supposez que le lendemain l'on serve sur votre table cette anguille, ce brochet ou cette murène, empoisonnés à la quatrième génération, votre convive, lui, sera empoisonné à la cinquième et mourra au bout de huit ou dix jours de douleurs d'entrailles, de maux de cœur, d'abcès au pylore. On fera l'autopsie, et les médecins diront: «Le sujet est mort d'une tumeur au foie ou d'une fièvre typhoïde.»","""Yes, I'll give you just one. He had a very beautiful garden full of vegetables, flowers and fruits; among these vegetables, he chose the most honest of all, a cabbage, for example. For three days he watered this cabbage with a solution of arsenic; on the third day the cabbage got sick and turned yellow, it was time to cut it; for all he appeared mature and preserved his honest appearance: for the Abbé Adelmonte alone he was poisoned. So he would bring the cabbage home, get a rabbit—Father Adelmonte had a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea pigs that was no match for his collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruits—l Abbé Adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a cabbage leaf, the rabbit died. What is the examining magistrate who would dare to find fault with this, and what is the king's prosecutor who has ever thought of drawing up an indictment against M. Magendie or M. Flourens on the subject of rabbits, guinea pigs? and cats they killed? Any. So here is the dead rabbit without justice worrying about it. This dead rabbit, Abbé Adelmonte has his cook empty it and throws the intestines on a dunghill. On this manure, there is a hen, she pecks these intestines, falls ill in her turn and dies the next day. At the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of agony, a vulture passes (there are many vultures in the country of Adelmonte), this one swoops down on the corpse, carries it off on a rock and dines on it. Three days later, the poor vulture, who since that meal has found himself constantly indisposed, feels dizzy at the height of the sky; it rolls in a vacuum and comes to fall heavily into your fish tank; the pike, the eel and the moray eat greedily, you know that, they bite the vulture.... Well, suppose that the next day this eel, this pike or this moray, poisoned with fourth generation, your guest will be poisoned in the fifth and will die after eight or ten days of pains in the bowels, heartaches, abscess in the pylorus. They'll do the autopsy, and the doctors say, ""Subject died of liver tumor or typhoid fever.""","‘Yes. Let me give you just one example. He had a splendid garden, full of vegetables, flowers and fruit. From among his vegetables he would choose the least exotic, most digestible of all: say, a cabbage. For three days he would water this cabbage with a solution of arsenic. On the third day, the cabbage would fall sick and wither: this was the moment to cut it. Everyone saw it as ripe and healthy, only Abbé Adelmonte knew it was poisoned. So he took the cabbage home, got a rabbit – he had a collection of rabbits, cats and guineapigs as magnificent as his collection of vegetables, flowers and fruit – and made the rabbit eat a leaf of the cabbage. The rabbit died. What investigating magistrate would dare question this; what crown prosecutor would ever draw up a petition against Monsieur Magendie or Monsieur Flourens6 for the rabbits, guinea-pigs and cats that they have killed? Not one. So the rabbit is now dead, and the law has no reason to ask questions about it. Abbé Adelmonte gets his cook to gut the rabbit and throws the intestines on a dungheap. On the dungheap there is a hen, which pecks at the intestines, falls ill in its turn and dies the following day. Just as it is in its final, convulsive agony, a vulture flies past – there are a lot of vultures in Adelmonte’s country – dives at the body and carries it off to a distant crag to eat it. Three days later the poor vulture, having felt constantly ill since its meal, is seized with a fainting fit several hundred feet up. It falls out of the sky and plummets into your fishpond. Pikes, eels and moray eels are greedy fish, as you know, so they bite the vulture. Well, suppose that on the following day this eel or this pike is served up at your table, poisoned at four removes, and your guest is poisoned at the fifth and dies after a week or ten days from a pain in the guts, vomiting and an abscess on the duodenum. There will be a post-mortem and the doctors will say: “The patient died of a tumour on the liver, or of typhoid fever.” ’","""Yes; I will mention one to you. He had a remarkably fine garden, full of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. From amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple — a cabbage, for instance. For three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow. At that moment he cut it. In the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its wholesome appearance. It was only poisoned to the Abbe Adelmonte. He then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits — for the Abbe Adelmonte had a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as fine as his collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Well, the Abbe Adelmonte took a rabbit, and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage. The rabbit died. What magistrate would find, or even venture to insinuate, anything against this? What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against M. Magendie or M. Flourens, in consequence of the rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs they have killed? — not one. So, then, the rabbit dies, and justice takes no notice. This rabbit dead, the Abbe Adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill; on this dunghill is a hen, who, pecking these intestines, is in her turn taken ill, and dies next day. At the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death, a vulture is flying by (there are a good many vultures in Adelmonte's country); this bird darts on the dead fowl, and carries it away to a rock, where it dines off its prey. Three days afterwards, this poor vulture, which has been very much indisposed since that dinner, suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds, and falls heavily into a fish-pond. The pike, eels, and carp eat greedily always, as everybody knows — well, they feast on the vulture. Now suppose that next day, one of these eels, or pike, or carp, poisoned at the fourth remove, is served up at your table. Well, then, your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove, and die, at the end of eight or ten days, of pains in the intestines, sickness, or abscess of the pylorus. The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning, `The subject has died of a tumor on the liver, or of typhoid fever!'"""

"—Eh! madame, ceci est un scrupule qui doit naturellement naître dans une âme honnête comme la vôtre, mais qui en serait bientôt déraciné par le raisonnement. Le mauvais côté de la pensée humaine sera toujours résumé par ce paradoxe de Jean-Jacques Rousseau, vous savez: «Le mandarin qu'on tue à cinq mille lieues en levant le bout du doigt.» La vie de l'homme se passe à faire de ces choses-là, et son intelligence s'épuise à les rêver. Vous trouvez fort peu de gens qui s'en aillent brutalement planter un couteau dans le cœur de leur semblable ou qui administrent, pour le faire disparaître de la surface du globe, cette quantité d'arsenic que nous disions tout à l'heure. C'est là réellement une excentricité ou une bêtise. Pour en arriver là, il faut que le sang se chauffe à trente-six degrés, que le pouls batte à quatre-vingt-dix pulsations, et que l'âme sorte de ses limites ordinaires; mais si, passant, comme cela se pratique en philologie, du mot au synonyme mitigé, vous faites une simple élimination; au lieu de commettre un ignoble assassinat, si vous écartez purement et simplement de votre chemin celui qui vous gêne, et cela sans choc, sans violence, sans l'appareil de ces souffrances, qui, devenant un supplice, font de la victime un martyr, et de celui qui agit un carnifex dans toute la force du mot; s'il n'y a ni sang, ni hurlements, ni contorsions, ni surtout cette horrible et compromettante instantanéité de l'accomplissement, alors vous échappez au coup de la loi humaine qui vous dit: «Ne trouble pas la société!» Voilà comment procèdent et réussissent les gens d'Orient, personnages graves et flegmatiques, qui s'inquiètent peu des questions de temps dans les conjonctures d'une certaine importance.","—Hey! madam, this is a scruple which must naturally arise in an honest soul like yours, but which would soon be uprooted by reasoning. The bad side of human thought will always be summed up by this paradox of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, you know: ""The mandarin who is killed five thousand leagues away by raising the tip of his finger."" Man's life is spent doing these things, and his intelligence is exhausted in dreaming them. You find very few people who go and brutally stick a knife in the heart of their fellow man or who administer, to make it disappear from the surface of the globe, this quantity of arsenic that we were talking about earlier. This is really an eccentricity or a stupidity. To arrive there, it is necessary that the blood be warmed to thirty-six degrees, that the pulse beats at ninety pulsations, and that the soul goes beyond its ordinary limits; but if, passing, as is done in philology, from the word to the mitigated synonym, you make a simple elimination; instead of committing an ignoble assassination, if you purely and simply remove from your path the one who embarrasses you, and that without shock, without violence, without the device of these sufferings, which, becoming a torture, make the victim a martyr , and of him that acts a carnifex in the full force of the word; if there is no blood, no screams, no contortions, and above all that horrible and compromising immediacy of accomplishment, then you escape the blow of the human law which tells you: ""Do not disturb society!"" This is how the people of the East proceed and succeed, serious and phlegmatic characters, who worry little about questions of time in conjunctures of a certain importance.","‘Ah, Madame, such scruples would naturally arise in a soul as honest as yours, but might soon be eradicated by reasoning. The worse side of human thought will always be summed up in that paradox of Jean-Jacques Rousseau7 – you know the one: “ The mandarin whom one can kill from a distance of five hundred leagues just by raising a finger”. Man’s life is spent doing such things and his intelligence is exhausted in dreaming about them. You will find very few people who would go, brutally, and stick a knife in the heart of their fellow man or who, to make him disappear off the face of the earth, would administer the amount of arsenic that we mentioned a short time ago. That is really either eccentricity or stupidity. One can only reach that point if the blood is heated up to thirty-six degrees, the pulse is racing at ninety beats a minute and the mind is driven outside its ordinary limits. But if, as though advancing like a philologist from a word to its near synonym, you make a mere “elimination”… Instead of committing a base murder, you purely and simply remove from your path the person who bothers you, without any clash, or violence, or all that paraphernalia of suffering which, becoming a torment, makes the victim into a martyr and the person responsible into a butcher, in the full force of the word… If there is no blood, no cries, no contortions and, above all, none of that horrible and compromising instantaneousness of the event, then you will evade the weight of the human law that tells you: “Don’t upset the social order!” This is what Orientals do and that is how they succeed: serious and phlegmatic people, they are little troubled by matters of time when something of any importance is to be resolved.’","The Orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell — that is the point."" ""Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning. The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of Jean Jacques Rousseau, — you remember, — the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man's whole life passes in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will administer to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule — eccentric or stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to thirty-six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is permissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym, then, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an `elimination;' you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence, without the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a punishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense of the word, of him who inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no groans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act, — then one escapes the clutch of the human law, which says, `Do not disturb society!' This is the mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern climes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance."""

"Le baron, suivi du comte, traversa une longue file d'appartements remarquables par leur lourde somptuosité et leur fastueux mauvais goût, et arriva jusqu'au boudoir de Mme Danglars, petite pièce octogone tendue de satin rose recouvert de mousseline des Indes; les fauteuils étaient en vieux bois doré et en vieilles étoffes; les dessus des portes représentaient des bergeries dans le genre de Boucher; enfin deux jolis pastels en médaillon, en harmonie avec le reste de l'ameublement, faisaient de cette petite chambre la seule de l'hôtel qui eût quelque caractère; il est vrai qu'elle avait échappé au plan général arrêté entre M. Danglars et son architecte, une des plus hautes et des plus éminentes célébrités de l'Empire, et que c'était la baronne et Lucien Debray seulement qui s'en étaient réservé la décoration. Aussi M. Danglars, grand admirateur de l'antique à la manière dont le comprenait le Directoire, méprisait-il fort ce coquet petit réduit, où, au reste, il n'était admis en général qu'à la condition qu'il ferait excuser sa présence en amenant quelqu'un; ce n'était donc pas en réalité Danglars qui présentait, c'était au contraire lui qui était présenté et qui était bien ou mal reçu selon que le visage du visiteur était agréable ou désagréable à la baronne.","The Baron, followed by the Count, passed through a long row of apartments remarkable for their heavy sumptuousness and sumptuous bad taste, and arrived at Madame Danglars' boudoir, a small octagonal room hung with pink satin covered with Indian muslin; the armchairs were of old gilded wood and old fabrics; the tops of the doors represented sheepfolds in the style of Boucher; finally, two pretty pastels in a medallion, in harmony with the rest of the furnishings, made this little room the only one in the hotel which had any character; it is true that it had escaped the general plan drawn up between M. Danglars and its architect, one of the highest and most eminent celebrities of the Empire, and that it was only the baroness and Lucien Debray who had left it. reserved the decoration. Also M. Danglars, a great admirer of the antique in the way the Directory understood it, greatly despised this pretty little retreat, where, moreover, he was only admitted in general on the condition that he would excuse his presence by bringing someone; it was therefore not in reality Danglars who presented, it was on the contrary him who was presented and who was well or badly received depending on whether the face of the visitor was pleasant or disagreeable to the baroness.","Followed by the count, the baron led the way through a long succession of apartments characterized by tedious ostentation and expensive bad taste, until they reached Mme Danglars’ boudoir, a small octagonal room hung with red satin and trimmed with Indian muslin. The chairs were in antique gilded wood and covered in old fabrics. Above the doors were paintings of shepherds and shepherdesses in the style of Boucher. Two pretty pastels, in oval frames, complementing the rest of the décor, made this little room the only one in the house with some individuality.

Danglars and his architect, one of the most famous and eminent members of his profession under the empire, so only the baroness and Lucien Debray were involved in doing it up. Danglars, a great admirer of Antiquity – as interpreted by the Directoire1 – consequently had nothing but contempt for this charming little cubbyhole to which, in any case, he was usually admitted only on condition that he brought someone with him to excuse his presence. So in reality it was not Danglars who introduced visitors, but he himself who was introduced, to be received well or ill, depending on how much the visitor’s face pleased or displeased the baroness.","The baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments, in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame Danglars — a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered with white Indian muslin. The chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials; over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses, after the style and manner of Boucher; and at each side pretty medallions in crayons, harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment, the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed. The truth was, it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by M. Danglars and his architect, who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day. The decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debray. M. Danglars, however, while possessing a great admiration for the antique, as it was understood during the time of the Directory, entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife's favorite sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted to intrude, unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced, than that of being the presenter of another, his reception being cordial or frigid, in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness."

So, when I consider the follies of my youth, I sometimes think that God will forgive them, because some compensation for them (though not an excuse) is to be found in my sufferings.

"Pendant cet instant de silence, le comte put considérer à son aise l'enfant que sa mère couvrait de baisers.

Son premier mouvement fut de se débarrasser par une brusque secousse des bras de sa mère, et d'aller ouvrir le coffret d'où le comte avait tiré le flacon d'élixir; puis aussitôt, sans en demander la permission à personne, et en enfant habitué à satisfaire tous ses caprices, il se mit à déboucher les fioles.","During this moment of silence, the Count was able to contemplate at his ease the child whom his mother was covering with kisses. He was small, slender, white-skinned like red-haired children, and yet a forest of black hair, rebellious to all curl, covered his rounded forehead, and, falling to his shoulders framing his face, redoubled the liveliness of his full eyes. of sly malice and juvenile wickedness; her mouth, barely reddened again, had fine lips and a wide opening; the features of this eight-year-old child already announced at least twelve years. His first impulse was to get rid of his mother's arms with a sudden jerk, and go and open the casket from which the count had taken the flask of elixir; then immediately, without asking anyone's permission, and like a child accustomed to satisfying all his whims, he began to uncork the vials.","In the momentary silence, the count had time to look at the child, whom the mother was smothering in kisses. He was small and lanky, with a whiteness of skin more common in redheads. However, an unruly forest of black hair covered his domed forehead and, falling across his shoulders on each side of his face, doubled the light of juvenile cunning and spitefulness that shone from his eyes. His broad mouth and slender lips were just recovering their colour; this eight-year-old’s features were those of a child of twelve, at least. His first movement was brusquely to shake himself free of his mother’s arms and to go across to the chest from which the count had taken the phial of elixir. Immediately he opened it and, without asking permission, like a child used to having his every whim satisfied, began to take the stoppers off the bottles.","The child was small for his age, and unnaturally pale. A mass of straight black hair, defying all attempts to train or curl it, fell over his projecting forehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment. His mouth was large, and the lips, which had not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact, the deep and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the child's face, belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young. His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without asking permission of any one, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to pull the corks out of all the bottles."

A first-class fortune, I would call one which is made up of disposable treasures, land, mines and incomes from government bonds in countries like France, Austria or England, provided these treasures, possessions or incomes add up to a total of at least a hundred million. A second-class fortune is one whose owner possesses factories, business interests, viceroyships or principalities yielding under one million five hundred thousand francs, all adding up to a capital of some fifty million. Finally, a third-class fortune would be capital paying compound interest, profits depending on the will of others or on chance, which are liable to be damaged by a bankruptcy or shattered by a telegraph signal; occasional speculation and other operations subject to the whims of a fate which we might call force mineure, by analogy with the whims of nature which are force majeure; all of it amounting to a real or hypothetical capital of some fifteen million. Isn’t that roughly your situation?’","""Certainly,"" continued Monte Cristo, ""I make three assortments in fortune — first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate fortunes. I call those first-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one's hand, such as mines, lands, and funded property, in such states as France, Austria, and England, provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions; I call those second-rate fortunes, that are gained by manufacturing enterprises, joint-stock companies, viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more than 1,500,000 francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions; finally, I call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of a fluctuating capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks, speculations of the day — in fact, all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions.

"—Mettons sept mois, répliqua Monte-Cristo du même ton. Dites-moi, avez-vous pensé à cela quelquefois, que sept fois dix-sept cent mille francs font douze millions ou à peu près?... Non? Eh bien, vous avez raison, car avec des réflexions pareilles on n’engagerait jamais ses capitaux, qui sont au financier ce que la peau est à l’homme civilisé. Nous avons nos habits plus ou moins somptueux, c’est notre crédit; mais quand l’homme meurt, il n’a que sa peau, de même qu’en sortant des affaires, vous n’avez que votre bien réel, cinq ou six millions tout au plus; car les fortunes de troisième ordre ne représentent guère que le tiers ou le quart de leur apparence, comme la locomotive d’un chemin de fer n’est toujours, au milieu de la fumée qui l’enveloppe et qui la grossit, qu’une machine plus ou moins forte. Eh bien, sur ces cinq millions qui forment votre actif réel, vous venez d’en perdre à peu près deux, qui diminuent d’autant votre fortune fictive ou votre crédit; c’est-à-dire, mon cher monsieur Danglars, que votre peau vient d’être ouverte par une saignée qui, réitérée quatre fois, entraînerait la mort. Eh! eh! faites attention, mon cher monsieur Danglars. Avez-vous besoin d’argent? Voulez-vous que je vous en prête?","""Let's say seven months,"" replied Monte Cristo in the same tone. Tell me, have you ever thought of that, that seven times seventeen hundred thousand francs equals twelve million or so? No? Well, you are right, because with such reflections one would never commit one's capital, which is to the financier what the skin is to the civilized man. We have our more or less sumptuous clothes, it is our credit; but when the man dies, he has only his skin, just as when leaving business, you have only your real property, five or six million at the most; for fortunes of the third order hardly represent more than a third or a quarter of their appearance, just as the locomotive of a railroad is always, in the midst of the smoke which envelops and swells it, only a machine more or less strong. Well, out of these five millions which form your real assets, you have just lost about two of them, which diminishes your fictitious fortune or your credit by the same amount; that is to say, my dear Monsieur Danglars, that your skin has just been cut open by bleeding which, repeated four times, would result in death. Hey! hey! be careful, my dear Monsieur Danglars. Do you need money? Do you want me to lend you some?","‘Say seven months,’ Monte Cristo continued, in the same tone. ‘Tell me, have you ever considered that seven times one million seven hundred thousand francs makes about twelve million? No? Well, you are right, because if one were to reflect on such things, one would never venture one’s capital, which is to the financier what his skin is to a civilized man. We have our more or less sumptuous clothes, which are our credit, but when a man dies he has only his skin. Just as, when you leave business, you will have your real wealth – five or six million at most… because a third-class fortune barely represents a third or a quarter of what it appears, much as the locomotive of a railway train, amid the steam and smoke that enwraps it and enlarges it, is only at base a more or less powerful machine. Well, of the five million that represent your real capital, you have just lost around two million, which reduces your notional fortune or your credit by the same amount. All this means, my dear Monsieur Danglars, that your skin has just been opened by a wound which, repeated four times, would mean death. Well, well! You must be careful, my dear Monsieur Danglars. Do you need money? Can I lend you some?’","""Let us imagine seven such months,"" continued Monte Cristo, in the same tone. ""Tell me, have you ever thought that seven times 1,700,000 francs make nearly twelve millions? No, you have not; — well, you are right, for if you indulged in such reflections, you would never risk your principal, which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man. We have our clothes, some more splendid than others, — this is our credit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way, on retiring from business, you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive on a railway, the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it. Well, out of the five or six millions which form your real capital, you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of course, in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune; to follow out my simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and this if repeated three or four times will cause death — so pay attention to it, my dear Monsieur Danglars.

Her lips were so thin that, instead of protruding outward, they entered her mouth; finally the breadth and prominence of the cheekbones, an infallible sign of cunning, the depression of the forehead, the swelling of the occiput, which exceeded by many large ears of the less aristocratic, contributed to give, for any physiognomist, an almost repulsive character. in the face of this personage highly commendable in the eyes of the vulgar by his magnificent horses, the enormous diamond which he wore in his shirt and the red ribbon which extended from one buttonhole to the other of his coat.","As he waited, the man examined the exterior of the house, what could be seen of the garden and the livery of a few servants who might be observed coming and going – and did so with such close attention as to amount almost to impertinence. His eye was sharp, but with more cunning in it than wit or irony. His lips were so thin that they vanished inside the mouth instead of protruding from it. Finally, the breadth and prominence of the cheekbones (an infallible sign of shrewdness), the retreating forehead, the bulging occiput which extended well beyond his wide and not in the least aristocratic ears, all contributed to give this gentleman (whom any ordinary person would have thought very respectable in view of his magnificent horses, the enormous diamond he wore in his shirt and the red ribbon that stretched from one buttonhole to another on his coat), a face which to a trained physiognomist betrayed an almost repulsive character.","While waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house, the garden as far as he could distinguish it, and the livery of servants who passed to and fro, with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent. His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin that, as they closed, they were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones were broad and projecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and craftiness; while the flatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the back of his skull, which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears, combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the red ribbon that depended from his button-hole."

"En effet, de vingt rosiers qui composaient le parterre, pas une feuille ne portait la trace de la mouche, pas un filet la petite grappe de pucerons verts qui désolent et rongent les plantes grandissant sur un terrain humide. Ce n’était cependant point l’humidité qui manquait à ce jardin: la terre noire comme de la suie, l’opaque feuillage des arbres, le disaient assez; d’ailleurs l’humidité factice eût promptement suppléé à l’humidité naturelle, grâce au tonneau plein d’eau croupissante qui creusait un des angles du jardin, et dans lequel stationnaient, sur une nappe verte, une grenouille et un crapaud qui, par incompatibilité d’humeur, sans doute, se tenaient toujours, en se tournant le dos, aux deux points opposés du cercle.","In fact, of the twenty rosebushes which made up the bed, not a leaf bore the trace of the fly, not a streak of the little cluster of green aphids which desolate and gnaw the plants growing on damp ground. However, it was not the humidity that was lacking in this garden: the earth black as soot, the opaque foliage of the trees, said it enough; besides, the factitious humidity would have promptly made up for the natural humidity, thanks to the barrel full of stagnant water which hollowed out one of the corners of the garden, and in which were stationed, on a green tablecloth, a frog and a toad which, by incompatibility of temper, no doubt, still stood, with their backs to each other, at the two opposite points of the circle.","Not one leaf on any of its twenty rosebushes bore a trace of greenfly and not a twig housed a little cluster of those aphids which gnaw and lay waste plants growing in damp soil. This did not mean, however, that it was dry here. On the contrary, the earth as black as soot and the dense foliage of the trees bore witness to a natural humidity, which could always be supplemented by artificial means from a barrel full of stagnant water at one corner of the garden. Here, on the green surface, a frog and a toad had taken up residence, but always on opposite sides of the circle, with their backs turned to one another, owing no doubt to some incompatibility of temperament.","In fact, of the twenty rose-trees which formed the parterre, not one bore the mark of the slug, nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil. And yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as soot, the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides, had natural humidity been wanting, it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means, thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of the corners of the garden, and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad, who, from antipathy, no doubt, always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin."
