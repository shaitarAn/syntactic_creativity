"« Que dirai-je ? Les femmes et filles ont aspiré à cette louange et manne céleste de bonne doctrine.

"– À propos, dit Pantagruel, avant nous mettre en voie, de certains points nous faut expédier[6]. Premièrement, renvoyons Triboulet à Blois (ce que fut fait à l’heure, et lui donna Pantagruel une robe de drap d’or frisé) ; secondement, nous faut avoir l’avis et congé du roi mon père.

Further, we need find some sibyl for guide and intermediary[7]. »","‘That reminds me,’ said Pantagruel, ‘there are certain details we must quickly see to before we set out. ‘First, let us send Triboullet back to Blois (which was done that very hour, Pantagruel giving him a coat of gold crêpe). Second, we must have the counsel and congee of the king my father. We must also find us a sybil to serve as guide and interpreter.’","Nevertheless (quoth Pantagruel) before we adventure to set forwards on the Road of our projected and intended Voyage, some few Points are to be discussed, expedited and dispatched. First, Let us send back Triboulet to Blois, (which was instantly done, after that Pantagruel had given him a Frize Coat.) Secondly, Our Design must be backed with the Advice and Counsel of the King my Father. And Lastly, It is most needful and expedient for us, that we search for, and find out some Sibylle to serve us for a Guide, Truchman and Interpreter."

Let us therefore consult together, and bethink our selves by what meanes we may come to this intelligence: whereunto they all said, Let us go thither and see, and stay you here for us, for this very day, without further respite do we make account to bring you a certain report thereof."

After he was awakened he would shake his eares a little. In the mean time they brought him fresh wine, there he drank better then ever. Ponocrates shewed him, that it was an ill diet to drink so after sleeping.

Then began he to study a little, and out came the patenotres or rosary of beads; which the better and more formally to dispatch, he got up on an old mule, which had served nine Kings, and so mumbling with his mouth, nodding and dodling his head, would go see a coney ferretted or caught in a ginne; At his return he went into the Kitchin, to know what roste meat was on the spit, and what otherwayes was to be drest for supper: and supped very well upon my conscience: and commonly did invite some of his neighbours that were good drinkers, with whom carousing and drinking merrily, they told stories of all sorts from the old to the new. Amongst others, he had for domesticks the Lords of Fou, of Gourville, of Griniot, and of Marigny. After supper were brought in upon the place the faire wooden Gospels, and the books of the foure Kings, that is to say, many paires of tables and cardes: or the faire flusse, one, two, three: or at all to make short work: or else they went to see the wenches thereabouts, with little small banquets, intermixed with collations and reer-Suppers. Then did he sleep without unbrideling, until eight a clock in the next morning."
"– Il n’est, répondit Pantagruel, jà besoin. C’est chose superstitieuse, et n’est qu’abus ce qu’en ont écrit Sérapion Ascalonites, Antiphon, Philochorus, Artémon et Fulgentius Placiades. Autant vous en dirais-je de l’épaule gauche du crocodile et du caméléon, sauf l’honneur du vieux Démocrite, autant de la pierre des Bactrians nommée Eumétrides, autant de la corne d’Hammon (ainsi nomment les Éthiopiens une pierre précieuse à couleur d’or et forme d’une corne de bélier, comme est la corne de Jupiter Hammonien, affirmants autant être vrais et infaillibles les songes de ceux qui la portent, que sont les oracles divins.) Par aventure est ce qu’écrivent Homère et Virgile des deux portes de songe, esquelles vous êtes recommandé. L’une est d’ivoire, par laquelle entrent les songes confus, fallaces et incertains, comme à travers l’ivoire, tant soit déliée que voudrez, possible n’est rien voir, sa densité et opacité empêche la pénétration des esprits visifs[26] et réception des espèces visibles. L’autre est de corne, par laquelle entrent les songes certains, vrais et infaillibles, comme à travers la corne, par sa resplendeur et diaphanéité apparaissent toutes espèces certainement et distinctement.","“There is no need,” answered Pantagruel, “. It is a superstitious thing, and Serapion Ascalonites, Antiphon, Philochorus, Artemon, and Fulgentius Placiades have written of it as an abuse. As much as I would tell you of the left shoulder of the crocodile and the chameleon, saving the honor of old Democritus, as much of the Bactrian stone called Eumerides, as much of the horn of Hammon (thus the Ethiopians call a precious stone with golden in color and shaped like a ram's horn, as is the horn of Jupiter Hammonian, affirming as much to be true and infallible the dreams of those who bear it, as are the divine oracles.) By adventure is what Homer writes and Virgil of the two dream gates, from which you are recommended. One is of ivory, through which confused, fallacious and uncertain dreams enter, as through ivory, as loose as you want, possible is nothing to see, its density and opacity prevents the penetration of visceral spirits[ 26] and receipt of visible cash. The other is of horn, through which certain, true and infallible dreams enter, as through the horn, by its splendor and transparency, all species appear certainly and distinctly.","‘There is no need of that,’ replied Pantagruel. ‘It is superstitious; and what has been written on such matters by Serapion Ascalonites, Antiphon, Philochorus, Artemon and Fulgentius Planciades is full of abuses. ‘I would say the same of a crocodile’s left shoulder and (with due respect to Democritus) of a chameleon; similarly, of that stone of the Bactrians called eumetrides, and of horn-ammonite (which is the name given by the Ethiopians to a precious stone which, like the horns of Jupiter Ammon, is gold in colour and shaped like a ram ’s horn; they assert that the dreams of any who wear it are as true and infallible as holy oracles). ‘Perhaps that is what Homer and Virgil meant by the two gates of dreams to which you have commended yourself. – one gateway is of ivory; through it enter dreams which are confused, deceptive and uncertain, just as it is impossible to see through ivory however fine-drawn it may be: its density and opacity impede penetration by our visive spirits and so the reception of visible forms; – the other gateway is of horn, through which enter dreams which are certain, true and infallible, just as all forms appear clearly and distinctly through horn on account of its translucency and transparency.’","There is no need at all of that (quoth Pantagruel) for besides that it is a thing very Superstitious, the Cheat thereof hath been at large discovered unto us, in the Writings of Serapion Ascalonites, Antiphon, Philochorus, Artemon, and Fulgentius Placiades. I could say as much to you of the Left Shoulder of a Crocodile, as also of a Camelion, without prejudice be it spoken to the Credit which is due to the Opinion of old Democritus; and likewise of the Stone of the Bactrians, called Eumerites, and of the Hammonian Horn: for so by the Æthiopians is termed a certain precious Stone, coloured like Gold, and in the fashion, shape, form, and proportion of a Ram’s Horn, as the Horn of Jupiter Hammon is reported to have been: they over and above assuredly affirming, that the Dreams of those who carry it about them are no less veritable and infallible, than the Truth of the Divine Oracles. Nor is this much unlike to what Homer and Virgil wrote of these two Gates of Sleep: to which you have been pleased to recommend the management of what you have in hand. The one is of Ivory, which setteth in confused, doubtful, and uncertain Dreams; for thro’ Ivory, how small and slender it soever be, we can see nothing, the density, opacity, and close compactedness of its material parts, hindring the penetration of the visual Rays, and the reception of the Speciesses of such things as are visible: The other is of Horn, at which an entry is made to sure and certain Dreams, even as through Horn, by reason of the diaphanous splendour, and bright transparency thereof, the Species of all Objects of the sight distinctly pass, and so without confusion appear, that they are clearly seen."

"Un jour, déjeunant avec ses gens (comme il était humain et débonnaire), manda quérir son boulanger, nommé Loyre, et sa femme, ensemble[13] le curé de sa paroisse, nommé Oudart, qui le servait de sommelier, comme lors était la coutume en France, et leur dit en présence de ses gentilshommes et autres domestiques : « Enfants, vous voyez en quelle fâcherie me jettent journellement ces marauds chicanous. J’en suis là résolu que, si ne m’y aidez, je délibère[14] abandonner le pays et prendre le parti du Soudan[15] à tous les diables. Désormais, quand céans ils viendront, soyez prêts, vous Loyre et votre femme, pour vous représenter en ma grande salle avec vos belles robes nuptiales, comme si l’on vous fiançait, et comme premièrement fûtes fiancés. Tenez, voilà cent écus d’or, lesquels je vous donne pour entretenir vos beaux accoutrements. Vous, messire Oudart, ne faillez[16] y comparaître en votre beau surplis et étole, avec l’eau bénite, comme pour les fiancer. Vous pareillement, Trudon (ainsi était nommé son tambourineur), soyez-y avec votre flûte et tambour. Les paroles dites et la mariée baisée, au son du tambour vous tous baillerez l’un à l’autre du souvenir des noces, ce sont petits coups de poing. Ce faisants, vous n’en souperez que mieux. Mais quand ce viendra au chicanous, frappez dessus comme sur seigle vert, ne l’épargnez. Tapez, daubez, frappez, je vous en prie. Tenez, présentement je vous donne ces jeunes gantelets de joûte, couverts de chevrotin[17]. Donnez-lui coups sans compter, à tort et à travers. Celui qui mieux le daubera, je reconnaîtrai pour mieux affectionné. N’ayez peur d’en être repris en justice. Je serai garant pour tous. Tels coups seront donnés en riant, selon la coutume observée en toute fiançailles. » – « Voire mais, demanda Oudart, à quoi connaîtrons-nous le chicanous, car, en cette votre maison, journellement abordent gens de toutes parts. » – « J’y ai donné ordre, répondit Basché. Quand à la porte de céans viendra quelque homme, ou à pied ou assez mal monté, ayant un anneau d’argent gros et large on[18] pouce, il sera chicanous. Le portier l’ayant introduit courtoisement, sonnera la campanelle[19]. Alors soyez prêts et venez en salle jouer la tragique comédie que vous ai exposée. »","One day, lunching with his people (as he was humane and good-natured), sent for his baker, named Loyre, and his wife, together [13] the priest of his parish, named Oudart, who served as sommelier, as at that time was the custom in France, and said to them in the presence of his gentlemen and other servants: “Children, you see into what annoyance these Chicanous marauds throw me daily. I am there resolved that, if you don't help me, I deliberate [14] to abandon the country and take the side of Sudan [15] to all the devils. From now on, when they come here, be ready, you Loyre and your wife, to represent yourselves in my great hall with your beautiful nuptial dresses, as if you were betrothed, and as if you were first betrothed. Here, here are a hundred gold crowns, which I give you to maintain your fine accoutrements. You, Messire Oudart, must not [16] appear there in your beautiful surplice and stole, with holy water, as if to betroth them. You likewise, Trudon (thus was called his drummer), be there with your flute and drum. The words spoken and the bride fucked, to the sound of the drum you will all yawn to each other with the memory of the wedding, these are little punches. By doing so, you will only have a better dinner. But when it comes to chicanous, hit it as on green rye, don't spare it. Knock, daub, knock, please. Here, now I give you these young jousting gauntlets, covered with buckshot[17]. Give him blows without counting, wrongly and through. The one who best daubers it, I will recognize as the most affectionate. Don't be afraid of being taken to court. I will be guarantor for all. Such blows will be given while laughing, according to the custom observed in any engagement. – “Or even but, asked Oudart, how will we know the chicanous, because, in this house, people from all over are daily approaching. ""I gave the order,"" replied Basché. When at the door of this house comes a man, either on foot or rather badly mounted, with a silver ring big and wide one [18] inch, he will be chicanous. The doorman having introduced him courteously, will ring the campanelle[19]. So be ready and come to the theater to play the tragic comedy that I exposed to you. »","‘Basché, being gracious and debonair, was breakfasting one day with his people when he sent for his baker (whose name was Loyre) and his wife as well as for as the curé of his parish (whose name was Oudart and who served as his wine-steward, as was then the custom in France). Then in the presence of the noblemen and others of his household he said: ‘“You can see, my dears, into what exasperation I am daily provoked by those good-for-nothing Chicanous. I’ve made up my mind: unless you help me I shall leave the country and, damme, join the Sultan! From now on, whenever they come in, you Loyre and your wife must be ready to appear in my Great Hall clad in your fine wedding garments as though you were being married, exactly as when you were actually married. Take this: here are a hundred gold crowns which I give to you to maintain your robes in good condition. And you, Sir Oudart, do not fail to be there with them in your best surplice and stole and with holy water as though to marry them. And you, Trudon – that was the name of his drummer-boy – you must be there with your fife and tabor. When the declaration is pronounced and the bride duly kissed to the sound of the tabor, you will all give each other those little buffets with the fist which are reminders of wedlock. You will sup all the better for it. But when it comes to Chicanous, thrash him like green rye! Don’t spare him. Beat him, I pray. Biff him. Bash him. Look: I give you here and now these brand-new jousting-gauntlets, covered with goatskin. Don’t count your blows: rain them down on him from right and left. Whoever plasters him best I will declare to be the one who loves me most. Have no fear of being arraigned for it. I shall vouch for you all. Following the custom honoured at weddings, such blows shall be given in jest!” ‘“Indeed yes,” said Oudart; “but how shall we recognize Chicanous, for people arrive in your house every day from all over the place.” ‘“I have seen to that,” replied Basché. “Whenever there arrives at our gates a fellow, on foot or ill-enough mounted, wearing a big, fat silver signet-ring on his thumb, that will be Chicanous. Once he has courteously ushered him in the gate-keeper will toll the bell. Be ready then and come into Hall in order to act out the tragic-comedy which I have outlined to you.”","One Morning as he was at breakfast with some of his Domestics (for he lov’d to be sometimes among them) he sent for one Loir his Baker and his Spouse, and for one Oudart the Vicar of his Parish, who was also his Butler, as the Custom was then in France; then said to them before his Gentleman and other Servants: You all see how I am daily plagu’d with these rascally Catchpoles, truly if you do not lend me your helping hand, I am finally resolv’d to leave the Country, and go fight for the Sultan, or the Devill, rather than be thus eternally tees’d. Therefore to be rid of their damn’d Visits, hereafter, when any of them come here, be ready you Baker and your Wife, to make your personal appearance in my great Hall in your wedding Cloaths, as if you were going to be affianc’d; here take these Ducats, which I give you to keep you in a fitting Garb. As for you, Sir Oudart, be sure you make your personal appearance there in your fine Surplice and Stole, not forgetting your Holy Water, as if you were to wed them. Be you there also, Trudon, said he to his Drummer, with your Pipe and Taber. The form of Matrimony must be read, and the Bride kiss’d, then all of you, as the Witnesses use to do in this Country, shall give one another the remembrance of the Wedding, (which you know is to be a blow with your Fist, bidding the Partie struck remember the Nuptials by that token) this will but make you have the better Stomach to your Supper: but when you come to the Catchpole’s turn, thrash him thrice and threefold, as you would a Sheaf of green Corn, don’t spare him, maul him, drub him, lambast him, swinge him off, I pray you. Here, take these Steel Gantlets, covered with Kid, Head, Back, Belly, and Sides, give him blows innumerable; he that gives him most, shall be my best Friend. Fear not to be call’d to an account about it, I’ll stand by you; for the blows must seem to be given in jest, as it is Customary among us at all Weddings. Ay, but how shall we know the Catchpole, said the Man of God, all sorts of People daily resort to this Castle? I have taken care of that, reply’d the Lord. When some fellow either on foot or on a scurvy Jade, with a large broad Silver Ring on his Thumb comes to the door, he is certainly a Catchpole: the Porter having civilly let him in, shall ring the Bell, then be all ready, and come into the Hall, to act the Tragi-Comedy, whose Plot I have now laid for you."

"– Mon ami, dit-il, les demoiselles de cette ville avaient trouvé, par instigation du diable d’enfer, une manière de collets ou cache-cous à la haute façon qui leur cachaient si bien les seins que l’on n’y pouvait plus mettre la main par dessous, car la fente d’iceux elles avaient mise par derrière, et étaient tous clos par devant, dont les pauvres amants, dolents, contemplatifs, n’étaient contents. Un beau jour de mardi, j’en présentai requête à la Cour, me formant partie contre les dites demoiselles et remontrant les grands intérêts[18] que j’y prétendais, protestant que, à même raison, je ferais coudre la braguette de mes chausses au derrière si la Cour n’y donnait ordre. Somme toute, les demoiselles formèrent syndicat, montrèrent leurs fondements et passèrent procuration à défendre leur cause ; mais je les poursuivis si vertement que par arrêt de la Cour fut dit que ces hauts cache-cous ne seraient plus portés, sinon qu’ils fussent quelque peu fendus par devant. Mais il me coûta beaucoup.","“My friend,” he said, “the young ladies of this town had found, at the instigation of the devil in hell, a kind of high fashion collars or neck warmers which hid their breasts so well that one could not could no longer put their hand underneath, for the cleft of them they had put behind, and were all closed in front, with which the poor lovers, dolent, contemplative, were not happy. One fine day on Tuesday, I presented a request to the Court, forming a party against the said young ladies and showing the great interests[18] that I claimed therein, protesting that, for the same reason, I would have the fly of my breeches on the back if the Court did not order it. All in all, the young ladies formed a union, showed their foundations and passed power of attorney to defend their cause; but I pursued them so vigorously that by judgment of the Court it was said that these high neck warmers would no longer be worn, except that they were somewhat split in front. But it cost me a lot.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","My friend, (said he) the Gentlewomen of this City had found out, by the instigation of the devil of hell, a manner of high-mounted bands, and neckerchiefs for women, which so closely cover their bosomes, that men could no more put their hands under; for they had put the slit behinde, and those neckcloths were wholly shut before, whereat the poor sad comtemplative lovers were much discontented. Upon a faire Tuesday, I presented a Petition to the Court, making my self a Party against the said Gentlewomen, and shewing the great interest that I pretended therein, protesting that by the same reason, I would cause the Codpeece of my breeches to be sowed behinde, if the Court would not take order for it. In summe, the Gentlewomen put in their defences, shewed the grounds they went upon, and constituted their Atturney for the prosecuting of the cause, but I pursued them so vigorously, that by a sentence of the Court it was decreed, those high neckclothes should be no longer worne, if they were not a little cleft and open before, but it cost me a good summe of money."
"Retournants à la beuverie, aperçûmes un vieil évêgaut à tête verte, lequel était acroué[10], accompagné de trois onocrotales[11], oiseaux joyeux, et ronflaient sous une feuillade. Près de lui était une jolie abbegesse, laquelle joyeusement chantait, et y prenions plaisir si grand que désirions tous nos membres en oreilles convertis, rien ne perdre de son chant, et du tout, sans ailleurs être distraits, y vaquer. Panurge dit- : « Cette belle abbegesse se rompt la tête à force de chanter, et ce gros vilain évêgaut ronfle cependant. Je le ferai bien tantôt chanter de par le diable. » Lors sonna une cloche pendante sur sa cage ; mais quelque sonnerie qu’il fît, plus fort ronflait évêgaut, point ne chantait. « Par Dieu, dit Panurge, vieille buse, par moyen autre bien chanter je vous ferai. »","Returning to the drinking party, we saw an old bishop with a green head, which was crouched[10], accompanied by three onocrotales[11], joyful birds, and snoring under a foliage. Next to him was a pretty abbess, who joyfully sang, and we took such great pleasure in it that all our members in converted ears desired, to lose nothing of her song, and at all, without being distracted, to go about it. Panurge said: ""This beautiful abbess breaks her head from singing, and this big ugly bishop snores all the same."" I'll have it sung soon by the devil. Then rang a bell hanging from his cage; but whatever bell he rang, the louder he snored, he did not sing. “By God,” said Panurge, old buzzard, “by other means I will make you sing well. »","On our way back to our potations we perceived an ancient green-headed Bishogoth squatting down in the company of some merry Protonotary-Birds which were snoring in an arbour. Near by perched a pretty Abbégesse, which twittered happily away: we took such pleasure in her song that we wished that all our limbs were turned into ears so as to lose nothing of it and to be in no wise distracted by anything else, concentrating on it alone. Panurge said: ‘That beautiful Abbégesse is splitting her temples by the force of her singing while that ugly, fat old Bishogoth goes on snoring. I’ll soon get it singing too, in the name of all the devils.’ With that he struck a bell hanging over its cage, but however hard he did so, it never sang but snored all the more. ‘By God, you old buzzard,’ said Panurge, ‘I shall find some other way to make you sing!’","As we went back to have t’ other fuddling Bout, we spy’d an old green-headed Bishhawk, who sate moping with his Mate and three jolly Bitter Attendants, all snoring under an Arbor.

Quoth Panurge, This pretty Cherubin of Cherubins is here breaking her Head with chanting to this huge, fat, ugly-face, who lies grunting all the while like a Hog as he is. I’ll make him change his Note presently in the Devil’s Name. With this he rang a Bell that hung over the Bishhawk’s Head; but, tho’ he rang and rang again, the Devil-a-bit Bishhawk would hear; the lowder the sound, the lowder his snoring.

The experience there is in waterlily heraclia, amerina, willow, mustard, periclymenos, tamarisk, vitex, mandrake, hemlock, orchis the little one, the skin of a hippopotamus, and others; which, within human bodies, as much by their elementary virtues as by their specific properties, freeze and mortify the prolific germ or dissipate the spirits which were to lead it to the places destined by nature, or oppile[9] the ways and conduits by which it could be expelled. As, on the contrary, we have some that warm up, excite and enable [10] man to the venereal act.","‘Secondly: by certain drugs and simples which render a man feeble, spell-bound, and incapable of the generative act. Experiments have shown that to be true of nymphea heraclia, the Amerinian osier or willow, hempseed, honeysuckle, tamarisk, agnus-castus, mandrake, hemlock, the lesser orchis, the skin of an hippopotamus, etc., which, within the human body, by their elemental powers and specific qualities, freeze and deaden the fertile seed or alternatively disperse the spirits which must conduct it to the organs destined by Nature to that end, or else oppilate the passages and conduits through which it can be ejaculated: as, on the contrary we have other substances which increase a man’s ardour, excite him and dispose him towards the act of Venus.’","Secondly, the Fervency of Lust is abated by certain Drugs, Plants, Herbs and Roots, which make the Taker cold, maleficiated, unfit for, and unable to perform the Act of Generation; as hath been often experimented in the Water-Lilly, Heraclea, Agnus Castus, Willow-twigs, Hemp-stalks, Woodbind, Honey suckle, Tamarisk, Chastree, Mandrake, Bennet, Kecbuglosse, the Skin of a Hippopatam, and many other such, which by convenient Doses, proportioned to the peccant Humour and Constitution of the Patient, being duly and seasonably received within the Body, what by their Elementary Vertues on the one side, and peculiar Properties on the other, do either benumb, mortifie and beclumpse with Cold the prolifick Semence; or scatter and disperse the Spirits, which ought to have gone along with, and conducted the Sperm to the places destinated and appointed for its reception.

"– Ainsi, dit Panurge, que je regardais en grand liesse ce beau feu, me gabelant[39] et disant : « Ha ! pauvres puces, ha ! pauvres souris, vous aurez mauvais hiver, le feu est en votre pailler[40] », sortirent plus de six, voire plus de treize cents et onze chiens, gros et menus tous ensemble, de la ville, fuyant le feu. De première venue accoururent droit à moi, sentant l’odeur de ma paillarde[41] chair demi-rôtie, et m’eussent dévoré à l’heure si mon bon ange ne m’eût bien inspiré, m’enseignant un remède bien opportun contre le mal des dents.","“So,” said Panurge, “I gazed with great jubilation at this beautiful fire, dressing myself up[39] and saying: “Ha! poor fleas, ha! poor mice, you will have a bad winter, the fire is in your straw[40]”, came out more than six, even more than thirteen hundred and eleven dogs, big and small all together, from the city, fleeing the fire. First comers ran straight to me, smelling the odor of my half-roasted flesh, and would have devoured me on time if my good angel had not inspired me well, teaching me a very timely remedy. against toothache.","And then a dire and dreadful flood you’ll see! Flood do I say, and say it with right reason, For all this strife will not be out of season Nor shall the world be freed of it at last","Thus, said Panurge; for when with pleasure I beheld this jolly fire, jesting with my self, and saying, Ha poor flies, ha poor mice, you will have a bad winter of it this yeare, the fire is in your reeks, it is in your bedstraw,—out came more then six, yea more than thirteen hundred and eleven dogs great and small, altogether out of the town, flying away from the fire; at the first approach they ran all upon me, being carried on by the sent of my leacherous half-roasted flesh, and had even then devoured me in a trice, if my good Angel had not well inspired me with the instruction of a remedy, very sovereign against the tooth-ache. And wherefore (said Pantagruel) wert thou afraid of the toothache, or paine of the teeth?"
"Adonc fit convoquer son conseil et proposa l’affaire tel comme il était, et fut conclu qu’on enverrait quelque homme prudent devers Picrochole savoir pourquoi ainsi soudainement était parti[13] de son repos, et envahi les terres èsquelles n’avait droit quiconque[14] ; davantage[15] qu’on envoyât quérir Gargantua et ses gens afin de maintenir le pays et défendre à ce besoin. Le tout plut à Grandgousier et commanda qu’ainsi fut fait. Dont sur l’heure envoya le Basque, son laquais, quérir à toute diligence Gargantua, et lui écrivait comme s’ensuit.","So summoned his council and offered the matter as it was, and it was concluded that some prudent man should be sent to Picrochole to know why so suddenly had departed[13] from his rest, and invaded the lands to which no one had a right. [14]; more [15] that one sent to fetch Gargantua and his people in order to maintain the country and defend it to this need. Everything pleased Grandgousier and ordered that it be done. Whose instantaneously sent the Basque, his lackey, to fetch Gargantua with all diligence, and wrote to him as follows.","And so he convoked his Council and explained how matters stood. It was concluded that a man of wisdom be despatched to Picrochole to find out why he had thus suddenly abandoned his repose and invaded lands over which he had no right whatsoever; in addition that Gargantua and his men be summoned to save and defend their country in its hour of need. Grandgousier was entirely pleased and ordered it to be done. Whereupon, within the hour, he despatched his manservant, the Basque, to summon Gargantua at all speed, having written him the following letter: The purport of the letter which Grandgousier wrote to Gargantua","Then assembled he his counsel, and proposed the matter as it was indeed, where-upon it was concluded, that they should send some discreet man unto Picrochole, to know wherefore he had thus suddenly broken the Peace, and invaded those lands unto which he had no right nor title. Furthermore, that they should send for Gargantua, and those under his command, for the preservation of the countrey, and defence thereof now at need. All this pleased Grangousier very well, and commanded that so it should be done. Presently therefore he sent the Basque his Lackey, to fetch Gargantua with all diligence, and wrote to him as followeth."

The same is mystically taught us by the ancient Prophets and Poets, who alledge, That all vain and deceitful Dreams lie hid and in covert, under the Leaves which are spread on the ground: by reason that the Leaves fall from the Trees, in the Autumnal Quarter: for the natural fervour, which abounding in ripe, fresh, recent Fruits, cometh by the quickness of its ebullition, to be with ease evaporated into the Animal parts of the dreaming Person (the Experiment is obvious in must) is a pretty while before it be expired, dissolved, and evanished.

How Panurge advises Pantagruel whether he should marry,"So stop being amazed at my novel accoutrements.’ How Panurge seeks advice from Pantagruel over whether he ought to marry CHAPTER 9 [A chapter in which the replies echo the last words of the question. (Erasmus made the form popular and respectable in his colloquy entitled ‘Echo’.) Here it is a means of casting the decision back to Panurge. Two of the adages of Erasmus are relevant: I, IV, XXXII, To cast every dice’, and I, VII, XCIX (more or less) ‘To scratch one another’s back’. From Ecclesiastes 4:1 is cited ‘Woe to him that is alone’. It was often quoted by those arguing against enforced celibacy and in favour of marriage. It was Seneca who wrote (Epistle 94) that ‘what you have done to others will be done unto you’. The Sage who said ‘Where there is no wife he greatly mourneth who is ill’ is the author of Ecclesiasticus (36:27).]","CHAPTER IX How Panurge asketh Counsel of Pantagruel whether he should marry, Yea or No."

"« Reste, dit Panurge continuant, un petit point à vider. Vous avez autrefois vu on gonfalon[1] de Rome, S. P. Q. R., Si Peu Que Rien. Serai-je point cocu ?","“There remains,” said Panurge continuing, “a small point to empty. You have formerly seen one gonfalon[1] of Rome, S. P. Q. R., Si Peu Que Rien. Will I not be a cuckold?","In this chapter woman, as in Virgil, is ‘fickle and variable’ (tacitly cited from Aeneid, IV, 569). Woman’s instability is explained with the help of Plato, but (as was true of other medical authorities of the time) it exploits a passage ripped out of context. Plato in the Timaeus, 91 A-D, made both male and female human beings each subject to a different ‘animal’ which drove them to sexual intercourse. Galen (in On Affected Parts and elsewhere) cited – in total isolation from its context – only the ‘animal’ which worked in woman: the womb, ‘an animal avid for generation’. (The parallel ‘animal’ of the male is simply not mentioned.) The animal within a woman makes her whole life unstable and precarious. Many insisted as here, on Plato’s authority, that the womb was indeed an animal in the strictest sense: it is capable of self-movement and can distinguish between smells, qualities used in the diagnosis and treatment of hysteria. Others insisted that its movements were ‘accidental’ (incidental and secondary). Here such contentions are severely rejected. The only change later made is to turn ‘five hundred times’ into ‘five hundred and five’.] ‘There remains,’ continued Panurge, ‘one little item to void. You have, sometime or other, seen on the gonfalon of Rome, S.P.Q.R., that is, Such a Piddling Question Really. I shan’t be cuckolded, shall I?’","THERE remaineth as yet, quoth Panurge going on in his Discourse, one small scruple to be cleared : you have seen heretofore, I doubt not, in the Roman Standards, S.P.Q.R. Si, Peu, Que, Rien: Shall not I be a Cuckold?"
"– J’y ai, répondit Panurge, pourvu. Je l’ai ici dedans ma gibecière, en une verge[5] d’or, accompagné de beaux et joyeux carolus[6]. »","“I have,” replied Panurge, “provided for. I have it here in my satchel, in a golden rod[5], accompanied by beautiful and joyful carolus[6]. »","‘I’ve seen to that,’ replied Panurge. ‘I have here in my game-bag a golden ring in the company of some nice merry Carolus shillings.’","I have (quoth Panurge) provided pretty well for that , for here I have it within my Bag, in the substance of a Gold Ring, accompanied with some fair Pieces of small Money."
"Ce nonobstant il en jeta sur le tillac trois ou quatre poignées Et y vis des paroles bien piquantes, des paroles sanglantes, (lesquelles le pilote nous disait quelquefois retourner on[11] lieu duquel étaient proférées, mais c’était la gorge coupée), des paroles horrifiques, et autres assez mal plaisantes à voir. Lesquelles ensemblement fondues ouïmes, hin, hin, hin, hin, his, ticque, torche, lorgne, brededin, brededac, frr, frrr, frrrr, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, tracc, tracc, trr, trr, trr, trrrrrr, on, on, on, on, ououououon, goth, magoth, et ne sais quels autres mots barbares, et disait que c’était vocables du hourt[12] et hennissement des chevaux à l’heure qu’on choque.

Je voulais quelques mots de gueule mettre en réserve dedans de l’huile comme l’on garde la neige et la glace, et entre du feurre[13] bien net. Mais Pantagruel ne le voulut, disant être folie faire réserve de ce dont jamais l’on n’a faute et que toujours on a en main, comme sont mots de gueule entre tous bons et joyeux pantagruélistes. Là Panurge fâcha quelque peu frère Jean, et le fit entrer en rêverie, car il le vous prit au mot sur l’instant qu’il ne s’en doutait mie[14], et frère Jean menaça de l’en faire repentir en pareille mode que se repentit G. Jousseaulme vendant à son mot le drap au noble Patelin, et ad venant qu’il fût marié le prendre aux cornes, comme un veau, puisqu’il l’avait pris au mot comme un homme. Panurge lui fit la babou[15], en signe de dérision. Puis s’écria, disant : « Plût à Dieu qu’ici, sans plus avant procéder, j’eusse le mot de la dive bouteille ! »","This notwithstanding, he threw three or four handfuls of it on the deck And saw in them very sharp words, bloody words, (which the pilot sometimes told us to return to the place from which they were uttered, but it was the cut throat), horrifying words, and others quite unpleasant to see. Which together melted ouïmes, hin, hin, hin, hin, his, ticque, torch, eyeing, brededin, brededac, frr, frrr, frrrr, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, tracc, tracc , trr, trr, trr, trrrrrr, we, we, we, we, ououououon, goth, magoth, and do not know what other barbaric words, and said that it was vocables of the hourt[12] and neighing of the horses at the hour that we shock. Then into gills other large ones, and gave sound as they thawed, some like drums and fifes, others like bugles and trumpets. Believe we had a lot of pastime there. I wanted to put a few jokes in reserve inside the oil as one keeps the snow and the ice, and between the fur [13] very clean. But Pantagruel did not want it, saying it was madness to reserve what we are never at fault and always have in hand, as are jokes between all good and joyful Pantagruelists. There Panurge somewhat angered Brother John, and made him enter into a reverie, for he took him at your word at the moment he suspected it,[14] and Brother John threatened to make him repent of it by G. Jousseaulme repented of such a fashion, selling the cloth to the noble Patelin at his word, and if he were married, take him by the horns, like a calf, since he had taken him at his word like a man. Panurge gave him the babou [15], as a sign of derision. Then he exclaimed, saying: ""Would to God that here, without further proceeding, I had the word of the godly bottle!"" »","He nevertheless tossed three or four fistfuls on to the deck. And I saw many sharp Words, and bloodthirsty Words too (which the pilot said come home to roost with the man that uttered them and cut his throat); there were dreadful Words, and others unpleasant to behold. When they had all melted together we heard: Hing, hing, hing, hing: hisse; hickory, dickory, dock; brededing, brededac, frr, frrr, frrr, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou. Ong, ong, ong, ong, ououou-ouong; Gog, magog and who-knows-what other barbarous words; and the pilot said that they were vocables from battles joined and from horses neighing at the moment of the charge; and then we heard other ones, fat ones which made sounds when they melted, some of drum or fife; others of bugle and trumpet. Believe you me, they provided us with some excellent sport. I had hoped to preserve a few gullet-words in oil, wrapping them up in very clean straw (as we do with snow and ice); but Pantagruel would not allow it, saying that it was madness to pickle something which is never lacking and always to hand as are gullet-words amongst all good and merry Pantagruelists. Panurge annoyed Frère Jean somewhat and made him mad with anger by taking him literally at his word68 when he was least expecting it. Frère Jean threatened to make him sorry (as Guillaume Jousseaulme was sorry he had sold his cloth to our noble Pathelin), and since Panurge had caught him out as you catch a man – by his words – he (if ever Panurge did get married) would catch him out like a calf, by his horns. Panurge curled his lip as a sign of derision. Then he cried out, saying, ‘Would to God that here – without proceeding any further – I could have the Word of the Dive Bouteille.’","However, he threw three or four Handfulls of them on the Deck, among which I perceiv’d some very sharp words, and some bloody words, which the Pilot said, us’d sometimes to go back and recoil to the place whence they came, but ’twas with a slit weesand; we also saw some terrible words, and some others not very pleasant to the Eye. When they had been all melted together, we heard a strange noise, hin, hin, hin, hin, his, tick, tock, taack, brededin, brededack, frr, frr, frr, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, track, track, trr, trr, trr, trrr, trrrrrr, on, on, on, on, on, on, ououououon, gog, magog, and I do not know what other barbarous words, which the Pilot said, were the noise made by the Charging Squadrons, the shock and neighing of Horses. Then we heard some large ones go off like Drums and Fifes, and others like Clarions and Trumpets. Believe me, we had very good sport with them. I wou’d fain have sav’d some merry odd words, and have preserv’d them in Oyl, as Ice and Snow are kept, and between clean Straw. But Pantagruel would not let me, saying, that ’tis a folly to hoard up what we are never like to want, or have always at hand, odd, quaint, merry and fat words of Gules never being scarce among all good and jovial Pantagruelists. Panurge somewhat vex’d Fryar Jhon, and put him in the pouts; for he took him at his word, while he dreamt of nothing less. This caus’d the Fryar to threaten him with such a piece of Revenge as was put upon G. Jousseaume, who having taken the merry Patelin at his Word, when he had overbid himself in some Cloth, was afterwards fairly taken by the Horns like a Bullock, by his jovial Chapman, whom he took at his Word like a Man. Panurge well knowing that threaten’d folks live long, bobb’d, and made mouths at him, in token of Derision, then cry’d, would I had here the Word of the Holy Bottle, without being thus oblig’d to go farther in Pilgrimage to her."

Pourtant[7] semblait-il à un pourceau, car andouilles furent de pourceau extraites. Pantagruel demandait à quel propos et quelle indication curative il avait tant de moutarde en terre projeté. La reine répondit que moutarde était leur sangréal et baume céleste, duquel mettant quelque peu dedans les plaies des andouilles terrassées, en bien peu de temps les navrées[8] guérissaient, les mortes ressuscitaient.","Pantagruel graciously thanked the queen, forgave all the offense, refused the offer she had made, and gave her a fine little Pargois knife. Then curiously asked him about the appearance of the aforesaid monster. She replied that it was the idea[6] of Mardigras, their tutelary god in times of war, the first founder and original of the whole Andouillic race. However[7] it seemed like a pig, because chitterlings were extracted from a pig. Pantagruel asked for what purpose and what curative indication he had so much mustard on the ground. The queen replied that mustard was their sangréal and celestial balm, of which, by putting a little into it the wounds of the fallen andouilles, in a very short time the heartbroken[8] healed, the dead resuscitated.","Pantagruel graciously thanked the Queen, forgave her her offence, refused her offer of fealty and bestowed on her a pretty little penknife from Prague. He then carefully questioned her about the monster which had previously appeared. She replied that it was the Idea of Mardi Gras, their tutelary god in times of war, the first Founder and the source of the Chidling race. That is why it looked like a Pig, for Chidlings are of porcine extraction. Pantagruel inquired for what reason, and following what curative prescription, it had scattered such a quantity of mustard over the land. The queen replied that mustard was their sangréal, their celestial balm: by putting a little of it on the wounds of the stricken Chidlings the wounded recovered in next to no time and the dead were resuscitated.","Pantagruel civilly thank’d the Queen, forgave all Offences, refus’d the offer she had made of her Country, and gave her a pretty little Knife: after that, he ask’d several nice Questions concerning the Apparition of that flying Hog? she answer’d , That it was the Idea of Carnaval, their Tutelary God, in time of War, first Founder and Original of all the Chitterling-race, for which reason he resembled a Hog, for Chitterlings drew their Extraction from Hogs. Pantagruel asking to what purpose, and curative Indication, he had voided so much Mustard on the Earth? The Queen reply’d, That Mustard was their Sang-real, and celestial Balsam, of which laying but a little in the wounds of the fallen Chitterlings, in a very short time the wounded were heal’d, and the dead restor’d to life."
"Pantagruel par Gymnaste fit acheter la vie et gestes d’Achilles, en soixante et dix-huit pièces de tapisserie à hautes lisses, longues de quatre, larges de trois toises, toutes de soie phrygienne, recamée[12] d’or et d’argent. Et commençait la tapisserie aux noces de Péleus et Thétis, continuant la nativité d’Achilles, sa jeunesse décrite par Stace Papinie, ses gestes et faits d’armes célébrés par Homère, et exèques[13] décrits par Ovide et Quinte Calabrais, finissant en l’apparition de son ombre, et sacrifice de Polyxène décrit par Euripides.","Pantagruel by Gymnast bought the life and gestures of Achilles, in seventy-eight pieces of tapestry with high warps, four long, three fathoms wide, all of Phrygian silk, recame[12] of gold and silver. money.

The series began with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, continuing with the birth of Achilles, his youth as described by Statius Papinius, his deeds and feats-of-arms celebrated by Homer, his death and obsequies described by Ovid and Quintus Calaber, and ending with the apparition of his ghost and the sacrificing of Polyxena described by Euripides.","Pantagruel caused to be bought by Gymnast, the Life and Deeds of Achilles in Seventy eight pieces of Tapestry four Fathom long, and three Fathom broad, all of Phrygian Silk imboss’d with Gold and Silver; the Work beginning at the Nuptials of Peleus and Thetis, continuing to the Birth of Achilles; his Youth describ’d by Statius Papinius; his warlike Atchievements celebrated by Homer; his Death and Exequies written by Ovid and Quintus Calaber; and ending at the appearance of his Ghost, and Polyxene’s Sacrifice Rehearsed by Euripides."
"« Quand je dis femme, je dis un sexe tant fragile, tant variable, tant muable, tant inconstant et imparfait, que nature me semble (parlant en tout honneur et révérence) s’être égarée de ce bon sens par lequel elle avait créé et formé toutes choses, quand elle a bâti la femme. Et, y ayant pensé cent et cinq cents fois, ne sais à quoi m’en résoudre, sinon que, forgeant la femme, elle a eu égard à la sociale délectation de l’homme et à la perpétuité de l’espèce humaine, plus qu’à la perfection de l’individuelle muliébrité[9]. Certes Platon ne sait en quel rang il les doive colloquer, ou des animaux raisonnables, ou des bêtes brutes. Car nature leur a dedans le corps posé en lieu secret et intestin[10] un animal, un membre, lequel n’est ès hommes, onquel[11] quelquefois sont engendrées certaines humeurs salses[12], nitreuses, boracineuses[13], âcres, mordicantes, lancinantes, chatouillantes amèrement, par la pointure[14] et frétillement douloureux desquelles (car ce membre est tout nerveux et de vif sentiment) tout le corps est en elles ébranlé, tous les sens ravis, toutes affections intérinées[15], tous pensements[16] confondus. De manière que, si nature ne leur eût arrosé le front d’un peu de honte, vous les verriez comme forcenées courir l’aiguillette, plus épouvantablement que ne firent onques les Proétides, les Mimallonides, ni les Thyades bachiques au jour de leurs bacchanales, parce que cetui terrible animal a colligence[17] à toutes les parties principales du corps comme est évident en l’anatomie.","“When I say woman, I mean a sex so fragile, so variable, so changeable, so inconstant and imperfect, that nature seems to me (speaking with all honor and reverence) to have strayed from that good sense by which she had created and formed all things, when she built the woman. And, having thought about it a hundred and five hundred times, I don't know what to make of it, except that, forging woman, she had regard to the social delight of man and the perpetuity of the human species, more than to the perfection of individual multi-breeding[9]. Certainly Plato does not know in what rank he should collocate them, either reasonable animals or brute beasts. Because nature has inside them the body placed in a secret place and intestine [10] an animal, a member, which is not in men, on which [11] sometimes are generated certain salses [12], nitrous, boracinous [13] humours, acrid, biting, throbbing, bitterly tickling, by the size[14] and painful wriggling of which (for this member is all nervous and of lively feeling) the whole body is in them shaken, all the senses delighted, all internal affections[15] , all thoughts[16] combined. In such a way that, if nature had not sprinkled their brows with a little shame, you would see them like madmen running around the aiguillette, more frightfully than ever did the Proetids, the Mimallonids, or the bacchanalian Thyades on the day of their bacchanals. , because this terrible animal has colligence[17] to all the principal parts of the body as is evident in the anatomy.","‘When I say woman I mean a sex so weak, so fickle, so variable, so changeable, so imperfect, that Nature – speaking with all due reverence and respect – seems to me, when she made woman, to have strayed from that good sense with which she had created and fashioned all things. I have pondered over it five hundred times yet I can reach no solution except that Nature had more regard for the social delight of man and the perpetuating of the human species than for the perfection of individual womanhood. Certainly Plato does not know into which category to put women: rational animal or irrational beast; for Nature has placed within their bodies, in a hidden intestinal place, an animal (an organ not found in men) in which from time to time certain humours are engendered – saline, nitrous, boracic, caustic, gnawing, stabbing and painfully irritating – from the sharp pangs and painful throbbing of which (since that organ is all sinews and quickened sensitivity) their whole body is convulsed, all their senses ravished, all their emotions heightened and all their thoughts confused, to such an extent that if Nature had not dewed their foreheads with a little modesty you would see them hunting the fly-cord as though they were mad, more awesomely than the Proetides ever did, or the Mimallonides or the bacchic Thyades on the day of their bacchanalia, because that terrifying animal is colligate with all the principal parts of the body, as is evident from dissections.","When I say Womankind, I speak of a Sex so frail, so variable, so changeable, so fickle, inconstant, and imperfect, that, in my Opinion, Nature (under favour nevertheless of the prime Honour and Reverence which is due unto her) did in a manner mistake the Road which she had traced formerly, and stray exceedingly from that Excellence of Providential Judgment, by the which she had created and formed all other things, when she built, framed, and made up the Woman. And having thought upon it a Hundred and five times, I know not what else to determine therein, save only that in the devising, hammering, forging and composing of the Woman, she hath had a much tenderer regard, and by a great deal more respectful heed to the delightful Consortship, and sociable Delectation of the Man, than to the Perfection and Accomplishment of the individual Womanishness, or Muliebrity. The divine Philosopher Plato was doubtful in what Rank of living Creatures to place and collocate them, whither amongst the Rational Animals, by elevating them to an upper Seat in the Specified Classis of Humanity; or with the Irrational by degrading them to a lower Bench on the opposite side, of a Brutal kind, and meer Bestiality: for Nature hath posited in a privy, secret, and intestine place of their Bodies, a sort of Member, (by some not impertinently termed an Animal) which is not to be found in Men. Therein sometimes are ingendred certain Humours so saltish, brackish, clammy, sharp, nipping, tearing, prickling, and most eagerly tickling, that by their stinging Acrimony, rending Nitrosity, figging Itch, wrigling Mordicancy, and smarting Salsitude, (for the said Member is altogether sinewy, and of a most quick and lively feeling) their whole Body is shaken and ebrangled, their Senses totally ravished and transported, the Operations of their Judgment and Understanding utterly confounded, and all disordinate Passions and Perturbations of the Mind thoroughly and absolutely allowed, admitted, and approved of; yea, in such sort, that if Nature had not been so favourable unto them, as to have sprinkled their Forehead with a little Tincture of Bashfulness and Modesty, you should see them in a so frantick mood run mad after Lechery, and hye apace up and down with hast and Lust, in quest of, and to fix some Chamber-Standard in their Paphian Ground, that never did the Pretides, Mimallonides, nor Lyœan Thyads, deport themselves in the time of their Bacchanalian Festivals, more shamelesly, or with a so affronted and brazen-faced Impudency; because this terrible Animal is knit unto, and hath an union with all the chief and most principal Parts of the Body, as to Anatomists is evident."
"– Pour ce, dit Panurge, qu’elle est bien entamée.","“For this,” said Panurge, “it is well under way.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Because, said Panurge, she is well slit and broke up already; What do you mean by that?"

"Ce fait, on apportait des cartes, non pour jouer, mais pour y apprendre mille petites gentillesses et inventions nouvelles, lesquelles toutes issaient[12] d’arithmétique. En ce moyen entra en affection d’icelle science numérale, et, tous les jours après dîner et souper, y passait temps aussi plaisantement qu’il soulait[13] ès dès ou ès cartes.

As much [14] knew of it both theoretically and practically, so much so that Tunstal, an Englishman who had written extensively about it, confessed that really, compared to him, he only understood High German.","That completed, the cards would be brought out – not for play but to learn from them hundreds of little delights and novelties all of which derived from arithmetic.

"Après l’oraison, fut mélodieusement chanté le psaume du saint roi David, lequel commence Quand Israël hors d’Égypte sortit. Le psaume parachevé, furent sur le tillac les tables dressées, et viandes[23] promptement apportées. Les Thalassiens, qui pareillement avaient le psaume susdit chanté, firent de leurs maisons force vivres et vinage[24] apporter. Tous burent à eux. Ils burent à tous.

The psalm finished, the tables were laid on the deck, and the meat[23] promptly brought. The Thalassians, who likewise had the aforesaid psalm sung, made their houses bring food and wine[24]. All drank to them. They all drank. This was the cause why none of the congregation unque by the navy[25] gave up his throat and had disturbance of stomach or head. Which drawbacks could not have been so conveniently obviated, drinking sea water for a few days beforehand, either pure or mixed with wine, using quince flesh, lemon peel, sweet and sour pomegranate juice, or long diets, or covering their stomachs with paper, or otherwise doing what the mad doctors order those who go to sea.","After prayer, there was tunefully sung the Psalm of David [the Godly king] which begins, When Israel came out of Egypt.

That explained why not one of the ship’s company ever got sea-sick during the journey or suffered from troubled heads or stomachs. They would never have avoided those ailments so conveniently by drinking salt-water for a few days beforehand (either pure or mixed with wine), by eating the pulp of quinces, lemon-rind or the juice of bitter-sweet pomegranates, by following some long-drawn-out diet, by covering their stomachs with paper, or by doing any of those things which stupid physicians prescribe for such as put to sea.","After the Prayers, was melodiously sung a Psalm of the Holy King David, which begins, When Israel went out of Ægypt; and that being ended, Tables were plac’d upon Deck, and a Feast speedily serv’d up.

All drank to them, they drank to all; which was the cause that none of the whole Company gave up what they had eaten, nor were Sea-sick with a pain at the Head and Stomach, which inconveniency they could not so easily have prevented by drinking, for some time before, Salt-Water either alone or mixt with Wine, using Quinces, Citron-peel, Juice of Pomgranats, sowrish Sweat-Meats, fasting a long time, covering their Stomachs with Paper, or following such other idle Remedies, as foolish Physicians prescribe to those that go to Sea."

Long ago a Roman called Furnius received from Caesar Augustus a grace and pardon for his father who had joined the faction of Mark-Anthony; and Furnius said to him, ‘In doing me that favour today you have reduced me to such embarrassment that, whether I live or die, I must needs appear ungrateful on account of the total inadequacy of my gratitude.’ Thus could I say today that your exceeding fatherly love for me has made me afraid that I must live and die an ingrate, unless, that is, I am relieved of such an incrimination by a judgement of the Stoics, who maintained there to be three parts in a beneficent action: the part of the giver; the part of the receiver; and, third, the part of the recompenser; and that the receiver very well recompenses the giver when he gratefully accepts the beneficence and retains it in perpetual memory; as, on the contrary, the receiver is the most ungrateful man in the world who would slight and forget the beneficence.","But since you have made me happy beyond expectation, by the perusal of your Gracious Letter, and the Faith I have in your Esquire, hath reviv’d my Spirits by the News of your welfare; I am as it were compell’d to do what formerly I did freely, that is, first to praise the Blessed Redeemer, who by his Divine Goodness preserves you in this long enjoyment of perfect Health; then to return you eternal Thanks for the fervent Affection which you have for me your most humble Son and unprofitable Servant. Formerly a Roman, named Furnius, said to Augustus who had received his Father into Favour, and Pardoned him after he had sided with Anthony, that by that Action the Emperor had reduc’d him to this extremity, That for want of Power to be Grateful, both while he liv’d and after it, he should be oblig’d to be tax’d with Ingratitude. So I may say, That the excess of your Fatherly Affection, drives me into such a streight, that I shall be forced to live and die ungrateful; unless that Crime be redress’d by the Sentence of the Stoicks, who say, That there are three parts in a Benefit, the one of the Giver, the other of the Receiver, the third of the Remunerator; and that the Receiver rewards the Giver when he freely receives the Benefit, and always remembers it; as on the contrary, That Man is most ungrateful who despises and forgets a Benefit."
"– Vous, dit Æditue, parlez à cette heure correct[9] : ainsi parlant, jamais ne serez hérétique. Allons, j’en suis d’opinion. »","– You, said Æditue, speak at this time correct[9]: thus speaking, you will never be heretical. Come on, I'm of the opinion. »","‘At this hour you are talking correctly,’ said the Aedituus. ‘Talk like that and you’ll never be a heretic. Let’s go. I share your opinion.’","Now this is something like a Tansy, said Ædituus; you begin to talk somewhat like , still speak in that fashion, and I’ll secure you from being thought an Heretic. Come on, I am of your mind."

"– Aussi, répondit Pantagruel, en vos propositions tant y a de si et de mais, que je n’y saurais rien fonder ni rien résoudre. N’êtes-vous assuré de votre vouloir ? Le point principal y gît : tout le reste est fortuit et dépendant des fatales dispositions du ciel. Nous voyons bon nombre de gens tant heureux à cette rencontre qu’en leur mariage semble reluire quelque idée et représentation des joies de paradis. Autres y sont tant malheureux que les diables qui tentent les ermites par les déserts de Thébaïde et Montserrat ne le sont davantage. Il s’y convient mettre à l’aventure, les yeux bandés, baissant la tête, baisant la terre, et se recommandant à Dieu au demeurant, puisqu’une fois l’on s’y veut mettre. Autre assurance ne vous en saurais-je donner.","""So,"" replied Pantagruel, ""there are so many ifs and buts in your propositions that I cannot found or resolve anything."" Are you not sure of your will? The main point lies there: all the rest is fortuitous and dependent on the fatal dispositions of the sky. We see many people so happy at this meeting that their marriage seems to shine with some idea and representation of the joys of paradise. Others are so unhappy there that the devils who tempt the hermits through the deserts of Thebaid and Montserrat are no more so. He agrees to take it on at random, blindfolded, lowering his head, kissing the ground, and commending himself to God for the rest, since once you want to get into it. No other assurance I can give you.","‘In your propositions, too, there are so many ifs and buts,’ replied Pantagruel, ‘that I can build nothing on them nor reach any conclusion. Are you not sure of your will? The principal point lies therein: all the rest is fortuitous and dependent on the destined dispositions of Heaven. ‘We see many couples so happily met that there seems to shine forth in their marriage some Idea and Form of the joys of Paradise. Others are so wretched that the devils who tempt the hermits in the deserts of the Thebaid and Montserrat are not more so. Once it is your will to enter upon it, you must embark on it blindfold, bowing your head and kissing the ground, commending yourself meanwhile to God. ‘No other assurance can I give you.","I know not (quoth Pantagruel) which of all my Answers to lay hold on; for your Proposals are so full of ifs and buts, that I can ground nothing on them, nor pitch upon any solid and positive Determination satisfactory to what is demanded by them. Are not you assured within your self of what you have a mind to? the chief and main point of the whole matter lieth there; all the rest is merely casual, and totally dependeth upon the fatal Disposition of the Heavens. We see some so happy in the fortune of this Nuptial Encounter, that their Family shineth (as it were) with the radiant Effulgency of an Idea, Model or Representation of the Joys of Paradice; and perceive others again to be so unluckily match’d in the Conjugal Yoak, that those very basest of Devils, which tempt the Hermits that inhabit the Deserts of Thebaida and Montserrat, are not more miserable than they. It is therefore expedient, seeing you are resolved for once to take a trial of the state of Marriage, that, with shut Eyes, bowing your Head, and kissing the Ground, you put the business to a Venture, and give it a fair hazard in recommending the success of the residue to the disposure of Almighty God. It lieth not in my Power to give you any other manner of Assurance, or otherways to certifie you of what shall ensue on this your Undertaking."

Mais pour entendre pleinement la cause et raison de son nom, qui lui fut baillé en baptême, vous noterez qu’en icelle année fut sécheresse tant grande en tout le pays d’Afrique que passèrent xxxvj mois, trois semaines, quatre jours, treize heures et quelque peu davantage sans pluie, avec chaleur de soleil si véhémente que toute la terre en était aride.","Gargantua, in his age of four hundred and eighty-four years, begot his son Pantagruel from his wife named Badebec, daughter of the king of the Amaurotes, in Utopia, who died of child sickness, for he was so wonderfully tall and so heavy that it could not come to light without suffocating its mother. But to fully understand the cause and reason for his name, which was given to him in baptism, you will note that in this year there was such a great drought throughout the country of Africa that xxxvj months, three weeks, four days, thirteen hours passed. and somewhat more without rain, with the heat of the sun so vehement that the whole earth was arid.","Away vile Usury’s filthy money-grubbers, Foul beggars, pigs forever with vile snouts in, Fat-cats and Scribes, judicial pettifoggers, Bent, bluff-nosed rascals stuffing coins in coffers, Unsatisfied though thousand crowns are crammed in, All teeth on edge, save when there’s gold to win And pile up high, with lean and hawkish face","MOST Illustrious and thrice valourous Champions, Gentlemen and others, who willingly apply your mindes to the entertainment of pretty conceits, and honest harmlesse knacks of wit: You have not long ago seen, read and understood the great and inestimable Chronicle of the huge and mighty Gyant Gargantua, and like upright Faithfullists, have firmly beleeved all to be true that is contained in them, and have very often passed your time with them amongst Honourable Ladies and Gentlewomen, telling them faire long stories, when you were out of all other talk, for which you are worthy of great praise and sempiternal memory: and I do heartily wish that every man would lay aside his own businesse, meddle no more with his Profession nor Trade, and throw all affaires concerning himself behinde his back, to attend this wholly, without distracting or troubling his minde with any thing else, until he have learned them without book; that if by chance the Art of printing should cease, or in case that in time to come all books should perish, every man might truly teach them unto his children, and deliver them over to his successors and survivors from hand to hand, as a religious Cabal: for there is in it more profit, then a rabble of great pockie Loggerheads are able to discern, who surely understand far lesse in these little merriments, then the foole Raclet did in the institutions of Justinian."

"28. Comment Hippothadée, théologien, donne conseil à Panurge sur l’entreprise de mariage","28. How Hippothadeus, theologian, advises Panurge on the business of marriage","How Hippothadée the theologian gives advice to Panurge about the undertaking of a marriage CHAPTER 30 [Much turns on a sentence of Samt Faul: ‘It is better to wed than to burn’ (I Corinthians 7:9), taken to mean, as it generally was, to burn with lust, not to burn in Hell). By quoting Saint Paul as saying: ‘It is far better to wed than to burn, the theologian pre-empts any attempt to make ‘better’ here mean ‘less bad’. Hippothadée rejects those many denigrators of marriage who, since Saint Jerome, made Saint Paul’s judgement into a morose and coarse alternative to celibacy. It is further interpreted in the light of Matthew 19:10–11, from which evangelicals deduced that celibate chastity, being a special gift from God, cannot be imposed on anyone ever. Hippothadée gives a markedly evangelical turn to his questions and answers, drawing on the Lord’s Prayer, the teaching of Saint James (1:17) that God is ‘the Giver of all good gifts’ and on the marriage service (with formulas still in use today). For his Classical wisdom Rabelais draws above all on Plutarch’s Marriage Precepts, doubtless following Erasmus. The allusion to a ‘goose which my wife won’t roast’ is another echo of Pathelin. For the ‘privy counsel of God’ see Rabelais’ Almanac for the Year 1533. The ‘valiant woman’ (in Latin, the mulier fortis) described by Solomon is to be found in Proverbs 31]","CHAPTER XXX How the Theologue, Hippothadee, giveth Counsel to Panurge in the matter and business of his Nuptial Enterprize."

The jest is expunged in the final version and Saint Typhany replaced by the Epiphany, but the reference to the Fall in Genesis remains as a serious contribution to the debate from Hippothadée.] ‘At the time,’ said Rondibilis, ‘that Jupiter drew up the roster for his Olympian household and the kalendar of all the gods and goddesses, once he had ascribed a day to each of them and a season for their festivals, and once he had assigned them sites for their oracles and pilgrimages, and provided for their sacrifices…’","AT that time (quoth Rondibilis) when Jupiter took a View of the State of his Olympick House and Family, and that he had made the Calendar of all the Gods and Goddesses, appointing unto the Festival of every one of them its proper day and season, establishing certain fixed places and stations for the pronouncing of Oracles, and relief of travelling pilgrims, and ordaining Victims, Immolations and Sacrifices suitable and correspondent to the Dignity and Nature of the worshipped and adored Deity."

"À minuit, Æditue nous éveilla pour boire : lui-même but le premier, disant : « Vous autres de l’autre monde dites qu’ignorance est mère de tous maux et dites vrai : mais toutefois vous ne la bannissez mie[5] de vos entendements, et vivez en elle, avec elle, par elle. C’est pourquoi tant de maux vous meshaignent[6] de jour en jour, toujours vous plaignez, toujours lamentez, jamais n’êtes assouvis : je le considère présentement. Car ignorance vous tient ici au lit liés comme fut le dieu des batailles par l’art de Vulcain, et n’entendez que le devoir vôtre était d’épargner de votre sommeil, point n’épargner les biens de cette fameuse île. Vous devriez avoir jà fait trois repas, et tenez cela de moi que pour manger les vivres de l’île Sonnante Se faut lever bien matin : les mangeant, ils multiplient, les épargnant, ils vont en dimunition.","At midnight Aeditue woke us up to drink: he himself drank the first, saying: ""You people of the other world say that ignorance is the mother of all evils and tell the truth: but nevertheless you do not banish it from your understandings, and live in it, with it, through it. This is why so many evils bleed you [6] from day to day, always you complain, always lament, never are satisfied: I consider it presently. For ignorance keeps you bound here in bed as was the god of battles by the art of Vulcan, and do not hear that your duty was to spare your sleep, not to spare the goods of this famous island. You should have had three meals by now, and take it from me that to eat the provisions of the Île Sonnante You have to get up early in the morning: eating them, they multiply, sparing them, they diminish.","At midnight the Aedituus woke us up for a drink. He was himself the first to have one, and then spoke to us: ‘You folk from the other world say that Ignorance is the mother of all evil. And you say truly. Yet you by no means banish her for ever from your minds: you live in her, with her, through her. That is why, day in and day out, so many evils beset you. You are ever complaining, ever lamenting, never satisfied. I can see that even now. For it is Ignorance that keeps you tied to your bed (as the god of War was tied by Vulcan’s art): you do not realize that it was your duty to be abstemious with your sleep but never abstemious with the good things of this famous isle. By now you should already have eaten three meals. Believe you me: to eat the foods of this Ringing Island you must get up betimes. Eat them, and they multiply: spare them, and they shrivel.","About midnight Ædituus came to wake us, that we might drink. He himself shew’d us the way, saying, You Men of t’ other World say That Ignorance is the Mother of all Evil; and so far you are right; yet for all that, you don’t take the least care to get rid of it, but still plod on, and live in it, with it, and by it; for which cause a plaguy-deal of mischief lights on you every day, and you are right enough serv’d; you are perpetually ailing somewhat, making a moan, and never right. ’ Tis what I was ruminating upon just now. And, indeed, Ignorance keeps you here fasten’d in Bed, just as that Bully-rock Mars was detain’d by Vulcan’s Art; for all the while you don’t mind that you ought to spare some of your Rest, and be as lavish as you can of the Goods of this famous Island. Come, come, you shou’d have eaten three Breakfasts already, and take this from me for a certain Truth, That if you wou’d consume the Mouth-Ammunition of this Island, you must rise betimes; Eat them, they multiply; Spare them, they diminish."

"« Au regard du haut-de-chausses, ma grande tante Laurence jadis me disait qu’il était fait pour la braguette. Je le crois, en pareille induction que le gentil falot Galen. lib. IX, de l’Usage de nos membres, dit la tête être faite pour les œils, car nature eût pu mettre nos têtes aux genoux ou aux coudes ; mais, ordonnant les œils pour découvrir au loin, les fixa en la tête comme un bâton, au plus haut du corps, comme nous voyons les phares et hautes tours sur les havres de mer être érigées, pour de loin être vue la lanterne. Et pour ce que je voudrais quelque espace de temps, un an pour le moins, respirer de l’art militaire, c’est-à-dire me marier, je ne porte plus braguette, ni par conséquent haut-de-chausses, car la braguette est première pièce de harnais pour armer l’homme de guerre. Et maintiens, jusques au feu (exclusivement entendez), que les Turcs ne sont aptement armés, vu que braguette porter est chose en leurs lois défendue. »","“Regarding the high-breeches, my great aunt Laurence once told me that it was made for the fly. I believe it, in the same induction as the nice lantern Galen. lib. IX, of the Use of our members, says the head is made for the eyes, because nature could have put our heads at the knees or at the elbows; but, ordering the eyes to see afar, fixed them in the head like a stick, in the uppermost part of the body, as we see the lighthouses and high towers on the sea-havens being erected, for the lantern to be seen from afar. And for what I would like for some space of time, a year at least, to breathe military art, that is to say, to get married, I no longer wear a fly, nor consequently high breeches, because the fly is the first piece of harness to arm the man of war. And maintain, until the fire (exclusively hear), that the Turks are not suitably armed, seeing that wearing a fly is something in their laws forbidden. »","As for my breeches, my great aunt Laurence told me in days gone by that breeches were made for codpieces. That I do believe, using the same induction as that nice old twerp Galen in Book Nine of On the Use of our Members, where he says that the head was made for the eyes: for Nature could well have placed our heads in our laps or on our elbows, but, having ordained that eyes should discern things afar, she fixed them on to the head at the highest part of the body as on a pole, just as we find lighthouses and tall beacons erected high above our sea-ports so that their beams may be seen from afar. ‘And since I would like to give myself a breather from the art of war – for a year at least – that is, to get married, I no longer wear a codpiece nor, consequently, my trunk-hose. For the codpiece is the primary item of a fighting man’s armour. And I maintain up to the stake, (exclusively of course), that Turks are not properly clad in their armour, seeing that the wearing of codpieces is outlawed by their religion.’ How the codpiece is the primary item of armour amongst fighting-men CHAPTER 8 [Rabelais has just mocked Galen on human sexuality. He is compared to Pathelin’s aunt Laurence. Galen did indeed maintain that the head was made primarily for the eyes. Others maintained that it was made, more nobly, for the brain. Similarly Galen held and taught that the testicles form a ‘principal member’ so important that it would be preferable for a man to have no heart (the seat of thought as well as of emotions) than no testicles. The quarrel raged in the time of Rabelais, for it centres on the production of semen: Galen – to the angry amusement of his opponents – held that semen was produced in and by the balls. Those who, like Rabelais, followed Hippocrates in this matter, believed that semen originated in all the principal members and, after descending the spinal column, was stored in (not produced by) the testicles. For Galen, the species is more important that the individual: for Hippocrates (and Rabelais who follows him) the perfecting of the individual man is more important that the good of the species. (That is less surely so for the individual woman.","If I be married as yesterday, by the Mosaick Law, you evidenced, in what concerneth the Breeches: my Great-Aunt Laurence did long ago tell me, that the Breeches were only ordained for the Use of the Codpiece, and to no other end; which I, upon a no less forcible Consequence, give Credit to every whit as well, as to the Saying of the fine Fellow Galen, who in his Ninth Book Of the Use, and Employment of our Members, alledgeth, That the Head was made for the Eyes: for Nature might have placed our Heads in our Knees or Elbows; but having before-hand determined that the Eyes should serve to discover things from afar, she, for the better enabling them to execute their designed Office, fixed them in the Head (as on the top of a long Pole) in the most eminent Part of all the Body: no otherwise than we see the Phares, or High Towers erected in the Mouths of Havens, that Navigators may the further off perceive with ease the Lights of the nightly Fires and Lanterns. And because I would gladly, for some short while (a Year at least) take a little Rest and breathing-time from the toylsom Labour of the Military Profession; that is to say, be married; I have desisted from wearing any more a Codpiece, and consequently have laid aside my Breeches: for the Codpiece is the principal and most especial Piece of Armour that a Warriour doth carry; and therefore do I maintain even to the Fire (exclusively, understand you me) that no Turks can properly be said to be armed Men, in regard that Codpieces are by their Law forbidden to be worn."

Some people say, that none e’er saw an Airy or Nest of Sakers; If you’ll believe me, I saw no less than Eleven, and I’m sure I reckon’d right. I saw some left-handed Halberts, which were the first that I had ever seen. I saw some Menticores, a most strange sort of Creatures, which have the Body of a Lyon, red Hair, a Face and Ears like a man’s, three Rows of Teeth which close together, as if you join’d your hands with your fingers between each other; they have a Sting in their Tails like a Scorpions, and a very melodious Voice. I saw some Catablepas’s, a sort of Serpents, whose Bodies are small, but their Heads large without any Proportion, so that they’ve much ado to lift them up; and their Eyes are so infectious, that whoever sees ’em, dies upon the spot, as if he had seen a Basilisk. I saw some Beasts with two Backs, and those seem’d to me the merriest Creatures in the World; they were most nimble at wriggling the Buttocks, and more diligent in Tail-wagging than any Water-wagtails, perpetually jogging and shaking their double Rumps."

"– Allez, dit-elle, je ne m’en soucie : laissez-moi ici prier Dieu.","“Come on,” she said, “I don't care: leave me here to pray to God.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.",", said she, go, I do not care, let me alone to say my prayers."

24. Comment le bon Macrobe raconte à Pantagruel le manoir[1] et discession[2] des héros,24. How the Good Macrobi Tells Pantagruel of the Mansion[1] and Discession[2] of the Heroes,CHAPTER 26 [Rabelais has meditated deeply on Plutarch’s Obsolescence of Oracles. Interpreting Plutarch and other Classical authors as veiled forerunners of Christianity is typical of the fifteenth-century Renaissance in Italy and of the first half of the sixteenth century for the Northern Renaissance. A reading of the Obsolescence of Oracles is interesting in itself and throws much light on to Rabelais’ mind in this and the following chapters. (Even better would be to read all the treatises in Volume 5 of the Loeb bilingual edition of Plutarch’s,"CHAPTER XXVI How the good Macrobius gave us an Account of the Mansion, and decease of the Heroes."
"Les pèlerins, ainsi dévorés, se tirèrent hors les meules de ses dents le mieux que faire purent, et pensaient qu’on les eût mis en quelque basse fosse des prisons, et lorsque Gargantua but le grand trait, cuidèrent noyer en sa bouche, et le torrent du vin presque les emporta au gouffre de son estomac ; toutefois sautants avec leurs bourdons comme font les miquelots[6], se mirent en franchise l’orée[7] des dents. Mais par malheur l’un d’eux, tâtant avec son bourdon le pays, à savoir s’ils étaient en sûreté, frappa rudement en la faute[8] d’une dent creuse et férut[9] le nerf de la mandibule, dont fit très forte douleur à Gargantua et commença crier de rage qu’il endurait. Pour donc se soulager du mal, fit apporter son cure-dents, et, sortant vers le noyer grollier[10], vous dénigea messieurs les pèlerins.","The pilgrims, thus devoured, dragged themselves out of the grindstones of his teeth as best they could, and thought they had been put in some low pit of the prisons, and when Gargantua drank the great draft, they drowned in his mouth, and the torrent of wine almost carried them to the abyss of his stomach; however, leaping with their drones as do the miquelots [6], set themselves free from the edge [7] of their teeth. But by misfortune one of them, probing with his bumblebee the country, to know if they were in safety, struck roughly in the fault[8] with a hollow tooth and ferut[9] the nerve of the mandible, which made Gargantua very strong pain and started screaming with rage that he was enduring. So to relieve himself of the evil, had his toothpick brought, and, going out towards the grollier[10] walnut tree, disparaged you gentlemen pilgrims.","The pilgrims, thus devoured, avoided as well as they could the mill-stones of his teeth: they thought that they had been thrown into a deep dungeon within the prisons. When Gargantua took that huge swig they almost drowned in his mouth and the torrent of wine all but swept them down into the chasm of his stomach. However, leaning on their staves and stepping from stone to stone like pilgrims to Mont-Saint-Michel, they managed to reach safety along the line of his gums. But by mischance, one of them, prodding about with his staff to see whether they were secure, roughly struck the edge of a dental cavity and a nerve in the lower jaw, causing intense pain to Gargantua, who began to yell at the anguish he was enduring. So to ease the ache he called for his toothpicks and, going outside towards a chestnut-tree beloved by rooks, he ejected Messieurs the Pilgrims; for he caught one by the legs, another by the shoulder, another by his pilgrim’s wallet, another by his purse, another by his scarf.","The Pilgrims thus devoured, made shift to save themselves as wel as they could, by withdrawing their bodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth, but could not escape from thinking they had been put in the lowest dungeon of a prison. And when Gargantua whiffed the great draught, they thought to have been drowned in his mouth, and the flood of wine had almost carried them away into the gulf of his stomack. Neverthelesse skipping with their bourdons, as St. Michaels Palmers use to do, they sheltered themselves from the danger of that inundation, under the banks of his teeth. But one of them by chance, groping or sounding the countrey with his staffe, to try whether they were in safety or no, struck hard against the cleft of a hollow tooth, and hit the mandibulary sinew, or nerve of the jaw, which put Gargantua to very great pain, so that he began to cry for the rage that he felt; to ease himself therefore of his smarting ache, he called for his tooth-picker, and rubbing towards a young walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, unnestled you my Gentlemen Pilgrims."
"– Or de par Dieu, répondis-je, si j’avais sphynx en ma maison, or de par Dieu, comme l’avait Verrès, un de vos précurseurs, or de par Dieu, résoudre pourrais l’énigme, or de par Dieu ; mais certes je n’y étais mie[3], et suis or, de par Dieu, innocent du fait.","“Gold by God,” I replied, “if I had a sphynx in my house, or by God, as Verres had, one of your precursors, or by God, I could solve the riddle, or by God ; but certainly I was not involved, and am now, by God, innocent of the fact.","I replied, ‘if I had a sphinx at home, Good Gold! as one of your predecessors, Verres did, then, Good Gold! I could, Good Gold! resolve that riddle; but I have never even been there and am, Good Gold! quite innocent of the deed.’ ‘For Gold’s sake!’ said Catty-claws; ‘if that is all you have to say, I shall demonstrate to you (for Gold’s sake!","Give, give me—leave to tell you, good good, my Lord, answer’d Panurge, That if I had but a Sphynx at home, as Verres one of your Precursors had, I might then solve your Enigma presently; but verily, good my Lord, I was not there; and as I hope to be sav’d, am as innocent in the matter as the Child unborn. Foh, give me—a better Answer, cry’d Gripe-men-all, or by Gold, this shall not serve your turn; I’ll not be paid in such Coin:"
"Entrant Pantagruel en la salle grande du château, trouva le bon Gargantua issant[1] du conseil, lui fit narré[2] sommaire de leurs aventures, exposa leur entreprise, et le supplia que, par son vouloir et congé, la pussent mettre en exécution. Le bon homme Gargantua tenait en ses mains deux gros paquets de requêtes répondues et mémoires de répondre, les bailla à Ulrich Gallet, son antique maître des libelles[3] et requêtes, tira à part Pantagruel, et, en face plus joyeuse que de coutume lui dit : a Je loue Dieu, fils très cher, qui vous conserve en désirs vertueux, et me plaît très bien que par vous soit le voyage parfait ; mais je voudrais que pareillement vous vînt en vouloir et désir vous marier. Me semble que dorénavant venez en âge à ce compétent. Panurge s’est assez efforcé rompre les difficultés qui lui pouvaient être en empêchement. Parlez pour vous.","Entering Pantagruel into the great hall of the castle, found the good Gargantua issuant[1] from the council, told him[2] a summary of their adventures, explained their enterprise, and begged him that, by his will and leave, might put it in execution. The good man Gargantua held in his hands two large packets of answered requests and memoirs of answering, yawned them to Ulrich Gallet, his ancient master of libels[3] and requests, pulled Pantagruel aside, and, more joyfully than usual, said to him: “I praise God, dearest son, who preserves you in virtuous desires, and pleases me very well that through you is the perfect journey; but I would like you to want and want to get married in the same way. Seems to me henceforth come of age to this proficient. Panurge has done his best to overcome the difficulties that could hinder him. Speak for yourself.","The arguments and vocabulary of Rabelais are those shared, for example, by the liberal French legal authority Coras and the Lutheran theologian Martin Bucer. Rabelais was taking on the Roman Church in a vital aspect of its role. To many traditionalists he would have seemed simply Lutheran or Réformé, though many others shared his views, not least amongst the nobility, whose daughters were most at risk. The revenge taken by her brethren for the rape of Dinah in Genesis is condemned by Jacob; it nevertheless became a prime example to be cited with approval as by Rabelais. Erasmus is present in an adage: I, X, XLV, ‘diametrically opposed’ for whatever is ‘vehemently repugnant and incompatible.’] As Pantagruel came into the Great Hall of the château he found his good father Gargantua coming out of his council-chamber and gave him a brief account of their experiences, outlined their project and begged him that they might execute it with his approval and congee. Our good Gargantua was holding in his hands two fat bundles of petitions answered and memoranda to be answered. He handed them to Ulrich Gallet, his long-established Receiver of Requests [and Petitions]. He drew Pantagruel aside and said, looking happier than usual: ‘My dearest son, I praise God who keeps you in virtuous desires. It greatly pleases me that you should see your voyage through, but I could also wish that it similarly came to you too to wish and desire to marry. It seems to me that you have now reached the age when it is becoming to do so. Panurge has tried hard to break down the difficulties which could be an impediment to him. Tell me about yourself.’","No sooner had Pantagruel entred in at the Door of the Great Hall of the Castle, than that he encountred full but with the good honest Gargantua coming forth from the Council Board, unto whom he made a succinct and summary Narrative of what had pass’d and occurred worthy of his Observation in his Travels abroad since their last Interview: Then, acquainting him with the Design he had in hand, besought him that it might stand with his good Will and Pleasure to grant him leave to prosecute and go thorough-stitch with the Enterprize which he had undertaken. The good Man Gargantua having in one hand two great bundles of Petitions, indorsed and answered; and in the other some remembrancing Notes and Bills, to put him in mind of such other Requests of Supplicants, which albeit presented, had nevertheless been neither read nor heard, he gave both to Ulrich Gallet, his ancient and faithful Master of Requests; then drew aside Pantagruel, and with a Countenance more serene and jovial than customary, spoke to him thus: I praise God, and have great reason so to do, my most dear Son, that he hath been pleased to entertain in you a constant Inclination to vertuous Actions. I am well content that the Voyage which you have motioned to me be by you accomplished, but withal, I could wish you would have a mind and desire to marry, for that I see you are of competent years. Panurge in the mean while was in a readiness of preparing and providing for Remedies, Salves and Cures against all such Lets, Obstacles, and Impediments as he could in the height of his Fancy conceive might by Gargantua be cast in the way of their Itinerary Design. It is your Pleasure (most dear Father) that you speak?"

"Gargantua eut la charge totale de l’armée. Son père demeura en son fort, et leur donnant courage par bonnes paroles, promit grand dons à ceux qui feraient quelques prouesses. Puis gagnèrent le gué de Vède, et par bateaux et ponts légèrement faits, passèrent outre d’une traite. Puis, considérant l’assiette de la ville, qui était en lieu haut et avantageux, délibéra celle nuit sur ce qu’était de faire. Mais Gymnaste lui dit :","Gargantua had total charge of the army. His father remained in his fort, and giving them courage by kind words, promised great gifts to those who would perform some prowess. Then they reached the ford of Vède, and by boats and lightly made bridges, passed beyond at a stretch. Then, considering the position of the city, which was in a high and advantageous place, deliberated that night on what to do. But Gymnast said to him:","Gargantua took supreme command of the army. His father remained in his fortress, putting heart into them with good counsel and promising great bounties to any man who performed deeds of valour. They then reached the ford at Vède, which they crossed at one go in boats and over lightly constructed bridges. Then, taking into account the site of the town (which was set on high ground giving it the advantage) he spent the night deliberating on what should be done. But Gymnaste said to him, ‘Such is the nature and temperament of the French that their value lies in the first assault.","GARGANTUA had the charge of the whole Army, and his father Grangousier stayed in his Castle, who encouraging them with good words, promised great rewards unto those that should do any notable service. Having thus set forward, assoon as they had gained the Passe at the Ford of Vede, with boats and bridges speedily made, they past over in a trice, then considering the situation of the town, which was on a high and advantageous place, Gargantua thought fit to call his counsel, and passe that night in deliberation upon what was to be done: But Gymnast said unto him, My sovereign Lord, such is the nature and complexion of the frenches, that they are worth nothing, but at the first push, then are they more fierce then devils; but if they linger a little, and be wearied with delays, they’l prove more faint and remisse"

"« Pour cette et autres causes, le seigneur de Merville essayant quelque jour un harnais neuf, pour suivre son roi en guerre (car du sien antique et à demi rouillé plus bien servir ne pouvait, à cause que depuis certaines années la peau de son ventre s’était beaucoup éloignée de ses rognons) sa femme considéra en esprit contemplatif que peu de soin avait du paquet et bâton commun de leur mariage, vu qu’il ne l’armait que de mailles, et fut d’avis qu’il le munît très bien et gabionnât d’un gros armet de joutes, lequel était en son cabinet inutile. D’icelle sont écrits ces vers on[18] tiers livre du Chiabrena des Pucelles :","""For this and other reasons, the lord of Merville some day trying on a new harness, to follow his king in war (because his antique and half-rusted one could not serve better, because for some years the skin of his belly had strayed far from his kidneys) his wife considered in a contemplative spirit that little care had been taken of the common bundle and staff of their marriage, seeing that he only armed it with mail, and was of opinion that he equipped very well and gabionnait with a large armet of jousting, which was useless in its cabinet. From it are written these verses on [18] third book of the Chiabrena of the Maids:","‘For that and other reasons the Seigneur de Merville, the better to follow his king to the wars, was trying on a new suit of armour one day (since he could no longer make good use of his old half-rusty one, the flesh of his guts having for some years by then distanced itself from his kidneys) when his wife reflected with a pensive mind that he was taking scant care of that billet-doux rod they shared in their marriage (seeing that he was protecting it with nothing but chain-mail) and decided that he should arm it most efficiently with a gabion, a great jousting helmet lying useless in his closet. The following lines about her are written in the Third Book of The Maidens’ Chiabrena:","For this, and other Causes, the Lord Humphry de Merville, following of his King to a certain warlike Expedition, whilst he was in trying upon his own Person a new suit of Armour, for of his old rusty Harness he could make no more use, by reason that some few Years since, the Skin of his Belly was a great way removed from his Kidneys, his Lady thereupon in the profound musing of a contemplative Spirit, very maturely considering that he had but small care of the Staff of Love, and Packet of Marriage, seeing he did no otherwise arm that part of the Body, then with Links of Mail, advised him to shield, fence, and gabionate it with a big tilting Helmet, which she had lying in her Closet, to her otherways utterly unprofitable.

"« Le pinart, rencontrant sur la rive frère Adam Couscoil, cordelier observantin de Mirebeau, lui promit un habit, en condition qu’il le passât outre l’eau à la cabre[13] morte sur ses épaules, car c’était un puissant ribaud. Le pacte fut accordé. Frère Couscoil se trousse jusques aux couilles, et charge à son dos, comme un beau petit saint Christophe, le dit suppliant Dodin. Ainsi le portait gaiement comme Enéas porta son père Anchises hors la conflagration de Troie, chantant un bel Ave maris Stella. Quand ils furent au plus parfond[14] du gué, au-dessus de la roue du moulin, il lui demanda s’il avait point d’argent sur lui. Dodin répondit qu’il en avait pleine gibecière, et qu’il ne se défiât de la promesse faire d’un habit neuf : « Comment, dit frère Couscoil, tu sais bien que, par chapitre exprès de notre règle, il nous est rigoureusement défendu porter argent sur nous. Malheureux es-tu bien, certes, qui m’as fait pécher en ce point. Pourquoi ne laissas-tu ta bourse au meunier ? Sans faute tu en seras présentement puni, et si jamais je te peux tenir en notre chapitre à Mirebeau, tu auras du miserere jusques à vitulos. » Soudain se décharge, et vous jette Dodin en pleine eau la tête au fond.","""The Pinart, meeting Brother Adam Couscoil on the shore, Cordelier Observantin de Mirebeau, promised him a coat, on condition that he passed it over the water with the rear [13] dead on his shoulders, because he was a powerful ribald. The pact was granted. Brother Couscoil bundles himself up to the hilt, and charges at his back, like a handsome little Saint Christopher, says him begging Dodin. Thus carried him gaily as Aeneas carried his father Anchises out of the conflagration of Troy, singing a beautiful Ave maris Stella. When they were at the bottom of the ford, above the wheel of the mill, he asked him if he had any money on him. Dodin replied that he had a game bag full of them, and that he would not mistrust the promise to make a new coat: ""How,"" said Brother Couscoil, ""you know very well forbidden to bring money on us. Unfortunate are you indeed, who made me sin in this point. Why didn't you leave your purse to the miller? Without fail you will be punished for it now, and if ever I can keep you in our chapter at Mirebeau, you will have miserere up to vitulos. Suddenly unloads, and throws Dodin into the water, head to the bottom.","On the bank that prick-proud fellow came across Frère Adam Couscoil of the Observantine Friars at Mirebeau, and promised him a new frock if he would carry him across the river, slung over his shoulder like a dead goat. The Friar was a hefty rogue, you know. It was agreed. ‘Frère Jean Couscoil pulled his skirts right up to his balls and, like a handsome little Saint Christopher, loaded Dodin, the said suppliant, on to his back. And so he merrily carried him (as Aeneas carried Father Anchises out of the conflagration of Troy), singing Hail Mary, Star of the Sea. When they had reached the deepest part of the ford above the mill-wheel, he asked him whether he had got: any coins at all on him. Dodin replied that he had a game-bag full of them and that he was not to worry about his promise to provide him with a new habit. “What!” said Frère Couscoil. “You know there’s a special section in our Rule which rigorously forbids us to carry any money on our persons. Cursed are you for making me sin in this matter! Why didn’t you leave your purse with the miller? You shall be punished for it here and now, without fail. And if ever I get my hands on you in our chapter at Mirebeau you will be flagellated from Have mercy upon me down to bullocks upon thine altar.” ‘Then he dumps his load and pitches Dodin head first into the deep.","This money’d Fellow meeting at the very Brink of the Bank of the Ford, with Fryar Adam Crankcod, a Franciscan Observantin of Mirebeau, promised him a new Frock, provided, that in the transporting of him over the Water, he would bear him upon his Neck and Shoulders, after the manner of carrying dead Goats: for he was a lusty, strong-limb’d, sturdy Rogue. The Condition being agreed upon, Friar Crankcod trusseth himself up to his very Ballocks, and layeth upon his Back like a fair little Saint Christopher, the load of the said Supplicant Dodin, and so carry’d him gayly and with a good Will; as Æneas bore his Father Anchises through the Conflagration of Troy, singing in the mean while a prety Ave maris Stella. When they were in the very deepest place of all the Foord, a little above the Master-wheel of the Water-Mill, he asked if he had any Coin about him. Yes, (quoth Dodin) a whole Bag full; and that he needed not to mistrust his Ability in the performance of the Promise, which he had made unto him concerning a new Frock. How! (quoth Friar Crankcod) thou knowest well enough , that by the express Rules, Canons and Injunctions of our Order, we are forbidden to carry on us any kind of Money: Thou art truly unhappy, for having made me in this point to commit a heinous Trespass. Why didst thou not leave thy Purse with the Miller? Without fail thou shalt presently receive thy Reward for it; and if ever hereafter I may but lay hold upon thee within the Limits of our Chancel at Mirebeau, thou shalt have the Miserere even to the Vitulos.

Là oyait[8] vingt et six ou trente messes. Ce pendant venait son diseur d’heures en place, empaletoqué[9] comme une dupe[10], et très bien antidoté son haleine à force sirop vignolat[11].

Au partir de l’église, on lui amenait, sur une traîne[13] à bœufs, un farat[14] de patenôtres de Saint-Claude, aussi grosses chacune qu’est le moule d’un bonnet[15], et, se pormenant par les cloîtres, galeries ou jardin, en disait plus que seize ermites.","After having breakfasted well, went to church, and they brought to him, in a large basket, a large breviary swaddled[6], weighing, both in grease and in clasps and parchment, a little more or less[7 ], eleven quintals six pounds. There were [8] twenty-six or thirty masses. This pendant came with its hour-teller in place, impaletoqué[9] like a dupe[10], and very well antidoted its breath with forceful vignolat syrup[11]. With it he mumbled all his kyrielles, and peeled them so curiously[12] that not a single grain fell into the ground. From the church, they brought to him, on an ox cart[13], a farat[14] of patenôtres de Saint-Claude, each as big as the mold of a bonnet[15], and, walking through the cloisters, galleries or garden, said more than sixteen hermits.","So, having eaten a proper breakfast, Gargantua would go to church, and they would carry for him in a huge basket a fat breviary, snugly slippered in its sleeve, which (what with grease, clasps and parchment) weighed some eleven hundredweight [and six pounds]. There he would hear some twenty-six or thirty Masses. Meanwhile his private chaplain would arrive, swaddled up like a hoopoe-bird and having already taken copiously for his breath plenty of medicinal syrup from the grape. With him Gargantua would mumble all his responses, shelling them so carefully that not one grain fell to the ground. As he left church they would bring him, on an ox-drawn dray, a jumble of Saint-Claude rosaries, each bead of which was as big as your noddle; then, wandering through the cloisters, galleries and gardens, he would tell more beads than sixteen hermits.","After that he had throughly broke his fast, he went to Church, and they carried to him in a great basket, a huge impantoufled or thick-covered breviary, weighing what in grease, clasps, parchment and cover, little more or lesse then eleven hundred and six pounds. There he heard six and twenty or thirty Masses: This while, to the same place came his orison-mutterer impaletocked, or lap’t up about the chin, like a tufted whoop, and his breath pretty well antidoted with store of the Vine-tree-sirrup: with him he mumbled all his Kiriels, and dunsical breborions, which he so curiously thumbed and fingered, that there fell not so much as one graine to the ground; as he went from the Church, they brought him upon a Dray drawn with oxen, a confused heap of Patinotres and Aves of Sante Claude, every one of them being of the bignesse of a hat-block; and thus walking through the cloysters, galleries or garden, he said more in turning them over, then sixteen Hermites would have done."

If anything bad happened to me, what would it be?","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","The next day he came to the Church, at the time that she went to Masse, at the door he gave her some of the holy water, bowing himself very low before her, afterwards he kneeled down by her very familiarly, and said unto her, Madam, know that I am so amorous of you, that I can neither pisse nor dung for love: I do not know (Lady,) what you mean, but if I should take any hurt by it, how much would you be to blame?

Have you got nothing to say, for Gold’s sake?’ Panurge replied: ‘I can clearly see, Good Gold, by the devil! that the plague lurks for us in here, since here, Good Gold by the devil! innocence is not safe and the devil sings Masses. Allow me, I beg you, to pay for the lot, and then let us go, Good Gold by the devil! I can stand no more, Good Gold by the devil!’","GRIPE-MEN-ALL, as if he had not heard what Fryar Jhon said, directed his Discourse to Panurge, saying to him, Well, what have you to say for your self, Mr. Rogue-enough, hah! Give, give me out of hand—an Answer. Say! quoth Panurge, why, what would you have me say? I say, that we are damnably beshit, since you give no heed at all to the Equity of the Plea, and the Devil sings among you; let this Answer serve for all, I beseech you, and let us go about our business; I am no longer able to hold out, as gad shall judge me."
"« Entre les éléments ne sera symbolisation, alternation, ni transmutation aucune, car l’un ne se réputera obligé à l’autre : il ne lui avait rien prêté. De terre ne sera faite eau ; l’eau en air ne sera transmuée ; de l’air ne sera fait feu ; le feu n’échauffera la terre. La terre rien ne produira que monstres, titans, aloïdes[20], géants ; il n’y pleuvra pluie, n’y luira lumière, n’y ventera vent, n’y sera été ni automne. Lucifer se déliera et sortant du profond d’enfer avec les Furies, les Peines et diables cornus, voudra déniger[21] des cieux tous les dieux, tant des majeurs comme des mineurs peuples.","“Between the elements there will be no symbolization, alternation, or transmutation, because one will not be deemed to be obliged to the other: he had lent it nothing. Of earth shall not be made water; water into air will not be transmuted; air will be fired; the fire will not heat the earth. The earth will produce nothing but monsters, titans, aloids[20], giants; there will be no rain, no light, no wind, no summer or autumn. Lucifer will untie himself and coming out of the depths of hell with the Furies, the Sorrows and horned devils, will want to denigrate[21] from the heavens all the gods, both major and minor peoples.","‘Between the elements there will be no mutual sharing of qualities, no alternation, no transmutation whatsoever: one will not think itself obliged to the other: it has lent it nothing. From earth no longer will water be made, nor water transmuted into air; from air fire will not be made, and fire will not warm the earth. Earth will bring forth nothing but monsters, Titans, [Aloidae,] giants. The rain will not rain, the light will shed no light, the wind will not blow, and there will be no summer, no autumn. Lucifer will tear off his bonds and, sallying forth from deepest Hell with the Furies, the Vengeances and the hornèd devils, will seek to turf the gods of both the greater and the lesser nations out from their nests in the heavens.","There would likeways be in such a World no manner of Symbolization, Alteration, nor Transmutation amongst the Elements; for the one will not esteem it self obliged to the other, as having borrowed nothing at all from it.

"Ces paroles dites, se retira en sa tanière, et sur le perron de la porte se retroussa, robe, cotte et chemise, jusques aux aisselles, et leur montrait son cul. Panurge l’aperçut, et dit à Épistémon : « Par le sambreguoy de bois ! voilà le trou de la sibylle[19]. » Soudain elle barra sur soi la porte : depuis ne fut vue. Ils coururent après les feuilles et les recueillirent, mais non sans grand labeur, car le vent les avait écartées par les buissons de la vallée, et, les ordonnant l’une après l’autre, trouvèrent cette sentence en mètres[20] :","Having said these words, she retired to her den, and on the steps of the door rolled up her dress, coat and shirt, up to her armpits, and showed them her ass. Panurge saw him, and said to Epistemon: “By the wooden sambreguoy! here is the hole of the sibyl[19]. Suddenly she barred the door behind her: she had not been seen since. They ran after the leaves and collected them, but not without great labor, for the wind had blown them away through the bushes of the valley, and, ordering them one after another, found this sentence in meters[20]:","With those words she withdrew to her den; on the threshold of the door she drew her kirtle, petticoat and shift right up to her armpits and showed them her bum. Panurge observed it and said to Epistemon, ‘By the blood of the wooden Ox: Behold! The Hole of the Sybil.’ She suddenly bolted the door behind her and was never seen again. They chased after the leaves and gathered them up, but not without difficulty, for the wind had scattered them all over the bushes down in the valley. Then, after setting them in the right order leaf by leaf, they found the following verdict in verse:","No sooner had she done thus speaking, when she did withdraw her self unto her lurking Hole, where, on the upper Seat of the Porch, she tucked up her Gown, her Coats and Smock, as high as her Arm-pits, and gave them a full inspection of the Nockandroe: which being perceived by Panurge, he said to Epistemon, Gods Bodekins, I see the Sibyl’s Hole. She suddenly then bolted the Gate behind her, and was never since seen any more. They jointly ran in hast after the fallen and dispersed Leaves, and gathered them at last, though not without great labour and toyl, for the Wind had scattered them amongst the Thorn-bushes of the Valley. When they had ranged them each after other in their due Places, they found out their Sentence, as it is metrified in this"
"Panurge n’avait ce mot achevé, quand Épistémon à haute voix s’écria, disant : « Chose bien commune et vulgaire entre les humains est le malheur d’autrui entendre, prévoir, connaître et prédire. Mais, ô que chose rare est son malheur propre prédire, connaître, prévoir et entendre, et que prudemment le figura Esope en ses apologues, disant chacun homme, en ce monde naissant, une besace au cou porter, on[15] sachet de laquelle devant pendant sont les fautes et malheurs d’autrui, toujours exposées à notre vue et connaissance : on sachet derrière pendant sont les fautes et malheurs propres, et jamais ne sont vues ni entendues, fors de ceux qui des cieux ont le bénévole aspect[16]. »","Panurge had not finished this word, when Epistemon exclaimed aloud, saying: “A very common and vulgar thing among humans is the misfortune of others to hear, foresee, know and predict. But, oh, what a rare thing is his own misfortune to predict, know, foresee and hear, and how prudently Aesop depicted him in his apologues, saying each man, in this nascent world, a bag around his neck to wear, one [15] bag of which before during are the faults and misfortunes of others, always exposed to our sight and knowledge: one bag behind during are the own faults and misfortunes, and never are seen nor heard, except for those who from the heavens have the benevolent aspect[16 ]. »","Panurge had not finished the last word when Epistemon cried out in a loud voice, saying: ‘To know, foresee, recognize and predict the woes of others is, amongst human beings, common and ordinary: but O! how rare it is one’s own woes to predict, recognize, foresee and know. And how wisely did Aesop illustrate that in his fables, saying that every man is born into this world with a beggar’s-wallet over his shoulder; in the pouch hanging down in front are kept the faults and defects of others forever exposed to our gaze and knowledge: in the pouch hanging down behind are kept our own faults and defects, where never are they seen nor known save by those to whom the heavens show a benevolent aspect.’ How Pantagruel counsels Panurge to consult the Sybil of Panzoust CHAPTER 16 [Panzoust is a village in the pays of Rabelais, between Chinon and I’lle-Bouchard. The principal Mosaic text for condemning the consulting of witches is Deuteronomy 17:10–11. Thomas Aquinas cites it twice when distinguishing between licit and illicit means of divination. An Old Testament savour is provided by the allusions to Tobias and the angel (Tobit 3:14) and to the ‘shekel of the Sanctuary’ (mentioned several times in Numbers 7). Alexander’s incredulity is taken from Lucian’s","Panurge had no sooner done speaking, than Epistemon with a loud Voice said these Words: It is a very ordinary and common thing amongst Men to conceive, foresee, know and presage the misfortune, bad luck or disaster of another; but to have the understanding, providence, knowledge and prediction of a Man’s own mishap is very scarce and rare to be found any where. This is exceeding judiciously and prudently deciphered by Esop in his Apologues, who there affirmeth, That every Man in the World carrieth about his Neck a Wallet, in the Fore-bag whereof were contained the Faults and Mischances of others, always exposed to his view and knowledge; and in the other Scrip thereof, which hangs behind, are kept the Bearers proper Transgressions, and inauspicious Adventures, at no time seen by him, nor thought upon, unless he be a Person that hath a favourable Aspect from the Heavens."
« Ainsi périsse qui féaux serviteurs blâmera. »,“Thus perish whoever faithful servants shall blame. »,"Then, drawing his sword from the body, he frankly exclaimed, ‘Thus perish all who loyal vassals blame!’","Touchefaucet being at these words very impatient, drew out his sword, and therewith ran Rashcalf through the body, a little under the nipple of his left side, whereof he died presently, and pulling back his sword out of his body, said boldly, So let him perish, that shall a faithful servant blame."
"« C’est, dit Épistémon, naïvement[1] parlé en moine. Je dis moine moinant, je ne dis pas moine moiné. Vraiment vous me réduisez en mémoire ce que je vis et ouïs en Florence, il y a environ vingt ans. Nous étions bien bonne compagnie de gens studieux, amateurs de pérégrinité[2] et convoiteux de visiter les gens doctes, antiquités et singularités d’Italie. Et lors curieusement contemplions l’assiette et beauté de Florence, la structure du dôme, la somptuosité des temples et palais magnifiques, et entrions en contention[3] qui plus aptement les extollerait[4] par louanges condignes[5], quand un moine d’Amiens, nommé Bernard Lardon, comme tout fâché et monopolé[6], nous dit : « Je ne sais que diantre vous trouvez ici tant à louer. J’ai aussi bien contemplé comme vous et ne suis aveugle plus que vous. Et puis, qu’est-ce ? Ce sont belles maisons. C’est tout. Mais, Dieu et monsieur saint Bernard, notre bon patron, soit avec nous, en toute cette ville encore n’ai-je vu une seule rôtisserie et y ai curieusement[7] regardé et considéré, voire ; je vous dis, comme épiant et prêt à compter et nombrer tant à dextre comme à senestre, combien et de quel côté plus nous rencontrerions de rôtisseries rôtissantes. Dedans Amiens, en moins de chemin quatre fois, voire trois, qu’avons fait en nos contemplations, je vous pourrais montrer plus de quatorze rôtisseries antiques et aromatisantes. Je ne sais quel plaisir avez pris voyants les lions et africanes (ainsi nommiez-vous, ce me semble, ce qu’ils appellent tigres) près le beffroi ; pareillement voyants les porcs-épics et autruches on[8] palais du seigneur Philippe Strossi. Par foi ! nos fieux, j’aimerais mieux voir un bon et gras oison en broche. Ces porphyres, ces marbres sont beaux. Je n’en dis point de mal, mais les darioles[9] d’Amiens sont meilleures à mon goût. Ces statues antiques sont bien faites, je le veux croire ; mais par saint Ferréol d’Abbeville ; les jeunes bachelettes de nos pays sont mille fois plus avenantes.","“It is, says Epistemon, naively[1] spoken as a monk. I say moinant monk, I don't say moiné monk. Really you reduce to my memory what I saw and heard in Florence, about twenty years ago. We were very good company of studious people, lovers of peregrination [2] and eager to visit learned people, antiquities and singularities of Italy. And then curiously contemplated the trim and beauty of Florence, the structure of the dome, the sumptuousness of the magnificent temples and palaces, and entered into contention[3] which would more aptly extoll them[4] by concordant praises[5], when a monk d'Amiens, named Bernard Lardon, as if quite angry and monopolized[6], tells us: ""I don't know what the hell you find here so much to praise."" I have contemplated as well as you and am no more blind than you. And then, what? These are beautiful houses. That's all. But, God and Mr. Saint Bernard, our good patron, be with us, in all this city I have not yet seen a single rotisserie and have curiously [7] looked and considered, even; I tell you, as if watching and ready to count and number both dexter and sinister, how many and on which side we would meet more roasting rotisseries. Inside Amiens, in less than four times, or even three times, than we have done in our contemplations, I could show you more than fourteen ancient and aromatic rotisseries. I do not know what pleasure you took seeing the lions and africanes (thus you called, it seems to me, what they call tigers) near the belfry; similarly seeing the porcupines and ostriches on[8] the palace of Lord Philippe Strossi. Sometimes ! our fiends, I would rather see a good, fat gosling on a spit. These porphyries, these marbles are beautiful. I don't say anything bad about it, but the darioles[9] of Amiens are better to my taste. These ancient statues are well made, I want to believe; but by Saint Ferréol d'Abbeville; the young bachelors of our countries are a thousand times more attractive.","CHAPTER 11] [There is no chapter-break here in ‘48. The monk from Amiens has an appropriate name, Lardon (Rasher). Rabelais is indebted to Erasmus for the anecdote about Antigonus. See his Apophthegms, IV, Antigonus King of Macedonia, 17.] ‘Spoken like a monk born!’ said Epistemon. ‘I mean a monking monk, not a monkèd monk. You do in fact remind me of what I heard and saw some twenty years ago in Florence. We formed a goodly fellowship of studious folk, lovers of travel and keen on visiting the learned men of Italy, the antiquities and the curiosities. We were duly admiring the site and beauty of Florence, the structure of the Duomo, the splendour of the churches and the magnificent palaces, and were outdoing each other to see who could most properly extol them with condign praises, when a monk from Amiens called Bernard Lardon said to us, all irritated as though we had ganged-up against him, ‘I don’t know what the devil you find to praise so much here! I’ve gazed at it all as much as you have and am no more blind than you are. But what of it? There are fine houses, that’s all. But (God and our good patron saint my lord Saint Bernard be with us!) I’ve yet to find one single roast-meatery in all this town. [And I have diligently looked, hunted about and – yes, I tell you – searched as though I were a spy keen to list and count how many roasting roasteries we could find on the right and on the left, and on which side.] ‘Why, in Amiens, covering four times less ground than we did when looking at things here [– well, three times less –] I could show you more than fourteen roasteries [which are ancient and fragrant]. I don’t know what pleasure you took over by the Belfry while gazing at those lions and africans (the name, I think, you gave to what the people here call tigers), as likewise at the porcupines and ostriches on the palace of Signor Filippo Strozzi.24 By my faith, me boys, I would prefer one good, fat gosling on a spit. All that porphyry and marble is beautiful. I’ve nothing to say against them, but those flans of Amiens called darioles, are [to my taste] better. ‘I’m prepared to believe that those ancient statues are well made, but by Saint Ferreol of Abbeville, the young wenches of our countryside are a thousand times more winsome!’","THIS, said Epistemon, is spoke like a true Monk I mean like a right Monking Monk, not a bemonk’d monastical Monkling. Truly you put me in mind of some passages that happen’d at Florence some twenty Years ago in a Company of studious Travellers, fond of visiting the Learned, and seeing the Antiquities of Italy, among whom I was. As we view’d the situation and beauty of Florence, the structure of the Dome, the Magnificence of the Churches, and Palaces, We strove to outdo one another in giving them their due; when a certain Monk of Amiens, Bernard Lardon by name, quite angry, scandaliz’d, and out of all Patience, told us: I don’t know what the Devill you can find in this same Town, that’s so much to be cry’d up; For my Part, I have look’d and por’d and star’d as well as the best of you , I think my Eye sight’s as clear as another body’s, and what can one see after all? There are fine Houses indeed, and that’s all. But the Cage does not feed the Birds: God and Monsieur St. Bernard our good Patron be with us, in all this same Town I have not seen one poor Lane of roasting Cooks, and yet I have not a little look’d about, and sought for so necessary a part of a Commonwealth; Ay, and I dare assure you that I have pry’d up and down with the exactness of an Informer; as ready to number both to the right and left how many and on what side we might find most roasting Cooks, as a Spy would be to reckon the Bastions of a Town: Now at Amiens, in four, nay five times less ground than we have trod in our contemplations , I could have shown you above fourteen Streets of roasting Cooks, most ancient, Savoury, and Aromatic. I can’t imagin what kind of pleasure you can have taken in gazing on the Lyons and Africans (so methinks you call their Tigers) near the Belfrey, or in ogling the Porcupines and Estridges in the Lord Philip Strozzi’s Palace. Faith and Troth, I had rather see a good fat Goose at the Spit. This Porphyry, those Marbles are fine; I say nothing to the contrary, but our Cheesecakes at Amiens are far better in my mind; These antient Statues are well made; I am willing to believe it; but by St. Ferreol of Abbeville, we have young Wenches in our Country which please me better a thousand times."
"– Le diable m’emporte, dit Panurge, si je ne deviens rêveur[2], et me puisse emporter[3] si je vous entends ! Attendez. Je mettrai mes lunettes à cette oreille gauche pour vous ouïr plus clair. »","“The devil take me,” said Panurge, “if I don't become dreamy[2], and can take me[3] if I hear you! Wait. I will put my glasses on this left ear to hear you more clearly. »",‘The devil take me if I’m not going raving mad!’ said Panurge; ‘and may he also take me if I know what you mean! Hang on. To hear you more clearly I’ll put my glasses to my left ear.’,"The Devil take me, quoth Panurge, if these odd Answers do not make me dote, and may he snatch me presently away, if I do understand you. Stay awhile until I fasten these Spectacles of mine on this left Ear, that I may hear you better."
"– Vous dites bien, répondit Épistémon ; mais jà ne me ferez entendre que chose beaucoup avantageuse soit prendre d’une femme, et d’une telle femme, en tel pays, conseil et avis.","“You say well,” answered Epistemon; but you will never make me understand that something very advantageous is to take from a woman, and from such a woman, in such a country, advice and advice.","‘You put it well,’ replied Epistemon, ‘but you will never convince me that it is very profitable to seek counsel and advice from a woman, especially from such a woman in that part of the world.’","You say very well, (answered Epistemon) yet shall you never for all that induce me to believe, that it can tend any way to the Advantage or Commodity of a Man, to take Advice and Counsel of a Woman, namely, of such a Woman, and the Woman of such a Country."
"Ainsi fut gouverné Gargantua, et continuait ce procès[21] de jour en jour, profitant comme entendez que peut faire un jeune homme, selon son âge, de bon sens, en tel exercice ainsi continué, lequel, combien que semblât pour le commencement difficile, en la continuation tant doux fut, léger et délectable, que mieux ressemblait un passe-temps de roi que l’étude d’un écolier.","Thus was governed Gargantua, and continued this process[21] from day to day, profiting as hear what a young man, according to his age, of good sense can do, in such exercise thus continued, which, however difficult it seemed for the beginning , in the continuation so sweet was, light and delectable, that better resembled a king's pastime than the study of a schoolboy.","And thus was Gargantua tutored, sticking to that course day after day, drawing such advantages as you know that an intelligent youth [of his age] can from practices thus persisted in: at first it did seem a bit hard, but sticking to it seemed pleasant, easy and delightful, resembling the pastime of a monarch rather than the curriculum of a schoolboy.","Thus was Gargantua governed, and kept on in this course of education, from day to day profiting, as you may understand such a young man of his age may of a pregnant judgement with good discipline well continued. Which although at the beginning it seemed difficult, became a little after so sweet, so easie, and so delightful, that it seemed rather the recreation of a King, then the study of a Scholar."

"– Je m’ébahis, dit Æditue continuant, si les mères de par delà les portent neuf mois en leurs flancs, vu qu’en leurs maisons elles ne les peuvent porter ne pâtir neuf ans, non pas sept le plus souvent, et leur mettants une chemise seulement sur la robe, sur le sommet de la tête leur coupants je ne sais quants[5] cheveux avec certaines paroles apotrophées[6] et expiatoires, comme entre les Égyptiens par certaines linostolies[7] et rasures étaient créés les Isiaques, visiblement, apertement, manifestement, par métempsychosie pythagorique, sans lésion ne blessure aucune, les font oiseaux tels devenir que présentement les voyez. Ne sais toutefois, beaux amis, que peut être, ne doit, que les femelles soient clergesses, monagesses ou abbegesses, ne chantent motets plaisants et charistères[8], comme on soûlait faire à Oromasis, par l’institution de Zoroastre, mais catarates et sytorpées[9], comme on faisait au démon Arimanian, et font continuelles dévotions de leurs parents et amis, qui en oiseaux les transformèrent, je dis autant jeunes que vieilles.","“I am amazed,” said Aeditue, continuing, “if the mothers from beyond carry them nine months in their flanks, seeing that in their houses they cannot carry them but suffer nine years, not usually seven, and putting them a shirt only on the dress, on the top of the head their cutting I do not know quant[5] hair with certain apotrophic[6] and expiatory words, as between the Egyptians by certain linostolies[7] and shaves were created the Isiacs, Visibly, openly, manifestly, by Pythagorean metempsychosis, without injury, without injury, make them become birds such as you see them now. Do not know, however, beautiful friends, that perhaps, must not, that the females be clergesses, monagesses or abbesses, do not sing pleasant motets and charistères[8], as one drunkenly did at Oromasis, by the institution of Zoroaster, but catarates and stunned[9], as one did to the demon Arimanian, and make continual devotions of their relatives and friends, who transformed them into birds, I say as young as old.","‘I am amazed,’ continued the Aedituus, ‘that mothers in that other world can bear their children nine months in the womb seeing that they cannot bear or abide them nine years in the home – not even seven years in most cases – but, by merely putting a surplice over their clothes and shaving Lord-knows how much hair off their crowns whilst uttering certain evil-averting, expiatory formulas, they clearly and openly turn them before your eyes into such Birds as you see here now by a Pythagorean metempsychosis, without lesion or gash of any kind, just as the priests of Isis were created amongst the Egyptians by tonsuring and the imposition of certain linen stoles. ‘But, dear friends, I cannot tell how it can be, nor why it must be, that the females (be they Clerickesses, Monkagesses or Abbégesses) never sing pleasant motets and songs of thankfulness as once were sung to Oromasis by the rule of Zoroaster, but rather songs of cursing and of gloom such as were addressed to the demon Ahriman, songs (sung continually by the young as much as the old) raining imprecations on their kinsfolk and friends who had transformed them into birds.","the Water go Nine Months with them; for they cannot endure them Nine Years, nay, scarce Seven, sometimes in the House: But by putting only a Shirt over the other Cloaths of the Young Urchins, and lopping off I don’t well know how many Hairs from their Crowns, mumbling certain apostrophis’d and expiatory words, they visibly, openly, and plainly, by a Pythagorical Metempsychosis, without the least hurt, transmogrify them into such Birds as you now see; much after the fashion of the Egyptian Heathens, who us’d to constitute their Isiacs, by shaving them, and making them put on certain Linostoles, or Surplices. However, I don’t know, my good Friends, but that these She-things, whether Clergkites, Monkites, and Abesskites, (that should not) instead of singing some plaisant Verses and Charisters, such as us’d to be sung to Oromasis by Zoroaster’s Institution, may be bellowing out such Cataretes and Scythropys, (curs’d, lamentable, and wretched Imprecations) as were usually offer’d to the Arimanian Dæmon; being thus in Devotion for their kind Friends and Relations, that transform’d them into Birds, whether when they were Maids, or Thornbacks, in their Prime, or at their last Prayers. But the greatest number of our Birds come out of Want-o’-bread, which tho’ a barren Countrey, where the days are of a most tedious lingring length, overstocks this whole Island with the lower Class of Birds."

Some whom I recognized in the troop were cutting fine figures: one of them was holding a map of the world which he was briefly explaining to them in short aphorisms; in no time they became learned scholars, and with a good memory for detail spoke about many marvels, to understand a hundredth part of which a man’s lifetime would not suffice: about the Pyramids, the Nile, Babylon, Troglodytes, Himantopodes, Blemmyae, Pygmies and Cannibals; about the Hyperborean Mountains, the Aegipans, and all the devils. And all from Hear-say.","About him stood an innumerable number of men and women, gaping, list’ning, and hearing very intensely; among ’em I observed some who strutted like Crows in a Gutter, and principally a very handsome bodied man in the Face, who held then a Map of the World, and with little Aphorisms compendiously explain’d every thing to ’em; so that those Men of happy Memories grew learned in a Trice, and would most fluently talk with you of a world of prodigious Things; the hundredth part of which would take up a man’s whole Life to be fully known. Among the rest, they descanted with great Prolixity on the Pyramids and Hieroglyphics of Egypt, of the Nile, of Babylon, of the Troglodytes, the Hymantopodes or Crumpfooted Nation, the Blœmiœ People that wear their Heads in the middle of their Breasts, the Pygmies, the Cannibals, the Hyperborei and their Mountains, the Ægypanes with their Goat’s-feet, and the Devil and all of others: every individual word of it by Hear-say.

"Avant qu’entrer en l’exposition de la Bouteille, je vous décrirai la figure admirable d’une lampe, moyennant laquelle était élargie[1] lumière par tout le temple, tant copieuse qu’encore qu’il fût souterrain on y voyait comme en plein midi nous voyons le soleil clair et serein luisant sur terre. Au milieu de la voûte était un anneau d’or massif attaché, de la grosseur de plein poing, auquel pendaient, de grosseur peu moindre, trois chaînes bien artificiellement faites, lesquelles de deux pieds et demi en l’air comprenaient en figure triangle une lame de fin or, ronde, de telle grandeur que le diamètre excédait deux coudées et demi-palme. En icelle étaient quatre boucles ou pertuis, en chacune desquelles était fixement retenue une boule vide, cavée[2] par le dedans, ouverte du dessus comme une petite lampe, ayant en circonférence environ deux palmes, et étaient toutes-de pierres bien précieuses, l’une d’améthyste, l’autre de carboucle[3] lybien, la tierce d’opale, la quarte d’anthracite. Chacune était pleine d’eau ardente, cinq fois distillée par alambic serpentin, inconsomptible[4] comme l’huile que jadis mit Callimachus en la lampe d’or de Pallas, en l’Acropolis d’Athènes, avec un ardent lychnion[5] fait, part de lin asbestin[6] comme était jadis au temple de Jupiter en Ammonie, et le vit Cléombrotus, philosophe très studieux, part de lin carpasien, lesquels par feu plutôt sont renouvelés que consommés[7].","Before going into the exhibition of the Bottle, I will describe to you the admirable figure of a lamp, by means of which was widened [1] light throughout the temple, so copious that even though it was underground one could see there as at high noon we see the clear and serene sun shining on the earth. In the middle of the vault was a ring of solid gold attached, the size of a full fist, from which hung, of a little less size, three chains very artificially made, which two feet and a half in the air comprised in triangular shape a blade of fine gold, round, of such size that the diameter exceeded two cubits and half a palm. In it were four loops or sluices, in each of which was fixedly fixed an empty ball, hollowed [2] in the interior, open above like a small lamp, having in circumference about two palms, and were all of very precious stones, one of amethyst, the other of Libyan carbuncle[3], the third of opal, the fourth of anthracite. Each was full of fiery water, five times distilled by a serpentine still, inconsumable[4] like the oil that Callimachus once put in the golden lamp of Pallas, in the Acropolis of Athens, with a fiery lychnion[5 ] made, part of linen asbestin[6] as was formerly in the temple of Jupiter in Ammonia, and saw Cleombrotus, a very studious philosopher, part of Carpasian linen, which by fire are rather renewed than consumed[7].","The whole chapter is influenced by the Dream of Polifilo of Colonna, sometimes closely.] Before I embark upon a presentation of La Bouteille I shall describe for you the wonderful form of a lamp by means of which light was widely shed over the whole temple so abundantly that even though we were under the ground we could see there as we can see the sun shining clear and serenely upon the earth at noon. In the middle of the vault was fixed a ring of solid gold, as thick as a clenched fist; from it hung three some-what smaller chains most skilfully forged, forming a triangle, some two-and-a-half feet up in the air, enclosing a fine golden disc of such a size that the diameter exceeded two cubits plus half a span. In it were four buckles or rings, in each of which was firmly held a hollow ball, scooped out and open at the top like a little oil-lamp measuring about two spans all round. They were all of very precious stones: one of amethyst, another of Libyan ruby, a third of opal, and the fourth of flaming garnet-stone. Each was full of eau-de-vie, five-times distilled in a serpentine alembic: it was as inexhaustible as the oil which Callimachus once placed in Pallas’ golden lamp in the Acropolis at Athens, with a burning wick made partly of asbestos-flax (as formerly in the temple of Jupiter Ammon where that most studious of philosophers, Cleombrotus, saw it) and partly of Carpasian flax (both of which are renewed by fire rather than consumed by it).","BEFORE I proceed to the Description of the Bottle, I’ll give you that of an admirable Lamp, that dispens’d so large a Light over all the Temple, that tho’ it lay under ground, we could distinguish every Object as clearly as above it at noon-day. In the middle of the Roof was fix’d a Ring of massive Gold as thick as my clench’d Fist. Three Chains somewhat less most curiously wrought, hang’d about two foot and a half below it, and in a Triangle supported a round plate of fine Gold, whose Diameter or Breadth did not exceed two Cubits and half a span. There were four holes in it, in each of which an empty Ball was fasten’d, hollow within, and open O’ top, like a little Lamp; it’s Circumference about two hands breadth. Each Ball was of Precious Stone; One an Amethyst, another an African Carbuncle, the third an Opale, and the fourth an Anthracites: they were full of burning Water, five times distill’d in a Serpentine Lymbeck, and inconsumptible like the Oyl formerly put into Pallas’s Lamp at Acropolis of Athens by Callimachus. In each of them was a flaming Wick of Asbestine Flax as of old in the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, such as those which Cleombrotus, a most studious Philosopher, and Pandelinus of Carpasium had, which were rather renew’d than consum’d by the Fire."
"– Vous, dit Gargantua, ne dites l’évangile, car il y en a sens devant et sens derrière, et les comptâtes trop mal.","“You,” said Gargantua, “do not tell the gospel, for there is a back and forth, and the count is too bad.","‘You’re not speaking Gospel truth,’ said Gargantua. ‘There’s a front to it in one sense and a back to it in the other sense: you got the cents all wrong!’","You do not speak Gospel (said Gargantua,) for there is sent before, and sent behinde, and you did not reckon them ill, considering the two under holes."

"À quoi tous ensemble dirent : « Laissez-nous y aller voir et nous attendez ici, car pour tout le jourd’hui, nous vous en apporterons nouvelles certaines.","To which all together said: ""Let us go and see and wait for us here, for all day long we will bring you certain news.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Let us therefore consult together, and bethink our selves by what meanes we may come to this intelligence: whereunto they all said, Let us go thither and see, and stay you here for us, for this very day, without further respite do we make account to bring you a certain report thereof."
"Or notez que le lendemain était la grande fête du corps-Dieu, à laquelle toutes les femmes se mettent en leur triomphe d’habillements, et pour ce jour, ladite dame s’était vêtue d’une très belle robe de satin cramoisi et d’une cotte de velours blanc bien précieux. Le jour de la vigile, Panurge chercha tant, d’un côté et d’autre, qu’il trouva une lycisque orgoose[1], laquelle il lia avec sa ceinture et la mena en sa chambre, et la nourrit très bien ce dit jour et toute la nuit. Au matin, la tua et en prit ce que savent les géomantiens grégeois[2], et le mit en pièces le plus menu qu’il put, et les emporta bien cachées, et alla à l’église où la dame devait aller pour suivre la procession, comme est de coutume à ladite fête. Et alors qu’elle entra, Panurge lui donna de l’eau bénite, bien courtoisement la saluant, et quelque peu de temps après qu’elle eût dit ses menus suffrages, il se va joindre à elle en son banc, et lui bailla un rondeau par écrit, en la forme que s’ensuit :","Now note that the next day was the great festival of the Body-God, at which all the women put on their triumph of clothing, and for this day, the said lady was dressed in a very beautiful dress of crimson satin and a coat of precious white velvet. On the day of the vigil, Panurge searched so much, on this side and on the other, that he found an orgoose lycisque[1], which he tied with his belt and led her to his room, and fed her very well, so to speak. day and all night. In the morning, killed her and took what the geomantians of Greece know [2], and cut it into pieces as small as he could, and carried them away well hidden, and went to the church where the lady was to go to follow the procession, as is customary at the said feast. And as she entered, Panurge gave her holy water, very courteously saluting her, and some time after she had said her petty suffrages, he went to join her in her pew, and gave her a yawn. rondeau in writing, in the form that follows:","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Now you must note that the next day was the great festival of Corpus Christi, called the Sacre, wherein all women put on their best apparel, and on that day the said Lady was cloathed in a rich gown of crimson-sattin, under which she wore a very costly white velvet petticoat. The day of the Eve (called the vigile) Panurge searched so long of one side and another, that he found a hot or salt bitch, which when he had tied her with his girdle, he led to his chamber, and fed her very well all that day and night ; in the morning thereafter he killed her, and took that part of her which the Greek Geomanciers know, and cut it into several pieces as small as he could; then carrying it away as close as might be, he went to the place where the Lady was to come along, to follow the Procession, as the custome is upon the said holy day; and when she came in, Panurge sprinkled some holy water on her, saluting her very courteously: then a little while after she had said her petty devotions, he sate down close by her upon the same bench, and gave her this roundlay in writing, in manner as followeth."

All true Christians, of all estates and conditions, in all places and at all times send up their prayers to God, and the Mediatour prayeth and intercedeth for them, and God is gracious to them.

Pantagruel had remained in his nave, and was already sounding the retreat. Doubting that they were related to the chicanous who had been beaten, we questioned the causes of such a complaint. They replied that there was a very equitable reason to weep, seeing that at the present hour the monk had been yawned on the gibbet by the neck of the two most worthy people who were in any case quibblers. “My pages,” said Gymnast, “gave the monk by the feet to their sleeping companions. To yawn the monk by the neck would be to hang and strangle the person.","Later on, when we were scouting for fresh water with the oarsmen from the galleys we came across two local old female Chicanous, pitifully weeping and lamenting together. Pantagruel had remained aboard his vessel and had already sounded the bell to rejoin ship. We, suspecting that these old women were relatives of the Chicanous who had been subjected to the beatings,36 questioned them about the causes of such lamentations. They replied that they had a most equitable cause for weeping: that very hour two of the most decent men there ever had been in all the territories of the Chicanous had been landed with the monk ‘by the neck’. ‘My pages,’ said Gymnaste, ‘land their sleeping comrades with the monk by their feet. To land the monk “by the neck” must mean to strangle a man by hanging.’","Sometime after, seeking fresh Water for the Ship’s Company, we met a couple of old Female Catchpoles of the place, miserably howling and weeping in Consort. Pantagruel had kept on Board, and already had caus’d a Retreat to be sounded. Thinking they might be related to the Catchpole that was bastinado’d , We ask’d them the occasion of their grief. They reply’d, That they had too much cause to weep; for that very hour, from an exalted Triple Tree, two of the honestest Gentlemen in Catchpole-land had been made to cut a Caper on nothing. Cut a Caper on nothing? said Gymnast, my Pages use to cut Capers on the Ground; to cut a Caper on nothing should be hanging and choaking, or I am out."
"Ces lettres reçues et vues, Pantagruel prit nouveau courage et fut enflambé[32] à profiter plus que jamais, en sorte que, le voyant étudier et profiter, eussiez dit que tel était son esprit entre les livres comme est le feu parmi les brandes, tant il l’avait infatigable et strident[33].","These letters received and seen, Pantagruel took new courage and was inflamed to profit more than ever, so that, seeing him studying and profiting, would have said that such was his spirit among the books as is the fire among the heaths, so indefatigable and strident was he.","All the halls, chambers and private rooms were hung with tapestries, varied according to the season of the year.","These letters being received and read, Pantagruel pluck’t up his heart, took a fresh courage to him, and was inflamed with a desire to profit in his studies more then ever, so that if you had seen him, how he took paines, and how he advanced in learning, you would have said that the vivacity of his spirit amidst the books, was like a great fire amongst dry wood, so active it was, vigorous and indefatigable."
"J’y vis un rhinocéros, du tout semblable à celui que Henry Clerberg m’avait autrefois montré, et peu différait d’un verrat qu’autrefois j’avais vu à Limoges, excepté qu’il avait une corne au mufle, longue d’une coudée et pointue, de laquelle il osait entreprendre contre un éléphant en combat, et d’icelle le poignant[7] sous le ventre, qui est la plus tendre et débile partie de l’éléphant, le rendait mort par terre.","I saw a rhinoceros there, quite like the one Henry Clerberg had formerly shown me, and differed little from a boar I had formerly seen at Limoges, except that it had a horn in its muzzle, long 'a cubit and point, which he dared to undertake against an elephant in combat, and from it the poignant[7] under the belly, which is the most tender and feeble part of the elephant, made him dead on the ground.","I also saw a rhinoceros there, exactly like the one that Henry Clerberg showed me some time ago, and hardly differing from a boar which I once saw at Limoges, save that it had a horn on its snout, pointed and a cubit long. It would dare to take on an elephant with it, sticking it into its belly during the fight (the belly being the softest and weakest part of an elephant) and throw it to the ground, dead.","I saw a Rhinoceros there, just such a one as Harry Clerberg had formerly shew’d me; methought it was not much unlike a certain Boar which I had formerly seen at Limoges, except the sharp Horn on its Snout, that was about a Cubit long; by the means of which that Animal dares encounter with an Elephant, that is sometimes kill’d with its Point thrust into its Belly, which is its most tender and defenceless part."

And so as he, wanting to ask King Louis the twelfth to ask for a control of the salt at Busançay for his brother, asked for a bagpipe, you, likewise, expecting[3] some woman of goodness and honor to marry, will marry a woman devoid of prudence , full of presumptuous wind, shrill and badly pleasant, like a bagpipe. Note further that he snarled at you from the bladder, and punched you on the spine; that foretells that she will be beaten, nasalized and stolen, as the pig's bladder was stolen from the little children of Vaubreton.","‘He also says that you will be the horn of the Buzançais bagpipes, that is to say, you will be blown like a horn, horn-piped and horny. And just as that fellow who intended to beg King Louis the Twelfth to grant the farming of the Buzançais salt-tax to one of his brothers but in fact asked for bagpipes, you, likewise, thinking to wed a good decent wife, will in fact wed a wife who is void of wisdom, blown up with arrogance and as nastily droning as bagpipes are. ‘Note moreover that it was with the pig’s bladder that he gave you a tweak on the nose and thumped you on the spine. That foretells that you will be beaten by her, bonked on the nose – and robbed, just as you robbed those little children in Vaubreton of their pig’s bladder.’","Moreover he says, that you will be the Hornepipe of Buzansay. That is to say, well horned, hornified and cornuted: And as Triboule’s Unkle asked from Lewis the Twelfth, for a younger Brother of his own who lived at Blois, the Hornepipes of Buzansay, for the Organ Pipes, through the mistake of one Word for another: Even so, whilst you think to marry a wise, humble, calm, discreet and honest Wife, you shall unhappily stumble upon one witless, proud, lowd, obstreperous, bawling, clamorous, and more unpleasant than any Buzansay-hornepipe. Consider withal, how he flirted you on the Nose with the Bladder, and gave you a sound thumping Blow with his Fist upon the ridge of the Back. This denotates and presageth, that you shall be banged, beaten and filliped by her; and that also she will steal of your Goods from you, as you stole the Hogs Bladder from the little boys of Vaubreton."

However, we went for strolls over that isle for the next few days to amuse ourselves and listen to the merry song of those favoured birds.","When Day peeping in the East, made the Sky turn from Black to Red, like a boiling Lobster, he wak’d us again to take a Dish of Monastical Browess. From that time we made but one Meal that only lasted the whole Day; so that I cannot well tell how I may call it, whether Dinner, Supper, Nunchion, or After-Supper; only to get a Stomach, we took a turn or two in the Island, to see and hear the blessed singing Birds."

"Il n’avait ces mots parachevés quand près de nous avolèrent vingt-cinq ou trente oiseaux de couleur et pennage qu’encore n’avais vu en l’île.

Some were white, others green, others red, others violets, others blue. “Who are these, asks Panurge, and what do you call them?","Those words had hardly been uttered before there came flying close by some twenty-five or thirty birds of a hue and plumage which we had not yet seen on that isle.

Beneath their left wings all of them had a mark like two diameters each bisecting a circle or like a perpendicular dropping on to a straight horizontal.

They had all under the Left Wing a Mark like two Diameters dividing a Circle into equal parts, or (if you had rather have it so) like a Perpendicular Line falling on a Right Line.

"En cetui temps, qui fut la saison de vendanges au commencement d’automne, les bergers de la contrée étaient à garder les vignes, et empêcher que les étourneaux ne mangeassent les raisins. Onquel[1] temps, les fouaciers de Lerné passaient le grand carroi[2], menant dix ou douze charges de fouaces à la ville.’ Les dits bergers les requirent courtoisement leur en bailler pour leur argent, au prix du marché. Car notez que c’est viande céleste manger à déjeuner raisins avec fouace fraîche, mêmement des pineaux, des fiers, des muscadeaux, de la bicane et des foirars[3] pour ceux qui sont constipés du ventre, car ils les font aller long comme un vouge[4], et souvent, cuidants peter, ils se conchient, dont sont nommés les cuideurs de vendanges.","At this time, which was the harvest season at the beginning of autumn, the shepherds of the country were guarding the vines, and preventing the starlings from eating the grapes. One time[1] the fouaces of Lerné passed the great carroi[2], leading ten or twelve loads of fouaces to the city.’ The said shepherds courteously required them to give them some for their money, at the market price. For note that it is celestial meat to eat at lunch grapes with fresh fouace, even pineaux, prouds, muscadeaux, bicane and féirars[3] for those who are constipated in the stomach, because they make them go as long as a vouge[4], and often, cuidants peter, they conchient, of which the cuideurs de vendanges are named.","Now at that time, (the beginning of autumn, the season of the vendanges) the local shepherds were guarding the vines and preventing the starlings from eating the grapes. At the same time the girdle-cake bakers of Lerné were just going over the great cross-roads leading ten or a dozen cart-loads of fouaces into the town. The said shepherds politely asked them to sell them some at the market-price, for note that it is a dish celestial to breakfast on fresh fouaces with grapes, especially the sauvignons, pineaux, muscadets or bicanes, and for those who are constipated, the foyrards which make them void turds as long as a stave: hence their nickname of ‘vendange-hopefuls’, since, hoping but to fart, folk thoroughly shit themselves.","AT that time, which was the season of Vintage, in the beginning of Harvest, when the countrey shepherds were set to keep the Vines, and hinder the Starlings from eating up the grapes; as some cake-bakers of Lerne happened to passe along in the broad high way, driving unto the City ten or twelve horses loaded with cakes, the said shepherds courteously intreated them to give them some for their money, as the price then ruled in the market; for here it is to be remarked, that it is a celestial food to eate for breakfast hot fresh cakes with grapes, especially the frail clusters, the great red grapes, the muscadine, the verjuice grape and the luskard, for those that are costive in their belly; because it will make them gush out, and squirt the length of a Hunters staffe, like the very tap of a barrel; and often-times thinking to let a squib, they did all-to-besquatter and conskite themselves, whereupon they are commonly called the Vintage-thinkers."
"Le dîner parachevé, nous prîmes congé d’Homenas et de tout le bon populaire, humblement les remerciants, et pour rétribution de tant de biens leur promettants que, venus à Rome, ferions avec le Père saint tant qu’en diligence il les irait voir en personne. Puis retournâmes en notre nef. Pantagruel, par libéralité et reconnaissance du sacré protrait[10] papal, donna à Homenas neuf pièces de drap d’or frisé sur frise, pour être apposées au-devant de la fenêtre ferrée, fit emplir le tronc de la réparation et fabrique tout de doubles écus au sabot[11], et fit délivrer à chacune des filles lesquelles avaient servi à table durant le dîner, neuf cent quatorze saluts d’or, pour les marier en temps opportun.","The dinner finished, we took leave of Homenas and all the good people, humbly thanking them, and as a reward for promising them so many goods that, having come to Rome, we would do with the Holy Father as long as he went to see them diligently. in person. Then we returned to our nave. Pantagruel, out of liberality and acknowledgment of the sacred papal protrait[10], gave Homenas nine pieces of cloth of gold curled on a frieze, to be affixed in front of the iron window, had the trunk filled with the repair and made everything from double écus au sabot[11], and had delivered to each of the girls who had served at table during the dinner, nine hundred and fourteen salutes d'or, to marry them in due time.","When the dinner was over we took our leave of Homenaz and all those good people, politely thanking them and promising that, in return for such kindness, we would, once in Rome, so deal with the Holy Father that he would speedily come to see them in person. We then returned to our ship. Pantagruel, out of generosity and in recognition of the sacred papal portrait, gave Homenaz nine pieces of cloth-of-gold, napped and friezed, to be hung before its iron-grilled window; he also filled their repair-and-fabric-fund box with Double-clog crowns,65 and caused nine hundred and fourteen Annunciation-crowns to be distributed to each of the maidens who had waited on them at table during dinner, to be used at the right time as a dowry. How on the high seas Pantagruel heard divers Words as they thawed out CHAPTER 55 [An ambitious chapter from Rabelais the mythologist. In a myth he reconciles the linguistic ideas of Aristotle and Plato (as did Ammonius Hermaeus in late Antiquity). Aristotle taught that onomatopoeias alone convey their meanings directly without that need to impose meanings on to sounds, which all other words require. But in the Cratylus Plato and Socrates taught that the true meanings of many words may be found in their etymologies because of the wisdom of those who invented those words. Rabelais hints that etymologies are important. Here the French word discours is thought of as being composed of the di of divisans (conversing) and of cours (short). Good discours is short talk. That etymology is transposed here, hinting that the English word discourse is formed from the dis of discreet and the course of intercourse. (Discourse is discreet verbal intercourse). He returns to similar hints in the last paragraph. Rabelais takes the platonizing doctrines of the philosopher Petron in Plutarch’s Obsolescence of Oracles (422B-F) and simplifies them to their (here serious) essentials: the Manor of Truth is, as it were, a celestial equilateral triangle in which dwell the Platonic Ideas (‘the Words, Ideas, exemplars and portraits of all things past and future’). For the ‘equilateral triangle’ cf. the three ‘Pierres’ in the Prologue and the stricken physeter in Chapter 34. It may be relevant that Plutarch states that the Pythagoreans called the equilateral triangle Minerva, that is, Athene, the goddess of Wisdom, and so a powerful symbol for the source of the Christian truths revealed in this episode (On Isis and Osiris, 381 F).","Dinner being over, we took our leave of the Right Reverend Homenas, and of all the good People, humbly giving thanks; and to make them amends for their kind Entertainment, Promised them that at our coming to Rome we would make our Applications so effectualy to the Pope, that he would speedily be sure to come to Visit them in Person. After this, we went o’ Board. Pantagruel, by an Act of Generosity, and as an Acknowledgment for the Sight of the Pope’s Picture, gave Homenas Nine pieces of double friz’d Cloth of Gold to be set before the Grates of the Window. He also caus’d the Church-Box for its Repairs and Fabrick, to be quite fill’d with double-Crowns of Gold, and order’d Nine hundred and Fourteen Angels to be deliver’d to each of the Lasses, who had waited at Table, to buy them Husbands when they could get them."

Being returned into his countrey, he called a Parliament, where all the Princes and States of his Kingdom being assembled, he shewed them the humanity which he had found in us, and therefore wished them to take such course by way of compensation therin, as that the whole world might be edified by the example, as well of their honest graciousness to us, as of our gracious honesty towards them.

And in such a case the minor cannot be fully restored to his former status, as Baldus clearly states, in the law : “The Praetor says”; final paragraph; Pandects: “Concerning minors”.’ How Pantagruel advises Panurge to foretell his good or bad fortune in marriage from dreams CHAPTER 13 [Divination from dreams held a place of honour in the Classical and biblical sources and authorities consulted by Renaissance scholars. Rabelais, following many other erudite authors including Erasmus, believed that a man or woman’s mind (or spirit) may leave its body in rapture or in dreams, or at least strive to do so.","There is no appellation (quoth Pantagruel) from the Decrees of Fate or Destiny, of Lot or Chance: as is recorded by our ancient Lawyers, witness Baldus, Lib. ult. Cap. de Leg. The reason hereof is, Fortune doth not acknowledge a Superiour, to whom an Appeal may be made from her, or any of her Substitutes. And in this case, the Pupil cannot be restored to his Right in full, as openly by the said Author is alledged in L. Ait prœtor, § ult. ff. H. de minor."

"Nous doutions[2] que fût Dodone avec ses chaudrons, ou le portique dit Heptaphone en Olympie, ou bien le bruit sempiternel du colosse érigé sur la sépulture de Memnon en Thèbes d’Égypte, ou les tintamarres que jadis on oyait autour d’un sépulcre en l’île Lipara, l’une des Éolides ; mais la chorographie n’y consentait. « Je doute, dit Pantagruel, que là quelque compagnie d’abeilles aient commencé prendre vol en l’air, pour lesquelles révoquer[3] le voisinage fait ce triballement[4] de poêles, chaudrons, bassins, cymbales corybantiques de Cybèle, mère grande des dieux. Entendons. » Approchants davantage, entendîmes, entre la perpétuelle sonnerie des cloches, chant infatigable des hommes là résidants, comme était notre avis. Ce fut le cas pourquoi, avant qu’aborder en l’île Sonnante, Pantagruel fut d’opinion que descendissions avec notre esquif en un petit roc auprès duquel reconnaissions un ermitage et quelque petit jardinet.","We doubted[2] that there was Dodona with its cauldrons, or the portico known as Heptaphone in Olympia, or the eternal noise of the colossus erected on the tomb of Memnon in Thebes of Egypt, or the din that formerly we heard around a sepulcher on Lipara Island, one of the Aeolids; but the chorography did not consent to it. “I doubt, says Pantagruel, that there any company of bees have begun to take flight in the air, for which to revoke[3] the neighborhood makes this tribally[4] of stoves, cauldrons, basins, corybantic cymbals of Cybele, mother great of the gods. Let's hear. Approaching nearer, we heard, between the perpetual ringing of the bells, the indefatigable song of the men residing there, as was our advice. This was the case why, before landing at the Sonnante Island, Pantagruel was of the opinion that we should go down with our skiff to a small rock near which we could recognize a hermitage and some small garden.","We wondered whether it was Dordona with its cauldrons, or the portico in Olympia called Heptaphone, or the never-ending noise emanating from the colossus erected over the tomb of Memnon at Thebes in Egypt; or else the racket that used to be heard around a grave in Lipara, one of the Aeolian Isles: but geography was against it. ‘I am wondering,’ said Pantagruel, ‘whether some bees have attempted to swarm there and whether the neighbourhood has not raised this clanging of pans, cauldrons, basins and corybantic cymbals of Cybele, the great Mother of the Gods, in order to summon them back. ‘Hark!’ As we drew nearer still we thought we could hear the indefatigable chanting of the inhabitants of the place amidst the ceaseless pealing of the bells. That is why Pantagruel decided that, before docking at Ringing Island, we should land with our skiff on an eyot hard by a hermitage and a sort of tiny garden.","I’ faith , I begin to smell you out. You are not yet dispos’d to give me an Answer; nor I neither, by these Whiskers. Yet to give some Light into the business, I’ll e’en tell you what had been anciently foretold in the matter, by a Venerable Doc, who being mov’d by the Spirit in a Prophetic Vein, wrote a Book eclip’d The Prelatical Bagpipe. What d’ye think the Old Fornicator saith? Hearken, you old Noddies, hearken now or never. The Jubilee’s Year, when all, like Fools, were shorn, Is about thirty (Trente) supernumerary. O want of Veneration! Fools they seem’d, But, persevering, with long Briefs, at last No more they shall be gaping greedy Fools: For they shall shell the Shrub’s delicious Fruit, Whose Flow’r they in the Spring so much had fear’d. L’an Jubilé que tout le monde raire Fadas se feist, est supernumeraire Audessus Trente, O peu de reverence! Fat il sembloit, mais, en perseverance De long Brevets, fat plus ne gloux sera; Car le doux fruict de l’herbe esgoussera Dont tant craignoit la fleur en prime vere. Now you have it, what do you make on ’t? The Seer is Ancient, the Style Laconic, the Sentences dark, like those of Scotus, though they treat of matters dark enough in themselves. The best Commentators on that good Father take the Jubilee after the Thirtieth, to be the years that are included in this present Age till 1550, [there being but one Jubilee every fifty Years.] Men shall no longer be thought Fools next Green Pease Season. The Fools whose Number, as Solomon certifies, is infinite, shall go to pot like a parcel of mad Bedlamites as they are; and all manner of Folly shall have an end, that being also numberless, according to Avicenna, Maniæ infinitæ sunt species. Having been driven back and hidden towards the Centre, during the rigour of the Winter, ’tis now to be seen on the Surface, and buds out like the Trees. This is as plain as a Nose in a man’s Face; you know it by experience, you see it. And it was formerly found out by that great good Man Hippocrates, Aphorism. Veræ etenim maniæ, etc. The World therefore, wisifying it self, shall no longer dread the Flower and Blossoms of Beans every coming Spring; that is, as you may believe, Bumper in Hand, and Tears in Eyes in the woful time of Lent, which us’d to keep them company. Whole Cartloads of Books that seem’d florid, flourishing and flowry, gay and gawdy as so many Butterflies; but in the main were tiresome, dull, soporiferous, irksome, mischievous, crabbed, knotty, puzzling, and dark as those of Whining Heraclytus, as unintelligible as the Numbers of Pythagoras, that King of the Bean according to Horace: Those Books, I say, have seen their best days, and shall soon come to nothing, being deliver’d to the executing Worms, and merciless Petty-Chandlers; such was their Destiny, and to this they were Predestinated. In their stead Beans in Cod are started up; that is, these Merry and Fructifying Pantagruelian Books, so much sought now-a-days, in expectation of the following Jubilee’s period; to the Study of which Writings all People have given their Minds; and accordingly have gain’d the Name of Wise. Now, I think, I have fairly solv’d and resolv’d your Problem; then reform and be the better for it. Hem once or twice like Hearts of Oak, stand to your Pan-puddings, and take me off your Bumpers, Nine go downs, and Huzza! since we are like to have a good Vintage, and Misers hang themselves: Oh! they ’ll cost me an Estate in Hempen Collars if fair Weather hold. For I hereby promise to furnish them with twice as much as will do their business, on free cost, as often as they will take the pains to dance at a Rope’s end, providently to save Charges, to the no small disappointment of the Finisher of the Law. Now my Friends, that you may put in for a share of this new Wisdom, and shake off the antiquated Folly, this very moment, scratch me out of your scrouls, and quite discard the symbol of the old Philosopher with the Golden Thigh, by which he has forbidden you to eat Beans: For you may take it for a truth granted among all Professors in the Science of good eating, that he enjoyn’d you not to taste of them, only with the same kind intent that a certain fresh-water Physitian had, when he did forbid to Amer, late Lord of Camelotiere, Kinsman to the Lawyer of that Name, the Wing of the Partridge, the Rump of the Chicken, and the Neck of the Pigeon, saying, Ala mala, Rumpum dubium, Collum bonum pelle remotâ. For the Dunsical Dog-leech was so selfish, as to reserve them for his own dainty Chops, and allowed his poor Patients little more than the bare Bones to pick, lest they should overload their squeemish Stomachs. To the Heathen Philosopher succeeded a pack of Capusions, Monks, who forbid us the use of Beans, that is, Pantagruelian Books. They seem to follow the Example of Philoxenus and Gnatho, Sicilians of fulsome Memory, the Ancient Master-Builders of their Monastick Cramgut Voluptuousness; who when some dainty Bit was serv’d up at a Feast, filthily us’d to spit on it, that none but their nasty selves might have the stomach to eat of it, though their lickerish Chops watered never so much after it. So those hideous, snotty, pthisicky, eves-dropping, musty, moving Forms of Mortification, both in publick and private, curse those dainty Books, and like Toads spit their Venom upon them. Now though we have in our Mother-Tongue several excellent Works in Verse and Prose, and, Heav’n be prais’d, but little left of the Trash and Trumpery stuff of those dunsical Mumblers of Avemaries, and the barbarous foregoing Gothick Age; I have made bold to chuse to chirrup and warble my plain Ditty, or as they say, to whistle like a Goose among the Swans, rather than be thought deaf among so many pretty Poets and Eloquent Orators. And thus I am prouder of Acting the Clown, or any other under-part among the many Ingenious Actors in that Noble Play; than of herding among those Mutes, who, like so many shadows and Cyphers, only serve to fill up the House, and make up a number, gaping and yawning at the Flies, and pricking up their Lugs, like so many Arcadian Asses at the striking up of the Musick, thus silently giving to understand, that their Fopships are tickled in the right Place. Having taken this Resolution, I thought it would not be amiss to move my Diogenical Tub, that you might not accuse me of living without Example. I see a swarm of our Modern Poets and Orators, your Collinets, Marots, Drouets, Saingelais, Salels, Masuels, and many more; who having commenc’d Masters in Apollo’s Academy on Mount Parnassus, and drunk Brimmers at the Caballin Fountain, among the Nine merry Muses, have rais’d our Vulgar Tongue and made it a noble and everlasting Structure. Their Works are all Parian Marble, Alebaster, Porphiry, and Royal Ciment, they treat of nothing but Heroick Deeds, Mighty things, grave and difficult matters, and this in a Crimson Alamode Rhetorical Style. Their Writings are all Divine Nectar, rich, racy, sparkling, delicate and luscious Wine. Nor does our Sex wholly engross this Honour; Ladies have had their share of the Glory: One of them of the Royal Blood of France, whom it were a Prophanation but to name here, surprizes the Age at once by her transcendent and Inventive Genius in her Writings, and the admirable Graces of her Style. Imitate those great Examples, if you can, for my part I cannot. Every one, you know, cannot go to Corinth. When Solomon built the Temple, all could not give Gold by handfuls. Since then ’tis not in my Power to improve our Architecture as much as they, I am e’en resolv’d to do like Renault of Montauban; I’ll wait on the Masons, set on the Pot for the Masons, cook for the Stone-cutters; and since it was not my good luck to be cut out for one of them, I will live and die the Admirer of their Divine Writings. As for you, little envious Prigs, snarling, bastard, puny Criticks, you’ll soon have rail’d your last: Go hang your selves, and chuse you out some well-spread Oak, under whose shade you may swing in state, to the admiration of the gaping Mob; you shall never want Rope enough. While I here solemnly protest before my Helicon, in the Presence of my Nine Mistresses the Muses, that if I live yet the Age of a Dog, ek’d out with that of three Crows, sound Wind and Limbs, like the old Hebrew Captain Moses, Xenophilus the Musicianer, and Demonax the Philosopher, by Arguments no ways impertinent, and Reasons not to be disputed, I will prove, in the teeth of a parcel of Brokers and Retailers of Ancient Rhapsodies, and such mouldy Trash, That our Vulgar Tongue is not so mean, silly, poor, and contemptible, as they pretend. Nor ought I to be afraid of I know not what Botchers of old thredbare stuff a hundred and a hundred times clouted up and piec’d together; wretched Bunglers, that can do nothing but new vamp old rusty Saws; beggarly Scavengers, that rake even the muddiest Canals of Antiquity for scraps and bits of Latin, as insignificant as they are often uncertain. Beseeching our Grandees of Witland, that, as when formerly Apollo had distributed all the Treasures of his Poetical Exchequer to his Favourites, little hulchback’d Æsop got for himself the Office of Apologuemonger: In the same manner, since I do not aspire higher, they would not deny me that of Puny Riparographer, or Riffraff-scribler of the Sect of Pyrrhicus. I dare swear they will grant me this; for they are all so kind, so good-natur’d, and so generous, that they’ll ne’er boggle at so small a Request. Therefore both dry and hungry Souls, Pot and Trenchermen, fully enjoying those Books, perusing, quoting them in their merry Conventicles, and observing the great Mysteries of which they treat, shall gain a singular Profit and Fame; as in the like case was done by Alexander the Great, with the Books of Prime Philosophy compos’d by Aristotle. O rare! Belly on Belly! what Swillers, what Twisters will there be! Then be sure, all you that take care not to die of the Pip, be sure, I say, you take my Advice, and stock your selves with good store of such Books, as soon as you meet with them at the Booksellers, and do not only shell those Beans in Cods, but e’en swallow them down like an Opiat Cordial, and let them be in you, I say, let them be within you : Then shall you find, my Beloved, what good they do to all clever Shellers of Beans. Here is a good handsome Basketful of them, which I here lay before your Worships; they were gather’d in the very individual Garden whence the former came. So I beseech you, Reverend Sirs, with as much Respect as e’er was paid by Dedicating Author, to accept of the Gift, in hopes of somewhat better against next Visit the Swallows give us. THE FIFTH BOOK CHAPTER I How Pantagruel arriv’d at the Ringing Island, and of the noise that we heard. PURSUING our Voyage, we sail’d three days without discovering any thing; on the fourth we made Land. Our Pilot told us, That it was the Ringing Island, and indeed we heard a kind of a confus’d and often-repeated Noise, that seem’d to us at a great distance not unlike the sound of great, middle-siz’d and little Bells rung all at once as ’tis customary at Paris, Tours, Gergeau, Nantes, and elsewhere on high Holidays; and the nearer we came to the Land, the louder we heard that Jangling. Some of us doubted that this was the Dodonan Kettles, or the Portico call’d Heptaphone in Olympia, or the Eternal humming of the Colossus rais’d on Memnon’s Tomb in Thebes of Egypt, or the horrid Din that us’d formerly to be heard about a Tomb at Lipara, one of the Eolian Islands. But this did not square with Chorography. I don’t know, said Pantagruel, but that some swarms of Bees here abouts may be taking a Ramble in the Air, and so the Neighbourhood make this dingle-dangle with Pans, Kettles, and Basons, the Coribanting Cimbals of Cybele, Grand-mother of the gods, to call them back. Let’s hearken! when we were nearer, among the everlasting Ringing, we heard the indefatigable Singing (as we thought) of some Men. For this Reason, before we offer’d to land on the Ringing Island, Pantagruel was of opinion that we should go in the Pinnace to a small Rock, near which we discover’d an Hermitage, and a little Garden."
"« Souvenir assez vous peut de la mansuétude dont ils usèrent envers les Bretons, à la journée de Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier et à la démolition de Parthenay. Vous avez entendu, et entendant admirez le bon traitement qu’ils firent ès barbares de Spagnola[3] qui avaient pillé, dépopulé[4] et saccagé les fins[5] maritimes d’Olonne et Talmondais. Tout ce ciel a été rempli des louanges et gratulations que vous-mêmes et vos pères fîtes lorsque Alpharbal, roi de Canarre, non assouvi de ses fortunes, envahit furieusement le pays d’Aunis, exerçant la piratique[6] en toutes les îles Armoriques et régions confines. Il fut, en juste bataille navale, pris et vaincu de mon père, auquel Dieu soit garde et protecteur. Mais quoi ? Au cas que les autres rois et empereurs, voire qui se font nommer catholiques, l’eussent misérablement traité, durement emprisonné, et rançonné extrêmement, il le traita courtoisement, amiablement, le logea avec soi en son palais et, par incroyable débonnaireté, le renvoya en sauf-conduit, chargé de dons, chargé de grâces, chargé de toutes offices d’amitié.","“You can remember enough of the leniency they showed towards the Bretons, on the day of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier and the demolition of Parthenay. You have heard, and hearing, admire the good treatment they gave to the barbarians of Spagnola[3] who had pillaged, depopulated[4] and sacked the maritime ends[5] of Olonne and Talmondais. All this heaven was filled with the praises and gratulations that yourselves and your fathers gave when Alpharbal, king of Canarre, not satisfied with his fortunes, furiously invaded the country of Aunis, exercising piracy[6] in all the Armoric islands and confined regions. He was, in just naval battle, taken and vanquished by my father, to whom God beware and protector. But what ? In the event that the other kings and emperors, even those who call themselves Catholics, had treated him miserably, harshly imprisoned, and ransomed extremely, he treated him courteously, amicably, lodged him with himself in his palace and, by incredible good-naturedness, the sent away safe-conduct, laden with gifts, laden with graces, laden with all offices of friendship.","‘You can well remember the clemency which they showed to the Bretons after the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier and the destruction of Parthenay. You have heard of the kindly treatment of the natives of Hispaniola – and hearing of it, have marvelled – for they had pillaged, laid waste and ravaged the maritime frontiers of Les Sables-d’Olonne and Le Talmondais. ‘Our very heavens were full of praises and thanksgivings offered by you and your fathers when Alpharbal, King of Cararre, not satisfied with his good fortune, madly invaded the lands of Aunis, acting the pirate amongst all the islands of Armorica and the neighbouring regions. He was defeated and taken in a regular sea-fight by my father, to whom God be Protector and Guard. ‘Why! Where other kings and emperors – indeed those who style themselves Catholic – would have treated him wretchedly, harshly imprisoned him and outrageously ransomed him, he treated him with courtesy, kindly lodging him in his palace and, with unbelievable affability, sending him home under a safe-conduct, laden with gifts, laden with benevolence, laden with every token of friendship.","You may very well remember of the courtesie, which by them was used towards the Bretons, in the battel of St. Aubin of Cormier, and at the demolishing of Partenay. You have heard, and hearing admire their gentle comportment towards those at the barreers of Spaniola, who had plundered, wasted and ransacked the maritime borders of Olone and Talmondois. All this hemisphere of the world was filled with the praises and congratulations, which your selves and your fathers made, when Alpharbal King of Canarre, not satisfied with his own fortunes, did most furiously invade the land of Onyx, and with cruel Piracies molest all the Armorick islands, and confine regions of Britanie; yet was he in a set naval fight justly taken and vanquished by my father, whom God preserve and protect. But what? whereas other Kings and Emperours, yea those who entitle themselves Catholiques, would have dealt roughly with him, kept him a close prisoner, and put him to an extream high ransom: he intreated him very courteously, lodged him kindly with himself in his own Palace, and out of his incredible mildnesse and gentle disposition sent him back with a safe conduct, loaden with gifts, loaden with favours, loaden with all offices of friendship: what fell out upon it?"
"Sur l’instant qu’on nous racontait cette histoire, eûmes l’avertissement que la vieille avait trompé le diable et gagné le champ.","As soon as we were told this story, we had the warning that the old woman had deceived the devil and gained the field.","At the very instant we were told this tale, we received news that the old woman had diddled the devil and won the field. And this is how: the devil came to the ploughman’s door, rang the bell and yelled, ‘Hey!","And just as they were telling us this story, News came that the old Woman had fool’d the Devil, and gain’d the Field: You may not be sorry perhaps to hear how this happen’d.

"Quoi voyant Pantagruel, galantement ses bras déplie, et, comme est l’art de la hache, lui donna du gros bout de son mât en estoc, au-dessus de la mamelle, et retirant le coup à gauche en taillade, lui frappa entre col et collet ; puis, avançant le pied droit, lui donna sur les couillons un pic du haut bout de son mât. À quoi rompit la hune et versa trois ou quatre poinçons de vin qui étaient de reste, dont Loupgarou pensa qu’il lui eût incisé la vessie, et, du vin, que ce fût son urine qui en sortît.","What seeing Pantagruel, gallantly outstretched his arms, and, as is the art of the axe, thrust him with the butt end of his mast, above the udder, and withdrawing the blow to the left in a slash, struck him between collar and collar; then, stepping forward with his right foot, gave him a pickaxe from the top end of his mast. At which the top broke and poured out three or four punches of wine which were left over, which Loupgarou thought he had cut into his bladder, and, wine, that it was his urine that came out.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Withal, he immediately cast at him out of his bark which he wore at his girdle, eighteen cags, and foure bushels of salt, wherewith he filled both his mouth, throat, nose and eyes: at this Loupgarou was so highly incensed, that most fiercely setting upon him, he thought even then with a blow of his mace to have beat out his braines: but Pantagruel was very nimble, and had alwayes a quick foot, and a quick eye, and therefore with his left foot did he step back one pace, yet not so nimbly, but that the blow falling upon the bark, broke it in foure thousand, fourescore and six pieces, and threw all the rest of the salt about the ground: Pantagruel, seeing that, most gallantly displayed the vigour of his armes, and, according to the Art of the axe, gave him with the great end of his mast a home-thrust a little above the breast; then bringing along the blow to the left side, with a slash struck him between the neck and shoulders : After that, advancing his right foot, he gave him a push upon the couillons, with the upper end of his said mast, wherewith breaking the scuttle on the top thereof he spilt three or foure punchions of wine that were left therein."
"Dessus les pieds chacun portait une boule ronde, parce qu’est dit fortune en avoir une sous ses pieds. Le cahuet[15] de leurs scaputions[16] était devant attaché, non derrière.

The cahuet[15] of their scapitions[16] was attached in front, not behind. In this way had their faces hidden, and laughed freely, so much fortune as the fortunate, no more and no less than our young ladies do when it is that they have their ugly hide-a-way which you call nose ringer: the old call it charity[17], because it covers a great multitude in them with sins. They also always had patent the posterior part of the head, as we have the face: that was why they went from belly or ass, as they liked. If they were going ass, you would have thought it was their natural look, both because of the round shoes and the previous fly, the back also shaved and roughly painted, with two eyes, a mouth as you see in the nuts indicated. If they went belly, you would have thought they were people playing chapifou[18]. It was nice to see them.","Each wore a round ball on his feet because Fortune is said to have one under hers. The back-flap of their cowls is not secured behind but in front, by which means they kept their faces concealed and could freely mock at Fortune and those whom Fortune favours, neither more nor less than maidens hiding behind their mask-uglies (which you call nose-mufflers and which men of yore call charity, because it covers a great multitude of sins).22 They always kept the back of their heads uncovered as we do our faces, which explains why they can travel as they prefer with either belly or bum to the fore. Whenever they went bum-wards you would have reckoned that to be their natural way of walking, as much from their round shoes as from the codpiece which went before them, together with the shaven face, coarsely painted behind, with its two eyes and mouth such as may be seen on Indian coconuts. When they went belly-wards you would have taken them for folk playing at blind-man’s-buff. It was a fine sight to behold!",As soon as may be? Fry. Right. Pan. Should he not be scalded first? Fry.

"À tant[1] se tut Bridoye. Trinquamelle lui commanda issir[2] hors la chambre du parquet, ce que fut fait. Alors dit à Pantagruel : « Raison veut, prince très auguste, non par l’obligation seulement en laquelle vous tenez par infinis bienfaits cetui parlement et tout le marquisat de Mirelingues, mais aussi par le bon sens, discret jugement et admirable doctrine que le grand Dieu dateur[3] de tous biens a en vous posé, que vous présentons la décision de cette matière tant nouvelle, tant paradoxe[4] et étrange de Bridoye, qui, vous présent, voyant et entendant, a confessé, juger on sort des dés.

If[5] you pray that it please path[6] as you think is legal and fair. »","Bridoye then fell silent. Trinquamelle ordered him to leave the court and said to Pantagruel once that was done: ‘Reason demands, most august Prince – not simply because of the bonds by which, through your infinite bounties, you bind this our Parlement to you as well as all the marquisate of Myrelingues, but also because of the good sense, discerning judgement and wondrous learning which almighty God, the Giver of all good gifts, has placed in you – that we should present it to you to decide what to do in this affair (so novel, so strange and paradoxical) of Bridoye who, with you in attendance and in your sight and hearing, acknowledged that he reached his judgements through the lottery of dice. We beg you to be so kind as to announce the verdict which seems to you judicious and equitable.’","WITH this Bridlegoose held his peace. Whereupon Trinquamelle bid them withdraw from the Court: Which accordingly was done; and then directed his Discourse to Pantagruel after this manner: It is fitting (most Illustrious Prince) not only by reason of the deep Obligations wherein this present Parliament, together with the whole Marquisate of Merlingues, stand bound to your Royal Highness, for the innumerable Benefits, which as effects of meer Grace, they have received from your incomparable Bounty; but for that excellent Wit also, prime Judgment, and admirable Learning wherewith Almighty God, the Giver of all Good Things, hath most richly qualified and endowed you, we tender and present unto you the Decision of this new, strange, and Paradoxical Case of Bridlegoose, who in your presence, to your both hearing and seeing, hath plainly confessed his final Judging and Determinating of Suit of Law, by the meer Chance and Fortune of the Dice: therefore do we beseech you, that you may be pleased to give Sentence therein, as unto you shall seem most just and equitable."

"– Ventre sur ventre, dit Panurge, serais-je bien Vulcain duquel parle le poète ? Non. Je ne suis ni boiteux, ni faux monnayeur, ni forgeron, comme il était. Par aventure, ma femme sera aussi belle et avenante comme sa Vénus, mais non ribaude comme elle, ni moi cocu comme lui. Le vilain jambe torte se fit déclarer cocu par arrêt, et en veute figure[8] de tous les dieux. Pour ce entendez au rebours. Ce sort dénote que ma femme sera prude, pudique et loyale, non mie[9] armée, rebousse[10] ni écervelée et extraite de cervelle comme Pallas, et ne me sera corival ce beau Jupin, et jà ne saucera son pain en ma soupe quand ensemble serions à table. Considérez ses gestes et beau faits. Il a été le plus fort rufian, et plus infâme cor... (je dis bordelier) qui onques fut, paillard toujours comme un verrat (aussi fut-il nourri par une truie en Dicte de Candie, si Agathocles Babylonien ne ment) et plus bouquin que n’est un bouc (aussi disent les autres qu’il fut allaité d’une chèvre Amalthée). Vertu d’Achéron, il belina pour un jour la tierce partie du monde, bêtes et gens, fleuves et montagnes : ce fut Europe. Pour cetui belinage[11], les Ammoniens le faisaient portraire[12] en figure de bélier belinant, bélier cornu. Mais je sais comment garder se faut de ce cornard. Croyez qu’il n’aura trouvé un sot Amphitryon, un niais Argus avec ses cent besicles, un couard Acrisius, un lanternier Lycus de Thèbes, un rêveur Agénor, un Asope flegmatique, un Lycaon pattepelue[13], un madourré[14] Corytus de la Toscane, un Atlas à la grande échine. Il pourrait cent et cent fois se transformer en cygne, en taureau, en satyre, en or, en cocu[15], comme fit quand il dépucela Junon, sa sœur, en aigle, en bélier, en pigeon, comme fit étant amoureux de la pucelle Phtie, laquelle demeurait en Ægie, en feu, en serpent, voire même en puce, en atomes épicuréiques, ou, magistronostralement[16], en secondes intentions. Je le vous grupperai[17] au cruc[18]. Et savez que lui ferai ? Corbleu, ce que fit Saturne au Ciel son père (Sénèque l’a de moi prédit, et Lactance confirmé), ce que Rhéa fit à Athys. Je vous lui couperai les couillons tout rasibus du cul. Il ne s’en faudra un pelet[19]. Par cette raison ne sera-t-il jamais pape ; car testiculos non habet.","– Belly on belly, said Panurge, am I really the Vulcan of whom the poet speaks? No. I am neither lame nor counterfeiter nor blacksmith, as he was. By chance, my wife will be as beautiful and comely as his Venus, but not ribald like her, nor me a cuckold like him. The ugly crooked leg had himself declared a cuckold by decree, and wanted a figure[8] of all the gods. For this hear backwards. This spell denotes that my wife will be prudish, modest and loyal, not armed[9], repulsed[10] nor brainless and brainless like Pallas, and will not be corrival to me this beautiful Jupin, and never will sauce his bread in my soup when together we would be at the table. Consider his gestures and beautiful deeds. He was the strongest rufian, and the most infamous cor... (I say brothel) who ever was, always bawdy like a boar (also he was fed by a sow in Dicte de Candie, if Agathocles Babylonien does not lie) and more of a book than a goat (also say the others that he was suckled from an Amalthea goat). Virtue of Acheron, he blessed for one day the third part of the world, beasts and people, rivers and mountains: this was Europe. For this belinage[11], the Ammonians portrayed him[12] as a belinant ram, a horned ram. But I know how to keep this nerdy out of it. Believe that he will not have found a stupid Amphitryon, a simpleton Argus with his hundred specs, a coward Acrisius, a lantern-maker Lycus of Thebes, a dreamer Agénor, a phlegmatic Asope, a Lycaon pattepelue[13], a curmudgeon[14] Corytus of Tuscany, an Atlas with a long spine. He could transform himself a hundred and a hundred times into a swan, a bull, a satyr, gold, a cuckold[15], as he did when he deflowered Juno, his sister, into an eagle, a ram, a pigeon, as he did being in love with the maiden Phtia, who remained in Ægia, in fire, in serpent, even in flea, in epicurean atoms, or, masterfully[16], in second intentions. I will grup it[17] for you at the cruc[18]. And know what he will do? Corbleu, what his father Saturn did in Heaven (Seneca predicted it from me, and Lactantius confirmed it), what Rhea did at Athys. I'll cut your assholes off your ass. It won't take a pelet[19]. For this reason will he never be pope; because testicles not habet.","‘Guts upon guts!’5 said Panurge. ‘ Am I to be a Vulcan such as our poet talks about! No! I’m not lame as Vulcan was, nor a coiner, nor a blacksmith. My wife will perhaps be as fair and comely as that Venus of his but not a slut as she was. Nor shall I be a cuckold. That ugly old hop-along was pronounced a cuckold by a sentence of all the gods and in view of them all. ‘Therefore take it to mean the contrary. The prognostic signifies that my wife will be decent, modest and loyal, not armour-clad, surly or brainless, nor a brain-child like Pallas; nor will handsome Jupiter be my rival, dipping his bread in my sauce when we sup together at table. Just think of his deeds and the fine things he got up to! He was the most debauched, the most franciscanly – I mean the most frankly – lecherous male there ever has been, as rutting as a wild boar. ‘Yes, and if Agathocles of Babylon is not lying, he was brought up more goatish than a goat by a sow on Dicte in Candia. Others say too that he was suckled by a nanny-goat called Amalthea. And then (by Acheron!) in one single day he rammed one-third of the entire world: beasts, humans, rivers and mountains – Europa, that is. On account of that ramification the Ammonians had him portrayed in the form of a ram rampant, a hornèd ram. ‘But I know how to protect myself from that horn-bearer. Believe you me: he will not find in me some stupid Amphitrion, some complaisant Argus with his hundred goggles, some cowardly Acrisius, some dreamer like Lycus of Thebes, some lunatic like Agenor, someone phlegmatic like Asopus, some hairy-pawed Lycaon, some yokelish Corytus of Tuscany, some long-spined Atlas. Well might he metamorphose himself hundreds of times into a swan, bull, satyr, shower of gold, cuckoo (as he did when he deflowered Juno, his sister), into an eagle, ram, [ pigeon, as he did when in love with that maiden Phthia who dwelt in Aegia,] fire, snake, even indeed a flea, into the atoms of Epicurus or, like a Magister Noster, into second intentions: I’ll nab ’ im with me ’ook.’ ‘And do you know what I shall do to him? Golly: what Saturn did to Coelus his father – Seneca foretold it of me and Lactantius has confirmed it – and what Rhea did to Atys: I will slice off his balls a hair’s breadth from his bum. For which reason he will never be pope, “because he hath no testiculos”.’","By the Belly of Saint Buff (quoth Panurge) should I be Vulcan, whom the Poet blazons! Nay, I am neither a Cripple, Coyner of False Money, nor Smith as he was. My Wife possibly will be as comely and handsome as ever was his Venus, but not a Whore like her, nor I a Cuckold like him. The crook-leg’d slovenly Slave, made himself to be declared a Cuckold, by a definitive Sentence, and Judgment, in the open view of all the Gods: For this cause ought you to interpret the aforementioned Verse quite contrary to what you have said. This Lot importeth, that my Wife will be honest, virtuous, chast, loyal, and faithful; not armed, surly, waiward, cross, giddy, humorous, heady, hair-brain’d, or extracted out of the Brains, as was the Goddess Pallas: nor shall this fair jolly Jupiter be my Corrival, he shall never dip his Bread in my Broath, though we should sit together at one Table. Consider his Exploits and gallant Actions, he was the manifest Ruffian, Wencher, Whoremonger, and most infamous Cuckold-maker that ever breathed: he did always lecher it like a Boar, and no wonder, for he was foster’d by a Sow in the Isle of Candia, ( if Agathocles the Babylonian be not a Lyar) and more rammishly lascivious then a Buck, whence it is that he is said by others, to have been suckled and fed with the Milk of the Amalthœan Goat. By the vertue of Acheron, he jusled, bulled and lastauriated in one day the third part of the World, Beasts and People, Floods and Mountains, that was Europa. For this grand subagitatory Atchievement, the Ammonians caused, draw, delineate, and paint him in the figure and shape of a Ram, ramming, and horned Ram. But I know well enough how to shield and preserve my self from that horned Champion: He will not, trust me, have to deal in my Person, with a sottish, dunsical Amphytrion; nor with a silly witless Argus, for all his hundred Spectacles; nor yet with the cowardly Meacock Acrisius; the simple Goosecap Lyrus of Thebes; the doating Blockhead Agenor; the flegmatick Pea-Goose Æsop; rough-footed Lycaon; the luskish mishapen Corytus of Tuscany, nor with the large-back’d and strong reined Atlas: let him alter, change, transform, and metamorphose himself into a hundred various shapes and figures; into a Swan, a Bull, a Satyr, a Showre of Gold, or into a Cuckow, as he did when he unmaiden’d his Sister Juno; into an Eagle, Ram, or Dove, as when he was enamour’d of the Virgin Phthia, who then dwelt in the Ægean Territory; into Fire, a Serpent; yea, even into a Flea, into Epicurian and Democratical Atomes, or more Magistronostralistically, into those sly Intentions of the Mind, which in the Schools are called Second Notions, I’ll catch him in the nick, and take him napping. And would you know what I would do unto him, even that which to his Father Cœlum, Saturn did, (Seneca foretold it of me, and Lactantius hath confirmed it) what the Goddess Rhea did to Athis ; I would make him two Stone lighter, rid him of his Cyprian Cimbals, and cut so close and neatly by the Breech, that there should not remain thereof so much as one ——, so cleanly would I shave him; and disable him for ever from being Pope; for Testiculos non habet."

"Arrivés au palais, contèrent à Pantagruel le discours de leur voyage, et lui montrèrent le dicté[1] de Raminagrobis. Pantagruel, l’avoir[2] lu et relu, dit: « Encore n’ai-je vu réponse que plus me plaise. Il veut dire sommairement qu’en l’entreprise de mariage chacun doit être arbitre de ses propres pensées et de soi-même conseil prendre. Telle a toujours été mon opinion, et autant vous en dis la première fois que m’en parlâtes. Mais vous en moquiez tacitement, il m’en souvient, et connais que philautie[3] et amour de soi vous déçoit. Faisons autrement. Voici quoi :","Arrived at the palace, told Pantagruel the discourse of their journey, and showed him the dictation[1] of Raminagrobis. Pantagruel, having[2] read and re-read it, says: “Again I have not seen an answer that pleases me more. He means summarily that in the business of marriage each must be the arbiter of his own thoughts and of his own advice. Such has always been my opinion, and so tell you the first time you speak of it to me. But you tacitly laughed at it, I remember, and know that philauty [3] and self-love disappoint you. Let's do it differently. Here's what:","The legal phrase ‘the dice of judgement’, used here in its usual, metaphorical sense, is soon to be developed in unexpected ways.] On arriving at the palace they gave to Pantagruel an account of their journey and showed him the ditty of Raminagrobis. Pantagruel read it once, read it twice, then said: ‘No reply so far has pleased me more. He means, in sum, that when venturing into wedlock each man must be the arbiter of his own thoughts and seek counsel from himself. That has always been my opinion and I told you as much when you first brought it up with me: but you quietly laughed, I remember, and I realized that your amour de soi – your philautia – vous déçoit. ‘Let us proceed otherwise. Here’s how.","NO sooner were they come into the Royal Palace, but they, to the full, made Report unto Pantagruel of the Success of their Expedition; they shew him the Response of Raminagrobis. When Pantagruel had read it over and over again, the oftner he perused it, being the better pleased therewith; he said, in addressing his Speech to Panurge , I have not as yet seen any Answer framed to your Demand, which affordeth me more Contentment: For in this his succinct Copy of Verses, he summarily, and briefly, yet fully enough expresseth, how he would have us to understand, that every one in the Project and Enterprize of Marriage, ought to be his own Carver, sole Arbitrator of his proper Thoughts, and from himself alone take Counsel in the main and peremptory closure of what his Determination should be, in either his assent to, or dissent from it. Such always hath been my Opinion to you; and when at first you spoke thereof to me, I truly told you this very same thing: but tacitly you scorned my Advice, and would not harbour it within your mind. I know for certain, and therefore may I with the greater confidence utter my conception of it, that Philauty, or Self-love, is that which blinds your Judgment, and deceiveth you. Let us do otherways, and that is this: Whatever we are, or have, consisteth in Three Things; the Soul, the Body, and the Goods:"
"Eux en ce pas descendants tous confus, il demanda :","They in this step descending all confused, he asked:","As they were making their way down in confusion, Gargantua asked them,","Judge you now, whether they had most cause, either to hide their heads for shame, or to laugh at the jest: as they were going down again thus amazed, he asked them, Will you have a whim-wham?"
"– J’entends bien, dit Pantagruel, vous inférez que gens de peu d’esprit ne sauraient beaucoup en bref temps dépendre[31]. Vous n’êtes le premier qui ait conçu cette hérésie.

You are not the first to conceive that heresy.

26. Comment Pantagruel raconte une pitoyable histoire touchant le trépas des héros,26. How Pantagruel tells a pitiful story about the demise of heroes,"CHAPTER 28 [In the last chapter the extreme length of life of 9720 years is supplied by Plutarch (415 E-D), but the method of reaching it is not clear to many today as the language of mathematics has fundamentally changed. Pantagruel’s statement of belief which closes that chapter is strictly orthodox, fully in accord with the recent insistence by the Church on the immortality of souls in the definitions and anathemas of the Bull Apostolici Regiminis of Leo X (1513). Rabelais is now ‘however’ to retell not a tale but an histoire, an historical event: the death of Pan vouched for by Plutarch’s professor of grammar, Epitherses. If that god Pan really did die in the sense of his soul’s having been snuffed out, then even the higher souls are mortal and come eventually to an end. But with a second ‘however’ Pantagruel will proceed to unveil the hidden truth. By inserting the word ‘god’ into his text – ‘the great god Pan is dead’ – Pantagruel opens the way for what is for Christians the only God truly to die, Jesus, and his death is no snuffing out into nothingness. The dying Lord who lies veiled behind Pan can be revealed by a deeper understanding of his name: behind Pan the Shepherd god (ΠAν) lies the great ‘Shepherd of the sheep’ of Hebrews 13:20; and there also lies Pan in the sense of All (ΠAν), for the crucified Lord is Pantagruel’s All, ‘in whom we live and move and have our being’, as he is for Paul and for Luke (Acts 17:28). To his other veiled sources Pantagruel adds Virgil in his Second Eclogue, 33 who is taken to mean that Pan (truly understood) ‘Takes care of the sheep and their pastors too’, of whom Rabelais was one.",CHAPTER XXVIII How Pantagruel related a very sad story of the Death of the Heroes.
"« J’eus un autre procès bien ord[19] et bien sale contre maître Fifi et ses suppôts, à ce qu’ils n’eussent plus à lire clandestinement, de nuit, la Pipe, le Bussart[20], ni leQuart des Sentences, mais de beau plein jour, et ce ès écoles de Sorbonne, en face de tous les théologiens, où je fus condamné ès dépens pour quelque formalité de la relation du sergent.","""I had another very orderly[19] and very dirty trial against Master Fifi and his henchmen, so that they no longer had to read clandestinely, at night, the Pipe, the Bussart[20], nor the Quart des Sentences, but in broad daylight, and this at the Sorbonne schools, in front of all the theologians, where I was sentenced to pay costs for some formality in the sergeant's report.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","I had another very filthy and beastly processe against the dung-farmer (called master Fifi) and his Deputies, that they should no more reade privily the pipe, punchon, nor quart of sentences, but in faire full day, and that in the fodder schools, in face of the Arrian Sophisters, where I was ordained to pay the charges, by reason of some clause mistaken in the relation of the Serjeant."

Fi! it's nothing worth it. So I took some mirobalans[6] which hung from a piece of tapestry; but I could neither chew nor swallow them, and the tastes would have properly said and sworn that they were twisted silk, and had no flavor. One would think that Heliogabalus there would have taken, like a transumpt[7] of a bubble, the form of feasting on those whom he had made fast for a long time, promising them a sumptuous, abundant, imperial banquet at the end, then feeding them with meats in wax, in marble , pottery, paintings and figured tablecloths.","‘Let us feed, then,’ I said, ‘feed and taste those anacampserotes dangling down over there.’ ‘Ugh! They are worthless!’ So I plucked some myrobolans which were hanging down near the edge of a tapestry, but I could neither chew them nor swallow them. If you were to try them you would rightly say and swear that they were nothing but twisted silken-thread and had no taste whatsoever. You would have said that Heliogabalus had found in them (as in a transcript from some papal bull) the model of those feasts which he arranged for those whom he had long kept fasting with promises of enjoying eventually a sumptuous, copious, Imperial feast, then feeding them with foods made of wax, marble or clay, and painted in pictures or on table-linen.","Pshaw, cry’d one, they are meer Trash, stark naught o’ my word, they’re good for nothing. I then went to pluck some Mirabolans off of a Piece of Tapistry whereon they hang’d, but the Devil a bit I could chew or swallow ’em, and had you had them betwixt your Teeth , you would have sworn they had been thrown Silk, there was no manner of savour in ’em. One might be apt to think Heliogabalus had taken a Hint from thence, to feast those whom he had caus’d to fast a long time, promising them a sumptuous, plentiful and imperial Feast after it: For all the Treat us’d to amount to no more than several sorts of Meat in Wax, Marble, Earthen-Ware, painted and figur’d Table-Cloths."
"– Alors, dit Gargantua, qu’on fit de votre nez une dille[19] pour tirer un muid de merde, et de votre gorge un entonnoir, pour la mettre en autre vaisseau, car les fonds étaient éventés.","""Then,"" said Gargantua, ""they made a dille of your nose to draw a muid of shit, and of your throat a funnel, to put it in another vessel, for the bottoms were stale.""","‘That time they made your nose into a spigot to draw off a vatful of pooh,’ said Gargantua, ‘and your gullet into a funnel to pour it off into another pan as the bottom was all smelly.’","Even then (said Gargantua,) when they made a shovel of your nose to take up a quarter of dirt, and of your throat a funnel, wherewith to put it into another vessel, because the bottom of the old one was out."
"Après souper nous retirâmes pour reposer. Le lendemain matin la reine nous octroya le choix d’une de ses lanternes pour notre conduite, telle qu’il nous plairait. Par nous fut élue et choisie la mie du grand M. P. Lamy, laquelle j’avais autrefois connue à bonnes enseignes. Elle pareillement me reconnaissait, et nous sembla plus divine, plus hilique[14], plus docte, plus sage, plus diserte, plus humaine, plus débonnaire et plus idoine qu’autre qui fût en la compagnie pour notre conduite. Remerciants bien humblement la dame reine, fûmes accompagnés jusqu’à notre nef par sept jeunes falots baladins, jà luisant la claire Diane.","After supper we retired to rest. The next morning the queen granted us the choice of one of her lanterns for our conduct, as we pleased. By us was elected and chosen the crumb of the great M. P. Lamy, whom I had formerly known with good signs. She likewise recognized me, and seemed to us more divine, more hilarious[14], more learned, wiser, more talkative, more humane, more good-natured, and more suitable than anyone else who was in company for our conduct. Humbly thanking the lady queen, we were accompanied to our nave by seven wandering young lanterns, already shining the clear Diana.","After supper we retired to rest.

"– Ne dea[3], répondit Panurge, frère Jean, mon couillon gauche, je te croirai. Tu vas rondement en besogne. Sans exception ni ambages tu m’as apertement dissolu toute crainte qui me pouvait intimider. Ainsi te soit donné des cieux toujours bas et raide opérer. Or donc à ta parole je me marierai.

There will be no fault, and if[4] will always have beautiful chambermaids when you come to see me, and will be protective of their sorority[5]. So much for the first part of the sermon.","‘No fear of that, Frère Jean,’ replied Panurge; ‘left bollock of mine, I believe you. You go roundly to work, you do. Without reservations or verbiage you have clearly dissipated any fear that might have intimidated me. And may the heavens grant you to serve the ball always hard and low. ‘All right then: upon your word I shall get myself married, and not play a fault. And I shall always have a few pretty chambermaids for you when you come to visit me: you will be the patron of their sorority. So much for the first part of the sermon.’","Nay truly (answered Panurge) Fryar Ihon, my left Ballock, I will believe thee, for thou dealest plain with me, and fallest down-right square upon the business, without going about the Bush with frivolous circumstances, and unnecessary reservations. Thou with the splendour of a piercing Wit, hast dissipated all the louring Clouds of anxious Apprehensions and Suspicions, which did intimidate and terrifie me: therefore the Heavens be pleased to grant to thee, at all She-conflicts, a stiff-standing Fortune. Well then, as thou hast said, so will I do, I will, in good Faith, Marry; in that point there shall be no failing, I promise thee, and shall have always by me pretty Girls clothed with the Name of my Wives Waiting-Maids, that lying under thy Wings, thou mayest be Night-Protector of their Sister-hood. Let this serve for the first part of the Sermon."
"Mais pour retourner aux noms, considérez comment Alexandre le Grand, fils du roi Philippe, duquel nous avons parlé, par l’interprétation d’un seul nom parvint à son entreprise. Il assiégeait la forte ville de Tyr et la battait de toutes ses forces par plusieurs semaines ; mais c’était en vain. Rien ne profitaient[13] ses engins et molitions[14]. Tout était soudain démoli et réparé par les Tyriens. Dont prit fantaisie de lever le siège, avec grande mélancolie, voyant en cetui département[15] perte insigne de sa réputation. En tel estrif[16] et fâcherie s’endormit. Dormant, songeait qu’un satyre était dedans sa tente dansant et sautelant avec ses jambes bouquines[17]. Alexandre le voulait prendre ; le satyre toujours lui échappait. Enfin, le roi le poursuivant en un détroit le happa. Sur ce point s’éveilla, et racontant son songe aux philosophes et gens savants de sa cour, entendit que les dieux lui promettaient victoire, et que Tyr bientôt serait prise, car ce mot satyros, divisé en deux, est sa Tyros, signifiant Tienne est Tyr. De fait, au premier assaut qu’il fit, il emporta la ville de force, et en grande victoire subjugua ce peuple rebelle. Au rebours, considérez comment, par la signification d’un nom, Pompée se désespéra. Étant vaincu par César en la bataille pharsalique, n’eut moyen autre de soi sauver que par fuite. Fuyant par mer, arriva en l’île de Chypre, près la ville de Paphos, aperçut sur le rivage un palais beau et somptueux. Demandant au pilote comment on nommait cetui palais, entendit qu’on le nommait Καχοσβασιλεα, c’est-à-dire Malroi. Ce nom lui fut en tel effroi et abomination qu’il entra au désespoir, comme assuré de n’évader[18] que bientôt ne perdît la vie, de mode que les assistants et nochers ouïrent ses cris, soupirs et gémissements. De fait, peu de temps après, un nommé Achillas, paysan inconnu, lui trancha la tête. Encore pourrions-nous, à ce propos, alléguer ce qu’advint à L. Paulus Æmilius, lorsque, par le Sénat romain, fut élu empereur, c’est-à-dire chef de l’armée qu’ils envoyaient contre Perses, roi de Macédonie. Icelui jour, sur le soir, retournant en sa maison pour soi apprêter au délogement, baisant une sienne petite fille nommée Tratia, avisa qu’elle était aucunement[19] triste : « Qu’y a il, dit-il, ma Tratia ? Pourquoi es-tu ainsi triste et fâchée ?","But to return to names, consider how Alexander the Great, son of King Philip, of whom we have spoken, by the interpretation of a single name arrived at his enterprise. He besieged the strong city of Tire and beat it with all his might for several weeks; but it was in vain. Nothing benefited[13] his engines and molitions[14]. Everything was suddenly demolished and repaired by the Tyrians. Who took it into his head to lift the siege, with great melancholy, seeing in this department [15] a signal loss of its reputation. In such estrif[16] and anger fell asleep. Sleeping, thought that a satyr was inside his tent dancing and jumping with his bookish legs. Alexander wanted to take him; the satyr always escaped him. Finally, the king, pursuing him in a strait, caught him. On this point awoke, and telling his dream to the philosophers and learned men of his court, heard that the gods promised him victory, and that Tire would soon be taken, for this word satyros, divided in two, is his Tyros, meaning Yours. is Tyr. In fact, in the first assault he made, he carried the city by force, and in great victory subjugated this rebellious people. In reverse, consider how, by the meaning of a name, Pompey despaired. Being vanquished by Caesar in the Pharsalic battle, he had no other means of saving himself than by flight. Fleeing by sea, arrived in the island of Cyprus, near the city of Paphos, saw on the shore a beautiful and sumptuous palace. Asking the pilot what this palace was called, heard that it was called Καχοσβασιλεα, that is to say Malroi. This name was in such horror and abomination to him that he entered into despair, as if assured of not escaping[18] until soon he lost his life, so that the assistants and porters heard his cries, sighs and groans. In fact, a short time later, a certain Achillas, an unknown peasant, cut off his head. We could still, in this connection, allege what happened to L. Paulus Æmilius, when, by the Roman Senate, was elected emperor, that is to say leader of the army which they sent against Persia, king of Macedonia. That one day, towards the evening, returning to his house to prepare for dislodging, kissing his own little girl named Tratia, noticed that she was in no way [19] sad: ""What is it, he said, my Tratia? Why are you so sad and angry?","‘But to get back to proper names, just think how that mighty son of King Philip of whom we have already spoken – Alexander the Great – succeeded in one of his enterprises by interpreting one word. He was besieging the fortress town of Tyre; over several weeks he gave it the most mighty battering that he could, but quite in vain: his siege-machines and mines profited him nothing; everything he did was at once undone or repaired by the people of Tyre. He therefore took the decision to raise the siege (greatly depressed, since he saw his disengagement as a weighty blow to his reputation). Worried and distressed he fell asleep. During that slumber he dreamt that a satyr was inside his tent, leaping and prancing on its goat-legs. Alexander tried to catch it: the satyr always got away. Finally the king drove it into a corner and pounced on him. At that point he awoke; he told the philosophers and the sages of his Court about his dream and was informed that the gods were promising him victory and that Tyre would soon be taken: for if you divide the word satyros into two, sa and Tyros, that signifies Thine is Tyre. And indeed, at the very next assault which he made he took the town by force and, in a great victory, subdued that rebellious people. ‘But consider how the meaning of a single name brought Pompey, on the contrary, to despair. Being vanquished by Caesar in the battle of Pharsalia, he had no means of safety but in flight. And so, fleeing by sea, he struck land on the island of Cyprus: near the town of Paphos he could make out a beautiful and luxurious palace near the shore. On asking the pilot its name, he heard that it was Kakobasileia, that is, Bad King. That name inspired him with such fear and loathing that he sank into despondency, sure that he would escape only to lose his life. The seamen and the others near him heard his cries, sighs and groans. And indeed, soon afterwards an unknown peasant called Achillas lopped off his head. Whilst on this subject, we could further cite what happened to Lucius Paulus Aemilius when, by the Roman Senate, he was elected Imperator (that is, the Commander-in-chief) of the forces which they were despatching against Perses, the King of Macedonia. That very day he returned home to prepare for this departure and, on kissing his daughter Tratia, noticed that she was somewhat sad. ‘“What is it my dear Tratia?”he said, “Why are you so sad and upset?”","But returning to Names, Do but consider how Alexander the Great, Son to King Philip, of whom we spoke just now, compass’d his Undertaking, meerly by the Interpretation of a Name. He had besieged the strong City of Tyre, and for several Weeks battered it with all his Power; but all in vain; his Engines and Attempts were still baffled by the Tyrians. Which made him finally resolve to raise the Siege to his great Grief, foreseeing the great Stain, which such a shameful Retreat would be to his Reputation. In this Anxiety and Agitation of mind he fell asleep, and dreamt that a Satyr was come into his Tent capering, skipping, and tripping it up and down with his Goatish hoofs, and that he strove to lay hold on him. But the Satyr still slip’d from him, till at last having pen’d him up into a Corner, he took him: With this he awak’d; and telling his Dream to the Philosophers, and Sages of his Court, they let him know, that it was a Promise of Victory from the Gods, and that he should soon be Master of Tyre; the word Satyros divided into two being Sa Tyros, and signifying Tyre is thine; and in truth, at the next Onset he took the Town by Storm, and by a compleat Victory, reduc’d that stubborn People to Subjection. On the other hand, see how by the Signification of one word, Pompey fell into despair. Being overcome by Cœsar at the Battel of Pharsalia, he had no other way left to escape but by flight; which attempting by Sea, he arriv’d near the Island of Cyprus, and perceiv’d on the shoar near the City of Paphos, a beautiful and stately Palace; Now asking the Pilot what was the name of it, he told him, that it was call’d κακοβασιλέα, that is, Evil-King; which struck such a dread and terror in him, that he fell into Despair, as being assured of loosing shortly his Life; insomuch that his Complaints, Sighs, and Groans were heard by the Mariners and other Passengers. And indeed a while after a certain strange Peasant call’d Achillas cut off his Head. To all these Examples might be added what happen’d to L. Paulus Æmilius, when the Senate elected him Emperour, that is, Chief of the Army which they sent against Perses King of Macedon; that Evening returning home to prepare for his Expedition, and kissing a little Daughter of his call’d Trasia, she seem’d somewhat sad to him. What is the matter, said he, my Chicken, why is my Trasia thus sad and Melancholly?"

"« Cetui, dit Pantagruel, n’est à votre avantage. Il dénote que votre femme sera ribaude, vous cocu par conséquent. La déesse que n’aurez favorable est Minerve, vierge très redoutée, déesse puissante, foudroyante, ennemie des cocus, des muguets, des adultères, ennemie des femmes lubriques, non tenantes la foi promise à leurs maris, et à autrui soi abandonnantes. Le dieu est Jupiter tonnant et foudroyant des cieux. Et noterez, par la doctrine des anciens Étrusques, que les manubies (ainsi appelaient-ils les jets des foudres vulcaniques) compètent[2] à elle seulement (exemple de ce fut donné en la conflagration des navires d’Ajax Oileus), et à Jupiter, son père capital[3]. À autres dieux olympiques n’est licite foudroyer. Pourtant[4] ne sont-ils tant redoutés des humains. Plus vous dirai, et le prendrez comme extrait de haute mythologie. Quand les géants entreprirent guerre contre les dieux, les dieux, au commencement, se moquèrent de tels ennemis, et disaient qu’il n’y en avait pas pour leurs pages ; mais, quand ils virent, par le labeur des géants, le mont Pélion posé dessus le mont Osse et jà ébranlé le mont Olympe pour être mis au-dessus des deux, furent tous effrayés. Adonc tint Jupiter chapitre général. Là fut conclu de tous les dieux qu’ils se mettraient vertueusement en défense, et pour ce qu’ils avaient plusieurs fois vu les batailles perdues par l’empêchement des femmes qui étaient parmi les armées, fut décrété que, pour l’heure, on chasserait des cieux en Égypte et vers les confins du Nil toute cette vessaille[5] des déesses, déguisées en belettes, fouines, ratepenades[6], musaraignes et autres métamorphoses. Seule Minerve fut de retenue pour foudroyer avec Jupiter, comme déesse des lettres et de guerre, de conseil et exécution, déesse née armée, déesse redoutée on[7] ciel, en l’air, en la mer et en terce.","""Cetui,"" said Pantagruel, ""is not to your advantage. It denotes that your wife will be ribald, you therefore cuckold. The goddess whom you will not favor is Minerva, very dreaded virgin, powerful, lightning goddess, enemy of cuckolds, lilies of the valleys, adulterers, enemy of lustful women, not holding the faith promised to their husbands, and to others who abandon themselves. The god is Jupiter thundering and thundering from the heavens. And note, by the doctrine of the ancient Etruscans, that the manubies (thus they called the jets of vulcanic thunderbolts) have jurisdiction[2] over her alone (example of this was given in the conflagration of the ships of Ajax Oileus), and over Jupiter, his capital father[3]. To other Olympic gods it is not lawful to strike down. However[4] they are not so feared by humans. More will tell you, and will take it as an excerpt from high mythology. When the giants waged war against the gods, the gods in the beginning laughed at such enemies, and said there was none for their pages; but, when they saw, by the toil of the giants, Mount Pelion set upon Mount Osse, and had already shaken Mount Olympus to be placed above both, they were all terrified. So Jupiter held a general chapter. There it was concluded by all the gods that they would put themselves virtuously in defence, and for what they had many times seen the battles lost by the hindrance of the women who were among the armies, it was decreed that, for the time being, they would hunt from the skies in Egypt and towards the confines of the Nile all this vestige[5] of goddesses, disguised as weasels, weasels, ratpenades[6], shrews and other metamorphoses. Only Minerva was detained to strike down with Jupiter, as goddess of letters and of war, of advice and execution, goddess born armed, goddess feared in the sky, in the air, in the sea and in the terce.","‘That is not in your favour,’ said Pantagruel. ‘It means that your wife will be a slut and consequently you a cuckold. The goddess who will not be favourable to you is Minerva, that most redoubtable virgin, that puissant goddess who hurls thunderbolts, that enemy of cuckolds, paramours and adulterers, that enemy of lewd wives who break faith with their husbands and abandon themselves to other men. ‘And the god is Jupiter, hurling thunder and lightning from the heavens. You will know that, according to the teachings of the Etruscans, the manubiae (as they used to call Vulcan’s thunderbolts) pertain exclusively to that goddess – take for example her engulfing in fire the warships of Ajax, Son of Oileus – and to Jupiter whose brain-child she was. It is not licit for the other gods of Olympus to hurl thunderbolts: that is why they are less redoubtable to human beings. I have more to tell you, which you will take as being distilled from high mythology. ‘When the Giants undertook their war against the gods, at first those gods laughed at such enemies and said that their pages could deal with such matters. But when they saw Mount Pelion already piled on to Mount Ossa by the labour of the Giants, and Mount Olympus already prised loose to be set on top of them both, they were all terrified. So Jupiter summoned a general meeting of his Chapter. ‘There it was decided by all the gods that they would valiantly prepare their defences. And since they had seen many battles lost by the hindrances caused by women in the midst of armies, it was decreed that they would drive for a while out of Heaven and into Egypt and the confines of the Nile all those crappy sluts of goddesses disguised as weasels, stoats, bats, shrews and similar metamorphoses. Minerva alone was retained in order to hurl thunderbolts together with Jupiter, being the goddess of letters, war, counsel and execution, a goddess born clad in armour, a goddess redoubtable throughout Heaven, air, sea and land.’","This Response (quoth Pantagruel) maketh not very much for your benefit or advantage: for it plainly signifies and denoteth, that your Wife shall be a Strumpet, and your self by consequence a Cuckold; the Goddess, whom you shall not find propitious nor favourable unto you, is Minerva, a most redoubtable and dreadful Virgin, a powerful and fulminating Goddess, an Enemy to Cuckolds, and effeminate Youngsters, to Cuckold-makers and Adulterers: the God is Jupiter, a terrible and Thunder-striking God from Heaven; and withal , it is to be remarked, that conform to the Doctrine of the ancient Hetrurians, the Manubes (for so did they call the darting Hurls, or slinging Casts of the Vulcanian Thunderbolts) did only appertain to her, and to Jupiter her Father Capital. This was verified in the Conflagration of the Ship of Ajax Oileus, nor doth this fulminating Power belong to any other of the Olympick Gods; Men therefore stand not in such fear of them. Moreover, I will tell you, and you may take it as extracted out of the profoundest Mysteries of Mythology, that when the Giants had enterprized the waging of a War against the Power of the Cœlestial Orbs, the Gods at first did laugh at those attempts, and scorn’d such despicable Enemies, who were in their conceit, not strong enough to cope in Feats of Warfare with their Pages: but when they saw by the Gigantine labour the high Hill Pelion set on lofty Ossa, and that the Mount Olympus was made shake to be erected on the top of both. Then was it that Jupiter held a Parliament, or General Convention, wherein it was unanimously resolved upon, and condescended to by all the Gods, that they should worthily and valiantly stand to their Defence. And because they had often seen Battles lost by the cumbersome Letts and disturbing incumbrances of Women, confusedly hudled in amongst Armies, it was at that time Decreed and Enacted, That they should expel and drive out of Heaven into Ægypt, and the Confines of Nile, that whole Crue of Goddesses disguised in the shapes of Weezils, Polcats, Bats, Shrew-Mice, Ferrets, Fulmarts, and other such like odd Transformations; only Minerva was reserved to participate with Jupiter in the horrifick fulminating Power; as being the Goddess both of War and Learning, of Arts and Arms, of Counsel and Dispatch, a Goddess arm’d from her Birth, a Goddess dreaded in Heaven, in the Air, by Sea and Land."
"« Mais quand ils eurent long chemin parfait, et étaient jà las comme pauvres diables et n’y avait plus d’olif en li caleil[5], ils ne belinaient si souvent et se contentaient bien (j’entends quant aux hommes) de quelque méchante et paillarde fois le jour.

Les autres mettent d’autres raisons, mais celle-là me semble la meilleure. » À quoi consentit volontiers Pantagruel.","""But when they had long perfect road, and were already weary as poor devils and there was no more olive in li caleil [5], they did not beline so often and were quite content (I mean as for the men) to some wicked and bawdy times a day. And that is what makes the leagues of Brittany, the Lanes[6], Germany and other more distant countries, so great. The others put other reasons, but this one seems to me the best. To which Pantagruel willingly consented.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.",", it should be accounted for a league; thus went away those brave fellowes and sprightly blades most merrily, and because they were fresh, and had been at rest, they very often jum’d and fanfreluched almost at every fields end, and this is the cause why the leagues about Paris are so short; but when they had gone a great way, and were now as weary as poor devils, all the oile in their lamps being almost spent, they did not chinke and dufle so often, but contented themselves, (I mean for the mens part,) with one scurvie paultry bout in a day, and this is that which makes the leagues in Britany, Delanes, Germany, and other more remote Countreys so long: other men give other reasons for it, but this seems to me of all other the best. To which Pantagruel willingly adhered."
"– Je, répondit Panurge, volontiers d’une femme le prendrais, ne fût que je crains deux choses.","“I,” replied Panurge, “willingly take it from a woman, were it only for two things that I fear.","‘I would willingly take it from a woman,’ Panurge replied, ‘were it not that I fear two things: one is that, no matter what they see, women always mentally conceive, consider and imagine it to refer to the penetration of the hallowed Ithyphallus.","I would more willingly (quoth Panurge) consult with and be advised by a dumb Woman, were it not that I am afraid of two things."

"En icelui jour, Pantagruel descendit en une île admirable entre toutes autres tant à cause de l’assiette que du gouverneur d’icelle. Elle de tous côtés pour le commencement était scabreuse[1], pierreuse, montueuse, infertile, mal plaisante à l’œil, très difficile aux pieds, et peu moins inaccessible que le mont du Dauphiné, ainsi dit pour ce qu’il est en forme d’un potiron, et de toute mémoire personne surmonter ne l’a pu, fors Doyac, conducteur de l’artillerie du roi Charles huitième, lequel avec engins mirifiques y monta, et au-dessus trouva un vieil bélier. C’était à deviner qui là transporté l’avait. Aucuns[2] le dirent, étant jeune agnelet, par quelque aigle ou duc chat-huant là ravi, s’être entre les buissons sauvé. Surmontants la difficulté de l’entrée, à peine bien grande et non sans suer, trouvâmes le dessus du mont tant plaisant, tant fertile, tant salubre et délicieux, que je pensais être le vrai jardin et paradis terrestre, de la situation duquel tant disputent et labourent[3] les bons théologiens. Mais Pantagruel nous affirmait là être le manoir d’Arété (c’est vertu) par Hésiode décrit, sans toutefois préjudice de plus saine opinion.","That day, Pantagruel went down to an island admirable among all others both because of the plate and the governor of it. It on all sides for the beginning was rough[1], stony, hilly, infertile, badly pleasing to the eye, very difficult on the feet, and little less inaccessible than the Mont du Dauphiné, so called for what it is in shape of a pumpkin, and to all memory no one has been able to overcome it, fors Doyac, conductor of the artillery of King Charles Eighth, who with marvelous engines climbed it, and above found an old ram. It was to be guessed who had transported him there. Some [2] said, being a young lamb, by some eagle or owl-owl there enraptured, having escaped between the bushes. Overcoming the difficulty of the entrance, hardly very great and not without sweating, we found the top of the mount so pleasant, so fertile, so salubrious and delicious, which I thought to be the true garden and earthly paradise, the situation of which so many dispute and plough[3] the good theologians. But Pantagruel affirmed to us there to be the manor of Arete (it is a virtue) by Hesiod described, without however prejudice to sounder opinion.","That same day Pantagruel landed on an island which was wonderful above all others both for its site and its Governor. At first it was steep, stony, precipitous and barren on all sides, ill-pleasing to the eye, very tough on the feet and hardly less inaccessible than that mountain in Dauphiné which is called Inaccessible because it is shaped like a toadstool and nobody in living memory has climbed it, except Doyac, King Charles the Eighth’s Master of Ordnance, who got up to the top by means of ingenious contrivances. There he found an aged ram. It was anyone’s guess what had transported it there : some suggested that an eagle or horned owl had carried it up as a kid and that it had then escaped into a thicket. Overcoming the difficult approaches with great toil and not without sweat, we found the top to be so pleasant, fertile, wholesome and delightful that I thought it was the true earthly Garden and Paradise over whose situation our good theologians so much quarrel and strive. Pantagruel assured us however – without prejudice to a sounder opinion – that it was the Manor of Arete (that is, Virtue), described by Hesiod.","THAT Day Pantagruel went ashore in an Island, which for Situation and Governor may be said not to have its fellow. When you just come into it, you find it rugged, craggy, barren, unpleasant to the Eye, painful to the Feet, and almost as inaccessible as the Mountain of Dauphiné, which is somewhat like a Toadstool, and was never climb’d, as any can remember, by any but Doyac, who had the charge of King Charles the Eighth’s Train of Artillery. This same Doyac with strange Tools and Engines, gain’d that Mountain’s top, and there he found an old Ram. It puzzl’d many a wise Head to guess how it got thither. Some said, that some Eagle, or great Horn-Coot, having carry’d it thither while ’twas yet a Lambkin, it had got away and sav’d it self among the Bushes. As for us, having with much toil and sweat overcome the difficult ways at the entrance, we found the top of the Mountain so fertile, healthful, and pleasant, that I thought I was then in the true Garden of Eden or Earthly Paradice, about whose Situation our good Theologues are in such a quandary, and keep such a pother. As for Pantagruel, he said, That here was the Seat of Arete (that’s as much as to say, Virtue) describ’d by Hesiod; this however, with submission to better Judgments."

"Ces diables Gastrolâtres retirés, Pantagruel fut attentif à l’étude de Gaster, le noble maître des arts. Vous savez que par institution de nature, pain avec ses apanages lui a été pour provision adjugé et aliment, adjointe cette bénédiction du ciel que pour pain trouver et garder rien ne lui défaudrait[1]. Dès le commencement il inventa l’art fabrile[2] et agriculture pour cultiver la terre, tendant à fin qu’elle lui produisit grain. Il inventa l’art militaire et armes pour grain défendre, médecine et astrologie, avec les mathématiques nécessaires, pour grain en sauveté par[3] plusieurs siècles garder et mettre hors les calamités de l’air, dégât des bêtes brutes, larcin des brigands. Il inventa les moulins à eau, à vent, à bras, à autres mille engins, pour grain moudre et réduire en farine, le levain pour fermenter la pâte, le sel pour lui donner saveur, (car il eut cette connaissance que chose on[4] monde plus les humains ne rendait à maladies sujets que de pain non fermenté, non salé user), le feu pour le cuire, les horologes et cadrans pour entendre le temps de la cuite de pain, créature de grain.","These retired Gastrolaters devils, Pantagruel was attentive to the study of Gaster, the noble master of the arts. You know that by institution of nature, bread with its appanages has been awarded to him as provision and food, added this blessing from heaven that for bread to find and keep nothing would fail him[1]. From the beginning he invented the art of manufacturing[2] and agriculture to cultivate the land, tending to the end that it would produce grain for him. He invented the military art and weapons for defending grain, medicine and astrology, with the necessary mathematics, for grain saved by[3] several centuries to keep and put out the calamities of the air, the damage of brute beasts, theft of brigands . He invented water mills, windmills, hand mills, mills with other thousand engines, for grinding grain and reducing it to flour, leaven to ferment the dough, salt to give it flavor, (for he had this knowledge that something we[ 4] the world no longer made humans prone to disease except from unfermented, unsalted bread (use), fire to cook it, clocks and dials to hear the time of baking bread, creature of grain.","Rabelais again lends a Classical Bacchic savour to his satire: ‘dithyrambs’ are wild Bacchanalian hymns addressed to Dionysius, ‘kraipa-lokomics’ are songs of crapulous Bacchanalian revelry, and ‘epaenetic hymns’ are songs of praise. All such hymns are addressed by the Gastrolaters to their belly-god.] As we all contemplated in sheer amazement the grimaces and gestures of those lazy, great-gulletted Gastrolaters, we heard the impressive stroke of a bell at which they all drew up as for battle, each according to his charge, rank and seniority. Thus they moved towards Messer Gaster, following the lead of a portly, gross young Fat-guts who bore on top of a long golden pole a badly carved wooden statue, coarsely painted, such as is described by Plautus, Juvenal and Pompeius Festus. During the carnival at Lyons folk call it Mâchecroutte; here they call it Manduces. It was a monstrosity of an effigy, absurd, ghastly and terrifying to little children, with eyes bigger than its belly, with a head, bigger than the rest of its body put together, and with capacious, wide and horrible upper and lower jaws both lined with fangs, which were made to clack together by the ingenious device of a small cord hidden within the gilded pole (as is done at Metz with their Saint-Clement’s dragon). As those Gastrolaters drew nearer, I could see that they were followed by a great number of fat serving-lads laden with panniers, baskets, hampers, pots, sacks and saucepans. Whereupon, led by Manduces, they chanted I-know-not-what dithyrambs, kraipalokômics and epaenetic hymns as, opening their baskets and their jars they offered up to their god: White hippocras with soft dry toast, white bread, canon’s baps, six varieties of grilled meats, couscous, hazlet, fricassees (nine kinds), thick slices of monastical bread-and-dripping, lyonese sops, hot-pots, savoury bread, burgher-bread, goat meat (roasted), veal-tongues: roasted, cold, sprinkled with ginger and mustard,","WHILE we fed our Eyes with the sight of the Phyzzes and Actions of these lozelly Gulligutted Gastrolaters, we on a sudden heard the Sound of a Musical Instrument call’d a Bell, at which all of them plac’d themselves in Rank and File as for some mighty Battel, every one according to his Office, Degree and Seniority. In this Order, they mov’d towards Master Gaster, after a plump, young, lusty gorbellied Fellow, who on a long Staff fairly gilt, carried a wooden Statue grossly carv’d and as scurvily daub’d o’er with Paint, such a one as Plautus, Juvenal and Pomp. Festus describe it. At Lions during the Carnaval ’tis call’d Maschecrouste, or Gnaw crust; they call’d this Manduce. It was a monstrous, ridiculous, hideous Figure, fit to fright little Children: Its Eyes were bigger than its Belly, and its Head larger than all the rest of its Body, well Mouth-cloven however, having a goodly Pair of wide, broad Jaws, lin’d with two Rows of Teeth, upper Teer and under Teer, which, by the Magic of a small Twine hid in the hollow part of the Golden Staff, were made to clash, clatter and rattle dreadfully one against another, as they do at Metz with St. Clement’s Dragon. Coming near the Gastrolaters, I saw they were follow’d by a great number of fat Waiters and Tenders laden with Baskets, Dossers, Hampers, Dishes, Wallets, Pots and Kettles: Then under the Conduct of Manduce, and singing I don’t know what Dithyrambics, Crepalocomes and Epenons, opening their Baskets and Pots, they offer’d their God, White Hippocras with dry Toasts. White-Bread. Brown-Bread. Carbonadoes, six sorts. Brawn. Sweet-breads. Fricasses nine sorts."

"– Si, dit Pantagruel, peur il a eu durant ce colle[31] horrible et périlleux fortunal[32], pourvu qu’au reste il se fût évertué, je ne l’en estime un pelet[33] moins. Car comme craindre en tout heurt est indice de gros et lâche cœur, ainsi comme faisait Agamemnon et pour cette cause le disait Achilles en ses reproches ignominieusement avoir œils de chien et cœur de cerf, aussi ne craindre quand le cas est évidemment redoutable, est signe de peu ou faute d’appréhension. Or, si chose est en cette vie à craindre, après l’offense de Dieu, je ne veux dire que soit la mort. Je ne veux entrer en la dispute de Socrates et des académiques, mort n’être de soi mauvaise, mort n’être de soi à craindre. Je dis cette espèce de mort par naufrage être ou rien n’être à craindre, car, comme est la sentence d’Homère, chose grave, abhorrente[34] et dénaturée est périr en mer. De fait, Enéas, en la tempête de laquelle fut le convoi de ses navires, près Sicile surpris, regrettait n’être mort de la main du fort Diomèdes, et disait ceux être trois ou quatre fois heureux qui étaient morts en la conflagration de Troie. Il n’est céans mort personne : Dieu servateur[35] en soit éternellement loué ! Mais vraiment voici un ménage assez mal en ordre. Bien. Il nous faudra réparer ce bris. Gardez que ne donnons par terre. »","“If,” said Pantagruel, “he was afraid during this horrible and perilous fortunate[32] colle[31], provided he had done his best, I do not esteem him a pelet[33] less. For as fear in every collision is an indication of a big and cowardly heart, so as Agamemnon did and for this cause Achilles said in his reproaches, ignominiously having the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag, so not to fear when the case is obviously dreadful, is a sign little or no apprehension. Now, if there is anything in this life to be feared, after the offense of God, I do not mean death. I don't want to get into the argument between Socrates and the academics, death is not inherently bad, death is not inherently to be feared. I say this species of death by shipwreck to be or nothing to be feared, for, as is the sentence of Homer, a serious, abhorrent [34] and distorted thing is to perish at sea. In fact, Aeneas, in the storm of which was the convoy of his ships, near Sicily surprised, regretted not having died by the hand of the strong Diomedes, and said to be three or four times happy who had died in the conflagration of Troy. No one died here: Servant God [35] be eternally praised! But really here is a rather badly ordered household. Good. We will have to fix this break. Keep that don't give on the floor. »","‘If,’ said Pantagruel, ‘he felt fear during that horrifying hurricane and menacing storm, I do not value him one tiny hair less: provided that he had bestirred himself. For just as it is a sign of a coarse and cowardly heart to feel fear at every shock (as Agamemnon did: for which reason Achilles shamefully reproached him with having the keen sight of a dog and the faint heart of a deer), so, too, for a man not to be afraid when the situation is manifestly formidable is a sign of want or lack of intelligence. Now, if next to offending God there is anything to fear in this life , I will not say it is death – I do not want to get involved in the contention of Socrates and the Academics , that death is not bad in itself and so not in itself to be feared – I do say that either death by shipwreck is to be feared, or nothing is; for as Homer puts it, it is a grievous, ghastly and disnatured thing to perish at sea.53 Aeneas, indeed, during the tempest which surprised his convoy of boats off Sicily, regretted that he had not died at the strong hand of Diomedes; he declared those to be thrice and four times blessèd who had died in the conflagration of Troy.54 ‘Here, not one man has died. For which may God our Servator be for ever praised. But this is all a bit of a mess. Right! We must repair the damage. And see we don’t run aground.’","If, said Pantagruel, he hath been afraid during this dreadfull Hurricane, and dangerous Storm, provided (waving that) he hath done his part like a Man, I do not value him a Jot the less for it. For as to fear in all Encounters, is the mark of a heavy, and cowardly Heart, as Agamemnon did, who for that reason, is ignominously tax’d by Achilles with having Dogs Eyes, and a Stags Heart; so, not to fear when the case is evidently dreadful, is a sign of want or smallness of Apprehension. Now if any thing ought to be feard, in this Life, next to offending God, I will not say it is death; I will not meddle with the Disputes of Socrates and the Academies , that death of it self is neither bad nor to be fear’d: But I will affirm that this kind of death by Shipwrack is to be fear’d or nothing is. For as Homer saith, it is a grievous, dreadfull, and an unnatural thing to perish at Sea. And indeed Æneas, in the Storm that took his Fleet near Sicily, was griev’d that he had not dy’d by the Hand of the brave Diomedes, and said that those were three nay four times happy who perish’d with Troy. No Man here hath lost his Life; the Lord our Saviour be eternally prais’d for it: But in truth here is a Ship sadly out of order. Well, we must take care to have the damage repair’d. Take heed we do not run a ground and billage her."

How Panurge takes advice from Brother Jean des Entomneures,"I shan’t enjoy myself for a couple of days: nay, not for four!’ How Panurge takes counsel from Frère Jean des Entommeures CHAPTER 26 [It is normal to link this chapter with the contemporary cult of poetic blasons (poems copiously praising, say, a beautiful young bosom and then having it answered by another poem piling up terms for an ugly old withered one). There are plenty of occasions for unexpected smiles in this list, where the terms applied to Frère Jean’s bollocks are mainly those of vigour and power. In Chapter 28 we will find Panurge treated to epithets of weakness, scabbiness and debility. These blasons are later disposed in two columns only. Three epithets are later cut out of Chapter 28 (on Panurge’s bollocks) and attributed to Frère Jean’s: ‘aborted b., – chalotted b.,– censored b.’ There are three quotations from Scripture light-heartedly made by Frère Jean as ‘Breviary Stuff: ‘Go forth – we that live – and multiply’, which conflates the commandment given to Adam in Genesis to go forth and multiply with words from Psalm 112:18 – ‘we that live’ – which makes that commandment universal. For the Day of Judgement, ‘when He shall come to judge’, cf. among other texts, Psalm 95 (96) 13. Words made up from mataeo (such as ‘mataeologian’ elsewhere in Rabelais and ‘mataeobefuddledized’ here) imply uselessness, emptiness and so on.]","these two days to come, hardly these four.

"– Oui bien, dit-il, comme il vous semble ; mais il ne me semble, quant à moi, car les pardonnaires me le donnent quand ils me disent, en présentant les reliques à baiser : « Centuplum accipies », que pour un denier j’en prenne cent. Car accipies est dit selon la manière des Hébreux qui usent du futur en lieu de l’impératif, comme vous avez en la Loi : Diliges dominum, id est dilige. Ainsi quand le pardonnigère me dit : Centuplum accipies, il veut dire Centuplum accipe, et ainsi l’expose rabi[10] Kimy et rabi Aben Ezra, et tous les massorètes[11] ; et ibi Bartolus. Davantage[12] le pape Sixte me donna quinze cents livres de rente sur son domaine et trésor ecclésiastique, pour lui avoir guéri une bosse chancreuse qui tant le tourmentait qu’il en cuida[13] devenir boiteux toute sa vie. Ainsi je me paie par mes mains, car il n’est tel, sur ledit trésor ecclésiastique.","“Yes, well,” he said, “as it seems to you; but it does not seem to me, for the pardoners give it to me when they say to me, when presenting the relics to be kissed: ""Centuplum accipies"", that for a denarius I take a hundred. For accipies is said according to the manner of the Hebrews who use the future tense instead of the imperative, as you have in the Law: Diliges dominum, id est dilige. Thus when the pardoner says to me: Centuplum accipies, he means Centuplum accipe, and thus exposes it rabi[10] Kimy and rabi Aben Ezra, and all the Masoretes[11]; and ibi Bartolus. Further [12] Pope Sixtus gave me fifteen hundred livres a year from his estate and ecclesiastical treasury, for having cured him of a cankerous lump which tormented him so much that he suffered from it [13] to become lame all his life. So I pay myself with my hands, for there is no such thing, out of the said ecclesiastical treasury.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","True (said he) in your opinion, but I am not of that minde; for the Pardoners do give me it, when they say unto me in presenting the relicks to kisse, Centuplum accipies, that is, that for one penny I should take a hundred; for accipies is spoken according to the manner of the Hebrewes, who use the future tense in stead of the imperative, as you have in the law, Diliges Dominum, that is, dilige: even so when the Pardon-bearer sayes to me, Centuplum accipies, his meaning is, Centuplum accipe; and so doth Rabbi Kimy, and Rabbi Aben Ezra expound it, and all the Massorets, & ibi Bartholus. Moreover, Pope Sixtus gave me fifteen hundred francks of yearly pension (which in English money is a hundred and fifty pounds) upon his Ecclesiastical revenues and treasure, for having cured him of a canckrous botch, which did so torment him, that he thought to have been a cripple by it all his life. Thus I do pay my self at my owne hand (for otherwise I get nothing) upon the said Ecclesiastical treasure."
"Je me doute que ne croyez assurément cette étranger nativité.

14. La harangue de maître Janotus de Bragmardo faite à Gargantua pour recouvrer les cloches,14. The harangue of Master Janotus of Bragmardo made in Gargantua to recover the bells,"The Harangue of Magister Janotus de Bragmardo delivered before Gargantua for the return of the bells CHAPTER 18 [Becomes Chapter 19. This chapter is partly in dog-Latin as satirized by Rabelais, a humanist for whom good Latin mattered and who mocked the scholastic terminology he had mastered in youth. The confused grammar of Janotus leads him to apply to the Virgin Mary words which apply to the Father. Janotus innocently applies to the Sorbonne words from Psalm 49 (48):21, ‘A Man that is in honour and understandeth not is like unto the beasts that perish’. Throughout this whole episode there is perhaps a sustained pun between clocher, to limp, and cloche, a then obsolescent word for a lame man, and also the French word for bells, cloches, for which the theologian uses a low Latin word, clochas. Noël Béda, the syndic of the Sorbonne, was certainly a hunchback and doubtless lame. Did he have lame colleagues too? The praise of physicians and medicine in Ecclesiasticus 38:4, ‘And a wise man will not abhor them’, is applied by Janotus to his promised pair of warm breeches. In this chapter words which are in Latin in Rabelais are printed in italics, including clocha and its derivatives. The word of address Domine (Sir, Lord, etc.) is kept in Latin. Throughout there is a savour of Maître Pathelin and of the Letters of Obscure Men. Londres-en-Cahors and Bordeaux-en -Brie are hamlets, having nothing to do with the great towns their names evoke, London and Bordeaux. When David says in the Psalms ‘Per diem’ (By day!) he is amusingly taken to be using an attenuated oath, avoiding Per deum (by God!).]","CHAPTER XIX The Oration of Master Janotus de Bragmardo, for recovery of the bells."

43. Menus devis durant le dîner à la louange des décrétales,43. Menu quotes during dinner in praise of the decretals,"CHAPTER 51 [Christ’s summary of the Law is short and clear: ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind’ and ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself’. The Papimanes infringe both commandments: they have a rival god, and their love of their neighbour is conditional. They replace the Scriptures by the Decretals and their papal-centred theology, which for Papimanes equals or supplants Saint Paul. Specific collections of Decretals are named, each with a mocking epithet in imitation of those given to great theologians (Doctor Angelical, and so on): Sextum seraphical; Clementines cherubical and Extravangantes angelical. When ordering new rounds of drink Homenaz repeats a Latin/ French pun: Clerice: éclaire ici: ‘Clerk! (or Cleric!) Shine light here’. To keep some of the savour, that play on words is transposed throughout to ‘Deacon! Be a beacon! Shine over here!’",CHAPTER LI Table-Talk in Praise of the Decretals.
"Près le havre était un cabaret beau et magnifique en extérieure apparence, auquel accourir voyants nombre grand de peuple Outré, de tous sexes, toutes âges et tous états, pensions que là fût quelque notable festin et banquet. Mais nous fut dit qu’ils étaient invités aux crevailles de l’hôte, et y allaient en diligence, proches parents et alliés. N’entendants ce jargon, et estimants qu’en icelui pays le festin on nommât crevailles, comme de çà nous appelons enfiançailles[2], épousailles, relevailles, tondailles[3], métivailles[4], fûmes avertis que l’hôte en son temps avait été bon raillard[5], grand grignoteur, beau mangeur de soupes lyonnaises, notable compteur d’horloge, éternellement dînant comme l’hôte de Rouillac, et ayant jà par dix ans pété graisse en abondance, était venu en ses crevailles, et selon l’usage du pays finissait ses jours en crevant, plus ne pouvant le péritoine et peau par tant d’années déchiquetée clore et retenir ses tripes qu’elles n’effondrassent par dehors comme d’un tonneau défoncé. « Et quoi ! dit Panurge, bonnes gens, ne lui sauriez-vous bien à point, avec bonnes grosses sangles ou bons gros cercles de cormier, voire de fer, si besoin est, le ventre relier ? Ainsi lié ne jetterait si aisément ses fonds hors, et si tôt ne crèverait. » Cette parole n’était achevée quand nous entendîmes en l’air un son haut et strident, comme si quelque gros chêne éclatait en deux pièces ; lors fut dit par les voisins que les crevailles étaient faites, et que cetui éclat était le pet de la mort.","Near the harbor was a cabaret, beautiful and magnificent in exterior appearance, to which, seeing a large number of Outré people, of all sexes, all ages, and all states, rushed, thinking that there was some notable feast and banquet. But we were told that they were invited to the crevasses of the host, and went there with diligence, near relatives and allies. Not understanding this jargon, and considering that in this country the feast was called crevailles, as from that we call engagement[2], nuptials, reliefs, tondailles[3], métivailles[4], we were informed that the host in his time had been a good joker[5], a great nibbler, a fine eater of Lyonnaise soups, a notable clock counter, eternally dining like the host of Rouillac, and having already farted fat in abundance in ten years, had come in his cracks , and according to the custom of the country ended his days by dying, no longer being able the peritoneum and skin shredded by so many years to close and retain his guts that they would not collapse outside like from a smashed barrel. "" And what ! said Panurge, good people, wouldn't you know how to fit him, with good big straps or good big hoops of service tree, or even of iron, if need be, the belly to bind? So bound would he throw his funds out so easily, and so soon burst. This speech was not finished when we heard in the air a high and strident sound, as if some great oak tree split in two parts; then it was said by the neighbors that the cracks were made, and that this burst was the fart of death.","Near the harbour there was a tavern with a fine and imposing façade. When we saw a great number of the Over-bloated rushing in (people of all sexes, ages and rank) we thought that there must be some notable feast or banquet, but we were informed that they had all been invited by their host to a blowing. We, not understanding their dialect, thought that they called a blow-out a blowing, just as we refer to betrothings, weddings, churchings, shearings and harvestings; we were told that the host had been quite a lad in his time, a good trencherman, a good devourer of Lyonese soups, a notable clock-watcher forever dining like mine Host at Rouillac; and since he had been farting an abundance of grease for the past ten years, he had now reached his blowings. In accordance with the customs of his country he was ending his days in a blow-out, since his peritoneum and his flesh had been slashed over so many years that they could no longer hold up his innards and restrain them from dropping as from a stove-in barrel. ‘Well now, good folk,’ said Panurge, ‘could you not ring his guts well round with good, strong bands or great hoops (of sorb-apple wood, or if needs be of iron)? Bound thus, he wouldn’t so readily cast out his intestines and so readily burst.’ Those words were not uttered before we heard a sound in the air, loud and rasping as though a great oak had been split in two. His neighbours then said that his bursting was over: that splitting sound had been his dying fart.","my dainty Cod?

"Autre infortune est advenu. Les pillards et brigands dérobaient grain et pain par les champs. Il inventa art de bâtir villes, forteresses et châteaux pour les resserrer et en sûreté conserver.

How the Gastrolaters sacrificed to their god during their interlarded fast-days CHAPTER 60 [Once more there is the pun, with farce meaning the play, force-meat stuffing and by extension stuffing oneself. Fasting as an unreformed Church discipline entailed abstaining from flesh, not abstaining from gluttony. Fish, eggs and so much else remained available as sacrifices to Gaster. Pantagruel’s anger is a pointer leading beyond the surface fun. For the Erasmian climax of this chapter see the footnote at the end. Gaster is a creature not a creator God.] When Pantagruel saw that riff-raff of sacrificers and the multiplicity of their sacrifices he was angry and would have stalked off if Epistemon had not begged him to witness the issue of such a farce. ‘And what do these scoundrels sacrifice to their ventripotent god,’ asked Pantagruel, ‘during their interlarded fast-days?’ That I shall tell you,’ said the pilot. ‘For their entrées they offer him: caviar, pickled mullet-caviar, fresh butter, pease-pudding, spinach, fresh herrings, soused herrings, sardines, anchovies, marinated tuna, cabbage in olive-oil, buttered beans, hundreds of kinds of salads: of cress, hops, bishop’s-bollocks, rampion, Judas-ears (a variety of fungus growing out from ancient elder-trees), asparagus, woodbine and many others, salted salmon, salted eels, oysters in the shell. ‘Now drink is a must, or the devil will get you! Good arrangements having been made, nothing was lacking. And they then offer unto him: lampreys in Hippocras sauce, barbels, friture of barbels, grey mullet, striped mullet, rays, cuttlefish, sturgeons, guernet, whales, mackerel, shad, plaice, fried oysters, periwinkles, crayfish, smelts, red gurnets, trout, perch from the lakes, cod, octopus, dabs, carrelets, meagers, sea-bream, gudgeons, brill, sprats, carp, pike, Mediterranean palamides, spotted dog-fish, sea-urchins, poules-de-mer, sea-nettles, crepidules, sea-owls, swordfish, angel-fish squali, lamprels, snook, carp small-fry, salmon, samlets, dolphins, porpoises, turbot, white skate, soles, limander soles, mussels, lobsters, shrimps, dace, ablen, tench, grayling, fresh hake, sepia, prickle-back, tuna, gudgeon, miller’s-thumbs, cray-fish, cockles, spiny-lobsters, sea-lampreys, congers, dorados, bass, shad, morays, charlings, small dare-fish, eels, pickled-eels, turtles, serpens (that is, bush-eels), sea-bream, sea-ducks, ruff, royal-sturgeon, loach, crabs, sea-snails, frogs. ‘Once those viands had been devoured, Death lurks but two steps away if you weren’t then drinking. That was excellently provided for. ‘They next sacrificed: salted haddock, dried haddock, eggs – fried, buttered, poached, smothered, braised, roasted-in-the-ashes, smoked-up-the-chimney, scrambled, whipped in verjuice, etc., salted cod, thornbacks, bergylts, small marinated sea-pike. ‘To assist their proper concoction and digestion, the wine was redoubled. As the end drew nigh they offered up: rice, millet, porridge, almond butter, whipped butter, pistachio-butter, pistachio-nuts, salted ditto, figs, grapes, caraway-seeds, maize (powdered), frumenty, dates, walnuts, filberts, buttered parsnips, and artichokes, amidst perennial potations. ‘Believe you me: if Gaster their god was not more sumptuously, richly and appropriately served in his sacrifices than the idol of Heliogabalus – indeed, than the idol of Baal in Babylon under King Belshazzar – that was no fault of theirs: yet Gaster admitted that he was not God but a poor, paltry, wretched created thing. And just as King Antigonus, the First of that name, replied to a certain Hermodotus (who addressed him in his verses as a god and Son of the Solar Deity) by saying to him: “My Bearer of the Lasanon says no to that – lasanon being an earthenware chamber-pot devoted to receiving the belly’s excreta – so too Gaster referred those apish hypocrites to the seat of his privy, there to ponder, meditate and reflect upon what godhead they found in his faeces.”’70 How Gaster invented means of gathering and conserving grain CHAPTER 61 [Throughout there is play between ‘Master of Arts’ (the university degree) and Gaster, the ‘Master’ of the arts, sciences and skills of mankind. ‘Apanages’ allows of a play on panus, (bread).] Once those devilish Gastrolaters had withdrawn, Pantagruel attended to the study of Gaster, the noble Master of Arts. You are aware that, by a basic institution of Nature, bread and its apanages were adjudicated to Gaster as provender and nutriment; to which was attached this blessing from Heaven: that he would never lack means of getting and keeping his bread. From the outset he invented the art of the blacksmith, and husbandry to cultivate the land and make it bring forth grain. He invented weapons and the military arts to protect the grain, and the arts of medicine and astrology (with the necessary mathematics) to safeguard it over the centuries, so putting it beyond the reach of climatic disasters, thieving by brute beasts and stealing by brigands. He invented watermills, windmills and hand-mills and hundreds of other ingenious devices for grinding the grain and turning it into flour; yeast to leaven the dough and salt to give it its savour – for he knew as a fact that nothing in this world would make human beings more subject to illness than unleavened and unsalted bread – fire to bake it; clocks and sundials to regulate the time of the baking of that which grain produces: bread. When the harvest chanced to fail in one country, he invented the art of hauling grain from one country to another; with great ingenuity he crossed two kinds of animals (the ass and the mare) to give birth to a third kind, which we term mules: beasts tougher, less sensitive and more able to sustain hard toil than other animals. He invented carts and wagons to transport it more conveniently. When seas or rivers obstructed the haulage he invented boats, galleys and sailing-ships – something which astonished the very Elements – so as to sail the seas, cross estuaries and navigate rivers in order to haul the grain and ship it from unknown, foreign lands afar. And then some years it chanced that, having tilled the soil, Gaster lacked rain in due season, for want of which the grain remained dead and wasted in the soil; some years it rained too much and the grain was sodden; some other years the hail battered it down, the winds beat the grain from the ears, and the tempests flattened it. Before we came on the scene, Gaster had invented a method and art of calling down rain from the heavens merely by chopping up a particular herb, which he showed us, one frequently found in meadows yet known to but a few. (I reckoned that it was the same herb by which the pontiff of Jove, by placing a single sprig of it in the Agrian Spring on Mount Lycaeus in Arcady during a period of drought, once brought forth mists: from them heavy clouds were formed which broke up into rain, watering at will the entire region.) He invented an art and method of keeping rain suspended in the air and making it fall over the sea. He invented an art and method of eliminating hail, suppressing the winds and turning away a storm, by the means employed by the Methanensians of Troezinia. A further setback occurred: thieves and bandits pillaged the grain and so the bread in the fields: he invented the art of building towns, fortresses and castles to store it in and keep it safe. Then it chanced that the countryside lacked bread, and he realized that once it was brought within the towns, fortresses and castles, it was more fiercely defended and guarded by their inhabitants than the golden apples of the Hesperides were ever guarded by the dragons. He therefore invented the art and method of reducing or slighting fortresses and castles by machines and contrivances such as battering-rams and catapults for slinging stones or arrows, the design of which he showed us, though it was badly understood by those architectural engineers who were disciples of Vitruvius (as was admitted to us by Messer Philibert de L’Orme the great architect of the Mighty King). And when they could no longer be profitably used against the malicious cunning and the cunning malice of the builders of fortifications, he recently invented canons, serpentines, culverins, bombards and basilisks which, by means of an horrific compound of powder, can project cannon-balls of iron, bronze and lead weighing more than great anvils, at which Nature herself was aghast, confessing herself beaten by Art, despising as she does the practice of the Oxydracians, who, in the midst of the field, vanquished their enemies and caused them sudden death by exploiting thunder, lightning, hail, great flashes of light and storms: for one shot from a basilisk is more horrifying, more dreadful, more diabolical than a hundred thunderbolts: it maims, injures, shatters and kills more people; it leaves men more shocked and it razes more walls. How Gaster invented the art by means of which one can remain untouched and unwounded by cannon-balls CHAPTER 62 [Rabelais again draws very heavily on one of his principal authorities, Celio Calcagnini. He plays – how seriously? – with the fact that opposing poles of the magnet do not attract but repel. ‘Nature abhors a vacuum’ was a tenet of physics until the seventeenth century. All the alleged facts, exempla, arguments and mystical truths (from the herb called aethiopis which opens all the locks placed against it right to the end of the chapter have the learned Calcagnini behind them. The reader is left to question or accept them, but is brought to accept the higher, Pythagorean meaning of the elder-wood, guided by a detailed borrowing from Calcagnini and yet again by an adage of Erasmus: II, V, XLVI, ‘Mercury – as a graven image – is not to be made from just any piece of wood’.] Now it befell that Gaster, having stored his grain in his fortresses, found himself assailed by enemies, his fortresses demolished by such thrice-dreaded, hellish devices, whilst his grain and his bread were seized and pillaged by great force such as that of the Titans. He therefore invented the art and method, not so much of protecting his ramparts, bastions, walls and defence-works against damage from such cannonades, but of causing the pieces of shot not to strike them at all but to hover short of them motionless, or else of so striking them as to harm neither the defences nor the defending citizens. Against such mischief he had already made an excellent arrangement, and showed us a trial of it – a device subsequently employed by Fronton and currently figuring amongst the honourable pastimes and sports of the Thelemites. The trial was as follows (and from now on be more ready to believe what Plutarch assures us that he tried out himself: if, when a tribe of nanny-goats are running away at full pelt, you push a twig of eryngo down the throat of the last straggler, they will all stop dead). Within a bronze falconet (raster placed on top of the gunpowder (which had been compounded with care, cleansed of sulphur and balanced by the right amount of refined camphor) a cartridge of iron of the appropriate calibre together with twenty-four pellets of iron-filings, some spherical, others tear-shaped. He trained his sights on one of his young pages as though intending to shoot him through the stomach; then, at some sixty paces, strictly midway between that page and the falconet, he suspended from a post a very large block of siderite (iron-stone, that is, otherwise called Herculanea, discovered long ago by a man called Magnes at Ida in Phrygia, as Nicander attests. We normally call it aimant, magnet-stone). He then touched off the powder through the vent in the falconet. The powder was consumed. And thus, to avoid a vacuum ( which Nature so abhors that the entire structure of the Universe, the heavens, the earth, the sea and the land would sooner be returned to ancient Chaos than any vacuum be admitted anywhere in the world), the cartridge and the pellets were precipitously expelled through the mouth of the falconet to allow air to get through to the gun-chamber, which would otherwise have remained in the vacuum caused by the rapid consumption of the powder by the flame. The cartridge and the pellets thus violently fired seemed bound to strike that page-boy, but at the point where they approached the above-mentioned stone, they all lost their momentum and stayed hovering in the air, circling about the stone: not one of them – no matter how violently propelled – got through to the page, however violent the force. Gaster also invented the art and method of making bullets return against the enemy, as furious and dangerous as when they had been fired and following the same trajectory. He did not find that at all difficult: – seeing that the herb called aethiopis opens all the locks placed against it; that the echineis (a puny fish) can stay the most powerful ships that sail the seas, countering gales and raging tempests; and that the flesh of that fish, preserved in salt, can draw gold out of the deepest wells that one can sound; and seeing that Democritus writes (and Theophrastus both believed it and proved it experimentally) that there is a certain herb at the mere touch of which an iron wedge, driven with great force deep into a great, hard block of wood, will suddenly pop out; it is used by woodpeckers (those pics Mars which you call pivars) whenever anyone has used an iron wedge to stop up the entrance-hole to their nests, which they are accustomed to build by hollowing out the trunks of mighty trees; – and seeing that if stags and does that have suffered deep wounds from strikes by darts or arrows or bolts from the cross-bow come across the herb called dittany (which flourishes in Candia) and eat a little of it, the projectiles at once drop out and the beasts suffer no harm; (by its means Venus cured her dear son Aeneas when wounded in the right thigh with an arrow shot by Juturna, the sister of Turnus); – seeing that thunderbolts are deflected by the mere scent emanating from laurels, fig-trees and sea-calves, and never strike them; – seeing that at the simple sight of a ram, mad elephants are restored to their senses, mad bulls on the rampage are tamed if they come near to that wild fig-tree called caprificus, remaining fixed and unable to budge; and the viper’s rage is calmed by the touch of a branch of the beech-tree; – seeing also that Euphorion writes that on the island of Samos, before the temple of Juno was erected there, he saw beasts called Neades at whose sole cry the earth toppled down into chasms to the abyss; – seeing, similarly, that the elder grows more sonorous and more suited to making a set of pipes in places when the voice of the cock is never heard; so wrote the ancient sages, according to the account in Theophrastus, as though the crow of the cock weakened, softened and troubled the woody matter of the elder-tree, just as, upon hearing such crowing, the lion, a beast of such might and constancy, becomes utterly dazed and bewildered. I know that others have taken that opinion to apply to the wild elder growing in places so far from towns and villages that the crow of the cock could never be heard there. Doubtless its wood should indeed be chosen to make pipes and other musical instruments and be preferred to the domestic variety which grows close to rural slums and ruined cottages. Others have taken it in a more elevated sense, not literally but allegorically, following the practice of the Pythagoreans, who interpret the saying that A statue of Mercury should not be carved from just any wood to mean that God should not be worshipped in an uncouth fashion but in an elect, religious manner. With that judgement they likewise tell us that wise and scholarly people should not devote themselves to trivial, vulgar music but to music which is celestial, angelic, marked by divinity, more recondite and borne from afar, namely from a region where no crowing cocks are heard. For when we wish to characterize a place which is isolated and little frequented, we say it is one where no cock-crow has ever been heard.

PANTAGRUEL did not like this Pack of Rascally Scoundrels with their manifold Kitchen Sacrifices, and would have been gone, had not Epistemon prevail’d with him to stay and see the End of the Farce; he then ask’d the Skipper, what the idle Lobcocks us’d to sacrifice to their gorbellied God on interlarded Fish-days? For his first Course, said the Skipper, they give him Caviar. Botargoes. Fresh Butter. Pease soupe. Sellery, Sives, Rampions, Jew’s-Ears, (a sort of Mushrooms that sprout out of old Elders), Sparagus, Spinage. Fresh Herrings full-roed. Salats, a hundred Woodbind, and a World of others Red-herrings.

Perpetuity of Soaking with the whole. ’Twas none of their Fault, I’ll assure you, if this same God of theirs was not publickly, preciously and plentifully serv’d in his Sacrifices, better yet than Heliogabalus’s Idol; nay, more than Bell and the Dragon in Babylon under King Balshazzar. Yet Gaster had the Manners to own that he was no God, but a poor, vile, wretched Creature. And as King Antigonus, first of the Name, when one Hermodotus, (as Poets will flatter, especially Princes) in some of his Fustian dubb’d him a God, and made the Sun adopt him for his Son, said to him, My Lasanophore (or in plain English, my Groom of the Close stool) can give thee the Lye; so Master Gaster very civilly us’d to send back his bigotted Worshipers to his Close-stool, to see, smell, taste, philosophise and examin what kind of Divinity they could pick out of his Sirreverence. CHAPTER LXI How Gaster invented Means to get and preserve Corn. THESE Gastrolatrous Hobgoblins being withdrawn, Pantagruel carefully minded the famous Master of Arts, Gaster. You know that by the Institution of Nature, Bread has been assign’d him for Provision and Food, and that as an addition to this Blessing, he should never want the means to get Bread. Accordingly, from the beginning he invented the Smith’s Art and Husbandry to manure the ground that it might yield him Corn; he invented Arms, and the Art of War to defend Corn; Physick and Astronomy, with other parts of Mathematicks, which might be useful to keep Corn a great number of Years in safety from the injuries of the Air, Beasts, Robbers and Purloiners; he invented Water, Wind and Hand-Mills, and a thousand other Engines to grind Corn, and turn it into Meal, Leaven to make the Dough ferment, and the use of Salt to give it a savour, for he knew that nothing bred more Diseases than heavy, unleaven’d, unsavoury Bread. He found a way to get Fire to Bake it; Hour-glasses, Dials and Clocks to mark the time of its Baking; and as some Countries wanted Corn, he contriv’d means to convey some out of one Country into another. He had the Wit to pimp for Asses and Mares, Animals of different Species, that they might Copulate for the Generation of a third, which we call Mules, more strong and fit for hard Service than the other two. He invented Carts and Waggons to draw him along with greater ease; and as Seas and Rivers hindred his Progress, he devis’d Boats, Gallies and Ships (to the astonishment of the Elements) to waft him over to barbarous, unknown, and far distant Nations, thence to bring, or thither to carry Corn. Besides, seeing that, when he had tilled the ground, some years the Corn perish’d in it for want of Rain in due season, in others rotted, or was drown’d by its excess, sometimes spoil’d by Hail, eat by Worms in the Ear, or beaten down by Storms, and so his Stock was destroy’d on the ground; we were told that ever since the days of Yore, he has found out a way to Conjure the Rain down from Heaven only with cutting certain Grass, common enough in the Field, yet known to very few, some of which was then shown us: I took it to be the same as the Plant, one of whose Boughs being dipp’d by Jove’s Priest into the Agrian Fountain, on the Lycian Mountain in Arcadia in time of Drought, rais’d Vapours which gather’d into Clouds, and then dissolv’d into Rain, that kindly moisten’d the whole Country. Our Master of Arts was also said to have found a way to keep the Rain up in the Air, and make it fall into the Sea; also to annihilate the Hail, suppress the Winds, and remove Storms as the Methanensians of Trœzene us’d to do. And as in the Fields, Thieves and Plunderers sometimes stole and took by force the Corn and Bread which others had toyl’d to get, he invented the Art of building Towns, Forts, and Castles, to hoard and secure that staff of Life; on the other hand, finding none in the Fields, and hearing that it was hoarded up and secur’d in Towns, Forts, and Castles, and watch’d with more care than ever were the Golden Pippins of the Hesperides, he turn’d Ingenier, and found ways to beat, storm, and demolish Forts and Castles with Machines, and Warlike Thunderbolts, battering Rams, Balists, and Catapults, whose shapes were shown us, not over-well understood by our Ingeniers, Architects, and other Disciples of Vitruvius, as Master Philebert de l’Orme, King Megistus’s principal Architect, has own’d to us. And seeing that sometimes all these Tools of Destruction were baffled by the cunning subtilty, or the subtle cunning (which you please) of Fortifiers, he lately invented Cannons, Field-pieces, Culverins, Bombards, Basilisko’s, Murthering Instruments that dart Iron, Leaden, and Brazen Balls, some of them outweighing huge Anvils; this by the means of a most dreadful Powder, whose Hellish Compound and Effect has even amazed Nature, and made her own her self out-done by Art; the Oxydracan Thunders, Hails and Storms, by which the people of that Name immediately destroy’d their Enemies in the Field, being but meer Pot-guns to these. For, one of our great Guns, when us’d, is more dreadful, more terrible, more diabolical, and maims, tears, breaks, slays, mows down, sweeps away more Men, and causes a greater Consternation and Destruction than a hundred Thunderbolts. CHAPTER LXII How Gaster invented an Art to avoid being hurt or touch’d by Cannon Balls. GASTER having secur’d himself with his Corn within strong Holds, has sometimes been attack’d by Enemies, his Fortresses, by that thrice threefold curst Instrument, levell’d and destroy’d, his dearly beloved Corn and Bread snatch’d out of his Mouth, and sack’d by a Titannick Force, therefore he then sought means to preserve his Walls, Bastions, Rampiers, and Sconces from Cannon-shot, and to hinder the Bullets from hitting him, stopping them in their flight, or at least from doing him, or the Besiegers and Walls any damage; he show’d us a tryal of this, which has been since us’d by Fronton, and is now common among the Pastimes and harmless Recreations of the Thelemites. I’ll tell you how he went to work, and pray for the future be a little more ready to believe what Plutarch affirms to have try’d ; Suppose a Herd of Goats were all scampering as if the Devil drove ’em, do but put a bit of Eringo into the Mouth of the hindmost Nanny, and they will all stop stock-still, in the time you can tell three. Thus Gaster, having caus’d a Brass Faulkon to be charg’d, with a sufficient quantity of Gunpowder, well purg’d from its Sulphur, and curiously made up with fine Camphir, he then had a suitable Ball put into the Piece, with twenty four little pellets like Hail-shot, some round, some pearl fashion, then taking his aim, and levelling it at a Page of his, as if he would have hit him on the Breast, about sixty strides off the Piece, half way between it and the Page in a right Line , he hang’d on a Gibbet by a Rope a very large Siderite or iron-like Stone, otherwise call’d Herculean, formerly found on Ida in Phrygia by one Magnes as Nicander writes, and commonly call’d Load-stone; Then he gave Fire to the Prime on the Piece’s Touch-hole, which in an instant consuming the Powder, the Ball and Hail-shot, were with incredible violence and swiftness hurried out of the Gun at its Muzzle, that the Air might penetrate to its Chamber, where otherwise would have been a Vacuum; which Nature abhors so much that this Universal Machine, Heaven, Air, Land, and Sea, would sooner return to the Primitive Chaos than admit the least void any where. Now the Ball and small shot which threaten’d the Page with no less than quick Destruction, lost their impetuosity, and remain’d suspended and hovering round the Stone, nor did any one of them, notwithstanding the fury with which they rush’d, reach the Page. Master Gaster could do more than all this yet, if you’ll believe me, for he invented a way how to cause Bullets to fly backwards, and recoyl on those that sent ’em, with as great a force, and in the very numerical parallel for which the Guns were planted. And indeed, why should he have thought this difficult, seeing the Herb Ethiopis opens all Locks whatsoever, and an Echineis or Remora, a silly weakly Fish, in spight of all the Winds that blow from the 32 Points of the Compass , will in the midst of a Hurricane make you the biggest First Rate remain stock still as if she were becalm’d, or the Blustering Tribe had blown their last; nay, and with the Flesh of that Fish preserv’d with Salt, you may fish Gold out of the deepest Well that was ever sounded with a Plummet, for it will certainly draw up the precious Metal, since Democritus affirm’d it. Theophrastus believ’d and experienc’d that there was an Herb at whose single touch an Iron Wedge tho never so far driven into a huge log of the hardest Wood that is, would presently come out, and ’tis this same Herb your Hickways, alias Woodpeckers use, when with some mighty Ax any one stops up the hole of their Nests, which they industriously dig and make in the Trunk of some sturdy Tree. Since Stags and Hinds when deeply wounded with Darts, Arrows, and Bolts, if they do but meet the Herb call’d Dittany, which is common in Candia, and eat a little of it, presently the shafts come out, and all’s well again; even as kind Venus cur’d her Beloved By-blow Æneas, when he was wounded on the right Thigh with an Arrow by Juturna Turnus’s Sister. Since the very Wind of Laurels, Fig-trees, or Sea-calves, makes the Thunder sheer off, insomuch that it never strikes them. Since at the sight of a Ram, mad Elephants recover their former Sences; since mad Bulls coming near wild Fig-trees call’d Caprifici grow tame, and will not budge a foot, as if they had the Cramp. Since the Venomous rage of Vipers is asswag’d, if you but touch them with a Beechen Bough. Since also Euphorion writes, that in the Isle of Samos, before Juno’s Temple was Built there, he had seen some Beasts call’d Neades, whose voice made the neighbouring places gape and sink into a Chasm and Abyss. In short, since Elders grow of a more pleasing Sound, and fitter to make Flutes in such places where the crowing of Cocks is not heard, as the Ancient Sages have writ, and Theophrastus relates; as if the crowing of a Cock dull’d, flatten’d and perverted the Wood of the Elder, as it is said to astonish and stupify with fear that strong and resolute Animal, a Lion. I know that some have understood this of wild Elder, that grows so far from Towns or Villages that the crowing of Cocks cannot reach near it; and doubtless that sort ought to be preferr’d to the stenching common Elder that grows about decay’d and ruin’d places; but others have understood this in a higher sence, not litteral, but allegorical, according to the method of the Pythagoreans. As when it was said that Mercury’s Statue could not be made of every sort of Wood, to which Sentence they give this sence; That God is not to be worshipp’d in a vulgar form, but in a chosen and religious manner. In the same manner by this Elder, which grows far from places where Cocks are heard, the Ancients meant, that the wise and studious ought not to give their minds to trivial or vulgar Musick, but to that which is Celestial, Divine, Angelical, more abstracted and brought from remoter parts, that is from a Region where the crowing of Cocks is not heard; for, to denote a solitary and unfrequented place, we say, Cocks are never heard to crow there."
"– Le mariage, dit Panurge, je concède, je nie le demeurant[31] et vous prie me faire ce bien de croire que jamais homme n’eut en femme et en chevaux heur[32] tel que m’est prédestiné. »","“Marriage,” said Panurge, “I concede, I deny the rest [31] and beg you to do me the good of believing that never man had in wife and horses luck [32] such as is predestined to me. »","‘I concede the marriage,’ said Panurge, ‘and deny the rest. I beseech you to do me the favour of believing that never had man such luck over women and horses as is predestined to me.’ How Panurge takes counsel from an aged French poet called Raminagrobis","As for the marriage (quoth Panurge) I yield thereto, and acknowledge the verity of that point of his Prediction; as for the rest I utterly abjure and deny it: and believe Sir, I beseech you, if it may please you so to do, that in the matter of Wives and Horses, never any Man was predestinated to a better Fortune than I."

"Les premiers jours ainsi passés et les cloches remises en leur lieu, les citoyens de Paris, par reconnaissance de cette honnêteté, s’offrirent d’entretenir et nourrir sa jument tant qu’il lui plairait – ce que Gargantua prit bien à gré, – et l’envoyèrent vivre en la forêt de Bière. Je crois qu’elle n’y soit plus maintenant.","The first days thus passed and the bells returned to their place, the citizens of Paris, in recognition of this honesty, offered to maintain and feed his mare as long as he pleased – which Gargantua took very willingly – and sent him to live in the forest of Beer. I don't think she's there now.","The ‘Comic’ cited is Terence, probably not directly but from two adages of Erasmus, II, II, XVIII, ‘ His mind is on the scourge’, and III, VII, XXX, ‘ His mind is on the leather’, both of which cite Terence’s line, ‘His mind is on the wine-cups’.] After the first days thus spent and the bells restored, the citizens of Paris, grateful for such generosity, offered to feed the mare and look after her for as long as Gargantua liked – which pleased him very much – and so they sent her away to the Forest of Bière. [She is no longer there, I think.]","THE first day being thus spent, and the bells put up again in their own place, the Citizens of Paris, in acknowledgement of this courtesie, offered to maintain and feed his Mare as long as he pleased, which Gargantua took in good part, and they sent her to graze in the forrest of Biere. I think she is not there now."
"Les Gastrolâtres, d’un autre côté, se tenaient serrés par troupes et par bandes, joyeux, mignards, douillets aucuns[8], autres tristes, graves, sévères, rechignes, tous ocieux[9], rien ne faisants, point ne travaillants, poids et charge inutile de la terre, comme dit Hésiode, craignants, selon qu’on pouvait juger, le ventre offenser et emmaigrir. Au reste masqués, déguisés et vêtus tant étrangement que c’était belle chose. Vous dites, et est écrit par plusieurs sages et antiques philosophes, que l’industrie de nature appert[10] merveilleuse en l’ébattement[11] qu’elle semble avoir pris formant les coquilles de mer, tant y voit-on de variété, tant de figures, tant de couleurs, tant de traits et formes non imitables par art. Je vous assure qu’en la vêture de ces Gastrolâtres coquillons[12] ne vîmes moins de diversité et déguisement. Ils tous tenaient Gaster pour leur grand dieu ; l’adoraient comme dieu, lui sacrifiaient comme à leur dieu omnipotent, ne reconnaissaient d’autre dieu que lui, le servaient, aimaient sur toutes choses, honoraient comme leur dieu. Vous eussiez dit que proprement d’eux avait le saint Envoyé écrit, Philippens. 3 : « Plusieurs sont desquels je vous ai souvent parlé encore présentement je le vous dis les larmes à l’œil) ennemis de la croix du Christ, desquels mort sera la consommation, desquels ventre est le dieu. » Pantagruel les comparait au cyclope Polyphémus, lequel Euripides fait parler comme s’ensuit : « Je ne sacrifie qu’à moi, aux dieux point, et à cetui mon ventre, le plus grand de tous les dieux. »","The Gastroâtres, on the other hand, stood huddled together in troops and bands, joyful, cute, cozy none [8], others sad, serious, severe, reluctant, all ocieux [9], nothing doing, not working , useless weight and burden of the earth, as Hesiod says, fearful, as one could judge, the belly offend and lose weight. For the rest masked, disguised and dressed so strangely that it was a beautiful thing. You say, and is written by several wise and ancient philosophers, that the industry of nature appears[10] marvelous in the excitement[11] which it seems to have taken forming the shells of the sea, so much variety do we see there , so many figures, so many colors, so many lines and shapes that cannot be imitated by art. I assure you that in the clothing of these Gastro-lathish shells[12] I saw no less diversity and disguise. They all held Gaster to be their great god; worshiped him as a god, sacrificed to him as to their omnipotent god, recognized no other god but him, served him, loved above all things, honored him as their god. You would have said that properly from them had the holy Envoy written, Philippians. 3: “Several are of whom I have often spoken to you (even now I tell you with tears in my eyes) enemies of the cross of Christ, whose death will be the consummation, whose belly is the god. Pantagruel compared them to the Cyclops Polyphemus, whom Euripides makes speak as follows: ""I sacrifice only to myself, to the gods not, and to this my belly, the greatest of all the gods."" »","The Gastrolaters were in another place, huddled together in groups and bands, some merry, elegant and cuddly, others sad, grave, severe and sour: all lazy, doing nothing, never working, ‘a useless load and burden on the world’, as Hesiod put it. They were (as far as one could judge) terrified of offending and pinching their belly, and what is more so bizarrely masked, cloaked and disguised that it was a sight to see. You say – and it is written by several wise philosophers of Antiquity – that the intelligent workings of Nature are wondrously revealed in the joyous abandon she seems to show in the forming of sea-shells: we find such variety in them, so many shapes and colours, so many lines and forms inimitable by art. Well, I can assure you that in the vestment-shells of those Gastrolaters we noticed no less diversity and disguises. They all held Gaster to be their great God; they worshipped him as God; sacrificed to him as to their God Almighty. They had no other God before him; they served him and loved him above all things; and as their God they hallowed him. You could say that the Holy Apostle was writing specifically of them in Philippians 3: Tor many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping tears: enemies of the Cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly.’ Pantagruel compared him with the Cyclops Polyphemus, to whom Euripides attributes the following: ‘I never sacrifice to the gods: only to me, and to the greatest of all the gods, this my belly.’ Of the absurd statue called Manduces; and how and what the Gastrolaters sacrificed to their Ventripotent God CHAPTER 59 [Carnivalesque fun at the expente of a frightening idol and the sacrifices offered to it by its monkish worshippers. Rabelais draws in detail upon the explanation by Erasmus of an adage, IV, VIII, XXXII, ‘Manduces’ (a term applied to the extremely hungry and thence to a carnival-type figure in Antiquity with clacking wooden teeth. The name of the equivalent figure at Lyons in the time of Rabelais was Maschecrotte or Mâchecroutte.","As for the Gastrolaters, they stuck close to one another in Knots and Gangs. Some of them Merry, Wanton, and Soft as so many Milksops; others lowring, grim, dogged, demure and crabbed, all idle, mortal foes to business, spending half their Time in sleeping, and the rest in doing nothing, a Rent-charge and dead unnecessary Weight on the Earth, as Hesiod saith; afraid (as we judg’d) of offending or lessening their Paunch. Others were mask’d, disguis’d, and so oddly dress’d, that ’twould have done you good to have seen them. There’s a Saying, and several Ancient Sages write, That the Skill of Nature appears wonderful in the Pleasure which she seems to have taken in the Configuration of Sea-shells, so great is their Variety in figures, colours, streaks, and inimitable shapes. I protest the Variety we perceiv’d in the Dresses of the Gastrolatrous Coquillons was not less. They all own’d Gaster for their Supreme God, ador’d him as a God, offer’d him Sacrifices as to their Omnipotent Deity, own’d no other God, serv’d, lov’d, and honour’d him above all things. You would have thought that the Holy Apostle spoke of those, when he said, Phil. Chap. 3. Many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are Enemies of the Cross of Christ: whose End is Destruction, whose God is their Belly. Pantagruel compar’d them to the Cyclops Polyphemus, whom Euripides brings in speaking thus, I only Sacrifice to my self (not to the Gods) and to this Belly of Mine, the greatest of all the Gods."

I have (answered Panurge) a Flea in mine Ear, and have a mind to marry."
"« Plus dit qu’elle sera villatique[7] et plaisante comme une belle cornemuse de Saulieu ou de Busançay. Le véridique Triboulet bien a connu mon naturel et mes internes affections, car je vous affirme que plus me plaisent les gaies bergerettes échevelées, esquelles le cul sent le serpolet, que les dames des grandes cours avec leurs riches atours et odorants parfums de maujoint[8]. Plus me plaît le son de la rustique cornemuse que les fredonnements des luths, rebecs et violons auliques[9]. Il m’a donné un coup de poing sur ma bonne femme d’échine. Pour l’amour de Dieu soit, et en déduction de tant moins de peines du purgatoire. Il ne le faisait par mal. Il pensait frapper quelque page. Il est fol de bien, innocent, je vous affie[10], et pèche qui de lui mal pense. Je lui pardonne de bien bon cœur. Il me nasardait : ce sont petites folâtreries entre ma femme et moi, comme advient à tous nouveaux mariés. »","“More says that she will be villatic[7] and pleasant like a beautiful bagpiper from Saulieu or Busançay. The truthful Triboulet well knew my nature and my inner affections, for I tell you that I like more the gay disheveled bergerettes, whose ass smells of thyme, than the ladies of the great courts with their rich finery and fragrant perfumes of maujoint[8]. ]. I like the sound of rustic bagpipes more than the humming of lutes, rebecs and aulic violins. He punched me in the back of my good wife. For the love of God be it, and in deduction so much less pains of the purgatory. He wasn't doing it wrong. He thought he was hitting some page. He is mad about good, innocent, I affie you[10], and sins which of him thinks ill. I forgive him wholeheartedly. He snarled at me: it's little frolics between my wife and me, as happens to all newlyweds. »","‘More. He implies that she will be a country-maid, as sweet and lovely as bagpipes from Saulieu or Buzançais. That veracious Triboullet has well understood my nature and my inner feelings; for I promise you that I’m more delighted by merry, loose-haired little shepherd-girls whose bums smell of Our-Lady’s-bedstraw than by those ladies in our great courts with their rich fineries and their cracks pungently smelling of navel-wort. I take more pleasure in rustic bagpipes than in the strumming of lutes, rebecs and aulic violins. ‘Triboullet gave me a thump with his fist on me poor ole spine. By God’s love, so be it: so much off the pains of purgatory! He meant no harm: he thought he was thumping some lackey or other. He is, I assure you, a good fool, an innocent. Whoever thinks ill of him is committing a sin. I forgive him with all my heart. ‘He did tweak my nose: that means those little endearments between my wife and me as happens to all newly weds.’ How Pantagruel and Panurge decide on visiting the Dive Bouteille","Withal he meant by another part of his Discourse, that she should be of a Jovial Country- like Humour, as gay and pleasing as a harmonious Hornepipe of Saulian or Buzansay. The veridical Triboulet did therein hint at what I liked well, as perfectly knowing the Inclinations and Propensions of my Mind, my natural Disposition, and the Biass of my interior Passions and Affections : For you may be assured, that my Humour is much better satisfied and contented with the pretty frolick rural discheveled Shepheardesses, whose Bums through their coarse Canvas Smocks smell of the Claver-grass of the Field, than with those great Ladies in Magnifick Courts, with their Flandan, Topknots and Sultana ’s, their Polvil, Postillo’s and Cosmeticks. The homely sound likeways of a Rustical Hornepipe, is more agreeable to my Ears, than the curious Warblings and musical Quavering of Lutes, Teorbes, Viols, Rebecks and Violins. He gave me a lusty rapping thwack on my Back. What then? Let it pass in the Name and for the Love of God, as an Abatement of, and Deduction from so much of my future Pains in Purgatory. He did it not out of any evil intent: He thought belike to have hit some of the Pages: He is an honest Fool, and an innocent Changeling. It is a Sin to harbour in the Heart any bad Conceit of him. As for my self, I heartily pardon him. He flirted me on the Nose: In that there is no harm; for it importeth nothing else, but that betwixt my Wife and me there will occur some toyish wanton Tricks, which usually happen to all new married Folks."

"Puis leva en l’air plus haut la dite main gauche, étendant tous les cinq doigts d’icelle et les éloignant uns des autres, tant qu’éloigner pouvait. « Ici, dit Pantagruel, plus amplement nous insinue, par signification du nombre quinaire que serez marié, et non seulement effiancé[8], épousé et marié, mais en outre qu’habiterez et serez bien avant de fête. Car Pythagoras appelait le nombre quinaire nombre nuptial, noces et mariage consommé, pour cette raison qu’il est composé de trias, qui est nombre premier impair et superflu, et de dias, qui est nombre premier pair, comme de mâle et de femelle couplés[9] ensemble. De fait, à Rome, jadis, au jour des noces, on allumait cinq flambeaux de cire, et n’était licite d’en allumer plus, fut ès noces des plus riches, ni moins, fut ès noces des plus indigents. D’avantage[10], on[11] temps passé, les païens imploraient cinq dieux, ou un dieu en cinq bénéfices, sur ceux que l’on mariait : Jupiter nuptial, Juno, présidente de la fête, Vénus la belle, Pitho, déesse de persuasion et beau parler, et Diane, pour secours on travail d’enfantement.","Then lifted the said left hand higher in the air, extending all five fingers of it and drawing them away from each other, as far as possible. “Here, says Pantagruel, more fully insinuates to us, by meaning of the quinary number that you will be married, and not only effiancé[8], married and married, but also that you will live and be well before the feast. Because Pythagoras called the quinary number nuptial number, nuptials and consummated marriage, for this reason that it is composed of trias, which is an odd and superfluous prime number, and of dias, which is an even prime number, like male and female coupled [9] together. In fact, in Rome, long ago, on wedding day, five wax candles were lit, and it was not lawful to light more, was at the wedding of the richest, nor less, was at the wedding of the most destitute. Moreover[10], one[11] time passed, the pagans implored five gods, or a god in five benefits, on those which one married: Jupiter nuptial, Juno, president of the festival, Venus the beautiful, Pitho , goddess of persuasion and beautiful speech, and Diana, for help or childbirth.","Then Nazdecabre raised his left hand higher up in the air, extended all five fingers, stretching them as widely apart as he could. ‘Here,’ said Pantagruel, ‘by signifying the number five, he more amply suggests that you will be married. And not merely betrothed, engaged and married, but you will lie together and live it up. For Pythagoras called Five the number for nuptials, weddings and consummated marriages, because it is a compound of Three (the first odd, superflue number) and Two (the first even number), representing male and female conjoined. In Rome they used indeed to light five wax torches on the wedding-night, and it was forbidden to light more even for the nuptials of the richest, or fewer, even for the nuptials of the most indigent. Moreover, in days gone by, pagans used to invoke five gods (or one god dispensing five boons) over those who were being married: Nuptial Jove, Juno, who presided over the marriage-feast, Venus the Beautiful, Pytho, the goddess of persuasion and fair converse, and Diana for succour in the labours of childbirth.’","Then did he lift higher up than before his said left Hand, stretching out all the five Fingers thereof, and severing them as wide from one another as he possibly could get done. Here (says Pantagruel) doth he more amply and fully insinuate unto us, by the Token which he sheweth forth of the Quinary number, that you shall be married. Yea, that you shall not only be affianced, betrothed, wedded, and married, but that you shall furthermore cohabit, and live jollily and merrily with your Wife; for Pythagoras called five the Nuptial Number, which together with marriage, signifieth the Consummation of Matrimony, because it is composed of a ternary, the first of the odd, and binary, the first of the even Numbers, as of a Male and Female knit and united together. In very deed it was the fashion of old in the City of Rome at Marriage Festivals to light five wax Tapers, nor was it permitted to kindle any more at the magnifick Nuptials of the most Potent and Wealthy; nor yet any fewer at the penurious Weddings of the Poorest and most Abject of the World. Moreover in times past, the Heathen or Paynims implored the Assistance of five Deities, or of one helpful (at least) in five several good Offices to those that were to be married: Of this sort were the Nuptial Jove, Juno, President of the Feast, the fair Venus, Pitho the Goddess of Eloquence and Perswasion, and Diana, whose aid and succour was required to the labour of Child-bearing."

"– Voire, répondit Panurge, mais les cuisiniers des diables rêvent quelquefois et errent en leur office, et mettent souvent bouillir ce qu’on destinait pour rôtir, comme en la cuisine de céans les maîtres queux souvent lardent perdrix, ramiers et bizets[14], en intention (comme est vraisemblable) de les mettre rôtir. Advient toutefois que les perdrix aux choux, les ramiers aux pourreaux et les bizets ils mettent bouillir aux naveaux.","“Very well,” replied Panurge, “but the cooks of the devils sometimes dream and wander about in their office, and often put to boil what was intended for roasting, as in the kitchen here the master cooks often roast partridges, pigeons and bizets[14] , with the intention (as is probable) to put them to roast. It happens, however, that the partridges with cabbage, the pigeons with pourreaux and the bizets they put boil in the naveaux.","‘Maybe,’ replied Panurge, ‘but the devil’s chefs sometimes go mad and err in their duties: they often put souls on to boil which were meant to be roasted [, just as in our kitchens here below the cooks often lard up their partridges, pigeons and queests, presumably intending to roast them, only to end up boiling them, the partridges with cabbage; the pigeons with leeks, and the queests with turnips.","Ay, ay, reply’d Panurge, but the Devil’s Cooks dote sometimes, and are apt to make horrid blunders as well as others, often putting to boyle in water what was design’d to be roasted on the fire, like the head Cooks of our Kitchin, who often lard Partridges, Queests and Stockdoves with intent to roast them, one wou’d think, but it happens sometimes, that they e’en turn the Partridges into the Pot to be boyl’d with Cabbages, the Queests with leek Porradge, and the Stockdoves with Turnips."
"– Car, dit Pantagruel, continuant, comme les chameaux et dromadaires en la caravane boivent pour la soif passée, pour la soif présente et pour la soif future, ainsi fit Hercules. De mode que, par cetui excessif haussement de temps, advint au ciel nouveau mouvement de titubation[13] et trépidation, tant controversé et débattu entre les fols astrologues.","“For,” said Pantagruel, continuing, “as the camels and dromedaries in the caravan drink for past thirst, for present thirst, and for future thirst, so did Hercules. In fashion that, by this excessive rise in time, there came to heaven a new movement of staggering[13] and trepidation, so controversial and debated among mad astrologers.","‘… for,’ continued Pantagruel, ‘just as the camels and dromedaries in the caravan drink for thirsts past, thirsts present and thirsts to come, so did Hercules, and through such excessive raising of the weather there was produced a new motion in the heavens, a titubation-cum trepidation, the subject of much controversy and debate between foolish astrologers.’","Thus Atlas and Hercules clubb’d to raise and underprop the falling Sky, if you’ll believe the wise Mythologists; but they rais’d it some half an inch too high; Atlas to entertain his Guest Hercules more pleasantly, and Hercules to make himself amends for the thirst which sometime before had tormented him in the Deserts of Africa.—Your good Father, said Fryar Jhon, interrupting him, takes care to free many People from such an inconveniency; for I have been told by many venerable Doctors, that his chief Butler Turelupin saves above eighteen hundred Pipes of Wine yearly, to make Servants and all comers and goers drink before they are a dry.—As the Camels and Dromedaries of a Caravan, continued Pantagruel, use to drink for the thirst that’s past, for the present, and for that to come, so did Hercules; and being thus excessively rais’d, this gave a new motion to the Sky, which is that of Titubation and Trepidation, about which our crack-brain’d Astrologers make such a pother.—This, said Panurge, makes the saying good,"

The sixth was in the dish, hidden under a lettuce, except for its staff which appeared above, which seeing, Grandgousier said to Gargantua: “I believe that is the horn of a cochlea; don't eat it.","As the lettuces were being first washed at the fountain the pilgrims whispered softly to each other, ‘What’s to be done? We’re drowning here amongst these lettuce-leaves. Shall we say something? But if we do he will kill us as spies.’ And as they were pondering thus, Gargantua put them and the lettuces into a kitchen bowl as big as the wine-butt at Châteaux, and was eating them with some salt, oil and vinegar to cool himself down for supper. He had already ingurgitated five of the pilgrims. The sixth was hiding under a piece of lettuce in the bowl, but his staff stuck out above it. On noticing it, Grandgousier said to Gargantua, ‘That, I think, is a snail’s horn. Don’t eat it.’","Washing them therefore first at the fountain, the Pilgrims said one to another softly, What shall we do? we are almost drowned here amongst these lettice, shall we speak? but if we speak, he will kill us for spies: and, as they were thus deliberating what to do, Gargantua put them with the lettice into a platter of the house, as large as the huge tun of the white Friars of the Cistertian order, which done, with oile, vineger and salt he ate them up, to refresh himself a little before supper: and had already swallowed up five of the Pilgrims, the six being in the platter, totally hid under a lettice, except his bourdon or staffe that appeared, and nothing else.

At his cry and lamentation the whole neighborhood ran up, expecting[11] to see some admirable and monstrous childbirth; but in the end only a little mouse was born from her.","‘We mock them as we mock that Mountain in Horace which was hugely crying and lamenting like a woman in labour; at her cries and lamentation all the neighbours ran up, expecting to witness some wondrous and portentous childbirth, yet in the end all that was born of her was a trifling mouse.’","The Jest and Scorn thereof is not unlike to that of the Mountain of Horace, which by the Poet was made to cry out and lament most enormously as a Woman in the Pangs and Labour of Child-birth, at which deplorable and exorbitant Cries and Lamentations the whole Neighbourhood being assembled in expectation to see some marvellous monstrous Production, could at last perceive no other but the paultry ridiculous Mouse."
"– Corpe de galline[6] ! répondit frère Jean, j’en sais mieux l’usage et cérémonies que de tant chiabrener[7] avec ces femmes, magni, magna, chiabrena, révérence, double, reprise, l’accolade, la fressurade[8], baise la main de votre merci, de votre majesta, vous soyez, tarabin, tarabas. Bren ! c’est merde à Rouen. Tant chiasser et ureniller ! Dea[9], je ne dis pas que je n’en tirasse quelque trait dessus la lie à mon lourdois[10], qui me laissât insinuer ma nomination. Mais cette brenasserie de révérences me fâche plus qu’un jeune diable : je voulais dire un jeûne double. Saint Benoît n’en mentit jamais.","– Galline Body[6]! answered Brother Jean, I know better the use and the ceremonies of it than to chiabrener[7] so much with these women, magni, magna, chiabrena, reverence, double, recovery, the accolade, the fressurade[8], kiss the hand of your mercy, of your majesta, you be, tarabin, tarabas. Bren! it's shit in Rouen. Both babbling and urinating! Dea[9], I do not say that I did not draw some line from it on the dregs of my heavyweight[10], which let me insinuate my appointment. But this brewing of bows annoys me more than a young devil: I meant a double fast. Saint Benedict never lied about it.","‘Body of Chick!’ replied Frère Jean, ‘I know the customs and ceremonials of kitchens better than all that squitty-shittying about with women: Magny, magna, squitty-shitty. bow twice, do it again; arms round their necks then touch their guts: I kiss the hands of Vuestra Merced, of Vostra Majestà; Be you welcome, tiddly-pom.21 ‘Bren – that’s shit in Rouen – all that mucking and piddling about! I don’t say, mind you, that in my rough old way I would never stir up the dregs if some lady permitted me to slip in my nomination: but all that squittery of bowing and scraping bores me more than a double-fasting devil – I meant a devilish double-fast – on the subject of which Saint Benedick never lied.",", How is’t, Hatchet? she answer’d him, at your service, dear Helve. Odds Belly, saith Carpalin, this Helve and this Hatchet are well match’d. As we went on, I saw one who, calling his she Relation, styl’d her my Crum, and she call’d him my Crust. Quoth one to a brisk, plump, juicy Female, I am glad to see you, dear Tap: so am I to find you so merry, sweet Spiggot, reply’d she. One call’d a wench his Shovel , she call’d him her Peal. One nam’d his, my Slipper, and she him, my Foot. Another my Boot, she my Shasoon. In the same degree of Kindred, one call’d his, my Butter, she call’d him, my Eggs; and they were akin just like a Dish of Butter’d Eggs. I heard one call his, my Tripe, and she him, my Faggot. Now I could not for the Heart’s Blood of me pick out or discover what Parentage, Alliance, Affinity, or Consanguinity was between them, with reference to our Custom, only they told us, that she was Faggot’s Tripe: [Tripe de Faggot means the smallest sticks in a Faggot.] Another Complementing his Convenient, said, yours, my Shell; she reply’d, I was yours before , sweet Oyster: I reckon, said Carpalin, she hath gutted his Oyster. Another long-shank’d ugly Rogue, mounted upon a pair of highheel’d Wooden Slippers, meeting a strapping, fusty squobb’d Dowdy, says to her, how’st my Top? she was short upon him, and arrogantly reply’d, never the better for you, my Whip. By St. Anthony’s Hog, said Xenomanes, I believe so, for how can this Whip be sufficient to lash this Top? A College-Professor well provided with Cod, and poudered and prink’d up, having a while discoursed with a great Lady, taking his leave, with these words, Thank you Sweet Meat; she cry’d , there needs no thanks, Sower Sauce. Saith Pantagruel, this is not altogether incongruous, for sweet Meat must have sower Sawce. A Wooden Loggerhead said to a young Wench, ’Tis long since I saw you Bag, all the better, cry’d she, Pipe. Set ’em together, said Panurge, then blow in their Arses, ’twill be a Bagpipe. We saw after that a diminutive hump-back’d Gallant, pretty near us, taking leave of a she relation of his, thus, Fare thee well, Friend Hole; she repartee’d, save thee, Friend Peg. Quoth Fryar Jhon, what could they say more, were he all Peg and she all Hole: But now would I give something to know if every Crany of the Hole can be stopp’d up with that same Peg. A Baudy Batchelor talking with an old Trout, was saying, Remember it, Rusty Gun. I won’t fail, said she, Scowrer. Do you reckon these two to be akin, said Pantagruel to the Mayor? I rather take them to be Foes; in our Country a Woman would take this as a mortal affront. Good People of t’ other World, reply’d the Mayor, you have few such and so near Relations as this Gun and Scowerer are to one another; for they both came out of one Shop. What, was the Shop their Mother, quoth Panurge? What Mother, said the Mayor, does the Man mean? That must be some of your Worlds Affinity; we have here neither Father nor Mother: Your little paultry fellows that live on t’ other side the Water, poor Rogues, Booted with Wisps of Hay, may indeed have such, but we scorn it. The good Pantagruel stood gazing and listning, but at these words he had like to have lost all Patience; ὡς καὶ νῦν ὁ ἑρμηνεντής Π. M. Having very exactly viewed the Situation of the Island, and the way of living of the Ennased Nation, we went to take a Cup of the Creature at a Tavern where there happen’d to be a Wedding after the manner of the Country; bating that shocking Custom, there was special good Chear. While we were there, a pleasant Match was struck up betwixt a Female call’d Pear (a tight thing as we thought, but by some who knew better things, said to be quaggy and flabby) and a young soft Male, call’d Cheese, somewhat sandy. In our Country indeed we say, Il ne fut onc tel marriage, qu’est de la Poire et du Fromage, There’s no Match like that made between the Pear and the Cheese; and in many other Places good store of such Bargains have been driven. Besides, when the women are at their last Prayers, ’tis to this day a noted saying, That after Cheese comes nothing. In another Room I saw them marrying an old greasy Boot to a young pliable Buskin. Pantagruel was told, that young Buskin took old Boot to have and to hold, because she was of special Leather, in good case and wax’d, sear’d, liquor’d, and greas’d to the purpose, even tho’ it had been for the Fisherman that went to Bed with his Boots on. In another Room below I saw a young Brogue taking a young Slipper for better for worse: Which, they told us, was neither for the sake of her Piety, Parts, or Person, but for the fourth comprehensive P, Portion; the Spankers, Spur-royals, Rose-Nobles, and other Coriander Seed with which she was quilted all over. CHAPTER X How Pantagruel went ashoar at the Island of Chely, where he saw King St. Panigon. WE sail’d right before the Wind which we had at West, leaving those odd Alliancers with their Ace of Clubs Snouts, and having taken height by the Sun, stood in for Chely, a large, Fruitful, Wealthy, and well Peopled Island. King St. Panigon first of the Name Reign’d there, and attended by the Princes his Sons, and the Nobles of his Court, came as far as the Port to receive Pantagruel, and conducted him to his Palace, near the Gate of which , the Queen attended by the Princesses her Daughters and the Court Ladies, received us. Panigon directed her and all her Retinue to salute Pantagruel and his Men with a Kiss; for such was the Civil Custom of the Country; and they were all fairly buss’d accordingly, except Fryar Jhon, who stept aside and sneak’d off among the King’s Officers. Panigon us’d all the entreaties imaginable, to persuade Pantagruel to tarry there that day and the next, but he would needs be gone, and excus’d himself upon the opportunity of Wind and Weather, which being oftener desir’d than enjoy’d, ought not to be neglected when it comes. Panigon having heard these reasons, let us go, but first made us take off some five and twenty or thirty Bumpers each. Pantagruel returning to the Port, miss’d Fryar Jhon, and ask’d why he was not with the rest of the Company? Panurge could not tell how to excuse him, and would have gone back to the Palace to call him, when Fryar Jhon overtook them, and merrily cry’d, Long live the noble Panigon; as I love my Belly, he minds good Eating, and keeps a noble House, and a dainty Kitchen; I have been there, Boys, every thing goes about by dozens, I was in good hopes to have stufed my Puddings there like a Monk! What! always in a Kitchin, Friend? (said Pantagruel) By the Belly of St. Cramcapon, quoth the Fryar, I understand the Customs and Ceremonies which are us’d there, much better than all the formal Stuff, antick Postures, and nonsensical Fidle-fadle that must be us’d with those Women, magni, magna, Shittencumshita, Cringes, Grimaces, Scrapes, Bowes, and Congées; double Honours this way, tripple Salutes that way, the Embrace, the Grasp, the Squeeze, the Hug, the Leer, the Smack, baso las manos de vostra merce, de vostra Maesta. You are most tarabin, tarabas, Stront, that’s downright Dutch, why all this ado? I don’t say but a Man might be for a bit by the by and away, to be doing as well as his Neighbours; but this little nasty Cringing and Curtising made me as mad as any March Devil."
"En l’autre, deux ou trois miroirs ardents dont il faisait enrager aucunes fois les hommes et les femmes et leur faisait perdre contenance à l’église, car il disait qu’il n’y avait qu’un antistrophe entre femme folle à la messe et femme molle à la fesse.","In the other, two or three burning mirrors with which he sometimes enraged men and women and made them lose their countenance in church, for he said that there was only an antistrophe between a mad woman at the mass and soft woman in the buttock.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","In another, he had a squib furnished with tinder, matches, stones to strike fire, and all other tackling necessary for it: in another, two or three burning glasses, wherewith he made both men and women sometimes mad, and in the Church put them quite out of countenance; for he said that there was but an Antistrophe, or little more difference then of a literal inversion between a woman, folle a la messe, and molle a la fesse; that is, foolish at the Masse, and of a plaint buttock."
"Panurge, comme un bouc étourdi, sort de la soute en chemise, ayant seulement un demi-bas de chausses en jambe, sa barbe toute mouchetée de miettes de pain, tenant en main un grand chat soubelin[1] attaché à l’autre demi-bas de ses chausses. Et remuant les babines comme un singe qui cherche poux en tête, tremblant et claquetant des dents, se tira vers frère Jean, lequel était assis sur le porte-hauban de tribord, et dévotement le pria avoir de lui compassion, et le tenir en sauvegarde de son braquemart[2], affirmant et jurant par sa part de papimanie qu’il avait à heure présente vu tous les diables déchaînés.","Panurge, like a stunned goat, comes out of the hold in his shirt, with only a half-stocking on his leg, his beard speckled with bread crumbs, holding in his hand a large Soubelin[1] cat attached to the other half -down his breeches. And wagging his lips like a monkey looking for lice in his head, trembling and chattering his teeth, he pulled himself towards Brother Jean, who was seated on the starboard stay-stay, and devoutly begged him to have compassion on him, and to keep him safe. of his braquemard[2], affirming and swearing by his share of papimania that he had at present seen all the devils unleashed.","Panurge came tumbling out of the bread-store like a giddy goat: he was in his shirt-sleeves, with his trunk-hose pulled on to only one leg and his beard all besprinkled with breadcrumbs; he was holding on to a large, sleek-haired cat clinging fast to his other stocking. Quivering his jowls like a monkey hunting for fleas in the head, trembling and clacking his teeth, he went over to Frère Jean (who was sitting on the starboard chains) and devoutly begged him to have compassion upon him and to keep him safe with his cutlass, insisting and swearing by his share in Papimania that he had that very hour seen all the devils raging loose from their chains.","PANURGE like a wild addle-pated giddy Goat, sallies out of the Bread Room in his Shirt, with nothing else about him but one of his Stockins, half on half off, about his Heel, like a rough-footed Pigeon, his Hair and Beard all bepowdered with Crums of Bread, in which he had been over Head and Ears, and a huge and mighty Pusse partly wrapt up in his other Stockin. In this Equipage, his Chops moving like a Monkey’s who’s a Louse-hunting , his Eyes staring like a dead Pig’s, his Teeth chattering, and his Bum quivering, the poor Dog fled to Fryar Jhon, who was then sitting by the Chain-Wales of the Starboard-side of the Ship, and pray’d him heartily to take pity on him, and keep him in the safeguard of his trusty Bilbo, swearing by his share of Papimany that he had seen all Hell broke loose."
"« Or, voyez ci que vous ferez, si bon vous semble. Apportez-moi les œuvres de Virgile, et par trois fois, avec l’ongle les ouvrants, explorerons, par les vers du nombre entre nous convenu, le sort futur de votre mariage, car, comme par sorts homériques souvent on a rencontré sa destinée, témoin Socrates, lequel, oyant[3] en prison réciter ce mètre[4] d’Homère dit d’Achille Iliad., IX:","“Now, see what you will do, if it seems good to you. Bring me the works of Virgil, and by three times, with the fingernail the openings, we will explore, by the verses of the number agreed between us, the future fate of your marriage, because, as by Homeric spells often we have met our destiny. , witness Socrates, who, hearing[3] in prison recite this meter[4] of Homer said of Achilles Iliad., IX:","‘Yet if it seems good to you, this is what you shall do. Bring me the works of Virgil; then opening them thrice with your nail, we shall, having agreed which numbered lines to take, reconnoitre the future lot of your marriage, just as many a man has discovered his destiny through Homeric lots: – witness Socrates, who, upon hearing recited in prison this line said of Achilles by Homer, Iliad, 9, ‘′HματI ϰέν τϱιτAτω φθIην έϱIβωλον IϰοIμην I shall arrive without a long delay","It lieth not in my Power to give you any other manner of Assurance, or otherways to certifie you of what shall ensue on this your Undertaking. Nevertheless (if it please you) this you may do, Bring hither Virgil’s Poems, that after having opened the Book, and with our Fingers sever’d the Leaves thereof three several times, we may, according to the number agreed upon betwixt our selves, explore the future Hap of your intended Marriage: For frequently, by a Homerick Lottery, have many hit upon their Destinies; as is testified in the Person of Socrates, who, whilst he was in Prison, hearing the Recitation of this Verse of Homer, said of Achilles, in the Ninth of the Iliads, Ἤματί κεν τριτάτῳ Φθίην ἐρίβωλον ἱκοίμην. We, the third day, to fertile Phthia came. Thereby foresaw that on the third subsequent day he was to die: Of the truth whereof he assured Æschines, as Plato, in Critone; Cicero, in primo de Divinatione; Diogenes Laertius, and others, have to the full recorded in their Works."
"– Assez mal, répondit Panurge.","“Pretty badly,” replied Panurge.",‘Hardly!’ said Panurge.,"Little enough of Conscience, said Panurge.—And then, continued Homenas, they were miraculously transmitted to us here from the very Heaven of Heavens in the same manner as the River Nile is call’d Diipetes, by Homer the Father of all Philosophy (the holy Decretals always excepted.)"
"Partants de Rouen, arrivèrent à Hommefleur[7] où se mirent sur mer Pantagruel, Panurge, Épistémon, Eusthènes et Carpalim.

"Semblablement, ou allaient voir comment on tirait les métaux, ou comment on fondait l’artillerie, ou allaient voir les lapidaires, orfèvres et tailleurs de pierreries, ou les alchimistes et monnayeurs, ou les hautelissiers[4], les tissotiers[5], les veloutiers[6], les horlogers, miralliers[7], imprimeurs, organistes[8], teinturiers, et autres telles sortes d’ouvriers, et partout donnants le vin, apprenaient et considéraient l’industrie et invention des métiers.","Similarly, where they went to see how metals were made, or how artillery was cast, or where they went to see the lapidaries, goldsmiths and gem cutters, or the alchemists and coiners, or the hautelissiers[4], the weavers[5], velvet makers[6], watchmakers, miralliers[7], printers, organists[8], dyers, and other such sorts of workmen, and everywhere giving wine, learned and considered industry and the invention of trades.","Or else they would go and see how metals are extruded or artillery-pieces cast; or else they would go and visit the jewellers, goldsmiths, gem-cutters or alchemists and minters of coins, or the weavers of fair tapestries, cloth-workers, velvet-makers, clock-makers, looking-glass-makers, printers, organ-builders, dyers and other similar craftsmen; they gave pourboires to everyone, noting the skills and weighing the originality of those trades.","They went likewise to see the drawing of mettals, or the casting of great ordnance: how the Lapidaries did work, as also the Goldsmiths and Cutters of precious stones: nor did they omit to visit the Alchymists, moneycoiners, Upholsters, Weavers, Velvet-workers, Watchmakers, Looking-glasse-framers, Printers, Organists, and other such kinde of Artificers, and every where giving them somewhat to drink, did learne and consider the industry and invention of the trades."
"De là partant, passai entre les rochers qui étaient ses dents et fis tant que je montai sur une, et là trouvai les plus beaux lieux du monde, beaux grands jeux de paume, belles galeries, belles prairies, force vignes et une infinité de cassines à la mode italique par les champs pleins de délices, et là demeurai bien quatre mois, et ne fis onques telle chère que pour lors.","From there, I passed between the rocks which were his teeth and did as much as I climbed on one, and there found the most beautiful places in the world, beautiful big tennis courts, beautiful galleries, beautiful meadows, many vines and an infinity of cassines in the Italic fashion through the fields full of delights, and there I remained well four months, and never made such a dear except for then.","Thus did Alexander of Macedon become the emperor of the whole world; thus was Hercules possessed of all the mainland, delivering mankind from monsters, oppression, exactions and tyrannies, governing and treating them well, maintaining them in equity and justice, founding for them benign constitutions and laws appropriate to the site of each country, supplying what was lacking, turning to profit whatever was abundant, forgiving the past and casting all previous offences into eternal oblivion: such, after the tyrants were overthrown by the bravery and industry of Thrasybulus, was the ‘amnesty’ of the Athenians which was later expounded in Rome by Cicero and restored under the emperor Aurelian.","Parting from thence, I past amongst the rocks, which were his teeth, and never left walking, till I got up on one of them; and there I found the pleasantest places in the world, great large tennis-Courts, faire galleries, sweet meddows, store of Vines, and an infinite number of banqueting summer out-houses in the fields, after the Italian fashion, full of pleasure and delight, where I stayed full foure moneths, and never made better cheer in my life as then."

"Conséquemment était l’ost[10] des Indiens comme averti que Bacchus mettait leur pays en vastation[11]. En front étaient les éléphants chargés de tours, avec gens de guerre en nombre infini ; mais toute l’armée était en route[12], et contre eux et sur eux se tournaient et marchaient leurs éléphants, par le tumulte horrible des Bacchides et la terreur panique qui leur avait le sens tollu[13]. Là eussiez vu Silénus son âne aigrement talonner et s’escrimer de son bâton à la vieille escrime, son âne voltiger après les éléphants la gueule bée, comme s’il braillait, et braillant martialement (en pareille braveté que jadis éveilla la nymphe Lotis en pleins Bacchanales, quand Priapus, plein de priapisme, la voulait dormant priapiser sans la prier) sonnât l’assaut.","Consequently was the host[10] of the Indians as warned that Bacchus was putting their country in vastation[11]. In front were the elephants laden with towers, with men of war in infinite numbers; but the whole army was on the way[12], and against them and upon them turned and marched their elephants, by the horrible tumult of the Bacchids and the panic terror which had the sense of tollu[13] to them. There you would have seen Silénus his ass bitterly spurring and fencing with his stick in the old fencing, his ass fluttering after the elephants with its jaws agape, as if it were bawling, and bawling martially (in such bravery as the nymph Lotis once awoke in full Bacchanalia, when Priapus, full of priapism, wanted her sleeping to priapize without praying to her) sounded the assault.","In the following, the army of the Indians was portrayed as aware that Bacchus was laying waste to their land. To the fore were the elephants, with towers strapped on to them, and countless fighting men. But that entire army was routed, their elephants turning back and trampling over them because of the horrifying tumult of the Bacchides and the panic terror which had stripped them of their senses. There you would have seen Silenus fencing with his stave in the old style of swordsmanship and sharply spurring on that ass of his, which cavorted along after the elephants with its jaws agape as though it were braying a martial bray and sounding the attack, with a bravery equal to that with which it once awoke Lotis the Nymph at the height of the Bacchanalia, when Priapus, full of priapism, sought not to apprise her but to priapize her while she slept","We then saw the Indian Army, who had at last taken the Field, to prevent the Devastation of the rest of their Country. In the Front were the Elephants with Castles well garison’d on their backs. But the Army and themselves were put into Disorder; the dreadful Cries of the Bacchœ having fill’d them with Consternation, and those huge Animals turn’d Tail, and trampled on the Men of their Party. There you might have seen Gaffer Silenus on his Ass, putting on as hard as he could, striking athwart and alongst, and laying about him lustily with his Staff, after the old fashion of Fencing. His Ass was prancing and making after the Elephants, gaping and martially braying, as it were to sound a Charge, as he did when formerly in the Bacchanalian Feasts he wak’d the Nymph Lotis, when Priapus full of Priapism had a mind to priapise, while the pretty Creature was taking a Nap."
"« Au samedi subséquent, Villon eut avertissement que Tappecoue, sur la poultre du couvent (ainsi nomment-ils une jument non encore saillie), était allé en quête à Saint-Ligaire, et qu’il serait de retour sur les deux heures après midi.","""On the following Saturday, Villon received a warning that Tappecoue, on the poultre of the convent (thus they call a mare not yet mated), had gone in search of Saint-Ligaire, and that he would be back about two o'clock in the afternoon. .","On the following Saturday Villon was advised that Tappecoue, mounted on Foal – that was their name in the convent for a mare not yet leapt – had gone to Saint-Ligaire in quest of alms and would be on his way back by about two o’clock in the afternoon.","The Saturday following he had notice given him, that Tickletoby upon the Filly of the Convent (so they call a young Mare that was never leap’d yet) was gone a Mumping to St. Ligarius, and would be back about two in the afternoon."
"Les géants, voyants que tout leur camp était noyé, emportèrent leur roi Anarche à leur col, le mieux qu’ils purent, hors du fort[1], comme fit Enéas son père Anchises de la conflagration de Troie.

Donnez dessus à[2] votre mât, galantement à la vieille escrime, car c’est à cette heure qu’il se faut montrer homme de bien, et de notre côté, noua ne vous faudrons[3], et hardiment, que je vous en tuerai beaucoup.

Et puis ce gros paillard Eusthènes, qui est fort comme quatre bœufs, ne s’y épargnera. Prenez courage, choquez[5] à travers d’estoc et de taille. » Or, dit Pantagruel : « De courage, j’en ai pour plus de cinquante francs. Mais quoi ? Hercules n’osa jamais entreprendre contre deux.","The giants, seeing that their whole camp was drowned, carried their king Anarche to their collar, as best they could, out of the fort[1], as did Aeneas his father Anchises of the conflagration of Troy. Which when Panurge saw, said to Pantagruel: “Lord, see there the giants that have come out. Give it to[2] your mast, gallantly to the old fencing, because it is at this hour that you have to show yourself to be a good man, and on our side, we will not need you[3], and boldly, that I kill you a lot. Because what? David slew Goliath easily. So I, who would defeat twelve such as David was (because at that time it was only a small chiart [4]), would I not defeat a dozen? And then that fat bawdy Eusthenes, who is as strong as four oxen, will not spare himself. Take courage, shock[5] through thrust and size. Now, says Pantagruel: “I have courage for more than fifty francs. But what ? Hercules never dared to undertake against two.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","THE Giants, seeing all their Camp drowned, carried away their King Anarchus upon their backs, as well as they could, out of the Fort, as Æneas did to his father Anchises, in the time of the conflagration of Troy. When Panurge perceived them, he said to Pantagruel, Sir, yonder are the Giants coming forth against you, lay on them with your mast gallantly like an old Fencer: for now is the time that you must shew your self a brave man and an honest. And for our part we will not faile you; I my self will kill to you a good many boldly enough; for why, David killed Goliath very easily, and then this great lecher Eusthenes, who is stronger then foure oxen, will not spare himself. Be of good courage therefore, and valiant, charge amongst them with point and edge, and by all manner of meanes. Well (said Pantagruel,) of courage I have more then for fifty francks, but let us be wise, for Hercules first never undertook against two ; that is well cack’d , well scummered, (said Panurge) do you compare your self with Hercules?"
"– Comment, dirent-ils, nos sacres décrétales chantent qu’il n’y en a jamais qu’un vivant.","– How, they said, our sacred decretals sing that there is never but one alive.",they said. ‘Our holy Decretals intone that there is never more than one alive.’,"How! cry’d they, our Sacred Decretals inform us, that there never is more than one living."
"Là eussiez vu Pan sauteler avec ses jambes tortes[14] autour des Ménades, avec sa flûte rustique les exciter à vertueusement combattre. Là eussiez aussi vu en après un jeune Satyre mener prisonniers dix-sept rois, une Bacchide tirer avec ses serpents quarante et deux capitaines, un petit Faune porter douze enseignes prises sur les ennemis, et le bonhomme Bacchus sur son char se pourmener[15] en sûreté parmi le camp, se gaudissant[16] et buvant d’autant[17] à un chacun. Enfin était représente en figure emblématique le trophée de la victoire et le triomphe du bon Bacchus.","There you would have seen Pan leaping with his crooked legs [14] around the Maenads, with his rustic flute inciting them to fight virtuously. There you would also have seen afterwards a young Satyr leading seventeen kings prisoners, a Bacchis dragging with her snakes forty-two captains, a small Faun carrying twelve ensigns taken from the enemies, and the good man Bacchus on his chariot wandering[15] in safety among the camp, cheering[16] and drinking as much[17] to each one. Finally was represented as an emblematic figure the trophy of victory and the triumph of the good Bacchus.","There you would have seen Pan skipping around the Maenades on his crooked legs, encouraging them to fight valiantly with his rustic pipes. There you would have next seen: a young Satyr leading in seventeen kings as captives; a Bacchante hauling along forty-two captains with her snakes; a little faun bearing twelve standards seized from the enemy; and that good fellow Bacchus riding securely in his chariot in the midst of the field, laughing, joking and downing drink for drink with all comers. Finally there was portrayed in that mosaic the trophy celebrating the victory and triumph of that good fellow Bacchus.","There you might have seen Pan frisk it with his goatish Shanks about the Mœnades, and with his rustick Pipe excite them to behave themselves like Mœnades. A little further you might have blest your Eyes with the sight of a young Satyr, who led seventeen Kings his Prisoners, and a Bacchis, who, with her Snakes, hawl’d along no less than Two and forty Captains; a little Faun, who carried a whole dozen of Standards taken on the Enemy; and goodman Bacchus on his Chariot, riding to and fro fearless of Danger, making much of his dear Carkass, and cheerfully toping to all his merry Friends. Finally, we saw the Representation of his Triumph, which was thus; First, his Chariot was wholly lin’d with Ivy, gather’d on the Mountain Meros; this for its scarcity, which you know, raises the Price of every thing, and principally of those Leaves in India."
"Loupgarou donc s’adressa à Pantagruel avec une masse toute d’acier, pesante neuf mille sept cents quintaux deux quarterons d’acier de Chalybes[9], au bout de laquelle étaient treize pointes de diamants, dont la moindre était aussi grosse comme la plus grande cloche de Notre-Dame de Paris (il s’en fallait par aventure l’épaisseur d’un ongle, ou au plus, que je ne mente, d’un dos de ces couteaux qu’on appelle coupe-oreille, mais pour un petit, ni avant ni arrière), et était fée, en manière que jamais ne pouvait rompre, mais au contraire, tout ce qu’il en touchait rompait incontinent.","Loupgarou therefore addressed Pantagruel with a mass entirely of steel, weighing nine thousand seven hundred quintals, two quarterons of Chalybes steel[9], at the end of which were thirteen diamond points, the least of which was as large as the largest bell of Notre-Dame de Paris (it was by chance the thickness of a fingernail, or at most, that I am not lying, of a back of these knives which one calls ear-cutter, but for a small one, neither front nor back), and was fairy, in a way that never could break, but on the contrary, all that he touched with it broke immediately.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Loupgarou then set forward towards Pantagruel, with a mace all of steel, and that of the best sort, weighing nine thousand seven hundred kintals, and two quarterons, at the end whereof were thirteen pointed diamonds , the least whereof was as big as the greatest bell of our Ladies Church at Paris, there might want perhaps the thicknesse of a naile, or at most, that I may not lie, of the back of those knives which they call cut-lugs or eare-cutters, but for a little off or on, more or lesse, it is no matter, and it was inchanted in such sort, that it could never break, but contrarily all that it did touch, did break immediately."
"« Vous (pardonnez-moi si je méprends) me semblez évidemment errer, interprétant cornes pour cocuage. Diane les porte en tête à forme de beau croissant. Est-elle cocue pourtant ? Comment diable serait-elle cocue, qui ne fut onques mariée ? Parlez, de grâce, correct, craignant qu’elle vous en fasse au patron que fit à Actéon. Le bon Bacchus porte cornes, semblablement Pan, Jupiter Ammonien, tant d’autres. Sont-ils cocus ? Junon serait-elle putain ? Car il s’ensuivrait, par la figure dite metalepsis ! Comme, appelant un enfant, en présence de ses père et mère, champi ou avoistre[8], c’est honnêtement, tacitement dire le père cocu et sa femme ribaude. Parlons mieux. Les cornes que me faisait ma femme sont cornes d’abondance et planté de tous biens. Je le vous affie[9]. Au demeurant je serai joyeux comme un tambour à noces, toujours sonnant, toujours ronflant, toujours bourdonnant et pétant. Croyez que c’est l’heur[10] de mon bien. Ma femme sera coincte[11] et jolie, comme une belle petite chouette.","“You (forgive me if I misunderstand) obviously seem to me to be wandering, interpreting horns for cuckoldry. Diane wears them on her head in the form of a beautiful crescent. Is she cuckold yet? How the devil would she be a cuckold, who was never married? Speak, please, correct, lest she do you the patron that Actaeon did. The good Bacchus wears horns, like Pan, Jupiter Ammonian, so many others. Are they cuckolds? Could Juno be a whore? Because it would follow, by the figure called metalepsis! Like, calling a child, in the presence of his father and mother, champi or avostre[8], is honestly, tacitly saying the cuckolded father and his ribald wife. Let's talk better. The horns that my wife made for me are cornucopias and planted with all goods. I affiate it to you[9]. For the rest I will be joyful like a wedding drum, always ringing, always humming, always buzzing and farting. Believe that it is the hour[10] of my good. My wife will be tight[11] and pretty, like a pretty little owl.","‘You – do pardon me if I give any offence – seem evidently to err in interpreting horns as cuckoldom. – Diana wears horns on her head in the form of a handsome crescent: does that make her a cuckold! She’s never even been married! How the devil could she be a cuckold then? For goodness’ sake speak properly or she might give you horns of the kind she gave to Actaeon. – That good god Bacchus wears horns; so do Pan, Jupiter Ammon and many others. Are they all cuckolds then? Must Juno be a slut? – for that would follow by the figure of rhetoric called metalepsis, as calling a child a bastard or a foundling in the presence of its father and mother is a way of implying indirectly and implicitly that the father is a cuckold and the mother a slut. ‘Let us put it better. The horns which my wife was giving me are horns of plenty, horns of an abundance of all good things. I can assure you of that. In the meanwhile I shall be as merry as a tabor at a marriage-feast, ever rumbling, ever rolling, ever beating and farting. Believe you me, that is a presage of my good fortune: my wife will be neat and pretty like a lovely little owl:","You are in truth, Sir, as it seems to me (excuse my boldness if I have transgressed) in a most palpable and absurd Error, to attribute my Horns to Cuckoldry: Diana wears them on her Head after the manner of a Cressant, is she a Cucquean for that? How the Devil can she be cuckolded, who never yet was married? Speak somewhat more correctly, I beseech you, least she being offended, furnish you with a pair of Horns, shapen by the Pattern of those which she made for Actœon. The goodly Bacchus also carries Horns; Pan, Jupiter Hammon, with a great many others, are they all Cuckolds? If Jove be a Cuckold, Juno is a Whore: this follows by the Figure Metalepsis. As to call a Child in the presence of his Father and Mother, a Bastard, or Whore’s Son, is tacitly and under-board, no less than if he had said openly, the Father is a Cuckold, and his Wife a Punk. Let our Discourse come nearer to the purpose: The Horns that my Wife did make me are Horns of Abundance, planted and grafted in my Head for the increase and shooting up of all good things: this will I affirm for truth, upon my Word, and pawn my Faith and Credit both upon it; as for the rest, I will be no less joyful, frolick, glad, cheerful, merry, jolly, and gamesome than a well-bended Tabor in the Hands of a good Drummer, at a Nuptial Feast, still making a noise, still rowling, still buzzing and cracking. Believe me, Sir, in that consisteth none of my least good Fortunes. And my Wife will be jocund, feat, compt, neat, quaint, dainty, trim, trick’d up, brisk, smirk and smug, even as a pretty little Cornish Chough: who will not believe this, let Hell or the Gallows be the Burden of his Christmas Carol."
"– C’est or, dit Panurge ; je dis écus au soleil.","“It is gold,” said Panurge; I say shield to the sun.","‘Gold, that is,’ said Panurge. ‘Good Sun-crowns.’ ‘The Court,’ said Catty-claws, ‘so understands. Good Gold! hmm; Good Gold!","By Gold, ’tis Gold, quoth Panurge, good old Gold, I’ll assure you."
"Les cages étaient grandes, riches, somptueuses et faites par merveilleuse architecture. Les oiseaux étaient grands, beaux et polis à l’avenant, bien ressemblants les hommes de ma patrie, buvaient et mangeaient comme hommes, émutissaient[4] comme hommes, enduisaient[5] comme hommes, pétaient, donnaient et roussinaient[6] comme hommes. Bref, à les voir de prime face[7], eussiez dit que fussent hommes ; toutefois ne l’étaient mie[8], selon l’instruction de maître Æditue, mais protestant qu’ils n’étaient ni séculiers, ni mondains. Aussi leur pennage[9] nous mettait en rêverie, lequel aucuns[10] avaient tout blanc, autres tout noir, autres tout gris, autres mi-parti de blanc et noir, autres tout rouge, autres parti de blanc et bleu. C’était belle chose de les voir. Les mâles il nommait clergaux, monagaux, prêtregaux, abbégaux, évêgaux, cardingaux et papegaut, qui est unique en son espèce. Les femelles il nommait clergesses, monagesses, prêtregesses, abbegesses, évêgesses, cardingesses, papegesse. « Tout ainsi toutefois, nous dit-il, comme entre les abeilles hantent les frelons, qui rien ne font fors tout manger et tout gâter, aussi depuis trois cents ans, ne sais comment, entre ces joyeux oiseaux était par chacune quinte lune avolé[11] grand nombre de cagots, lesquels avaient honni et conchié toute l’île, tant hideux et monstrueux que de tous étaient refuis[12], car tous avaient le col tors, les pattes pelues, les griffes et ventre de harpies et les culs de stymphalides, et n’était possible les exterminer : pour un mort en avolait vingt-quatre. J’y souhaitais quelque second Hercules, pour ce que frère Jean y perdit le sens par véhémente contemplation, et à Pantagruel advint ce qu’était advenu à messire Priapus contemplant les sacrifices de Cérès, par faute de peau.","The cages were large, rich, sumptuous and made by marvelous architecture. The birds were tall, handsome and polite to match, much like the men of my country, drank and ate like men, moved[4] like men, smeared[5] like men, farted, gave and scorched[6] like men. In short, to see them face to face[7], you would have said that they were men; however they were not, according to the instruction of Master Aeditus, but protesting that they were neither secular nor worldly. Also their pennage[9] put us in reverie, which some[10] were all white, others all black, others all grey, others half white and black, others all red, others half white and blue. It was nice to see them. The males he named clergaux, monagaux, Prêtregaux, Abbégaux, Évêgaux, Cardinals and Papegaut, who is unique in his species. The females he named clergesses, monagesses, priestesses, abbesses, bishopesses, cardingesses, popess. ""All the same, however, he tells us, as among the bees haunt the hornets, which nothing can do but eat everything and spoil everything, so for three hundred years, I don't know how, between these merry birds was by each fifth moon flown away[ 11] great number of cagots, which had reviled and conchied the whole island, so hideous and monstrous that from all of them were refused [12], for all had crooked collars, hairy legs, claws and bellies of harpies and asses of stymphalidia, and it was not possible to exterminate them: for one death stole twenty-four. I wished there for a second Hercules, for what Brother John lost his senses there through vehement contemplation, and to Pantagruel happened what had happened to Sir Priapus contemplating the sacrifices of Ceres, for lack of skin.","The cages were grand, richly ornate, sumptuous and remarkably constructed. The birds were grand, handsome and becomingly sleek, closely resembling the men of my part of the world. They ate and drank like men, shat like men, broke wind, slept and leapt females like men. In short, on first seeing them, you would have said that they were in fact men, yet according to what Maître Aedituus taught us, they were not men at all, maintaining that they were, on the contrary, neither secular nor of this world. Their plumage moreover made us wonder: some had plumage which was wholly white; others, entirely black; others, all grey; others half white and half black; others, entirely red; others, half white, half blue. And what a fine sight it was to see them! The male birds they called Clerigoths, Monkogoths, Priestogoths, Abbégoths, Bishogoths, Cardingoths, plus a Popinjay, who is unique in his species. He called the female birds Clerickesses, Monkagesses, Priestagesses, Abbégesses, Bishogesses, Cardingesses and Popagesses. He told us, however, that, just as drones haunt bees yet do nothing but eat and spoil everything, so too, for the last three hundred years, on the fifth day after each full moon, a large number of Bigot-tails have somehow flown in amongst those happy birds, shamefully shitting all over their island. So hideous and monstrous are they that everyone has always shunned them, for they all have wry-necks, hairy paws and the claws and bellies of Harpies together with the bums of Stymphalian birds. It was impossible to exterminate them: for every one of them killed, two dozen fly in. I yearned for a second Hercules, since Frére Jean had sunk into such mind-distracting contemplation that he had lost touch with reality, while there befell Pantagruel what had befallen Messer Priapus when his skin ran out as he contemplated the sacrifices of Ceres.5 How there is but one Popinjay on Ringing Island","The Cages were spacious, costly, magnificent, and of admirable Architecture. The Birds were large, fine, and neat accordingly; looking as like the men in my Country, as one Pea do’s like another; for they eat and drank like men, muted like men, endued or digested like men, farted like men, but stunk like Devils, slept, bill’d and trod their Females like men, but somewhat oftener; in short, had you seen and examin’d ’em from Top to Toe, you would have laid your head to a Turnip, that they had been meer Men. However, they were nothing less, as Master Ædituus told us; assuring us at the same time, that they were neither Secular nor Layic; and truth is, the diversity of their Feathers and Plumes, did not a little puzzle us. Some of them were all over as white as Swans, others as black as Crows, many as grey as Owls, others black and white like Magpies, some all red like Red-birds, and others purple and white like some Pigeons. He call’d the Males, Clerghawks, Monkhawks, Priesthawks, Abbothawks, Bishhawks, Cardinhawks, and one Popehawk, who is a Species by himself. He call’d the Females, Clergkites, Nunkites, Priestkites, Abbesskites, Bishkites, Car-dinkites, and Popekites. However, said he, as Hornets and Drones, will get among the Bees, and there do nothing but buzz, eat and spoil everything; so, for these last Three hundred Years, a vast Swarm of Bigottello ’s flockt I don’t know how among these goodly Birds every fifth full Moon, and have bemuted, bewray’d, and conskited the whole Island. They are so hard-favoured and monstrous, that none can abide ’em. For their wry Necks make a figure like a crooked Billet; their Paws are hairy like those of rough-footed Pigeons; their Claws and Pounces, belly and breech like those of the Stymphalid Harpies. Nor is it possible to root them out; for if you get rid of one, strait four and twenty new ones fly thither. There had been need of another Monster-hunter, such as was Hercules, for Fryar Jhon had like to have run distracted about it, so much he was nettled and puzzled in the matter. As for the good Pantagruel, he was e’en serv’d as was Messer Priapus, contemplating the Sacrifices of Ceres, for want of Skin."
"« N’ayez peur que vin et vivres ici faillent, car quand le ciel serait d’airain et la terre de fer, encore vivres ne nous faudraient, fut-ce par sept, voire huit ans, plus longtemps que ne dura la famine en Égypte.

Let us drink together out of good accord in charity.","And never fear that food and drink might run out, for even if the sky be brass and the Earth be iron, still we would never be short of something to live on, not for seven years, nay for eight; longer than that famine in Egypt. Let us drink together, in harmony and charity.’",", I pray you, fear not we should ever want good Bub, and Belly-Timber; for, look here, though the Sky were of Brass, and the Earth of Iron, we should not want wherewithal to stuff the Gut, though they were to continue so Seven or Eight Years longer than the Famine in Egypt.

"Mon cas disais, par trop fûtes rebelle","My case was saying, too rebellious","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","For this one time, that I to you my love Discovered, you did too cruel prove"

Ha ! pour grâce, n’emburelucoquez[14] jamais vos esprits de ces vaines pensées, car je vous dis qu’à Dieu rien n’est impossible, et, s’il voulait, les femmes auraient dorénavant ainsi leurs enfants par l’oreille.","Is it against our law, our faith, against reason, against Holy Scripture?

"Au lendemain, cas pareil advint, pour ce qu’au sac et gibecière du maigre chicanous n’avait été trouvé son exploit. De par le gras prieur fut nouveau chicanous envoyé citer le seigneur de Basché, avec deux recors pour sa sûreté. Le portier, sonnant la campanelle, réjouit toute la famille, entendants que chicanous était là. Basché était à table, dînant avec sa femme et gentilshommes. Il mande quérir chicanous, le fit asseoir près de soi, les recors près les damoiselles, et dînèrent très bien et joyeusement. Sur le dessert, chicanous se lève’ de table, présents et oyants les recors, cite Basché. Basché gracieusement lui demande copie de sa commission. Elle était jà prête. Il prend acte de son exploit ; à chicanous et à ses recors furent quatre écus soleil donnés. Chacun s’était retiré pour la farce. Trudon commence sonner du tambourin. Basché prie chicanous assister aux fiançailles d’un sien officier et en recevoir le contrat, bien le payant et contentant. Chicanous fut courtois. Dégaina son écritoire, eut papier promptement, ses recors près de lui. Loyre entre en salle par une porte, sa femme avec les damoiselles par autre, en accoutrements nuptiaux. Oudart, revêtu sacerdotalement, les prend par les mains, les interroge de leurs vouloirs, leur donne sa bénédiction, sans épargne d’eau bénite. Le contrat est passé et minuté. D’un côté sont apportés vins et épices ; de l’autre, livrée à tas, blanc et tanné ; de l’autre sont produits gantelets secrètement.","The next day, such a case happened, for what the bag and game bag of the skinny chicanous had not been found his exploit. From the fat prior was again chicanou sent to cite the Lord of Basché, with two recors for his safety. The doorman, ringing the campanelle, rejoiced the whole family, hearing that Chicanous was there. Basché was at the table, dining with his wife and gentlemen. He asked for chicanous, made him sit near him, the recors near the damsels, and dined very well and happily. On the dessert, chicanous gets up from the table, present and hearing the recors, quotes Basché. Basché graciously asks him for a copy of his commission. She was ready. He takes note of his achievement; to chicanous and his recors were given four écus soleil. Everyone had retired for the joke. Trudon begins sounding the tambourine. Basché begs chicanous to attend the engagement of one of his officers and to receive the contract, paying him well and contenting him. Chicanous was courteous. Unsheathed his writing desk, got paper quickly, his records near him. Loyre enters the room by one door, his wife with the damsels by another, in nuptial attire. Oudart, clothed priestly, takes them by the hands, questions them about their wishes, gives them his blessing, without sparing holy water. The contract is made and timed. On one side are brought wines and spices; on the other, bundled up, white and tanned; on the other are secretly produced gauntlets.","‘The next day – because no writ had been found in the bag or pouch of that skinny Chicanous – a similar event occurred. ‘On behalf of the fat Prior a fresh Chicanous was despatched to serve a writ on the Seigneur de Basché. Two bailiffs came along to protect him. The gate-keeper tolled his bell, making all the household rejoice as they learned that Chicanous had arrived. ‘Basché was at table, dining with his wife and the noblemen. He sent for Chicanous and made him sit by him and the bailiffs to sit down next to the young ladies. And they dined very well and merrily together. ‘At dessert Chicanous rose from his seat at the table and, in the presence and hearing of the bailiffs, served the writ on Basché. Basché courteously asked him for a copy of his warrant. It was ready to hand. The writ was formally served and, once everyone had withdrawn for the farce, four sun-crowns were bestowed on Chicanous and the bailiffs. Trudon began to beat his drum. Basché prayed Chicanous to come to the marriage of one of his serving-men and to formalize the marriage-contract (with the fee duly and satisfactorily paid). ‘Chicanous was courteous. He unstrapped his writing-case and, with the bailiffs standing by, promptly produced paper. Loyre comes into Hall through one door, his wife and bridesmaids through another, all attired for a wedding. Oudart, sacer-dotally vested, takes them by the hand, asks whether They Will, gives them his blessing without stinting the holy water. The marriage-contract is signed and sealed. From one side is brought in wine and spices; from another, an abundance of white and brown ribbons; and from yet another gauntlets are secretly produced.","Bag, that he had serv’d his Writ. So the fat Prior sent a new Catchpole at the head of a brace of Bums for his Guard du Corps to Summon my Lord. The Porter ringing the Bell, the whole Family was overjoy’d, knowing that it was another Rogue. Basché was at Dinner with his Lady and the Gentlemen, so he sent for the Catchpole, made him sit by him, and the Bums by the Women, and made them eat till their Bellies crack’d with their Breeches unbutton’d. The Fruit being serv’d, the Catchpole arose from Table, and before the Bums cited Basché, Basché kindly ask’d him for a Copy of the Warant, which the other had got ready: he then takes Witness and a Copy of the Summons. To the Catchpole and his Bums he order’d four Ducats for Civility Money. In the mean time all were withdrawn for the Farce. So Trudon gave the Alarm with his Tabor. Basché desir’d the Catchpole to stay and see one of his Servants married, and witness the Contract of Marriage, paying him his Fee. The Catchpole slap dash was ready, took out his Ink-horn, got Paper immediately, and his Bums by him. Then Loire came into the Hall at one door, and his Wife with the Gentlewomen at another in Nuptial Accoutrements. Oudart, in Pontificalibus takes them both by the hands, asketh them their will; giveth them the Matrimonial Blessing, and was very Liberal of Holy Water. The Contract Written, Sign’d, and Register’d, on one side was brought Wine and Comfits; on the other, White and Orange-tauny-colour’d Favours were distributed; on another, Gantlets privately handed about."
"Et se gouverna si bien et prudentement monsieur le nouveau châtelain, qu’en moins de quatorze jours il dilapida le revenu certain et incertain de sa châtellenie pour trois ans. Non proprement dilapida, comme vous pourriez dire, en fondations de monastères, érections de temples, bâtiments de collèges et hôpitaux, ou jetant son lard aux chiens ; mais dépendit[6] en mille petits banquets et festins joyeux, ouverts à tous venants, mêmement à tous bons compagnons, jeunes fillettes et mignonnes galoises[7], abattant bois, brûlant les grosses souches pour la vente des cendres, prenant argent d’avance, achetant cher, vendant à bon marché et mangeant son blé en herbe.","And the new castellan governed himself so well and prudently that in less than fourteen days he squandered the certain and uncertain income of his castellanship for three years. Not properly squandered, as you might say, in founding monasteries, erecting temples, building colleges and hospitals, or throwing his bacon to the dogs; but depended[6] on a thousand little banquets and merry feasts, open to all comers, even to all good companions, young little girls and pretty Welsh[7], cutting down wood, burning the big stumps for the sale of the ashes, taking money from advance, buying dear, selling cheap, and eating his budding wheat.","Now my Lord the new Châtelain managed things so well and so wisely that in less than a fortnight he had dilapidated both the assured and unsure income for the next three years. He did not, as you might say, literally dilapidate it by founding monasteries, erecting chapels, building colleges and hospitals nor, indeed by casting his bacon to the dogs, but spent it rather on hundreds of little banquets and jolly parties open to all-comers, particularly to good fellows, young girlies and big cuddly women, chopping down his timber, burning their trunks to sell the cinders, borrowing in advance, buying dear and selling cheap, and eating his corn when ’twas but grass.","Now his Worship, the new Laird, husbanded this his Estate so providently well and prudently, that in less than fourteen days he wasted and dilapidated all the certain and uncertain Revenue of his Lairdship for three whole Years: Yet did not he properly dilapidate it, as you might say, in founding of Monasteries, building of Churches, erecting of Colleges, and setting up of Hospitals, or casting his Bacon-Flitches to the Dogs; but spent it in a thousand little Banquets and jolly Collations, keeping open House for all Comers and Goers; yea, to all good Fellows, young Girls, and pretty Wenches; felling Timber, burning the great Logs for the sale of the Ashes, borrowing Money before-hand, buying dear, selling cheap, and eating his Corn (as it were) whilst it was but Grass."
"– Ajoutez, dit-elle, le cube premier, ce sont huit ; au bout de ce nombre fatal trouverons la porte du temple. Et y notez prudemment que c’est la vraie psychogonie de Platon, tant célébrée par les Académiens, et tant peu entendue, de laquelle la moitié est composée d’unité des deux premiers nombres pleins, de deux quadrangulaires et de deux cubiques. »","“Add,” she said, “the first cube is eight; at the end of this fatal number we will find the door of the temple. And carefully note that it is Plato's true psychogony, so much celebrated by the Acadians, and so little understood, half of which is composed of the unity of the first two full numbers, two quadrangular and two cubic. »","‘To that, add the Prime Cube, which is eight. At the end of that number of destiny we shall find the door to the Temple. And there wisely note that is the true psychogony of Plato (so famous amongst the Academics, yet so little understood): the half of it is composed of unity, plus the first two simple numbers, plus their squares and their cubes.","Add, continued she, the first Cube, that’s eight; at the end of that fatal Number you’ll find the Temple-gate; and pray observe , this is the true Psychogony of Plato, so celebrated by the Academics, yet so little understood; one moiety of which consists of the unity, of the two first Numbers full, of two Square and two Cubic Numbers."
"Pantagruel, s’enquérant qui en était dominateur, entendit que c’était le roi Philophanes, lors absent pour le mariage de son frère Philothéamon avec l’infante du royaume d’Engys. Adonc descendit on[4] havre, contemplant, cependant que les chourmes[5] des nefs faisaient aiguade[6], divers tableaux, diverses tapisseries,, divers animaux, poissons, oiseaux et autres marchandises exotiques et pérégrines[7], qui étaient en l’allée du môle et par les halles du port, car c’était le tiers jour des grandes et solennes[8] foires du lieu, esquelles annuellement convenaient[9] tous les plus riches et fameux marchands d’Afrique et Asie. D’entre lesquelles frère Jean acheta deux rares et précieux tableaux, en l’un desquels était au vif peint le visage d’un appelant, en l’autre était le portrait d’un valet qui cherche maître, en toutes qualités requises, gestes, maintien, minois, allures, physionomie et affections[10], peint et inventé par maître Charles Charmois, peintre du roi Mégiste, et les paya en monnaie de singe.","Pantagruel, inquiring who was dominating it, heard that it was King Philophanes, then absent for the marriage of his brother Philotheamon with the Infanta of the kingdom of Engys. Then descended on[4] harbor, contemplating, while the chourmes[5] of the naves were watering[6], various paintings, various tapestries, various animals, fish, birds and other exotic and peregrine merchandise[7], which were in the alley of the mole and by the halls of the port, because it was the third day of the great and solemn [8] fairs of the place, which annually [9] all the richest and famous merchants of Africa and Asia were invited. Among which Brother Jean bought two rare and precious paintings, in one of which was vividly painted the face of a caller, in the other was the portrait of a valet who seeks master, in all required qualities, gestures , deportment, face, gaits, physiognomy and affections[10], painted and invented by Master Charles Charmois, painter to King Megiste, and paid for them in monkey money.","On Pantagruel’s asking who ruled over it, he heard that it was King Philomanes, then away for the marriage of his brother Philotheamon to the Infanta of the kingdom of Engys. He thereupon clambered down on to the harbour and, whilst the crews of the boats took on water, contemplated the great variety of pictures, tapestries, animals, fish, birds and other exotic foreign merchandise on sale in the street running along the harbour-breakwater and in the warehouses of the port, for it was the third day of the great local Festival with its fair which, every year, brought together all the richest and most famous merchants of Africa and Asia. From their wares Frère Jean bought two of the rare and precious pictures, in one of which was realistically painted the sad face of an appellant, and the other was the portrait of a valet seeking an employer and showing all the desired qualities, gestures, bearing, mien, carriage, expression and emotions. It was conceived and executed by Charles Charmois, painter to the Great King.11 Frère Jean paid for them with the coin of monkey-tricks.","Pantagruel, enquiring who Govern’d there, heard that it was King Philophanes, absent at that time upon account of the Marriage of his Brother Philotheamon with the Infanta of the Kingdom of Engys. Hearing this, he went ashoar in the Harbour, and while every Ship’s Crew Water’d, pass’d his time in viewing divers Animals, Fishes, Birds, and other exotic and foreign Merchandises which were along the Walks of the Mole, and in the Markets of the Port. For it was the third day of the great and famous Fair of the Place, to which the chief Merchants of Africa and Asia resorted. Out of these Fryar Jhon bought him two rare Pictures, in one of which, the Face of a Man that brings in an Appeal, was drawn to the Life, and in the other, a Servant that wants a Master, with every needful Particular, Action, Countenance, Looks, Gate, Feature and Deportment; being an Original, by Master Charles Charmois, principal Painter to King Megistus; and he paid for them in the Court Fashion, with Congé and Grimace."

"Or, messieurs, vous avez ouï un commencement de l’histoire horrifique de mon maître et seigneur Pantagruel. Ici, je ferai fin à ce premier livre ; la tête me fait un peu de mal, et sens bien que les registres de mon cerveau sont quelque peu brouillés de cette purée de septembre[1]. Vous aurez le reste de l’histoire à ces foires de Francfort prochainement venantes, et là vous verrez comment Panurge fut marié et cocu dès le premier mois de ses noces, et comment Pantagruel trouva la pierre philosophale, et la manière de la trouver et d’en user, et comment il passa les monts Caspies, comment il navigua par la mer Atlantique, et défit les Cannibales, et conquêta les îles de Perlas, comment il épousa la fille du roi d’Inde nommé Presthan[2], comment il combattit contre les diables, et fit brûler cinq chambres d’enfer, et mit à sac la grande chambre noire, et jeta Proserpine au feu, et rompit quatre dents à Lucifer, et une corne au cul, et comment il visita les régions de la lune pour savoir si, à la vérité, la lune n’était entière, mais que les femmes en avaient trois quartiers en la tête, et mille autres petites joyeusetés toutes véritables. Ce sont beaux textes d’évangile en français. Bonsoir, messieurs. Pardonnate mi, et ne pensez tant à mes fautes que ne pensez bien ès vôtres.","Now, gentlemen, you have heard a beginning of the horrific story of my master and lord Pantagruel. Here I will end this first book; my head hurts a little, and I feel that the registers of my brain are somewhat scrambled from this mashed potatoes from September[1]. You'll have the rest of the story at these forthcoming Frankfort fairs, and there you'll see how Panurge was married and cuckolded in the first month of his marriage, and how Pantagruel found the philosopher's stone, and how to find it and use it, and how he passed the Caspies, how he sailed by the Atlantic sea, and defeated the Cannibals, and conquered the islands of Perlas, how he married the daughter of the king of India named Presthan[2], how he fought against the devils, and burned five chambers of hell, and ransacked the great dark chamber, and threw Proserpina into the fire, and broke Lucifer's four teeth, and a horn in his ass, and how he visited the regions of the moon to find out if, in truth, the moon was not whole, but that women had three quarters of it in their heads, and a thousand other real little jokes. These are beautiful gospel texts in French. Good evening sirs. Forgive me, and don't think so much of my faults as of yours.","A celebrated maxim of Plato, cited by Cicero and so enjoying the support of the great Greek and of the great Roman, held that ‘We are not born for ourselves alone, but of our birth our country demands a part and our friends demand a part.’ Panurge can abuse even such a maxim, which Erasmus says is one of the most famous of all (Adages, IV, VI, LXXXI, ‘No one is born for himself’). The Roman sumptuary laws cited with approval by Pantagruel derive from Macrobius (Saturnalia, III, 17) supplemented by the commentary of Erasmus on another adage (I, IX, XLIV, ‘He did a Protervia’). The Thomas Aquinas of legend was said to have finished composing a hymn to Christ in his head just as he was also finishing a dish of lamprey. When, to allude to his hymn, he quoted aloud one of Christ’s last words on the Cross, ‘It is finished’, the shocked bystanders thought he was referring to his lamprey.","At Casa Nuova. At St. Bartolomee, in the County of Boulogne. At the Lorrette, and a thousand other places. And I wonder much at a rabble of foolish Philosophers and Physicians, who spend their time in disputing, whence the heat of the said waters cometh, whether it be by reason of Borax, or sulphur, or allum, or salt-peter that is within the mine; for they do nothing but dote, and better were it for them, to rub their arse against a thistle, then to waste away their time thus in disputing of that , whereof they know not the original; for the resolution is easie, neither need we to enquire any further, then that the said baths came by a hot pisse of the good Pantagruel. Now to tell you after what manner he was cured of his principal disease; I let passe how for a minorative, or gentle potion, he took foure hundred pound weight of Colophoniack Scammonee, six score and eighteen cartloads of Cassia: an eleven thousand and nine hundred pound weight of Rubarb, besides other confused jumblings of sundry drugs: You must understand, that by the advice of the Physicians it was ordained, that what did offend his stomach should be taken away; and therefore they made seventeen great balls of copper, each whereof was bigger then that which is to be seen on the top of St. Peters needle at Rome, and in such sort, that they did open in the midst, and shut with a spring. Into one of them entered one of his men, carrying a Lanterne and a torch lighted, and so Pantagruel swallowed him down like a little pill: into seven others went seven Countrey-fellows, having every one of them a shovel on his neck: into nine others entred nine wood-carriers, having each of them a basket hung at his neck, and so were they swallowed down like pills: when they were in his stomack, every one undid his spring, and came out of their cabins: the first whereof was he that carried the Lantern, and so they fell more than half a league into a most horrible gulph, more stinking and infectious than ever was Mephitis, or the marishes of Camerina, or the abominably unsavoury lake of Sorbona, whereof Strabo maketh mention. And had it not been, that they had very well antidoted their stomach, heart and winepot, which is called the noddle , they had been altogether suffocated and choaked with these detestable vapours. O what a perfume! O what an evaporation wherewith to bewray the mask or muflers of young mangie queans: after that with groping and smelling they came near to the fecal matter and the corrupted humours; finally, they found a montjoy or heap of ordure and filth: then fell the Pioneers to work to dig it up, and the rest with their shovels filled the baskets; and when all was cleansed, every one retired himself into his ball. This done, Pantagruel enforcing himself to a vomit, very easily brought them out, and they made no more shew in his mouth, than a fart in yours: but when they came merrily out of their pills, I thought upon the Grecians coming out of the Trojan horse: by this meanes was he healed, and brought unto his former state and convalescence; and of these brazen pilles, or rather copper-balls, you have one at Orleans, upon the steeple of the Holy Crosse Church. CHAPTER XXXIV The Conclusion of this present Book, and the excuse of the Author. Now (my masters) you have heard a beginning of the horrifick history of my Lord and Master Pantagruel: Here will I make an end of the first book: My head akes a little, and I perceive that the Registers of my braine are somewhat jumbled and disordered with this septembral juice. You shall have the rest of the history at Franckfort mart next coming, and there shall you see how Panurge was married and made a Cuckold within a moneth after his wedding: how Pantagruel found out the Philosophers stone, the manner how he found it, and the way how to use it: how he past over the Caspian mountaines, and how he sailed through the Atlantick sea, defeated the Cannibals, and conquered the isles of Perles, how he married the daughter of the King of India, called Prestian, how he fought against the devil, and burnt up five chambers of hell, ransacked the great black chamber, threw Proserpina into the fire, broke five teeth to Lucifer, and the horne that was in his arse. How he visited the regions of the Moon, to know whether indeed the Moon were not entire and whole, or if the women had three quarters of it in their heads, and a thousand other little merriments all veritable. These are brave things truly; Good night, Gentlemen, Perdonate mi, and think not so much upon my faults, that you forget your own. If you say to me, (Master) it would seem that you were not very wise in writing to us these flimflam stories, and pleasant fooleries: I answer you, that you are not much wiser to spend your time in reading them: neverthelesse , if you read them to make your selves merry, as in manner of pastime I wrote them, you and I both are farre more worthy of pardon, then a great rabble of squint-minded fellowes, dissembling and counterfeit Saints, demure lookers, hypocrites, pretended zealots, tough Fryars, buskin-Monks, and other such sects of men, who disguise themselves like Maskers to deceive the world, for, whilest they give the common people to understand, that they are busied about nothing but contemplation and devotion in fastings, and maceration of their sensuality; and that only to sustain and aliment the small frailty of their humanity: It is so far otherwise, that on the contrary (God knows) what cheer they make, Et Curios simulant, sed bacchanalia vivunt. You may read it in great letters, in the colouring of their red snowts, and gulching bellies as big as a tun, unlesse it be when they perfume themselves with sulphur; as for their study, it is wholly taken up in reading of Pantagruelin books, not so much to passe the time merrily, as to hurt some one or other mischievously, to wit, in articling, sole-articling, wry-neckifying, buttock-stirring, ballocking, and diabliculating, that is, culumniating; wherein they are like unto the poor rogues of a village, that are busie in stirring up and scraping in the ordure and filth of little children, in the season of cherries and guinds, and that only to find the kernels, that they may sell them to the druggists, to make thereof pomander-oile. Fly from these men, abhorre and hate them as much as I do, and upon my faith you will finde your selves the better for it. And if you desire to be good Pantagruelists (that is to say, to live in peace, joy, health, making your selves alwayes merry) never trust those men that alwayes peep out at one hole. The End of the Second Book of RABELAIS. THE THIRD BOOK OF THE WORKS OF MR. FRANCIS RABELAIS, DOCTOR IN PHYSICK CONTAINING THE HEROICK DEEDS OF PANTAGRUEL, THE SON OF GARGANTUA FRANCIS RABELAIS TO THE SOUL OF THE DECEASED QUEEN OF NAVARRE ABSTRACTED Soul, ravish’d with extasies, Gone back, and now familiar in the Skies. Thy former Host, thy Body, leaving quite, Which to obey thee always took delight; Obsequious, ready. Now from motion free, Senseless, and as it were, in Apathy. Wouldst thou not issue forth, for a short space, From that Divine, Eternal, Heavenly place, To see the third part, in this earthly Cell, Of the brave Acts of good Pantagruel. THE AUTHORS PROLOGUE GOOD People, most Illustrious Drinkers, and you thrice precious gouty Gentlemen. Did you ever see Diogenes the Cynick Philosopher, if you have seen him, you then had your Eyes in your Head, or I am very much out of my Understanding and Logical Sense. It is a gallant thing to see the clearness of (Wine, Gold) the Sun. I’ll be judged by the blind-born, so renowned in the Sacred Scriptures; who having at his choice to ask whatever he would from Him who is Almighty, and whose Word in an Instant is effectually performed, asked nothing else but that he might see. Item you are not young, which is a competent Quality for you to Philosophat more than Physically in Wine (not in vain) and henceforwards to be of the Bacchick Council; to the end that opining there, you may give your Opinion faithfully of the Substance, Colour, excellent Odour, Eminency, Propriety, Faculty, Vertue, and effectual Dignity of the said blessed and desired Liquor. If you have not seen him (as I am easily induced to believe that you have not) at least you have heard some talk of him. For through the Air, and the whole extent of this Hemisphere of the Heavens, hath his Report and Fame, even until this present time, remained very memorable and renowned. Then all of you are derived from the Phrygian Blood (if I be not deceived). If you have not so many Crowns as Midas had, yet have you something (I know not what) of him, which the Persians of old esteemed more of in all their Otacusts, and which was more desired by the Emperor Antonine; and gave occasion thereafter to the Basilisco at Rohan to be Surnamed Goodly ears. If you have not heard of him, I will presently tell you a Story to make your Wine relish: Drink then, so, to the purpose; hearken now whilst I give you notice (to the end that you may not, like Infidels be by your simplicity abused) that in his time he was a rare Philosopher, and the chearfullest of a thousand: If he had some Imperfection, so have you, so have we; for there is nothing (but God) that is perfect: Yet so it was, that by Alexander the Great (altho’ he had Aristotle for his Instructor and Domestick) was he held in such Estimation, that he wish’d, if he had not been Alexander, to have been Diogenes the Sinopian. When Philip King of Macedon enterprised the Siege and Ruine of Corinth, the Corinthians having received certain Intelligence by their Spies, that he with a numerous Army in Battle Rank was coming against them, were all of them (not without cause) most terribly afraid; and therefore were not neglective of their Duty, in doing their best Endeavours to put themselves in a fit posture to resist his Hostile Approach, and defend their own City. Some from the Fields brought into the Fortify’d Places their Movables, Bestial, Corn, Wine, Fruit, Victuals, and other necessary Provision. Others did fortifie and rampire their Walls, set up little Fortresses, Bastions, squared Ravelins, digged Trenches, cleansed Countermines, fenced themselves with Gabions, contrived Platforms, emptied Casemates, barricado’d the false Brayes, erected the Cavalliers, repaired the Contrescarfes, plaister’d the Courtines, lengthned Ravelins, stopt Parapets, mortaised Barbacans, assured the Port-culleys, fasten’d the Herses, Sarasinesks and Cata-racks, placed their Centries, and doubled their Patrouille. Every one did watch and ward, and not one was exempted from carrying the Basket. Some polish’d Corselets, varnish’d Backs and Breasts, clean’d the Head-pices, Mail-Coats, Brigandins, Salads, Helmets, Murrions, Jacks, Gushets, Gorgets, Hoguines, Brassars and Cuissars, Corseletts, Haubergeons, Shields, Bucklers, Targuets, Greves, Gantlets and Spurs. Others made ready Bows, Slings, Cross-bows, Pellets, Catapults, Migrames or Fire-balls, Firebrands, Balists, Scorpions, and other such Warlike Engines expugnatorie, and destructive to the Hellepolists. They sharpned and prepared Spears, Staves, Pikes, Brown Bills, Halberts, Long Hooks, Lances, Zagages, Quarterstaves, Eelspears, Partisans, Troutstaves, Clubs, Battle-axes, Maces, Darts, Dartlets, Glaves, Javelins, Javelots, and Trunchions. They set Edges upon Cimeters, Cutlasses, Badelans, Backswords, Tucks, Rapiers, Bayonets, Arrow-heads, Dags, Daggers, Mandousians, Poigniards, Whinyards, Knives, Skenes, Sables, Chipping Knives, and Raillons. Every Man exercis’d his Weapon, every Man scowr’d off the Rust from his natural Hanger: Nor was there a Woman amongst them (tho’ never so reserv’d or old) who made not her Harnish to be well furbish’d; as you know the Corinthian Women of old were reputed very couragious Combatants. Diogenes seeing them all so warm at work, and himself not employed by the Magistrates in any business whatsoever, he did very seriously (for many days together, without speaking one Word) consider, and contemplate the Countenance of his Fellow-Citizens. Then on a sudden, as if he had been roused up and inspired by a Martial Spirit, he girded his Cloak, scarf-ways, about his Left Arm, tucked up his Sleeves to the Elbow, trussed himself like a Clown gathering Apples, and giving to one of his old Acquaintance his Wallet, Books, and Opistographs, away went he out of Town towards a little Hill or Promontory of Corinth called Cranie; and there on the Strand, a pretty level place, did he roul his Jolly Tub, which serv’d him for an House to shelter him from the Injuries of the Weather: There, I say, in a great Vehemency of Spirit, did he turn it, veer it, wheel it, whirl it, frisk it, jumble it, shuffle it, huddle it, tumble it, hurry it, joult it, justle it, overthrow it, evert it, invert it, subvert it, overturn it, beat it, thwack it, bump it, batter it, knock it, thrust it, push it, jerk it, shock it, shake it, toss it, throw it, overthrow it up-side down, topsiturvy, arsiturvy, tread it, trample it, stamp it, tap it, ting it, ring it, tingle it, towl it, sound it, resound it, stop it, shut it, unbung it, close it, unstopple it. And then again in a mighty bustle he bandy’d it, slubber’d it, hack’d it, whitled it, way’d it, darted it, hurled it, stagger’d it, reel’d it, swindg’d it, brangled it, totter’d it, lifted it, heav’d it, transformed it, transfigur’d it, transpos’d it, transplaced it, reared it, raised it, hoised it, washed it, dighted it, cleansed it, rinsed it, nailed it, setled it, fastned it, shackled it, fetter’d it, level’d it, block’d it, tugg’d it, tew’d it, carry’d it, bedash’d it, beray’d it, parch’d it, mounted it, broach’d it, nick’d it, notch’d it, bespatter’d it, deck’d it, adorn’d it, trimmed it, garnished it, gaged it, furnish’d it, boar’d it, pierc’d it, trap’d it, rumbled it, slid it down the Hill, and precipitated it from the very height of the Cranie; then from the foot to the top (like another Sisyphus with his Stone) bore it up again, and every way so bang’d it and belabour’d it, that it was ten thousand to one he had not struck the bottom of it out. Which when one of his Friends had seen, and asked him why he did so toil his Body, perplex his Spirit, and torment his Tub? The Philosopher’s Answer was, That not being employed in any other Charge by the Republick, he thought it expedient to thunder and storm it so tempestuously upon his Tub, that amongst a People so fervently busie, and earnest at work, he alone might not seem a loytering Slug and lasie Fellow. To the same Purpose may I say of my self, Tho’ I be rid from Fear, I am not void of Care. For perceiving no Account to be made of me towards the Discharge of a Trust of any great Concernment, and considering that through all the parts of this most noble Kingdom of France, both on this and the other side of the Mountains, every one is most diligently exercised and busied; some in the fortifying of their own Native Country, for its Defence; others, in the repulsing of their Enemies by an Offensive War; and all this with a Policy so excellent, and such admirable Order, so manifestly profitable for the future, whereby France shall have its Frontiers most magnifically enlarged, and the Frenches assured of a long and well-grounded Peace, that very little withholds me from the Opinion of good Heraclitus, which affirmeth War to be the Father of all good things; and therefore do I believe that War is in Latin called Bellum, not by Antiphrasis, as some Patchers of old rusty Latin would have us to think; because in War there is little Beauty to be seen, but absolutely and simply; for that in War appeareth all that is good and graceful, and that by the Wars is purged out all manner of Wickedness and Deformity. For Proof whereof, the wise and pacifick Solomon could no better represent the unspeakable Perfection of the Divine Wisdom, than by comparing it to the due Disposure and Ranking of an Army in Battle Array, well provided and ordered. Therefore by reason of my Weakness and Inability, being reputed by my Compatriots unfit for the Offensive part of Warfare; and on the other side, being no way employed in matter of the Defensive, although it had been but to carry Burthens, fill Ditches, or break Clods, either whereof had been to me indifferent, I held it not a little disgraceful to be only an Idle Spectator of so many valorous, eloquent and warlike Persons, who in the view and sight of all Europe act this notable Interlude or Tragicomedy, and not make some Effort towards the Performance of this, nothing at all remains for me to be done. In my Opinion, little Honour is due to such as are meer Lookers on, liberal of their Eyes, and of their Purse parsimonious; who conceal their Crowns, and hide their Silver, scratching their Head with one Finger like grumbling Puppies, gaping at the Flies like Tithe Calves; clapping down their Ears like Arcadian Asses at the Melody of Musicians, who with their very Countenances in the depth of silence express their Consent to the Prosopopeie. Having made this Choice and Election, it seem’d to me that my Exercise therein would be neither unprofitable nor troublesom to any, whilst I should thus set a-going my Diogenical Tub, which is all that is left me safe from the Shipwrack of my former Misfortunes. At this dingle dangle wagging of my Tub, what would you have me to do? By the Virgin that tucks up her Sleeve, I know not as yet : Stay a little till I suck up a Draught of this Bottle; it is my true and only Helicon; it is my Caballine Fountain; it is my sole Entousiasm. Drinking thus I meditate, discourse, resolve and conclude. After that the Epilogue is made, I laugh, I write, I compose, and drink again. Ennius drinking wrote, and writing, drank. Æschylus (if Plutarch in his Symposiaes merit any Faith) drank composing, and drinking, composed. Homer never wrote fasting, and Cato never wrote till after he had drunk. These Passages I have brought before you, to the end you may not say that I live without the Example of Men well praised, and better prised. It is good and fresh enough, even (as if you would say) it is entring upon the Second Degree. God, the good God Sabaoth (that is to say, the God of Armies) be praised for it eternally. If you after the same manner would take one great Draught, or two little ones, whilst you have your Gown about you, I truly find no kind of Inconveniency in it, provided you send up to God for all some small scantling of Thanks. Since then my Luck or Destiny is such as you have heard, for it is not for every body to go to Corinth, I am fully resolved to be so little idle and unprofitable, that I will set my self to serve the one and the other sort of People, amongst the Diggers, Pioniers, and Rampire-builders, I will do as did Neptune and Apollo at Troy under Laomedon, or as did Renault of Mountauban in his latter days: I will serve the Masons, I’ll set on the Pot to boyl for the Bricklayers; and whilst the minced Meat is making ready at the sound of my small Pipe, I’ll measure the muzzle of the musing Dotards. Thus did Amphion, with the Melody of his Harp, found, build, and finish the great and renowned City of Thebes. For the Use of the Warriours I am about to broach off new my Barrel to give them a taste, (which by two former Volumes of mine, if by the deceitfulness and falshood of Printers they had not been jumbled, marred and spoiled, you would have very well relished) and draw unto them of the growth of our own trippery Pastimes, a gallant third-part of a Gallon, and consequently a jolly chearful Quart of Pantagruelick Sentences, which you may lawfully call (if you please) Diogenical; and shall have me (seeing I cannot be their Fellow-Soldier) for their faithful Butler, refreshing and cheering, according to my little power, their return from the Alarms of the Enemy; as also, for an indefatigable Extoller of their Martial Exploits and Glorious Atchievements. I shall not fail therein par lapathium acutum de dieu, if Mars fail not in Lent, which the cunning Lecher (I warrant you) will be loth to do. I remember nevertheless to have read, that Ptolemee the Son of Lagus one day, among the many Spoils and Booties, which by his Victories he had acquired, presenting to the Egyptians, in the open view of the People, a Bactrian Camel all black, and a party-colour’d Slave, in such sort, as that the one half of his Body was black, and the other white, not in partition of breadth by the Diaphragma, as was that Woman consecrated to the Indian Venus, whom the Tyanean Philosopher did see between the River Hydaspes, and Mount Caucasus, but in a perpendicular Dimension of Altitude; which were things never before that seen in Egypt. He expected by the show of these Novelties, to win the Love of the People. But what hapned thereupon? At the production of the Camel they were all affrighted, and offended at the sight of the party-coloured Man: Some scoffed at him, as a detestible Monster brought forth by the Errour of Nature. In a word, of the hope which he had to please these Egyptians, and by such means to encrease the Affection which they naturally bore him, he was altogether frustrate and disappointed; understanding fully by their Deportments, that they took more pleasure and delight in things that were proper, handsom and perfect, than in mishapen, monstrous and ridiculous Creatures; since which time he had both the Slave and the Camel in such dislike, that very shortly thereafter, either through Negligence, or for want of ordinary Sustenance, they did exchange their Life with Death. This Example, My Cake will be Dough, and for my Venus I shall have but some deformed Puppy, putteth me in a suspence between hope and fear, misdoubting that for the Contentment which I aim at , I will but reap what shall be most distastful to me; instead of serving them, I shall but vex them, and offend them whom I purpose to exhilirate; resembling in this dubious adventure Euclion’s Cock, so renowned by Plautus in his Pot; and by Ausonius in his Griphon, and by divers others; which Cock, for having by his scraping discover’d a Treasure, had his Hide well curry’d. Put the case I get no Anger by it, though formerly such things fell out, and the like may occur again: Yet, by Hercules, it will not. So I perceive in them all one, and the same specifical Form, and the like individual Proprieties, which our Ancestors call’d Pantagruelism; by vertue whereof, they will bear with any thing that floweth from a good, free, and loyal Heart. I have seen them ordinarily take good will in part of payment, and remain satisfied therewith, when one was not able to do better. Having dispatched this point, I return to my Barrel. Up my Lads, to this Wine spare it not; drink, Boys, and trowl it off at full Bowls; If you do not think it good, let it alone. I am not like those officious and importunate Sots, who by Force, Outrage and Violence constrain an easie good-natur’d Fellow to whiffle, quaff, carouse, and what is worse. All honest Tiplers, all honest gouty Men, all such as are a-dry, coming to this little Barrel of mine, need not drink thereof, if it please them not: But if they have a mind to it, and that the Wine prove agreeable to the Tastes of their worshipful Worships, let them drink frankly, freely and boldly, without paying any thing, and welcome. This is my Decree, my Statute and Ordinance; And let none fear there shall be any want of Wine as at the Marriage of Cana in Galilee; for how much soever you shall draw forth at the Faucet, so much shall I tun in at the Bung. Thus shall the Barrel remain inexhaustible; it hath a lively Spring, and perpetual Current. Such was the Beverage contained within the Cup of Tantalus, which was figuratively represented amongst the Bracman Sages. Such was in Iberia the Mountain of Salt, so highly written of by Cato. Such was the Branch of Gold consecrated to the subterranean Goddess, which Virgil treats of so sublimely. It is a true Cornu-copia of Merriment and Railery. If at any time it seem to you to be emptied to the very Lees, yet shall it not, for all that, be drawn wholly dry: good Hope remains there at the bottom, as in Pandora’s Bottle; and not despair, as in the Punction of the Danaids. Remark well what I have said, and what manner of People they be whom I do invite; for to the end that none be deceived, I (in imitation of Lucilius, who did protest that he wrote only to his own Tarentias and Consentius) have not pierced this Vessel for any else, but you honest Men, who are Drinkers of the First Edition, and gouty Blades of the highest degree. The great Dorophages, Bribe-mongers, have (on their hands) Occupation enough, and enough on the hooks, for their Venison. There may they follow their Prey; here is no Garbage for them. You Pettifoggers, Garbellers, and Masters of Chicanery, speak not to me, I beseech you, in the name of, and for the Reverence you bear to the Four Hips that ingendred you, and to the Quickning Peg which at that time conjoined them. As for Hypocrites, much less; although they were all of them unsound in Body, pockify’d, scurfie, furnish’d with unquenchable Thirst, and insatiable Eating; because indeed they are not of good, but of evil, and of that evil from which we daily pray to God to deliver us. And albeit we see them sometimes counterfeit Devotion, yet never did Old Age make pretty Moppet. Hence Mastiffs, Dogs in a Doublet; get you behind, aloof Villains, out of my Sunshine; Curs, to the Devil. Do you jog hither, wagging your Tails, to pant at my Wine, and bepiss my Barrel? Look here is the Cudgel, which Diogines, in his last Will, ordained to be set by him after his Death, for beating away, crushing the Reins, and breaking the Backs of these Bustuary Hobgoblins, and Cerbenan Hellhounds. Pack you hence therefore, you Hypocrites, to your Sheepdogs, Get you gone, you Dissemblers to the Devil. Hay! What, are you there yet? I renounce my part of Papimanie if I snatch you, Grr, Grrr, Grrrrrr. Avant, Avant, will you not be gone? May you never shit till you be soundly lash’d with Stirrup-Leather, never piss but by the Strapado, nor be otherways warmed, than by the Bastinado. THE THIRD BOOK CHAPTER I How Pantagruel transported a Colony of Utopians into Dypsodie. PANTAGRUEL having wholly subdued the Land of Dypsodie, transported thereunto a Colony of Utopians, to the number of 9876543210 Men, besides the Women and little Children, Artificers of all Trades, and Professors of all Sciences; to people, cultivate and improve that Country, which otherways was ill inhabited, and in the greatest part thereof but a meer Desert and Wilderness; and did transport them not so much for the excessive multitude of Men and Women which were in Utopia multiplied (for number) like Grashoppers upon the face of the Land. You understand well enough, nor is it needful further to explain it to you, that the Utopian Men had so rank and fruitful Genetories, and that the Utopian Women carried Matrixes so ample, so glutonous, so tenaciously retentive, and so Architectonically cellulated, that at the end of every Ninth Month, Seven Children at the least (what Male what Female) were brought forth by every married Woman, in imitation of the People of Israel in Egypt, if Anthony de Lira be to be trusted. Nor yet was this Transplantation made so much for the Fertility of the Soil, the Wholesomness of the Air, or Commodity of the Country of Dypsodie, as to retain that Rebellious People within the Bounds of their Duty and Obedience, by this new Transport of his ancient and most faithful Subjects, who from all time out of mind, never knew, acknowledged, owned or served any other Sovereign Lord but him; and who likewise from the very instant of their Birth, as soon as they were entred into this World, had, with the Milk of their Mothers and Nurses, sucked in the Sweetness, Humanity and Mildness of his Government, to which they were all of them so nourished and habituated, that there was nothing surer, than that they would sooner abandon their Lives, than swerve from this singular and primitive Obedience naturally due to their Prince, whithersoever they should be dispersed or removed. And not only should they, and their Children successively descending from their Blood, be such, but also would keep and maintain in this same Fealty, and obsequious Observance, all the Nations lately annexed to his Empire; which so truly came to pass, that therein he was not disappointed of his intent. For if the Utopians were before their Transplantation thither dutiful and faithful Subjects, the Dypsodes, after some few days conversing with them, were every whit as (if not more) loyal than they; and that by vertue of I know not what natural Fervency incident to all Humane Creatures at the beginning of any labour wherein they took delight; solemnly attesting the Heavens, and Supreme Intelligences, of their being only sorry, that no sooner unto their knowledge had arrived the great Renown of the good Pantagruel. Remark therefore here (honest Drinkers) that the manner of preserving and retaining Countries newly Conquered in Obedience, is not (as hath been the Erronieous Opinion of some Tyrannical Spirits to their own Detriment and Dishonour) to pillage, plunder, force, spoil, trouble, oppress, vex, disquiet, ruine and destroy the People, ruling, governing, and keeping them in awe with Rods of Iron; and (in a word) eating and devouring them, after the fashion that Homer calls an unjust and wicked King, δημόβορον, that is to say, a Devourer of his People. I will not bring you to this purpose the Testimony of Ancient Writers; it shall suffice to put you in mind of what your Fathers have seen thereof, and your selves too, if you be not very Babes. New-born, they must be given suck to, rocked in a Cradle, and dandled. Trees newly planted must be supported, underpropped, strengthned and defended against all Tempests, Mischiefs, Injuries and Calamities. And one lately saved from a long and dangerous Sickness, and new upon his Recovery, must be forborn, spared and cherished, in such sort, that they may harbour in their own Breasts this Opinion, That there is not in the World a King or a Prince, who does not desire fewer Enemies, and more Friends. Thus Osiris the great King of the Egyptians, conquered almost the whole Earth, not so much by Force of Arms, as by easing the People of their Troubles, teaching them how to live well and honestly giving them good Laws, and using them with all possible Affability, Courtesy, Gentleness and Liberality: Therefore was he by all Men deservedly Entituled, The Great King Evergetes (that is to say Benefactor), which style he obtained by vertue of the Command of Jupiter to Pamyla. And in effect, Hesiod, in his Hierarchy, placed the good Demons (call them Angels if you will, or Geniuses) as Intercessors and Mediators betwixt the Gods and Men, they being of a degree inferiour to the Gods, but superiour to Men; and for that through their Hands the Riches and Benefits we get from Heaven are dealt to us; and that they are continually doing us good, and still protecting us from evil, he saith, that they exercise the Offices of Kings; because to do always good and never ill, is an Act most singularly Royal. Just such another was the Emperor of the Universe, Alexander the Macedonian. After this manner was Hercules Sovereign Possessor of the whole Continent, relieving Men from monstrous Oppressions, Exactions and Tyrannies; governing them with Discretion, maintaining them in Equity and Justice, instructing them with seasonable Policies and wholsom Laws, convenient for, and suitable to the Soil, Climate and Disposition of the Country, supplying where was wanting, abating what was superfluous, and pardoning all that was past, with a sempiternal forgetfulness of all preceding Offences, as was the Amnestie of the Athenians, when by the Prowess, Valour and Industry of Thrasybulus the Tyrants were exterminated; afterwards at Rome by Cicero exposed, and renewed under the Emperor Aurelian. These are the Philtres, Allurements, Jynges, Inveiglements, Baits and Enticements of Love, by the means whereof that may be peaceably revived, which was painfully acquired. Nor can a Conqueror reign more happily, whether he be a Monarch, Emperor, King, Prince or Philosopher, than by making his Justice to second his Valour. His Valour shows it self in Victory and Conquest; his Justice will appear in the good Will and Affection of the People, when he maketh Laws, publisheth Ordinances, establisheth Religion, and doth what is right to every one, as the noble Poet Virgil writes of Octavian Augustus. Victorque volentes Per populos dat jura. Therefore it is that Homer, in his Iliads calleth a good Prince and great King, κοσμήτορα αων, that is, The Ornament of the People. Such was the Consideration of Numa Pompilius the Second King of the Romans, a just Politician and wise Philosopher, when he ordained that to God Terminus, on the Day of his Festival called Terminales, nothing should be sacrificed that had died; teaching us thereby, that the Bounds, Limits and Frontiers of Kingdoms should be guarded, and preserved in Peace, Amity and Meekness, without polluting our Hands with Blood and Robbery: Who doth otherways, shall not only lose what he hath gained, but also be loaded with this Scandal and Reproach, That he is an unjust and wicked Purchaser, and his Acquests perish with him, Juxta illud, male parta, male dilabuntur."
"– Mais, dit-il, à propos, il est bien à votre commandement, corps et biens, tripes et boyaux. »","""But,"" he said, by the way, ""he is at your command, body and goods, guts and guts."" »","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","But (said he) to the purpose, I am at your commandment, body and goods, tripes and bowels."

"Ici commença Homenas roter, péter, rire, baver et suer, et bailla son gros gras bonnet à quatre braguettes à une des filles, laquelle le posa sur son beau chef[24] en grande allégresse, après l’avoir amoureusement baisé, comme gage et assurance qu’elle serait première mariée. « Vivat ! s’écria Épistémon, vivat, fifat, pipat, bibat ! O secret apocalyptique !","Here began Homenas burping, farting, laughing, drooling and sweating, and yawned his big fat four-fly cap to one of the girls, who placed it on her handsome head [24] in great joy, after having lovingly kissed it, as a pledge and assurance that she would be the first bride. “Long live! exclaimed Epistemon, ""vivat, fifat, pipat, bibat!""

"« Davantage[17] Antiphanes disait la doctrine de Platon ès paroles être semblable, lesquelles en quelque contrée, on[18] temps du fort hiver, lorsque sont proférées, gèlent et glacent à la froideur de l’air et ne sont ouïes, semblablement ce que Platon enseignait ès jeunes enfants à peine être d’iceux entendu lorsque étaient vieux devenus. Or serait à philosopher et rechercher si forte[19] fortune ici serait l’endroit onquel telles paroles dégèlent. Nous serions bien ébahis si c’étaient les tête et lyre d’Orpheus. Car après que les femmes thréisses[20] eurent Orpheus mis en pièces, elles jetèrent sa tête et sa lyre dans le fleuve Hébrus. Icelles par ce fleuve descendirent en la mer Pontique jusques en l’île de Lesbos, toujours ensemble sur mer naguantes, et de la tête continuellement sortait un chant lugubre, comme lamentant la mort d’Orpheus : la lyre, à l’impulsion des vents mouvants les cordes, accordait harmonieusement avec le chant. Regardons si les verrons ci autour. »","""More [17] Antiphanes said the doctrine of Plato in words to be similar, which in some country, one [18] time of strong winter, when are uttered, freeze and freeze in the coldness of the air and are not heard, similarly what Plato taught to young children was scarcely understood by them when they were old. Now would be to philosophize and seek so strong [19] fortune here would be the place where such words thaw. We would be amazed if these were the head and lyre of Orpheus. For after the threese women[20] had cut Orpheus to pieces, they cast his head and his lyre into the river Hebrews. Icelles by this river descended into the Pontic Sea as far as the island of Lesbos, always together on the swirling seas, and from their heads continually issued a mournful song, as if lamenting the death of Orpheus: the lyre, at the impulse of the winds moving the strings, harmonized harmoniously with the singing. Let's see if we'll see them around. »","‘I also remember that Aristotle maintained that the Words of Homer are fluttering, flying, moving things and consequently animate. ‘Moreover, Antiphanes said that the teachings of Plato were like those Words which (being uttered in a certain land in the depths of winter, and freezing and congealing from the coldness of the air) are not heard: so too what Plato taught to young boys was hardly understood by them as old men.66 ‘It is up to us to make a philosophical inquiry into whether this might perhaps be the very place where such Words unfreeze. And what a surprise if it were the head and the lyre of Orpheus: for, after the Thracian women had ripped Orpheus to pieces, they hurled his head and his lyre into the river Hebrus, which swept them down into the Black Sea as far as the isle of Lesbos, ever floating together upon the waters. And from that head there continually poured forth a mournful song seemingly lamenting the death of Orpheus, whilst, with that song, strokes from the winding winds made the chords accord.67 ‘Let us keep a lookout in case we see them hereabouts.’ How amongst the frozen Words Pantagruel came across words both of gullet and gules","Besides, Antiphanes said, that Plato’s Philosophy was like words which being spoken in some Country during a hard Winter are immediately congeal’d, frozen up and not heard; for what Plato taught young Lads, could hardly be understood by them, when they were grown Old: Now, continu’d he, we should Philosophise and Search whether this be not the place where those words are thaw’d. You’d wonder very much, should this be the Head and Lyre of Orpheus. When the Thracian Women had torn him to Pieces, they threw his Head and Lyre into the River Hebrus; down which they floated to the Euxine Sea, as far as the Island of Lesbos, the Head continually uttering a doleful Song, as it were, lamenting the Death of Orpheus, and the Lyre with the Wind’s impulse, moving its strings, and Harmoniously Accompanying the Voice. Let’s see if we cannot discover them hereabouts."
"Ce nonobstant dit Grandgousier : « Puisqu’il n’est question que de quelques fouaces, j’essaierai de le contenter, car il me déplaît par trop de lever guerre. » Adonc s’enquêta combien on avait pris de fouaces, et entendant quatre ou cinq douzaines, commanda qu’on en fît cinq charretées en icelle nuit, et que l’une fut de fouaces faites à beau beurre, beaux moyeux[4] d’œufs, beau safran et belles épices, pour être distribuées à Marquet, et que, pour ses intérêts[5], il lui donnait sept cents mille et trois philippus pour payer les barbiers qui l’auraient pansé, et d’abondant[6] lui donnait la métairie de la Pomardière, à perpétuité franche pour lui et les siens.","This notwithstanding said Grandgousier: “Since it is only a question of a few cakes, I will try to satisfy him, because I dislike too much to raise war. So he inquired how many cakes they had taken, and hearing four or five dozen, ordered five cartloads to be made that night, and that one was cakes made with fine butter, fine hubs. eggs, fine saffron and fine spices, to be distributed to Marquet, and that, for his interests[5], he gave him seven hundred thousand and three philippus to pay the barbers who would have groomed him, and abundant[6 ] gave him the smallholding of La Pomardière, in perpetuity free for him and his family.","It seemed to Grandgousier’s entire Council that he should defend himself by main force. Despite which, he said, ‘Since it is but a matter of a few fouaces, I shall try to satisfy him, as I am extremely reluctant to go to war.’ And so he inquired how many fouaces had been taken and, on learning that it was four or five dozen, commanded that five cart-loads should be baked that very night, one load of which was to be made from the best butter, the best egg-yokes, the best saffron and the best spices and set apart for Marquet, to whom, for the hurt he had suffered, he would give seven hundred thousand [and three] Philippus-crowns to pay the barber-surgeons who had treated him; and, on top of that, he would further grant him the farm of La Pomardière, free for him and his heirs for ever.","Notwithstanding all this (said Grangousier,) seeing the question is but about a few cakes, I will labour to content him; for I am very unwilling to wage warre against him. He enquired then what quantity of cakes they had taken away, and understanding that it was but some foure or five dozen, he commanded five cartloads of them to be baked that same night: and that there should be one full of cakes made with fine butter, fine yolks of egges, fine saffron and fine spice, to be bestowed upon Marquet, unto whom likewise he directed to be given seven hundred thousand and three Philips, (that is, at three shillings the piece, one hundred five thousand pounds and nine shillings of English money) for reparation of his losses and hinderances, and for satisfaction of the Chirurgion that had dressed his wound: and furthermore setled upon him and his for ever in freehold the Apple-Orchard called La Pomardiere; for the conveyance and passing of all which was sent Gallet, who by the way as they went made them gather near the willow-trees great store of boughs, canes and reeds, wherewith all the Cariers were injoyned to garnish and deck their carts, and each of them to carry one in his hand, as himself likewise did, thereby to give all men to understand that they demanded but Peace, and that they came to buy it."

"En la cour de ce grand maître ingénieux, Pantagruel aperçut deux manières de gens appariteurs, importuns et par trop officieux, lesquels il eut en grande abomination. Les uns étaient nommés Engastrimythes, les autres Gastrolâtres. Les Engastrimythes soi-disaient être descendus de l’antique race d’Eurycles et sur ce alléguaient le témoignage d’Aristophanes en la comédie intitulée les Taons ou Mouches-guêpes, dont anciennement étaient dits Eurycliens, comme écrit Platon et Plutarque on[4] livre de la Cessation des oracles. Ès saints décrets, 26, quest. 3, sont appelés ventriloques, et ainsi les nomme, en langue ionique, Hippocrates, lib. 5, Epid., comme parlants du ventre. Sophocles les appelle sternomantes. C’étaient divinateurs, enchanteurs et abuseurs de simple peuple, semblants non de la bouche, mais du ventre parler et répondre à ceux qui les interrogeaient.","In the court of this great ingenious master, Pantagruel perceived two kinds of people appearing, importunate and too officious, whom he had in great abomination. Some were called Engastrimythes, others Gastrolatres. The Engastrimyths were said to be descended from the ancient race of Eurycles and on this alleged the testimony of Aristophanes in the comedy entitled the Horseflies or Wasp-flies, of which anciently were said Euryclians, as written by Plato and Plutarch on[4] Book of the Cessation of the Oracles. Is holy decrees, 26, quest. 3, are called ventriloquists, and so names them, in the Ionic language, Hippocrates, lib. 5, Epid., as speaking from the belly. Sophocles calls them sternomantes. They were diviners, enchanters and abusers of simple people, semblants not of the mouth, but of the belly, to speak and answer those who questioned them.","In the Court of that great Master, that ingenious engineer, Pantagruel noticed two kinds of retainers, both importunate and far too obsequious, whom he held in great abomination. Some were called Engastrimyths; the other, Gastrolaters. The Engastrimyths (citing on this subject the testimony of Aristophanes in his comedy called The Wasps) claim to be descended from the ancient family of Eurycles. That is why they were called Euryclians in ancient times as Plato writes (and Plutarch too in Why Oracles Have Ceased). They are called Ventriloquists in the holy Decretum (26 question 3), and Hippocrates (in Book Five of the Epidemics) calls them in Greek ‘Ones talking from the belly’ (Sophocles calls them Sternomantes). They were fortune-tellers, casters of spells and deceivers of simple folk, appearing to speak, and to answer those who questioned them, not with their mouths but their bellies.","AT the Court of that great Master of Ingenuity, Pantagruel observ’d two sorts of troublesom and too officious Apparitors, whom he very much detested. The first, were call’d Engastrimythes; the others, Gastrolaters. The first pretended to be descended of the Ancient Race of Euricles; and for this brought the Authority of Aristophanes, in his Comedy call’d, The Wasps; whence of old they were call’d Euriclians, as Plato writes, and Plutarch in his Book of the Cessation of Oracles. In the Holy Decrees 26 Qu. 3. they are stil’d Ventriloqui; and the same Name is given them in Ionian by Hippocrates, in his Fifth Book of Epid. as Men who speak from the Belly. Sophocles calls them Sternomantes. These were Southsayers, Enchanters, Cheats, who gull’d the Mob, and seem’d not to speak and give Answers from the Mouth; but from the Belly."
"« Foi de Christian, dit Eudémon, j’entre en grande rêverie considérant l’honnêteté de ce moine, car il nous ébaudit ici tous. Et comment donc est-ce qu’on rechasse les moines de toutes bonnes compagnies, les appelants trouble-fête, comme abeilles chassent les frelons d’entour leurs ruches ? Ignavum fucos pecus, dit Maro, a presepibusarcent. » À quoi répondit Gargantua : « Il n’y a rien si vrai que le froc et la cagoule tire à soi les opprobres, injures et malédictions du monde, tout ainsi comme le vent dit Cecias attire les nues. La raison péremptoire est parée qu’ils mangent la merde du monde, c’est-à-dire les péchés, et, comme mâchemerdes, l’on les rejette en leurs retraits[2] : ce sont leurs couvents et abbayes, séparés de conversation politique comme sont les retraits d’une maison. Mais, si entendez pourquoi un singe en une famille est toujours moqué et herselé[3], vous entendrez pourquoi les moines sont de tous refuis, et des vieux et des jeunes. Le singe ne garde point la maison, comme un chien ; il ne tire pas l’arroi[4], comme le bœuf ; il ne produit ni lait ni laine, comme la brebis ; il ne porte pas le faix, comme le cheval.

And how then are monks of all good companies chased away, calling spoilsports, like bees chasing hornets from around their hives? Ignavum fucos pecus, says Maro, a presepibusarcent. To which Gargantua answered: “There is nothing so true that the robe and the hood draw to itself the reproaches, the insults and the curses of the world, just as the wind says Cecias draws the clouds. The peremptory reason is adorned that they eat the shit of the world, that is to say the sins, and, like chowder, they are thrown into their retreats[2]: these are their convents and abbeys, separated from political conversation like withdrawals from a house. But, if you hear why a monkey in a family is always mocked and harassed[3], you will hear why the monks are all shunned, and old and young. The monkey does not guard the house, like a dog; he does not pull the arroi[4], like the ox; it produces neither milk nor wool, like the sheep; he does not carry the load, like the horse. What he does is bullshit and spoil everything, which is why everyone receives teasing and beatings.","The final ‘monastic’ jest takes the incipit of Psalm 122 (113), ‘Ad te levavi’ (‘Unto Thee I lift up’), and applies it to the erect penis (which many believed to be proportionate in size to a man’s nose). But, coarse though he is, the Monk is an acred parable: his virtues are the active Christian virtues: ‘ He toils, he travails, he defends the oppressed; he comforts the afflicted; he succours the needy.’ Puns between paix (peace) and pets (farts) are rarely translatable but can be suggested.] ‘By my faith as a Christian,’ said Eudemon, ‘I am amazed when I reflect on the worthiness of this monk, for he cheers us all up. How is it, then, that men banish monks from all good gatherings, calling them chattering trouble-feasts, just as the bees banish the drones from about their hives? As Virgil said, “Ignavum fucos pecus a presipibus arcent”; “They drive the drones, a slothful herd, far from their dwellings.”’ To which Gargantua replied: ‘There is nothing more true than that frock and cowl attract people’s odium, insults and curses exactly as the wind called Caecias attracts the clouds. The decisive reason is that they eat the shit of the world (the sins, that is) and as chew-shits they are chucked back into their jakes (that is, their convents and monasteries) isolated from polite company as privies are in houses. But if you can grasp why a family’s pet monkey is always mocked and teased you will grasp why monks are rejected by everybody, both young and old. The monkey does not guard the house like a dog, does not draw the plough like the ox, does not give us milk and wool like the sheep, and bears no burden like the horse. All it does is to shit over everything and spoil it. That is why everyone jeers at it and cudgels it.","BY the faith of a Christian (said Eudemon) I do wonderfully dote, and enter in a great extasie, when I consider the honesty and good fellowship of this Monk; for he makes us here all merry. How is it then that they exclude the Monks from all good companies? calling them feast-troublers, marrers of mirth, and disturbers of all civil conversation, as the bees drive away the drones from their hives; Ignavum fucos pecus (said Maro) à prœsepibus arcent. Hereunto answered Gargantua, There is nothing so true, as that the frock and cowle draw unto it self the opprobries, injuries and maledictions of the world, just as the winde called Cecias attracts the clouds: the peremptory reason is, because they eat the ordure and excrements of the world, that is to say, the sins of the people, and like dung-chewers and excrementitious eaters, they are cast into the privies and secessive places; that is, the Covents and Abbeys separated from Political conversation, as the jakes and retreats of a house are: but if you conceive how an Ape in a family is alwayes mocked, and provokingly incensed, you shall easily apprehend how Monks are shunned of all men, both young and old. The Ape keeps not the house as a dog doth: He drawes not in the plow as the oxe: He yields neither milk nor wooll as the sheep: He carrieth no burthen as a horse doth; that which he doth, is only to conskite, spoil and defile all, which is the cause wherefore he hath of all men mocks, frumperies and bastonadoes."

"« Quoi : N’ai-je fait suffisant exercice ? Je me suis vautré six ou sept tours parmi le lit devant que me lever. N’est-ce assez ?

"Mais le bon fut à la procession, en laquelle furent vus plus de six cents mille et quatorze chiens à l’entour d’elle, lesquels lui faisaient mille haires[11] ; et partout où elle passait, les chiens frais venus la suivaient à la trace, pissants par le chemin où ses robes avaient touché. Tout le monde s’arrêtait à ce spectacle, considérant les contenances de ces chiens qui lui montaient jusques au col et lui gâtèrent tous ses beaux accoutrements, à quoi ne sut trouver aucun remède, sinon soi retirer en son hôtel. Et chiens d’aller après, et elle de se cacher, et chambrières de rire. Quand elle fut entrée en sa maison, et fermé la porte après elle, tous les chiens y accouraient de demie lieue, et compissèrent si bien la porte de sa maison qu’ils y firent un ruisseau de leurs urines auquel les canes eussent bien nagé, et c’est celui ruisseau qui, de présent, passe à Saint-Victor, auquel Gobelin teint l’écarlate, pour la vertu spécifique de ces pisse chiens, comme jadis prêcha publiquement notre maître Doribus. Ainsi vous ait Dieu, un moulin y eût pu moudre, non tant toutefois que ceux du Bazacle à Toulouse.","But the good one was in the procession, in which were seen more than six hundred thousand and fourteen dogs around her, which made her a thousand hairs[11]; and wherever she went, the fresh dogs followed her, pissing along the path where her dresses had touched. Everyone stopped at this spectacle, considering the countenances of these dogs which rose to his collar and spoiled all his fine accoutrements, for which no remedy could be found, except to withdraw to his hotel. And dogs to go after, and she to hide, and chambermaids to laugh. When she had entered her house, and closed the door after her, all the dogs ran there from half a league, and entered the door of her house so well that they made a stream of their urine in which the ducks could have swum. and it is the stream which now passes through Saint-Victor, to which Gobelin dyes scarlet, for the specific virtue of these piss dogs, as our master Doribus once publicly preached. So have you God, a mill could have ground there, not so much as those of the Bazacle in Toulouse.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","But the best was at the Procession, in which were seen above six hundred thousand and fourteen dogs about her, which did very much trouble and molest her, and whithersoever she past, those dogs that came afresh, tracing her footsteps, followed her at the heeles, and pist in the way where her gown had touched. All the world stood gazing at this spectacle, considering the countenance of those dogs, who leaping up got about her neck, and spoiled all her gorgeous accoutrements, for the which she could finde no remedy, but to retire unto her house, which was a Palace. Thither she went, and the dogs after her; she ran to hide her self, but the Chamber-maids could not abstaine from laughing. When she was entered into the house, and had shut the door upon her self, all the dogs came running, of half a league round, and did so well bepisse the gate of her house, that there they made a stream with their urine, wherein a duck might have very well swimmed, and it is the same current that now runs at St. Victor, in which Gobelin dieth scarlet, for the specificai vertue of these pisse-dogs, as our master Doribus did heretofore preach publickly. So may God help you: a Mill would have ground corne with it; yet not so much as those of Basacle at Toulouse."

And, leaving Poitiers with some of his companions, passed by Ligugé, visiting the noble Ardillon, abbot, by Lusignan, by Sansay, by Celles, by Coulonges, by Fontenay-le-Comte, saluting the learned Tiraqueau, and from there arrived at Maillezais, where he visited the sepulcher of the said Geoffroy à la grand'tooth, which had a little fright, seeing his portrait, because he is there in image as of a furious man, half pulling his large malchus[2] from the sheath. And was asking the cause of this. The canons of the said place told him that there was no other cause except that pictoribus atque poetis, etc., that is to say that painters and poets are free to paint at their pleasure what they want. But he was not satisfied with their answer and said: ""He is not thus painted without a cause, and I suspect that at his death he has been wronged, for which he asks revenge from his parents. full [3], and will do what is right. »","The inner parts of the building above that court were raised up on pillars of chalcedony and porphyry, with beautiful ancient-style arches, within which were beautiful galleries, long and spacious, decorated with wall-paintings as well as with the horns of stags, [unicorns and hippopotamuses, with elephant tusks] and other objects of note.","Afterwards, reading the delectable Chronicles of his Ancestors, he found that Jafrey of Lusinian, called Jafrey with the great tooth, Grandfather to the Cousin in law of the eldest Sister of the Aunt of the Son in law of the Uncle of the good daughter of his Stepmother, was interred at Maillezais; therefore one day he took campos, (which is a little vacation from study to play a while,) that he might give him a visit as unto an honest man: and going from Poictiers with some of his companions, they passed by the Guge, visiting the noble Abbot Ardillon: then by Lusinian, by Sansay, by Celles, by Coalonges, by Fontenay the Conte, saluting the learned Tiraqueau, and from thence arrived at Maillezais, where he went to see the Sepulchre of the said Jafrey with the great tooth; which made him somewhat afraid, looking upon the picture, whose lively draughts did set him forth in the representation of a man in an extreme fury, drawing his great Malchus faulchion half way out of his scabbard: when the reason hereof was demanded, the Chanons of the said place told him, that there was no other cause of it, but that Pictoribus atque Poetis, &c. that is to say, that Painters and Poets have liberty to paint and devise what they list after their own fancie: but he was not satisfied with their answer, and said, He is not thus painted without a cause; and I suspect that at his death there was some wrong done him, whereof he requireth his Kinred to take revenge: I will enquire further into it, and then do what shall be reasonable; then he returned not to Poictiers, but would take a view of the other Universities of France: therefore going to Rochel, he took shipping and arrived at Bourdeaux, where he found no great exercise, only now and then he would see some Marriners and Lightermen a wrestling on the key or strand by the riverside:"
"– Je t’entends, répondit frère Jean ; cette métaphore est extraite de la marmite claustrale. Le laboureur, c’est le bœuf qui laboure, ou a labouré ; à neuf leçons, c’est-à-dire cuit à perfection. Car les bons pères de religion, par certaine cabalistique institution des anciens, non écrite, mais baillée de main en main, soi levants, de mon temps, pour matines, faisaient certains préambules notables avant entrer en l’église. Fientaient aux fientoirs, pissaient aux pissoirs, crachaient aux crachoirs, toussaient aux toussoirs mélodieusement, rêvaient aux rêvoirs, afin de rien immonde ne porter au service divin. Ces choses faites, dévotement se transportaient en la sainte chapelle (ainsi était en leurs rébus nommée la cuisine claustrale) et dévotement sollicitaient que dès lors fût au feu le bœuf mis pour le déjeuner des religieux, frères de Notre-Seigneur. Eux-mêmes souvent allumaient le feu sous la marmite. Or est que, matines ayant neuf leçons, plus matin se levaient, par raison. Plus aussi multipliaient en appétit et altération, aux abois du parchemin[11], que matines étant ourlées d’une ou trois leçons seulement. Plus matin se levants, par ladite cabale, plus tôt était le bœuf au feu :","“I hear you,” replied Brother Jean; this metaphor is taken from the monastic pot. The plowman is the ox that plows, or has plowed; nine lessons, that is, cooked to perfection. For the good fathers of religion, by certain cabalistic institution of the ancients, unwritten, but yawned from hand to hand, self-rising, of my time, for matins, made certain notable preambles before entering the church. Sludge at the sinks, pissed at the pissoirs, spat at the spittoons, coughed melodiously at the coughs, dreamed at the dreamers, so as not to bring anything filthy to divine service. These things done, devoutly transported themselves to the holy chapel (thus the monastic kitchen was called in their rebus) and devoutly solicited that from then on the beef put on the fire for the lunch of the monks, brothers of Our Lord, should be put on the fire. Themselves often lit the fire under the pot. Now, matins having nine lessons, more matins rose, for good reason. More so multiplied in appetite and alteration, at the behest of the parchment[11], than matins being hemmed with only one or three lessons. The more morning we got up, by said cabal, the sooner was the beef on the fire:","‘I know what you mean!’ Frère Jean replied. ‘ That metaphor has been served up from the cloister cooking-pot. The plougher is a bull formerly used, or still used, for ploughing; nine lessons means cooked to perfection. For in my days, whenever the monastic fathers got up for mattins, they, following a certain ancient practice – cabbalistic: not written but passed down from hand to hand – performed certain noteworthy preliminaries before going into church: they shat in the shitteries, pissed in the pisseries, spat in the spitteries, melodiously hacked in the hackeries and raved in the raveries, so as to bring nothing impure into divine service. Which done, they would devoutly proceed to the Sainte Chapelle (for that was their name for the monastery’s kitchen in their enigmatic jargon) and there devoutly urge that the beef for the breakfast of Our Lord’s monastic brethren be put then and there on the spit. ‘Often they lit the fire under the pot themselves. ‘Now when there were nine lessons at mattins they quite reasonably got up earlier than when mattins were selvaged with but two or three, intensifying their hunger and thirst by their yelping from their parchment antiphonaries. Now (following the aforesaid cabbala) the earlier they got up in the morning, the sooner the beef was put on the fire; the longer it stayed there, the longer it cooked; the longer it cooked, the more tender it became: it was kinder on the teeth, gave more pleasure to the palate and was lighter on the stomach, and provided better nourishment for those excellent monks, such being their Founders’ sole aim and original intention, considering that monks by no means eat to live: they live to eat.","I know thy meaning, (answered Friar John) this Metaphor is extracted out of the Claustral Kettle; the Labourer is the Ox, that hath wrought and done the Labour; after the fashion of Nine Lectures, that is to say, most exquisitely well and throughly boil’d. These holy Religious Fathers, by a certain Cabalistick Institution of the Ancients, not written, but carefully by Tradition conveyed from hand to hand, rising betimes to go to Morning Prayers, were wont to flourish that their matutinal Devotion with some certain notable Preambles before their entry into the Church, viz. They dunged in the Dungeries, pissed in the Pisseries, spit in the Spitteries, melodiously coughed in the Cougheries, and doted in their Doteries, that to the Divine Service they might not bring any thing that was unclean or foul. These things thus done, they very zealously made their repair to the Holy Chapel, (for so was, in their canting Language, termed the Covent Kitchin) where they with no small earnestness, had Care that the Beef Pot should be put on the Crook for the Breakfast of the Religious Brothers of our Lord and Saviour; and the Fire they would kindle under the Pot themselves. Now the Matines consisting of Nine Lessons, was so incumbent on them, that they must have risen the rather for the more expedite dispatching of them all. The sooner that they rose, the sharper was their Appetite, and the Barking of their Stomachs, and the Gnawings increase in the like proportion, and consequently made these Godly Men thrice more a hungred and a-thirst, than when their Matines were hem’d over only with three Lessons. The more betimes they rose by the said Cabal, the sooner was"
"Au sixième jour subséquent, Pantagruel fut de retour, en l’heure que, par eau de Blois, était arrivé Triboulet. Panurge, à sa venue, lui donna une vessie de porc bien enflée et résonnante à cause des pois qui dedans étaient ; plus une épée de bois bien dorée, plus une petite gibecière faite d’une coque de tortue, plus une bouteille clissée pleine de vin breton et un quarteron de pommes blandureau. « Comment, dit Carpalim, est-il fou comme un chou à pommes ? » Triboulet ceignit l’épée et la gibecière, prit la vessie en main, mangea part des pommes, but tout le vin. Panurge le regardait curieusement et dit : « Encore ne vis-je onques fol, (et si en ai vu pour plus de dix mille francs) qui ne bût volontiers et à longs traits. » Depuis lui exposa son affaire en paroles rhétoriques et élégantes.","On the sixth day following, Pantagruel returned, at the hour when, by water from Blois, Triboulet had arrived. Panurge, when he came, gave him a pig's bladder, much swollen and resounding because of the peas that were in it; plus a well-gilded wooden sword, plus a small game bag made of a tortoiseshell, plus a clissé bottle full of Breton wine and a quarteron of blandureau apples. “How, said Carpalim, is he mad as an apple cabbage? Triboulet girded on the sword and the satchel, took the bladder in his hand, ate some of the apples, drank all the wine. Panurge looked at him curiously and said: “Yet have I never seen a madman (and if I have seen one for more than ten thousand francs) who did not drink willingly and in long drafts. Since then he explained his case in rhetorical and elegant words.","Jectigation is caused by the inflowing of the spirit of prophecy, which produces a divine ‘madness’. The lolling head is the sign of a very different kind of madness, bestial stupor, or the worse kind of heavy, melancholy madness.] Six days later Pantagruel returned home at the very time that Triboullet came by river from Blois, on whom, when he docked, Panurge bestowed a pig’s bladder, blown up tight and loudly rattling from the peas inside it, plus a wooden sword highly gilt, together with a game-pouch made from a tortoise shell, a wickered demijohn of vin breton and a quarter-pound of blant dureau apples. ‘What?’ said Carpalim. ‘Is he as daft as an apple-headed cabbage!’ Triboullet girded on the sword and the game-pouch, took the pig’s bladder in his band, munched some of the apples and drank all the wine. Panurge gazed at him intently and said, ‘I have yet to see a fool – and I have seen more than ten thousand francs worth of ’em – who didn’t enjoy drinking and taking long swigs.’ Panurge then expounded his concerns to him in elegant, grandiloquent words.","ON the sixth Day thereafter Pantagruel was returned home, at the very same hour that Triboulet was by Water come from Blois. Panurge, at his Arrival, gave him a Hogs Bladder puffed up with Wind, and resounding, because of the hard Pease that were within it: Moreover, he did present him with a gilt Wooden Sword, a hollow Budget made of a Tortoise shell, an Osier Watled Wicker-Bottle-full of Briton Wine, and five and twenty Apples of the Orchard of Blanduco. If he be such a Fool (quoth Carpalin) as to be won with Apples, there is no more Wit in his Pate, than in the Head of an Ordinary Cabbage. Triboulet girded the Sword and Scrip to his side, took the Bladder in his Hand, ate some few of the Apples, and drunk up all the Wine. Panurge very wistly and heedfully looking upon him, said, I never yet saw a Fool, (and I have seen ten thousand Franks worth of that kind of Cattle) who did not love to drink heartily, and by good long Draughts. When Triboulet had done with his Drinking, Panurge laid out before him, and exposed the Sum of the Business, wherein he was to require his Advice in eloquent and choice-sorted Terms, adorned with Flourishes of Rhetorick."
"« Secondement, sois quitte, car les diables aiment fort les quittes. Je le sais bien quant est de moi. Les pillards ne cessent me mugueter[15] et me faire la cour, ce que ne soulaient[16] étant safrané[17] et endetté. L’âme d’un homme endetté est toute hectique[18] et disgraciée. Ce n’est viande à diables.","“Secondly, be quits, for the devils are very fond of quits. I know it well as far as I am concerned. The looters keep lily of the valley[15] and pay court to me, which I was not relieved[16] by being saffron[17] and in debt. The soul of a man in debt is all hectic[18] and disgraced. This is not devils meat.","‘Secondly: be out of debt, for devils love those who repay their debts. I know that from my own case: those riff-raff never stop making eyes at me and courting me now: something they never did when I was sporting debtor’s yellow. I was owing money: and the soul of a man in debt is all emaciated and dried up. It is not fit meat for devils.","Secondly, Out of Debt: For the Devils carry a great liking to those that are out of Debt. I have sore felt the experience thereof in mine own particular; for now the lecherous Varlets are always wooing me, courting me, and making much of me, which they never did when I was all to pieces. The Soul of one in Debt is insipid, dry, and heretical altogether. Thirdly, With the Cowl and Domino de Grobis, return to Raminagrobis, and in case, being thus qualify’d, Thirty Thousand Boats full of Devils forthwith come not to carry thee quite away, I shall be content to be at the charge of paying for the Pinte and Fagot."
"Voyant frère Jean ces furieuses andouilles ainsi marcher dehait[1], dit à Pantagruel : « Ce sera ici une belle bataille de foin, à ce que je vois. O ! le grand honneur et louanges magnifiques qui seront en notre victoire ! Je voudrais que, dedans votre nef, fussiez de ce conflit seulement spectateur, et au reste me laissiez faire avec mes gens.","Seeing Brother Jean these furious chitterlings thus marching in dehait[1], said to Pantagruel: “It will be a fine battle of hay here, as I see. O! the great honor and magnificent praises which will be in our victory! I would like that, within your nave, you were only spectator of this conflict, and with the rest let me make with my people.","Mock-heroic elements are supplied by Genesis 39, II (IV) Kings 25 and by Erasmus in his Apophthegms, IV, Cicero, 19, after Plutarch.] On seeing those zealous Chidlings marching forth so gaily, Frère Jean said to Pantagruel, ‘As far as I can see, this will be a fine battle of straw! Oh, what great honour and magnificent praise will our victory bring! I could wish that you were aboard your ship and merely a spectator of this conflict, leaving the rest to me and my men.’","FRYAR Jhon, seeing these furious Chitterlings thus boldly march up, said to Pantagruel; here will be a rare Battel of Hobby-horses, a pretty kind of Puppet-show Fight for ought I see; Oh! What mighty Honour and wonderful Glory will attend our Victory? I would have you only be a bare Spectator of this Fight, and for any thing else leave me and my men to deal with them."
"– Puis, dit Pantagruel, que de cette légère solution des doutes proposés vous contentez, aussi fais-je. Ailleurs, et en autre temps, nous en dirons davantage, si bon vous semble. Reste donc à vider ce qu’a frère Jean proposé : « Manière de hausser le temps ? » Ne l’avons-nous à souhait haussé ? Voyez le gabet[9] de la hune. Voyez les sifflements des voiles. Voyez la roideur des étails[10], des utaques[11] et des écoutes. Nous haussants et vidants les tasses s’est pareillement le temps haussé[12] par occulte sympathie de nature. Ainsi le haussèrent Atlas et Hercules, si croyez les sages mythologiens. Mais ils le haussèrent trop d’un demi degré, Atlas, pour plus allègrement festoyer Hercules, son hôte, Hercules, pour les altérations précédentes par les déserts de Libye.","“Then,” said Pantagruel, “that this slight solution of the proposed doubts you be satisfied with, so I do. Elsewhere, and at other times, we will say more, if you see fit. It therefore remains to empty what Brother Jean proposed: “A way to increase the time? “Have we not raised it at will? See the gabet[9] of the top. See the hissing of the sails. See the stiffness of the tails[10], the utaques[11] and the sheets. Raising and emptying our cups has likewise raised time[12] by occult sympathy of nature. So raised Atlas and Hercules, if you believe the wise mythologists. But they raised it half a degree too high, Atlas, to more merrily feast Hercules, its host, Hercules, for the previous alterations by the deserts of Libya.","‘Since,’ said Pantagruel, ‘you are happy with the ready solution I have provided to those problems, so am I. We shall have more to say about them if you like at some other time and place. There remains to resolve the problem posed by Frère Jean: How to raise good weather. But have we not done so already, just as you wanted? Look at the pennant by the crow’s-nest. Look at the wind whistling through the sails. Look at the tautness of the guy-ropes, sheets and stays! While we were raising and emptying our cups, good weather was raised in parallel from an occult sympathy in Nature. ‘That, if you believe the wise mythologists, is how Atlas and Hercules raised it, but they raised it half a degree too high: Atlas, because of feasting Hercules, his guest, too convivially; Hercules, because of his preceding thirsts in the deserts of Libya…’","Since you ask no more than this easie Question, answer’d Pantagruel, I’ll strive to give you satisfaction, and some other time we’ll talk of the rest of the Problems, if you will. Well then, Fryar Jhon ask’d how good Weather might be rais’d: have we not rais’d it? Look up, and see our full Top-sails; Hark! how the Wind whistles through the Shrouds, what a stiff Gale it blows; observe the Rattling of the Tacklings, and see the Sheats, that fasten the Main-sail behind; the force of the Wind puts them upon the stretch. While we pass’d our time merrily, the dull Weather also pass’d away, and while we rais’d the Glasses to our Mouths, we also rais’d the Wind by a secret sympathy in Nature. Thus Atlas and Hercules clubb’d to raise and underprop the falling Sky, if you’ll believe the wise Mythologists; but they rais’d it some half an inch too high; Atlas to entertain his Guest Hercules more pleasantly, and Hercules to make himself amends for the thirst which sometime before had tormented him in the Deserts of Africa.—Your good Father, said Fryar Jhon, interrupting him, takes care to free many People from such an inconveniency; for I have been told by many venerable Doctors, that his chief Butler Turelupin saves above eighteen hundred Pipes of Wine yearly, to make Servants and all comers and goers drink before they are a dry.—As the Camels and Dromedaries of a Caravan, continued Pantagruel, use to drink for the thirst that’s past, for the present, and for that to come, so did Hercules; and being thus excessively rais’d, this gave a new motion to the Sky, which is that of Titubation and Trepidation, about which our crack-brain’d Astrologers make such a pother.—This, said Panurge, makes the saying good,"

Look at this perch of birds, how cozy they are and in good shape from the rents that come to us from them: so they sing well for them.

"« Et ne pensez que la béatitude des héros et semi-dieux, qui sont par les Champs Elyséens, soit en leur asphodèle, ou ambroisie, ou nectar, comme disent ces vieilles ici.

It is, in my opinion, in that they wipe a gosling's ass, and such is the opinion of Master John of Scotland. »","And do not believe that the blessedness of the heroes and demi-gods in the Elysian Fields lies in their nectar, asphodel or ambrosia, as these old women would maintain: in my opinion it consists in the fact that they wipe their bums on a young goose.’ [And such is the opinion of Master Duns Scotus.]","Afterwards I wiped my taile with a hen, with a cock, with a pullet, with a calves skin, with a hare, with a pigeon, with a cormorant, with an Atturneyes bag, with a montero, with a coife, with a faulconers lure; but, to conclude, I say and maintain, that of all torcheculs, arsewisps, bumfodders, tail-napkins, bung-hole cleansers and wipe-breeches, there is none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose, that is well douned, if you hold her head betwixt your legs; and beleeve me therein upon mine honour, for you will thereby feele in your nockhole a most wonderful pleasure, both in regard of the softnesse of the said doune, and of the temperate heat of the goose, which is easily communicated to the bum-gut, and the rest of the inwards, insofarre as to come even to the regions of the heart and braines; And think not, that the felicity of the heroes and demi-gods in the Elysian fields consisteth either in their Asphodele, Ambrosia, or Nectar, as our old women here used to say; but in this, (according to my judgement) that they wipe their tailes with the neck of a goose, holding her head betwixt their legs, and such is the opinion of Master John of Scotland, aliàs Scotus."

"– Ils ne chôment pas, dirent-ils ; nous les rencontrerons tantôt. Ils vous ont pris Bretagne, Normandie, Flandres, Hainaut, Brabant, Artois, Hollande, Zélande ; ils ont passé le Rhin par sus le ventre des Suisses et Lansquenets, et part d’entre eux ont dompté Luxembourg, Lorraine, la Champagne, Savoie jusques à Lyon, auquel lieu ont trouvé vos garnisons retournants des conquêtes navales de la mer Méditerranée, et se sont rassemblés en Bohême, après avoir mis à sac Souève[24], Vuitemberg[25], Bavière, Autriche, Moravie, et Styrie. Puis ont donné fièrement ensemble sur Lubeck, Norwerge, Sweden Rich, Dace, Gotthie, Engroneland[26], les Estrelins, jusques à la mer Glaciale. Ce fait, conquêtèrent les îles Orchades, et subjuguèrent Écosse, Angleterre et Irlande. De là, navigants par la mer Sabuleuse[27] et par les Sarmates, ont vaincu et dompté Prussie, Polonie, Lituanie, Russie, Valache, la Transilvane et Hongrie, Bulgarie, Turquie, et sont à Constantinople.","“They are not idle,” they said; we will meet them later. They took from you Brittany, Normandy, Flanders, Hainaut, Brabant, Artois, Holland, Zeeland; they crossed the Rhine over the belly of the Swiss and Lansquenets, and part of them tamed Luxembourg, Lorraine, Champagne, Savoy as far as Lyons, where your garrisons were found returning from the naval conquests of the Mediterranean Sea, and gathered in Bohemia, after having sacked Souève[24], Vuitemberg[25], Bavaria, Austria, Moravia, and Styria. Then gave proudly together on Lubeck, Norway, Sweden Rich, Dace, Gotthie, Engroneland[26], the Estrelins, to the Glacial Sea. This fact, conquered the Orchades Islands, and subjugated Scotland, England and Ireland. From there, navigating by the Sabulous Sea [27] and by the Sarmatians, conquered and tamed Prussia, Poland, Lithuania, Russia, Valache, Transilvane and Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey, and are in Constantinople.","‘They are not being idle,’ they said. ‘We shall link up with them soon. They have taken Brittany for you, together with Normandy, Flanders, Hainault, Brabant, Artois, Holland and Zeeland. They have crossed the Rhine over the guts of the Swedes and the Lansquenets. ‘Part of them have quelled Luxembourg, Lorraine, Champagne and Savoy as far as Lyons, where they met up with your troops returning from their naval victories in the Mediterranean Sea and are now regrouped in Bohemia, having first sacked Swabia, Würtemberg, Bavaria, Austria, Moravia and Styria. Then together they fiercely attacked Lübeck, Norway, Sweden, Dacia, Gothia, Greenland and the Hanseatics as far as the Frozen Sea. ‘That done, they conquered the Orkneys and subjugated Scotland, England and Ireland. From there they navigated through the shoals of the Baltic Sea, passed through the Sarmatians, vanquished and subdued Prussia, Poland, Lithuania, Russia, Walachia, Transylvania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and are now in Constantinople.’","They are not idle (said they) we shall meet with them by and by, they shall have won you Britany, Normandy, Flanders, Haynault, Brabant, Artois, Holland, Zealand; they have past the Rhine over the bellies of the Switsers and Lanskenets, and a Party of these hath subdued Luxemburg, Lorrain, Champaigne and Savoy, even to Lions, in which place they have met with your forces, returning from the naval Conquests of the Mediterranean sea: and have rallied again in Bohemia, after they had plundered and sacked Suevia, Wittemberg, Bavaria, Austria, Moravia and Styria. Then they set fiercely together upon Lubeck, Norway, Swedeland, Rie, Denmark, Gitland, Greenland, the Sterlins, even unto the frozen sea; this done, they conquered the isles of Orkney, and subdued Scotland, England and Ireland.

"Lors le regardant, trouvèrent écrit par dedans en hébreu : Lamah hazabthani, dont appelèrent Épistémon, lui demandant que c’était à dire ? À quoi répondit que c’étaient mots hébraïques signifiant : « Pourquoi m’as-tu laissé ? » Dont soudain répliqua Panurge : « J’entends le cas. Voyez-vous ce diamant ? c’est un diamant faux. Telle est donc l’exposition de ce veut dire la dame : « Dis, amant faux, pourquoi m’as-tu laissée ? » Laquelle exposition entendit Pantagruel incontinent et lui souvint comment, à son départir[10], il n’avait dit adieu à la dame, et s’en contristait, et volontiers fût retourné à Paris pour faire sa paix avec elle. Mais Épistémon lui réduit à mémoire le département d’Enée d’avec Didon, et le dit[11] d’Héraclides Tarentin que la navire restant à l’ancre, quand la nécessité presse, il faut couper la corde plutôt que perdre temps à la délier, et qu’il devait laisser tous pensements[12] pour survenir[13] à la ville de sa nativité qui était en danger.","Then looking at it, found written within in Hebrew: Lamah hazabthani, whom called Epistemon, asking him what was to be said? To which replied that they were Hebrew words meaning: ""Why did you leave me?"" Which suddenly replied Panurge: “I hear the case. Do you see this diamond? it's a fake diamond. Such, then, is the exposition of what the lady means: ""Tell me, false lover, why did you leave me? » Which exposition heard Pantagruel immediately and reminded him how, on his departure[10], he had not said goodbye to the lady, and was saddened by it, and gladly had returned to Paris to make his peace with her. But Epistemon reduces to memory the department of Aeneas from Dido, and says[11] of Héraclides Tarentin that the ship remaining at anchor, when the necessity presses, it is necessary to cut the rope rather than waste time to untie her, and that he must leave all thoughts[12] to come to the city of his birth, which was in danger.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.",": let us therefore look upon it. Which when they had done, they found this in Hebrew written within, Lamach sabathani; whereupon they called Epistemon, and asked him what that meant? to which he answered, that they were Hebrew words, signifying, Wherefore hast thou forsaken me? upon that Panurge suddenly replied: I know the mystery, do you see this diamond? it is a false one; this, then is the exposition of that which the Lady meanes, Diamant faux, that is, false lover, why hast thou forsaken me? which interpretation Pantagruel presently understood, and withal remembering, that at his departure he had not bid the Lady farewel, he was very sorry, and would faine have returned to Paris, to make his peace with her; but Epistemon put him in minde of Æneas’s departure from Dido, and the saying of Heraclitus of Tarentum, That the ship being at anchor when need requireth, we must cut the cable rather then lose time about untying of it, and that he should lay aside all other thoughts, to succour the City of his Nativity, which was then in danger; and indeed within an houre after that, the winde arose at the north-north-west, wherewith they hoised saile, and put out, even into the maine sea, so that within few dayes, passing by Porto Sancto, and by the Maderas, they went ashore in the Canarie islands"

Gullible superstition is added to the defects of the Papimanes and their religion. In demanding for the Decretals the adoration of ‘latria’ the Bishop wants the Decretals to be worshipped as God; ‘hyperdulia’ is that highest veneration that many (though not, it seems, Rabelais) believed owed to the Virgin Mary.

Parisian students used ‘Clos Bruneau’, still the name of a little passage in the Latin Quarter, as slang for the anus (Brown Close). ‘Incagulating’ is a nonce-word based on the Spanish cagar, to shit.","e’en leave you for a moment or two; this Stuff has unbung’d the Orifice of my Mustard-Barrel, but I’ll not tarry long.

What great Learning, inestimable Erudition, and Godlike Precepts, are knit, link’d, rivetted and mortais’d in the Divine Chapters of these eternal Decretals? Oh! How wonderfully, if you read but one demy Canon, short Paragraph, or single Observation of these Sacrosanct Decretals, how wonderfully, I say, do you not perceive to kindle in your Hearts, a furnace of divine Love, Charity towards your Neighbour (provided he be no Heretic,) bold Contempt of all casual and sublunary Things, firm Content in all your affections, and extatic Elevation of Soul even to the third Heaven!"

"Puis demandâmes qui mouvait ces oiseaux à ainsi sans cesse chanter. Æditue nous répondit que c’étaient les cloches pendantes au-dessus de leurs cages.

Then rang a bell only six strokes, and monastics to come running, and monastics to sing. ""And if,"" said Panurge, ""I rang this bell, would I likewise make those here sing who have the pennage [9] the color of a herring?"" “As well,” answered Aeditue.","We then asked what moved those birds to chant thus incessantly. The Aedituus replied it was the bells hanging over their cages. He then said to us: ‘Those Monkogoths you can see over there clad in a cape with a hood like a bag for straining hippocras: would you like me to make them chant now like meadow-larks?’ ‘Kindly do so,’ we replied. Thereupon he rang a bell six times only; whereupon Monkogoths came rushing up and Monkogoths began to sing. ‘Now,’ said Panurge, ‘if I were to ring that bell, would I make those birds sing which have plumage the colour of red herrings?’ ‘Just the same,’ said the Aedituus.","We then ask’d what mov’d those Birds to be thus continually chanting and singing? he answer’d, that it was the Bells that hang’d on the Tops of their Cages.

23. Comment Panurge prend conseil d’Épistémon,23. How Panurge takes advice from Epistemon,"CHAPTER 24 [Like Gargantua after his foul education at the hands of Sorbonagres, Panurge needs to be treated with hellebore, the Classical cure for madness. (Cf. Erasmus, Adages, I, VIII, LI, ‘To drink hellebore’.) Epistemon criticizes the narrative style of Enguerrand de Monstrelet in the light of Lucian’s How to Write History. Rabelais edited and translated the Aphorisms of Hippocrates. The first aphorism, dealing with ‘the Art’ (that is, the Art of Medicine) states that ‘Art is long: life is short, and judgement is difficult’. Rabelais has read Plutarch’s Why Oracles Have Ceased, which comes into its own on his next Book. For Panurge’s ‘Ogygian Isles’ he again turned to Plutarch, to his treatise On the Face to Be Seen in the Moon. He remembers an adage of Erasmus: I, V, XXIX, ‘As mute as fishes’. The wise Epistemon’s hesitation about consulting oracles parallels the hesitations expressed in the poem cited in Chapter 21.",CHAPTER XXIV How Panurge consulteth with Epistemon.

Master François Villon, banished from France, had retired to him. He had received him with such great privateness that nothing deprived him of the petty business of his household. One day the aforesaid king, being at his business, showed Villon the coat of arms of France in painting, and said to him: ""Do you see what reverence I bear to your French kings?"" Elsewhere do I have their coat of arms only in this retreat here, near my pierced saddle.","By so doing you have saved me the cost of an enema.’) Another example: Edward the Fifth, King of England. Maître François Villon, exiled from France, had gone over to him. The king admitted him to such great intimacy that he hid none of the little household secrets from him. One day, when the said king was doing his job on his jakes, he showed Villon a painting of the arms of France. ‘ See in what reverence I hold your French kings! I have their arms nowhere but here in my privy, hard by my close-stool.’","e’en sav’d me the expence of a Clyster. I’ll give you another Example of Edward the Fifth, King of England. Master Francis Villon being banish’d France, fled to him, and got so far into his Favour as to be privy to all his Houshold Affairs. One day the King being on his Close-stool, show’d Villon the Arms of France, and said to him, Dost thou see what respect I have for thy French Kings? I have none of their Arms any where but in this Back-side near my Close-stool."
"– Dont[14] ils étaient venus, dit-il ; ils ne firent seulement que changer maître. Mais j’en employai bien trois mille à marier, non les jeunes filles, car elles ne trouvent que trop maris, mais grandes vieilles sempiterneuses qui n’avaient dents en gueule. Considérant : ces bonnes femmes ici ont très bien employé leur temps en jeunesse, et ont joué du serre-croupière à cul levé à tous venants, jusques à ce qu’on n’en a plus voulu. Et par Dieu, je les ferai saccader encore une fois devant qu’elles meurent. Par ce moyen, à l’une donnais cent florins, à l’autre six vingts, à l’autre trois cents, selon qu’elles étaient bien infâmes, détestables et abominables, car, d’autant qu’elles étaient plus horribles et exécrables, d’autant il leur fallait donner davantage, autrement le diable ne les eût voulu bis-coter. Incontinent, m’en allais à quelque porteur de coutrets[15] gros et gras et faisais moi-même le mariage. Mais, premier que[16] lui montrer les vieilles, je lui montrais les écus, disant : « Compère, voici qui est à toi si tu veux fretinfretailler un bon coup. » Dès lors les pauvres hères bubajallaient[17] comme vieux mulets ; ainsi leur faisais bien apprêter à banqueter, boire du meilleur, et force épiceries pour mettre les vieilles en rut et en chaleur. Fin de compte, ils besognaient comme toutes bonnes âmes, sinon qu’à celles qui étaient horriblement vilaines et défaites je leur faisais mettre un sac sur le visage.","""From which [14] they came,"" said he; they only changed masters. But I employed a good three thousand to marry off, not the young girls, for they find only too many husbands, but tall, stubborn old women who had no teeth in their mouths. Considering: these good women here spent their time very well in youth, and played the croupier with ass lifted to all comers, until they were no longer wanted. And by God, I'll jerk them off again before they die. By this means, to one I gave a hundred florins, to another sixty, to another three hundred, according as they were very infamous, detestable and abominable, because, as much as they were more horrible and execrable, all the more so they had to give more, otherwise the devil would not have wanted to bis-cote them. Immediately, I went to some bearer of big and fat knives[15] and made the marriage myself. But, the first [16] to show him the old ones, I showed him the crowns, saying: ""Buddy, here's yours if you want to fretinfretail a good shot."" From then on, the poor wretches went about [17] like old mules; so I made them ready to have a banquet, drink the best, and a lot of groceries to put the old women in heat and in heat. In the end, they worked like all good souls, except that those who were horribly ugly and defeated I made them put a bag over their faces.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","They returned from whence they came (said he) they did no more but change their Master. But I employed at least three thousand of them ( that is, three hundred pounds English,) in marrying (not young Virgins; for they finde but too many husbands) but great old sempiternous trots, which had not so much as one tooth in their heads; and that out of the consideration I had, that these good old women had very well spent the time of their youth in playing at the close-buttock-game to all commers, serving the foremost first, till no man would have any more dealing with them. And by G—, I will have their skin-coat shaken once yet before they die; by this means, to one I gave a hundred florins, to another six score, to another three hundred, according to that they were infamous, detestable and abominable; for, by how much the more horrible and execrable they were, so much the more must I needs have given them, otherwayes the devil would not have jum’d them. Presently I went to some great and fat woodporters, or such like, and did my selfe make the match, but before I did shew him the old Hags, I made a faire muster to him of the Crownes saying, Good fellow, see what I will give thee, if thou wilt but condescend to dufle, dinfredaille, or lecher it one good time: then began the poor rogues to gape like old mules, and I caused to be provided for them a banquet, with drink of the best, and store of spiceries, to put the old women in rut and heat of lust. To be short, they occupied all, like good soules; only to those that were horribly ugly and ill-favoured, I caused their head to be put within a bag, to hide their face."

"Alors descendit Gymnaste de son cheval, et, montant au noyer, souleva le moine par les goussets[8] d’une main, et de l’autre défit sa visière du croc de l’arbre, et ainsi le laissa tomber en terre, et soi après. Descendu que fut, le moine se défit de tout son harnais[9], et jeta l’une pièce après l’autre parmi le champ, et reprenant son bâton de la croix, remonta sur son cheval, lequel Eudémon avait retenu à la fuite. Ainsi s’en vont joyeusement, tenants le chemin de la Saulsaie.","Then Gymnast dismounted from his horse, and, mounting the walnut tree, lifted the monk by the gussets[8] with one hand, and with the other undid his visor from the fang of the tree, and thus let him fall to the ground, and self afterwards. Descended as he was, the monk undid all his harness[9], and threw one coin after another among the field, and taking up his staff from the cross, remounted his horse, which Eudemon had held back in flight. . So they depart happily, taking the road to La Saulsaie.","It was then that Gymnaste dismounted, climbed the tree, raised the Monk by the gussets with one hand and with the other freed the visor from the stump. He let the Monk fall to the ground and he followed after. As soon as he was down, the Monk stripped off all his armour and tossed one piece after another all over the field; then, taking up again the shaft of his cross, he remounted his horse which Eudemon had arrested in flight. And so on they went joyfully, taking the road to La Saulaie.

Assoon as the Monk was down, he put off all his armour, and threw away one piece after another about the field, & taking to him again his staffe of the Crosse, remounted up to his horse, which Eudemon had caught in his running away.

"« J’ai davantage[3] souvent ouï dire que tout homme vieux, décrépit et près de sa fin, facilement devine des cas à venir, et me souvient qu’Aristophanes, en quelque comédie, appelle les gens vieux sibylles, ο δε γέρων σίβυλλια , cas, comme nous, étants sur le môle et de loin voyants les mariniers et voyageurs dedans leurs nefs en haute mer, seulement en silence les considérons et bien prions pour leur prospère abordement, mais, lorsqu’ils approchent du havre, et par paroles et par gestes les saluons et congratulons de ce que à port de saulveté[4] sont avec nous arrivés : aussi les anges, les héros, les bons démons (selon la doctrine des Platoniques) voyants les humains prochains de mort, comme de port très sûr et salutaire, port de repos et de tranquillité, hors les troubles et sollicitudes terriennes, les saluent, les consolent, parlent avec eux, et jà[5] commencent leur communiquer art de divination.","“I have often heard[3] say that every old man, decrepit and near his end, easily guesses future cases, and remembers that Aristophanes, in some comedy, calls people old sibyls, ο δε γέρων σίβυλλια , case, like us, being on the mole and from afar seeing the sailors and travelers in their ships on the high seas, only in silence consider them and well pray for their prosperous landing, but, when they approach the harbor, and by words and gestures let us salute and congratulate that at port of safety [4] have arrived with us: also the angels, the heroes, the good demons (according to the doctrine of the Platonics) seeing the humans near death, as of port very safe and salutary, port of rest and tranquility, apart from earthly troubles and solicitudes, greet them, console them, talk with them, and jà[5] begin to communicate to them the art of divination.","I have often heard it said, moreover, that every aged man, when frail and near his end, may readily divine future events. I recall that Aristophanes in one of his comedies calls old men Sibyls: ‘Ο δὲ ϒέQων σιβνλλιᾷ.10 ‘For when we are on a jetty and see the mariners and the passengers in their ships far off upon the high seas we can only gaze at them in silence and pray piously for their safe berthing; but when they draw close to harbour we can greet them by both word and gesture and congratulate them on having reached us ashore in a safe port; similarly, according to the doctrines of the Platonists, angels, heroes and good daemons, seeing humans draw close to death (as to a most safe and salutary port of rest and quietness, free from earthly cares and solicitudes,) welcome them, comfort them, speak with them and already begin to communicate to them the art of divination.","It hath been likewise told me frequently, That old decrepit Men upon the Brinks of Charon’s Banks, do usher their Disease with a disclosure, all at ease (to those that are desirous of such Informations) of the determinate and assured truth of future Accidents and Contingencies. I remember also, that Aristophanes, in a certain Comedy of his, calleth Folks Sibyls, ῾Ο δὲ γερων σιβυλλια, for as when being upon a Peer by the Shore, we see afar off Mariners, Seafaring Men, and other Travellers alongst the curled Waves of Azure Thetis within their Ships , we then consider them in silence only, and seldom proceed any further than to wish them a happy and prosperous Arrival: but when they do approach near to the Haven, and come to wet their Keels within their Harbour, then both with words and gestures we salute them, and heartily congratulate their Access safe to the Port wherein we are our selves. Just so the Angels, Heroes, and good Demons (according to the Doctrin of Platonicks) when they see Mortals drawing near unto the Harbour of the Grave, as the most sure and calmest Port of any, full of Repose, Ease, Rest, Tranquility; free from the Troubles and Sollicitudes of this tumultuous and tempestuous World; then is it that they with alacrity hale and salute them, Cherish and Comfort them, and speaking to them lovingly, begin even then to bless them with Illuminations, and to communicate unto them the abstrusest Mysteries of Divination."
"Et donnant des éperons à son cheval, passa franchement outre, sans que jamais son cheval eût frayeur des corps morts, car il l’avait accoutumé, selon la doctrine d’Elian, à ne craindre les âmes ni corps morts, – non en tuant les gens, comme Diomèdes tuait les Thraces et Ulysses mettait les corps de ses ennemis ès pieds de ses chevaux, ainsi que raconte Homère, – mais en lui mettant un fantôme[9] parmi son foin et le faisant ordinairement passer sur icelui quand il lui baillait son avoine. Les trois autres le suivirent sans faillir, excepté Eudémon, duquel le cheval enfonça le pied droit jusques au genou dedans la panse d’un gros et gras vilain qui était là noyé à l’envers, et ne le pouvait tirer hors. Ainsi demeurait empêtré jusques à ce que Gargantua, du bout de son bâton, enfondra[10] le reste des tripes du vilain en l’eau, cependant que le cheval levait le pied, et (qui est chose merveilleuse en hippiatrie[11]) fut ledit cheval guéri d’un suros qu’il avait en celui pied, par l’attouchement des boyaux de ce gros maroufle.","And giving spurs to his horse, frankly passed on, without his horse ever being afraid of dead bodies, for he had accustomed him, according to the doctrine of Elian, not to fear souls or dead bodies, - not by killing people, as Diomedes slew the Thracians and Ulysses laid the bodies of his enemies at the feet of his horses, as Homer relates, - but by putting a ghost[9] among his hay and usually passing it over him when he yawned his oats. The other three followed him unfailingly, except Eudemon, whose right foot the horse sank to the knee in the paunch of a big fat villain who was there drowned upside down, and could not pull him out. Thus remained entangled until Gargantua, with the end of his staff, buried [10] the rest of the villain's guts in the water, while the horse lifted his foot, and (which is a marvelous thing in hippiatry[11]) was the said horse cured of a suros that he had in his foot, by the touch of the intestines of this big rascal.","And giving his horse the spur, he confidently went across without his horse ever taking fright at the dead bodies (for, following the teachings of Aelian, he had trained it to fear neither weapons nor corpses, not by killing folk as Diomedes killed the Thracians, nor following what Ulysses did – as Homer tells us – by dragging the bodies of his foes before the hooves of his horses, but by putting a dummy corpse amongst its litter and making it habitually walk over it when he gave it its oats). The other three followed him across without trouble, except for Eudemon, whose horse plunged its right hoof, fetlock-deep, into the paunch of a great, fat peasant lying drowned on his back, and could not pull it out again. And the horse remained there hobbled until Gargantua used the end of his staff to thrust the remainder of the peasant’s guts deep into the water while the horse lifted its hoof. And, behold – a hippiatric miracle! – the aforesaid horse was cured of an exostosis on that hoof by a touch from the innards of that fat clod-hopper. How Gargantua combed cannon-balls out of his hair","Yes, yes, (said Gymnastes) or I shall stick in the way: then setting spurs to his horse, he past through freely, his horse not fearing, nor being any thing affrighted at the sight of the dead bodies; for he had accustomed him (according to the doctrine of Ælian) not to feare armour, nor the carcasses of dead men; and that not by killing men as Diomedes did the Thracians, or as Ulysses did in throwing the Corpses of his enemies at his horses feet, as Homer saith, but by putting a Jack-a-lent amongst his hay, & making him go over it ordinarily, when he gave him his oates. The other three followed him very close, except Eudemon only, whose horses foreright or far forefoot, sank up to the knee in the paunch of a great fat chuffe, who lay there upon his back drowned, and could not get it out: there was he pestered, until Gargantua with the end of his staffe thrust down the rest of the Villains tripes into the water, whilest the horse pulled out his foot; and (which is a wonderful thing in Hippiatrie,) the said horse was throughly cured of a ringbone which he had in that foot, by this touch of the burst guts of that great loobie."

"Bacbuc, jetants ne sais quoi dans le timbre[1], dont soudain fut l’ébullition de l’eau restreinte, mena Panurge au temple major, au lieu central auquel était la vivifique fontaine. Là, tirant un gros livre d’argent en forme d’un demi-muid eu d’un quart de sentences, le puisa dedans la fontaine, et lui dit : « Les philosophes prêcheurs et docteurs de votre monde vous paissent[2] de belles paroles par les oreilles ; ici, nous réellement incorporons nos préceptions[3] par la bouche. Pourtant je ne vous dis : Lisez ce chapitre, voyez cette glose ; je vous dis : Tâtez[4] ce chapitre, avalez cette belle glose. Jadis un antique prophète de la nation judaïque mangea un livre et fut clerc jusques aux dents ; présentement vous en boirez un, et serez clerc jusques au foie. Tenez, ouvrez les mandibules. »","Bacbuc, throwing I don't know what into the bell[1], of which suddenly the boiling of the restricted water was, led Panurge to the temple major, to the central place where the vivifying fountain was. There, drawing a large silver book in the shape of a half-muid or a quarter of sentences, drew it from the fountain, and said to him: ""The preaching philosophers and doctors of your world fine words through the ears; here, we actually incorporate our precepts[3] by mouth. Yet I am not saying to you: Read this chapter, see this gloss; I say to you: Test[4] this chapter, swallow this beautiful gloss. Formerly an ancient prophet of the Judaic nation ate a book and was a cleric to the teeth; presently you will drink one, and be cleric even to the liver. Here, open the mandibles. »","CHAPTER 45 [The Quart, the Fourth Book of the Sentences of Peter Lombard allows (again) a pun between fourth and quart, the liquid measure. In Ezekiel 3 the Lord gave the prophet a book to eat and digest. Hermes Trismegistus was the legendary source of ‘hermetic’ knowledge. Panomphaeus is an epithet of Jupiter, the ‘author of all the oracles’. As elsewhere, ‘Aesop’s beggar’s wallet’ is worn over the shoulder and has a pocket in front and another behind. The theme was developed at the end of Chapter 15 of the Third Book. There are implicit appeals to Chapters 7 and 10 of the Third Book and to the preliminary poem of Gargantua apropos of laughter as the property of man.] Bacbuc tossed something or other into the basin of the Fountain and the water at once stopped seething. She led Panurge into the centre of the Greater Temple, in which stood that life-giving Fountain. Then, drawing forth a silver book in the shape of a demijohn (or a Quart of the Sentences), she immersed it in the fountain and said unto him: ‘The philosophers, preachers and divines in your world feed you with fair words through your ears: here we really incorporate our precepts through the mouth. That is why I do not say unto you, “Read this chapter; look upon this gloss.” What I say is, “Taste this chapter: ingurgitate this beautiful gloss.” In days gone by an ancient prophet of the Jewish people did eat a book and became a clerk up to his teeth. You will now drink a book, and become a clerk up to your liver. Here. Open your mandibles.’","I don’t know what into the Fountain, strait the Water ceas’d to boil, and then she took Panurge into the greater Temple, where was the enlivening Fountain. There she took out a hugeous Silver Book in the shape of a Half-tierce, or Hog’shead of Sentences; and having fill’d it at the Fountain, said to him; The Philosophers, Preachers and Doctors of your World feed you up with fine Words and Cant at the Ears; now, here we really incorporate our Precepts at the Mouth. Therefore I’ll not say to you, Read this Chapter, see this Gloss; No, I say to you, Taste me this fine Chapter, swallow me this rare Gloss.

"Toute notre chiourme[10] grandement se contristait, et force vent à travers les méjanes[11] ; mais frère Jean onques ne s’en donna mélancolie, ains[12] consolait maintenant l’un, maintenant l’autre par douces paroles, leur remontrant que de bref aurions secours du ciel, et qu’il avait vu Castor sur le bout des antennes. « Plût à Dieu, dit Panurge, être à cette heure à terre, et rien plus, et que chacun de vous autres, qui tant aimez la marine[13], eussiez deux cent mille écus. Je vous mettrais un veau en mue, et rafraîchirais un cent de fagots pour votre retour. Allez, je consens jamais ne me marier : faites seulement que je sois mis en terre, et que j’aie cheval pour m’en retourner : de valet je me passerai bien. Je ne suis jamais si bien traité que quand je suis sans valet.

Ailleurs non, combien que les coteurs[15] de droit en ce temps, hors ce royaume, l’aient tiré à conséquence alogique, c’est-à-dire déraisonnable. »","All our crew[10] were greatly saddened, and strong wind through the méjanes[11]; but Brother Jean onques did not give himself melancholy, thus [12] now consoled one, now the other with sweet words, showing them that brief help from heaven would come, and that he had seen Castor on the end of the antennae. “Would to God,” said Panurge, “to be ashore at this hour, and nothing more, and that each of you, who love the navy so much, had two hundred thousand crowns. I would put you a moulting calf, and refresh a hundred fagots for your return. Come on, I never consent to marry: only make sure that I am buried, and that I have a horse to return: I will do without a valet. I'm never treated so well as when I'm without a valet. Plautus never lied about it saying the number of our crosses, that is to say afflictions, troubles, annoyances, to be according to the number of our servants, even were they without language, which is the most dangerous and evil part[ 14] which is to a valet, and for which alone were invented the tortures, questions and gehenna on the valets.

A strong wind came whistling through our mizzen; Frère Jean never once gave way to melancholy but consoled this man and heartened that one by gentle words, assuring them that we would soon receive help from Heaven and that he had glimpsed Castor shining atop the lateen-yards. ‘Would to God,’ said Panurge, ‘that I was at this hour upon land. Nothing more. And that every man-jack of you who loves the briny had two hundred thousand crowns apiece. I would set a calf aside for you and get a hundred bundles of firewood ready against your return. All right then: I agree never to get married: just see that I’m set ashore with a horse to carry me back. I shall manage well enough without a valet. Plautus was telling no lie when he said that the number of our crosses – that is to say of our afflictions, torments and vexations – is in proportion to the number of our valets, yes, even were they to lack the most dangerous and evil part of a valet, his tongue, on account of which alone the torturing, racking and questioning of valets was instituted; there were no other reasons, although in those days and outside this kingdom glossators of the law drew from it an a-logical (i.e., an unreasonable) conclusion.’","I blush like any black Dog, and could be as testy as an old Cook, when I think on all this; it passes my Understanding.

"Là j’eus pleine intelligence de ce qu’Atteius Capito, Pollux, Marcellus, A.

Peu aussi de doute fîmes des enfants Matabrune convertis en cygnes, et des hommes de Pallène en Thrace, lesquels soudain que par neuf fois se baignent au palude Tritonique, sont en oiseaux transformés. Depuis autre propos ne nous tint que de cages et d’oiseaux.","There I had full understanding of what Atteius Capito, Pollux, Marcellus, A. Gellius, Athenæus, Suidas, Ammonius and others had written about the Siticines and Sicinnists, and it was difficult for us to believe the transformations of Nyctimene, Progné , Itys, Alcmene, Antigone, Tereus and other birds. There was also little doubt that Matabrune children were converted into swans, and the men of Pallene in Thrace, who suddenly bathed nine times in the Tritonic marsh, were transformed into birds. Since then, we only heard about cages and birds.","There I was fully informed of what Atteius Capito, Pollux, Marcellus, Aulus Gellius, Athenaeus, Suidas, Ammonius and others had written on the subject of the Siticines and the Sicin-nists; after which it did not seem hard to us to believe in the metamorphoses of Nyctimene, Progne, Itys, Alcyone, Antigone, Tereus and other birds. We had no more doubts either about the children of Matabrune, who were changed into swans, nor about the men of Pallene (in Thrace), who, at the precise moment that they bathed nine times in Lake Triton, were also turned into birds. Thereafter he talked of nothing but birds and cages.","There I had a full Account of all that Atteius Capito, Paulus, Marcellus, A. Gellius, Athenœus, Suidas, Ammonius and others had writ of the Siticines and Sicinnists; and then we thought we might as easily believe the Transmutations of Nectimene, Progne, Itys, Alcyone, Antigone, Tereus, and other Birds. Nor did we think it more reasonable to doubt of the Transmogrification of the Macrobian Children into Swans, or that of the Men of Pallene in Thrace into Birds, as soon as they have bath’d themselves in the Tritonic Lake.

"Puis descendis par les dents du derrière pour venir aux baulièvres[9] ; mais en passant, je fus détroussé des brigands par une grande forêt qui est vers la partie des oreilles. Puis trouvai une petite bourgade à la devallée[10] (j’ai oublié son nom), où je fis encore meilleure chère que jamais, et gagnai quelque peu d’argent pour vivre. Savez-vous comment ? À dormir, car l’on loue les gens à journée pour dormir, et gagnent cinq et six sols par jour ; mais ceux qui ronflent bien fort gagnent bien sept sols et demi. Et contais aux sénateurs comment on m’avait détroussé par la vallée, lesquels me dirent que, pour tout vrai, les gens de delà étaient mal vivants et brigands de nature. À quoi je connus qu’ainsi comme nous avons les contrées de deçà et delà les monts, aussi ont-ils deçà et delà les dents. Mais il fait beaucoup meilleur deçà, et y a meilleur air.","Then descended by the teeth of the back to come to the baulièvres[9]; but in passing, I was robbed of the brigands by a large forest which is towards the part of the ears. Then found a small town in the valley[10] (I forget its name), where I lived even better than ever, and earned a little money to live on. Do you know how ? To sleep, because people are hired by the day to sleep, and earn five or six sols a day; but those who snore very loudly earn a good seven and a half sols. And told the senators how I had been robbed by the valley, who told me that, for all truth, the people there were sick and brigands by nature. From which I knew that thus as we have the regions on this side and beyond the mountains, so they have on this side and beyond the teeth. But it's much better down here, and there's better air.","Thus did Alexander of Macedon become the emperor of the whole world; thus was Hercules possessed of all the mainland, delivering mankind from monsters, oppression, exactions and tyrannies, governing and treating them well, maintaining them in equity and justice, founding for them benign constitutions and laws appropriate to the site of each country, supplying what was lacking, turning to profit whatever was abundant, forgiving the past and casting all previous offences into eternal oblivion: such, after the tyrants were overthrown by the bravery and industry of Thrasybulus, was the ‘amnesty’ of the Athenians which was later expounded in Rome by Cicero and restored under the emperor Aurelian. Those are the love-filters, spells and charms by which one peacefully retains what has been painfully conquered.","After that I went down by the hinder teeth to come to the chaps; but in the way I was robbed by thieves in a great forrest, that is in the territory towards the eares: then (after a little further travelling) I fell upon a pretty petty village, (truly I have forgot the name of it) where I was yet merrier than ever, and got some certain money to live by, can you tell how? by sleeping; for there they hire men by the day to sleep, and they get by it sixpence a day, but they that can snort hard get at least nine pence. How I had been robbed in the valley I informed the Senators, who told me that, in very truth the people of that side were bad livers, and naturally theevish, whereby I perceived well, that as we have with us the Countreys cisalpin and transalpine, that is, behither and beyond the mountains, so have they there the Countreys cidentine and tradentine, that is, behither and beyond the teeth: but it is farre better living on this side, and the aire is purer."

(Rabelais restricts to monks attacks made by many Reformers and evangelicals against priests and monks in general.) The end of the chapter is deeply theological, citing Romans 8:26 to declare monastic intercessions to be irrelevant: ‘The Spirit himself maketh intercessions for us with groanings which cannot he uttered’. On the other hand Frère Jean reduces with his jesting the awe attached to the predestinationalist rigour of Romans 9:23, in which God is likened to a divine Potter who makes out of clay such vessels as he wishes, which have no grounds for complaint.",CHAPTER XL Why Monks are the out-casts of the world? and wherefore some have bigger noses than others?

A long time has passed since you and I swore mutual faith and friendship by Jupiter Philios: now give me your advice. Should I marry or no?’","Your mousing (quoth Panurge) will not make me leave my musing why Folks should be so frumpishly disposed, seeing I am certainly perswaded that some flout, who merit to be flouted at; yet as my Vow imports so will I do.

"Le prisonnier parti, Pantagruel dit à ses gens : « Enfants, j’ai donné à entendre à ce prisonnier que nous avons armée sur mer, ensemble que nous ne leur donnerons l’assaut que jusques à demain sur le midi, à celle fin que eux, doutant[7] la grande venue de gens, cette nuit s’occupent à mettre en ordre et soi remparer ; mais cependant mon intention est que nous chargeons sur eux environ l’heure du premier somme. »","The prisoner gone, Pantagruel said to his people: ""Children, I have given to understand to this prisoner whom we have armed at sea, together that we will not attack them until tomorrow at noon, at that end that they, doubting [7] the great coming of people, this night occupy themselves with putting things in order and repairing themselves; but yet my intention is that we burden them about the hour of the first nap. »","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","The Prisoner being gone, Pantagruel said to his men, Gentlemen, I have made this Prisoner believe that we have an army at sea, as also that we will not assault them till to-morrow at noon, to the end, that they doubting of the great arrival of our men, may spend this night in providing and strengthening themselves, but in the mean time my intention is, that we charge them about the houre of the first sleep."

"« J’ai bien en imagination quelques discours moyennants lesquels nous aurions détermination sur votre perplexité ; mais ils ne me satisfont point apertement[14]. Aucuns[15] Platoniques disent que qui peut voir son genius peut entendre ses destinées. Je ne comprends pas bien leur discipline[16], et ne suis d’avis que y adhérez. Il y a de l’abus beaucoup. J’en ai vu l’expérience en un gentilhomme studieux et curieux on[17] pays d’Estangorre. C’est le point premier.","“I have in my imagination a few speeches by means of which we could resolve your perplexity; but they do not satisfy me bitterly[14]. No[15] Platonics say that who can see his genius can hear his destinies. I do not fully understand their discipline[16], and am of the opinion that adhere to it. There is a lot of abuse. I saw the experience of it in a studious and curious gentleman in the country of Estangorre. This is the first point.","‘I do have in mind certain arguments which could lead us to a resolving of your perplexity, but they fail to satisfy me by their clarity. Some Platonists state that whoever can see his Genius can know his destiny, but I cannot fully understand their doctrine and do not advise you to give it your adherence: a great deal of it is misleading. I have witnessed the experience of an East-Anglian nobleman, both learned and scholarly. ‘That is point number one.","True it is, that in my Brain there are some rowling Fancies, by means whereof somewhat may be pitched upon of a seeming efficacy to the disintangling your mind of those dubious Apprehensions wherewith it is perplexed; but they do not thoroughly satisfie me. Some of the Platonick Sect affirm, that whosoever is able to see his proper Genius, may know his own Destiny. I understand not their Doctrine; nor do I think that you adhere to them; there is a palpable Abuse. I have seen the experience of it in a very curious Gentleman of the Country of Estrangowre. This is one of the Points."
"« Et pensais véritablement en dettes consister la montagne de vertu héroïque décrite par Hésiode, en laquelle je tenais degré premier de ma licence, à laquelle tous humains semblent tirer et aspirer ; mais peu y montent pour la difficulté du chemin, voyant aujourd’hui tout le monde en désir fervent et strident[14] appétit de faire dettes et créditeurs nouveaux. Toutefois, il n’est débiteur qui veut : il ne fait créditeurs qui veut. Et vous me voulez débouter de cette félicité soubeline[15] ? Vous me demandez quand serai hors de dettes ?","“And truly thought in debts to consist the mountain of heroic virtue described by Hesiod, in which I held the first degree of my license, to which all humans seem to aspire and aspire; but few go up there for the difficulty of the way, seeing today everyone in fervent and strident[14] desire to make new debts and creditors. However, there is no debtor who wants: there is no creditor who wants. And you want me to dismiss this soubeline happiness[15]? You ask me when I'll be out of debt?","And I took it for true (once I saw that everybody nowadays has such a fervent, strident longing to make debts and lenders new) that the mountain of the heroic virtues described by Hesiod – I got top marks for him in my degree – consisted of debts, to which all human beings are seen to aim and aspire but few can climb because of the ruggedness of the path. ‘Not all who would can be debtors: not all who would can create lenders. And you want to boot me out of such downy felicity! ‘Worse still: I give myself to bonnie Saint Bobelin if all my life I have not reckoned debts to be, as it were, a connection and colligation between Heaven and Earth (uniquely preserving the lineage of Man without which, I say, all human beings would soon perish) and perhaps to be that great World Soul which, according to the Academics, gives life to all things.","Which Dignity though all Humane Creatures seem to aim at, and aspire thereto, few nevertheless, because of the difficulties in the way, and incumbrances of hard Passages are able to reach it, as is easily perceivable by the ardent desire and vehement longing harboured in the Breast of every one, to be still creating more Debts, and new Creditors. Yet doth it not lie in the power of every one to be a Debtor. To acquire Creditors is not at the Disposure of each Man’s Arbitriment. You nevertheless would deprive me of this sublime Felicity. You ask me when I will be out of Debt."
"Alors Panurge tira deux grandes cordes de la nef, et les attacha au tour qui était sur le tillac et les mit en terre et en fit un long circuit, l’un plus loin, l’autre dedans cetui-là, et dit à Épistémon : « Entrez dedans la navire et quand je vous sonnerai, tournez le tour sur le tillac diligentement, en ramenant à vous ces deux cordes. » Puis dit à Eusthènes et à Carpalim : « Enfants, attendez ici et vous offrez à ces ennemis franchement et obtempérez à eux, et faites semblant de vous rendre ; mais avisez que n’entrez au cerne[4] de ces cordes : retirez-vous toujours hors. » Et incontinent entra dedans la navire, et prit un faix[5] de paille et une botte[6] de poudre de canon et l’épandit par le cerne des cordes, et, avec une migraine[7] de feu, se tint auprès. Soudain arrivèrent à grande force les chevaliers et les premiers choquèrent[8] jusques auprès de la navire, et parce que le rivage glissait, tombèrent eux et leurs chevaux, jusques au nombre de quarante et quatre. Quoi voyants les autres, approchèrent, pensants qu’on leur eût résisté à l’arrivée. Mais Panurge leur dit : « Messieurs, je crois que vous soyez fait mal, pardonnez-le nous, car ce n’est de nous, mais c’est de la lubricité de l’eau de mer, qui est toujours onctueuse. Nous nous rendons à votre bon plaisir. » Autant en dirent ses deux compagnons, et Épistémon qui était sur le tillac. Cependant Panurge s’éloignait, et, voyant que tous étaient dedans le cerne des cordes et que ses deux compagnons s’en étaient éloignés, faisants place à tous ces chevaliers qui à foule allaient pour voir la nef et qui étaient dedans, soudain cria à Épistémon : « Tire, tire. » Lors Épistémon commença tirer au tour, et les deux cordes s’empêtrèrent entre les chevaux et les ruaient[9] par terre bien aisément avec les chevaucheurs ; mais eux, ce voyant, tirèrent à l’épée et les voulaient défaire, dont Panurge met le feu en la traînée et les fit tous là brûler comme âmes damnées : hommes et chevaux, nul n’en échappa, excepté un qui était monté sur un cheval turc, qui le gagna à fuir ; mais quand Carpalim l’aperçut, il courut après en telle hâtiveté et allégresse qu’il l’attrapa en moins de cent pas, et, sautant sur la croupe de son cheval, l’embrassa par derrière et l’amena à la navire.","Then Panurge drew two great ropes from the nave, and tied them to the lathe which was on the deck, and put them in the ground, and made a long circuit of them, one farther, the other in that, and said to Epistemon ""Come inside the ship and when I ring for you, turn the lathe on the deck diligently, bringing these two ropes to you. Then said to Eusthenes and Carpalim: 'Children, wait here and offer yourselves to these enemies frankly and obey them, and pretend to surrender; but advise that do not enter the ring [4] of these ropes: always withdraw outside. And immediately entered into the ship, and took a load[5] of straw and a bundle[6] of gunpowder and spread it through the ring of the ropes, and, with a headache[7] of fire, stood with. Suddenly the knights arrived in great force and the first shocked [8] up to the ship, and because the shore was slipping, they and their horses fell, up to the number of forty and four. What, seeing the others, approached, thinking that they had been resisted on arrival. But Panurge said to them: ""Gentlemen, I believe you have been hurt, forgive us, for it is not ours, but it is the lubricity of sea water, which is always unctuous. We surrender at your pleasure. So said his two companions, and Epistemon, who was on the deck. Meanwhile Panurge moved away, and, seeing that all were inside the circle of ropes and that his two companions had moved away from it, making room for all those knights who were going to see the nave and who were inside, suddenly shouted to Epistemon: “Shoot, shoot. Then Epistemon began to pull round, and the two cords got entangled between the horses and kicked them to the ground quite easily with the riders; but they, this seer, drew with the sword and wanted to defeat them, which Panurge set on fire in the trail and caused them all to burn there as damned souls: men and horses, none escaped, except one who had mounted on a Turkish horse, which persuaded him to flee; but when Carpalim saw him, he ran after him with such haste and glee that he caught him in less than a hundred paces, and, jumping on his horse's hindquarters, embraced him from behind and led him to the ship.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","With this Panurge took two great cables of the ship, and tied them to the kemstock or capstane which was on the deck towards the hatches, and fastened them in the ground, making a long circuit, the one further off, the other within that. Then said he to Epistemon, Go aboard the ship, and, when I give you a call, turn about the capstane upon the orlop diligently, drawing unto you the two cable-ropes: and said to Eusthenes, and to Carpalin, My Bullies, stay you here, and offer your selves freely to your enemies, do as they bid you, and make as if you would yield unto them: but take heed you come not within the compasse of the ropes, be sure to keep your selves free of them; and presently he went aboard the ship, and took a bundle of straw, and a barrel of gun-powder, strowed it round about the compasse of the cordes, and stood by with a brand of fire or match lighted in his hand. Presently came the horsemen with great fury, and the foremost ran almost home to the ship, and by reason of the slipperinesse of the bank, they fell they and their horses, to the number of foure and fourty, which the rest seeing, came on, thinking that resistance had been made them at their arrival. But Panurge said unto them, My Masters, I beleeve that you have hurt your selves , I pray you pardon us, for it is not our fault, but the slipperinesse of the sea-water that is alwayes flowing; we submit our selves to your good pleasure; so said likewise his two other fellowes, and Epistemon that was upon the deck; in the mean time Panurge withdrew himselfe, and seeing that they were all within the compasse of the cables, and that his two companions were retired, making room for all those horses which came in a croud, thronging upon the neck of one another to see the ship and such as were in it, cried out on a sudden to Epistemon, Draw, draw: then began Epistemon to winde about the capstane, by doing whereof the two cables so intangled and impestered the legs of the horses, that they were all of them thrown down to the ground easily, together with their Riders: but they seeing that, drew their swords, and would have cut them: whereupon Panurge set fire to the traine, and there burnt them up all like damned souls, both men and horses, not one escaping save one alone, who being mounted on a fleet Turkie courser, by meere speed in flight got himself out of the circle of the ropes; but when Carpalin perceived him, he ran after him with such nimblenesse and celerity, that he overtook him in lesse than a hundred paces; then leaping close behinde him upon the crupper of his horse, clasped him in his armes, and brought him back to the ship."

"Tant firent et tracassèrent[1], pillant et larronnant, qu’ils arrivèrent à Seuillé, et détroussèrent hommes et femmes, et prirent ce qu’ils purent : rien ne leur fût ni trop chaud ni trop pesant. Combien que la peste y fut par la plus grande part des maisons, ils entraient partout, ravissaient tout ce qu’était dedans, et jamais nul n’en prit danger, qui est cas assez merveilleux, car les curés, vicaires, prêcheurs, médecins, chirurgiens et apothicaires, qui allaient visiter, panser, guérir, prêcher et admonester les malades, étaient tous morts de l’infection, et ces diables pilleurs et meurtriers onques n’y prirent mal. Dont vient cela, messieurs ? Pensez-y, je vous prie.","So much did and bothered[1], looting and robbing, that they arrived at Seuillé, and robbed men and women, and took what they could: nothing was too hot or too heavy for them. As much as the plague was there in most of the houses, they entered everywhere, robbed everything that was inside, and no one ever took any danger, which is a rather marvelous case, because the priests, vicars, preachers, doctors , surgeons and apothecaries, who went to visit, bandage, cure, preach and admonish the sick, had all died of infection, and these plundering and murdering devils never took it badly. Where does this come from, gentlemen? Think about it, please.","He is one of the greatest comic figures of all time. He is also an acted parable preaching active virtue over merely verbal piety: see Chapter 38. After Gargantua he does not come into prominence again until the storm-at-sea in the Fourth Book, where he plays the same role and reference is made back to his defence of the abbey close. The plague kills evangelical preachers and medical men but not the devilish marauders. Why? Because the plague is not sent by God but by devils. (See Chapter 43.) Until ‘42 the timorous monks were clearly chanting ’Impetum inimicorum ne timueritis’ (‘Fear not the assaults of the enemies’). Then their chants become all but incomprehensible: ‘Ini, nim, pe, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, tum, ne, tum, ne, num, num, ini, i, mi, i, mi, co, o, ne, no, o, o, ne, no, ne, no, no, no, rum, ne, num, num’. Such repetitions even more evidently constitute battologia, that ‘vain repetition’ condemned just before the teaching of the Lord’s Prayer in Matthew 6. Rabelais was reinforced in his beliefs here by an adage of Erasmus (II, I, XCII, ‘Battologia, Laconism’). Before ‘42 Rabelais had discovered the Cratylus of Plato, which influenced his attitude to language above all in the Fourth Book but also (as here) in some of his additions and changes elsewhere. ‘Da mihi potum’ (‘Give me a drink’) is a monastic joke, sometimes found written by the tired scribe at the end of a manuscript. It probably echoes Matthew 10:42 (Vulgate). The war is fought over the countryside Rabelais knew as a boy around his home at La Devinière.] So they roamed thus about, thieving and pillaging until they came to Seuilly, where they robbed the men and the women and plundered whatever they could: nothing was too hot nor too heavy. Now although the plague was in most of the houses, they entered them everywhere and plundered everything inside, yet not one of them ever suffered any ill effects; which is a matter of great wonder, since the curates, vicars, preachers, physicians and apothecaries who went to visit, bandage, treat, exhort and admonish the sick all died of the infection whilst those pillaging and murdering devils suffered no harm. How does that come about, Gentlemen? Think about it, I pray you.","So much they did, and so farre they went pillaging and stealing, that at last they came to Sevile, where they robbed both men and women, and took all they could catch: nothing was either too hot or too heavie for them. Although the plague was there in the most part of all the houses, they neverthelesse entered every where; then plundered and carried away all that was within; and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt, which is a most wonderful case. For the Curates, Vicars, Preachers, Physicians, Chirurgions and Apothecaries, who went to visit, to dresse, to cure, to heale, to preach unto, and admonish those that were sick, were all dead of the infection; and these devillish robbers and murtherers caught never any harme at all. Whence comes this to passe, (my masters) I beseech you think upon it?"

For not being able to keep in such Subjection the Saxons, whose Dominion he had joyned to the Empire, but that ever and anon they would break forth into open Rebellion, if he should casually be drawn into Spain, or other remote Kingdoms: He caused them to be brought unto his own Country of Flanders, the Inhabitants whereof did naturally obey him; and transported the Haynaults and Flemens, his ancient loving Subjects, into Saxony, not mistrusting their Loyalty, now that they were transplanted into a strange Land. But it hapned that the Saxons persisted in their Rebellion and primitive Obstinacy; and the Flemins dwelling in Saxony did imbibe the stubborn Manners and Conditions of the Saxons."

Into thy hands I commend…’","others cried, Our Lady of Cunaut, of Loretta, of good tidings on the other side of the water St. Mary over, some vowed a pilgrimage to St. James, and others to the holy handkerchief at Chamberrie, which three moneths after that burnt so well in the fire, that they could not get one thread of it saved: others sent up their vowes to St. Cadouin, others to St. Ihon d’Angelie, and to St. Eutropius of Xaintes: others again invoked St. Mesmes of Chinon, St. Martin of Candes, S. Clouod of Sinays, the holy relicks of Laurezay, with a thousand other jolly little Sancts and Santrels: Some died without speaking, others spoke without dying; some died in speaking, others spoke in dying. Others shouted as loud as they could, Confession, Confession, Confiteor, miserere, in manus; so great was the cry of the wounded, that the Prior of the Abbey with all his Monks came forth, who when they saw these poor wretches so slain amongst the Vines, and wounded to death, confessed some of them: but whilest the Priests were busied in confessing them, the little Monkies ran all to the place where Friar Ihon was, and asked him, wherein he would be pleased to require their assistance?"
"– Si telle est, dit Pantagruel, votre destinée fatale, comme naguère exposait frère Jean, vous devez peur avoir de Pyræis, Héoüs, Æthon, Phlégon, célèbres chevaux du soleil flammivomes[11], qui rendent feu par les narines ; des physétères qui ne jettent qu’eau par les ouïes et par la gueule, ne devez peur aucune avoir. Ja[12] par leur eau ne serez en danger de mort. Par cetui élément plus tôt serez garanti et conservé que fâché ni offensé.","“If such be,” said Pantagruel, “your fatal destiny, as Brother John once explained, you must be afraid of having Pyræis, Héoüs, Æthon, Phlégon, famous flammivorous horses of the sun[11], which give fire through the nostrils; physeteria which only squirt water through the gills and through the mouth, you must not be afraid of having any. Ja[12] by their water will not be in danger of death. By this element sooner will be guaranteed and kept than angry nor offended.","‘If such is your fated destiny as Frère Jean expounded the other day,’ said Pantagruel, ‘you ought to go in fear of Pyroeis, Eous, Aethon and Phlegon (the celebrated flame-vomiting steeds of the Sun which breathe fire from their noses): there is no need for you to feel any fear whatsoever of physeters, which merely spout water through their gills and nostrils. You will never be in danger of death from any water of theirs. By that element you will be protected rather and preserved, not troubled nor attacked.’","If your Destiny be such as Fryar Jhon was saying a while ago (reply’d Pantagruel) you ought to be afraid of Pyrois, Eöus, Æthon, and Phlegon, the Suns Coach-horses that breath Fire at the Nostrils, and not of Physeters that spout nothing but Water at the Snout and Mouth. Their Water will not endanger your Life; and that Element will rather save and preserve, than hurt or endanger you."

"Le propos requiert que racontons ce qu’advint à six pèlerins qui venaient de Saint-Sébastien près de Nantes, et pour soi héberger celle nuit, de peur des ennemis, s’étaient mussés[1] au jardin dessus les poisars[2], entre les choux et laitues. Gargantua se trouva quelque peu altéré, et demanda si l’on pourrait trouver de laitues pour faire salade, et entendant qu’il y en avait des plus belles et grandes du pays, car elles étaient grandes comme pruniers ou noyers, y voulut aller lui-même, et en emporta en sa main ce que bon lui sembla ; ensemble emporta les six pèlerins, lesquels avaient si grand peur qu’ils n’osaient ni parler ni tousser.","The purpose requires that we tell what happened to six pilgrims who came from San Sebastian near Nantes, and to lodge themselves that night, for fear of enemies, had moved[1] to the garden above the poisars[2], between cabbage and lettuce. Gargantua found himself somewhat altered, and asked if lettuces could be found to make salad, and hearing that there were some of the most beautiful and large in the country, for they were as large as plum or walnut trees, wanted to go there. -even, and took in his hand what he saw fit; together took away the six pilgrims, who were so afraid that they dared neither speak nor cough.","CHAPTER 36 [Becomes Chapter 38. Evangelicals and reformers alike disliked pilgrimages, believing them to have been condemned by Saint Paul. The first edition refers in error to ‘five of the prisoners’, instead of ‘five of the pilgrims’. The error, corrected in ‘35, is tacitly corrected here too. Solemn ‘applications’ of Psalms to real contemporary events were much appreciated at the French Court; but Renaissance taste delighted in laughing at matters which were elsewhere taken with the utmost seriousness. The Psalm cited is the 124th (123rd).] Our tale requires that we narrate what befell six pilgrims returning from Saint Sebastian’s near Nantes who, seeking shelter for the night and fearing enemies, hid in the garden upon the pea-stalks between the cabbages and lettuces. Now Gargantua felt rather empty and asked if it were possible to find any lettuces for a salad. On hearing that there were some of the biggest and loveliest in all the land – for they were as large as plum or walnut trees – he was pleased to go himself and bring back in his hands those he liked. With them he carried off the six pilgrims who were so terrified that they dared not speak nor cough.","THE story requireth, that we relate that which happened unto six Pilgrims, who came from Sebastian near to Nantes: and who for shelter that night, being afraid of the enemy, had hid themselves in the garden upon the chichling pease, among the cabbages and lettices. Gargantua finding himself somewhat dry, asked whether they could get any lettice to make him a sallet; and hearing that there were the greatest and fairest in the countrey (for they were as great plum-trees, or as walnut-trees,) he would go thither himself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and withal carried away the six Pilgrims, who were in so great feare, that they did not dare to speak nor cough."

"– Vous voulez inférer, dit frère Jean, que les songes des cocus cornus, comme sera Panurge, Dieu aidant et sa femme, sont toujours vrais et infaillibles. »","“You want to infer,” said Brother Jean, “that the dreams of horned cuckolds, like Panurge, God helping and his wife, are always true and infallible. »","‘You mean to imply,’ said Frere Jean, ‘that the dreams of horn-bearing cuckolds such as Panurge will be – God helping, and his wife – are ever true and infallible.’ Panurge’s dream and its interpretation CHAPTER 14 [It is in Genesis 37:19 that Joseph’s brothers say, ‘Here comes our dreamer’. Renaissance writers never seem to tire of jests about horns (cornes,) and cuckoldry. The unfortunately named Petrus de Cornibus was a don at the Sorbonne. It was a principle going back to Synesius that one should tell one’s dreams to one’s friends and then calmly abide by their interpretations, since such friends should be free from prejudice and emotion and above all from our own self-love, which leads us all too readily to twist divination in our favour. The erudition is all supported by reputable sources. The problem of Panurge is turning into what lawyers called a ‘perplex case’. In such cases the laws are clear but their application to specific circumstances is not. Such legal perplexities can be made worse by the devil and his agents, and, as Saint Paul warns his followers (II Corinthians 11:14) ‘the angel of Satan often transfigures himself into an angel of light’. Panurge’s perplexity is proving a diabolical one. Several adages of Erasmus are concerned with perplexity, including: III, Χ, XXX, ‘Perplexed’; and III, VIII, XL, ‘Perplexed and disturbed in mind’. Several other adages of Erasmus are relevant, including: I, III, LXXIV, ‘To satisfy Momus’; I, I, LX, ‘To annoy hornets’; I, I, LXIV, ‘To disturb the Camarina’, and I, III, XXXVI, ‘έχθϱών αδώϱα δώϱα: enemies’ gifts are no gifts’, which Rabelais cites in Greek, as a common saying, without any concession to his readers. ‘Fiat’,","Your meaning is, and you would thereby infer (quoth Fryar John) that the Dreams of all horned Cuckolds (of which number Panurge, by the help of God, and his future Wife, is without controversie to be one) are always true and infallible."

If I were King of Paris, the devil take me if I wouldn’t set fire to it inside and burn both the Principal and the regents who tolerate such inhuman behaviour before their very eyes.’","The truth was, that Gargantua, in shifting his clothes, and combing his head with a combe, (which was nine hundred foot long of the Jewish Canne-measure, and whereof the teeth were great tusks of Elephants, whole and entire,) he made fall at every rake above seven balls of bullets, at a dozen the ball, that stuck in his haire, at the razing of the Castle of the wood of Vede, which his father Grangousier seeing, thought they had been lice, and said unto him, What, my dear sonne, hast thou brought us thus farre some short-winged hawkes of the Colledge of Mountague? I did not mean that thou shouldest reside there; Then answered Ponocrates, my soveraign Lord, think not that I have placed him in that lowsie Colledge, which they call Montague; I had rather have put him amongst the grave-diggers of Sanct Innocent, so enormous is the cruelty and villany that I have known there; for the Galley-slaves are far better used amongst the Moors and Tartars, the murtherers in the criminal dungeons, yea the very dogs in your house, then are the poor wretched Students in the aforesaid Colledge; and if I were King of Paris, the devil take me if I would not set it on fire, and burne both Principal and Regents, for suffering this inhumanity to be exercised before their eyes: then taking up one of these bullets, he said, These are cannon-shot, which your sonne Gargantua hath lately received by the treachery of your enemies, as he was passing before the Wood of Vede."
"Au cinquième jour, jà[1] commençants tournoyer le pôle peu à peu, nous éloignants de l’équinoxial, découvrîmes un navire marchand faisant voile à horche[2] vers nous. La joie ne fut petite ; tant de nous comme des marchands ; de nous, entendants nouvelle de la marine[3] ; d’eux, entendants nouvelles de terre ferme. Nous ralliants avec eux, connûmes qu’ils étaient Français Saintongeais. Devisant et raisonnant ensemble, Pantagruel entendit qu’ils venaient de Lanternois, dont eut nouveau accroissement d’allégresse. Aussi eut toute l’assemblée, mêmement nous enquêtants de l’état du pays et mœurs du peuple lanternier, et ayants avertissement que, sur la fin de juillet subséquent, était l’assignation du chapitre général des Lanternes, et que, si lors y arrivions, comme facile nous était, verrions belle, honorable et joyeuse compagnie des Lanternes ; et que l’on y faisait grands apprêts, comme si l’on y dût profondément lanterner. Nous fut aussi dit que, passants le grand royaume de Gébarim, nous serions honorifiquement reçus et traités par le roi Ohabé, dominateur d’icelle terré, lequel et tous ses sujets pareillement parlent langage français tourangeau.","On the fifth day, jà[1] beginning to turn the pole little by little, moving away from the equinoctial, discovered a merchant ship making sail with horche[2] towards us. The joy was not small; so many of us as merchants; from us, hearing news from the navy[3]; from them, hearing news from the mainland. We rallying with them, knew that they were French Saintongeais. Chatting and reasoning together, Pantagruel heard that they came from Lanternois, whose joy again increased. Also had the whole assembly, even us inquiring into the state of the country and the manners of the Lantern-making people, and being warned that, on the end of the following July, was the summons of the General Chapter of the Lanterns, and that, if there we arrived, how easy we were, we would see beautiful, honorable and merry company of the Lanterns; and that great preparations were being made there, as if one were to linger deeply there. We were also told that, passing through the great kingdom of Gébarim, we would be honorably received and treated by King Ohabé, ruler of icelle terré, who and all his subjects alike speak Touraine French.","The merchant’s red-coral stump is his penis.] On the fifth day we were already beginning to work our way gradually around the Pole while moving further away from the Equator when we descried a merchantman in full sail off our port bow. There was not a little joy both on our part and on the merchants’: on our part, from hearing news of the sea; on their part, from hearing news of Terra-firma. Drawing alongside, we learnt that they were Frenchmen from Saintonge. When talking and deliberating with them, Pantagruel gathered that they were on the way from Lanternland, at which he felt a fresh access of joy as did all the rest of the company, especially when, after inquiring of the condition of that country and of the mores of the Lanternese people, we were advised that a chapter-general of the Lanterns had been convoked for the end of June, and that if we made harbour there in time (as it was easy to do) we should see a fair, honourable and happy company of Lanterns, and that great preparations were being made as though they were going to thoroughly lantern things up! [We were also told that if we sailed via the great kingdom of Gebarim we would be greeted and honoured by King Ohabe, the ruler of that land, who, together with all of his subjects, speaks the French of Touraine.]12","ON the fifth day we began already to wind by little and little about the Pole, going still farther from the Equinoctial Line, we discovered a Merchant Man to the Windward of us. The Joy for this was not smal on both sides, in hopes to hear News from Sea, and those in the Merchant-Man from Land. So we bore upon ’em, and coming up with them, we Hal’d them, and finding them to be Frenchmen of Xaintonge, back’d our Sails and lay by to talk to them. Pantagruel heard that they came from Lantern-Land, which added to his joy, and that of the whole Fleet. We enquir’d about the State of that Country, and the way of living of the Lanterns; and were told, that about the latter end of the following July, was the time prefix’d for the meeting of the General Chapter of the Lanterns; and that if we arrived there at that time, as we might easily, we should see a Handsom, Honourable, and jolly Company of Lanterns; and that great Preparations were making, as if they intended to Lanternise there to the purpose. We were told also, That if we touch’d at the great Kingdom of Gebarin, we should be Honourably received and Treated by the Sovereign of that Country, King Ohabé, who as well as all his Subjects, speaks Touraine French."

Those in your lands are (as we find noted by one of our ancient decretaline scholiasts) but transump-tions of ours. Moreover, I beg you to spare me no trouble: simply tell me whether you are prepared to fast for those three, lovely little God-given days, to confess and be contrite.’","Ay, Marry, said Homenas; but you never saw these that are Angelically written.

For me; Do not spare me, I do not value the Labour, so I may serve you; do but tell me whether you will be confest, and fast only three short little days of God?"
"Mais Pantagruel, tout le Sénat ensemble, dit : « Messieurs, cependant que le fer est chaud, il le faut battre ; pareillement, devant que nous débaucher[1] davantage, je veux que nous allions prendre d’assaut tout le royaume des Dipsodes. Pourtant, ceux qui avec moi voudront venir, s’apprêtent à demain après boire, car lors je commencerai marcher. Non qu’il me faille gens davantage pour m’aider à le conquêter[2], car autant vaudrait que je le tinsse déjà ; mais je vois que cette ville est tant pleine des habitants qu’ils ne peuvent se tourner par les rues. Donc je les mènerai comme une colonie en Dipsodie, et leur donnerai tout le pays qui est beau, salubre, fructueux et plaisant sur tous les pays du monde, comme plusieurs de vous savent, qui y êtes allés autrefois. Un chacun de vous qui y voudra venir soit prêt comme j’ai dit. » Ce conseil et délibération[3] fut divulgué par la ville, et au lendemain, se trouvèrent en la place devant le palais jusques au nombre de dix-huit cents cinquante et six mille et onze, sans les femmes et petits enfants. Ainsi commencèrent à marcher droit en Dipsodie, en si bon ordre qu’ils ressemblaient ès enfants d’Israël, quand ils partirent d’Égypte pour passer la mer Rouge.","But Pantagruel, all the Senate together, said: “Gentlemen, while the iron is hot, it must be struck; likewise, before we debauchery [1] further, I want us to storm the whole kingdom of Dipsodes. However, those who want to come with me are getting ready for tomorrow after drinking, because then I will begin to walk. Not that I need more people to help me win it, for I might as well have it already; but I see that this city is so full of inhabitants that they cannot turn through the streets. So I will lead them as a colony into Dipsody, and give them all the country which is beautiful, salubrious, fruitful and pleasant over all the countries of the world, as many of you know, who once went there. Each one of you who wants to come be ready as I said. This council and deliberation [3] was divulged by the city, and the next day, there were found in the square in front of the palace up to the number of eighteen hundred and fifty and six thousand and eleven, without the women and small children. Thus began to march straight into Dipsody, in such good order that they looked like the children of Israel, when they set out from Egypt to cross the Red Sea.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","But Pantagruel having assembled the whole Senate, and Common Councel-men of the town, said (My Masters) we must now strike the iron whilest it is hot; it is therefore my will, that before we frolick it any longer, we advise how to assault and take the whole Kingdom of the Dipsodes: to which effect let those that will go with me provide themselves against to-morrow after drinking; for then will I begin to march, not that I need any more men then I have to help me to conquer it; for I could make it as sure that way as if I had it already, but I see this City is so full of inhabitants, that they scarce can turn in the streets; I will, therefore, carry them as a Colonie into Dipsodie, and will give them all that Countrey, which is fair, healthie, fruitful and pleasant, above all other Countreys in the world, as many of you can tell who have been there heretofore, every one of you, therefore that will go along, let him provide himself as I have said. This counsel and resolution being published in the City, the next morning there assembled in the piazza, before the Palace, to the number of eighteen hundred fifty six thousand and eleven, besides women and little children: thus began they to march straight into Dipsodie, in such good order as did the people of Israel, when they departed out of Egypt, to passe over the red-sea."

In summer, in lieu of the gowns they would on occasions wear loose robes decorated as above or else sleeveless Moorish jackets of violet velvet with gold fringes over silver braid or with girdles of gold, garnished at the seams with little Indic pearls.

"Panurge sonna, et soudain accoururent ces oiseaux enfumés, et chantaient ensemblement ; mais ils avaient les voix rauques et malplaisantes. Aussi nous remontra Æditue qu’ils ne vivaient que de poisson, comme les hérons et cormorans du monde, et que c’était une quinte espèce de cagaux imprimés nouvellement. Ajouta davantage qu’il avait eu avertissement par Robert Valbringue, qui par là naguère était passé en revenant du pays d’Afrique, que bientôt y devait avoler[10] une sexte espèce, lesquels il nommait capucingaux, plus tristes, plus maniaques et plus fâcheux qu’espèce qui fût en toute l’île. « Afrique, dit Pantagruel, est coutumière toujours choses produire nouvelles et monstrueuses. »","Panurge rang, and suddenly these smoky birds came running up, and sang together; but they had hoarse and unpleasant voices. Also Æditue showed us that they lived only on fish, like the herons and cormorants of the world, and that it was a fifth species of newly printed cagaux. He further added that he had been warned by Robert Valbringue, who had recently passed through there on his way back from the country of Africa, that soon there was to fly [10] a sext species, which he called capucingales, sadder, more maniacal and more annoying that species that was in all the island. “Africa, says Pantagruel, is customary always to produce new and monstrous things. »","And when Panurge struck it, those smoke-cured birds did come charging up at once, and they all chanted together, but their voices were raucous and nasty. The Aedituus explained that they lived on nothing but fish, as herons and cormorants do in the outside world, and that they were a fifth species of Bigot-tails, newly minted. He further added that he had been warned by Robert Valbringue (who had recently called in on the way back from Africa) that there was a sixth species due to land, which he called Capuchinogoths, glummer, madder and more provoking than any species found on that isle. ‘Africa,’ said Pantagruel, ‘is always bringing forth things new and monstrous.’ How the Birds of Ringing Island were all birds of passage","With this Panurge hang’d himself (by the hands, I mean) at the Bell-Rope’s end, and no sooner made it speak, but those smoak’d Birds hy’d them thither, and began to lift up their Voices, and make a sort of an untowardly hoarse noise, which I grudge to call singing. Ædituus indeed told us, that they fed on nothing but Fish, like the Herns and Cormorants of the World, and that they were a fifth kind of Cucullati newly stamp’d. He added, That he had been told by Robert Valbringue, who lately pass’d that way in his Return from Africa, that a sixth kind was to fly hither out of hand, which he call’d Capushawks, more grum, vinegar-fac’d, brainsick, froward, and loathsome, than any kind whatsoever in the whole Island. Africa, said Pantagruel, still uses to produce some new and monstrous Thing."
"Alors furent les tables levées.

Pantagruel gave the guests precious and honorable gifts of rings, jewels and plate, both gold and silver, and, having [36] thanked them cordially, retired to his room.","And so the cloths were removed.

"– La raison, dit notre préclare[20] lanterne, était mystique. Car y passant aurait le vin, ce sont les raisins, au-dessus de la tête, et semblerait être comme maîtrisée et dominée du vin, pour signifier que les pontifes et tous personnages, qui s’adonnent et dédient[21] à contemplation des choses divines, doivent en tranquillité leurs esprits maintenir hors toute pertubation de sens, laquelle plus est manifestée en ivrognerie qu’en autre passion, quelle que soit.","“The reason,” said our preclare[20] lantern, “was mystical. Because passers-by would have the wine, these are the grapes, above the head, and would seem to be mastered and dominated by the wine, to signify that the pontiffs and all characters, who devote themselves and dedicate[21] to the contemplation of things divine, must in tranquility their minds keep out all pertubation of sense, which is more manifested in drunkenness than in any other passion whatever.","‘There was a mystical reason for that,’ said our shining Lantern. For in going under it he would have had the wine – the grapes, that is – above his head, which would then appear subordinated and dominated by wine: meaning that pontiffs and all great persons who are devoted and dedicated to the contemplation of things divine must maintain their minds in tranquillity, beyond all sensual perturbations, which are more manifested in drunkenness than in any other passion there is.","There was a Mystical Reason, answer’d our most perspicuous Lantern, that would have hinder’d her. For had she gone under it, the Wine, or the Grapes of which ’tis made, that’s the same thing, had been over her head, and then she would have seem’d overtopt and master’d by Wine. Which implies, that Priests, and all Persons who devote themselves to the Contemplation of Divine Things, ought to keep their Minds sedate and calm, and avoid whatever might disturb and discompose their Tranquility; which nothing is more apt to do than Drunkenness."

Ici de même, buvants de cette liqueur mirifique, sentirez goût de tel vin comme l’aurez imaginé. Or, imaginez et buvez. » Ce que nous fîmes.

Here too, drinking this wonderful liquor, you will taste such wine as you imagined. Now, imagine and drink. » Which we did. Then exclaimed Panurge, saying: ""By God, this is Beaune wine, better than I ever drank, or I give myself to ninety and sixteen devils."" O for a longer taste, who would have his neck three cubits long, as Philoxenus desired, or like a crane, as Melanthius desired!","And so there were brought in lovely, fat, happy hams, lovely, fat, happy smoked ox-tongues, lovely, tasty salted meats, saveloys and botargos, lovely, tasty venison sausages and other such chimney-sweepers of the gullet. At her command we ate until we had to admit that our stomachs had been well and truly scoured clean by a thirst which had quite dreadfully plagued us. At which she said to us: ‘Once a learned and chivalrous Jewish captain was leading through the desert his people, who were extenuated by hunger; from the heavens he obtained manna, the taste of which appeared to their minds as that of viands they had once actually eaten. So too here: when drinking from this miracle-working liquor you will experience the taste of whatever wine you have in mind. Bring your mind to it, and drink!’39 Which we did. Panurge then exclaimed, ‘This, by God, is wine from Beaune, better than any I have ever yet drunk, or else I shall give myself to ninety devils plus sixteen more. O! If only we could have a gullet three cubits in length so as to prolong the taste, as Philoxenus desired, or one like a crane’s, as Melanthius wished!’40","They brought immediately some stately, swindging, jolly Hams; fine, substantial Neatstongues, good Hungbeef, pure and delicate, Botargos, Venison, Sawcidges, and such other Gulletsweepers. And to comply with her Invitation, we crammed and twisted till we own’d our selves thoroughly cured of Thirst, which before did damnably plague us. We are told, continu’d she, that formerly a Learned and Valiant Hebrew Chief, leading his People through Deserts, where they were in hopes of being famish’d, obtain’d of God some Manna, whose taste was to them, by imagination, such as that of Meat was to them before in reality: Thus, drinking of this miraculous Liquor you’ll find it taste like any Wine that you shall fancy you drink. Come then, fancy, and drink. We did so, and Panurge had no sooner whipp’d off his Brimmer, but he cry’d, By Noah’s Openshop, ’tis Vin de Beaulne, better than ever was yet tipp’d over Tongue, or may Ninety six Devils swallow me.

Pourtant[2] encore est le proverbe en usage de bailler le moine à quelqu’un.","This skirmish completed, Gargantua withdrew with his people, except the monk, and at daybreak went to Grandgousier, who in his bed prayed to God for their salvation and victory, and seeing them all safe and whole, embraced them heartily. love, and asked news of the monk. But Gargantua replied that no doubt their enemies had the monk: “They will have, said Grandgousier, therefore maie contre [1],” which had been very true. However[2] still is the proverb in use to yawn the monk to someone.","Perhaps the harshest of the scriptural expressions hurled at a religious enemy in Rabelais’ time was ‘false prophet’, which carried with it the condemnation of Jesus himself (as in Matthew 7:15; 24:11) and of all four Evangelists. Saint Paul allegedly condemns pilgrimages when he urges Christian men to look after ‘the household of faith’, taken to mean their families (I Timothy 5:8, and Galatians 6:10). It is the king himself, not a cleric of any kind, who decides to drive off the ‘black-beetles’ – those hypocrites who are classed with the ‘false prophets’ who can deceive the very Elect (as in Matthew 24:24). In so doing he is exercising the right of the Christian Magistrate to suppress blasphemy. It is also in Matthew (10:28) that we are told not to fear ‘them who kill the body’ but them who are able ‘to destroy both soul and body’. Plato’s praise of the philosopher king was well known from an adage of Erasmus (I, III, I, ‘Either a fool or a king should be born.’).] That skirmish once over, Gargantua withdrew with his men except for the Monk and, as dawn broke, called on Grandgousier, who was in bed praying God for their security and victory. On seeing them safe and sound, Grandgousier embraced them with true affection and asked for news of the Monk. Gargantua replied that, without any doubt, the foe had been landed with the Monk. ‘They’re in for a bad time then,’ said Grandgousier. And that had already been proven true. Hence the saying (still current), To land somebody with the Monk.","THIS skirmish being ended, Gargantua retreated with his men, excepting the Monk, and about the dawning of the day they came unto Grangousier, who in his bed was praying unto God for their safety and victory: and seeing them all safe and sound, he embraced them lovingly, and asked what was become of the Monk? Gargantua answered him, that without doubt the enemies had the Monk. Then have they mischief and ill luck (said Grangousier)"

"Gargantua, venu à l’endroit du bois de Vède, fut avisé par Eudémon que dedans le château était quelque reste des ennemis ; pour laquelle chose savoir Gargantua s’écria tant qu’il put : « Êtes-vous là, ou n’y êtes pas ? Si vous y êtes, n’y soyez plus ; si n’y êtes, je n’ai que dire. » Mais un ribaud[4] canonnier, qui était au mâchicoulis, lui tira un coup de canon et l’atteint par la temple[5] dextre furieusement ; toutefois ne lui fit pour ce mal en plus que s’il lui eût jeté une prune : « Qu’est-ce là, dit Gargantua ; nous jetez-vous ici des grains de raisins ? La vendange vous coûtera cher ! » pensant de vrai que le boulet fut un grain de raisin. Ceux qui étaient dedans le château, amusés à la pille[6], entendants le bruit, coururent aux tours et forteresses, et lui tirèrent plus de neuf mille vingt et cinq coups de fauconneaux et arquebuses, visants tous à sa tête, et si menu tiraient contre lui qu’il s’écria : « Ponocrates, mon ami, ces mouches ici m’aveuglent ; baillez moi quelque rameau de ces saules pour les chasser, » pensant, des plombées[7] et pierres d’artillerie, que fussent mouches bovines. Ponocrates l’avisa que n’étaient autres mouches que les coups d’artillerie que l’on tirait du château. Alors choqua de son grand arbre contre le château, et à grands coups abattit et .tours et forteresses, et ruina tout par terre. Par ce moyen furent tous rompus et mis en pièces ceux qui étaient en icelui.","Gargantua, coming to the place of the wood of Vède, was advised by Eudémon that inside the castle was some remains of the enemies; for which thing to know Gargantua cried as much as he could: ""Are you there, or are you not? If you are there, be there no longer; if not, I have only to say. But a ribald[4] gunner, who was in the machicolation, fired a cannon shot at him and furiously hit him by the dexter[5] temple; however, did him no more for this evil than if he had thrown a plum at him. are you throwing grapes at us here? The harvest will cost you dearly! realizing that the ball was a grape. Those who were inside the castle, amused at the pillage[6], hearing the noise, ran to the towers and fortresses, and fired at him more than nine thousand twenty-five shots from hawks and arquebuses, all aimed at his head, and so small fired at him that he exclaimed: “Ponocrates, my friend, these flies here are blinding me; give me some twig of these willows to drive them away, “thinking, lead shot[7] and artillery stones, that were cattle flies. Ponocrates informed him that the only flies were the artillery shots fired from the castle. Then he crashed with his great tree against the castle, and with great blows knocked down both towers and fortresses, and ruined everything on the ground. By this means were all broken and torn to pieces those who were in it.","On arriving at the forest of Vède, Gargantua was warned by Eudemon that remnants of the enemy were still inside the castle, so, to find out, he hollered as loud as he could, ‘Are you there, or not? If you are, be off: if you’re not, I have nothing to add.’ But a renegade gunner up on the parapet fired a shot from his cannon and struck him violently on the right temple: yet it did him no more harm than if he had hurled a plum at him. ‘What is this!’ said Gargantua. ‘Chucking grape-seeds at us, are you!? The vendange will cost you dear.’ (He did indeed think that the round-shot was a grape-seed.) On hearing the noise, those who were delayed in the castle by their pillaging rushed up into the towers and fortifications, shooting over nine thousand and twenty-five rounds from their falconets and harquebuses, all aiming them so thick and fast at Gargantua’s head that he exclaimed, ‘Ponocrates, my friend, the flies here are blinding me : hand me a branch from one of those willows to brush them away’ – thinking, you see, that the lead-shot and stone-shot from the guns were gad-flies. Ponocrates informed him that the only flies about were the gun-shot fired from the castle. So Gargantua battered the towers and fortifications with his big tree, and with many a great blow razed them to the ground. By which means all inside were crushed and smashed into smithereens.","Gargantua being come to the place of the wood of Vede, was informed by Eudemon, that there was some remainder of the enemy within the Castle, which to know, Gargantua cried out as loud as he was able, Are you there, or are you not there? if you be there, be there no more; and if you be not there, I have no more to say. But a ruffian gunner, whose charge was to attend the Portcullis over the gate, let flie a cannon-ball at him, and hit him with that shot most furiously on the right temple of his head, yet did him no more hurt, then if he had but cast a prune or kernel of a wine-grape at him: What is this? (said Gargantua) do you throw at us grape-kernels here? the Vintage shall cost you dear, thinking indeed that the bullet had been the kernel of a grape, or raisin-kernel. Those who were within the Castle, being till then busie at the pillage, when they heard this noise, ran to the towers and fortresses, from whence they shot at him above nine thousand and five and twenty falcon-shot and harcabusades, aiming all at his head, and so thick did they shoot at him, that he cried out, Ponocrates my friend, these flies here are like to put out mine eyes, give me a branch of those willow-trees to drive them away, thinking that the bullets and stones shot out of the great ordnance had been but dunflies. Ponocrates looked and saw that there were no other flies, but great shot which they had shot from the Castle. Then was it that he rusht with his great tree against the Castle, and with mighty blowes overthrew both towers and fortresses, and laid all level with the ground, by which meanes all that were within were slaine and broken in pieces. Going from thence, they came to the bridge at the Mill, where they found all the Ford covered with dead bodies, so thick, that they had choaked up the Mill, and stopped the current of its water, and these were those that were destroyed in the Urinal deluge of the Mare."

De mode qu’elle lui cobbit[18] toute la tête, si que la cervelle en tomba près la croix hosannière[19], puis les bras en pièces, l’un ça, l’autre là, les jambes de même ; puis des boyaux fit un long carnage, en sorte que la poultre au couvent arrivant de lui ne portait que le pied droit et soulier entortillé.","""The hen, terrified, began to trot, farts, leaps and gallops, kicks, shudders[13], double pedals[14] and backfires, as long as she kicks[15] down Tappecoue, although he stood at dawn[16] from the packsaddle with all his might. His stirrup leathers were of cords on the side outside the mount, his fenestrated shoe[17] was so twisted that he could never pull it out. So was dragged frightened by the hen, ever multiplying kicks against him, and misguided with fear through the hedges, bushes and ditches. In such a way that she covered his whole head[18], so that his brains fell near the hosannière[19] cross, then his arms in pieces, one that, the other there, the legs the same; then the bowels made a long carnage, so that the poultre at the convent arriving from him wore only the right foot and twisted shoe.","‘Foal was quite terrified; she proceeded to trot and fart and bound and gallop, lashing out, bucking about and kicking out with her heels while letting off a great volley of farts, so much so that she threw Tappecoue, who nevertheless clung on to the pommel of the saddle with ah his might. Now his stirrups were made of plaited cord, and one of his open-work sandals got so tangled up in the off-side stirrup that he could not tug it free. And thus was he dragged behind, skinning his bum, while the terrified Foal doubled and redoubled her kicks as she took the wrong track through hedge, bush and ditch so that she battered in his entire skull: his brains fell out near the Hosanna Cross, followed by his shattered arms, one here, one there, and likewise his legs; then she made a long fleshy trail of his guts, with the result that when Foal arrived at the convent all she bore of him was his right foot entangled in its sandal.","The Filly was soon scar’d out of her seven Senses, and began to start, to funk it, to squirt it, to trot it, to fart it, to bound it, to gallop it, to kick it, to spurn it, to calcitrate it, to winse it, to frisk it, to leap it, to curvet it, with double Jirks, and bummotions; in so much that she threw down Tickletoby, tho’ he held fast by the Tree of the Pack-Saddle with might and main: now his Traps and Stirrups were of Cord, and on the right side, his Sandal was so entangled and twisted, that he could not for the Hearts blood of him get out his foot. Thus he was dragg’d about by the Filly through the Road, scratching his bare Breech all the way, she still multiplying her kicks against him and straying for fear, over Hedge and Ditch; in so much that she trepann’d his thick Skull so, that his Cockle Brains were dash’d out near the Osanna or High Cross. Then his Arms fell to pieces, one this way and t’ other that way, and even so were his Legs serv’d at the same time: Then she made a bloody havock with his Puddings, and being got to the Convent, brought back only his right Foot and twisted Sandal, leaving them to guess what was become of the rest."
"Adonc le prisonnier le supplia à jointes mains qu’à l’heure de sa bataille il eût de lui pitié, dont lui dit Pantagruel : « Après que tu auras le tout annoncé à ton roi, mets tout ton espoir en Dieu, et il ne te délaissera point, car de moi, encore que sois puissant, comme tu peux voir, et aie gens infinis en armes, toutefois je n’espère en ma force ni en mon industrie, mais toute ma fiance[4] est en Dieu mon protecteur, lequel jamais ne délaisse ceux qui en lui ont mis leur espoir et pensée. »","So the prisoner begged him with clasped hands that at the hour of his battle he would have mercy on him, of which Pantagruel said to him: ""After you have announced everything to your king, put all your hope in God, and he will not will not forsake you, for of me, though mighty, as you can see, and have infinite men in arms, yet I do not hope in my strength nor in my industry, but all my trust[4] is in God my protector , which never forsakes those who put their hope and thought in him. »","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Come, my lads, let us be gone, we have stayed here too long about our victuals; for very seldom doth it fall out, that the greatest eaters do the most martial exploits , there is no shadow like that of flying colours, no smoke like that of horses, no clattering like that of armour: at this Epistemon began to smile, and said, There is no shadow like that of the kitchin, no smoke like that of the pasties, and no clattering like that of goblets: unto which answered Panurge, There is no shadow like that of courtaines, no smoke like that of womens breasts, and no clattering like that of ballocks: then forthwith rising up he gave a fart, a leap, and a whistle, and most joyfully cried out aloud, Ever live Pantagruel: when Pantagruel saw that, he would have done as much; but with the fart that he let, the earth trembled nine leagues about, wherewith and with the corrupted aire, he begot about three and fifty thousand little men, ill favoured dwarfes, and with one fisg that he let, he made as many little women, crouching down, as you shall see in divers places, which never grow but like Cowes tailes downwards, or like the Limosin radishes, round. How now (said Panurge) are your farts so fertile and fruitful? by G— here be brave farted men, and fisgued women, let them be married together, they will beget fine hornets and dorflies; so did Pantagruel, and called them Pygmies; those he sent to live in an island thereby, where since that time they are increased mightily: but the cranes make warre with them continually, against which they do most couragiously defend themselves; for these little ends of men and dandiprats (whom in Scotland they call whiphandles, and knots of a tarre-barrel) are commonly very teastie and cholerick: the Physical reason whereof is, because their heart is near their spleen. At this same time, Panurge took two drinking glasses that were there, both of one bignesse, and filled them with water up to the brim, and set one of them upon one stool, and the other upon another, placing them about five foot from one another: then he took the staffe of a javelin, about five foot and a half long, and put it upon the two glasses, so that the two ends of the staffe did come just to the brims of the glasses: This done, he took a great stake or billet of wood, and said to Pantagruel, and to the rest: My Masters, behold, how easily we shall have the victory over our enemies; for just as I shall break this staffe here upon these glasses, without either breaking or crazing of them, nay, which is more, without spilling one drop of the water that is within them, even so shall we break the heads of our Dipsodes, without receiving any of us any wound or losse in our person or goods: but that you may not think there is any witchcraft in this, hold (said he to Eusthenes) strike upon the midst as hard as thou canst with this log: Eusthenes did so, and the staffe broke in two pieces, and not one drop of the water fell out of the glasses : Then said he, I know a great many such other tricks, let us now therefore march boldly, and with assurance. CHAPTER XXVIII How Pantagruel got the victory very strangely over the Dipsodes and the Giants. AFTER all this talk, Pantagruel took the prisoner to him, and sent him away, saying, Go thou unto thy King in his Camp, and tell him tidings of what thou hast seen, and let him resolve to feast me to morrow about noon; for assoon as my galleys shall come, which will be to-morrow at furthest; I will prove unto him by eighteen hundred thousand fighting men, and seven thousand Giants, all of them greater than I am; that he hath done foolishly and against reason, thus to invade my countrey, wherein Pantagruel feigned that he had an army at sea; but the Prisoner answered, that he would yield himself to be his slave, and that he was content never to return to his own people, but rather with Pantagruel to fight against them, and for Gods sake besought him, that he might be permitted so to do: whereunto Pantagruel would not give consent, but commanded him to depart thence speedily, and be gone as he had told him, and to that effect gave him a box full of Euphorbium, together with some grains of the black chameleon thistle, steeped into aqua vitœ, and made up into the condiment of a wet sucket, commanding him to carry it to his King, and to say unto him, that if he were able to eate one ounce of that without drinking after it, he might then be able to resist him, without any feare or apprehension of danger. The Prisoner then besought him with joynt hands, that in the houre of the battel he would have compassion upon him: whereat Pantagruel said unto him, After that thou hast delivered all unto the King, put thy whole confidence in God, and he will not forsake thee; because, although for my part I be mighty, as thou mayest see, and have an infinite number of men in armes, I do neverthelesse trust neither in my force nor in mine industry, but all my confidence is in God my Protectour, who doth never forsake those that in him do put their trust and confidence."

"– Tout bien de vous, répondit frère Jean. Je n’ai rien trouvé mauvais, sinon qu’il me semble qu’ainsi comme jadis on soulait[10] en guerre, au jour de bataille ou assaut, promettre aux soudards double paie pour celui jour (s’ils gagnaient la bataille, l’on avait prou[11] de quoi payer ; s’ils la perdaient c’eût été honte la demander, comme firent les fuyards Gruyers[12], après la bataille de Cérizolles) aussi qu’enfin vous deviez le paiement réserver, l’argent vous demeurât en bourse.","""All the best of you,"" replied Brother Jean.

The money would have stayed in your parse.’","thou of it, Fryar Jhon, hah? Rarely perform’d, answer’d Fryar Jhon, only methinks that as formerly in War on the Day of Battle, a double Pay was commonly promis’d the Soldiers for that Day; for if they overcame, there was enough to pay them; and if they lost, it would have been shameful for them to demand it, as the cowardly Foresters did after the Battle of Cerizoles: Likewise, my Friend, you ought not to have paid your Man, and the Mony had been sav’d."
"9. Comment Pantagruel remontre à Panurge difficile chose être le conseil de mariage, et des sorts homériques et virgiliens","9. How Pantagruel Remonstrates to Panurge Difficult Thing Be Marriage Counsel, and Homeric and Virgilian Spells","CHAPTER 10 [The erudition displayed in this chapter and the quotations – including the additions of 1552 – derive from a treatise, On Nobility by André Tiraqueau, the legal authority who had been a friend of Rabelais from his early days as a Franciscan at Fontenay-le-Comte. Rabelais must have read the treatise in manuscript, since the work was not printed until 1549. His reading of Cardano’s On Wisdom would further have reinforced his respect for Homeric and Virgilian lots. The final example, that of Fierre Amy, a very learned Franciscan, a contemporary of Rabelais in the same convent, shows that such lots kept their validity in the time of Rabelais. ‘Cowled Hobgoblins’ (Farfadets) is a harsh name for the Franciscans. Most of the original readers of the Third Book could not have managed Greek script let alone Greek verse: the presence of the Greek verse, in Greek script, forms a strong claim by Rabelais to be taken as erudite. The translations which here follow the Greek and Latin verse do not directly render the original Greek and Latin but retranslate the looser versions which Rabelais provides in French.",CHAPTER X How Pantagruel representeth unto Panurge the difficulty of giving Advice in the matter of Marriage; and to that purpose mentioneth somewhat of the Homerick and Virgilian Lotteries.

I can’t tell which to hold on to.’","YOUR Counsel (quoth Panurge) under your Correction and Favour, seemeth unto me not unlike to the Song of Gammer Yeabynay; it is full of Sarcasms, Mockqueries, bitter Taunts, nipping Bobs, derisive Quips, biting Jerks, and contradictory Iterations, the one part destroying the other.

Then in the first collision we serpa[26] of the arenas with great ease, and not without excitement[27].

In her virile age, married Gargamelle, daughter of the King of the Parpaillos, handsome[5] and good-looking, and the two of them often made the two-backed beast together, happily rubbing their fat, as long as she got pregnant with a beautiful son, and bore him until the eleventh month.","In his day Grandgousier was a jolly good fellow who loved to drink neat as well as any man then in the world. And he enjoyed eating salty things. To that end he normally kept an ample store of Westphalian and Bayonne hams, plenty of smoked tongue, an abundance of eels in season, beef cured in salt and mustard, supplies of mullet-caviar, a provision of sausages – though never those from Bologna, for he redoubted the ‘poisoned morsels’ of Lombardy – but always from Bigorre, Longaulnay, La Brène and Rouergue. In his maturity he wedded Gargamelle, the daughter of the King of the Parpaillons, a fine filly with a goodly mug, and they so often played the two-backed beast together, happily stroking their bacon, that she became big of a fine son whom she bore up to the eleventh month.","GRANGOUSIER was a good fellow in his time, and notable jester; he loved to drink neat, as much as any man that then was in the world, and would willingly eate salt meat: to this intent he was ordinarily well furnished with gammons of Bacon, both of Westphalia, Mayence and Bayone; with store of dried Neats tongues, plenty of Links, Chitterlings and Puddings in their season; together with salt Beef and mustard, a good deale of hard rows of powdered mullet called Botargos, great provision of Sauciges, not of Bolonia (for he feared the Lombard boccone) but of Bigorre, Longaulnay, Brene, and Rouargue.

But just as we chose the very cream of wisdom for our advice, I would like this consultation to be presided over by one who is a fool to the sovereign degree.’","BY my Soul, (quoth Panurge) that Overture pleaseth me exceedingly well; I will therefore lay hold thereon, and embrace it. At the very motioning thereof my very Right Entral seemeth to be widened and enlarged, which was but just now hard bound, contracted and costive: but as we have hitherto made choice of the purest and most refined Cream of Wisdom and Sapience for our Counsel, so would I now have to preside and bear the prime Sway in our Consultation as were a Fool in the supreme degree."

"Lors que considérions cette admirable et nouvelle structure d’Orgues, par ses abstracteurs, spodizateurs[6], massitères[7], et autres siens officiers furent les lépreux introduits. Elle leur sonna une chanson, je ne sais quelle : soudain furent et parfaitement guéris. Puis furent introduits ’ les empoisonnés : elle leur sonna une autre chanson, et gens debout. Puis les aveugles, les Sourds, les muets, leur appliquant de même. Ce qui nous épouvanta, non à tort, et tombâmes en terre, nous prosternants comme gens extatiques et ravis en contemplation excessive et admiration des vertus qu’avons vu procéder de la dame, et fut en notre pouvoir mot aucun dire. Ainsi restions en terre, quand elle, touchant Pantagruel d’un beau bouquet de rose franche, lequel elle tenait en main, nous restitua le sens, et fit tenir en pieds.

She sounded a song for them, I don't know what: they were suddenly and completely healed. Then the poisoned ones were introduced: she sounded another song for them, and people stood up. Then the blind, the Deaf, the mute, applying the same to them. Which terrified us, not unjustly, and we fell to the ground, prostrating ourselves as people ecstatic and delighted in excessive contemplation and admiration of the virtues which we saw proceeding from the lady, and was in our power no word to say. So we remained in the ground, when she, touching Pantagruel with a beautiful bouquet of frank roses, which she held in her hand, restored our senses, and made us stand on our feet. Then tells us in Byssinian words[8], such as Parysatis wanted to be uttered speaking to Cyrus his son, or at least Armoisi taffeta[9]:","While we were contemplating the wonderful and novel way in which that organ was built, there were brought to her (by her abstractors, spodizators, malax-ators, tasters, tabachins, chachanins, neemanins, rabrebans, nereins, rozuins, nedibins, nearins, segamions, perazons, chesi-nins, sarins, sotrins, aboth, enilins, archasdarpenins, mebins, giborins and other of her officers) the lepers. She played them I-know-not-what song and they were all at once perfectly cured. Then there were brought in those who had been poisoned: she sang them a different song: and they were on their feet! Then came the blind, the deaf and the mute who were similarly treated. We were astounded, and rightly so; we fell to the ground, prostrating ourselves as men caught up in ecstasy, as men enraptured in mind-departing contemplation and wonder at the powers which we had seen proceeding from that dame. We found it impossible to utter a word, so we remained thus on the floor until she, touching Pantagruel with a bouquet of species-roses held in her hand, restored us to our senses and set us back on our feet. She then addressed us in words of fine linen such as Parysitis desired to be uttered when addressing Cyrus her son, or at the very least in words of armozean taffeta.","Sdeath, what more have Kings and Princes? * * * * August.

True, said Pantagruel, yet Lent and March always go together; and the first was instituted to macerate and bring down our pamper’d Flesh, to weaken and subdue its Lusts, and curb and asswage the Venereal rage.

"Leur chemin fut de trois journées. La troisième, à la croupe d’une montagne, sous un grand et ample châtaigner, leur fut montrée la maison de la vaticinatrice. Sans difficulté ils entrèrent en la case chaumine[1], mal bâtie, mal meublée, toute enfumée : « Baste, dit Épistémon, Héraclitus, grand scotiste[2] et ténébreux philosophe, ne s’étonna entrant en maison semblable, exposant à ses sectateurs et disciples que là aussi bien résidaient les dieux comme en palais plein de délices. Et crois que telle était la case de la tant célébrée Hécale, lorsqu’elle y festoya le jeune Théseus, telle aussi celle de Hireus ou Œnopion, en laquelle Jupiter, Neptune et Mercure ensemble ne prirent à dédain entrer, repaître et loger, en laquelle officialement[3] pour l’écot forgèrent Orion. »","Their journey was three days. The third, on the crupper of a mountain, under a large and ample chestnut tree, was shown to them the house of the vaticinator. Without difficulty, they entered the cottage[1], badly built, badly furnished, all smoky: ""Baste,"" said Epistemon, followers and disciples that there also resided the gods as in a palace full of delights. And believe that such was the hut of the much celebrated Hecale, when she feasted there the young Theseus, such also that of Hireus or Oenopion, in which Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury together did not take disdain to enter, feed and lodge, in which officially[3] for Ecot Forge Orion. »","[In ‘52 the text begins: ‘Their journey took three days. On the third they were shown…’ The Greek epithet applied to Heraclitus, skoteinos (‘obscure’), led to punning condemnations of the obscurity of Duns Scotus. Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury forged Orion by urinating into a chamber-pot. Homer’s ‘old stoker woman’ standing by the fire (Odyssey, XVIII, 27), to whom Ulysses is compared by Irus the beggar, is evoked by Rabelais in Greek, again with no concession whatsoever to his Greek-less reader. (He again had in mind an adage of Erasmus: I, VI, LXXXVI, ‘Poorer than Irus’, where Homer is mentioned. Sibyls were associated with Virgil’s Aeneid, 6, in which we also meet the Golden Bough (136ff., 406ff.). Rabelais’ Sibyl becomes a burlesque figure partly based on that section of Aeneid, 6, as well as on 3, 443–53: 74–6, and, for the Hole of the Sibyl, 6, 9–11.] Their journey took six days. On the seventh they were shown the house of the woman soothsayer set under a large, spreading chestnut-tree on the flank of a mountain. Without difficulty they entered the thatched hovel, which was badly built, badly furnished and all smoky. ‘No matter,’ said Epistemon. ‘When Heraclitus, that great Scotist and opaque philosopher, entered into a similar dwelling he was in no wise put out, explaining to his followers and disciples that the gods could reside there just as easily as in palaces crammed with delights. Such I think was the hovel of [that most-famous Hecate when she entertained young Theseus; such too that of] Hireus (or, Oenopion), where Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury did not disdain to enter, eat and lodge, paying the bill by forging Orion in a chamber-pot.’","THEIR Voyage was three days Journeying, on the third whereof was shewn unto them the House of the Vaticinatress standing on the knap or top of a Hill, under a large and spacious WalnutTree. Without great difficulty they entered into that strawthatch’d Cottage, scurvily built, naughtily movabled, and all besmoaked. It matters not, (quoth Epistemon) Heraclitus the grand Scotist, and tenebrous darksome Philosopher, was nothing astonish’d at his Introit into such a coarse and paultry Habitation; for he did usually shew forth unto his Sectators and Disciples, That the Gods made as cheerfully their Residence in these mean homely Mansions as in sumptuous, magnifick Palaces, replenished with all manner of delight, pomp, and pleasure. I withal do really believe, that the Dwelling-place of the so famous and renowned Hecale, was just such another pretty Cell as this is, when she made a Feast therein to the valiant Theseus. And that of no other better Structure was the Coat or Cabin of Hyreus, or Oenopion, wherein Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury were not ashamed, all three together, to harbour and sojourn a whole Night, and there to take a full and hearty Repast; for the payment of the Shot they thankfully pissed Orion."

It was very necessary that Monsieur le Roi (as they are called Chicanous) should taunt me like this, my good wife of the spine. I don't blame him, however. These are little nuptial caresses. But I clearly see that he quoted me as an angel and daubé as the devil. He gets something or other from Brother Frappart. I drink to him heartily, and to you too, gentlemen of the recors. »","The newly wedded bride laughed as she cried and cried as she laughed because Chicanous had not been satisfied with thumping her indiscriminately on her limbs but had severely ruffled her hair and, what is more, treacherously pubicfumbled-crimpywrinkled her private parts. ‘“The devil,” said Basché,, “has had a part in this. Was it really necessary that this Monsieur In-the-King’s Name (as Chicanous call themselves) should wallop me so on me poor old backbone. I wish him no harm, though. They are little nuptial caresses. But I can clearly see he cited me like an angel and then daubed me like a devil. He has a touch of the knocking friar about him. I drink to him with a very good heart.

"Lorsque approcher les vit Pantagruel, prit Loupgarou par les deux pieds et son corps leva comme une pique en l’air, et, d’icelui armé d’enclumes, frappait parmi ces géants armés de pierres de taille, et les abattait comme un maçon fait de copeaux, que nul n’arrêtait devant lui qu’il ne ruât[27] par terre. Dont, à la rupture de ces harnais[28] pierreux, fut fait un si horrible tumulte qu’il me souvint quand la grosse tour de beurre, qui était à Saint-Étienne de Bourges, fondit au soleil. Panurge, ensemble Carpalim et Eusthènes, cependant égorgetaient ceux qui étaient portés par terre. Faites votre compte qu’il n’en échappa un seul, et à voir Pantagruel, semblait un faucheur qui de sa faux (c’était Loupgarou) abattait l’herbe d’un pré (c’étaient les géants), mais à cette escrime, Loupgarou perdit la tête. Ce fut quand Pantagruel en abattit un qui avait nom Riflandouille, qui était armé à haut appareil, c’était de pierres de grison, dont un éclat coupa la gorge tout outre à Épistémon, car autrement la plupart d’entre eux étaient armés à la légère : c’était de pierres de tuf et les autres de pierre ardoisine. Finalement, voyant que tous étaient morts, jeta le corps de Loupgarou tant qu’il put contre la ville, et tomba comme une grenouille sur ventre en la place mage[29] de ladite ville, et en tombant, du coup tua un chat brûlé, une chatte mouillée, une canepetière et un oison bridé.","When approaching Pantagruel saw them, took Loupgarou by both feet and his body raised like a pike in the air, and, armed with anvils, struck among these giants armed with cut stones, and cut them down like a mason. made of shavings, which no one stopped in front of him without kicking [27] on the ground. Which, at the breaking of these stony harnesses[28], was made such a horrible tumult that I remembered when the big tower of butter, which was at Saint-Étienne de Bourges, melted in the sun. Panurge, together Carpalim and Eusthenes, however, cut the throats of those who were brought to the ground. Make up your mind that not a single one escaped, and to see Pantagruel, looked like a reaper who with his scythe (it was Loupgarou) cut down the grass of a meadow (it was the giants), but at this fencing, Loupgarou lost his mind. It was when Pantagruel shot down one whose name was Riflandouille, who was heavily armed, it was with grison stones, a splinter of which cut Epistemon's throat completely, for otherwise most of them were armed with the sword. light: it was made of tuff stones and the others of slate stone. Finally, seeing that all were dead, threw the body of Wolfgarou as best he could against the city, and fell like a frog on its belly in the place mage [29] of the said city, and falling, suddenly killed a burnt cat , a wet cat, a canepetiere and a bridled gosling.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Fabius, a threader of beads.

"Ainsi commençait escamper[16] de la chambre ; mais la vieille anticipa[17], tenant le fuseau en sa main, et sortit en un courtil près sa maison. Là était un sycomore antique : elle l’écroula[18] par trois fois, et, sur huit feuilles qui en tombèrent, sommairement avec le fuseau écrivit quelques brefs vers. Puis les jeta au vent, et leur dit : « Allez les chercher, si voulez ; trouvez-les, si pouvez. Le sort fatal de votre mariage y est écrit. »","Thus began to escape[16] from the chamber; but the old woman anticipated [17], holding the spindle in her hand, and went out into a court near her house. There was an ancient sycamore tree: she toppled it [18] three times, and, on eight leaves which fell from it, summarily wrote a few short verses with the spindle. Then threw them to the wind, and said to them: “Go and fetch them, if you like; find them, if possible. The fatal fate of your marriage is written there. »","At which he started to scamper out of the room, but the old woman forestalled him, holding the spindle in her hand and going out into the backyard by her hovel where grew an ancient sycamore-tree. She shook it thrice; on eight of the leaves which tumbled down she briefly scribbled with her spindle a few short lines of verse. She then tossed them to the winds and said to Panurge, ‘Go and seek them if you wish; find them if you can: the fated lot of your marriage is written on them.’","With this, as he endeavoured to make an escape out of the room, the old Crone did anticipate his flight, and make him stop; The way how she prevented him was this: whilst in her hand she held the Spindle, she flung out to a Back-yard close by her Lodge, where after she had peeled off the Barks of an old Sycamore three several times, she very summarily, upon eight Leaves which dropt from thence, wrote with the spindle-point some curt, and briefly couched Verses, which she threw into the Air, then said unto them, Search after them if you will; find them if you can; the fatal Destinies of your Marriage written in them."

Coming more[13] here, this vague light touching on the polish of the marble, with which the whole interior of the temple was encrusted, appeared such colors as we see in the celestial arc when the bright sun touches the rainy clouds.","It was hard to look at it fixedly and constantly (just as you cannot look at the body of the sun) since the matter was so astonishingly translucent and the work so finely wrought and diaphanous that the various colours inherent in the precious stones of the little lamps set above were reflected in the greater lamp set below, so that the light of those four lamps spread flickering and shimmering all over the temple. And when that roving light struck against the polished surface of the marble which lined the inside of the Temple, there appeared all the colours of the rainbow, as when the bright sun strikes the rain-clouds.","This made all its spherical body seem to burn and be in a Flame, because the Fire was just at the Centre and middle Point: so that it was not more easie to fix the Eye on it, than on the Disque of the Sun; the matter being wonderfully bright and shining, and the Work most transparent and dazzling, by the Reflection of the various Colours of the precious Stones, whereof the four small Lamps above the main Lamp were made, and their Lustre was still variously glittering all over the Temple. Then this wandring Light being darted on the polish’d Marble and Agath with which all the inside of the Temple was pargetted, our Eyes were entertain’d with a sight of all the admirable Colours which the Rain-bow can boast, when the Sun darts his fiery Rays on some dropping Clouds."

Well come on, in the name of God, a penny neither more nor less.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","I am no great pardon-taker in this world; if I shall be any such in the other, I cannot tell; yet let us go in Gods name , it is but one farthing more or lesse."
"Sur l’instant nous descendîmes au port d’une île laquelle on nommait l’île des Macréons. Les bonnes gens du lieu nous reçurent honorablement. Un vieil Macrobe (ainsi nommaient-ils leur maître échevin) voulait mener Pantagruel en la maison commune de la ville, pour soi rafraîchir à son aise et prendre sa réfection ; mais il ne voulut partir du môle que tous ses gens ne fussent en terre. Après les avoir reconnus, commanda chacun être mué de vêtements et toutes les munitions des nefs être en terre exposées, à ce que[1] toutes les chiourmes[2] fissent chère lie. Ce que fut incontinent fait. Et Dieu sait comment il y eut bu et gallé[3] ! Tout le peuple du lieu apportait vivres en abondance. Les Pantagruélistes leur en donnaient davantage. Vrai est que leurs provisions étaient aucunement endommagées par la tempête précédente. Le repas fini, Pantagruel pria un chacun soi mettre en office et devoir pour réparer le bris. Ce que firent et de bon hait[4]. La réparation leur était facile, parce que tout le peuple de l’île étaient charpentiers et tous artisans tels que voyez en l’arsenal de Venise. Et l’île grande seulement était habitée en trois ports et dix paroisses : le reste était bois de haute futaie et désert, comme si fût la forêt d’Ardenne.","We immediately landed at the port of an island which was called the island of Macreons. The good people of the place received us honorably. An old Macrobi (as they called their master alderman) wanted to take Pantagruel to the common house in the city, to refresh himself at his ease and take his refreshment; but he did not want to leave the mole until all his people were on the ground. After recognizing them, ordered each to be stripped of clothes and all the ammunition of the naves to be exposed in the ground, so that[1] all the crews[2] would do dear dregs. Which was immediately done. And God knows how he had drunk and gallé[3]! All the people of the place brought food in abundance. The Pantagruelists gave them more. True, their provisions were in no way damaged by the previous storm. The meal finished, Pantagruel begged everyone to take up duty and repair the breakage. Which they did and in good faith[4]. The repair was easy for them, because all the people of the island were carpenters and all craftsmen such as see in the arsenal of Venice. And the large island only was inhabited in three ports and ten parishes: the rest was wood of high forest and desert, as if were the forest of the Ardennes.","We at once disembarked at the port of an island which was called the Isle of the Macraeons. The good folk there welcomed us honourably. An ancient Macrobe (such was the title of their chief provost) wanted to bear Pantagruel off to the Town Hall, there to rest at his ease and have something to eat, but Pantagruel refused to leave the jetty before every one of his men had come ashore. After reviewing them, he ordered each of them to change his clothes and the totality of the ship’s victuals to be set out on the quayside so that all the crew could make merry. Which was done at once. And Lord knows how they drank and feasted. All the people of the isle also brought provisions in abundance: the Pantagruelists gave them even more. It is true that their own provisions had been somewhat spoilt during the preceding storm. Once the feast was over Pantagruel told every man to do his task and dutifully repair the damage. Which they all did with a good heart. The task of repair was made easy by the fact that the inhabitants of that island were all carpenters and craftsmen such as can be seen at the Arsenal in Venice; only the largest island was inhabited, and that in three ports and ten parishes: all the rest was given over to tall trees and was as thinly populated as the forest of the Ardennes.","IMMEDIATELY after, we went a shoar at the Port of an Island, which they call’d the Island of the Macreons; the good People of the place receiv’d us very honourably. An old Macrobius (so they call’d their eldest Elderman) desir’d Pantagruel to come to the Town-house to refresh himself, and eat something, but he would not budge a foot, from the Mole, till all his Men were landed. After he had seen them, he gave order they should all change Cloaths, and that some of all the Stores in the Fleet, should be brought on shoar that every ship’s Crew might live well, which was accordingly done; and God wot how they all top’d, and carrouz’d; the People of the Place brought them Provisions in abundance. The Pantagruelists return’d them more: As the truth is, their’s were somewhat damag’d by the late Storm. When they had well stuffed the insides of their Doublets, Pantagruel desired every one to lend their help to repair the damage, which they readily did. It was easy enough to refit there; for all the Inhabitants of the Island were Carpenters, and all such Handicrafts as are seen in the Arsenale at Venice. None but the largest Island was inhabited, having three Ports, and ten Parishes; the rest being over-run with Wood and desert, much like the Forest of Arden."
"– Je te demande, dit Panurge, si, par consentement et convenance de tous les éléments, j’avais sacsacbésevésinemassé[5] ta tant belle, tant avenante, tant honnête, tant prude femme ; de mode que le raide dieu des jardins Priapus, lequel ici habite en liberté, sujétion forcluse[6] de braguettes attachées, lui fût on corps demeuré, en tel désastre que jamais n’en sortirait, éternellement y resterait sinon que tu le tirasses avec les dents, que ferais-tu ?

Would you leave it there forever, or would you pull it out? Answer, O Belinier[7] of Mahomet, since you are of all the devils.","‘What I want to know is this,’ said Panurge: ‘it by the consent and connivance of all the elements I had jiggedy-joggedy-tarty-fartied that O so beautiful, O so comely, O so honourable and O so proper wife of yours in such a manner that the erect god of the gardens Priapus (who dwells herein in freedom, quite exempt from any subjection to codpieces) were, through the malign influence of the stars, to remain eternally stuck inside her so that it could never come out but remain there for ever unless you yourself were to tug it out with your teeth , would you do it?16 Would you leave it there for all eternity or would you tug it out with those splendid teeth of yours? Answer me, you ram-beguiler of Mahomet,17 since you’re of the devils’ tribe.’","I ask thee, by the way of Question, said Panurge to him very seriously, if with the Consent and Countenance of all the Elements, I had Gingumbob’d, Codpiec’d, and Thumpthumpriggledtickledtwidl’d thy so Clever, so Pretty, so Handsom, so Proper, so Neat, so Tight, so Honest, and so Sober Female Importance, insomuch, that the Stiff Deity that has no fore-cast, Priapus, (who dwells here at Liberty, all Subjection of fastened Codpieces or Bolts, Bars, and Locks, Abdicated) remain’d sticking in her natural Christmass-box in such a lamentable manner, that it were never to come out, but Eternally should stick there, unless thou didst pull it out with thy Teeth; what wouldst thou do? Wouldst thou everlastingly leave it there, or wouldst thou pluck it out with thy Grinders? Answer me, O thou Ram of Mahomet, since thou art one of the Devil’s Gang."
"Ce fait, le prisonnier lui requit que, touchant sa rançon, il lui voulût faire parti raisonnable.","This fact, the prisoner requested him that, receiving his ransom, he would want him to do a reasonable thing.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","This done, the Prisoner requested him that he would afford him some reasonable composition for his ransome: to which Pantagruel answered, that his end was not to rob nor ransom men, but to enrich them, and reduce them to total liberty; Go thy way (said he) in the peace of the living God, and never follow evil company, lest some mischief befall thee."
20. Comment Panurge prend conseil d’un vieil poète français nommé Raminagrobis,20. How Panurge takes advice from an old French poet named Raminagrobis,"CHAPTER 21 [It is Socrates, in Plato’s Phaedo, 85 AB, who teaches that dying poets may be divinely inspired and therefore prophetic. This dying old sage, despite his comic pussy-cat name, is wise, as is the dying man in the Colloquy of Erasmus called Funus (the Funeral) in which the evangelical Christian wishes to be left to die in peace, untroubled by rapacious Franciscans, Dominicans and others, varied in their vestments but all after his money. The platonic explanation of the prophetic powers of the dying, which compares the departing soul to a traveller exchanging signals with friends glimpsed from afar on the quayside as their ship draws near to the harbour, is from a well-known passage of Plutarch’s On the Genius of Socrates. The seriousness of the chapter for Rabelais is emphasized by the allusion to the death of his late patron Guillaume Du Bellay, the Seigneur de Langey, the statesman brother of his present patron Cardinal Jean Du Bellay. Rabelais was present at Langey’s death on the way back from Italy, having served there in his household. For Rabelais he was, in the strictest sense, a hero. (See in the Fourth Book, Chapter 27.) The reference to La Grande Gorre, the second wife of Ramina-grobis, producing the fair Bazoche, is obscure. It may well refer to a Mardi Gras procession in which a grotesque figure representing La Grande Gorre (the pox? an elegant woman?) gives birth to La Bazoche (the whole company of lawyers’ clerks in Paris), but its meaning in context remains puzzling. Two adages of Erasmus are exploited: I, IV, XXX, To move every stone’, and ‘I, II, LV, ‘Swan Song’. The verse cited is by Guillaume Crétin, though Rabelais may not have known that fact as the poem appeared anonymously in an anthology. The final words of Raminagrobis are markedly evangelical, echoing well-known phrases of Scripture (from, for example,","CHAPTER XXI How Panurge consulteth with an old French Poet, named Raminagrobis."

"« Il dénote, dit Pantagruel, qu’elle vous dérobera, et je vous vois bien en point, selon ces trois sorts : vous serez cocu, vous serez battu, vous serez dérobé.","“It denotes,” said Pantagruel, “that she will steal you, and I see you in good shape, according to these three spells: you will be cuckolded, you will be beaten, you will be stolen.","‘That means,’ said Pantagruel, ‘that she will rob you. According to those three lots I can see you in a fine old mess: you will be cuckolded, beaten and robbed.’","Hence this, according to these three drawn Lots, will be your future Destiny, (I clearly see it) you will be a Cuckold, you will be beaten, and you will be robbed."

How Rondibilis declares cuckold age to be naturally a prerogative of marriage,"CHAPTER 32 [S.P.Q.R. stands for Senatus populusque Romanus (The Roman people and Senate). To Panurge it means si peu que rien (so little as to be nothing). The jest is here transposed in the translation to an English equivalent. Rondelet’s domain is the Natural. He draws on sound authorities, including the Letter to Dionysus of Pseudo-Hippocrates, The Laws of Marriage of Tiraqueau, and the Marriage Precepts of Plutarch.",CHAPTER XXXII How Rondibilis declareth Cuckoldry to be naturally one of the Appendances of Marriage.
"Ce fait, issaient[5] hors, toujours conférants des propos de la lecture, et se déportaient[6] en Bracque, ou ès prés, et jouaient à la balle, à la paume, à la pile trigone[7], galantement s’exerçants les corps comme ils avaient les âmes auparavant exercé. Tout leur jeu n’était qu’en liberté, car ils laissaient la partie quand leur plaisait, et cessaient ordinairement lorsque suaient parmi le corps, ou étaient autrement las. Adonc étaient très bien essuyés et frottés, changeaient de chemise, et, doucement se promenants, allaient voir si le dîner était prêt.

All their play was only loose, for they left the game when they pleased, and usually ceased when sweating among the body, or otherwise weary. So they were very well wiped and scrubbed, changed their shirts, and, strolling gently, went to see if dinner was ready. There waiting, recited clearly and eloquently [8] some sentences retained from the lesson.","That done, they would go outdoors, still conferring together on the subjects of those readings, and enjoy sports in Le Grand Braque or in the meadows; there they played ball or royal-tennis, [or three-men quoits,] nobly exercising their bodies as they had previously exercised their minds. Their games were all played freely, for they stopped whenever they wanted to, normally when they were tired or all of a sweat. At which point they were thoroughly sponged and rubbed down; they would change their shirts and gently stroll over to see whether dinner was ready. While waiting, they would clearly and eloquently repeat some maxims remembered from their lessons.","This done, they went forth, still conferring of the substance of the lecture, either unto a field near the University called the Brack, or unto the medowes where they played at the ball, the long-tennis, and at the Piletrigone, (which is a play wherein we throw a triangular piece of iron at a ring, to passe it,) most gallantly exercising their bodies, as formerly they had done their mindes. All their play was but in liberty, for they left off when they pleased, and that was commonly when they did sweat over all their body, or were otherwayes weary. Then were they very well wiped and rubbed, shifted their shirts, and, walking soberly, went to see if dinner was ready. Whilest they stayed for that, they did clearly and eloquently pronounce some sentences that they had retained of the lecture."

"En icelle heure vint vers nous droit aborder une navire chargée de tabourins[16], en laquelle je reconnus quelques passagers de bonne maison, entre autres Henri Cotiral, compagnon vieux, lequel à sa ceinture un grand viet d’aze[17] portait, comme les femmes portent patenôtres, et en main senestre portait un gros, gras, vieil et sale bonnet d’un teigneux, en sa dextre tenait un gros trou[18] de chou.

To one each of his nochers[35] gave five hundred crowns to the sun. To Gargantua his father sent the tarande covered with a satin cover brocaded with gold, with the tapestry containing the life and gestures of Achilles and the three unicorns caparisoned with curled gold cloth. Thus departed[36] from Médamothi, Malicorne to return to Gargantua, Pantagruel to continue his navigation[37].

He ordered five hundred Sun-crowns to be given to each of his seamen. To his father Gargantua he sent the tarand (covered with a caparison of satin with gold brocade) as well as the tapestries containing the life and deeds of Achilles and the three unicorns with caparisons of gilded frieze-cloth. And then they sailed away from Medamothi, Malicorne to return to Gargantua, and Pantagruel to continue his voyage.

Pantagruel having writ his Letters, sat down at Table with him, and afterwards presented him with a large Chain of Gold weighing eight hundred Crowns; between whose Septenary Links, some large Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, Turky Stones, and Unions were alternatively set in. To each of his Bark’s Crew, he order’d to be given five hundred Crowns. To Gargantua his Father, he sent the Tarand covered with a Cloth of Gold, brocaded with Sattin, and the Tapistry containing the Life and Deeds of Achilles, with the three Unicorns in Friz’d Cloth of Gold Trappings. And so they left Medamothy. Malicorn to return to Gargantua; Pantagruel to proceed in his Voyage, during which, Epistemon read to him the Books which the Esquire had brought: And because he found them jovial and pleasant, I shall give you an account of them, if you earnestly desire it."
"– Mariez-vous donc, de par Dieu, répondit Pantagruel.","""Marry then, by God,"" replied Pantagruel.","‘Find you a wife then, for God’s sake,’ Pantagruel replied.","Marry then in the Name of God, answered Pantagruel."

Je vous supplie, levez un peu vos esprits de terrienne pensée en contemplation hautaine des merveilles de nature, et ici condamnez-vous vous-même pour les erreurs qu’avez commis, perversement exposant les dits[26] prophétiques de la dive[27] sibylle. Posé, mais non admis ni concédé le cas que ma femme, par l’instigation de l’ennemi d’enfer, voulût et entreprît me faire un mauvais tour, me diffamer, me faire cocu jusqu’au cul, me dérober et outrager, encore ne viendra elle à fin[28] de son vouloir et entreprise. La raison qui à ce me meut est en ce point dernier fondée, et est extraite du fond de panthéologie monastique.

Argued, but neither admitted nor conceded the case that my wife, by the instigation of the enemy of hell, wanted and undertook to do me a bad trick, to defame me, to cuckold me up to my ass, to steal from me and outrage me, yet will she come to an end[28] of her will and enterprise. The reason that moves me is in this last point founded, and is extracted from the fund of monastic pantheology. Brother Artus Culletant once told me, and was on a Monday morning, eating a bushel of gullies together,[29] and if[30] it rained, I remember it. God give him hello!","‘The fourth couplet says of my wife: But flay not will, All of it. How nicely put! You take that to mean assault and battery. Let’s change the subject. Raise your minds, I beseech you, a little above earthly thoughts to a high contemplation of the wonders of Nature. Here you stand self-condemned for the mistakes you have committed by perversely expounding the prophetic utterances of that hallowed Sibyl. ‘Supposing, but neither admitting nor conceding, that my wife, at the instigation of the fiend from Hell, desired to play me a dirty trick and undertook to do so, shaming me, cuckolding me up to the bum, robbing me and affronting me, she would never achieve her desire and undertaking. The reason which moves me to make that last point is extracted from the profundities of monastical pantheology. ‘I was told it once by Frère Artus Bumbler – it was one Monday morning when we were both sharing a pint of andouil-lettes; it was raining, I remember; may God give him good-day!","The Fourth Article doth imply, That my Wife will flay me, but not all O the fine Word! You interpret this to beating Strokes and Blows. Speak wisely: Will you eat a Pudding? Sir, I beseech you to raise up your Spirits above the low-sized pitch of earthly Thoughts, unto that height of sublime Contemplation, which reacheth to the Apprehension of the Mysteries and Wonders of Dame Nature. And here be pleased to condemn your self, by a renouncing of those Errors which you have committed very grosly, and somewhat perversly, in expounding the Prophetick Sayings of the Holy Sibyl. You put the case (albeit I yield not to it) that by the Instigation of the Devil, my Wife should go about to wrong me, make me a Cuckold downwards to the very Breech, disgrace me otherways, steal my Goods from me, yea, and lay violently her Hands upon me; she nevertheless should fail of her Attempts, and not attain to the proposed end of her unreasonable Undertakings. The Reason which induceth me hereto, is grounded totally on this last Point, which is extracted from the profoundest Privacies of a Monastick Pantheology, as good Friar Arthur Wagtaile told me once upon a Monday morning; as we were (if I have not forgot) eating a Bushel of Trotter-pies; and I remember well it rained hard: God give him the good Morrow."

Let's go to fight, fellow [11] and well to the point of rubbing our bacon. Tell me that my verdun[12] is not longer than your sword[13].

Ho saint Siobé, cape de Gascogne, your pla sleepie you, when aquoest taquain me bingut estée. The adventurer once more invited him to fight, but the Gascon said to him: ""Hey paouret, where your mess is that his place is resting."" Vain a pauc who poses you like you, you can tricken. With the oblivion of his loss, he had lost the will to fight. Sum, instead of fighting and perchance killing each other, they went to drink together, each on his sword.

Look, me sword’s no longer than your rapier.” ‘The Gascon, feeling fuzzy, answered him in his dialect: ‘“By Saint Arnaud’z head! Who be you to wake I up? May barrel-fever twist your guts! Ho! Saint Sebber, Patron Saint of Gascony, I was having a good snooze when this old sod comes pestering me!” ‘The soldier-of-fortune challenged him to a fight on the spot; but the Gascon replied: ‘“Hey, stop it, you poor little chap. Now that I’ve had a good rest, I could skin you alive.” ‘His money was gone and forgotten: gone too his desire to fight! In short instead of starting a fight and perhaps killing each other they went off together for a drink, each pawning his sword. Sleep had achieved that good result and calmed the fiery frenzy of those two stout champions.

To this effect, having made enquiry and search for him throughout the whole Camp, and in sequel thereof found him asleep, he said unto him, Up, ho, good Fellow, in Name of all the Devils of Hell, rise up, rise up, get up; I have lost my Money as well as thou hast done, let us therefore go fight lustily together, grapple and scuffle it to some purpose: Thou may’st see that; and look, my Tuck is no longer than thy Rapier. The Gascon, altogether astonished at his unexpected Provocation, without altering his former Dialect, spoke thus: Cap de sainct Arnault, quau seys tu, qui me rebelliez? Que man de tavverne te gyre. Ho, sainct Siobé, cap de Guascoigne, ta pla dormie iou, quand aquoest taquain me bingut estée.

Vayne un pauc qui te posar com iou; puesse truqueren. Thus, in forgetting his Loss, he forgot the eagerness which he had to fight. In conclusion, after that the other had likeways slept a little they, instead of fighting, and possibly killing one another, went joyntly to a Sutler’s Tent, where they drank together very amicably, each upon the pawn of his Sword. Thus, by a little Sleep was pacified the ardent Fury of two warlike Champions.

"Soudainement les deux portes, sans que personne y touchât, de soi-même s’ouvrirent, et, s’ouvrant, firent non bruit strident, non frémissement horrible, comme font ordinairement portes de bronze rudes et pesantes, mais doux et gracieux murmure, retentissant par la voûte du temple, duquel soudain Pantagruel entendit la cause, voyant sous l’extrémité de l’une et l’autre porte un petit cylindre, lequel, par sus l’esseuil joignait la porte, et se tournant selon qu’elle se tirait vers le mur, dessus une dure pierre d’ophite[11], bien torse et également polie, par son frottement faisait ce doux et harmonieux murmure.","Suddenly the two doors, without anyone touching them, opened of their own accord, and, opening, made not a shrill noise, not a horrible quivering, as the rough and heavy bronze doors usually do, but a soft and gracious murmur, resounding through the vault of the temple, the cause of which Pantagruel suddenly heard, seeing under the extremity of both doors a small cylinder, which, above the sill joined the door, and turning as it pulled towards the wall, above a hard stone of ophite[11], well twisted and equally polished, by its friction made this soft and harmonious murmur.","Suddenly, without being touched by anyone, the two doors swung open. They made no strident squeal when doing so nor any ghastly grating noise such as tough, heavy brass doors usually do, but rather a sweet and pleasant sound which echoed through the vault of the Temple. Pantagruel understood why as soon as he espied small rollers set beneath the edge of each door and attached to their hinges: as each swung back towards the wall it rubbed against a hard, very even, smoothed-down piece of porphyry, thus producing that sweet, harmonious sound.","Immediately the Gates flew open without being touch’d, not with a creaking, or loud harsh noise, like that made by heavy Brazen Gates, but with a soft pleasing Murmur that resounded through the Arches of the Temple. Pantagruel soon knew the cause of it, having discover’d a small Cylinder or Rowler that join’d the Gates over the Threshold, and, turning like them towards the Wall on a hard well-polish’d Ophits Stone, with rubbing and rowling, caus’d that harmonious Murmur."

"Tant noblement étaient appris, qu’il n’était entre eux celui ni celle qui ne sût lire, écrire, chanter, jouer d’instruments harmonieux, parler de cinq à six langages, et en iceux composer, tant en carme[5] qu’en oraison solue[6]. Jamais ne furent vus chevaliers tant preux, tant galants, tant dextres[7] à pied et à cheval, plus verts, mieux remuants, mieux maniants tous bâtons[8], que là étaient. Jamais ne furent vues dames tant propres, tant mignonnes, moins fâcheuses, plus doctes à la main, à l’aiguille, à tout acte mulièbre[9] honnête et libre, que là étaient. Par cette raison quand le temps venu était que aucun d’icelle abbaye, ou à la requête de ses parents, ou pour autre cause, voulût issir[10] hors, avec soi il emmenait une des dames, celle laquelle l’aurait pris pour son dévot, et étaient ensemble mariés, et si bien avaient vécu à Thélème en dévotion et amitié, encore mieux la continuaient-ils en mariage, d’autant s’entr’aimaient-ils à la fin de leurs jours comme le premier de leurs noces…","So nobly were they learned that there was not between them he or she who could not read, write, sing, play harmonious instruments, speak five or six languages, and in them compose, both in Carmelite[5] and 'in solitary prayer[6]. Never were knights so valiant, so gallant, so dexterous[7] on foot and on horseback, greener, better restless, better wielding all staves[8], than there were. Never were ladies so clean, so pretty, less troublesome, more learned in the hand, in the needle, in any honest and free multiple act, than there were. For this reason when the time came that none of the abbey, either at the request of his parents, or for another reason, wanted to leave [10] outside, he took with him one of the ladies, the one who would have taken him for his devotee, and were married together, and so well had lived in Thélème in devotion and friendship, even better did they continue it in marriage, so much so that they loved each other at the end of their days as the first of their wedding…","Away vile Usury’s filthy money-grubbers, Foul beggars, pigs forever with vile snouts in, Fat-cats and Scribes, judicial pettifoggers, Bent, bluff-nosed rascals stuffing coins in coffers, Unsatisfied though thousand crowns are crammed in, All teeth on edge, save when there’s gold to win And pile up high, with lean and hawkish face","so nobly were they taught, that there was neither he nor she amongst them, but could read, write, sing, play upon several musical instruments, speak five or sixe several languages, and compose in them all very quaintly, both in Verse and Prose: never were seene so valiant Knights, so noble and worthy, so dextrous and skilful both on foot and a horseback, more brisk and lively, more nimble and quick, or better handling all manner of weapons then were there. Never were seene Ladies so proper and handsome, so miniard and dainty, lesse froward, or more ready with their hand, and with their needle , in every honest and free action belonging to that sexe then were there; for this reason when the time came, that any man of the said Abbey, either at the request of his parents, or for some other cause, had a minde to go out of it, he carried along with him one of the Ladies, namely her whom he had before that chosen for his Mistris, and were married together: and if they had formerly in Theleme lived in good devotion and amity, they did continue therein and increase it to a greater height in their state of matrimony: and did entertaine that mutual love till the very last day of their life, in no lesse vigour and fervency, then at the very day of their wedding: here must not I forget to set down unto you a riddle, which was found under the ground, as they were laying the foundation of the Abbey, ingraven in a copper plate; and it was thus as followeth. CHAPTER LVIII A Propheticall Riddle. POOR mortals, who wait for a happy day, Cheer up your hearts, and hear what I shall say: If it be lawful firmly to beleeve, That the celestial bodies can us give Wisdom to judge of things that are not yet: Or if from Heav’n such wisdom we may get, As may with confidence make us discourse Of years to come, their destinie and course; I to my hearers give to understand, That this next Winter, though it be at hand, Yea and before, there shall appear a race Of men, who loth to sit still in one place Shall boldly go before all peoples eyes, Suborning men of divers qualities, To draw them into covenants and sides, In such a manner, that whate’re betides, They ’l move you, if you give them eare (no doubt) With both your friends and kinred to fall out. They ’l make a vassal to gain-stand his Lord, And children their own Parents, in a Word, All reverence shall then be banished: No true respect to other shall be had: They ’l say that every man shall have his turn, Both in his going forth, and his return; And hereupon there shall arise such woes, Such jarrings, and confused toos and froes, That never were in history such coyles Set down as yet, such tumults and garboyles. Then shall you many gallant men see by Valour stirr’d up, and youthful fervencie, Who trusting too much in their hopeful time, Live but a while, and perish in their prime. Neither shall any who this course shall run, Leave off the race which he hath once begun, Till they the heavens with noise by their contention Have fill’d, and with their steps the earths dimension. Then those shall have no lesse authority , That have no faith, then those that will not lie; For all shall be governed by a rude, Base, ignorant, and foolish multitude; The veriest lowt of all shall be their Judge, O horrible, and dangerous deluge! Deluge I call it, and that for good reason, For this shall be omitted in no season; Nor shall the earth of this foule stirre be free, Till suddenly you in great store shall see The waters issue out, with whose streams the Most moderate of all shall moist’ned be, And justly too; because they did not spare The flocks of beasts that innocentest are, But did their sinews, and their bowels take, Not to the gods a sacrifice to make, But usually to serve themselves for sport; And now consider, I do you exhort, In such commotions so continual, What rest can take the globe terrestrial? Most happy then are they, that can it hold, And use it carefully as precious gold, By keeping it in Goale, whence it shall have No help but him, who being to it gave. And to increase his mournful accident, The Sunne, before it set in th’ occident Shall cease to dart upon it any light, More then in an eclipse, or in the night. So that at once its favour shall be gone, And liberty with it be left alone. And yet, before it come to ruine thus, Its quaking shall be as impetuous As Ætna’s was, when Titan’s sons lay under, And yeeld, when lost, a fearful sound like thunder. Inarime did not more quickly move, When Typheûs did the vast huge hills remove, And for despite into the sea them threw. Thus shall it then be lost by wayes not few, And changed suddenly, when those that have it To other men that after come shall leave it. Then shall it be high time to cease from this So long, so great, so tedious exercise; For the great waters told you now by me, Will make each think where his retreat shall be; And yet before that they be clean disperst , You may behold in th’ aire where nought was erst, The burning heat of a great flame to rise, Lick up the water, and the enterprise. It resteth after those things to declare, That those shall sit content, who chosen are, With all good things, and with celestial man, And richly recompensed every man: The others at the last all strip’t shall be , That after this great work all men may see How each shall have his due, this is their lot; O he is worthy-praise that shrinketh not. No sooner was this ænigmatical monument read over, but Gargantua fetching a very deep sigh, said unto those that stood by, It is not now only (I perceive) that People called to the faith of the Gospel, and convinced with the certainty of Evangelical truths are persecuted; but happy is that man that shall not be scandalized, but shall alwayes continue to the end, in aiming at that mark, which God by his dear Son hath set before us, without being distracted or diverted by his carnal affections and depraved nature. The Monk then said, What do you think in your conscience is meant and signified by this riddle? What? (said Gargantua) the progresse and carrying on of the divine truth. By St. Goderan (said the Monk) that is not my exposition; it is the stile of the Prophet Merlin : make upon it as many grave allegories and glosses as you will, and dote upon it you and the rest of the world as long as you please: for my part, I can conceive no other meaning in it, but a description of a set at tennis in dark and obscure termes. The suborners of men are the Makers of matches, which are commonly friends. After the two chases are made, he that was in the upper end of the tennis-court goeth out, and the other cometh in. They beleeve the first, that saith the ball was over or under the line. The waters are the heats that the players take till they sweat again. The cords of the rackets are made of the guts of sheep or goats. The Globe terrestrial is the tennis-ball.

Above was the noble Bacchus drinking from a kantharos. In this since imitated Caius Marins, after the victory of the Cimbrians, which he obtained near Aix en Provence. All his army was crowned with ivy: their thyrses, shields and tymbons[18] were covered with it. There was not the donkey of Silénus which was not caparisoned.","His triumphal car was covered all over with ivy, culled and garnered on Mount Meros for its rarity, which raises the price of everything, particularly of this plant in India. (Later, Alexander the Great, during his Indian triumph, imitated him in that: his car was drawn by elephants yoked together. And subsequently Pompey the Great during his African Triumph in Rome, imitated him.) On his car rode our noble Bacchus, drinking from a two-handed jar (and in that Caius Marius imitated him after his victory over the Cimbri which he won near Aix-en-Provence).

The Chariot was draw’d by Elephants join’d together, wherein he was imitated by Pompey the Great at Rome in his African Triumph. The good Bacchus was seen, drinking out of a mighty Urn, which Action Marius ap’d after his Victory over the Cimbri near Aix in Provence.

"Au soir, en soupant, ledit des Marays introduit un sien jeune page de Villegongis, nommé Eudémon, tant bien testonné[5], tant bien tiré, tant bien épousseté, tant honnête en son maintien que trop mieux ressemblait quelque petit angelot qu’un homme. Puis dit à Grandgousier :","In the evening, while having supper, the aforesaid des Marays brought in his own young page from Villegongis, named Eudémon, so well tested[5], so well drawn, so well dusted, so honest in his deportment that he looked too much like some little cherub than a male.

"Lors chargèrent sus raidement, toutefois grandement furent endommagés par ceux qui étaient sur les murs, en coups de trait et artillerie. Quoi voyant Gargantua, en grande puissance alla les secourir, et commença son artillerie à heurter sur ce quartier de murailles, tant que toute la force de la ville y fut révoquée[11]. Le moine voyant celui côté, lequel il tenait assiégé, dénué de gens et gardes, magnaniment tira vers le fort, et tant fit qu’il monta sus[12], lui et aucuns de ses gens, pensant que plus de crainte et de frayeur donnent ceux qui surviennent à un conflit que ceux qui lors à leur force combattent. Toutefois ne fit onques effroi[13] jusques à ce que tous les siens eussent gagné la muraille, excepté les deux cents hommes d’armes qu’il laissa hors pour les hasards.","They then charged stiffly, however were greatly damaged by those on the walls, in firing shots and artillery. Seeing that, Gargantua, in great power, went to succor them, and began his artillery to strike upon this district of walls, so long as the whole force of the city was revoked there. The monk seeing that side, which he held besieged, devoid of people and guards, magnanimously fired towards the fort, and did so much that he climbed on him and some of his people, thinking that no more fear and fear give those who arise in conflict than those who in their strength fight. However, there was no fear until all his people had gained the wall, except the two hundred men-at-arms whom he left outside for chance.","They attacked them, but were themselves greatly troubled by volleys of arrows and cannon-shot from the men on the walls. Seeing which, Gargantua went to their aid with a considerable force; his artillery began to pound that section of the walls, so much so that all the forces in the town were summoned to it. When the Monk saw that his side of the town which he was investing was deserted by its soldiers and the guardians of the gate, he bravely made for the fort and succeeded in scaling it with some of his men. He believed that troops who suddenly appear inspire more fear and terror than those who are heavily engaged in the fighting. However, he made no noise until all his men (except for the two hundred soldiers he had left outside for any emergency) had taken the wall.","Then charged they upon them stoutly, yet were they much indamaged by those that were upon the walles, who galled them with all manner of shot, both from the great ordnance, small guns and bowes. Which Gargantua perceiving, he went with a strong Partie to their relief, and with his Artillery began to thunder so terribly upon that canton of the wall, and so long, that all the strength within the town, to maintain and fill up the breach, was drawn thither. The Monk seeing that quarter which he kept besieged, void of men and competent guards, and in a manner altogether naked and abandoned, did most magnanimously on a sudden lead up his men towards the Fort, and never left it till he had got up upon it, knowing that such as come to the reserve in a conflict, bring with them alwayes more feare and terrour, then those that deal about them with their hands in the fight. Neverthelesse he gave no alarm till all his souldiers had got within the wall, except the two hundred horsemen, whom he left without to secure his entry."

"« Or, puisque ne convenons ensemble en l’exposition des sorts virgiliens, prenons autre voie de divination.","“Now, since we do not agree together in the exposition of Virgilian spells, let us take another path of divination.","The interpretation of Homer’s and Virgil’s two gates, one of ivory, one of horn, derives eventually from Macrobius’ Dream of Scipio. The gates were best known from the Aeneid, Book 6. More than once Rabelais, as here, applies the Classical rule of the Golden Mean to feasting and fasting, which would have horrified many ecclesiastical traditionalists: There is an echo of an adage of Erasmus: III, VIII, XII. ‘A hungry man is not to be disturbed’. ‘Nονς’ (‘Nous’) is the mind or spirit.] ‘Now then, since we cannot agree together over how to expound Virgilian lots, let us try another means of divination.’","Now seeing we cannot agree together in the manner of expounding or interpreting the Sense of the Virgilian Lots, let us bend our course another way, and try a new sort of Divination."

I do know a prayer, though, which protects the body from all firing-pieces; it was given me by the sub-sacristan of our Abbey. It won’t do me any good though: I don’t believe in it. Nevertheless the shaft of my cross will do a devilish good job. ‘By God, if I catch any of you lot ducking, the devil take me if I don’t make him a monk in my stead. I’ll truss him up in my frock: it contains a remedy for cowardice.","And the Monk encouraged them, saying, My children, do not feare nor doubt, I will conduct you safely; God and Sanct Benedict be with us. If I had strength answerable to my courage, by Sdeath I would plume them for you like ducks. I feare nothing but the great ordnance; yet I know of a charm by way of Prayer, which the sub-sexton of our Abbey taught me, that will preserve a man from the violence of guns, and all manner of fire-weapons and engines, but it will do me no good, because I do not believe it. Neverthelesse, I hope my staffe of the crosse shall this day play devillish pranks amongst them; by G— whoever of our Party shall offer to play the duck, and shrink when blowes are a dealing, I give myself to the devil, if I do not make a Monk of him in my stead, and hamper him within my frock, which is a sovereign cure against cowardise."
"Ce disant, mit bas son grand habit et se saisit du bâton de la croix qui était de cœur de cormier, long comme une lance, rond à plein poing, et quelque peu semé de fleurs de lys, toutes presque effacées. Ainsi sortit en beau sayon[12], mit son froc en écharpe, et de son bâton de la croix donna si brusquement sur les ennemis qui, sans ordre ni enseigne, ni trompette, ni tambourin, parmi le clos vendangeaient – car les porte-guidons et porte-enseignes avaient mis leurs guidons et enseignes l’orée[13] des murs, les tambourineurs avaient défoncé leurs tambourins d’un côté pour les emplir de raisins, les trompettes étaient chargées de moussines[14], chacun était dérayé[15], – il choqua donc si raidement sur eux, sans dire gare, qu’il les renversait comme porcs, frappant à tort et à travers, à la vieille escrime.","So saying, he took off his great habit and seized the staff of the cross, which was made of the heart of a service tree, long as a spear, round at the full fist, and somewhat strewn with fleur-de-lis, all almost obliterated. So he went out in fine sayon[12], put his frock in a sling, and with his staff of the cross fell so abruptly on the enemies who, without orders or sign, or trumpet, or tambourine, among the enclosure were harvesting – for the porters handlebars and standard bearers had put their handlebars and standards on the edge[13] of the walls, the drummers had smashed their tambourines on one side to fill them with grapes, the trumpets were loaded with moussines[14], each one was striped[ 15], – so he struck so hard on them, without saying a word, that he knocked them down like pigs, striking wrong and wrong, at the old fencing.","So saying, he cast off his great habit and grabbed the shaft of the Cross; it was from the heart of a cornel-tree, as long as a lance, rounded for the fist and scattered with a few fleurs-de-lys all but effaced. He sallied forth in a handsome cassock, his frock thrown over like a scarf, and with the shaft of his Cross he lashed out so violently at the enemy who without order, standard, trumpet or drum were harvesting the grapes in the close (for those who bore banner or standard had left them alongside the walls, while the drummers had knocked in one side of their drums so as to fill them with grapes, and the trumpeters were burdened by grape-laden vine-branches: all had broken ranks) he fell so suddenly on them without crying Cave, that he knocked them over like porkers, slashing this way and that as one fenced of old.","As he spake this, he threw off his great Monks habit, and laid hold upon the staffe of the crosse, which was made of the heart of a sorbaple-tree, it being of the length of a lance, round, of a full gripe, and a little poudred with lilies called flower de luce, the workmanship whereof was almost all defaced and worn out. Thus went he out in a faire long-skirted jacket, putting his frock scarfewayes athwart his breast, and in this equipage, with his staffe, shaft or truncheon of the crosse, laid on so lustily, brisk and fiercely upon his enemies, who without any order, or ensigne, or trumpet, or drum, were busied in gathering the grapes of the Vineyard; for the Cornets, Guidons, and Ensigne-bearers, had laid down their standards, banners, and colours by the wallsides: the Drummers had knockt out the heads of their Drums on one end, to fill them with grapes: the Trumpeters were loaded with great bundles of bunches, and huge knots of clusters: In summe, every one of them was out of aray, and all in disorder."

Let him who will debate of felicity and the sovereign good; but by my decree whoever plants cabbages is here and now pronounced to be truly blessèd, with far more reason than Pyrrho had, who when in such danger as we are now, and seeing a pig near the shore which was eating some scattered barley, pronounced it most blessèd in two respects: namely, that it had barley in plenty and, moreover, was on the shore. ‘Ha!","O twice and thrice happy those that plant Cabbages! O Destinies, why did you not Spin me for a Cabbage Planter? O how few are they to whom Jupiter hath been so favourable as to Predestinate them to plant Cabbage! They have always one Foot on the ground and the other not far from it. Dispute who will of Felicity, and summum bonum, for my part, whosoever plants Cabbage, is now by my Decree proclaim’d most happy; for as good a reason as the Philosopher Pyrrho being in the same danger, and seeing a Hog near the shoar eating some scatter’d Oats, declar’d it happy in two respects, first, because it had plenty of Oats, and besides that it was on shoar.

"Ayant serpé[2] nos ancres et gumènes[3], fîmes voile au doux zéphir. Environ 222 milles, se leva un furieux tourbillon de vents divers, autour duquel avec le trinquet[4] et boulingues[5] quelque peu temporisâmes pour seulement n’être dits mal obéissants au pilote, lequel nous assurait, vu la douceur d’iceux vents, vu aussi leur plaisant combat, ensemble la sérénité de l’air et tranquillité (lu courant, n’être ni en espoir de grand bien ni en crainte de grand mal, partant[6] à propos nous être la sentence du philosophe, qui commandait soutenir et abstenir, c’est à-dire temporiser. Tant toutefois dura ce tourbillon qu’à notre requête importuné, le pilote essaya le rompre et suivre notre route première. De fait, levant le grand artimon, et à droite calamite[7] du boussole dressant le gouvernail, rompit, moyennant un rude cole[8] survenant, le tourbillon susdit. Mais ce fut en pareil déconfort, comme si évitants Charybde, fussions tombés en Scylle, car à deux milles du lieu furent nos nefs encarrées parmi les arènes[9], telles que sont les ras Saint-Maixant.","Having drawn [2] our anchors and gumènes [3], we sailed in the gentle zephyr. About 222 miles, a furious whirlwind of various winds arose, around which with the trinquet[4] and bowling alleys[5] we delayed a bit, only to be said not to be obedient to the pilot, who assured us, given the mildness of the ice winds, seen also their pleasant combat, together the serenity of the air and tranquility (read flowing, being neither in hope of great good nor in fear of great evil, therefore[6] apropos we be the sentence of the philosopher, which commanded sustain and abstain, that is to say, temporize. However, this whirlwind lasted so long that, at our importunate request, the pilot tried to break it and follow our first course. In fact, raising the great mizzen, and calamity on the right[ 7] of the compass raising the rudder, the aforesaid whirlwind broke, with a sharp cole [8] occurring, but it was in the same discomfiture, as if avoiding Charybdis, had fallen into Scyllus, for two miles from the place were our naves squared among the arenas[9], such as the ras Saint-Maixant .","Having weighed our anchors and slipped our cables, we set sail, blown by the gentle Zephyr. Some twenty-two miles further on there arose a boisterous whirlwind with a variety of gusts; we skirted it, temporizing by setting our top-gallants and our topsails, with the sole aim of not being accused of going against the instructions of the pilot, who personally assured us that we had no great good to hope for, and no great harm to fear given the lightness of those breezes, their pleasant skirmishes and the calmness of the air. The philosopher’s adage was therefore relevant to us, which tells us to Bear and forbear, that is, to temporize. That whirlwind went on for so long, however, that, at our importuning, the pilot tried forcing a way through it, sticking to our original route. And indeed, after hoisting the mizzen and setting the helm strictly by the needle of the compass, we did force our way through that whirlwind thanks to a stiff gale which was blowing. But we were as discomfited as though we had struck Scylla by avoiding Charybdis: some two miles on our ships were stranded amidst shoals similar to the shallows at Saint-Maixent.","Pan.

"Cependant les métayers, qui là auprès challaient[17] les noix, accoururent avec leurs grandes gaules, et frappèrent sur ces fouaciers comme sur seigle vert. Les autres bergers et bergères, oyants le cri de Frogier, y vinrent avec leurs fondes[18] et brassiers[19], et les suivirent à grands coups de pierres, tant menus qu’il semblait que ce fût grêle. Finalement, les aconçurent[20], et ôtèrent de leurs fouaces environ quatre ou cinq douzaines, toutefois ils les payèrent au prix accoutumé, et leur donnèrent un cent de quecas[21] et trois panerées de francs-aubiers[22]. Puis les fouaciers aidèrent à monter Marquet, qui était vilainement blessé, et retournèrent à Lerné sans poursuivre le chemin de Parillé, menaçants fort et ferme les bouviers, bergers et métayers de Seuillé et de Sinais.","However, the sharecroppers, who there near were chaffing [17] the nuts, ran up with their great saplings, and struck on these fouaciers as on green rye. The other shepherds and shepherdesses, hearing the cry of Frogier, came there with their foundries[18] and brassiers[19], and followed them with great blows of stones, so small that it seemed to be hail. Finally, they acquired them[20], and removed from their cakes about four or five dozen, however they paid for them at the usual price, and gave them a hundred of quecas[21] and three breadcrumbs of sapwood[22]. Then the fouaciers helped to mount Marquet, who was badly wounded, and returned to Lerné without continuing the Parillé road, threatening loudly and firmly the herdsmen, shepherds and sharecroppers of Seuillé and Sinais.","Meanwhile the peasant-farmers thereabouts who were knocking down walnuts came charging up with their long poles and thrashed those fouace-bakers as though threshing green rye. The other shepherds and shepherdesses, on hearing Frogier’s yell, came up with their slings and catapults and chased after them, so densely showering them with stones that it seemed like hail. Finally they caught up with them and helped themselves to some four or five dozen fouaces. Yet they paid the going rate, adding a hundred walnuts and three basketfuls of ripe white grapes. That done, the fouace-bakers, having helped Marquet back into his saddle – he had a nasty wound – abandoned the road to Parilly and made their way back to Lerné, uttering loud and violent threats against the cowherds, shepherds and peasant-farmers of Seuilly and Cinais.","Mean-while the farmers and countrey-swaines, that were watching their walnuts near to that place, came running with their great poles and long staves, and laid such load on these cake-bakers, as if they had been to thresh upon green rie. The other shepherds and shepherdesses hearing the lamentable shout of Forgier, came with their slings and slackies following them, and throwing great stones at them, as thick as if it had been haile. At last they overtook them, and took from them about foure or five dosen of their cakes; neverthelesse they payed for them the ordinary price, and gave them over and above one hundred egges, and three baskets full of mulberries. Then did the cake-bakers help to get up to his mare Marquet, who was most shrewdly wounded, and forthwith returned to Lerne, changing the resolution they had to go to Pareille, threatning very sharp and boistrously the cowherds, shepherds, and farmers of Sevile and Sinays."

Encore suis-je d’avis que nous entrions en la tétrade pythagorique, et, pour subréquart[8], ayons notre féal le philosophe Trouillogan, attendu mêmement que le philosophe parfait, et tel qu’est Trouillogan, répond assertivement[9] de tous doutes proposés. Carpalim, donnez ordre que les ayons tous quatre dimanche prochain à dîner.","“You speak like a courtier,” said Pantagruel. But the first point, I deny, seeing the main, even unique and total occupation of good theologians being employed[6] by facts, by words, by writings to eradicate errors and heresies (far from it be tainted), and to plant deeply in human hearts the true and living Catholic faith. The second I praise, seeing the good doctors give such order to the prophylactic and preserving part of health in their place that they do not need the therapeutic and curative by drugs. The third I concede, seeing good lawyers so distracted in their patrocinations[7] and replies to the rights of others that they have no time or leisure to hear on their own. However, next Sunday, let us have our father Hippothadée for theologian, our master Rondibilis for physician, our friend Bridoye for lawyer. Still I am of the opinion that we should enter the Pythagorean tetrad, and, for sub-requart[8], let us have our feal the philosopher Trouillogan, even as the perfect philosopher, and such as Trouillogan, answers assertively[9] of any doubts offered. Carpalim, order that we have all four of them next Sunday for dinner.","‘You are talking like Il Cortegiano, said Pantagruel, ‘but I deny the first assertion, noting that the main, indeed the sole and unique occupation, of good theologians is to extirpate heresies by word, deed and writing (far from being tainted by them), and to implant deeply within human hearts the true and living Catholic faith. ‘The second I approve of, noting that physicians so order the prophylactic and health-conserving side in their own cases that they have no need of the therapeutic, which cures by medicines. ‘The third I concede, noting that good lawyers are so preoccupied with pleading and making legal rejoinders on behalf of the affairs of others that they have neither time nor leisure to pay attention to their own. ‘And so for our theologian next Sunday let us take our own Père Hippothadée; for physician, Dr Rondibilis; and for legist, our friend Bridoye. ‘I further advise that we should move into the tetrad – the perfect number of the Pythagoreans – and so make up the fourth by inviting our loyal subject Trouillogan the philosopher, especially seeing that an accomplished philosopher such as he is replies affirmatively to all doubts expounded to him. ‘Carpalim. Arrange for us to have all four of them here to dinner next Sunday.’","You speak like a Courtier, (quoth Pantagruel) but the first Point of your Assertion is to be denied: For we daily see how good Theologues make it their chief Business, their whole and sole Employment, by their Deeds, their Words, and Writings, to extirpate Errors and Heresies out of the Hearts of Men; and in their stead profoundly plant the true and lively Faith. The second Point you spoke of I commend: For whereas the Professors of the Art of Medicine give so good order to the Prophylactick, or Conservative part of their Faculty, in what concerneth their proper Healths, that they stand in no need of making use of the other Branch, which is the Curative, or Therapeutick, by Medicaments. As for the Third, I grant it to be true: For learned Advocates and Counsellors at Law are so much taken up with the Affairs of others in their Consultations, Pleadings and such like Patrocinations of those who are their Clients, that they have no leisure to attend any Controversies of their own. Therefore, on the next ensuing Sunday, let the Divine be our goodly Father Hippothadee, the Physitian our honest Master Rondibilis, and the Legist our good Friend Bridlegoose: Nor will it be (to my thinking) amiss, that we enter into the Pythagorick Field, and chuse for an Assistant to the Three aforenamed Doctors, our ancient faithful Acquaintance, the Philosopher Trouillogan; especially seeing a perfect Philosopher, such as is Trouillogan, is able positively to resolve all whatsoever Doubts you can propose. Carpalin, have you a care to have them here all Four on Sunday next at Dinner, without fail."
"Car rien n’y quiers, sinon qu’en votre tour","Because nothing quiers there, except that in your turn","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","how a spark Of your great beauty hath inflam’d my heart With deep affection, and that for my part, I only ask that you with me would dance The brangle gay in feats of dalliance, For this one time."
"La vieille resta quelque temps en silence, pensive et rechignant des dents ; puis s’assit sur le cul d’un boisseau, prit en ses mains trois vieux fuseaux, les tourna et vira entre ses doigts en diverses manières, puis éprouva leurs pointes, le plus pointu retint en main, les deux autres jeta sous une pille[11] à mil. Après prit ses dévidoirs, et par neuf fois les tourna : au neuvième tour, considéra sans plus toucher le mouvement der dévidoirs, et attendit leur repos parfait.","The old woman remained silent for some time, thoughtful and grumbling; then sat down on the bottom of a bushel, took in his hands three old spindles, twisted them and twisted them between his fingers in various ways, then tested their points, the sharpest held in his hand, the two others threw under a pile [11] to mil. Then took his reels, and turned them nine times: on the ninth turn, considered without touching the movement of the reels, and waited for them to rest perfectly.","The old crone stayed silent for a while, thoughtful and sucking her teeth; then she sat down on an upturned barrel and took into her hands three ancient spindles, twisting and twiddling them between her fingers in a variety of ways. She tested their points and retained the sharpest one in her hand, tossing the other two under a mortar used for pestling millet. Then she took up her spools and spun them round nine times. At the ninth turn she gazed at them, no longer touching them and waited until they had completely stopped.","The Old Trot for a while remained silent, pensive and girning like a Dog, then, after she had set her withered Breech upon the bottom of a Bushel, she took into her Hands three old Spindles, which when she had turned and whirled betwixt her Fingers very diversly, and after several fashions, she pryed more narrowly into, by the tryal of their points; the sharpest whereof she retained in her hand, and threw the other two under a Stone Trough; after this, she took a pair of Yarn Windles, which she nine times unintermittedly veered, and frisked about, then at the ninth revolution or turn, without touching them any more, maturely perpending the manner of their motion, she very demurely waited on their repose and cessation from any farther stirring."
"– Tout beau, fillot, dit Pantagruel, tout beau. Ouvrez pour la seconde fois. »","“All fine, fillot,” said Pantagruel, “all fine. Open for the second time. »","‘Whoa there, my lad; whoa!’ said Pantagruel. ‘Just open the book for a second time.’","Hold there, said Pantagruel, Hoc, soft and fair (my Lad) enough of that, cast up, turn over the Leaves, and try your Fortune for the second time."
"– Zalas, zalas, dit Panurge, zalas ! Bou, bou, bou, bou, bous. Zalas, zalas ! était-ce ici que de périr nous était prédestiné ? Holos, bonnes gens, je noie, je meurs. Consummatum est. C’est fait de moi.","“Zalas, zalas,” said Panurge, “zalas! Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo. Zalas, zalas! was it here that we were predestined to perish? Holos, good people, I drown, I die. Consummatum is. It's made of me.","‘Zalas, zalas!’ said Panurge. ‘Zalas. Bou, bou, bou, bous. Was it here that we were predestined to drown? Holos, good folk. I’m drowning; dying. It is finished! I’m done for.’","- Alas, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, alas, alas, alas, alas, said Panurge, was it here we were born to perish? Oh! hoh! Good People, I drown, I die. Consummatum est."
"– C’est acte d’avocats, répondit Pantagruel, vendre paroles. Je vous vendrais plutôt silence et plus chèrement, ainsi que quelquefois le vendit. Démosthènes moyennant son argentangine. »","“It is an act of lawyers,” replied Pantagruel, “to sell words. I would rather sell you silence and more dearly, as sometimes sold it. Demosthenes by means of his argentangine. »","‘Selling Words is what lawyers do,’ replied Pantagruel. ‘I would rather sell you silence more dearly (as Demosthenes did with his money-quinsy).’","That’s the part of a Lawyer, return’d Pantagruel; I would sooner sell you Silence, tho’ at a dearer Rate, as Demosthenes formerly sold it by the means of his Argentangina or Silver Squinsey."
Pantagruel leur envoya par Gymnaste dedans l’esquif son aumône : soixante et dix-huit mille beaux petits écus à la lanterne. Puis demanda : « Quantes[5] heures sont ?,"Pantagruel sent them by Gymnast in the skiff his alms: seventy and eighteen thousand beautiful little crowns by the lantern. Then asked: ""Quantes [5] hours are?""","Pantagruel despatched Gymnaste in a skiff to take them his alms: seventy-eight thousand of those beautiful little half-crowns with a Lantern on them. He then asked, ‘What hour is it?’","Pantagruel sent them by Gymnast in the Pinnace seventy eight thousand fine pretty little Gold Half-Crowns, of those that are mark’d with a Lantern. After this he ask’d, What’s o’ Clock?"
"– Au rebours, répondit Panurge, c’est de moi qu’il pronostique, et dit que je la battrai en tigre, si elle me fâche. Martin bâton en fera l’office. En faute de bâton[20], le diable me mange si je ne la mangerais toute vive, comme la sienne mangea Cambles, roi des Lydiens.","""On the contrary,"" replied Panurge, ""he prognosticates of me, and says that I will beat her like a tiger if she angers me."" Martin Baton will do the job. For want of a stick[20], the devil eats me if I did not eat her alive, as his ate Cambles, king of the Lydians.","‘On the contrary,’ replied Panurge, ‘the prognostication is all about me: it says that if my wife annoys me I will maul her like a tiger. My Saint Martin’s staff will do the job. And in default of a stick, if I don’t eat her alive – as Cambies, the king of the Lydians, ate his – the devil may eat me.’","Clean and quite contrary (answered Panurge) it is of me that he prognosticates, in saying that I will beat her like a Tyger, if she vex me. Sir Martin Wagstaff will perform that Office, and in default of a Cudgel, the Devil gulp him, if I shou’d not eat her up quick, as Candaul the Lydian King did his Wife, whom he ravened and devoured."
7. Comment Panurge raconte à maître Æditue l’apologue du roussin et de l’âne,7. How Panurge tells Master Æditue the apologue of the roussin and the donkey,"CHAPTER 7 [Platonists make ignorance the source of all evil. But these islanders are no Platonists: they are a parody of the Religious, their life is controlled by their regular services and their copious meals. The chapter includes a delightful fable; perhaps the best-written pages in the entire Fifth Book.","CHAPTER VII How Pantagruel came to the Island of the Apedefers, or Ignoramus’s, with long Claws, and Crooked Paws, and of terrible Adventures and Monsters there. As soon as we had cast Anchor and had mor’d the Ship, the Pinnace was put over the Ship’s side, and Mann’d by the Coxswain’s Crew. When the good Pantagruel had prayed publickly, and given thanks to the Lord that had deliver’d him from so great a Danger, he stept into it with his whole Company, to go on shore, which was no ways difficult to do; for as the Sea was Calm, and the Winds laid, they soon got to the Cliffs. When they were set on shore, Epistemon, who was admiring the Scituation of the Place, and the strange shape of the Rocks, discover’d some of the Natives. The first he met, had on a short Purple Gown, a Doublet cut in Pains like a Spanish Leather Jerkin; half-sleeves of Satin, and the upper part of them Leather, a Coif like a Black Pot tipp’d with Tin; he was a good likely sort of a Body, and his name, as we heard afterwards, was Double-fee. Epistemon ask’d him, how they call’d those strange Craggy Rocks and Deep Vallies? He told him it was a Colony, brought out of Attorney-land, and call’d Process; and that if we forded the River somewhat further beyond the Rocks, we should come into the Island of the Apedefers. By the Memory of the Decretals, ask’d Fryar Jhon, tell us, I pray you, what you honest men here live on? Could not a man take a chirping Bottle with you, to taste your Wine? I can see nothing among you but Parchment, Inkhorns and Pens. We live on nothing else, return’d Double-fee; and all who live in this place must come through my hands. How, quoth Panurge, are you a Shaver then, do you fleece ’em? ay, ay, their Purse, answer’d Double-fee, nothing else. By the Foot of Pharao, cry’d Panurge, the De’ll a Sous you’ll get of me. However, sweet Sir, be so kind as to shew an honest man the way to those Apedefers, or Ignorant People, for I come from the Land of the Learned, where I did not learn over much. Still talking on, they got to the Island of the Apedefers, for they were soon got over the Ford. Pantagruel was not a little taken up with admiring the Structure and Habitation of the People of the Place. For they live in a swindging Wine-press, fifty steps up to it; you must know there are some of all sorts, little, great, private, middlesiz’d, and so forth. You go through a large Peristile, alias a long Entry set about with Pillars, in which you see in a kind of Landskip the Ruins of almost the whole World; besides so many great Robbers Gibbets, so many Gallows and Racks, that ’tis enough to fright you out of your seven Senses. Double-fee perceiving that Pantagruel was taken up with Contemplating those things , Let us go further, Sir, said he to him, all this is nothing yet. Nothing, quoth he, cri’d Fryar Jhon, By the soul of my over-heated Codpiece, Friend Panurge and I here shake and quiver for meer hunger. I had rather be drinking, than staring on those Ruins. Pray come along, Sir, said Double-fee. He then led us into a little Wine-press that lay backwards in a blind Corner, and was call’d Pithies in the Language of the Country. You need not ask whether Master Jhon and Panurge made much of their sweet selves there; ’tis enough that I tell you, there was no want of Bolonia Sawcidges, Turky-poots, Capons, Bustards, Malmesy, and all other sorts of good Belly-Timber, very well drest. A pimping Son of ten Fathers, who, for want of a better, did the Office of a Butler, seeing that Fryar Jhon had cast a Sheep’s eye at a choice Bottle that stood near a Cupboard by it self, at some distance from the rest of the Bottellic Magazine, like a Jack in an Office, said to Pantagruel, Sir, I perceive that one of your Men here is making love to this Bottle, he ogles it, and would fain caress it; but I beg that none offer to meddle with it; for ’tis reserv’d for their Worships. How, cri’d Panurge, there are some Grandees here then I see: ’Tis Vintage-time with you, I perceive. Then Double-fee led us up a private Stair-case, and shew’d us into a Room, whence, without being seen, out at a Loop-hole, we could see their Worships in the great Wine-press, where none could be admitted without their leave. Their Worships, as he call’d them, were about a score of fusty Crackropes and Gallow-clappers, or rather more, all posted before a Bar, and staring at each other like so many dead Pigs: Their Paws were as long as a Crane’s Foot, and their Claws four and twenty Inches long at least; for you must know, they are injoin’d never to pair off the least Chip of them, so that they grow as crooked as a Welch Hook, or a Hedging Bill. We saw a swindging Bunch of Grapes that are gather’d and squeez’d in that Country, brought in to them. As soon as it was laid down, they clapp’d it into the Press, and there was not a bit of it out of which each of them did not squeeze some Oil of Gold. Insomuch, that the poor Grape was tri’d with a Witness, and brought off so drain’d and pick’d, and so dry, that there was not the least moisture, juice or substance left in it, for they had prest out its very quintessence. Double-fee told us they had not often such huge Bunches, but, let the worst come to the worst, they were sure never to be without others in their Press. But hark you me, Master of mine, ask’d Panurge, Have they not some of different growth? ay marry have they, quoth Double-fee; do you see here this little Bunch, to which they are going to give t’ other wrinch; ’ Tis of Tyth-growth you must know; they crush’d, wrung, squeez’d and strain’d out the very heart’s blood of it but t’ other day, but it did not bleed freely, the Oil came hard, and smelt of the Priest’s Chest; so that they found there was not much good to be got out of ’t. Why then, said Pantagruel, do they put it again into the Press? only, answer’d Double-fee, for fear there should still lurk some Juice among the Husks, and Hullings, in the Mother of the Grape. The Devil be damn’d, cry’d Fryar Jhon, do you call these same Folks illiterate Lobcocks, and Dunsical Doddipoles? May I be broil’d like a Red-herring, if I don’t think they are wise enough to skin a Flint, and draw Oil out of a Brick-wall. So they are, said Double-fee, for they sometimes put Castles, Parks, and Forests into the Press, and out of them all extract Aurum potabile. You mean, Portabile, I suppose, cri’d Epistemon, such as may be born. I mean as I said, repli’d Double-fee, Potabile, such as may be drunk; for it makes them drink many a good Bottle more than otherwise they should. But I cannot better satisfy you as to the growths of the Vine-tree Syrup that is here squeez’d out of Grapes, than in desiring you to look your self yonder in that Back-yard, where you’ll see above a thousand different growths that lie a waiting to be squeez’d every moment. Here are some of the publick, and some of the private growth; some of the Builders, Fortifications, Loans, Gifts and Gratuities, Escheats, Forfeitures, Fines and Recoveries, Penal Statutes, Crown-Lands and Demesne, Privy-Purse, Post-Office, Offerings, Lordships of Mannors, and a world of other growths for which we want Names. Pray, quoth Epistemon, tell me of what growth is that great one with all those little Grapelings about it. Oh, oh! return’d Double-fee, that plump one is of the Treasury, the very best growth in the whole Countrey; whenever any one of that growth is squeez’d, there is not one of their Worships but gets Juice enough out of it to soak his Nose six Months together. When their Worships were up, Pantagruel desir’d Double-fee to take us into that great Wine-press, which he readily did. As soon as we were in, Epistemon, who understood all sorts of Tongues, began to shew us many Devises on the Press which was large and fine, and made of the Wood of the Cross (at least Double-fee told us so.) On each part of it were Names of every thing in the Language of the Countrey. The Spindle of the Press was call’d Receipt; the Trough, Cost and Damages; the Hole for the Vice-pin, State; the Side-boards, Money paid into the Office; the great Beam, Respit of homage; the Branches, Radiatur; the Side-beams, Recuperetur; the Fats, Ignoramus;* the two-handled Baskets, the Rolls; the Treading place, Acquittance; the Dossers, Validation; the Panniers, Authentic Decrees; the Pailes, Potentials; the Funnel, Quietus est. By the Queen of the Chitterlings, quoth Panurge, all the Hieroglyphics of Egypt are mine A— to this Jargon. Why! here’s a parcel of Words full as analogous as Chalk and Cheese, or a Cat and a Cart-wheel! But why, pr’y thee, Dear Double-fee, do they call these Worshipful Dons of yours, Ignorant Fellows? Only, said Double-fee, because they neither are or ought to be Clerks, and all must be ignorant as to what they transact here; nor is there to be any other Reason given, but, The Court hath said it; The Court will have it so; The Court has decreed it. Cop’s Body, quoth Panurge, they might full as well have call’d ’em Necessity, for Necessity has no Law. From thence, as he was leading us to see a thousand little puny Presses, we spy’d another paltry Bar, about which sate four or five ignorant waspish Churls, of so testy, fuming a Temper, and so ready to take Pepper in the Nose for Yea and Nay, that a Dog would not have liv’d with ’em. They were hard at it with the lees and dregs of the Grapes, which they grip’d over and over again, might and main, with their clench’d Fists. They were call’d Contractors, in the Language of the Countrey: These are the ugliest, mishapen, grim-look’d Scrubbs, said Fryar Jhon, that ever were beheld with or without Spectacles. Then we pass’d by an infinite number of little pimping Wine-presses, all full of Vintage-mongers, who were picking, examining, and raking the Grapes with some Instruments call’d Bills of Charge. Finally, We came into a Hall down Stairs, where we saw an overgrown curst mangy Curr with a pair of Heads, a Wolf’s Belly, and Claws like the Devil of Hell. The Son of a Bitch was fed with Cost, for he liv’d on a Mulciplicity of Fine Amonds, and Amerciaments, by Order of their Worships, to each of whom the Monster was worth more than the best Farm in the Land. In their Tongue of Ignorance, they call’d him Twofold. His Dam lay by him, and her hair and shape was like her Whelp’s; only she had four Heads two Male, and two Female, and her Name was Fourfold. She was certainly the most curs’d and dangerous Creature of the place, except her Grandam, that had been kept lockt up in a Dungeon, time out of mind, and her Name was Refusing of Fees. Fryar Jhon, who had always twenty yards of Gut ready empty, to swallow a Gallimaufry of Lawyers, began to be somewhat out of humour, and desir’d Pantagruel to remember he had not din’d, and bring Double-fee along with him. So, away we went; and as we march’d out at the Back-gate, whom should we meet but an old piece of Mortality in Chains; he was half Ignorant, and half Learned, like an Hermaphrodite of Satan. The Fellow was all caparison’d with Spectacles, as a Tortoise is with Shells, and liv’d on nothing but a sort of Food, which, in their Gibberish, was call’d Appeals. Pantagruel ask’d Double-fee, of what Breed was that Prothonotary, and what Name they gave him? Double-fee told us, that, time out of mind, he had been kept there in Chains, to the great Grief of their Worships, who starv’d him; and his Name was Review. By the Pope’s sanctify’d Two-pounders, cry’d Fryar Jhon, I don’t much wonder at the meager Cheer which this old Chuff finds among their Worships, do but look a little on the weather-beaten Scratch Toby, Friend Panurge; by the sacred Tip of my Cowle, I’ll lay Five Pounds to a Hazel-Nutt, the foul Thief has the very Looks of Gripe-me-now. These same Fellows here, ignorant as they be, are as sharp and knowing as other Folk. But were it my Case, I’d send him packing with a Squib in his Breech, like a Rogue enough as he is. By my oriental Barnicles, quoth Panurge, honest Fryar, thou’rt in the Right; for if we but examin that treacherous Review’s ill-favour’d Phiz, we find that the filthy Snudge is yet more mischievous and ignorant than these Ignorant Wretches here; since they (honest Dunces!) grapple and glean with as little harm and pother as they can, without any long Fiddle-come-farts or Tantalizing in the Case; nor do they dally and demur in your Suit, but, in two or three words, whip-stitch, in a trice, they finish the Vintage of the Close, bating you all those damn’d tedious Inter-locutories, Examinations and Appointments, which frets to the hearts-blood your Furr’d Law-cats. * * * * plus Valeur.

"– Sus donc, enfants, dit Pantagruel, commençons à marcher. »","“Come on, children,” said Pantagruel, “let us begin to walk. »","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.",Up then my lads (said Pantagruel) and let us march along.

We were reminded, however, that it was proper for them to do so, since their intention was to castigate fortune.","‘That order,’ said Panurge, ‘runs counter to the judgement of Cicero and the Academics, according to which Virtue takes precedence over Fortune.’ But they contended that they were acting rightly, since their intention was to fustigate Fortuna.",Fry.

"– C’est dit Panurge, ce que l’on dit en proverbe commun :","– It is said Panurge, what we say in common proverb:","‘That,’ said Panurge, ‘is what is stated in a popular saying:","Thus Atlas and Hercules clubb’d to raise and underprop the falling Sky, if you’ll believe the wise Mythologists; but they rais’d it some half an inch too high; Atlas to entertain his Guest Hercules more pleasantly, and Hercules to make himself amends for the thirst which sometime before had tormented him in the Deserts of Africa.—Your good Father, said Fryar Jhon, interrupting him, takes care to free many People from such an inconveniency; for I have been told by many venerable Doctors, that his chief Butler Turelupin saves above eighteen hundred Pipes of Wine yearly, to make Servants and all comers and goers drink before they are a dry.—As the Camels and Dromedaries of a Caravan, continued Pantagruel, use to drink for the thirst that’s past, for the present, and for that to come, so did Hercules; and being thus excessively rais’d, this gave a new motion to the Sky, which is that of Titubation and Trepidation, about which our crack-brain’d Astrologers make such a pother.—This, said Panurge, makes the saying good,"
"– Voire, dit Panurge, car je n’avais point dîné.","“Even,” said Panurge, “for I had not dined.","‘True,’ said Panurge, ‘for I hadn’t eaten!’","Yea, (quoth Panurge) the reason of that was, because I had fasted too long."
"– Fête-Dieu Bayard ! dit le moine, l’enfermier[13] de notre abbaye n’a donc la tête bien cuite, car il a les yeux rouges comme un jadeau[14] de vergne[15] !... Cette cuisse de levraut est bonne pour les goutteux... À propos truelle, pourquoi est-ce que les cuisses d’une damoiselle sont toujours fraîches ?","– Corpus Christi Bayard! said the monk, the locker[13] of our abbey is therefore not well cooked, because his eyes are red like a jadeau[14] of vergne[15]!... This leg of levraut is good for the gouty... By the way trowel, why are a damsel's thighs always fresh?",‘Corpus Bayard!’ said the Monk; ‘the hospitaller in our Abbey must have his head very underdone: his eyes are as red as an alder-wood bowl.] ‘This leveret’s thigh is good for the gout. Talking of wood: how is it that a damsel’s thighs are always cool?’,"(said the Monk) Because (said Gymnast) they have no Cooks to dresse them; and if they be not competently made ready, they remaine red and not white, the rednesse of meats being a token that they have not got enough of the fire, whether by boyling, rosting or otherwise, except the shrimps, lobsters, crabs and crayfishes, which are cardinalised with boyling: by Gods feast-gazers (said the Monk) the Porter of our Abbey then hath not his head wellboyled, for his eyes are as red as a mazer made of an alder-tree. The thigh of this leveret, is good for those that have the gout. To the purpose of the truel, what is the reason that the thighs of a Gentlewoman are alwayes fresh and coole: This Probleme (said Gargantua) is neither in Aristotle, in Alexander Aphrodiseus, nor in Plutarch."
"En laquelle heure fut appelé par Eudémon pour souper, car tout était prêt : « Je m’en vais donc, dit-il, pisser mon malheur. » Lors pissa si copieusement que l’urine trancha le chemin aux pèlerins, et furent contraints passer la grande boire[18]. Passants de là par l’orée[19] de la touche[20] en plein chemin, tombèrent tous, excepté Fourmilier, en une trappe qu’on avait fait pour prendre les loups à la traînée[21], dont échappèrent moyennant l’industrie dudit Fourmilier, qui rompit tous les lacs et cordages. De là issus, pour le reste de celle nuit, couchèrent en une loge près le Coudray, et là furent réconfortés de leur malheur par les bonnes paroles d’un de leur compagnie, nommé Lasdaller, lequel leur remontra que cette aventure avait été prédite par David, Psal :","At which hour was called by Eudémon for supper, for everything was ready: “I am going, then, he said, to piss off my misfortune. Then pissed so copiously that the urine cut off the path of the pilgrims, and they were forced to pass the great drink. Passing from there by the edge[19] of the key[20] in the middle of the road, all fell, except Fourmilier, into a trap that had been made to catch the wolves by drag[21], from which they escaped by means of the industry of the said Anteater, which broke all the lakes and ropes. Thence issued, for the remainder of that night, slept in a lodge near the Coudray, and there were comforted in their misfortune by the good words of one of their company, named Lasdaller, who showed them that this adventure had been foretold by David, Psal:","At that same moment, since everything was ready, Gargantua was called to supper by Eudemon and said, ‘I shall go and piss away my misery.’ He then pissed so copiously that his urine cut off the pilgrims’ route and they were obliged to cross a great ditch. Following the line of the clump of trees called La Touche, every one of them, save Fournillier, tumbled into a trap set in the middle of the path to catch wolves. They escaped thanks to hard work by Fournillier, who tore through the ropes and cords. Once extricated, they lay down for the rest of that night in a hut near Le Coudray. There they were much comforted in their afflictions by the good words of one of their company named Weary-legs, who proved to them that this trial of theirs had been foretold by David in a Psalm:","The Pilgrims thus dislodged ran away athwart the Plain a pretty fast pace, and the paine ceased, even just at the time when by Eudemon he was called to supper, for all was ready. I will go then (said he) and pisse away my misfortune; which he did do in such a copious measure, that the urine, taking away the feet from the Pilgrims, they were carried along with the stream unto the bank of a tuft of trees: upon which, assoon as they had taken footing, and that for their self-preservation they had run a little out of the road, they on a sudden fell all six, except Fourniller, into a trap that had been made to take wolves by a train: out of which neverthelesse they escaped by the industry of the said Fourniller, who broke all the snares and ropes. Being gone from thence, they lay all the rest of that night in a lodge near unto Coudry, where they were comforted in their miseries, by the gracious words of one of their company, called Sweertogo, who shewed them that this adventure had been foretold by the Prophet David, Psalm."
"Pantagruel, après la petite accolade et barretade[8] gracieuse, avant ouvrir les lettres ni autres propos tenir à Malicorne, lui demanda : « Avez-vous ici le gozal[9], céleste messager ?","Pantagruel, after the graceful little hug and barretade[8], before opening the letters or other remarks to Malicorne, asked him: ""Have you here the gozal[9], celestial messenger?","Pantagruel, after a brief embrace and a graciously doffed bonnet, asked – before opening the letter or addressing any other words to Malicorne – ‘Have you brought with you the gozal, that messenger from the skies?’ – ‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘it is kept hooded inside this pannier.’","When Malicorn had Saluted Pantagruel, before the Prince opened the Letters, the first thing he said to him, was, Have you here the Gozal, the Heavenly Messenger?"
"En sa compagnie n’était un seul homme. Toute sa garde et toutes ses forces étaient de Bassarides, Evantes, Evhyades, Edonides, Triéthérides, Ogygies, Mimallones, Ménades, Thyades et Bacchides[12], femmes forcenées[13], furieuses, enragées, ceintes de dragons et serpents vifs en lieu de ceintures, les cheveux voletants en l’air, avec fronteaux de vignes ; vêtues de peaux de cerfs et de chèvres, portants en main petites haches, thyrses, rancons[14] et hallebardes en forme de noix de pin, et certains petits boucliers légers, sonnants et bruyants quand on y touchait, tant peu fût, desquels elles usaient, quand besoin était, comme de tambourins et de tymbons[15]. Le nombre d’icelles était septante et neuf mille deux cents vingt-sept. L’avant-garde était menée par Silénus, homme auquel il avait sa fiance[16] totale, et duquel par le passé avait la vertu et magnanimité de courage et prudence en divers endroits connu. C’était un petit vieillard tremblant, courbé, gras, ventru à plein bât, et les oreilles avait grandes et droites, le nez pointu et aquilin, et les sourcilles rudes et grandes, était monté sur un âne couillard, en son poing tenait pour soi appuyer un bâton, pour aussi galantement combattre, si par cas convenait descendre en pieds, et était vêtu d’une robe jaune à usage de femme. Sa compagnie était de jeunes gens champêtres, cornus comme chevreaux et cruels comme lions, tous nus, toujours chantants et dansants les cordaces[17]. On les appelait Tityres et Satyres. Le nombre était octante cinq mille six-vingts et treize.","In his company was only one man. All his guard and all his forces were of Bassarides, Evantes, Evhyades, Edonides, Triéthérides, Ogygies, Mimallones, Ménades, Thyades and Bacchides[12], frenzied women[13], furious, enraged, girded with dragons and living serpents in place of sashes, hair fluttering in the air, with frontlets of vines; clad in the skins of stags and goats, carrying in their hands small axes, thyrses, ransoms[14] and halberds in the shape of pine nuts, and certain small light shields, ringing and noisy when touched, so little was, of which they used, when need was, like tambourines and tymbons[15]. The number of them was seventy and nine thousand two hundred and twenty-seven. The vanguard was led by Silénus, a man to whom he had his complete fiance[16], and of whom in the past had the virtue and magnanimity of courage and prudence in various places known. He was a trembling little old man, bent, fat, pot-bellied at full speed, and the ears were big and straight, the nose pointed and aquiline, and the eyebrows rough and big, was mounted on a cowardly donkey, in his fist held for himself leaning on a stick, to fight as gallantly, if by case it was appropriate to descend on foot, and was dressed in a yellow dress for women's wear. His company was young country folk, horned as goats and cruel as lions, all naked, always singing and dancing the cordaces. They were called Tityres and Satyrs. The number was eighty five thousand sixty and thirteen.","And on his feet he wore gilded buskins. In his fighting-force there was no man: his whole guard and soldiery consisted of Bassarides, Evantes, Euhyades, Edonides, Trietherides, Ogygiae, Mimallones, Maenads, Thyades and Bacchides, who are raving, raging frenzied women, with belts of live snakes and serpents rather than girdles, with their hair flying in the wind, bands of vine-leaves on their foreheads and clad in the skins of stags and goats; in their hands they wield axes, thyrses, bill-hooks, halberds shaped like pineapples, and special, light little bucklers which clanged and resounded when they were struck ever so lightly, which they used when necessary as tambourines and cymbals. They numbered seventy-nine thousand, two hundred and twenty-seven. The vanguard was led by Silenus, a man who had in the past gained his complete confidence and whose manly virtue, magnanimity, courage and wisdom he had witnessed on several situations. He was a shaky, bent little old man, fat, with sagging guts, big straight ears, a pointed aquiline nose and huge shaggy eyebrows ; he rode astride a well-hung ass; in his hand he held a stick for support and also to fight with gallantly if ever it were appropriate to dismount; he was dressed in a yellow garment such as women wear. His unit was composed of young country lads, horned like goats and cruel as lions, quite naked, always singing and dancing lascivious dances: they were called Tityri and Satyrs. They numbered eighty-five thousand, six-score and thirteen.","He had not one Man with him, that look’d like a Man; his Guards, and all his Forces consisted wholly of Bassarides, Evantes, Euhyades, Edonides, Trietherides, Ogygiœ, Mimallonides, Mœnades, Thyiades, and Bacchœ; frantick, raving, raging, furious, mad Women, begirt with live Snakes and Serpents, instead of Girdles, dischevell’d, their Hair flowing about their Shoulders, with Garlands of Vine-branches instead of Forehead-cloaths, clad with Stags or Goat’s Skins, and arm’d with Torches, Javelins, Spears, and Halberts, whose ends were like Pine-apples; besides they had certain small light Bucklers, that gave a loud sound if you touch’d ’em never so little, and these serv’d them instead of Drums; they were just Seventy nine thousand two hundred twenty seven. Silenus, who led the Van, was one on whom Bacchus rely’d very much, having formerly had many Proofs of his Valour and Conduct; he was a diminutive, stooping, palsied, plumb, gorbellied, old Fellow, with a swindging pair of stiff-standing Lugs of his own, a sharp Roman Nose, large, rough Eye-brows, mounted on a well-hung Ass: in his Fist he held a Staff to lean upon, and also bravely to Fight, whenever he had occasion to alight; and he was drest in a Woman’s yellow Gown. His Followers were all young, wild, clownish People, as hornified as so many Kids, and as fell as so many Tigers, naked and perpetually singing and dancing Country-dances; they were call’d Tityri and Satyrs; and were in all Eighty five thousand one hundred thirty three."

"« Cette narration, dit Pantagruel, semblerait joyeuse, ne fût que devant nos yeux faut la crainte de Dieu continuellement avoir.","“This narration, says Pantagruel, would seem joyous, were it only before our eyes we must continually fear God.","This Fourth Book of Pantagruel is still confronting the problem of the comedy of cruelty. The previous chapters have been full of laughter, yet how is laughter at pain and death to be reconciled with morality? Pantagruel, no agelast, does not laugh here, nor anywhere else until the very last page of the book. Nor did Frère Jean simply laugh at the end of Chapter 8, citing Scripture to make his point. Here Pantagruel starts off by alluding to Romans 3:18 or its source in Psalm 36. He does not cite it textually but turns a limited condemnation – ‘There is no fear of God before their eyes’ – into a general commandment. ‘To land someone with the monk “by the feet”‘ usually means to trick him while asleep by tying a string to his toe.] ‘That tale,’ said Pantagruel, ‘might seem funny were it not that we should ever have the fear of God before our eyes.’","THIS Story would seem pleasant enough, said Pantagruel, were we not to have always the fear of God before our Eyes."

Do you feel importunately in your body the pricks of the flesh?","Père Hippothadée, at the bidding of Pantagruel and to the respectful acclaim of those present, answered with unbelievable modesty: ‘Beloved, you have asked me for counsel, but first of all you must seek counsel from yourself.

"Un jour, je trouvai Panurge quelque peu écorné[1] et taciturne et me doutai bien qu’il n’avait denare[2], dont je lui dis : « Panurge, vous êtes malade à ce que je vois à votre physionomie, et j’entends le mal : vous avez un flux de bourse ; mais ne vous souciez ; j’ai encore « six sols et maille qui ne virent oncq[3] père ni mère », qui ne vous faudront[4] non plus que la vérole, en votre nécessité. » À quoi il me répondit : « Et bren[5] pour l’argent, je n’en aurai quelque jour que trop, car j’ai une pierre philosophale qui m’attire l’argent des bourses comme l’aimant attire le fer.

I have yet seven pence half penny, that never saw father nor mother, which shall not be wanting, no more than the pox in your necessity: whereunto he answered me, Well, well, for money one day I shall have but too much; for I have a Philosophers stone, which attracts money out of mens purses, as the adamant doth iron; but will you go with me to gaine the pardons, said he?

For from the day and time that you showed that you cared not a fig for the Pope all this land was adjudicated, consigned and relinquished to us. But sowing wheat is not my métier: I shall therefore allow you to use the land, but on condition that we share the yield.’","This same Devil being got thither, directed his Discourse to the Husband-man, and ask’d him what he was doing. The poor Man told him, that he was Sowing this ground with Corn to help him to subsist the next Year.

II, Saturnal.","And if no one blames them for making them rataconniculate [16] thus on their fat, since the beasts on their bellies never endure the masculating male, they will answer that they are stupid, but they are women, well hearing the beautiful and joyful petty rights of superfluity, as Populie once replied, according to the report of Macrobe, lib. II, Saturnal.","And if anyone should reproach them for getting country-bumboated on top of their pregnancies, seeing that the dumb beasts never tolerate the mating male once their bellies are swollen, they will retort that those are beasts whereas they are women, fully cognizant of the happy little rigid rights of superfetation (as Populia once retorted, according to Macrobius in Book Two of the Saturnalia). If the divel does not want them to get pregnant, then one must twist the vent-pegs off tight – and keep mum. How Gargamelle, when carrying Gargantua, took to eating [a great profusion of] tripe CHAPTER 4","When she is known to have conceived, thrust forward boldly, spare her not, whatever betide you, seeing the paunch is full; as Julia the daughter of the Emperour Octavian never prostituted her self to her belly-bumpers, but when she found her self with childe, after the manner of Ships that receive not their steersman, till they have their ballast and lading; and if any blame them for this their rataconniculation, and reiterated lechery upon their pregnancy and big bellednesse, seeing beasts in the like exigent of their fullnesse, will never suffer the male-masculant to incroach them: their answer will be, that those are beasts, but they are women, very well skilled in the pretty vales, and small fees of the pleasant trade and mysteries of superfetation: as Populius heretofore answered, according to the relation of Macrobius lib. 2. Saturnal."

"« Entendez-vous rien là ? » dit Pantagruel ès assistants.

"La reine était vêtue de cristallin[6] vierge, par art de tauchie[7] et ouvrage damasquin, passementé de gros diamants. Les lanternes du sang étaient vêtues aucunes de strain[8], autres de pierres phengites[9] ; le demeurant était de corne, de papier, de toile cirée. Les falots pareillement, selon leurs états d’antiquité de leur maisons. Seulement j’en avisai une de terre comme un pot, en rang des plus gorgiases[10]. De ce m’ébahissant, entendis que c’était la lanterne d’Épictétus, de laquelle on avait autrefois refusé trois mille drachmes.","The queen was dressed in crystalline[6] virgin, by art of tauchie[7] and damascene work, trimmed with large diamonds.

Only I noticed one of the earth like a pot, in a row of the most gorgiases[10]. From this amazed me, heard that it was the lantern of Epictetus, from which they had formerly refused three thousand drachmas.","The queen was dressed in clear crystal and in encrusted damask-work studded with great diamonds. Lanterns of the blood-royal were clad either in translucent stones or paste; the others were clad in horn, paper or oiled cloth. The same applied to the Falots, the Fire-baskets, according to their rank and the antiquity of their families. I noticed only one made of earthenware: she, who looked like a pot, ranked amongst the most gorgeous. Astonished by it, I learnt that she was the Lantern of Epictetus; they had once refused to part with her for three thousand drachmas.","The bright Queen was dress’d in Virgin Christal of Tutia, wrought Damask-wise and beset with large Diamonds. The Lanterns of the Royal Blood, were clad partly with Bastard-diamonds, partly with Diaphanous Stones, the rest with Horn, Paper, and Oyl’d-cloath.

28. Comment par Pantagruel fut un monstrueux physétère[1] aperçu près l’île Farouche,28. How by Pantagruel was a monstrous physetera [1] sighted near Farouche Island,"Since which time she spawned the Aping-males, Bigot-tails and Bacon-pappers, the maniacal little Pistols, the demoniacal Calvins (the impostors of Geneva) as well as the raging Putrid-herbs and the Mendicant Greedy-gutses, the Black-beetles, the Sycophants, the Cannibals and other monsters deformed and distorted from contempt for Nature. How Pantagruel descried a monstrous Physeter near the Ile Farouche CHAPTER 33 [The name of this island (which means something like Wild Island) is inspired by the Disciple de Pantagruel. A leap from mystic fable to apparent reality. A physeter (‘blower’ in Greek, a word adopted also in Latin) is the cachalot of Pliny, which was differentiated from the smaller, better-known whale. Rabelais could well have seen it illustrated, differentiated from a whale, on the Carta Marina of Olaus Magnus (1539). The play on words over the name of Perseus is again in the spirit of Plato’s Cratylus, soon to be specifically mentioned (in Chapter 37). The original pun Perseus and Percé jus (pierced down) is kept as far as proved possible in English. The Pythagorean Y is the moral Y. ( One of the arms of the moral Y is much broader than the other, facing the traveller with a choice: the broad arm leads to vice; the strait, to virtue. That aspect of the Pythagorean Y is scarcely relevant here, but we may be being prepared for the renewed interest in Pythagorean doctrines in Chapter 37. The line ‘celebrated flame-vomiting steeds of the Sun is a quotation from the first-century Latin poet Corippus. The fear and superstition of Panurge are again to the fore. There is a confused memory of the drowning of George Duke of Clarence in a butt of Malmsey.]","If he Doz’d, it was Leases of Lands. What is yet more strange, he us’d to work doing Nothing, and did nothing, tho’ he work’d; Carous’d Sleeping, and slept carousing, with his Eyes open like the Hares in our Country, for fear of being taken Napping by the Chitterlings his inveterate Enemies; Biting he Laugh’d, and laughing bit; Eat nothing Fasting, and fasted eating nothing; mumbled upon Suspicion, drank by Imagination; Swam on the tops of high Steeples, dry’d his Clothes in Ponds and Rivers; Fish’d in the Air, and there us’d to catch Decumane Lobsters; Hunted at the bottom of the Herring-Pond, and caught their Ibices, Stamboucs, Shamois, and other wild Goats; us’d to put out the Eyes of all the Crows which he took sneakingly; fear’d nothing but his own shadow, and the cries of fat Kids; us’d to gad abroad some days like a Truant School-boy; play’d with the Ropes of Bells on Festival days of Saints; made a Mallet of his fist, and writ on hairy Parchment Prognostications and Almanacks with his huge Pincase. Is that the Gentleman, said Fryar Jhon, he is my Man: this is the very Fellow I lookt for ; I’ll send him a Challenge immediately. This is, said Pantagruel, a strange and monstrous sort of a Man, if I may call him a Man. You put me in mind of the Form and Looks of Amodunt and Dissonance. How were they made, said Fryar Jhon? may I be peel’d like a raw Onion if ever I heard a word of them. I’ll tell you what I read of them in some ancient Apologues, reply’d Pantagruel."

"– O mon ami ! dit Pantagruel, sais-tu bien ce que dit Agésilas quand on lui demanda pourquoi la grande cité de Lacédémone n’était ceinte de murailles ?

Ainsi cette ville est si forte par la multitude du peuple belliqueux qui est dedans, qu’ils ne se soucient de faire autres murailles. Davantage[5], qui la voudrait emmurailler comme Strasbourg, Orléans ou Ferrare, il ne serait possible, tant les frais et dépens seraient excessifs.","– O my friend! said Pantagruel, do you know what Agesilaus said when he was asked why the great city of Lacedaemon was not surrounded by walls? For, showing the inhabitants and citizens of the city so expert in military discipline, and so strong and well armed: ""Behold,"" said he, ""the walls of the city,"" meaning that it is a wall of bones , and that towns and cities could not have a safer and stronger wall than the virtue[4] of the citizens and inhabitants. So this city is so strong by the multitude of warlike people who are in it, that they do not care to build other walls. More [5], who would want to wall it up like Strasbourg, Orléans or Ferrara, it would not be possible, as the costs and expenses would be excessive.","Poor and undone it needs work on his last. But – for the worst part of its accident – The Sun, before it shines in Occident Will let the darkness circle it around, Deep as eclipse or veiled nights daily round ; So, at one blow, ‘twill lose its liberty,","O my friend (said Pantagruel) doest thou know what Agesilaus said, when he was asked, Why the great City of Lacedemon was not inclosed with walls?

"Les Milanais s’étaient contre lui absent rebellés, et avaient l’impératrice sa femme chassé hors la ville, ignominieusement montée sur une vieille mule nommée Thacor, à chevauchons de rebours, savoir est le cul tourné vers la tête de la mule et la face vers la croupière. Frédéric, à son retour, les ayant subjugués et resserrés, fit telle diligence qu’il recouvra[4] la célèbre mule Thacor. Adonc, au milieu du grand Brouet[5], par son ordonnance, le bourreau mit ès membres honteux de Thacor une figue, présents et voyants les citadins captifs ; puis cria, de par l’empereur, à son de trompe, que quiconque d’iceux voudrait la mort évader, arrachât publiquement la figué avec les dents, puis la remit on[6] propre lieu sans aide des mains. Quiconque en ferait refus serait sur l’instant pendu et étranglé. Aucuns[7] d’iceux eurent honte et horreur de telle tant abominable amende, la postposèrent[8] à la crainte de mort, et furent pendus. Ès autres la crainte de mort domina sur telle honte. Iceux, avoir à belles dents tiré la figue, la montraient au boye[9], apertement[10], disant : « Ecco lo fico ». En pareille ignominie, le reste de ces pauvres et désolés Gaillardets furent de mort garantis et sauvés, furent faits esclaves et tributaires, et leur fut imposé le nom de Papefigues, parce qu’au portrait papal avaient fait la figue. Depuis celui temps, les pauvres gens n’avaient prospéré. Tous les ans avaient grêle, tempête, famine et tout malheur, comme éterne[11] punition du péché de leurs ancêtres et parents.","The Milanese had rebelled against him absent, and had the Empress his wife chased out of town, ignominiously mounted on an old mule named Thacor, riding backwards, knowing is the ass turned towards the head of the mule and the face towards the croupier. Frederick, on his return, having subjugated and tightened them, was so diligent that he recovered [4] the famous mule Thacor. So, in the middle of the great Brouet[5], by his ordinance, the executioner placed in the shameful limbs of Thacor a fig, present and seeing the captive townspeople; then cried, by the emperor, with a trumpet sound, that whosoever of them would escape death, publicly tear out the fig with their teeth, and then put it back in their own place without help of hands. Anyone refusing would be immediately hanged and strangled. Some [7] of them were ashamed and horrified by such an abominable fine, postponed it [8] for fear of death, and were hanged. In others the fear of death prevailed over such shame. Iceux, having with great teeth pulled the fig out, showed it to the boye[9], bitterly[10], saying: “Ecco lo fico”. In similar ignominy, the rest of these poor and desolate Gaillardets were guaranteed and saved from death, were made slaves and tributaries, and the name of Papefigues was imposed on them, because the papal portrait had made the fig. Since that time, the poor people had not prospered. Every year had hail, storm, famine and all misfortune, as eternal[11] punishment for the sin of their ancestors and parents.","It was during his absence that the Milanese had rebelled against him and hounded the Empress his wife from the city, mounted to shame her on an ancient mule called Thacor, sitting astride and backwards (that is, with her bottom turned towards the mule’s head and her face towards its crupper). On his return Federigo, having subjugated the rebels and locked them up, diligently traced and recovered Thacor, the famous mule. Then, in the midst of the great market-place at Milan, by his command, the hangman placed a fig in Thacor’s private parts, the captive citizens all being there to see it. Then, to the sound of the trumpet, he cried in the name of the emperor that whosoever amongst them wished to escape death should, in public, extract that fig with his teeth and replace it, all without using his hands. Whosoever refused would, on the instant, be hanged and throttled. Some of them felt such shame and horror at so abominable a penalty that they feared death less than that and so were hanged. In others the fear of death overpowered their sense of shame. When they displayed to the hangman the fig which they had pulled out with their bare teeth, they said, Ecco lo fico (‘Behold the Fig’). The remnant of those wretched and desolate Gaillardets, saved and protected from death by a similar public disgrace, were turned into slaves and payers of tribute, and upon them was imposed the name of Papefigues, because they had cocked a fig at the papal portrait. From that time forth those wretched folk have never prospered: every year since then they have had hailstorms, tempests, plagues, famines and every sort of disaster, as an everlasting punishment for the sin of their forebears and kinsmen.","These had rebell’d against him in his absence, and ignominiously turn’d the Empress out of the City, mounting her a Horse-back on a Mule call’d Thacor, with her Breech foremost towards the Old jaded Mule’s head, and her Face turn’d towards the Crupper. Now Frederick being return’d, master’d them, and caus’d so careful a Search to be made, that he found out, and got the famous Mule Thacor. Then the Hangman, by his Order, clap’d a Fig into the Mule’s Jimcrack, in the Presence of the inslav’d Citts that were brought into the middle of the great Market-Place, and proclaim’d, in the Emperor’s Name, with Trumpets, That whosoever of them would save his own Life, should publickly pull the Fig out with his Teeth, and after that put it in again in the very individual Cranny whence he had draw’d it, without using his hands; and that whoever refused to do this, should presently swing for ’t, and die in his Shoes. Some sturdy Fools, standing upon their Punctilio, chose Honourably to be hang’d, rather than submit to so shameful, and abominable a Disgrace; and others, less nice in Point of Ceremony, took heart of Grace, and ev’n resolv’d to have at the Fig, and a Fig for ’t, rather than make a worse Figure with a hempen Collar, and die in the Air, at so short Warning: accordingly, when they had neatly pick’d out the Fig with their Teeth from old Thacor’s Snatchblatch, they plainly show’d it the Heads-man, saying, Ecco lo Fico! (behold the Fig.) By the same Ignominy the rest of these poor distress’d Gaillardets sav’d their Bacon, becoming Tributaries and Slaves, and the Name of Pope-Figs was given them, because they had said, A Fig for the Pope’s Image. Since this, the poor Wretches never prosper’d, but every Year the Devil was at their Doors, and they were plagu’d with Hail, Storms, Famine and all manner of Woes, as an everlasting Punishment for the Sin of their Ancestors and Relations."
"Cette défaite parachevée, Pantagruel fut bien joyeux et loua merveilleusement l’industrie de ses compagnons, et les fit rafraîchir et bien repaître sur le rivage joyeusement, et boire d’autant[10] le ventre contre terre, et leur prisonnier avec eux familièrement, sinon que le pauvre diable n’était point assuré que Pantagruel ne le dévorât tout entier, ce qu’il eût fait, tant avait la gorge large, aussi facilement que feriez un grain de dragée, et ne lui eût monté en sa bouche en plus qu’un grain de millet en la gueule d’un âne.","This defeat completed, Pantagruel was very happy and marvelously praised the industry of his companions, and made them refresh and feed well on the shore joyfully, and drink as much[10] with their stomachs on the ground, and their prisoner with them familiarly, except that the poor devil was by no means certain that Pantagruel would not devour him entirely, which he would have done, his throat being so wide, as easily as a grain of sugared almond would do, and would not have risen to his mouth in addition. than a grain of millet in the mouth of a donkey.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","The exploit being ended, Pantagruel was very jovial, and wondrously commended the industry of these Gentlemen, whom he called his fellow-souldiers, and made them refresh themselves, and feed well and merrily upon the sea-shore, and drink heartily with their bellies upon the ground, and their prisoner with them, whom they admitted to that familiarity: only that the poor devil was somewhat afraid that Pantagruel would have eaten him up whole, which, considering the widenesse of his mouth, and capacity of his throat, was no great matter for him to have done; for he could have done it, as easily as you would eate a small comfit, he shewing no more in his throat, then would a graine of millet-seed in the mouth of an Asse."

46. Comment Homenas donna à Pantagruel des poires de bon christian,46. How Homenas gave Pantagruel good christian pears,"CHAPTER 54 [For the echo of Virgil in the third paragraph compare the poem at the end of the Third Book. The anti-papalist convictions of Father Rabelais have just been revealed as being as absolute as those of the later Luther. During his time in Metz after the Third Book Rabelais had read a Latin version of Luther’s harsh but effective satire Against the Popedome of Rome, Constructed by the Devil. From it he took the phrase Bon Christian (‘Good Christians’, a plural though it looks singular). For Luther the term ‘Good Christians’ is a sarcastic one, applied to simple, gullible, exploitable ‘papist’ folk by cynical men in the Vatican who themselves believe nothing and believe in nothing. Having read these chapters, one can understand why Cardinal de Châtillon eventually crossed the Channel to a royally reformed Church, for it is inconceivable that Rabelais would have written so boldly without the clear, prior, public support he enjoyed. Poires de bon chrétien (‘Good-Christian’pears) were, and are, excellent pears, but poire in French can also mean a booby. With the word ‘catastrophe’, already taken from Erasmus, Rabelais again emphasizes the dramatic, farcical conception of these chapters. Rabelais draws on another adage of Erasmus: (II, III, V, ‘He calls a fig a fig, a hoe a hoe’. It is applied to simple folk who tell things as they are. Here and throughout the Fourth Book Pantagruel is portrayed as a model of princely pantagruelism, wise, charitable and tolerant.]",CHAPTER LIV How Homenas gave Pantagruel some Bon-Christian Pears.
"– Non autrement, répondit Homenas. Nous sommes simples gens, puisqu’il plaît à Dieu, et appelons les ’figues figues, les prunes prunes, et les poires poires.","""Not otherwise,"" answered Homenas. We are simple people, since it pleases God, and call 'figs figs, plums plums, and pears pears.","‘Just pears,’ replied Homenaz. ‘ Since it so pleases God we are simple folk. We call figs figs, plums plums, and pears pears.’","No otherwise than you’ve heard, reply’d Homenas; we are a plain down-right sort of People, as God would have it, and call Figs, Figs; Plumbs, Plumbs; and Pears, Pears."

When I was got upon the knap of a little hillock, not farre off, I turned me about as did Lots wife, and looking back, saw all the City burning in a faire fire, whereat I was so glad, that I had almost beshit my selfe for joy: but God punished me well for it:"

"– Sans cause, dirent-ils, nous vous avons sur ce différend interrogés, car grand nombre d’autres ont ici passé de votre pays de Touraine, lesquels nous semblaient bons lourdauds et parlaient correct ; mais d’autres pays sont ici venus, ne savons quels outrecuidés, fiers comme Écossais, qui contre nous à l’entrée voulaient obstinément contester. Ils ont été bien frottés, quoiqu’ils montrâssent visage rubarbatif[6]. En votre monde avez-vous si grande superfluité de temps que ne savez en quoi l’employer, fors ainsi de notre dame reine parler, disputer, et impudentement écrire ? Il était bien besoin que Cicéron abandonnât sa république pour s’en empêcher[7], et Diogènes Laërtius, et Théodorus Gaza, et Argyropile, et Bessarion, et Politian, et Budé, et Lascaris, et tous les diables de sages fols, le nombre desquels n’était assez grand s’il n’eût été récentement accru par Scaliger, Brigot, Chambrier, François Fleury, et ne sais quels autres tels jeunes hères émouchetés.

They were well rubbed, although they showed a ruddy countenance. In your world, do you have so much superfluity of time that you do not know how to use it, so that our Lady Queen speaks, argues, and writes impudently? It was necessary for Cicero to abandon his republic to prevent it[7], and Diogenes Laërtius, and Theodorus Gaza, and Argyropile, and Bessarion, and Politian, and Budé, and Lascaris, and all the devils of foolish sages, the number of which would not have been large enough if it had not been recently increased by Scaliger, Brigot, Chambrier, Francois Fleury, and who knows what other such spotted young hounds.

Have you such a great superfluity of leisure time in that world of yours that you have no idea how to spend it except by impudently talking, arguing and writing thus about our Sovereign Lady?

"– C’est, dit Pantagruel, juste heure de dîner, car la sacre ligne tant célébrée par Aristophanes en sa comédie intitulée les Prédicantes approche, laquelle lors échoit quand l’ombre est décempédale[6]. Jadis entre les Perses l’heure de prendre réfection était ès rois seulement prescrite : à un chacun autre était l’appétit et le ventre pour horologe. De fait, en Plaute, certain parasite soi complaint[7], et déteste[8] furieusement les inventeurs d’horologes et cadrans, étant chose notoire qu’il n’est horologe plus juste que le ventre. Diogènes, interrogé à quelle heure doit l’homme repaître, répondit : « Le riche quand il aura faim, le pauvre quand il aura de quoi. » Plus proprement disent les médecins l’heure canonique[9] être :","“It is,” said Pantagruel, “just dinner time, for the sacred line so much celebrated by Aristophanes in his comedy entitled Les Prédicantes is approaching, which then falls when the shadow is decempedal[6]. Formerly among the Persians the hour of taking refreshment was only prescribed to kings: to each other was the appetite and the stomach for horology. In fact, in Plautus, a certain parasite self-complains[7], and hates[8] furiously the inventors of clocks and dials, it being well known that there is no clock fairer than the belly. Diogenes, questioned at what time man should feed, replied: “The rich when he is hungry, the poor when he has enough. More properly, doctors say the canonical hour[9] is:","‘That,’ said Pantagruel, ‘is the right time for dinner. For the hallowed line approaches (made so famous by Aristophanes in his comedy The Ecclesiazousae) when the shadow falls on the tenth point of the sundial. Long ago in Persia a specific time to take his food was prescribed for the king alone: belly and appetite were everyone else’s clock. In fact a certain hanger-on in Plautus loathes and madly detests the inventors of timepieces and sundials, since it is notorious that there is no clock more accurate than the belly.71 ‘Diogenes, when asked at what time a man should eat, replied: “ The rich when hungry: the poor man when he can. ”72 The physicians more correctly say that canonical rule is: Up at five: break fast at nine;","Tis then the best time to go to Dinner, said Pantagruel, for the sacred Line so celebrated by Aristophanes in his Play call’d Concionatores, is at hand, never failing when the shadow is decempedal. Formerly among the Persians Dinner-time was at a set hour only for Kings; as for all others, their Appetite and their Belly was their Clock; when that chim’d, they thought it time to go to Dinner. So we find in Plautus a certain Parasite making a heavy do, and sadly railing at the Inventors of Hour-glasses and Dials, as being unnecessary things, there being no Clock more regular than the Belly. Diogenes being ask’d at what times a Man ought to eat, answer’d, The Rich when he is hungry, the Poor when he has any thing to eat. Physicians more properly say, that the Canonical Hours are, To rise at five, to dine at nine, To sup at five, to sleep at nine."

Dont j’ai connu que Dieu éternel l’a laissé au gouvernail de son franc arbitre et propre sens, qui ne peut être que méchant si par grâce divine n’est continuellement guidé, et, pour le contenir en office[9] et réduire à connaissance me l’a ici envoyé à molestes[10] enseignes.","""I did my best to moderate his tyrannical anger, offering him everything I thought I could please him, and several times amicably sent to him to hear in what, by whom and how he felt outraged. ; but from him I had no answer but voluntary distrust[7], and that in my lands he only claimed the right of propriety[8].

"« Puis me torchai d’une poule, d’un coq, d’un poulet, de la peau d’un veau, d’un lièvre, d’un pigeon, d’un cormoran, d’un sac d’avocat, d’une barbute[25], d’une coiffe, d’un leurre[26].","“Then I wiped myself with a hen, a rooster, a chicken, the skin of a calf, a hare, a pigeon, a cormorant, a bag of avocado, a barbute[25], a headdress, a lure[26].","‘Then I wiped my bum on a hen, a cock, a pullet, on calf-skin, on the pelt of a hare, on a pigeon, a cormorant, a lawyer’s bundle, a woollen hood, a night-cap and a stuffed decoy-bird.","Afterwards I wiped my taile with a hen, with a cock, with a pullet, with a calves skin, with a hare, with a pigeon, with a cormorant, with an Atturneyes bag, with a montero, with a coife, with a faulconers lure; but, to conclude, I say and maintain, that of all torcheculs, arsewisps, bumfodders, tail-napkins, bung-hole cleansers and wipe-breeches, there is none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose, that is well douned, if you hold her head betwixt your legs; and beleeve me therein upon mine honour, for you will thereby feele in your nockhole a most wonderful pleasure, both in regard of the softnesse of the said doune, and of the temperate heat of the goose, which is easily communicated to the bum-gut, and the rest of the inwards, insofarre as to come even to the regions of the heart and braines; And think not, that the felicity of the heroes and demi-gods in the Elysian fields consisteth either in their Asphodele, Ambrosia, or Nectar, as our old women here used to say; but in this, (according to my judgement) that they wipe their tailes with the neck of a goose, holding her head betwixt their legs, and such is the opinion of Master John of Scotland, aliàs Scotus."

"Lors nous mena en un petit pressoir qui était caché sur . le derrière, que l’on appelait en langage de l’île, Pithies[9]. Là ne demandez pas si maître Jean se traita, et Panurge, car saucissons de Milan, coqs d’Inde, chapons, outardes, malvoisie et toutes bonnes viandes[10] étaient prêtes et fort bien accoutrées[11]. Un petit bouteiller, voyant que frère Jean avait donné une œillade amoureuse sur une bouteille qui était près d’un buffet, séparée de la troupe bouteillique, dit à Pantagruel : « Monsieur, je vois que l’un de vos gens fait l’amour à cette bouteille : je vous supplie bien fort qu’il n’y soit touché, car c’est pour Messieurs.","Then led us to a small wine press which was hidden on . the back, which was called in the language of the island, Pithies[9]. There, do not ask if Master Jean treated himself, and Panurge, because Milan sausages, turkeys, capons, bustards, Malmsey and all good meats[10] were ready and very well dressed[11]. A little bottler, seeing that Brother Jean had given a loving glance at a bottle which was near a sideboard, separated from the bottle troupe, said to Pantagruel: ""Monsieur, I see that one of your people is making love to this bottle: I beg you very much that it is not touched, because it is for gentlemen.","He then said to Pantagruel that beds were much cheaper here than in the Chinonais, despite our having the celebrated Pautille geese, since that old woman had merely asked five dozen pence for a bed which in the Chinonais would fetch a dozen francs at least.12","CHAPTER XXII How Queen Whim’s Officers were employ’d; and how the said Lady retain’d us among her Abstractors. I THEN saw a great number of the Queen’s Officers, who made Black-a-moors white, as fast as Hops, just rubbing their Bellies with the Bottom of a Pannier. Others with three Couples of Foxes in one Yoke, plow’d a Sandy-shoar, and did not lose their Seed. Others wash’d burnt Tiles, and made them lose their Colour. Others extracted Water out of Pumice-Stones, braying them a good while in a Mortar, and chang’d their substance. Others sheer’d Asses, and thus got Long-fleece-wooll. Others gather’d Barberries and Figs off of Thistles. Others stroak’d He-goats by the Dugs, and sav’d their Milk in a Sieve; and much they got by it. Others taught Cows to dance, and did not lose their fidling. Others pitch’d Nets to catch the Wind, and took Cock-lobsters in them. I saw a young Spodizator, who very artificially got Farts out of a dead Ass, and sold ’em for five pence an Ell."
"– Meilleure, dit Épistémon, serait, si la pluie de ces jeunes gantelets fût sur le gras prieur tombée.

Punches would have aptly circled[2] his shaved head, awaiting the enormous concussion that we see today[3] between these queer judges[4] under the elm tree. How did those poor Chicano devils offend?","‘It would have been better,’ said Epistemon, ‘if the blows from those young gauntlets had rained on that fat prior. He was laying out cash for his own amusement, partly to annoy Basché and partly to see his Chicanous beaten up. Blows from fists would have aptly bedight his tonsured pate, considering the violent extortions we see today amongst those puisne judges under the elm. What wrong had those poor devils of Chicanous ever done?’]","It had been better, said Epistemon, if those Gantlets had fallen upon the fat Prior: Since he took a pleasure in spending his Mony, partly to vex Basché, partly to see those Catchpoles bang’d, good lusty thumps would have done well on his shav’d Crown, considering the horrid Concussions now-a days among those puny Judges. What harm had done those poor Devils the Catchpoles."

"En cet état passa jusques à un an et dix mois, onquel[4] temps, par le conseil des médecins, on commença le porter, et fut faite une belle charrette à bœufs par l’invention de Jean Deniau. Dedans icelle on le promenait par ci par là, joyeusement, et le faisait bon voir, car il portait bonne trogne et avait presque dix et huit mentons, et ne criait que bien peu ; mais il se conchiait à toutes heures, car il était merveilleusement flegmatique des fesses, tant de sa complexion naturelle que de la disposition accidentale qui lui était advenue par trop humer de purée septembrale. Et n’en humait goutte sans cause, car s’il advenait qu’il fût dépit, courroucé, fâché ou marri, s’il trépignait, s’il pleurait, s’il criait, lui apportant à boire l’on le remettait en nature, et soudain demeurait coi et joyeux.","In this state passed until a year and ten months, when [4] time, by the council of the doctors, one began to carry it, and was made a beautiful cart with oxen by the invention of Jean Deniau. Inside it we walked him here and there, joyfully, and it was good to see him, because he had a good face and had almost ten or eight chins, and cried very little; but his buttocks were marvelously phlegmatic, both from his natural complexion and from the accidental disposition which had come to him from inhaling too much mashed potatoes. And sniffed a drop of it without cause, because if it happened that he was spiteful, wrathful, angry or hurt, if he stamped his feet, if he cried, if he shouted, bringing him something to drink, we put him back. in kind, and suddenly remained quiet and joyful.","Under that regimen he spent one year and ten months, at which time they decided on the advice of the physicians to transport him about, so a beautiful bull-cart was ingeniously constructed for him by Jean Denyau, in which they happily bore him hither and thither; he was a joy to behold, for he sported a fine dial and had all but eighteen chins. He hardly ever cried, but was always messing himself, since he was wondrously subject to phlegmatic mucous of the backside, partly because of his natural complexion and partly from an accidental disposition brought on by an excessive slurping of the juice of September. And not a drop did he slurp down without good cause, for if he should happen to be crotchety, fretful, irritable or grumpy, or if he threw himself about and cried and bawled, it was enough to bring him a drink to restore him to his natural state, and he immediately remained quiet and contented.","Thus was he handled for one yeare and ten moneths, after which time by the advice of Physicians, they began to carry him, and then was made for him a fine little cart drawn with Oxen, of the invention of Jan Denio, wherein they led him hither and thither with great joy, and he was worth the seeing; for he was a fine boy, had a burly physnomie, and almost ten chins; he cried very little, but beshit himself every hour: for to speak truly of him, he was wonderfully flegmatick in his posteriors, both by reason of his natural complexion, and the accidental disposition which had befallen him by his too much quaffing of the septembral juyce. Yet without a cause did not he sup one drop; for if he happened to be vexed, angry, displeased, or sorry; if he did fret, if he did weep, if he did cry, and what grievous quarter soever he kept, in bringing him some drink, he would be instantly pacified, reseated in his own temper, in a good humour againe, and as still and quiet as ever."

Le muet prétend et dénote que serez marié, cocu, battu et dérobé.","Panurge, in this anger, raised his fist to strike the mute, but he revered Pantagruel's presence and restrained himself. Then said Pantagruel: “If the signs anger you, o how [29] the things signified will anger you! All true to all true consonant[30]. The mute pretends and denotes that you will be married, cuckolded, beaten and robbed.","Panurge was angered by that and raised his fist to strike the mute, but out of respect for the presence of Pantagruel he held back. Pantagruel then said: ‘If the signs anger you, O how much more will the things they signify! Every truth is consonant with all other truths. ‘The mute means and claims that you will be married, cuckolded, beaten and robbed.’","This so incensed Panurge, that he forthwith lifted his Hand to have Strucken him the dumb Royster, and given him a sound whirret on the Ear, but that the respect and reverence which he carried to the Presence of Pantagruel restrained his Choler, and kept his Fury within bounds and limits. Then said Pantagruel, If the bare signs now vex and trouble you, how much more grievously will you be perplexed and disquieted with the real things, which by them are represented and signified? All Truths agree, and are consonant with one another; this dumb Fellow Prophesieth and Foretelleth that you will be married, cuckolded, beaten and robbed."
"– Seigneurs, dit Épistémon, nous n’entendons[6] tels termes.

But, please tell us who you mean, and we will tell you the truth without concealment.","‘Sirs,’ said Epistemon, ‘we do not understand your terms. But do please explain to us whom you mean and then we shall tell you the truth without any dissembling.’","Sirs, reply’d Epistemon, we do not understand those Terms; but if you will be pleas’d to let us know who you mean, we’ll tell you the truth of the matter without any more ado."

Then rubbed a corner of the ashes of a nest of swallows [4], to see if it was written with dew which one finds in the apples of Alicacabut [5]. Then rubbed another end of it over the sanity of the ears, to see if it was written in raven's gall. Then dipped it in vinegar, to see if it was written in purge milk. Then greased it with axong of bald mice, to see if it was written with whale sperm, which is called ambergris.

He rubbed after that one end with eare-waxe, to see if it were not written with the gall of a Raven: then did he dip it into vineger, to try if it was not written with the juice of the garden Spurge: After that he greased it with the fat of a bat or flitter-mouse, to see if it was not written with the sperm of a whale, which some call ambergris: Then put it very fairly into a basin full of fresh water, and forthwith took it out, to see whether it were written with stone-allum: But after all experiments, when he perceived that he could finde out nothing, he called the messenger, and asked him, Good fellow, the lady that sent thee hither, did she not give thee a staffe to bring with thee? thinking that it had been according to the conceit, whereof Aulus Gellius maketh mention, and the messenger answered him, No, Sir.

"Ce fait, le moine donne des éperons à son cheval, et poursuit la voie que tenaient les ennemis, lesquels avaient rencontré Gargantua et ses compagnons au grand chemin, et tant étaient diminués au nombre pour l’énorme meurtre qu’y avait fait Gargantua avec son grand arbre. Gymnaste, Ponocrates, Eudémon et les autres, qu’ils commençaient soi retirer à diligence, tous effrayés et perturbés[13] de sens et entendement comme s’ils vissent la propre espèce et forme de mort devant leurs yeux.

Gymnast, Ponocrates, Eudaemon and the others, whom they began to withdraw diligently, all frightened and disturbed[13] in sense and understanding as if they saw death's own kind and form before their eyes. And--as you see an ass, when it has a juniper cestre[14] in its ass, or a fly pointing at it[15], run hither and thither without way or path, throwing its load to the ground, breaking its brake and reins , without in any way breathing or taking rest, and one does not know who is moving it, for one does not see anything that touches it, – thus these people fled, devoid of senses, without knowing the reason to flee, so long only that a terror pursues them. panic, which had been conceived in their souls.","That done, the Monk gave his horse the spur and followed the route adopted by his enemies, who had encountered Gargantua and his comrades on the highway but were so reduced in number (by the huge slaughter wrought there by Gargantua with his great tree and by Gymnaste, Ponocrates, Eudemon and the others) that they were beginning to retreat in good earnest, all terrified, with their minds and their senses thrown into confusion, as though they had seen before their eyes the very species and form of Death. And – as you may see a donkey, when it is stung about the arse by a wasp or a Junonian gad-fly, dashing hither and thither, following nor path nor way, casting its load to the ground, yet no one knowing what is provoking it since no one sees anything goading it – thus fled those men, bereft of their senses, knowing not why they fled but solely pursued by a panic terror conceived in their minds.","And presently the Monk gave his horse the spurre, and kept the way that the enemy held, who had met with Gargantua and his companions in the broad highway, and were so diminished of their number, for the enormous slaughter that Gargantua had made with his great tree amongst them, as also Gymnast, Ponocrates, Eudemon, and the rest, that they began to retreat disorderly and in great haste, as men altogether affrighted and troubled in both sense and understanding; and, as if they had seen the very proper species and forme of death before their eyes; or rather as when you see an Asse with a brizze or gad-bee under his taile, or flie that stings him, run hither and thither without keeping any path or way, throwing down his load to the ground, breaking his bridle and reines, and taking no breath nor rest, and no man can tell what ailes him, for they see not any thing touch him: so fled these people destitute of wit, without knowing any cause of flying, only pursued by a panick terror, which in their mindes they had conceived."
"« Ce qui m’induit en cette opinion est que les planteurs de vigne à peine mangeaient raisins ou buvaient vin de leur labeur durant la première année, et les bâtisseurs, pour l’an premier, n’habitaient en leurs logis de nouveau faits, sur peine d’y mourir suffoqués par défaut d’expiration, comme doctement a noté Galen. lib. II, de la Difficulté de respirer. Je ne l’ai demandé sans cause bien causée, ni sans raison bien résonnante. Ne vous déplaise. »","“What leads me to this opinion is that the planters of vines scarcely ate grapes or drank the wine of their labor during the first year, and the builders, for the first year, did not live in their newly made dwellings, on pain of dying there suffocated for lack of expiration, as learnedly noted Galen. lib. II, Difficulty in breathing. I did not ask for it without a well-founded cause, nor without a very resonant reason. Don't mind. »","‘What brings me to my opinion is this: that first year planters of vines could scarcely have eaten any grapes nor drunk any wine from their labours; nor could builders live in their newly constructed houses during the first year without the risk of dying of suffocation from a shortage of breath (as Galen learnedly notes in Book Two of On Difficulties of Respiration). ‘If I asked you that, it was not without well-caused causation nor well-resonant reason.","Not Orisons nor Patrenotres Shall ever disorder my Brain: One Cadet, to the Field as he flutters, Is worth two when they end the Campaign. That which prompteth me to that Opinion, is, that the Vine-Planters did seldom eat of the Grapes, or drink of the Wine of their Labour, till the first Year was wholly elapsed: During all which time also the Builders did hardly inhabit their new structured Dwelling places, for fear of dying suffocated through want of Respiration; as Galen hath most learnedly remarked, in the Second Book of the Difficulty of Breathing.

An adage of Erasmus is alluded to: I, III, XII, ‘A woman of Thessaly’. Panurge’s (twisted) list of philosophers who profitably consulted women is shown up as laughable when it ends with Magister Noster Ortwinus, who was mocked in the satirical Letters of Obscure Men and by many humanists for his opposition to Reuchlin and the study of Hebrew.]",CHAPTER XVI How Pantagruel adviseth Panurge to consult with the Sibyl of Panzoust.
"« Je ne pensais, dit Pantagruel, jamais rencontrer homme tant obstiné à ses appréhensions[1] comme je vous vois. Pour toutefois votre doute éclaircir, suis d’avis que nous mouvons toute pierre. Entendez ma conception. Les cygnes, qui sont oiseaux sacrés à Apollo, ne chantent jamais, sinon quand ils approchent de leur mort, mêmement[2] en Méander, fleuve de Phrygie (je le dis pour ce que Ælianus et Alexander Myndius écrivent en avoir ailleurs vu plusieurs mourir, mais nul chanter en mourant), de mode que chant de cygne est présage certain de sa mort prochaine, et ne meurt que préalablement n’ait chanté. Semblablement, les poètes, qui sont en protection d’Apollo, approchants de leur mort, ordinairement deviennent prophètes, et chantent par apolline inspiration, vaticinants des choses futures.","“I never thought, says Pantagruel, that I would ever meet a man so obstinate in his apprehensions [1] as I see you. To clear up your doubt, however, I am of the opinion that we move every stone. Hear my design. The swans, which are sacred birds to Apollo, never sing, except when they approach their death, even [2] in Meander, river of Phrygia (I say it for what Ælianus and Alexander Myndius write to have seen several of them die elsewhere , but no one sings while dying), so that a swan's song is a certain omen of his approaching death, and dies only beforehand has sung. Likewise, the poets, who are in protection of Apollo, approaching their death, ordinarily become prophets, and sing by Apollon inspiration, chanting of future things.","Deuteronomy 31:29; Matthew 6:8; Revelation, 17:14, etc.). The name of Raminagrobis might suggest a fat-cat, a hypocrite, but Rabelais is showing that names can be misleading.] ‘I never ever expected to meet anyone as stubborn in his preconceptions as I see that you are,’ said Pantagruel. ‘Yet I am sure that we should leave no stone unturned to throw light on to your problem. Listen to my suggestion. ‘Swans, which are birds sacred to Apollo, never sing except when death approaches – specifically on the Meander, which is a Phrygian river (I add that because [Aelian and] Alexander Myndius write of having seen many die elsewhere but none die singing) – so that a swan’s song is a sure presage of its approaching death, and it will never die before it has sung. Poets, who are similarly under the protection of Apollo, normally turn prophetic as death approaches, singing under the inspiration of Apollo and foretelling things to come.","I NEVER thought (said Pantagruel) to have encountred with any Man so headstrong in his Apprehensions, or in his Opinions so wilful, as I have found you to be, and see you are. Nevertheless, the better to clear and extricate your Doubts, let us try all courses, and leave no stone unturn’d, nor wind unsailed by. Take good heed to what I am to say unto you, the Swans, which are Fouls consecrated to Apollo, never chant but in the hour of their approaching Death, especially in the Meander Flood, which is a River that runneth along some of the Territories of Phrygia. This I say, because Elianus and Alexander Myndius write, that they had seen several Swans in other Places die, but never heard any of them sing, or chant before their Death. However, it passeth for current, that the imminent death of a Swan is presaged by his foregoing Song, and that no Swan dieth until preallably he have Sung. After the same manner Poets, who are under the Protection of Apollo, when they are drawing near their latter end, do ordinarily become Prophets, and by the inspiration of that God sing sweetly, in vaticinating things which are to come."
"Et portait ordinairement un gros écritoire, pesant plus de sept mille quintaux, duquel le galimart[3] était aussi gros et grand que les gros piliers d’Enay, et le cornet y pendait à grosses chaînes de fer, à la capacité d’un tonneau de marchandise.","And usually carried a large writing desk, weighing more than seven thousand quintals, from which the galimart [3] was as large and tall as the large pillars of Enay, and the cornet hung there on large iron chains, to the capacity of a barrel of goods.","He normally lugged about a bulky writing-desk weighing more than seven thousand hundredweight. Its pen-and-pencil-box was as big and bulky as the great pillars in Saint-Martin d’Ainay; its ink-horn, which could hold a ton, dangled from it by great chains of iron.","the penner whereof was as big and as long, as the great pillars of Enay, and the horne was hanged to it in great iron chaines, it being of the widenesse of a tun of merchand ware."
"Le garbin[1] nous soufflait en poupe, quand montâmes en haute mer. Sur la déclination du soleil, fîmes escale en l’île de Chéli, île grande, fertile, riche et populeuse, en laquelle régnait le roi Saint-Panigon, lequel, accompagné de ses enfants et princes de sa cour, s’était transporté jusque près le havre pour recevoir Pantagruel et le mena jusques en son château. Sur l’entrée du donjon s’offrit, la reine, accompagnée de ses filles et dames de cour. Panigon voulut qu’elle et toute sa suite baisassent Pantagruel et ses gens. Telle était la courtoisie et coutume du pays, Ce que fut fait, excepté frère Jean, qui s’absenta et s’écarta parmi les officiers du roi. Panigon voulait, en toute instance, pour cetui jour et au lendemain, retenir Pantagruel. Pantagruel fonda son excuse sur la sérénité du temps et opportunité du vent, lequel plus souvent est désiré des voyagers que rencontré, et le faut emploiter[2] quand il advient, car il n’advient toutes et quantes fois qu’on le souhaite. À cette remontrance, après boire vingt et cinq ou trente fois par homme, Panigon nous donna congé.","The garbin[1] was blowing in our sails, when we went up to the high seas. On the decline of the sun, we stopped at the island of Cheli, a large, fertile, rich and populous island, in which reigned King Saint-Panigon, who , accompanied by his children and princes of his court, had come to near the harbor to receive Pantagruel and led him to his castle. At the entrance to the dungeon, the queen offered herself, accompanied by her daughters and ladies of the court. Panigon wanted her and all her retinue to fuck Pantagruel and his people. Such was the courtesy and custom of the country, which was done, except for Brother John, who absented himself and moved away among the king's officers. Panigon wanted, in any case, for this day and the next day, to retain Pantagruel. Pantagruel founded his excuse on the serenity of the weather and the expediency of the wind, which is more often desired by travelers than encountered, and must be used when it occurs, for it does not occur as many times as one wishes. At this remonstrance, after drinking twenty-five or thirty times a man, Panigon dismissed us.","The Garbin was blowing on our poop when, leaving behind those nasty Kinshippers each with a nose like an ace of clubs, we reached the high seas. Towards sundown we touched at the island of Cheli: a spacious, fertile, rich and well-populated island over which reigned the saintly King Panigon, who, accompanied by his sons and the princes of his Court, had processed towards the harbour so as to welcome Pantagruel and escort him to his castle. The Queen made her appearance above the tower gate accompanied by her daughter and the ladies of the Court. It was Panigon’s wish that she and all her suite should kiss Pantagruel and his men : such was the courteous custom of that country. Which was done, except in the case of Frère Jean, who had stood back and drawn apart with the officials of the King. Panigon pressed Pantagruel to stay on for that day and the next. Pantagruel grounded his refusal on the calmness of the weather and on the favourable wind, which is more often desired by seafarers than acquired: it must be exploited whenever it comes, for it does not always come when you want it to. After such an appeal Panigon gave us his congee, but not before each man had downed some twenty-five to thirty drinks.","WE had still the Wind at South South West, and had been a whole day without making Land. On the third day at the Flyes up-rising, which, you know, is some two or three hours after the Sun’s, we got sight of a Triangular Island, very much like Sicily for its Form and Situation. It was called the Island of Alliances. The People there are much like your Carrot-pated Poitevins, save only that all of them, Men, Women, and Children, have their Noses shap’d like an Ace of Clubs. For that reason the ancient Name of the Country was Ennasin. There were all akin, as the Mayor of the place told us, at least they boasted so. You People of the other World, esteem it a wonderful thing, that, out of the Family of the Fabii at Rome, on a certain day, which was the 13th of February, at a certain Gate, which was the Porta Carmentalis, since nam’d Scelerata, formerly situated at the foot of the Capitol, between the Tarpeian Rock and the Tyber, March’d out against the Veientes of Etruria, three hundred and six Men bearing Arms, all related to each other, with five thousand other Soldiers every one of them their Vassals, who were all slain near the River Cremera, that comes out of the Lake of Beccano. Now from this same Country of Ennasin in case of need, above three hundred thousand all Relations, and of one Family, might March out. Their degrees of Consanguinity and Alliance are very strange, for being thus akin and allied to one another, we found that none was either Father or Mother, Brother or Sister, Uncle or Aunt, Nephew or Neece, Son-in-Law or Daughter-in-Law, God-Father or God-Mother to the other, unless truly, a tall flatnos’d old fellow, who, as I perceiv’d, call’d a little shitten ars’d Girl of three or four years old, Father, and the Child call’d him Daughter."
"Un jour que l’on avait assigné à tous les théologiens se trouver en Sorbonne pour grabeler[2] les articles de la foi, il fit une tarte bourbonnaise composée de force d’ails, de galbanum, d’assa fœtida, de castoreum, d’étrons tout chauds, et la détrempa en sanie de bosses chancreuses, et de fort bon matin engraissa et oignit théologalement tout le treillis de Sorbonne en sorte que le diable n’y eût pas duré Et tous ces bonnes gens rendaient là leurs gorges devant tout le monde, comme s’ils eussent écorché le renard, et en mourut dix ou douze de peste, quatorze en furent ladres, dix et huit en furent pouacres[3] et plus de vingt et sept en eurent la vérole, mais il ne s’en souciait mie.","One day when all the theologians had been assigned to be in the Sorbonne to grab[2] the articles of faith, he made a Bourbonnaise tart composed of garlic, galbanum, asa foetida, castoreum, of hot turds, and soaked it in sanies of cankered bumps, and very early in the morning fattened and theologically anointed all the trellis of the Sorbonne so that the devil would not have lasted there And all these good people gave up their throats there in front of everyone, as if they had flayed the fox, and ten or twelve died of plague, fourteen of them were ladres, ten and eight of them were poachers[3] and more than twenty and seven had the pox, but he did not cared about it.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","One day that they were appointed all to meet in the fodder-street, he made a Borbonesa tart, or filthy and slovenly compound, made of store of garlick, of Assa fœtida, of Castoreum, of dogs turds very warm, which he steeped, temper’d and liquifi’d in the corrupt matter of pockie biles, and pestiferous botches, and, very early in the morning, therewith anointed all the pavement, in such sort, that the devil could not have endured it, which made all these good people, there to lay up their gorges and vomit what was upon their stomacks before all the world, as if they had flayed the fox; and ten or twelve of them died of the plague, fourteen became lepers, eighteen grew lousie, and above seven and twenty had the pox, but he did not care a button for it."
Ηματι χεν τριτατω Φθιην εριβωλον ιχοιμην,Ηματι χεν τριτατω Φθιην εριβωλον ιχοιμην,"In fair and fertile Phthia the third day foresaw that he would die three days later and said so to Aeschines [as Plato wrote in the Crito, Cicero in the first book of On Divination, and Diogenes Laertius also; – witness Opilius Macrinus, to whom fell by lot the following judgement from Iliad, 8, when he yearned to know whether he would be the emperor of Rome : Ω γέϱον ή μAλα δή σε νέοι τεIϱουσι μαχηταI Σή δέ βIη λέλυται χαλεπOν δέ σε γήρας σπAζει","The like is also witnessed by Opilius Macrinus, to whom, being desirous to know if he should be the Roman Emperor, befell, by chance of Lot, this Sentence in the Eighth of the Iliads, Ω γέρον, μάλα δή σε νέοι τείρουσι μαχηταί, Σὴ δὲ βίη λέλνται, χαλεπὸν δέ σε γῆρας ὀπάζει."

"– Le saint Envoyé, dit Hippothadée, me semble l’avoir plus apertement[10] déclaré quand il dit : « Ceux qui sont mariés soient comme non mariés : ceux qui ont femme soient comme non ayant femme. »","– The holy Messenger, says Hippothadeus, seems to me to have declared it more boldly[10] when he said: “Those who are married are as if they were not married: those who have a wife are as if they were not having a wife. »","‘The Holy Envoy seems to rae to have put that more clearly,’ said Hippothadée, ‘when he says, “Let those that are married be as not married; those that have a wife be as though having her not.”’","The holy Apostle, (quoth Hippothadee) seemeth, as I conceive, to have more clearly explained this Point, when he said, Those that are married, let them be as if they were not married; and those that have Wives, let them be as if they had no Wives at all."
"Telle était l’usance des nobles Gargantua et Pantagruel, quand savoir promptement nouvelles de quelque chose fort affectée[13] et véhémentement désirée, comme l’issue de quelque bataille, tant par mer comme par terre, la prise ou défense de quelque place forte, l’appointement[14] de quelques différends d’importance, l’accouchement heureux ou infortuné de quelque reine ou grande dame, la mort ou convalescence de leurs amis et alliés malades, et ainsi des autres. Ils prenaient le gozal, et par les postes le faisaient de main en main jusques sur les lieux porter dont ils affectaient[15] les nouvelles. Le gozal, portant bandelette noire ou blanche selon les occurences et accidents, les ôtait de pensemen[16] à son retour, faisant en une heure plus de chemin par l’air que n’avaient fait par terre trente postes en un jour naturel. Cela était racheter et gagner temps. Et croyez comme chose vraisemblable que, par les colombiers de leurs cassines[17], on trouvait sur œufs ou petits, tous les mois et saisons de l’an, les pigeons à foison, ce qu’est facile en ménagerie[18], moyennant le salpêtre en roche et la sacrée herbe verveine.","Such was the custom of the noble Gargantua and Pantagruel, when to hear promptly news of something much affected[13] and vehemently desired, as the issue of some battle, whether by sea or by land, the capture or defense of some stronghold , the appointment[14] of some disputes of importance, the happy or unfortunate childbirth of some queen or great lady, the death or convalescence of their sick friends and allies, and so on of others. They took the gozal, and by post they carried it from hand to hand to the places to carry the news of which they assigned[15]. The gozal, wearing black or white bandages according to occurrences and accidents, removed them from his thoughts[16] on his return, making in one hour more distance by air than thirty posts on the ground had made in a natural day. It was redeeming and gaining time. And believe as a probable thing that, by the dovecotes of their cassines[17], one found on eggs or young, all the months and seasons of the year, the pigeons in abundance, which is easy in a menagerie[18], by means of rock saltpeter and the sacred verbena herb.","Such was the practice of noble Gargantua and Pantagruel whenever they wanted to have news quickly of something eagerly coveted and intensely desired, such as the outcome of a battle on land or sea, the storming or the defending of some fortress, the settling of some vital quarrel, the happy or unhappy delivery of a queen or some great lady, the death or cure of sick friends or allies, and so on. They would take the gozal and have it borne from hand to hand, from post to post, to the places from which they wanted news. The gozal bore a black or a white band depending on events and outcomes and, once it returned, freed them from anxiety, flying a greater distance in one hour than a succession of thirty post-riders could cover in a typical day. That really is to gain and save time! And you should accept as quite credible that you could find eggs or chicks in the dovecots of their estates during all the months and seasons of the year, and plenty of pigeons. That is something easy to arrange in a household by using rock-salt and the ‘sacred boughs’ of verbena.","This was the Custom of the noble Gargantua and Pantagruel, when they would have speedy News of something of great Concern, as the event of some Battel either by Sea or Land; the surrendring or holding out of some strong Place; the determination of some difference of Moment; the safe or unhappy Delivery of some Queen or great Lady; the Death or Recovery of their sick Friends or Allies, and so forth. They used to take the Gozal, and had it carried from one to another by the Post, to the Places whence they desir’d to have News. The Gozal bearing either a black or white Ribbon, according to the Occurrences and Accidents, us’d to remove their doubts at its return, making in the space of one hour, more way through the Air, than thirty Post-Boys could have done in one natural day. May not this be said to redeem and gain time with a vengeance, think you? For the like Service therefore, you may believe as a most true thing, that, in the Dove-Houses of their Farms, there were to be found all the Year long, store of Pigeons hatching Eggs or rearing their young. Which may be easily done in Aviaries and Voleries, by the help of Saltpeter and the sacred Herb Vervain."

My pleaders similarly of themselves declined their last goal of pleading, because their purses were empty, of themselves ceased to pursue and solicit, no longer was Aubert in the trenches [16] to solicit and pursue.","according to the gloss (and also to Bartholus) on Law 3, paragraph, “If anyone”; Pandects: “Of Conditions for Causes”; and in the Authentica, “Of Nuptials”, paragraph, “ But what has been sanctioned”, collation 4. ‘“Dendin, my son,” said Perrin, “you must act differently. You really must: When must in a law comes, never, never doubt Whatever it says is to be carried out. as in the gloss, Codex: ‘Of Appeals’, the Law, ‘Even they’. ‘ “That’s not where the hare’s hidden. You never settle any differences, lad? And why? Because you take them at the beginning when they are still green and immature. I settle them all. And why? Because I take them towards the end of their growth, quite à point and digestible. And so the gloss states: ‘Sweeter ripe fruit through many hazards grown’; see: the law, ‘He not about to die’, Codex, ‘On Contracts and the Transmission of Obligations’. ‘“Do you not know what that popular proverb says: Happy the physician called in when the illness wanes? The illness had spontaneously passed its crisis; even if a physician never arrived on the scene it was drawing to its end. So too those litigants of mine were spontaneously wilting before the last stage of their lawsuit, for their purses were empty. They were spontaneously ceasing to plead and prosecute. There was not a bean left in their bag for pleading and prosecuting.","ob caus. , et autent. , de Nup. , § Sed quod sancitum, Coll. iiij.

"« À Paris, en la rôtisserie du petit Châtelet, au devant de l’ouvroir d’un rôtisseur, un faquin[13] mangeait son pain à la fumée du rôt, et le trouvait, ainsi parfumé, grandement savoureux. Le rôtisseur le laissait faire. Enfin, quand tout le pain fut bâfré, le rôtisseur happe le faquin au collet et voulait qu’il lui payât la fumée de son rôt. Le faquin disait en rien n’avoir ses viandes endommagé, rien n’avoir du sien pris, en rien ne lui être débiteur.","""In Paris, in the rotisserie of the Petit Châtelet, in front of a roaster's workroom, a rascal [13] ate his bread in the smoke of the roast, and found it, thus perfumed, greatly tasty. The roaster let him. Finally, when all the bread was guzzled, the roaster grabbed the rascal by the collar and wanted him to pay him for the smoke from his roast. The rascal said in no way that he had damaged his meat, had taken nothing of his, and in no way was indebted to him.","‘In Paris, at the area of the Petit Châtelet where meats are roasted, a porter’s boy, in front of the booth of a certain roasting-cook was eating his bread to the smell of the roast and found his bread thus flavoured to be hugely delicious. The cook allowed him to do so, but in the end, once all the bread was gobbled up, he grabbed the boy by the collar and tried to make him pay him for the smell of his roast. The porter’s boy said he had in no way harmed his meats; he had taken nothing of his and owed him nothing.","At Paris, in the Roast-meat Cookery of the Petit Chastelet, before the Cook-shop of one of the Roast-meat Sellers of that Lane, a certain hungry Porter was eating his Bread, after he had by Parcels kept it a while above the Reek and Steam of a fat Goose on the Spit, turning at a great Fire, and found it so besmoaked with the Vapour, to be savoury; which the Cook observing, took no notice, till after having ravined his Penny Loaf, whereof no Morsel had been unsmoakified, he was about discamping and going away; but by your leave, as the Fellow thought to have departed thence shot-free, the Master-Cook laid hold upon him by the Gorget, demanded payment for the Smoak of his Roast-meat. The Porter answered, that he had sustained no loss at all; that by what he had done there was no Diminution made of the Flesh, that he had taken nothing of his, and that therefore he was not indebted to him in any thing: As for the Smoak in question, that, although he had not been there, it would howsoever have been evaporated: Besides that, before that time it had never been seen nor heard, that Roast-meat Smoak was sold upon the Streets of Paris."
"Alors manda savoir de cet affaire, et trouva pour vrai qu’on avait pris par force quelques fouaces de ses gens, et que Marquet avait reçu un coup de tribard[2] sur la tête, toutefois que le tout avait été bien payé et que le dit Marquet avait premier[3] blessé Frogier de son fouet par les jambes, et sembla à tout son conseil qu’en toute force il se devait défendre.","So asked to know about this affair, and found it true that some fouaces had been taken by force from his people, and that Marquet had received a blow from the tribard [2] on the head, however that the whole thing had been well paid and that the said Marquet had first[3] wounded Frogier with his whip through the legs, and seemed to all his council that he had to defend himself with all his might.","So he sent to find out about the matter and discovered that it was indeed true that a few fouaces had been forcibly taken from Picrochole’s subjects; that Marquet had suffered a blow on the head from a cudgel; that all had nevertheless been properly paid for, and that the said Marquet had injured Forgier first by whipping him about the legs.","the matter throughly, before I resolve any more upon what is to be done; then sent he to learn concerning that businesse, and found by true information, that his men had taken violently some cakes from Picrocholes people, and that Marquets head was broken with a slackie or short cudgel: that neverthelesse all was well paid, and that the said Marquet had first hurt Forgier with a stroke of his whip athwart the legs; and it seemed good to his whole counsel, that he should defend himself with all his might."
"Jouxte la rivière était le beau jardin de plaisance ; au milieu d’icelui, le beau labyrinthe. Entre les deux autres tours étaient les jeux de paume et de grosse balle. Du côté de la tour Crière était le verger, plein de tous arbres fruitiers, toutes ordonnées en ordre quinconce. Au bout était le grand parc, foisonnant en toute sauvagine[5]. Entre les tierces tours étaient les buttes pour l’arquebuse, l’arc et l’arbalète. Les offices, hors la tour Hespérie, à simple étage. L’écurie au-delà des offices. La fauconnerie au-devant d’icelles, gouvernée par asturciers[6] bien experts en l’art, et était annuellement fournie par les Candiens, Vénitiens et Sarmates, de toutes sortes d’oiseaux paragons[7], aigles, gerfauts, autours, sacres, laniers, faucons, éperviers, émerillons et autres, tant bien faits et domestiqués que, partants du château pour s’ébattre ès champs, prenaient tout ce que rencontraient. La vénerie était un peu plus loin, tirant vers le parc.","Adjoining the river was the beautiful Pleasure Garden; in the middle of it, the beautiful labyrinth. Between the other two rounds were the palm and big ball games. On the side of the Crière tower was the orchard, full of all fruit trees, all arranged in quincunx order. At the end was the large park, teeming with waterfowl[5]. Between the third towers were the mounds for the arquebus, the bow and the crossbow. The offices, excluding the Hespérie tower, on a single floor. The stable beyond the offices. The falconry in front of icelles, governed by asturciers[6] well skilled in the art, and was annually supplied by the Candians, Venetians and Sarmatians, with all kinds of paragon birds[7], eagles, gyrfalcons, goshawks , sakers, laners, hawks, sparrowhawks, swivels and others, so well made and domesticated that, leaving the castle to frolic in the fields, took everything they encountered. The venery was a little further, pulling towards the park.","Come not here-in , ye lawyers with tight fists, Nor clerk, nor legist who poor plaintiffs cogs, Scribes, Pharisees, new tortuous canonists, Doddering judges fighting in the lists ’Gainst parish-folk to tie them up like dogs.","By the river-side was the faire garden of pleasure: and in the midst of that the glorious labyrinth. Between the two other towers were the Courts for the tennis and the baloon. Towards the tower Criere stood the Orchard full of all fruit-trees, set and ranged in a quincuncial order. At the end of that was the great Park, abounding with all sort of Venison. Betwixt the third couple of towers were the buts and marks for shooting with a snap-work gun, an ordinary bowe for common archery, or with a Crosse-bowe. The office-houses were without the tower Hesperie, of one story high. The stables were beyond the offices, and before them stood the falconrie, managed by Ostridge-keepers and Falconers, very expert in the Art, and it was yearly supplied and furnished by the Candians, Venetians, Sarmates (now called Moscoviters) with all sorts of most excellent hawks, eagles, gerfalcons, gosehawkes, sacres, lanners, falcons, sparhawks, Marlins, and other kindes of them, so gentle and perfectly well manned, that flying of themselves sometimes from the Castle for their own disport, they would not faile to catch whatever they encountred. The Venerie where the Beagles and Hounds were kept, was a little farther off drawing towards the Park. All the halls, chambers, and closets or cabinets, were richly hung with tapestrie, and hangings of divers sorts, according to the variety of the seasons of the year. All the pavements and floors were covered with green cloth: the beds were all embroidered: in every back-chamber or withdrawing room there was a looking-glasse of pure crystal set in a frame of fine gold, garnished all about with pearles, and was of such greatnesse, that it would represent to the full the whole lineaments and proportion of the person that stood before it. At the going out of the halls, which belong to the Ladies lodgings, were the perfumers and trimmers, through whose hands the gallants past when they were to visit the Ladies; those sweet Artificers did every morning furnish the Ladies chambers with the spirit of roses, orange-flower-water and Angelica; and to each of them gave a little precious casket vapouring forth the most odoriferous exhalations of the choicest aromatical sents. CHAPTER LVI How the men and women of the religious order of Theleme were apparelled. THE Ladies at the foundation of this order, were apparelled after their own pleasure and liking: but since that of their own accord and free will they have reformed themselves, their accoutrement is in manner as followeth. They wore stockins of scarlet crimson, or ingrained purple die, which reached just three inches above the knee, having a list beautified with exquisite embroideries, and rare incisions of the Cutters Art. Their garters were of the colour of their bracelets, and circled the knee a little, both over and under. Their shoes, pumps and slippers were either of red, violet, or crimson-velvet, pinked and jagged like Lobster wadles. Next to their smock they put on the pretty kirtle or vasquin of pure silk chamlet: above that went the taffatie or tabie vardingale, of white, red, tawnie, gray, or any other colour; Above this taffatie petticoat they had another of cloth of tissue or brocado, embroidered with fine gold, and interlaced with needlework, or as they thought good, and according to the temperature and disposition of the weather, had their upper coats of sattin, damask or velvet, and those either orange, tawnie, green, ash-coloured, blew, yelow, bright red, crimson or white, and so forth; or had them of cloth of gold, cloth of silver, or some other choise stuffe, inriched with purle, or embroidered according to the dignity of the festival dayes and times wherein they wore them. Their gownes being still correspondent to the season, were either of cloth of gold frizled with a silver-raised work; of red sattin, covered with gold purle: of tabie, or taffatie, white, blew, black, tawnie, &c, of silk serge, silk chamlot, velvet, cloth of silver, silver tissue, cloth of gold, gold wire, figured velvet, or figured sattin tinselled and overcast with golden threads, in divers variously purfled draughts. In the summer some dayes in stead of gowns they wore light handsome mantles, made either of the stuffe of the aforesaid attire, or like Moresco rugs, of violet velvet frizled, with a raised work of gold upon silver purle: or with a knotted cord-work of gold embroiderie, every where garnished with little Indian pearles. They alwayes carried a faire Pannache, or plume of feathers, of the colour of their muffe, bravely adorned and tricked out with glistering spangles of gold. In the winter-time they had their taffatie gownes of all colours, as above-named: and those lined with the rich furrings of hinde-wolves, or speckled linxes, black-spotted weesils, martlet-skins of Calabria, sables, and other costly furres of an inestimable value. Their beads, rings, bracelets, collars, carcanets and neck-chaines were all of precious stones, such as carbuncles, rubies, baleus, diamonds, saphirs, emeralds, turkoises, garnets, agates, berilles, and excellent margarits. Their head-dressing also varied with the season of the yeare, according to which they decked themselves."
"– Ha ! dit la vieille, il m’a dit, le bourreau, le tyran, l’égratigneur de diables, qu’il avait hui[7] assignation de se gratter avec vous.

Withdraw, please. »","He told me – that hangman, that bully, that clawer of devils! – that he had an appointment to claw it out with you this very day.

And he’s just gone to the blacksmith’s to have his claws pointed up and sharpened. Monsieur le Diable: you’ve had it, my friend. Save yourself. Nothing can stop him. Get away, I beseech you.’","Alas, cry’d the old Dissembler, he told me, the Butcher, the Tyrant, the Tearer of Devils, that he had made a match to scratch with you this Day, and to try his Clawes, he did but just touch me with his little Finger, here betwixt the Legs, and has spoyl’d me for ever.

Alas, you are undone, Mr. Devil; good Sir, scamper quickly, I am sure he won’t stay; save your self, I beseech you; while she said this, she uncover’d her self up to the Chin, after the manner in which the Persian Women met their Children, who fled from the Fight, and plainly shew’d her What de’e call them."
"Au milieu de la basse-cour était une fontaine magnifique, de bel albâtre ; au dessus, les trois Grâces, avec cornes d’abondance, et jetaient l’eau par les mamelles, bouche, oreilles, yeux et autres ouvertures du corps. Le dedans du logis sur ladite basse-cour était sur gros piliers de cassidoine[1] et porphyre, à beaux arcs d’antique, au dedans desquels étaient belles galeries longues et amples, ornées de peintures et cornes de cerfs, licornes, rhinocéros, hippopotames, dents d’éléphants, et autres choses spectables[2]. Le logis des dames comprenait depuis la tour Artice jusques à la porte Mésembrine. Les hommes occupaient le reste. Devant ledit logis des dames, afin qu’elles eussent l’ébattement, entre les deux premières tours, au dehors, étaient les lices, l’hippodrome, le théâtre et natatoires[3], avec les bains mirifiques à triple solier[4], bien garnis de tous assortiments et foison d’eau de myrrhe.","In the middle of the lower court was a magnificent fountain, of fine alabaster; above, the three Graces, with cornucopias, and spouting water through the breasts, mouth, ears, eyes and other openings of the body.

The ladies' dwelling comprised from the Artice tower to the Mésembrine gate. The men occupied the rest. In front of the said dwelling of the ladies, so that they could enjoy themselves, between the first two towers, outside, were the lists, the hippodrome, the theater and swimming pools[3], with the wonderful baths with triple soliers[4] , well stocked with all sorts and plenty of myrrh water.",Would bring faithlessness; And all your badness My song’s praise abates.

CHAPTER LV What manner of dwelling the Thelemites had. IN the middle of the lower Court there was a stately fountain of faire Alabaster; upon the top thereof stood the three Graces, with their cornucopias, or hornes of abundance, and did jert out the water at their breasts, mouth, eares, eyes, and other open passages of the body; the inside of the buildings in this lower Court stood upon great pillars of Cassydonie stone, and Porphyrie marble, made arch-wayes after a goodly antick fashion. Within those were spacious galleries, long and large, adorned with curious pictures, the hornes of Bucks and Unicornes: with Rhinoceroses, water-horses called Hippopotames, the teeth and tusks of Elephants, and other things well worth the beholding. The lodging of the Ladies (for so we may call those gallant women) took up all from the tower Arctick unto the gate Mesembrine: the men possessed the rest. Before the said lodging of the Ladies, that they might have their recreation, between the two first towers, on the out-side, were placed the tilt-yard, the barriers or lists for turnements, the hippodrome or riding Court, the theater or publike play-house, and Natatorie or place to swim in, with most admirable bathes in three stages, situated above one another, well furnished with all necessary accommodation, and store of myrtle-water."
"– Je damerai[13] cette-ci, dit Panurge, vous racontant ce que Breton Villandry répondit un jour au seigneur duc de Guise. Leur propos était de quelque bataille du roi François contre l’empereur Charles cinquième, en laquelle Breton était gorgiasement[14] armé, mêmement de grèves et solerets[15] acérés, monté aussi à l’avantage[16], n’avait toutefois été vu au combat. « Par ma foi, répondit Breton, j’y ai été, facile me sera le prouver, voire en lieu onquel vous n’eussiez osé vous trouver. » Le seigneur duc prenant en mal cette parole, comme trop brave et trop témérairement proférée, et se haussant de propos, Breton facilement en grande risée l’apaisa, disant : « j’étais avec le bagage, onquel lieu votre honneur n’eût porté soi cacher comme je faisais. »","“I will groom [13] this one,” said Panurge, telling you what Breton Villandry replied one day to the Lord Duke of Guise. Their subject was of some battle of King Francis against the Emperor Charles V, in which Breton was gorgiously[14] armed, even with sharp greaves and sabatons[15], mounted also to advantage[16], however had no been seen in combat. “By my faith,” replied Breton, “I have been there, it will be easy to prove it to me, even in a place where you would not have dared to find yourself. The lord duke taking this word badly, as being too brave and too recklessly uttered, and raising his voice, Breton easily in great laughter appeased him, saying: ""I was with the luggage, where your honor had not been."" hid like I did. »","[‘I can huff you on that,’ said Panurge, ‘by citing you what Breton Villandry replied one day to my lord the Duc de Guise. They were discussing some battle or other of King François against the Emperor Charles the Fifth; Breton had been resplendently armoured, especially with greaves and shoes of steel; he was well mounted yet had never seen any of the fighting. ‘“Upon my faith,” said Breton, “I was there all right, and it is easy for me to prove that I was in fact in a place where you would never have dared to go.” ‘His lord the Duke took offence at those words as being too arrogantly and insolently uttered. He raised the tone. Breton easily quietened him down amongst general laughter: ‘“I was,” he said, “with the baggage-train: where your sense of honour would never have allowed you to hide as I was doing.”’]","The King thought it an Indecency that a Poet shou’d be thus a frying in a Kitchin; and the Poet let the King know that it was a more indecent thing for a King to be found in such a place: I’ll clap another story upon the Neck of this, quoth Panurge, and will tell you what Briton Villandray answer’d one day to the Duke of Guise. They were saying that at a certain Battle of King Francis against Charles the Fifth, Briton arm’d Capape to the Teeth, and mounted like St. George; yet sneack’d off, and play’d least in sight during the Ingagement. Blood and Oons, answer’d Briton, I was there and can prove it easily; nay, even where you, my Lord, dar’d not have been. The Duke began to resent this as too rash and sawcy; But Briton easily appeas’d him, and set them all a laughing. I gad, my Lord, quoth he, I kept out of harm’s way; I was all the while with your Page Jack, sculking in a certain place where you had not dar’d hide your head as I did."
"« J’ai rompu dix lances en tournoi ou en bataille, » un charpentier le ferait bien ; mais louable gloire est d’une lance avoir rompu dix de ses ennemis. De sa lance donc, acérée, verte et raide, rompait un huis[22], enfonçait un harnais[23], aculait[24] une arbre, enclavait[25] un anneau, enlevait une selle d’armes, un haubert, un gantelet. Le tout faisait armé de pied en cap.","“I have broken ten spears in tournament or battle,” a carpenter would do well; but laudable glory is of a spear having severed ten of his foes. With his spear, then, sharp, green and stiff, broke a door[22], drove in a harness[23], aculait[24] a tree, enclaved[25] a ring, removed a saddle of arms, a hauberk, a gauntlet. Everything was armed from head to toe.","– a carpenter could do as well! – but the glory is worthwhile when, with one single lance, you have broken ten of your enemies. So with his lance, sharp, fresh and strong, he would batter down a portal, pierce some armour, uproot a tree, spike a ring and spear an armed saddle, a hauberk or a steel gauntlet. All of which he did armed head to foot.","There he broke not his lance; for it is the greatest foolery in the world, to say, I have broken ten lances at tilt or in fight, a Carpenter can do even as much; but it is a glorious and praise-worthy action, with one lance to break and overthrow ten enemies: therefore with a sharp, stiffe, strong and well-steeled lance, would he usually force up a door, pierce a harnesse, beat down a tree, carry away the ring, lift up a cuirasier saddle, with the male-coat and gantlet; all this he did in compleat armes from head to foot."
"Mais vous seriez bien davantage ébahis et étonnés si je vous exposais présentement tout le chapitre de Pline, auquel parle des enfantements étranges et contre nature, et toutefois je ne suis point menteur tant assuré comme il a été. Lisez le septième de sa Naturelle Histoire, capi. III, et ne m’en tabustez[16] plus l’entendement.","But you would be much more amazed and astonished if I presently exposed to you the whole chapter of Pliny, in which speaks of strange and unnatural births, and yet I am not a liar as assured as he was. Read the seventh of his Natural History, capi. III, and do not stupefy [16] my understanding any longer.","But you would be even more amazed and thunder-struck if I were to expound to you here the whole chapter of Pliny in which he tells of strange and unnatural births. Yet I am not such a confident liar as he is. Read the third chapter of Book 7 of his Natural History and stop befuddling my mind. How his name was imposed on Gargantua, and how he slurped down the wine CHAPTER 6 [Becomes Chapter 7. The first idea of giving a comic etymology to Gargantua’s name derives from the non-Rabelaisian Grandes et inestimables Croniques, where Gargantua is allegedly a Greek name meaning ‘What a beautiful son you have!’ Rabelais is thinking mainly of the imposing of the name of John on the future Baptist, a practice which he attributes to Hebrews generally. The ‘Scotist doctors’ are doctors of theology who follow Duns Scotus. Duns was so out of favour with humanists that they drew from his name our term dunce. The savour is however more one of joy than of theological contentiousness. The take-off of a condemnation by the Sorbonne (‘scandalous, offensive to pious ears and redolent of heresy’) uses one of their authentic formulas.","But you would wonder more, and with farre greater amazement, if I should now present you with that chapter of Plinius, wherein he treateth of strange births, and contrary to nature, and yet am not I so impudent a lier as he was. Reade the seventh book of his Natural History, chapt. 4. and trouble not my head any more about this."
"« En cette manière voyons-nous entre les jongleurs, à la distribution des rôles, le personnage du sot et du badin être toujours représenté par le plus périt[11] et parfait joueur de leur compagnie.","“In this way we see between the jugglers, in the distribution of roles, the character of the fool and the playful being always represented by the most perished [11] and perfect player of their company.","[‘And that is why we see, at the distribution of parts between the strolling players, the role of the fool or jester is always taken by the most skilled and accomplished actor in the troupe.","The like we daily see practised amongst the Commick Players, whose Drammatick Rolls, in distribution of the Personages, appoint the acting of the Fool to him who is the wisest of the Troop."
"« La ferveur de tes études requérait que de longtemps ne te révoquasse[1] de cetui philosophique repos, si la confiance de nos amis et anciens confédérés n’eût de présent frustré la sûreté de ma vieillesse. Mais, puisque telle est cette fatale destinée que par iceux sois inquiété èsquels plus je me reposais, force m’est de te rappeler au subside[2] des gens et biens qui te sont par droit naturel affiés[3].

The adage on war in the first paragraph is taken from Cicero, Of Duties, 1, 22, 76.)] ‘Your keenness for your studies would have required me not to recall you from your philosophical leisure for some long time yet, had not the arrogance of our friends and long-term allies now shattered the security of my old age. But since it is my fated destiny to be disturbed by those on whom I had most relied, I am obliged to summon you home to defend the persons and property enfeoffed to you by natural law. For, as arms are weak without, if counsel dwells not within, so too, vain is study and counsel futile if they are not virtuously practised at the opportune moment and put into effect.","THE fervency of thy studies did require, that I should not in a long time recall thee from that Philosophical rest thou now enjoyest; if the confidence reposed in our friends and ancient confederates had not at this present disappointed the assurance of my old age: But seeing such is my fatal destiny, that I should be now disquieted by those in whom I trusted most: I am forced to call thee back to help the people and goods, which by the right of nature belong unto thee; for even as armes are weak abroad if there be not counsel at home: so is that study vaine, and counsel unprofitable, which in a due and convenient time is not by vertue executed and put in effect."

"Cependant Monsieur l’Appétit venait, et par bonne opportunité s’asseyaient à table. Au commencement du repas, était lue quelque histoire plaisante des anciennes prouesses, jusques à ce qu’il eût pris son vin. Lors, si bon semblait, on continuait la lecture, ou commençaient à deviser joyeusement ensemble, parlants, pour les premiers mois, de la vertu, propriété, efficace[9] et nature de tout ce que leur était servi à table : du pain, du vin, de l’eau, du sel, des viandes, poissons, fruits, herbes, racines, et de l’apprêt d’icelles.Ce que faisant, apprit en peu de temps tous les passages à ce compétants en Pline, Athénée, Dioscorides, Julius Pollux, Galien, Porphyre, Oppian, Polybe, Héliodore, Aristotèles, Elian et autres. Iceux propos tenus, faisaient souvent, pour plus être assurés, apporter les livres susdits à table. Et si bien et entièrement retint en sa mémoire les choses dites, que, pour lors, n’était médecin qui en sut à la moitié tant comme il faisait. Après, devisaient des leçons lues au matin, et, parachevant leur repas par quelque confection de cotoniat[10], s’écurait les dents avec un trou[11] de lentisque, se lavait les mains et les yeux de belle eau fraîche, et rendaient grâces à Dieu par quelques beaux cantiques faits à la louange de la munificence et bénignité divine.","However Monsieur l'Appétit came, and by good opportunity sat down at table. At the beginning of the meal was read some pleasant story of ancient prowess, until he had taken his wine. Then, if it seemed good, we continued reading, or began to chat happily together, talking, for the first few months, of the virtue, property, efficiency[9] and nature of everything that was served to them at the table: bread, wine, water, salt, meats, fish, fruits, herbs, roots, and dressing of icelles. , Dioscorides, Julius Pollux, Galen, Porphyry, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodorus, Aristoteles, Elian and others. Iceux remarks made, often, to be more assured, brought the aforesaid books to the table. And so well and entirely retained in his memory the things said, that at that time there was no doctor who knew half as much as he did. Afterwards, they talked about lessons read in the morning, and, finishing their meal with some confection of cotoniat[10], cleaned their teeth with a hole[11] of lentisk, washed their hands and eyes with beautiful cold water, and gave thanks to God with some beautiful hymns in praise of the divine munificence and benignity.","Meanwhile Sir Appetite would come, and they would opportunely sit down to table. At the beginning of the meal a pleasant tale of ancient deeds of chivalry would be read until he had taken his wine. Then (if thought fit) the reading would be resumed or else they would enter upon enjoyable discussions, talking (during the first few months) of the qualities, properties, efficacy and nature of all the things that had been served up at table: bread, wine, water, salt, flesh, fish, fruit, herbs and roots, as well as how to prepare them. In doing so they quickly learnt all the relevant passages in Pliny, Athenaeus, Dioscorides, [Julius Pollux,] Galen, Porphyry, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodorus, Aristotle, Aelian and others. When talking about such things, they would have the books of those authors brought to the table for greater certainty. And he so fully and totally kept in his memory what was said in them that at that time there was no physician who knew half as much as he did. Afterwards they would discuss the lessons read that morning, finishing off their meal with some quince jelly, picking their teeth with a sliver of mastic-wood, washing their hands and eyes in clear fresh water and rendering thanks to God with some beautiful canticles in praise of his bounty and loving kindness.","In the mean time Master Appetite came, and then very orderly sate they down at table; at the beginning of the meale, there was read some pleasant history of the warlike actions of former times, until he had taken a glasse of wine. Then, (if they thought good,) they continued reading, or began to discourse merrily together; speaking first of the vertue, propriety, efficacy and nature of all that was served in at the table; of bread, of wine, of water, of salt, of fleshes, fishes, fruits, herbs, roots, and of their dressing; by meanes whereof, he learned in a little time all the passages competent for this, that were to be found in Plinie, Athenœus, Dioscorides, Julius Pollux, Galen, Porphirie, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore, Aristotle, Elian, and others. Whilest they talked of these things, many times to be the more certain, they caused the very books to be brought to the table, and so well and perfectly did he in his memory retain the things above-said, that in that time there was not a Physician that knew half so much as he did. Afterwards they conferred of the lessons read in the morning, and ending their repast with some conserve or marmelade of quinces: he pick’t his teeth with mastick tooth-pickers; wasn’t his hands and eyes with faire fresh water, and gave thanks unto God in some fine Canticks, made in praise of the divine bounty and munificence."

When it is overridden, you can no longer revoke it[12]; she is bald from the back of her head, and never returns.","Then, raising aloft one of the cannon-balls, he said, ‘These are cannon-shot which, when he was passing through the forest at Vède, struck your son Gargantua through the treachery of your foes; but they have received such retribution that they all perished in the razing of the castle, as did the Philistines by the ingenuity of Samson and those who were crushed by the tower of Siloam (of whom it: is written in Luke 13). ‘My opinion is that we should hunt down the foe while luck is with us. For Opportunity wears all her hair in front: once she has gone by you can never call her back: behind, her head is bald, and she never returns.’","I did not mean that thou shouldest reside there; Then answered Ponocrates, my soveraign Lord, think not that I have placed him in that lowsie Colledge, which they call Montague; I had rather have put him amongst the grave-diggers of Sanct Innocent, so enormous is the cruelty and villany that I have known there; for the Galley-slaves are far better used amongst the Moors and Tartars, the murtherers in the criminal dungeons, yea the very dogs in your house, then are the poor wretched Students in the aforesaid Colledge; and if I were King of Paris, the devil take me if I would not set it on fire, and burne both Principal and Regents, for suffering this inhumanity to be exercised before their eyes: then taking up one of these bullets, he said, These are cannon-shot, which your sonne Gargantua hath lately received by the treachery of your enemies, as he was passing before the Wood of Vede. But they have been so rewarded, that they are all destroyed in the ruine of the Castle, as were the Philistines by the policy of Samson, and those whom the tower of Silohim slew, as it is written in the thirteenth of Luke; My opinion is, that we pursue them whilest the luck is on our side, for occasion hath all her haire on her forehead, when she is past, you may not recal her, she hath no tuft whereby you can lay hold on her, for she is bald in the hind-part of her head, and never returneth again."

De ces deux contrées tous les ans à boutées[3], ces clergaux ici nous viennent, laissants pères et mères, tous amis et tous parents. La manière est telle quand en quelque noble maison de cette contrée y a trop d’iceux enfants, soient mâles, soient femelles, de sorte que, qui à tous part ferait de l’héritage, comme raison le veut, nature l’ordonne et Dieu le commande, la maison serait dissipée. C’est l’occasion pourquoi les parents s’en déchargent en cette île Bossard.","– They are, says Æditue, all birds of passage, and come to us from the other world, part [1] of a marvelously large country, which is called Joursanspain, part of another towards the west, which is called Too controversial[2]. From these two countries every year in batches[3], these clergy here come to us, leaving fathers and mothers, all friends and all relatives. The way is such when in some noble house of this country there are too many two children, either male or female, so that whoever would inherit, as reason wills, nature ordains it and God commands it, the house would be wasted. This is the occasion why the parents are unloading it on this Bossard island.","They come to us from the other world, some from a wondrously broad country called Day-sans-Bread and some from another land lying towards the setting sun and called Too-Many-Ckilder. Every year those Clerigoths come here in droves from those two lands, leaving behind fathers and mothers and all their friends and neighbours. That is what happens whenever there are so many children, be they male or female, in some noble House in that second land, that if you were to divide up the inheritance between them (as reason requires, Nature ordains and God commands) the family itself would be ruined. ‘That is the occasion which leads parents to dump their children on to this Ile Bossard.’","They are all of them Passengers, return’d Ædituus, and come hither from t’ other world; part out of a vast Countrey call’d Want-o ’ -Bread, the rest out of another toward the West, which they style, Too-many-of em. From these two Countries flock hither every year, whole Legions of these Clerghawks, leaving their Fathers, Mothers, Friends and Relations. This happens when there are too many Children, whether Male or Female, in some good Family of the latter Countrey; insomuch that the House would come to nothing, if the Paternal Estate were shar’d among them all; (as Reason requires, Nature directs, and God commands). For this cause, Parents use to rid themselves of that Inconveniency, by packing off the Younger Fry, and forcing them to seek their Fortune in this Isle Bossart, (Crooked Island.)"

Lors chacun ouvrait la gueule tant qu’il pouvait, et bâillaient aucune[25] fois demie-heure, aucune fois plus, aucune fois moins, selon que le prieur jugeait le déjeuner être proportionné à la fête du jour. Après cela faisaient une belle procession, en laquelle ils portaient deux bannières, en l’une desquelles était en belle peinture le portrait de vertu, en l’autre de fortune. Un fredon premier portait la bannière de fortune, après lui marchait un autre portant celle de vertu, en main tenant un aspersoir mouillé en eau mercuriale, décrite par Ovide en ses Fastes, duquel continuellement il comme fouettait le précédent fredon, portant fortune.","The clock strikes noon (note that their bells were, both of the clock and of the church and refectory, made according to the pontial motto[19], namely is of fine counterpointed down[20], and the batail[21] was of a fox's tail) thus striking noon, they woke up and unbooted, pissed whoever wanted, and stunned[22] whoever wanted, sneezed whoever wanted. But all, by constraint, rigorous statute, amply and copiously yawned, lunched from yawning. The spectacle seemed pleasant to me, for, their boots and spurs placed on a rack, they went down to the cloisters. There they washed their hands and mouth curiously[23], then sat down on a long saddle, and picked their teeth until the provost gave a sign, whistling in palm[24]. Then everyone opened their mouths as much as they could, and yawned once for half an hour, never more, never less, according to whether the prior judged the lunch to be proportionate to the feast of the day. After that made a beautiful procession, in which they carried two banners, in one of which was in beautiful painting the portrait of virtue, in the other of fortune. A first hum carried the banner of fortune, after him walked another carrying that of virtue, in hand holding a sprinkler moistened in mercurial water, described by Ovid in his Fasti, from which he continually whipped the preceding hum, carrying fortune.","At the stroke of noon – and note that all their bells, both in tower and Refectory, were constructed according to the device of Pontanus, namely of fine padded down, whilst their tongues were of foxes’ tails – at the stroke, I say, of noon, they awoke, pulled off their boots, pissed (if they wished), defecated (if they wished) and (if they wished) sneezed. But all of them were constrained by statute copiously and amply to yawn. They had yawns for breakfast. It was for me a pleasant sight to see; for, having put their boots and spurs on the racks, they went down into the cloisters. There they meticulously washed their hands and their mouths and then sat down on a long bench picking their teeth until the Provost gave a signal by whistling through his palm. Whereupon each one opened his jaws as wide as he could and yawned, sometimes for a full half-hour, sometimes less, as the Prior judged proportionate to each day’s festival. After which, they took out a fine procession in which they carried two banners: on one was painted a beautiful portrait of Virtue; on the other, of Fortuna. A leading Demisemiquaver carried Fortuna’s banner followed by another carrying Virtue’s; he bore in his hand an aspergillum dipped in that fountain of Mercury’s which Ovid describes in his Fasti, continually lustrating the friar walking before him and carrying Fortuna.",Fry. Dead. Pan. What has he made you? Fry. Mad. Pan. What d’ye take him to be?
"Ainsi comme ils banquetaient, Carpalim dit : « Et ventre saint Quenet, ne mangerons-nous jamais de venaison ? Cette chair salée m’altère tout. Je vous vais apporter ici une cuisse de ces chevaux qu’avons fait brûler : elle sera assez bien rôtie. » Tout ainsi qu’il se levait pour ce faire, aperçut à l’orée du bois un beau grand chevreuil qui était issu du fort[1], voyant le feu de Panurge, à mon avis. Incontinent, courut après de telle roideur qu’il semblait que fût un carreau d’arbalète, et l’attrapa en un moment, et, en courant, prit de ses mains en l’air : quatre grandes outardes, sept bitards[2], vingt et six perdrix grises, trente et deux rouges, seize faisans, neuf bécasses, dix et neuf hérons, trente et deux pigeons ramiers, et tua de ses pieds dix ou douze que levrauts que lapins, qui jà étaient hors de page, dix-huit râles parés[3] ensemble, quinze sanglerons[4], deux blaireaux, trois grands renards.","So as they were banqueting, Carpalim said: ""And belly Saint Quenet, shall we never eat venison?"" This salty flesh alters everything. I'm going to bring you here a leg of those horses that we burned: it will be roasted pretty well. Just as he rose to do this, saw at the edge of the wood a beautiful large roe deer which had come from the fort, [1] seeing the fire of Panurge, in my opinion. Instantly, ran after him with such stiffness that it looked like a crossbow bolt, and caught it in a moment, and running, took with his hands in the air: four great bustards, seven bitards[2] , twenty and six gray partridges, thirty and two red, sixteen pheasants, nine woodcocks, ten and nine herons, thirty and two wood pigeons, and killed with his feet ten or twelve than rabbits, which were already off the page, ten -eight trimmed rattles[3] together, fifteen strapons[4], two badgers, three large foxes.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","THUS as they talked & chatted together, Carpalin said, And by the belly of St. Quenet, shal we never eat any venison? this salt meat makes me horribly dry, I will go fetch you a quarter of one of those horses which we have burnt , it is well roasted already: as he was rising to go about it, he perceived under the side of a wood a fair great roe-buck, which was come out of his Fort (as I conceive) at the sight of Panurge’s fire: him did he pursue and run after with as much vigour and swiftnesse, as if it had been a bolt out of a Crossebowe, and caught him in a moment; and whilest he was in his course, he with his hands took in the aire foure great bustards, seven bitterns, six and twenty gray partridges, two and thirty red legged ones, sixteen pheasants, nine woodcocks, nineteen herons, two and thirty coushots and ringdoves; and with his feet killed ten or twelve hares and rabbets, which were then at relief, and pretty big withal, eighteen rayles in a knot together, with fifteen young wilde boares, two little Bevers, and three great foxes:"
"– Si je ne bois, je suis à sec, me voilà mort. Mon âme s’enfuira en quelque grenouillère. En sec jamais l’âme n’habite.","– If I don't drink, I'm dry, here I am dead. My soul will flee in some onesie. In dryness the soul never dwells.","– If I drink not, I dry out. And there I am, dead. My soul will scamper off to some frog-pond or other. In the arid can no soul abide.","If I drink not, I am a ground dry, gravelled and spent, I am stark dead without drink, and my soul ready to flie into some marish amongst Frogs; the soul never dwells in a dry place, drouth kills it."
"Le vieil Macrobe, en langage ionique, demandait à Pantagruel comment et par quelle industrie et labeur était abordé à leur port celle journée, en laquelle avait été troublement de l’air et tempête de mer tant horrifique. Pantagruel lui répondit que le haut Servateur[8] avait eu égard à la simplicité et sincère affection de ses gens, lesquels ne voyageaient pour gain ne trafic de marchandise. Une et seule cause les avait en mer mis, savoir est studieux désir de voir, apprendre, connaître, visiter l’oracle de Bacbuc et avoir le mot de la Bouteille, sur quelques difficultés proposées par quelqu’un de la compagnie. Toutefois, ce n’avait été sans grande affliction et danger évident de naufrage. Puis lui demanda quelle cause lui semblait être de cetui épouvantable fortunal[9], et si les mers adjacentes d’icelle île étaient ainsi ordinairement sujettes à tempête, comme, en la mer Océane, sont les raz[10] de Sanmaieu[11], Maumusson, et, en la mer Méditerranée, le gouffre de Satalie, Montargentan, Plombin, Capo Mélio en Laconie, l’étroit[12] de Gibraltar, le phare de Messine et autres.","The old Macrobi, in Ionic language, asked Pantagruel how and by what industry and labor was approached in their port that day, in which had been troubled air and stormy sea so horrific. Pantagruel answered him that the High Servant [8] had had regard to the simplicity and sincere affection of his people, who did not travel for gain or trade in merchandise. One and only cause had put them at sea, knowledge is a studious desire to see, to learn, to know, to visit the oracle of Bacbuc and to have the word of the Bottle, on some difficulties proposed by someone of the company. However, it had not been without great affliction and obvious danger of sinking. Then asked him what seemed to him to be the cause of this appalling fortune[9], and whether the seas adjacent to this island were thus ordinarily subject to storms, as, in the ocean sea, are the raz[10] of Sanmaieu[11] , Maumusson, and, in the Mediterranean Sea, the abyss of Satalie, Montargentan, Plombin, Capo Mélio in Laconia, the Strait[12] of Gibraltar, the lighthouse of Messina and others.","That ancient Macrobe asked Pantagruel in the Ionic tongue how and by what toil and labour they had managed to dock in their harbour on a day when there had been such a violent disturbance in the air and such a terrifying tempest out at sea. Pantagruel replied that the Servator on high had regarded the simplicity and pure intentions of his people, who were not voyaging for gain nor dealing in merchandise. One single cause had brought them to put to sea: namely a scholarly desire to see, learn and visit the Oracle of Bacbuc and to have the word of La Bouteille concerning certain difficulties exposed by one of their company. It had not however been without sore affliction and evident peril of shipwreck. Then Pantagruel asked him what he deemed to be the cause of that frightful storm, and whether the neighbouring seas were normally subject to tempests, as are the Raz-Saint-Matthieu, Maumusson and (within the Mediterranean) the Gulf of Adalia, Montargentan, Piombino, Cape Melio in Laconia, the Straits of Gibraltar, the Straits of Messina and others. How the good Macrobe tells Pantagruel about the Manor and the Departure of Heroes","Old Macrobius ask’d in the Ionick Tongue, how, and by what industry and labour Pantagruel got to their Port that day, there having been such blustering weather, and such a dreadful Storm at Sea. Pantagruel told him, that the Almighty preserver of mankind had regarded the Simplicity, and sincere Affection of his Servants, who did not travel for Gain or sordid Profit, the sole design of their Voyage being a studious desire to know, see, and visit the Oracle of Bacbuc, and take the word of the Bottle upon some difficulties offer’d by one of the Company; nevertheless this had not been without great Affliction, and evident danger of Shipwrack. After that, he ask’d him what he judg’d to be the cause of that terrible Tempest, and if the adjacent Seas were thus frequently subject to Storms, as in the Ocean are the Ratz of Sammaieu, Maumusson, and in the Mediterranean Sea the Gulph of Sataly, Montargentan, Piombino, Capo Melio in the Morea, the Streights of Gibraltar, Faro di Messina, and others."

"– La couleur, répondit Panurge, est âpre aux pots ; à propos, c’est mon bureau[10] ; je le veux dorénavant tenir et de près regarder à mes affaires. Puisqu’une fois je suis quitte, vous ne vîtes onques homme plus mal plaisant que je serai, si Dieu ne m’aide. Voyez ci mes besicles. À me voir de loin vous diriez proprement que c’est frère Jean Bourgeois. Je crois bien que l’année qui vient, je prêcherai encore une fois la croisade. Dieu gard’ de mal les pelotons. Voyez-vous ce bureau ? Croyez qu’en lui consiste quelque occulte propriété à peu de gens connue. Je ne l’ai pris que ce matin, mais déjà j’endêve, je dégaine, je grésille d’être marié et labourer en diable bur[11] dessus ma femme, sans crainte des coups de bâton. O le grand ménager que je serai ! Après ma mort, on me fera brûler en bust[12] honorifique, pour en avoir les cendres, en mémoire et exemplaire du ménager parfait. Corbieu ! sur cetui mien bureau, ne se joue pas mon argentier d’allonger les ss., car coups de poing trotteraient en face. Voyez-moi devant et derrière : c’est la forme d’une toge, antique habillement des Romains on[13] temps de paix. J’en ai pris la forme en la colonne de Trajan à Rome, en l’arc triomphal aussi de Septimus Severus. Je suis las de guerre, las des sages[14] et hoquetons. J’ai les épaules toutes usées à force de porter harnais. Cessent les armes, règnent les toges, au moins pour toute cette subséquente année, si je suis marié, comme vous m’alléguâtes hier par la loi mosaïque.","“Colour,” replied Panurge, “is hard on pots; by the way, this is my office[10]; henceforth I want him to hold and closely watch my affairs. Since once I am even, you will never see a more unpleasant man than I will be, if God does not help me. See my glasses here. Looking at me from afar, you would say it was Brother Jean Bourgeois. I believe that in the coming year, I will preach the crusade once again. God save the platoons from harm. Do you see this office? Believe that in it consists some occult property known to few people. I only took it this morning, but I'm already getting drunk, I'm drawing, I'm sizzling at being married and plowing like hell bur[11] on my wife, without fear of blows from a stick. O the housekeeper that I will be! After my death, I will be burned as an honorary bust[12], to have the ashes, in memory and exemplary of the perfect housekeeper. Raven! on this desk of mine, don't fool my treasurer to lengthen the ss., because punches would trot in the face. See me in front and behind: it is the shape of a toga, ancient clothing of the Romans in times of peace. I took its form in the column of Trajan in Rome, in the triumphal arch also of Septimus Severus. I am weary of war, weary of sages[14] and hiccups. My shoulders are all worn out from wearing a harness. Cease the arms, reign the togas, at least for all this subsequent year, if I am married, as you told me yesterday by the Mosaic law.","‘The colour,’ said Panurge, ‘is apropos – bitter to poes – it’s my bureau. From henceforth I mean to work on it and keep a close eye on my affairs. You never saw a man as nasty as I shall be, now I’m out of debt – unless God helps me. ‘Look, here are my goggles. If you saw me from afar you would rightly take me for Frère Jean Bourgeois: next year I shall, I think, preach yet another crusade! Then God save our bollocks. ‘You see this brown bureau-cloth? Believe me: some occult property resides in it, known only to a few! I just put it on this morning, and I’m mad already, raging, and piping-hot to be married and plough up my wife like a brown devil without fear of a drubbing. ‘O what a great head of my household I shall be! After my death I shall be cremated on a pyre-of-honour, so as to have my ashes as a memorial and exemplar of the perfect householder. Crikey. My accountant had better not play about on my bureau, stretching esses into efs – sous into francs! Otherwise blows from my fist would trot all over his dial! ‘Look at me, front and back: it’s in the style of the toga, the ancient dress of the Roman in times of peace. I based the style of it on Trajan’s column in Rome and on the triumphal arch of Septimius Severus too. I am weary of war, weary of soldiers’ cloaks and tunics. My shoulders are all bowed down from wearing armour. May arms cease: may togas reign (at least for all the coming year if I get married, as you quoted to me yesterday from the Law of Moses).","The Colour (answered Panurge) is convenient, for it is conform to that of my Council-Board Carpet, therefore will I henceforth hold me with it, and more narrowly and circumspectly than ever hitherto I have done, look to my Affairs and Business. Seeing I am once out of Debt, you never yet saw Man more unpleasing then I will be, if God help me not. Lo, here be my Spectacles. To see me afar off, you would readily say, that it were Fryar Burgess. I believe certainly, that in the next ensuing Year, I shall once more preach the Croisade, Bounce Buckram. Do you see this Russet? doubt not but there lurketh under it some hid Property and occult Vertue, known to very few in the World. I did not take it on before this Morning; and nevertheless, am already in a rage of Lust, mad after a Wife, and vehemently hot upon untying the Codpiece-point , I itch, I tingle, I wriggle, and long exceedingly to be married; that without the danger of Cudgel blows, I may labour my Female Copes-mate with the hard push of a Bull-horned Devil. O the provident and thrifty Husband that I then will be! After my Death, with all Honour and Respect due to my Frugality, will they burn the Sacred Bulk of my Body, of purpose to preserve the Ashes thereof, in memory of the choicest Pattern that ever was, of a perfectly wary, and compleat Housholder. Copsbody, this is not the Carpet whereon my Treasurer shall be allowed to play false in his Accompts with me, by setting down an X for an V, or an L for an S; for in that case, should I make a hail of Fisti-cuffs to fly into his face. Look upon me (Sir) both before and behind, it is made after the manner of a Toge, which was the ancient fashion of the Romans in time of Peace. I took the Mode, Shape and Form thereof in Trajan’s Column at Rome, as also in the Triumphant Arch of Septimus Severus. I am tired of the Wars, weary of wearing Buff-coats, Cassocks, and Hoquetons. My Shoulders are pitifully worn and bruised with the carrying of Harness; let Armour cease, and the Long-Robe bear sway; at least it must be so for the whole space of the succeeding Years. If I be married as yesterday, by the Mosaick Law, you evidenced, in what concerneth the Breeches: my Great-Aunt Laurence did long ago tell me, that the Breeches were only ordained for the Use of the Codpiece, and to no other end; which I, upon a no less forcible Consequence, give Credit to every whit as well, as to the Saying of the fine Fellow Galen, who in his Ninth Book Of the Use, and Employment of our Members, alledgeth, That the Head was made for the Eyes: for Nature might have placed our Heads in our Knees or Elbows; but having before-hand determined that the Eyes should serve to discover things from afar,"

"Pantagruel, averti de l’affaire, n’en fut en soi aucunement indigné, fâché, ni marri. Je vous ai jà dit, et encore redis, que c’était le meilleur petit et grand bonhomet qui onques ceignît épée. Toutes choses prenait en bonne partie, tout acte interprétait à bien, jamais ne se tourmentait, jamais ne se scandalisait. Aussi eût-il été bien forissu[8] du déifique manoir de raison, si autrement se fût contristé ou altéré, car tous les biens que le ciel couvre et que la terre contient en toutes ses dimensions, hauteur, profondité, longitude et latitude, ne sont dignes d’émouvoir nos affections et troubler nos sens et esprits. Seulement tira Panurge à part et doucettement lui remontra que, si ainsi voulait vivre et n’être autrement ménager, impossible serait, ou pour le moins bien difficile, le faire jamais riche.","Pantagruel, informed of the affair, was in no way indignant, angry, or sorry. I have already told you, and said again, that he was the best little and big fellow who ever wore a sword. All things took a good part, every act interpreted well, never tormented, never scandalized. Also would he have been forsaken [8] from the deific manor of reason, if otherwise had been saddened or altered, for all the goods that the sky covers and that the earth contains in all its dimensions, height, depth, longitude and latitude, are only worthy to stir our affections and disturb our senses and minds. Only pulled Panurge aside and gently reminded him that if he wanted to live like this and not be otherwise gentle, it would be impossible, or at least very difficult, to ever make him rich.","When Pantagruel was informed of this he was, in himself, neither indignant, angry nor troubled. I have told you before and tell you again: he was the best little giant of a fellow who ever girded himself with a sword. He took everything in good part: every deed he interpreted favourably. He never tormented himself: he never took offence. He would moreover have quitted the God-made mansion of Reason if he had been otherwise saddened or depressed: for all the goods which the heavens cover and this earth contains in all its dimensions – height, depth, length or breadth – are not worth stirring our emotions or troubling our wits or our minds. He simply drew Panurge aside and gently pointed out to him that, if he chose to live that way without being otherwise thrifty, it would be impossible or, at the very least, hard to make him rich.","Pantagruel being advertised of this his Lavishness, was in good sooth no way offended at the matter, angry nor sorry; for I once told you, and again tell it you, that he was the best, little, great Good-man that ever girded a Sword to his Side; he took all things in good part, and interpreted every Action to the best Sence: He never vexed nor disquieted himself with the least pretence of Dislike to any thing; because he knew that he must have most grosly abandoned the Divine Mansion of Reason, if he had permitted his Mind to be never so little grieved, afflicted or altered at any occasion whatsoever. For all the Goods that the Heaven covereth, and that the Earth containeth in all their Dimensions and Heighth, Depth, Breadth, and Length, are not of so much worth, as that we should for them disturb or disorder our Affections, trouble or perplex our Senses or Spirits. He drew only Panurge aside, and then making to him a sweet Remonstrance and mild Admonition, very gently represented before him in strong Arguments, That if he should continue in such an unthrifty course of living, and not become a better Mesnagier, it would prove altogether impossible for him, or at least hugely difficult at any time to make him rich."
"Au regard de fanfarer[26] et faire les petits popismes[27] sur un cheval, nul ne le fit mieux que lui. Le voltigeur de Ferrare n’était qu’un singe en comparaison. Singulièrement[28] était appris à sauter hâtivement d’un cheval sur l’autre sans prendre terre, et nommait-on ces chevaux désultoires[29], et de chacun côté, la lance au poing, monter sans estriviers[30] et, sans bride, guider le cheval à son plaisir, car telles choses servent à discipline militaire.","With regard to boasting[26] and doing little popisms[27] on a horse, no one did it better than him. The Ferrara outfielder was a monkey in comparison. Singularly[28] was learned to jump hastily from one horse to another without landing, and were these desultory horses[29] called, and on each side, spear in hand, mounted without stirrups[30] and, without a bridle, guide the horse as it pleases, for such things serve military discipline.","As for riding in step to the trumpet and making little poppisms for his horse, none could do it better than he. (Why, that acrobat from Ferrara was but a chimp in comparison!) He was singularly accomplished in leaping smartly from horse to horse without touching the ground – on what were called ‘vaulting horses’ – jumping into the saddle from either side, without a stirrup but lance in hand, and directing his horse at will without using the bridle.","As for the prancing flourishes, and smacking popismes, for the better cherishing of the horse, commonly used in riding, none did them better then he. The cavallerize of Ferrara was but as an Ape compared to him. He was singularly skilful in leaping nimbly from one horse to another, without putting foot to ground, and these horses were called desultories: he could likewise from either side, with a lance in his hand, leap on horseback without stirrups, and rule the horse at his pleasure without a bridle, for such things are useful in military engagements."

"« Donc ne faudra dorénavant dire, qui ne voudra improprement parler, quand on enverra le Franc-taupin en guerre : « Sauve, Tevot, le pot au vin, c’est le cruon[16] ». Il faut dire : « Sauve, Tevot, le pot au lait, ce sont les couilles, de par tous les diables d’enfer. » La tête perdue, ne périt que la personne : les couilles perdues, périrait toute humaine nature. C’est ce que mut le galant Cl. Galen., lib. I. de Spermate, à bravement conclure que le mieux, c’est-à-dire moindre mal, serait point de cœur n’avoir que point n’avoir de génitoires, car là consiste, comme en un sacré repositoire[17], le germe conservatif de l’humain lignage. Et croirais, pour moins de cent francs, que ce sont les propres pierres moyennants lesquelles Deucalion et Pyrrha restituèrent le genre humain, aboli par le déluge poétique. C’est ce qui meut le vaillant Justinian, lib. IV, de Cagotis tollendis, à mettre summum bonum in braguibus et braguetis.","“So from now on, no one will have to say, who will not want to speak improperly, when we send the Franc-taupin to war: “Save, Tevot, the pot of wine is the cruon[16]”. You have to say: “Save, Tevot, the milk jug is the balls, by all the devils in hell. The head lost, only the person perishes: the balls lost, all human nature would perish. This is what the gallant Cl. Galen., lib. I. de Spermate, in bravely concluding that the best, that is to say the lesser evil, would be no heart not to have but not to have genitals, for there consists, as in a sacred repository[17], the conservative germ of the human lineage. And would believe, for less than a hundred francs, that these are the very stones by means of which Deucalion and Pyrrha restored the human race, abolished by the poetic deluge. This is what moves the valiant Justinian, lib. IV, from Cagotis tollendis, to put summum bonum in braguibus et braguetis.","So, unless you want to talk incorrectly, you should no longer say when you send a train-band soldier off to the wars, Look after your wine-jar, Tévot! – your noddle, that is – but, by all the devils in Hell, Look after your milk-jug, Tévot! – that is, your balls. Lose your head, and only an individual has perished: lose your balls, and there would perish the whole human race. That is what moved the gallant Claudius Galen (in Book One of On Semen) boldly to conclude that it would be better to have no heart than no testicles – by better meaning less bad – for in them consists, as in a sacred promptuary, that seed which conserves the human race. And for less than a hundred francs I would believe that such were the very stones by which Deucalion and Pyrrha renewed the human race which had been wiped out by the [poetic] Flood. That is what moved the courageous Justinian (in Book 4 of On the Removal of Hypocrites) to locate the summum bonum in breeches and codpieces.","Wherefore it is, that none should henceforth say, who would not speak improperly, when any Country-Bumpkin hyeth to the Wars , Have a care (my Royster) of the Wine-pot, that is the Scull, but have a care (my Royster) of the Milk-pot; that is, the Testicles. By the whole Rabble of the horned Fiends of Hell, the Head being cut off, that single Person only thereby dieth: but if the Ballocks be marred, the whole Race of Humane Kind would forthwith perish, and be lost for ever. This was the motive which incited the goodly Writer Galen, Lib. I. De Spermate, to aver with boldness, That it were better (that is to say, a less evil) to have no Heart at all, than to be quite destitute of Genitories: for there is laid up, conserved, and put in store, as in a Seccessive Repository, and Sacred Warehouse, the Semenœ, and Original Source of the whole Off-spring of Mankind. Therefore would I be apt to believe, for less than a hundred Franks, that those are the very same Stones, by means whereof Deucalion and Pyrrha restored the Humane Race, in peopling with Men and Women the World, which a little before that, had been drowned in the overflowing Waves of a Poetical Deluge. This stirred up the valiant Justinian, L. I. 4. De Cagotis tollendis, to collocate his Summum Bonum, in Braguibus, et Braguetis."
"Et non seulement d’icelle, mais des autres sciences mathématiques comme géométrie, astronomie et musique ; car, attendants la concoction et digestion de son past[15], ils faisaient mille joyeux instruments et figures géométriques, et de même pratiquaient les canons astronomiques. Après s’esbaudissaient à chanter musicalement à quatre et cinq parties, ou sur un thème, à plaisir de gorge.

Afterwards, they would enjoy singing musically in four and five parts, or on a theme, to the delight of the throat. With regard to musical instruments, he learned to play the luc[16], the spruce, the harp, the German and nine-hole flute, the viol and the sackbutte[17].","that Tunstal the Englishman, who had amply written on the subject, truly confessed that in comparison with him his own knowledge was but Double Dutch – and not only in that but also in other mathematical sciences such as geometry, astronomy and music; for while waiting for their meal to be concocted and digested they would make hundreds of amusing little geometrical shapes and figures or practise the laws of astronomy. After that they enjoyed singing music in four or five parts, or else on a set theme as it suited their voices. As regards musical instruments, he learnt to play the lute, the spinet, the harp, both the traverse and the nine-holed flutes, the viola and the sackbut.","And not only in that, but in the other Mathematical Sciences, as Geometrie, Astronomie, Musick, &c. For in waiting on the concoction, and attending the digestion of his food, they made a thousand pretty instruments and Geometrical figures, & did in some measure practise the Astronomical canons. After this they recreated themselves with singing musically, in foure or five parts, or upon a set theme or ground at random, as it best pleased them; in matter of musical instruments, he learned to play upon the Lute, the Virginals, the Harp, the All-man Flute with nine holes, the Viol, and the Sackbut."

"56. Comment Panurge, par mâle peur, se conchia, et du grand chat Rodilardus pensait que fût un diableteau","56. How Panurge, out of male fear, conchied himself, and of the great cat Rodilardus thought that he was a devil","You may take it that there was a glorious din. How Panurge messed himself out of sheer funk; and how he mistook the mighty cat Rodilardus for a little devil CHAPTER 67 [Rabelais returns to scatology – learned scatology – for the last time. In Chapter 52 he had already quoted scatological lines from Catullus. A knowledge of Italian is here simply supposed. Without it, contemporaries would have been lost. (Translations were later supplied by the publisher.) Here the original Italian is given with a translation. The giants, once coarse and concerned with faeces and grossness, are now ideals: Gargantua, the model king and father; Pantagruel, the model princely son and Socratic sage. It is Panurge now who replaces the young faeces-centred oaf that Gargantua was before being purged of his madness. Scatology provides both jests and a final judgement on Panurge. Panurge also breaks into patois like the Limousin scholar of Pantagruel. For the first time since Pantagruel, Pantagruel (the giant) bursts out laughing. He cannot help it. Pantagruel has been an agelast, a non-laugher, throughout the last two books: that too makes him like Socrates, who had a great sense of fun and laughed with his friends, yet was classed as an ‘agelast’ by Pliny. (Erasmus, Adages, II, V, LXII, ‘Unlaughing stone’). The tale about Villon in England dates from well before the time of Villon, let alone of Thomas Linacre. The lines attributed to Villon are authentic. At the battle of Inchkeith (the Isle of Horses) in 1548, some 400 English soldiers were slaughtered by the French. At the end, Pantagruel talks of God and of cleanliness: Panurge irrepressibly talks of the devil and dung.]","CHAPTER LXVII How Panurge bewray’d himself for fear; and of the huge Cat Rodilardus, which he took for a puny Devil."

"Eux disants ces paroles, voici arriver Loupgarou, avec tous ses géants, lequel, voyant Pantagruel seul, fut épris de témérité et outrecuidance, par espoir qu’il avait d’occire le pauvre bonhommet, dont dit à ses compagnons géants : « Paillards[6] de plat pays, par Mahom[7], si aucun de vous entreprend combattre contre ceux-ci, je vous ferai mourir cruellement. Je veux que me laissiez combattre seul ; cependant vous aurez votre passe-temps à nous regarder. » Adonc se retirèrent tous les géants avec leur roi là auprès, où étaient les flacons, et Panurge et ses compagnons avec eux, qui contrefaisait ceux qui ont eu la vérole, car il tordait la gueule et retirait les doigts, et en parole enrouée leur dit : « Je renie bieu[8], compagnons, nous ne faisons point la guerre. Donnez-nous à repaître avec vous, cependant que nos maîtres s’entre-battent. » À quoi volontiers le roi et les géants consentirent, et les firent banqueter avec eux.","Saying these words, here comes Loupgarou, with all his giants, who, seeing Pantagruel alone, was taken with temerity and presumptuousness, in the hope he had of slaying the poor fellow, of whom he said to his giant companions: ""Paillards [ 6] of the flat country, by Mahom[7], if any of you undertake to fight against these, I will kill you cruelly. I want me to fight alone; however you will have your leisure to look at us. So all the giants withdrew with their king there near where the vials were, and Panurge and his companions with them, who counterfeited those who had the pox, for he twisted his mouth and drew out his fingers, and said: ""I deny well[8], companions, we are not making war. Feed us with you, while our masters fight. To which the king and the giants willingly consented, and made them banquet with them.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Whilest they spake those words behold, Loupgarou was come with all his Giants, who seeing Pantagruel in a manner alone, was carried away with temerity and presumption, for hopes that he had to kill the good man; whereupon he said to his companions the Giants, You Wenchers of the low countrey, by Mahoom, if any of you undertake to fight against these men here, I will put you cruelly to death: it is my will that you let me fight single, in the mean time you shall have good sport to look upon us: then all the other Giants retired with their King, to the place where the flaggons stood, and Panurge and his Camerades with them, who counterfeited those that have had the pox, for he wreathed about his mouth, shrunk up his fingers, and with a harsh and hoarse voice said unto them, I forsake -od, (fellow souldiers) if I would have it to be beleeved, that we make any warre at all; Give us somewhat to eat with you, whilest our Masters fight against one another; to this the King and Giants joyntly condescended, and accordingly made them to banquet with them."
"Puis, afin que toute sa vie fût bon chevaucheur, l’on lui fit un beau grand cheval de bois, lequel il faisait penader[1], sauter, voltiger, ruer et danser tout ensemble, aller le pas, le trot, l’entrepas, le galop, les ambles, l’aubin[2], le traquenard, le camelin[3] et l’onagrier[4].

And made him change his hair (like the monks of courtibaux[5], according to the festivals) from bay-brown, chestnut, dappled gray, rat hair, deer, roan, cow, zencle[ 6], pecile[7], magpie, leuce[8].","Then, so that he would be good once astride his whole life long, they fashioned a lovely big wooden horse for him, and he got it to prance, jump, run round circles, kick up its heels and dance, walk, trot, step high, gallop, amble, pace like a pony and a gelding, and then to run like a camel or a wild ass. And (just as monks change their dalmatics according to the feast-days) he would change the colour of its coat to bay, sorrel, dapple-grey, rat-skin, dun-yellow, roan, cow-hide, black-spotted, red-speckled, piebald or lily-white.","AFTERWARDS, that he might be all his lifetime a good Rider , they made to him a faire great horse of wood, which he did make leap, curvete, yerk out behinde, and skip forward, all at a time: to pace, trot, rack, gallop, amble, to play the hobbie, the hackney-guelding: go the gate of the camel & of the wilde asse. He made him also change his colour of hair, as the Monks of Coultibo, (according to the variety of their holy-days) use to do their clothes, from bay, brown, to sorrel, daple-gray, mouse-dun, deer-colour, roan, cow-colour, gingioline, skued colour, pybal’d, and the colour of the savage elk."

"Item, en une autre il avait une petite guedoufle[18] pleine de vieille huile, et quand il trouvait ou femme ou homme qui eût quelque belle robe, il leur engraissait et gâtait tous les plus beaux endroits, sous le semblant de les toucher et dire : « Voici de bon drap, voici bon satin, bon taffetas, madame ; Dieu vous donne ce que votre noble cœur désire : vous avez robe neuve, nouvel ami ; Dieu vous y maintienne ! » Ce disant, leur mettait la main sur le collet, ensemble la male[19] tache y demeurait perpétuellement","Item, in another he had a little guedoufle [18] full of old oil, and when he found either a woman or a man who had some beautiful dress, he fattened them and spoiled all the most beautiful places, under the pretense of touching them and say: “Here is good cloth, here is good satin, good taffeta, Madame; God gives you what your noble heart desires: you have a new dress, a new friend; God keep you there! So saying, put their hand on the collar, together the male [19] stain remained there perpetually","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Item, in another he had a little leather bottle full of old oile, wherewith, when he saw any man or woman in a rich new handsome suit, he would grease, smutch and spoile all the best parts of it under colour and pretence of touching them, saying, This is good cloth, this is good sattin, good taffaties: Madam, God give you all that your noble heart desireth; you have a new suit, pretty Sir; and you a new gown, sweet Mistris, God give you joy of it, and maintain you in all prosperity! and with this would lay his hand upon their shoulder, at which touch such a villainous spot was left behinde, so enormously engraven to perpetuity in the very soule, body and reputation, that the devil himself could never have taken it away: Then upon his departing, he would say, Madam, take heed you do not fall, for there is a filthy great hole before you, whereinto if you put your foot, you will quite spoile your selfe."
"– Il était, dit frère Jean, invité à un somptueux et magnifique banquet que faisait un sien parent et voisin, auquel étaient pareillement invités tous les gentilshommes, dames et damoiselles du voisinage. Icelles attendantes sa venue, déguisèrent les pages de l’assemblée et les habillèrent en damoiselles bien pimpantes et atourées[12]. Les pages endamoisellés à lui entrant près le pont-levis se présentèrent. Il les baisa tous en grande courtoisie et révérences magnifiques. Sur la fin, les dames qui l’attendaient en la galerie, s’éclatèrent de rire et firent signes aux pages à ce qu’ils ôtassent leurs atours. Ce que voyant, le bon seigneur, par honte et dépit ne daigna baiser icelles dames et damoiselles naïves[13], alléguant, vu qu’on lui avait ainsi déguisé les pages, que, par la mort bœuf de bois ! ce devaient là être les valets, encore plus finement déguisés.","“He was,” said Brother Jean, “invited to a sumptuous and magnificent banquet given by a relative and neighbor of his, to which all the gentlemen, ladies and damsels of the neighborhood were equally invited. Those waiting for his coming, disguised the pages of the assembly and dressed them in very dapper and adorned damsels[12]. The pages tamed to him entering near the drawbridge introduced themselves. He kissed them all with great courtesy and magnificent bows. At the end, the ladies who were waiting for him in the gallery burst out laughing and motioned to the pages to take off their finery. Seeing this, the good lord, out of shame and spite, did not deign to kiss the naive ladies and damsels [13], alleging, seeing that the pages had been disguised for him in this way, that, by death, a wooden ox! these must have been the valets, even more finely disguised.","‘He,’ said Frère Jean, ‘was invited to a splendid and sumptuous feast given by one of his kinsmen who lived near by. To it were also invited all the gentlemen of the neighbourhood and all the ladies, both dames and demoiselles. While waiting for him to arrive, those ladies took the assembled pages, making them up and decking them out as attractive and fashionable young ladies. When Guyecharais came in, those feminized pages came to greet him. With great courtesy and courtly bows he kissed them all in turn. In the end the ladies (who were in the gallery, lying in wait for him) burst out laughing and signalled to their pages to take off their finery. ‘On seeing which that good lord, out of embarrassment and irritation, would not condescend to kiss the real dames and demoiselles, asserting that, since they had disguised those pages for him, they themselves, by Gosh! must be their lackeys even more cleverly made up.] ‘Mighty God!","He was invited to a Sumptuous Feast, said Fryar Jhon, by a Relation and Neighbour of his, together with all the Gentlemen and Ladies in the Neighbourhood. Now some of the latter, expecting his coming, drest the Pages in Womens Cloths, and finified them like any Babies, then order’d them to meet my Lord at his coming, near the Draw-bridge; so the Complementing Monsieur came, and there kiss’d the Petticoated Lads with great formality. At last the Ladies who minded Passages in the Gallery, burst out with Laughing, and made signs to the Pages to take off their dress; which the good Lord having observed, the Devil a bit he durst make up to the true Ladies to kiss them, but said, That since they had disguis’d the Pages, by his Great Grandfather’s Helmet, these were certainly the very Foot-men and Grooms still more cunningly disguis’d."
"Lors découvrit sa ferrière[6], et sans mettre le nez dedans, buvait assez honnêtement. Les maroufles le regardaient, ouvrants la gueule d’un grand pied, et tirants les langues comme lévriers, en attente de boire après ; mais Tripet, le capitaine, sur ce point accourut voir que c’était. À lui Gymnaste offrit sa bouteille, disant : « Tenez, capitaine, buvez en hardiment ; j’en ai fait l’essai, c’est vin de la Foye-Monjau.","Then discovered his ferrière[6], and without putting his nose in it, drank honestly enough. The brats looked at him, opening their mouths with a big foot, and sticking out their tongues like greyhounds, waiting to drink afterwards; but Tripet, the captain, on this point hastened to see that it was. To him Gymnast offered his bottle, saying: “Here, Captain, drink it boldly; I tried it, it's a Foye-Monjau wine.","He then unstopped his leathern bottle and took a decent swig without sticking his nose in. The poor wretches stared at him, gaping with jaws a good foot wide and hanging out their tongues like greyhounds waiting to drink after him. But at that moment up ran Captain Tri-ffart to see what was going on. Whereupon Gymnaste proffered him his bottle, saying: ‘Here you are, Captain. Take a bold swig. I’ve tried it: it’s wine from La Foye-Monjault.’ ‘Hey!’","With that he unscrued his Borracho, (which was a great dutch leathern bottle,) and without putting in his nose drank very honestly: the maroufle Rogues looked upon him, opening their throats a foot wide, and putting out their tongues like Greyhounds, in hopes to drink after him: but Captain Tripet, in the very nick of that their expectation, came running to him to see who it was. To him Gymnast offered his bottle, saying, Hold, Captain, drink boldly and spare not; I have been thy taster, it is wine of La fay monjau."
"– Voire, voire, dit Gymnaste, ou je demeurerai en chemin. »","“Very, even,” said Gymnast, “or I shall remain on the way. »","‘Indeed, indeed I will,’ said Gymnaste, ‘or stay stuck on the way.’","Yes, yes, (said Gymnastes) or I shall stick in the way: then setting spurs to his horse, he past through freely, his horse not fearing, nor being any thing affrighted at the sight of the dead bodies; for he had accustomed him (according to the doctrine of Ælian) not to feare armour, nor the carcasses of dead men; and that not by killing men as Diomedes did the Thracians, or as Ulysses did in throwing the Corpses of his enemies at his horses feet, as Homer saith, but by putting a Jack-a-lent amongst his hay, & making him go over it ordinarily, when he gave him his oates."
"« Cependant, je, qui vous fais ces tant véritables contes, m’étais caché dessous une feuille de bardane, qui n’était moins large que l’arche du pont de Monstrible ; mais quand je les vis ainsi bien couverts, je m’en allai à eux rendre à l’abri, ce que je ne pus, tant ils étaient comme l’on dit, au bout de l’aune faut[4] le drap. Donc, le mieux que je pus, montai par dessus, et cheminai bien deux lieues sur sa langue, tant que j’entrai dedans sa bouche. Mais, ô dieux et déesses, que vis-je là ? Jupiter me confonde de sa foudre trisulque[5] si j’en mens. J’y cheminais comme l’on fait en Sophie à Constantinople, et y vis de grands rochers, comme les monts des Danois (je crois que c’étaient ses dents) et de grands prés, de grandes forêts, de fortes et grosses villes, non moins grandes que Lyon ou Poitiers.","“However, I, who tell you these so true tales, had hidden myself under a leaf of burdock, which was no less wide than the arch of the bridge of Monstrible; but when I saw them thus well covered, I went to give them shelter, which I could not, so much they were, as they say, at the end of the yardstick one needs [4] the sheet. So, as best I could, climbed over it, and walked a good two leagues on her tongue, as long as I entered her mouth. But, oh gods and goddesses, what do I see there? Jupiter confuses me with his trisulcan lightning [5] if I lie. I walked there as one does in Sophia at Constantinople, and saw there great rocks, like the mountains of the Danes (I believe they were his teeth) and great meadows, great forests, strong and big cities. , no less large than Lyon or Poitiers.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted. And not only would they and the generations successively born to their blood live like that, but they would also maintain in the same feudal obedience the peoples freshly added to his empire.","In the mean time I, who relate to you these so veritable stories, hid myself under a burdock-leafe, which was not much lesse in largenesse then the arch of the bridge of Montrible, but when I saw them thus covered, I went towards them to shelter my self likewise; which I could not do; for that they were so (as the saying is) At the yards end there is no cloth left. Then as well as I could, I got upon it, and went along full two leagues upon his tongue, and so long marched, that at last I came into his mouth: but, oh gods and goddesses, what did I see there? Jupiter confound me with his trisulk lightning if I lie: I walked there as they do in Sophie and Constantinople, and saw there great rocks, like the mountains in Denmark, I beleeve that those were his teeth. I saw also faire meddows, large forrests, great and strong Cities, not a jot lesse then Lyons or Poictiers, the first man I met with there, was a good honest fellow planting coleworts, whereat being very much amazed"

"Pantagruel, ces mots achevés, se tut assez longtemps, et semblait grandement pensif. Puis dit à Panurge – « L’esprit malin vous séduit, mais écoutez. J’ai lu qu’on[1] temps passé les plus véritables et sûrs oracles n’étaient ceux que par écrit on baillait, ou par parole on proférait. Maintes fois y ont fait erreur, ceux voire qui étaient estimés fins et ingénieux, tant à cause des amphibologies, équivoques et obscurités des mots, que de la brièveté des sentences. Pourtant fut Apollo, dieu de vaticination, surnommé Δοξας. Ceux que l’on exposait par gestes et par signes étaient les plus véritables et certains estimés. Telle était l’opinion d’Héraclitus, et ainsi vaticinait Jupiter en Amon, ainsi prophétisait Apollo entre les Assyriens. Pour cette raison, le peignaient-ils avec longue barbe, et vêtu comme personnage vieux et de sens rassis ; non nu, jeune et sans barbe, comme faisaient les Grecs. Usons de cette manière, et, par signes sans parler, conseil prenez de quelque muet.","Pantagruel, these words finished, was silent for a long time, and seemed greatly pensive. Then said to Panurge – “The evil spirit seduces you, but listen. I have read that in the past the most true and sure oracles were those that were yawned in writing or uttered by word. Many times have made mistakes, even those who were considered fine and ingenious, as much because of the ambiguities, equivocations and obscurities of the words, as for the brevity of the sentences. Yet was Apollo, god of vaticination, nicknamed Δοξας. Those exhibited by gestures and signs were the most genuine and some esteemed. Such was the opinion of Heraclitus, and thus prophesied Jupiter in Amun, thus prophesied Apollo between the Assyrians. For this reason they painted him with a long beard, and dressed as an old personage and of stale senses; not naked, young and beardless, as the Greeks did. Let us use this manner, and, by signs without speaking, take advice from some mute.","On Interpretation and was taken up by Dante and Thomas Aquinas as well as by many lawyers who were professionally interested in the origin of languages, the sense of words and their possible interpretations. (Under the influence of Plato those ideas will be deepened and developed in the Fourth Book.) The tale of the naughty nun appears – very chastely told – in two works of Erasmus: Ecclesiastes and Fish-eating. Erasmus claims to have heard it in a sermon delivered by a Dominican. (‘Bottome’ represents ‘Fessue’; ‘Stiffly-Redeem-if, Redimet.)] Those words once said, Pantagruel for some time kept silent; he seemed deep in thought. He then said to Panurge: ‘You are seduced by the Evil Spirit; but listen: I read that long ago the truest and surest oracles were not those delivered in writing or uttered in words. Even people who were considered discriminating and intelligent were many a time misled over them, partly on account of the ambiguities, amphiboles and obscurities in the words, partly because of the terseness of the judgements. That is why Apollo, the god of divination, was called Loxias (‘oblique’) in Greek. Oracles expounded by [gestures and] signs were deemed truest and surest. Such was the opinion of Heraclitus. And thus [did Jupiter vaticinate at Amon and ] Apollo prophesy amongst the Assyrians, which is why they portrayed Apollo with a long beard, as a venerable old person of settled wisdom, not naked, young and beardless as portrayed by the Greeks. ‘Let us employ that method and seek advice from someone who is dumb, using signs not words.’","PANTAGRUEL, when this Discourse was ended, held for a pretty while his Peace, seeming to be exceeding sad and pensive, then said to Panurge, the malignant Spirit misleads, beguileth and seduceth you. I have read that in times past the surest and most veritable Oracles were not those which either were delivered in Writing, or utter’d by word of Mouth in speaking: For many times, in their Interpretation, right witty, learned and ingenious Men have been deceived thro’ Amphibologies, Equivoks, and Obscurity of Words, no less than by the brevity of their Sentences. For which cause Apollo, the God of Vaticination, was surnamed λοίας. Those which were represented then by Signs and outward Gestures were accounted the truest and the most infallible. Such was the Opinion of Heraclitus: And Jupiter did himself in this manner give forth in Amon frequently Predictions: Nor was he single in this Practice; for Apollo did the like amongst the Assyrians. His prophesying thus unto those People, moved them to paint him with a large long Beard, and Cloaths beseeming an old setled Person, of a most posed, stayed and grave Behaviour; not naked, young and beardless, as he was pourtrayed most usually amongst the Grœcians. Let us make trial of this kind of Fatidicency; and go you take Advice of some dumb Person without any speaking."

"À quoi obtempérant Carpalim, partit soudain, et fit comme avait été décrété par Pantagruel, et sortirent de la ville tous les combattants qui y étaient, et alors qu’il eut mis le feu par les tentes et pavillons, passait légèrement par sur eux sans qu’ils en sentissent rien, tant ils ronflaient et dormaient parfondément[25]. Il vint au lieu où était l’artillerie, et mit le feu en leurs munitions ; mais ce fut le danger. Le feu fut si soudain qu’il cuida[26] embraser le pauvre Carpalim, et n’eût été sa merveilleuse hâtiveté, il était fricassé comme un cochon. Mais il départit si roidement qu’un carreau d’arbalète ne va plus tôt.","Whereupon Carpalim obeyed, departed suddenly, and did as had been decreed by Pantagruel, and issued from the city all the combatants who were there, and when he had set fire through the tents and pavilions, passed lightly over them without let them feel nothing of it, they snored and slept soundly. He came to the place where the artillery was, and set fire to their ammunition; but that was the danger. The fire was so sudden that it cooked[26] to set poor Carpalim ablaze, and had it not been for his marvelous haste he was fricasseed like a pig. But he leaves so stiffly that a crossbow bolt does not go sooner.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Carpalin obeying him, departed suddenly, and did as he was appointed by Pantagruel, and all the Combatants came forth that were in the City, and, when he had set fire in the tents and pavillions, he past so lightly through them, and so highly and profoundly did they snort and sleep, that they never perceived him. He came to the place where their Artillery was, and set their munition on fire: but here was the danger, the fire was so sudden, that poor Carpalin had almost been burnt; and had it not been for his wonderful agility, he had been fried like a roasting pig: but he departed away so speedily, that a bolt or arrow out of a Crossebowe could not have had a swifter motion."
"« Quartement, par fervente étude, car en icelle est faite incrédible[22] résolution[23] des esprits, tellement qu’il n’en reste de quoi pousser aux lieux destinés cette résudation générative et enfler le nerf caverneux, duquel l’office est hors la projeter pour la propagation d’humaine nature. Qu’ainsi soit, contemplez la forme d’un homme attentif à quelque étude. Vous verrez en lui toutes les artères du cerveau bandées comme la corde d’une arbalète, pour lui fournir dextrement esprits suffisants à emplir les ventricules du sens commun, de l’imagination et appréhension, de la ratiocination[24] et résolution, de la mémoire et recordation[25], et agilement courir de l’un à l’autre par les conduits manifestes en anatomie sur la fin du rets admirable auquel se terminent les artères, lesquelles de la senestre armoire[26] du cœur prenaient leur origine, et les esprits vitaux affinaient en longs ambages pour être faits animaux. De mode qu’en tel personnage studieux vous verrez suspendues toutes les facultés naturelles, cesser tous sens extérieurs, bref vous le jugerez n’être en soi vivant, être hors soi abstrait par extase, et direz que Socrates n’abusait du terme quand il disait philosophie n’être autre chose que méditation de mort. Par aventure est ce pourquoi Démocritus s’aveugla, moins estimant la perte de la vue que diminution de ses contemplations, lesquelles il sentait interrompues par l’égarement des œils. Ainsi est vierge dite Pallas, déesse de sapience, tutrice des gens studieux. Ainsi sont les Muses vierges, ainsi demeurent les Charités en pudicité éternelle. Et me souvient avoir lu que Cupido, quelquefois interrogé de sa mère Vénus pourquoi il n’assaillait les Muses, répondit qu’il les trouvait tant belles, tant nettes[27], tant honnêtes, tant pudiques et continuellement occupées, l’une à contemplation des astres, l’autre à supputation des nombres, l’autre à dimension des corps géométriques, l’autre à invention rhétorique, l’autre à composition poétique, l’autre à disposition de musique, que, approchant d’elles, il débandait son arc, fermait sa trousse et éteignait son flambeau par honte et crainte de leur nuire, puis ôtait le bandeau de ses yeux pour plus apertement[28] les voir en face et ouïr leurs plaisants chants et odes poétiques. Là prenait le plus grand plaisir du monde, tellement que, souvent, il se sentait tout ravi en leurs beautés et bonnes grâces, et s’endormait à l’harmonie. Tant s’en faut qu’il les voulût assaillir ou de leurs études distraire.","""Quarterly, by fervent study, for in it is made the incredible[22] resolution[23] of the spirits, so much that there is nothing left to push to the places intended this generative resudation and to swell the cavernous nerve, from which the office is out to plan for the propagation of human nature. So be it, contemplate the form of a man attentive to some study. You will see in him all the arteries of the brain bent like the string of a crossbow, to supply him dexterously sufficient spirits to fill the ventricles with common sense, with imagination and apprehension, with ratiocination[24] and resolution, with memory and recordation[25], and nimbly run from one to the other through the ducts manifest in anatomy on the end of the admirable net at which the arteries terminate, which from the sinister cupboard[26] of the heart took their origin, and the vital spirits refined in long ambages to be made animals. In such a way that in such a studious personage you will see all the natural faculties suspended, all exterior senses cease, in short you will judge him to be only living in himself, to be outside himself abstracted by ecstasy, and will say that Socrates did not misuse the term when he said philosophy to be nothing but meditation on death. By chance this is why Democritus blinded himself, less estimating the loss of sight than the diminution of his contemplations, which he felt interrupted by the bewilderment of the eyes. So is the virgin called Pallas, goddess of sapience, guardian of studious people. So are the virgin Muses, so dwell the Charities in eternal modesty. And I remember having read that Cupido, sometimes questioned by his mother Venus why he did not assail the Muses, answered that he found them so beautiful, so neat[27], so honest, so modest and continually occupied, one in contemplation of the stars, the other to the calculation of numbers, the other to the dimension of geometrical bodies, the other to rhetorical invention, the other to poetic composition, the other at the disposal of music, that, approaching them, he unstrung his bow, closed his case and extinguished his torch out of shame and fear of harming them, then took off the blindfold from his eyes to see them face to face more keenly[28] and hear their pleasant songs and poetic odes. There he took the greatest pleasure in the world, so much so that he often felt delighted in their beauty and good graces, and fell asleep in harmony. Far from wanting to assail them or distract them from their studies.","‘Fourthly: by fervent study, for in that activity is produced such an unbelievable dispersal of the spirits that not enough are left to drive the seminal secretion to its intended organs and so to swell up the vena cava, the duty of which is to ejaculate it for the propagation of humankind. ‘That such is the case, contemplate the form of a man concentrating on any subject of study: you will see all the arteries of his brain as taut as the string of a cross-bow in order skilfully to provide enough spirits to fill the ventricles of his common sense – that is, of his imagination, apprehension, ratiocination and judgement, memory and recall – and to flow expeditiously from one to the other through the conduits at the extremities of the rete mirabile (manifest in dissections) in which terminate those arteries which originate in the left ventricle of the heart and which, along their complex circuits, refine the vital spirits into animal spirits: with the result that in such a studious person you will see all his natural faculties suspended and all his external senses cease: in short, you would conclude that he no longer lives inside himself but is abstracted out of himself by ecstasy, and you would say that Socrates did not abuse the term when he said that philosophy was nothing else than practising dying. ‘That may perhaps explain why Democritus blinded himself, preferring to lose his sight rather than decrease his contemplations which he felt to be interrupted by his restless eyes. Thus Pallas, the goddess of Wisdom, the protectrix of studious folk, is called Virgin; virgin too are the Muses; and the Graces dwell externally in chastity. ‘And I remember having read that when Cupid was once asked by Venus his mother why he never shot at the Muses, he replied that he found them so beautiful, so pure, so comely, so chaste, and all so continuously occupied – one in contemplating the heavenly bodies, one in calculating numbers, one in measuring geometrical figures, one in devising rhetoric, one in writing poetry and another in composing music – that as he drew near them he unbent his bow, pressed shut his quiver and doused his torch, in fear and trembling lest he should harm them; then he stripped the blindfold from his eyes so as to have a clearer view of their faces and listen to their chants and their poetic songs, finding in them the greatest pleasure in the world, so much so that he often felt himself caught away by their beauties and moral graces and lulled to sleep by their harmony: far be it from him to wish to shoot at them or distract them from their studies.","Fourthly, The tickling pricks of Incontinency are blunted by an eager Study; for from thence proceedeth an incredible resolution of the Spirits, that oftentimes there do not remain so many behind as may suffice to push and thrust forwards the Generative Resudation to the places thereto appropriated, and therewithal inflate the Cavernous Nerve; whose Office is to ejaculate the Moisture for the Propagation of Humane Progeny. Least you should think it is not so, be pleased but to contemplate a little the Form, Fashion, and Carriage of a Man exceeding earnestly set upon some Learned Meditation, and deeply plunged therein, and you shall see how all the Arteries of his Brain are stretched forth, and bent like the String of a Crossbow, the more promptly, dexterously, and copiously to suppeditate, furnish, and supply him with Store of Spirits, sufficient to replenish and fill up the Ventricles, Seats, Tunnels, Mansions, Receptacles, and Celluls of the common Sense; of the Imagination, Apprehension, and Fancy; of the Ratiocination, Arguing, and Resolution; as likewise of the Memory, Recordation, and Remembrance; and with great alacrity, nimbleness, and agility to run, pass, and course from the one to the other, through those Pipes, Windings, and Conduits, which to skilful Anatomists are perceivable, at the end of the Wonderful Net, where all the Arteries close in a terminating Point: which Arteries taking their rise and origine from the left Capsul of the Heart, bring through several Circuits, Ambages, and Anfractuosities the Vital, to subtilize and refine them to the Ætherial Purity of Animal Spirits. Nay, in such a studiously musing Person, you may espy so extravagant Raptures of one, as it were, out of himself, that all his Natural Faculties for that time will seem to be suspended from each their proper charge and office, and his exteriour Senses to be at a stand. In a word, you cannot otherways choose then think, that he is by an extraordinary Extasie quite transported out of what he was, or should be; and that Socrates did not speak improperly, when he said, That Philosophy was nothing else but a Meditation upon Death. This possibly is the reason, why Democritus deprived himself of the Sense of Seeing, prizing at a much lower rate the loss of his Sight, than the diminution of his Contemplations; which he frequently had found disturbed by the vagrant, flying-out strayings of his unsetled and roving Eyes. Therefore is it, that Pallas, the Goddess of Wisdom, Tutress, and Guardianess of such as are diligently studious, and painfully industrious, is, and hath been still accounted a Virgin. The Muses upon the same Consideration are esteemed perpetual Maids: And the Graces for the like reason, have been held to continue in a sempiternal Pudicity. I remember to have read, that Cupid on a time being asked of his Mother Venus, why he did not assault and set upon the Muses, his Answer was, That he found them so fair, so sweet, so fine, so neat, so wise, so learned, so modest, so discreet, so courteous, so vertuous, and so continually busied and employed. One in the Speculation of the Stars; another in the Supputation of Numbers; the Third in the Dimension of Geometrical Quantities; the Fourth in the Composition of Heroick Poems; the Fifth in the jovial Interludes of a Comick Strain; the Sixth in the stately Gravity of a Tragick Vein; the Seventh in the Melodious Disposition of Musical Airs; the Eighth in the compleatest manner of Writing Histories, and Books on all sorts of Subjects; and the Ninth in the Mysteries, Secrets, and Curiosities of all Sciences, Faculties, Disciplines, and Arts whatsoever, whether Liberal or Mechanick; that approaching near unto them, he unbended his Bow, shut his Quiver, and extinguished his Torch, through meer shame and fear, that by mischance he might do them some hurt or prejudice: Which done, he thereafter put off the Fillet wherewith his Eyes were bound, to look them in the Face, and to hear their Melody and Poetick Odes.

"« Au contraire, représentez-vous un monde autre, onquel[1] un chacun prête, un chacun doive, tous soient débiteurs, tous soient prêteurs. O quelle harmonie sera parmi les réguliers mouvements des cieux ! Il m’est avis que je l’entends aussi bien que fit onque Platon. Quelle sympathie entre les éléments ! O comment nature s’y délectera en ses œuvres et productions ! Cérès, chargée de blés, Bacchus, de vins, Flora ; de fleurs, Pomona, de fruits, Juno, en son air serein, sereine ; salubre, plaisante. Je me perds en cette contemplation. Entre les humains, paix, amour, dilection, fidélité, repos, banquets, festins, joie, liesse, or, argent, menue monnaie, chaînes, bagues ; marchandises, trotteront de main en main. Nul procès, nulle guerre, nul débat. Nul n’y sera usurier, nul lêchart[2], nul chichart, nul refusant. Vrai Dieu, ne sera-ce l’âge d’or, le règne de Saturne, l’idée des régions olympiques, esquelles toutes autres vertus cessent[3], charité seule règne, régente, domine, triomphe ? Tous seront bons, tous seront beaux, tous seront justes. O monde heureux ! ô gens de cetui monde heureux ! ô béats trois et quatre fois ! Il m’est avis que j’y suis. Je vous jure le bon vrai bis[4] que si cetui monde, béat monde, ainsi à un chacun prêtant, rien ne refusant, eût pape foisonnant en cardinaux et associé de son sacré collège, en peu d’années vous y verriez les saints plus drus, plus miraclifiques[5], à plus de leçons, plus de vœux, plus de bâtons et plus de chandelles que ne sont tous ceux des neuf évêchés de Bretagne. Exceptez seulement saint Yves.","“On the contrary, imagine another world, where[1] everyone lends, everyone owes, everyone is a debtor, everyone is a lender.

O how nature will delight in its works and productions! Ceres, laden with corn, Bacchus, with wine, Flora; of flowers, Pomona, of fruit, Juno, in her serene, serene air; healthy, pleasant. I lose myself in this contemplation. Between humans, peace, love, dilection, fidelity, rest, banquets, feasts, joy, jubilation, gold, silver, small change, chains, rings; goods, will trot from hand to hand. No trial, no war, no debate. No one will be usurer there, no lechart[2], no chichart, no refusal. True God, will it not be the golden age, the reign of Saturn, the idea of the Olympic regions, in which all other virtues cease [3], charity alone reigns, reigns, dominates, triumphs? All will be good, all will be beautiful, all will be just. O happy world! O people of this happy world! O blessed three and four times! I think I'm there. I swear to you the good true bis[4] that if this world, blissful world, thus to everyone lending, refusing nothing, had a pope teeming with cardinals and associated with his sacred college, in a few years you would see the saints there. thicker, more miraculous[5], with more lessons, more wishes, more sticks and more candles than are all those of the nine bishoprics of Brittany.

I believe I can hear it as well as Plato once did.4 ‘What sympathy between the elements! O how Nature will delight in the fruits she there brings forth: Ceres laden with corn, Bacchus with wine, Flora with flowers, Pomona with fruit: Juno, health-giving, delightful, and all serene in her air serene! ‘I lose myself in such contemplation. Between human beings, from hand to hand there would trot peace, love, affection, faithfulness, repose, banquets, feastings, joy, happiness, gold, silver, petty cash, necklaces, rings and merchandise. No lawsuits: no wars: no contentions: there, no one will be a usurer, no one rapacious, no one tight-fisted, no one will ever turn you down. True God! Will it not be the Age of Gold, the Reign of Saturn, the Idea of those Olympic regions in which all other virtues cease while Charity reigns, rules, directs and triumphs alone? Everybody will be good, everyone beautiful, everyone just. ‘O happy world! O inhabitants of that happy world. O folk thrice and four times blessèd! I think I am there already! I swear to you by our Good Gosh that if in that world, [that blessèd world, thus lending to all and refusing none,] they had a pope abounding in cardinals and in fellowship with his Sacred College, then in the space of a few years you would see saints more thick on the ground, working more miracles, with more vows, lessons, banners and candles than all the saints of the nine bishoprics of Brittany, excepting only Saint Ives.","ON the contrary, be pleased to represent unto your Fancy another World, wherein every one lendeth, and every one oweth, all are Debtors, and all Creditors.

Good God! Will not this be the Golden Age in the Reign of Saturn? The true Idea of the Olympick Regions, wherein all Vertues cease; Charity alone ruleth, governeth, domineereth and triumpheth? All will be fair and goodly People there, all just and vertuous. O happy World! O People of that World most happy! Yea, thrice and four times blessed is that People! I think in very deed that I am amongst them, and swear to you, by my good Forsooth, that if this glorious aforesaid World had a Pope, abounding with Cardinals, that so he might have the Association of a Sacred Colledge, in the space of very few years you should be sure to see the Sancts much thicker in the Roll, more numerous, wonder-working and mirifick, more Services, more Vows, more Staves and Wax-Candles than are all those in the Nine Bishopricks of Britany, St. Yves only excepted.

26. Comment frère Jean réconforte Panurge sur le doute de cocuage,26. How Brother John Comforts Panurge on Doubt of Cuckoldry,"CHAPTER 28 [Panurge’s rhetoric fails to convince even himself. He becomes the ageing comic husband of the farces, destined to be cuckolded, bullied and robbed by his future wife. The ‘Motor Intelligences’ are moral and spiritual beings who guide the heavenly bodies and may show their approval of spiritual men and women. Panurge would dislocate the whole universe if he were ever successfully to oppose them. He would be acting ‘worse than the Giants’ (who attacked the gods by piling Mount Pelion on to Mount Ossa). Cf. Erasmus, Adages, III, X, XCIII, ‘The Arrogance of the Giants’, cited again in Chapter 51. The basic tale of the ring that saves from cuckoldom appears in Poggio, Ariosto and the Cent nouvelles nouvelles. The epithets applied to Panurge’s bollocks suggest flaccidity, weakness and bad qualities generally. The text given is essentially that of the first edition with the additions as usual in square brackets, but some epithets were dropped: they figure in the notes.]",CHAPTER XXVIII How Friar Ihon comforteth Panurge in the doubtful matter of Cuckoldry.
"Là me souvint du vénérable abbé de Castilliers, celui qui ne daignait biscoter ses chambrières nisi in pontificalibus, lequel, importuné de ses parents et amis de résigner sur ses vieux jours son abbaye, dit et protesta que point ne se dépouillerait devant soi coucher, et que le dernier pet que ferait sa paternité serait un pet d’abbé.","There I remembered the venerable Abbé de Castilliers, the one who did not deign to biscouse his chambermaids nisi in pontificalibus, who, importuned by his relatives and friends to resign his abbey to his old age, said and protested that no one would strip himself before going to bed, and that the last fart his paternity would make would be a priest's fart.","Which made me think of that venerable abbot of Castilliers, who deigned to lie with his chamber-maids only when clad in full canonicals. As he was getting old he was badgered by his family and friends to resign his Abbey; he stated and declared that he would never give up before he was laid out, and that the last fart as his Paternity would be the fart of an abbot. How our ship ran aground; and how we were succoured by voyagers who were vassals of Quintessence CHAPTER 17 [There is a break in subject here. This and the following chapters show a concern with alchemy. The philosopher whose wisdom was summed up with the saying ‘Bear and forbear’ was the Cynic Epictetus. Erasmus (in Adages, II, VII, XIII, ‘Sustine et abstine’ (that is ‘Bear and forebear’) explains that we should ‘abstain’ from illicit things fab illicitis temperemus). The author here thinks temperemus means we should temporize (not, abstain). A real gaffe. ‘So many valets: so many enemies’ figures amongst the Adages of Erasmus (I, III, XXXI) where there is no word of Plautus but much about Seneca, who said it, and Plato. ‘To avoid Scylla and fall into Charybdis’ is a commonplace, but also an adage of Erasmus (I, V, IV). ‘Castor and Pollux above the sails’ was what the Ancients called Saint Elmo’s fire.","Do you never commit dry Bobs, or Flashes in the Pan?"
"– Bonne, répondit Pantagruel, antique et authentique, c’est par songes, car, en songeant, avec conditions lesquelles décrivent Hippocrates, lib. Peri enypnion, Platon, Plotin, Jamblique, Synésius, Aristotèles, Xénophon, Galien, Plutarque, Artémidorus Daldianus, Hérophilus, Quintus Calaber, Théocrite, Pline, Athéneus et autres, l’âme souvent prévoit les choses futures. Jà n’est besoin plus au long vous le prouver. Vous l’entendez, par exemple vulgaire, quand vous voyez, lorsque les enfants bien nettis[1], bien repus et allaités, dorment profondément, les nourrices s’en aller ébattre en liberté, comme pour icelle heure licenciées[2] à faire ce que voudront, car leur présence autour du bers[3] semblerait inutile. En cette façon notre âme, lorsque le corps dort et que la concoction[4] est de tous endroits parachevée, rien plus n’étant nécessaire jusques au réveil, s’ébat et revoit sa patrie qui est le ciel. De là, reçoit participation insigne de sa prime et divine origine, et, en contemplation de cette infinie et intellectuelle sphère, le centre de laquelle est en chacun lieu de l’univers, la circonférence point (c’est Dieu, selon la doctrine de Hermès Trismégistus), à laquelle rien n’advient, rien ne passe, rien ne déchoit, tous temps sont présents, note non seulement les choses passées en mouvements inférieurs, mais aussi les futures, et les rapportant à son corps, et par les sens et organes d’icelui, les exposant aux amis, est dite vaticinatrice et prophète.","“Good,” replied Pantagruel, “ancient and authentic,” it is by dreams, for, in dreaming, with conditions which describe Hippocrates, lib. Peri Enypnion, Plato, Plotinus, Iamblichus, Synesius, Aristoteles, Xenophon, Galen, Plutarch, Artemidorus Daldianus, Herophilus, Quintus Calaber, Theocritus, Pliny, Atheneus and others, the soul often foresees future things. There is no longer any need to prove it to you. You hear it, for example vulgar, when you see, when the children are well groomed[1], well sated and breastfed, sleeping soundly, the nurses go and frolic in freedom, as for this hour dismissed[2] to do what they want, because their presence around the bers[3] would seem useless. In this way our soul, when the body sleeps and the concoction [4] is in all places completed, nothing more being necessary until awakening, frolics and sees its homeland which is heaven. From there, receives insignia participation of its prime and divine origin, and, in contemplation of this infinite and intellectual sphere, the center of which is in each place of the universe, the circumference point (it is God, according to the doctrine of Hermes Trismegistus), to which nothing happens, nothing passes, nothing fails, all times are present, notes not only past things in lower movements, but also future ones, and relating them to his body, and through the senses and organs of it, exposing them to friends, is said to be vaticinator and prophet.","‘A good, ancient and valid one,’ said Pantagruel: ‘by dreams. For by dreaming – under the conditions described by Hippocrates in his book On Dreams, by Plato, Plotinus, Iamblicus, Synesius, Aristotle, Xenophon, Galen, Plutarch, Artemidorus Daldianus, Herophilus, [Quintus Calaber, Theocritus, Pliny, Athenaeus] and others – the soul often foresees what is to come. ‘There is no need to prove that to you at greater length. You will grasp it from a common analogy: you know how nurses, after their babes have been properly changed, properly fed and given the breast, and lie soundly asleep, can freely go out and enjoy themselves, being granted leave, as it were, to do what they want for an hour since their presence about the cradle would seem unnecessary: in the same way each of our souls, while her body is asleep and concoction has been completed in all its stages, can go and enjoy herself, revisiting her homeland in Heaven, since nothing more is required of her before we awake. ‘From there she is granted the signal favour of participating in her primal and divine origin and of contemplating that infinite [and Intellectual] Sphere | whose centre is in every place in the universe and whose circumference nowhere: God, that is, by the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus] in whom there is no becoming, no transience, no waning, all times being the present; there she discerns not only things past amongst the motions here below but also things to come; she bears them back to her body, and as she expounds them to friends via her body’s organs and senses she is termed prophetic and vaticinatory.","Of a good Ancient and Authentick Fashion, (answered Pantagruel) it is by Dreams: For in Dreaming, such Circumstances and Conditions being thereto adhibited, as are clearly enough described by Hippocrates in Lib. Περὶ ἐνυπνίων, by Plato, Plotin, Iamblicus, Sinesius, Aristotle, Xenophon, Galene, Plutarch, Artemidorus Valdianus, Herophilus, Q. Calaber, Theocritus, Pliny, Athenœus, and others, the Soul doth often times foresee what is to come. How true this is, you may conceive by a very vulgar and familiar Example; as when you see that at such a time as Suckling Babes, well nourished, fed and foster’d with good Milk, sleep soundly and profoundly, the Nurses in the interim get leave to sport themselves, and are licentiated to recreate their Fancies at what Range to them shall seem most fitting and expedient; their Presence, Sedulity and Attendance on the Cradle, being, during all that space, held unnecessary. Even just so, when our Body is at Rest, that the Concoction is every where accomplished, and that, till it awake, it lacks for nothing, our Soul delighteth to disport it self, and is well-pleased in that Frolick to take a Review of its Native Country, which is the Heavens, where it receiveth a most notable Participation of its first beginning, with an Imbuement from its Divine Source, and in Contemplation of that Infinite and Intellectual Sphere, whereof the Center is every where, and the Circumference in no place of the universal World, to wit, God, according to the Doctrine of Hermes Trismegistus, to whom no new thing hapneth, whom nothing that is past escapeth, and unto whom all things are alike present, remarketh not only what is preterit, and gone in the inferiour Course and Agitation of sublunary matters, but withal taketh notice what is to come; then bringing a Relation of those future Events unto the Body by the outward Senses and exterior Organs, it is divulged abroad unto the hearing of others. Whereupon the Owner of that Soul deserveth to be termed a Vaticinator, or Prophet."
"– De ce chat ? répondit Panurge. Je me donne au diable si je ne pensais que fût un diableteau à poil follet, lequel naguère j’avais capiètement[23] happé en tapinois, à belles mouffles[24] d’un bas de chausses, dedans la grande huche d’enfer. Au diable soit le diable ! Il m’a ici déchiqueté la peau en barbe d’écrevisse. » Ce disant, jeta bas son chat.","– Of this cat? answered Panurge. I'd give myself to the devil if I didn't think it was a wild-haired devil, which I had lately [23] snatched up stealthily, nicely mitten[24] from a stocking, inside the big hutch from hell . To hell be the devil! Here he shredded my skin into a crayfish beard. So saying, threw down his cat.","‘Cat!!!’ replied Panurge. ‘The devil take me if I didn’t think it was that mangy little devilkin I once smartly and quietly nabbed in the great Hutch of Hell, using my stocking as a mitten. To the devil with this devil! ‘It’s lacerated my skin like the beard of a crayfish!’ So saying, he threw the cat down.","Fryar Jhon stopping the handle of his Face with his Left-hand, did, with the Fore-finger of the Right, point out Panurge’s Shirt to Pantagruel; who, seeing him in this Pickle, scar’d, appall’d, shivering, raving, staring, beray’d, and torn with the Claws of the famous Cat Rodilardus, could not chuse but Laugh, and said to him, Pr’ythee what wouldst thou do with this Cat? With this Cat, quoth Panurge, the Devil scratch me, if I did not think it had been a young Soft-chin’d Devil, which, with this same Stocking instead of Mittain, I had snatch’d up in the great Hutch of Hell, as Thievishly as any Sizar of Montague College could ha’ done. The Devil take Tybert , I feel it has all bespink’d my poor Hide, and drawn on it to the Life I don’t know how many Lobster’s Whiskers: with this he threw his Boar-Cat down."
"– Je ne sais, dit le marchand, si vous êtes clerc. J’ai vu prou[6] de clercs, je dis grands clercs, cocus. Oui dà. À propos, si vous étiez clerc, vous sauriez que, ès membres plus inférieurs de ces animaux divins (ce sont les pieds) y a un os (c’est le talon, l’astragale, si vous voulez) duquel, non d’autre animal du monde, fors de l’âne Indien et des dorcades[7] de Lybie, l’on jouait antiquement au royal jeu des tales[8], auquel l’empereur Octavien Auguste un soir gagna plus de 50,000 écus. Vous autres cocus n’avez garde d’en gagner autant.","""I don't know,"" said the merchant, ""if you are a clerk."" I saw prou[6] of clerks, I say great clerks, cuckolds. Yes Da. By the way, if you were a cleric, you would know that in the lower limbs of these divine animals (these are the feet) there is a bone (the heel, the astragalus, if you like) of which, not of another animal in the world, made up of the Indian donkey and the Dorcades[7] of Libya, the royal game of tales[8] was played in ancient times, at which the Emperor Octavian Augustus one evening won more than 50,000 crowns. You cuckolds don't take care to earn so much.","‘I don’t know whether you are a scholar,’ said the merchant, ‘but I’ve known many a scholar – I mean important ones – who were cuckolds. Yes indeed. By the way, if you were a scholar you’d know that there lies within the lowest limbs of these divine beasts – in their feet, that is, – bones, namely heels ( the astragali, if you prefer): with them alone, or else with bones from no other beasts save the asses of India and the gazelles of Libya, they used in ancient times to play the royal game of tali, at which the Emperor Octavian won 50,000 crowns in a single evening. Cuckolds like you haven’t a hope of winning that much!’","I don’t know whether you be a Scholar or no, pursued Dingdong. I have seen a World of Scholars, I say great Scholars, that were cuckolds, I’l assure you. But hark you me, if you were a Scholar, you should know that in the most inferiour members of those Animals (which are the feet) there is a bone (which is the heel) the Astragalus, if you will have it so, wherewith, and with that of no other Creature breathing, except the Indian Ass, and the Dorcades of Libya, they us’d in old times to play at the Royal game of Dice, whereat Augustus the Emperour won above fifty thousand Crowns one Evening. Now such Cuckolds as you will be hang’d ere you get half so much at it."

"– Je le veux, répondit Panurge. Allons-y, Épistémon, de ce pas, de peur que mort ne le prévienne. Veux-tu venir, frère Jean ?","“I want it,” replied Panurge. Let's go, Epistemon, now, lest death prevent him. Do you want to come, brother Jean?","‘I want to,’ said Panurge. ‘Let us go there straight away, Epistemon, lest death should forestall us. Do you want to come, Frère Jean?’","I am content (quoth Panurge) let us go thither Epistemon, and that both instantly and in all hast, lest otherways his Death prevent our coming. Wilt thou come along with us, Fryar Jhon?"
"« Bonjour, messieurs, dit Panurge, bonjour trestous. Vous vous portez bien trestous ? Dieu merci, et vous ? Vous soyez les bien et à propos venus. Descendons. Hespailliers[1], hau, jetez le pontal[2], approche cetui esquif. Vous aiderai-je encore là ? Je suis allouvi[3] et affamé de bien faire et travailler comme quatre bœufs. Vraiment voici un beau lieu et bonnes gens. Enfants, avez-vous encore affaire de mon aide ? N’épargnez la sueur de mon corps, pour l’amour de Dieu. Adam, c’est l’homme, naquit pour labourer et travailler, comme l’oiseau pour voler. Notre Seigneur veut, entendez-vous bien ? que nous mangeons notre pain en la sueur de nos corps, non pas rien ne faisant, comme ce penaillon[4] de moine que voyez, frère Jean, qui boit et meurt de peur. Voici beau temps. À cette heure connais-je la réponse d’Anacharsis le noble philosophe être véritable et bien en raison fondée, quand il, interrogé quelle navire lui semblait la plus sûre, répondit : « Celle qui serait on[5] port. »","""Hello, gentlemen,"" said Panurge, ""hello, trestous."" Are you doing very well? Thank God, and you? You are the right and timely comers. Let's go down. Hespailliers[1], hau, throw the pontal[2], approach this skiff. Will I still help you there? I am allouvi [3] and hungry to do well and work like four oxen. Really here is a beautiful place and good people. Children, do you still need my help? Spare the sweat of my body, for God's sake. Adam is man, born to plow and work, like a bird to fly. Our Lord wants, do you hear well? that we eat our bread in the sweat of our bodies, not doing nothing, like that cloak[4] of a monk that you see, Brother John, who drinks and dies of fear. Here is good weather. At this time do I know the answer of Anacharsis the noble philosopher to be true and well founded, when he, questioned which ship seemed to him the safest, replied: “The one that would be in port. »","‘Good morrow, gentlemen,’ said Panurge. ‘Good morrow to each one of you. [Is every one of you faring well, thanks to God and to you? Be most truly and timely welcome.] Let’s clamber ashore. [Ho there, ship’s-boys: lower the ladder and bring that pinnace alongside.] ‘Shall I help you again over there? ‘[I have a ravenous hunger for doing good and toiling away like four oxen. This is truly a beautiful place; and the people are good. Do you still need my help, lads? For God’s sake, spare not the sweat of my brow. Adam (that means, Man) is born to plough and to toil as a bird is born to fly. Our Lord wishes (do you hear it well?) that in the sweat of our face we do eat our bread – not by doing nothing at all like Frère Jean, that decrepit monk you can see tippling away over there and dying of fear.] ‘The fair weather has come. I now know the reply of that noble philosopher Anacharsis to be true and well founded in reason: asked which ship he believed to be safest: he replied, The one in the harbour.’","GOOD morrow, Gentlemen, said Panurge, Good morrow to you all, You are in very good Health, thanks to Heaven, and your selves? You are all heartily wellcome, and in good time. Let us go on shoar—Here, Coxen, get the Ladder over the Gunnel, Man the sides, Man the pinnace, and get her by the Ships side. — Shall I yet lend you a hand here? I am stark mad for want of business, and would work like any two yoaks of Oxen.—Truly this is a fine Place, and these look like a very good People. — Children, do you want me still in any thing, do not spare the sweat of my Body, for godsake. Adam (that is Man) was made to labour and work, as the Birds were made to fly; our Lord’s Will is that we get our bread with the sweat of our brows, not idling and doing nothing like this tatterdemallion of a Monk here, this Fryar Jack, who is fain to drink to hearten himself up, and dyes for fear.—Rare weather.—I now find the answer of Anacharsis, the noble Philosopher, very proper; being ask’d what Ship he reckon’d the safest; he reply’d, that which is in the Harbour: he made a yet better repartie, said Pantagruel, when some body inquiring which is greater, the number of the living, or that of the dead?"
"« Un autre y a. Si encore régnaient les oracles de Jupiter en Ammon, d’Apollo en Lebadie, Delphes, Délos, Cyrrhe, Patare, Tegyres, Préneste, Lycie, Colophon ; en la fontaine Castalie, près Antioche en Syrie ; entre les Branchides de Bacchus en Dodone ; de Mercure en Phares, près Patras ; d’Apis en Égypte ; de Sérapis en Canobe ; de Faunus en Ménalie et en Albunée, près Tivoli ; de Tirésias en Orchomène ; de Mopsus en Cilicie ; d’Orpheus en Lesbos ; de Trophonius en Leucadie, je serais d’avis (par aventure non serais) y aller et entendre quel serait leur jugement sur votre entreprise. Mais vous savez que tous sont devenus plus muets que poissons, depuis la venue du Roi servateur[18], onquel ont pris fin tous oracles et toutes prophéties, comme advenante la lumière du clair soleil, disparaissent tous lutins, lamies, lémures, garoux, farfadets et ténébrions[19]. Or, toutefois qu’encore fussent en règne, ne conseillerais-je facilement ajouter foi à leurs réponses. Trop de gens y ont été trompés.","“Another there is. If the oracles of Jupiter in Ammon, of Apollo in Lebadia, Delphi, Delos, Cyrrh, Patare, Tegyres, Praeneste, Lycia, Colophon still reigned; in the Castalian fountain, near Antioch in Syria; between the Branchides of Bacchus in Dodona; of Mercury in Phares, near Patras; of Apis in Egypt; of Serapis in Canobe; of Faunus in Menalia and Albunea, near Tivoli; of Tiresias in Orchomenus; from Mopsus in Cilicia; from Orpheus to Lesbos; of Trophonius in Leucadia, I would (hopefully not) go there and hear what their judgment would be of your enterprise. But you know that all have become dumber than fish since the coming of the Servant King[18], on whom all oracles and all prophecies have come to an end, as when the light of the bright sun comes, all goblins, lamias, lemures, werewolves disappear, leprechauns and mealworms[19]. Now, however they were still in reign, would I not advise easily to believe their answers. Too many people have been deceived there.","‘And now for another. ‘If the oracles – of [Jupiter in Amon], of Apollo in Lebadia, Delphi, Delos, Patara, Cyrrha, Tegyra, Praeneste, Lycia and Colophon [and in the fountain to be found amongst the Branchides of Castalia near Antioch in Syria]; or of Bacchus in Dodona; of Mercury in Pharae near Patras; of Apis in Egypt; of Serapis in Canopus; of Faunus in Maenalia and Albunaea near Tivoli; of Tyresias in Orchomene; of Mopsus in Cilicia; of Orpheus in Lesbos, and of Trophonius in Leucadia – still held sway, I would (though perhaps I wouldn’t) counsel you to go and hear what their judgement on your undertaking might be. ‘But as you know, they have all become as mute as fishes since the advent of our great Servator King, in whom all oracles and all prophecies found an end: as with the advent of the bright light of the sun there vanish all hobgoblins, lamias, lemurs, werewolves, bogies and spirits of darkness. ‘Even if those oracles did still hold sway, I would not readily advise you to trust in their replies. Too many people have been deceived in them. ‘I recall, moreover, that Agrippina rebuked the fair Lollia for asking the oracle of Apollo Clarius whether she would be married to the Emperor Claudius; for which Lollia was first banished and subsequently put ignominiously to death.’ ‘But let us do something better,’ said Panurge. ‘The Ogygian Isles are not far from Saint Malo. Let us sail to them, having first spoken of it to our King. In one of those four isles (the one most facing the setting sun) they say – and I have read it in good and ancient authors – that many soothsayers, vaticinators and prophets dwell, and that Saturn lies bound there in beautiful chains of gold upon a golden rock, where he is fed on ambrosia and celestial nectar brought daily to him in abundance from the heavens by birds whose species I do not know (perhaps the very same crows which fed Saint Paul, the first anchorite in the wilderness): there he clearly prophesies to anyone who wants to learn of his lot, his destiny and what is to befall him. For the Fates spin nothing and Jupiter plans nothing, contemplates nothing which chat good Father Saturn does not know while he lies sleeping. ‘It would greatly abbreviate our labour if we were to hear him a while over this perplexity of mine.’ ‘That,’ said Epistemon, ‘is too evident an abuse and a fable too fabulous. I will not go.’ How Panurge took counsel from Herr Trippa CHAPTER 25 [The caricature-figure of Herr Trippa is doubtless a laugh at the expense of Henry Cornelius Agrippa, the German author of a treatise On Occult Philosophy and of a very widely read book On the Vanity of All Sciences and of the Excellence of the Word of God. The erudition in this chapter belongs to the common domain, much of it to be found in Cardano amongst others and (later) in Pictorius. For the definitive edition of the Third Book Rabelais also borrowed extra details from Celio Calcagnini, an author who was to revolutionize his art in the Fourth Book. The ‘Mons Jovis’ (Jove’s mountain) is the small swelling at the base of the index-finger. Astrologers established a ‘Celestial Mansion’ as part of the art of divination. The seventh ‘house’ was that of marriage. A comic song sung about Court begins ‘When all the cuckolds congregate, My husband will lead them, carrying the banner’. We have the joy of witnessing a maniacal expert in the occult arts being accused by Panurge of precisely the faults of philautia which are so manifest in himself and which he ought first to be condemning ‘at home’. A vital part is played by a clutch of authoritative axioms against self-love, drawn from the same two or three pages of the Adages of Erasmus. They include, but are not limited to: the Socratic saying (I, VI, LXXXV), ‘Things are done right or wrong at home’ – where Rabelais came across polypragmôn, Plutarch’s name for a prying busybody; (I, VI, LXXXVI), ‘To go down into oneself; the scriptural saying (I, VI, XCI), ‘To cast the beam from another’s eye’; and, not least, (I, VI, XCV), ‘Know Thyself’. Several other adages to be found on those pages of Erasmus are, have been or will be pressed into service. From I, VI, LXXXVIII, ‘Live within your own harvest’ (wisdom which Panurge had so blatantly flouted in his praise of debts and debtors) Rabelais took the word ptôchalazôn, a braggart-beggar. He had already taken from them the adage ‘We do not see what is in the pouch behind us’. Cf. Chapter 15.] ‘All the same,’ said Epistemon, continuing, ‘if you trust me, this is what you will do before we return to our king. Here, near I’lle-Bouchard, there dwells Herr Trippa. You know how he foretells the future by the arts of astrology, geomancy, chiromancy [, metopomancy] and others of the same kidney. Let us discuss your matter with him.’ ‘I know nothing about that,’ Panurge replied, ‘but this I do know, that while he was talking to the great king about matters celestial and transcendental, the menservants of the Court were swiving his wife at will, on the stairs and in the doorways, she being not unattractive. He, who could see all things empyreal and terrestrial without goggles, who was holding forth about all things past and present, and predicting all that is to come, failed in one thing: to see her jiggedy-jigging. And he never got news of it either. ‘All right. Since you want to, let us go to him. One can never learn too much.’ They arrived next day at the house of Herr Trippa. Panurge gave him a wolf-skin robe, an ornately gilt short-sword in a velvet scabbard and fifty fine golden angelots. He then began to discuss with him privily about his affair. As soon as Herr Trippa set eyes on him he looked him straight in the face and said: ‘You have the physiognomy and the metoposcopy of a cuckold: I mean a disgraced and notorious cuckold.’ Then, studying Panurge’s right palm at every point, he said: ‘This broken line on your Mons Jovis is never found except in the palm of a cuckold.’ He then rapidly pricked at a certain number of points with a probe, linked them together by geomancy and said: ‘No truth more true: it is quite certain that you will be cuckolded soon after your marriage.’ Which done, he asked Panurge for his natal horoscope. As soon as he gave it to him, Herr Trippa established Panurge’s Celestial House in all its particulars and, musing over its disposition and the aspects in their triplicities, he heaved a mighty sigh and said: ‘I had already frankly predicted that you will be a cuckold. In that you cannot fail. And here I find a new additional certainty: I confirm that you will be cuckolded, and moreover that you will also be battered and robbed by your wife. For I find the Seventh Mansion to be malign in all its aspects and subject to assaults by all the signs of the Zodiac bearing horns, such as Aries, Taurus, Capricorn and so on. In the Fourth Mansion I find Jupiter in decline as well as with Saturn in a tetragonal aspect with Mercury. ‘My good fellow, you are in for a good peppering!’ ‘I’ll visit you with a quartan ague first,’ Panurge replied, ‘[you idiot,] you disgusting old fool! When all the cuckolds congregate, you’ll be carrying the banner! But whence comes this flesh-worm here twixt my two fingers?’ So saying he pointed his first two fingers straight at Herr Trippa, spreading them wide to form two horns while bending his thumb and the other fingers into his palm.13 Then he said to Epistemon: ‘Behold the original Ollus in Martial, who devoted all his study to observing the maladies and misfortunes of others; meanwhile his wife was on a debauch. He, on the other hand, poorer than Irus ever was, remained as boastful, as overweening and as unbearable as seventeen devils: in a word, a ptôchalazôn, as the Ancients most properly termed such scurrilous rabble. ‘Let’s leave this loony idiot with his familiar spirits – he ought to be chained up – raving away to his heart’s content. Convince me some day that evil-spirits would serve such a wretch! He is ignorant of the first line of philosophy, which is KNOW THYSELF, and while boasting that he can see a mote in the eye of another he fails to see a great beam poking out of both of his. He is just the kind of polypragmon whom Plutarch describes; he is a second Lamia, she whose eyes were sharper than a lynx’s in the houses of others, in public and amongst the common folk, yet in her own house she was as blind as a mole: at home she saw nothing, since as soon as she came back into her own place she took out her eyes from her head – they were removable like spectacles – and hid them away in a wooden clog hanging behind the door of her cottage.’ [At those words Herr Trippa took a branch of tamarisk. ‘Well taken!’ said Epistemon. ‘Nicander calls it divinatory.’] ‘Would you like,’ said Herr Trippa, ‘to know the truth more fully by Pyromancy, Aëromancy [made famous by Aristophanes in his Clouds], by Hydromancy or by Lecanomancy, which was so honoured amongst the Assyrians [and tried out by Ermolao Bárbaro]? Within a basin [full of water] I’ll show you your future wife having it off with a brace of yokels…’ ‘Next time you stick your nose up my bum,’ said Panurge, ‘remember to take off your glasses!’ ‘… or,’ continued Herr Trippa, ‘by Catoptromancy [, by means of which Didius Julianus, an Emperor of Rome, foresaw all that was to come]. You won’t need your glasses! – [In a mirror] you’ll see her being screwed as clearly as if I had showed you her in the fountain of the temple of Minerva near Patras. By Coscinomancy [once so religiously observed within the rituals of the Romans]? Let’s have tongs and a sieve and you will witness some devilry! [By Alphitomancy, as was indicated by Theocritus in his book Pharmaceutria, and by Aleuromancy (mixing together some wheat and some flour)? By Astro-galomancy? I already have some knuckle-bones to throw with. By Tyromancy? I’ve just what we need: a bit of cheese from Bréhémont. By Gyromancy? I shall spin a few hoops and, I assure you, they will all fall to the left! By Sternomancy? I say! Your chest is in poor shape!] By Libanomancy? All you need is a little incense. By Gastromancy, long employed in Ferrara by Dame Jacoba Rhodogina the engastrimyth? By Cephaleomancy [which used to be employed by the Germans who would roast an ass’s head over red-hot charcoal]? By Ceromancy? In this case, from wax melted in water you will see the shapes of your wife and the men giving her a good pounding. By Capnomancy? We shall sprinkle poppy-seeds and sesame-seeds together over some glowing embers. How delightful! By Axinomancy? All you need to provide is a chopper [and a piece of agate which we will place in the brazier. How well Homer exploits it apropos of the Suitors of Penelope]. By Onymancy? We shall need oil and a little wax. By Tephramancy? Ashes exposed to the weather will show you your wife in a fine old state. By Botanomancy? I have some sage-leaves here just for the purpose. By Sycomancy? O! An art divine, using leaves from a fig-tree. By Ichthyomancy [once honoured and practised by Tiresias and Polydamas]: still as reliable as it was long ago in the ditch called Dina within the wood sacred to Apollo in the land of the Lycians? By Choiromancy? We shall need quite a few pigs: you can have the bladders! [By Cleromancy? It’s like our looking for the bean in the festal cake on the Eve of the Epiphany.] By Anthropo-mancy, which was used by the Emperor Heliogabalus of Rome? A bit messy, but since you’re destined to be cuckolded you can put up with that. By Sibylline Stichomancy? By Onomato-mancy? What did you say your name was?…’ ‘Chew-shit,’ said Panurge; ‘… or else by Alectryomancy? I will trace here a nice little circle, which, in your sight, as you watch me, I shall divide into four-and-twenty equal sections in each of which I will draw one letter of the alphabet. Upon each letter I will place one grain of corn. Then I will loose among it a virgin cockerel. You will see it, I promise you, eating the grains placed upon the letters, C. U. C. K. O. L. D. S. H. A. L. T. B. E. just as fatefully as when, under the Emperor Valens (who was perplexed over the name of his successor), the prophetic and alectryomantic cock ate the grains over the letters T.H.E.O.D. Would you be willing to learn from the Art haruspicine? Extispicine?","There is yet another not much better. If there were any Authority now in the Oracles of Jupiter Ammon; of Apollo in Lebadia, Delphos, Delos, Cyrra, Patara, Tegires, Preneste, Lycia, Colophon, or in the Castalian Fountain near Antiochia in Syria; between the Branchidians; of Bacchus in Dodona; of Mercure in Phares near Partras; of Apis in Egypt; of Serapis in Canorie; of Faunus in Menalia and Albunes near Tivoly; of Tiresias in Orchomenie; of Mosus in Silicia; of Orpheus in Lisbos; and of Trophonius in Lucadia. I would in that case advise you, and possibly not, to go thither for their Judgment concerning the Design and Enterprize you have in hand. But you know that they are all of them become as dumb as so many Fishes, since the Advent of that Saviour King, whose coming to this World hath made all Oracles and Prophecies to cease; as the approach of the Suns radiant Beams expelleth Goblins, Bugbears, Hobthrushes, Broams, Schriech Owl-Mates, Nightwalking Spirits, and Tenebrions. These now are gone; but although they were as yet in continuance, and in the same Power, Rule and Request that formerly they were, yet would not I counsel you to be too credulous in putting any Trust in their Responses: Too many Folks have been deceived thereby. It stands furthermore upon Record, how Agrippina did charge the fair Lollia with the Crime of having interrogated the Oracle of Apollo Clarius, to understand if she should be at any time married to the Emperor Claudius; for which Cause she was first banished, and thereafter put to a shameful and ignominious Death. But (saith Panurge) let us do better; the Ogygian Islands are not far distant from the Haven of Sammalo : Let us, after that we shall have spoken to our King, make a Voyage thither. In one of these four Isles, to wit, that which hath its primest Aspect towards the Sun setting, it is reported, (and I have read in good Antick and Authentick Authors) that there reside many Soothsayers, Fortune-tellers, Vaticinators, Prophets, and Diviners of things to come; that Saturn inhabiteth that place, bound with fair Chains of Gold, and within the Concavity of a Golden Rock, being nourished with Divine Ambrosie and Nectar, which are daily in great store and abundance transmitted to him from the Heavens by I do not know well what kind of Fowls (it may be that they are the same Ravens, which in the Deserts are said to have fed St. Paul, the first Hermit) he very clearly foretelleth unto every one, who is desirous to be certified of the condition of his Lot, what his Destiny will be, and what future Chance the Fates have ordained for him: For the Parques, or Weerd Sisters do not twist, spin, or draw out a Thread; nor yet doth Jupiter perpend, project, or deliberate any thing, which the good old Cœlestial Father knoweth not to the full, even whilst he is a sleep: This will be a very summary Abbreviation of our Labour, if we but hearken unto him a little upon the serious debate and canvassing of this my perplexity. That is (answered Epistemon) a Gullery too evident, a plain Abuse and Fib too fabulous. I will not go, not I, I will not go. CHAPTER XXV How Panurge consulteth with Her Trippa. NEVERTHELESS, (quoth Epistemon, continuing his Discourse) I will tell you what you may do, if you will believe me, before we return to our King: Hard by here, in the Brown-wheat-Island, dwelleth Her Trippa ; you know how by the Arts of Astrology, Geomancy, Chiromancy, Metopomancy, and others of a like stuff and nature, he foretelleth all things to come: Let us talk a little, and confer with him about your Business. Of that (answered Panurge) I know nothing: But of this much concerning him I am assured, that one day, and that not long since, whilst he was prating to the Great King, of Cœlestial, Sublime, and Transcendent Things, the Lackqueys and Footboys of the Court, upon the upper Steps of Stairs between two Doors, jumbled, one after another, as often as they listed, his Wife; who is passable fair, and a pretty snug Hussie. Thus he who seemed very clearly to see all Heavenly and Terrestrial Things without Spectacles, who discoursed boldly of Adventures past, with great confidence opened up present Cases and Accidents, and stoutly professed the presaging of all future Events and Contingencies, and was not able with all the Skill and Cunning that he had, to perceive the Bumbasting of his Wife, whom he reputed to be very chast; and hath not till this hour, got Notice of any thing to the contrary. Yet let us go to him, seeing you will have it so: for surely we can never learn too much. They on the very next ensuing Day, came to Her Trippa’s Lodging. Panurge, by way of Donative, presented him with a long Gown lined all thorough with Wolves-skins, with a short Sword mounted with a gilded Hilt, and covered with a Velvet Scabbard, and with fifty good single Angels: then in a familiar and friendly way did he ask of him his Opinion touching the Affair. At the very first Her Trippa looking on him very wistly in the face, said unto him: Thou hast the Metoposcopy, and Physiognomy of a Cuckold; I say, of a notorious and infamous Cuckold. With this casting an eye upon Panurge’s right Hand in all the parts thereof , he said, This rugged Draught which I see here, just under the Mount of Jove, was never yet but in the Hand of a Cuckold. Afterwards, he with a White Lead Pen, swiftly, and hastily drew a certain Number of diverse kinds of Points, which by Rules of Geomancy he coupled and joyned together, then said, Truth it self is not truer, than that it is certain, thou wilt be a Cuckold, a little after thy Marriage. That being done, he asked of Panurge the Horoscope of his Nativity; which was no sooner by Panurge tendred unto him, than that, erecting a Figure, he very promptly and speedily formed and fashion’d a compleat Fabrick of the Houses of Heaven, in all their parts, whereof when he had considered the Situation and the Aspects in their Triplicities, he fetched a deep sigh, and said: I have clearly enough already discovered unto you the Fate of your Cuckoldry, which is unavoidable, you cannot escape it; and here have I got of new a further assurance thereof, so that I may now hardily pronounce, and affirm without any scruple or hesitation at all, that thou wilt be a cuckold; that furthermore, thou wilt be beaten by thine own Wife, and that she will purloyn, filch, and steal of thy Goods from thee ; for I find the Seventh House, in all its Aspects, of a malignant Influence, and every one of the Planets threatning thee with Disgrace, according as they stand seated towards one another, in relation to the Horned Signs of Aries, Taurus, and Capricorn: In the Fourth House I find Jupiter in a Decadence, as also in a Tetragonal Aspect to Saturn, associated with Mercury. Thou wilt be soundly pepper’d, my good honest Fellow, I warrant thee. I will be: (answered Panurge) a Plague rot thee, thou old Fool, and doating Sot, how graceless and unpleasant thou art. When all Cuckolds shall be at a General Rendezvous, thou shouldst be their Standard-bearer. But whence comes this Cironworm betwixt these two Fingers? This Panurge said, putting the Fore-finger of his Left-hand, betwixt the Fore and Mid-finger of the Right, which he thrust out towards Her Trippa, holding them open after the manner of two Horns, and shutting into a Fist his Thumb, with the other Fingers. Then in turning to Epistemon, he said, Lo here the true Ollus of Martial, who addicted and devoted himself wholly to the observing the Miseries, Crosses, and Calamities of others, whilst his own Wife, in the Interim, did keep an open Bawdy-house. This Varlet is poorer than ever was Irus, and yet he is a proud, vaunting, arrogant, self-conceited, overweening, and more insupportable than Seventeen Devils; in one word, Πτωχαλάζων, which term of old was applied to the like beggarly strutting Coxcombs. Come, let us leave this Madpash Bedlam, this hairbrain’d Fop, and give him leave to rave and dose his Belly-full, with his private and intimately acquainted Devils; who, if they were not the very worst of all the infernal Fiends, would never have daigned to serve such a knavish, barking Cur as this is. He hath not learnt the first Precept of Philosophy, which is, Know thy self: For whilst he braggeth and boasteth, that he can discern the least Mote in the Eye of another, he is not able to see the huge Block that puts out the sight of both his Eyes. This is such another Polypragmon, as is by Plutarch described: He is of the Nature of the Lamian Witches, who in forreign Places, in the Houses of Strangers, in Publick, and amongst the Common People, had a sharper and more piercing Inspection into their Affairs than any Lync; but at home, in their own proper Dwelling-Mansions, were blinder than Mold-Warps, and saw nothing at all: for their Custom was at their return from abroad, when they were by themselves in private, to take their Eyes out of their Head, from whence they were as easily removable as a Pair of Spectacles from their Nose, and to lay them up in a wooden Slipper, which for that purpose did hang behind the Door of their Lodging. Panurge had no sooner done speaking, when Her Trippa took into his Hand a Tamarisk Branch. In this (quoth Epistemon) he doth very well, right and like an Artist, for Nicander calleth it the Divinatory Tree. Have you a mind (quoth Her Trippa) to have the truth of the matter yet more fully and amply disclosed unto you by Pyromancy, by Aeromancy, (whereof Aristophanes in his Clouds maketh great estimation) by Hydromancy, by Leconomancy, of old in prime request amongst the Assyrians, and throughly tried by Hermolaus Barbarus: Come hither, and I will shew thee, in this Platter-full of fair Fountain-water, thy future Wife lechering, and sercroupierising it with two swaggering Ruffians, one after another. Yea, but have a special care, (quoth Panurge) when thou comest to put thy Nose within my Arse, that thou forget not to pull off thy Spectacles. Her Trippa going on in his Discourse, said by Catoptromancy, likewise held in such account by the Emperor Didius Julianus, that by means thereof, he ever and anon foresaw all that which at any time did happen or befal unto him: Thou shalt not need to put on thy Spectacles; for in a Mirror thou wilt see her as clearly and manifestly Nebrundiated, and Billibodring-it, as if I should shew it in the Fountain of the Temple of Minerva near Partras. By Coscinomancy, most religiously observed of old, amidst the Ceremonies of the ancient Romans. Let us have a Sieve and Shiers, and thou shalt see Devils. By Alphitomancy, cried up by Theocritus in his Pharmaceutria. By Aleuromancy, mixing the Flower of Wheat with Oatmeal. By Astragalomancy, whereof I have the Plots and Models all at hand ready for the purpose. By Tyromancy, whereof we make some Proof in a great Brehemont Cheese, which I here keep by me. By Giromancy, if thou shouldst turn round Circles, thou mightest assure thy self from me, that they would fall always on the wrong side. By Sternomancy, which maketh nothing for thy Advantage, for thou hast an ill-proportion’d Stomach. By Libanomancy, for the which we shall need but a little Frankincense. By Gastromancy, which kind of ventral Fatiloquency was for a long time together used in Ferrara by Lady Giacoma Rodogina, the Engastrimythian Prophetess. By Cephalomancy, often practised amonst the High-Germans, in their boiling of an Asses Head upon burning Coals. By Ceromancy, where, by the means of Wax dissolved into Water, thou shalt see the Figure, Pourtrait, and lively Representation of thy future Wife, and of her Fredin Fredaliatory Belly thumping Blades. By Capnomancy; O the gallantest and most excellent of all Secrets! By Axionomancy, we want only a Hatchet and a Jeat-stone to be laid together upon a quick Fire of hot Embers. O how bravely Homer was versed in the Practice hereof towards Penelope’s Suitors! By Onymancy, for that we have Oyl and Wax. By Tephromancy, thou wilt see the Ashes thus aloft dispersed, exhibiting thy Wife in a fine Posture. By Botanomancy, for the nonce I have some few Leaves in reserve. By Sicomancy; O Divine Art in Fig-tree Leaves! By Icthiomancy, in ancient times so celebrated, and put in use by Tiresias and Polydamas, with the like certainty of event as was tried of old at the Dina-ditch within that Grove consecrated to Apollo, which is in the Territory of the Lycians. By Choiramancy: Let us have a great many Hogs, and thou shalt have the Bladder of one of them. By Cheromomancy, as the Bean is found in the Cake at the Epiphany Vigil. By Anthropomancy, practised by the Roman Emperor Heliogabalus; it is somewhat irksom, but thou wilt endure it well enough, seeing thou art destinated to be a Cuckold. By a Sibylline Stichomancy. By Onomatomancy: How do they call thee! Chaw, turd; (quoth Panurge). Or yet by Alectryomancy.

"« La bergère, voyant l’âne déloger, dit au palefrenier qu’il était sien et pria qu’il fût bien traité, autrement elle voulait partir sans plus avant entrer. Lors commanda le palefrenier que plutôt les chevaux n’eussent de huit jours avoine que l’âne n’en eût tout son soûl. Le pis fut de le révoquer[22], car les garçons l’avaient beau flatter et l’appeler : « Truunc, truunc, baudet, ça.","“The shepherdess, seeing the donkey dislodged, told the groom that he was hers and prayed that he would be treated well, otherwise she wanted to leave without entering any further. Then commanded the groom that the horses had a week's oats rather than the ass had his fill. The worst was to dismiss him[22], because the boys flattered him and called him: “Truunc, truunc, donkey, that.","‘The shepherdess, on seeing the ass making off, told the groom it was hers and begged him to treat it well, otherwise she would leave at once and go on no further. The groom then commanded that the horses should go without oats for a week rather than the ass not eat its fill. The hardest thing was to summon it back, for the stable-lads vainly called and cajoled it: “Here, donkey; hee-haw donkey.”","The Shepherdess who saw her Ass scour off, told Roger that ’twas her Cattle, and desir’d he might be kindly us’d, or else she would not stir her foot over the Threshold. Friend Roger no sooner knew this, but he order’d him to be fetch’d in, and that my Master’s Horses should rather chop Straw for a Week together, than my Mistress’s Beast should want his Belly full of Corn. The most difficult point was to get him back; for in vain the youngsters complimented and cox’d him to come; I dare not, said the Ass, I am bashful; and the more they strove by fair means to bring him with them the more the stubborn Thing was untoward, and flew out at heels;"

"– Par mes lunettes orientales, dit Panurge, frère Jean, mon ami, tu as raison, car à voir la trogne de ce faux vilain revisit, il est encore plus ignorant et méchant que ces pauvres ignorants ici, qui grappent[30] au moins mal qu’ils peuvent, sans long procès, et qui, en trois petits mots, vendangent le clos sans tant d’interlocutoires ni décrotoires, dont ces chats fourrés en sont bien fâchés. »","– By my oriental glasses, said Panurge, brother Jean, my friend, you are right, because to see the face of this false ugly revisit, he is even more ignorant and wicked than these poor ignoramuses here, who cluster[30] at least evil as they can, without long trial, and which, in three short words, harvest the closed without so many interlocutories or décrotoires, of which these furry cats are very angry. »","This island’s name, Oultre (Over, or Beyond) lends itself to plays on words: passer oultre is ‘to go beyond’, but also to ‘pass over’ in the sense of to die.","Remember you’re upon your Oath, and tell me justly, and bona fide, how many times o’ day you Monk it?"
"Lors demandâmes à maître Æditue, vu la multiplication de ces vénérables oiseaux en toutes leurs espèces, pourquoi là n’était qu’un papegaut. Il nous répondit que telle était l’institution première et fatale destinée des étoiles que des clergaux naissent les prêtregaux et monagaux, sans compagnie charnelle, comme fait entre les abeilles d’un jeune taureau accoutré selon l’art et pratique d’Aristéus. Des prêtregaux naissent les évêgaux, d’iceux les beaux cardingaux, et les cardingaux, si par mort n’étaient prévenus, finissaient en papegaut, et n’en est ordinairement qu’un, comme par les ruches des abeilles n’y a qu’un roi, et au monde n’est qu’un soleil. Icelui décédé, en naît un autre en son lieu de toute la race des cardingaux, entendez toujours sans copulation charnelle. De sorte qu’il y a en cette espèce unité individuale[1], avec perpétuité de succession, ne plus ne moins qu’au phénix d’Arabie. Vrai est qu’il y a environ deux mille sept cent soixante lunes que furent en nature deux papegaux produits ; mais ce fut la plus grande calamité qu’on vit onques en cette île. « Car, disait Æditue, tous ces oiseaux ici se pillèrent les uns les autres et s’entrepelaudèrent[2] si bien ce temps durant que l’île périclita[3] d’être spoliée de ses habitants. Part[4] d’iceux adhérait à un et le soutenait, part à l’autre et le défendait, demeurèrent part d’iceux muets comme poissons et onques ne chantèrent, et part de ces cloches, comme interdite, coup ne sonna. Ce séditieux temps durant, à leur secours évoquèrent[5] empereurs, rois, ducs, monarques, comtes, barons et communautés du monde qui habite en continent et terre ferme, et n’eut fin ce schisme et cette sédition qu’un d’iceux ne fût tollu[6] de vie, et la pluralité réduite en unité. »","Then we asked Master Aeditue, seeing the multiplication of these venerable birds in all their species, why there was only a popegaut. He answered us that such was the first and fatal institution destined for the stars that from the clergy are born the priestgals and monastics, without carnal companionship, as done between the bees of a young bull garbed according to the art and practice of Aristeus. From the priestgaux are born the bishops, from them the beautiful cardinals, and the cardinals, if by death were not prevented, ended in papegaut, and is ordinarily only one of them, as by the hives of bees there is only a king, and in the world is but a sun. With him deceased, another is born in his place of the whole race of cardinals, always hear without carnal copulation. So that there is in this species individual unity[1], with perpetuity of succession, no more no less than with the phoenix of Arabia. It is true that it is approximately two thousand seven hundred and sixty moons that two Popegals were produced in kind; but it was the greatest calamity ever seen on this island. “Because, said Æditue, all these birds here plundered each other and plundered[2] each other so well during this time that the island declined[3] from being despoiled of its inhabitants. Part [4] of them adhered to one and supported it, part to the other and defended it, remained part of them silent as fish and onques did not sing, and part of these bells, as forbidden, no stroke rang. During this seditious time, to their aid evoked [5] emperors, kings, dukes, monarchs, counts, barons and communities of the world which lives on the continent and on the mainland, and this schism and this sedition only ended one of they were not tollu[6] of life, and the plurality reduced to unity. »","Here it also means a pope. There is an allusion to the Great Schism (1378 to 1417) when there were two rival popes. ‘Robert Valbringue’ may be a confused allusion to Roberval, the explorer who governed Canada. Cf. two adages of Erasmus: I, V, XXIX, ‘More mute than a fish’, and ‘III, VII, X, ‘Africa always brings something new’.] We then inquired of the Maître Aedituus why, seeing the increase of those venerable birds in their various species, there was only one Popinjay. He replied that the cause lay in the original foundation and in ineluctable destiny as determined by the stars, by which Priestogoths and Monkogoths were born of Clerigoths without carnal intercourse (as happens to bees which are brought forth from a young bull prepared according to the art and practice of Aristaeus). From the Priestogoths are born the Bishogoths, and from them the splendid Cardingoths; any, unless overtaken by death, could well become Popinjay, of which there is usually but one just as there is but one king-bee in a hive and but one sun in this world. When a Popinjay dies, to replace him another is born from the entire tribe of Cardingoths (again, you realize, without carnal intercourse). Accordingly, within that species there is but one individual in an unbroken succession, no more nor less than the Arabian phoenix. It is true that two Popinjays were delivered into Nature some two thousand seven hundred and sixty moons ago, but that was the greatest disaster ever seen on this island, ‘for,’ said the Aedituus, ‘during that period all the birds despoiled each other and tore the skins off each other, so that the island was put in peril of being robbed of its inhabitants. Part of them adhered to one and supported him: part, to the other, and protected him; part of them stayed as mute as fishes and chanted no more; and some of these bells of ours, as though under an interdict, rang out no more. ‘During that period of sedition they summoned to their aid the emperors, kings, dukes, monarchs, counts, barons and corporations who dwelt upon the terra-firma of our continent. But there was no end to that schism and sedition until plurality was brought back to unity when one of them was plucked from this life.’","WE then ask’d Master Ædituus why there was but one Popehawk, among such numbers of venerable Birds, multiply’d in all their Species? He answer’d, That such was the first Institution and fatal Destiny of the Stars. That the Clerghawks begot the Priesthawks and Monkhawks, without carnal Copulation, as some Bees are born of a young Bull. The Priesthawks beget the Bishhawks, the Bishhawks the stately Cardinhawks, and the stately Cardinhawks, if they live long enough, at last come to be Popehawk. Of this last kind, there never is more than one at a time, as in a Bee hive there is but one King, and in the World is but one Sun. When the Popehawk dies, another arises in his stead out of the whole Brood of Cardinhawks, that is, as you must understand it all along, without carnal Copulation. So that there is in that Species an individual Unity, with a perpetuity of Succession, neither more nor less than in the Arabian Phœnix. ’Tis true, that about Two thousand seven hundred and sixty Moons ago, two Popehawks were seen upon the Face of the Earth; but then you never saw in your lives such a woful Rout and Hurly-burly as was all over this Island. For all these same Birds did so peck, clapper-claw and maul one another all that time, that there was the Devil and all to do, and the Island was in a fair way of being left without Inhabitants. Some stood up for this Popehawk, some for t’ other. Some, struck with a dumness, were as mute as so many Fishes; the Devil a Note was to be got out of them; Part of the merry Bells here were as silent as if they had lost their Tongues, I mean their Clappers. During these troublesome Times, they call’d to their Assistance the Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Earls, Barons, and Commonwealths of the World that live on t’ other side the Water; nor was this Schism and Sedition at an end, till one of them died, and the Plurality was reduc’d to Unity."
"Pantagruel restait tout pensif et mélancolique. Frère Jean l’aperçut, et demandait dont lui venait telle fâcherie non accoutumée, quand le pilote, considérant les voltigements du peneau[8] sur la poupe et prévoyant un tyrannique grain et fortunal[9] nouveau, commanda tous être à l’erte[10], tant nochers, fadrins[11] et mousses que nous autres voyagers, fit mettre voiles bas, méjane, contreméjane, triou, maistrale, épagon, civadière[12], fit caler les boulingues[13], trinquet de prore et trinquet de gabie[14], descendre le grand artimon, et de toutes les antennes ne rester que les griselles et côtières[15].","Pantagruel remained pensive and melancholy. Brother Jean saw him, and asked where he had come from such unaccustomed annoyance, when the pilot, considering the fluttering of the peneau[8] on the stern and anticipating a new tyrannical squall and fortune[9], ordered everyone to be on the erte. [10], so many nochers, fadrins[11] and ship's boys as we travellers, had the sails lowered, méjane, contreméjane, triou, maistrale, épagon, civadière[12], had the boulingues[13] wedged in, trinquet of prore and trinquet de gabie[14], go down the large mizzen, and of all the antennas only the gray and coastal[15] remain.","Pantagruel remained all thoughtful and melancholy. Frère Jean noticed it, and was asking him the origin of such an unaccustomed gloom when the pilot, having studied the way the pennant on the poop was jerking about and foreseeing a severe squall and a new-formed tempest, called out for everybody to be on the alert: officers, matelots, ship’s boys and us passengers. He struck the sails: mizzen-sail, mizzen-topsail, lugsail, mainsail, lower-after-square-sail and spritsail; he had the men furl in the topsails, foretop and maintop and lower the great storm-mizzen, leaving aloft none of the yards save the ratlings and the shrouds.","Pantagruel seem’d metagraboliz’d, dozing, out of sorts, and as melancholick as a Cat; Fryar Jhon who soon perceiv’d it, was enquiring of him whence should come this unusual sadness? When the Master, whose Watch it was, observing the fluttering of the Ancient above the Poop, and seeing that it began to overcast, judg’d that we should have Wind, therefore he bid the Boatswain call hands upon Deck, Officers, Sailers, Fore-Mast Men, Swabbers, and Cabbin-boys, and even the Passengers; made ’em first settle their Topsails, take in their Spreet-sail; then he cry’d, in with your Top-sails, lower the Fore-sail, Tallow under the Parrels, brade up close all them Sails, strike your Top-Masts to the Cap, make all sure with your Sheeps-feet, Lash your Guns fast. All this was nimbly done."
"– Je dis potable, dit Gagnebeaucoup, car l’on en boit céans mainte bouteille que l’on ne boirait pas. Il y en a de tant de plants que l’on n’en sait le nombre.

O’ Sundays they stuff’d their Puddings with Puddings, Chitterlings, Links, Bolonia-Sawcidges, Forc’d-meats, Liverings, Hogs-haslets, young Quails, and Teals; you must also always add Cheese for the first Course, and Mustard for the last.

"Puis l’envoya à l’école pour apprendre et passer son jeune âge. De fait vint à Poitiers pour étudier, et y profita beaucoup. Auquel lieu, voyant que les écoliers étaient aucunes fois de loisir et ne savaient à quoi passer temps, en eut compassion, et un jour prit, d’un grand rocher qu’on nomme Passelourdin, une grosse roche, ayant environ de douze toises en carré et d’épaisseur quatorze pans[1], et la mit sur quatre piliers au milieu d’un champ, bien à son aise, afin que lesdits écoliers, quand ils ne sauraient autre chose faire, passassent temps à monter sur ladite pierre, et là banqueter à force flacons, jambons et pâtés, et écrire leurs noms dessus avec un couteau, et, de présent, l’appelle-t-on la Pierre levée. Et en mémoire de ce, n’est aujourd’hui passé aucun en la matricule de ladite université de Poitiers, sinon qu’il ait bu en la fontaine caballine de Croutelles, passé à Passelourdin, et monté sur la Pierre levée.","Then sent him to school to learn and pass his young age. In fact came to Poitiers to study, and enjoyed it a lot. Whereupon, seeing that the scholars were sometimes at leisure and did not know what to spend their time on, had compassion on them, and one day took, from a large rock called Passelourdin, a large rock, about twelve fathoms in length. square and fourteen sides thick[1], and placed it on four pillars in the middle of a field, quite at his ease, so that the said scholars, when they could do nothing else, pass the time climbing on the said stone, and there banquet by force flasks, hams and pies, and write their names on them with a knife, and, from now on, it is called the Standing Stone. And in memory of this, no one has passed today in the matriculation of the said University of Poitiers, except that he drank in the caballine fountain of Croutelles, passed in Passelourdin, and climbed on the raised stone.","The inner parts of the building above that court were raised up on pillars of chalcedony and porphyry, with beautiful ancient-style arches, within which were beautiful galleries, long and spacious, decorated with wall-paintings as well as with the horns of stags, [unicorns and hippopotamuses, with elephant tusks] and other objects of note.","Then he sent him to the school to learn, and to spend his youth in vertue: in the prosecution of which designe he came first to Poictiers, where, as he studied and profited very much, he saw that the Scholars were oftentimes at leisure, and knew not how to bestow their time, which moved him to take such compassion on them, that one day he took from a long ledge of rocks (called there Passelourdin), a huge great stone, of about twelve fathom square, and fourteen handfuls thick, and with great ease set it upon foure pillars in the midst of a field, to no other end, but that the said Scholars, when they had nothing else to do, might passe their time in getting up on that stone, and feast it with store of gammons, pasties and flaggons, and carve their names upon it with a knife, in token of which deed till this houre the stone is called the lifted stone: and in remembrance hereof there is none entered into the Register and matricular Book of the said University, or accounted capable of taking any degree therein, till he have first drunk in the Caballine fountain of Croustelles, passed at Passelourdin and got up upon the lifted stone."
"Soudain ce propos entendu, Ponocrates courut dire les nouvelles à Gargantua, afin qu’il fût prêt de la réponse et délibérât sur-le-champ ce qu’était de faire. Gargantua, admonesté du cas, appela à part Ponocrates, son précepteur, Philotomie, son maître d’hôtel, Gymnaste, son écuyer, et Eudémon, et sommairement conféra avec eux sur ce qu’était tant à faire qu’à répondre. Tous furent d’avis qu’on les menât au retrait du gobelet[5], et là on les fit boire théologalement, et, afin que ce tousseux n’entrât en vaine gloire pour à sa requête avoir rendu les cloches, l’on mandât, cependant qu’il chopinerait, quérir le prévôt de la ville, le recteur de la Faculté, le vicaire de l’église, esquels, devant que le théologien eût proposé sa commission, l’on délivrerait les cloches. Après ce, iceux présents, l’on ouïrait sa belle harangue. Ce que fut fait, et, les susdits arrivés, le théologien fût en pleine salle introduit et commença ainsi que s’ensuit, en toussant.","Suddenly hearing this remark, Ponocrates ran to tell the news to Gargantua, that he might be ready with the answer, and deliberate at once what to do. Gargantua, admonished at the case, called aside Ponocrates, his tutor, Philotomy, his butler, Gymnast, his squire, and Eudemon, and conferred summarily with them as to what was both to do and to answer. All were of the opinion that they should be taken to the removal of the goblet, and there they were made to drink theologically, and, lest this cougher enter into vainglory for, at his request, having returned the bells, they He ordered, while he was pinching, to fetch the provost of the city, the rector of the Faculty, the vicar of the church, who, before the theologian had proposed his commission, the bells would be delivered. After that, those present, we would hear his beautiful harangue. This was done, and, the aforesaid arrived, the theologian was introduced in full hall and began as follows, coughing.","As soon as he heard that, Ponocrates went straight to Gargantua with the news so that he could be ready with an answer and could instantly discuss with them what should be done. Gargantua, duly warned, took aside Ponocrates, his tutor, Philotime, his major-domo, Gymnaste, his equerry, and Eudemon; he had a quick discussion with them about what to do and what answer to return. It was unanimously agreed that the delegation should be taken off to the buttery and made to drink theologically, but (in order that the old cougher should not fall into vainglory through having the bells returned at his request) they should, while he was downing his drinks, summon the Provost of Paris and the Rector of the Faculty together with the Vicar of the Church, to whom they would hand over the bells before the theologian had propounded his commission. After which, in their presence, they would hear his beautiful address. And so it was done. And once the aforesaid dignitaries had arrived, the theologian was conducted into the packed Hall and began as follows, coughing:","Assoon as Ponocrates heard that, he ran in all haste to carry the newes unto Gargantua, that he might be ready to answer them, and speedily resolve what was to be done. Gargantua being advertised hereof, called apart his Schoolmaster Ponocrates, Philotimus Steward of his house, Gymnastes his Esquire, and Eudemon, and very summarily conferred with them, both of what he should do, and what answer he should give. They were all of opinion that they should bring them unto the goblet-office, which is the Buttery, and there make them drink like Roysters, and line their jackets soundly: and that this cougher might not be puft up with vain-glory, by thinking the bells were restored at his request, they sent (whilest he was chopining and plying the pot) for the Major of the City, the Rector of the facultie, and the Vicar of the Church, unto whom they resolved to deliver the bells, before the Sophister had propounded his commission; after that, in their hearing, he should pronounce his gallant Oration, which was done, and they being come, the Sophister was brought into a full hall, and began as followeth, in coughing."

"– Voire, voire, dit frère Jean, vous en parlez comme saint Jean de la Palisse[20]. » Interrogées sur les causes de cetui pendage, répondirent qu’ils avaient dérobé les ferrements de la messe[21] et les avaient mussés[22] sous le manche de la paroisse[23].","“See, see,” said Brother Jean, “you talk about it like Saint Jean de la Palisse[20].

And the pain was eased.","For he caught one by the legs, another by the scrip, another by the pocket, another by the scarf, another by the band of the breeches, and the poor fellow that had hurt him with the bourdon, him he hooked to him by the Codpiece, which snatch neverthelesse did him a great deal of good, for it pierced unto him a pockie botch he had in the groine, which grievously tormented him ever since they were past Ancenis.

"Rhizotome était accroupi sur le coursoir[17].

Carpalim, playing his reel, asked: ""How much movement is previous in kind, before the person is said to be hungry?"" Eusthenes, hearing the noise, hastened to the deck, and from the capstan exclaimed, asking: ""Why in greater danger of death is the man bitten on an empty stomach by a young snake[21] than after having sated? , both man and snake, why is the saliva of the young man poisonous to all snakes and poisonous animals? »","Rhizotome was squatting on the coursey. He raised his head and gave such a deep yawn that he caused his companions to do likewise from natural sympathy.

And why is the saliva of a fasting man poisonous to all snakes and poison-bearing creatures?’","Rhizotome, who lay stooping on the Pump, rais’d his drowsy Head, and lazily yawning, by natural sympathy, set almost every one in the Ship a yawning too; then ask’d for a Remedy against Oscitations and Gapings? Xenomanes, half puzzled, and tir’d out with new vamping his antiquated Lantern, ask’d, How the Hold of the Stomach might be so well ballasted and freighted from the Keel to the Main-hatch with Stores well stowed, that our human Vessels might not heeld, or be walt, but well trimm’d, and stiff? Carpalim twirling his diminutive Wind-mill, ask’d how many Motions are to be felt in Nature before a Gentleman may be said to be hungry?

It is a very paradoxical [1] and new doctrine, because we say that by spurs one begins to arm oneself.","(See Pantagruel, Chapter 8, Gargantua’s letter to his son.)

For Moses and his fig-leaf Panurge seeks to draw on the authority of Genesis 1. The priapic poem at the end appears in an anthology, Fleurs de la poésie françoyse, of 1534. The works of Justinian and Chiabrena mentioned near the end are fictional. Chiabrena (in French, Shit-turds) sounds like a play on the Italian surname chiabrera.] ‘Do you wish to maintain,’ said Pantagruel, ‘that the codpiece is the primary item of fighting-armour? That is a very novel and paradoxical assertion, for we usually say that donning of armour begins with the spurs.’",WILL you maintain (quoth Pantagruel) that the Codpiece is the chief piece of a Military Harness? It is a new kind of Doctrine very Paradoxical: For we say at Spurs begins the arming of a Man.

Whereas others judged miraculous, or almost miraculous, the speed with which vital news reached (say) Roman bankers, Rabelais opted for unmysterious and unmiraculous explanations based on the ‘gozal’, the homing-pigeon recently reintroduced into Europe from Egypt. Gargantua cites a saying attributed to Hesiod by Erasmus (Adages, I, II, XXXIX, ‘The beginning is half of the whole’).]","CHAPTER III How Pantagruel received a Letter from his Father Gargantua, and of the strange way to have speedy news from far distant places."
"Non pourtant fûmes-nous hors de fâcherie, car aucuns[18] de nos mariniers, par congé de Pantagruel, le temps pendant qu’étions devant Grippeminaud, s’étaient retirés en une hôtellerie, près le havre, pour banqueter et soi quelque peu de temps rafraîchir. Je ne sais s’ils avaient bien ou non payé l’écot : si est-ce qu’une vieille hôtesse, voyant frère Jean en terre, lui faisait grande complainte[19], présent un serrargent[20] gendre d’un des chats fourrés, et deux recors de témoins. Frère Jean, impatient de leurs discours et allégations, demanda : « Gallefretiers, mes amis, voulez-vous dire en somme que nos matelots ne sont gens de bien ? Je maintiens le contraire. Par justice je le vous prouverai : c’est ce maître braquemart ici. » Ce disant, s’escrimait de son braquemart. Les paysans se mirent en fuite au trot. Restait seulement la vieille, laquelle protestait à frère Jean que ses matelots étaient gens de bien ; de ce se complaignait qu’ils n’avaient rien payé du lit, auquel après dîner ils avaient reposé, et pour le lit demandait cinq sols tournois. « Vraiment, répondit frère Jean, c’est bon marché ; ils sont ingrats, et n’en auront toujours à tel prix. Je le paierai volontiers, mais je le voudrais bien voir. » La vieille le mena au logis et lui montra le lit, et l’ayant loué en toutes ses qualités, dit qu’elle ne faisait de l’enchérie[21] si en demandait cinq sols.","No, however, we were out of annoyance, for none[18] of our mariners, by leave of Pantagruel, the time while we were in front of Grippeminaud, had retired to an inn, near the harbour, to have a banquet and to themselves somewhat time to refresh. I don't know if they had paid the cost or not: if an old hostess, seeing Brother Jean in the ground, complained to him[19], present a silver shack[20] son-in-law of one of the furred cats, and two witness records. Brother Jean, impatient with their speeches and allegations, asked: ""Galefretiers, my friends, do you really mean that our sailors are not good people?"" I maintain the opposite. By justice I will prove it to you: it is this Master Braquemart here. Saying this, he struggled with his braquemard. The peasants took to flight at a trot. There only remained the old woman, who protested to Brother Jean that her sailors were good people; of this complained that they had paid nothing for the bed, in which after dinner they had rested, and for the bed demanded five sols tourneys. “Really,” replied Brother Jean, “it is cheap; they are ungrateful, and will never have it at such a price. I would gladly pay for it, but I would like to see it. The old woman took him to the house and showed him the bed, and having praised it in all its qualities, said that she would not bid[21] if she asked five sols for it.","We were not yet free from hassle however, since, while we were before Catty-claws, some of our sailors, with Pantagruel’s leave, had resorted to a hostelry near the harbour to have a carousal and a bit of a rest. I do not know whether they had actually paid their scot, but the old woman who kept the inn saw Frère Jean on shore and uttered a long lament in the presence of a serargeant (a son-in-law of one of the Furry-cats) and two bailiffs as witnesses. Frère Jean had no patience with their speeches and allegations: he asked, ‘My good-for-nothing friends! Do you mean to say, in short, that our matelots are not decent fellows? Well I maintain the contrary and will prove that to you by Justice, to whit, by this my Lord Cutlass.’ So saying, he swished about him with his cutlass, but the peasants fled away at a fair pace. Only the old woman was left; she maintained before Frère Jean that those matelots were decent fellows but had paid nothing for the bed they had rested on after dinner. She charged five Touraine shillings for it. ‘In truth,’ said Frère Jean, ‘that was a bargain. They are ungrateful. They won’t always get a bed at that price. I will readily pay for the bed but I would like to see it first.’ The old woman brought him to the inn and showed him the bed. Having praised all its qualities, she said that she was not overpricing in asking for five shillings.","However, there was somewhat more to do; for some of our Sailors, having got leave of Pantagruel to go o’ shoar, while we were had before Gripe-men-all, had been at a Tavern near the Haven to make much of themselves, and roar it, as Seamen will do when they come into some Port. Now I don’t know whether they had paid their Reck’ning to the full or no; but, however it was, an old fat Hostess meeting Friar Jhon on the Key, was making a woful Complaint, before a Sergeant, Son-in-law to one of the Furr’d Law-Cats, and a Brace of Bums his Assistants. The Friar, who did not much care to be tir’d with their impertinent Prating, said to them, Harkee me, ye lubbardly Gnat-snappers, Do you presume to say, that our Seamen are not honest Men? I’ll maintain they are, ye Dotterels, and will prove it to your brazen Faces, by Justice; I mean this trusty piece of cold Iron by my side; with this, he lugg’d it out, and flourish’d with it. The forlorn Lobcocks soon shew’d him their Backs, betaking themselves to their heels: But the old fusty Landlady kept her ground, swearing, like any Butter-whore, that the Tarpawlins were very honest Cods; but that they had only forgot to pay for the Bed on which they had lay’n after Dinner, and she ask’d Five-pence French Money for the said Bed. May I never sup, said the Friar, if it be not Dog-cheap; they are sorry Guests, and unkind Customers, that they are; they don’t know when they have a Penniworth, and will not always meet with such Bargains; Come, I my self will pay you the Money, but I would willingly see it first. The Hostess immediately took him home with her, and shew’d him the Bed, and having prais’d it for all its good qualifications, said that she thought, as Times went, she was not out of the way, in asking Five-pence for ’t. Friar Jhon then gave her the Five-pence, and she"
"Ainsi croissait Pantagruel de jour en jour et profitait à vue d’œil, dont son père s’éjouissait par affection naturelle, et lui fit faire, comme il était petit, une arbalète pour s’ébattre après les oisillons qu’on appelle de présent la grande arbalète de Chantelle.","Thus Pantagruel grew from day to day and profited visibly, with which his father rejoiced by natural affection, and made him, as he was small, a crossbow to play after the little birds that are now called Chantelle's large crossbow.","The inner parts of the building above that court were raised up on pillars of chalcedony and porphyry, with beautiful ancient-style arches, within which were beautiful galleries, long and spacious, decorated with wall-paintings as well as with the horns of stags, [unicorns and hippopotamuses, with elephant tusks] and other objects of note.","THUS grew Pantagruel from day to day, and to every ones eye waxed more and more in all his dimensions, which made his father to rejoyce by a natural affection: therefore caused he to be made for him, whilest he was yet little, a pretty Crossebowe, wherewith to shoot at small birds, which now they call the great Crossebowe at Chantelle."
"– Jean Chouart, dit Ponocrates, à Montpellier, avait acheté des moines de Saint-Olary unes belles décrétales écrites en beau et grand parchemin de Lamballe, pour en faire des vélins pour battre l’or. Le malheur y fut si étrange que onques pièce n’y fut frappée qui vint à profit. Toutes furent dilacérées et étripées.","– Jean Chouart, known as Ponocrates, in Montpellier, had bought from the monks of Saint-Olary some beautiful decretals written in beautiful and large Lamballe parchment, to make vellums from which to beat gold. The misfortune there was so strange that not one coin was minted there which came to profit. All were torn and gutted.","‘In Montpellier,’ said Ponocrates, John Thomas had bought from the monks of Saint-Olary a lovely Decretals (written on Lamballe parchment, nice and wide) for its vellum to beat out gold-leaf. The extraordinary thing was that not one single piece thus beaten turned out well: all emerged tattered and torn.’","Saith Ponocrates, at Montpelier, John Choüart having bought of the Monks of St. Olary a delicate set of Decretals written on fine large Parchment of Lamballe, to beat Gold between the leaves, not so much as a piece that was beaten in them came to good, but all were dilacerated and spoil’d."
"– Depuis, dis-je, que vous alliez contre les Almyrodes.","“Since,” I said, “you went against the Almyrodes.","Such was the intention of Numa Pompilius, the second king of the Romans, a just man, an urbane ruler and a philosopher, when he ordained that nothing that had died was to be sacrificed to the god Terminus on his festal day (which was called the Terminalia): he was showing them that the termini – the frontiers and the marches of kingdoms – should be guarded and governed in peace, friendship and courtesy, without staining one’s hands with blood or pillage.","Since the time (said I) that you went against the Almirods; That is, about six moneths ago, said he: and wherewith didst thou live?"

Lors appela Panurge et lui montra le cas. À quoi Panurge lui dit que la feuille de papier était écrite, mais c’était par telle subtilité que l’on n’y voyait point d’écriture, et pour le savoir la mit auprès du feu, pour voir si l’écriture était faite avec du sel ammoniac détrempé en eau. Puis la mit dedans l’eau pour savoir si la lettre était écrite du suc de tithymale[1]. Puis la montra à la chandelle, si elle était point écrite du jus d’oignons blancs.","When Pantagruel had read the inscription, he was greatly amazed and, asking the said messenger for the name of her who had sent him, opened the letters and found nothing written in them, but only a gold ring, with a diamond on the table. . Then called Panurge and showed him the case. To which Panurge told him that the sheet of paper was written, but it was by such subtlety that no writing was seen on it, and to find out, put it near the fire, to see if the writing was made with sal ammoniac soaked in water. Then put it in the water to find out if the letter was written with tithymal juice. Then showed it by candlelight, if it was not written white onion juice.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","WHEN Pantagruel had read the superscription, he was much amazed, and therefore demanded of the said messenger the name of her that had sent it: then opened he the letter, and found nothing written in it, nor otherwayes inclosed, but only a gold ring, with a square table-diamond. Wondering at this, he called Panurge to him, and shewed him the case; whereupon Panurge told him, that the leafe of paper was written upon, but with such cunning and artifice, that no man could see the writing at the first sight, therefore to finde it out he set it by the fire, to see if it was made with Sal Armoniack soaked in water; then put he it into the water, to see if the letter was written with the juice of Tithymalle: after that he held it up against the candle, to see if it was written with the juice of white onions."

For the foundation and maintenance[4] of icelle, gave in perpetuity twenty three hundred sixty nine thousand five hundred and fourteen nobles to the rose[5] of land rent, indemnified[6], amortized and solvent by each year at the door of the abbey, and from this, passed them beautiful letters.","For the building and furnishing of the Abbey Gargantua sent twenty-seven hundred thousand, eight hundred and thirty-one golden Agnus-dei in ready coin, and then, each year until all was completed, sixteen hundred and sixty-nine thousand Sun-crowns [and as many golden Pleiades] raised from tolls on the river Dive. For its basic endowment and maintenance he gave, in perpetuity, twenty-three hundred and sixty-nine thousand five hundred and fourteen rose-nobles from ground-rents, free of all liens and depreciations, payable every year at the portal of the Abbey. The deeds, duly executed, were handed over.","FOR the fabrick and furniture of the Abbey, Gargantua caused to be delivered out in ready money seven and twenty hundred thousand, eight hundred and one and thirty of those golden rams of Berrie, which have a sheep stamped on the one side, and a flowred crosse on the other; and for every yeare, until the whole work were compleated, he allotted threescore nine thousand crowns of the Sunne, and as many of the seven starres, to be charged all upon the receipt of the custom.

"Touquedillon raconta le tout à Picrochole, et de plus en plus envenima son courage, lui disant : « Ces rustres ont belle peur. Par Dieu ! Grandgousier se conchie, le pauvre buveur ! Ce n’est son art aller en guerre, mais oui bien vider les flacons. Je suis d’opinion que retenons ces fouaces et l’argent, et au reste nous hâtons de remparer ici et poursuivre notre fortune. Mais pensent-ils bien avoir affaire à une dupe, de vous paître[10] de ces fouaces ? Voilà que c’est. Le bon traitement et la grande familiarité que leur avez par ci devant tenue, vous ont rendu envers eux contemptible[11]. Oignez[12] vilain, il vous poindra[13]. Poignez vilain, il vous oindra.","Touquedillon told the whole thing to Picrochole, and grew more and more embittered, saying to him: ""These rustics are very scared."" By God! Grandgousier sucks, the poor drinker! It is not his art to go to war, but yes to empty the bottles. I am of opinion that let us retain these cakes and the money, and for the rest we hasten to repair here and pursue our fortune. But do they really think they are dealing with a dupe, to feed you [10] with these cakes? This is it. The good treatment and the great familiarity that you have held with them here before have made you contemptible towards them[11]. Anoint[12] naughty, he will point you[13]. Grip naughty, he will anoint you.","Braggart related it all to Picrochole and increasingly poisoned his mind, saying to him: ‘Those bumpkins are in a fine old fright. By God, Grandgousier is shitting himself, the poor old soak. His business is not going to war but emptying wine-pots! My opinion is that we keep both the fouaces and the money and hasten to dig ourselves in so as to pursue our good fortune. Did they really think they were dealing with a twit, feeding you with those fouaces! But there it is: the good treatment and great intimacy that you have maintained with them up till now have made you contemptible to them: Flatter villein, he will batter: Batter villein, he will flatter.’","Touquedillon related all this to Picrochole, and more and more exasperated his courage, saying to him, These clowns are afraid to some purpose: by G— Grangousier conskites himself for feare; the poor drinker he is not skilled in warfare, nor hath he any stomach for it , he knows better how to empty the flaggons, that is his Art. I am of opinion that it is fit we send back the carts and the money; and for the rest, that very speedily we fortifie our selves here, then prosecute our fortune. But what do they think to have to do with a ninnie-whoop, to feed you thus with cakes? You may see what it is; the good usage, and great familiarity which you have had with them heretofore, hath made you contemptible in their eyes. Anoint a villain, he will prick you: prick a villain, and he will anoint you:* Sa, sa, sa, (said Picrochole,) by St. James you have given a true character of them."
"– Par le froc que je porte, dit frère Jean, tu te veux absenter du combat, couillu, et ja[3] ne retourneras sur mon honneur. Ce n’est mie[4] grande perte.

This is no great loss. As well he would only cry, lament, shout and discourage the good soldiers.","‘By my cloth, you old Bollock,’ said Frère Jean, ‘you mean to steer clear of the fight and never come back. He’s no great loss.

"Ce propre jour, comme Dieu le voulut, arriva un vieil, gros, et rouge chicanous. Sonnant à la porte, fut par le portier reconnu à ses gros et gras houseaux, à sa méchante jument, à un sac de toile plein d’informations, attaché à sa ceinture, signamment[20] au gros anneau d’argent qu’il avait on[21] pouce gauche. Le portier lui fut courtois, l’introduit honnêtement, joyeusement sonne la campanelle. Au son d’icelle, Loyre et sa femme se vêtirent de leurs beaux habillements, comparurent en la salle, faisants bonne morgue[22]. Oudart se revêtit de surplis et d’étole. Sortant de son office rencontre chicanous, le mène boire en son office longuement, cependant qu’on chaussait gantelets de tous côtés, et lui dit : « Vous ne pouviez à heure venir plus opportune. Notre maître est en ses bonnes : nous ferons tantôt bonne chère, tout ira par écuelles : nous sommes céans de noces : tenez, buvez, soyez joyeux. »","That very day, as God willed, came an old, fat, and red chicanou. Ringing the doorbell, the doorman was recognized by his big fat coats, his nasty mare, a canvas bag full of information, attached to his belt, signifying[20] the big silver ring he had one[21] left thumb. The doorman was courteous to him, introduced him honestly, joyfully rang the campanelle. At the sound of it, Loyre and his wife dressed in their beautiful clothes, appeared in the room, making good arrogance. Oudart dressed in a surplice and a stole. Coming out of his office, he was met with chicanery, took him to drink for a long time in his office, while gauntlets were being worn on all sides, and said to him: “You could not come at a more opportune time. Our master is in his maids: we will have a good meal now, everything will go by bowls: we are ceans of weddings: hold, drink, be merry. »","‘Now, as God so willed, there arrived that very day an ancient, portly, red-faced Chicanous. As he rang the bell at the gate he was recognized by the gate-keeper by his thick, dirty stockings, his wretched mare, the linen-bag full of summonses attached to his belt, and notably by the big silver signet-ring on his left thumb. The gate-keeper was most courteous; he ushered him in most honourably and then merrily tolled the bell. At the sound of which Loyre and his wife donned their fine vestments and, with a straight face, appeared in Hall. Oudart put on his surplice and his stole. As he came out of his buttery he encountered Chicanous. He brought him back into the buttery for a lengthy drink while people on all sides were pulling on gauntlets; he then said to him: “You could not have come at a better time. Master is in the best of moods: soon we shall have plenty of good cheer. They’ll be ladling it out. We’re in the midst of a wedding. Here. Have a drink and be merry.”","That numerical day, as Chance would have it, came an old fat ruddy Catchpole; having knock’d at the Gate, and then piss’d, as most Men will do, the Porter soon found him out, by his large greasie Spatterdashes, his Jaded hollow flank’d Mare, his Bag full of Writs and Informations dangling at his Girdle, but above all, by the large Silver hoop on his left Thumb. The Porter was civil to him, admitted him in kindly, and rung the Bell briskly. As soon as the Baker and his Wife heard it, they clapp’d on their best Clothes, and made their personal appearance in the Hall, keeping their Gravities like a new made Judge. The Domine put on his Surplice and Stole, and as he came out of his Office, met the Catchpole, had him in there, and made him suck his Face a good while, while the Gantlets were drawing on all hands, and then told him, you are come just in Pudding time, my Lord is in his right Cue; we shall feast like Kings anon, here’s to be swindging doings, we have a Wedding in the House, here, drink and cheer up, pull away."

En Lorraine, Fou est près Tou[4], par bonne discrétion[5]. Tout est fol. Salomon dit que infini est des fols le nombre. À infinité rien ne peut déchoir, rien ne peut être adjoint, comme prouve Aristotèles, et fol enragé serais si, fol étant, fol ne me réputais. C’est ce que pareillement fait le nombre des maniaques et enragés infini. Avicenne dit que de manie infinies sont les espèces. Mais le reste de ses dits et gestes fait pour moi. Il dit à ma femme « Gare moine ». C’est un moineau qu’elle aura en délices, comme avait la Lesbie de Catulle, lequel volera[6] pour mouches et y passera son temps, autant joyeusement que fit onques Domitien le croque-mouche.","""In reverse,"" replied Panurge. Not that I want to impudently exempt myself from the territory of madness: I hold it and am from it, I confess. Everyone is crazy. In Lorraine, Fou is near Tou[4], for good discretion[5]. Everything is crazy. Solomon says that infinite is crazy the number. To infinity nothing can fall, nothing can be added, as Aristoteles proves, and mad enrage would be if, being mad, mad did not reput myself. This is what the infinite number of maniacs and madmen does likewise. Avicenna says that species are infinite. But the rest of his words and gestures do it for me. He says to my wife ""Beware monk"". It is a sparrow that she will delight in, like Lesbia of Catullus, which will fly[6] for flies and spend its time there, as joyfully as ever Domitian the croque-mouche did.","‘On the contrary,’ replied Panurge. ‘Not that I want to exclude myself unwisely from the Land of Folly. I admit that I am one of its subjects: I belong there. All the world is a fool. In Lorraine, by sound judgement, Fou (Fool) is near to Tou (All): all is a fool! ‘Solomon says that the number of fools is infinite. Nothing can be subtracted from infinity: nothing added to it. Aristotle proves that. And I would indeed be a raving fool if, fool that I am , I did not reckon myself a fool. It is that which likewise makes the number of maniacs and raving madmen infinite. Avicenna states that the species of mania are infinite. ‘But the rest of Triboullet’s words and gestures make for me. He says of my wife, ’Ware moine. By moine (monk) he meant a moineau (sparrow) which she will delight in, just as Catullus’ Lesbia delighted in hers; it will flit about after flies, passing its time as happily as did Domitian [the Fly-swatter].","Flat contrary (quoth Panurge) not that I would impudently exempt my self from being a Vassal in the Territory of Folly , I hold of that Jurisdiction, and am subject thereto, I confess it; and why should I not? for the whole World is foolish. In the old Lorrain Language (fou for tou) All and Fool were the same thing. Besides it is avouched by Solomon, that infinite is the number of Fools: From an Infinity nothing can be deducted or abated, nor yet by the Testimony of Aristotle, can any thing thereto be added or subjoyned. Therefore were I a mad Fool, if being a Fool I should not hold my self a Fool. After the same manner of speaking, we may aver the number of the mad and enraged Folks to be infinite. Avicenne maketh no Bones to assert, that the several kinds of Madness are infinite. Though this much of Triboulet’s words tend little to my Advantage, how be it the Prejudice which I sustain thereby be common with me to all other Men, yet the rest of his Talk and Gesture maketh altogether for me. He said to my Wife, Be wary of the Monky; that is as much, as if she should be chery, and take as much delight in a Monky as ever did the Lesbia of Catullus in her Sparrow; who will for his Recreation pass his time no less joyfully at the exercise of snatching Flies, than heretofore did the merciless Flycatcher Domitian."
"Des faits et dits héroïques du bon Pantagruel, composé par M. François Rabelais, docteur en médecine.","Of the heroic facts and sayings of the good Pantagruel, composed by Mr. François Rabelais, doctor of medicine.","Pantagruel’s plant pantagruelion provides the material for hangmen’s ropes as well as for tablecloths, bed-linen, the ‘bundles’ (sacks) for lawyers and so on. In this chapter Rabelais invites a comparison with Lucian’s True History. It ends (under the influence of Calcagnini probably) with the air of mythology. Pliny is a pessimist for whom one of the uses of hemp-and-flax is especially regrettable: the making of sails for sailing-ships. Not so for Rabelais. These chapters are full of smiles and optimism, foreseeing a time when another plant will be discovered which will take men to the Moon, shake the gods of Lucian in their heavens and find men seating at table with them and marrying their goddesses, the only two ways to immortality mentioned by Servius in his commentary on Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue, explaining the line cited in Chapter 12. Rabelais cites for the second time an adage of Erasmus, III, X, XCIII, ‘The Arrogance of the Giants’.","This Pantagruelion is to be sown at the first coming of the Swallows, and is to be plucked out of the Ground when the Grashoppers begin to be a little hoarse."
25. Comment Pantagruel raisonne sur là discession[1] des âmes héroïques et des prodiges horrifiques qui précédèrent le trépas du feu seigneur de Langey,25. How Pantagruel reasons on the discession[1] of the heroic souls and the horrific prodigies which preceded the death of the late Lord of Langey,"CHAPTER 27 [For the second paragraph of this chapter Rabelais again turns to an adage of Erasmus, I, V, LVI, ‘Theta praefigere’ (‘To set up a theta’); however a capital alpha (A) was printed in error for the capital delta (Δ) given by Erasmus. That misprint is corrected here. Another echo of the Adages is of I, II, XXVI, ‘The catastrophe of a drama’. (‘Catastrophe’ in this sense is the third part of a drama ‘in which things suddenly change’.) Rabelais, developing what he wrote in Chapter 21 of the Third Book, gives us here the only account we have of the death of Guillaume Du Bellay, the Seigneur de Langey, to whom he was a physician. As we were told in the Third Book, Guillaume Du Bellay died at Mont Tarare near Lyons on his way back from Italy. Named persons, lords and physicians are mentioned as present at his death. In scholastic philosophy a good or evil spirit may work something against Nature; a true miracle, something against the whole order of Nature, appertains to God alone. When Rabelais was writing these pages he was, again as physician, part of the household of Cardinal Jean Du Bellay, the brother of his hero. We can assume that Rabelais read the Fourth Book privately to him before it was published. The cardinal then heard how his brother’s death enabled Rabelais to unveil the true and deeper meaning of the pages of Plutarch he is transposing. Beneath the veil of Plutarch lie intimations of immortality.]",CHAPTER XXVII Pantagruel’s Discourse of the Decease of Heroic Souls; and of the dreadful Prodigies that happen’d before the Death of the late Lord de Langey.

"Or notez, buveurs, que durant la messe sèche d’Homenas trois manilliers[1] de l’église, chacun tenant un grand bassin, se pourmenaient parmi le peuple, disants à haute voix : « N’oubliez les gens heureux qui l’ont vu en face. » Sortants du temple, ils apportèrent à Homenas leurs bassins tous pleins de monnaie papimanique. Homenas nous dit que c’était pour faire bonne chère, et que de cette contribution et taillon[2], l’une partie serait employée à bien boire, l’autre à bien manger, suivant une mirifique glose cachée en un certain coingnet[3] de leurs saintes décrétales. Ce que fut fait, et en beau cabaret assez retirant[4] à celui de Guillot, en Amiens. Croyez que la repaissaille[5] fut copieuse et les buvettes numéreuses.[6] En cetui dîner je notai deux choses mémorables : l’une que viande ne fut apportée quelle que fût, fussent chevreaux, fussent chapons, fussent cochons (desquels y a foison en Papimanie), fussent pigeons, connils[7] , levrauts, coqs d’Inde ou autres, en laquelle n’y eut abondance de farce magistrale ; l’autre, que tout le sert[8] et dessert fut porté par les filles pucelles mariables du lieu, belles je vous affie[9], saffrettes[10], blondettes, doucettes et de bonne grâce, lesquelles vêtues de longues, blanches et déliées aubes à doubles ceintures, le chef ouvert[11], les cheveux instrophiés[12] de petites bandelettes et rubans de soie violette, semés de roses, œillets, marjolaines, aneth[13], aurande[14] et autres fleurs odorantes, à chacune cadence nous invitaient à boire avec doctes et mignonnes révérences, et étaient volontiers vues de toute l’assistance. Frère Jean les regardait de côté, comme un chien qui emporte un plumail. Au dessert du premier mets fut par elles mélodieusement chanté un épode à la louange des sacro-saintes décrétales.","Now note, drinkers, that during the dry mass of Homenas three manilliers [1] of the church, each holding a large basin, walked among the people, saying aloud: ""Don't forget the happy people who saw in front. Leaving the temple, they brought to Homenas their basins, all full of Papimanic coins. Homenas tells us that it was for good cheer, and that of this contribution and taillon[2], one part would be used to drink well, the other to eat well, according to a marvelous gloss hidden in a certain quince[ 3] of their holy decretals. What was done, and in a beautiful cabaret rather withdrawn[4] at that of Guillot, in Amiens. Believe that the meal[5] was plentiful and the refreshments plentiful.[6] In this dinner I noted two memorable things: one that meat was not brought whatever was, were goats, were capons, were pigs (of which there are plenty in Papimania), were pigeons, connils [7] , levrauts, roosters of India or others, in which there was no abundance of masterful farce; the other, that all the desserts[8] and desserts were carried by the marriageable maidens of the place, beautiful I affie[9] you, saffrettes[10], blondettes, soft and with good grace, who dressed in long, white and slender albs with double belts, the head open[11], the hair trimmed[12] with small strips and ribbons of violet silk, strewn with roses, carnations, marjoram, dill[13], aurande[14] and other fragrant flowers , at each rate invited us to drink with learned and cute bows, and were gladly seen by all the assistance. Brother Jean looked at them sideways, like a dog carrying off a pen. Over the dessert of the first course, they melodiously sung an epode in praise of the sacrosanct decretals.","But Clerice! can mean both ‘O male clerk!’ and ‘O female clerks!’ The ambiguity may be at least once intentional but is not reproduced here. There is again a deliberate ambiguity over ‘farce’, both a comic play and force-meat stuffing.] Take note of this, you Drinkers: during Homenaz’s dry Mass, three churchwardens went round the congregation each holding a large bason in his hand and crying aloud: ‘Forget not the blessèd folk who have seen His face.’ When they left the chapel they brought Homenaz their basons, each full of papimaniacal coins. Homenaz informed us that it was to provide good cheer, and that one slice of this free-will offertory would be devoted to good drinking and the others to good eating, in accordance with a miracle-working gloss hidden away in a nook of their holy Decretals. That took place in a delightful inn somewhat resembling Guillot’s place in Amiens. The fodder, believe me, was ample and the rounds of drinks copious. I observed two memorable features during that dinner: one was that no viands were served – capons, kids or indeed porkers (of which there are plenty in Papimania) or pigeons, rabbits, hares, turkeys or other flesh – in which there was not an abundance of magisterial farce. The other, that all the dinner and the dessert was served by the local marriageable maidens, beautiful little things (I assure you), buxom little things, blonde little things, sweet little things, all very graceful. They were clad in long, loose, snowy albs and were girdled twice about their middles; their heads were uncovered; their hair crowned with little headbands and ribbons of violet silk strewn with roses, carnations, marjoram, dill-flowers, lemon-balm and other scented blooms; every so often they proffered us wine to drink with studied, engaging curtsies. Everyone there found them delightful to look at: Frère Jean watched them out of the corner of his eye like a dog making off with a morsel of goose-wing. As dinner was being cleared away there was melodiously chanted by them an epode in praise of the most-holy Decretals.","NOW Topers, pray observe that while Homenas was saying his dry Mass, three Collectors, or Licens’d Beggers of the Church, each of them with a large Basin went round among the People, saying with a loud Voice; Pray remember the blessed Men who have seen his Face. As we came out of the Temple they brought their Basins brim full of Papimany Chink to Homenas, who told us, that it was plentifully to Feast with; and that, of this Contribution and voluntary Tax, one part should be laid out in good Drinking, another in good Eating, and the remainder in both; according to an admirable Exposition hidden in a Corner of their Holy Decretals; which was perform’d to a T, and that at a noted Tavern not much unlike that of Will’s at Amiens. Believe me we tickled it off there with copious Cramming, and numerous Swilling. I made two notable Observations at that Dinner; the one that there was not one Dish serv’d up, whether of Cabrittas, Capons, Hogs (of which latter there’s great Plenty in Papimany) Pigeons, Coneys, Leverets, Turkeys or others, without abundance of Magistral Stuff, the other, that every Course and the Fruit also were serv’d up by unmarried Females of the Place, tight Lasses, I’ll assure you, Waggish, Fair, Good-condition’d and Comely, Spruce, and fit for Business. They were clad all in fine long white Albes with two Girts, their Hair interwoven with narrow Tape, and purple Ribbond, stuck with Roses, Gilly-flowers, Marjoram, Daffidowndillies, Thyme and other sweet Flowers. At every Cadence, they invited us to drink and bang it about, dropping us neat and gentile Court’sies: Nor was the sight of them unwelcome to all the Company; and as for Fryar Jhon, he leer’d on them sideways, like a Cur that steals a Capon. When the first course was taken off, the Females melodiously sung us an Epode in Praise of the Sacrosanct Decretals; and then the second Course being serv’d up Homenas joyful and cheery, said to one of the she Buttlers, Light here, Claricia."
"– Que diable, dit Panurge, veut prétendre ce maître Aliboron ? il m’a presque poché les œils au beurre noir. Par Dieu, da jurandi, je vous festoierai d’un banquet de nasardes, entrelardé de doubles chiquenaudes. » Puis le laissa, lui faisant la pétarade. Le muet, voyant Panurge démarcher[27], gagna le devant, l’arrêta par force, et lui fit tel signe : il baissa le bras dextre vers le genou, tant que pouvait l’étendre, clouant tous les doigts en poing, et passant le pouce entre les doigts maître et indice[28]. Puis, avec la main gauche, frottait le dessus du coude du susdit bras dextre, et peu à peu à ce frottement levait en l’air la main d’icelui, jusques au coude et au-dessus ; soudain la rabaissait comme devant : puis à intervalles la relevait, la rabaissait et la montrait à Panurge.","“What the devil,” said Panurge, “does this master Aliboron claim? he almost blacked out my eyes. By God, da jurandi, I will feast you with a banquet of nasardes, streaked with double flicks. Then left him, backfiring him. The mute, seeing Panurge approach[27], reached the front, stopped him by force, and made him such a sign: he lowered his dexter arm towards the knee, as long as he could extend it, nailing all the fingers into a fist, and passing the thumb between the master and index fingers[28]. Then, with the left hand, rubbed the top of the elbow of the aforesaid dexter arm, and little by little at this friction raised in the air the hand of it, up to the elbow and above; suddenly lowered her as before: then at intervals raised her, lowered her and showed her to Panurge.","‘What the devil does this know-it-all think he’s doing?’ said Panurge. ‘ He’s all but given me an eye poached in black butter! By God – allow me to swear! – I’ll treat you to a banquet of bonks on the nose interlarded with double flicks on the smeller.’ Then he went off, aiming at him a volley of farts. The mute, seeing Panurge marching off, got in front of him, forced him to stop and made him the following sign: he lowered his right arm towards his knee as far as he could stretch it, squeezing all his fingers into a fist and thrusting the thumb between the middle and index fingers; with his left hand he then stroked the upper side of his right elbow and gradually, as he stroked, raised that hand into the air as far as the elbow and beyond, then suddenly brought it down to where it had been. Then he raised and lowered it at intervals and showed it to Panurge.","What the Devil (quoth Panurge) means this busie restless Fellow? What is it that this Polypragmonetick Ardeloine to all the Fiends of Hell doth aim at? he hath almost thrust out mine Eyes, as if he had been to potch them in a Skillet with Butter and Eggs, by God, da Jurandi, I will feast you with flirts and raps on the Snout, interlarded with a double row of bobs and finger filipings? Then did he leave him in giving him by way of Salve a Volley of Farts for his Farewel. Goatsnose perceiving Panurge thus to slip away from him, got before him, and by meer strength enforcing him to stand, made this sign unto him. He let fall his right Arm towards his Knee on the same side as low as he could, and raising all the fingers of that Hand into a close fist past his dexterer Thumb betwixt the foremost and mid-fingers thereto belonging. Then scrubbing and swindging a little with his left Hand alongst, and upon the uppermost in the very bought of the Elbow of the said dexter Arm, the whole Cubit thereof by leisure fair, and softly, at these thumpatory warnings, did raise and elevate it self even to the Elbow, and above it, on a suddain did he then let it fall down as low as before: and after that, at certain intervals and such spaces of time, raising and abasing it, he made a shew thereof to Panurge."
"Adonc ouvrant Panurge le livre, rencontra on[1] rang seizième ce vers :","So opening Panurge the book, he encountered on [1] row sixteenth this verse:","It constitutes one of the principal guides to the structure and meaning of this Third Book. Once Roman Law had duly allowed a recourse to lots, that was the end of the matter: there was no appeal, Fortuna having no superior to whom an appeal can be made. Rabelais refers to the relevant Roman laws with the standard abbreviations of his time (in this case simply as L. ult. C. de leg. and L. Ait praetor, § ult. de minor. Such abbreviations, once absolutely standard, are expanded here to make them pronounceable. There is echo of an adage of Erasmus: Adages, I, V, XXXIX, ‘Not even Hercules against two’.] Whereupon Panurge, on opening the book, fell upon these words in the sixteenth line of the verse:","THEN at the opening of the Book in the Sixteenth Row of the Lines of the disclosed Page, did Panurge encounter upon this following Verse:"
"– Aussi font-ils, dit Gagnebeaucoup, car souvent ils mettent au pressoir des châteaux, des parcs, des forêts, et de tout en tirent l’or potable.","“And so they do,” said Gagnebeaucoup, “because often they put castles, parks, forests, and everything else in the press, to draw drinkable gold from them.","He then said to Pantagruel that beds were much cheaper here than in the Chinonais, despite our having the celebrated Pautille geese, since that old woman had merely asked five dozen pence for a bed which in the Chinonais would fetch a dozen francs at least.12","Then the more ’tis to be fear’d, said Pantagruel; for Subtilty suspected, Subtilty foreseen, Subtilty found out, loses the Essence and very Name of Subtilty, and only gains that of Blockishness. They are not such Fools as you take them to be, they have more Tricks than are good, I doubt. After the Procession, they went sluggingly into the Fratry-Room by the way of walk and healthful Exercise, and there kneel’d under the Tables, leaning their Breasts on Lanterns."
"« Mais vous ne répondez point à la question de ce benoît vénérable frère Jean, quand il a demandé : « Manière de hausser le temps ? »","“But you are not answering the question of this venerable Benedict Brother Jean, when he asked: “How to increase the time? »","‘But you are not answering the question of our blessèd and venerable Frère Jean, who asked us, How to raise good weather.’","But methinks, Sir, you did not give an Answer to Fryar Jhon’s Question; which, as I take it, was, how to raise good Weather?"
"Ainsi allâmes, commençant à Saint-Gervais, et je gagne les pardons au premier tronc seulement, car je me contente de peu en ces matières ; puis disais mes menus suffrages et oraisons de sainte Brigitte. Mais il gagna à tous les troncs, et toujours baillait argent à chacun des pardonnaires. De là nous transportâmes à Notre-Dame, à Saint-Jean, à Saint-Antoine, et ainsi des autres églises où était banque de pardons. De ma part, je n’en gagnais plus ; mais lui, à tous les troncs il baisait les reliques et à chacun donnait. Bref, quand nous fûmes de retour, il me mena boire au cabaret du Château et me montra dix ou douze de ses bougettes[6] pleines d’argent. À quoi je me signai, faisant la croix et disant : « Dont[7] avez-vous tant recouvert[8] d’argent en si peu de temps ? » À quoi il me répondit qu’il avait pris ès bassins des pardons : « Car, en leur baillant le premier denier, dit-il, je le mis si souplement qu’il sembla que fut un grand blanc ; ainsi d’une main je pris douze deniers, voire bien douze liards ou doubles pour le moins, et de l’autre, trois ou quatre douzáins[9], et ainsi par toutes les églises où nous avons été.","So we went, beginning at Saint-Gervais, and I won the pardons for the first trunk only, for I contented myself with little in these matters; then said my petty suffrages and prayers for Saint Bridget. But he won at all the trunks, and always gave money to each of the pardoners. From there we were transported to Notre-Dame, Saint-Jean, Saint-Antoine, and so on to the other churches where there was a bank of pardons. For my part, I no longer gained any; but he, at all the trunks, he kissed the relics and to each one gave. In short, when we got back, he took me to drink at the Cabaret du Château and showed me ten or twelve of his buggies [6] full of money. At which I crossed myself, making the cross and saying: ""Which[7] have you covered[8] with so much money in such a short time? To which he replied that he had taken pardons in the basins: “For, in giving them the first denarius,” he said, “I put it so loosely that it looked like a big white man; so with one hand I took twelve deniers, or even twelve farthings or doubles at the very least, and with the other, three or four dozáins[9], and so by all the churches where we have been.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","So we went along, beginning at St. Gervase, and I got the pardons at the first boxe only, for in those matters very little contenteth me: then did I say my small suffrages, and the prayers of St. Brigid, but he gained them at all the boxes, and alwayes gave money to every one of the Pardoners; from thence we went to our Ladies Church, to St. Johns, to St. Antonies, and so to the other Churches, where there was a banquet of pardons. For my part, I gained no more of them: but he at all the boxes kissed the relicks, and gave at every one: to be brief, when we were returned, he brought me to drink at the Castle-tavern, and there shewed me ten or twelve of his little bags full of money, at which I blest my self, and made the signe of the Crosse, saying, Where have you recovered so much money in so little time? unto which he answered me, that he had taken it out of the basins of the pardons; For in giving them the first farthing (said he) I put it in with such slight of hand, and so dexterously, that it appeared to be a three-pence; thus with one hand I took three-pence, nine-pence, or six-pence at the least, and with the other as much, and so thorough all the Churches where we have been."
"Et, ce disant, pleurait comme une vache, mais tout soudain riait comme un veau, quand Pantagruel lui venait en mémoire. « Ho ! mon petit fils, disait-il, mon couillon, mon peton, que tu es joli ! et tant je suis tenu à Dieu de ce qu’il m’a donné un si beau fils, tant joyeux, tant riant, tant joli. Ho, ho, ho, ho ! que je suis aise ! buvons. Ho ! laissons toute mélancolie ; apporte du meilleur, rince les verres, boute[6] la nappe, chasse ces chiens, souffle ce feu, allume la chandelle, ferme cette porte, taille ces soupes, envoie ces pauvres, baille-leur ce qu’ils demandent, tiens ma robe que je me mette en pourpoint pour mieux festoyer les commères. »","And, saying this, wept like a cow, but suddenly laughed like a calf, when Pantagruel came to her mind. “Ho! my grandson, he would say, my asshole, my peton, how pretty you are! and so much am I bound to God for having given me such a beautiful son, so joyful, so laughing, so handsome. Ho, ho, ho, ho! how comfortable I am! let's drink. Oh! let us leave all melancholy; bring the best, rinse the glasses, boil the tablecloth, drive away those dogs, blow out that fire, light the candle, close that door, trim those soups, send those poor people, give them what they ask for, hold my dress that I put on a doublet the better to feast the gossips. »","Happily teach all our days Delight, honour, praise. Come ye inside, and welcome now abide, And doubly so of chivalry the flower. Bring riches too: they are not things to hide Revenues, wealth, shall have their use inside, For Great and Small shall find them their Endower; Thousands with me shall enter friendship’s bower, All merry friends, with joy beyond compare: Wholly and ever true companions fair. Companions fair, Serene and sans care: Banished vulgarity: Welcomed civility","With these words he did cry like a Cow, but on a sudden fell a laughing like a Calfe, when Pantagruel came into his minde: Ha, my little sonne, (said he) my childilollie, fedlifondie, dandlichuckie, my ballockie, my pretty rogue; O how jollie thou art, and how much am I bound to my gracious God, that hath been pleased to bestow on me a sonne, so faire, so spriteful, so lively, so smiling, so pleasant, and so gentle. Ho, ho, ho, ho, how glad I am? Let us drink, ho, and put away melancholy: bring of the best; rense the glasses, lay the cloth, drive out these dogs, blow this fire, light candles, shut that door there, cut this bread in sippets for brewis, send away these poore folks in giving them what they ask, hold my gown, I will strip my self into my doublet, (én cuerpo) to make the Gossips merry, and keep them company."

Set fire to this basilisk [16] that you see near the castle. It will be to salute the muses of this Mount Antiparnasse. As well, the powder spoils in it.","‘Listen, then,’ said Frère Jean. ‘While the crews are taking on water, Panurge is lying down below like a wolf in its straw. Would you like to have a good laugh?

"Peu de temps après, elle commença à soupirer, lamenter et crier. Soudain vinrent à tas sages-femmes de tous côtés, et, la tâtant par le bas, trouvèrent quelques pellauderies[7] assez de mauvais goût, et pensaient que ce fut l’enfant ; mais c’était le fondement qui lui escappait, à la mollification[8] du droit intestin, lequel vous appelez le boyau culier, par trop avoir mangé des tripes, comme nous avons déclaré ci-dessus.","Soon after, she began to sigh, lament, and scream. Suddenly came to your midwives from all sides, and, feeling her from below, found some pellaudery [7] rather in bad taste, and thought it was the child; but it was the foundation which escaped him, to the softening[8] of the right intestine, which you call the particular bowel, from having eaten too much of the guts, as we have declared above.","Shortly afterwards she started to [sigh], groan and cry out. At once, from all directions, there came piles of midwives who, groping about her bottom, came across some bits of membrane in rather bad taste and thought it was the baby, but it was her fundament which had loosened because of the mollification of the rectum intestinum – which you call the arse-gut – resulting from her eating that excess of tripe which we spoke about above.","I will yet go drink one whiffe more, and if in the meane time any thing befall you that may require my presence, I will be so near to you, that, at the first whistling in your fist, I shall be with you forthwith: a little while after she began to groane, lament and cry, then suddenly came the midwives from all quarters, who groping her below, found some peloderies, which was a certaine filthy stuffe, and of a taste truly bad enough; this they thought had been the childe, but it was her fundament , that was slipt out with the mollification of her streight intrall, which you call the bum-gut, and that meerly by eating of too many tripes, as we have shewed you before: whereupon an old ugly trot in the company, who had the repute of an expert she-Physician, and was come from Brispaille near to Saint Gnou three-score years before, made her so horrible a restrictive and binding medicine, and whereby all her Larris, arse-pipes and conduits were so opilated, stopped, obstructed, and contracted, that you could hardily have opened and enlarged them with your teeth, which is a terrible thing to think upon; seeing the Devill at the Masse at Saint Martins was puzled with the like task, when with his teeth he had lengthened out the parchment whereon he wrote the tittle tattle of two young mangy whoores; by this inconvenient the cotyledons of her matrix were presently loosed, through which the childe sprung up and leapt, and so entering into the hollow veine, did climbe by the diaphragm even above her shoulders, where that veine divides it self into two, and from thence taking his way towards the left side, issued forth at her left eare; as soone as he was borne, he cried not as other babes use to do, miez, miez, miez, miez, but with a high, sturdy, and big voice shouted aloud, Some drink, some drink, some drink, as inviting all the world to drink with him; the noise hereof was so extreamly great, that it was heard in both the Countreys at once, of Beauce and Bibarois."

I swear to you, by the prickling brambly Thorn of St. Fiacre in Brie, that our unique Morosoph whom I formerly termed the Lunatick Triboulet, referreth me, for attaining to the final Resolution of my Scruple, to the Response-giving Bottle: Therefore do I renew afresh the first Vow which I made, and here in your Presence protest and make Oath by Styx and Acheron, to carry still Spectacles in my Cap, and never to wear a Codpiece in my Breeches, until upon the Enterprize in hand of my Nuptial Undertaking, I shall have obtained an Answer from the Holy Bottle. I am acquainted with a prudent, understanding, and discreet Gentleman, and besides a very good Friend of mine, who knoweth the Land, Country, and Place where its Temple and Oracle is built and posited: He will guide and conduct us thither sure and safely.

14. Excuse de Panurge et exposition de cabale monastique en matière de bœuf salé,14. Panurge's Excuse and Exposition of Monastic Cabala in Corned Beef,"What was up? Well, he had heard his menservants cry Fire; his maidservants cry Stop thief; his children cry Murder. At which he must needs abandon his meal and rush out to put things right and re-establish order. ‘In truth I recall that the Cabbalists and the Massoretes (expositors of Holy Writ) when teaching by what distinctions one can judge the truth of any appearances by angels (for the angel of Satan often transfigures himself into an angel of light) say that the distinction is that, whenever the good angel of consolation appears to man, he frightens him at first but finally consoles him, whereas the evil angel of temptation delights him at first but finally leaves him perturbed, anxious and perplexed.’ The Excuse of Panurge; and an exegesis of a monastical cabbala concerning salted beef CHAPTER 15 [There is a sustained play on to hear and to understand (both entendre in French.) Cabbalistic knowledge is semi – secret knowledge, handed down from person to person amongst initiates.","what? he heard his Male Servants cry, Fire, fire, fire, fire; his Serving Maids and Woman yell, Stop Thief, stop Thief; and all his Children shout as loud as ever they could, Murther, O Murther, Murther. Then was it not high time for him to leave his Banqueting, for application of a Remedy in hast, and to give speedy Order for succouring of his distressed Houshold. Truly, I remember, that the Cabalists and Massorats, Interpreters of the Sacred Scriptures, in treating how with verity one might judge of Evangelical Apparitions (because oftentimes the Angel of Satan is disguized and transfigured into an Angel of Light) said, That the difference of these two mainly did consist in this: the favourable and comforting Angel useth in his appearing unto Man at first to terrifie and hugely affright him; but in the end he bringeth Consolation, leaveth the Person who hath seen him, joyful, well-pleased, fully content, and satisfied: on the other side, the Angel of Perdition, that wicked, devilish, and malignant Spirit, at his appearance unto any Person, in the beginning cheareth up the Heart of his Beholder, but at last forsakes him, and leaves him troubled, angry, and perplexed.

En mon arsenal de Thalasse prenez équipage tel que voudrez : tels pilotes, nochers[39], truchements[40] que voudrez, et, à vent opportun faites voile, au nom et protection du Dieu servateur[41]. Pendant votre absence je ferai les apprêts et d’une femme vôtre, et d’un festin, que je veux à vos noces faire célèbre si onques en fut. »","""Of my treasures made to your full arbiter."" Anything you do will not please me. In my arsenal of Thalasse take crew as you wish: such pilots, drivers[39], intermediaries[40] as you wish, and, in the opportune wind, set sail, in the name and protection of the servant God[41]. During your absence I will make preparations both for a wife of yours, and for a feast, which I want to make famous at your wedding if ever there is one. »","Make use of my wealth at your complete discretion: whatever you do can only delight me. From my arsenal at Thalassa fit out as many of my ships as you will, with such pilots, seamen and interpreters as you will, and when the wind is right, spread your sails in the name of God our Servator and under His protection. While you are away I shall be busy arranging a wife for you, and festivities for your marriage, which shall be glorious if ever there were any.’ How Pantagruel prepared to put to sea, and of the plant called pantagruelion","shall seem most expedient: None of your Actions, I promise you, can in any manner of way displease me. Take out of my Arcenal Thalasse, whatsoever Equipage, Furniture or Provision you please, together with such Pilots, Mariners and Truchmen, as you have a mind to; and with the first fair and favourable Wind set sail and make out to Sea in the Name of God our Saviour. In the mean while, during your Absence, I shall not be neglective of providing a Wife for you, nor of those Preparations, which are requisite to be made for the more sumptuous solemnizing of your Nuptials with a most splendid Feast, if ever there was any in the World, since the days of Assuerus."
"Épistémon, frère Jean et Panurge, voyants cette fâcheuse catastrophe[1], commencèrent au couvert de leurs serviettes crier : « Myault, myault, myault », feignants cependant de s’essuyer les œils, comme s’ils eussent pleuré. Les filles furent bien apprises, et à tous présentèrent pleins hanaps de vin clémentin, avec abondance de confitures. Ainsi fut de nouveau le banquet réjoui. En fin de table Homenas nous donna un grand nombre de grosses et belles poires, disant : « Tenez, amis, poires sont singulières, lesquelles ailleurs ne trouverez. Non toute terre porte tout. Indie seule porte le noir ébène. En Sabée provient[2] le bon encens, en l’île de Lemnos la terre sphragitide[3]. En cette île seule naissent ces belles poires. Faites-en, si bon vous semble, pépinières en vos pays.","Épistemon, Brother Jean and Panurge, seeing this unfortunate catastrophe[1], covered with their towels, began to shout: “Myault, myault, myault”, pretending however to wipe their eyes, as if they were crying. The girls were well acquainted, and they all presented full hanaps of clementine wine, with plenty of jams. So was the banquet rejoiced again. At the end of the table Homenas gave us a large number of large and beautiful pears, saying: ""Here, friends, pears are singular, which elsewhere you will not find."" Not all land carries everything. Indie alone wears ebony black. In Sabea comes[2] the good incense, in the island of Lemnos the sphragitis earth[3]. In this island alone are born these beautiful pears. Make them, if you wish, nurseries in your countries.","Upon seeing this wretched catastrophe, Epistemon, Frère Jean and Panurge hid behind their napkins and began to cry miaow, miaow, miaow, meanwhile wiping their eyes and pretending to weep. The maidens, who had been properly trained, offered full chalices of Clementine wine all round, with an abundance of preserved fruits. And thus was jollity restored to the feast. As dinner ended, Homenaz offered us a large number of lovely fat pears, saying: ‘Take these, Beloved. They are very special pears: you will find them nowhere else. No land yields every crop : only India yields black ebony; good incense comes from Sabaea, and sigil-late earth from the isle of Lesbos: and these beautiful pears are borne by this isle alone. If you would like to, plant some in a nursery-garden in your own land.’","EPISTEMON, Fryar Jhon, and Panurge seeing this doleful Catastrophe began under the cover of their Napkins to cry, Meeow, Meeow, Meeow, feigning to wipe their Eyes all the while as if they had wept. The Wenches were doubly diligent and brought Brimmers of Clementine Wine to every one, besides store of Sweetmeats, and thus the Feasting was reviv’d. Before we arose from Table, Homenas gave us a great quantity of fair large Pears; saying, Here, my good Friends, these are singular good Pears; you’ll find none such anywhere else, I dare warrant. Every Soil bears not every thing you know: India alone boasts black Ebony, the best Incense is produced in Sabœa, the Sphragitid Earth at Lemnos: So this Island is the only Place where such fine Pears grow. You may, if you please, make Seminaries with their Pippins, in your Country."
"– Ha ! ha ! tu es gentil compagnon, dit-il. Nous avons, avec l’aide de Dieu, conquesté[13] tout le pays des Dipsodes ; je te donne la châtellenie de Salmigondin.","– Ha! ha! you are a good companion, he said. We have, with the help of God, conquered[13] the whole country of the Dipsodes; I give you the castellany of Salmigondin.","CHAPTER 2 [In Gargantua it was Alcofrybas (the ‘author’ of the tale) who was given Salmagundi. Here it is given to Panurge, who, greatly changed from the trickster of Pantagruel – he never appears in Gargantua of course – is now the spinner of words and arguments who can twist the most hallowed moral maxims so as to justify imprudence, profligacy and a contempt for thrifr. He is so wrong-headed that he even admires the Sorbonne! ‘ To eat one’s corn in the blade’ (that is, ‘when it is but grass’) is the height of imprudence and folly. (Similarly for a landowner to cut down his tali trees was a sign of dire poverty.","Grammercy, my Lord, said I, you gratifie me beyond all that I have deserved of you. CHAPTER XXXIII How Pantagruel became sick, and the manner how he was recovered. A WHILE after this the good Pantagruel fell sick, and had such an obstruction in his stomack, that he could neither eate nor drink: and because mischief seldome comes alone, a hot pisse seised on him, which tormented him more then you would beleeve: His Physicians neverthelesse helped him very well, and with store of lenitives and diuretick drugs made him pisse away his paine : his urine was so hot, that since that time it is not yet cold, and you have of it in divers places of France, according to the course that it took, and they are called the hot baths, as At Coderets. At Limous. At Dast. At Ballervie. At Nerie. At Bourbonansie, and elsewhere in Italie. At Mongros."
"– Je vois Panurge, dit Rondibilis, bien proportionné en ses membres, bien tempéré en ses humeurs, bien complexionné en ses esprits, en âge compétent, en temps opportun, en vouloir équitable de soi marier. S’il rencontre femme de semblable température[30], ils engendront ensemble enfants dignes de quelque monarchie transpontine[31]. Le plus tôt sera le meilleur, s’il veut voir ses enfants pourvus.","""I see Panurge,"" said Rondibilis, ""well-proportioned in his limbs, well-tempered in his moods, well-complexioned in his mind, of competent age, in due time, desiring justly to marry."" If he meets a woman of similar temperature[30], together they will beget children worthy of some Transpontine monarchy[31]. The sooner the better, if he wants to see his children provided.","‘Panurge, now, I see,’ said Rondibilis, ‘is well-proportioned in his limbs, well-tempered in his humours , well-complexioned in his spirits, of the proper age, at the appropriate moment and with a balanced determination to get married. If he were to meet a wife of similar temperament they would beget offspring worthy of some transpontine monarchy. And the sooner the better if he wants to see them provided for.’","I see Panurge, quoth Rondibilis, neatly featured, and proportioned in all the Members of his Body, of a good temperament in his Humors, well complexioned in his Spirits, of a competent Age, in an opportune Time, and of a reasonably forward Mind to be married: Truly, if he encounter with a Wife of the like Nature, Temperament, and Constitution, he may beget upon her Children worthy of some Transpontine Monarchy; and the sooner he marry, it will be the better for him, and the more conducible for his Profit, if he would see and have his Children in his own time well provided for."

"– Dieu, dit Panurge, vous a fait belle grâce d’échapper de leurs griffes : je n’y retourne pas, quant est de moi. Je me sens encore ému et altéré de l’ahan[9] que j’y pâtis, et y fus grandement fâché pour trois causes : la première, pour ce que j’y étais fâché, la seconde, pour ce que j’y étais fâché, la tierce pour ce que j’y étais fâché. Écoute ici de ton oreille dextre, frère Jean, mon couillon gauche. Toutes et quantes fois que voudras aller à. tous les diables, devant le tribunal de Minos, Æcus, Rhadamantus et Dites, je suis prêt te faire compagnie indissoluble, avec toi passer Achéron, Styx, Cocyte, boire plein godet du fleuve Léthé, payer pour nous deux à Charon le naule[10] de sa barque. Pour retourner au guichet, si de fortune veux retourner, saisis-toi d’autre compagnie que de la mienne, je n’y retournerai pas : ce mot te soit une muraille d’airain. Si par force et violence ne suis mené, je n’en approcherai, tant que cette vie je vivrai en plus que Calpe d’Abila. Ulysses retourna-t-il quérir son épée en la caverne du Cyclope ? Ma dia[11], non ! Au guichet je n’ai rien oublié, je n’y retournerai pas.","“God,” said Panurge, “has done you a good grace to escape from their claws: I am not going back there, as for me. I still feel moved and altered by the ahan[9] that I suffered there, and was greatly angry there for three reasons: the first, for what I was angry there, the second, for what I was angry, the third for what I was angry there. Listen here with your dexter ear, brother Jean, my left asshole. All and as many times as you want to go to. all the devils, before the tribunal of Minos, Æcus, Rhadamantus and Say, I am ready to make you indissoluble company, with you pass Acheron, Styx, Cocyte, drink full bucket of the river Lethe, pay for both of us at Charon the naule[10 ] from his boat. To return to the wicket, if fortune wants to return, seize no other company than mine, I will not return there: this word is a wall of brass to you. If by force and violence I am led, I will not approach it, as long as this life I will live in more than Calpe d'Abila. Did Ulysses return to fetch his sword from the cave of the Cyclops? My dia[11], no! At the counter I have not forgotten anything, I will not go back.","‘God,’ said Panurge, ‘has graciously vouchsafed that you escape from their claws. As for me, I won’t go back. I still feel troubled and upset from the anguish I suffered there. I was greatly vexed there for three reasons. First: because I was vexed. Second: because I was vexed. Third, because I was vexed. Frère Jean, my old left bollock, hearken to this with your right ear: each and every time you would go to all the devils before the judgement-seats of Minos, Aeacus, Rhadamanthus and Dis, I am ready to maintain an unbreakable comradeship with you, crossing the Acheron, Styx and Cocytus, drinking bumperfuls of the waters of Lethe, and paying both our fares for Charon’s barque. But as for that wicket-gate, if you do happen to want to go back there, press into your company someone else but me. I will not go back. Let those words be unto you a wall of brass. Unless I’m dragged there by might and main I shall never draw nigh there, as long as I love this life, no more than Mount Calpe will draw nigh to Abila. Did Hercules go back to fetch the sword he had left in the Cyclops’ cavern? That, by Jove, he did not. I left nothing behind at the wicket-gate: I shall not go back to it.’","’Tis a very great Mercy, quoth Panurge, that you have got out of their Clutches; for my part, I have no stomach to go there again; I’m hardly come to my self yet, so scar’d and appall’d I was; my hair still stands up an end when I think on ’t; and most damnably troubled I was there, for three very weighty Reasons. First, Because I was troubled. Secondly, Because I was troubled. Thirdly and lastly, Because I was troubled. Heark’n to me a little on thy right side, Friar Jhon, my left Cod, since thou’lt not hear at the other: Whenever the Maggot bites thee, to take a Journey down to Hell, and visit the Tribunal of Minos, Eacus, and Rhadamantus, do but tell me, and I’ll be sure to bear thee company, and never leave thee, as long as my name’s Panurge, but will wade over Acheron, Styx, and Cocytus, drink whole Bumpers of Lethe’s Water, (tho I mortally hate that Element) and even pay thy Passage to that bawling cross-grain’d Ferryman Charon. But as for that damn’d Wicket, if thou art so weary of thy life as to go thither again, thou may’st e’en look for some body else to bear thee company; for I’ll not move one step that way, e’en rest satisfy’d with this positive Answer. By my good-will, I’ll not stir a foot to go thither as long as I live, any more than Calpe will come over to Abyla. [Calpe is a Mountain in Spain, that faces another, call’d Abyla in Mauritiania, both said to have been sever d by Hercules.] Was Ulysses so mad as to go back into the Cyclops’s Cave to fetch his Sword? No marry was he not. Now I have left nothing behind me at the Wicket through forgetfulness, why then should I think of going thither?"
"– Il dit bien, monsieur Antitus, dit frère Jean. Ci voyants ces diables d’oiseaux, ne faisons que blasphémer : vidant vos bouteilles et pots, ne faisons que Dieu louer. Allons donc boire d’autant. O le beau mot ! »","“He says well, Monsieur Antitus,” said Brother Jean. Ci seeing these devils of birds, let us only blaspheme: emptying your bottles and pots, let us only praise God. Let's go and drink that much. Oh the beautiful word! »","‘He puts it well, does Monsieur Antitus,’ said Frère Jean. ‘When looking at these diabolical birds here we do nothing but blaspheme: when emptying your bottles and wine-jars we do nothing but praise God. So let’s drink to one another. O, what a nice saying!’","He that spoke last, spoke well, Mr. Antitus, quoth Fryar Jhon; while we are looking on these devilish Birds, we do nothing but blaspheme; and while we are taking a Cup, we do nothing but praise God. Come on then, let’s go drink: How well that word sounds!"

"Issants[6] du guichet, fûmes conduits jusques au port par certains griffons[7] de montagnes. Avant entrer en nos navires, fûmes par iceux avertis que n’eussions à chemin prendre sans premier avoir fait présents seigneuriaux tant à la dame Grippeminaude qu’à toutes les chattes fourrées, autrement avaient commission nous ramener au guichet. « Bren[8], répondit frère Jean ; nous ici à l’écart visiterons le fond de nos deniers, et donnerons à tous contentement.","Issants[6] from the counter, were led to the port by certain mountain griffins[7]. Before entering our ships, we were informed by them that we had no way to take without first having made seigneurial presents both to the lady Grippeminaude and to all the furry cats, otherwise we had been commissioned to bring us back to the counter. “Bren[8],” replied Brother Jean; we here apart will search the bottom of our money, and give contentment to all.","Leaving by the wicket-gate, we were conducted as far as the port by certain highland Clawyers. There, before we boarded our ships, they warned us that we could not set sail until we had first bestowed lordly presents on Dame Catty-claws and all the female Furry-cats; otherwise they had been commissioned to march us back to the wicket-gate. ‘Pooh!’ said Frère Jean, ‘we shall draw aside and dig into our coffers and make them all happy.’","As we came out at the Wicket, we were conducted to the Port by a Detachment of certain Highland-Griffins, scribere cum dashoes, who advised us, before we came to our Ships, not to offer to leave the place, till we had made the usual Presents, first to the Lady Gripe-men-all, then to all the Furr’d Law-Pusses; otherwise we must return to the place from whence we came. Well, well, saith Fryar Jhon, we’ll fumble in our Fobs, examine every one of us his Concern, and e’en give the Women their due; we’ll ne’er boggle or stick out on that account; as we tickled the Men in the Palm, we’ll tickle the Women in the right place."
"Picrochole, ainsi désespéré, s’enfuit vers l'Île-Bouchart, et au chemin de Rivière son cheval broncha parterre, à quoi tant fut indigné que de son épée le tua en sa chole[2]. Puis ne trouvant personne qui le remontât, voulut prendre un âne du moulin qui là auprès était ; mais les meuniers le meurtrirent tout de coups, et le détroussèrent de ses habillements, et lui baillèrent pour soi couvrir une méchante séquenie[3]. Ainsi s’en alla le pauvre colérique ; puis passant l’eau au Port-Huault, et racontant ses maies fortunes[4], fut avisé par une vieille lourpidon[5] que son royaume lui serait rendu à la venue des coquecigrues ; depuis ne sait-on qu’il est devenu. Toutefois l’on m’a dit qu’il est de présent pauvre gagne-denier à Lyon, colère comme devant, et toujours se guémente[6] à tous étrangers de la venue des coquecigrues, espérant certainement, selon la prophétie de la vieille, être à leur venue réintégré en son royaume.","Picrochole, thus in despair, fled towards Île-Bouchart, and on the Chemin de Rivière his horse stumbled on the ground, at which he was so indignant that his sword killed him in his stomach. Then, finding no one to go up it, wanted to take a donkey from the mill which was near it; but the millers bruised him suddenly, and robbed him of his clothes, and gave him to cover himself with a wicked sequence. So went the poor choleric; then passing the water at Port-Huault, and recounting his misfortunes[4], was informed by an old lourpidon[5] that his kingdom would be restored to him at the arrival of the cockroaches; since we do not know that he became. However, I have been told that he is now a poor earner in Lyon, angry as before, and always complaining[6] to all strangers of the arrival of the cockroaches, certainly hoping, according to the prophecy of the old , to be at their coming reinstated in his kingdom.","So Picrochole now fled in despair towards L’lle-Bouchard. On the road to Rivière his horse stumbled and fell; at which he was so incensed that he drew his sword and killed it in a fit of choler. Then, finding nobody to provide another mount, he tried to steal a miller’s donkey which was standing by, but the millers showered him with blows, relieved him of his clothing and tossed him a miserable smock to cover himself with. Thus went that choleric wretch on his way. Having passed over the waters at Port-Huault, he related his misfortunes to an ancient sorceress who foretold that his kingdom would be restored to him when the Worricows come home. What became of him afterwards nobody knows. Yet I have been told that he is at present a penny-labourer in Lyons, still as choleric as ever, always catechizing every stranger about the home-coming of the Worricows, in certain hope of being reinstated in his kingdom at their home-coming one day as that old woman’s prophecy had foretold.","PICROCHOLE thus in despaire, fled towards the Bouchard Island, and in the way to Rivere his horse stumbled and fell down, whereat he on a sudden was so incensed , that he with his sword without more ado killed him in his choler; then not finding any that would remount him, he was about to have taken an Asse at the Mill that was thereby: but the Millers men did so baste his bones, and so soundly bethwack him, that they made him both black and blew with strokes; then, stripping him of all his clothes, gave him a scurvie old canvas jacket wherewith to cover his nakednesse. Thus went along this poor cholerik wretch, who passing the water at Porthuaux, and relating his misadventurous disasters, was foretold by an old Lourpidon hag, that his Kingdome should be restored to him at the coming of the Cocklicranes, which she called Coquecigrues. What is become of him since we cannot certainly tell, yet was I told that he is now a porter at Lyons, as testie and pettish in humour as ever he was before, and would be alwayes with great lamentation enquiring at all strangers of the coming of the Cocklicranes, expecting assuredly, (according to the old womans prophecie,) that at their coming he shall be re-established in his Kingdom."
"Les ennemis, après soi être réveillés, voyants d’un côté le feu en leur camp et l’inondation et déluge urinai, ne savaient que dire ni que penser. Aucuns disaient que c’était la fin du monde et le jugement final, qui doit être consommé par feu ; les autres, que les dieux marins Neptune, Protéus, Tritons, autres, les persécutaient et que de fait, c’était eau marine et salée.","The enemies, after waking up, seeing on one side the fire in their camp and the inundation and deluge urinai, did not know what to say or what to think. Some said it was the end of the world and the final judgment, which must be consumed by fire; the others, that the sea gods Neptune, Proteus, Tritons, others, persecuted them and that in fact, it was sea and salt water.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","The enemies after that they were awaked, seeing on one side the fire in the Camp, and on the other the inundation of the urinal deluge, could not tell what to say, nor what to think; some said, that it was the end of the world, and the final judgement, which ought to be by fire: Others again thought that the sea-gods, Neptune, Protheus, Triton, and the rest of them, did persecute them, for that indeed they found it to be like sea-water and salt."

"Épistémon avait une main toute au dedans écorchée et sanglante, pour avoir en violence grande retenu une des gumènes[5], et, entendant le discours de Pantagruel, dit : « Croyez, seigneur, que j’ai eu de peur et de frayeur non moins que Panurge. Mais quoi ? Je ne me suis épargné au secours. Je considère que si vraiment mourir est (comme est) de nécessité fatale et inévitable, en telle heure ou telle heure, en telle ou telle façon mourir est en la sainte volonté de Dieu. Pourtant[6] icelui faut incessamment implorer, invoquer, prier, requérir, supplier. Mais là ne faut faire but et borne. De notre part, convient pareillement nous évertuer, et, comme dit le saint Envoyé, être coopérateurs avec lui. Vous savez que dit C. Flaminius, consul, lorsque, par l’astuce d’Annibal, il fut resserré près le lac de Péruse, dit Thrasymène : « Enfants, dit-il à ses soudards, d’ici sortir ne vous faut espérer par vœux et imploration des dieux. Par force et vertu il nous convient évader et à fil d’épée chemin faire par le milieu des ennemis. » Pareillement, en Salluste, l’aide (dit M. Portius Cato) des dieux n’est impétrée[7] par vœux ocieux[8] par lamentations mulièbres[9]. En veillant, travaillant, soi évertuant, toutes choses succèdent à souhait[10] et bon port. Si, en nécessité et danger, est l’homme négligent, éviré[11] et paresseux, sans propos il implore les dieux. Ils sont irrités et indignés.","Epistemon had a hand all inside scratched and bloody, for having with great violence retained one of the gumènes [5], and, hearing the speech of Pantagruel, said: ""Believe, lord, that I was afraid and terrified not less than Panurge. But what ? I did not spare myself the help. I consider that if really to die is (as is) of fatal and inevitable necessity, in such and such an hour, in such and such a way, to die is in the holy will of God. Yet[6] he must incessantly implore, invoke, pray, request, beg. But there must be no goal and limit. On our part, it is equally fitting to strive, and, as the holy Messenger says, to be cooperators with him. You know that said C. Flaminius, consul, when, by the cunning of Hannibal, he was confined near Lake Perugia, said Thrasymene: ""Children,"" he said to his soldiers, by wishes and imploration of the gods. By strength and virtue it is advisable for us to escape and to make our way through the midst of enemies. Similarly, in Sallust the help (says Mr. Portius Cato) of the gods is not impetrated[7] by ocious vows[8] by many lamentations[9]. By watching, working, striving, all things succeed as desired[10] and good port. If, in necessity and danger, man is negligent, shabby[11] and lazy, without purpose he implores the gods. They are irritated and indignant.","Epistemon had all the palm of one hand flayed and bloody from having held fast to a hawser with all his might; upon hearing the words of Pantagruel, he said, ‘Believe me, my Lord, I felt no less fear and terror than Panurge. But then what? I did not spare myself as I helped. I consider that if, in truth, dying is – as indeed it is – a matter of fatal and unavoidable necessity, dying at such-and-such a time and in such-and-such a manner is within the holy will of God. Wherefore we must ceaselessly implore him, entreat, invoke, petition and beseech him. But we must not make that our bounds and our limit: we, on our part, must duly exert ourselves and, as the Holy Envoy say, be workers together with him.55 ‘You know what Gaius Flaminius, the consul, said when he was cleverly pinned down by Hannibal near the lake in Perusia called Thrasymene: “Lads,” he said to his soldiers, “you cannot hope to escape from here by making vows or imploring the gods: it is by our might and valour that we must escape, slicing our way through the enemy with the edge of our swords.” ‘So too in Sallust: “The help of the gods [said Marcus Portius Rabelais remains loyal to the partly/partly moral theology of Saint Bonaventura, which he studied as a Franciscan friar. Cato] is not secured by idle vows or womanish weepings: it is by watching, toiling and exerting ourselves that all things reach [as we wish] a goodly port. If anyone is neglectful, unmanly and lazy in the face of danger and necessity it is in vain that he implores the gods, who are angered by him and outraged.”’","Epistemon (who had the inside of one of his Hands all fleea’d and bloody, having held a Tackling with might and main) hearing what Pantagruel had said, told him, You may believe, my Lord, I had my share of fear, as well as Panurge, yet I spar’d no Pains in lending my helping Hand. I consider’d, that since by fatal and unavoidable necessity, we must all die, it is the blessed Will of God that we die this or that hour, and this or that kind of death; nevertheless we ought to implore, invoke, pray, beseech, and supplicate him; but yet we must not stop there ; it behoveth us also to use our endeavours on our side, and, as the Holy Writ saith, to cooperate with him. You know what C. Flaminius the Consul said, when by Hannibal’s Policy he was penn’d up near the Lake of Peruse alias Thrasymene, Friends (said he to his Soldiers) you must not hope to get out of this place barely by Vows or Prayers to the Gods; no, ’tis by Fortitude and Strength we must escape, and cut ourselves a way with the edge of our Swords, through the midst of our Enemies. Sallust likewise makes M. Portius Cato say this, The help of the Gods is not obtain’d by idle Vows, and Womanish Complaints; ’tis by Vigilance, Labour, and repeated Endeavours that all things succeed according to our Wishes and Designs. If a Man in time of need and danger is negligent, heartless, and lazy, in vain he implores the Gods; they are then justly angry and incens’d against him."
"– Vous, dit Épistémon, ne répondez à ce que le rameau de laurier, nous voyants, elle considérant et exclamante en voix furieuse et épouvantable, brûlait sans bruit ni grillement aucun. Vous savez que c’est triste augure et signe grandement redoutable, comme attestent Properce, Tibulle, Porphyre, philosophe argut[35], Eustathius sur l’Iliade homérique, et autres.","""You,"" said Epistemon, ""do not answer that the laurel branch, seeing us, she considering and exclaiming in a furious and dreadful voice, was burning without noise or grilling whatsoever. You know that it is a sad omen and a highly formidable sign, as Propertius, Tibullus, Porphyry, philosopher argut[35], Eustathius on the Homeric Iliad, and others attest.","‘You,’ said Epistemon, ‘say nothing about the fact that the laurel branch (in our sight, with the Sibyl gazing at it and shrieking in a frenzied frightening voice) burnt without a crackle or any other sound. That, you know, is a baneful augury and a most redoubtable sign, vouched for by Proper-tius, Tibullus, that subtle philosopher Porphyry, Eustathius, Homer’s Iliad and others.’","Yea, but (quoth Epistemon) you say nothing of her most dreadful Cries and Exclamations, when she and we both saw the Lawrel-bough burn without yielding any noise or crackling. You know it is a very dismal Omen, an inauspicious sign, unlucky judice, and token formidable, bad, disastrous, and most unhappy, as is certified by Propertius, Tibullus, the quick Philosopher Porphyrius, Eustachius on the Iliads of Homer, and by many others."
"« Ainsi ne pourvut nature à la perpétuité de l’humain genre. Ains[7] créa l’homme nu, tendre, fragile, sans armes ni offensives ni défensives, en état d’innocence et premier âge d’or, comme animant[8], non plante, comme animant, dis-je, né à paix, non à guerre, animant né à jouissance mirifique de tous fruits et plantes végétales, animant né à domination pacifique sur toutes bêtes. Ad venant la multiplication de malice entre les humains, en succession de l’âge de fer et règne de Jupiter, la terre commença produire orties, chardons, épines et telle autre matière de rébellion contre l’homme, entre les végétables[9]. D’autre part, presque tous animaux, par fatale disposition, s’émancipèrent de lui et ensemble tacitement conspirèrent plus ne le servir, plus ne lui obéir, en tant que résister pourraient, mais lui nuire selon leur faculté et puissance. L’homme adonc, voulant sa première jouissance maintenir et sa première domination continuer, non aussi pouvant soi commodément passer du service de plusieurs animaux, eut nécessité soi armer de nouveau.","“Thus nature did not provide for the perpetuity of the human race. Ains[7] created the naked man, tender, fragile, without weapons neither offensive nor defensive, in a state of innocence and first golden age, as animating[8], not plant, as animating, I say, born to peace, not to war, animating born to marvelous enjoyment of all fruits and vegetable plants, animating born to peaceful domination over all beasts. With the multiplication of malice between humans, in succession from the iron age and the reign of Jupiter, the earth began to produce nettles, thistles, thorns and such other matter of rebellion against man, among the vegetables[9]. On the other hand, almost all animals, by fatal disposition, emancipated themselves from him and together tacitly conspired no longer to serve him, no longer to obey him, as much as they could resist, but to harm him according to their ability and power. The man therefore, wanting his first enjoyment to maintain and his first domination to continue, not also being able to easily pass from the service of several animals, had to arm himself again.","‘Not so has Nature provided for the perpetuation of the human race: in the state of innocence, in the primeval Age of Gold, she created Man naked, tender, fragile, without offensive or defensive armour, as an animate being not a plant: an animate being, I say, born for peace not war, an animate being born for the mirific enjoyment of all fruit and vegetable life, an animate being born for peaceful dominion over all the beasts. ‘When, with the succession of the Age of Iron – the Reign of Jupiter – there came an increase in wickedness between human beings, the earth began to bring forth nettles, thistles, thorns and other forms of revolt against Man on the part of vegetable life, and virtually all the animals, for their part, became fatally disposed to emancipate themselves from him and quietly conspired no longer to slave for him and no longer to obey him insofar as they could resist him, rather doing him harm according to their abilities and powers. ‘Man therefore, desiring to maintain his original privileges and to prolong his original domination, and not being able easily to forego the servitude of many of the beasts, found it necessary to don some novel armour.’","Nature nevertheless did not after that manner provide for the sempiternizing of Human Race: but on the contrary created Man naked, tender, and frail, without either offensive or defensive Arms; and that in the Estate of Innocence, in the first Age of all, which was the Golden Season; not as a Plant, but living Creature, born for Peace, not War, and brought forth into the World with an unquestionable Right and Title to the plenary fruition and enjoyment of all Fruits and Vegetables; as also to a certain calm and gentle Rule and Dominion over all kinds of Beasts, Fowls, Fishes, Reptils, and Insects. Yet afterwards it hapning in the time of the Iron Age, under the Reign of Jupiter, when to the multiplication of mischievous Actions, wickedness and malice began to take root and footing within the then perverted Hearts of Men, that the Earth began to bring forth Nettles, Thistles, Thorns, Bryars, and such other stubborn and rebellious Vegetables to the Nature of Man; nor scarce was there any Animal, which by a fatal disposition did not then revolt from him, and tacitly conspire, and covenant with one another to serve him no longer, (nor in case of their ability to resist) to do him any manner of Obedience, but rather (to the uttermost of their Power) to annoy him with all the hurt and harm they could. The Man then, that he might maintain his primitive Right and Prerogative, and continue his Sway and Dominion over all, both Vegetable and Sensitive Creatures; and knowing of a truth, that he could not be well accommodated as he ought, without the servitude and subjection of several Animals, bethought himself, that of necessity he must needs put on Arms, and make provision of Harness against Wars and Violence."

"Adonc brièvement leur remontra comment telles manières de recueil[15] en armes avait souvent porté mortel préjudice, sous couleur de caresse et amitié. « Ainsi, disait-il, l’empereur Antonin Caracalle, à l’une fois occit les Alexandrins, à l’autre défit la compagnie d’Artaban, roi des Perses, sous couleur et fiction de vouloir sa fille épouser, ce que ne resta impuni, car peu après il y perdit la vie. Ainsi les enfants de Jacob, pour venger le rapt de leur sœur Dyna, sacmentèrent[16] les Sichimiens. En cette hypocritique façon, par Galien, empereur romain, furent les gens de guerre défaits devant Constantinople. Ainsi, sous espèce d’amitié, Antoninus attira Artavasdes, roi d’Arménie, puis le fit lier et enferrer de grosses chaînes, finalement le fit occire. Mille autres pareilles histoires trouvons-nous par[17] les antiques monuments, et à bon droit est, jusques à présent, de prudence grandement loué Charles, roi de France, sixième de ce nom, lequel retournant victorieux des Flamands et Gantois en sa bonne ville de Paris, et, au Bourget en France, entendant que les Parisiens avec leurs maillets (dont furent surnommés Maillotins) étaient hors la ville issus en bataille jusques au nombre de vingt mille combattants, n’y voulut entrer, quoiqu’ils remontrassent qu’ainsi s’étaient mis en armes pour plus honorablement le recueillir[18] sans autre fiction ni mauvaise affection[19], que premièrement ne se fussent en leurs maisons retirés et désarmés. »","So briefly showed them how such manners of collection[15] in arms had often brought mortal harm, under color of caress and friendship. ""Thus,"" he said, ""the Emperor Antonin Caracalle, on one occasion slew the Alexandrians, on the other defeated the company of Artaban, king of the Persians, under color and fiction of wanting to marry his daughter, which remained unpunished, because shortly afterwards he lost his life. Thus the children of Jacob, to avenge the abduction of their sister Dyna, sacmented [16] the Sichemians. In this hypocritical way, by Galen, Roman emperor, the men of war were defeated before Constantinople. Thus, as a kind of friendship, Antoninus attracted Artavasdes, king of Armenia, then had him bound and locked in heavy chains, finally had him slain. A thousand other similar stories do we find by [17] the ancient monuments, and with good reason is, until now, of prudence greatly praised Charles, king of France, sixth of this name, who returning victorious from the Flemings and Ghent in his good city of Paris, and, at Le Bourget in France, hearing that the Parisians with their mallets (which were surnamed Maillotins) were outside the city issued in battle until the number of twenty thousand combatants, did not want to enter there, although they showed that Thus had they taken up arms to receive it more honorably[18] without further fiction or bad affection[19], than had first retired and disarmed to their homes. »","He then pointed out how such practices of greeting under arms had often brought mortal danger under colour of a warm welcome and friendliness. ‘It was thus,’ he said, ‘that, on one occasion, the Emperor Antoninus Caracalla massacred the Athenians and on another occasion, overcame the retinue of Artaban, the King of Persia, under the false pretence of wanting to marry his daughter. That did not go unpunished: he lost his life there soon afterwards. ‘Thus did the sons of Jacob slaughter the Sichemists to wreak revenge for the rape of their sister Dinah. In that hypocritical fashion the soldiers within Constantinople were killed by Gallienus, the Roman Emperor; thus too, under pretence of friendship, Antoninus invited Artavasdes, the King of Armenia, and then had him bound, placed in heavy fetters and finally murdered. ‘We find hundreds of similar cases in the ancient muniments. And to this day Charles, the Sixth King of France of that name, is rightly and greatly praised for his wisdom: for, when returning to his goodly town of Paris after his victory over the men of Flanders and of Ghent, he learnt at Le Bourget that the Parisians, to the number of twenty thousand fighting-men, had marched out of the Town in battle array, all armed with mallets (maillots, hence their name of Maillotins). Although they protested that they had, without deceit or ill-will, thus taken up arms to welcome him more honourably , he would not make his entry before they had gone back to their homes and disarmed.’ How Pantagruel sent for Colonels Poke-Banger and Spoilchidling, with a notable disquisition on the proper names of places and persons","He briefly shew’d them how this way of reception with Arms, had often, under colour of Compliment and Friendship been fatal to the Parties so receiv’d. Thus, said he, the Emperor Antonius Caracalla at one time destroy’d the Citizens of Alexandria; and at another time cut off the Attendants of Artabanus King of Persia, under color of Marrying his Daughter: Which, by the way, did not pass unpunish’d, for a while after, this cost him his life. Thus Jacob’s Children destroy’d the Sichemites, to revenge the Rape of their Sister Dina. By such another hypocritical trick, Galienus the Roman Emperor put to death the Military Men in Constantinople. Thus, under colour of Friendship, Antonius inticed Artavasdes King of Armenia, then having caused him to be bound in heavy Chains, and shackled, at last put him to death.

The heartbroken[4] he had bandaged and treated in his great nosocom[5]. Afterwards, notified the damage done to the city and inhabitants, and had them reimbursed for all their interests, at their confession and oath, and had a fortified castle built there, committing men and watches there, in order to better defend themselves against them in the future. the sudden riots. On leaving[6], he graciously thanked all the roughnecks of his legions, who had been defeated, and sent them back to winter in their stations and garrisons, except for some of the Decuman[7] legion whom he had seen during the day doing some prowess, and the captains of the bands, which he brought with him to Grandgousier.","He then had the dead buried with honour in the valley of the Noyrettes and in the fields at Brûlevieille. The injured, their wounds dressed, were treated in his great Nosocome. After that he informed himself of the depredations suffered by the town, and by its inhabitants whom he compensated for all their losses against sworn affidavits. He further had a fort built there, stationing soldiers and look-outs in it so as the better to defend himself in the future against rash disturbances. On departing he graciously thanked all the soldiers of his legions who had taken part in the defeat, sending them back to their barracks and garrisons for the winter, except some of the Decuman Legion, whose great deeds he had witnessed that day, and the Captains of each troop, with whom he set out towards Grandgousier.","Gargantua did them no other hurt, but that he appointed them to pull at the Presses of his Printing-house, which he had newly set up; then those who died there he caused to be honourably buried in Black-soile-valley, and Burn-hag-field, and gave order that the wounded should be drest and had care of in his great Hospital or Nosocome. After this, considering the great prejudice done to the towne and its inhabitants, he re-imbursed their charges, and repaired all the losses that by their confession upon oath could appear they had sustained: and for their better defence and security in times coming against all sudden uproars and invasions, commanded a strong citadel to be built there with a competent Garison to maintaine it; at his departure he did very graciously thank all the souldiers of the brigades that had been at this overthrow, and sent them back to their winter-quarters in their several stations and Garisons; the Decumane Legion onely excepted, whom in the field on that day he saw do some great exploit, and their Captains also, whom he brought along with himself unto Grangousier."
48. Comment entre les paroles dégelées Pantagruel trouva des mots de gueules[1],48. How between the unfrozen words Pantagruel found swearwords[1],"CHAPTER 56 [A lighter chapter with more laughs than openly displayed erudition, one with Pathelin again in mind. There is a common legal source behind this chapter, the preceding one and the Third Book: the first title of Book 45 of the New Digest, headed On the Obligation of Words. It is from a gloss on that title that Rabelais cites the allusion to Exodus 20:18 (Vulgate Latin): ‘All the people saw the voices’. The Adages of Erasmus make further contributions: I, V, XLIX, ‘To give words’ – which means to deceive (as, says Erasmus, lovers do), and I, VII, XIX, ‘To suffer from money-quinsy’ (that is, Argen-tangina pati) as did Demosthenes who suffered from a sort of bribed aphasia when paid not to speak.

"Au lendemain, après boire (comme entendez), prirent chemin Gargantua, son précepteur Ponocrates et ses gens, ensemble eux[11] Eudémon, le jeune page. Et parce que c’était en temps serein et bien attrempé[12], son père lui fit faire des bottes fauves : Babin les nomme brodequins. Ainsi joyeusement passèrent leur grand chemin et toujours grand’chère, jusques au-dessus d’Orléans. Auquel lieu était une ample forêt, de la longueur de trente et cinq lieues, et de largeur dix et sept, ou environ. Icelle était horriblement fertile et copieuse en mouches bovines et frelons, ds sorte que c’était une vraie briganderie pour les pauvres juments, ânes et chevaux. Mais la jument de Gargantua vengea honnêtement tous les outrages en icelle perpétrées sur les bêtes de son espèce, par un tour duquel ne se doutaient mie, car soudain qu’ils furent entrés en ladite forêt et que les frelons lui eurent livré l’assaut, elle dégaina sa queue, et si bien s’escarmouchant les émoucha qu’elle en abattit tout le bois. À tort, à travers, deçà, delà, par ci, par là, de long, de large, dessus, dessous, abattait bois comme un faucheur fait d’herbes. En sorte que, depuis, n’y eut ni bois ni frelons, mais fut tout le pays réduit en campagne.","The next day, after drinking (as hear), took the road Gargantua, his tutor Ponocrates and his people, together them[11] Eudémon, the young page. And because the weather was serene and very temperate[12], his father made him make tawny boots: Babin calls them boots. Thus joyously passed their high way and always great dear, even above Orleans. In which place was an ample forest, the length of thirty and five leagues, and the breadth of ten and seven, or thereabouts. Icelle was horribly fertile and abundant in cattle flies and hornets, so that it was a real robbery for the poor mares, donkeys and horses. But Gargantua's mare honestly avenged all the outrages therein perpetrated on the beasts of her kind, by a trick of which no one suspected, for suddenly they entered the said forest and the hornets attacked her, she unsheathed her tail, and, skirmishing, blunted them so well that she knocked down all the wood. Wrongly, across, on this side, on this side, this way, this way, up and down, above, below, felled wood like a reaper made of grass. So that, since then, there were neither woods nor hornets, but the whole country was reduced to a campaign.","So the next morning – after a drink you understand – Gargantua, his attendants and his tutor Ponocrates set out on their way together with their young page Eudemon. And because the weather was mild and moderate Gargantua’s father had a pair of tawny boots made for him. (Babin the cobbler calls them brodequins.) And so they journeyed merrily along the highway, always enjoying good cheer until just above Orleans. There they found an awesome forest,10 thirty-five leagues long and seventeen wide or thereabouts. It was so appallingly and copiously productive of gad-flies and hornets that it formed a veritable highwayman’s snare for wretched mares, asses and horses. But Gargantua’s mare honourably avenged all the outrages ever perpetrated therein against beasts of her kind, playing them a trick which they least expected. For as soon as the party had ridden into the said forest and the hornets begun their assault, the mare unsheathed her tail and drove them away, so fencing about that she felled the whole forest like a reaper scything grass, cutting this way and that way, hither and thither, lengthways and breadthways, upways and downways, so that no tree or hornet since then remains there: the whole of that land was reduced to a bare plain.","The next morning (after they had drunk, you must understand) they took their journey; Gargantua, his Pedagogue Ponocrates, and his traine, and with them Eudemon the young Page, and because the weather was faire and temperate, his father caused to be made for him a paire of dun boots, Babin calls them buskins: Thus did they merrily passe their time in travelling on their high way, alwayes making good chear, and were very pleasant till they came a little above Orleans, in which place there was a forrest of five and thirty leagues long, and seventeen in breadth, or thereabouts. This forrest was most horribly fertile and copious in dorflies, hornets and wasps, so that it was a very Purgatory for the poor mares, asses and horses: But Gargantua’s mare did avenge herself handsomly of all the out-rages therein committed upon beasts of her kinde, and that by a trick whereof they had no suspicion; for assoon as ever they were entred into the said forest, and that the wasps had given the assault, she drew out and unsheathed her taile, and therewith skirmishing, did so sweep them, that she overthrew all the wood alongst and athwart, here and there, this way and that way, longwise and sidewise, over and under, and felled every where the wood with as much ease, as a mower doth the grasse, in such sort that never since hath ther been there, neither wood, nor Dorflies: for all the countrey was thereby reduced to a plain champian-field: which Gargantua took great pleasure to behold, and said to his company no more but this, Je trouve beau ce, I finde this pretty; whereupon that countrey hath been ever since that time called Beauce: but all the breakfast the mare got that day, was but a little yawning and gaping, in memory whereof the Gentlemen of Beauce, do as yet to this day"
"Davantage[2] syllogisait[3], disant : « Ces gens ici sont bien mal exercés en faits d’armes, car onques ne m’ont demandé ma foi, et ne m’ont ôté mon braquemart[4]. » Soudain après tira son dit braquemart et en férut[5] l’archer qui le tenait à dextre, lui coupant entièrement les veines jugulaires et artères sphagitides[6] du col, avec le gargaréon[7], jusques ès deux adènes[8], et, retirant le coup, lui entrouvrit la moelle spinale entre la seconde et tierce vertèbre ; là tomba l’archer tout mort. Et le moine, détournant son cheval à gauche, courut sur l’autre, lequel, voyant son compagnon mort et le moine avantagé sur soi, criait à haute voix : « Ha ! monsieur le priour, je me rends, monsieur le priour, mon bon ami, monsieur le priour ! » Et le moine criait de même : « Monsieur le postériour, mon ami, monsieur le postériour, vous aurez sur vos postères.","More [2] syllogized [3], saying: “These people here are very badly exercised in feats of arms, because never have asked me my faith, and have not taken away my braquemard [4]. » Suddenly after, his braquemard was fired and in ferut[5] the archer who held him on his dexter, cut completely his jugular veins and sphagitid arteries[6] from the cervix, with the gargareon[7], up to the two adenes[8 ], and, withdrawing the blow, opened his spinal cord between the second and third vertebra; there fell the archer quite dead. And the monk, turning his horse to the left, ran on the other, who, seeing his companion dead and the monk having the advantage over himself, cried aloud: “Ha! Monsieur the Prior, I surrender, Monsieur the Prior, my good friend, Monsieur the Prior! And the monk shouted in the same way: ""Monsieur posterior, my friend, monsieur posterior, you will have on your backs.""","He moreover syllogized, saying: ‘These folk here are very badly trained in the ways of war, since they have never put me on my word nor removed my sword.’ Immediately afterwards he drew forth that sword and struck the archer who was holding him on his right, entirely severing the sphagitid arteries in the neck – his jugular veins – together with the uvula down to the two thyroid glands; then, withdrawing his sword, he prised the spinal marrow half-open between the second and third vertebrae: at which the archer dropped down dead. Then the Monk, tugging his horse to the left, fell upon the other archer who, seeing his comrade dead and the Monk with an advantage over him, loudly bawled, ‘Ah! My Lord Prior, I give in. My Lord Prior, my dear friend, my Lord Prior!’ And the Monk similarly bawled, ‘My Lord Posterior, my friend! My Lord Posterior, you shall get it on your posteriors!’","THE Monk seeing them break off thus without order, conjectured that they were to set upon Gargantua and those that were with him, and was wonderfully grieved that he could not succour them; then considered he the countenance of the two keepers in whose custody he was, who would have willingly runne after the troops to get some booty and plunder, and were always looking towards the valley unto which they were going; farther, he syllogized, saying, These men are but badly skilled in matters of warre, for they have not required my paroll, neither have they taken my sword from me; suddenly hereafter he drew his brackmard or horsemans sword, wherewith he gave the keeper which held him, on the right side such a sound slash, that he cut clean thorough the jugularie veins, and the sphagitid or transparent arteries of the neck, with the fore-part of the throat called the gargareon, even unto the two Adenes, which are throat-kernels; and redoubling the blow, he opened the spinal marrow betwixt the second and third verteber; there fell down that keeper stark dead to the ground. Then the Monk, reining his horse to the left, ranne upon the other, who seeing his fellow dead, and the Monk to have the advantage of him, cried with a loud voice, Ha, my Lord Prior, quarter, I yeeld, my Lord Prior, quarter, quarter, my good friend, my Lord Prior: and the Monk cried likewise, my Lord Posterior, my friend, my Lord Posterior, you shall have it upon your posteriorums: Ha, said the keeper, my Lord Prior, my Minion, my Gentile, Lord Prior"

Je le peux de vous justement dire, comme le dit Caton d’Albidius, lequel avoir[34] en excessive dépense mangé tout ce qu’il possédait, restant seulement une maison, y mit le feu dedans, pour dire : Consummatum est, ainsi que depuis dit saint Thomas d’Aquin, quand il eut la lamproie toute mangée.

It suited everything edible to eat, the rest to throw on[33] the fire, nothing to reserve for the next day. I can justly tell you, as Cato of Albidius says, who having [34] at excessive expense devoured all he possessed, remaining only a house, set fire to it, to say: Consummatum est, thus that since said Saint Thomas Aquinas, when he had the lamprey all eaten. It's not forced. »","‘So (instead of [keeping and] observing the Roman sumptuary laws regulating food and dress: the lex Orchia, the lex Fannia, the lex Didia, the lex Licinia, the lex Cornelia, the lex Lefridania, the lex Antia, and the laws of the Corinthians, by which each person was rigorously forbidden to spend per annum more than his annual income) you have performed a Protervia – Protervia being for the Romans what the Pascal Lamb is for the Jews: everything edible had to be eaten and all the rest cast into the fire, keeping nothing back for the morrow. ‘I can rightly say of you what Cato said of Albidius, who, after devouring by his extravagant expenditure everything he possessed, had nothing left but his house, so he set fire so as to be able to say, “It is finished,” as was subsequently said by Saint Thomas Aquinas when he had consumed a whole lamprey. Not that it matters.’","But instead of observing the Sumptuous Supper-curbing Laws of the Romans, to wit, the Orchia, the Fannia, the Didia, the Licinia, the Cornelia, the Lepidiana, the Antia, and of the Corinthians; by the which they were inhibited, under pain of great punishment, not to spend more in one year, than their annual Revenue did amount to, you have offered up the Oblation of Protervia, which was with the Romans such a Sacrifice as the Paschal Lamb was amongst the Jews, wherein all that was eatable was to be eaten, and the remainder to be thrown into the Fire, without reserving any thing for the next day. I may very justly say of you, as Cato did of Albidius, who after that he had by a most extravagant Expence wasted all the Means and Possessions he had to one only House , he fairly set it on Fire, that he might the better say, Consummatum est.

Tout le monde en figure criait Évohé. Les Ménades premières faisaient incursion sur les Indiens avec cris horribles et sons épouvantables de leurs tymbons[8] et boucliers. Tout le ciel en retentissait, comme désignait l’emblé-mature[9], afin que plus tant n’admiriez l’art d’Apelles, Aristides Thébain, et autres qui ont peint les tonnerres, éclairs, foudres, vents, paroles, mœurs et les esprits.","The Satyrs, captains, band sergeants, squadron caps[3], corporals[4], with cornaboos[5] sounding the orthies[6], circled furiously around the army with goat leaps, leaps, farts, with kicks and kicks[7], giving courage to the companions to fight virtuously. Everyone in the face shouted Évohé. The early Maenads raided the Indians with horrid cries and dreadful sounds of their tymbons[8] and shields. All the heavens resounded with it, as the right from the outset designated[9], so that you no longer admire so much the art of Apelles, Aristides Thébain, and others who painted thunders, lightnings, lightnings, winds, words, manners and minds.","The satyrs, captains, troop-sergeants, squad-leaders and corporals, all with their trumpets sounding martial strains, madly dashed around the army, capering like goats with many a bound, fart, kick and prance, putting heart into their comrades for a valiant fight. All the figures in the mosaic were crying Euhoe! The Maenades were the ones to make the first incursion against the Indians with hideous yells and a terrifying din from their cymbals and bucklers. As depicted in that mosaic, the whole heavens resounded with it: therefore be not so moved to wonder by the art of Apelles, Aristides of Thebes and others who have painted peals of thunder, flashes of lightning, thunderbolts, winds, Words, manners and minds.","The Satyrs Captains, Serjeants, and Corporals of Companies, sounding the Orgies with Cornets, in a furious manner went round the Army, skipping, capering, bounding, jerking, farting, flying out at Heels, kicking and prancing like mad, incouraging their Companions to fight bravely; and all the delineated Army cry’d out Euohe. First the Menades charg’d the Indians with dreadful Shouts, and a horrid Din of their brazen Drums and Bucklers; the Air rung again all-a-round, as the Mosaic Work well express’d it.

That would be the last straw. With doublet undone, raving mad through the fields I’d run.’","But if (quoth Panurge) being ill at ease, and possibly thro’ that Distemper, made unable to discharge the Matrimonial Duty that is incumbent to an active Husband, my Wife, impatient of that drooping Sickness, and faint Fits, of a pining Languishment, should abandon and prostitute herself to the embraces of another Man, and not only then not help and assist me in my extremity and need, but withal flout at, and make sport of that my grievous Distress and Calamity; or peradventure, (which is worse) imbezzle my goods and steal from me, as I have seen it oftentimes befal unto the lot of many other Men, it were enough to undo me utterly, to fill brimful the Cup of my Misfortune, and make me play the Mad-pate Reeks of Bedlam."
"– À Landerousse, dit Rhizotome, ès noces de Jean Delif, fut le festin nuptial notable et somptueux, comme lors était la coutume du pays. Après souper furent jouées plusieurs farces, comédies, sornettes plaisantes, furent dansées plusieurs moresques aux sonnettes et tymbons[34], furent introduites plusieurs sortes de masques et mômeries. Mes compagnons d’école et moi pour la fête honorer à notre pouvoir (car au matin non ; tous avions eu de belles livrées[35] blanc et violet),sur la fin fîmes un barboire[36] joyeux avec force coquilles de saint Michel et belles caquerolles[37] de limaçons. En faute de colocasie, bardane, personate[38] et de papier, des feuillets d’un vieil sixième[39], qui là était abandonné, nous fîmes nos faux visages, les découpants un peu à l’endroit des œils, du nez et de la bouche. Cas merveilleux ! Nos petites caroles[40] et puérils ébatements achevés, ôtants nos faux visages, apparûmes plus hideux et vilains que les diableteaux de la passion de Doué, tant avions les faces gâtées aux lieux touchés par lesdits feuillets. L’un y avait la picote, l’autre le tac[41], l’autre la vérole, l’autre la rougeole, l’autre gros froncles[42]. Somme, celui de nous tous était le moins blessé à qui les dents étaient tombées.","– At Landerousse, said Rhizotome, at the wedding of Jean Delif, was the notable and sumptuous nuptial feast, as was then the custom of the country. After supper, several farces, comedies, and amusing nonsense were played, several moresques were danced to bells and tymbons[34], several kinds of masks and mummeries were introduced. My school companions and I for the party to honor in our power (because in the morning no; all had had beautiful white and purple liveries[35]), at the end we made a joyous barboire[36] with many shells of Saint Michael and beautiful caquerolles[37] of snails. For lack of colocasia, burdock, personate[38] and paper, sheets of an old sixth[39], which there was abandoned, we made our false faces, cutting them a little at the place of the eyes, the nose and mouth. Wonderful case! Our little caroles[40] and puerile frolics completed, removing our false faces, appeared more hideous and ugly than the devils of the passion of Doué, so much had the faces spoiled in the places touched by the said sheets. One had the tickles, the other the tac[41], the other the pox, the other the measles, the other big froncles[42]. Sum, the one of us all was the least injured whose teeth had fallen out.","‘At Landerousse,’ said Rhizotome, ‘at the wedding of Jean Delife, there was a splendid and sumptuous nuptial feast as was then the local custom. After supper several farces, comedies and amusing sketches were put on; then there were danced several morris-dances with jingle and drum. After which various sorts of masques and mummers were brought in. My fellow pupils and I (to honour the revels to the best of our abilities, for we had been given that morning fine white-and-violet favours) made masks with false beards for a merry masquerade, using plenty of snail-shells and Saint-Michèle cockle-shells, but lacking leaves of colocasia, burdock and the personate bugloss as well as paper , we made our masks out of leaves from an old discarded Sextum, cutting out little slits for our eyes, noses and mouths. Then, O wonder! Having taken off our false faces once our little capers and childish shows were over, we appeared more hideous and villainous than the boy-devils in the passion-play at Doué: so marred were our faces wherever the said leaves had touched them. One of us had caught smallpox; another, the plague; another, syphilis; another, measles; and yet another, huge boils. In short, the least disfigured was the one whose teeth had dropped out.’","At Landerousse, said Rhizotome, at John Delif’s Wedding were very great doings, as ’twas then the Custom of the Country. After Supper, several Farces, Interludes, and Comical Scenes were acted: they had also several Morrice-dances with Bells and Tabors; and divers sorts of Masques, and Mummers were let in. My School-fellows and I, to grace the Festival to the best of our Power (for fine white and purple Liveries had been given to all of us in the Morning) contriv’d a merry Mask with store of Cockleshells, shells of Snails, Periwinkles, and such other. Then for want of Cuckoe-pint or Priest-pintle, Louse-bur, Clote, and Paper, we made our selves false Faces with the Leaves of an old Sextum, that had been thrown by and lay there for any one that would take it up, cutting out holes for the Eyes, Nose and Mouth. Now did you ever hear the like since you were born? When we had play’d our little Boyish Antick Tricks, and came to take off our sham-faces, we appear’d more hideous and ugly than the little Devils that acted the Passion at Douay: For our Faces were utterly spoyl’d at the places which had been touch’d by those leaves; one had there the Small Pox, another God’s Token, or the Plague spot, a third the Crinckums, a fourth the Measles, a fifth Botches Pushes and Carbuncles; in short, he came off the least hurt who only lost his Teeth by the bargain."
"« Nature a fait le jour pour soi exercer, pour travailler et vaquer chacun en sa négociation, et, pour ce plus aptement faire, elle nous fournit de chandelle : c’est la claire et joyeuse lumière du soleil. Au soir, elle commence nous la tollir[2] et nous dit tacitement : « Enfants, vous êtes gens de bien, c’est assez travaillé. La nuit vient : il convient cesser[3] du labeur et soi restaurer par bon pain, bon vin, bonnes viandes, puis soi quelque peu ébaudir[4], coucher et reposer, pour, au lendemain, être frais et allègres au labeur, comme devant. » Ainsi font les fauconniers. Quand ils ont pu[5] leurs oiseaux, ils ne les font voler sur leurs gorges[6] : ils les laissent enduire[7] sur la perche. Ce que très bien entendit le bon pape, premier instituteur des jeûnes. Il ordonna qu’on jeûnât jusques à l’heure de Nones, le reste du jour fut mis en liberté de repaître.","""Nature has made the day to exercise herself, to work and go about each in her negotiation, and, for this more aptly to do, she provides us with candlelight: it is the clear and joyful light of the sun. In the evening, she begins to tollir[2] us and tells us tacitly: “Children, you are good people, that’s enough work. The night comes: it is advisable to stop[3] from labor and to restore oneself with good bread, good wine, good meats, then to oneself somewhat amaze[4], to lie down and rest, in order, the next day, to be fresh and cheerful at work, as in front. So do falconers. When they have been able to [5] their birds, they do not make them fly on their throats [6]: they let them coat [7] on the pole. What the good pope, first teacher of fasts, heard very well. He ordered that we fast until the hour of Nones, the rest of the day was free to feed.","‘Nature has made the day for Man to do things, to toil, to work every one in his vocation. So that we can do it more fittingly she has furnished us with a candle: the bright and happy light of the Sun. At eventide Nature begins to withdraw from us and tacitly says to us: “You are good folk, my children. You have toiled enough. The night is coming: it is right to cease your labours and to restore your strength with good bread, good wine and good viands, to enjoy yourselves for a while, to lie down and rest so as to be fresh and eager for work on the morrow as before.” ‘Falconers do just that. Once they have fed their birds they do not make them fly on full stomachs. They allow them time to digest on their perches. ‘That was perfectly understood by the good pope who first instituted fasting. He ordained that one should fast until the hour of Nones; the rest of the day was left free for feeding.","That Lady made the Day for Exercise, to travel, work, wait on and labour in each his Negotiation and Employment; and that we may with the more Fervency and Ardour prosecute our business, she sets before us a clear burning Candle, to wit, the Suns Resplendency: And at Night, when she begins to take the Light from us, she thereby tacitly implies no less, than if she would have spoken thus unto us: My Lads and Lasses, all of you are good and honest Folks, you have wrought well to day, toiled and turmoiled enough, the Night approacheth, therefore cast off these moiling Cares of yours, desist from all your swinking painful Labours, and set your Minds how to refresh your Bodies in the renewing of their Vigour with good Bread, choice Wine, and store of wholsom Meats; then may you take some Sport and Recreation, and after that lie down and rest your selves, that you may strongly, nimbly, lustily, and with the more Alacrity to morrow attend on your Affairs as formerly. Falconers in like manner, when they have fed their Hawks, will not suffer them to fly on a full Gorge, but let them on a Pearch abide a little, that they may rouse, bait, tour and soar the better. That good Pope, who was the first Instituter of Fasting, understood this well enough; for he ordained that our Fast should reach but to the hour of Noon; all the remainder of that day was at our disposure, freely to eat and feed at any time thereon."
"Eux tenants ces menus propos de beuverie, Gargamelle commença se porter mal du bas ; dont Grandgousier se leva dessus l’herbe et la réconfortait honnêtement, pensant que ce fût mal d’enfant, et lui disant qu’elle s’était là herbée sous la Saulsaie, et qu’en bref elle ferait pieds neufs. Par ce, lui convenait prendre courage nouveau, au nouvel avènement de son poupon, et, encore que la douleur lui fût quelque peu en fâcherie, toutefois que icelle serait brève, et la joie, qui tôt succéderait, lui tollirait[1] tout cet ennui, en sorte que seulement ne lui en resterait la souvenance : « Je le prouve, disait-il.

By this, it suited him to take new courage, at the new advent of his baby, and, although the pain was somewhat angry to him, however that it would be brief, and the joy, which soon would follow, would tollir[1] all this boredom, so that he would only remember it: ""I prove it,"" he said. Our Savior says in the Gospel Joannis XVI: “The woman who is at the hour of her childbirth is sad, but when she has given birth, she does not remember any of her anguish. »","Erasmus had shown that faith is not credulity. Faith, in the Greek original of Hebrews II:I, is trust, trust in ‘the evidence of things unseen (in God and his promises). Mary did not at first trust the angel Gabriel: ‘How can these things be?’ Told of the conception of Elizabeth with its echoes of Sarah’s conception of Isaac, she was reminded that ‘with God nothing is ever impossible’, cited in this chapter from Luke 1:37, echoing Genesis 8. That is the punch-line of this chapter, which remains joyful from start to finish. The texts amusingly cited from Proverbs 14 and I Corinthians 13 to defend credulity mean very different things in context. Rabelais made the prudential cuts shown in the notes.

"« Épitherses, père d’Æmilian, rhéteur, naviguant de Grèce en Italie dedans une nef chargée de diverses marchandises et plusieurs voyagers, sur le soir, cessant le vent auprès des îles Echinades, lesquelles sont entre la Morée et Tunis, fut leur nef portée près de Paxes. Étant là abordée, aucuns[1] des voyagers dormants, autres veillants, autres buvants et soupants, fut de l’île de Paxes ouïe une voix de quelqu’un qui hautement appelait « Thamoun ». Auquel cri tous furent épouvantés. Cetui Thamoun était leur pilote natif d’Égypte, mais non connu de nom, fors à quelques-uns des voyagers. Fut secondement ouïe cette voix, laquelle appelait « Thamoun » en cris horrifiques. Personne ne répondant, mais tous restants en silence et trépidation, en tierce fois cette voix fut ouïe plus terrible que devant. Dont advint que Thamous répondit : « Je suis ici, que me demandes-tu ? que veux-tu que je fasse ? » Lors fut icelle voix plus hautement ouïe, lui disant et commandant, quand il serait en Palodes, publier et dire que Pan, le grand dieu, était mort. Cette parole entendue, disait Épitherses, tous les nochers et voyagers s’être ébahis et grandement effrayés, et entre eux délibérants quel serait meilleur ou taire ou publier ce qu’avait été commandé, dit Thamous son avis être, ad venant que lors ils eussent vent en poupe, passer outre sans mot dire, ad venant qu’il fut calme en mer, signifier ce qu’il avait ouï. Quand donc furent près Palodes, advint qu’ils n’eurent ni vent ni courant, Adonc Thamous montant en prore[2], et en terre projetant sa vue, dit, ainsi que lui était commandé, que Pan le grand était mort. Il n’avait encore achevé le dernier mot, quand furent entendus grands soupirs, grandes lamentai ions et effrois en terre, non d’une personne seule, mais de plusieurs ensemble. Cette nouvelle (parce que plusieurs avaient été présents) fut ’bientôt divulguée en Rome, et envoya Tibère César, lors empereur en Rome, quérir cetui Thamous, et, l’avoir[3] entendu parler, ajouta foi à ses paroles, et se guémentant[4] ès gens doctes, qui pour lors étaient en sa cour et en Rome en bon nombre, qui était cetui Pan, trouva par leur rapport qu’il avait été fils de Mercure et de Pénélope. Ainsi auparavant l’avaient écrit Hérodote, et Cicéronon[5] tiers livre De la Nature des dieux. Toutefois je l’interpréterais de celui grand Servateur[6] des fidèles, qui fut en Judée ignominieusement occis par l’envie et iniquité des pontifes, docteurs, prêtres et moines de la loi mosaïque, et ne me semble l’interprétation abhorrente[7], car à bon droit peut-il être en langage grégeois[8] dit Pan, vu qu’il est le nôtre. Tout, tout ce que sommes, tout ce que vivons, tout ce qu’avons, tout ce qu’espérons est lui, en lui, de lui, par lui. C’est le bon Pan, le grand pasteur qui, comme atteste le berger passionné Corydon, non seulement a en amour et affection ses brebis, mais aussi ses bergers, à la mort duquel furent plaintes, soupirs, effrois et lamentations en toute la machine de l’univers, cieux, terre, mer, enfers. À cette mienne interprétation compète[9] le temps, car cetui très bon, très grand Pan, notre unique Servateur, mourut lez Jérusalem, régnant en Rome Tibère César. »","""Epitherses, father of Æmilian, rhetorician, sailing from Greece to Italy in a ship loaded with various goods and several travelers, in the evening, ceasing the wind near the Echinades Islands, which are between the Morea and Tunis, was their ship carried near Paxes. Being approached there, none [1] of the travelers sleeping, others watching, others drinking and supping, was from the island of Paxes heard a voice of someone who loudly called ""Thamoun"". At which cry all were terrified. Cetui Thamoun was their pilot, a native of Egypt, but not known by name to some of the travelers. Secondly was heard this voice, which called ""Thamoun"" in horrific cries. Nobody answering, but all remaining in silence and trepidation, in third time this voice was heard more terrible than before. From which it happened that Thamous answered: ""I am here, what do you ask of me?"" what do you want me to do ? Then was that voice most loudly heard, telling him and commanding, when he was in Palodes, to publish and say that Pan, the great god, was dead. This word heard, said Epitherses, all the drivers and travelers were amazed and greatly frightened, and deliberating among themselves what would be better either to conceal or to publish what had been commanded, said Thamus his opinion to be, if they had then wind in the sails, pass without saying a word, should he be calm at sea, signify what he had heard. When therefore they were near Palodes, there came to pass that they had neither wind nor current, So Thamus ascending in prore[2], and projecting his sight into the land, said, as he was commanded, that Pan the great was dead. He had not yet finished the last word, when great sighs, great lamentations and terrors were heard on the ground, not from one person alone, but from several together. This news (because many had been present) was 'soon divulged in Rome, and sent Tiberius Caesar, then Emperor in Rome, to fetch this Thamous, and, having [3] heard him speak, believed his words, and wondering [4] learned people, who at that time were in his court and in Rome in good number, who was this Pan, found by their report that he had been son of Mercury and Penelope. Thus before had written Herodotus, and Ciceronon[5] third book De la Nature des dieux. However, I would interpret it from the great Servant[6] of the faithful, who was ignominiously slain in Judea by the envy and iniquity of the pontiffs, doctors, priests and monks of the Mosaic law, and does not seem to me the abhorrent interpretation[7 ], because with good reason it can be in Greek language[8] says Pan, since it is ours. Everything, everything we are, everything we live, everything we have, everything we hope for is him, in him, from him, through him. It is the good Pan, the great pastor who, as the passionate shepherd Corydon attests, not only has love and affection for his sheep, but also for his shepherds, at whose death were complaints, sighs, terrors and lamentations in the whole machine. of the universe, heaven, earth, sea, hell. According to this interpretation, time is complete [9], for this very good, very great Pan, our only Servant, died in Jerusalem, reigning Tiberius Caesar in Rome. »","Once again Rabelais applies to Christ the title the Most-good, Most-great God, the old title of Jupiter definitively adopted by Christians for God the Father. That is arresting: it normally does not apply to the Son. Cf. the introduction to the Prologue to this Fourth Book.] ‘Epitherses, the father of Aemilian the rhetorician, was sailing from Greece to Italy on a boat conveying a variety of merchandise and several passengers, when, the wind having dropped one evening near the Echinades – which are islands between the Morea and Tunis – their vessel was carried close to Paxos. Having reached the coast (with some of the passengers asleep, others awake, others drinking and dining) from the isle of Paxos there was heard a voice of someone loudly crying, Thamous. At which cry all were struck with terror. Thamous was their pilot; he hailed from Egypt but was not known by name except to a few of the passengers. That voice was heard a second time, calling with a terrifying cry for Thamous. No one answered; all remained silent and deeply perturbed, so the voice was heard a third time, more terrifying than before. To which Thamous did indeed reply: “Here I am. What do you require of me? What do you want me to do?” Whereupon that voice was heard more loudly still, telling him, commanding him, to state and announce when he came to Palodes that Pan, the great god, was dead. Epitherses said that all the seamen and passengers were struck with awe upon hearing those words and were deeply afraid. As they were discussing amongst themselves whether it would be better to suppress what they had been ordered to publish or to announce it, Thamous counselled that if they had a stiff wind astern they should sail straight by without saying a word, but it the sea were calm, to announce what they had heard. ‘Now when they were off Palodes they chanced upon neither wind nor current, so Thamous mounted on to the prow and casting his gaze shorewards, cried as he had been commanded to: that the great Pan was dead. He had not finished the last word when there were heard great sighs, great lamentations and tumultuous cries from the land, not of one solitary person but of many together. ‘News of this soon spread throughout Rome (since many people had been present). Tiberius Caesar, then the Emperor of Rome, sent for that Thamous and, once he had heard what he had to say, believed him. Upon inquiring from the many learned scholars then in his Court and throughout Rome who that Pan was, he discovered from their reports that he was the son of Mercury and Penelope. So had Herodotus written some time before, and Cicero too in the Third Book of On the Nature of the Gods. ‘However, I would interpret Pan as alluding to that Great Servator of the faithful, who was shamefully put to death in Judaea through the envy and iniquity of the Pontiffs, doctors, priests and monks of the Mosaic Law. That interpretation does not seem to me to be incompatible, for in Greek he can rightly be called Pan, seeing that he is our All, all that we are, all that we live, all that we have, all chat we hope, is in him, of him, by him. He is the Good Pan, that Great Shepherd who (as attested by the passionate shepherd Corydon) not only loves and cherishes His lambs but also his shepherds. At whose death were heard plaints, sighs, tumultuous cries and lamentations throughout the entire machine of the Universe: Heaven, earth, sea and Hell. The date is compatible with my interpretation, for that Most-good, Most-great Pan, our Only Servator, died near Jerusalem during the reign in Rome of Tiberius Caesar.’","EPITHERSES the Father of Æmilian the Rhetorician, sailing from Greece to Italy, in a Ship freighted with divers Goods, and Passengers, at night, the wind fail’d ’em near the Echinades, some Islands that lie between the Morea and Tunis, and the Vessel was driven near Paxos. When they were got thither, some of the passengers being asleep, others awake, the rest eating and drinking, a Voice was heard that call’d aloud Thamous; which Cry surpris’d them all. This same Thamous was their Pilot, an Egyptian by Birth, but known by Name only to some few Travellers. The Voice was heard a second time calling Thamous, in a frightful Tone, and none making answer but trembling and remaining silent, the Voice was heard a third time, more dreadful than before. This caus’d Thamous to answer; Here am I, What do’st thou call me for? What wilt thou have me do? Then the Voice louder than before, bad him publish when he should come to Paloda, That the Great God Pan was dead. Epitherses related, that all the Mariners, and Passengers, having heard this, were extreamly amaz’d and frighted; and that consulting among themselves, whether they had best conceal or divulge what the Voice had enjoyn’d Thamous said, his advice was, That if they happen’d to have a fair wind, they should proceed without mentioning a word on ’t; but if they chanc’d to be becalm’d, he wou’d publish what he had heard: Now when they were near Paloda they had no Wind, neither were they in any Current. Thamous then getting up on the top of the Ship’s forecastle, and casting his Eyes on the Shoar, said that he had been commanded to proclaim, that the great God Pan was dead. The words were hardly out of his Mouth, when deep Groans, great Lamentations, and Shrieks, not of one Person, but of many together, were heard from the Land. The News of this, (many being present then) was soon spread at Rome, insomuch that Tiberius, who was then Emperor, sent for this Thamous, and having heard him, gave credit to his words; and inquiring of the Learned in his Court and at Rome, who was that Pan? He found by their relation, that he was the Son of Mercury and Penelope; as Herodotus, and Cicero in his Third Book of the Nature of the Gods, had written before. For my part, I understand it of that Great Saviour of the Faithfull, who was shamefully put to Death at Jerusalem, by the envy and wickedness of the Doctors, Priests, and Monks of the Mosaic Law. And methinks, my Interpretation is not improper; for he may lawfully be said in the Greek Tongue, to be Pan, since he is our All. For all that we are, all that we live, all that we have, all that we hope, is him, by him, from him, and in him; he is the good Pan, the great Shepherd, who, as the loving Sheperd Corydon affirms, hath not only a tender Love and Affection for his Sheep, but also for their Shepherds. At his death, complaints, sighs, fears and lamentations were spread through the whole Fabric of the universe, whether Heaven, Land, Sea, or Hell. The time also concurs with this Interpretation of mine; for this most good, most mighty Pan, our only Saviour, dyed near Jerusalem, during the Reign of Tiberius Cœsar."
"Adonc firent gantelets leur exploit, si qu’à chicanous fut rompue la tête en neuf endroits, à un des recors fut le bras droit défocillé[3], à l’autre fut démanchée la mandibule supérieure, de mode qu’elle lui couvrait le menton à demi avec dénudation de la luette et perte insigne des dents molaires, masticatoires et canines. Au son du tambourin, changeant son intonation, furent les gantelets mussés[4], sans être aucunement aperçus, et confitures multipliées de nouveau, avec liesse nouvelle. Buvants les bons compagnons uns aux autres, et tous à chicanous et à ses recors, Oudart reniait et dépitait[5] les noces, alléguant qu’un des recors lui avait desincornifistibulé toute l’autre épaule. Ce nonobstant, buvait à lui joyeusement. Le recors démantibulé joignait les mains et tacitement lui demandait pardon, car parler ne pouvait-il. Loyre se plaignait de ce que le recors débradé[6] lui avait donné si grand coup de poing sur l’autre coude qu’il en était devenu tout esperruquancluzelubelouzerirelu du talon.","So their feat was made gauntlets, so that at chicanou the head was broken in nine places, at one of the recors the right arm was detangled[3], at the other the upper mandible was dislocated, so that it covered his half chin with denudation of the uvula and significant loss of molar, masticatory and canine teeth. At the sound of the tambourine, changing its intonation, were the gauntlets mused[4], without being in the least noticed, and jams multiplied again, with new jubilation. Drinking the good companions to each other, and all to chicanous and to his recors, Oudart denied and vexed [5] the wedding, alleging that one of the recors had disincornifistibulé him all the other shoulder. This notwithstanding, drank to him happily. The dismantled recors clasped his hands and tacitly asked his forgiveness, for he could not speak. Loyre complained that the recor débradé[6] had punched him so hard on the other elbow that he had become all esperruquancluzelubelouzerirelu with his heel.","Whereupon gauntlets so performed their exploits that Chicanous’ skull was shattered in nine places, one of the bailliffs had his arm put out of joint while the other had his jaw dislocated in such a fashion that it hung half-way down his chin, exposing his uvula and causing a notable loss of his teeth (molars, masticators and canines). ‘When the sound of the tambourine changed its note, gauntlets were hidden without their being in any way noticed. Amidst renewed rejoicing sweetmeats were again brought out in profusion. While all those good companions were all each drinking to each other and to Chicanous and his bailliffs, Oudart was cursing and inveighing against the wedding, alleging that one of the bailliffs had entirely desincornifistibulated his other shoulder, yet he was nevertheless happily drinking to him. The demandibled bailiff clasped his hands together and wordlessly begged forgiveness, being unable to talk. ‘Loyre complained that the bailiff with the shattered arm had given him such a great thwack with his fist on one of his elbows that he had become all maulocrippled-lowerhazarded in his heel.","Then the Tabor beat a point of War, and the Gantlets began to do their Duty, insomuch that the Catchpole had his Crown crack’d in no less than nine places. One of the Bums had his right Arm put out of joint, and the other his upper Jaw-bone or Mandibule dislocated; so that it hid half his Chin, with a denudation of the Uvula and sad loss of the Molar, Masticatory and Canine Teeth. Then the Tabor beat a Retreat; the Gantlets were carefully hid in a trice, and sweet Meats afresh distributed to renew the Mirth of the Company. So they all drank to one another, and especially to the Catchpole and his Bums. But Oudart Curs’d and Damn’d the Wedding to the pit of Hell, complaining that one of the Bums had utterly disincornifistibulated his nether Shoulder blade. Nevertheless he scorn’d to be thought a Flincher, and made shift to tope to him on the square. The Jawless Bum shrug’d up his Shoulders, join’d his Hands, and by signs beg’d his Pardon ; for speak he could not. The sham Bridegroom made his moan, That the crippled Bum had struck him such a horrid thump with his Shoulder-of-Mutton-Fist on the nether Elbow, that he was grown quite esperruquanchuzelubelouzerireliced down to his very Heel, to the no small loss of Mistress Bride."

"Davantage[6], vu que en certains couvents de ce monde est en usance que si femme aucune y entre (j’entends des prudes et pudiques), on nettoie la place par laquelle elles ont passé, fut ordonné que si religieux ou religieuses y entrait par cas fortuit, on nettoierait curieusement[7] tous les lieux par lesquels auraient passé, et parce que ès religions de ce monde tout compassé, limité et réglé par heures, fut décrété que là ne serait horloge, ni cadran aucun. Mais, selon les occasions et opportunités, seraient toutes les œuvres dispensées : « Car, disait Gargantua, la plus vraie perte du temps qu’il sût était de compter les heures. Quel bien en vient-il ? et la plus grande rêverie[8] du monde était soi gouverner au son d’une cloche, et non au dicté[9] de bon sens et entendement. »","More [6], since in certain convents of this world it is customary that if any woman enters there (I mean prudish and modest), the place by which they have passed is cleaned, it was ordered that if monk or nun there entered by fortuitous event, one would clean curiously [7] all the places by which would have passed, and because in the religions of this world all stuffed, limited and regulated by hours, it was decreed that there would be no clock, no dial. But, according to the occasions and opportunities, would be all the works exempted: “For, said Gargantua, the truest waste of time that he knew was to count the hours. What good does it come from? and the greatest reverie[8] of the world was to govern oneself by the sound of a bell, and not by the dictation[9] of common sense and understanding. »","‘To go on,’ said Gargantua: ‘seeing that in certain convents in our world the practice is to clean the places passed through by any women who come in – decent women, I mean, and modest – here it was decreed that, should any monk or nun happen to come in, they would scour clean all the places they might have passed through. ‘And because in the religious Orders of our world everything is circumscribed, delimited and ruled by Hours, it was decreed that not one clock nor sundial should be there, but that all their activities should be arranged according to whatever was fit or opportune; for Gargantua used to say that the greatest waste of time that he knew was to watch the clock – what good ever came of it? – and that there was no greater lunacy in the world than to rule your life by the sound of a bell and not according to the dictates of good sense and intelligence.","Moreover, seeing there are certaine convents in the world, whereof the custome is, if any woman come in (I mean chaste and honest women) they immediately sweep the ground which they have trod upon; therefore was it ordained that if any man or woman entered into religious orders, should by chance come within this new Abbey, all the roomes should be throughly washed and cleansed through which they had passed; and because in all other Monasteries and Nunneries all is compassed, limited, and regulated by houres , it was decreed that in this new structure there should be neither Clock nor Dial, but that according to the opportunities, and incident occasions, all their hours should be disposed of; for (said Gargantua) The greatest losse of time that I know, is to count the hours, what good comes of it? now can there be any greater dotage in the world, then for one to guide and direct his courses by the sound of a Bell, and not by his owne judgement and discretion."

Trust me, and your own Reason, that the loss of Osiris was not so regreatable to Isis; nor did Venus so deplore the Death of Adonis; nor yet did Hercules so bewail the straying of Hylas; nor was the Rapt of Polyxena more throbbingly resented and condoled by Pyramus and Hecuba, then this aforesaid Accident would be sympathetically bemoaned, grievous, ruthful and anxious to the wofully desolate and disconsolate Parents."

To judge of the perfection of Debtors by the Numerosity of their Creditors, is the readiest way for entring into the Mysteries of Practical Arithmetick. You can hardly imagine how glad I am, when every Morning I perceive my self environed and surrounded with Brigades of Creditors; humble, fawning, and full of their Reverences: And whilst I remark, that as I look more favourably upon, and give a chearfuller Countenance to one than to another, the Fellow there-upon buildeth a Conceit that he shall be the first Dispatched, and the foremost in the Date of Payment; and he valueth my Smiles at the rate of ready Money.

Il demanda seulement un joueur de farces, lequel il avait vu on théâtre, et, n’entendant ce qu’il disait, entendait ce qu’il exprimait par signes et gesticulations, alléguant que, sous sa domination, étaient peuples de divers langages, pour esquels[8] répondre et parler lui convenait user de plusieurs truchements : il seul à tous suffirait, car, en matière de signifier par gestes, était tant excellent qu’il semblait parler des doigts. Pourtant, vous faut choisir un muet sourd de nature, afin que ses gestes et signes vous soient naïvement prophétiques, non feints, fardés, ni affectés. Reste encore savoir si tel avis voulez ou d’homme ou de femme prendre.","""I have read [6] more, as a learned and elegant author, that Tyridates, king of Armenia, in the time of Nero, visited Rome, and was received with honorable solemnity and magnificent pomp, in order to maintain it in eternal friendship. of the Roman senate and people, and there was nothing memorable in the city that was not shown and exposed to him. To his department[7], the Emperor gave him large and excessive gifts; Besides, he made him the option of choosing what more in Rome he liked, with a sworn promise not to turn him away, whatever he asked. He only asked for a prankster, whom he had seen in the theatre, and, not hearing what he said, heard what he expressed by signs and gesticulations, alleging that under his domination there were peoples of various languages, for whom[8] to answer and to speak suited him to use several intermediaries: he alone would suffice, for, in the matter of signifying by gestures, he was so excellent that he seemed to speak with his fingers. However, you must choose a deaf mute by nature, so that his gestures and signs are naively prophetic to you, not feigned, made up, or affected. It remains to be seen whether such advice is wanted or of a man or a woman to take.","‘I have also read in a learned and elegant author how Tiridates, the king of Armenia in the time of Nero, visited Rome and was received with solemn honours and magnificent ceremonies aimed at binding him in a sempiternal friendship to the Roman Senate and People; there was nothing worthy of attention which was not then shown and displayed to him. At his departure the Emperor bestowed on him great and surpassing gifts and further gave him the option of choosing whatever best pleased him in Rome, with a sworn undertaking not to deny him anything he asked for. But he merely asked for one of the players in the farces whom he had seen in the theatre. He had never understood a word he said, yet he had understood what he had conveyed by signs and gesticulations, adding that within his dominions there were peoples of a variety of tongues, requiring several interpreters to reply to them and address them, yet that one actor would suffice for them all, for he was so outstanding at communicating by gesture that he seemed to talk with his fingers. ‘You ought therefore to choose a mute who is deaf by nature so that his gestures and signs may be naturally prophetic, not feigned, falsified or affected. ‘There remains for us to know whether you prefer to take such advice from a man or a woman.’","I have read, I remember also, in a very literate and eloquent Author, that Turidates King of Armenia, in the days of Nero, made a Voyage to Rome, where he was received with great Honour and Solemnity, and with all manner of Pomp and Magnificence: Yea, to the end there might be a sempiternal Amity and Correspondence preserved betwixt him and the Roman Senate; there was no remarkable thing in the whole City which was not shown unto him. At his Departure the Emperor bestowed upon him many ample Donatives of an inestimable Value: And besides, the more entirely to testifie his Affection towards him, heartily intrusted him to be pleased to make choice of any whatsoever thing in Rome was most agreeable to his Fancy; with a Promise juramentally confirmed, That he should not be refused of his Demand. Thereupon, after a suitable Return of Thanks for a so gracious Offer, he required a certain Jack-pudding, whom he had seen to act his part most egregiously upon the Stage, and whose meaning (albeit he knew not what it was he had spoken) he understood perfectly enough by the Signs and Gesticulations which he had made. And for this Suit of his, in that he asked nothing else, he gave this Reason, That in the several wide and spacious Dominions, which were reduced under the Sway and Authority of his Sovereign Government, there were sundry Countries and Nations much differing from one another in Language, with whom, whether he was to speak unto them, or give any Answer to their Requests, he was always necessitated to make use of divers sorts of Truchmen and Interpreters: Now with this Man alone, sufficient for supplying all their places, will that great Inconveniency hereafter be totally removed; seeing he is such a fine Gesticulator, and in the Practice of Chirology an Artist so compleat, expert and dextrous, that with his very Fingers he doth speak. Howsoever you are to pitch upon such a dumb Bone as is deaf by Nature, and from his Birth; to the end that his Gestures and Signs may be the more vively and truly Prophetick, and not counterfeit by the intermixture of some adulterate Lustre and Affectation. Yet whether this dumb Person shall be of the Male or Female Sex is in your Option, lieth at your Discretion, and altogether dependeth on your own Election."
"Ledit bâtiment était cent fois plus magnifique que n’est Bonivet, ni Chambourg[13], ni Chantilly ; car en icelui étaient neuf mille trois cents trente et deux chambres, chacune garnie d’arrière-chambre, cabinet, garde-robe, chapelle, et issue en une grande salle.

In each rest were two beautiful arches of antique, by which was received the light, and through them one entered a cabinet made with a slatted way, of width of the said screw, and went up to above the cover, and there ended in pavilion.

In the middle of the main structure, between each tower, stood an inner spiral staircase. The steps were [partly of porphyry, partly of Numidian stone, and partly] of serpentine marble, twenty-two-foot long and three fingers thick, arranged in flights of twelve between each landing. On each of the landings were two handsome classical-style arcades which let in the light; through them one entered into a loggia, with lattice-work gratings as wide as the staircase itself which, mounting to the main roof, terminated in a slightly raised pavilion. The stairs led on either side to a great hall and through rooms into the chambers.","This same building was a hundred times more sumptuous and magnificent then ever was Bonnivet, Chambourg or Chantillie; for there were in it nine thousand, three hundred and two and thirty chambers, every one whereof had a withdrawing room, a handsom closet, a wardrobe, an oratory, and neat passage, leading into a great and spacious hall. Between every tower, in the midst of the said body of building, there was a paire of winding (such as we now call lantern) staires, whereof the steps were part of Porphyrie, (which is a dark red marble, spotted with white,) part of Numidian stone, (which is a kinde of yellowishly streaked marble upon various colours,) and part of Serpentine marble, (with light spots on a dark green ground) each of those steps being two and twenty foot in length, and three fingers thick, and the just number of twelve betwixt every rest, or, (as we now terme it) landing place. In every resting place were two faire antick arches where the light came in: and by those they went into a Cabinet, made even with and of the bredth of the said winding, and the re-ascending above the roofs of the house, ended conically in a pavillion: By that vize or winding, they entered on every side into a great hall, and from the halls into the chambers; from the Arctick tower unto the Criere, were the faire great libraries in Greek, Latine, Hebrew, French, Italian and Spanish, respectively distributed in their several cantons, according to the diversity of these languages."

"Adonc nous dit Homenas : « Jadis fut aux Juifs la loi par Moses baillée écrite des doigts propres de Dieu. En Delphes devant la face du temple d’Apollo fut trouvée cette sentence divinement écrite : ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ. ‘Et par certain laps de temps après fut vue El aussi divinement écrite et transmise des cieux. Le simulacre de Cybèle fut des cieux en Phrygie transmis on[5] champ nommé Pésinunt. Aussi fut en Tauris le simulacre de Diane, si croyez Euripides. L’oriflambe[6] fut des cieux transmise aux nobles et très christians rois de France, pour combattre les infidèles. Régnant Numa Pompilius, roi second des Romains en Rome, fut du ciel vu descendre le tranchant bouclier dit Ancile. En Acropolis d’Athènes jadis tomba du ciel empyrée la statue de Minerve. Ici semblablement voyez les sacrées décrétales écrites de la main d’un ange chérubin. Vous autres, gens transpontins, ne le croirez pas ?","So Homenas tells us: “Once was to the Jews the law by Moses yawned written with the clean fingers of God. In Delphi in front of the temple of Apollo was found this divinely written sentence: ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ. ‘And after a certain period of time El also was seen divinely written and handed down from heaven. The simulacrum of Cybele was transmitted from the skies in Phrygia to a field called Pésinunt. Also in Tauris was the simulacrum of Diana, if you believe Euripides. The oriflambe[6] was transmitted from heaven to the noble and very Christian kings of France, to fight the infidels. Reigning Numa Pompilius, second king of the Romans in Rome, was seen descending from heaven the sharp shield called Ancile. In the Acropolis of Athens once fell from the empyrean sky the statue of Minerva. Here likewise see the sacred decretals written by the hand of a cherubic angel. You people, Transpontine people, won't believe it?","Whereupon Homenaz said to us: ‘Long ago the Law of Moses was given to the Jews, inscribed by the very fingers of God. At Delphi, on the façade of the temple of Apollo, this maxim was discovered divinely inscribed, KNOW THYSELF. ‘Then after a certain lapse of time the word EI was found thus divinely inscribed and sent down from the heavens. ‘The image of Cybele was sent down from the heavens to a field in Phrygia called Pesinunt; so too (if you trust Euripides) was the image of Diana in Taurus. ‘The oriflamme was sent down from the heavens to the nobility and Most-Christian Kings of France for their fight against the Infidel. During the reign of Numa Pompilius, the second King of the Romans, ancile (the sharp-edged buckler) was seen coming down in Rome from the heavens. ‘Long ago the statue of Minerva fell down from heaven into the Acropolis at Athens. ‘And here, likewise, you can see the holy Decretals written by the hand of an angel called Cherubim. You folk from beyond the sea won’t believe that…’","Homenas then said to us, The Law was formerly given to the Jews by Moses, written by God himself; at Delphos before the Portal of Apollo’s Temple, this Sentence, ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ, was found written with a Divine Hand, and sometime after it was also seen, and as Divinely written and transmitted from Heaven. Cybele’s Shrine was brought out of Heaven into a Field, call’d Penisunt in Phrygia; so was that of Diana to Tauris, if you will believe Euripides; the Oriflambe, or Holy Standard was transmitted out of Heaven to the Noble and most Christian Kings of France to fight against the Unbelievers. In the Reign of Numa Pompilius, second King of the Romans, the famous Copper Buckler call’d Ancile was seen to descend from Heaven. At Acropolis near Athens, Minerva’s Statue formerly fell from the Empyreal Heaven. In like manner, the sacred Decretals, which you see, were written with the hand of an Angel of the Cherubin-kind; you Outlandish People will hardly believe this, I fear."

"Leurs buvettes souvent réitérées, chacun se retira en sa nef, et en bonne heure firent voile au vent grec levant, selon lequel le pilote principal, nommé Jamet Brayer, avait désigné la route et dressé la calamite[26] de toutes les boussoles. Car l’avis sien, et de Xénomanes aussi, fut, vu que l’oracle de la dive Bacbuc était près le Catay en Indie[27] supérieure, ne prendre la route ordinaire des Portugalais, lesquels, passants la ceinture ardente[28] et le cap de Bona Speranza sur la pointe méridionale d’Afrique, outre[29] l’équinoxial, et perdant la vue et guide de l’aisseuil[30] septentrional, font navigation énorme, ains[31] suivre au plus près le parallèle de ladite Indie et girer[32] autour d’icelui pôle par occident, de manière que, tournoyants sous septentrion, l’eussent en pareille élévation comme il est au port d’Olonne, sans plus en approcher, de peur d’entrer et d’être retenus en la mer Glaciale, et suivant ce canonique[33] détour par même parallèle, l’eussent à dextre, vers le levant, qui au département[34] leur était à senestre.","Their refreshments often repeated, each withdrew to his own nave, and in good time set sail to the rising Greek wind, according to which the principal pilot, named Jamet Brayer, had designated the route and drawn up the calamity[26] of all compasses. For the advice of his, and of Xenomania also, was, seeing that the oracle of the divine Bacbuc was near the Catay in Upper India[27], not to take the ordinary route of the Portuguese, who, passing the burning belt[28] and Cape Bona Speranza on the southern tip of Africa, beyond[29] the equinoctial, and losing sight and guide of the northern armpit[30], make enormous navigation, thus[31] following as closely as possible the parallel of the said Indie and turn[32] around it pole by west, so that, turning under north, had it in the same elevation as it is at the port of Olonne, without approaching it any further, for fear of entering and to be retained in the Glacial Sea, and following this canonical[33] detour by the same parallel, had it to the dexter, towards the east, which in the department[34] was to them on the left.","After drinking toast after toast, every man returned to his ship; in due time, they spread their sails to an east – ‘Greek’ – wind, in accordance with which their principal navigator, Jamet Brayer, had plotted their course and set the needles of all their compasses. For, seeing that the oracle of the Dive Bacbuc lies in Upper India, hard by Cathay, his advice and that of Xenomanes was not to follow the usual route of the Portuguese who, by crossing the Torrid Zone, rounding the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa beyond the equatorial line and losing all sight and guidance of the Pole Star, make an enormous journey of it, but rather to stick as close as possible to the same parallel as India and sail westward round the pole so that, curving along beneath the North Star, they would keep it at the same elevation as it has at the port of Les Sables-d’Olonne (drawing no nearer for fear of entering the Sea of Ice and being trapped), following that regular curve along the same parallel so that when sailing eastwards they would keep it to starboard, having had it to larboard on their departure.","Having often renewed their Tiplings, each Mother’s Son retired on board his own Ship, and set Sail all so fast with a merry Gale at South East, to which point of the Compass the Chief Pilot, James Brayer by Name, had shap’d his Course, and fixt all things accordingly. For seeing that the Oracle of the Holy Bottle lay near Catay, in the upper India, his advice and that of Xenomanes also, was, not to steer the Course which the Portuguese use, while sayling through the Torrid Zone, and Cape Bona Speranza at the South Point of Africk beyond the Equinoctial Line, and losing sight of the Northern Pole their Guide, they make a prodigious long Voyage; but rather to keep as near the Parallel of the said India as possible, and to tack to the Westard of the said Pole, so that winding under the North, they might find themselves in the Latitude of the Port of Olone, without coming nearer it, for fear of being shut up in the Frozen Sea; whereas following this Canonical Turn by the said Parallel, they must have that on the right to the Eastward, which at their departure was on their left."
"Issant de l’eau, raidement montait encontre la montagne, et dévalait aussi franchement, gravait[43] ès arbres comme un chat, sautait de l’une en l’autre comme un écurieux[44], abattait les gros rameaux comme un autre Milo ; avec deux poignards acérés et deux poinçons éprouvés, montait au haut d’une maison comme un rat, descendait puis du haut en bas en telle composition des membres que de la chute n’était aucunement grevé[45]. Jetait le dard, la barre, la pierre, la javeline, l’épieu, la hallebarde, enfonçait[46] l’arc, bandait ès reins les fortes arbalètes de passe, visait de l’arquebuse à l’œil, affûtait le canon, tirait à la butte, au papegai, du bas en mont, d’amont en val, devant, de côté, en arrière comme les Parthes.","Issuing from the water, climbed steeply against the mountain, and descended as frankly, carved [43] trees like a cat, jumped from one to another like a squirrel, [44] felled the big branches like another Milo; with two sharp daggers and two proven awls, climbed to the top of a house like a rat, then descended from top to bottom in such a composition of limbs that the fall was in no way burdened[45]. Threw the dart, the bar, the stone, the javelin, the spear, the halberd, plunged [46] the bow, stretched the loins of the strong crossbows, aimed the arquebus at the eye, sharpened the barrel , shot at the mound, at the papegai, from the bottom to the mountain, from the upstream to the valley, in front, on the side, behind like the Parthians.","Coming straight out of the water, he would dash up a steep mountain and as readily come down again, climb up into trees like a cat, leap from tree to tree like a squirrel and hack down great branches like a second Milo. By means of two keen-pointed daggers and two reliable marlinspikes he would clamber up on to the roof of a house like a rat and then leap off it, so composing his limbs that he was in no wise hurt by the fall. He would hurl the spear, the weight, the stone, the javelin, the stake, and the halbert, bend tight the bow and put his back into readying the great rack-bent cross-bows by the strength of his thighs; he would aim the harquebus, set up the cannon and shoot at the butts and the target-parrots upwards from below, downwards from above, straight ahead, from the side, and finally behind him like the Parthians.","Coming out of the water, he ran furiously up against a hill, and with the same alacrity and swiftnesse ran down again; he climbed up at trees like a cat; and leaped from the one to the other like a squirrel: he did pull down the great boughes and branches, like another Milo; then with two sharp well-steeled daggers, and two tried bodkins, would he run up by the wall to the very top of a house like a cat; then suddenly came down from the top to the bottom, with such an even composition of members, that by the fall he would catch no harme. He did cast the dart, throw the barre, put the stone, practise the javelin, the boar-spear or partisan, and the halbard; he broke the strongest bowes in drawing, bended against his breast the greatest crosse-bowes of steele, took his aime by the eye with the hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and planted the Canon, shot at but-marks, at the papgay from below upwards, or to a height; from above downwards, or to a descent, then before him, sidewise, and behinde him, like the Parthians."

"J’y reconnus, entre les rochers, le bon vieux chemin de la Ferrate[7] sur le mont d’un grand ours. Le voyant de loin me souvint de saint Jérôme en peinture, si son ours eût été lion, car il était tout mortifié, avait la longue barbe toute blanche et mal peignée (vous eussiez proprement dit que fussent glaçons), avait sur soi force grosses patenôtres de pinastre[8] mal rabotées, et était comme à genoillons[9], et non debout ne couché du tout, et se battait la poitrine avec grosses et rudes pierres. Il nous fit peur et pitié ensemble. Le regardant, nous tira à part un bachelier[10] courant du pays, et, montrant un chemin bien lissé, tout blanc et quelque peu feutré de paille, nous dit : « Dorénavant ne déprisez[11] l’opinion de Thalès Milésien, disant l’eau être de toutes choses le commencement, ni la sentence d’Homère, affirmant toutes choses prendre naissance de l’océan. Ce chemin que voyez naquit d’eau, et s’y en retournera : devant deux mois les bateaux par ci passaient, à cette heure y passent les charrettes.","I recognized there, between the rocks, the good old path to La Ferrate[7] on the mount of a great bear. Seeing him from afar, I remembered Saint Jerome in painting, if his bear had been a lion, for he was quite mortified, had a long beard, all white and badly combed (you would have properly said that they were icicles), had on him many fat paternosters. of pinastre[8] badly planed, and was as if on his knees[9], and not standing nor lying down at all, and was beating his chest with large and rough stones. He made us fear and pity together. Looking at him, a bachelor [10] running in the country pulled us aside, and, pointing to a well-smoothed path, all white and somewhat felted with straw, said to us: ""Henceforth do not despise [11] the opinion of Thales Milesian, saying water to be the beginning of all things, nor Homer's sentence, saying all things arise from the ocean. This path that you see was born of water, and will return to it: before two months the boats here passed, at this hour the carts pass there.","I also recognized between the cliffs that good old road of La Ferrate, which clambers over the Grand-Ours. Looking at him from afar I was reminded of Saint Jerome in a painting, but with a bear not a lion, for he was all hoary with a long, white, ill-combed beard: you could rightly have said they were icicles. He wore a great many rough pine-wood rosaries and was as though propped up on his knees, neither standing nor entirely lying down; and he was beating his bosom with great rugged rocks. We were moved to simultaneous fear and pity. While we were looking at him, a Bachelor of Arts and giver of courses took us aside, showed us a very smooth road, completely white, which was lightly strewn with straw, and said: ‘From this time forth do not despise the opinion of Thales of Miletus, who said that water was the beginning of all things, nor the judgement of Homer affirming that all things have their births in the ocean: the road you see here was born of water and to water it will return. Two months ago boats travelled along here, now wagons do.’","Dixi, I have done. You may descant on the Institution of Lent as much as you please, cry’d Epistemon; So many Men, so many Minds: But certainly all the Physicians will be against its being suppresst, tho’ I think that time is at hand , I know they will, and have heard ’em say, Were it not for Lent, their Art would soon fall into Contempt, and they’d get nothing, for hardly any Body would be sick."

"Mais Pantagruel lui dit qu’il ne boirait que trop sans cela. Adonc nous conduit en un grand et délicieux réfectoire et nous dit : « L’ermite Braguibus vous a fait jeûner par quatre jours, quatre jours serez ici à contrepoints sans cesser de boire et de repaître.","But Pantagruel told him that he would drink only too much without it. So he leads us to a large and delicious refectory and says to us: “The hermit Braguibus made you fast for four days, four days will be here at counterpoints without ceasing to drink and eat.","But Pantagruel told him that he would drink all too much without any of that. Whereupon the Aedituus conducted us to a spacious and delightful refectory and said: ‘Braguibus the hermit made you fast for four days: here, to balance things up, you shall eat and feed for four days without ceasing.’","But Pantagruel told him, that he could Drink but too much without that: He then led us into a spacious delicate Refectuary, or Fratrie-room, and told us, Braguibus the Hermit made you Fast Four days together; now, contrarywise, I’ll make you Eat and Drink of the Best, four Days through-stitch before you budge from this place."
"« Maintenant toutes disciplines sont restituées, les langues instaurées[16] : grecque, sans laquelle c’est honte qu’une personne se dise savant ; hébraïque, chaldaïque, latine. Les impressions Tant élégantes et correctes en usance[17] qui ont été inventées de mon âge par inspiration divine, comme, à contre-fil, l’artillerie par suggestion diabolique. Tout le monde est plein de gens savants, de précepteurs très doctes, de librairies[18] très amples, qu’il m’est avis que ni au temps de Platon, ni de Cicéron, ni de Papinien, n’était telle commodité d’étude qu’on y voit maintenant, et ne se faudra plus dorénavant trouver en place ni en compagnie, qui ne sera bien expoli[19] en l’officinede Minerve. Je vois les brigands, les bourreaux, les aventuriers, les palefreniers de maintenant plus doctes que les docteurs et prêcheurs de mon temps.","“Now all disciplines have been restored, the languages established [16]: Greek, without which it is shameful for a person to call himself a scholar; Hebrew, Chaldaic, Latin. The impressions So elegant and correct in use[17] which were invented of my age by divine inspiration, like, against the grain, artillery by diabolical suggestion. Everybody is full of learned people, very learned tutors, very ample bookshops[18], that I think that neither in the time of Plato, nor of Cicero, nor of Papinian, was such a convenience to study that we see there now, and will no longer need to be found in place or in company, which will not be expoliated[19] in the Minerva pharmacy. I see the brigands, the executioners, the adventurers, the grooms of now more learned than the doctors and preachers of my time.","The inner parts of the building above that court were raised up on pillars of chalcedony and porphyry, with beautiful ancient-style arches, within which were beautiful galleries, long and spacious, decorated with wall-paintings as well as with the horns of stags, [unicorns and hippopotamuses, with elephant tusks] and other objects of note.","Now is it that the mindes of men are qualified with all manner of discipline, and the old sciences revived, which for many ages were extinct: now it is, that the learned languages are to their pristine purity restored, viz. Greek, (without which a man may be ashamed to account himself a scholar,) Hebrew, Arabick, Chaldœan and Latine. Printing likewise is now in use, so elegant, and so correct, that better cannot be imagined, although it was found out but in my time by divine inspiration, as by a diabolical suggestion on the other side was the invention of Ordnance. All the world is full of knowing men, of most learned Schoolmasters, and vast Libraries: and it appears to me as a truth, that neither in Plato’s time, nor Cicero’s, nor Papinian’s, there was ever such conveniency for studying, as we see at this day there is: nor must any adventure henceforward to come in publick, or present himself in company, that hath not been pretty well polished in the shop of Minerva: I see robbers, hangmen, freebooters, tapsters, ostlers, and such like, of the very rubbish of the people, more learned now, then the Doctors and Preachers were in my time."

"J’y considérai diligentement la mode et accoutrement de la lanterne polymixe, de Martial, encore plus de l’icosimixe, jadis consacrée par Canope, fille de Tisias. J’y notai très bien la lanterne pensile, jadis prise de Thèbes au temple d’Apollo Palatin et depuis transportée en la ville de Cyme Aolique par Alexandre le Conquérant. J’en notai une autre insigne, à cause d’un beau floc de soie cramoisine qu’elle avait sur la tête. Et me fut dit que c’était Bartole, lanterne de droit. J’en notai pareillement deux autres insignes, à cause des bourses[11] de clystère qu’elles portaient à la ceinture, et me fut dit que l’une était le grand et l’autre le petit Luminaire des apothicaires.","I diligently considered there the fashion and attire of the polymixed lantern, of Martial, even more of the icosimixed, formerly consecrated by Canopus, daughter of Tisias. I noted there very well the pensile lantern, formerly taken from Thebes to the temple of Apollo Palatine and since transported to the city of Cyme Aolica by Alexander the Conqueror. I noticed another insignia, because of a fine flock of crimson silk on her head. And I was told that it was Bartole, lantern of right. I also noted two other insignia, because of the enema purses [11] they wore at the belt, and I was told that one was the large and the other the small Luminaire of the apothecaries.","I carefully studied the modish accoutrements of Polymix, the Lantern of Martial, and even more Eicosimyx, consecrated of old by Canopa, the daughter of Tisias.28 I especially noted Pensila, the lantern formerly taken from the temple of Apollo Palatine in Thebes and subsequently removed to the city of Cyme in Aeolia by Alexander the Conqueror. I noted another one which was outstanding because of a beautiful tuft of crimson silk which she wore on her head; I was told that she was Bartolus, the Light of the Law. I noted two others who were outstanding on account of the clyster-bags they wore on their belts. I was told that they were the two Luminaries of the apothecaries, the Great and the Lesser.","Martial’s Polymix * Lantern made a very good Figure there: I took particular notice of its Dress, and more yet of the Lychnosimity, formerly consecrated by Canopa the Daughter of Tisias. I saw the Lantern Pensile formerly taken out of the Temple of Apollo Palatinus at Thebes, by Alexander the Great. I saw another that distinguish’d it self from the rest by a Bushy Tuft of Crimsin Silk on its Head. I was told, ’twas that of Bartolus, the Lantern of the Civilians. Two others were very remarkable for Glister-pouches that dangled at their waste. We were told, that one was the Greater Light, and the other the Lesser Light of the ’Pothecaries."
"– Comme vous autres, Messieurs, répondit Bridoye, savoir est quand il y a beaucoup de sacs d’une part et d’autre.

"Retournants, trouvâmes la porte fermée, et nous fut dit que là facilement on y entrait comme en Averne : à issir[21] était la difficulté, et que ne sortirions hors en manière que ce fût, sans bulletin et décharge de l’assistance, par cette seule raison qu’on ne s’en va pas des foires comme du marché, et qu’avions les pieds poudreux. Le pis fut quand passâmes le guichet, car nous fûmes présentés, pour avoir notre bulletin et décharge, devant un monstre le plus hideux que jamais fut décrit. On le nommaient niait Grippeminaud. Je ne vous le saurais mieux comparer qu’à Chimère ou à Sphynx et à Cerberus, ou bien au simulacre[22] d’Osiris, ainsi que le figuraient les Égyptiens, par trois têtes ensemble jointes : savoir est d’un lion rugissant, d’un chien flattant et d’un loup bâillant, entortillés d’un dragon soi mordant la queue et de rayons scintillants à l’entour. Les mains avait pleines de sang, les griffes comme de harpie, le museau à bec de corbin, les dents d’un sanglier quadrannier[23], les yeux flamboyants comme une gueule d’enfer, tout couvert de mortiers entrelacés de pilons : seulement apparaissaient les griffes. Le siège d’icelui et de tous ses collatéraux chats garanniers[24] était d’un long râtelier tout neuf, au-dessus duquel, par forme de revers, instablées[25] étaient mangeoires fort amples et belles, selon l’avertissement du gueux. À l’endroit du siège principal était l’image d’une vieille femme, tenant en main dextre un fourreau de faucille, en senestre une balance, et portant besicles au nez. Les coupes[26] de la balance étaient de deux gibecières veloutées[27], l’une pleine de billon et pendante, l’autre vide et longue élevée au-dessus du trébuchet. Et suis d’opinion que c’était le portrait de justice grippeminaudière, bien abhorrente[28] de l’institution des antiques Thébains, qui érigeaient les statues de leurs dicastes et juges après leur mort, en or, et argent, en marbre, selon leur mérite, toutes sans mains. Quand fûmes devant lui présentés, ne sais quelle sorte de gens, tous vêtus de gibecières et de sacs, à[29] grands lambeaux d’écritures, nous firent sur une sellette asseoir. Panurge disait : « Gallefretiers[30], mes amis, je ne suis que trop bien ainsi debout : aussi bien elle est trop basse pour homme qui a chausses neuves et court pourpoint. » – « Asseyez-vous là, répondirent-ils, et que plus on ne vous le dise. La terre présentement s’ouvrira pour tous vifs vous engloutir si faillez à bien répondre. »","Returning, we found the door closed, and we were told that there we entered easily as in Avernus: at issir[21] was the difficulty, and that we would not go out in any way whatsoever, without bulletin and discharge from the assistance, for the sole reason that we do not go away from fairs like from the market, and that we had dusty feet. The worst was when we passed the window, because we were presented, to have our bulletin and discharge, in front of a most hideous monster than ever was described. They called him Niait Grippeminaud. I could not compare him better to you than to Chimera or to Sphynx and to Cerberus, or else to the simulacrum[22] of Osiris, as the Egyptians represented him, by three joined heads together: to know is of a roaring lion, of a petting dog and a yawning wolf, entwined with a self-biting dragon's tail and twinkling rays all around. The hands were full of blood, the claws like a harpy, the snout beaked like a crow, the teeth of a four-year-old boar[23], the eyes blazing like a jaws of hell, all covered with mortars intertwined with pestles: only the claws appeared. The seat of him and of all his collateral garannier cats[24] was a long, brand new rack, above which, in the form of a reverse, installed[25] were very ample and beautiful mangers, according to the warning of the beggar. At the place of the principal seat was the image of an old woman, holding in the dexter hand a sheath of a sickle, in the sinister a balance, and carrying spectacles in her nose. The cups[26] of the balance were two velvety game bags[27], one full of billon and hanging down, the other empty and long raised above the trebuchet. And am of opinion that it was the portrait of sly, abhorrent [28] justice of the institution of the ancient Thebans, who erected the statues of their dicastes and judges after their death, in gold, and silver, in marble, according to their merit, all without hands. When we were presented before him, I don't know what kind of people, all dressed in satchels and bags, with [29] large shreds of writing, made us sit on a saddle. Panurge said: “Galefretiers[30], my friends, I am only too well standing thus: moreover it is too low for a man who has new breeches and a short doublet. – “Sit there, they answered, and let no one tell you anymore. The earth presently will open up for all alive to swallow you up if you fail to respond well. »","On our return we found the gate closed; they told us that it was as easy to get in there as into Avernus: the hard thing was to get out again; we could in no wise do so without a permit and a discharge from those present, for this sole reason : It’s one thing to quit a fair and quite another a market, and in law we were pedepulverosi.9 The worst was to come when we passed through the wicket-gate: in order to obtain our permits and discharges we were brought before the most horrid monster ever described. He was called Catty-claws. I could best compare him to a chimera, a sphinx and a Cerberus, or else to that figure of Osiris as the Egyptians portrayed him, having three heads joined together, namely those of a roaring lion, a fawning dog and a yawning wolf, entwined about by a snake biting its own tail, with shimmering rays all round it.10 His hands were dripping with blood; his claws were those of a harpy; his snout, like the crow’s-bill lancet of a surgeon, his fangs, like a wild boar in its fourth year; his eyes, aflame like the mouth of Hell bedecked with mortars all criss-crossed by pestles. Nothing showed but lis claws. The bench on which he sat with the Feral Cats his assessors, consisted of a brand-new fodder-rack, above which, just as the beggar had told us, were set, back to front, beautiful and capacious mangers. Above the principal seat hung the portrait of an old crone wearing glasses on her nose and holding the sheath of a sickle in her right hand and a pair of scales in her left. The pans of those scales consisted of two velvet game-bags: one, weighed down, was full of coins; the other, empty, was raised high above the pivot. It was, in my opinion, the symbol of Cattyclavian justice, quite different from the practice of the ancient Thebans, who raised statues to their judges and Dicasts only once they were dead, statues made, according to their merits, of gold, silver and marble, but all without hands.11 When we were brought before them some people or other, all bedizened with game-bags and bundles full of big, ragged, old parchments, made us sit down on a low stool. Panurge said, ‘Well now, my friends, you scabby vagabonds. I am much better standing: such stools are too low for a man wearing new breeches and a short doublet.’ ‘You sit down there!’ they replied. ‘Let us not have to tell you again. If you fail to answer properly, the earth will gape open this instant and swallow you alive.’ How a riddle was propounded to us by Catty-claws CHAPTER 12 [In the original much play is made here on the repeated ejaculation Orça","Upon this we were filing off; but alas! we found our selves trapp’d: The Door was double lock’d and barricado’d. Some Messengers of ill news told us, ’twas full as easy to get in there, as to get into Hell, and as hard for some to get out. Ay, there indeed lay the Difficulty: For there is no getting loose without a Pass and Discharge in due Course from the Bench. This for no other reason than because Folks go easier out of a Church than out of a Spunging-house, and they could not have our Company when they would. The worst on ’t was when we got thro’ the Wicket , for we were carry’d to get out our Pass or Discharge, before a more dreadful Monster than ever was read of in the Legends of Knight-Erranty: They call’d him Gripe-men-all: I can’t tell what to compare it to, better than to a Chymœra, a Sphynx, a Cerberus; or to the Image of Osiris, as the Egyptians represented him, with Three Heads, one of a Roaring Lion, t’ other of a Fawning Curr, and the last of a Howling Prowling Wolf, twisted about with a Dragon, biting his Tail, surrounded with Fiery Rays. His Hands were full of Gore, his Talons like those of the Harpies, his Snout like a Hawk’s Bill, his Fangs or Tusks like those of an overgrown brindled Wild-Boare, his Eyes were flaming like the Jaws of Hell, all cover’d with Mortars interlac’d with Pestles, and nothing of his Arms was to be seen but his Clutches. His Hutch, and That of the Warren cats his Collaterals, was a long, spick-and-span new Rack, a top of which, (as the Mumper told us) some large, stately Mangers were fix’d in the Reverse. Over the Chief Seat was the Picture of an Old-woman holding the case or Scabbord of a Sickle in her Right-hand, a Pair of Scales in her Left, with Spectacles on her Nose: The Cups of the Balance were a Pair of Velvet-Pouches; the one full of Bullion, which overpois’d t’ other, empty and long, hoisted higher than the middle of the Beam: I’m of opinion that it was the true Effigies of Justice Gripe-men-all; far different from the Institution of the ancient Thebans, who set up the Statues of their Dicastes without Hands, in Marble, Silver, or Gold, according to their Merit, even after their Death. When we made our Personal Appearance before him, a sort of I don’t-know- what men, all cloath’d with I don’t-know-what Bags and Pouches, with long Scrowls in their Clutches, made us sit down upon a Cricket: [Such as Criminals sit on when they are Try’d in France.] Quoth Panurge to ’em, Good my Lords, I’m very well as I am; I’d as lieve stand, an ’t please you. Besides, this same Stool is somewhat of the lowest for a Man that has new Breeches and a short Doublet. Sit you down, said Gripe-men-all again, and look that you don’t make the Court bid you twice. Now, continu’d he, The Earth shall immediately open its Jaws, and swallow you up to quick Damnation, if you don’t answer as you should."
"« Plus amiablement l’appelaient, plus rudement s’escarmouchait-il, et à sauts et à pétarades. Ils y fussent encore, ne fût la bergère qui les avertit cribler avoine haut en l’air, en l’appelant : ce que fut fait. Soudain l’âne tourna visage disant : « Avoine, bien, avenant : non la fourche ; je ne dis : qui médit passe sans flux[23]. » Ainsi à eux se rendit, chantant mélodieusement, comme vous savez que fait bon ouïr la voix et musique de ces bêtes arcadiques.","""The more amiably called him, the rougher he skirmished, and with leaps and spurs.

So to them surrendered, singing melodiously, as you know how good to hear the voice and music of those arcadic beasts.","‘The more kindly they called it, the more wildly it flayed about, kicking up its heels and farting.

I don’t say, Pass, no trumps.” ‘And so it went over to them, singing harmoniously: it is, as you know, nice to hear the musical tones of those beasts from Arcady!","Insomuch that they might have been there to this hour, had not his Mistress advis’d them to toss Oats in a Sive, or in a Blanket, and call him, which was done, and made him wheel-about, and say; Oats with a witness, Oats shall go to pot, adveniat ; Oats will do, there’s Evidence in the Case; but none of the Rubbing down, none of the Firking. Thus Melodiously Singing, for as you know that Arcadian Bird’s Note is very Harmonious, he came to the young Gentlemen of the Horse, alias Blackgarb, who brought him into the Stable."
47. Comment en haute mer Pantagruel ouï diverses paroles dégelées,47. How on the high seas Pantagruel heard various unfrozen words,"Cf. the flying pig in chapter 41 The terms used for the Platonic ‘Ideas’ are quite usual – Words, Ideas, exemplars and portraits – but it is Rabelais who gives pride of place to Words (parolles,). Around this ‘Manor of Truth’ lies the ‘Age’ (in Greek, the aeon) which Christians alone interpolate between Time and Eternity. Some of those ‘Words of Truth’ drip down on to this world ‘like catarrh’ (a comparison taken over from the end of the Cratylus). A scriptural example of such a dripping of divine Truth into this world is the account of Gideon’s fleece (Judges 6: taken by many to foretell the fecundation of the Virgin Mary). The key lies in the last words of the Risen Lord at the very end of Matthew’s Gospel: ‘I am with you always, even until the consummation of the Age.’ The original French is close to the Latin Vulgate: the allusion is less clear in traditional English. Rabelais’ term parolle (Word) is given an initial capital in these chapters to distinguish it from the ordinary term mot (word) or the technical term voix, rendered by ‘voice’ but meaning simultaneously ‘voice’ and ‘word’. Both ‘voices’ (Latin voces,) and ‘vocable’ are technical terms.","CHAPTER LV How Pantagruel, being at Sea, heard various unfrozen words."
9. Comment Pantagruel descendit en l’île de Chéli en laquelle régnait le roi Saint-Panigon,9. How Pantagruel went down to the island of Cheli in which reigned King Saint-Panigon,"They have no fathers or mothers. That’s a matter for outlandish folk, for clodhoppers.’ That good fellow Pantagruel saw it all and quietly took it all in but at those words he nearly lost control. So, having carefully studied the site of the island and the customs of the Ennasian people, we went into a tavern for a little refreshment. They were celebrating a wedding there in the local fashion and having no end of a time. In our presence they merrily married together a Pear – a very buxom woman so it seemed to us, though those who squeezed her found her a bit soft – and a young Cheese with reddish down on his cheeks. I had previously heard rumours of such things, and several similar marriages have been celebrated elsewhere. They still say in my back-of-the-woods that Pear and Cheese match well together! In another room I saw that they were marrying an old Boot to a supple young Buskin; Pantagruel was told that the young Buskin was taking the old Boot to wife because she was a good bargain, in a good state and so delightfully ample that she could even serve as an angler’s waders. In another – lower – room I saw a young Dancing-Shoe marry an elderly Slipper. And we were told that it was not for any beauty or elegance she had but out of covetousness and greed for the gold coins with which she was stuffed. How Pantagruel landed on the Island of Cheli over which ruled the saintly King Panigon CHAPTER 10 [Was originally Chapter 5. This island is a kind of Land of Cockaigne.

Qui aussi ne fût rebelle.,Who also was not rebellious.,"you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Ha, (said he), you are not so bad as you say, no, or else I am deceived in your physiognomie, for sooner shall the earth mount up unto the Heavens, and the highest Heavens descend unto the Hells, and all the course of nature be quite perverted, then that in so great beauty and neatnesse as in you is, there should be one drop of gall or malice: they say indeed, that hardly shall a man ever see a faire woman that is not also stubborn:"

"« J’entends, répondit Pantagruel, et me semblez bon topiqueur[1] et affecté à votre cause. Mais prêchez et patrocinez[2] d’ici à la Pentecôte, en fin vous serez ébahi comment rien ne m’aurez persuadé, et, par votre beau parler, jà ne me ferez entrer en dettes. Rien, dit le saint Envoyé, à personne ne devez, fors amour et dilection mutuelle. Vous m’usez ici de belle graphides et diatyposes[3], et me plaisent très bien, mais je vous dis que, si figurez un affronteur effronté et importun emprunteur, entrant de nouveau en une ville jà avertie de ses mœurs, vous trouverez qu’à son entrée plus seront les citoyens en effroi et trépidation[4] que si la peste y entrait en habillement tel que la trouva le philosophe Tyanien dedans Ephèse. Et suis d’opinion que n’erraient les Perses, estimants le second vice être mentir, le premier être devoir, car dettes et mensonges sont ordinairement ensemble ralliés.","“I hear,” replied Pantagruel, “and seem to me a good topper[1] and affected to your cause. But preach and patrocinate[2] from now until Pentecost, in the end you will be amazed how nothing will have persuaded me, and, by your fine speech, will never make me go into debt. Nothing, says the holy Envoy, owe no one, except love and mutual affection. You use me here with beautiful graphides and diatyposes[3], and please me very well, but I tell you that, if you imagine a brazen challenger and importunate borrower, entering again into a city already aware of its morals, you will find that At its entrance more will the citizens be in terror and trepidation [4] than if the plague entered it in clothing such as the Tyanian philosopher found it in Ephesus. And I am of opinion that the Persians did not err, considering the second vice to be lying, the first to be duty, for debts and lies are usually joined together.","[Topics is the title of a much-studied work by Aristotle, a compendium of which was given by Cicero. It formed a basis of education in an age which appreciated eloquence and skilled argument. But rhetoric and dialectic do not themselves lead to the truth. To overthrow the perverse fluent ingenuity of Panurge one verse of Saint Paul suffices: ‘Owe no man any thing, but to love one another’ (Romans 13:8). The words ‘mutual love-and-affection’ render that love which is agape (so different from Panurge’s self-love, philautia). Saint Paul is supported by Plato (Laws, 98) as cited by Plutarch in his treatise On Avoiding Usury. Rabelais’ big guns are out! Apollonius of Tyana claimec to have encountered the Plague personified: he found her horrifying.] ‘I understand you,’ answered Pantagruel; ‘you seem to me to be good at your Topics and zealous for your cause; but preach and patrocinate from now to Whitsuntide and you’ll be amazed to learn that you have failed in the end to persuade me. “Owe no man anything,” said the holy Apostle, “save mutual love-and-affection.” You are employing fine graphic terms and vivid descriptions. I find them most enjoyable, but I can tell you this: that if you picture for yourself a flagrant fraudster, a relentless loan-taker, newly arriving in a town already warned of his way of life, you will find that the townsfolk will be more agitated and terrified by his arrival titan if the Plague had arrived in person, dressed as she was when the Philosopher of Tyana came across her in Ephesus. And I am of the opinion that the Persians were not in error when they judged lying to be the second vice, the first being to run up debts, for debts and lies normally go together.","I UNDERSTAND you very well, (quoth Pantagruel) and take you to be very good at Topicks, and throughly affectioned to your own Cause: But preach it up, and patrocinate it; prattle on it, and defend it as much as you will, even from hence to the next Whitsuntide, if you please so to do, yet in the end will you be astonish’d to find how you shall have gained no ground at all upon me, nor perswaded me by your fair Speeches and smooth Talk to enter never so little into the Thraldom of Debt. You shall owe to none (saith the Holy Apostle) any thing save Love, Friendship, and a mutual Benevolence. You serve me here, I confess, with fine Graphides and Diatyposes, Descriptions and Figures, which truly please me very well: But let me tell you, if you will represent unto your Fancy an impudent blustering Bully and an importunate Borrower, entring afresh and newly into a Town already advertised of his Manners, you shall find that at his Ingress the Citizens will be more hideously affrighted and amazed, and in a greater terror and fear, dread and trembling, than if the Pest it self should step into it in the very same Garb and Accoutrement wherein the Tyanœan Philosopher found it within the City of Ephesus. And I am fully confirmed in the Opinion, that the Persians erred not, when they said, That the second Vice was to Lie, the first being that of owing Money. For in very truth, Debts and Lying are ordinarily joyned together."

"« Autres ont eu l’esprit plus héroïque, et, à l’exemple des enfants de Jacob vengeant le rapt de Dinah leur sœur, ont trouvé le rufian, associé de son taupetier, clandestinement parlementants et subornants leurs filles, les ont sur l’instant mis en pièces et occis félonement, leurs corps après jetants ès loups et corbeaux parmi les champs. Auquel acte tant viril et chevalereux ont les symmistes[26] taupetiers frémi et lamenté misérablement, ont formé complaintes horribles, et en toute importunité requis et imploré le bras séculier et justice politique, instants[27] fièrement[28] et contendants[29] être de tels cas faite exemplaire punition. Mais, ni en équité naturelle, ni en droit des gens, ni en loi impériale quelconque, n’a été trouvé rubrique, paragraphe, point, ni titre par lequel fût peine ou torture à tel fait interminée[30], raison obsistante[31], nature répugnante, car homme vertueux on[32] monde n’est qui naturellement et par raison plus ne soit en son sens perturbé, oyant les nouvelles du rapt, diffame et déshonneur de sa fille que de sa mort. Or est qu’un chacun, trouvant le meurtrier sur le fait d’homicide en la personne de sa fille, iniquement et de guet-apens, le peut par raison, le doit par nature occire sur l’instant, et n’en sera par justice appréhendé[33].","""Others had a more heroic spirit, and, like the children of Jacob avenging the abduction of Dinah their sister, found the rufian, associate of his molester, secretly parleying and bribing their daughters, had them on the Instantly torn to pieces and slain treacherously, their bodies after throwing wolves and crows among the fields. At which act so manly and chivalrous have the symmists[26] mole-eaters shuddered and lamented miserably, formed horrible laments, and in all importunity demanded and implored the secular arm and political justice, moments[27] proudly[28] and contending[29] be such cases made exemplary punishment. But neither in natural equity, nor in the law of nations, nor in any imperial law, has there been found any heading, paragraph, point, or title by which punishment or torture for such an act was terminated[30], obstinate reason[31 ], repugnant nature, because virtuous man one[32] is who naturally and for reason no longer is in his sense disturbed, hearing the news of the kidnapping, defamation and dishonor of his daughter than of her death. However, each one, finding the murderer on the act of homicide in the person of his daughter, iniquity and ambush, can by reason, must by nature slay at the moment, and will not be apprehended by justice[33].","‘Others have been of a more heroic mind and, following the example of the sons of Jacob avenging the rape of their sister Dinah, have discovered the lecher, in partnership with his mysteriarch40 clandestinely seducing their daughters with words and suborning them, have at once hacked them to pieces, killing them like felons and scattering their corpses over the fields for the wolves and the crows. ‘Confronted by a deed so virile and noble their companion mysteriarchal moles have trembled and made miserable lamentations, framing dreadful protests, most pressingly begging and imploring the secular arm and the civil power to act, wildly urging and advocating that such cases be visited with exemplary punishment. Yet there has never been found one paragraph, rubric or chapter anywhere in natural equity, the law of nations or Roman law, which threatens punishment or torture for any such deed. Reason resists it; Nature opposes it: for there is not one virtuous man in all the world whose mind is not more utterly distraught on hearing the news of the abduction, shaming and dishonouring of his daughter than of her death. Now any father discovering a murderer wickedly lying in wait to commit homicide against the person of his daughter can by reason, and must by nature, kill him on the spot: never will he be apprehended by Justice.","Others again of that Parental Relation, have upon the reception of the like Injury, been of a more magnanimous and heroick Spirit, who (in imitation, and at the Example of the Children of Jacob, revenging upon the Sichemits the Rapt of their Sister Dina) having found the Rascally Ruffian in the Association of his mystical Mole-catcher closely and in hugger-mugger, conferring, parlying, and coming with their Daughters, for the suborning, corrupting, depraving, perverting and enticing these innocent, unexperienced Maids unto filthy Lewdnesses, have, without any further Advisement on the matter, cut them instantly into pieces, and thereupon forthwith thrown out upon the Fields their so dismembred Bodies, to serve for Food unto the Wolves and Ravens. Upon the chivalrous, bold and couragious Atchievement of a so valiant, stout and man-like Act, the other Mole-catching Symmists have been so highly incensed, and have so chaffed, fretted and fumed thereat, that Bills of Complaint and Accusations having been in a most odious and detestible manner put in before the competent Judges, the Arm of Secular Authority hath with much Importunity and Impetuosity been by them implored and required, they proudly contending, that the Servants of God would become contemptible, if exemplary Punishment were not speedily taken upon the Persons of the Perpetrators of such an enormous, horrid, sacrilegious, crying, heinous, and execrable Crime. Yet neither by Natural Equity, by the Law of Nations, nor by any Imperial Law whatsoever, hath there been found so much as one Rubrick, Paragraph, Point or Tittle, by the which any kind of Chastisement or Correction hath been adjudged due to be inflicted upon any for their Delinquency in that kind. Reason opposeth, and Nature is repugnant: For there is no vertuous Man in the World, who, both naturally and with good reason, will not be more hugely troubled in Mind, hearing of the News of the Rapt, Disgrace, Ignominy and Dishonour of his Daughter, than of her Death. Now any Man finding in hot Blood, one who with a fore-thought Felony hath murthered his Daughter, may, without tying himself to the Formalities and Circumstances of a Legal Proceeding, kill him on a sudden, and out of hand, without incurring any hazard of being attainted and apprehended by the Officers of Justice for so doing.

In the Day of Judgement, when He shall come to judge, do you really want them to find you with your balls full?’","Fryar Ihon very merrily, and with a sprightly chearfulness made this Answer to him : Marry, in the Devil’s Name, Why not: What the Devil else shouldst thou do, but marry? Take thee a Wife, and furbish her Harnish to some tune: Swinge her Skin-coat, as if thou wert beating on Stock-fish, and let the repercussion of thy Clapper from her resounding Metal, make a Noise, as if a Double Peal of Chiming-Bells were hung at the Cremasters of thy Ballocks. As I say Marry, so do I understand, that thou shouldst fall to work as speedily as may be: yea, my meaning is, that thou oughtest to be so quick and forward there-in, as on this same very day, before Sunset, to cause, proclaim thy Banes of Matrimony, and make provision of Bedsteads. By the Blood of a Hog’s-pudding, till when wouldst thou delay the acting of a Husband’s part? Dost thou not know, and is it not daily told unto thee, that the end of the World approacheth? We are nearer it by three Poles, and half a Fathom, then we were two days ago. The Antichrist is already born, at least it is so reported by many: the truth is, that hitherto the effects of his wrath have not reached further than to the scratching of his Nurse and Governesses: his Nails are not sharp enough as yet, nor have his Claws attained to their full growth; he is little. Crescat; Nos qui vivimus, multiplicemur. It is written so, and it is holy stuff , I warrant you: The truth whereof is like to last as long as a Sack of Corn may be had for a Penny, and a Punction of pure Wine for Threepence. Would thou be content to be found with thy Genitories full in the Day of Judgment? Dum veneris judicari."

"« Mais, disait Trudon, cachant l’œil avec son mouchoir et montrant son tambourin défoncé d’un côté, quel mal leur avais-je fait ? Il ne leur a suffi m’avoir ainsi lourdement morrambouzevezengouzequoque morguatasacbacguevezine maffressé mon pauvre œil ; d’abondant[7] ils m’ont défoncé mon tambourin. Tambourins à noces sont ordinairement battus : tambourineurs bien festoyés, battus jamais. Le diable s’en puisse coiffer ! » – « Frère, lui dit chicanous manchot, je te donnerai unes belles, grandes, vieilles lettres royaux, que j’ai ici en mon baudrier, pour rapetasser ton tambourin, et pour Dieu pardonne-nous. Par Notre-Dame de Rivière, la belle dame, je n’y pensais en mal. »","""But,"" said Trudon, hiding his eye with his handkerchief and showing his tambourine broken on one side, ""what harm had I done them?"" It was not enough for them to have so heavily morrambouzevezengouzequoque morguatasacbacguevezine hurt my poor eye; abundant[7] they smashed my tambourine. Tambourines at weddings are usually beaten: drummers well feasted, never beaten. The devil can take it! – “Brother,” said the chicanou one-armed, “I will give you a beautiful, large, old royal letter, which I have here in my belt, to patch up your tambourine, and for God forgive us. By Notre-Dame de Rivière, the beautiful lady, I did not think badly of it. »","“But,” said Trudon, covering his left eye with his handkerchief and pointing at his drum, one side of which had been knocked in, “What harm have I done them? It was not enough for them to have gravely cowpatconked-windbagthrottled-thumptbumped-bangbong-shattered my poor old eye: they have knocked in my drum as well. Drums are regularly beaten at weddings: drummer-boys never: they are feasted! The devil can use mine for his head-gear.” ‘Chicanous, now short of one arm, said to him, “Brother, to patch up your drum I shall give you a lovely big old Letters-patent that I’ve got here in my pouch. And do, for God’s sake, forgive us. By that beautiful Lady, Our Lady of Rivière, I meant no harm.”","But what harm had poor I done (cry’d Trudon hiding his left Eye with his Kerchief, and shewing his Tabor crack’d on one side) they were not satisfied with thus poaching, black-and-bluing, and morrambouzevezengouzequoquemorgasacbaquevezinemaffreliding my poor Eyes, but they have also broke my harmless Drum. Drums indeed are commonly beaten at Weddings; (and ’tis fit they should) but Drummers are well entertained, and never beaten. Now let Belzebub e’en take the Drum to make his Devilship a Night-Cap.

"Quand ces messieurs furent levés, Pantagruel pria Gagnebeaucoup qu’il nous menât en ce grand pressoir, ce qu’il fit volontiers. Sitôt que fumes entrés, Épistémon, qui entendait toutes langues, commença à montrer à Pantagruel les devises du pressoir, qui était grand, beau, fait, à ce que nous dit Gagnebeaucoup, du bois de la croix, car sur chacun ustensile étaient écrits les noms de chacune chose en langue du pays. La vis du pressoir s’appelait recette ; la met[17], dépense ; l’écrou, état ; le tesson[18], deniers comptés et non reçus : les fûts[19], souffrance ; les béliers, radietur ; les jumelles[20], recuperetur ; les cuves, plus valeur ; les ansées[21], rôles ; les fouloirs, acquits ; les hottes, validation ; les portoirs[22], ordonnance valable ; les seilles[23], le pouvoir ; l’entonnoir, le quittus.","When these gentlemen were up, Pantagruel begged Gagne to lead us to that great wine press, which he gladly did. As soon as you entered, Epistemon, who understood all languages, began to show Pantagruel the mottos of the press, which was large, beautiful, made, so Gagnelot tells us, of the wood of the cross, for on each utensil were written the names of each thing in the language of the country. The screw of the press was called receipt; puts it[17], expense; the nut, condition; the shard[18], money counted and not received: the barrels[19], suffering; the rams, radietur; binoculars[20], recuperetur; the vats, plus value; the handles[21], roles; the rammers, acquitted; hoods, validation; racks[22], prescription valid; the seilles[23], power; the funnel, the quit.","He then said to Pantagruel that beds were much cheaper here than in the Chinonais, despite our having the celebrated Pautille geese, since that old woman had merely asked five dozen pence for a bed which in the Chinonais would fetch a dozen francs at least.12","O’ Saturdays, they gnaw’d Bones, not that they were poor or needy, for every Mother’s Son of ’em had a very good fat Belly-Benefice. As for their Drink, ’twas an Antifortunal, thus they call’d I don’t know what sort of a Liquor of the place. When they wanted to eat or drink, they turn’d down the Back-points or Flaps of their Cowls forwards, below their Chins, and that serv’d ’em instead of Gorgets or Slabbering-Bibs. When they had well din’d, they pray’d rarely, all in Quavers and Shakes; and the rest of the day, expecting the day of Judgment, they were taken up with Acts of Charity. And particularly, O’ Sundays, Rubbers at Cuffs. O’ Mondays, lending each other Flirts and Fillups on the Nose. O’ Tuesdays, clapperclawing one another. O’ Wednesdays, sniting and fly-flapping. O’ Thursdays, worming and pumping. O’ Fridays, tickling. O’ Saturdays, jirking and firking one another. Such was their Diet when they resided in the Convent, and if the Prior of the Monk-house sent any of them abroad, then they were strictly enjoin’d, neither to touch nor eat any manner of Fish, as long as they were on Sea or Rivers; and to abstain from all manner of Flesh whenever they were at Land, that every one might be convinc’d that while they enjoy’d the Object, they deni’d themselves the Power, and even the Desire, and were no more mov’d with it, than the Marpesian Rock. All this was done with proper Antiphones, still sung and chanted by Ear, as we have already observed. When the Sun went to bed, they fairly Booted and Spurr’d each other as before, and having clapt on their Barnicles, e’en jogg’d to bed too. At Midnight the Sandal came to them, and up they got, and having well whetted and set their Rasors, and been a processioning, they clapt the Tables over themselves, and like wire-drawers under their work, fell to it as aforesaid. Friar Jhon des Entoumeures, having shrewdly observ’d these jolly Semiquaver-Friars, and had a full account of their Statutes, lost all patience, and cry’d out aloud; Bounce Tail, and God ha’ mercy Guts; if every Fool should wear a Bable, Fewel would be dear. A Plague rot it, we must know how many Farts go to an Ounce; would Priapus were here as he us’d to be at the nocturnal Festivals in Crete, that I might see him play backwards and wriggle and shake to the purpose. Ay, ay, this is the World, and t’ other is the Country; may I never piss, if this be not an Antichthonian Land, and our very Antipodes. In Germany they pull down Monasteries and unfrockifie the Monks; here they go quite Kam, and act clean contrary to others, setting new ones up, against the hair. CHAPTER XXVIII"

"Sur la fin de ce discours, arrivèrent les deux colonels, accompagnés de leurs soudards, tous bien armés et bien délibérés[21]. Pantagruel leur fit une brève remontrance à ce qu’ils eussent à soi montrer vertueux au combat, si par cas étaient contraints (car encore ne pouvait-il croire que les andouilles fussent si traîtresses), avec défense de commencer le hourt[22], et leur bailla Mardigras pour mot du guet.","At the end of this speech, the two colonels arrived, accompanied by their soldiers, all well armed and well deliberated[21]. Pantagruel gave them a brief admonishment that they should show themselves virtuous in battle, if by case they were forced (for still he could not believe that the andouilles were so treacherous), with prohibition to begin the hourt[22], and yawned Mardigras for word of the watch.","Towards the end of this discourse the two colonels arrived, accompanied by their soldiers, all fully armed and fully resolute. Pantagruel gave them a brief word of encouragement, telling them to prove themselves valiant in the field (if, that is, they were really forced to fight, for he could not yet believe that the Chidlings were as treacherous as that) but forbade them to start the engagement. And the watchword he gave them was Mardi Gras. That Chidlings are not to be despised by human beings CHAPTER 38 [Mardi Gras is the watchword: the mock-heroic battle is soon to be joined fought out in the spirit of Shrovetide fun. The quotation about the serpent who tempted Eve is taken from Genesis 3:9. Henry Cornelius Agrippa had published a Disputable Opinion suggesting that the serpent which tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden was in fact Adam’s penis.] Here you are scoffing at me, you Drinkers, and do not believe in the truth of a word I am saying. I’ve no idea what I should do with you. Believe it if you will, and if you won’t, go there and see it for yourself: I know all right what I saw: the place was the Ile Farouche. There: I tell you its name. Now recall the might of those Giants of old who undertook to pile lofty Mount Pelion upon Ossa, and then with Ossa to enwrap the tree-shaded Olympus so as to fight the gods and drive them from their nests in the heavens. That might was neither ordinary might nor within the Mean. Yet those Giants were Chidlings for only half their bodies – or, to tell the truth, Serpents. The serpent which tempted Eve was of Chidling stock; nevertheless it is written that it was ‘more wiley and subtle than any beast of the field’; so are the Chidlings. And it is still maintained in certain academic circles that the Tempter was a Chidling called Ithyphallus, into whom, long ago, was transformed good Messer Priapus, that great tempter of women in gardens (called paradises in Greek and jardins in French). How can we be sure that the Switzers, a people now hardy and warlike, were not formerly Sausages? I shouldn’t like to swear to it, finger in pyre. The Himantopodes, a famous people in Ethiopia, are (according to the description in Pliny) nothing but Sausages. If those arguments do not allay the scepticism within you, then, my Lords, go straight away – after a drink, I mean – and visit Lusignan, Parthenay, Vouvant, Mervent and Pouzaugues in Poitou. There you will find long-renowned witnesses, all truly wrought, who will swear to you on the arm of Saint Rigomé that Melusina, their original foundress, had the body of a female down to her prick-wallet and that all the rest below was either a serpentine Chidling or a chidlingesque Serpent. Yet she had a fine and gallant step, still imitated today by Breton dancers when performing their tuneful floral-dances. What caused Erichthonius to be the first to invent coaches, litters and chariots? It was because Vulcan had begotten him with Chidlingesque legs, and the better to conceal them he preferred to go by litter than by horse, since already in his days Chidlings were not highly esteemed. Ora, the Scythian nymph, similarly had a body which was partly woman, partly Chidling, yet she appeared so fair to Jupiter that he lay with her and produced a handsome son called Colaxes. So stop all that sneering now and believe that nothing is as true as the Gospel. How Frère Jean allies himself with the kitchen-men to combat the Chidlings","He had hardly ended this Discourse, when the two Colonels arrived with their Soldiers, all well arm’d and resolute. Pantagruel made them a short Speech, intreating them to behave themselves bravely, in case they were attackt; for he cou’d not yet believe that the Chitterlings were so treacherous, but he bad them by no means to give the first offence; giving them Carnaval for the Watch-word. CHAPTER XXXVIII How Chitterlings are not to be slighted by Men. YOU shake your empty Noddles now, jolly Topers, and don’t believe what I tell you here any more than if it were some Tale of a Tub: Well, well, I can’t help it. Believe it if you will; if you won’t, let it alone. For my part, I very well know what I saw. It was in the wild Island, in our Voyage to the Holy Bottle, I tell you the Time and Place, what would you have more? I would have you call to mind the strength of the ancient Giants that undertook to lay the high Mountain Pelion on the top of Ossa, and set among those the shady Olympus, to dash out the Gods Brains, unnestle them and scour their Heavenly Lodgings. Their’s was no small strength, you may well think, and yet they were nothing but Chitterlings from the Waste downwards, or at least, Serpents, not to tell a Lye for the matter. The Serpent that tempted Eve too was of the Chitterling kind, and yet it is recorded of him, that he was more subtle than any Beast of the Field. Even so are Chitterlings: Nay, to this very hour they hold in some Universities that this same Tempter was the Chitterling call’d Ithyphallus, or Standing, into which was transform’d bawdy Priapus Arch-seducer of Females in Paradise, that is, a Garden in Greek. Pray now tell me, Who can tell but that the Switzers now so bold and warlike were formerly Chitterlings? For my part, I would not take my Oath to the contrary. The Himantopodes, a Nation very famous in Ethiopia, according to Pliny’s Description, are Chitterlings, and nothing else. If all this will not satisfie your Worships, or remove your Incredulity, I would have you forthwith (I mean drinking first, that nothing be done rashly) visit Lusignan, Parthenay, Vouant, Mervant, and Pouzauges in Poictou. There you will find a Cloud of Witnesses, not of your Affidavit-Men of the right stamp, but Credible, time out of mind, that will take their Corporal Oath, on Rigome’s Knuckle-bone, that Mellusine their first Founder, or Foundress, which you please, was Woman from the Head to the Prick-purse, and thence downwards was a Serpentine Chitterling, or if you’ll have it otherwise, a Chitterlingdiz’d Serpent. She nevertheless had a genteel and noble Gate, imitated to this very Day by your Hop-Merchants of Britanny in their Paspié and Country Dances. What do you think was the cause of Erichthonius’s being the first Inventor of Coaches, Litters, and Chariots? Nothing but because Vulcan had begot him with Chitterlingdiz’d Legs, which to hide, he chose to ride in a Litter rather than on Horse-back; for Chitterlings were not yet in esteem at that time. The Scythian Nymph Ora was likewise half Woman and half Chitterling; and yet seem’d so beautiful to Jupiter, that nothing could serve him but he must give her a touch of his Godship’s kindness; and accordingly had a brave Boy by her call’d Colaxes, and therefore, I would have you leave off shaking your empty Noddles at this, as if it were a Story, and firmly believe that nothing is truer than the Gospel."

"« Vrai est qu’elle ne les rapporte en telle sincérité comme les avait vues, obstant[5] l’imperfection et fragilité des sens corporels, comme la lune, recevant du soleil sa lumière, ne nous la communique telle, tant lucide, tant pure, tant vive et ardente comme l’avait reçue. Pourtant, reste à ces vaticinations somniales interprète qui soit dextre, sage, industrieux, expert, rationnel, et absolu onirocrite et oniropole[6] ; ainsi sont appelés des Grecs. C’est pourquoi Héraclitus disait rien par songes ne nous être exposé, rien aussi ne nous être célé ; seulement nous être donnée signification et indice des choses à venir, ou pour l’heur[7] et malheur nôtre, ou pour l’heur et malheur d’autrui. Les sacrées lettres le témoignent, les histoires profanes l’assurent, nous exposant mille cas advenus selon les songes, tant de la personne songeante que d’autrui pareillement. Les Atlantiques, et ceux qui habitent en l’île de Thasos, l’une des Cyclades, sont privés de cette commodité, on[8] pays desquels jamais personne ne songea. Aussi furent Cléon de Daulie, Thrasymèdes, et de notre temps le docte Villanovanus, Français, lesquels onques ne songèrent.","""It is true that she does not report them in such sincerity as she had seen them, obstant[5] the imperfection and fragility of the bodily senses, like the moon, receiving its light from the sun, does not communicate it to us such, so lucid, so pure, as lively and ardent as had received her. However, remains to these somnial vaticinations an interpreter who is dexterous, wise, industrious, expert, rational, and absolute oneirocrite and oneiropolis[6]; so are called Greeks. This is why Heraclitus said nothing by dreams should be exposed to us, nothing also be hidden from us; only be given to us significance and index of the things to come, or for the happiness[7] and misfortune ours, or for the happiness and misfortune of others. The sacred letters bear witness to it, the profane stories assure it, exposing to us a thousand cases that have happened according to the dreams, both of the dreaming person and of others alike. The Atlantics, and those who live on the island of Thasos, one of the Cyclades, are deprived of this convenience, a country of which no one ever dreamed. Also were Cleon de Daulie, Thrasymèdes, and of our time the learned Villanovanus, Frenchman, who never dreamed.","‘It is true that she cannot report them as purely as she saw them, being hampered by the imperfection and weakness of our bodily senses: similarly the Moon, on receiving her light from the Sun, does not impart it to us as bright, pure, vibrant and blazing as she received it. That is why, for divinations made during sleep, there is still the need of an interpreter (, an adroit, wise, rational and consummate oneirocrites, or oneiropolos as the Greeks call him). ‘That is why Herodotus would say that nothing was revealed to us by dreams nor anything hidden: we are merely given some pointer, some indication of things to come, either for our own happiness and unhappiness or else for the happiness and unhappiness of others. The Holy Scriptures testify to it and lay history confirms it, revealing to us hundreds of events which happened in accordance with the dreams of the person dreaming or equally the dreams of others. ‘The Atlantes and the people living on the isle of Thasos (one of the Cyclades) are deprived of that benefit: in their lands nobody has ever had dreams. ‘So too were Cleon of Daulia and Thrasymedes, and in our days the learned Frenchman Villanovanus, none of whom ever had dreams.","Nevertheless the truth is, that the Soul is seldom able to report those things in such Sincerity as it hath seen them, by reason of the Imperfection and Frailty of the Corporeal Senses, which obstruct the effectuating of that Office; even as the Moon doth not communicate unto this Earth of ours that Light which she receiveth from the Sun with so much Splendour, Heat, Vigour, Purity and Liveliness as it was given her. Hence it is requisite for the better reading, explaining and unfolding of these Somniatory Vaticinations and Predictions of that nature, that a dexterous, learned, skilful, wise, industrious, expert, rational and peremptory Expounder or Interpreter be pitched upon, such a one as by the Greeks is called Onirocrit, or Oniropolist. For this cause Heraclitus was wont to say, that nothing is by Dreams revealed to us, that nothing is by Dreams concealed from us, and that only we thereby have a mystical Signification and secret Evidence of Things to come, either for our prosperous or unlucky Fortune, or for the favourable or disasterous Success of another. The Sacred Scriptures testify no less, and profane Histories assure us of it, in both which are exposed to our view a thousand several kinds of strange Adventures, which have befallen pat according to the nature of the Dream, and that as well to the Party Dreamer, as to others. The Atlantick People, and those that inhabit the Land of Thasos (one of the Cyclades) are of this grand Commodity deprived; for in their Countries none yet ever dreamed. Of this sort, Cleon of Daulia, Thrasymedes; and in our days the learned Frenchman Villanovanus, neither of all which knew what Dreaming was."

The story of Brother Screwum (in the French: Frère Enguainnant) goes back to a tale of Poggio, but in his Jests ten virgins are concerned, not as here a hundred. ‘Courcaillet’ and the ‘Battle of Cornabons’ remain unexplained, but may be a way of suggesting that Panurge will be a cuckold (with cornabon loosely meaning ‘good for horns’). The final allusion to Galen is confused, Panurge mistaking Galen’s On the Difficulty of Breathing for his treatise On the Use of Respiration. There Galen in fact rejects the opinion attributed to him. A pure lapse or a learned joke?] ‘But,’ asked Panurge, ‘in which Law was it laid down and established that men who had planted a new vineyard, had built a new house or had newly wed, should be exempt from going to war for the first year?’","BUT, in the Interim, asked Panurge, by what Law was it constituted, ordained and established, that such as should plant a new Vineyard, those that should build a new House, and the new married Men should be exempted and discharged from the Duty of Warfare for the first year?"
"– Je note, dit Pantagruel, le point dernier qu’avez dit, et le confère avec le premier. Au commencement vous étiez tout confit en délices de votre songe. En fin vous éveillâtes en sursaut, fâché, perplexe et indigné.","“I note,” said Pantagruel, “the last point you said, and confer it with the first. In the beginning you were completely confided in the delights of your dream. In the end you awoke with a start, angry, perplexed and indignant.","‘I note,’ said Pantagruel, ‘the last detail which you gave and compare it to the first. At the beginning you were steeped in delight by your dream: at the end you awoke with a start, troubled, perplexed and angry…’","I remark (quoth Pantagruel) the last point or particle which you did speak of, and having seriously conferred it with the first, find that at the beginning you were delighted with the sweetness of your Dream; but in the end and final closure of it, you startingly awaked, and on a sudden were forthwith vexed in choler, and annoyed."
"Et de fait, on le voulut faire maître des requêtes et président en la cour ; mais il refusa tout, les remerciant gracieusement : « Car il y a, dit-il, trop grande servitude à ces offices, et à trop grande peine peuvent être sauvés ceux qui les exercent, vu la corruption des hommes, et crois que, si les sièges vides des anges ne sont remplis d’autre sorte de gens, que de trente-sept jubilés nous n’aurons le jugement final, et sera Cusanus trompé en ses conjectures. Je vous en avertis de bonne heure. Mais si avez quelque muid de bon vin, volontiers j’en recevrai le présent. » Ce qu’ils firent volontiers, et lui envoyèrent du meilleur de la ville, et but assez bien. Mais le pauvre Panurge en but vaillamment, car il était eximé[6] comme un hareng sauret. Aussi allait-il du pied comme un chat maigre. Et quelqu’un l’admonesta, à demie haleine d’un grand hanap plein de vin vermeil, disant : « Compère, tout beau ! vous faites rage de humer[7].","And in fact, they wanted him to be made master of requests and president of the court; but he refused all, thanking them graciously: ""For there is,"" he said, ""too great a the empty seats of the angels are filled with no other kind of people, but thirty-seven jubilees we shall have the final judgment, and Cusanus shall be deceived in his conjectures. I'll let you know early. But if you have some muid of good wine, gladly I will receive the present. Which they willingly did, and sent him some of the best in town, and drank well enough. But poor Panurge drank it valiantly, for it was considered [6] like a herring. So he walked like a skinny cat. And someone admonished him, half-breathing a great goblin full of vermilion wine, saying: “Comrade, all beautiful! you rage to smell[7].","So if any one man or woman said, ‘Let us drink,’ they all did so; if, ‘Let us have a game,’ they all did so; if, ‘Let us go into the fields for some sport,’ they all went. Whenever it was for hawking or hunting, the ladies, mounted on their beautiful familiar-horses and accompanied by their proud palfreys, each bore on her gloved hand a sparrow-hawk, a lannet or a merlin. The men bore the other types of bird. All had been educated so nobly that there was not a man or woman amongst them but could read and write, sing, play musical instruments and speak five or six languages in which they composed both prose and verse. Never were there seen knights like these: so stout-hearted, so gallant, so full of dexterity on horse and foot, so vigorous, more active, or more talented in the handling of every sort of weapon. Never were there seen ladies like these: so neat, so dainty, less froward, more accomplished with their hands, with the needle, or at every activity which is womanly, honourable and free. That is why, when the time arrived that any man in that Abbey should wish to leave: at the request of his parents or for some other reason), he took one of the ladies with him – the one who had accepted him as her suitor – and they wedded each other; and so well had they dwelt together in Thélème in loving-friendship that they continued all the more to do so in marriage, loving each other as much at the end of their lives as on the first day of their wedding.","And indeed they would have made him thereupon Master of the Requests, and President in the Court: but he refused all, very graciously thanking them for their offer, for (said he) there is too much slavery in these offices, and very hardly can they be saved that do exercise them, considering the great corruption that is amongst men: which makes me beleeve, if the empty seats of Angels be not fil’d with other kind of people then those, we shall not have the final judgement these seven thousand sixty and seven jubilees yet to come; and so Cusanus will be deceived in his conjecture : Remember that I have told you of it, and given you faire advertisement in time and place convenient. But if you have any hogsheads of good wine, I willingly will accept of a present of that, which they very heartily did do, in sending him of the best that was in the City, and he drank reasonably well, but poor Panurge bibbed and bowsed of it most villainously, for he was as dry as a red-herring, as lean as a rake, and like a poor, lank, slender cat, walked gingerly as if he had trod upon egges: so that by some one being admonished, in the midst of his draught of a large deep bowle, full of excellent Claret, with these words, Faire and softly, Gossip, you suck up as if you were mad ; I give thee to the devil, (said he)"

"« Il me souvient qu’on camp de Stokolm, un Gascon, nommé Gratianauld, natif de Saint-Sever, ayant perdu au jeu tout son argent, et de ce grandement fâché (comme vous savez que pecunia est alter sanguis) à l’issue du brelan, devant tous ses compagnons, disait à haute voix : « Pao cap de bious, hillots, que mau de pippe bous tresbire ! ares que pergudes sont les mies bingt et quouatte baguettes, ta pla donnerien picz, trucs et patacts. Sei degun de bous aulx, qui boille truquar ambe iou à bels embis[7] ? » Ne répondant personne, il passe au camp des Hondrespondres[8], et réitérait ces mêmes paroles, les invitant à combattre avec lui. Mais les susdits disaient : Der guascongner thut schich usz mitt eim ieden ze schlagen, aber er ist geneigter zu staelen ; darumb, lieben frauven, hend serg zu ineuerm hausraut[9] ! » Et ne s’offrit au combat personne de leur ligue. Pourtant passe le Gascon au camp des aventuriers français, disant ce que dessus et les invitant au combat gaillardement, avec petites gambades gasconiques. Mais personne ne lui répondit. Lors le Gascon, au bout du camp, se coucha près les tentes du gros Christian, chevalier de Crissé, et s’endormit. Sur l’heure un aventurier, ayant pareillement perdu tout son argent, sortit avec son épée, en ferme délibération de combattre avec le Gascon, vu qu’il avait perdu comme lui :","“I remember that we camped in Stokolm, a Gascon, named Gratianauld, a native of Saint-Sever, having lost all his money gambling, and so very angry (as you know that pecunia is alter sanguis) at the end du brelan, in front of all his companions, said aloud: ""Pao cap de bious, hillots, que mau de pippe bous tresbire!"" ares that pergudes are the crumbs bingt and quouatte baguettes, your pla donien picz, tricks and patacts. Sei degun de bous aulx, qui boille truquar ambe iou à bels embis[7]? ” Answering no one, he went to the camp of the Hondrespondres[8], and repeated these same words, inviting them to fight with him. But the aforesaid said: Der guascongner thut schich usz mitt eim ieden ze schlagen, aber er ist geneigter zu staelen; darumb, lieben frauven, hend serg zu ineuerm hausraut[9]! And no one from their league offered to fight. Yet passes the Gascon to the camp of the French adventurers, saying what's on it and inviting them into combat cheerfully, with little Gasconic gambols. But no one answered him. Then the Gascon, at the end of the camp, slept near the tents of fat Christian, Chevalier de Crissé, and fell asleep. Immediately an adventurer, having similarly lost all his money, came out with his sword, in firm deliberation to fight with the Gascon, seeing that he had lost like him:","For I remember that there was in the camp at Stockholm a Gascon called Gratianauld, a native of Saint-Sever; who, having gambled away all his money, was deeply disturbed since as you know, money is a second blood, as Antonius de Butrio states in the canon, “Acceding”, Extravagantes: 2, “As in Litigation not Contestable”, and Baldus, on the Law, “If to Yours”, Codex: “On Work by Freed Slaves”, in the note; and the Law, “The Advocates” , Codex: “Of Advocates of Divers Judgements” – Wealth is the life of Man and the best guarantor in hardships. ‘As he staggered away from the gamesters he yelled out loud in front of all his comrades, in the Gascon patois: ‘“By God’z head, you fellows, may barrel-fever bite ‘ee! Now that I’ve lost my four-and-twenty pence I can bash and batter all the better. Would anyone like to have a go at me [in a bit of sport]?” ‘Since nobody reacted, he went on to the camp at the Hondrespondres and repeated the same words, challenging them to come and have a fight. But the Hondrespondres said: ‘“Der Guascongner thut schich usz mitt eim jedem ze schlagen, aber er ist geneigter zu staelen; darumb, lieben frauuven, hend serg zu inuerm hausraut.” (“That Gascon would like to have a fight with each one of us, but he would rather steal. So, women dear, look out for the baggage.”) ‘Not one of their league offered to fight him. And so that Gascon went over to the camp of the French soldiers-of-fortune, repeating what he had said before and, with little Gascon jigs, gaily challenging them to a fight. But nobody took him up. Thereupon the Gascon lay down at the edge of the camp near the tents of that stout knight Christian de Crissé and dropped off to sleep. ‘About then a soldier-of-fortune (who had also lost all his money the same way) came forth, sword in hand; simply because he too had been a loser, he was quite determined to take on that Gascon.","Pecunia est vita hominis et optimus fidejussor in necessitatibus : Did, at his coming forth of the Gaming-House, in the presence of the whole Company that was there, with a very loud Voice, speak in his own Language these following words: Pao cap de bious, hillotz, que maulx de pippe bous tresbyre; ares que pergudes sont les mies bingt et quouatte baguettes, ta pla donnerien picz, truez et pataetz. Sey degun de bous aulx qui boille truquar ambe iou à belz embiz. Finding that none would make him any Answer, he passed from thence to that part of the Leaguer, where the huff, snuff, honder-sponder, swash-buckling High-Germans were, to whom he renewed these very Terms, provoking them to fight with him; but all the Return he had from them to his stout Challenge was only Der Guascogner thut schich usz mitt eim jedem ze schlagen, aber er ist geneigter zu staelen; darumb, lieben fravven, hend serg zu unserm hausraut. Finding also, that none of that Band of Teutonick Soldiers offered himself to the Combat, he passed to that quarter of the Leaguer where the French Free-booting Adventurers were encamped, and reiterating unto them, what he had before repeated to the Dutch Warriours, challenged them likewise to fight with him, and therewithal made some pretty little Gasconado frisking Gambols, to oblige them the more cheerfully and gallantly to cope with him in the Lists of a Duellizing Engagement; but no Answer at all was made unto him. Whereupon the Gascon despairing of meeting with any Antagonists, departed from thence, and laying himself down, not far from the Pavilions of the grand Christian Cavalier, Crissie, fell fast asleep. When he had throughly slept an hour or two, another adventurous and all-hazarding Blade of the Forlorn Hope of the lavishingly wasting Gamesters, having also lost all his Moneys, sallied forth with a Sword in his Hand, of a firm Resolution to fight with the aforesaid Gascon seeing he had lost as well as he."
"« J’ai trouvé ici un tarande de Scythie, animal étrange et merveilleux à cause des variations de couleur en sa peau et poil, selon la distinction des choses prochaines[23]. Vous le prendrez en gré. Il est autant maniable et facile à nourrir qu’un agneau. Je vous envoie pareillement trois jeunes unicornes[24], plus domestiques et apprivoisées que ne seraient petits chatons. J’ai conféré avec l’écuyer et dit la manière de les traiter. Elles ne pâturent en terre, obstant[25] leur longue corne on[26] front. Force est que pâture elles prennent ès arbres fruitiers ou en râteliers idoines[27], ou en main, leur offrant herbes, gerbes ; pommes, poires, orge, touzelle[28], bref toutes espèces de fruits et légumages[29]. Je m’ébahis comment nos écrivains antiques les disent tant farouches, féroces et dangereuses, et onques vives[30] n’avoir été vues.

You will take it for granted. It is as manageable and easy to feed as a lamb. I am also sending you three young unicorns[24], more domestic and tame than little kittens would be. I conferred with the squire and told how to treat them. They do not graze in the ground, obstant[25] their long horn on[26] forehead. Force is that they take pasture from fruit trees or suitable racks[27], or in hand, offering them herbs, sheaves; apples, pears, barley, touzelle[28], in short all kinds of fruits and vegetables[29]. I am amazed how our ancient writers say they are so savage, ferocious and dangerous, and never seen alive[30]. If it seems good to you, you will try the opposite and find that in them consists the greatest trifle [31] in the world, provided that one maliciously offends them.","I have discovered here a tarand from Scythia, a beast which is strange and wonderful because it changes the colour of its hair and hide according to the different things it approaches. You will find it interesting: it is as easy as a lamb to handle and feed. I also send you three young unicorns which are more domesticated and tractable than little kittens. I have conferred with the esquire and told him how to treat them. They cannot eat anything off the ground, since the long horn on their foreheads gets in their way. They are obliged to seek their food from fruit-trees, from adapted mangers or else from your hand if you proffer them grasses, blades of corn, apples, pears, barley, white-wheat, in short all kinds of fruits and vegetables. It amazes me how our ancient authors call them ferocious, savage and dangerous, and state that they are never spotted alive. You might like, if it seems fit, to make proof of the contrary: you will find that – provided they are not spitefully provoked – there exists in them the greatest mildness in the world.","I have found here a Scythian Tarand, an Animal strange and wonderful for the variations of colour on its Skin and Hair, according to the distinction of neighbouring Things; It is as tractable and easily kept as a Lamb; be pleased to accept of it. I also send you three young Unicorns, which are the tamest of Creatures. I have confer’d with the Esquire, and taught him how they must be fed; these cannot graze on the Ground, by reason of the long Horn on their Fore-head, but are forced to brouze on Fruit-Trees, or on proper Racks, or to be fed by Hand with Herbs, Sheaves, Apples, Pears, Barly, Rye, and other Fruits, and Roots being plac’d before them. I am amazed that Ancient Writers should report them to be so Wild, Furious, and Dangerous, and never seen alive: Far from it, you will find that they are the mildest things in the World, provided thay are not maliciously offended."

"« Souvenir assez vous peut comment Gargantua, mon père, lequel par honneur je nomme, nous a souvent dit les écrits de ces ermites jeûneurs autant être fades, jejunes[15] et de mauvaise salive comme étaient leurs corps, lorsqu’ils composaient, et difficile chose être, bons et sereins rester les esprits, étant le corps en inanition, vu que les philosophes et médecins affirment les esprits animaux sourdre, naître et pratiquer[16] par le sang artériel, purifié et affiné à perfection dedans le rets admirable qui gît sous les ventricules du cerveau. Nous baillant exemple d’un philosophe, qui en solitude pensant être et hors la tourbe, pour mieux commenter, discourir et composer, cependant toutefois autour de lui aboyent les chiens, ullent[17] les loups, rugissent les lions, hennissent les chevaux, barrissent les éléphants, sifflent les serpents, braient les ânes, sonnent les cigales, lamentent les tourterelles, c’est-à-dire, plus était troublé que s’il fût à la foire de Fontenay ou Niort, car la faim était on[18] corps, pour à laquelle remédier aboie l’estomac, la vue éblouit, les veines sucent de la propre substance des membres carniformes et retirent en bas cetui esprit vagabond, négligent du traitement de son nourrisson et hôte naturel, qui est le corps, comme si l’oiseau, sur le poing étant, voulait en l’air son vol prendre et incontinent par les longes serait plus bas déprimé. Et à ce propos, nous alléguant l’autorité d’Homère, père de toute philosophie, qui dit les Grégeois lors, non plus tôt, avoir mis à leurs larmes fin du deuil de Patroclus, le grand ami d’Achilles, quand la faim se déclara et leurs ventres protestèrent plus de larmes ne les fournir, car en corps exinanis[19] par trop long jeûne, plus n’était de quoi pleurer et larmoyer.","“Remember enough you can how Gargantua, my father, whom by honor I name, has often told us the writings of these fasting hermits as much to be bland, young[15] and of bad saliva as were their bodies, when they composed, and difficult thing to be, good and serene to remain the spirits, being the body in inanition, seeing that the philosophers and doctors affirm the animal spirits to arise, to be born and to practice[16] by the arterial blood, purified and refined to perfection within the admirable net which lies beneath the ventricles of the brain. Giving us the example of a philosopher, who in solitude thinking he was and out of the peat, the better to comment, discourse and compose, nevertheless all around him the dogs bark, the wolves roar, the lions roar, the horses neigh, trumpet the elephants, hiss the snakes, bray the donkeys, ring the cicadas, lament the doves, that is to say, he was more disturbed than if he were at the fair in Fontenay or Niort, for hunger was on. 18] body, for which remedy barks the stomach, the sight dazzles, the veins suck of the own substance of the carniform limbs and draw down this wandering spirit, neglectful of the treatment of its infant and natural host, which is the body, as if the bird, on the fist being, wanted in the air its flight to take and incontinent by the tethers would be below depressed. And in this regard, alleging to us the authority of Homer, father of all philosophy, who says the people of Greece then, no sooner, have put an end to their tears of mourning for Patroclus, the great friend of Achilles, when hunger declared itself and their bellies protested, no more tears could supply them, because in bodies exinanis[19] by too long a fast, there was nothing left to weep and cry.","‘You may recall that my father Gargantua (whom with respect I mention) often told us that the writings of such jejuna-ting hermits were as insipid, jejune and vilely salivating as were their bodies when they wrote them, and that it is hard for a man’s spirits to be good and serene when his body is in a state of inanition, seeing that the philosophers and physicians affirm that our animal spirits arise, are born and act through our arterial blood, purified and refined to perfection in the rete mirabile which lies beneath the ventricles of the brain. They cite us the example of a philosopher who, the better to mediate, reason and write, persuades himself that he is in solitude, far from the crowd, yet all about him dogs are barking, wolves howling, lions roaring, horses whinnying, elephants trumpeting, snakes hissing, asses braying, grasshoppers stridulating, turtle-doves uttering their lamentations: that is to say, he is more disturbed than he would be at the fairs of Fontenay or Niort because hunger is in his stomach: to remedy which, his stomach barks, his eyes are dazzled and his veins suck out some of the substance proper to the flesh-creating organs and draw down the wandering mind which is neglecting to look after its nurseling and natural host which is the body. It is as though a hawk on the fist, wishing to soar into the air and take to its wings, were to be at once hauled back lower by its leash. ‘On this subject they cite the authority of Homer, the Father of all philosophy, who says that the Greeks stopped weeping out of grief for Patroclus, the great friend of Achilles, when, and only when, hunger showed itself and their bellies swore to supply no more tears. For in a body exinantiated by long fasts there remained nothing from which to produce tears to weep.","You may very well remember how my Father Gargantua, (whom here for Honour sake I name) hath often told us, That the Writings of abstinent, abstemious, and long-fasting Hermits, were every whit as saltless, dry, jejune and insipid, as were their Bodies when they did compose them. It is a most difficult thing for the Spirits to be in a good plight, serene and lively, when there is nothing in the Body but a kind of Voidness and Inanity: Seeing the Philosophers with the Physicians jointly affirm, that the Spirits which are styled Animal, spring from, and have their constant practice in and through the Arterial Blood, refin’d and purify’d to the Life within the admirable Net, which, wonderfully framed, lieth under the Ventricles and Tunnels of the Brain. He gave us also the Example of the Philosopher, who, when he thought most seriously to have withdrawn himself unto a solitary Privacy; far from the rusling clutterments of the tumultuous and confused World, the better to improve his Theory, to contrive, comment and ratiocinate, was, notwithstanding his uttermost endeavours to free himself from all untoward noises, surrounded and environ’d about so with the barking of Currs, bawling of Mastiffs, bleating of Sheep, prating of Parrets, tatling of Jackdaws, grunting of Swine, girning of Boars, yelping of Foxes, mewing of Cats, cheeping of Mice, squeaking of Weasils, croaking of Frogs, crowing of Cocks, kekling of Hens, calling of Partridges, chanting of Swans, chattering of Jays, peeping of Chickens, singing of Larks, creaking of Geese, chirping of Swallows, clucking of Moorfowls, cucking of Cuckows, bumbling of Bees, rammage of Hawks, chirming of Linots, croaking of Ravens, screeching of Owls, whicking of Pigs, gushing of Hogs, curring of Pigeons, grumbling of Cushet-doves, howling of Panthers, curkling of Quails, chirping of Sparrows, crackling of Crows, nuzzing of Camels, wheening of Whelps, buzzing of Dromedaries, mumbling of Rabets, cricking of Ferrets, humming of Wasps, mioling of Tygers, bruzzing of Bears, sussing of Kitnings, clamring of Scarfes, whimpring of Fullmarts, boing of Buffalos, warbling of Nightingales, quavering of Meavises, drintling of Turkies, coniating of Storks, frantling of Peacocks, clattering of Magpyes, murmuring of Stock-doves, crouting of Cormorants, cigling of Locusts, charming of Beagles, gnarring of Puppies, snarling of Messens, rantling of Rats, guerieting of Apes, snuttering of Monkies, pioling of Pelicanes, quecking of Ducks, yelling of Wolves, roaring of Lions, neighing of Horses, crying of Elephants, hissing of Serpents, and wailing of Turtles, that he was much more troubled, than if he had been in the middle of the Crowd at the Fair of Fontenoy or Niort. Just so it is with those who are tormented with the grievous pangs of Hunger; the Stomach begins to gnaw, (and bark as it were) the Eyes to look dim, and the Veins, by greedily sucking some Refection to themselves from the proper Substance of all the Members of a Fleshy Consistence: violently pull down and draw back that vagrant roaming Spirit, careless and neglecting of his Nurse and natural Host, which is the Body. As when a Hawk upon the Fist, willing to take her Flight by a soaring aloft into the open spacious Air, is on a sudden drawn back by a Leash tied to her Feet. To this purpose also did he alledge unto us the Authority of Homer, the Father of all Philosophy, who said, that the Grecians did not put an end to their mournful mood for the Death of Patroclus, the most intimate Friend of Achilles, till Hunger in a rage declared her self, and their Bellies protested to furnish no more Tears unto their Grief. For from Bodies emptied and macerated by long Fasting, there could not be such supply of Moisture and brackish Drops, as might be proper on that Occasion."
"« Là vous trouverez que jamais ne serez cocu, c’est-à-dire que jamais votre femme ne sera ribaude, si la prenez issue de gens de bien, instruite en vertu et honnêteté, non ayant hanté ni fréquenté compagnie que de bonnes mœurs, aimant et craignant Dieu, aimant complaire à Dieu par foi et observation de ses saints commandements, craignant l’offenser et perdre sa grâce par défaut de foi et transgression de sa divine loi, en laquelle est rigoureusement défendu adultère et commandé adhérer uniquement à son mari, le chérir, le servir, totalement l’aimer après Dieu. Pour renfort de cette discipline[19], vous, de votre côté, l’entretiendrez en amitié conjugale, continuerez en prud’homie, lui montrerez bon exemple, vivrez pudiquement, chastement, vertueusement en votre ménage, comme voulez qu’elle de son côté vive. Car, comme le miroir est dit bon et parfait, non celui qui plus est orné de dorures et pierreries, mais celui qui véritablement représente les formes objectes[20], aussi celle femme n’est la plus à estimer laquelle serait riche, belle, élégante, extraite de noble race, mais celle qui plus s’efforce avec Dieu soi former en bonne grâce et conformer aux mœurs de son mari. Voyez comment la Lune ne prend lumière ni de Mercure, ni de Jupiter, ni de Mars, ni d’autre planète ou étoile qui soit on[21] ciel ; elle n’en reçoit que du Soleil, son mari, et de lui n’en reçoit point plus qu’il lui en donne par son infusion et aspect[22]. Ainsi serez-vous à votre femme en patron et exemplaire de vertu et honnêteté, et continuellement implorerez la grâce de Dieu à[23] votre protection.","“There you will find that you will never be a cuckold, that is to say that your wife will never be a ribald, if you take her from good people, educated in virtue and honesty, not having haunted nor frequented company except good morals , loving and fearing God, loving to please God by faith and observance of his holy commandments, fearing to offend him and lose his grace through lack of faith and transgression of his divine law, in which adultery is rigorously forbidden and commanded to adhere only to his husband, cherish him, serve him, totally love him after God. To reinforce this discipline[19], you, on your side, will maintain her in conjugal friendship, will continue in prud'homie, will show her a good example, will live modestly, chastely, virtuously in your household, as you want her to from her live side. Because, as the mirror is said to be good and perfect, not the one which is more adorned with gilding and precious stones, but the one which truly represents the object forms[20], so this woman is not the most to be estimated who would be rich, beautiful, elegant, extracted from noble race, but that which more strives with God to form itself in good grace and to conform to the manners of her husband. See how the Moon takes light neither from Mercury, nor from Jupiter, nor from Mars, nor from any other planet or star which is in [21] the sky; she receives only from the Sun, her husband, and from him does not receive more than he gives her by his infusion and appearance. Thus will you be to your wife as a patron and exemplary of virtue and honesty, and continually implore the grace of God for[23] your protection.","There you will find that you will never be a cuckold – that is to say, that your wife will never prove shameless – if you take a woman who is the issue of decent people, one instructed in virtue and in all things honourable, never having haunted nor frequented any but moral company; one loving and fearing God: loving to please God by keeping His holy commandments; fearing to offend Him and forfeit His grace through lack of faith or by any transgression of His holy law, in which adultery is rigorously forbidden and the wife told to cleave to her husband alone, to cherish him, serve him and entirely to love him after God. ‘To reinforce such teachings you for your part must support her in your conjugal love, continue to behave like a wise and decent man and set her a good example: you will live purely, chastely and virtuously within your habitation, just as you wish her, on her part, to live; for it is not the mirror which is highly decorated with gilt and precious jewels that is called good and perfect but the one which most truly reflects the objects set before it: so too that wife is not to be most esteemed who is rich, beautiful, elegant or born from a noble lineage, but she who strives, with God’s help, to form herself in good grace and conform herself to the morals of her husband. Look at the Moon: she does not accept light from Mercury nor Jupiter nor Mars nor any other planet or star in the heavens: she accepts it only from her husband, the Sun, and never receives more than he bestows upon her by infusion while he is turned towards her. And in the same way you will be the model and exemplar of virtue and honour for your wife, and will ceaselessly beseech the grace of God for your protection.’",": There you will find that you shall never be a Cuckold, that is to say your Wife shall never be a Strumpet, if you make choice of one of a commendable Extraction, descended of honest Parents, and instructed in all Piety and Vertue: Such a one as hath not at any time hanted or frequented the Company or Conversation of those that are of corrupt and deprav’d Manners; one loving and fearing God, who taketh a singular delight in drawing near to him by Faith, and the cordial observing of his Sacred Commandments; And finally, one who standing in awe of the Divine Majesty, of the Most High, will be loth to offend Him, and lose the favourable Kindness of his Grace, through any defect of Faith, or transgression against the Ordinances of his Holy Law, wherein Adultery is most rigorously forbidden, and a close Adherence to her Husband alone most strictly and severely enjoyned; yea, in such sort, that she is to cherish, serve and love him above any thing, next to God, that meriteth to be beloved. In the interim, for the better schooling of her in these Instructions, and that the wholsom Doctrin of a Matrimonial Duty may take the deeper root in her Mind, you must needs carry your self so on your part, and your behaviour is to be such, that you are to go before her in a good Example, by entertaining her unfeignedly with a Conjugal Amity, by continually approving your self in all your Words and Actions a faithful and discreet Husband; and by living not only at home, and privately with your own Houshold and Family, but in the face also of all Men, and open view of the World, devotely, vertuously and chastly, as you would have her on her side to deport and demean her self towards you, as becomes a Godly, Loyal, and Respectful Wife, who maketh Conscience to keep inviolable the Tie of a Matrimonial Oath. For as that Looking-glass is not the best, which is most deck’d with Gold and Precious-stones, but that which representeth to the Eye the liveliest Shapes of Objects set before it; even so that Wife should not be most esteemed who richest is, and of the noblest Race, but she who fearing God, conforms her self nearest unto the Humour of her Husband. Consider how the Moon doth not borrow her Light from Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, or any other of the Planets, nor yet from any of those Splendid Stars which are set in the spangled Firmament; but from her Husband only, the bright Sun, which she receiveth from him more or less, according to the manner of his Aspect, and variously bestowed Eradiations. Just so should you be a Pattern to your Wife in Vertue, goodly Zeal and true Devotion; that by your Radiance in darting on her the Aspect of an Exemplary Goodness, she, in your imitation, may outshine the Luminaries of all other Women. To this effect, you daily must implore God’s Grace to the protection of you both."

Qu’est devenu l’art d’évoquer des cieux la foudre et le feu céleste, jadis inventé par le sage Prométhéus ?

"Toute leur vie était employée, non par lois, statuts ou règles, mais selon leur vouloir et franc arbitre. Se levaient du lit quand bon leur semblait, buvaient, mangeaient, travaillaient, dormaient quand le désir leur venait. Nul ne les éveillait, nul ne les parforçait[1] ni à boire, ni à manger, ni à faire chose autre quelconques. Ainsi l’avait établi Gargantua. En leur règle n’était que cette clause :","Their whole life was spent, not by laws, statutes or rules, but according to their will and free will. Got out of bed when they wanted, drank, ate, worked, slept when the desire came to them. No one awoke them, no one forced them[1] to drink, or to eat, or to do anything else whatsoever. So had established Gargantua. In their rule was only this clause:",Law with its gambles Here knows no gambols Where all live in joy. Forensics deploy Where for fat fees scrambles Bad Law with its gambles.,"ALL their life was spent not in lawes, statutes or rules, but according to their own free will and pleasure.

"Là nous dit notre noble lanterne qu’eussions son excuse pour légitime si elle désistait[8] plus avant nous conduire. Seulement qu’eussions à obtempérer es instructions de la pontife Bacbuc, car entrer dedans ne lui était permis, pour certaines causes lesquelles taire meilleur était à gens vivants vie mortelle qu’exposer. Mais, en tout événement, nous commanda être en cerveau, n’avoir frayeur ni peur aucune, et d’elle se confier pour la retraite. Puis tira le diamant pendant à la commissure des deux portes, et à dextre le jeta dedans une capse[9] d’argent, à ce expressément ordonnée, tira aussi de l’esseuil[10] de chacune porte un cordon de soie cramoisine longue d’une toise et demie, auquel pendait le scordon, l’attacha à deux boucles d’or expressément pour ce pendantes et se retira à part.","There our noble lantern tells us that we would have her legitimate excuse if she withdrew[8] further to lead us. Only that we had to obey the instructions of the Pontiff Bacbuc, because entering it was not allowed to him, for certain causes which to keep silent was better for people living mortal life than to expose. But, in any event, ordered us to be in the brain, to have no fright or fear, and to confide in her for the retreat. Then drew the diamond hanging from the corner of the two doors, and on the right threw it into a capse [9] of silver, expressly ordered, also drew from the esseuil [10] of each door a cord of crimson silk long a fathom and a half, from which hung the scordon, fastened it to two golden buckles expressly for this hanging, and retired apart.","Our noble Lantern then told us that, though she now desisted from conducting us any further, we must accept her excuse as legally binding; we merely had to obey the instructions of the High Priestess Bacbuc, for she herself was not allowed to enter in, for specific reasons which it was better to pass over in silence than reveal to anyone living this mortal life. But she commanded us to be on the alert whatever happened, not to be in any way fearful or afraid, and to put our trust in her for our way back. She then tugged at the diamond hanging down where the two doors met, and tossed it to the right into a silver receptacle expressly reserved for it. Then, from the hinges on either side of the gates, she pulled a cord of crimson silk, about a span and a half in length, from which the garlic was suspended; she attached them both to two golden clasps which hung down at the sides precisely for that purpose. She then withdrew.","There our Noble Lantern desir’d us not to take it amiss that she went no further with us, leaving us wholly to the Conduct of the Priestess Bacbuc; for she her self was not allow’d to go in, for certain Causes rather to be conceal’d than reveal’d to Mortals. However, she advis’d us to be resolute and secure, and to trust to her for the Return. She then pull’d the Loadstone that hang’d at the folding of the Gates, and throw’d it into a Silver Box fix’d for that purpose; which done, from the Threshold of each Gate she drew a Twine of Crimsin Silk about nine Foot long, by which the Scordium hang’d, and having fasten’d it to two gold Buckles that hang’d at the sides, she withdrew."

"– Je le veux, dit Panurge. Faudra-t-il peu ou beaucoup souper à ce soir ?

Will we need a little or a lot of supper tonight? I don't ask without cause, because so well and generously, I don't sup, I don't sleep anything worthwhile, the night only daydreams, and as much a hollow dream as my belly was then.","‘I will do that,’ said Panurge. ‘Must I eat a lot or a little for supper this evening? I don’t ask that without a cause: for if I go without a good substantial supper I get no proper sleep and have nothing at night but silly dreams, dreams as hollow then as my belly is.’","I am content, (quoth Panurge,) But I pray you, Sir, must I this Evening, e’re I go to Bed, eat much or little? I do not ask this without Cause: For if I sup not well, large, round and amply, my sleeping is not worth a forked Turnep; all the Night long I then but dose and rave, and in my slumbering Fits talk idle Nonsence, my Thoughts being in a dull brown Study, and as deep in their Dumps as is my Belly hollow."

"En une autre, il avait tout plein d’euphorbe pulvérisée bien subtilement, et là dedans mettait un mouche-nez beau et bien ouvré qu’il avait dérobé à la belle lingère du Palais, en lui ôtant un pou dessus son sein, lequel toutefois il y avait mis. Et quand il se trouvait en compagnie de quelques bonnes dames, il leur mettait sur le propos de lingerie et leur mettait la main au sein, demandant : « Et cet ouvrage, est-il de Flandre ou de Hainaut ? » Et puis tirait son mouche-nez disant : « Tenez, tenez, voyez en ci de l’ouvrage : elle est de Foutignan ou de Foutarabie, » et le secouait bien fort à leur nez, et les faisait éternuer quatre heures sans repos.

"49. Comment Pantagruel descendit on manoir de messer Gaster, premier maître ès arts du monde","49. How Pantagruel Descended to the Manor of Messer Gaster, the World's First Master of Arts","How Pantagruel landed at the manor of Messer Gaster, the first Master of Arts of this world CHAPTER 57 [Rabelais invents a powerful myth in the wake of Calcagnini. First he gave us the ‘Manor of Truth’: now he gives us the ‘Manor of Virtue’. Rabelais retells Hesiod’s famous myth of the hard, stony path leading up to the serene plateau of Virtue (Works and Days, 289ff.). Many Renaissance thinkers sought to discover the prime natural driving-force in this world. Love, Flato shows, links Heaven and Earth; but is not that driving-force. (Ficino, who is not mentioned, taught that it was.) For Rabelais Nature governs this world through the belly, through fear of hunger. In the Prologue to his Satires, Persius calls the Belly the world’s ‘Master of Arts and Dispenser of Genius’. All the earthly arts, crafts and accomplishments of men and beasts derive from him. Rabelais develops that theme. The fifteenth-century Council of Basle led to the Pragmatic Sanctions of Charles VII. It deposed the Pope. It was for Gallicans a favourite Council. Aesop provides a famous fable. Calcagnini, Plutarch and above all Erasmus often overlap and contribute much to this and the following chapters.69]","CHAPTER LVII How Pantagruel went ashoar at the Dwelling of Gaster, the first Master of Arts in the World."
"Peu de jours après, Pantagruel, avoir pris congé du bon Gargantua, lui bien priant pour le voyage de son fils, arriva au port de Thalasse, près Sammalo[1], accompagné de Panurge, Épistémon, frère Jean des Entommeures, abbé de Thélème, et autres de la noble maison, notamment de Xénomanes, le grand voyageur et traverseur des voies périlleuses, lequel était venu au mandement de Panurge, parce qu’il tenait je ne sais quoi en arrière-fief de la châtellenie de Salmigondin. Là arrivés, Pantagruel dressa équipage de navires, à nombre de celles[2] qu’Ajax de Salamine avait jadis menées en convoi des Grégeois à Troie. Nochers, pilotes, hespaliers[3], truchements, artisans, gens de guerre, vivres, artillerie, munitions, robes[4], deniers, et autres hardes prit et chargea, comme était besoin pour long et hasardeux voyage...","A few days later, Pantagruel, having taken leave of the good Gargantua, praying to him for his son's journey, arrived at the port of Thalasse, near Sammalo[1], accompanied by Panurge, Epistemon, brother Jean des Entommoures, abbot of Thélème , and others of the noble house, in particular of Xénomanes, the great traveler and crosser of the perilous ways, which had come to the order of Panurge, because it held I do not know what in back-fief of the châtellenie of Salmigondin. Arrived there, Pantagruel manned ships, many of those [2] which Ajax of Salamis had formerly led in convoy from the Greeks to Troy. Nochers, pilots, hespaliers[3], intermediaries, craftsmen, men of war, provisions, artillery, ammunition, dresses[4], deniers, and other herds took and loaded, as was necessary for a long and hazardous journey...","In Chapters 2 to 5 Panurge, as an expert in rhetoric and the Topics, gave us a display of perverted ingenuity: like a devilish lawyer he could make black seem white. Here again we have a display of great ingenuity, but one which properly reveals (under the veil of an easily pierced enigma), the vast and varied uses which a humble plant can be put to. The apparently miraculous plant pantagruelion is soon perceived to be hemp, or more correctly hemp-and-flax (taken since Pliny to be one and the same plant) together with asbestos, thought of as linum asbestinum, a plant of the same species. Rabelais is taking up a challenge. For Pliny, hemp-and-flax is a natural miracle with a thousand uses too many to relate. Pliny treats of smyrnium olusatrum in his Natural History (19, 8, 48, §62). The immediate inspiration of Rabelais is the short enigmatic praise of hemp-and-flax in Calcagnini’s posthumous Works, where the plant is named Linelaeon. Calcagnini is to prove a major influence on Rabelais in the Fourth Book of 1552. Rabelais’ botanical erudition is not original; it lay mostly in the common domain. ‘Passer-over-Perilous-Ways’ was the name which Jean Bouchet gave himself. Bouchet was a moralizing poet and a long-time friend of Rabelais. They exchanged poems, which Bouchet printed. The ships of Ajax numbered twelve (Iliad, 2, 557).] A few days later Pantagruel, having taken congee of our good Gargantua, who was devoutly praying for his son’s voyage, arrived at the harbour of Thalassa near Saint-Malo accompanied by Panurge, Epistemon, Frère Jean des Entommeures (the Abbot of Thélème) and others of his noble household – notably by Xenomanes the great traveller and Passer-over-Perilous-Ways, who had answered Panurge’s summons since he held some minor property in feudal fee to the Châtellenie of Salmagundi. Once arrived there, Pantagruel fitted out his ships, which numbered as many as Ajax once brought from Salamis to convey the Greeks to Troy. He took on board seamen, pilots, oarsmen, interpreters, craftsmen and fighting men, and loaded provisions, artillery, munitions, clothing, cash and other stores needed for a long and hazardous voyage. I noticed that, amongst other things, he took on plenty of his plant pantagruelion, both the green, untreated kind and the dressed and preserved. The plant called pantagruelion has a small root, somewhat hard and rounded, terminating in a bluntish point, white, of few filaments and penetrating less than a cubit below ground. From the root grows a single, round, ferulaceous stem, green outside, whitish within, hollow like the stalks of smyrnium olusatrum, beans and gentiane, woody, straight, friable, slightly grooved in the manner of shallowly striated columns, full of fibres in which consists the entire merit of the plant, particularly of the kind called mesa (that is to say, middle) and the kind called mylasea. It normally grows to some five or six feet, although it sometimes exceeds the height of a lance, namely when it is found in a soft, greasy, light soil, damp but not cold (as in Les Sables-d’Olonne or the soil in Rosea, near Praeneste in Sabinia) provided it does not lack rain over the Festival of the Fishermen and at the summer solstice; according to Theophrastus it can even exceed the height of trees, as does the tree-mallow, despite its being a plant which dies back annually and not at all a tree with perennial roots, trunk, stem and branches; from its stem grow big, strong branches. It has leaves thrice as long as wide, evergreen, somewhat rough to the touch like prickly-ox-tongue, rather hard, and crenate round the edges like a sickle or like betony, each ending in a point shaped like a Macedonian spear or the lancet which surgeons use. Their shape is not very different from the leaves of the ash or of agrimony and so close to that of the eupatorium that several botanists, having misnamed it ‘garden eupatorium’, have mistaken pantagruelion for wild eupatorium. The leaves grow equidistantly in rows round the stem, five or seven to a row. Nature has so favoured this plant that she has endowed it with leaves of those two uneven numbers, which are so holy and mysterious. To delicate noses the leaves have a strong and unpleasant smell. The seed [comes from near the head of the stem, just a little below. It] is as profuse as that of any plant there is; spherical, oblong or lozenge-shaped, bright black or somewhat tawny, fairly hard, enveloped in a fragile husk, relished by all songbirds such as linnets, goldfinches, larks, canaries, yellow-hammers and so on, but in men it suppresses semen if eaten copiously and often [; and although the Greeks used to make the seeds into some kind of fried tidbit, tarts or fritters nibbled after supper as a delicacy and to enhance the taste of the wine, they are nevertheless difficult to concoct and hard on the stomach; they produce bad-quality blood and, because of their excessive heat, have an impact on the brain, filling the head with troublesome and painful vapours]. And just as there are two sexes in many plants, male and female, as we can see in laurels, palms, oaks, holm-oaks, asphodels, mandrakes, ferns, agarics, aristolochias, cypresses, terebinths, pennyroyals, peonies and so on, in this plant too there is a male, which bears no flowers whatsoever but an abundance of seeds, and a female, which proliferates in little whitish flowerets which serve no useful purpose and produce no worthwhile seeds; and as in similar plants the female’s leaves are broader and not as tough as the male’s, and the female does not grow as high. Pantagruelion is sowed at the first return of the swallow; it is gathered in when the cicada begins to sound hoarse. How this celebrated pantagruelion must be dressed and put to use CHAPTER 50 [There was originally no chapter-break at this point. English versions of some of the Latin names have been slipped in between dashes when it helps things along. The men who earn their living by walking backwards are rope-makers, who move backwards as they entwine the strands of rope fed to them between their legs. Not all the explanations are clear. For example, Aristolochia helps lying-in women with their lochial fluids. Saffron comes from the crocus, which was named after the lover Crocus in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, 4, 283.] Pantagruelion is dressed over the autumn equinox in various ways, depending upon people’s ingenuity and local conditions. The first directions which Pantagruel gave were: to strip the stalk of its leaves and seeds; to macerate it in stagnant – not running – water for five days if the weather is dry and the water warm, or for some nine or twelve if the weather is cloudy and the water cold; then to dry it: in the sun, stripping off the outer layer in the shade and separating the fibres (in which, as we said, consist its excellence and its value) from the woody parts, which are useless except for producing a bright blaze, or as tinder, or, by children at play, for blowing up their pig’s bladders. Wine lovers secretly use them at times as straws for sucking and siphoning new wine through the bung-hole. Some Panta-gruelists nowadays avoid the manual labour involved in separating the plants by using certain contunding machines (constructed in the shape made by ferocious Juno when she interlocked her fingers, heckle-shaped, to impede the birth of Hercules from Alcmene his mother)42 by means of which they break and heckle out the woody part, setting it aside as useless but keeping the fibres. That is the only way to prepare it which satisfies those who (against everyone else’s opinion and in a manner deemed paradoxical by all philosophers) earn their living by walking backwards. Those who desire more evidently to increase its value do what we are told to be the pastime of the three Fatal Sisters [, the nightly diversion of noble Circe] and the long-maintained pretext of Penelope to her fond suitors during the absence of her husband Ulysses. That is how pantagruelion realizes its incalculable properties, some of which I shall expound to you (for to tell you all is for me impossible) if I may first explain its name. Plants are, I find, named for different reasons. Some take their names from whoever first discovered, understood, demonstrated, cultivated, domesticated and acclimatized them: thus, herb-mercury, from Mercury; panace, from Panace, the daughter of Aesculapius; artemisia vulgaris – mugwort – from Artemis (Diana, that is); eupatorium, from King Eupator; sedum telephium – ‘live-long’ – from Telephus; Euphorbia – ‘spurge’ – from Euphorbus, the physician to King Juba; clymenus, from Clymenos; alcibiadon, from Alcibiades; gentian, from Gentius, King of Sclavonia. And that privilege of imposing one’s name on plants thus identified was formerly so highly prized that, just as there once arose a quarrel between Neptune and Pallas over which of them should give its name to the land which they had discovered together – which was subsequently called Athens from Athene (Minerva, that is) – so too Lyncus, King of Scythia, strove treacherously to murder young Triptolemus (who had been despatched to men by Ceres in order to reveal wheat to them, which was then still unknown) so that, having killed him, he could impose his own name on it and to his eternal honour and glory be called the discoverer of that grain which is so useful and so necessary to the life of humankind; for which act of treachery he was metamorphosed by Ceres into a caracal or lynx. Likewise, there were once great and protracted wars waged between certain idle kings in Cappadocia: their sole dispute was over which of their names should be given to a certain plant – valerian – which on account of that conflict was called polemonia, meaning warlike. Other plants have kept the names of the regions from which they were introduced elsewhere, as malum medicum for a citrus fruit from Media where it was first found; malum punicum for pomegranates brought from Punicia (that is, from Carthage); ligusticum (that is, lovage) brought from Liguria (the coast of Genoa); rhabarbarum – rhubarb – from the barbarian river Rha as Ammanianus testifies; and similarly santonica, fenugreek, castanea – chestnuts – mala persica – peaches – and sabina herba – juniper – and stoechas – French lavender – from my Iles d’Hyères, which the Ancients called the Stoechades; then spica celtica – spikenard – and so on. Others take their names by antiphrasis and contradiction; hence absinthe, which is the opposite of pinthe – tipple – because it is not pleasant to drink; or holosteon (meaning ‘all of bone’) – by opposition, for there is no plant in nature which is more brittle and yielding. Others are named from their virtues and effects, as aristolochia, which helps women with their lochial fluids in childbirth; lichen, which cures skin diseases of that name; mallow, which is emollient; callitriche, which beautifies the hair; alyssum, ephemerum, bechium, nasturtium (that is, Orleans cress), hyoscyame, henbane, and so on; others from the remarkable features seen in them, as the heliotrope (that is, the marigold), which follows the sun, opening at sunrise, stretching upwards as the sun ascends, drooping when it sets and closing up when the sun hides itself; the adiantum, since, despite growing close to water, it never retains moisture, even if you plunge it into water for a very long time; hieracia – hawkweed – eryngion and so on; others from the metamorphoses of men and women with similar names, as daphne (that is, the laurel) from Daphne; myrtle, from Myrsine; pitys – pine – from Pitys; cinara (that is, the artichoke); narcissus, saffron, smilax and so on; others, from similarities: as hippuris (that is, horse-tail), because it does resemble a horse’s tail; alopecuros, because it resembles a fox’s tail; psylion, which does look like a flea; delphinium, like a dolphin; bugloss, like an ox’s tongue; iris, which in its flowers is like a rainbow, myosotis, like the ear of a mouse; coronopus, like the foot of a crow; and so on. And, by naming the other way round, the Fabii were called after faba (the bean); the Pisos, from the pea – pisum; the Lentuli, from lentils; the Ciceros from cicer (chick-pea). And from a more intimate resemblance still are named Venus’ navel-wort, Venus’ hair, Venus’ bath-tub, Jupiter’s beard, Jupiter’s eye, Mars’ blood, Mercury’s fingers [, the hermodactyl] and so on; others, from their shapes, as the trefoil, which has three leaves; the pentaphyllon, which has five leaves; the serpolet, which snakes over the ground; helxine, petasites – sun-cap – myrobalans – plums – which the Arabs call béen since they resemble acorns and are oily. Why this plant is called pantagruelion, and of its wonderful qualities CHAPTER 51","WITHIN very few days after that Pantagruel had taken his leave of the good Gargantua, who devoutly prayed for his Sons happy Voyage, he arrived at the Sea-Port, near to Sammalo, accompanied with Panurge, Epistemon, Friar Ihon of the Funnels, Abbot of Theleme, and others of the Royal House, especially with Xenomanes the great Traveller, and Thwarter of dangerous ways, who was come at the bidding and appointment of Panurge, of whose Castlewick of Salmigondin he did hold some petty Inheritance by the Tenure of a Mesnefee. Pantagruel being come thither, prepared and made ready for launching a Fleet of Ships, to the number of those which Ajax of Salamine had of old equipped, in Convoy of the Grœcian Soldiery against the Trojan State. He likewise picked out for his use so many Mariners, Pilots, Sailors, Interpreters, Artificers, Officers and Soldiers, as he thought fitting; and therewithal made Provision of so much Victuals of all sorts, Artillery, Munition of divers kinds, Cloaths, Moneys, and such other Luggage, Stuff, Baggage, Chaffer and Furniture, as he deemed needful for carrying on the Design of a so tedious, long and perillous Voyage. Amongst other things, it was observed, how he caused some of his Vessels to be fraught and loaded with a great quantity of an Herb of his called Pantagruelion, not only of the green and raw sort of it, but of the confected also, and of that which was notably well befitted for present use after the fashion of Conserves. The Herb Pantagruelion hath a little Root somewhat hard and ruff, roundish, terminating in an obtuse and very blunt Point, and having some of its Veins, Strings or Filaments coloured with some spots of white, never fixeth it self into the ground above the profoundness almost of a Cubit, or Foot and a half; from the Root thereof proceedeth the only Stalk, orbicular, canelike, green without, whitish within, and hollow like the Stem of Smyrnium, Olus Atrum, Beans and Gentian, full of long threds, streight, easie to be broken, jogged, snipped, nicked and notched a little after the manner of Pillars and Columns, slightly furrowed, chamfered, guttred and channel’d, and full of Fibres, or Hairs like Strings, in which consisteth the chief Value and Dignity of the Herb, especially in that part thereof which is termed Mesa, as he would say the Mean; and in that other which hath got the Denomination of Milasea. Its height is commonly of five or six Foot; yet sometimes it is of such a tall Growth, as doth surpass the length of a Lance, but that is only when it meeteth with a sweet, easie, warm, wet and well-soaked Soil, (as is the ground of the Territory of Olone, and that of Rosea, near to Preneste in Sabinia) and that it want not for Rain enough about the Season of the Fishers Holydays, and the Estival Solstice. There are many Trees whose Height is by it very far exceeded, and you might call it Dendromalache by the Authority of Theophrastus. The Plant every year perisheth; the Tree, neither in the Trunk, Root, Bark or Boughs, being durable. From the Stalk of this Pantagruelian Plant there issue forth several large and great Branches, whose Leaves have thrice as much length as breadth, always green, roughish and rugged like the Alcanet, or Spanish Buglose, hardish, slit round about like unto a Sickle, or as the Saxifragum, Betony, and finally ending as it were in the Points of a Macedonian Spear, or of such a Lancet as Surgeons commonly make use of in their Phlebotomizing Tiltings. The figure and shape of the Leaves thereof is not much different from that of those of the Ash-tree, or of Egrimony; the Herb it self so being like the Eupatorian Plant, that many skilful Herbalists have called it the Domestick Eupator, and the Eupator the wild Pantagruelion. These Leaves are in equal and parallel Distances spread around the Stalk, by the number in every Rank either of Five or Seven, Nature having so highly favoured and cherish’d this Plant, that she hath richly adorned it with these two odd, divine and mysterious Numbers. The Smell thereof is somewhat strong, and not very pleasing to nice, tender, and delicate Noses: The Seed inclosed therein mounteth up to the very top of its Stalk, and a little above it. This is a numerous Herb; for there is no less abundance of it than of any other whatsoever. Some of these Plants are Spherical, some Romboid, and some of an oblong shape, and all of those either black, bright-coloured or tawny, rude to the touch, and mantled with a quickly-blasted-away Coat, yet such a one as is of a delicious Taste and Savour to all shrill and sweetly singing Birds, such as Linnets, Goldfinches, Larks, Canary-Birds, Yellowhammers, and others of that Airy chirping Quire; but it would quite extinguish the Natural Heat and Procreative Vertue of the Semence of any Man, who would eat much, and often of it. And although, that, of old, amongst the Greeks there was certain kinds of Fritters and Pancakes, Buns and Tarts made thereof, which commonly for a lickuorish Daintiness were presented the Table after Supper, to delight the Palat, and make the Wine relish the better. Yet is it of a difficult Concoction, and offensive to the Stomach; for it engendreth bad and unwholsom Blood, and with its exorbitant Heat woundeth them with grievous, hurtful, smart and noysom Vapours. And as in divers Plants and Trees there are two Sexes, Male and Female, which is perceptible in Lawrels, Palms, Cypresses, Oaks, Holmes, the Daffadil, Mandrake, Fearn, the Agarick, Mushrum, Birtwort, Turpentine, Penny-royal, Peony, Rose of the Mount, and many other such like. Even so, in this Herb there is a Male which beareth no Flower at all, yet it is very copious of, and abundant in Seed. There is likeways in it a Female, which hath great store and plenty of whitish Flowers, serviceable to little or no purpose; nor doth it carry in it Seed of any worth at all, at least comparable to that of the Male."
"– Par Dieu, dit Panurge, vous n’aurez de moi denier ni maille, mais je vous prie, beau sire, menez-nous à ces Apedeftes, car nous venons du pays des savants, où je n’ai guère gagné. »","“By God,” said Panurge, “you will have no penny or mail from me, but I beg you, handsome sire, lead us to these Apedeftes, for we come from the country of the learned, where I have hardly won. »","He then said to Pantagruel that beds were much cheaper here than in the Chinonais, despite our having the celebrated Pautille geese, since that old woman had merely asked five dozen pence for a bed which in the Chinonais would fetch a dozen francs at least.12",A Measure to which the Molossi of Epirus danc’d a certain Morice.

"Après, en tel train d’étude le mit qu’il ne perdait heure quelconque du jour : ains[1] tout son temps consommait en lettres et honnête savoir. S’éveillait donc Gargantua environ quatre heures du matin. Cependant qu’on le frottait, lui était lue quelque pagine[2] de la divine Écriture, hautement et clairement, avec prononciation compétente àla matière, et à ce était commis un jeune page, natif de Basché, nommé Anagnostes. Selon le propos et argument de cette leçon, souventes fois s’adonnait à révérer, adorer, prier et supplier le bon Dieu, duquel la lecture montrait la majesté et jugements merveilleux.","Afterwards, he was put in such a train of study that he never lost any hour of the day: thus [1] all his time was consumed in letters and honest knowledge. So Gargantua awoke about four o'clock in the morning. While he was being rubbed, some pagina[2] of the divine Scripture was read to him, loudly and clearly, with competent pronunciation on the matter, and to this was committed a young page, a native of Basché, named Anagnostes. According to the subject and argument of this lesson, often times he devoted himself to revere, adore, pray and beg the good God, whose reading showed the majesty and marvelous judgments.","Ponocrates then set him such a course of study that he never wasted one hour in any day but devoted his entire time to letters and honourable learning. Gargantua therefore woke up at about four a.m. While he was being rubbed down, a passage of Holy Scripture was read out to him, loud and clear, with a delivery appropriate to the matter. A young page was appointed to do it: a native of Basché called Anagnostes. Following the theme and content of the lesson, Gargantua would often devote himself to revering, worshipping, supplicating and adoring God in his goodness, whose majesty and marvellous judgements were revealed by the reading.","Afterwards he put himself into such a road and way of studying, that he lost not any one houre in the day, but employed all his time in learning, and honest knowledge. Gargantua awaked them about foure a clock in the morning: whilest they were in rubbing of him, there was read unto him some chapter of the holy Scripture aloud and clearly, with a pronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto was appointed a young page borne in Basche, named Anagnostes. According to the purpose and argument of that lesson, he oftentimes gave himself to worship, adore, pray, and send up his supplications to that good God, whose Word did shew his majesty and marvellous judgement."

"Le philosophe raconte, en mouvant la question par quoi c’est que l’eau de la mer est salée, qu’au temps que Phébus bailla le gouvernement de son chariot lucifique[4] à son fils Phaéton, ledit Phaéton, mal appris en l’art et ne sachant ensuivre la ligne écliptique[5] entre les deux tropiques de la sphère du soleil, varia de son chemin, et tant approcha de terre qu’il mit à sec toutes les contrées subjacentes, brûlant une grande partie du ciel que les philosophes appellent via lactea, et les lifrelofres[6] nomment le chemin saint Jacques, combien que les plus huppés poètes disent être la part où tomba le lait de Junon, lorsqu’elle allaita Hercule. Adonc la terre fut tant échauffée qu’il lui vint une sueur énorme, dont elle sua toute la mer, qui par ce est salée, car toute sueur est salée, ce que vous direz être vrai, si vous voulez tâter[7] de la vôtre propre, ou bien de celle des vérolés quand on les fait suer, ce m’est tout un.","The philosopher recounts, by moving the question by what it is that the water of the sea is salty, that at the time that Phoebus gave the government of his lucific chariot [4] to his son Phaeton, said Phaeton, badly learned in art and not knowing how to follow the ecliptic line[5] between the two tropics of the sphere of the sun, varied from its path, and so approached the earth that it dried up all the subjacent countries, burning a large part of the sky which the philosophers call via lactea, and the lifrelofres[6] call the road to Saint James, how many that the most posh poets say is the part where the milk of Juno fell, when she suckled Hercules. So the earth was so heated that an enormous sweat came to it, from which it sweated the whole sea, which for that reason is salty, for all sweat is salty, which you will say to be true, if you want to feel[7] the your own, or that of the pox when you make them sweat, that's all one to me.","Away vile Usury’s filthy money-grubbers, Foul beggars, pigs forever with vile snouts in, Fat-cats and Scribes, judicial pettifoggers, Bent, bluff-nosed rascals stuffing coins in coffers, Unsatisfied though thousand crowns are crammed in, All teeth on edge, save when there’s gold to win And pile up high, with lean and hawkish face",", that hath such vertues, properties and prerogatives, and I will be content to pay you a quart of tripes. No, my Masters, no, it is peerlesse, incomparable, and not to be matched; and this am I resolved for ever to maintaine even unto the fire exclusivè. And those that will pertinaciously hold the contrary opinion, let them be accounted Abusers, Predestinators, Impostors and Seducers of the People. It is very true, that there are found in some gallant and stately books, worthy of high estimation, certain occult and hid properties; in the number of which are reckoned Whippot, Orlando furioso, Robert the devil, Fierabras, William without feare, Huon of Bourdeaux, Monteville, and Matabrune: but they are not comparable to that which we speak of; and the world hath well known by infallible experience, the great emolument and utility, which it hath received by this Gargantuine Chronicle; for the Printers have sold more of them in two moneths time, then there will be bought of Bibles in nine years. I therefore (your humble slave) being very willing to increase your solace and recreation yet a little more, do offer you for a Present another book of the same stamp, only that it is a little more reasonable and worthy of credit then the other was; for think not, (unlesse you wilfully will erre against your knowledge) that I speak of it as the Jewes do of the Law; I was not born under such a Planet, neither did it ever befall me to lie, or affirme a thing for true that was not: I speak of it like a lustie frolick Onocrotarie, * I should say Crotenotarie ** of the martyrised lovers and Croquenotarie of love: Quod vidimus, testamur. It is of the horrible and dreadful feats and prowesses of Pantagruel, whose menial servant I have been ever since I was a page till this houre, that by his leave I am permitted to visit my Cowcountrey, and to know if any of my Kindred there be alive. And therefore to make an end of this Prologue, even as I give my selfe to an hundred Pannier-fulls of faire devils, body and soule, tripes and guts, in case that I lie so much as one single word in this whole History: After the like manner, St. Anthonies fire burne you; Mahooms disease whirle you; the squinance with a stitch in your side, and the Wolfe in your stomack trusse you, the bloody flux seize you, the curst sharp inflammations of wilde fire, as slender and thin as Cowes haire, strengthened with quick silver, enter into your fundament, and like those of Sodom and Gomorrha, may you fall into sulphur, fire and bottomlesse pits, in case you do not firmly beleeve all that I shall relate unto you in this present Chronicle. * * * * Onocratal is a bird not much unlike a Swan, which sings like an Asses braying. ** Crotenotaire or notaire crotté, croquenotaire or notaire croqué are but allusions in derision of Protonotaire, which signifieth a Pregnotarie. THE SECOND BOOK CHAPTER I Of the Original and Antiquity of the great Pantagruel. IT will not be an idle nor unprofitable thing, seeing we are at leasure, to put you in minde of the Fountain and Original Source, whence is derived unto us the good Pantagruel; for I see that all good Historiographers have thus handled their Chronicle; not only the Arabians, Barbarians and Latines, but also the gentle Greeks, who were eternal drinkers. You must therefore remark, that at the beginning of the world, (I speak of a long time , it is above fourty quarantaines, or fourty times fourty nights, according to the supputation of the ancient Druids) a little after that Abel was killed by his brother Cain, the earth, imbrued with the blood of the just, was one year so exceeding fertil in all those fruits which it usually produceth to us, and especially in Medlars, that ever since, throughout all ages it hath been called the yeare of the great medlars, for three of them did fill a bushel: in it the Calends were found by the Grecian Almanacks, there was that yeare nothing of the moneth of March in the time of Lent, and the middle of August was in May: in the moneth of October, as I take it, or at least September, (that I may not erre; for I will carefully take heed of that) was the week so famous in the Annals, which they call the week of the three Thursdayes; for it had three of them by meanes of the irregular Leap-yeares, (called Bissextils) occasioned by the Sunnes having tripped and stumbled a little towards the left hand, like a debtor afraid of Serjeants coming right upon him to arrest him: and the Moon varied from her course about five fathom, and there was manifestly seen the motion of trepidation in the firmament of the fixed starres, called Aplanes, so that the middle Pleiade leaving her fellowes, declined towards the Equinoctial, and the starre named Spica, left the constellation of the Virgin to withdraw her self towards the balance known by the name of Libra, which are cases very terrible, and matters so hard and difficult, that Astrologians cannot set their teeth in them; and indeed their teeth had been pretty long if they could have reached thither. However account you it for a truth, that every body then did most heartily eat of those medlars, for they were faire to the eye, and in taste delicious: but even as Noah that holy man, (to whom we are so much beholding, bound and obliged, for that he planted to us the Vine, from whence we have that nectarian, delicious, precious, heavenly, joyful and deifick liquour, which they call the piot or tiplage) was deceived in the drinking of it, for he was ignorant of the great vertue and power thereof: so likewise the men and women of that time did delight much in the eating of that faire great fruit, but divers and very different accidents did ensue thereupon; for there fell upon them all in their bodies a most terrible swelling, but not upon all in the same place, for some were swollen in the belly, and their belly strouted out big like a great tun, of whom it is written ventrem omnipotentem, who were all very honest men, and merry blades: and of this race came St. Fatgulch * and Shrove-tuesday ;** Others did swell at the shoulders, who in that place were so crump and knobbie, that they were therefore called Montifers, (which is as much to say as Hill-carriers,) of whom you see some yet in the world of divers sexes and degrees: of this race came Æsop, some of whose excellent words and deeds you have in writing: some other puffes did swell in length by the member, which they call the Labourer of nature, in such sort that it grew marvellous long, fat, great, lustie, stirring and Crest-risen, in the Antick fashion, so that they made use of it as of a girdle, winding it five or six times about their waste: but if it happened the foresaid member to be in good case, spooming with a full saile, bunt faire before the winde, then to have seen those strouting Champions, you would have taken them for men that had their lances setled on their Rest, to run at the ring or tilting whintam: of these beleeve me the race is utterly lost and quite extinct, as the women say; for they do lament continually, that there are none extant now of those great, &c. you know the rest of the song. Others did grow in matter of ballocks so enormously, that three of them would well fill a sack, able to contain five quarters of wheat, from them are descended the ballocks of Lorraine, which never dwell in Codpieces, but fall down to the bottome of the breeches. Others grew in the legs, and to see them, you would have said they had been Cranes, or the reddish-long -bill’d-storklik’t-scrank-legged sea-fowles, called Flamans, or else men walking upon stilts or scatches: the little Grammar school-boyes (known by the name of Grimos,) called those leg-grown slangams Jambus, in allusion to the French word Jambe, which signifieth a leg. In others, their nose did grow so, that it seemed to be the beak of a Limbeck, in every part thereof most variously diapred with the twinkling sparkles of Crimson-blisters budding forth, and purpled with pimples all enameled with thickset wheales of a sanguine colour, bordered with Queules, and such have you seen the Chanon or Prebend Panzoul, and Woodenfoot the Physician of Angiers: of which race there were few that liked the Ptisane, but all of them were perfect lovers of the pure septembral juice; Naso and Ovid had their extraction from thence, and all those of whom it is written, Ne reminiscaris. Others grew in eares, which they had so big, that out of one would have been stuffe enough got, to make a doublet, a paire of breeches and a jacket, whilest with the other they might have covered themselves as with a Spanish Cloak: and they say, that in Bourbonois this race remaineth yet. Others grew in length of body, and of those came the Giants, and of them Pantagruel. And the first was Chalbroth who begat Sarabroth who begat Faribroth who begat Hurtali, that was a brave eater of pottage, and reigned in the time of the flood. who begat Nembroth who begat Atlas, that with his shoulders kept the sky from falling. who begat Goliah who begat Erix, that invented the Hocus pocus playes of Legerdemain. who begat Titius who begat Eryon who begat Polyphemus who begat Cacos who begat Etion, the first man that ever had the pox, for not drinking fresh in Summer, as Bartachin witnesseth. who begat Enceladus who begat Ceus who begat Tiphœus who begat Alœus who begat Othus who begat Ægeon who begat Briareus that had a hundred hands. who begat Porphyrio who begat Adamastor who begat Anteus who begat Agatho who begat Porus, against whom fought Alexander the great. who begat Aranthas who begat Gabbara, that was the first inventor of the drinking of healths. who begat Goliah of Secondille who begat Offot, that was terribly well nosed for drinking at the barrel-head. who begat Artachœus who begat Oromedon who begat Gemmagog, the first inventor of Poulan shoes, which are open on the foot, and tied over the instep with a latchet. who begat Sisyphus who begat the Titans, of whom Hercules was born. who begat Enay, the most skilful man that ever was, in matter of taking the little wormes (called Cirons) out of the hands. who begat Fierabras, that was vanquished by Oliver Peer of France, and Rowlands Camrade. who begat Morgan, the first in the world that played at dice with spectacles. who begat Fracassus, of whom Merlin Coccaius hath written, and of him was borne Ferragus. who begat Hapmouche, the first that ever invented the drying of neats tongues in the Chimney; for before that, people salted them, as they do now gammons of bacon. who begat Bolivorax who begat Longis who begat Gayoffo, whose ballocks were of poplar, and his pr. . . of the servise or sorb-apple-tree. who begat Maschefain who begat Bruslefer who begat Angoulevent who begat Galehaut the inventor of flaggons. who begat Mirelangaut who begat Gallaffre who begat Salourdin who begat Roboast who begat Sortibrant of Conimbres. who begat Brusbant of Mommiere who begat Bruyer that was overcome by Ogier the Dane Peer of France. who begat Mabrun who begat Foutasnon who begat Haquelebas who begat Vitdegrain who begat Grangousier who begat Gargantua who begat the noble Pantagruel my Master. I know that reading this passage, you will make a doubt within your selves, and that grounded upon very good reason: which is this, how it is possible that this relation can be true, seeing at the time of the flood all the world was destroyed, except Noah, and seven persons more with him in the Ark, into whose number Hurtali is not admitted; doubtlesse the demand is well made, and very apparent, but the answer shall satisfie you, or my wit is not rightly caulked: and because I was not at that time to tell you any thing of my own fancie, I will bring unto you the authority of the Massorets, good honest fellows, true ballokeering blades, and exact Hebraical bag-pipers, who affirm that verily the said Hurtali was not within the Ark of Noah, (neither could he get in, for he was too big) but he sate astride upon it, with one leg on the one side, and another on the other, as little children use to do upon their wooden horses: or as the great Bull of Berne, which was killed at Marinian, did ride for his Hackney the great murthering piece called the Canon-pevier, a pretty beast of a faire and pleasant amble without all question. In that posture, he after God, saved the said Ark from danger, for with his legs he gave it the brangle that was needful, and with his foot turned it whither he pleased, as a ship answereth her rudder. Those that were within sent him up victuals in abundance by a Chimney, as people very thankfully acknowledging the good that he did them; And sometimes they did talk together as Icaromenippus did to Jupiter, according to the report of Lucian. Have you understood all this well? drink then one good draught without water; for if you beleeve it not: no truly do I not, quoth she. * * * * Pansart. ** Mardigras. CHAPTER II Of the Nativity of the most dread and redoubted Pantagruel. GARGANTUA at the age of foure hundred, fourescore fourty, and foure yeares begat his sonne Pantagruel, upon his wife named Badebec, daughter to the King of the Amaurots in Utopia, who died in childe-birth, for he was so wonderfully great and lumpish, that he could not possibly come forth into the light of the world, without thus suffocating his mother. But that we may fully understand the cause and reason of the name of Pantagruel, which at his Baptism was given him, you are to remark, that in that yeare there was so great drought over all the countrey of Affrick, that there past thirty and six moneths, three weeks, foure dayes, thirteen houres, and a little more without raine, but with a heat so vehement, that the whole earth was parched and withered by it : neither was it more scorched and dried up with heat in the dayes of Eliah, then it was at that time; for there was not a tree to be seen, that had either leafe or bloom upon it: the grasse was without verdure or greennesse, the rivers were drained, the fountaines dried up, the poore fishes abandoned and forsaken by their proper element, wandring and crying upon the ground most horribly: the birds did fall down from the aire for want of moisture and dew, wherewith to refresh them: the wolves, foxes, harts, wild-boares, fallow-deer, hares, coneys, weesils, brocks, badgers, and other such beasts were found dead in the fields with their mouthes open; in respect of men, there was the pity, you should have seen them lay out their tongues like hares that have been run six houres: many did throw themselves into the wells: others entred within a Cowes belly to be in the shade; those Homer calls Alibants: all the Countrey was idle, and could do no vertue: it was a most lamentable case to have seen the labour of mortals in defending themselves from the vehemencie of this horrifick drought; for they had work enough to do to save the holy water in the Churches from being wasted; but there was such order taken by the counsel of my Lords the Cardinals, and of our holy Father, that none did dare to take above one lick: yet when any one came into the Church, you should have seen above twenty poor thirsty fellows hang upon him that was the distributer of the water, and that with a wide open throat, gaping for some little drop, (like the rich glutton in Luke,) that might fall by, lest any thing should be lost. O how happy was he in that yeare, who had a coole Cellar under ground, well plenished with fresh wine! The Philosopher reports in moving the question, wherefore it is that the sea-water is salt? that at the time when Phœbus gave the government of his resplendent chariot to his sonne Phaeton, the said Phaeton, unskilful in the Art, and not knowing how to keep the ecliptick line betwixt the two tropicks of the latitude of the Sunnes course, strayed out of his way, and came so near the earth, that he dried up all the Countreys that were under it, burning a great part of the Heavens, which the Philosophers call via lactea, and the Huffsnuffs, St. James his way, although the most coped, lofty, and high-crested Poets affirme that to be the place where Juno’s milk fell, when she gave suck to Hercules. The earth at that time was so excessively heated, that it fell into an enormous sweat, yea such a one as made it sweat out the sea, which is therefore salt, because all sweat is salt; and this you cannot but confesse to be true, if you will taste of your own, or of those that have the pox, when they are put into a sweating, it is all one to me."
"Le mal temps passe et retourne le bon,","The bad time passes and returns the good,","Good weather is raised and the bad weather passes,","While jolly Companions carrouse it together,"
"« Adonc chacun membre se prépare et s’évertue de nouveau à purifier et affiner cetui trésor. Les rognons, par les veines émulgentes, en tirent l’aiguosité[11] que vous nommez urine, et, par les uretères, la découlent en bas. Au bas trouve réceptacle propre, c’est la vessie, laquelle en temps opportun la vide hors. La râtelle en tire le terrestre et la lie, que vous nommez mélancolie. La bouteille du fiel en soustrait la colère superflue. Puis est transporté en une autre officine, pour mieux être affiné, c’est le cœur, lequel par ses mouvements diastoliques et systoliques, le subtilise et enflambe[12] tellement que, par le ventricule dextre, le met à perfection, et par les veines l’envoie à tous les membres. Chacun membre l’attire à soi et s’en alimente à sa guise : pieds, mains, œils, tous, et lors sont faits débiteurs, qui, par avant, étaient prêteurs. Par le ventricule gauche, il le fait tant subtil qu’on le dit spirituel, et l’envoie à tous les membres par ses artères, pour l’autre sang des veines échauffer et éventer. Le poumon ne cesse, avec ses lobes et soufflets, le rafraîchir. En reconnaissance de ce bien, le cœur lui en départit le meilleur par la veine artériale. Enfin, tant est affiné dedans le rets[13] merveilleux que, par après, en sont faits les esprits animaux, moyennant lesquels elle imagine, discourt, juge, résout, délibère, ratiocine[14] et remémore. Vertu guoy[15] ! je me noie, je me perds, je m’égare, quand j’entre on[16] profond abîme de ce monde ainsi prêtant, ainsi devant. Croyez que chose divine est prêter : devoir est vertu héroïque.","“So each member prepares and strives again to purify and refine this treasure. The kidneys, through the emulgent veins, draw from it the sharpness [11] which you call urine, and, through the ureters, flow it downwards. At the bottom finds its own receptacle, it is the bladder, which in due time empties it out. The rake draws from it the earthly and the dregs, which you call melancholy. The bottle of gall subtracts superfluous anger. Then is transported to another pharmacy, to be better refined, it is the heart, which by its diastolic and systolic movements, subtilizes it and inflames[12] so much that, by the dexter ventricle, brings it to perfection, and by the veins sends it to all members. Each member draws it to himself and feeds on it as he pleases: feet, hands, eyes, all, and then are made debtors, who, before, were lenders. Through the left ventricle, he does it so subtle that it is said to be spiritual, and sends it to all the members through his arteries, for the other blood from the veins to warm and fan. The lung does not cease, with its lobes and bellows, to refresh it. In recognition of this good, the heart gives it the best of it through the arterial vein. Finally, so much is refined within the marvelous net[13] that, afterwards, animal spirits are made of it, by means of which it imagines, discourses, judges, resolves, deliberates, ratiocine[14] and remembers. Virtue guoy[15]! I drown, I lose myself, I get lost, when I enter one [16] deep abyss of this world thus lending, thus before. Believe that divine thing is to lend: duty is heroic virtue.",", Whereupon each member readies itself and strives afresh to purify and refine that treasure. The kidneys strain out through the emulgent veins the fluid which you call urine and send it flowing down. There below it finds a specific vessel, the bladder, which voids it when appropriate. The spleen draws off the grounds and the lees which you call black bile. The gall-bag extracts from them the excess of yellow bile. ‘The blood is then conveyed to another smithy to be further refined, that is, to the heart, which by means of its diastolic and systolic motions so well rarefies and calorifies it that it is brought to perfection by the right ventricle and dispatched to all the members through the veins. They – feet, hands, eyes, the lot – draw it to themselves and each in its own way finds nourishment in it: and so they which were lenders are turned into debtors. The heart, by means of the left ventricle, then renders it so refined that it is turned into what is called spiritous blood, which is then dispatched through the arteries to all the members in order to heat and ventilate the other kind of blood which is in the veins. The lungs ceaselessly keep it fresh with their lobes and bellows. Out of gratitude for this service the heart separates out the best of the blood and sends it back through the arterial vein. Lastly it is so refined within the rete mirabile that from it are eventually made the animal spirits thanks to which the soul imagines, discourses, judges, resolves, deliberates, ratiocinates and remembers. ‘Golly! When I enter into the deep abyss of that lending, owing world, I am drowned, lost and lose my way! Believe you me: to lend is an act divine, and to owe is an heroic virtue.","No greater is the Joy of Alchimists, when after long Travel, Toil and Expence, they see in their Furnaces the Transmutation: Then is it that every Member doth prepare it self, and strive a-new to purifie and to refine this Treasure. The Kidneys through the emulgent Veins draw that Aquosity from thence which you call Urine, and there send it away through the Ureters to be slipt downwards; where, in a lower Receptacle, and proper for it, (to wit, the Bladder) it is kept, and stayeth there until an opportunity to void it out in his due time. The Spleen draweth from the Blood its Terrestrial part, viz. The Grounds, Lees or thick Substance setled in the bottom thereof, which you term Melancholy: The Bottle of the Gall subtracts from thence all the superfluous Choler; whence it is brought to another Shop or Work-house to be yet better purified and fined, that is, the Heart, which by its agitation of Diastolick and Systolick Motions so neatly subtilizeth and inflames it, that in the right side Ventricle it is brought to perfection, and through the Veins is sent to all the Members; each parcel of the Body draws it then unto its self, and after its own fashion is cherished and alimented by it: Feet, Hands, Thighs, Arms, Eyes, Ears, Back, Breast, yea, all; and then it is, that who before were Lenders, now become Debtors. The Heart doth in its left side Ventricle so thinnifie the Blood, that it thereby obtains the Name of Spiritual; which being sent through the Arteries to all the Members of the Body, serveth to warm and winnow the other Blood which runneth through the Veins: The Lights never cease with its Lappets and Bellows to cool and refresh it; in acknowledgment of which good the Heart through the Arterial Vein imparts unto it the choicest of its Blood: At last it is made so fine and subtle within the Rete Mirabilis, that thereafter those Animal Spirits are framed and composed of it; by means whereof the Imagination, Discourse, Judgment, Resolution, Deliberation, Ratiocination and Memory have their Rise, Actings and Operations. Cops body, I sink, I drown, I perish, I wander astray, and quite fly out of my self, when I enter into the Consideration of the profound Abyss of this World, thus lending, thus owing. Believe me, it is a Divine thing to lend, to owe an Heroick Vertue."
"Quand Ponocrates connut la vicieuse manière de vivre de Gargantua, délibéra autrement l’instituer en lettres ; mais, pour les premiers jours, le toléra, considérant que nature n’endure mutations soudaines sans grande violence.","When Ponocrates knew the vicious way of life of Gargantua, deliberated otherwise to institute it in letters; but, for the first few days, tolerated it, considering that nature does not endure sudden changes without great violence.","In Greek Theodore means ‘gift of God’; Anagnostes, ‘reader’; and Rhizotome, ‘root-cutter’. Since Gargantua had been literally driven mad, he is first purged by Dr Rabelais with hellebore, the Classical remedy for insanity. The medical adage in the first sentence is straight from the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, which Rabelais edited in 1533 and republished in 1543. The education of the Renaissance prince is here set in Rabelais’ home province of Touraine. In later editions he changes it to Paris. To do so he replaces ‘the Loire at Montsoreau’ by ‘the Seine’, omits completely the reference to the ‘lake at Savigny’ and turns ‘Bessé’ into ‘Saint-Victor’, and ‘Narsay’ into ‘Montmartre’. There were famous tennis-courts at Le Braque. The rare word ‘poppism’ is taken straight from the Latin. It means a clucking sound made to encourage a horse.] Once Ponocrates had taken cognizance of Gargantua’s vicious manner of living, he determined to introduce him to letters by a different method, but he let things go on for the first few days considering that Nature will not endure sudden changes without a strong reaction.","WHEN Ponocrates knew Gargantua’s vicious manner of living, he resolved to bring him up in another kinde; but for a while he bore with him, considering that nature cannot endure a sudden change, without great violence."

"Pantagruel ; préalablement avoir imploré l’aide du grand Dieu servateur, et fait oraison publique en fervente dévotion, par l’avis du pilote tenait l’arbre fort et ferme : frère Jean, s’était mis en pourpoint pour secourir les nochers. Aussi étaient Épistémon, Ponocrates et les autres. Panurge restait le cul sur le tillac, pleurant et lamentant. Frère Jean l’aperçut, passant sur la coursie[1], et lui dit : « Par Dieu, Panurge le veau, Panurge le pleurard, Panurge le criard, tu ferais beaucoup mieux nous aidant ici que là pleurant comme une vache, assis sur tes couillons comme un magot.","Pantagruel; having previously implored the help of the great servant God, and made public prayer in fervent devotion, by the advice of the pilot held the tree strong and firm: Brother Jean, had put on a doublet to help the drivers. Also were Epistemon, Ponocrates and the others. Panurge remained with his ass on the deck, weeping and lamenting. Brother Jean saw him, passing on the courtyard[1], and said to him: ""By God, Panurge the calf, Panurge the cryer, Panurge the screamer, you would do much better helping us here than there, crying like a cow, sitting on your assholes like a nest egg.","The changes, whilst most important, are not individually noted in the variants: they apply every time. There is no space at all between Candes et Monssoreau, two contiguous villages in Rabelais’ pays. That fact gave rise to the local jingle cited in the text.] Pantagruel, [having first implored the aid of our Servator God and offered public prayers in fervent devotion,] on the advice of the pilot held the mast steady and firm. Frère Jean had stripped down to his doublet in order to help the seamen. So too, Epistemon, Ponocrates and the others. Panurge remained with his bum on the deck, yelling and wailing. Frère Jean noticed him as he went along the gallery and said to him, ‘By God! Panurge the little bovine! Panurge the cry-baby! Panurge the blubberer! You’d be better off helping us over here than bellowing like a cow and squatting on your bollocks like a Barbary baboon.’","PANTAGRUEL having first implor’d the help of the Great and Almighty Deliverer, and pray’d publickly with fervent Devotion, by the Pilot’s advice held titely the Mast of the Ship. Fryar Jhon had strip’d himself to his Waistcoat, to help the Seamen. Epistemon, Ponocrates, and the rest did as much. Panurge alone sate on his Breech upon Deck, weeping, and howling. Fryar Jhon espy’d him, going on the Quarter-Deck, and said to him: Odzoons, Panurge the Calf, Panurge the Whiner, Panurge the Brayer, would it not become thee much better to lend us here a helping hand, than to lie lowing like a Cow, as thou dost, sitting on thy Stones like a bald breech’d Baboon?"
Et le mot profère,And the word utters,"Reply, imperious. Pronounce Thou me the heart-felt Word. Soon, soon be thou by all men clearly heard,","Then she opened her Ceremonial Book and whispering in his left Ear, made him sing an Epileny, inserted here in the Figure of the Bottle."
"21. Comment Pantagruel entra en la ville des Amaurotes, et comment Panurge maria le roi Anarche et le fit crieur de sauce vert","21. How Pantagruel Entered the City of the Amaurotes, and How Panurge Married King Anarche, and Made Him Crier of Green Sauce","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Antoninus, a Lackey. Commodus, a Jeat-maker. Pertinax, a peeler of wall-nuts. Lucullus, a maker of rattles and Hawks bells. Justinian, a Pedlar. Hector, a Snap-sauce Scullion. Paris was a poore beggar. Cambyses, a Mule-driver. Nero, a base blinde fidler, or player on that instrument which is called a windbroach: Fierabras was his serving-man, who did him a thousand mischievous tricks, and would make him eat of the brown bread, and drink of the turned wine, when himself did both eate and drink of the best. Julius Cœsar and Pompey were boat-wrights and tighters of ships. Valentine and Orson did serve in the stoves of hell, and were sweat-rubbers in hot houses. Giglan and Govian were poor Swine-herds. Jafrey with the great tooth was a tinder-maker and seller of matches. Godfrey de bullion, a Hood-maker. Jason was a Bracelet-maker. Don Pietro de Castille, a Carrier of Indulgences. Morgan, a beer-Brewer. Huon of Bourdeaux, a Hooper of barrels. Pyrrhus, a Kitchin-Scullion. Antiochus, a Chimney-sweeper. Octavian, a Scraper of parchment. Nerva, a Mariner. Pope Julius was a Crier of pudding pyes, but he left off wearing there his great buggerly beard. John of Paris was a greaser of boots. Arthur of Britain, an ungreaser of caps. Pierce Forrest, a Carrier of fagots. Pope Boniface the eighth, a Scummer of pots. Pope Nicholas the third, a Maker of paper. Pope Alexander, a rat-catcher. Pope Sixtus, an Anointer of those that have the pox. What, (said Pantagruel) have they the pox there too? Surely (said Epistemon) I never saw so many: there are there, I think, above a hundred millions; for beleeve, that those who have not had the pox in this world, must have it in the other. Cotsbody (said Panurge) then I am free; for I have been as farre as the hole of Gibraltar, reached unto the outmost bounds of Hercules, and gathered of the ripest. Ogier the Dane was a Furbisher of armour. The King Tigranes, a mender of thatched houses. Galien Restored, a taker of Moldwarps. The foure sons of Aymon were all tooth-drawers. Pope Calixtus was a barber of a womans Sine quo non. Pope Urban, a bacon-pecker. Melusina was a Kitchin drudge-wench. Mattabrune, a Laundresse. Cleopatra, a Crier of onions. Helene, a broker for Chamber-maids. Semiramis, the Beggars lice-killer. Dido did sell mushrooms. Pentasilea sold cresses. Lucretia was an Ale-house-keeper. Hortensia, a Spinstresse. Livia, a grater of verdigreece. After this manner, those that had been great Lords and Ladies here, got but a poor scurvie wretched living there below. And on the contrary, the Philosophers and others, who in this world had been altogether indigent and wanting, were great lords there in their turne. I saw Diogenes there strout it out most pompously, and in great magnificence, with a rich purple gown on him, and a golden Scepter in his right hand. And which is more, he would now and then make Alexander the great mad , so enormously would he abuse him, when he had not well patched his breeches; for he used to pay his skin with sound bastonadoes; I saw Epictetus there most gallantly apparelled after the French fashion, sitting under a pleasant Arbour, with store of handsom Gentlewomen, frolicking, drinking, dancing, and making good cheare, with abundance of Crowns of the Sunne. Above the lattice were written these verses for his device: To leap and dance, to sport and play, And drink good wine both white and brown: Or nothing else do all the day, But tell bags full of many a Crown. When he saw me, he invited me to drink with him very courteously, and I being willing to be entreated, we tipled and chopined together most theologically. In the mean time came Cyrus to beg one farthing of him for the honour of Mercurie, therewith to buy a few onions for his supper? No, no, said Epictetus, I do not use in my almes-giving to bestow farthings, hold thou Varlet, there’s a crown for thee, be an honest man: Cyrus was exceeding glad to have met with such a bootie; but the other poor rogues, the Kings that are there below, as Alexander, Darius, and others stole it away from him by night. I saw Pathelin the Treasurer of Rhadamantus, who in cheapening the puddingpyes that Pope Julius cried, asked him, How much a dozen? Three blanks (said the Pope:) Nay (said Pathelin) three blowes with a cudgel, lay them down here you rascal and go fetch more: the poor Pope went away weeping, who when he came to his Master the Pye-maker, told him that they had taken away his pudding-pyes ; whereupon his Master gave him such a sound lash with an eele-skin, that his own would have been worth nothing to make bag-pipe-bags of. I saw master John le maire there personate the Pope in such fashion, that he made all the poor Kings and Popes of this world kisse his feet, and taking great state upon him, gave them his benediction, saying, Get the pardons, rogues, get the pardons, they are good cheap: I absolve you of bread and pottage, and dispense with you to be never good for anything: then, calling Caillet and Triboulet, to him, he spoke these words, My Lords the Cardinals, dispatch their bulls, to wit, to each of them a blow with a Cudgel upon the reines, which accordingly was forthwith performed. I heard Master Francis Villon ask Xerxes, How much the messe of mustard? A farthing, said Xerxes: to which the said Villon answered, The pox take thee for a villain: as much of square-ear’d wheat is not worth half that price, and now thou offerest to inhance the price of victuals: with this he pist in his pot as the mustard-makers of Paris used to do. I saw the trained boweman of the bathing tub, (known by the name of the Francarcher de baignolet) who being one of the trustees of the Inquisition, when he saw Pierce Forrest making water against a wall, in which was painted the fire of St. Antonie, declared him heretick, and would have caused him to be burnt alive, had it not been for Morgant, who for his Proficiat and other small fees gave him nine tuns of beer. Well (said Pantagruel,) reserve all these faire stories for another time, only tell us how the Usurers are there handled: I saw them (said Epistemon) all very busily employed in seeking of rustie pins, and old nailes in the kennels of the streets, as you see poor wretched rogues do in this world; but the quintal, or hundred weight of this old iron ware, is there valued but at the price of a cantle of bread, and yet they have but a very bad dispatch and riddance in the sale of it: thus the poor Misers are sometimes three whole weeks, without eating one morsel or crumb of bread, and yet work both day and night, looking for the faire to come: neverthelesse, of all this labour, toile and misery , they reckon nothing, so cursedly active they are in the prosecution of that their base calling, in hopes at the end of the yeare, to earne some scurvie penny by it. Come, (said Pantagruel) let us now make our selves merry one bout, and drink (my Lads) I beseech you, for it is very good drinking all this moneth: then did they uncase their flaggons by heaps and dozens, and with their leaguer-provision made excellent good chear: but the poor King Anarchus could not all this while settle himselfe towards any fit of mirth; whereupon Panurge said, Of what trade shall we make my Lord the King here, that he may be skilful in the Art, when he goes thither to sojourn amongst all the devils of hell? Indeed (said Pantagruel) that was well advised of thee, do with him what thou wilt: I give him to thee: Grammercie (said Panurge) the present is not to be refused, and I love it from you. CHAPTER XXXI"
"Cetui arc finissait en une belle et ample tonnelle, toute faite de ceps de vignes, ornés de raisins de cinq cents couleurs diverses, et cinq cents diverses formes non naturelles, mais ainsi composées par art d’agriculture, jaunes, bleus, tannés, azurés, blancs, noirs, verts, violets, riolés[15], piolés[16], longs, ronds, torangles[17], couillonnés, couronnés, barbus, cabus[18], herbus. La fin d’icelle était close de trois antiques lierres, bien verdoyants et tous chargés de bagues[19]. Là nous commanda notre illustrissime lanterne de ce lierre chacun de nous se faire un chapeau albanais et s’en couvrir toute la tête, ce que fut fait sans demeure. « Dessous, dit lors Pantagruel, cette treille n’eut ainsi jadis passé la pontife de Jupiter.","This arch finished in a beautiful and ample arbor, all made of vines, adorned with grapes of five hundred different colors, and five hundred different shapes not natural, but thus composed by the art of agriculture, yellow, blue, tanned, azure. , white, black, green, purple, riolés[15], piolés[16], long, round, torangles[17], couillonnés, crowned, bearded, capus[18], herbus. The end of it was closed by three ancient ivy, very verdant and all laden with rings[19]. There we ordered our illustrious lantern of this ivy each of us to make an Albanian hat and cover our whole head with it, which was done without a home. “Underneath,” said Pantagruel then, “this arbor had not formerly passed the pontiff of Jupiter.","That arch led to a beautiful and spacious arbour entirely composed of vine-stocks bedecked with grapes of five hundred different colours and five hundred different shapes, not natural ones but ones fashioned thus by the art of agriculture: they were yellow, blue, tawny, azure, white, black, green, violet, striped and variegated; long, round, triangular, bollockal, regal, bearded, snub-nosed, herbal. The end of the arbour was closed by three venerable ivy-bushes, most verdant and laden with berries. There our most illustrious Lantern bade us each make for himself an Albanian hat out of that ivy and to cover his entire head with it. Which was done without delay. ‘The pontiff of Jupiter,’ said Pantagruel, ‘would never have passed beneath that trellis in ancient times.’","This Arch ended at a fine large round Alley, cover’d over with the interlaid Branches of Vines, loaded and adorned with Clusters of five hundred different Colours, and of as many various Shapes, not natural but due to the skill of Agriculture, some were Golden, others Blewish, Tawny, Azure, White, Black, Green, Purple, streak’d with many Colours, Long, Round, Triangular, Cod-like, Hairy, Great-headed, and Grassy. That pleasant Alley ended at three old Ivy-trees verdant, and all loaden with Rings. Our inlightned Lantern directed us to make our selves Hats with some of their Leaves, and cover our Heads wholly with ’em, which was immediately done. Jupiter’s Priestess, said Pantagruel, in former days, would not like us have walk’d under this Arbour."
"– Ne jurons point, dit Panurge, mon père, mon ami, pour cette heure. Demain tant que voudrez. Holos, holos, zalas l notre nef prend eau, je noie, zalas, zalas !

"– Si ai-je, dit Panurge, naguère ici vu une abbegesse à blanc plumage, laquelle mieux vaudrait chevaucher que mener en main, et si les autres sont damoiseaux, elle me semblerait dame oiselle. Je dis cointe[33] et jolie, bien valant un péché ou deux. Dieu me le pardonne, partant je n’y pensais point en mal : le mal que j’y pense me puisse soudain advenir ! »","“Have I ever seen here,” said Panurge, “an abbess with white plumage, who would be better off riding than leading, and if the others are damsels, she would seem to me a lady bird. I say cointe[33] and pretty, well worth a sin or two. God forgive me, therefore I thought no harm of it: the harm that I think of it may suddenly befall me! »","‘And yet,’ said Panurge, ‘I recently met a white-feathered Abbégesse whom I’d rather bestride than lead by the bridle. And if the others are dain-oiseaux – young bucks of birds – then she looks to me like a daine-moiselle – a doe-bird – I mean an attractive one, a pretty one, well worth a sin or two. God forgive me, but I wasn’t thinking any evil: may the evil I was thinking come quick to me now!’ How, with much difficulty, we were shown a Popinjay","Yet, return’d Panurge, I saw but e’en now a pretty kind of cooing Abbeykite as white as a Dove, and her I had rather ride than lead.

"« Ha, ha, s’écria Panurge, tout va bien. L’orage est passé. Je vous prie, de grâce, que je descende le premier. Je voudrais fort aller un peu à mes affaires. Vous aiderai-je encore là ? Baillez que je vrillonne[1] cette corde. J’ai du courage prou[2], voire, de peur bien peu. Baillez ça, mon ami. Non, non, pas maille de crainte. Vrai est que cette vague décumane[3], laquelle donna de proue en poupe, m’a un peu l’artère altéré.","“Ha, ha,” exclaimed Panurge, “all is well. The storm has passed. I beg you, please, that I get off first. I would very much like to go about my business a little. Will I still help you there? Yawn that I twist[1] this rope. I have courage pro[2], even, with very little fear. Yawn that, my friend. No, no, no mesh of fear. It's true that this decumane[3] wave, which went from bow to stern, has affected my artery a little.","though there it was ‘helping’ God that was mentioned or implied not, ‘cooperating’ or ‘working together’ with him. The basic authority is I Corinthians 3:9: ‘We are workers together with the Lord’. In the Vulgate Latin we are God’s ‘helpers’ (adjutores); Erasmus and others insisted that ‘synergism’ entails ‘cooperators’, or ‘workers together’ not ‘helpers’. (God, being almighty, needs no help but by allowing human beings to cooperate with him he bestows on them the dignity of causality.) Such synergism forms the very stuff of the moral laughter in Rabelais. Panurge cites a saying well known as an Erasmian adage: I, II, XCI, ‘The most delightful sailing follows the land, the most delightful walking follows the shore’. Rabelais has taken over here and rewritten matter from the end of Chapter 21. Frère Jean retains his role as a symbol of active virtue.] ‘Ho, ho!’ cried Panurge; ‘everything’s going well. The storm is over. I beg you , I pray you, do let me be the first to go below. I really would rather like to attend to a few things. Shall I help you again over there? Permit me to coil up that rope. Indeed: plenty of courage I have: of fear, very little. Give it to me, my friend. No, not a ha’porth of fear. It’s true that that decuman billow which swamped us from prow to poop did rather desiccate my arteries.’","quoth Panurge, Oh ho! All is well, the Storm is over. I beseech ye, be so kind as to let me be the first that is set on shoar; for I would by all means a little untruss a point.—Shall I help you still, here, let me see , I’ll coyle this Rope; I have plenty of courage, and of fear as little as may be. Give it me yonder, honest Tar— No, no, I have not a bit of fear. Indeed that same Decumane Wave that took us fore and aft somewhat alter’d my Pulse.—Down with your Sails"

"On lui attachait un câble en quelque haute tour, pendant en terre : par icelui avec deux mains montait, puis dévalait si raidement et si assurément que plus ne pourriez parmi un pré bien égalé. On lui mettait une grosse perche appuyée à deux arbres ; à icelle se pendait par les mains, et d’icelle allait et venait, sans des pieds à rien toucher, qu’à grande course on ne l’eût pu aconcevoir[47].","A cable was attached to it in some high tower, hanging in the ground: through it it with two hands ascended, then descended so steeply and so assuredly that no one could ever walk among a well-leveled meadow. They placed a big pole leaning against two trees; to it hung by the hands, and from it went and came, without feet to touch anything, that with a great race one could not have imagined it [47].","They would tie him a rope, hanging down from some high tower: he would climb up hand over hand and then slide down so quick and sure that you could never have outdone him on a flat meadow. They would set up a great pole fixed between the two trees: he would hang down from it by his arms and move back and forth, hand over hand, touching nothing with his feet, so quickly that you could not have caught up with him by running full pelt.","They tied a cable-rope to the top of a high Tower, by one end whereof hanging near the ground, he wrought himself with his hands to the very top: Then upon the same tract came down so sturdily and firme that you could not on a plaine meadow have run with more assurance. They set up a great pole fixed upon two trees, there would he hang by his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching at nothing, would go back and fore along the foresaid rope with so great swiftnesse, that hardly could one overtake him with running; and then to exercise his breast and lungs, he would shout like all the Devils in hell."

The discovery of the real nature of semen and its production lay a long way in the future. In the Renaissance the question was one of real actuality.

"« Je voudrais, dit Épistémon, avoir payé chopine de tripes à embourser, et qu’eussions à l’original collationné les terrifiques chapitres, Execrabilis, De multa, Si plures, De Annatis per totum, Nisi essent, Cum ad monasterium, Quod dilectio, Mandatum, et certains autres, lesquels tirent par chacun an de France en Rome quatre cents mille ducats et davantage.","""I would like,"" said Epistemon, ""to have paid for a pint of guts, and that we had collated the original terrific chapters, Execrabilis, De multa, Si plures, De Annatis per totum, Nisi essent, Cum ad monasterium, Quod dilectio , Mandatum, and certain others, which each year draw from France in Rome four hundred thousand ducats and more.","For the cruel and maudlin Bishop of the Papimanes the Decretals absolutely replace Holy Writ, which could never justify what are for Rabelais now the evils of the papalist system as well as its corrupt monastic institutions and skewed theology. Homenaz’s gaffe (‘Decretisf for ‘Decretalist’) is a real one: for Rabelais Gratian’s Decrees are never in question. What is in question is papal absolutism and the (for Rabelais and his patrons) corrupt system which it brings about. Rabelais is adapting to his laughter harsh Lutheran satire. Homenaz breaks Christ’s summary of the Law: he worships the wrong God; he does not love his neighbour as himself. And he venerates the wrong Scriptures. In the Latinate phrase, vivat’ means ‘Long live!’ , while ‘fat’ and ‘bibat’ are the same word as pronounced by German-speakers. The Spanish pronunciation – ‘bibat’ – makes it sound like the Latin for ‘Let him drink!’] ‘I would willingly have paid half a pint of gut-ready tripe,’ said Epistemon, ‘if only we could have collated against that archetype those appalling chapters, Execrabilis, De multa, Si plures, De annatis (in its entirety) Nisi essent, Cum ad monasterium, Quod dilectio, Mandatum, and certain others as well by which over four hundred thousand ducats are extorted from France towards Rome every year.’","I WOULD, said Epistemon, it had cost me a pint of the best Tripe that ever can enter into Gut, so we had but compar’d with the Original, the dreadful Chapters, Exercrabilis.

"– Mon ami, dit Hippothadée, prenez bien mes paroles, je vous en prie. Quand je vous dis : « S’il plaît à Dieu », vous fais-je tort ? Est-ce mal parlé ? Est-ce condition blasphème[14] ou scandaleuse ? N’est-ce honorer le Seigneur, créateur, protecteur, servateur[15] ? N’est-ce le reconnaître unique dateur[16] de tout bien ? N’est-ce nous déclarer tous dépendre de sa bénignité, rien sans lui n’être, rien ne valoir, rien ne pouvoir, si sa sainte grâce n’est sur nous infuse ? N’est-ce mettre exception canonique à toutes nos entreprises et tout ce que nous proposons remettre à ce que sera disposé par sa sainte volonté, tant ès cieux comme en la terre ? N’est-ce véritablement sanctifier son benoît nom ? Mon ami, vous ne serez point cocu, si Dieu plaît. Pour savoir sur ce quel est son plaisir, ne faut entrer en désespoir, comme de chose absconse[17], et pour laquelle entendre faudrait consulter son conseil privé et voyager en la chambre de ses très saints plaisirs. Le bon Dieu nous a fait ce bien qu’il nous les a révélés, annoncés, déclarés, et apertement[18] décrits par les sacrées Bibles.","“My friend,” said Hippothadée, “take my words carefully, please. When I tell you, ""Please God"", am I doing you wrong? Is it badly spoken? Is this condition blasphemous[14] or outrageous? Is it not to honor the Lord, creator, protector, servant[15]? Isn't this recognizing him as the sole dater[16] of all good? Is it not declaring that we all depend on his benignity, without him nothing is, nothing is worth, nothing can be, if his holy grace is not infused upon us? Isn't this putting a canonical exception to all our undertakings and all that we propose to give to what will be disposed by his holy will, both in heaven and on earth? Isn't this truly sanctifying his holy name? My friend, you will not be cuckolded, if God pleases. To know what his pleasure is, one must not enter into despair, as something abstruse[17], and for which to hear one would have to consult his private council and travel to the chamber of his most holy pleasures. The good Lord has done us this good that He has revealed them to us, announced them, declared them, and confidently [18] described by the sacred Bibles.","‘Beloved,’ said Hippothadée, ‘take what I say aright , I beseech you. When I say to you please God, am I treating you wrongly? Is it badly put? Is that a condition which is blasphemous or an obstacle to your faith? Is it not to honour our Lord, our Creator, Protector, Servator? Is it not to recognize Him as the only Giver of all good gifts? Is it not to declare that we all depend on His loving kindness; that we are as nothing, are worth nothing, can do nothing, unless His holy grace is infused upon us? Is it not to apply a canonical proviso to everything we undertake, is it not to remit everything which we propose to what He may dispose by His holy will, in earth, as it is in Heaven? Is that not truly to hallow His holy name? ‘Beloved, you will, please God, not be cuckolded. To know what is His pleasure in this matter there is no need to fall into despair as being something over which one must consult His privy counsel and journey into the chamber of His holiest pleasures: God is good and has granted us the boon of having revealed it, declared it and clearly explained it through Holy Scripture.","My Friend, (quoth Hippothadee) take my Words in the Sence wherein I meaned them, and do not misinterpret me. When I tell you, if it please God, do I to you do any wrong therein? Is it an ill Expression? Is it a Blaspheming Clause or Reserve any way scandalous unto the World? Do not we thereby honour the Lord God Almighty, Creator, Protector, and Conserver of all things? Is not that a mean, whereby we do acknowledge him to be the sole Giver of all whatsoever is good? Do not we in that manifest our Faith, that we believe all things to depend upon his infinite and incomprehensible Bounty? and that without him nothing can be produced, nor after its Production be of any value, force, or power, without the concurring aid and favour of his assisting Grace? Is it not a canonical and authentick Exception, worthy to be premised to all our Undertakings? Is it not expedient, that what we propose unto our selves, be still referred to what shall be disposed of by the Sacred Will of God, unto which all things must acquiesce in the Heavens as well as on the Earth? Is not that verily a sanctifying of his Holy Name? My Friend, you shall not be a Cuckold, if it please God; nor shall we need to despair of the knowledge of his good Will and Pleasure herein, as if it were such an abstruse and mysteriously hidden Secret, that for the clear understanding thereof, it were necessary to consult with those of his Celestial Privy Council, or expresly make a Voyage unto the Empyrean Chamber, where Order is given for the effectuating of his most holy Pleasures. The great God hath done us this good, and he hath declared and revealed them to us openly and plainly, and described them in the Holy Bible"
"L’heure du souper venue, la reine s’assit en premier lieu, conséquemment les autres selon leur degré et dignité. D’entrée de table toutes furent servies de grosses chandelles de moule, excepté que la reine fut servie d’un gros et raide flambeau flamboyant de cire blanche, un peu rouge par le bout ; aussi furent les lanternes du sang exceptées du reste, et la lanterne provinciale de Mirebalais, laquelle fut servie d’une chandelle de noix, et la provinciale du bas Poitou, laquelle je vis être servie d’une chandelle armée[12]. Et Dieu sait quelle lumière après elles rendaient avec leurs mècherons ! Exceptez ici un nombre de jeunes lanternes, du gouvernement d’une grosse lanterne : elles ne luisaient comme les autres, mais me semblaient avoir les paillardes[13] couleurs.","When supper-time came, the queen sat down first, consequently the others according to their degree and dignity. At the entrance to the table, all were served with large mussel candles, except that the queen was served with a large, stiff flaming candle of white wax, a little red at the end; also were the lanterns of blood, excepted from the rest, and the provincial lantern of Mirebalais, which was served with a candle of walnuts, and the provincial one of lower Poitou, which I saw being served with an armed candle. And God knows what light afterwards they shed with their locks! Except here a number of young lanterns, of the government of a large lantern: they did not shine like the others, but seemed to me to have the bawdy [13] colors.","When the hour for supper arrived, the queen sat down in the place of honour, and the others in order of rank and dignity. As an entrée, big moulded candles were served, except that the queen was served with a fat, erect, flaming torch of white wax, a little red round the tip. The Lanterns of the blood-royal were also treated differently from the others, as was the Provincial Lantern of Mirebeau for whom a candle of walnut-oil was served, and as was the Provincial Lantern of Bas Poitou whom I saw served with a candle bearing a coat-of-arms. Lord only knows what light they thereafter produced with their wicks. There is an exception at this point: a number of girl Lanterns chaperoned by a fat one: they did not shine as the others did but emitted what seemed to me to be pale, straw-tumbling colours.29","When ’twas Supper-time, the Queen’s Highness first sate down, and then the Lady-lanterns according to their Rank and Dignity. For the first Course, they were all serv’d with large Christmas-Candles, except the Queen, who was serv’d with a hugeous thick, stiff flaming Taper, of white Wax, somewhat red towards the Tip, and the Royal Family, as also the Provincial Lantern of Mirebalais, who were serv’d with Nut-lights; and the Provincial of Lower Poitou, with an arm’d Candle. After that, god-wot, what a glorious Light they gave with their wicks: I do not say all, for you must except a parcel of Junior Lanterns, under the Government of a high and mighty one. These did not cast a Light like the rest, but seem’d to me dimmer than any long-snuff-farthing Candle, whose Tallow has been half melted away in a Hot-house."

"Au soir Panurge dit à Æditue : « Seigneur, ne vous déplaise si je vous raconte une histoire joyeuse laquelle advint au pays de Châtelleraudais depuis vingt et trois lunes. Le palefrenier d’un gentilhomme, au mois d’avril, pourmenait à un matin ses grands chevaux parmi les guérets. Là rencontra une gaie bergère, laquelle, à l’ombre d’un buissonnet, ses brebiettes gardait, ensemble[10] un âne et quelque chèvre. Devisant avec elle, lui persuada monter derrière lui en croupe visiter son écurie, et là faire un tronçon de bonne chère à la rustique. Durant leur propos et demeure[11], le cheval s’adressa à l’âne et lui dit en l’oreille, car les bêtes parlèrent toute icelle année en divers lieux : « Pauvre et chétif baudet, j’ai de toi pitié et compassion. Tu travailles journellement beaucoup : je l’aperçois à l’usure de ton bas-cul. C’est bien fait, puisque Dieu t’a créé pour le service des humains. Tu es baudet de bien. Mais n’être autrement torchonné, étrillé, phaléré[12] et alimenté que je te vois, cela me semble un peu tyrannique et hors les mètes[13] de raison. Tu es tout hérissonné, tout hallebrené[14], tout lanterné[15], et ne manges ici que joncs, épines et durs chardons. C’est pourquoi je te semonds[16], baudet, ton petit pas avec moi venir et voir comment nous autres, que nature a produits pour la guerre, sommes traités et nourris. Ce ne sera sans toi ressentir de mon ordinaire.","In the evening Panurge said to Æditue: “Lord, do not mind if I tell you a joyous story which happened in the country of Châtelleraudais twenty-three moons ago. A gentleman's groom, in the month of April, was leading his great horses among the guerets one morning. There she met a cheerful shepherdess, who, in the shade of a bush, her ewes were guarding, together [10] an ass and some goat. Chatting with her, persuaded him to come up behind him to visit his stable, and there to have a bit of good cheer at the country house. During their speech and residence[11], the horse spoke to the donkey and said in his ear, because the animals spoke all this year in various places: ""Poor and puny donkey, I have pity on you and compassion. You work a lot every day: I see it in the wear and tear of your stockings. Well done, since God created you for the service of humans. You are a donkey of good. But not being otherwise wiped, curried, phalerated[12] and fed that I see you, that seems to me a little tyrannical and out of reason[13]. You are all spiky, all hallebrené[14], all lantern[15], and eat here only rushes, thorns and hard thistles. That is why I beg you [16], donkey, your little step with me to come and see how we, whom nature has produced for war, are treated and fed. It won't be without you to feel like I'm ordinary.","One evening Panurge said to the Aedituus: ‘Don’t be offended if I tell you, sir, an amusing story of something which happened twenty-three moons ago in the countryside round Châtellerault. ‘One morning in the month of April the groom of a certain nobleman was walking his war-horses through the meadows. There he encountered a happy shepherdess keeping watch over her little lambkins ‘neath the shade of a little bush. Over an ass and a goat too. He chatted to her, persuading her to get up behind on the crupper to visit his stables and enjoy a nice little country-style bite there. While they were still chattering, the war-horse turned to the ass and said in its ear (the beasts in some places could talk to each other the whole of that year): ‘“You poor wretched little donkey. For you I feel pity and compassion. You work hard every day: I can tell that from that rub under your crupper-belt. A good thing too, for God made you for the service of human kind. You are, fellow, a good little donkey. But it does seem a bit tyrannical and unreasonable to me when I see you never sponged down, always poorly curry-combed, poorly caparisoned and poorly fed. Your coat looks like bristles all dirty and shiny. You eat nothing but rushes, thorns and prickly thistles. That is why I summon you, donkey, to pick your way after me and see how we (whom Nature has made for war) are treated and cared for. You will not fail, fellow, to see how I normally live.”","At Night Panurge said to Ædituus, Give me leave, sweet Sir, to tell you a merry Story of something that happen’d some three and twenty Moons ago in the Countrey of Chastelleraudland. On the First of April, a certain Gentleman’s Groom, Roger by Name, was walking his Master’s Horses in some fallow ground. There ’twas his good Fortune to find a pretty Shepherdess, feeding her bleating Sheep, and harmless Lambkins, on the Brow of a neighbouring Mountain, in the shade of an adjacent Grove: Near her, some frisking Kids tripp’d it o’er a green Carpet of Nature’s own spreading, and to compleat the Pastoral Land-skip, There stood an Ass. Roger, who was a Wag, had a Dish of Chat with her, and after some If’s, And’s, and But’s, Hem’s, and Heigh’s on her side, got her in the mind to get up behind him, to go and see his Stable, and there take a Bit by the bye in a Civil way. While they were holding a parley, the Horse directing his discourse to the Ass, (for all Brute Beasts spoke that year in divers places) whisper’d these words in his Ear: Poor Ass, how I pity thee! Thou slavest like any Hack , I read it on thy Crupper; thou do’st well however, since God has created thee to serve Mankind; thou art a very honest Ass: But not to be better Rub’d down, Curricomb’d, Trap’d, and Fed than thou art, seems to me indeed to be too hard a Lot. Alas! thou art all Rough-coated, in ill Plight; Jaded, Foundred, Crestfallen, and Drooping like a Mooting Duck, and Feedest here on nothing but coarse Grass, or Bryars and Thistles: Therefore do but Pace it along with me, and thou shalt see how we noble Steeds, made by Nature for War , are Treated; come, thou’lt lose nothing by coming, I’ll get thee a taste of my Fare. I’ troth"
"« Comme Platon, li. V, de Rep., voulait être non guerre nommée, ains[4] sédition, quand les Grecs mouvaient armes les uns contre les autres, ce que si par male[5] fortune advenait, il commande qu’on use de toute modestie. Si guerre la nommez, elle n’est que superficiaire[6], elle n’entre point au profond cabinet[7] de nos cœurs, car nul de nous n’est outragé en son honneur, et n’est question, en somme totale, que de rhabiller quelque faute commise par nos gens, j’entends et vôtres et nôtres, laquelle, encore que connussiez, vous deviez laisser couler outre, car les personnages querellants étaient plus à contemner[8] qu’à ramentevoir[9], mêmement leur satisfaisant selon le grief, comme je me suis offert. Dieu sera juste estimateur de notre différend, lequel je supplie plutôt par mort me tollir[10] de cette vie et mes biens dépérir devant mes yeux, que par moi ni les miens en rien soit offensé. »","“Like Plato, li. V, of Rep., wanted to be no named war, thus[4] sedition, when the Greeks moved arms against each other, which if by bad[5] fortune should happen, he commands that we use all modesty. If you call it war, it is only superficial[6], it does not enter the deep cabinet[7] of our hearts, for none of us is outraged in his honor, and there is no question, in short total, than to dress up some fault committed by our people, I mean both yours and ours, which, although you knew, you had to let it sink in, because the quarrelsome characters were more to be condemned [8] than to be brought back to see [9] , even their satisfactory according to grievance, as I offered myself. God will be just estimator of our disagreement, which I beg rather by death to tollir [10] me of this life and my goods to perish before my eyes, that by me nor mine in nothing be offended. »","‘Thus should things be done amongst neighbours and old friends; this our difference is not properly speaking a war, just as Plato would not call it war but sedition when Greek took up arms against Greek. Whenever that does unfortunately happen, he commands total moderation. If war you call it, it is but a superficial one: it does not enter into the innermost chambers of our hearts, for not one of us has been outraged in his honour; it all amounts to redressing a wrong committed by our people, I mean yours and ours. ‘And even if you had known of it, you should have let it flow by, for those quarrelling folk were more to be ridiculed than resented, not least when their grievances were being satisfied, as I myself offered to do. God will be the just appraiser of our controversy. Him I beg to take this life from me in death and to destroy my goods before my eyes rather than be offended by me or mine in anything whatsoever.’","As for your ransome, I do freely remit it to you, and will that your armes and horse be restored to you; so should good neighbours do, and ancient friends; seeing this our difference is not properly warre, as Plato, lib. 5. de repub. would not have it called warre but sedition, when the Greeks took up armes against one another, and that therefore when such combustions should arise amongst them, his advice was to behave themselves in the managing of them, with all discretion and modesty. Although you call it warre, it is but superficial, it entereth not into the closet and inmost cabinet of our hearts; for neither of us hath been wronged in his honour, nor is there any question betwixt us in the main, but only how to redresse by the by some petty faults committed by our men; I mean, both yours and ours, which although you knew you ought to let passe; for these quarrelsome persons deserve rather to be contemned then mentioned, especially seeing I offered them satisfaction according to the wrong. God shall be the just Judge of our variances, whom I beseech by death rather to take me out of this life, and to permit my goods to perish and be destroyed before mine eyes, then that by me or mine he should in any sort be wronged."
"– Tu, dit frère Jean, te damnes comme un vieil diable. Il est écrit : Mihi vindictam, et cœtera. Matière de bréviaire. »","“You,” said Brother Jean, “damn yourself like an old devil. It is written: Mihi vindictam, et cœtera. Breviary material. »","[‘You,’ said Frère Jean, ‘are damning yourself like an aged devil. It is written, Vengeance is mine, etc. Breviary stuff!’] How Pantagruel arrived in the Isle of Ennasin, and of the curious kinships in that land CHAPTER 9 [In ‘48 this was Chapter 4. Ennasin means ‘lacking nostrils’. The noses like aces of clubs may be an echo of descriptions of the Eskimos. Much of the humour in this chapter (such as it is, for it has not well withstood the passage of time) depends upon French and Latin plays on words and proverbial expressions, most lending themselves to quite obvious sexual innuendos: explanations of French and Latin words are added within brackets and the translation given some latitude when helpful. In the first line Rabelais gives the Sou’-wester its Classical name of ‘Garbin’.] Zephyr, helped a little by Garbin, was bearing us steadily along and we spent a day without sighting land. On the third day after dawn, at the hour when the flies come out, there appeared a triangular land, strongly resembling Sicily in shape and situation. It was called the Isle of Kinships. The men and women resemble denizens of Poitou with their red-stained faces, except that they all, man, woman and child, have noses shaped like an ace of clubs. For which reason the ancient name of the Isle was Ennasin. And as the local Podestat freely told us, they were all, as they boasted, of one kith and kin. ‘You fellows from the other world consider it wonderful that, from a single Roman family – that is, the Fabii – on one single day – the thirteenth of February – through one single gate – the Carmentalia subsequently surnamed the Calamitous [formerly sited at the foot of the Capitol, between the Tarpeian Rock and the Tiber] – against certain foes of the Romans – the Etruscan Veientes – there once issued three hundred and six warriors, all kinsmen [, together with five thousand fighting-men, all vassals of theirs; every man of whom was slain near the river Cremera, which flows out of lake Bagano]. From our land here there could issue forth in their need three hundred thousand men, all kinsfolk, all of the same family.’ Their kith-and-kinship is of a most curious fashioning, for whilst they are all related to each other and closely knit , no one there is the father, mother, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, cousin, nephew, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, godfather or godmother of anyone else – save, it is true, for one noseless old man who, as I saw, called a little girl of three or four Father, whilst the little maid called him Daughter. The kith-and-kinship amongst them was such that one man called a woman My Flatfish, and she called him My Porpoise. ‘Those two,’ said Frère Jean, ‘must reek of the tides when they rub their haunches together.’ One called out with a smile to an elegant maiden, ‘Good day, My Estrille’ (‘My Currycomb’). And she greeted him back, ‘Good morrow my Fauveau’ (‘My Dun Stallion’). – ‘O-hol’ exclaimed Panurge, ‘o -oh! o- oh! Come and see a Currycomb, a scythe and a veal-calf: estrille + faux + veau amounts to étrille-fauveau, doesn’t it? This vain stallion with its black stripe must often get a good currying!’20 Another greeted his sweeting by saying, ‘God be with you, my Bench.’ She replied, ‘And also with you, my Lawsuit! – ‘By Saintrinian,’ said Gymnaste, ‘that Lawsuit must frequently get laid on that Bench!’ [One called another girl Mon Ver (‘My worm’) and she called him her Coquin (her ‘scamp’. – ‘There,’ said Eusthenes, ‘is a good case of ver-coquin’ (sheep’s stagger-worm). Another greeted a maiden from a family allied to his with ‘Good-day, my Axe-head.’ And she replied, ‘Good-day my Helve’ (‘my Manche’). – ‘Gosh,’ exclaimed Carpalim, ‘that axe-head’s well helved. And how well that manche fits its axe-head! But may it not mean that mancia (handful of cash) that Roman courtesans ask for? Or perhaps a Grey-Friar with his long sleeves (manches)?’ Pressing ahead, I saw another, a bumpkin who greeted a family friend and called her ‘My Mattress’. She called him her Coverlet. And indeed he did look coverletly lumpish. One called another maid ‘My Crumb’, and she called him ‘My Crust’. One called another his Shovel and she called him her Poker. One called another girl his Pumps, and she called him her Slip-ons. [One called another his Bootie, and she called him her Socks.] Another called another his Mittens, and she called him her Gloves. One called another his Crackling: she called him her Bacon. And their relationship was as close as rind to rasher. In similar relationships, one called his maiden his Omelette and she called him her Egg. And they were as closely allied as an egg to an omelette. So too another called his girl My Twig. And she called him her Faggot. (I could never work out what their relationship, kith or blood-links were in comparison with our own common usage, save that they said she played twig to his faggot.) Another greeted his by saying, ‘Greetings, My Shell.’ She replied, ‘Same to you, my Oyster.’ (‘That,’ said Carpalim, ‘really does amount to an oyster-in-its-shell!’) Another similarly greeted his girl, saying, ‘Live well, my Pod;’ she replied, ‘A long life to you, my Pea.’ (‘That,’ said Gymnaste, ‘is a pea in a pod.’) [Another ugly great tramp, perched high atop his wooden clogs, upon meeting a plump, fat, stumpy young wench, said to her, ‘Good-day my Top, my Spinning-top, my Humming-top.’ And she aggressively replied, ‘Look out for yourself, my Whip.’ (‘Blood of Saint Grey,’ said Xenomanes. ‘Is that whip up to servicing that top?’) A doctoral don, neatly brushed and combed, after having chatted a while with an aristocratic young lady, took leave of her, saying, ‘I am deeply grateful, Good Face.’ – ‘But,’ she said, ‘deeper thanks to you, Bad Hand.’ – (‘It is not an insignificant matter,’ said Pantagruel, ‘to put on a good face when dealt a bad hand.’) An apprentice woodman said to a young maiden as he passed by, ‘Oh, oh, oh! How long it is since I last saw you, my Bag!’ – ‘I am pleased,’ she said, ‘to see you, my Pipe.’ (‘Couple them together,’ said Panurge, ‘and blow down their bums and you’ll have bagpipes.’)] Another called his girl his Sow. She called him her Hay. And it occurred to me that that sow would love to sport in that hay. I saw a little hunch-backed gallant fairly near to us who greeted a family friend saying, ‘God be with you, my Hole;’ and she greeted him back, saying, ‘May God guard my Peg.’ (Frère Jean said, ‘She, I think, is all hole, and he’s likewise all peg. Now to find out whether it’s a round peg filling a round hole!’) Another greeted his lady with, ‘God be with you, my Moulting.’ She replied, ‘Good-day to you, my Gosling.’ (‘I believe,’ said Ponocrates, ‘that that gosling is frequently moulting.’) A merry chap chatting with a pretty young thing said, ‘Now remember that, Quiet Fart.’ – And she replied, That I will, my Big Ditto.’ – ‘Would you really say they were relatives?’ asked Pantagruel of the Podestat. ‘I think they must be enemies, for he called her a fart. In our part of the world you can offer no greater insult to a woman than to address her thus.’ ‘Good folk from that other world,’ replied the Podestat, ‘you have few folk more closely related than that big fart and that little one. For in an instant they both slipped invisibly out of the same hole.’ ‘So the Gallant Nor’easter had lanterned his mother,’ said Panurge. ‘What mother do you mean?’ asked the Potestat. ‘Such relationships belong to your world.","Thou damn’st thy self like any old Devill, quoth Fryar Jhon. It is written Mihi vindictum, &c. matter of breviary, Mark ye me; that’s holy stuff."
"– Buvez, dit Bacbuc, une, deux ou trois fois. De rechef changeans d’imagination, telle trouverez au goût, saveur ou liqueur, comme l’aurez imaginé. Et dorénavant, dites qu’à Dieu rien soit impossible.","“Drink,” said Bacbuc, “one, two or three times. Once again changing your imagination, such will find the taste, flavor or liquor, as you will have imagined. And henceforth, say that to God nothing is impossible.","‘Drink once, drink twice, drink thrice,’ said Bacbuc, ‘having a different wine in mind each time, and you will find the taste, the bouquet and the feel on your tongue of whatever wine you thought of. And from henceforth say that with God nothing is ever impossible.’","Drink once, twice or thrice more, said Bacbuc, still changing your Imagination, and you shall find its taste and flavour to be exactly that on which you shall have pitched. Then never presume to say that any thing is impossible to God."
"– Nenni dea[10], mon ami, répondit Hippothadée, si Dieu plaît.","“Nenni dea[10], my friend,” replied Hippothadée, “if God pleases.","‘Indeed not, Beloved,’ replied Hippothadée; ‘if it please God, no.’ ‘Aah!!’","By no means (answered Hippothadee) will you be Cuckolded, if it please God."
"Mais voici qu’arriva un jour d’une grande fête que son père Gargantua faisait un beau banquet à tous les princes de sa cour. Je crois bien que tous les officiers de sa cour étaient tant occupés au service du festin que l’on ne se souciait du pauvre Pantagruel, et demeurait ainsi a reculorum. Que fit-il ? Qu’il fit, mes bonnes gens, écoutez. Il essaya de rompre les chaînes du berceau avec les bras, mais il ne put, car elles étaient trop fortes. Adonc il trépigna tant des pieds qu’il rompit le bout de son berceau, qui toutefois était d’une grosse poste[6] de sept empans en carré, et ainsi qu’il eut mis les pieds dehors, il s’avala[7] le mieux qu’il put, en sorte qu’il touchait les pieds en terre. Et alors, avec grande puissance, se leva, emportant son berceau sur l’échine ainsi lié, comme une tortue qui monte contre une muraille, et à le voir semblait que ce fût une grande caraque de cinq cents tonneaux qui fût debout.","But here came a day from a great feast that his father Gargantua was giving a beautiful banquet to all the princes of his court. I do believe that all the officers of his court were so busy serving the feast that no one cared about poor Pantagruel, and remained thus a retreatorum. What did he do? He did, my good people, listen. He tried to break the chains of the cradle with his arms, but he couldn't, because they were too strong. So he stamped his feet so much that he broke the end of his cradle, which however was of a large post [6] of seven spans in square, and as he had put his feet out, he swallowed himself [7 ] the best he could, so that he touched his feet on the ground. And then, with great power, arose, carrying his cradle on his back thus bound, like a tortoise climbing against a wall, and to see him seemed as if it were a great carrack of five hundred tons that was standing.","The inner parts of the building above that court were raised up on pillars of chalcedony and porphyry, with beautiful ancient-style arches, within which were beautiful galleries, long and spacious, decorated with wall-paintings as well as with the horns of stags, [unicorns and hippopotamuses, with elephant tusks] and other objects of note.","But see what happened, once upon a great Holiday, that his father Gargantua made a sumptuous banquet to all the Princes of his Court: I am apt to beleeve, that the menial officers of the house were so imbusied in waiting each on his proper service at the feast, that nobody took care of poor Pantagruel, who was left a reculorum, behinde-hand all alone, and as forsaken. What did he? Heark what he did , good people: he strove and essayed to break the chaines of the Cradle with his armes, but coold not, for they were too strong for him: then did he keep with his feet such a stamping stirre, and so long, that at last he beat out the lower end of his Cradle, which notwithstanding was made of a great post five foot in square: and, as soon as he had gotten out his feet, he slid down as well as he could, till he had got his soales to the ground; and then with a mighty force he rose up, carrying his Cradle upon his back, bound to him like a Tortoise that crawles up against a wall; and to have seen him , you would have thought it had been a great Carrick of five hundred tunne upon one end."
"– Monsieur notre maître, dit Panurge, je le serai, n’en doutez, et bientôt. Durant votre docte discours, cette puce que j’ai en l’oreille m’a plus chatouillé que ne fit onques. Je vous retiens de la fête. Nous y ferons chère et demie, je vous le promets. Vous y amènerez votre femme, s’il vous plaît, avec ses voisines, cela s’entend. Et jeu sans vilenie. »","“Monsieur our master,” said Panurge, “I will be, no doubt about it, and soon. During your learned speech, this chip in my ear tickled me more than ever. I'm keeping you from the party. We'll do it and a half, I promise you. You will bring your wife there, please, with her neighbors, that is understood. And play without villainy. »","‘Monsieur Notre Maître,’ said Panurge, ‘and so I shall: never doubt it, and right soon. During your learned consultation this flea I have in my ear tickled me as never before. I will keep a place for you at the marriage-feast. We shall have a good time and a half, I promise you! You’ll kindly bring your wife with you – and her neighbours: that goes without saying. ‘And now for some honest sport.’ How Rondibilis declares cuckoldry to be one of the adjuncts of matrimony","Sir, my worthy Master (quoth Panurge) I will do it, do not you doubt thereof; and that quickly enough, I warrant you. Nevertheless, whilst you were busied in the uttering of your Learned Discourse, this Flea which I have in mine Ear, hath tickled me more than ever. I retain you in the Number of my Festival Guests, and promise you, that we shall not want for Mirth, and good Chear enough; yea, over and above the ordinary Rate. And, if it may please you, desire your Wife to come along with you, together with her She-Friends and Neighbours: That is to be understood, and there shall be fair Play."
"De fait, laissant un tas de longs prologues et protestations que font ordinairement ces dolents, contemplatifs, amoureux de carême, lesquels point à la chair ne touchent, lui dit un jour : « Madame, ce serait bien fort utile à toute la république, délectable à vous, honnête à votre lignée et à moi nécessaire que fussiez couverte de ma race, et le croyez, car l’expérience vous le démontrera. » La dame, à cette parole, le recula plus de cent lieues, disant : « Méchant fol, vous appartient-il me tenir tels propos ? À qui pensez-vous parler ? Allez, ne vous trouvez jamais devant moi, car si n’était pour un petit, je vous ferais couper bras et jambes.","In fact, leaving a heap of long prologues and protestations usually made by those dolent, contemplative, lovers of Lent, who do not touch the flesh, he said to her one day: ""Madame, it would be very useful to the whole republic, delectable to you, honest to your lineage and to me necessary that you should be covered with my race, and believe it, for experience will show it to you. The lady, at this word, drew him back more than a hundred leagues, saying: ""Wicked madman, does it belong to you to say such things to me?"" Who do you think you're talking to? Come on, never find yourself in front of me, because if it wasn't for a little one, I'd have your arms and legs cut off.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Very true it is, ( saith Plato the Prince of Philosophers,) that if the image and knowledge of wisdom were corporeal and visible to the eyes of mortals, it would stirre up all the world to admire her: which we may the rather beleeve, that the very bare report thereof, scattered in the air, if it happen to be received into the eares of men, who for being studious, and lovers of vertuous things, are called Philosophers, doth not suffer them to sleep nor rest in quiet, but so pricketh them up, and sets them on fire, to run unto the place where the person is, in whom the said knowledge is said to have built her Temple, and uttered her Oracles, as it was manifestly shewn unto us in the Queen of Sheba, who came from the utmost borders of the East and Persian sea, to see the order of Solomons house, and to heare his wisdom; in Anacharsis, who came out of Scythia, even unto Athens, to see Solon; in Pythagoras, who travelled farre to visit the Memphitical Vaticinators; in Platon, who went a great way off to see the Magicians of Egypt, and Architas of Tarentum; in Apollonius Tianeus, who went as farre as unto Mount Caucasus, passed along the Scythians, the Massagetes, the Indians, and sailed over the great river Phison, even to the Brachmans to see Hiarchas; as likewise unto Babylon, Chaldea, Media, Assyria, Parthia, Syria, Phœnicia, Arabia, Palestina and Alexandria, even unto Æthiopia, to see the Gymnosophists: the like example have we of Titus Livius, whom to see and heare, divers studious persons came to Rome, from the Confines of France and Spaine; I dare not reckon my self in the number of those so excellent persons, but well would be called studious, and a lover, not only of learning, but of learned men also: and indeed, having heard the report of your so inestimable knowledge, I have left my countrey, my friends, my kindred and my house, and am come thus farre, valuing at nothing the length of the way, the tediousnesse of the sea, nor strangenesse of the land, and that only to see you, and to conferre with you about some passages in Philosophy, of Geomancie, and of the Cabalistick Art; whereof I am doubtful, and cannot satisfie my minde; which if you can resolve, I yield my self unto you for a slave henceforward, together with all my posterity; for other gift have I none, that I can esteem a recompence sufficient for so great a favour: I will reduce them into writing, and to morrow publish them to all the learned men in the City, that we may dispute publickly before them. But see in what manner, I mean that we shall dispute: I will not argue pro & contra, as do the sottish Sophisters of this town, and other places: likewise I will not dispute after the manner of the Academicks by declamation: nor yet by numbers, as Pythagoras was wont to do, and as Picus de la Mirandula did of late at Rome: but I will dispute by signes only without speaking, for the matters are so abstruse, hard and arduous, that words proceeding from the mouth of man, will never be sufficient for unfolding of them to my liking. May it therefore please your Magnificence to be there , it shall be at the great Hall of Navarre at seven a clock in the morning. When he had spoke these words, Pantagruel very honourably said unto him, Sir, of the graces that God hath bestowed upon me, I would not deny to communicate unto any man to my power; for whatever comes from him is good, and his pleasure is, that it should be increased, when we come amongst men worthy and fit to receive this celestial Manna of honest literature: in which number, because that in this time (as I do already very plainly perceive,) thou holdest the first rank, I give thee notice, that at all houres thou shalt finde me ready to condescend to every one of thy requests, according to my poor ability: although I ought rather to learn of thee, then thou of me, but, as thou hast protested, we will conferre of these doubts together, and will seek out the resolution, even unto the bottom of that undrainable Well, where Heraclitus sayes the truth lies hidden: and I do highly commend the manner of arguing which thou hast proposed, to wit, by signes without speaking; for by this means thou and I shall understand one another well enough, and yet shall be free from this clapping of hands, which these blockish Sophisters make, when any of the Arguers hath gotten the better of the Argument: Now to morrow I will not faile to meet thee at the place and houre that thou hast appointed, but let me intreat thee that there be not any strife or uproare between us, and that we seek not the honour and applause of men, but the truth only: to which Thaumast answered, The Lord God maintain you in his favour and grace, and instead of my thankfulnesse to you, poure down his blessings upon you, for that your Highnesse and magnificent greatnesse, hath not disdained to descend to the grant of the request of my poor basenesse, so farewel till to-morrow! Farewel, said Pantagruel. Gentlemen, you that read this present discourse, think not that ever men were more elevated and transported in their thoughts, then all this night were both Thaumast and Pantagruel; for the said Thaumast said to the Keeper of the house of Cluny, where he was lodged, that in all his life he had never known himself so dry, as he was that night. I think (said he) that Pantagruel held me by the throat; Give order, I pray you, that we may have some drink, and see that some fresh water be brought to us, to gargle my palat: on the other side, Pantagruel stretched his wits as high as he could, entring into very deep and serious meditations, and did nothing all that night but dote upon, and turn over the book of Beda, de numeris & signis: Plotins book, de inenarrabilibus; the book of Proclus, de magia; the book of Artemidorus, περὶ ἀνειροκριτικῶν; of Anaxagoras, περὶ σμεσίων Dinatius, περὶ ἀϕάτων; the books of Philistion: Hipponax, περὶ ἀνεκϕωνήτῶν and a rabble of others, so long, that Panurge said unto him, My Lord, leave all these thoughts and go to bed; for I perceive your spirits to be so troubled by a too intensive bending of them, that you may easily fall into some Quotidian fever with this so excessive thinking and plodding: but, having first drunk five and twenty or thirty good draughts, retire your self and sleep your fill: for in the morning I will argue against, and answer my master the Englishman; and if I drive him not ad metam non loqui, then call me Knave: Yea, but (said he) my friend Panurge , he is marvellously learned, how wilt thou be able to answer him? Very well, (answered Panurge) I pray you talk no more of it, but let me alone; is any man so learned as the devils are? No, indeed (said Pantagruel,) without Gods especial grace: Yet for all that (said Panurge) I have argued against them, gravelled and blanked them in disputation, and laid them so squat upon their tailes, that I have made them look like Monkies; therefore be assured, that to morrow I will make this vain-glorious Englishman to skite vineger before all the world. So Panurge spent the night with tipling amongst the Pages, and played away all the points of his breeches at primus secundus, and at peck point, in French called Lavergette. Yet when the condescended on time was come, he failed not to conduct his Master Pantagruel to the appointed place, unto which (beleeve me) there was neither great nor small in Paris but came, thinking with themselves that this devillish Pantagruel, who had overthrown and vanquished in dispute all these doting fresh-water Sophisters, would now get full payment and be tickled to some purpose; for this Englishman is a terrible bustler and horrible coyle-keeper, we will see who will be Conquerour, for he never met with his match before. Thus all being assembled, Thaumast stayed for them, and then when Pantagruel and Panurge came into the Hall, all the School-boyes, Professors of Arts, Senior-Sophisters, and Batchelors began to clap their hands, as their scurvie custome is. But Pantagruel cried out with a loud voice, as if it had been the sound of a double cannon, saying, Peace, with a devil to you, peace: by G— you rogues, if you trouble me here, I will cut off the heads of every one of you: at which words they remained all daunted and astonished, like so many ducks, and durst not do so much as cough, although they had swallowed fifteen pounds of feathers: withal they grew so dry with this only voice, that they laid out their tongues a full half foot beyond their mouthes, as if Pantagruel had salted all their throats. Then began Panurge to speak, saying to the Englishman, Sir, are you come hither to dispute contentiously in those Propositions you have set down, or, otherwayes but to learn and know the truth? To which answered Thaumast, Sir, no other thing brought me hither but the great desire I had to learn, and to know that of which I have doubted all my life long, and have neither found book nor man able to content me in the resolution of those doubts which I have proposed: and as for disputing contentiously, I will not do it, for it is too base a thing, and therefore leave it to those sottish Sophisters, who in their disputes do not search for the truth, but for contradiction only and debate. Then said Panurge, if I who am but a mean and inconsiderable disciple of my Master my Lord Pantagruel, content and satisfie you in all and every thing, it were a thing below my said Master, wherewith to trouble him: therefore is it fitter that he be Chair-man, and sit as a Judge and Moderator of our discourse and purpose, and give you satisfaction in many things, wherein perhaps I shall be wanting to your expectation. Truly (said Thaumast) it is very well said: begin then. Now you must note that Panurge had set at the end of his long Codpiece a pretty tuft of red silk, as also of white, green and blew, and within it had put a faire orange. CHAPTER XIX How Panurge put to a Non-plus the Englishman, that argued by signes. EVERY body then taking heed, and hearkening with great silence, the Englishman lift up on high into the aire his two hands severally, clunching in all the tops of his fingers together after the manner which (a la chinonnese) they call the hens arse, and struck the one hand on the other by the nailes foure several times: then he opening them, struck the one with the flat of the other, till it yielded a clashing noise, and that only once: again in joyning them as before he struck twice, and afterwards foure times in opening them; then did he lay them joyned, and extended the one towards the other, as if he had been devoutly to send up his prayers unto God. Panurge suddenly lifted up in the aire his right hand, and put the thumb thereof into the nostril of the same side, holding his foure fingers streight out, and closed orderly in a parallel line to the point of his nose, shutting the left eye wholly, and making the other wink with a profound depression of the eye-brows and eye-lids. Then lifted he up his left hand, with hard wringing and stretching forth his foure fingers, and elevating his thumb, which he held in a line directly correspondent to the situation of his right hand, with the distance of a cubit and a halfe between them. This done, in the same forme he abased towards the ground, both the one and the other hand; Lastly, he held them in the midst, as aiming right at the English mans nose: And if Mercurie, said the English man: there Panurge interrupted him, and said, You have spoken, Mask. Then made the English man this signe, his left hand all open he lifted up into the aire, then instantly shut into his fist the foure fingers thereof, and his thumb extended at length he placed upon the gristle of his nose; Presently after, he lifted up his right hand all open, and all open abased and bent it downwards, putting the thumb thereof in the very place where the little finger of the left hand did close in the fist, and the foure right hand fingers he softly moved in the aire: then contrarily he did with the right hand what he had done with the left, and with the left what he had done with the right. Panurge, being not a whit amazed at this, drew out into the aire his Trismegist Codpiece with the left hand, and with his right drew forth a trunchion of a white oxe-rib, and two pieces of wood of a like forme, one of black eben, and the other of incarnation brasil, and put them betwixt the fingers of that hand in good Symmetrie; then knocking them together, made such a noise as the Lepers of Britanie use to do with their clappering clickets, yet better resounding, and farre more harmonious; and with his tongue contracted in his mouth, did very merrily warble it, alwayes looking fixedly upon the English man. The Divines, Physicians and Chirurgions, that were there, thought that by this signe he would have inferred that the English man was a Leper: the Counsellors, Lawyers and Decretalists conceived, that by doing this he would have concluded some kinde of mortal felicity to consist in Leprosie, as the Lord maintained heretofore. The English man for all this was nothing daunted, but holding up his two hands in the aire, kept them in such forme, that he closed the three master-fingers in his fist, and passing his thumbs through his indical, or foremost and middle fingers , his auricularie or little fingers remained extended and stretched out, and so presented he them to Panurge; then joyned he them so, that the right thumb touched the left, and the left little finger touched the right. Hereat Panurge, without speaking one word, lift up his hands and made this signe. He put the naile of the forefinger of his left hand, to the naile of the thumb of the same, making in the middle of the distance as it were a buckle, and of his right hand shut up all the fingers into his fist, except the forefinger, which he often thrust in and out through the said two others of the left hand: then stretched he out the forefinger, and middle finger or medical of his right hand, holding them asunder as much as he could, and thrusting them towards Thaumast. Then did he put the thumb of his left hand upon the corner of his left eye, stretching out all his hand like the wing of a bird or the finne of a fish, and moving it very daintily this way and that way, he did as much with his right hand upon the corner of his right eye. Thaumast began then to waxe somewhat pale, and to tremble, and made him this signe. With the middle finger of his right hand, he struck against the muscle of the palme or pulp, which is under the thumb: then put he the forefinger of the right hand in the like buckle of the left, but he put it under and not over, as Panurge did. Then Panurge knocked one hand against another, and blowed in his palme, and put again the forefinger of his right hand into the overture or mouth of the left, pulling it often in and out; then held he out his chinne, most intentively looking upon Thaumast. The people there which understood nothing in the other signes, knew very well what therein he demanded (without speaking a word to Thaumast,) What do you mean by that? In effect, Thaumast then began to sweat great drops, and seemed to all the Spectators a man strangely ravished in high contemplation. Then he bethought himself, and put all the nailes of his left hand against those of his right, opening his fingers as if they had been semicircles, and with this signe lift up his hands as high as he could. Whereupon Panurge presently put the thumb of his right hand under his jawes, and the little finger thereof in the mouth of the left hand, and in this posture made his teeth to sound very melodiously, the upper against the lower. With this Thaumast, with great toile and vexation of spirit rose up, but in rising let a great bakers fart, for the bran came after, and, pissing withal very strong vineger, stunk like all the devils in hell: the company began to stop their noses; for he had conskited himself with meer anguish and perplexity. Then lifted he up his right hand, clunching it in such sort, that he brought the ends of all his fingers to meet together, and his left hand he laid flat upon his breast: whereat Panurge drew out his long Codpiece with his tuffe, and stretched it forth a cubit and a half, holding it in the aire with his right hand, and with his left took out his orange, and, casting it up into the aire seven times, at the eight he hid it in the fist of his right hand, holding it steadily up on high, and then began to shake his faire Codpiece, shewing it to Thaumast. After that Thaumast began to puffe up his two cheeks like a player on a bagpipe, and blew as if he had been to puffe up a pigs bladder; whereupon Panurge put one finger of his left hand in his nockandrow, by some called St. Patricks hole, and with his mouth suck’t in the aire, in such a manner as when one eats oysters in the shell, or when we sup up our broth; this done, he opened his mouth somewhat, and struck his right hand flat upon it, making therewith a great and a deep sound, as if it came from the superficies of the midriffe through the trachiartere or pipe of the lungs, and this he did for sixteen times; but Thaumast did alwayes keep blowing like a goose. Then Panurge put the forefinger of his right hand into his mouth, pressing it very hard to the muscles thereof; then he drew it out, and withal made a great noise, as when little boyes shoot pellets out of the potcanons made of the hollow sticks of the branch of an auldertree, and he did it nine times. Then Thaumast cried out, Ha, my Masters, a great secret; with this he put in his hand up to the elbow; then drew out a dagger that he had, holding it by the point downwards; whereat Panurge took his long Codpiece, and shook it as hard as he could against his thighes; then put his two hands intwined in manner of a combe upon his head, laying out his tongue as farre as he was able, and turning his eyes in his head, like a goat that is ready to die. Ha, I understand (said Thaumast) but what? making such a signe, that he put the haft of his dagger against his breast, and upon the point thereof the flat of his hand, turning in a little the ends of his fingers; whereat Panurge held down his head on the left side, and put his middle finger into his right eare, holding up his thumb bolt upright; then he crost his two armes upon his breast, and coughed five times, and at the fifth time he struck his right foot against the ground: then he lift up his left arme, and closing all his fingers into his fist, held his thumbe against his forehead, striking with his right hand six times against his breast. But Thaumast, as not content therewith, put the thumb of his left hand upon the top of his nose, shutting the rest of his said hand, whereupon Panurge set his two Master-fingers upon each side of his mouth, drawing it as much as he was able, and widening it so, that he shewed all his teeth: and with his two thumbs pluck’t down his two eye-lids very low, making therewith a very ill-favour’d countenance, as it seemed to the company. CHAPTER XX How Thaumast relateth the vertues, and knowledge of Panurge. THEN Thaumast rose up, and putting off his cap, did very kindly thank the said Panurge, and with a loud voice said unto all the people that were there, My Lords, Gentlemen and others, at this time may I to some good purpose speak that Evangelical word , Et ecce plus quàm Salomon hîc: You have here in your presence an incomparable treasure, that is, my Lord Pantagruel, whose great renown hath brought me hither, out of the very heart of England, to conferre with him about the insoluble problemes, both in Magick, Alchymie, the Caballe, Geomancie, Astrologie and Philosophie, which I had in my minde: but at present I am angry, even with fame it self, which I think was envious to him, for that it did not declare the thousandth part of the worth that indeed is in him: You have seen how his disciple only hath satisfied me, and hath told me more than I asked of him: besides, he hath opened unto me, and resolved other inestimable doubts, wherein I can assure you he hath to me discovered the very true Well, Fountain, and Abysse of the Encyclopedeia of learning; yea in such a sort, that I did not think I should ever have found a man that could have made his skill appear, in so much as the first elements of that concerning which we disputed by signes, without speaking either word or half word. But in fine, I will reduce into writing that which we have said and concluded, that the world may not take them to be fooleries, and will thereafter cause them to be printed, that every one may learne as I have done. Judge then what the Master had been able to say, seeing the disciple hath done so valiantly; for, Non est discipulus super Magistrum. Howsoever God be praised, and I do very humbly thank you, for the honour that you have done us at this Act: God reward you for it eternally: the like thanks gave Pantagruel to all the company, and going from thence, he carried Thaumast to dinner with him, and beleeve that they drank as much as their skins could hold, or, as the phrase is, with unbuttoned bellies, (for in that age they made fast their bellies with buttons, as we do now the colars of our doublets or jerkins,) even till they neither knew where they were, nor whence they came. Blessed Lady, how they did carouse it, and pluck (as we say) at the Kids leather: and flaggons to trot, and they to toote, Draw, give (page) some wine here, reach hither, fill with a devil, so! There was not one but did drink five and twenty or thirty pipes, can you tell how? even Sicut terra sine aqua; for the weather was hot, and besides, that they were very dry. In matter of the exposition of the Propositions set down by Thaumast: and the signification of the signes which they used in their disputation, I would have set them down for you according to their own relation: but I have been told that Thaumast made a great book of it imprinted at London, wherein he hath set down all without omitting any thing, and therefore at this time I do passe by it. CHAPTER XXI How Panurge was in love with a Lady of Paris. PANURGE began to be in great reputation in the City of Paris, by means of this disputation, wherein he prevailed against the English man, and from thenceforth made his Codpiece to be very useful to him, to which effect he had it pinked with pretty little Embroideries after the Romanesca fashion; And the world did praise him publickly, in so farre that there was a song made of him, which little children did use to sing, when they went to fetch mustard: he was withal made welcome in all companies of Ladies and Gentlewomen, so that at last he became presumptuous, and went about to bring to his lure one of the greatest Ladies in the City: and indeed leaving a rabble of long prologues and protestations, which ordinarily these dolent contemplative Lent-lovers make, who never meddle with the flesh; one day he said unto her, Madam, it would be a very great benefit to the Common-wealth, delightful to you, honourable to your progeny, and necessary for me, that I cover you for the propagating of my race, and beleeve it, for experience will teach it you: the Lady at this word thrust him back above a hundred leagues, saying, You mischievous foole, is it for you to talk thus unto me? whom do you think you have in hand? be gone, never to come in my sight again; for if one thing were not, I would have your legs and armes cut off. Well, (said he) that were all one to me, to want both legs and armes, provided you and I had but"
"Au milieu d’icelle était une fontaine de fin albâtre, en figure heptagone, à ouvrage et infoliature[13] singulière, pleine d’eau tant claire que pourrait être un élément en sa simplicité, dedans laquelle était à demi posée la sacrée Bouteille, toute revêtue de pur cristallin[14], en forme ovale, excepté que le limbe[15] était quelque peu patent[16] plus qu’icelle forme ne porterait.","In the middle of it was a fountain of fine alabaster, in a heptagonal shape, with singular work and infoliature[13], full of water as clear as an element in its simplicity could be, in which was half placed the sacred Bottle, all coated with pure crystalline[14], oval in shape, except that the limbus[15] was somewhat patent[16] more than this shape would bear.","In the midst of it, heptagonal in shape, with leaf-work remarkably wrought, stood a fountain of fine alabaster, full of water as clear as any element in its simple state can ever be. In it, entirely encased in pure crystal, stood, half-immersed,","In the middle of it was an Heptagonal Fountain of fine Alablaster, most artfully wrought, full of Water, which was so clear, that it might have pass’d for Element in its purity and singleness. The Sacred Bottle was in it to the middle, clad in pure fine Christal, of an oval shape, except its Muzzle, which was somewhat wider than is consistent with that Figure."
"Le gouverneur d’icelle était messer Gaster, premier maître ès arts de ce monde. Si croyez que le feu soit le grand maître des arts, comme écrit Cicero, vous errez et vous faites[4] tort, car Cicero ne le crut onques. Si croyez que Mercure soit premier inventeur des arts, comme jadis croyaient nos antiques druides, vous fourvoyez grandement. La sentence du satirique est vraie qui dit messer Gaster être de tous arts le maître. Avec icelui pacifiquement résidait la bonne dame Pénie, autrement dite souffreté, mère des neuf Muses, de laquelle jadis en compagnie de Porus, seigneur d’abondance, nous naquit amour, le noble enfant médiateur du ciel et de la terre, comme atteste Platon in Symposio. À ce chaleureux roi, force nous fut faire révérence, jurer obéissance et honneur porter, car il est impérieux, rigoureux, rond, dur, difficile, inflexible. À lui on ne peut rien faire croire, rien remontrer, rien persuader. Il n’ouït point. Et comme les Égyptiens disaient Harpocras, dieu de silence, en grec nommé Sigalion, être astomé, c’est-à-dire sans bouche, ainsi Gaster sans oreilles fut créé, comme en Candie le simulacre[5] de Jupiter était sans oreilles. Il ne parle que par signes. Mais à ses signes tout le monde obéit plus soudain qu’aux édits des préteurs et mandements des rois. En ses sommations, délai, aucun et demeure aucune il n’admet. Vous dites qu’au rugissement du lion toutes bêtes loin à l’entour frémissent, tant (savoir est) qu’être peut sa voix ouïe. Il est écrit. Il est vrai. Je l’ai vu. Je vous certifie qu’au mandement de messer Gaster tout le ciel tremble, toute la terre branle. Son mandement est nommé faire le faut sans délai, ou mourir.","The governor of icelle was messer Gaster, first master of arts of this world. If you believe that fire is the great master of the arts, as Cicero writes, you are erring and doing [4] wrong, because Cicero never believed it. If you believe that Mercury is the first inventor of the arts, as our ancient druids once believed, you are greatly mistaken. The sentence of the satirist is true who says Messer Gaster to be the master of all arts. With him peacefully resided the good lady Penie, in other words suffering, mother of the nine Muses, from whom once in the company of Porus, lord of abundance, we were born love, the noble child mediator of heaven and earth, as Plato attests in Symposium. To this warm king, we were forced to bow, swear obedience and honor to bear, because he is imperious, rigorous, round, hard, difficult, inflexible. To him nothing can be made to believe, nothing to remonstrate, nothing to persuade. He does not hear. And as the Egyptians said Harpocras, god of silence, in Greek named Sigalion, to be astomated, that is to say without a mouth, so Gaster without ears was created, as in Candia the simulacrum [5] of Jupiter was without ears. He speaks only by signs. But to his signs everyone obeys more suddenly than to the edicts of praetors and commandments of kings. In his summons, delay, none and remains none he admits. You say that at the roar of the lion all the beasts far around quiver, as much (knowing is) as his voice can be heard. It is written. It is true. I saw it. I assure you that at the command of Messer Gaster the whole sky trembles, the whole earth shakes. His command is to do the right thing without delay, or die.","Its Governor was Messer Gaster, the first Master of the Arts of this world. If you think that fire is the Grand Master of the Arts as Cicero wrote, you are wrong and in error, for Cicero never believed it. If, as our ancient Druids used to believe, you think that Mercury is the first inventor of the arts, you are very mistaken. The judgement of the Satirist is true when he says that of all the arts Messer Gaster is the Master. (With him there peacefully dwelt Penia, that good Lady otherwise known as Want, the mother of the Nine Muses, from whom, in company with Porus, the Lord of Abundance, was born Love, that noble boy who mediates between Heaven and Earth, for which Plato vouches in The Symposium). To Gaster, that chivalrous King, all of us were obliged to pay homage, swear obedience and do honour, for he is imperious, round, rigorous, hard, difficult and unbending. You cannot get him to believe anything or to accept any contestation or persuasion. He hears nothing whatsoever. Harpocras (the god of Silence whom the Greeks knew as Sigalion) was by the Egyptians called astomé (that is, mouthless): Gaster was likewise created without any ears, as was the statue of Jupiter in Candia. Gaster talks only by signs; but everybody everywhere obeys those signs more promptly than the edicts of praetors or the commands of kings. Over his summonses he admits no delay, no demurral. People say that at the lion’s roar the beasts round about all shudder, as far that is as its voice carries. That’s written down. It’s true. I’ve seen it. But I assure you that, at the commandments of Messer Gaster, the whole welkin trembles and the Earth quakes. His commandment has been issued: obey it at once or die.","The Ruler of the place was one Master Gaster, the first Master of Arts in this World; for if you believe that Fire is the great Master of Arts, as Tully writes, you very much wrong him and your self; alas, Tully never believ’d this. On the other side, if you fancy Mercury to be the first Inventer of Arts, as our ancient Druids believ’d of old, you are mightily beside the Mark. The Satirist’s Sentence, that affirms Master Gaster to be Master of all Arts, is true. With him peacefully resided old Goody Penia alias Poverty, the Mother of the Ninety Nine Muses, on whom Porus the Lord of Plenty formerly begot Love, that Noble Child, the Mediator of Heaven and Earth, as Plato affirms in his Symposio. We were all oblig’d to pay our homage and swear Allegiance to that mighty Sovereign; for he is Imperious, Severe, Blunt, Hard, Uneasie, Inflexible; you cannot make him believe, represent to him, or persuade him any thing. He do’s not hear; and as the Egyptians said, That Harpocrates the God of Silence nam’d Sigalion in Greek was Astomé, that is, without a Mouth; so Gaster was created without Ears, even like the Image of Jupiter in Candia. He only speaks by Signs, but those Signs are more readily obey’d by every one, than the Statutes of Senates, or Commands of Monarchs; neither will he admit the least Lett, or delay in his Summons. You say, that when a Lyon roars all the Beasts at a considerable distance round about, as far as his Roar can be heard, are seiz’d with a shivering. This is written, ’Tis true, I have seen it. I assure you, that at Master Gaster’s Command, the very Heavens tremble, and all the Earth shakes, his Command is call’d, Do this or dye: Needs must whom the Devil drives, there’s no gain-saying of it."
"« O le beau mot ! À ce patron figurez notre microcosme (id est, petit monde, c’est l’homme), en tous ses membres ; prêtants, empruntants, devants, c’est-à-dire en son naturel, car nature n’a créé l’homme que pour prêter et emprunter. Plus grande n’est l’harmonie des cieux que sera de sa police. L’intention du fondateur de ce microcosme est y entretenir l’âme, laquelle il y a mise comme hôte, et la vie. La vie consiste en sang. Sang est le siège de l’âme ; pourtant[8] un seul labeur peine ce monde, c’est forger sang continuellement. En cette forge sont tous membres en office propre, et est leur hiérarchie telle que sans cesse l’un de l’autre emprunte, l’un à l’autre prête, l’un à l’autre est débiteur. La matière et métal convenable pour être en sang transmué est baillée par nature : pain et vin. En ces deux sont comprises toutes espèces des aliments, et de ce est dit le companage[9] en langage goth. Pour icelles trouver, préparer et cuire, travaillent les mains, cheminent les pieds et portent toute cette machine, les yeux tout conduisent. L’appétit, en l’orifice de l’estomac, moyennant un peu de mélancolie aigrette qui lui est transmis de la râtelle, admoneste d’enfourner viande. La langue en fait l’essai, les dents la mâchent, l’estomac la reçoit, digère et chylifie. Les veines mésaraïques[10] en sucent ce qu’est bon et idoine, délaissent les excréments (lesquels, par vertu expulsive, sont vidés hors par exprès conduits), puis la portent au foie. Il la transmue de rechef, et en fait sang. Lors quelle joie pensez-vous être entre ces officiers, quand ils ont vu ce ruisseau d’or, qui est leur seul restaurant ? Plus grande n’est la joie des alchimistes quand, après longs travaux, grand soin et dépense, ils voient les métaux transmués dedans leurs fourneaux.","“O the beautiful word! To this pattern figure our microcosm (id est, petit monde, c'est l'homme), in all its members; lending, borrowing, devant, that is to say in its naturalness, for nature created man only to lend and borrow. Greater is the harmony of the heavens than will be of his police. The intention of the founder of this microcosm is to maintain there the soul, which he has placed there as a guest, and life. Life consists of blood. Blood is the seat of the soul; yet [8] only one labor pains this world, it is to forge blood continually. In this forge are all members in proper office, and is their hierarchy such that one of the other ceaselessly borrows, one of the other lends, one of the other is a debtor. The matter and metal suitable to be in transmuted blood is yawned by nature: bread and wine. In these two are included all kinds of foods, and of this is said the companage[9] in gothic language. For them to find, prepare and cook, work the hands, walk the feet and carry all this machine, the eyes lead everything. Appetite, in the orifice of the stomach, by means of a little pungent melancholy which is transmitted to it from the rack, admonishes to put meat in the oven. The tongue tries it, the teeth chew it, the stomach receives it, digests it, and chylifies it. The mesaraic veins [10] suck what is good and suitable from it, abandon the excrement (which, by expulsive virtue, is emptied out by express conduits), then carry it to the liver. He transmutes it again, and makes blood out of it. When what joy do you think you were between these officers, when they saw this stream of gold, which is their only restaurant? Greater is the joy of the alchemists when, after long labours, great care and expense, they see the metals transmuted within their furnaces.","How beautifully put! ‘After such a model imagine this our microcosm, [i.e., this little world which is Man,] with all his members borrowing, lending, owing: that is to say, Man in his natural state. For Nature created Man but to lend and to borrow. The harmony of the heavens will not be grander than the harmony of his polity. ‘The intention of the Founder of this microcosm is to maintain therein its soul, whom he has placed within as its host, its life. Now life consists in blood. Blood is the seat of the soul. That is why one single task weighs down upon this microcosm: continually to forge blood. And in that forging all its members are in their proper roles, their hierarchy being such that each borrows from the other, each lends to the other. The material – the substance – proper to be transmuted into blood is supplied by Nature: bread and wine. Within those two are comprehended every kind of food: hence the term companage in Gothick Provençal. ‘It is to find, prepare and concoct them that the hands toil and that the feet walk and support the whole structure; the eyes oversee it; the appetite, within the orifice of the stomach, by means of a little black bile despatched by the spleen, warns it to load food into its oven: the tongue tastes it , the teeth chew it, the stomach receives it, digests it and turns it into chyle; the mesenteric arteries absorb from it what is good and proper (leaving aside the excrements which are voided through the expressly made conduits by an expulsive force) and convey it to the liver which at once transmutes it, turning it into blood. ‘What joy do you think there to be amongst all those artisans once they have seen that golden stream which is their sole restorative! No greater is the joy of alchemists when, after long labours and vast trouble and expense, they see the metals transmuted in their furnaces","O the fine Saying! Now let our Microcosm be fancied conform to this Model in all its Members; lending, borrowing and owing, (that is to say) according to its own Nature: For Nature hath not to any other end created Man, but to owe, borrow and lend; no greater is the Harmony amongst the Heavenly Spheres, than that which shall be found in its well-ordered Policy. The Intention of the Founder of this Microcosm is, to have a Soul therein to be entertained, which is lodged there, as a Guest with its Host, it may live there for a while. Life consisteth in Blood, Blood is the Seat of the Soul; therefore the chieftest Work of the Microcosm is, to be making Blood continually. At this Forge are exercised all the Members of the Body; none is exempted from Labour, each operates apart, and doth its proper Office. And such is their Hierarchy, that perpetually the one borrows from the other, the one lends the other, and the one is the others Debtor. The stuff and matter convenient which Nature giveth to be turned into Blood is Bread and Wine. All kind of nourishing Victuals is understood to be comprehended in these two, and from hence in the Gothish Tongue is called Companage. To find out this Meat and Drink, to prepare and boil it, the Hands are put to Work, the Feet do walk and bear up the whole Bulk of the Corporal Mass; the Eyes guide and conduct all; the Appetite in the Orifice of the Stomach, by means of little sowrish black Humour (called Melancholy) which is transmitted thereto from the Milt, giving warning to shut in the Food. The Tongue doth make the first Essay, and tastes it; the Teeth do chaw it, and the Stomach doth receive, digest and chylifie it; the Mesaraick Veins suck out of it what is good and fit, leaving behind the Excrements, which are, through special Conduits for that purpose, voided by an expulsive Faculty; thereafter it is carried to the Liver, where it being changed again, it by the vertue of the new Transmutation becomes Blood. What Joy, conjecture you, will then be found amongst those Officers, when they see this Rivolet of Gold, which is their sole Restorative? No greater is the Joy of Alchimists, when after long Travel, Toil and Expence, they see in their Furnaces the Transmutation: Then is it that every Member doth prepare it self, and strive a-new to purifie and to refine this Treasure."

"Ce disant, ouït la litanie et les mémentos des prêtres qui portaient sa femme en terre, dont laissa son bon propos et tout soudain fut ravi ailleurs, disant : « Seigneur Dieu, faut-il que je me contriste encore ? Cela me fâche, je ne suis plus jeune, je deviens vieux, le temps est dangereux, je pourrai prendre quelque fièvre : me voilà affolé. Foi de gentilhomme, il vaut mieux pleurer moins et boire davantage. Ma femme est morte, et bien, par Dieu (da jurandi), je ne la ressusciterai pas par mes pleurs. Elle est bien ; elle est en paradis pour le moins, si mieux n’est. Elle prie Dieu pour nous ; elle est bien heureuse ; elle ne se soucie plus de nos misères et calamités. Autant nous en pend à l’œil. Dieu gard’ le demeurant ! Il me faut penser d’en trouver une autre.","So saying, heard the litany and the mementos of the priests who bore his wife in the ground, from whom left his good word and suddenly was delighted elsewhere, saying: “Lord God, must I still be saddened? This annoys me, I'm no longer young, I'm getting old, the weather is dangerous, I could catch a fever: here I am in a panic. Faith of a gentleman, it is better to cry less and drink more. My wife is dead, well, by God (da jurandi), I will not raise her with my tears. She's fine ; she is in paradise to say the least, if not better. She prays to God for us; she is very happy; she no longer cares about our miseries and calamities. As much as we can see. God save the rest! I have to think about finding another one.","Whose ways are so rare, Companions fair. Come ye inside; who God’s Good News declare With subtle sense while enemies do chide. Here find a tower and refuge from the snare Of hostile Error whose wiles ever dare With falsest style the Truth from all to hide. Found faith profound, here ever to abide. Then we’ll confound with Truth, written and heard, The vilest foes by our God’s Holy Word. By God’s Holy Word! Truth ever be heard In this holy site. With Truth gird the knight.","As he spake this, he heard the Letanies and the memento’s of the Priests that carried his wife to be buried, upon which he left the good purpose he was in, and was suddenly ravished another way, saying, Lord God, must I again contrist my self? this grieves me; I am no longer young, I grow old, the weather is dangerous; I may perhaps take an ague, then shall I be foiled, if not quite undone; by the faith of a Gentleman, it were better to cry lesse, and drink more. My wife is dead, well, by G—, (da jurandi) I shall not raise her again by my crying: she is well , she is in Paradise at least, if she be no higher: she prayeth to God for us , she is happy, she is above the sense of our miseries, nor can our calamities reach her: what though she be dead, must not we also die? The same debt which she hath paid, hangs over our heads; nature will require it of us, and we must all of us some day taste of the same sauce: let her passe then, and the Lord preserve the Survivors; for I must now cast about how to get another wife."

"Mais Ponocrates lui conseilla qu’ils se transportassent vers le seigneur de la Vauguyon qui de tous temps avait été leur ami et confédéré, et par lui seraient mieux avisés de tous affaires, ce qu’ils firent incontinent et le trouvèrent en bonne délibération de leur secourir, et fut d’opinion qu’il enverrait quelqu’un de ses gens pour découvrir le pays et savoir en quel état étaient les ennemis, afin d’y procéder par conseil pris selon la forme de l’heure présente.

Gymnast offered to go there; but it was concluded that, for the better, he would take with him someone who knew the ways and twists and the rivers round about.","by him they would be better informed about all that was going on. They did so at once and found him already fully determined to help them; his opinion was that he should send one of his men to reconnoitre the pays to learn how the enemy was situated so that they could act upon counsel based on how things actually stood at that time. Gymnaste offered to go, and it was decided that it would be better if he took along with him someone who knew the highways and byways and the local rivers.","These strange and almost incredible newes of the enormous abuses, thus committed over all the land, so affrighted Gargantua, that he knew not what to say nor do: but Ponocrates counselled him to go unto the Lord of Vauguyon, who at all times had been their friend and confederate, and that by him they should be better advised in their businesse: which they did incontinently, and found him very willing, and fully resolved to assist them, and therefore was of opinion, that they should send some one of his company, to scout along and discover the countrey, to learn in what condition and posture the enemy was, that they might take counsel, and proceed according to the present occasion. Gymnast offered himself to go; whereupon it was concluded, that for his safety, and the better expedition, he should have with him some one that knew the wayes, avenues, turnings, windings and rivers thereabout."
"L’argent de tous montait, par les pactes[1] a qu’ils lui envoyaient, six vingt quatorze millions deux écus et demi d’or.

Lequel offre Gargantua ne refusa ni accepta du tout. Mais grandement les remerciant, dit qu’il composerait[5] cette guerre par tel engin[6] que besoin ne serait tant empêcher[7] de gens de bien. Seulement envoya qui[8] amènerait en ordre les légions lesquelles entretenait ordinairement en ses places de la Devinière, de Chaviny, de Gravot et Quinquenais, montant en nombre deux mille cinq cents hommes d’armes, soixante et six mille hommes de pied, vingt et six mille arquebusiers, deux cents grosses pièces d’artillerie, vingt et deux mille pionniers, et six mille chevaux-légers, tous par bandes, tant bien assorties de leurs trésoriers, de vivandiers, de maréchaux, d’armuriers et autres gens nécessaires au trac[9] de bataille, tant bien instruits en art militaire, tant bien armés, tant bien reconnaissants et suivants leurs enseignes, tant soudains à entendre et obéir à leurs capitaines, tant expédiés[10] à courir, tant forts à choquer[11], tant prudents à l’aventure, que mieux ressemblaient une harmonie d’orgues et concordance d’horloge qu’une armée ou gendarmerie.","The money of all amounted, by the pacts [1] a they sent him, six twenty-four million two and a half crowns of gold. The people were fifteen thousand men-at-arms, thirty-two thousand light horses, eighty-nine ""thousand arquebusiers, one hundred and forty thousand adventurers, eleven thousand two hundred cannons, double cannons, basilisks and spiroles[2], pioneers forty-seven thousand : all bribed[3] and supplied[4] for six months and four days. Which offer Gargantua neither refused nor accepted at all. But greatly thanking them, said that he would compose[5] this war by such device[6] that need would not be to prevent so many good people. Only sent who [8] would bring in order the legions which usually maintained in their places of Devinière, Chaviny, Gravot and Quinquenais, amounting in number two thousand five hundred men-at-arms, sixty-six thousand foot soldiers, twenty-six thousand arquebusiers, two hundred large pieces of artillery, twenty-two thousand pioneers, and six thousand light horses, all in bands, as well matched by their treasurers , vivandiers, marshals, armu riers and other people necessary for the trac[9] of battle, so well instructed in the military art, so well armed, so much grateful and following their ensigns, so sudden to hear and obey their captains, so dispatched[10] to run, so strong to shock[11], so cautious at risk, that a harmony of organs and concordance of clocks resembled an army or police better.","The tribute offered him by all their contributions amounted to six score and fourteen millions in gold [plus two and a half]; the forces, to fifteen thousand men-at-arms, thirty-two thousand light horsemen, eighty-nine thousand harquebusiers, a hundred and forty thousand soldiers of fortune, gunners with eleven thousand two hundred cannons, double-cannons, basilisks and spiroles, and forty-seven thousand pioneers. All to be paid and victualled for six months [and four days] ahead. Gargantua neither entirely refused nor entirely accepted the offer but, warmly thanking the envoys, said that he would settle this war by such a stratagem that it would not be necessary to bother so many good men. He merely sent to tell his legions (regularly maintained in his forts at La Deviniere, Chavigny, Gravot and Quinquenays) to come in good order. They amounted in all to twelve hundred men-of-arms, thirty-six thousand foot, thirteen thousand harquebusiers, the crews of four hundred great artillery-pieces, and twenty-two thousand pioneers.36 They were divided up into troops so well provided with paymasters, quartermasters, horse-smiths, armourers and other men needed for the battle-train, so well drilled in the art of war, so well armed, so sure of recognizing and following their ensigns, so prompt at hearing and obeying their captains, so swift at running, so strong in engaging the enemy, so wise in their daring, that they were more like clock-work or an harmonious organ than troops of soldiers or an army.","ABOUT this same time those of Besse, of the old Market, of St. James bourg, of the draggage of Parille, of the Rivers, of the rocks St. Pol, of the Vaubreton, of Pautille, of the Brahemont, of Clainbridge, of Cravant, of Grammont, of the town at the Badgerholes, of Huymes, of Serge, of Husse, of St. Lovant, of Panzoust, of the Coldraux, of Vernon, of Coulaines, of Chose, of Varenes, of Bourgueil, of the Bouchard Claud, of the Croulay, of Narsie, of Cand, of Monsoreau, and other bordering places, sent Ambassadours unto Grangousier, to tell him that they were advised of the great wrongs which Picrochole had done him, and in regard of their ancient confederacy, offered him what assistance they could afford, both in money, victuals and ammunition, and other necessaries for warre; The money, which by the joynt agreement of them all was sent unto him, amounted to sixscore and fourteen millions, two crowns and a half of pure gold. The forces wherewith they did assist him, did consist in fifteen thousand cuirasiers, two and thirty thousand light horsemen, fourscore and nine thousand dragoons, and a hundred and fourty thousand voluntier adventurers. These had with them eleven thousand and two hundred cannons, double cannons, long pieces of Artillery called Basilisks, and smaller sized ones, known by the name of spirols, besides the mortar-pieces and granadoes. Of pioneers they had seven and fourty thousand, all victualled and payed for six moneths and foure dayes of advance: which offer Gargantua did not altogether refuse, nor wholly accept of: but giving them hearty thanks, said that he would compose and order the warre by such a device, that there should not be found great need to put so many honest men to trouble in the managing of it; And therefore was content at that time to give order only for bringing along the legions, which he maintained in his ordinary Garisontownes of the Deviniere, of Chavignie, of Gravot, and of Quinquenais, amounting to the number of two thousand cuirasiers, threescore and six thousand foot-souldiers, six and twenty thousand dragoons, attended by two hundred pieces of great ordnance, two and twenty thousand Pioneers, and six thousand light horsemen, all drawn up in troupes, so well befitted and accommodated with their commissaries, sutlers, ferriers, harnasse-makers, and other such like necessary members in a military camp; so fully instructed in the Art of warfare, so perfectly knowing and following their colours, so ready to hear and obey their Captains, so nimble to run, so strong at their charging, so prudent in their adventures, and every day so well disciplined, that they seemed rather to be a consort of organ-pipes, or mutual concord of the wheels of a clock, then an infantry and cavalry, or army of souldiers."

The men were apparelled after their fashion: their stockins were of tamine or of cloth-serge, of white, black, scarlet, or some other ingrained colour: their breeches were of velvet, of the same colour with their stockins, or very near, embroidered and cut according to their fancy; their doublet was of cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, of velvet, sattin, damask, taffaties, &c. of the same colours, cut, embroidered, and suitably trimmed up in perfection: the points were of silk of the same colours; the tags were of gold well enameled: their coats and jerkins were of cloth of gold, cloth of silver, gold, tissue or velvet embroidered; as they thought fit: their gownes were every whit as costly as those of the Ladies: their girdles were of silk, of the colour of their doublets; every one had a gallant sword by his side, the hilt and handle whereof were gilt, and the scabbard of velvet, of the colour of his breeches, with a chape of gold, and pure Goldsmiths work: the dagger was of the same: their caps or bonnets were of black velvet, adorned with jewels and buttons of gold: upon that they wore a white plume, most prettily and minion-like parted by so many rowes of gold spangles, at the end whereof hung dangling in a more sparkling resplendencie faire rubies, emeralds, diamonds, &c. But there was such a sympathy betwixt the gallants & the Ladies, that every day they were apparelled in the same livery: and that they might not misse , there were certain Gentlemen appointed to tell the youths every morning what vestments the Ladies would on that day weare; for all was done according to the pleasure of the Ladies. In these so handsome clothes, and abiliaments so rich, think not that either one or other of either sex did waste any time at all; for the Masters of the wardrobes had all their raiment and apparel so ready for every morning, and the chamber-Ladies so well skilled, that in a trice they would be dressed, and compleatly in their clothes from head to foot. And to have those accoutrements with the more conveniency; there was about the wood of Teleme a row of houses of the extent of half a league, very neat and cleanly, wherein dwelt the Goldsmiths, Lapidaries, Jewellers, Embroiderers, Tailors, Gold-drawers, Velvet-weavers, Tapestrie-makers and Upholsters, who wrought there every one in his own trade, and all for the aforesaid jollie Friars and Nuns of the new stamp; they were furnished with matter and stuffe from the hands of the Lord Nausiclete, who every year brought them seven ships from the Perlas & Cannibal-islands, laden with ingots of gold, with raw silk, with pearles and precious stones. And if any margarites (called unions) began to grow old, and lose somewhat of their natural whitenesse and lustre, those with their Art they did renew, by tendering them to eat to some pretty cocks, as they use to give casting unto hawkes."

"– C’est que les mouches en sont tant friandes que merveilles, et s’y cueilleraient[7] facilement et y feraient leur ordure, et voilà l’ouvrage gâté. Mais voici comment l’on y remédierait. Il faudrait très bien les émoucheter avec belles queues de renards ou bons gros viets d’azes[8] de Provence, et à ce propos, je vous veux dire (nous en allants pour souper) un bel exemple que met Frater Lubinus, libro de Compotationibus mendicantium.","– It is because the flies are as fond of it as marvels, and would pick [7] easily there and make their filth there, and here is the spoiled work. But here's how we would fix it. They should very well be blunted with beautiful foxtails or good big viets d'azes[8] from Provence, and in this regard, I want to tell you (we are going to supper) a fine example that Frater Lubinus, libro de Compotationibus mendicantium.","Such was the promise. How must we revere Him who unto the End does persevere. The reading of this muniment fully completed, Gargantua sighed deeply and said to those about him: ‘It is not only nowadays that those are persecuted who are led back to belief in the Gospel: but","It is that the flies would be so lickorish of them, that you would wonder, and would quickly gather there together, and there leave their ordure and excretions, and so all the work would be spoiled. But see how that might be remedied, they must be wiped and made rid of the flies with faire fox-tailes, or good great viedazes (which are Asse-pizzles) of Provence. And to this purpose I will tell you (as we go to supper,) a brave example set down by Frater Lubinus libro de compotationibus mendicantium; in the time that the beasts did speak, which is not yet three dayes since."

"– Ho ! dit-il, vous n’êtes tant male[8] que vous dites ; non, ou je suis bien trempé à votre physionomie, car plutôt la terre monterait ès cieux, et les hauts cieuxdescendraient en l’abîme, et tout ordre de nature serait perverti qu’en si grande beauté et élégance comme la vôtre y eût une goutte de fiel ni de malice. L’on dit bien qu’à grand peine :","- Whoa! said he, you are not so bad as you say; no, or I am very tempered by your countenance, for rather the earth would ascend to the heavens, and the high heavens would descend into the abyss, and all order of nature would be perverted so that in such great beauty and elegance as yours there would be a drop of gall or malice. It is said that with great difficulty:","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Ha, (said he), you are not so bad as you say, no, or else I am deceived in your physiognomie, for sooner shall the earth mount up unto the Heavens, and the highest Heavens descend unto the Hells, and all the course of nature be quite perverted, then that in so great beauty and neatnesse as in you is, there should be one drop of gall or malice: they say indeed, that hardly shall a man ever see a faire woman that is not also stubborn:"
"Un jour Pantagruel, se pormenant hors de la ville, vers l’abbaye Saint-Antoine, devisant et philosophant avec ses gens et aucuns écoliers, rencontra un homme beau de stature et élégant en tous linéaments du corps, mais pitoyablement navré[1] en divers lieux, et tant mal en ordre qu’il semblait être échappé aux chiens, ou mieux ressemblait un cueilleur de pommes du pays du Perche. De tant loin que le vit Pantagruel, il dit aux assistants : « Voyez-vous cet homme qui vient par le chemin du Pont-Charenton ? Par ma foi, il n’est pauvre que par fortune, car je vous assure qu’à sa physionomie, Nature l’a produit de riche et noble lignée ; mais les aventures des gens curieux l’ont réduit en telle pénurie et indigence. » Et ainsi qu’il fut au droit[2] d’entre eux, il lui demanda : « Mon ami, je vous prie qu’un peu veuillez ici arrêter et me répondre à ce que vous demanderai, et vous ne vous en repentirez point, car j’ai affection[3] très grande de vous donner aide à mon pouvoir en la calamité où je vous vois, car vous me faites grand pitié. Pourtant, mon ami, dites-moi, qui êtes-vous ? dont[4] venez-vous ? où allez-vous ? que quérez-vous, et quel est votre nom ? »","One day Pantagruel, walking out of the city, towards the Abbey of Saint-Antoine, chatting and philosophizing with his people and no scholars, met a man handsome in stature and elegant in every lineament of body, but pitifully sorry[1] in various places, and so out of order that he seemed to have escaped the dogs, or rather looked like an apple picker from the Perche region. From as far away as Pantagruel saw him, he said to those present: “Do you see this man coming by the Chemin du Pont-Charenton? By my faith, he is poor only by fortune, for I assure you that in his physiognomy, Nature produced him of rich and noble lineage; but the adventures of curious people have reduced it to such penury and poverty. ""And as he was right among them, he asked him: ""My friend, I beg you that a little please stop here and answer me what you ask, and you will not regret it. point, because I have a very great affection [3] to give you help in my power in the calamity where I see you, because you make me feel great pity. Yet, my friend, tell me, who are you? where[4] are you from? where are you going ? what are you asking for, and what is your name? »","In each of the anti-chambers stood a crystal looking-glass, framed in fine gold and surrounded by pearls; it was large enough to give a true reflection of the whole person. Hard by the entrance leading to the ladies’ chambers were the perfumers and hairdressers, through whose hands the men passed when they called on the ladies. They also furnished the ladies’ apartments every morning with distilled [rose water,] or ange-water and angel-water, as well as that precious thing, a perfuming-pot, exhaling many kinds of aromatic vapours. How the monks and nuns of Thélème were dressed CHAPTER 54 [Becomes Chapter 56. This luxury Abbey has been reformed, but only by agreement over matters of dress. The ‘sympathy’ which existed between the noblemen and the ladies has wide implications. Renaissance sympathy is, as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary: ‘A (real; or supposed) affinity between certain things – here, people – ‘by virtue of which they are similarly or correspondingly affected by the same influence, affect or influence one another (especially in some occult way) or attract or tend towards each other’.","ONE day as Pantagruel was taking a walk without the City, towards St. Antonies Abbey, discoursing and philosophating with his own servants and some other Scholars, he met with a young man of very comely stature, and surpassing handsome in all the lineaments of his body, but in several parts thereof most pitifully wounded; in such bad equipage in matter of his apparel, which was but tatters and rags, and every way so far out of order, that he seemed to have been a fighting with mastiffedogs, from whose fury he had made an escape, or, to say better, he looked in the condition wherein he then was, like an Apple-gatherer of the countrey of Perche. As farre off as Pantagruel saw him, he said to those that stood by: Do you see that man there, who is a coming hither upon the road from Charanton-bridge? by my faith, he is only poor in fortune; for I may assure you, that by his Physiognomie it appeareth, that nature hath extracted him from some rich and noble race, and that too much curiosity hath thrown him upon adventures, which possibly have reduced him to this indigence, want and penurie. Now as he was just amongst them, Pantagruel said unto him, Let me intreat you, (friend) that you may be pleased to stop here a little, and answer me to that which I shall ask you, and I am confident you will not think your time ill-bestowed; for I have an extream desire (according to my ability), to give you some supply in this distresse , wherein I see you are; because I do very much commiserate your case, which truly moves me to great pity; Therefore (my friend) tell me, who you are? Whence you come? whither you go? what you desire? and what your name is?"

"Ces mots dits, Panurge la salua profondément, lui présenta six langues de bœuf fumées, un grand pot beurrier plein de coscotons[7], un bourrabaquin[8] garni de breuvage, une couille de bélier pleine de carolus nouvellement forgés, enfin, avec profonde révérence, lui mit on[9] doigt médical une verge d’or bien belle, en laquelle était une crapaudine[10] de Beusse magnifiquement enchâssée. Puis, en brèves paroles, lui exposa le motif de sa venue, la priant courtoisement lui dire son avis et bonne fortune de son mariage entrepris.","Having said these words, Panurge bowed to her deeply, presented her with six smoked ox tongues, a large butter pot full of cocotons[7], a bourrabaquin[8] filled with beverage, a ram's ball full of newly forged carolus, finally, with profound reverence, placed on him a medical finger a very beautiful golden rod, in which was a magnificently embedded Beusse toad [10]. Then, in brief words, explained to her the reason for her coming, courteously asking her to tell him her opinion and good fortune for her marriage.","After saying those words Panurge made a deep bow and presented her with six smoked ox-tongues, a huge butter-jar full of fried meat-balls, a flagon full of drink, and a ram’s-cod stuffed with newly minted Carolus-shillings; then finally he made a profound obeisance and placed upon her leech-finger a very handsome golden ring in which was splendidly set a toadstone from Beuxes. Then in a few words he expounded the motive for his visit, courteously begging her to give him her advice and to foretell the future awaiting his projected marriage.","No sooner were these Words spoken, when Panurge coming up towards her, after the Ceremonial performance of a profound and humble Salutation, presented her with six Neats-Tongues dried in the Smoke, a great Butter-pot full of fresh Cheese, a Boracho furnished with good Beverage, and a Rams Cod stored with Single Pence newly coyned: At last he, with a low Curtsie, put on her Medical Finger a pretty handsom Golden-Ring, whereinto was right artificially inchased a precious Toadstone of Beausse. This done, in few words, and very succinctly did he set open and expose unto her the motive Reason of his coming, most civilly and courteously entreating her, that she might be pleased to vouchsafe to give him an ample and plenary Intelligence, concerning the future good luck of his intended Marriage."

"En cette même saison, Fayoles, quart[1] roi de Numidie, envoya du pays d’Afrique à Grandgousier une jument la plus énorme et la plus grande que fut onques vue, et la plus monstrueuse (comme assez savez qu’Afrique apporte toujours quelque chose de nouveau), car elle était grande comme six oriflans[2], et avait les pieds fendus en doigts comme le cheval de Jules César, les oreilles ainsi pendantes comme les chèvres de Languegoth[3] et une petite corne au cul. Au reste, avait poil d’alezan toustade[4], entreillisé de grises pommelettes. Mais sur tout avait la queue horrible, car elle était, poi plus poi moins[5], grosse comme la pile Saint-Mars auprès de Langés, et ainsi carrée, avec les brancards[6] ni plus ni moins ennicrochés[7] que sont les épis au blé.","In this same season, Fayoles, quarter[1] king of Numidia, sent from the country of Africa to Grandgousier the most enormous and largest mare that was ever seen, and the most monstrous (as you know that Africa always brings something new), for she was as tall as six oriflans[2], and had her feet split into toes like Julius Caesar's horse, her ears hanging down like the goats of Languegoth[3], and a little horn in her ass. For the rest, he had chestnut tufted hair [4], criss-crossed with gray cheekbones. But above all had a horrible tail, for it was, more or less[5], as big as the Saint-Mars pile near Langés, and thus square, with the stretchers[6] neither more nor less intertwined[7] than are the ears of wheat.","CHAPTER 15 [Becomes Chapter 16. ‘Out of Africa ever comes something new’ is one of the best-known sayings of Pliny. It forms an adage of Erasmus (III, VII, X). It was Froissart during the wars who made the famous remark (which Grandgousier inverts): ‘Were it not for Messieurs the Clerics we would all live like beasts.’ Here and elsewhere Rabelais changed ‘Languedoc’ into ‘Languegoth’ by a false etymology suggestive of depised Gothic roots.] In that same season, Fayoles the Fourth, King of Numidia, sent Grandgousier a mare from the shores of Africa: she was the biggest and most enormous that had ever been seen, and the most marvellous – you know of course that Out of Africa ever comes something new – for she was as large as six elephants, had hoofs split into toes like the horse of Julius Caesar’s, and her ears hung down as far as those of the goats of Languegoth. On her rump she bore a tiny horn. For the rest, her coat was the colour of burnt chestnuts with a trellis-work of dapple-grey; her tail especially was quite horrifying, for – give or take a little – it was as wide and as square as the tower of Saint-Mars near Langès and had tufts of hair plaited like ears of corn.","IN the same season Fayoles, the fourth King of Numidia, sent out of the countrey of Africk to Grangousier, the most hideously great Mare that ever was seen, and of the strangest forme, (for you know well enough how it is said, that Africk alwayes is productive of some new thing:) she was as big as six elephants, and had her feet cloven into fingers, like Julius Cœsars horse, with slouch-hanging eares, like the goats in Languedoc, and a little horne on her buttock; she was of a burnt sorel hue, with a little mixture of daple gray spots, but above all she had a horrible taile; for it was little more or lesse, then every whit as great as the Steeple-pillar of St. Mark beside Langes: and squared as that is, with tuffs and ennicroches, or haireplaits wrought within one another, no otherwise then as the beards are upon the eares of corne."
"– Nous, dit Pantagruel, ne sommes mie[4] juifs, et n’est chose confessée ni avérée qu’elle soit sorcière. Remettons à votre retour le grabeau[5] et belutement[6] de ces matières. Que savons-nous si c’est une onzième sibylle, une seconde Cassandre ? Et or[7] que sibylle ne fût et de sibylle ne méritât le nom, quel intérêt[8] encourrez-vous, avec elle conférant de votre perplexité, entendu mêmement qu’elle est en existimation de plus savoir, plus entendre que ne porte l’usance ni du pays, ni du sexe ? Que nuit savoir toujours et toujours apprendre, fût-ce","“We,” said Pantagruel, “are not Jews, and it is neither confessed nor proven that she is a witch. Let us deliver the grabeau[5] and belutement[6] of these matters upon your return. What do we know if it is an eleventh sibyl, a second Cassandra? And now [7] that sibyl was not and sibyl did not deserve the name, what interest [8] will you incur, with her conferring your perplexity, even understanding that she is in existence to know more, more hear than does not bear Usance neither of the country, nor of the sex? What night always knowing and always learning, were it","‘Well, we’re not Jews,’ said Pantagruel, ‘nor is it an admitted and proven fact that she is a sorceress. Let us put off the sifting and sieving of such matters until after you get back. How can we tell whether she is not an eleventh Sybil, a second Cassandra. Even if she is not a sybil and unworthy of such a name, what risk do you run by consulting her about your perplexity, especially since she is reckoned to know more, and understand more, than is customary in that part of the world and amongst her sex. What harm is there in always learning something, knowing of something, even from a sot, a pot, a mug, a kitten or a mitten? ‘Remember Alexander the Great: having won a victory over King Darius at Arbela, he, in the presence of his satraps, once denied a hearing to some fellow, only vainly to regret it thousands upon thousands of times. There he was, victorious in Persia, but so far from his ancestral kingdom of Macedonia that it deeply worried him that he could find no way of getting news from it, partly on account of the enormous distance between the two lands, partly because of the barrier of huge rivers, the hurdles of deserts and the obstacles of mountains. During such critical and anxious reflections – which were no small concern, for his lands might have been occupied, a new king installed and a new colony planted there before he could learn of it and counter it – there appeared before him a man from Sidonia, a merchant experienced and intelligent yet unprepossessing and fairly poor, who firmly declared that he had discovered ways and means by which, in less than five days, Alexander’s own country could learn of his Indian victories and he could learn of the situation in Macedonia and Egypt. Alexander reckoned the claim to be so outrageous and unfeasible that he would not give the man a hearing nor grant him an audience. What would it have cost him to listen and to learn what that man had discovered? What harm or hurt would he have suffered from knowing what were the means and method which that man wanted to show him? ‘It seems to me that it was not without cause that Nature fashioned us with open ears without imposing upon them any gate or closure as she has with our eyes, tongues and all other bodily apertures. I think that it was to enable us, night and day, continuously to hear and perpetually to learn from our sense of hearing, for it is of all our senses the most apt for learning.","We are not Jews, (quoth Pantagruel) nor is it a matter judiciously confess’d by her, nor authentically proved by others that she is a Witch. Let us for the present suspend our Judgment, and defer till after your return from thence, the sifting and garbeling of those Niceties. Do we know but that she may be an Eleventh Sibyl, or a Second Cassandra? But although she were neither, and she did not merit the Name or Title of any of these Renowned Prophetesses, what Hazard, in the Name of God, do you run, by offering to talk and confer with her of the instant Perplexity and Perturbation of your Thoughts? Seeing especially (and which is most of all) she is in the Estimation of those that are acquainted with her, held to know more, and to be of a deeper reach of Understanding, than is either customary to the Country wherein she liveth, or to the Sex whereof she is. What hindrance, hurt or harm doth the laudable desire of Knowledge bring to any Man, were it from a Sot, a Pot, a Fool, a Stool, a Winter Mittam, a Truckle for a Pully, the Lid of a Goldsmiths Crucible, an Oil Bottle, or old Slipper? You may remember to have read, or heard at least, that Alexander the Great, immediately after his having obtained a glorious Victory over the King Darius in Arbeles, refused in the Presence of the splendid and illustrious Courtiers that were about him, to give Audience to a poor certain despicable-like Fellow, who through the Solicitations and Mediation of some of his Royal Attendants was admitted humbly to beg that Grace and Favour of him: But sore did he repent, although in vain, a thousand and ten thousand times thereafter, the surly State which he then took upon him to the Denial of so just a Suit, the Grant whereof would have been worth unto him the value of a Brace of potent Cities. He was indeed Victorious in Persia, but withal so far distant from Macedonia, his Hereditary Kingdom, that the Joy of the one did not expel the extream Grief, which through occasion of the other he had inwardly conceived; for not being able with all his Power to find or invent a convenient Mean and Expedient, how to get or come by the certainty of any News from thence; both by reason of the huge remoteness of the places from one to another, as also because of the impeditive Interposition of many great Rivers, the interjacent Obstacle of divers wild Deserts, and obstructive Interjection of sundry almost inaccessible Mountains. Whilst he was in this sad quandary and solicitous pensiveness, which, you may suppose, could not be of a small Vexation to him; considering that it was a matter of no great difficulty to run over his whole Native Soil, possess his Country, seize on his Kingdom, install a new King in the Throne, and plant thereon Foreign Colonies, long before he could come to have any Advertisement of it. For obviating the Jeopardy of so dreadful Inconveniency, and putting a fit Remedy thereto, a certain Sydonian Merchant of a low Stature, but high Fancy, very poor in shew, and to the outward appearance of little or no Account, having presented himself before him, went about to affirm and declare, that he had excogitated and hit upon a ready mean and way, by the which those of his Territories at home should come to the certain notice of his Indian Victories, and himself be perfectly informed of the state and condition of Egypt and Macedonia within less than five days. Whereupon the said Alexander, plunged into a sullen Animadvertency of Mind, through his rash Opinion of the Improbability of performing a so strange and impossible-like Undertaking, dismissed the Merchant without giving ear to what he had to say, and villify’d him. What could it have cost him to hearken unto what the honest Man had invented and contrived for his good? What Detriment, Annoyance, Damage or Loss could he have undergone to listen to the Discovery of that Secret, which the good Fellow would have most willingly revealed unto him? Nature, I am perswaded, did not without a cause frame our Ears open, putting thereto no Gate at all, nor shutting them up with any manner of Inclosures, as she hath done unto the Tongue, the Eyes, and other such out-jetting parts of the Body: The Cause, as I imagine, is, to the end that every Day and every Night, and that continually, we may be ready to hear, and by a perpetual hearing apt to learn: For of all the Senses, it is the fittest for the reception of the knowledge of Arts, Sciences and Disciplines; and it may be, that Man was an Angel, (that is to say, a Messenger sent from God) as Raphael was to Toby."

He himself held one in his hand, wanting to show that they only asked for peace and that they came to buy it.","To lead the convoy and see it all through, he despatched Gallet, who, on the way, near the Willow Grove, had a great many bunches of reeds and rushes cut and strung about the carts and each of the carters; he himself bore one in his hand to let it be understood that they were seeking nothing but peace and were coming to pay for it.","the Apple-Orchard called La Pomardiere; for the conveyance and passing of all which was sent Gallet, who by the way as they went made them gather near the willow-trees great store of boughs, canes and reeds, wherewith all the Cariers were injoyned to garnish and deck their carts, and each of them to carry one in his hand, as himself likewise did, thereby to give all men to understand that they demanded but Peace, and that they came to buy it."

Mais j’en ai composé un grand livre intitulé l’Histoire des Gorgias, car ainsi les ai-je nommés, parce qu’ils demeurent en la gorge de mon maître Pantagruel. Finalement voulus retourner, et, passant par sa barbe, me jetai sur ses épaules, et de là me dévale en terre, et tombe devant lui. Quand il m’aperçut, il me demanda : « Dond[11] viens-tu, Alcofribas ? » Je lui réponds : « De votre gorge, monsieur.","There I began to think that it is quite true what they say that half the world does not know how the other lives, since no one had yet written from that country, to which there are more than twenty-five kingdoms. inhabited, without the deserts and a large arm of the sea. But I composed a great book of them entitled the History of the Gorgias, for so I named them, because they dwell in the throat of my master Pantagruel. Finally wanted to return, and, passing through his beard, threw myself on his shoulders, and from there I descended into the ground, and fell before him. When he saw me, he asked me: “Where are you coming, Alcofribas? I reply: ""From your throat, sir.""","And no conqueror can more happily reign – be he king, prince or philosopher – than by making justice follow hard upon valour. His valour was manifested in victory and conquest: his justice will be manifested when, with the love and good will of the people, he makes laws, publishes decrees, establishes religious ceremonies and treats each person aright; as the noble poet Virgil says of Octavian Augustus: Victorious, he founded laws, and meant The vanquished to obey them by consent.","There I began to think, that it is very true which is commonly said, that the one half of the world knoweth not how the other half liveth; seeing none before my self had ever written of that Countrey, wherein are above five and twenty Kingdoms inhabited, besides deserts, and a great arme of the sea: concerning which purpose, I have composed a great book intituled The History of the Throttias, because they dwell in the throat of my Master Pantagruel. At last I was willing to return, and passing by his beard, I cast my self upon his shoulders, and from thence slid down to the ground, and fell before him: assoon as I was perceived by him, he asked me, Whence comest thou, Alcofribas? I answered him, Out of your mouth, my Lord: and how long hast thou been there?"

40. Comment Pantagruel descendit en l’île des Papimanes,40. How Pantagruel descended into the Isle of the Papimanes,"CHAPTER 48 [This and the following six chapters constitute the high point of Royalist-Gallican propaganda, especially enjoyed no doubt by Cardinal Odet de Châtillon and Cardinal Jean Du Bellay. The Papimanes make an idol of the Pope, who for them is a god who rivals the true God. (The Fourth Book is concerned with the worship of false gods.) There were indeed papalist lawyers who did assert that the powers of the Pope were such that he was quasi deus in terris, ‘as though God on earth’. Anti-papalists seized on that formula to ‘prove’ that papists are truly idolatrous. The false god of the Papimanes is supported by false Scriptures: the Decretals, many of the most pro-papalist of which were already known to be forgeries. False Decretals were seen as the buttress of papal power. As such they were rejected by reformers and many others. Decretals are known by the name of their collection, such as the Extravagantes. Decrees are by contrast the concern of Councils. God declares ‘I am that I am’ (in Latin and French, ‘I am he who is’) in Exodus 3:14. The insistence on the demonstrable masculinity of the popes is connected with the legend of Pope Joan. Many were convinced that, since the election of a woman as Pope Joan, all newly elected popes were required to sit upon a special seat so contrived as to allow their testicles to be felt from below. ‘Hypophète’ is explained in the Brief Declaration as one who tells of the past as distinct from a prophet who tells of the future.]",CHAPTER XLVIII How Pantagruel went ashoar at the Island of Papimany.

On seeing us bearing (as I said) our Bacchic staffs and crowned with ivy – recognizing also our famous Lantern – he let us safely in and commanded that we be brought at once before Princess Bacbuc, the Lady of Honour of La Bouteille and the Head Priestess of the Mysteries.

Then did the Monk with his staffe of the Crosse, give him such a sturdie thump and whirret betwixt his neck and shoulders, upon the Acromion bone, that he made him lose both sense and motion, and fall down stone dead at his horses feet; and, seeing the signe of the starre which he wore scarfwayes, he said unto Gargantua, these men are but Priests, which is but the beginning of a Monk; by St. Ihon"

How Pantagruel, in the city of Medamothi, bought many beautiful things","CHAPTER 2 [After the first sentence, which is in the ‘48 text, all the rest is added in ‘52 up to the beginning of Chapter 5. Medamothi (‘Nowhere’ in Greek) is perhaps a fleeting glance towards another ‘Nowhere’, More’s Utopia. All is Classical: the king’s name, Philophanes, may mean ‘fond of appearances’ or ‘manifestations’ or ‘revelations’. (The Brief Declaration makes it mean ‘fond of seeing’ or of ‘being seen’, which seems weak.) ‘Philotheamon’ does mean ‘fond of seeing’. The land of Engys is the land of Near-by. Behind the comic notion of the heroes’ buying portraits of the Ideas of Plato and the atoms of Epicurus lies a hint of the importance that the Ideas’ are to play in this Fourth Book. The word Idea (normally with a capital I) appears in both comic and serious contexts and is always worth notice when it appears. The dread tale of Procne and Tereus is told by Ovid, Metamorphoses, 6, 412ff. The ‘tarand’ of Antiquity was perhaps a kind of reindeer.

So the lion, cured, was walking through the forest, at what time an old stubborn woman was chipping away[11], and gathering wood by the said forest, which, seeing the lion coming, fell backwards in fear in such a way that the wind knocked down dress, coat and shirt over her shoulders. Seeing this, the lion ran up in pity to see if she had done herself any harm and, considering her comment a name, said: “O poor woman, who has hurt you thus? and so saying, saw a fox which he called, saying: ""Comrade fox, hau, cza, cza, and for good reason."" »","blessed is he who is not scandalized and who ever aims at the target, the mark, which God has set before us through his dear Child, without being distracted or diverted by his carnal affections.’ The Monk said: ‘What do you think to be intended by this enigma?

You may take a little Supper, but thereat must you not eat of a Hare, nor of any other Flesh: You are likewise to abstain from Beans, from the Preak, (by some called the Polyp) as also from Coleworts, Cabbidge, and all other such like windy Victuals, which may endanger the troubling of your Brains, and the dimming or casting a kind of Mist over your Animal Spirits: For as a Looking-glass cannot exhibit the Semblance or Representation of the Object set before it, and exposed, to have its Image to the life expressed, if that the polish’d sleekedness thereof be darken’d by gross Breathings, dampish Vapours, and foggy, thick, infectious Exhalations; even so the Fancy cannot well receive the impression of the likeness of those things, which Divination doth afford by Dreams, if any way the Body be annoyed or troubled with the fumish Steam of Meat, which it had taken in a while before; because betwixt these two there still hath been a mutual Sympathy and Fellow-feeling, of an indissolubly knit Affection."

Mais je fis le signe de la croix, criant : Agios, athanatos, o theos ! et nul ne venait. Ce que connaissant mon vilain bacha se voulait tuer de ma broche, et s’en percer le cœur. De fait, la mit contre sa poitrine, mais elle ne pouvait outrepasser[21], car elle n’était assez pointue, et poussait tant qu’il pouvait, mais il ne profitait rien. Alors je vins à lui, disant :","“Seeing what, I was afraid for more than five sols, fearing: The devils will come at this hour to carry this madman here; would they be good people to take me away too? I am already half-roasted; my bacon will be the cause of my illness, because these devils here are fond of bacon, as you have the authority of the philosopher Jambilique and Murmault in the apology of Bossutis and Contrefactis pro magistos nostros. But I made the sign of the cross, crying: Agios, athanatos, o theos! and no one came. What knowing my naughty basha wanted to kill with my spit, and pierce his heart with it. In fact, put it against his chest, but it could not go beyond [21], because it was not sharp enough, and pushed as much as he could, but he profited nothing. So I came to him, saying:","yes, the one that’s near – Then various kinds of men shall make an entry, Tired of peace and bored of leisured plenty, They’ll openly proceed, in day’s full light Good folk of every quality to incite To discord and to quarrelling. Indeed, Listen and believe them, then they do succeed!","My Baashaw then seeing the case to be desperate, his house burnt without remission, and all his goods lost, gave himselfe over unto all the devils in hell, calling upon some of them by their names, Gringoth, Astaroth, Rappalus, and Gribouillis, nine several times, which when I saw, I had above six pence worth of feare, dreading that the devils would come even then to carry away this foole, and seeing me so near him would perhaps snatch me up too: I am already (thought I) halfe rosted, and my lardons, will be the cause of my mischief; for these devils are very lickorous of lardons, according to the authority which you have of the Philosopher Jamblicus, and Murmault, in the Apology of Bossutis, adulterated pro magistros nostros: but for my better security I made the signe of the Crosse; crying Hagios, athanatos, ho theos, and none came: at which my rogue Baashaw being very much aggrieved, would in transpiercing his heart with my spit have killed himself; and to that purpose had set it against his breast, but it could not enter, because it was not sharp enough ; whereupon I perceiving that he was not like to work upon his body the effect which he intended, although he did not spare all the force he had to thrust it forward, came up to him and said, Master Bugrino, thou dost here"

"– En bonne heure soit, dit Pantagruel, vous m’en avez bien réjoui. Vraiment, je n’en voudrais pas tenir un fer chaud. Mais ce n’est la guise des amoureux ainsi avoir bragues avalades[6] et laisser pendre sa chemise sur les genoux, sans haut-de-chausses, avec robe longue de bureau, qui est couleur inusitée en robes talares[7], entre gens de bien et de vertu. Si quelques personnages d’hérésies et sectes particulières s’en sont autrefois accoutrés, quoique plusieurs l’aient imputé à piperie, imposture et affectation de tyrannie sur le rude populaire, je ne veux pourtant les blâmer et en cela faire d’eux jugement sinistre. Chacun abonde en son sens, mêmement en choses foraines[8], externes et indifférentes, lesquelles de soi ne sont bonnes ni mauvaises, pour ce qu’elles ne sortent de nos cœurs et pensées, qui est l’officine de tout bien et tout mal : bien, si bonne est et par l’esprit monde[9] réglée l’affection, mal, si, hors équité, par l’esprit malin est l’affection dépravée. Seulement me déplaît la nouveauté et mépris du commun usage.","“Early be it,” said Pantagruel, “you have gladdened me greatly. Really, I wouldn't want to hold a hot iron. But this is not the way lovers like to have their pants down and let their shirt hang over their knees, without breeches, with a long office dress, which is an unusual color in talares dresses[7], between people of goodness and virtue. If some characters of heresies and particular sects have formerly dressed up in it, although many have imputed it to trickery, imposture and affectation of tyranny on the rough people, I do not want to blame them and in that make a sinister judgment of them. . Each abounds in its own meaning, even in fairground[8], external and indifferent things, which in themselves are neither good nor bad, because they do not come out of our hearts and thoughts, which is the pharmacy of all good and all evil: well, if good is and by the spirit world[9] regulated the affection, bad, if, out of equity, by the evil spirit is the depraved affection. Only I dislike the novelty and contempt of the common use.","‘And good luck to you,’ said Pantagruel; ‘you have made me most happy. But truly – though I would not swear to it on a red-hot iron – it is not the style of lovers, is it, to wear their hose dangling down, to let their shirt-tails hang over un-breeched knees and to sport a long cloak of brown bureau-cloth (which, amongst respectable and manly folk is an unusual colour for ankle-length cloaks)? Although some followers of peculiar sects and heresies once went thus accoutred (and despite there being many who attributed that to charlatanism, hypocrisy and a desire to impose upon simple folk) I nevertheless do not wish to condemn them nor to make an adverse judgement on them. ‘Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind, especially over things external, extraneous and indifferent, which are neither good nor evil in themselves since they do not spring from our hearts and thoughts which are the forge of all good and all evil: good, if the emotions are good and governed by the clean Spirit: evil, if the emotions are perverted out of equity by the foul Spirit. I am however displeased by novelty and any contempt for normal customs.’","In good time (quoth Pantagruel) you have told me joyful Tidings; yet would not I hold a red hot Iron in my Hand for all the Gladness of them. But it is not the fashion of Lovers to be accoutred in such dangling Vestments, so as to have their Shirts flagging down over their Knees, without Breeches, and with a long Robe of a dark-brown mingled Hue, which is a Colour never used in Talarian Garments amongst any Persons of Honour, Quality or Vertue. If some Heretical Persons and Schismatical Sectaries have at any time formerly been so arrayed and cloathed (though many have imputed such a kind of Dress to Cosenage, Cheat, Imposture, and an Affectation of Tyranny upon credulous Minds of the rude Multitude) I will nevertheless not blame them for it, nor in that point judge rashly or sinistrously of them; every one overflowingly aboundeth in his own Sense and Fancy: Yea, in Things of a Foreign Consideration, altogether extrinsical and indifferent, which in and of themselves are neither commendable nor bad, because they proceed not from the Interior of the Thoughts and Heart, which is the Shop of all Good and Evil: Of Goodness, if it be upright, and that its Affections be regulated by the pure and clean Spirit of Righteousness; and on the other side, of Wickedness, if its Inclinations, straying beyond the Bounds of Equity be corrupted and depraved by the Malice and Suggestions of the Devil. It is only the novelty and Newfangledness thereof which I dislike, together with the Contempt of common Custom, and the Fashion which is in use."

"Adonc dit Panurge – « J’en suis bien chez Guillot le songeur. J’ai songé tant et plus, mais je n’y entends note, excepté que, par mes songeries, j’avais une femme jeune, galante, belle en perfection, laquelle me traitait et entretenait mignonnement, comme un petit dorelot[1]. Jamais homme ne fut plus aise ni plus joyeux. Elle me flattait, me chatouillait, me tâtonnait, me testonnait[2], me baisait, m’accollait, et par ébattement me faisait deux belles petites cornes au-dessus du front. Je lui remontrais en folliant[3] qu’elle me les devait mettre au-dessous des yeux, pour mieux voir ce que j’en voudrais férir, afin que Momus ne trouvât en elle chose aucune imparfaite et digne de correction, comme il fit en la position des cornes bovines. La folâtre, nonobstant ma remontrance, me les fichait encore plus avant, et en ce ne me faisait mal quelconque, qui est cas admirable. Peu après, me sembla que je fus, ne sais comment, transformé en tambourin, et elle en chouette. Là fut mon sommeil interrompu, et en sursaut me réveillai tout fâché, perplexe et indigné. Voyez là une belle platelée de songes. Faites grand’ chère là-dessus, et l’exposez comme l’entendez. Allons déjeuner, Carpalim.","So says Panurge – “I am well with Guillot the pensive. I thought over and over again, but I don't hear a note of it, except that, through my thoughts, I had a young, gallant, perfectly beautiful wife, who treated me and kept me cute, like a little dorelot [1] . Never was a man more at ease or more joyful. She flattered me, tickled me, groped me, tested me[2], kissed me, hugged me, and by ecstasy made me two beautiful little horns above my forehead. I reminded her madly[3] that she had to put them under my eyes, the better to see what I would like to do with them, so that Momus would not find in her anything imperfect and worthy of correction, as he did. in the position of bovine horns. The frisky one, notwithstanding my remonstrance, shoved them even further on me, and in doing so did me no harm whatever, which is an admirable case. Shortly after, it seemed to me that I was somehow transformed into a tambourine, and she into an owl. There was my interrupted sleep, and with a start I woke up angry, perplexed and indignant. See there a beautiful platter of dreams. Go big on it, and expose it as you see fit. Let's have lunch, Carpalim.","At which Panurge said, ‘I’m at Guillot the Dreamer’s, all bemused: I’ve had more than enough dreams but I can’t make anything out of them, except that in my dream I had a wife who was young, elegant and utterly beautiful, who treated me with affection and caressed me as her own little darling. Never was man more carefree nor happier. She stroked me, tickled me, patted my hair, kissed me, put her arms round my neck and playfully placed two pretty little horns high up on my forehead. I fooled about and expostulated that she ought to have placed them below my eyes, so that I could more easily see where I should strike with them, and also so that Momus should find no imperfection in her (as he did in Nature’s positioning of horns on bulls). But, despite my expostulations that dear little idiot thrust them further in. It didn’t hurt me one bit, which is quite remarkable. ‘Soon after that it seemed to me that I was somehow metamorphosed into a little tabor and she into a little owl. At that point my sleep was shattered and I awoke with a start, all troubled, perplexed and angry. There’s a good plateful of dreams for you. Make a good meal of them and expound them as you understand them. Let’s go have breakfast, Carpalim.’","Then, said Panurge, I have been plunged into my dumps so deeply, as if I had been lodged with Gaffer Noddycap: dreamed indeed I have, and that right lustily; but I could take along with me no more thereof, that I did goodly understand, save only, that I in my Vision had a pretty, fair, young, gallant, handsome Woman, who no less lovingly and kindly treated and entertained me, hugg’d, cherish’d, cocker’d, dandled, and made much of me, as if I had been another neat dillidarling Minion, like Adonis: never was Man more glad than I was then, my Joy at that time was incomparable; she flattered me, tickled me, stroaked me, groped me, frizled me, curled me, kissed me, embraced me, laid her Hands about my Neck, and now and then made jestingly, pretty little Horns above my Forehead: I told her in the like disport, as I did play the Fool with her, that she should rather place and fix them in a little below mine Eyes, that I might see the better what I should stick at, with them: for being so situated, Momus then would find no fault therewith, as he did once with the position of the Horns of Bulls. The wanton, toying Girl, notwithstanding any remonstrance of mine to the contrary, did always drive and thrust them further in: yet thereby (which to me seemed wonderful) she did not do me any hurt at all. A little after, though I know not how, I thought I was transformed into a Tabor, and she into a Chough. My sleeping there being interrupted, I awaked in a start, angry, displeased, perplexed, chafing, and very wroth. There have you a large Platter-ful of Dreams, make thereupon good Chear, and, if you please, spare not to interpret them according to the Understanding which you may have in them. Come Carpalin, let us to Breakfast."

"Ce que leur vint à profit incroyable, car sans naufrage, sans danger, sans perte de leurs gens, en grande sérénité (excepté un jour près l’île des Macréons) firent le voyage d’Indie supérieure en moins de quatre mois, lequel à peine feraient les Portugalais en trois ans, avec mille fâcheries et dangers innombrables. Et suis en cette opinion, sauf meilleur jugement, que telle route de fortune fut suivie par ces Indiens qui naviguèrent en Germanie et furent honorablement traités par le roi des Suèdes, on[35] temps que Q. Metellus Celer était proconsul en Gaule, comme décrivent Cor. Nepos, Pomp. Mêla et Pline après eux.","Which came to them with incredible profit, for without shipwreck, without danger, without loss of their people, in great serenity (except one day near the island of the Macreons) made the voyage to Upper India in less than four months, which at hardly would the Portuguese do in three years, with a thousand annoyances and innumerable dangers. And am in this opinion, except better judgement, that such a route of fortune was followed by these Indians who sailed into Germania and were honorably treated by the king of Sweden, one [35] time that Q. Metellus Celer was proconsul in Gaul, as describe Cor. Nepos, Pom. Mela and Pliny after them.","That proved incredibly advantageous to them, for without shipwreck, without danger, without the loss of a single man and in great serenity, [except for one day near the Isle of the Macraeons,] they made in less than four months the journey to Upper India which the Portuguese could hardly have completed in three years after a thousand hardships and dangers without number. And I am persuaded, saving better judgement, that such a route was accidentally fallen upon by those Indians who sailed to Germany and were honourably treated by the king of the Swabians when Quintus Metellus Celer was pro-consul in Gaul, as described by Cornelius Nepos [and Pomponius Mela] followed by Pliny.10 How Pantagruel purchased several objects in the Isle of Medamothi","This prov’d a much shorter Cut; for without Shipwreck, Danger, or loss of Men, with uninterrupted good Weather, except one day near the Island of the Macreons, they perform’d in less than four Months the Voyage of Upper India, which the Portuguese, with a thousand Inconveniencies and innumerable Dangers, can hardly compleat in three Years. And it is my Opinion, with Submission to better Judgments, that this Course was perhaps steer’d by those Indians who Sail’d to Germany, and were honourably received by the King of the Swedes, while Quintus Metellus Celer was Proconsul of the Gauls, as Corn.

"– À Paris, dit Carpalim, Groignet, couturier avait emploité unes vieilles clémentines en patrons et mesures. O cas étranges ! Tous habillements taillés sur tels patrons et protraits[15] sur telles mesures furent gâtés et perdus : robes, capes, manteaux, sayons, jupes, casaquins, collets, pourpoints, cottes, gonnelles[16], verdugales[17]. Groignet, cuidant[18] tailler une cape, taillait la forme d’une braguette. En lieu d’un sayon, taillait un chapeau à prunes sucées. Sur la forme d’un casaquin, taillait une aumusse. Sur le patron d’un pourpoint, taillait la guise d’une poêle. Ses valets[19] l’avoir cousue, la déchiquetaient par le fond, et semblait d’une poêle à fricasser les châtaignes. Pour un collet faisait un brodequin. Sur le patron d’une verdugale taillait une barbute[20]. Pensant faire un manteau, faisait un tambourin de Suisse. Tellement que le pauvre homme par justice fut condamné à payer les étoffes de tous ses chalands, et de présent en est au safran[21].","“In Paris,” said Carpalim, “Groignet, a dressmaker, had used old clementines for patterns and measurements. O strange cases! All garments cut on such patterns and protraits[15] on such measurements were spoiled and lost: dresses, capes, coats, sayons, skirts, casaquins, collars, doublets, coats, gonnelles[16], verdugales[17]. Groignet, cuidant [18] to cut a cape, cut the shape of a fly. Instead of a sayon, cut a hat with sucked plums. On the form of a casaquin, carved an aumusse. On the pattern of a doublet, cut the shape of a frying pan. His valets[19] having sewn it up, tore it to pieces at the bottom, and looked like a frying pan for frying chestnuts. For a collar made a boot. On the pattern of a verdugale cut a barbute[20]. Thinking of making a coat, made a Swiss tambourine. So much so that the poor man by justice was condemned to pay for the fabrics of all his barges, and now is saffron[21].","‘In Paris,’ said Carpalim, Groignet the tailor cut up some old Clementines to cut out patterns and measures. O! strange event! All the materials cut to those patterns and made up from those measurements were ruined and spoiled: robes, capes, mantles, cassocks, skirts, overcoats, neck-bands, waistcoats, tunics, riding-hoods and farthingales. Intending to cut out a cape, Groignet would cut out the form of a codpiece; and instead of a cassock, a hat crinkled like plum-stones; from the design for an overcoat he would cut out an amice: from the pattern of a doublet he would cut out the form of a canopy – a canapé for frying chestnuts is what it looked like once his apprentices had put in the stitches and cut the deep slashes! Instead of a neck-band he would make up a buskin; from the pattern of a farthingale he would cut out a riding-hood; believing that he was making up a mantle, he produced a Switzer’s drum. Things went so far that the wretched man was condemned by law to pay for the cloth of every one of his clients; and now he’s in the yellow.’","At Paris, said Carpalim, Snip Groignet the Taylor had turn’d an old Clementinœ into Patterns and Measures, and all the Clothes that were cut on them were utterly spoil’d and lost; Gowns, Hoods, Cloaks, Cassocks, Jerkins, Jackets, Wastcoats, Capes, Doublets, Petticoats, Corps de Robes, Vardingals, and soforth. Snip thinking to cut a Hood would cut you out a Codpiece; instead of a Cassock he’d make you a high Crown’d Hat; for a Wastcoat he’d shape you out a Rochet; on the Pattern of a Doublet he’d make you a thing like a Frying-pan; then his Journey-men, having stitch’d it up, did jagg it and pink it at the bottom, and so it look’d like a pan to fry Chesnuts ; instead of a Cape he made a Buskin; for a Vardingale he shap’d a Montero-Cap; and thinking to make a Cloak he’d cut out a pair of your big out-stroutting Switzers Breeches with panes like the outside of a Tabor. In so much that Snip was condemn’d to make good the Stuffs to all his Customers; and to this day poor Cabbidge’s hair grows through his Hood, and his Arse through his Pocket-holes."

You also tell us of an Indian archer, one[6] time that Alexander the Great conquered Indie, who so much was milking[7] perishes[8], that from afar he passed his arrows inside a ring, although they were three cubits long and were the iron of them so large and heavy, that he pierced brands[9] of steel, thick shields, sharp breastplates, everything generally that he touched, so firm, resistant hard and valid was, what can you say. You also tell us marvelous of the industry of the ancient French, who were the favorite of all in the Sagittarian art, and who in hunting black and red beasts rubbed the iron of their arrows with hellebore, for that of the venison thus ferried[10], the flesh more tender, delicous, salubrious and delicious was, encircling however and removing the part thus affected all around. ingeniously than the other nations were doing opposite. es Scythians in this dexterity from which formerly an ambassador sent to Darius, king of the Persians, offered him a bird, a frog, a mouse and five arrows without saying a word. Asked what such gifts claimed, and whether he had the duty to say anything, answered no. Of whom Darius was left, quite astonished and stupefied in his understanding, was only one of the seven captains who had slain the Magi, named Gobryes, expounded to him and interpreted, saying: ""By these gifts and offerings the Scythians tacitly say to you: If the Persians like birds do not fly to the sky, or like mice do not hide towards the center of the earth, or do not move [12] deep in ponds and marshes [13] like frogs, all will be to perdition put by the power and sages [14] of the Scythians.","You tell us – and it is written – that Commodus, that scoundrel who was the Emperor of Rome, could aim from afar so dexterously with his bow that he could shoot without grazing them between the fingers of little boys holding up a hand. You also tell us of an Indian archer (from the time when Alexander the Great conquered India) who was so skilled that he made his arrows fly through a ring from afar, doing so despite those arrows being three cubits long, with iron heads so big and heavy that he could cut through steel swords with them as well as through thick shields, steel breastplates and indeed anything at all that he hit, however hard, solid, resistant and tough. You also tell us marvels of the skill of the French of old who were considered the best of all at archery: when they were out hunting the black boar or the red deer they would rub the metal tips of their arrows with hellebore, since the flesh of any animals which were then shot was more tender, tasty, wholesome and delicious; they did, however, cut round and remove the part which had been struck. You tell a similar tale of the Parthians, who shot behind them with greater skill than other peoples do to the fore. You also praise the Scythians for showing the same dexterity; an ambassador was sent from them to Darius, the King of the Persians, to whom without a word he offered a bird, a frog, a mouse and five arrows. He was asked what was implied by such gifts: had he been charged with saying anything? He answered, No. Darius would have remained surprised and puzzled were it not for Gobryes (one of the seven captains who had killed the Magi) who deciphered and explained it to him. ‘ By those gifts and presents,’ he said, ‘the Scythians are tacitly telling you that if the Persians cannot fly in the sky like birds, hide near the centre of the Earth like mice and conceal themselves in the depths of ponds and marshes like frogs, they will all be sent to perdition by the might and shafts of the Scythians.’58","You tell us, and it is recorded that Commodus the Roman Emperour could shoot with a Bow so dextrously that at a good distance he would let fly an Arrow through a Child’s Fingers, and never touch them. You also tell us of an Indian Archer, who liv’d when Alexander the Great conquer’d India, and was so skilful in drawing the Bow, that at a considerable distance he would shoot his Arrows through a Ring, tho’ they were three Cubits long, and their Iron so large and weighty that with them he us’d to pierce steel Cutlasses, thick Shields, steel Breast plates, and generally what he did hit, how firm, resisting, hard and strong soever it were. You also tell us wonders of the Industry of the ancient Francks, who were preferred to all others in point of Archery, and when they hunted either Black or Dun Beasts, us’d to rub the head of their Arrows with Hellebore, because the flesh of the Venison struck with such an Arrow was more tender, dainty, wholesome, and delicious (paring off nevertheless the part that was touch’d round about.) You also talk of the Parthians who us’d to shoot backwards more dextrously than other Nations forwards; and also celebrate the Skill of the Scythians in that Art, who sent once to Darius King of Persia an Embassador that made him a present of a Bird, a Frog, a Mouse and five Arrows, without speaking one word; and being ask’d what those Presents meant, and if he had Commission to say any thing, answer’d that he had not; Which puzzl’d and gravell’d Darius very much; till Gobrias, one of the seven Captains that had kill’d the Magi explain’d it, saying to Darius, By these Gifts and Offerings the Scythians silently tell you, that except the Persians like Birds fly up to Heaven, like Mice hide themselves near the Centre of the Earth, or like Frogs dive to the very bottom of Ponds and Lakes, they shall be destroyed by the Power and Arrows of the Scythians."

"Passants quelque peu avant en ce pays de tapisserie, vîmes la mer Méditerranée ouverte et découverte jusques aux abîmes, tout ainsi comme au goufre Arabique se découvrit la mer Érythrée, pour faire chemin aux Juifs issants[1] d’Égypte. Là je reconnus Triton sonnant de sa grosse conche, Glaucus, Protéus, Néréus, et mille autres dieux et monstres marins. Vîmes aussi nombre infini de poissons en espèces diverses, dansants, volants, voltigeants, combattants, mangeants, respirants, belutants[2], chassants, dressants escarmouches, faisants embuscades, composants trêves, marchandants, jurants, s’ébattants.","Passing a little ahead in this country of tapestry, saw the Mediterranean Sea open and uncovered to the abyss, just as at the Arabian chasm was discovered the Eritrean Sea, to make way for the Jews issants [1] of Egypt. There I recognized Triton sounding his big conche, Glaucus, Proteus, Nereus, and a thousand other gods and sea monsters. I also saw an infinite number of fish of various species, dancing, flying, fluttering, fighting, eating, breathing, beluting[2], hunting, skirmishing, ambushing, composing truces, haggling, swearing, frolicking.","‘Anacampserotes’ are fruit said by Pliny to reconcile lovers. Pierre Gilles (Aegidius) was a friend of Erasmus. In 1533 he published a treatise, On the Latin and French Names of Mediterranean Fishes, which the Cardinal d’Armagnac persuaded him to dedicate to François I. The people standing behind leaves of mint are liars, ‘mint’ in French being menthe, suggesting mentir, to tell lies. The famous mill at Bazacle on the Garonne is mentioned in Chapter 14 of Pantagruel.] Penetrating a little deeper into the land of tapestry we saw the Mediterranean Sea, parted and revealed to its uttermost depths just as the Red Sea in the Arabian Gulf parted to make a way for the Israelites to come out from Egypt. There I recognized Triton sounding his mighty horn, Glaucus, Proteus, Mereus and hundreds of other sea-gods and sea-monsters. We also saw an infinity of fish of various kinds: fish dancing, flying, flitting, fighting, eating, breathing, mating, hunting, skirmishing, laying ambushes, arranging truces, trading, swearing oaths and disporting themselves.","WE went a little higher up into the Country of Tapistry, and saw the Mediterranean Sea open’d to the right and left down to the very bottom, just as the Red-Sea very fairly left its bed at the Arabian Gulph, to make a Lane for the Jews, when they left Egypt. There I found Triton winding his silver Shell instead of a Horn, and also Glaucus, Proteus, Nereus, and a thousand other Godlings and Sea-monsters. I also saw an infinite number of Fish of all kinds, dancing, flying, vaulting, fighting, eating, breathing, billing, shoving, milting, spawning, hunting, fishing, skirmishing, lying in Ambuscado, making Truces, cheapning, bargaining, swearing and sporting."

"Le pilote fit réponse : « Seigneur de rien ne vous effrayez. Ici est le confin de la mer glaciale, sur laquelle fut, au commencement de l’hiver dernier passé, grosse et félonne bataille, entre les Arismapiens et les Néphélibates[2]. Lors gelèrent en l’air les paroles et cris des hommes et femmes, les chaplis[3] des masses, les hurtis[4] des harnois[5], des bardes, les hennissements des chevaux, et tout autre effroi de combat. À cette heure, la rigueur de l’hiver passée, advenant la sérénité et tempérie du bon temps, elles fondent et sont ouïes.","The pilot replied, “Lord, do not be afraid. Here is the confines of the icy sea, on which, at the beginning of last past winter, there was a great and treacherous battle between the Arismapians and the Nephelibates. Then froze in the air the words and cries of men and women, the chaplis[3] of the masses, the hurtis[4] of the armor[5], of the bards, the neighing of the horses, and all other dread of battle. At this time, the rigor of winter passed, in the event of the serenity and temper of the good weather, they melt and are heard.","The pilot replied: ‘My Lord: there is nothing to be afraid of. We are here at the approaches of the Frozen Sea over which there was a huge and cruel combat between the Arismapians and the Nephelibates at the onset of last winter. At that time, the Words and cries of men and the women, the pounding of maces, the clank of the armour of men and horses, the whinnying of steeds and all the remaining din of battle froze in the air. And now that the rigour of winter has passed and fine, calm, temperate weather returned, they melt, and can be heard.’","THE Skipper made answer; Be not afraid, my Lord, we are on the Confines of the Frozen Sea, on which about the beginning of last Winter happen’d a great and bloody Fight between the Arimaspians and the Nephelibates. Then the words and cries of Men and Women, the hacking, slashing, and hewing of Battle-axes, the shocking, knocking, and joulting of Armours, and Harnesses, the neighing of Horses, and all other Martial din and noise, froze in the Air; And now the rigour of the Winter being over by the succeeding serenity and warmth of the Weather, they melt and are heard."

"Considérants en extase ce temple mirifique et lampe mémorable, s’offrit à nous la vénérable pontife Bacbuc avec sa compagnie, à face joyeuse et riante, et, nous voyants accoutrés comme a été dit, sans difficulté nous introduit au lieu moyen[1] du temple, auquel dessous la lampe susdite était la belle fontaine fantastique. Puis nous commanda être hanaps, tasses et gobelets présentés, d’or, d’argent, de cristallin de porcelaine, et fûmes gracieusement invités à boire de la liqueur sourdante d’icelle fontaine : ce que fîmes très volontiers... Car, pour clairement vous avertir, nous ne sommes du calibre d’un tas de veaux qui, comme les passereaux ne mangent sinon qu’on leur tape la queue, pareillement ne boivent ne mangent sinon qu’on les rue[2] à grands coups de levier. Jamais personne n’éconduisons-nous invitant courtoisement à boire.","Considering in ecstasy this marvelous temple and memorable lamp, the venerable pontiff Bacbuc offered himself to us with his company, with a joyful and laughing face, and, seeing us decked out as has been said, without difficulty introduced us to the middle place [1] of the temple, under which the aforesaid lamp was the beautiful fantastic fountain. Then we were ordered to be goblets, cups and goblets presented, of gold, silver, crystalline porcelain, and were graciously invited to drink liquor rising from this fountain: which we did very willingly... Because, for clearly warn you, we are not of the caliber of a heap of calves which, as sparrows do not eat except that their tails are slapped, similarly do not drink or eat except that they are kicked [2] with great blows of the lever . No one ever rejects us courteously inviting us to drink.","For the choice and arrangement of the various texts, including the following chapter, see Mireille Huchon in her Pléiade Rabelais, pp. 1673–4.] While we were in ecstasy, contemplating that wonder-working Temple and that remarkable lamp, the venerable High-Priestess Bacbuc, with a joyful and smiling face, appeared before us with her train. Seeing us attired as we had been instructed, she made no difficulty about bringing us right into the middle of the temple where, below the said lamp, the beautiful, phantastic fountain was to be found. How the waters of the Fountain tasted of whatever wine the drinkers fancied CHAPTER 42 [Many items in this chapter derive eventually from Pliny. Over several details the manuscript gives different readings, some perhaps better ones. For example, where the printed editions refer to ‘Pluto in limbo’, the manuscript speaks of Daedalus, and also adds the Magi (of Classical antiquity) after the Chaldaeans. For Polycletus see an adage of Cognatus (Cousin), ‘The Norm of Polycletus’. The final paragraph picks up a scriptural quotation, last met in Gargantua, Chapter 5 apropos of true faith: ‘For with God nothing is ever impossible’ (cited from Luke 1:37 and echoing Genesis 8). The word ‘portri’ remains unexplained. From the last line on p. 1006 the text forms a separate chapter in the manuscript.] She next commanded us to be offered beakers, chalices and goblets of gold, silver, crystal and porcelain, and we were courteously invited to taste of the spring flowing from that fountain. We were delighted to do so, for, however doleful, it was a phantastic fountain, more costly, rare and miraculous in materials and workmanship than any dreamt up by Pluto in limbo. Its base-work was of the purest, limpidest alabaster, three spans high or a little more, forming on the outside a regular heptagon, complete with stylobates, arulets, wave-shaped mouldings and a surrounding of Doric undulations. At the centre of the space within each angle was sited a fluted pillar in the shape of an ivory or alabaster bobbin such as architects nowadays call portri. There were seven in all, one for each angle. From base to architrave they measured a little under seven spans, which is exactly and precisely the length of a diameter passing through the centre from the inner curve of the circumference. Now those columns were so disposed that when we were looking from behind one of them in order to see the others opposite, we discovered that, regardless of the size of its shaft at that point, the pyramidal cone formed by our line of vision terminated in the said centre where it met the two columns facing it to form an equilateral triangle, two sides of which divided the column (which we wished to measure) into three equal parts, and, touching the outsides of two parallel columns at the division of the third section (which served as their base, their fundamental line, designedly projected towards the overall centre and, divided equally into two) gave, by just division, the distance of the seven columns opposite in a straight line which originates in the obtuse angle at the top. (You realize that in every figure which contains an uneven number of angles, one of its angles is always equidistant from another two.) By that it was shown to us, without words, that seven semi-diameters equal – in geometric proportion, amplitude and distance – slightly less than the circumference of the circular figure from which they were abstracted, that is to say rather more than three whole diameters plus a little more than one-and-a-half eighths, or else a little less than one-and-a-half sevenths, according to the Ancient teachings of Euclid, Aristotle, Archimedes and others.35 The first column – the one which offered itself to our gaze at the entrance to the temple – was of sky-blue sapphire; the second, of hyacinth, naturally reproducing (with the letters A and J in various places) the colour of that flower into which was changed the angry blood of Ajax; the third, of that diamond called anachite, as shimmering and dazzling as lightning; the fourth, of balas ruby, male, and bordering on the amethyst in such a way that its sheen and sparkle eventually seem purple and violet as does the amethyst; the fifth, of emerald, five hundred times more splendid than ever was that of Serapis within the Egyptian labyrinth, and more gleaming and glowing than those once fixed, to serve as eyes, on to the marble lion hard by the tomb of King Hermias; the sixth, of agate, more gaily twinkling in its distinctive streaks and veins than ever was that agate held so dear by Pyrrhus, the King of Epirus; the seventh, of moonstone, as transparent and white as beryl and with the splendour of honey from Mount Hymettus; within it there appeared the moon, in form and motion as she is in the heavens, full, silent, waxing, waning. All those are stones attributed to the seven planets of the heavens by the Chaldaeans of old. To make it all more understandable to grosser understandings: on the first – of sapphire – there was raised above the capital, in a perpendicular line passing through the centre, a statue of Saturn wielding his scythe; it was made of very costly purified lead, with, at its feet, a crane of gold, skilfully enamelled in the colours naturally appropriate to that bird of Saturn’s; on the second – of hyacinth – there was Jupiter cast in the pewter called jovetanum, leftwards looking, with a life-like, enamelled, golden eagle upon his bosom; on the third, was Phoebus in refined gold, holding a white cockerel in his hand; on the fourth, was Mars, in Corinthian marble, with a lion at his feet; on the fifth, was Venus, in copper like that used by Ariston-ides to make the statue of Athamas, expressing in its blushing whiteness the reproach he felt when gazing at his son Learchus lying dead at his feet from a fall; on the sixth, Mercury, in quicksilver, malleable and set solid;36 on the seventh, Luna, in silver, with a greyhound at her feet. Now these statues were a little above one third of the height of the columns beneath them; they were presented with such ingenuity following the projections of the mathematicians that the Canon of Polycletus37 (in the establishing of which Polycletus was said to have instructed art by means of art) would scarcely have been admitted there as a yardstick. The bases of the columns, the capitals, the architraves, the friezes and the cornices were in the Phrygian style, decorated with massive gold, purer and finer than that washed down by the river Lez near Montpellier, the Ganges in India, the Po in Italy, the Hebrus in Thrace, the Tagus in Spain or the Pactolus in Lydia. The small arches spanning the columns were each of the same stone as their columns as far as the next one in order, that is, the sapphire arch leading to hyacinth; the hyacinth, to the diamond, and so on in order. Above the arches and the capitals of the columns, on the inside, a cupola had been constructed to cover the fountain; it began as a hexagon behind the sites of the planets and gradually developed and ended in a sphere; it was of crystal so refined, so diaphanous and so perfectly and evenly polished all over (without veins, cloudy patches, streaks or stripes) that never did Xenocrates see anything to compare with it. Within its vaulting there were artistically engraved, in order, with exquisite figures and symbols: the twelve signs of the Zodiac, the twelve months of the year with their attributes; the two solstices, the two equinoxes, the ecliptic together with some of the more noteworthy fixed stars around the Antarctic Pole and elsewhere: all done so artistically that I thought it was the work of King Necepsus or of Petosiris, the ancient mathematician. At the uppermost point of the cupola, exactly over the middle of the fountain, there were three rare, smooth, pear-shaped pearls, each fashioned into the exact form of a tear-drop. They were joined so as to form a fleur-de-lys which was bigger with its setting than the palm of your hand. From its calyx there emerged a carbuncle as big as an ostrich-egg, cut to form a heptagon, seven being a number much loved by Nature. It was so stupendous and wonderful that we all but lost our sight when we raised our eyes to contemplate it, for neither lightning nor the flaming sun are more coruscating or more brilliant than it then seemed to us. So much so that good judges would readily conclude that there would be more riches and wonders in the fountain and the lamps described than are contained in Asia, Africa and Europe combined. It would have darkened the pantarbe38 of Iarchas, a magician of India, as easily as the clear sun darkens the stars at noon. Now let Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt, boast about the twin pearls dangling from her ears, one of which, valued at ten million sesterces, she dissolved into liquid by the virtue of vinegar in the presence of Anthony the Triumvir. Let Pompeia Platulina go strutting about in her dress, completely covered in alternate rows of pearls and emeralds, which drew the admiration of all the people in the City of Rome (which was styled the ditch and trading-post of the champion thieves of the entire world). The outflowing water gushed from that fountain through three pipes and channels made of fine pearls and sited at the apexes of three equilateral angles at the tip of the fountain as described above. Those channels projected in the shape of a double helix. We had contemplated them and were turning our gaze elsewhere when Bacbuc commanded us to listen to the waters pouring out. Whereupon we heard a sound wondrously harmonious yet deadened and fractured as though coming from underground and from afar; it seemed all the more delectable for that, more than if it had been heard easily and close at hand, so that, just as our minds had been delighted by our contemplating what has been described above through the windows of our eyes, the same delight awaited our ears upon hearing that harmony. Wherefore Bacbuc said to us: ‘Those philosophers of yours deny that motion is produced by the power of forms. Hearken now and behold the contrary: it is entirely via the form of that twin spiral which you can see, together with that five-fold fleuron which vibrates with each internal impulse – as in the case of the vena cava where it enters the right ventricle of the heart – that the waters of this holy fountain filter out, producing a harmony such that it rises to the surface of the sea in your world.’ She then commanded a drink to be served to us. Now to tell you plainly, we are not of the calibre of a bunch of calves which, like sparrows, will only feed if you tap their tails and similarly, never eat nor drink unless you lambast them with a crow-bar. We never decline when anyone courteously invites us to drink.","WHILE we were admiring this incomparable Lamp, and the stupendous Structure of the Temple, the Venerable Priestess Bacbuc, and her Attendants came to us with jolly, smiling Looks; and seeing us duly accoutred, without the least difficulty, took us into the middle of the Temple, where just under the aforesaid Lamp was the fine Fantastic Fountain. CHAPTER XLIII How the Fountain-water had the Taste of Wine, according to the imagination of those who drank of it. SHE then order’d some Cups, Goblets, and Talboys of Gold, Silver, and Christal to be brought, and kindly invited us to drink of the Liquor that sprung there, which we readily did; for to say the truth, this Fantastick Fountain was very inviting, and its Materials and Workmanship more precious, rare, and admirable than any thing Pluto ever dreamt of in Limbo. Its Basis or Ground-Work was of most pure and limpid Aleblaster, and its height somewhat more than three Spans; being a regular Heptagone on the outside, with its Stylobates or Footsteps, Arulets, Simasults or Blunt Tops, and Doric Undulations about it. It was exactly round within. On the middle Point of each Angle and Brink stood a Pillar orbiculated, in form of Ivory or Alabaster Solid Rings. Each Pillar’s length from the Basis to the Architraves, was near seven Hands, taking an exact Demension of its Diameter through the Centre of its Circumference and inward Roundness; and it was so dispos’d, that casting our Eyes behind one of them, whatever its Cube might be, to view its Opposite, we found that the Pyramidal Cone of our Visual Line ended at the said Centre, and there, by the two Opposites, form’d an Equilateral Triangle, whose two Lines divided the Pillar into two equal parts. That which we had a mind to measure, going from one side to another, two Pillars over, at the first third part of the distance between them, was met by their lowermost and fundamental Line, which in a Consult Line drawn as far as the Universal Centre, equally divided; gave in a just Partition the distance of the Seven opposite Pillars in a right Line; beginning at the Obtuse Angle on the Brink; as you know that an Angle is always found plac’d between two others in all Angular Figures odd in number. This tacitly gave us to understand that seven Semidiamiaters are in Geometrical Proportion, Compass and Distance, somewhat less than the Circumference of a Circle, from the Figure of which they are extracted, that is to say, three whole Parts with an eighth and a half, a little more; or a seventh and a half, a little less, according to the Instructions given us of old by Euclid, Aristotle, Archimedes, and others. The first Pillar, I mean that which fac’d the Temple-Gate, was of Azure, Sky-colour’d Saphir. The second of Hiacinth, a precious Stone, exactly of the Colour of the Flower, into which Ajax’s Cholerick Blood was transform’d; the Greek letters, AI, being seen on it in many places. The third, an Anachite Diamond, as bright and glittering as Lightning. The fourth a Masculin Ruby Ballais [Peach-colour’d] amatistising, its Flame and Lustre ending in Violet or Purple, like an Amatist. The fifth an Emerald, above five hundred and fifty times more precious than that of Serapis in the Labyrinth of the Egyptians, and more verdant and shining than those that were fix’d instead of Eyes in the Marble Lyon’s Head, near King Hermias’s Tomb. The sixth of Agath, more admirable and various in the Distinctions of its Veins, Clouds, and Colours, than that which Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, so mightily esteem’d. The seventh of Sienites, transparent, of the Colour of a Beril, and the clear Hue of Hymetian Honey, and within it the Moon was seen, such as we see it in the Sky, Silent, Full, New, and in the Wain. These Stones were assign’d to the Seven heavenly Planets by the ancient Chaldeans; and that the meanest Capacities might be inform’d of this, just at the Central Perpendicular Line, on the Chapter of the first Pillar, which was of Saphir, stood the Image of Saturn in Eliacim Lead, with his Scythe in his Hand, and at his Feet, a Crane of Gold, very artfully enemall’d according to the Native Hue of the Saturnine Bird. On the second, which was of a Hiacinth, towards the left, Jupiter was seen in Jovetian Brass, and on his Breast an Eagle of Gold, enemall’d to the Life. On the third was Phœbus of the purest Gold, and a white Cock in his Right-Hand. On the fourth, was Mars in Corinthian-Brass, and a Lyon at his Feet. On the fifth was Venus in Copper, the Metal of which Aristonides made Athamas Statue that express’d in a blushing whiteness his Confusion at the sight of his Son Learchus, who died at his Feet of a Fall. On the sixth, was Mercury in Hydrargyre, I would have said Quicksilver, had it not been fixed, malleable, and unmovable: That nimble Deity had a Stork at his Feet. On the seventh, was the Moon in Silver, with a Greyhound at her Feet. The size of these Statues was somewhat more than a third part of the Pillars on which they stood, and they were so admirably wrought according to Mathematical proportion, that Polycletus’s Cannon could hardly have stood in competition with them. The Bases of the Pillars, the Chapters, the Architraves, Zoophores and Cornishes, were Phrygian Work of Massive Gold, purer and finer than any that is found in the Rivers Leéde near Montpellier, Ganges in India, Pô in Italy, Hebrus in Thrace, Tagus in Spain, and Pactolus in Lydia. The small Arches between the Pillars were of the same precious stone of which the Pillars next to them were. Thus that Arch was of Saphir which ended at the Hiacynth Pillar, and that was of Hiacynth which went towards the Diamond, and so on. Above the Arches and Chapters of the Pillars on the inward Front a Cúpola was raised to cover the Fountain; it was surrounded by the Planetary Statues, Heptagonal at the bottom, and Spherical o’ top; and of Cristal so pure, transparent, well polished, whole, and uniform in all its parts, without Veins, Clouds, Flaws or Streaks , that Xenocrates never saw such a one in his life. Within it were seen the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, the Twelve Months of the Year, with their Proprieties, the Two Equinoxes, the Ecliptic Line, with some of the most Remarkable fixed Stars about the Antartic Pole and elsewhere, so curiously engraven, that I fancied them to be the Workmanship of King Necepsus or Petosiris the Ancient Mathematician. On the top of the Cúpola, just over the Centre of the Fountain, were three noble long Pearls all of one size, Pear-fashion, perfectly imitating a Tear, and so joined together as to represent a Flower-de-Luce or Lilly, each of the Flowers seeming above a Hand’s-breath. A Carbuncle jetted out of its Calix or Cup, as big as an Ostridge’s Egg, cut seven square (that Number so belov’d of Nature) and so prodigiously glorious, that the sight of it had like to have made us blind; for the fiery Sun, or the pointed Lightning are not more dazling and unsufferably bright. Now were some Judicious Appraisers to judge of the Value of this incomparable Fountain, and the Lamp of which we spoke, they would undoubtedly affirm, it exceeds that of all the Treasures and Curiosities in Europe, Asia and Africa put together. For that Carbuncle alone would have darken’d the Pantharb of Joachas the Indian Magician, with as much ease as the Sun outshines and dims the Stars with his Meridian Rays. Now let Cleopatra that Egyptian Quean boast of her Pair of Pendants, those two Pearls, one of which she caused to be dissolv’d in Vinegar, in the presence of Anthony the Triumvir, her Gallant. Or let Pompeia Plautina be proud of her Dress cover’d all over with Emeralds and Pearls curiously intermix’d, that attracted the Eyes of all Rome, and was said to be the Pit and Magazine of the Conquering Robbers of the Universe. The Fountain had three Tubes or Channels of right Pearl, seated in three Equilateral Angles already mention’d, extended on the Margent; and those Channels proceeded in a Snail-like Line winding equally on both sides. We look’d on them a-while, and had cast our Eyes on another side, when Bacbuc directed us to watch the Water: We then heard a most harmonious sound, yet somewhat stopt by starts, far distant, and Subterranean, by which means it was still more pleasing than if it had been free, uninterrupted, and near us; so that our Minds were as agreeably entertain’d through our Ears with that charming melody, as they were through the Windows of our Eyes, with those Delightful Objects. Bacbuc then said, Your Philosophers will not allow, that Motion is begot by the power of Figures; Look here, and see the contrary. By that single Snail-like motion, equally divided as you see, and a five-fold infoliature, moveable at every inward meeting, such as is the Vena cava where it enters into the right Ventricle of the Heart; just so is the Flowing of this Fountain, and by it an harmony ascends as high as your World’s Ocean. She then ordered her Attendants to make us drink: And to tell you the truth of the matter as near as possible, we are not, Heav’n be prais’d! of the nature of a Drove of Calf-lollies, who (as your Sparrows can’t feed unless you bob ’em on the Tail) must be Rib-roasted with tough Crabtree, and firk’d into a stomach, or at least into an humour to eat or drink; No, we know better things, and scorn to scorn any man’s Civility who civilly invites us to a Drinking Bout."
"Laissants l’île désolée des Papefigues, navigâmes par un jour en sérénité et tout plaisir, quand à notre vue s’offrit la benoîte île des Papimanes. Soudain que nos ancres furent au port jetées, avant que nous eussions encoché[1] nos gumènes[2], vinrent vers nous en un esquif quatre personnes diversement vêtues. L’un en moine enfroqué, crotté, botté. L’autre en fauconnier avec un leurre et gant d’oiseau. L’autre en solliciteur de procès, ayant un grand sac plein d’informations, citations, chicaneries et ajournements en main. L’autre en vigneron d’Orléans avec belles guêtres de toile, une panouère[3] et une serpe à la ceinture. Incontinent qu’ils furent joints à notre nef, s’écrièrent à haute voix tous ensemble demandant : « L’avez-vous vu, gens passagers ? l’avez-vous vu ?","Leaving the desolate island of Papefigues, we sailed one day in serenity and full pleasure, when in our view the benoîte island of Papimanes presented itself. Suddenly, when our anchors were dropped in port, before we had notched [1] our gumènes [2], four persons variously dressed came towards us in a skiff. One as a dressed-up, muddy, booted monk. The other as a falconer with a decoy and bird glove. The other as a trial solicitor, having a big bag full of information, subpoenas, quibbles and adjournments in hand. The other as a winegrower from Orléans with beautiful canvas gaiters, a panouère[3] and a sickle at the belt. Immediately they were joined to our ship, all together cried aloud, asking: “Did you see him, fellow passengers? have you seen it ?","Leaving behind the ravaged island of the Papefigues, we had most happily sailed for a day of calm weather when the blessèd isle of the Papimanes hove in sight. As soon as our anchors were dropped in the harbour and before we had made fast our cables, there came towards us a skiff with four persons each differently dressed. One was a monk, frocked, filthy and finely booted. Another, a falconer with a lure and a hawking-glove. Another, a solicitor holding a great bundle of examinations, summonses, chicaneries and postponements. The other was a vigneron from Orleans in handsome cloth gaiters, with a punnet and a sickle attached to his belt. The instant they drew alongside, they called out, asking us in a loud voice: ‘Have you seen Him, O travellers? Have you seen Him?’","HAVING left the desolate Island of the Popefigs, we sailed for the space of a day very fairly and merrily, and made the blessed Island of Papimany. As soon as we had dropt Anchor in the Road, before we had well-moor’d our Ship with ground Tackle, four Persons in different Garbs row’d towards us in a Skiff. One of them was dress’d like a Monk in his Frock, draggle-tail’d and Booted: the other like a Falkoner with a Lure and a long-wing’d Hawk on his Fist: the third like a Sollicitor, with a large Bag, full of Informations, Subpœna’s, Breviates, Bills, Writs, Cases, and other Implements of Pettifogging. The fourth look’d like one of your Vine Barbers about Orleans, with a jantee pair of Canvass Trowzers, a Dosser and a Pruning Knife at his Girdle. As soon as the Boat had clap’d them on Board, they all with one Voice ask’d, Have you seen him, good Passengers, have you seen him?"
"– En doutez-vous ? dit Gagnebeaucoup ? Il n’est mois qu’ils n’en aient. Ce n’est pas comme en vos pays, où le serment[24] ne vous vaut rien qu’une fois l’année. »","– Do you doubt it? says Win a lot? They haven't had any for months. It is not like in your countries, where the oath[24] is worth nothing to you only once a year. »","He then said to Pantagruel that beds were much cheaper here than in the Chinonais, despite our having the celebrated Pautille geese, since that old woman had merely asked five dozen pence for a bed which in the Chinonais would fetch a dozen francs at least.12",Fry.

"Il ne voulait point mourir les couilles pleines. Et suis d’avis que dorénavant, en tout mon Salmigondinois, quand on voudra par justice exécuter quelque malfaiteur, un jour ou deux devant on le fasse brisgoutter en onocrotale[8], si bien qu’en tous ses vases spermatiques ne reste de quoi protraire[9] un Y grégeois. Chose si précieuse ne doit être follement perdue. Par aventure engendrera-t-il un homme. Ainsi mourra il sans regret, laissant homme pour homme. »","He didn't want to die with his balls full. And I am of the opinion that from now on, in all my Salmigondinois, when we want to execute some criminal for justice, a day or two before we make him splinter in onocrotal [8], so that in all his spermatic vases nothing remains of what protraire[9] a Greek Y. Something so precious must not be foolishly lost. By chance will he beget a man. Thus he will die without regret, leaving man for man. »","He did not want to die with his bollocks full. ‘And my counsel is that from henceforth, in all my lands of Salmagundi, whenever it is decided by the courts to hang a malefactor, he will be made to pound away like a pelican for a day or two beforehand, so well that there will not be left enough in his seminal tools to write a Greek letter Y. So precious a substance must not be stupidly lost. He might possibly engender a man-child. And then he would die without regret, leaving a man for a man.’ [How Frère Jean merrily advises Panurge] CHAPTER 27 [There is no chapter-break here in the first edition, yet the following chapter was already numbered 28. The interpolation of this chapter-break in 1552 therefore entailed no renumbering of the chapters which follow. ‘Privileges are lost by non-usage’ was a legal maxim. There was a French saying: ‘Those girls are like bells: you can make them say anything you want.’ There had never been a Marchioness of Winchester. Perhaps there is a confused allusion to the many brothels in the London domains of the Bishop of Winchester, whose inmates were known as ‘Winchester Geese’. Solomon, a sexually experienced man if ever there was one, classed the ‘mouth of the womb’ amongst the three things which cannot be satisfied (Proverbs 30:15–16).","He was loath, it seems, to die with his Cods overgorged: He was to be commended, therefore do I promise, that from henceforth no Malefactor shall by Justice be executed within my Jurisdiction of Salmigondinois, who shall not, for a day or two at least before, be permitted to culbut, and foraminate, Onocrotal-wise, that there remain not in all his vessels, to write a great Greek Г; such a precious thing should not be foolishly cast away; he will perhaps therewith beget a Male, and so depart the more contentedly out of this Life, that he shall have left behind him one for one."

"De fait, une heure après, se leva le vent nommé nord-nord-ouest, auquel ils donnèrent pleines voiles, et prirent la haute mer, et en brefs jours, passants par Porto Santo et par Madère, firent escale ès îles de Canarre.

From there, they passed by Cap Blanco, by Senege, by Cap Virido, by Gambre, by Sagres, by Melli, by the Cape of Bona Speranza[14], and made a stopover in the kingdom of Mélinde. From there, they sailed to the wind of the transmontana[15], passing through Meden[16], Uti, Uden, Gelasim, the Fairy Islands and adjoins the kingdom of Achoria[17]; finally arrived at the port of Utopia, distant from the city of the Amaurotes by three leagues and somewhat more.","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","which interpretation Pantagruel presently understood, and withal remembering, that at his departure he had not bid the Lady farewel, he was very sorry, and would faine have returned to Paris, to make his peace with her; but Epistemon put him in minde of Æneas’s departure from Dido, and the saying of Heraclitus of Tarentum, That the ship being at anchor when need requireth, we must cut the cable rather then lose time about untying of it, and that he should lay aside all other thoughts, to succour the City of his Nativity, which was then in danger; and indeed within an houre after that, the winde arose at the north-north-west, wherewith they hoised saile, and put out, even into the maine sea, so that within few dayes, passing by Porto Sancto, and by the Maderas, they went ashore in the Canarie islands ; parting from thence, they passed by Capobianco, by Senege, by Capoverde, by Gambre, by Sagres, by Melli, by the Cap di buona Speranza, and set ashore againe in the Kingdom of Melinda; parting from thence, they sailed away with a tramontan or northerly winde, passing by Meden, by Uti, by Uden, by Gelasim, by the isles of the Fairies, and alongst the Kingdom of Achorie, till at last they arrived at the port of Utopia, distant from the city of the Amaurots three leagues and somewhat more."

Les dangers se refuient[5] de moi, quelque part que je sois, sept lieues à la ronde, comme advenant le prince cesse le magistrat, advenant le soleil évanouissent les ténèbres, et comme les maladies fuyaient à la venue du corps saint Martin à Cande.","– What dangers? said Panurge, interrupting the conversation. Dangers flee [5] from me, wherever I am, seven leagues around, as in the event the prince ceases the magistrate, in the event the sun vanishes the darkness, and as the diseases fled at the coming of the body of Saint Martin to Candy.","‘What dangers?’ said Panurge, cutting him across. ‘Dangers flee seven leagues from me wherever I am, just as the arrival of the king supersedes the magistrate, the arrival of the sun banishes the darkness, and the arrival of the relics of Saint-Martin at Candes causes maladies to flee.’","What Dangers (quoth Panurge, interrupting him)? Dangers fly back, run from, and shun me whither soever I go seven Leagues around: As in the Presence of the Soveraign a subordinate Magistracy is eclipsed; or as Clouds and Darkness quite evanish at the bright coming of a Radiant Sun; or as all Sores and Sicknesses did suddenly depart, at the approach of the Body of St. Martin Aquande:"
"– C’est assez, dit Pantagruel. Sus, enfans, êtes-vous délibérés[9] d’y venir avec moi ? »","“That is enough,” said Pantagruel. Know, children, are you deliberate [9] to come there with me? »","you are quite aware that the men of Utopia had genitals so prolific, and the women of Utopia wombs so ample, voracious, retentive and well-constructed of cells that at the end of every ninth month seven children at least, both male and female, were born of each marriage following the example of the people of Israel in Egypt, unless de Lyra was delirious; not so much, either, because of the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate and the attractiveness of the land of Dipsody, but rather so as to keep that land dutiful and obedient by newly resettling there his old and faithful subjects who, from time immemorial, had never known, recognized or admitted any lord but him and who, as soon as they were born into this world, had with their mothers’ milk been suckled on the sweetness and generosity of his rule, being forever infused with it and brought up on it, which gave a firm hope that they would rather abandon their bodily lives than that unique and primary duty which is owed by nature to monarchs by their subjects, no matter where they might be resettled or transplanted.","Yes Sir, (said the prisoner) he is there in person, and we call him Anarchus, King of the Dipsodes, which is as much to say as thirsty people, for you never saw men more thirsty, nor more willing to drink, and his tent is guarded by the Giants: It is enough (said Pantagruel) come brave boyes, are you resolved to go with me?"
"« L’altercation fut grande ; le badaud peuple de Paris accourut au débat de toutes parts. Là se trouva à propos Seigny Joan le fol, citadin de Paris. L’ayant aperçu, le rôtisseur demanda au faquin : « Veux-tu sur notre différend croire ce noble Seigny Joan ? » – « Oui, par le sambreguoy, » répondit le faquin. Adonc Seigny Joan, avoir[15] leur discord[16] entendu, commanda au faquin qu’il lui tirât de son baudrier quelque pièce d’argent. Le faquin lui mit en main un tournois philippus. Seigny Joan le prit et le mit sur son épaule gauche, comme explorant s’il était de poids ; puis le timpait[17] sur la paume de sa main gauche, comme pour entendre s’il était de bon aloi ; puis le posa sur la prunelle de son œil droit, comme pour voir s’il était bien marqué. Tout ce fut fait en grand silence de tout le badaud peuple, en ferme attente du rôtisseur et désespoir du faquin. Enfin le fit sur l’ouvroir sonner par plusieurs fois. Puis en majesté présidentale, tenant sa marotte on[18] poing, comme si fût un sceptre, et affublant en tête son chaperon de martres singesses[19], à oreilles de papier, fraisé à points d’orgues, toussant préalablement deux ou trois bonnes fois, dit à haute voix : « La cour vous dit que le faquin, qui a son pain mangé à la fumée du rôt, civilement a payé le rôtisseur au son de son argent. Ordonne ladite cour que chacun se retire en sa chacunière, sans dépens, et pour cause. » Cette sentence du fol parisien tant a semblé équitable, voire admirable, ès docteurs susdits, qu’ils font doute, en cas que la matière eût été on parlement dudit lieu, ou en la rote à Rome, voire certes entre les Aréopagites décidée, si plus juridiquement.eût été par eux sentencié. Pourtant advisez si conseil voulez d’un fol prendre. »","“The altercation was great; the onlooker people of Paris flocked to the debate from all sides. There happened to be Seigny Joan le Fol, a citizen of Paris. Having seen him, the roaster asked the rascal: ""Do you want to believe this noble Seigny Joan about our dispute?"" ""Yes, by the sambreguoy,"" replied the rascal. So Seigny Joan, having heard [15] their discord [16], ordered the rascal to take some piece of silver from his harness. The rascal handed him a Tournament Philippus. Seigny Joan took it and put it on her left shoulder, as if exploring whether it was heavy; then stamped it[17] on the palm of his left hand, as if to hear if it was of good quality; then put it on the pupil of his right eye, as if to see if it was well marked. All this was done in great silence by all the onlookers, in firm expectation of the roaster and despair of the rascal. Finally made him ring the doorbell several times. Then in presidential majesty, holding his fad in his[18] fist, as if it were a sceptre, and decking out his chaperone of monkey martens[19] at the head, with paper ears, milled at organ points, coughing beforehand two or three good times, said aloud: ""The court tells you that the scoundrel, who has had his bread eaten by the smoke of the roast, has civilly paid the roaster with the sound of his money."" Orders the said court that each retire in his own right, without costs, and for cause. This sentence of the Parisian madman so much seemed equitable, even admirable, to the aforesaid doctors, that they are in doubt, in the event that the matter had been in the parliament of the said place, or in the rota in Rome, even certainly between the Areopagites decided, if more juridically had been sentenced by them. However, advise if you want to take advice madly. »","Great was the altercation. From all parts of Paris the stupid mob came running up to watch the quarrel. ‘There, most felicitously, stood the fool Seigny Johan, a citizen of Paris. The roasting-cook saw him and asked the porter’s boy: “Would you trust this noble Seigny Johan over our disagreement?” ‘“Gosh, yes,” replied the porter’s boy. ‘And so, Seigny Johan, having heard their opposing cases, ordered the porter’s boy to take a silver coin out of his purse, and the lad placed a phillipus in his hand. Seigny Johan took it and put it upon his left shoulder as if to discover whether it was of the right weight; he then tapped it against the palm of his left hand, as though to hear whether it was of good alloy; he then placed it close up against the ball of his right eye, as if to see whether it had been well minted. All of which was done amidst the deep silence of the gazing mob, with the roast-meat man confidently waiting and the porter’s boy full of despair. Eventually the fool rang the coin several times on the stall. Then, with the majesty of a presiding judge and while holding his bauble in his hand as though it were a sceptre, he donned his fool’s cap (which imitated fine fur but had ear-flaps of paper encircled by an organ-pipe ruff), gave two or three fine prefatory coughs and then loudly said: ‘“The Court decides that the porter’s boy who ate his bread to the smell of the roast has, in accordance with Civil Law, duly paid the roast-meat man with the ringing of his coin. The Court now commands that all go home, each to his each-one-ery. No order for costs. The Court rises.” ‘That judgement by the Parisian fool appeared so equitable, so amazing to the scholars that they doubt, if the case had been judged by the local Parlement [, the Roman Rotta] or even the Areopagus, that it would have been more judiciously settled. So think about taking counsel from a fool.’","The Altercation waxed hot in Words, which moved the gaping Hoydons of the sottish Parisians to run from all parts therabouts to see what the issue would be of that babling Strife and Contention. In the interim of this Dispute, to very good purpose, Seiny Ihon the Fool and Citizen of Paris, hapned to be there, whom the Cook perceiving, said to the Porter, Wilt thou refer and submit unto the noble Seiny Ihon, the Decision of the Difference and Controversie which is betwixt us? Yes, by the blood of a Goose, answered the Porter, I am content. Seiny Ihon the Fool, finding that the Cook and Porter had compromised the Determination of their Variance and Debate to the Discretion of his Award and Arbitriment; after that the Reasons on either side whereupon was grounded the mutual fierceness of their brawling Jar had been to the full displayed and laid open before him, commanded the Porter to draw out of the Fab of his Belt a piece of Money, if he had it. Whereupon the Porter immediately without delay, in Reverence to the Authority of such a Judicious Umpire, put the tenth part of a Silver Phillip into his Hand. This little Phillip Seiny Ihon took, then set it on his left Shoulder, to try by feeling if it was of a sufficient weight; after that, laying it on the palm of his Hand he made it ring and tingle, to understand by the Ear if it was of a good Alloy in the Metal whereof it was composed: Thereafter he put it to the Ball or Apple of his Left Eye, to explore by the sight if it was well stamped and marked; all which being done, in a profound Silence of the whole doltish People, who were there Spectators of this Pageantry, to the great hope of the Cooks, and despair of the Porters Prevalency in the Suit that was in agitation, he finally caused the Porter to make it sound several times upon the Stal of the Cooks Shop. Then with a Presidential Majesty holding his Bable (Scepter-like) in his Hand, muffling his Head with a Hood of Martern Skins, each side whereof had the resemblance of an Ape’s Face, sprucified up with Ears of pasted Paper, and having about his neck a bucked Ruff, raised, furrowed, and ridged, with Ponting Sticks of the shape and fashion of small Organ-Pipes; he first, with all the force of his Lungs, coughed two or three times, and then with an audible Voice pronounced this following Sentence , The Court declareth, That the Porter, who ate his Bread at the Smoak of the Roast, hath civilly paid the Cook with the Sound of his Money. And the said Court Ordaineth, That every one return to his own home, and attend his proper business, without Cost and Charges, and for a Cause. This Verdict, Award and Arbitriment of the Parisian Fool, did appear so equitable, yea, so admirable to the aforesaid Doctors, that they very much doubted, if the Matter had been brought before the Sessions for Justice of the said Place, or that the Judges of the Rota at Rome had been Umpires therein; or yet that the Areopagites themselves had been the Deciders thereof, if by any one part, or all of them together, it had been so judicially sententiated and awarded. Therefore advise, if you will be counselled by a Fool."
"Auquel outrage un d’entre eux, nommé Frogier, bien honnête homme de sa personne et notable bachelier[8], répondit doucement : « Depuis quand avez-vous pris cornes qu’êtes tant rogues devenus ? Dea[9], vous nous en souliez[10] volontiers bailler et maintenant y refusez. Ce n’est fait de bons voisins, et ainsi ne vous faisons, nous, quand venez ici acheter notre beau froment, duquel vous faites vos gâteaux et fouaces. Encore par le[11] marché vous eussions-nous donné de nos raisins ; mais, par la mer Dé[12], vous en pourriez repentir, et aurez quelque jour affaire de nous. Lors nous ferons envers vous à la pareille, et vous en souvienne. »","To which outrage one of them, named Frogier, a very honest man of his person and notable bachelor[8], replied gently: “Since when have you taken horns that you have become so many rogues? Dea[9], you relieved us[10] willingly to yawn and now refuse to do so. They are not good neighbours, and so do you when you come here to buy our fine wheat, from which you make your cakes and cakes. Still by the [11] market we would have given you some of our grapes; but, by the sea De[12], you could repent of it, and will some day have business with us. Then we will do the same to you, and remember you. »","At such an outrage, one of the shepherds named Frogier, a decent fellow in his appearance and a worthy young man, quietly replied, ‘Since when have you grown your horns and become so cheeky! Garn, you used to be pleased to sell them to us: now you won’t. That’s not a good-neighbourly deed. We never treat you like that when you come over here buying our best wheat to make your fouaces and your buns! We’d have throw in some grapes as well, but, by the Mudder of God, you’ll be sorry for this. You’ll need to trade with us one day: then we’ll do the same to you. Remember that!’","To which provoking words, one amongst them, called Forgier, (an honest fellow of his person, and a notable springal,) made answer very calmly thus: How long is it since you have got homes, that you are become so proud? indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money? This is not the part of good neighbours, neither do we serve you thus when you come hither to buy our good corn, whereof you make your cakes and buns: besides that, we would have given you to the bargain some of our grapes, but by his zounds, you may chance to repent it, and possibly have need of us at another time, when we shall use you after the like manner, and therefore remember it."
"Pan menait l’arrière-garde, homme horrifique et monstrueux, car par les parties inférieures du corps il ressemblait à un bouc, les cuisses avait velues, portait cornes en tête droites contre le ciel. Le visage avait rouge et enflambé, et la barbe bien fort longue, homme hardi, courageux, hasardeux et facile à entrer en courroux. En main senestre portait une flûte, en dextre un bâton courbé ; ses bandes étaient semblablement composées de Satyres, Hémipans, Argypans, Sylvains, Faunes, Lémures[18], Lares, Farfadets et Lutins, en nombre de soixante et dix-huit mille cent et quatorze. Le signe[19] commun à tous était ce mot : Évohé.","Pan led the rear guard, a horrifying and monstrous man, for in the lower parts of his body he looked like a goat, his thighs had hairy, his horns on his head erect against the sky. The face was red and inflamed, and the beard very very long, a bold man, courageous, risky and easy to get angry. In the left hand carried a flute, in the right a curved stick; his bands were likewise composed of Satyrs, Hemipans, Argypans, Sylvans, Fauns, Lemures[18], Lares, Sprites and Goblins, in number seventy and eighteen thousand one hundred and fourteen. The sign[19] common to all was this word: Évohé.","Pan brought up the rear: a terrifying monster of a man, for with his hairy thighs he was like a goat in his nether limbs; on his head were horns pointing straight up to the heavens. His face was rubicund and flushed, his beard extremely long: he was a bold, courageous, daring male, easily provoked to wrath; in his left hand he held a flute; in his right, a bent stick. His bands were made up of satyrs, hemipans, aegipans, sylvans, fauns, lemures, lares, goblins and hobgoblins, to the number of seventy-eight thousand, one hundred and fourteen.

10. Comment Panurge enseigne une manière bien nouvelle de bâtir les murailles de Paris,10. How Panurge teaches a very new way of building the walls of Paris,May this be settled? I leave it all to you. Think about it.,CHAPTER XV How Panurge shewed a very new way to build the walls of Paris.
"Frère Jean, à l’approcher, sentait je ne sais quelle odeur autre que de poudre à canon. Dont il tira Panurge en place, et aperçut que sa chemise était toute foireuse et embrenée de frais. La vertu rétentrice du nerf qui restreint le muscle nommé sphincter (c’est le trou du cul) était dissolue[7] par la véhémence de la peur qu’il avait eue en ses fantastiques visions, adjoint le tonnerre de telles canonnades, lequel plus est horrifique par les chambres basses que n’est sur le tillac. Car un des symptômes et accidents de peur est que par lui ordinairement s’ouvre le guichet du sérail onquel[8] est à temps la matière fécale retenue.","Brother Jean, on approaching him, smelt I don't know what odor other than gunpowder. From which he pulled Panurge into place, and saw that his shirt was all crap and smeared with freshness. The restraining virtue of the nerve which restricts the muscle called the sphincter (it is the asshole) was dissolved [7] by the vehemence of the fear which he had had in his fantastic visions, added the thunder of such cannonades, which more is horrifying by the lower chambers than is on the tillac. Because one of the symptoms and accidents of fear is that it usually opens the wicket of the seraglio on which [8] is the retained faecal matter in time.","As he drew near, Frère Jean smelt an odour which was not that of gun-powder. So he tugged out Panurge and saw his shirt all covered with thin excrement and freshly beshitten. The retentive powers of the sinew which restrains the muscle called the sphincter (that is, the arsehole) had been relaxed by the vehemence of the fear which Panurge had felt during his phantasmagorical visions; to which add the thundering of the cannonades, which is more terrifying down below in the cabins than up on deck. For one of the symptoms and by-products of fear is that it usually unlocks the aperture of the pen within which the faeces are temporarily retained.","Fryar Jhon, at the approach of Panurge, was entertain’d with a kind of smell that was not like that of Gun-powder, nor altogether so sweet as Musk; which made him turn Panurge about, and then he saw that his Shirt was dismally bepah’d, and beray’d with fresh Sir-reverence. The retentive Faculty of the Nerve which restrains the Muscle call’d Sphincter (’tis the Arse-hole an’t please you) was relaxated by the violence of the fear which he had been in during his fantastic Visions. Add to this the thundering noise of the shooting, which seems more dreadful between Decks than above. Nor ought you to wonder at such a mishap, for one of the Symptoms and Accidents of Fear is, that it often opens the wicket of the Cupboard wherein secondhand-meat is kept for a time. Let’s illustrate this noble Theme with some Examples."
"« Davantage, désormais ne naîtra pet en tout Salmigondinois qui n’ait son renvoi vers mon nez. Tous les péteurs du monde, pétants, disent : « Voilà pour les quittes ». Ma vie finira bientôt, je le prévois (je vous recommande mon épitaphe), et mourrai tout confit en pets. Si quelque jour, pour restaurant à faire péter les bonnes femmes, en extrême passion de colique venteuse, les médicaments ordinaires ne satisfont aux médecins, la momie de mon paillard et empété corps leur sera remède présent. En prenant tant peu que direz, elles péteront plus qu’ils n’entendent. C’est pourquoi je vous prierais volontiers que de dettes me laissez quelque centurie, comme le roi Louis onzième, jetant hors de procès Miles d’Illiers, évêque de Chartres, fut importuné lui en laisser quelqu’un pour s’exercer. J’aime mieux leur donner toute ma caquerolière[13], ensemble ma hannetonnière, rien pourtant ne déduisant du sort principal.","“Furthermore, henceforth no fart will be born in any Salmigondinois that does not have its referral to my nose. All the farts in the world, farts, say: ""Here's to the quits."" My life will end soon, I foresee it (I recommend my epitaph to you), and I will die all confit in farts. If some day, for a restaurant to make the good women fart, in extreme passion of windy colic, the ordinary medicines do not satisfy the doctors, the mummy of my bawdy and swollen body will be their present remedy. By taking as little as you say, they will fart more than they hear. This is why I would beg you willingly to leave me a hundred debts, as King Louis Eleventh, throwing out of trial Miles d'Illiers, Bishop of Chartres, was importuned to leave him someone to practice. I prefer to give them all my caquerolière[13], together my beetle, nothing however deducing from the main fate.","‘Moreover, in all the land of Salmagundi, from this day forth not one fart will be born which is not to be directed towards my nose. For whenever they break wind, all the farters in the world say, “That’s for those who are out of debt!” My life will soon come to an end: I can foresee that. I entrust my epitaph to you. And I shall die, all peacefully pickled in farts. Should it ever come to pass that the usual medicines fail to satisfy physicians seeking a restorative to enable good dames to break wind when suffering from an extreme access of the gripes, powdered mummy from my wretched be-farted body will be a ready remedy for them. And taking the tiniest bit of it, they will fart more than the physicians ever expected. ‘That is why I would beseech you to leave me with a good hundred or so debts, just as, when King Louis the Eleventh had quashed all the lawsuits of Miles d’Illiers, the bishop of Chartres, he was pressed to leave him just one to practise upon. Why I’d rather pay them all off with my cockchafers and snails, without touching the capital though.’","Furthermore, there shall not one hereafter, Native of the Country of Salmigondy, but he shall level the Shot towards my Nose; all the back-cracking Fellows of the World, in discharging of their Postern Petarades, use commonly to say, Voila pour les quitters; that is, For the quit. My Life will be of very short continuance, I do foresee it, I recommend to you the making of my Epitaph; for I perceive I will die confected in the very stinch of Farts. If at any time to come, by way of restorative to such good Women as shall happen to be troubled with the grievous Pain of the Wind-Cholick, the ordinary Medicaments prove nothing effectual, the Mummy of all my befarted Body will streight be as a present Remedy appointed by the Physicians; whereof they taking any small Modicum, it will incontinently for their Ease afford them a Rattle or Bum-shot, like a Sal of Muskets. Therefore would I beseech you to leave me some few Centuries of Debts: as King Louis the Eleventh, exempting from Suits in Law the Reverend Milles d’Illiers Bishop of Chartre, was by the said Bishop most earnestly sollicited to leave him some few for the Exercise of his mind. I had rather give them all my Revenue of the Periwinkles, together with the other Incomes of the Locusts, albeit I should not thereby have any parcel abated from off the principal Sums which I owe."

"– Foi d’homme de bien, dit Panurge, je n’en mens de mot. Je le bande d’une méchante braie[27] que je trouve là demi-brûlée et vous le lie rustrement pieds et mains de mes cordes, si bien qu’il n’eût su regimber ; puis lui passai ma broche à travers la gargamelle[28] et le pendis, accrochant la broche à deux crampons qui soutenaient des hallebardes. Et vous attise un beau feu au dessous, et vous flambais mon milourt[29] comme on fait les harengs saurets à la cheminée. Puis prenant sa bougette[30] et un petit javelot qui était sur les crampons, m’enfuis le beau galop. Et Dieu sait comme je sentais mon épaule de mouton !","“Faith of a good man,” said Panurge, “I do not lie a word of it. I bandage him with a nasty braie[27] which I find there half-burnt and tie him to you rudely feet and hands with my cords, so that he would not have been able to kick back; then passed my brooch to him through the gargamelle[28] and hung him, hooking the brooch to two hooks which supported halberds. And kindle a fine fire for you below, and you blaze my miourt[29] as one makes pickled herrings on the chimney. Then taking his buggy[30] and a small javelin which was on the crampons, I fled at a good gallop. And God knows how my mutton shoulder smelled!","Twixt men no difference. For they shall say that each man in his turn Shall drive right high, and then to earth return. Men form in bands and argue at this point: Discord, and fights: the time so out of joint, That even History, full of wondrous things,","By the faith of an honest man (said Panurge) I do not lie in one word. I swadled him in a scurvie swathel-binding, which I found lying there half burnt, and with my cords tied him royster-like both hand and foot, in such sort that he was not able to winse; then past my spit thorough his throat, and hanged him thereon, fastening the end thereof at two great hooks or cramp-irons, upon which they did hang their Halberds; and then kindling a faire fire under him, did flame you up my Milourt, as they use to do dry herrings in a chimney: with this, taking his budget, and a little javelin that was upon the foresaid hooks, I ran away a faire gallop-rake, and God he knows how I did smell my shoulder of mutton."

"Voyant le moine que toute leur pensée n’était sinon à gagner au pied, descend de son cheval et monte sur une grosse roche qui était sur le chemin, et avec son grand braquemart[16] frappait sur ces fuyards à grand tour de bras, sans se faindre[17] ni épargner. Tant en tua et mit par terre que son braquemart rompit en deux pièces.","Seeing the monk whom all their thought was only to gain on foot, dismounts from his horse and climbs on a large rock which was on the way, and with his great braquemart [16] strikes on these fugitives with a great turn of arms, without flinching[17] or sparing. Both killed and knocked down his Braquemard broke in two pieces.","When the Monk saw that they had no thought but to flee on foot, he dismounted and climbed on to a large rock overhanging the road and struck down the fugitives with his sword, making great sweeps with his arm, neither sparing nor considering himself. So many did he slay and cast to the ground that his sword snapped in twain.","And presently the Monk gave his horse the spurre, and kept the way that the enemy held, who had met with Gargantua and his companions in the broad highway, and were so diminished of their number, for the enormous slaughter that Gargantua had made with his great tree amongst them, as also Gymnast, Ponocrates, Eudemon, and the rest, that they began to retreat disorderly and in great haste, as men altogether affrighted and troubled in both sense and understanding; and, as if they had seen the very proper species and forme of death before their eyes; or rather as when you see an Asse with a brizze or gad-bee under his taile, or flie that stings him, run hither and thither without keeping any path or way, throwing down his load to the ground, breaking his bridle and reines, and taking no breath nor rest, and no man can tell what ailes him, for they see not any thing touch him: so fled these people destitute of wit, without knowing any cause of flying, only pursued by a panick terror, which in their mindes they had conceived."

"Le moine, les voyant départir[1] en désordre, conjectura qu’ils allaient charger sur Gargantua et ses gens, et se contristait merveilleusement de ce qu’il ne les pouvait secourir. Puis avisa la contenance de ses deux archers de garde, lesquels eussent volontiers couru après la troupe pour y butiner quelque chose, et toujours regardaient vers la vallée en laquelle ils descendaient.","The monk, seeing them depart[1] in disorder, conjectured that they were going to charge on Gargantua and his people, and was marvelously saddened that he could not help them. Then noticed the countenance of his two guard archers, who would gladly have run after the troop to loot something, and always looked towards the valley in which they were descending.","[Becomes Chapter 44. Medical ‘comedy of cruelty’ at Rabelais’ best. Rabelais drew the matter of his Virgilian simile from an adage of Erasmus taken literally: II, VIII, LIV, ‘Roused by a gad-fly’. (Juno drove Io the cow into a frenzy by plaguing her with a horsefly.) The sudden, empty terror known as ‘panic terror’ is also the subject of an adage of Erasmus (III, VII, III, ‘Panic events’).] The Monk, seeing them make off in disorder, conjectured that they were on their way to attack Gargantua and his men, and it made him wondrously depressed that he could not help them. He then became aware of the comportment of the two archers of his guard, who would have much preferred to chase after their troops and seize some plunder: they kept looking along the valley where the others were making their way down.","How the Monk rid himself of his Keepers, and how Picrocholes forlorne hope was defeated. THE Monk seeing them break off thus without order, conjectured that they were to set upon Gargantua and those that were with him, and was wonderfully grieved that he could not succour them; then considered he the countenance of the two keepers in whose custody he was, who would have willingly runne after the troops to get some booty and plunder, and were always looking towards the valley unto which they were going; farther, he syllogized, saying, These men are but badly skilled in matters of warre, for they have not required my paroll, neither have they taken my sword from me; suddenly hereafter he drew his brackmard or horsemans sword, wherewith he gave the keeper which held him, on the right side such a sound slash, that he cut clean thorough the jugularie veins, and the sphagitid or transparent arteries of the neck, with the fore-part of the throat called the gargareon, even unto the two Adenes, which are throat-kernels; and redoubling the blow, he opened the spinal marrow betwixt the second and third verteber; there fell down that keeper stark dead to the ground."
"« Mais parce que, selon le sage Salomon, sapience n’entre point en âme malivole[30], et science sans conscience n’est que ruine de l’âme, il te convient servir, aimer et craindre Dieu et en lui mettre toutes tes pensées et tout ton espoir et par foi, formée de charité, être à lui adjoint, en sorte que jamais n’en sois désemparé[31] par péché. Aie suspects les abus du monde. Ne mets ton cœur à vanité, car cette vie est transitoire, mais la parole de Dieu demeure éternellement. Sois serviable à tous les prochains et les aime comme toi-même. Révère tes précepteurs, fuis les compagnies de gens esquels tu ne veux point ressembler, et, les grâces que Dieu t’a données, icelles ne reçois en vain. Et quand tu connaîtras que auras tout le savoir de par delà acquis, retourne vers moi afin que je te voie et donne ma bénédiction devant que mourir.","“But because, according to the wise Solomon, knowledge does not enter into a malicious soul [30], and knowledge without conscience is only ruin of the soul, it is appropriate for you to serve, love and fear God and put all in him your thoughts and all your hope and by faith, formed of charity, be added to him, so that never be distraught[31] by sin. Have suspicions the abuses of the world. Do not set your heart on vanity, for this life is transitory, but the word of God endures forever. Be helpful to all neighbors and love them as yourself. Revere your preceptors, flee the company of people you do not want to resemble, and the graces that God has given you, here do not receive in vain. And when you will know that you will have all the knowledge beyond acquired, return towards me so that I see you and give my blessing before dying.","Beside the river were the pleasure-gardens with a maze in the middle, all very beautiful. Between the two other towers were laid out courts for balloon and royal-tennis. Towards the Cryère Tower were orchards full of every kind of fruit trees arranged in quincunxes. Beyond stretched the Great Park, teeming with all sorts of game. The firing-butts for harquebus, bow and cross-bow were sited between the third pair of towers. The kitchens were placed outside by the Hesperie Tower and were single-storeyed.","But because as the wise man Solomon saith, Wisdome entereth not into a malicious minde; and that knowledge without conscience is but the ruine of the soule, it behooveth thee to serve, to love, to feare God, and on him to cast all thy thoughts and all thy hope, and by faith formed in charity to cleave unto him, so that thou mayest never be separated from him by thy sins. Suspect the abuses of the world: set not thy heart upon vanity; for this life is transitory, but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. Be serviceable to all thy neighbours, and love them as thy self: reverence thy Præceptors: shun the conversation of those whom thou desirest not to resemble, and receive not in vaine the graces which God hath bestowed upon thee: and when thou shalt see that thou hast attained to all the knowledge that is to be acquired in that part, return unto me, that I may see thee, and give thee my blessing before I die."

"Et ne fut au temps d’Hélie plus échauffée que pour lors, car il n’était arbre sur terre qui eût ni feuille ni fleur.

"Les hespailliers[1] de la nef lanternière[2] amenèrent le physétère lié on terre de l’île prochaine, dite Farouche, pour en faire anatomie et recueillir la graisse des rognons, laquelle disaient être fort utile et nécessaire à la guérison de certaine maladie qu’ils nommaient faute d’argent. Pantagruel n’en tint compte, car autres assez pareils, voire encore plus énormes, avait vu en l’océan Gallique. Condescendit toutefois descendre en l’île Farouche pour sécher et rafraîchir aucuns[3] de ses gens mouillés et souillés par le vilain physétère, à un petit port désert vers le midi, situé lez une touche[4] de bois haute, belle et plaisante, de laquelle sortait un délicieux ruisseau d’eau douce, claire et argentine. Là, dessous belles tentes, furent les cuisines dressées, sans épargne de bois. Chacun mué de vêtements à son plaisir, fut par frère Jean la campanelle[5] sonnée. Au son d’icelle furent les tables dressées et promptement servies.","The hespailliers[1] of the lantern nave[2] brought the physetera bound to the ground from the nearby island, called Farouche, to do anatomy and collect the fat from the kidneys, which said was very useful and necessary for the healing of certain disease they named for lack of money. Pantagruel did not take it into account, because others quite similar, even more enormous, had seen in the Gallic ocean. Condescended, however, to go down to Farouche Island to dry and refresh some[3] of his people wet and soiled by the ugly physetera, at a small deserted port towards the south, located on a high, beautiful and pleasant touch[4] of wood , from which issued a delicious stream of fresh, clear and silvery water. There, under beautiful tents, were the kitchens set up, without saving wood. Everyone changed clothes at his pleasure, was rung by Brother Jean the campanelle[5]. At the sound of it the tables were set and promptly served.","An heroic element is introduced by an allusion to Dido and Aeneas from Aeneid, 1, 561ff.] Oarsmen from the Lantern trussed up the physeter and towed it ashore on to the nearby island called Ile Farouche so as to cut it up and recover the fat from its kidneys, which was said to be most useful, indeed necessary, for the curing of a certain malady called Lack-of-the-Ready. Pantagruel did not pay much attention, for he had already seen several others very like it – indeed, even huger ones – in the Gallic Ocean. He did however agree to disembark at the Ile Farouche to dry some of his men who had been drenched by the ugly physeter and to allow others who had been bespattered by it to freshen themselves up in a little deserted haven towards the south situated by a pleasant grove of tall, handsome trees; from it flowed a delightful scream of fresh water, clear and sparkling. Field-kitchens were set up under beautiful awnings there being no lack of firewood. Each man changed into whatever clothes he wished; Frère Jean then tolled the bell. At which the trestle-tables were laid and promptly served.","THE Boat’s Crew of the Ship Lantern tow’d the Physetere ashoar on the Neighbouring shoar (which happen’d to be the Wild Island) to make an Anatomical Dissection of its Body, and save the fat of its Kidneys, which, they said, was very useful and necessary for the Cure of a certain Distemper which they call’d want of Money. As for Pantagruel he took no manner of notice of the Monster, for he had seen many such, nay bigger in the Gallick Ocean. Yet he condescended to land in the Wild Island, to dry and refresh some of his Men (whom the Physetere had wetted and bedawb’d) at a small Desert Sea-port towards the South, seated near a fine pleasant Grove, out of which flow’d a delicious Brook of fresh, clear, and purling Water; here they pitch’d their Tents, and set up their Kitchins, nor did they spare Fewel. Every one having shifted, as they thought fit, Fryar Jhon rang the Bell, and the Cloth was immediately laid, and Supper brought in."
"Et voyant l’étole qu’il portait en écharpe, dit à Gargantua : « Ceux-ci ne sont que prêtres, ce n’est qu’un commencement de moine. Par saint Jean ! je suis moine parfait, je vous en tuerai comme de mouches. » Puis le grand galop courut après, tant qu’il attrapa les derniers et les abattait comme seigle, frappant à tort et à travers. Gymnaste interrogea sur l’heure Gargantua s’ils les devaient poursuivre. À quoi dit Gargantua : « Nullement, car selon vraie discipline militaire jamais ne faut mettre son ennemi en lieu de désespoir, parce que telle nécessité lui multiplie la force et accroît le courage, qui jà était déject et failli[13], et n’y a meilleur remède de salut à gens estommis[14] et recrus[15] que de n’espérer salut aucun. Quantes[16] victoires ont été tollues[17] des mains des vainqueurs par les vaincus, quand ils ne se sont contentés de raison, mais ont attempté[18] du tout mettre à internition[19] et détruire totalement leurs ennemis, sans en vouloir laisser un seul pour en porter le3 nouvelles ! Ouvrez toujours à vos ennemis toutes les portes et chemins, et plutôt leur faites un pont d’argent afin de les renvoyer.","And seeing the stole he wore as a scarf, said to Gargantua: “These are only priests, it is only the beginning of a monk. By Saint John! I am a perfect monk, I will kill you like flies. Then the gallop ran after, as long as he grabbed the last ones and beat them down like rye, hitting back and forth. Gymnast asked about the hour Gargantua if they should pursue them. To which Gargantua said: ""Not at all, for according to true military discipline one should never put one's enemy in a place of despair, because such necessity multiplies his strength and increases his courage, which was already dejected and failed[13], and does not there is a better remedy for the salvation of dull people[14] and recruits[15] than to hope for no salvation at all. Quantes[16] victories have been tollue[17] from the hands of the victors by the vanquished, when they were not satisfied with reason, but attempted[18] at all to put in internment[19] and totally destroy their enemies, without doing so. want to leave only one to carry the 3 new ones! Always open to your enemies all doors and paths, and rather make them a silver bridge in order to send them back.","Then, seeing his stole, the Monk said to Gargantua: ‘They’re only priests, the mere rudiment of a monk! I, by Saint John, am an accomplished monk: I shall swat them like flies.’ Then he galloped flat out after them and caught up with the stragglers, thrashing them down like rye as he struck out right and left. Gymnaste at once asked Gargantua whether they ought to pursue them. To which Gargantua replied: ‘Most certainly not; for according to the true art of war you should never drive your enemy into a desperate situation, since such straits redouble his strength and increase his courage, which until then had been abject and weak: there is no better remedy for bringing deliverance to confused and exhausted men than their having no hope of escape. How many victories have been snatched by the vanquished from the grasp of victors who were not content with the reasonable but tried to massacre and utterly destroy all their foes, unwilling to spare even one to bring the news. Always leave gates and routes open to your enemies: indeed, make them a bridge of silver to escape over.","Priests, which is but the beginning of a Monk; by St. Ihon I am a perfect Monk, I will kill them to you like flies: Then ran he after them at a swift and full gallop, till he overtook the reere, and felled them down like tree-leaves, striking athwart and alongst and every way. Gymnast presently asked Gargantua if they should pursue them? To whom Gargantua answered, by no means; for, according to right military discipline, you must never drive your enemy unto despair, for that such a strait doth multiply his force, and increase his courage, which was before broken and cast down; neither is there any better help, or outgate of relief for men that are amazed, out of heart, toiled and spent, then to hope for no favour at all. How many victories have been taken out of the hands of the Victors by the vanquished, when they would not rest satisfied with reason, but attempt to put all to the sword, and totally to destroy their enemies, without leaving so much as one to carry home newes of the defeat of his fellowes? Open therefore unto your enemies all the gates and wayes, and make to them a bridge of silver rather then faile, that you may be rid of them."

"50. Comment, en la cour du maître ingénieux[1], Pantagruel détesta les engastrimythes[2] et les gastrolâtres[3]","50. How, in the court of the ingenious master[1], Pantagruel detested the engastrimyths[2] and the gastrolaters[3]","CHAPTER 58 [‘Engastrimyths’ were in the strict sense ventriloquists – men or women with a prophetic spirit talking from within their bellies. The name of Jacoba Rhodigina’s indwelling spirit, Cincinnatulus (in French Crêpelu) means ‘Curly-head’. This anecdote, which seems so personal, is in fact not so. It is not an account of something Rabelais had witnessed in 1513. The words are lifted date and all – even the ‘we’ – from the Ancient Readings of Richerius Rhodiginus. Rabelais could well have called these people ‘Gastromarges’ (Gas-tromargoi, Men mad about their bellies) following Aristotle, as cited by Erasmus in an adage which influenced him here (II, VIII, LXXVIII, ‘Bellies’). But that term is too weak: the Fourth Book is concerned with idolatry. Monks are condemned not as men insanely devoted to the belly but as men who make the belly into a god. They are firmly condemned with echoes of the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer and by a long and sobering quotation from Saint Paul. (Philippians 3:19). The Belly, Messer Gaster, is a created driving-force within Nature. He must be acknowledged, but he is not God. Not even a god. He works within fallen Nature. The dread Belly-worshippers are monks, now all condemned as more than idle men concerned with vestments: they, like the Papimanes, worship a false god. Rabelais confounds Hesiod with Homer over a quotation very frequently applied to monks by their critics and enemies. He is still writing with his Plutarch open before him: his closing reference to the Cyclops is taken direct from the Obsolescence of Oracles, 435 AB. He also turns to the Adages of Erasmus for IV, I, XXXIX. ‘Eurycles’ (the name of a soothsaying ventriloquist in Antiquity). Rabelais starts off by calling Gaster ‘maistre ingénieux’; at that time ingénieux meant both ingenious and engineer.]","CHAPTER LVIII How at the Court of the Master of Ingenuity, Pantagruel detested the Engastrimythes, and the Gastrolaters."

"– Vraiment, dit Épistémon, j’en vis l’expérience à Saintes, en une procession générale, présent le tant bon, tant vertueux, tant docte et équitable président Briand Valée, seigneur du Douhet. Passant un boiteux ou boiteuse, un borgne ou borgnesse, un bossu ou bossue, on lui rapportait son nom propre. Si les syllabes du nom étaient en nombre impar, soudain, sans voir les personnes, il les disait être maléficiés[9], borgnes, boiteux, bossus du côté dextre. Si elles étaient en nombre par, du côté gauche. Et ainsi était la vérité, onques n’y trouvâmes exception.","“Truly,” said Epistemon, “I experienced it at Saintes, in a general procession, present by the so good, so virtuous, so learned and equitable president Briand Valée, lord of Douhet. Passing a lame or lame, a one-eyed or one-eyed woman, a hunchback or hunchback, they brought him back his own name. If the syllables of the name were in odd number, suddenly, without seeing the people, he said them to be cursed[9], one-eyed, lame, hunchbacked on the dexter side. If they were in par number, on the left side. And so was the truth, there was no exception.","‘Indeed,’ said Epistemon. ‘During a general procession at Saintes, I saw that fact corroborated in the presence of that good, virtuous, learned and fair presiding judge Briand Valée, the Seigneur Du Douhet: whenever a man or woman processed by who was lame, one-eyed or hunchbacked, their proper names were reported to him. At once, without seeing them, he declared that they were infirm, one-eyed, lame or hunchbacked on the right side if their names were of an odd number of syllables; on the left when the number was even. And it was true: we came across no exception.’","Indeed, said Epistemon. I saw this way of Syllabising, try’d at Xaintes at a general Procession in the Presence of that Good, Virtuous, Learned and just President Brian Valleé, Lord of Douhait. When there went by a Man or Woman that was either Lame, Blind of one Eye, or Hump-back’d, he had an Account brought him of his or her Name, and if the Syllables of the Name were of an odd number, immediately without seeing the Persons he declar’d them to be deform’d, Blind, Lame, or crooked of the Right side; and of the Left, if they were even in number: and such indeed we ever found them."
"Pourtant[4], un jour, habilla son dit roi d’un beau petit pourpoint de toile, tout déchiqueté comme la cornette d’un Albanais, et de belles chausses à la marinière, sans souliers (car, disait-il, ils lui gâteraient la vue), et un petit bonnet pers[5], avec une grande plume de chapon.

"Puis nous menèrent en un petit cabinet tout contrepointé[23] d’alarmes : là, fûmes traités, Dieu sait comment ! On dit que Jupiter, en la peau diphtère[24] de la chèvre qui l’allaita en Candie de laquelle il usa comme de pavois, combattants les Titanes, pourtant[25] est-il surnommé Eginchus, écrit tout ce que l’on fait au monde. Par ma foi, buveurs, mes amis, en dix-huit peaux de chèvres, on ne saurait les bonnes viandes qu’on nous servit, les entremets et bonne chère qu’on nous fit, décrire, voire fût-ce en lettres aussi petites que dit Cicéron avoir vu l’Iliade d’Homère tellement qu’on la couvrait d’une coquille do noix. De ma part, encore que j’eusse cent langues, cent bouches et la voix de fer, la copie[26] melliflue de Platon, je ne saurais en quatre livres vous en exposer la tierce partie d’une seconde. Et me disait Pantagruel que, selon son imagination, la dame à ses tabachins[27] disant : « à Panacée », leur donnait le mot symbolique entre eux de chère souveraine, comme : « en Apollo, » disait Luculle, quand festoyer voulait ses amis singulièrement, encore qu’on le prît à l’improviste, ainsi que quelquefois faisaient Cicéron et Hortensius.","Then led us to a little cabinet all counterpointed[23] with alarms: there, we were treated, God knows how! It is said that Jupiter, in the diphtheria[24] skin of the goat who suckled him in Candia, which he used as a shield, fighting the Titanes, yet[25] is nicknamed Eginchus, writes everything that is done in the world. By my faith, drinkers, my friends, in eighteen goat skins, we would not know the good meats that we were served, the entremets and good food that we were given, describe, even were it in letters as small what does Cicero say, having seen Homer's Iliad so much that it was covered with a nut shell. For my part, even though I had a hundred languages, a hundred mouths and a voice of iron, the mellifluous copy [26] of Plato, I could not in four books explain to you the third part of a second. And Pantagruel told me that, according to his imagination, the lady with her tabachins [27] saying: ""to Panacea"", gave them the symbolic word between them of dear sovereign, as: ""in Apollo,"" said Luculle, when feasting wanted her singularly friends, even though he was taken unawares, as Cicero and Hortensius sometimes did.","We were then taken into a little room, scattered all over with alarms. How we were treated then, Lord only knows. It is said that Jupiter, on the diphthera (the tanned hide of the nanny-goat which suckled him in Candy) which he used as a shield when battling against the Titans (which is why it is surnamed Eginchus) writes down everything that happens in the world: well, eighteen goat-skins would not suffice – by my faith, Friends and Drinkers! – to inscribe all the good viands they served up to us, all the side-dishes and the good cheer we were treated to, not even if it were written in such tiny letters as in that Iliad of Homer which Cicero claims to have seen: so small that you could cover it with a walnut-shell. On my part, even if I had a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths and a voice of iron, together with the mellifluous linguistic plenitude of Plato I could never, in four volumes, expound to you one-third of the twenty-fourth part of a goldsmith’s prime-weight of it. Pantagruel said to me, moreover, that in his opinion the dame, by saying to her Tabachins To Panacea, was giving them the watchword which was the symbol amongst them for good cheer, just as Lucullus said In Apollo when, though caught unprepared, he wanted to provide a very special feast for his friends. Cicero and Hortensius occasionally did the same. How the queen passed her time after dinner CHAPTER 20 [A variation on the theme of the Fountain of Youth The ‘pox of Rouen’ was proverbial. The ‘Tenesian axe’ figures in an adage of Erasmus (I, IX, XXIX, ‘The two-headed axe’). It represents hurried, harsh or summary justice. The dances (mainly already found in Athenaeus, Dipnosophists, 147) are not given in the manuscript. ‘Art’, as often, probably means the Art of Medicine. The ‘malady of Saint Francis’ is poverty.] Once the dinner was quite finished, we were led by a Chachanin into the Hall of that dame and witnessed how after her meal she, together with the ladies and princes of her Court, would sift her time, passing it, sieving it and dredging it through a big and beautiful strainer of blue and white silk. We then realized that they were reviving antiquity, dancing together: the Cordax, the Calabrism, the Emellia, the Molossian, the Sicinnis, the Cenophorum, the Iambics, the Mongas, the Persian, the Thelmastry, the Phrygian, the Floralia, the Nicatism, the Pyrrhic, the Thracian and hundreds of other dances. Afterwards we visited the palace at her command and saw things so novel, wonderful and exotic that I am still caught away in the spirit whenever I think of it. Yet nothing amazed us more than the doings of the noblemen of the household – the Abstractors, Parazones, Nebidins, Spodizators and so on – who told us frankly and without any dissimulation how it was that their Lady the queen alone healed the incurables and did the impossible, while they her officers merely did all the rest and cured the others. There I saw a young Parazon heal syphilitics of the very finest pox (the pox, you might say, of Rouen) merely by touching their dentiform vertebra three times with a splinter from a wooden clog. I saw another perfectly healing sufferers from various types of dropsy – tympanies, ascites and hyposarcides – by striking them nine times on their bellies with a Tenesian axe without any solution of continuity. One cured all fevers within the hour merely by hanging a fox’s tail from the sufferers’ belts on the left side; one cured toothache merely by laving the root of the aching tooth with elderberry vinegar and then letting it dry in the sun for half-an-hour; another cured all species of gout, both hot and cold, as well as the natural and sequential, merely by making the sufferers shut their mouths and open their eyes. Another one I saw curing nine fine noblemen of the malady of Saint Francis by relieving them of all their debts and suspending a string from their necks: from it there hung a little box crammed full with six thousand Sun-crowns. Another cast houses out of windows by some mirific device, so leaving them cleansed of malaria. Another cured all three forms of hectic fever (the atrophying, the consumptive and the wasting) without baths, Stabian milk, depilatories, pitch-dressings or any other medication, merely by turning his patients into monks for three months. He assured me that if they didn’t fatten up in the monastic state they never would, either by nature or by Art. Another I saw accompanied by a great number of women arranged in two groups: one group was formed of young maidens, appetizing, tender, blonde and gracious little things, all well disposed, it seemed, to me; the other, of old, toothless, bleary-eyed, wrinkled, sun-blackened, corpse-like old women. Then Pantagruel was told that he would remould those old women by his Art, making them youthful again like the young maidens there present whom he had remoulded that very day, restoring them to the same beauty, form, elegance, size and disposition of their limbs as they had had when they had been fifteen or sixteen, except only for their heels, which remained much shorter than in their first flush of youth (which explains why they are thenceforth very subject to readily falling backwards whenever they come across a man). The band of old women were devoutly waiting for the next baking and urgently pressing for it, protesting that it is not tolerable in nature that a well-disposed bum should lack beauty. That Parazon was in continuous demand for the practice of his Art, and his profits were more than mediocre. Pantagruel asked whether he could recast old men likewise and make them young. The reply was ‘No, but the way for men to grow young is to live together with a re-cast woman, for then they catch that fifth kind of syphilis, that hair-drop, called ophiasis in Greek, which makes them slough off their hair and skin as snakes do annually: their youth is then renewed in them as it is in the Arabian phoenix.16 That is the true fountain of youth. There he who was old and decrepit immediately becomes young, nimble and well disposed in body, as Euripides tells of Iolaus; as happened to the handsome Phaon (so beloved by Sappho through the bounty of Venus); to Tithonus, through Aurora; to Aeson, by Medea’s art; and likewise to Jason, who (according to the testimony of Pherecides and Simonides) was given back his youth by her and a fresh colour; as Aeschylus says happened to the nurse-maids of our good Bacchus (and their husbands too). How the officers of Quintessence worked in a variety of ways, and how the dame appointed us retainers in her retinue with the rank of Abstractors CHAPTER 21 [Proverbial fun, then playing with alchemy. The proverbs from the first draw heavily on Erasmus. Some of the French ones are already known to readers of Rabelais. For Erasmus see in his Adages: I, IV, L, ‘You are whitening an Ethiopian’; I, III, L, ‘To yoke foxes’; I, IV, LI, ‘To plough the shore’; I, IV, XLVIII, ‘You are washing a brick (or tile)’; I, IV, LXXV, ‘ You want water from a pumice-stone’; I, IV, LXXIX, ‘Wool from an ass’; I, IV, LXXX, ‘You are shearing an ass’; ‘I, III, LI, ‘To milk a he-goat (or a buck)’; I, IV, LX, ‘To draw water in a sieve’; III, III, XXXIX, ‘To wash an ass’s head in nitron’; II, I, LIX, ‘To pound water in a mortar’; I, IV, LXIII, ‘You are trying to catch winds in nets’; I, IV, LV, ‘To cleave fire’; I, III, LII, ‘About an ass’s shadow’; I, III, LIV, ‘To dispute about smoke’; I, III, LIII, ‘About goat’s wool’. One adage cited in the text is found in the Gospel but is not listed in Erasmus. It can be found but in the Adages of Adrian Junius (Basle, 1558): ‘E spinis uvas colligere’ (To gather grapes from thorns and figs from thistles). Socrates was praised by Cicero for bringing philosophy down to earth, but mocked by Aristophanes in The Clouds for playing with fleas.] Afterwards I saw a great number of her aforesaid officers, who were whitening Aethiopians in quite a short time simply by scratching their bellies with the bottom of a basket. Others had yoked together three pairs of foxes and were ploughing up the sandy shore without wasting their seeds. Others were washing tiles, making them lose colour. Others were extracting water from that porous lava you call pumice-stone, giving it a lengthy stir with a pestle in a marble mortar and so transmuting its substance. Others sheared asses, finding very good woollen fleeces on them. Others gathered grapes from thorns, and figs from thistles. Others were milking billygoats into sieves, which proved very economical. Others scrubbed the heads of their asses yet wasted no soap. Others hunted winds with nets and caught decuman crayfish in them. I saw one Spodizator who was ingeniously getting farts out of a dead donkey and selling some of them at five-pence per ell. Others were putrefying sechaboths. A fine dish it made! But Panurge got violently sick on seeing an Archasdarpanin putrefying a great vatful of human urine by means of horse-dung and a mass of Christian shit. Ugh! Nasty fellow! He, however, retorted that he gave that holy distillation to kings and great princes to drink, by which means he lengthened their lives by a good yard or two. Others were breaking chidlings across their knees. Others skinned eels from the tail-end, and they did not scream before they were skinned as do eels from Melun. Others made great somethings out of nothing, and to that nothing made somethings return. Others cut fire with a knife and drew up water in a net. Others made lanterns from bladders, and bronze pots out of clouds. 17 We also saw a dozen others holding a banquet beneath a bower; they drank four sorts of wine, cool and delicious, out of fair and ample bowls, drinking to all with all their might: we were told that they were improving the weather in the local way, and that, in days gone by, Hercules too had thus improved the weather together with Atlas. Others were making virtue out of necessity, and it seemed to me very fine and relevant work. They did alchemy on their teeth, producing little to fill their close-stools.18 Others were carefully measuring the hopping of fleas along a flat strip of ground; and they assured me that their activity was more than necessary to the governing of kingdoms, the conducting of wars and the administration of states, citing the example of Socrates, who (having been the first to bring philosophy down from the heavens and to make it useful and profitable instead of lazy and inquisitive) employed one half of his time in measuring the hops of fleas, as the quintessential Aristophanes attests. I saw a pair of Giborins – giants – standing apart as sentinels on a high tower: we were told that they were guarding the moon from the wolves. I met four more of them in a corner of a garden, bitterly disputing and ready to tear out each other’s hair. On asking what their quarrel arose from, I was told that four days had gone by since they had begun a dispute over three deep, metaphysical propositions. They had promised themselves mountains of gold once they had resolved them. The first concerned the shadow cast by a well-hung ass; the second, the smoke of a lantern; the third, goat’s hair: i.e., is it wool? They went on to tell us how it did not seem odd to them that there could be two contradictory assertions which were both true in mode, form, figure and time. The Sophists of Paris would rather be de-christened than confess it. We were attentively watching the wondrous acts of those people when their dame appeared with her entourage of nobles (Hesperus was already shining bright.) Upon her arrival our senses were again troubled and our eyes were dazzled. She at once noticed our awe and said to us: ‘What makes human thoughts lose their way within the abysses of wonder is not the supremacy of actions (which they realize to derive from natural causes through the industry of skilled artificers), it is the novelty of the experience entering their senses, since they do not perceive how easy the activity is when serene judgement is allied to scrupulous study. So keep your mind awake and rid yourself of any fear which could seize you when you contemplate what is done before your eyes by my artificers. Of your own free-will see, hear and contemplate everything which my household contains, gradually emancipating yourself from the slavery of ignorance. The matter accords well with my own will, of which I give you knowledge unfeigned (out of consideration for the studious desires of which you seem to me to have provided sufficient proof and a joyful abundance in your minds). I now retain you in the state and office of my Abstractors. As you leave this place, you will be formally enrolled by Geber, my Prime Tabachin.’ Without uttering a word, we humbly thanked her, accepting the offer of the fine position she was conferring on us. How the queen was served at supper, and of her manner of eating CHAPTER 22 [The jest about the ‘pâtéts in pie-crusts’ leaves editors perplexed: perhaps it is partly a veiled account of alchemical sublimation.] The dame, having finished her discourse, turned round to her noblemen and said: ‘The orifice of the stomach (that ambassador for the common victualling of all our limbs, both major and minor) importunes us to restore to limbs, by the distribution of appropriate foods , what has been taken from them through the continuous action of natural heat upon basic humours.19 It will be your fault alone, O Spodizators, Cesenins, Nemains and Perazons, if our trestle-tables are not promptly set up and abounding in every kind of restoratives. And you my noble Food-Tasters together with my noble Chewer: the proof that I have been given of your industry, interlaced with care and diligence, means that I cannot order you to be attentive to duty and to be ever on your guard. I merely remind you to go on as before.’ Once those words were said, she withdrew for a while with some of her ladies; we were told that it was to have a bath, which was as customary amongst the Ancients as washing our hands before a meal is to us. The trestles were promptly set up and decked with very precious table-cloths. The service was so ordered that the dame ate nothing but ambrosia and drank nothing but heavenly nectar, whilst the lords and ladies of her household were served as we were with all sorts of dishes, as rich and rare and appetizing as any that Apicius ever dreamt up. At dessert there was brought in a ragoût made up of many varied meats, in case hunger had not declared a truce. The serving-platter was of such dimensions and capacity that the golden plane-tree which Pythius Bithinus gave to King Darius would scarce have covered it. That ragoût was replete with pot-loads of various stews, salads, fricassées, casseroles, goat-meat potages, meats (roasted, boiled and grilled), huge steaks of salted beef, fine old-style hams, deific preserved meats, pastries, pies, a whole world of couscous prepared in the Moorish style, cheeses, junkets, jellies and every kind of fruit. All of which seemed good and appetizing to me, but, being full and replete, I never tasted any. I should warn you, though, that I saw some pates in pie-crusts – something quite rare – and those pâtés in pie-crusts were pates potted. At the bottom of that ragoût I espied a great many dice, playing-cards, tarot-packs, spillikin-slips, chessmen and draughts, together with a goblet full of Sun-crowns for any who wished to play. Finally, right at the bottom, I noticed a number of mules wearing fine caparisons with velvet covers; hackneys (for both men and women to ride), dressed in similar trappings, and litters – I don’t know how many – similarly lined with velvet and a few Ferrara-style coaches for those who might enjoy themselves out-of-doors. That did not seem odd to me, but what did seem novel was the dame’s way of eating. She masticated nothing: not that she did not have good strong teeth nor that her foods did not require mastication, but such was her manner and custom. Her foods, after the Tasters had assayed them, were taken over by her Chewers and nobly masticated for her, their throats being lined with crimson satin containing streaks of gold and gold-braid, whilst their teeth were of beautiful white ivory: with such help, once they had masticated her food to a turn, they poured it directly into her stomach through a funnel of fine gold. For the same reason, she never had a stool except by procuration. How a joyful ball was staged under the form of a tournament in the presence of Quintessence CHAPTER 23 [Games of chess in the form of a ballet, all influenced by The Dream of Polifilo of Colonna. The author of the chess chapters tells his tale with a disconcerting mixture of past and present tenses (changing tenses within quite short sentences). He is not followed slavishly here. This and the following chapter are not in the manuscript.] Once that supper was over, a ball was staged in that dame’s presence. It took the form of a knightly tournament which was worth not merely watching but being for ever remembered. To begin with the floor of the Hall was covered with an ample piece of velvet carpet made in the form of a chess-board, that is with squares, half of which were white and the others yellow; each was three spans wide and perfectly squared off on all sides. Whereupon there entered into that Hall thirty-two young personages, sixteen of which were dressed in cloth-of-gold: namely eight young nymphs, such as were portrayed by the Ancients in the suite of Diana; one king, one queen, two castle-guards, two knights and two archers. The sixteen others were similarly drawn up, all arrayed in cloth-of-silver. They took up their places on the carpet as follows: the kings stood in the back row on the fourth square, in such a way that the golden king was on a white square and the silver king on a yellow. The queens stood beside their kings, the golden queen on the yellow square, the silver queen on the white, with two archers either side of them, each as guards of their own king and queen. Beside the archers stood two knights, and beside the knights, two castle-guards. In the row next in front of them stood the eight nymphs. Between the two troops of nymphs, four rows of squares were left empty. Each troop had musicians on its side, clad in the like livery, one troop in orange damask and the other in white damask; there were eight either side, with various instruments happily contrived, all playing together in a most wonderful concord and harmony but varying in tone, tempi and measure as required by the progress of that ball. I found it all most remarkable, given the many variations of steps, moves, leaps, bounds, returns, flights, ambushes and surprises. What, it seemed to me, surpassed even more the notions of men was the fact that the personages in that ball should at once understand the tune which was appropriate to each advance or retreat, so that the note of the music had no sooner sounded before they were propelling themselves towards their designated places despite all their motions being so diverse. The nymphs, who are in the front row as ones prepared to join battle, march straight ahead against their foes, stepping from square to square except in their first moves, in which they are free to advance two squares. They alone may never retreat. Should one of them reach as far as the row of their enemy king she is crowned a queen to her own king, from now on taking pieces and making moves with the same privileges of the queen herself; otherwise she may never strike her foes save diagonally – obliquely – and straight ahead. It is, however, never permissible for them or any others to take any of their foes if by so doing they would leave their own king unprotected and exposed to capture. The kings march and take their enemies from any square on the board, moving only from a white square to an adjacent yellow one and vice-versa, with the exception that at their first move they may (if their row is found to be empty of other officers save either of its castle-guards) set him in their place and withdraw beside him. The queens manoeuvre and capture more freely than all the others, namely in any way, in any place, in every manner, as far as they like in a straight line (provided that it be not blocked by one of their own side) as well as diagonally, provided that they keep to the colour of their emplacement. The archers march equally well forwards or backwards, far and near alike; but they never change from the colour of their original emplacement. The knights march and take their foes at right-angles, first passing freely over a square even when occupied by one of their men or one of their enemies, and then landing either to the right or to the left, always with a change of colour. Such a leap is greatly detrimental to the adversary and closely to be watched, for they never take anyone openly, face on. The castle-guards do march and capture face on as well as to the right as to the left and forwards as much as backwards, as do the kings; and they can march as far as they like to any empty space (which the kings may not do). The rule governing both sides requires the king to be besieged and hemmed in by the enemy at the last stage of the combat, in such a way that he cannot escape on any side whatsoever. When he is so hemmed in that he is unable to flee and incapable of being succoured by his own side, the combat ceases and the besieged king is the loser. To protect him from such a disaster there are none on his side, male or female, who do not offer their lives nor fail to attack the others everywhere as soon as the music resounds. Whenever anyone took a prisoner from the opposing side, he would bow to him, gently tap him with his right hand, remove him from the enclosure and take his place. Should it transpire that one of the kings was in jeopardy , it was not licit for any opponent to take him: there was a rigorous command to the one who had found him or placed him in jeopardy to make a deep bow and to warn him saying, God guard thee, so that he might be succoured and protected by his officers, or might change his position if unfortunately he could not be succoured. At all events he is never taken by an opponent but hailed by him, kneeling upon one knee and saying Good Day. With that the tournament ended. How the thirty-two personages at the ball joined in combat CHAPTER 24 [The chess ballet continues. The work by Nicolas of Cusa referred to is De Ludo globi. Enyo is the goddess of war. The last paragraph forms the end of Chapter 22 in the manuscript (where it is numbered 23).] The two companies thus set out in their places, all the musicians strike up together a martial strain, most frighteningly as for an assault. We then see a tremor run through the warrior-bands as they tense themselves for the fight: the time has come for the clash when they would be called forth from their camp. As the musicians of the band of the silver warriors suddenly stopped playing, only the instruments of the golden warriors resounded. By that they were indicating to us that the golden warrior-band were to attack. Which they soon did, for with a new musical strain we saw the nymph positioned in front of her queen make a full turn to the left towards her king (as though requesting permission to join battle) and also saluting the whole company. Then, with great modesty, she marched two squares forward and curtseyed to the opposing warrior-band, which she then attacked. Thereupon the golden musicians stopped playing and the silver one began. It should not be passed over in silence at this point that the nymph had turned round to salute the king and his company in order that they should not remain idle. They likewise saluted her back, turning fully round to the left, save for the queen, who turned towards her king on the right. Such salutations were given whenever anyone made a move, and during the whole course of the ball those salutations were returned by each of the two warrior-bands. At the sound of the silver musicians, the silver nymph who was posted in front of her queen marched forth, gracefully saluting her king and all his company; they saluted her back, just as was related of the golden ones, except that they all now turned to the right and the queen to the left. The nymph positioned herself on the second square forward, curtsied to her opponent, stood facing the first golden nymph, with no distance between them as though ready for the fray, except that they strike sideways only. Their companions followed them, both the golden and the silver, intercalating themselves and showing signs of a skirmish, until the golden nymph who had first entered the field slapped the hand of the silver nymph to her left, removing her from the field and taking her place. Very soon, with a new strain from the musicians, that nymph was herself struck by a silver archer. A golden nymph drove him elsewhere. The silver knight entered the field: the golden queen positioned herself before her king. Whereupon the silver king, fearing the fury of the golden queen, changed his position, withdrawing to that of his guard to the right; that position seemed well fortified and well defended. Both of the knights who stood on the left – the gold as well as the silver one – made their moves and captured many nymphs from the other side who were unable to withdraw: above all the golden knight who devoted himself to capturing nymphs. But the silver knight was thinking of more important matters while concealing his enterprise; once, when he could have captured a golden nymph , he let her be, went beyond her and so manoeuvred that he took up position near to his adversaries, from which he saluted the enemy king saying, May God guard thee. The golden warrior-band, being thus warned to succour their king, a tremor rang though them all, not that they could not easily succour him but because, by saving him, they must irremediably lose their right castle-guard. At which the king withdrew to the left, and the silver knight captured the gold castle-guard, which was a great loss to them. However, the gold warrior-band decided to avenge themselves and surround it on every side so that it could neither flee nor escape from their hands. He made hundreds of attempts to get out; his own side tried hundreds of ruses to protect him, but in the end the gold queen took him. The gold warrior-band, deprived of one of their officers, bestir themselves and most imprudently seek means of revenge, laying about them right and left and inflicting great damage among the enemy troops. The silver warrior-band make a ploy, awaiting their time for revenge and offering one of their nymphs to the gold queen, having laid a secret ambush, so that when that nymph is taken the gold knight all but surprises the silver king. The gold knight goes to take the silver king and queen, saying Good day! The silver knight salutes them: he is taken by a gold nymph; she is taken by a silver nymph. Bitter is the battle. The castle-guards come out from their positions to help. All is in dangerous confusion. Enyo has yet to declare herself. Once, all the silver warrior-band break right through to the tent of the gold king and are straightway repulsed. Amongst others the gold queen does great deeds of valour: in one venture she takes the archer and then, moving sideways, takes the silver castle-guard. Seeing which, the silver queen sallies forth and with similar boldness shoots her bolts, takes the last gold castle-guard and likewise one of the nymphs. The two queens battled long, at times trying to surprise each other, at times trying to save themselves and at others to protect their kings. In the end the gold queen captured the silver, but soon after she was herself taken by a silver knight. At that point there remained to the gold king but three nymphs, one archer and one castle-guard. To the silver king there remained three nymphs and the right-hand knight, which explains why they fought on more cautiously now and slowly. The two kings looked forlorn over the loss of their beloved queens; all their thoughts and deeds are directed now to elevating their nymphs if they can to that dignity in a new marriage, to loving them with joy and to giving them certain assurances of being welcomed if they break through to the last row of the enemy king. The gold nymphs push ahead and from amongst them a new queen is made: a new crown is set upon her head and new accoutrements are given her. The silver nymphs follow on likewise; they have only a single row to cross before one of them can be made a new queen, but the castle-guard is watching her and so she stays quiet. When she first appeared the new golden queen wanted to show herself valiant, strong and war-like. She did great feats of arms throughout the field. But while such things were being done, the silver knight took the gold castle-guard who was protecting the skirts of the battle-field. By which means there was made a new silver queen. She too wanted to show herself similarly valiant when she freshly appeared. The battle was joined anew, hotter than before. Hundreds of ruses, hundreds of assaults, hundreds of moves were made by both sides, such that the silver queen clandestinely entered the tent of the gold king saying, God guard thee! He could be succoured by his new queen alone. She made no difficulty about endangering herself to save him. Whereupon the silver knight vaulted about in all directions, brought himself near to his queen and threw the golden king into such disarray that he had to lose his queen to save himself. But the golden king took the silver knight. That notwithstanding, the golden archer defended the king with the two nymphs which remained from all their forces, but eventually all of them were taken and removed from the field of battle. The golden king remained, alone. The entire band of silver warriors then bowed low to him and said, Good day! since their silver king was left the victor. At those words the two companies of musicians struck up a victory strain together. And thus did end that first ball in such great joy, with such pleasant gestures, such honourable conduct and such rare gracefulness that we were all laughing in our minds like folk caught away in ecstasy, and we not wrongly felt that we had been transported to the sovereign joys and supreme felicity of the Olympian heavens. When that first tournament was over, the two warrior-bands returned to their original positions and began to fight a second time as they had previously fought, except that the music was now half a beat more rapid. The moves made were quite different from the first’s. There I saw the gold queen, apparently angered by the rout of her army, aroused by the strains of the music: she was amongst the first of the females on to the battle-field accompanied by an archer and a knight; she all but surprised the silver king in his tent, surrounded by his officers. After that, seeing her enterprise discovered, she skirmished amongst the troops and so troubled the silver nymphs and other officers that it was piteous to behold. You would have said that she was some new Penthesilea, an Amazon thundering through the battle-field of the Greeks. But that scuffle did not last long, since the silver warriors, all a-quiver at the loss of their soldiers yet hiding their griefs, secretly set up an ambush for her consisting of one archer in a distant corner and one knight errant, by whom she was taken and removed from the field. Another time she will act more wisely! She will stay close to her king, never venturing far from him and, when go she must, go otherwise supported. Whereat the silver warriors remained the victors as before. For the third and final ball the two warrior-bands stood as they had done before, and it seemed to me that they wore happier and more determined expressions than on both former occasions. The music was a fifth more rapid and the strains were Phrygian and bellicose such as Marsyas invented long ago. They then began their tournament and joined battle with such a light touch that they made four moves to a bar, together with the appropriate bows and scrapes as we have described above, so that it was nothing but intertwined leaps, capers and curvets as though by tight-rope dancers. On seeing them twirl round on one foot having made their bow, we likened them to a spinning-top which children play with by whipping it round until its twirls are so rapid that movement seems repose, the top appears still and motionless (‘sleeping’ as they put it). And if a coloured dot should figure on it, it seems to our gaze to be not a point but a continuous line (as Nicolas of Cusa notes in an inspired work of his). Then we heard nothing but the clapping of hands and acclamations every time a piece was taken by either side. There is none, even so glum as Cato, be he Crassus the Elder – none such an agelast – not even the misanthropic Timon of Athens, nor even Heraclitus, who loathed the very property of Man which is laughter, who would not have wrinkled his cheeks at the sight of those young warriors, quickly moving to the strains of that rapid music in five hundred diversions, setting forth, jumping, vaulting, cutting capers, curveting and wheeling about together with the queens and the nymphs with such dexterity that never did one obstruct another. The smaller the number that remained on the field the greater our delight at seeing the ploys and ruses they effected to surprise each other as the tone of the music moved them. I shall add that, although this more-than-human spectacle left us dazed, with our minds astonished as we were caught away from ourselves, yet we were even more moved in heart and mind by the strains of the music, and we readily believed that it was by such harmonies that Ismenias stirred up the heart of Alexander the Great (when he was seated at table and quietly dining) to spring to his feet and take up arms. At the third tournament the gold king was the victor. During those balls the dame disappeared unseen.","Rocket, Rampions, Figs, Nose-Smart, Poppy,"

"Le tout fut par icelui proféré avec gestes tant propres, prononciation tant distincte, voix tant éloquente, et langage tant orné et bien latin, que mieux ressemblait unGracchus, un Cicéron ou un Emilius du temps passé qu’un jouvenceau de ce siècle. Mais toute la contenance de Gargantua fut qu’il se prit à pleurer comme une vache, et se cachait le visage de son bonnet, et ne fut possible de tirer de lui une parole, non plus qu’un pet d’un âne mort.","The whole thing was uttered by him with gestures so proper, pronunciation so distinct, voice so eloquent, and language so ornate and very Latin, that more resembled a Gracchus, a Cicero, or an Emilius of the past than a youth of this century. But all the countenance of Gargantua was that he began to cry like a cow, and hid his face with his cap, and it was not possible to get a word out of him, any more than a fart from a dead donkey.","All that was advanced with such appropriate gestures, so clear an enunciation, so eloquent a voice, such elegant language and in Latin so excellent that he resembled a Gracchus, a Cicero, an Aemilius of antiquity rather than a youth of our century. But Gargantua’s behaviour was merely to blubber like a cow and hide his face in his bonnet: it was no more possible to drag a word out of him than a fart from a dead donkey.","In the end he prayed him, that he would vouchsafe to admit of him amongst the least of his servants; for other favour at that time desired he none of heaven, but that he might do him some grateful and acceptable service; all this was by him delivered with such proper gestures, such distinct pronunciation, so pleasant a delivery, in such exquisite fine termes, and so good Latine, that he seemed rather a Gracchus, a Cicero, an Æmilius of the time past, then a youth of this age: but all the countenance that Gargantua kept was, that he fell to crying like a Cow, and cast down his face, hiding it with his cap, nor could they possibly draw one word from him, no more then a fart from a dead Asse; whereat his father was so grievously vexed, that he would have killed Master Jobelin, but the said Des Marays withheld him from it by faire persuasions, so that at length he pacified his wrath."

"– Oui, répondit-il, il est en ce panier emmailloté. » C’était un pigeon pris on colombier de Gargantua, éclouant[10] ses petits sur l’instant que le susdit céloce départait. Si fortune adverse fût à Pantagruel advenue, il y eût des jets[11] noirs attachés ès pieds ; mais pour ce que tout lui était venu à bien et prospérité, l’ayant fait démailloter, lui attacha ès pieds une bandelette de taffetas blanc, et, sans plus différer, sur l’heure le laissa en pleine liberté de l’air. Le pigeon soudain s’envole, hachant en incroyable hâtiveté, comme vous savez qu’il n’est vol que de pigeon quand il a œufs ou petits, pour l’obstinée sollicitude en lui par nature posée de recourir et secourir ses pigeonneaux. De mode qu’en moins de deux heures il franchit par l’air le long chemin qu’avait le céloce en extrême diligence par trois jours et trois nuits parfait, voguant à rames et à voiles et lui continuant vent en poupe. Et fut vu entrant dedans le colombier on[12] propre nid de ses petits. Adonc entendant le preux Gargantua qu’il portait la bandelette blanche, resta en joie et sûreté du bon portement de son fils.","“Yes,” he replied, “he is in that swaddled basket. It was a pigeon taken from the loft of Gargantua, hatching[10] its young the moment the aforesaid celoce left. If unfavorable fortune had come to Pantagruel, there would have been black jets[11] attached to his feet; but for what had come to him well and prosperously, having had him undressed, tied a band of white taffeta around his feet, and, without further delay, immediately left him in full freedom of the air. The pigeon suddenly takes flight, chopping in incredible haste, as you know that only a pigeon is theft when it has eggs or young, for the obstinate solicitude in it by its natural nature to resort and rescue its youngsters. So that in less than two hours he crossed by air the long way that the celoc had in extreme diligence on three perfect days and three nights, sailing with oars and sails and continuing with the wind at his stern. And was seen entering into the dovecote one[12] own nest of her young. So hearing the valiant Gargantua that he wore the white bandage, remained in joy and security at the good behavior of his son.","Pantagruel, after a brief embrace and a graciously doffed bonnet, asked – before opening the letter or addressing any other words to Malicorne – ‘Have you brought with you the gozal, that messenger from the skies?’ – ‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘it is kept hooded inside this pannier.’ It was a pigeon taken from Gargantua’s dovecot, just hatching its young at the very instant that the swift cutter was about to leave. If ill fortune had befallen Pantagruel, black rings would have been attached to its feet, but since all had turned out well for him and prosperously, once its hood was removed he attached a little band of white taffeta to its leg and, brooking no further delay, set it completely free. It at once took to the wing, slicing through the air at an incredible speed, since, as you know, there is no flight like that of a pigeon’s when it has eggs or young, because of the stubborn concern to conserve and preserve its brood instilled into it by Nature; and so it was that in less than two hours it flew back over that long distance which the swift cutter had covered in three days and three nights working extremely hard and using oar and sail with a steady wind astern. It was spotted entering the dovecot to the very nest of its young. Noble Gargantua then learnt that it bore the little white band and continued in joy and confidence because of the good start his son had made.","Yes, Sir, said he, here it is swadled up in this Basket. It was a grey Pigeon taken out of Gargantua’s Dove-house, whose young ones were just hatch’d when the Advice-Boat was going off. If any ill Fortune had befallen Pantagruel, he would have fasten’d some black Ribbon to its Feet; but because all things had succeeded happily hitherto, having caus’d it to be undrest, he ty’d to its Feet a white Ribbon, and without any further delay, let it loose. The Pigeon presently flew away cutting the Air with an incredible speed, as you know that there is no flight like a Pigeon’s, especially when it hath Eggs or Young Ones, through the extream Care which Nature hath fixt in it to relieve, and be with its Young; insomuch that in less than two hours it compass’d in the Air, the long Tract which the Advice Boat with all her diligence, with Oars and Sails, and a fair Wind, had gone through in no less than three Days and three Nights, and was seen (as it went into the Dove-House) in its Nest. Whereupon Gargantua hearing that it had the white Ribbon on, was joyful and secure of his Son’s welfare."

Take a good look at this pool.","Then, picking up a big stone, he went to strike it on its mitre, but the Aedituus cried out: ‘Worthy fellow: beat, batter, kill and slaughter all the kings and princes of the world as you please – by treachery, poison or any other means – or dislodge the angels out of their nests in Heaven: for that, the Popinjay will grant you pardons. But never touch these holy birds if you value the life, well-being and happiness of you, your friends and relations, living or dead: even those born to them hereafter would all suffer for the deed. Consider well that basin.’","Having said this, he took up one of St. Stephen’s Loaves, alias a Stone, and was going to hit him with it about the middle. But Ædituus cry’d to him, Hold, hold, honest Friend, strike, wound, poyson, kill and murther all the Kings and Princes in the World, by Treachery, or how thou wilt, and as soon as thou wouldst, unnestle the Angels from their Cockloft, Popehawk will pardon thee all this. But never be so mad as to meddle with these sacred Birds, as much as thou lov’st the profit, welfare and life not only of thy self, and thy Friends and Relations alive or dead, but also of those that may be born hereafter to the thousandth Generation; for so long thou wouldst entail misery upon them. Do but look upon that Basin."
"Puis fiantait, pissait, rendait sa gorge, rotait, pétait, bâillait, crachait, toussait, sanglotait, éternuait et se morvait en archidiacre, et déjeunait pour abattre la rosée et mauvais air : belles tripes frites, belles carbonnades, beaux jambons, belles cabirotades[4], et force soupes de prime[5]. Ponocrates lui remontrait que tant soudain ne devait repaître au partir du lit, sans avoir premièrement fait quelque exercice. Gargantua répondit :","Then laughed, pissed, gave up his throat, burped, farted, yawned, spat, coughed, sobbed, sneezed and bitten like an archdeacon, and had lunch to beat down the dew and the bad air: nice fried tripe, nice carbonnades, nice hams, nice cabirotades [4], and Force Bounty Soups[5]. Ponocrates reminded him that so suddenly he should not eat out of bed without having first done some exercise. Gargantua replied:","He would then shit, piss, hawk, fart, [break wind, yawn, gob, cough, snivel,] sneeze and dribble snot like an archdeacon, and then – to counteract the dew and the bad air – break his fast with lovely fried tripe, lovely grilled steaks, lovely ham, lovely goat-meat roasts and plenty of monastical bread-and-dripping. Ponocrates raised the objection that he really ought not to have a meal as soon as he got up without first taking a little exercise. Gargantua replied: ‘What!","Then he dung’d, pist, spued, belched, cracked, yawned, spitted, coughed, yexed, sneezed and snotted himself like an Arch-deacon: and, to suppresse the dew and bad aire, went to breakfast, having some good fried tripes, faire rashers on the coales, excellent gamons of bacon, store of fine minced meat, and a great deal of sippet brewis, made up of the fat of the beef-pot, laid upon bread, cheese, and chop’t parsley strewed together. Ponocrates shewed him, that he ought not to eat so soon after rising out of his bed, unlesse he had performed some exercise beforehand: Gargantua answered, What have not I sufficiently well exercised my self?"
Lever matin n’est point bonheur ;,Getting up in the morning is not happiness;,And Magister Tubal (who came top for his degree in Paris) used to tell me that the advantage lay not in running fast but in making an early start: so too the full health of us humans does not consist in drinking cup after cup after cup like ducks but rather in starting to drink early in the morning.,"I am very well after it, and dine but the better: and Master Tubal, (who was the first Licenciat at Paris,) told me, that it was not enough to run apace, but to set forth betimes; so doth not the total welfare of our humanity depend upon perpetual drinking in a rible rable, like ducks, but on drinking early in the morning: unde versus, To rise betimes is no good houre."
