"Il ajouta des clous à ses souliers et se décida à partir. Le coron des Deux-Cent-Quarante ne devait être payé que vers quatre heures.

"Comme Bébert n’était pas admis à ces parties-là, et qu’il recevait une bourrade, dès qu’il voulait tâter de Lydie, il restait gêné, travaillé de colère et de malaise, quand les deux autres s’amusaient, ce dont ils ne se gênaient nullement en sa présence.

"Vers neuf heures, bien qu’il eût reçu l’ordre de renvoyer tout le monde, Hippolyte se permit d’annoncer, Dansaert, qui apportait des nouvelles. Le directeur apprit seulement alors la réunion tenue la veille, dans la forêt ; et les détails étaient d’une telle netteté, qu’il l’écoutait en songeant aux amours avec la Pierronne, si connus, que deux ou trois lettres anonymes par semaine dénonçaient les débordements du maître porion : évidemment, le mari avait causé, cette police-là sentait le traversin. Il saisit même l’occasion, il laissa entendre qu’il savait tout, et se contenta de recommander la prudence, dans la crainte d’un scandale. Effaré de ces reproches, au travers de son rapport, Dansaert niait, bégayait des excuses, tandis que son grand nez avouait le crime, par sa rougeur subite. Du reste, il n’insista pas, heureux d’en être quitte à si bon compte ; car, d’ordinaire, le directeur se montrait d’une sévérité implacable d’homme pur, dès qu’un employé se passait le régal d’une jolie fille, dans une fosse. L’entretien continua sur la grève, cette réunion de la forêt n’était encore qu’une fanfaronnade de braillards, n’en ne menaçait sérieusement. En tout cas, les corons ne bougeraient sûrement pas de quelques jours, sous l’impression de peur respectueuse que la promenade militaire du matin devait avoir produite.","About nine o'clock, although he had received the order to dismiss everyone, Hippolyte allowed himself to announce, Dansaert, who was bringing news. Only then did the director learn of the meeting held the day before in the forest; and the details were so clear that he listened to it while thinking of the love affairs with Pierronne, so well known that two or three anonymous letters a week denounced the excesses of the master foreman: evidently, the husband had caused this police there smelled like bolsters. He even seized the opportunity, he let it be known that he knew everything, and contented himself with advising caution, in fear of a scandal. Frightened by these reproaches, through his report, Dansaert denied, stammered excuses, while his big nose confessed the crime, by its sudden blushes. However, he did not insist, happy to be off the hook so easily; for, as a rule, the manager showed himself with the implacable severity of a pure man, as soon as a clerk passed the feast of a pretty girl, in a pit. The conversation continued on the beach, this meeting of the forest was still only a braggadocio of brawlers, without seriously threatening them. In any case, the settlements would surely not budge for a few days, under the impression of respectful fear which the military walk of the morning must have produced.","At about nine, although he had received orders to admit no one, Hippolyte took the liberty of announcing Dansaert, who had news. Only then did M. Hennebeau learn of the meeting that had taken place on the previous evening in the forest; and the details were so precise that, as he listened, his thoughts turned to La Pierronne and her amours, which were such common knowledge that two or three anonymous letters would arrive each week denouncing the overman’s excesses. Clearly the husband had talked, for the intelligence being imparted carried the whiff of pillow talk. M. Hennebeau even took advantage of this opportunity to convey that he was fully in the picture, going no further than to recommend caution, for fear of a scandal. Nonplussed at being ticked off in the middle of his report, Dansaert spluttered denials and excuses as meanwhile his large nose confessed his guilt by turning immediately scarlet. But he did not protest too vigorously, for actually he was pleased to have got off so lightly; normally the manager was sternly implacable on this subject, quite the man of rectitude when it came to an employee having fun with a pretty girl from the mine. They continued to discuss the strike: this meeting in the forest was no more than another piece of bravado, they were under no serious threat. In any case things were bound to be quiet in the villages for the next few days, given that the appearance of the military that morning would duly have instilled some fear and respect.","Towards nine o'clock, although he had received orders to send every one away, Hippolyte took the liberty of announcing Dansaert, who was bringing news. The manager then heard, for the first time, of the meeting in the forest the evening before; the details were very precise, and he listened while thinking of the intrigue with Pierronne, so well known that two or three anonymous letters every week denounced the licentiousness of the head captain. Evidently the husband had talked, and no doubt the wife had, too. He even took advantage of the occasion; he let the head captain know that he was aware of everything, contenting himself with recommending prudence for fear of a scandal. Startled by these reproaches in the midst of his report, Dansaert denied, stammered excuses, while his great nose confessed the crime by its sudden redness. He did not insist, however, glad to get off so easily; for, as a rule, the manager displayed the implacable severity of the virtuous man whenever an employee allowed himself the indulgence of a pretty girl in the pit. The conversation continued concerning the strike; that meeting in the forest was only the swagger of blusterers; nothing serious threatened. In any case, the settlements would surely not stir for some days, beneath the impression of respectful fear which must have been produced by the military promenade of the morning."

"C’était, maintenant, l’agonie dernière, la maison vidée, tombée au dénuement final. Les toiles des matelas avaient suivi la laine chez la brocanteuse ; puis les draps étaient partis, le linge, tout ce qui pouvait se vendre. Un soir, on avait vendu deux sous un mouchoir du grand-père. Des larmes coulaient, à chaque objet du pauvre ménage dont il fallait se séparer, et la mère se lamentait encore d’avoir emporté un jour, dans sa jupe, la boîte de carton rose, l’ancien cadeau de son homme, comme on emporterait un enfant, pour s’en débarrasser sous une porte. Ils étaient nus, ils n’avaient plus à vendre que leur peau, si entamée, si compromise, que personne n’en aurait donné un liard. Aussi ne prenaient-ils même pas la peine de chercher, ils savaient qu’il n’y avait rien, que c’était la fin de tout, qu’ils ne devaient espérer ni une chandelle, ni un morceau de charbon, ni une pomme de terre ; et ils attendaient d’en mourir, ils ne se fâchaient que pour les enfants, car cette cruauté inutile les révoltait, d’avoir fichu une maladie à la petite, avant de l’étrangler.","It was, now, the final agony, the house emptied, fallen into final destitution. The linens for the mattresses had followed the wool to the flea market; then the sheets were gone, the linen, everything that could be sold. One evening we had sold two cents for a grandfather's handkerchief. Tears flowed at each object of the poor household which had to be parted with, and the mother still lamented having carried away one day, in her skirt, the pink cardboard box, the old present from her husband, as one would carry a child, to get rid of it under a door. They were naked, they had nothing to sell but their skin, so damaged, so compromised, that no one would have given a farthing for it. So they didn't even bother to look, they knew there was nothing, that it was the end of everything, that they shouldn't hope for a candle, or a piece of coal, or a potato ; and they were waiting to die of it, they were angry only for the children, for this useless cruelty revolted them, for having sickened the little one before strangling her.","They had reached their final hour: the house had been completely emptied, stripped terminally bare. The mattress covers had followed the wool stuffing to the second-hand shop; then the sheets had followed, and their linen, anything that could be sold. One evening they had got two sous for one of Grandpa’s handkerchiefs. Tears were shed over each object that the penniless household found it had to part with, and La Maheude still rued the day she had taken along the little pink box, an old present from Maheu, wrapped in her skirt, as though she were taking an infant off to abandon it on someone’s doorstep. They were destitute, and all they had left to sell was the skin on their bodies, which in any case was so damaged and used that no one would have paid a penny for it. So now they didn’t even bother to search for something to sell, they knew there wasn’t anything, that the end had come, that there was no hope of their ever again having a candle or a piece of coal or a potato; and as they waited to die, their only grievance was on behalf of the children, for they were outraged by the pointless cruelty of the little girl being afflicted with illness before she then starved to death anyway.","The emptied house was now in its last agony, having reached a final stage of nakedness.

"Étienne recommençait à parler. La vieille société craquait, ça ne pouvait durer au-delà de quelques mois, affirmait-il carrément. Sur les moyens d’exécution, il se montrait plus vague, mêlant ses lectures, ne craignant pas, devant des ignorants, de se lancer dans des explications où il se perdait lui-même. Tous les systèmes y passaient, adoucis d’une certitude de triomphe facile, d’un baiser universel qui terminerait le malentendu des classes ; sans tenir compte pourtant des mauvaises têtes, parmi les patrons et les bourgeois, qu’on serait peut-être forcé de mettre à la raison. Et les Maheu avaient l’air de comprendre, approuvaient, acceptaient les solutions miraculeuses, avec la foi aveugle des nouveaux croyants, pareils à ces chrétiens des premiers temps de l’Église, qui attendaient la venue d’une société parfaite, sur le fumier du monde antique. La petite Alzire accrochait des mots, s’imaginait le bonheur sous l’image d’une maison très chaude, où les enfants jouaient et mangeaient tant qu’ils voulaient. Catherine, sans bouger, le menton toujours dans la main, restait les yeux fixés sur Étienne, et quand il se taisait, elle avait un léger frisson, toute pâle, comme prise de froid.","Étienne began to speak again. The old society was cracking, it couldn't last beyond a few months, he asserted bluntly. On the means of execution, he was more vague, mixing up his readings, not afraid, in front of ignorant people, to launch into explanations in which he lost himself. All systems passed through it, softened with a certainty of easy triumph, with a universal kiss that would put an end to the misunderstanding of classes; without taking into account, however, the bad heads, among the bosses and the bourgeois, whom we would perhaps be forced to bring to their senses. And the Maheus seemed to understand, approved, accepted miraculous solutions, with the blind faith of new believers, like those Christians of the early days of the Church, who waited for the coming of a perfect society, on the manure of the ancient world. Little Alzire hung up on words, imagined happiness under the image of a very warm house, where the children played and ate as much as they wanted. Catherine, without moving, her chin still in her hand, kept her eyes fixed on Étienne, and when he was silent, she shivered slightly, quite pale, as if caught cold.","Étienne would begin talking again. The old society was falling apart, it couldn’t last more than a few months now, he roundly declared. As to how they were to go about it, he was less specific and quoted various things he had read, undaunted by these ignorant people and launching himself into explanations before losing the thread himself. He drew on every political system there was, each one sweetened by the certainty of easy victory and the prospect of a universal embrace that would put an end to class division – apart from a few awkward types among the factory-owners and the bourgeois, who might have to be brought to their senses. The Maheus listened with the air of people who understood, nodding their approval and accepting these miraculous solutions with the blind faith of new converts, like members of the early Christian Church calmly awaiting the emergence of the perfect society from the dunghill of the ancient world. Little Alzire caught a word here and there and pictured happiness as a lovely warm house where children played and ate as much as they liked. Catherine, her head propped on her hand, just sat staring at Étienne, and when he stopped, she shivered slightly and looked pale, as though she had suddenly caught a chill.","Étienne began talking again.

"Étienne, fiévreusement, excusa les camarades : un homme peut être brave, une foule qui meurt de faim est sans force. Pas à pas, ils étaient revenus au Voreux ; et, devant la masse noire de la fosse, il continua, il jura de ne jamais redescendre, lui ; mais il pardonnait à ceux qui redescendraient. Ensuite, comme le bruit courait que les charpentiers n’avaient pas eu le temps de réparer le cuvelage, il désira savoir. Était-ce vrai ? la pesée des terrains contre les bois qui faisaient au puits une chemise de charpente les avait-elle tellement renflés à l’intérieur, qu’une des cages d’extraction frottait au passage, sur une longueur de plus de cinq mètres ? Souvarine, redevenu silencieux, répondait brièvement. Il avait encore travaillé la veille, la cage frottait en effet, les machineurs devaient même doubler la vitesse, pour passer à cet endroit. Mais tous les chefs accueillaient les observations de la même phrase irritée : c’était du charbon qu’on voulait, on consoliderait mieux plus tard.","Étienne feverishly excused his comrades: a man can be brave, a crowd that is dying of hunger is without strength. Step by step they had returned to the Voreux; and, in front of the black mass of the pit, he continued, he swore never to come down again; but he forgave those who came down again. Then, as it was rumored that the carpenters had not had time to repair the casing, he wanted to know. Was it true? Had the weighing of the land against the timbers which made the shaft a frame jacket swollen them so much inside that one of the extraction cages rubbed along the way, over a length of more than five meters? Souvarine, having become silent again, answered briefly. He had worked again the day before, the cage indeed rubbed, the machine operators even had to double the speed, to pass at this place. But all the chiefs greeted the observations with the same irritated phrase: it was coal we wanted, we would consolidate better later.","Étienne roundly defended the comrades; one man alone can be brave, but a starving crowd is powerless. Little by little they had returned to Le Voreux; and as they reached the black hulk of the pit, he carried on talking, swearing that he himself would never go down the mine again, although he forgave those who would. Then, since there had been a rumour that the joiners had not had time to repair the tubbing in the pit-shaft, he wanted to find out about it. Was it true? Had the pressure of the earth on the wooden casing round the shaft made it bulge so much that one of the extraction cages actually rubbed against it over a distance of more than five metres? Souvarine, who had gone quiet again, replied briefly. He had just been working there the day before, and the cage did indeed catch the side, so much so that the operators had even had to make it go twice as fast just to get it past that spot. But when this was pointed out to the bosses, they all made the same irritated reply: it was coal that was needed, they could do the shoring later.","Étienne feverishly excused his mates: a man may be brave, a mob which is dying of hunger has no strength. Step by step they were returning to the Voreux; and before the black mass of the pit he continued swearing that he, at least, would never go down; but he could forgive those who did. Then, as the rumour ran that the carpenters had not had time to repair the tubbing, he asked for information. Was it true? Had the weight of the soil against the timber which formed the internal skirt of scaffolding to the shaft so pushed it in that the winding-cages rubbed as they went down for a length of over fifty metres? Souvarine, who once more became uncommunicative, replied briefly. He had been working the day before, and the cage did, in fact, jar; the engine-men had even had to double the speed to pass that spot. But all the bosses received any observations with the same irritating remark: it was coal they wanted; that could be repaired later on."

"En bas du puits, les misérables abandonnés hurlaient de terreur. Maintenant, ils avaient de l’eau jusqu’au ventre.

"Étourdi, l’ouvrier se trouva dans un cabinet, meublé de vieil acajou, tendu de reps vert déteint. Et il écouta pendant cinq minutes le secrétaire général, un grand monsieur blême, qui lui parlait par-dessus les papiers de son bureau, sans se lever. Mais le bourdonnement de ses oreilles l’empêchait d’entendre. Il comprit vaguement qu’il était question de son père, dont la retraite allait être mise à l’étude, pour la pension de cent cinquante francs, cinquante ans d’âge et quarante années de service. Puis, il lui sembla que la voix du secrétaire devenait plus dure. C’était une réprimande, on l’accusait de s’occuper de politique, une allusion fut faite à son logeur et à la caisse de prévoyance ; enfin, on lui conseillait de ne pas se compromettre dans ces folies, lui qui était un des meilleurs ouvriers de la fosse. Il voulut protester, ne put prononcer que des mots sans suite, tordit sa casquette entre ses doigts fébriles, et se retira, en bégayant :","Stunned, the workman found himself in a closet, furnished with old mahogany, hung with faded green rep. And he listened for five minutes to the general secretary, a tall pale gentleman, who spoke to him over the papers in his office, without getting up. But the ringing in his ears prevented him from hearing. He vaguely understood that it was a question of his father, whose retirement was to be studied, for the pension of one hundred and fifty francs, fifty years of age and forty years of service. Then it seemed to him that the secretary's voice grew harsher. It was a reprimand, he was accused of occupying himself with politics, an allusion was made to his landlord and to the provident fund; finally, he was advised not to compromise himself in these follies, he who was one of the best workers in the pit. He wanted to protest, could only utter words without sequence, twisted his cap between his feverish fingers, and withdrew, stammering:","Bewildered, Maheu found himself in an office full of old mahogany furniture and drapes of faded green cord. For five minutes he listened to the Company Secretary, a tall, pale man, who remained seated and spoke to him over the piles of papers on his desk. But the pounding in Maheu’s ears prevented him from hearing properly. He vaguely grasped that it was about his father, whose retirement pension of a hundred and fifty francs – due to anyone over fifty with forty years’ service – was coming up for assessment. Then the Company Secretary’s voice seemed to harden. He was being reprimanded, accused of meddling in politics, and there were references to his lodger and the provident fund; in short, he was being advised not to get mixed up in all this foolishness, especially as he was one of the best workers in the pit. He wanted to protest but he couldn’t get the words out, and he stood there nervously twisting his cap in his hands before mumbling on his way out:","The dazed workman found himself in an office furnished with old mahogany, upholstered with faded green rep.

"Les dames, dès lors, se mêlèrent à la conversation. Mme Grégoire s’apitoya sur ces pauvres gens qui allaient souffrir de la faim ; et déjà Cécile faisait la partie de distribuer des bons de pain et de viande. Mais Mme Hennebeau s’étonnait, en entendant parler de la misère des charbonniers de Montsou. Est-ce qu’ils n’étaient pas très heureux ? Des gens logés, chauffés, soignés aux frais de la Compagnie !

Mme Grégoire felt sorry for these poor people who were going to be left with nothing to eat, and already Cécile was making plans to distribute bread and meat coupons. But Mme Hennebeau was astonished to hear anyone talk about the miners of Montsou as being poor. Were they not perfectly fortunate? Men and women who were provided with housing, heating and medical care all at the Company’s expense! Given her indifference to the common herd, all she knew about them was what she had been told to tell others, and this was the version she used to pass on to her Parisian visitors, who were duly impressed. In the end she had come to believe it herself and so felt indignant at the people ’s ingratitude.","The ladies then joined in the conversation.

"Dehors, la Maheude s’étonna de voir que le vent ne soufflait plus. C’était un dégel brusque, le ciel couleur de terre, les murs gluants d’une humidité verdâtre, les routes empoissées de boue, une boue spéciale au pays du charbon, noire comme de la suie délayée, épaisse et collante à y laisser ses sabots. Tout de suite, elle dut gifler Lénore, parce que la petite s’amusait à ramasser la crotte sur ses galoches, ainsi que sur le bout d’une pelle. En quittant le coron, elle avait longé le terri et suivi le chemin du canal, coupant pour raccourcir par des rues défoncées, au milieu de terrains vagues, fermés de palissades moussues. Des hangars se succédaient, de longs bâtiments d’usine, de hautes cheminées crachant de la suie, salissant cette campagne ravagée de faubourg industriel. Derrière un bouquet de peupliers, la vieille fosse Réquillart montrait l’écroulement de son beffroi, dont les grosses charpentes restaient seules debout. Et, tournant à droite, la Maheude se trouva sur la grande route.","Outside, Maheude was surprised to see that the wind was no longer blowing. It was a sudden thaw, the sky the color of earth, the walls sticky with a greenish dampness, the roads lined with mud, a special mud in the country of coal, black as dissolved soot, thick and sticky enough to leave its clogs. Right away, she had to slap Lenore, because the little one amused herself by picking up the droppings on her clogs, as well as on the end of a shovel. Leaving the settlement, she had skirted the terri and followed the path of the canal, cutting to shorten by potholed streets, in the middle of waste ground, enclosed by mossy palisades. Hangars succeeded one another, long factory buildings, tall chimneys spitting soot, dirtying this ravaged countryside of an industrial suburb. Behind a clump of poplars, the old Réquillart pit showed the collapse of its belfry, of which the heavy framework alone remained standing. And, turning to the right, Maheude found herself on the high road.","Once outside La Maheude was surprised to see that the wind had dropped. A sudden thaw was under way: beneath a dun-coloured sky all the walls looked clammy and green with damp and the roads were coated in mud, the thick, glutinous mud of coal-mining regions that looks as black as liquid soot and can so easily remove a shoe. She immediately had to smack Lénore because the little girl was having fun trying to collect the mud on her clogs as though she were digging it out with a shovel. On leaving the village they skirted the spoil-heap and followed the path along the canal, taking short cuts along pot-holed streets and across stretches of waste ground enclosed by rotting fences. There followed a succession of large sheds and long factory buildings with tall chimneys that belched out soot and filthied what remained of the countryside amid these sprawling industrial outskirts. Behind a clump of poplars stood the old Réquillart pit and its crumbling headgear: only its thick beams remained standing. Then, having turned right, La Maheude came out on to the main highway.","Outside, Maheude was surprised to find that the wind was no longer blowing. There had been a sudden thaw; the sky was earth-coloured, the walls were sticky with greenish moisture, and the roads were covered with pitch-like mud, a special kind of mud peculiar to the coal country, as black as diluted soot, thick and tenacious enough to pull off her sabots. Suddenly she boxed Lénore's ears, because the little one amused herself by piling the mud on her clogs as on the end of a shovel. On leaving the settlement she had gone along by the pit-bank and followed the road of the canal, making a short cut through broken-up paths, across rough country shut in by mossy palings. Sheds succeeded one another, long workshop buildings, tall chimneys spitting out soot, and soiling this ravaged suburb of an industrial district. Behind a clump of poplars the old Réquillart pit exhibited its crumbling steeple, of which the large skeleton alone stood upright. And turning to the right, Maheude found herself on the high road."
"Le père, qui s’était accroupi devant le feu, pour sécher plus vite sa nuque et ses aisselles, se contenta d’ajouter :","The father, who had crouched down in front of the fire to dry his neck and armpits more quickly, contented himself with adding:","Her father, who had squatted down in front of the fire to dry his neck and armpits more quickly, merely added:","The father, who was crouching down before the fire to dry his neck and shoulders more quickly, contented himself with adding:"
"Mais une voix vint de l’escalier, dont ils avaient laissé la porte ouverte. C’était la Maheude qui criait :","But a voice came from the staircase, the door of which they had left open. It was Maheude who cried:","But a voice could be heard coming from the staircase, where they’d left the door open.

"Déjà, elle avait rompu les tartines en deux. Le jeune homme, prenant sa moitié, se retint pour ne pas la dévorer d’un coup ; et il posait les bras sur ses cuisses, afin qu’elle n’en vit point le frémissement. De son air tranquille de bon camarade, elle venait de se coucher près de lui, à plat ventre, le menton dans une main, mangeant de l’autre avec lenteur. Leurs lampes, entre eux, les éclairaient.","Already, she had broken the sandwiches in two. The young man, taking his half, restrained himself so as not to devour it at once; and he placed his arms on her thighs, so that she did not see the quivering. With the calm air of a good comrade, she had just gone to bed beside him, on her stomach, her chin in one hand, eating slowly with the other. Their lamps, between them, illuminated them.","Already she had broken the piece in two. Taking his half, he had to stop himself from devouring it in one gulp; and he placed his elbows on his thighs so as to hide his trembling from her. Calmly treating him as simply another fellow-worker, she had just lain down on her front beside him, and with her chin cupped in one hand she was slowly eating her bread with the other. Their two lamps were on the ground between them, lighting them up.","She had already broken the bread and butter into two pieces. The young man, taking his half, restrained himself from devouring it all at once, and placed his arms on his thighs, so that she should not see how he trembled. With her quiet air of good comradeship she lay beside him, at full length on her stomach, with her chin in one hand, slowly eating with the other. Their lamps, placed between them, lit up their faces."
"On hésita. Étaient-ils très sales ? Non, pas trop, et ils laisseraient leurs sabots sur le perron. Déjà le père et la mère s’étaient allongés au fond des grands fauteuils. Ils y digéraient. La crainte de changer d’air acheva de les décider.","We hesitated. Were they very dirty? No, not too much, and they would leave their clogs on the steps. Already the father and mother had stretched out in the back of the large armchairs. They digested it. The fear of changing the air finally decided them.","They hesitated. Were they very dirty? No, not too dirty, and they would leave their clogs on the front steps. Father and mother were already settled in their two large armchairs and digesting their breakfast.

Already the father and mother had stretched themselves out in the depths of their large easy-chairs. They were digesting there. The fear of change of air decided them."
"– Oui, monsieur Négrel… Voici l’homme qu’on a embauché ce matin.","“Yes, Monsieur Négrel… Here is the man we hired this morning.","‘Yes, Monsieur Négrel, this is the man we took on this morning.’","""Yes, Monsieur Négrel. Here is the man who was taken on this morning."""
"En bas, Négrel tapa lui-même trois coups, largement espacés ; puis, il appliqua son oreille contre le charbon, en recommandant aux ouvriers le plus grand silence. Pas un bruit ne lui arriva, il hocha la tête : évidemment, le pauvre garçon avait rêvé. Furieux, Zacharie tapa à son tour ; et lui entendait de nouveau, ses yeux brûlaient, un tremblement de joie agitait ses membres. Alors, les autres ouvriers recommencèrent l’expérience, les uns après les autres : tous s’animaient, percevaient très bien la lointaine réponse. Ce fut un étonnement pour l’ingénieur, il colla encore son oreille, finit par saisir un bruit d’une légèreté aérienne, un roulement rythmé à peine distinct, la cadence connue du rappel des mineurs, qu’ils battent contre la houille, dans le danger. La houille transmet les sons avec une limpidité de cristal, très loin. Un porion qui se trouvait là n’estimait pas à moins de cinquante mètres le bloc dont l’épaisseur les séparait des camarades. Mais il semblait qu’on pût déjà leur tendre la main, une allégresse éclatait. Négrel dut commencer à l’instant les travaux d’approche.","Below, Negrel himself tapped three times, widely spaced; then he put his ear to the coal, advising the workmen to be silent. Not a sound reached him, he nodded: obviously the poor boy had been dreaming. Furious, Zacharie knocked back; and he heard again, his eyes burned, a trembling of joy shook his limbs. Then, the other workers started the experiment again, one after the other: all became animated, perceived very well the distant answer. It was astonishment for the engineer, he still glued his ear, ended by seizing a noise of an airy lightness, a barely distinct rhythmic rolling, the known cadence of the recall of the miners, who are beating against the coal, in the danger. Coal transmits sounds with crystal clarity, far away. A captain who was there estimated that the block, the thickness of which separated them from their comrades, was no less than fifty meters away. But it seemed that we could already reach out to them, a joy burst forth. Négrel had to begin the approach work immediately.","Down below Négrel tapped three times himself, leaving a reasonable space between each tap, and then pressed his ear to the coal, bidding the men be as quiet as possible. Not a sound came, and he shook his head; the poor lad had plainly been imagining it. Zacharie tapped frantically himself, and again he did hear something; his eyes shone, and he was shaking all over with joy. Then the other men repeated the exercise, one after another; and they all became excited as they distinctly made out a response coming from far away. Négrel was astonished, and when he listened again he eventually heard the faintest of sounds, like the waft of a breeze, a barely audible rhythmic drumming that followed the familiar pattern used by miners when they tap out the signal to evacuate at times of danger. For coal can transmit crystal-clear sound over a great distance. A deputy who was there estimated the thickness of the intervening mass of coal at not less than fifty metres. But for everyone present it was as though they could shake hands with them already, and they were elated. Négrel duly gave orders at once to dig towards them.","Négrel, down below, himself struck three blows, at long intervals. He then applied his ear to the coal, cautioning the workers to be very silent. Not a sound reached him, and he shook his head; evidently the poor lad was dreaming. In a fury, Zacharie struck in his turn, and listened anew with bright eyes, and limbs trembling with joy. Then the other workmen tried the experiment, one after the other, and all grew animated, hearing the distant reply quite clearly. The engineer was astonished; he again applied his ear, and was at last able to catch a sound of aerial softness, a rhythmical roll scarcely to be distinguished, the well-known cadence beaten by the miners when they are fighting against the coal in the midst of danger. The coal transmits the sound with crystalline limpidity for a very great distance. A captain who was there estimated that the thickness of the block which separated them from their mates could not be less than fifty metres. But it seemed as if they could already stretch out a hand to them, and general gladness broke out. Négrel decided to begin at once the work of approach."
"Les trois hommes, cette fois, furent du même avis. Ils parlaient l’un après l’autre, d’une voix désolée, et les doléances commencèrent. L’ouvrier ne pouvait pas tenir le coup, la révolution n’avait fait qu’aggraver ses misères, c’étaient les bourgeois qui s’engraissaient depuis 89, si goulûment, qu’ils ne lui laissaient même pas le fond des plats à torcher. Qu’on dise un peu si les travailleurs avaient eu leur part raisonnable, dans l’extraordinaire accroissement de la richesse et du bien-être, depuis cent ans ? On s’était fichu d’eux en les déclarant libres : oui, libres de crever de faim, ce dont ils ne se privaient guère. Ça ne mettait pas du pain dans la huche, de voter pour des gaillards qui se gobergeaient ensuite, sans plus songer aux misérables qu’à leurs vieilles bottes. Non, d’une façon ou d’une autre, il fallait en finir, que ce fût gentiment, par des lois, par une entente de bonne amitié, ou que ce fût en sauvages, en brûlant tout et en se mangeant les uns les autres. Les enfants verraient sûrement cela, si les vieux ne le voyaient pas, car le siècle ne pouvait s’achever sans qu’il y eût une autre révolution, celle des ouvriers cette fois, un chambardement qui nettoierait la société du haut en bas, et qui la rebâtirait avec plus de propreté et de justice.","The three men, this time, were of the same opinion. They spoke one after another, in a sorry voice, and the grievances began. The worker could not hold on, the revolution had only aggravated his miseries, it was the bourgeois who had been fattening up since 89, so greedily, that they did not even leave him the bottom of the dishes to eat. torch. Let us say a little if the workers had had their reasonable share, in the extraordinary increase in wealth and well-being, for a hundred years? We made fun of them by declaring them free: yes, free to starve, which they hardly deprived themselves of. It did not put bread in the hutch, to vote for fellows who then pollinate themselves, without thinking more of the wretches than of their old boots. No, one way or another, it had to be ended, whether it was gently, by laws, by an agreement of good friendship, or whether it was as savages, by burning everything and eating each other. others. The children would surely see that, if the old ones did not see it, because the century could not end without there being another revolution, that of the workers this time, an upheaval which would cleanse society from top to bottom, and who would rebuild it with more cleanliness and justice.","This time the three men were in agreement. One after another they spoke in despairing tones, and theirs was a long tale of woe. The working man wouldn’t be able to survive; the Revolution had only made things worse for him; the bourgeois had been living off the fat of the land since 1789, greedily taking everything for themselves and leaving not so much as the scraps off their plates. How could anyone say that the workers had had their fair share of the extraordinary increase in wealth and living standards that had taken place over the previous hundred years? People had simply told them they were free and then washed their hands of them. Free? Yes, free to die of starvation. There was no shortage in that department. But you didn’t get bread on your table by voting for splendid fellows who then promptly went off and led the life of Riley and spared no more of a thought for the poor than they did for an old pair of boots. No, one way or another it was time to put a stop to things, whether they did it all nice and friendly by agreeing new laws between them, or else like savages, torching the place and fighting each other down to the last man. It would happen in their children’s time if not in their own, because there would have to be another revolution before the century was through. A workers’ revolution this time, a right bust-up that would sort society out from top to bottom and rebuild it on a just and proper basis.","All three men this time were of the same opinion. They spoke one after the other in a despairing voice, giving expression to their complaints. The workers could not hold out; the Revolution had only aggravated their wretchedness; only the bourgeois had grown fat since '89, so greedily that they had not even left the bottom of the plates to lick. Who could say that the workers had had their reasonable share in the extraordinary increase of wealth and comfort during the last hundred years? They had made fun of them by declaring them free. Yes, free to starve, a freedom of which they fully availed themselves. It put no bread into your cupboard to go and vote for fine fellows who went away and enjoyed themselves, thinking no more of the wretched voters than of their old boots. No! one way or another it would have to come to an end, either quietly by laws, by an understanding in good fellowship, or like savages by burning everything and devouring one another. Even if they never saw it, their children would certainly see it, for the century could not come to an end without another revolution, that of the workers this time, a general hustling which would cleanse society from top to bottom, and rebuild it with more cleanliness and justice."
"– Non, je n’ai pas vu votre ami, répondit la veuve Désir. Mais tout est prêt, venez donc voir.","“No, I have not seen your friend,” replied the widow Désir.

"Pour elle, toutes les autorités, tous les patrons, c’étaient des gendarmes, un terme de mépris général, dans lequel elle enveloppait les ennemis du peuple. Et elle avait accueilli avec transport la demande d’Étienne : sa maison entière appartenait aux mineurs, elle prêterait gratuitement la salle de bal, elle lancerait elle-même les invitations, puisque la loi l’exigeait. D’ailleurs, tant mieux, si la loi n’était pas contente ! on verrait sa gueule. Dès le lendemain, le jeune homme lui apporta à signer une cinquantaine de lettres, qu’il avait fait copier par les voisins du coron sachant écrire ; et l’on envoya ces lettres, dans les fosses, aux délégués et à des hommes dont on était sûr. L’ordre du jour avoué était de discuter la continuation de la grève ; mais, en réalité, on attendait Pluchart, on comptait sur un discours de lui, pour enlever l’adhésion en masse à l’Internationale.","For her, all the authorities, all the bosses, were gendarmes, a term of general contempt, in which she enveloped the enemies of the people.

Besides, so much the better if the law were not pleased! we would see his face. The next day, the young man brought him to sign about fifty letters, which he had had copied by the neighbors of the settlement who knew how to write; and these letters were sent to the pits to the delegates and to men of whom they were sure. The avowed agenda was to discuss the continuation of the strike; but, in reality, they were expecting Pluchart, they were counting on a speech from him, to win mass adherence to the International.","For her all representatives of authority, like all bosses, were ‘the men in blue’, a term of general abuse in which she included all enemies of the people. Therefore she had accepted Étienne’s request with delight: her entire establishment was at the miners’ disposal, they could use the dance-hall at no charge, and she would send out the invitations herself if that was what the law required. Anyway, so much the better if the law wasn’t happy! She’d like to see a long face on it! The next day Étienne brought her fifty letters to sign, which he had got copied by neighbours in the village who were able to write; and then they sent the letters off to all the mines, to the men who had been part of the deputation and to others they were sure of. The ostensible agenda was to discuss whether or not to continue the strike; but in reality they would be coming to hear Pluchart, and they were relying on him to give a speech that would lead to people joining the International en masse.","For her, all authorities and masters were gendarmes; it was a term of general contempt in which she enveloped all the enemies of the people.

Besides, if the law was not pleased, so much the better! She would give them a bit of her mind. Since yesterday the young man had brought her some fifty letters to sign; he had them copied by neighbours in the settlement who knew how to write, and these letters were sent around among the pits to delegates and to men of whom they were sure. The avowed order of the day was a discussion regarding the continuation of the strike; but in reality they were expecting Pluchart, and reckoning on a discourse from him which would cause a general adhesion to the International."

"Étienne reconnaissait à peine la haute nef de la recette, qu’il avait vue inquiétante, dans les lueurs louches des lanternes. Ce n’était que nu et sale. Un jour terreux entrait par les fenêtres poussiéreuses. Seule, la machine luisait, là-bas, avec ses cuivres ; les câbles d’acier, enduits de graisse, filaient comme des rubans trempés d’encre ; et les molettes en haut, l’énorme charpente qui les supportait, les cages, les berlines, tout ce métal prodigué assombrissait la salle de leur gris dur de vieilles ferrailles. Sans relâche, le grondement des roues ébranlait les dalles de fonte ; tandis que, de la houille ainsi promenée, montait une fine poudre de charbon, qui poudrait à noir le sol, les murs, jusqu’aux solives du beffroi.","Étienne barely recognized the high nave of the recipe, which he had seen disquieting in the suspicious gleams of the lanterns.

Without ceasing, the roar of the wheels shook the cast iron slabs; while, from the coal thus carried about, rose a fine charcoal powder, which powdered black the floor, the walls, even the joists of the belfry.","Étienne hardly recognized the tall nave of the pit-head, which had previously seemed so sinister in the eerie, flickering light of the lanterns.

The sheets of cast-iron flooring shook beneath the ceaseless rumble of the wheels, and from the coal in the tubs rose a fine dust which turned everything black, the floor, the walls, even the beams high up in the headgear.","Étienne hardly recognized the lofty nave of the receiving-hall, which had before looked imposing in the ambiguous light of the lanterns.

"Au petit jour, lorsqu’il rentra, il retrouva la sentinelle sur le terri. Cette fois, elle le verrait certainement. Il marchait, en songeant à ces soldats, pris dans le peuple, et qu’on armait contre le peuple. Comme le triomphe de la révolution serait devenu facile, si l’armée s’était brusquement déclarée pour elle ! Il suffisait que l’ouvrier, que le paysan, dans les casernes, se souvînt de son origine. C’était le péril suprême, la grande épouvante, dont les dents des bourgeois claquaient, quand ils pensaient à une défection possible des troupes. En deux heures, ils seraient balayés, exterminés, avec les jouissances et les abominations de leur vie inique. Déjà, l’on disait que des régiments entiers se trouvaient infectés de socialisme. Était-ce vrai ? la justice allait-elle venir, grâce aux cartouches distribuées par la bourgeoisie ? Et, sautant à un autre espoir, le jeune homme rêvait que le régiment dont les postes gardaient les fosses passait à la grève, fusillait la Compagnie en bloc et donnait enfin la mine aux mineurs.","At daybreak, when he returned, he found the sentinel on the terri. This time she would definitely see him. He walked, thinking of those soldiers, taken from among the people, and being armed against the people. How easy the triumph of the revolution would have become if the army had suddenly declared itself for it! It was enough for the worker, the peasant, in the barracks, to remember his origin. It was the supreme danger, the great terror, with which the teeth of the bourgeois chattered when they thought of a possible defection of the troops. In two hours they would be swept away, exterminated, with the pleasures and abominations of their iniquitous life. Already it was said that entire regiments were infected with socialism. Was it true? would justice come, thanks to the cartridges distributed by the bourgeoisie? And, leaping to another hope, the young man dreamed that the regiment whose posts guarded the pits went on strike, shot the Company en bloc and finally gave the mine to the miners.","At dawn, on his way back, he found the sentry still standing on the spoil-heap. This time he would surely be spotted. As he walked along, he thought of these soldiers, of these men of the people who had been armed against the people. How easily the revolution would have triumphed had the army suddenly come over to their side! All it needed was for the working man or the peasant in his barracks to remember his origins. This was the supreme danger, the doomsday vision which set bourgeois teeth chattering when they thought about the possibility of the troops defecting. In two short hours they would be swept away, wiped out, along with all the pleasures and abominations of their iniquitous lives. Already it was said that whole regiments had become infected with socialism. Was it true? Would the age of justice dawn thanks to the very cartridges issued by the bourgeois themselves? And as his mind raced with new hope, the young man imagined the regiment deployed to guard the mines deciding instead to support the strike, turning their guns on the Company’s directors, and at last delivering the mine into the hands of the miners themselves.","As he went back in the early daylight, he saw the sentinel still on the pit-bank. This time he would certainly be seen. As he walked he thought about those soldiers who were taken from the people, to be armed against the people. How easy the triumph of the revolution would be if the army were suddenly to declare for it! It would be enough if the workman and the peasant in the barracks were to remember their origin. That was the supreme peril, the great terror, which made the teeth of the middle class chatter when they thought of a possible defection of the troops. In two hours they would be swept away and exterminated with all the delights and abominations of their iniquitous life. It was already said that whole regiments were tainted with Socialism. Was it true? When justice came, would it be thanks to the cartridges distributed by the middle class? And snatching at another hope, the young man dreamed that the regiment, with its posts, now guarding the pits, would come over to the side of the strikers, shoot down the Company to a man, and at last give the mine to the miners."

"Le printemps était venu. Étienne, un jour, au sortir du puits, avait reçu à la face cette bouffée tiède d’avril, une bonne odeur de terre jeune, de verdure tendre, de grand air pur ; et, maintenant, à chaque sortie, le printemps sentait meilleur et le chauffait davantage, après ses dix heures de travail dans l’éternel hiver du fond, au milieu de ces ténèbres humides que jamais ne dissipait aucun été. Les jours s’allongeaient encore, il avait fini, en mai, par descendre au soleil levant, lorsque le ciel vermeil éclairait le Voreux d’une poussière d’aurore, où la vapeur blanche des échappements montait toute rose. On ne grelottait plus, une haleine tiède soufflait des lointains de la plaine, pendant que les alouettes, très haut, chantaient. Puis, à trois heures, il avait l’éblouissement du soleil devenu brûlant, incendiant l’horizon, rougissant les briques sous la crasse du charbon. En juin, les blés étaient grands déjà, d’un vert bleu qui tranchait sur le vert noir des betteraves. C’était une mer sans fin, ondulante au moindre vent, qu’il voyait s’étaler et croître de jour en jour, surpris parfois comme s’il la trouvait le soir plus enflée de verdure que le matin. Les peupliers du canal s’empanachaient de feuilles. Des herbes envahissaient le terri, des fleurs couvraient les prés, toute une vie germait, jaillissait de cette terre, pendant qu’il geignait sous elle, là-bas, de misère et de fatigue.","Spring had come. Étienne, one day, on emerging from the well, had received in his face that warm whiff of April, a good odor of young earth, of tender greenery, of great pure air; and now, at each exit, the spring smelled better and warmed him more, after his ten hours of labor in the eternal winter at the bottom, in the midst of this humid darkness which no summer had ever dispelled. The days were getting longer still, it had ended, in May, by going down at sunrise, when the vermilion sky lit up the Voreux with a dust of dawn, where the white vapor of the exhausts rose quite pink. We were no longer shivering, a warm breath blew from the distant plains, while the skylarks sang very loudly. Then, at three o'clock, he had the glare of the sun which had become scorching, setting the horizon ablaze, reddening the bricks under the filth of the coal. In June, the wheat was already big, a blue green that contrasted with the black green of the beets. It was an endless sea, undulating with the slightest wind, which he saw spreading out and growing day by day, sometimes surprised as if he found it in the evening more swollen with greenery than in the morning. The poplars of the canal were plumed with leaves. Grass invaded the land, flowers covered the meadows, a whole life germinated, sprang from this earth, while it moaned under it, down there, from misery and fatigue.","Spring had arrived. Coming up out of the mine-shaft one day Étienne had caught the full blast of a warm April breeze on his face, a lovely smell of fresh earth, tender green shoots and pure, clean air; and now, every time he came up, spring felt even warmer and smelled still sweeter after ten hours spent working in the eternal winter down below, where no summer sunshine ever penetrated to banish the darkness and the damp. The days were drawing out and by May he was going down at sunrise, when Le Voreux would be bathed in the vermilion light of a powdery dawn and the white steam from the drainage-pump would turn pink as it rose into the sky. No one shivered now. Warm air wafted in from across the distant plain, while way up in the sky the larks would sing. Later, at three o’clock, he would be blinded by the dazzling hot sun, which seemed to have set the horizon ablaze and turned the grimy, coal-stained brickwork red. By June the corn was already high, a bluish green against the blacker green of the beet. It was like a boundless sea that seemed to swell and stretch with every day that passed, rippling in the faintest breeze, and in the evening it surprised him sometimes as if he could distinguish the new growth it had achieved even since morning. Along the canal the poplars sprouted leaves like plumes. Weeds overran the spoil-heap, and flowers carpeted the meadows. As he toiled away beneath the earth, groaning with effort and exhaustion, here were the seeds of life germinating and springing up out of the soil.","The spring had come. On emerging from the pit one day Étienne had received in his face a warm April breeze, a good odour of young earth, of tender greenness, of large open air; and now, every time he came up the spring smelt sweeter, warmed him more, after his ten hours of labour in the eternal winter at the bottom, in the midst of that damp darkness which no summer had ever dissipated. The days grew longer and longer; at last, in May, he went down at sunrise when a vermilion sky lit up the Voreux with a mist of dawn in which the white vapour of the pumping-engine became rose-coloured. There was no more shivering, a warm breath blew across the plain, while the larks sang far above. Then at three o'clock he was dazzled by the now burning sun which set fire to the horizon, and reddened the bricks beneath the filth of the coal. In June the wheat was already high, of a blue green, which contrasted with the black green of the beetroots. It was an endless vista undulating beneath the slightest breeze; and he saw it spread and grow from day to day, and was sometimes surprised, as if he had found it in the evening more swollen with verdure than it had been in the morning. The poplars along the canal were putting on their plumes of leaves. Grass was invading the pit-bank, flowers were covering the meadows, a whole life was germinating and pushing up from this earth beneath which he was groaning in misery and fatigue."
"Et Jean-Bart tomba brusquement à un grand silence. Pas un homme, pas un souffle. Deneulin sortit de la chambre des porions, et tout seul, défendant du geste qu’on le suivît, il visita la fosse. Il était pâle, très calme. D’abord, il s’arrêta devant le puits, leva les yeux, regarda les câbles coupés : les bouts d’acier pendaient inutiles, la morsure de la lime avait laissé une blessure vive, une plaie fraîche qui luisait dans le noir des graisses. Ensuite, il monta à la machine, en contempla la bielle immobile, pareille à l’articulation d’un membre colossal frappé de paralysie, en toucha le métal refroidi déjà, dont le froid lui donna un frisson, comme s’il avait touché un mort. Puis, il descendit aux chaudières, marcha lentement devant les foyers éteints, béants et inondés, tapa du pied sur les générateurs qui sonnèrent le vide. Allons ! c’était bien fini, sa ruine s’achevait. Même s’il raccommodait les câbles, s’il rallumait les feux, où trouverait-il des hommes ? Encore quinze jours de grève, il était en faillite. Et, dans cette certitude de son désastre, il n’avait plus de haine contre les brigands de Montsou, il sentait la complicité de tous, une faute générale, séculaire. Des brutes sans doute, mais des brutes qui ne savaient pas lire et qui crevaient de faim.","And Jean-Bart suddenly fell into a deep silence. Not a man, not a breath. Deneulin left the room of the captains, and all alone, forbidding anyone to follow him, he visited the pit. He was pale, very calm. First, he stopped in front of the well, raised his eyes, looked at the cut cables: the bits of steel hung useless, the bite of the file had left a sharp wound, a fresh wound which gleamed in the black grease. . Then he climbed into the machine, gazed at its motionless connecting rod, like the joint of a colossal limb stricken with paralysis, touched the already cold metal, the cold of which gave him a shiver, as if he had touched a dead. Then he went down to the boilers, walked slowly in front of the extinguished, gaping and flooded hearths, stamped his foot on the generators which rang the vacuum. Lets go ! it was all over, his ruin was coming to an end. Even if he mended the cables, if he lit the fires again, where would he find men? Another fifteen days of strike, he was bankrupt. And, in this certainty of his disaster, he no longer had any hatred against the brigands of Montsou, he felt the complicity of all, a general, age-old fault. Brutes no doubt, but brutes who couldn't read and who were starving.","And suddenly Jean-Bart fell completely silent. Not a worker to be seen, not a breath to be heard. Deneulin came out of the deputies’ room and, all alone, gesturing that no one should follow, he went round inspecting the pit. He was pale and very calm. First he stopped at the shaft and looked up at the severed cables: the steel strands dangled uselessly in the air, and he could see where the file had left its wound, a gleaming sore surrounded by black grease. Then he went up to the winding-gear and stared at the motionless crank-rod, which looked like the joint of some colossal limb that had been suddenly paralysed; he felt the metal, which had already cooled, and its cold touch made him shiver as though he had laid his hand on a corpse. Then he went down to the boilers, where he walked slowly along the line of extinguished fire-grates, now wide open and flooded, and he tapped his foot against the boilers, which sounded hollow. Well, this was it. His ruin was complete. Even if he mended the cables and relit the fires, where would he find the men? Another two weeks of the strike and he was bankrupt. And in the certain prospect of this disaster he no longer felt hatred towards these bandits from Montsou but rather a kind of complicity, as though together they were all expiating the one same everlasting and universal sin. Animals no doubt they were, but animals who could not read and who were starving to death.","And Jean-Bart fell suddenly into a great silence. Not a man was left, not a breath was heard. Deneulin came out of the captains' room, and quite alone, with a gesture forbidding any one to follow him, he went over the pit. He was pale and very calm. At first he stopped before the shaft, lifting his eyes to look at the cut cables; the steel ends hung useless, the bite of the file had left a living scar, a fresh wound which gleamed in the black grease. Afterwards he went up to the engine, and looked at the crank, which was motionless, like the joint of a colossal limb struck by paralysis. He touched the metal, which had already cooled, and the cold made him shudder as though he had touched a corpse. Then he went down to the boiler-room, walked slowly before the extinguished stoves, yawning and inundated, and struck his foot against the boilers, which sounded hollow. Well! it was quite finished; his ruin was complete. Even if he mended the cables and lit the fires, where would he find men? Another fortnight's strike and he would be bankrupt. And in this certainty of disaster he no longer felt any hatred of the Montsou brigands; he felt that all had a complicity in it, that it was a general agelong fault. They were brutes, no doubt, but brutes who could not read, and who were dying of hunger."

"Dans la taille, le travail des haveurs avait repris.

"M. Grégoire, auquel on conseillait de vendre, lorsque ce cours d’un million fut atteint, s’y était refusé, de son air souriant et paterne. Six mois plus tard, une crise industrielle éclatait, le denier retombait à six cent mille francs. Mais il souriait toujours, il ne regrettait rien, car les Grégoire avaient maintenant une foi obstinée en leur mine. Ça remonterait, Dieu n’était pas si solide. Puis, à cette croyance religieuse, se mêlait une profonde gratitude pour une valeur, qui, depuis un siècle, nourrissait la famille à ne rien faire. C’était comme une divinité à eux, que leur égoïsme entourait d’un culte, la bienfaitrice du foyer, les berçant dans leur grand lit de paresse, les engraissant à leur table gourmande. De père en fils, cela durait : pourquoi risquer de mécontenter le sort, en doutant de lui ? Et il y avait, au fond de leur fidélité, une terreur superstitieuse, la crainte que le million du denier ne se fût brusquement fondu, s’ils l’avaient réalisé et mis dans un tiroir. Ils le voyaient plus à l’abri dans la terre, d’où un peuple de mineurs, des générations d’affamés l’extrayaient pour eux, un peu chaque jour, selon leurs besoins.","M. Grégoire, who was advised to sell when this price of a million was reached, had refused to do so, with his smiling and paternal air. Six months later, an industrial crisis broke out, the denarius fell to six hundred thousand francs. But he still smiled, he regretted nothing, for the Grégoires now had an obstinate faith in their looks. It would go up, God wasn't so solid. Then, with this religious belief, was mingled a deep gratitude for a value which, for a century, had nourished the family to do nothing. It was like a deity of their own, whom their selfishness surrounded with a cult, the benefactress of the hearth, rocking them in their great bed of laziness, fattening them at their greedy table. From father to son, it went on: why risk displeasing fate by doubting it? And there was, at the bottom of their fidelity, a superstitious terror, the fear that the million of the penny would have suddenly melted away, if they had realized it and put it in a drawer. They saw it more sheltered in the earth, from where a people of miners, generations of starving people extracted it for them, a little each day, according to their needs.","M. Grégoire had been advised to sell when the share price reached one million, but he had refused with a benign and tolerant smile. Six months later, when the industrial crisis began, the value of a denier fell back to six hundred thousand francs. But he kept smiling and had no regrets, for the Grégoires now believed steadfastly in their mine. The value would rise again; why, God Himself was not more reliable! At the same time, mixed with this religious faith in the mine, they felt a profound sense of gratitude towards a stock which had now fed and supported an entire family for over a century. It was like a private god whom they worshipped in their egotism, a fairy godmother who rocked them to sleep in their large bed of idleness and fattened them at their groaning table. And so it would continue, from father to son: why tempt fate by doubting it? And deep within their constancy lay a superstitious terror, the fear that the million francs would suddenly have melted away if they had realized their asset and placed the proceeds in a drawer. To their mind it was safer left in the ground, from whence a race of miners, generation after generation of starving people, would extract it for them, a little each day, sufficient unto their needs.","M. Grégoire, who had been advised to sell out when this figure of a million was reached, had refused with his smiling paternal air.

It was like a divinity of their own, whom their egoism surrounded with a kind of worship, the benefactor of the hearth, lulling them in their great bed of idleness, fattening them at their gluttonous table. From father to son it had gone on. Why risk displeasing fate by doubting it? And at the bottom of their fidelity there was a superstitious terror, a fear lest the million of the denier might suddenly melt away if they were to realize it and to put it in a drawer. It seemed to them more sheltered in the earth, from which a race of miners, generations of starving people, extracted it for them, a little every day, as they needed it."
"Et elle se livra dans une maladresse et un évanouissement de vierge, comme si c’était la première fois, et qu’elle n’eût jamais connu d’homme.

"Étienne s’était bien douté qu’il ne serait pas commode de faire passer le soldat par le goyot des échelles. Ce fut une besogne atroce. D’abord, il fallut que Jeanlin, resté en haut, laissât glisser le corps, pendant que lui, pendu aux broussailles, l’accompagnait, pour l’aider à franchir les deux premiers paliers, où des échelons se trouvaient rompus. Ensuite, à chaque échelle, il dut recommencer la même manœuvre, descendre en avant, puis le recevoir dans ses bras ; et il eut ainsi trente échelles, deux cent dix mètres, à le sentir tomber continuellement sur lui. Le fusil raclait son échine, il n’avait pas voulu que l’enfant allât chercher le bout de chandelle, qu’il gardait en avare. À quoi bon ? la lumière les embarrasserait, dans ce boyau étroit. Pourtant, lorsqu’ils furent arrivés à la salle d’accrochage, hors d’haleine, il envoya le petit prendre la chandelle. Il s’était assis, il l’attendait au milieu des ténèbres, près du corps, le cœur battant à grands coups.","Étienne had well suspected that it would not be convenient to get the soldier through the ladder channel. It was an atrocious job. At first, Jeanlin, who had remained at the top, had to let the body slide, while he, clinging to the brushwood, accompanied it, to help it cross the first two landings, where the rungs were broken. Then, at each ladder, he had to repeat the same manoeuvre, descend forward, then receive him in his arms; and he had thus thirty ladders, two hundred and ten meters, to feel it falling continually on him. The gun scraped his spine, he hadn't wanted the child to fetch the end of the candle, which he kept as a miser. What's the point ? the light would embarrass them, in this narrow trench. However, when they arrived at the hanging room, out of breath, he sent the little one to take the candle. He had sat down, he was waiting for her in the middle of the darkness, close to the body, his heart beating wildly.","Étienne had realized already that it would not be easy to manhandle the body down the shaft. It was a nasty job. First, Jeanlin had to lower the body from above while he hung from the bushes and guided it down past the first two ladders, where some of the rungs were broken. Then with each new ladder he had to repeat the same manœuvre, climbing down ahead and then taking it in his arms; and there were thirty ladders in all, two hundred and ten metres in which to feel the body continually falling into his arms. The rifle was rubbing on his spine, and he had stopped the lad from fetching his one bit of candle, which he was jealously preserving. What would have been the point? The light would only have been a further encumbrance in the confined space. All the same, when they finally reached the loadingbay, completely out of breath, he did send the boy off to get it. He sat down and waited in the darkness, next to the corpse, his heart pounding.","Étienne had guessed that it would not be easy to get the soldier down the ladder shaft. It was an awful task. First of all Jeanlin, standing above, had to let the body slide down, while Étienne, hanging on to the bushes, had to accompany it to enable it to pass the first two ladders where the rungs were broken. Afterwards, at every ladder, he had to perform the same manoeuvre over again, going down first, then receiving the body in his arms; and he had thus, down thirty ladders, two hundred and ten metres, to feel it constantly falling over him. The gun scraped his spine; he had not allowed the child to go for the candle-end, which he preserved avariciously. What was the use? The light would only embarrass them in this narrow tube. When they arrived at the pit-eye, however, out of breath, he sent the youngster for the candle. He then sat down and waited for him in the darkness, near the body, with heart beating violently."
"Étienne, à la longue, fut repris du malaise qu’il avait éprouvé déjà sur le terri. Pourquoi s’entêter ? ce maître porion le congédierait comme les autres. Une peur vague le décida brusquement : il s’en alla, il ne s’arrêta dehors que devant le bâtiment des générateurs. La porte, grande ouverte, laissait voir sept chaudières à deux foyers. Au milieu de la buée blanche, dans le sifflement des fuites, un chauffeur était occupé à charger un des foyers, dont l’ardente fournaise se faisait sentir jusque sur le seuil ; et le jeune homme, heureux d’avoir chaud, s’approchait, lorsqu’il rencontra une nouvelle bande de charbonniers, qui arrivait à la fosse. C’étaient les Maheu et les Levaque. Quand il aperçut, en tête, Catherine avec son air doux de garçon, l’idée superstitieuse lui vint de risquer une dernière demande.","Étienne, at length, was seized with the discomfort he had already felt on the earth. Why be stubborn? this foreman would dismiss him like the others. A vague fear decided him suddenly: he went away, he only stopped outside in front of the generator building. The door, wide open, revealed seven boilers with two hearths. In the midst of the white mist, amid the whistling of leaks, a stoker was busy loading one of the hearths, whose fiery furnace was felt even on the threshold; and the young man, happy to be warm, approached, when he met a new band of charcoal burners, who were coming to the pit. They were the Maheus and the Levaques. When he caught sight of Catherine in the lead, with her gentle boyish air, the superstitious idea occurred to him to risk one last request.","At length Étienne was overtaken by a renewed sense of the misgivings he had felt up on the spoil-heap. Why bother anyway? This overman would send him away just like all the others. A sudden feeling of panic decided the matter and he rushed out, stopping only when he had reached the building that housed the steam-generators. Through the wide-open door seven boilers could be seen, each with a double fire-grate. Surrounded by white steam and whistling valves, a stoker was busy stoking one of these grates, whose burning coals could be felt from the doorway; and Étienne, grateful for the warmth, was just walking towards them when he bumped into a new group of colliers arriving at the mine. It was the Maheus and the Levaques. When he caught sight of Catherine, at the front of the group, with her gentle, boyish demeanour, some impulse or other made him try his luck one last time.","Étienne was at last seized again by the same depression which he had experienced on the pit bank. What was the good of persisting? This head captain would send him off like the others. A vague fear suddenly decided him: he went away, only stopping before the building of the engine room. The wide-open door showed seven boilers with two furnaces. In the midst of the white steam and the whistling of the escapes a stoker was occupied in piling up one of the furnaces, the heat of which could be felt as far as the threshold; and the young man was approaching glad of the warmth, when he met a new band of colliers who had just arrived at the pit. It was the Maheu and Levaque set. When he saw Catherine at the head, with her gentle boyish air, a superstitious idea caused him to risk another question."
"La Maheude s’était assise de nouveau, muette, le visage immobile. Et elle se remit à attendre.","Maheude sat down again, mute, her face motionless. And she resumed waiting.","La Maheude had resumed her seat, silent and expressionless, and once more she settled down to wait.","Maheude sat down again in silence, with motionless face, continuing to wait."

"Il la regarda, agité d’un léger tremblement, et son visage dur et fermé d’homme de discipline exprima la secrète douleur d’un cœur meurtri. Elle était restée les épaules nues, déjà trop mûre, mais éclatante et désirable encore, avec sa carrure de Cérès dorée par l’automne. Un instant, il dut avoir le désir brutal de la prendre, de rouler sa tête entre les deux seins qu’elle étalait, dans cette pièce tiède, d’un luxe intime de femme sensuelle, et où traînait un parfum irritant de musc ; mais il se recula, depuis dix années le ménage faisait chambre à part.","He looked at her, trembling slightly, and his hard, disciplined face expressed the secret pain of a bruised heart. She had remained bare-shouldered, already overripe, but still radiant and desirable, with her Ceres build gilded by autumn.

She had continued to sit there with her shoulders bare, a woman already past her prime and yet still dazzling and desirable, and with the bust of an earth goddess turned golden brown by autumn. For a moment, no doubt, he felt the animal urge to take her, to roll his head from side to side between those two breasts thus presented for display, here in this warm room with its luxurious, intimate aura of female sensuality and its provocative scent of musk; but he drew back. For ten years now they had slept apart.","He looked at her, agitated by a slight trembling, and the hard firm face of the man of discipline expressed the secret grief of a wounded heart.

"Une clameur monta, les violences recommencèrent. Cette bonne en tablier blanc, menée au marché de la ville voisine dans la voiture des maîtres, soulevait une indignation. Lorsque les ouvriers crevaient de faim, il leur fallait donc du poisson quand même ? Ils n’en mangeraient peut-être pas toujours, du poisson : le tour du pauvre monde viendrait. Et les idées semées par Étienne poussaient, s’élargissaient dans ce cri de révolte. C’était l’impatience devant l’âge d’or promis, la hâte d’avoir sa part du bonheur, au-delà de cet horizon de misère, fermé comme une tombe. L’injustice devenait trop grande, ils finiraient par exiger leur droit, puisqu’on leur retirait le pain de la bouche.

It was impatience before the promised golden age, the haste to have one's share of happiness, beyond this horizon of misery, closed like a tomb. The injustice was becoming too great, they would end up demanding their right, since the bread was taken from their mouths. The women especially would have liked to storm right away into this ideal city of progress, where there would be no more miserable people. It was almost dark, and the rain was increasing, which still filled the settlement with their tears, in the midst of the yelping stampede of the children.","There was uproar at this, and renewed abuse. They were indignant at the thought of that maid in her white apron being driven to market in the neighbouring town in her master’s carriage.

The ideas that Étienne had sown were beginning to take root and grow, burgeoning in this cry of revolt. People were impatient for the promised land, in a hurry for their share of happiness and to reach beyond the horizon of poverty that enclosed them like a tomb. The injustice of it all was becoming too great, and if the bread was now to be snatched from their mouths, they would finally demand their rights. The women especially would like to have launched an immediate assault upon the city on a hill, upon that terminus of Progress where people were poor no longer. Though night had almost fallen and the rain was coming down hard, they continued to fill the village with their tears, surrounded by the shrieking of their unruly children.","A clamour arose, and the abuse began again. That servant in a white apron taken to the market of the neighbouring town in her master's carriage aroused indignation.

Then Étienne returned to the subject of the Belgian workers. He asked Souvarine what arrangements had been made at Le Voreux.

The nervous fidgeting of his fingers across his knees now reached such a pitch that he finally realized what it was that he was missing, the soft, soothing fur of his pet rabbit.","There was silence again. Then Étienne spoke once more of the Borinage men. He questioned Souvarine concerning the steps that had been taken at the Voreux. But the engine-man was still preoccupied, and scarcely replied.

Silencieux, Étienne emporta sa lampe et monta au puits, avec la herscheuse.","At four o'clock the descent began. Dansaert, installed in person at the marker's office, in the lamp room, registered each workman who presented himself, and gave him a lamp. He took them all, without a comment, keeping the promise of the posters. However, when he saw Etienne and Catherine at the counter, he gave a start, very red, his mouth open to refuse registration; then he contented himself with triumphing, with a mocking air: ah! ah! was the fort of forts on the ground? So the Company had some good, that the terrible maniac of Montsou came back to ask for bread? Silent, Étienne took his lamp and went up to the well with the putter.","At four o’clock they began to go down. Dansaert in person had installed himself in the clerk’s office in the lamp-room, where he wrote down the name of each miner who stepped forward and then handed him a lamp. He accepted everybody back without comment, just as the notices had promised. Nevertheless, when he saw Étienne and Catherine standing at the window, he gave a start and went red in the face. He opened his mouth, on the point of refusing to take them on again, but was then content to gloat mockingly: aha! and how are the mighty fallen! So the Company must be doing something right if the scourge of Montsou was back wanting to earn his daily bread? Silently Étienne took his lamp and climbed the stairs to the pit-shaft with Catherine.","AT four o'clock the descent began. Dansaert, who was personally installed at the marker's office in the lamp cabin, wrote down the name of each worker who presented himself and had a lamp given to him. He took them all, without remark, keeping to the promise of the placards. When, however, he noticed Étienne and Catherine at the wicket, he started and became very red, and was opening his mouth to refuse their names; then, he contented himself with the triumph, and a jeer. Ah! ah! so the strong man was thrown? The Company was, then, in luck since the terrible Montsou wrestler had come back to it to ask for bread? Étienne silently took his lamp and went towards the shaft with the putter."

"Trois jours encore s’écoulèrent. On avait repris les travaux de sauvetage, au milieu de difficultés inouïes.

"Mais elle tourna le dos. Qu’avait-il à faire du zèle, ce vendu ? Ça ne le regardait pas, la descente. Ses hommes l’exécraient assez déjà, à son accrochage.

"Il fallait débarrasser les cages, et du reste dix minutes manquaient encore pour l’heure de la remonte. Peu à peu, les chantiers se vidaient, des mineurs revenaient de toutes les galeries. Il y avait déjà là une cinquantaine d’hommes, mouillés et grelottants, sous les fluxions de poitrine qui soufflaient de partout. Pierron, malgré son visage doucereux, gifla sa fine Lydie, parce qu’elle avait quitté la taille avant l’heure. Zacharie pinçait sournoisement la Mouquette, histoire de se réchauffer. Mais le mécontentement grandissait, Chaval et Levaque racontaient la menace de l’ingénieur, la berline baissée de prix, le boisage payé à part ; et des exclamations accueillaient ce projet, une rébellion germait dans ce coin étroit, à près de six cents mètres sous la terre. Bientôt, les voix ne se continrent plus, ces hommes souillés de charbon, glacés par l’attente, accusèrent la Compagnie de tuer au fond une moitié de ses ouvriers, et de faire crever l’autre moitié de faim. Étienne écoutait, frémissant.","The cages had to be cleared, and besides ten minutes were still missing for the hour of the ascent. Gradually, the sites emptied, miners returned from all the galleries. There were already about fifty men there, wet and shivering, under the inflammations of the chest which were blowing everywhere. Pierron, in spite of his sweet face, slapped his delicate Lydie, because she had left the waist before the hour. Zacharie slyly pinched Mouquette, just to warm up. But the discontent grew, Chaval and Levaque recounted the engineer's threat, the saloon lowered in price, the woodwork paid for separately; and exclamations greeted this project, a rebellion was germinating in this narrow corner, nearly six hundred meters under the ground. Soon, the voices were no longer restrained, these men soiled with coal, frozen by waiting, accused the Company of basically killing half of its workmen, and starving the other half. Étienne listened, quivering.","The cages had to be emptied first, and in any case there were still ten minutes to go before it was time for the ascent. Gradually the coal-faces were emptying, and all the miners were making their way back along the roadways. Some fifty men had already gathered, soaked to the skin and shivering, their lungs a prey to the pneumonia that threatened from every side with every draught of air. Pierron, for all his smooth exterior, slapped his daughter Lydie for leaving the coal-face early. Zacharie slyly pinched La Mouquette – for the warmth, he said. But unrest was growing as Chaval and Levaque spread word of the engineer’s threat to lower the rate per tub and pay them separately for timbering; noisy protests greeted the proposal, and the spirit of rebellion began to germinate here in this tiny space some six hundred metres below the surface of the earth. Soon they could contain themselves no longer, and these men who were filthy with coal and frozen stiff from waiting now accused the Company of killing half its workers underground while they let the other half die of starvation. Étienne listened to them, trembling with outrage.","It was necessary to clear the cages, and besides it was yet ten minutes before the hour for ascending.

"Et Chaval fut emporté avec les camarades. Il bouscula Catherine, il l’accusa de ne pas courir assez fort. Elle voulait donc qu’ils restassent seuls dans la fosse, à crever de faim ? car les brigands de Montsou étaient capables de casser les échelles, sans attendre que le monde fût sorti. Cette supposition abominable acheva de les détraquer tous, il n’y eut plus, le long des galeries, qu’une débandade enragée, une course de fous à qui arriverait le premier, pour remonter avant les autres. Des hommes criaient que les échelles étaient cassées, que personne ne sortirait. Et, quand ils commencèrent à déboucher par groupes épouvantés dans la salle d’accrochage, ce fut un véritable engouffrement : ils se jetaient vers le puits, ils s’écrasaient à l’étroite porte du goyot des échelles ; tandis qu’un vieux palefrenier, qui venait prudemment de faire rentrer les chevaux à l’écurie, les regardait d’un air de dédaigneuse insouciance, habitué aux nuits passées dans la fosse, certain qu’on le tirerait toujours de là.","And Chaval was carried off with his comrades. He jostled Catherine, he accused her of not running hard enough. So she wanted them to be alone in the pit, starving? for the brigands of Montsou were capable of breaking the ladders without waiting for the people to leave. This abominable supposition completely unhinged them all, there was nothing more, along the galleries, than a rabid stampede, a race of madmen to see who would arrive first, to remount before the others. Men shouted that the ladders were broken, that no one would come out. And, when they began to emerge in frightened groups into the hanging room, it was a real engulfment: they threw themselves towards the well, they crashed into the narrow door of the ladder goyot; while an old groom, who had just prudently brought the horses back to the stable, looked at them with an air of disdainful carelessness, accustomed to nights spent in the pit, certain that he would always be rescued from there.","And so Chaval was swept along by his comrades. He started bullying Catherine, accusing her of not running fast enough. Did she want them to be left behind in the mine so that they could starve to death? Because those Montsou bastards were quite capable of smashing the ladders before everyone had got out. The voicing of this terrible possibility proved to be the last straw, and everyone around them began to career wildly along the roadways in a mad race to see who could get to the ladders first and go up before the others. Men were shouting that the ladders had already been smashed and that nobody would get out. And when groups of terrified people started pouring into pit-bottom there was a wholesale rush for the ladders, with everyone trying to squeeze through the narrow door to the emergency shaft all at the same time. Meanwhile an old stableman who had wisely just led the horses back to their stall looked on with the contemptuous indifference of one who was used to spending his nights down the pit and was quite certain that some way would always be found to get him out.","And Chaval was carried away with his mates. He pushed Catherine and accused her of not running fast enough. Did she want, then, to remain in the pit to die of hunger? For those Montsou brigands were capable of breaking the ladders without waiting for people to come up. This abominable suggestion ended by driving them wild. Along the galleries there was only a furious rush, helter-skelter; a race of madmen, each striving to arrive first and mount before the others. Some men shouted that the ladders were broken and that no one could get out. And then in frightened groups they began to reach the pit-eye, where they were all engulfed. They threw themselves toward the shaft, they crushed through the narrow door to the ladder passage; while an old groom who had prudently led back the horses to the stable, looked at them with an air of contemptuous indifference, accustomed to spend nights in the pit and certain that he could eventually be drawn out of it."
"– Dis donc, Zacharie ! et toi, Jeanlin, dis donc ! répétait Catherine, debout devant les deux frères, qui restaient vautrés, le nez dans le traversin.","“Say, Zacharie! and you, Jeanlin, say so! repeated Catherine, standing in front of the two brothers, who remained sprawled, their noses in the bolster.","‘Come on, Zacharie!

"Catherine, d’abord, monta gaillardement. Ses pieds nus étaient faits à l’escaillage tranchant des voies et ne souffraient pas des échelons carrés, recouverts d’une tringle de fer, qui empêchait l’usure. Ses mains, durcies par le roulage, empoignaient sans fatigue les montants trop gros pour elles. Et même cela l’occupait, la sortait de son chagrin, cette montée imprévue, ce long serpent d’hommes se coulant, se hissant, trois par échelle, si bien que la tête déboucherait au jour, lorsque la queue traînerait encore sur le bougnou. On n’en était pas là, les premiers devaient se trouver à peine au tiers du puits. Personne ne parlait plus, seuls les pieds roulaient avec un bruit sourd ; tandis que les lampes, pareilles à des étoiles voyageuses, s’espaçaient de bas en haut, en une ligne toujours grandissante.","At first Catherine came up cheerfully. His bare feet were made from the sharp scaling of the tracks and did not suffer from the square rungs, covered with an iron rod, which prevented wear. His hands, hardened by rolling, grabbed without fatigue the amounts too big for them. And even that occupied her, brought her out of her grief, this unexpected ascent, this long snake of men flowing, hoisting themselves up, three per ladder, so that the head would come out into the light, when the tail was still trailing on the bougnou. . We weren't there, the first had to be barely a third of the way down. No one spoke any more, only the feet rolled with a dull sound; while the lamps, like traveling stars, spaced themselves from bottom to top, in an ever widening line.","At first Catherine climbed cheerfully enough. Her bare feet were used to the sharpness of the coal along the roadway floors, and so the protective iron edging on the square rungs did not bother her. Her hands, hardened by pushing tubs, grasped the uprights easily enough even though they were too thick for her grip. Indeed this unexpected climb helped to occupy her mind and to take her out of her misery, as she became one of a long, snaking line of people coiling and hoisting its way upwards, three to a ladder, so long a line indeed that the head of the snake would emerge at the top while the tail was still dragging over the sump at the bottom. But they were not there yet, and the people at the top could scarcely have reached a third of the way up. Nobody was talking now, and the only sound was the dull rumble and thud of feet; and the lamps spaced out at regular intervals looked like an unravelling string of wandering stars.","Catherine at first climbed bravely. Her naked feet were used to the hard coal on the floors of the passages, and did not suffer from the square rungs, covered with iron rods to prevent them from wearing away. Her hands, hardened by the haulage, grasped without fatigue the uprights that were too big for her. And it even interested her and took her out of her grief, this unforeseen ascent, this long serpent of men flowing on and hoisting themselves up three on a ladder, so that even when the head should emerge in daylight the tail would still be trailing over the sump. They were not there yet, the first could hardly have ascended a third of the shaft. No one spoke now, only their feet moved with a low sound; while the lamps, like travelling stars, spaced out from below upward, formed a continually increasing line."
"Dès lors, la conciliation parut impossible. Les cris recommençaient, des bousculades chassaient les hommes du puits, au risque de les écraser contre les murs. Un instant, le directeur, désespéré, essaya de lutter seul, de réduire violemment cette foule ; mais c’était une folie inutile, il dut se retirer. Et il resta quelques minutes, au fond du bureau du receveur, essoufflé sur une chaise, si éperdu de son impuissance, que pas une idée ne lui venait. Enfin, il se calma, il dit à un surveillant d’aller lui chercher Chaval ; puis, quand ce dernier eut consenti à l’entretien, il congédia le monde du geste.","Conciliation therefore seemed impossible. The screams began again, jostling chased the men from the well, at the risk of crushing them against the walls. For a moment the director, in despair, tried to fight alone, to violently reduce this crowd; but it was useless madness, he had to retire. And he remained for a few minutes, at the back of the receptionist's office, out of breath on a chair, so bewildered by his impotence that not an idea occurred to him. At last he calmed down, he told an overseer to fetch Chaval for him; then, when the latter had consented to the interview, he dismissed everyone with a gesture.","Thereafter all hope of compromise seemed out of the question. People started shouting again, and men were shouldered away from the shaft and nearly crushed against the wall. For a moment Deneulin tried desperately to fight the battle single-handedly and to bring the mob smartly to heel; but it was pointless folly, and he was forced to withdraw. So he went and sat for a few minutes at the far end of the checkweighman’s office. The stuffing had been knocked out of him, and he was so dazed by his powerlessness that he could not think what to do next. At length he calmed down and told a supervisor to go and fetch Chaval. Then, when the latter had agreed to the meeting, he dismissed everyone else with a wave of his hand.","After that, conciliation appeared impossible.

"Les quatre haveurs venaient de s’allonger les uns au-dessus des autres, sur toute la montée du front de taille. Séparés par les planches à crochets qui retenaient le charbon abattu, ils occupaient chacun quatre mètres environ de la veine ; et cette veine était si mince, épaisse à peine en cet endroit de cinquante centimètres, qu’ils se trouvaient là comme aplatis entre le toit et le mur, se traînant des genoux et des coudes, ne pouvant se retourner sans se meurtrir les épaules. Ils devaient, pour attaquer la houille, rester couchés sur le flanc, le cou tordu, les bras levés et brandissant de biais la rivelaine, le pic à manche court.","The four pikemen had just stretched out one above the other, all the way up the face. Separated by the planks with hooks which retained the coal felled, they each occupied approximately four meters of the seam; and this vein was so thin, hardly thick in this place of fifty centimeters, that they found themselves there as if flattened between the roof and the wall, dragging their knees and elbows, unable to turn around without bruising their shoulders. To attack the coal, they had to remain lying on their sides, their necks twisted, their arms raised and brandishing the riparian, the short-handled pick, at an angle.","The four hewers had just taken up position, stretched out at different levels one above the other and covering the entire height of the coal-face. Wooden planks, secured by hooks, stopped the coal from falling after they had cut it, and between these planks each man occupied a space of about four metres along the seam. This particular seam was so thin,1 barely fifty centimetres at this point, that they found themselves virtually crushed between roof and wall; they had to drag themselves forward on their elbows and knees and were quite unable to turn round without banging their shoulders. In order to get at the coal they had to lie on one side, twist their necks, and use both arms in order to raise their rivelaine, a short-handled pick, which they wielded at an angle.","THE four pikemen had spread themselves one above the other over the whole face of the cutting.

"Le neuvième jour, à l’heure du déjeuner, Zacharie ne répondit pas, lorsqu’on l’appela pour le relais. Il était comme fou, il s’acharnait avec des jurons. Négrel, sorti un instant, ne put le faire obéir ; et il n’y avait même là qu’un porion, avec trois mineurs. Sans doute, Zacharie, mal éclairé, furieux de cette lueur vacillante qui retardait sa besogne, commit l’imprudence d’ouvrir sa lampe. On avait pourtant donné des ordres sévères, car des fuites de grisou s’étaient déclarées, le gaz séjournait en masse énorme, dans ces couloirs étroits, privés d’aérage. Brusquement, un coup de foudre éclata, une trombe de feu sortit du boyau, comme de la gueule d’un canon chargé à mitraille. Tout flambait, l’air s’enflammait ainsi que de la poudre, d’un bout à l’autre des galeries. Ce torrent de flamme emporta le porion et les trois ouvriers, remonta le puits, jaillit au grand jour en une éruption, qui crachait des roches et des débris de charpente. Les curieux s’enfuirent, la Maheude se leva, serrant contre sa gorge Estelle épouvantée.","On the ninth day, at lunchtime, Zacharie did not answer when called for the relay. He was like crazy, he persisted with swearing. Négrel, who went out for a moment, could not make him obey; and there was only one foreman there, with three miners. Undoubtedly, Zacharie, badly lighted, furious at this flickering light which was delaying his task, committed the imprudence of opening his lamp. Severe orders had however been given, because firedamp leaks had declared themselves, the gas was staying in enormous masses, in these narrow corridors, deprived of ventilation. Suddenly a thunderbolt broke out, a whirlwind of fire issued from the gut, as from the mouth of a cannon loaded with grapeshot. Everything was on fire, the air was on fire like gunpowder, from one end of the galleries to the other. This torrent of flame carried off the foreman and the three workmen, ascended the shaft, burst into the light of day in an eruption, which spat out rocks and debris from the framework. The onlookers fled, Maheude got up, clutching the terrified Estelle to her throat.","On the ninth day, at lunch-time, Zacharie failed to answer when they called to him that it was time for him be replaced. It was as though he had gone mad, and with much cursing and swearing he refused to stop. Négrel, who had left the mine for a moment, was not there to make him obey; and in fact the only people present were a deputy and three miners. Unable to see properly and frustrated by the delay caused by the dim, flickering light from his lamp, Zacharie must have been foolish enough to turn it up. Strict orders had been given not to do so: firedamp had been detected, and huge pockets of gas had been building up in the narrow, unventilated shafts. Suddenly there was a thunderous explosion, and a jet of flame shot out of the shaft like the flash from a gun loaded with grapeshot. Everything ignited, and from one end to the other each shaft caught fire like a trail of gunpowder. The sudden torrent of flame engulfed the deputy and the three miners, travelled up the main pit-shaft, and erupted into the open air, spewing out rock and broken timber. The onlookers fled, and La Maheude leaped to her feet, clutching a terrified Estelle to her chest.","On the ninth day, at the breakfast hour, no reply came from Zacharie when he was called for the relay. He was like a madman, working on furiously with oaths. Négrel, who had come up for a moment, was not there to make him obey, and only a captain and three miners were below. No doubt Zacharie, infuriate with the feeble vacillating light, which delayed his work, committed the imprudence of opening his lamp, although severe orders had been given for leakages of fire-damp had taken place, and the gas remained in enormous masses in these narrow, unventilated passages. Suddenly, a roar of thunder was heard, and a spout of fire darted out of the tube as from the mouth of a cannon charged with grapeshot. Everything flamed up and the air caught fire like powder, from one end of the galleries to the other. This torrent of flame carried away the captain and three workers, ascended the pit, and leapt up to the daylight in an eruption which split the rocks and the ruins around. The inquisitive fled, and Maheude arose, pressing the frightened Estelle to her breast."
"Étienne l’avait saisie et l’emportait. D’ailleurs, il était grand temps, ils montèrent dans la cheminée, trempés jusqu’aux épaules. Lui, devait l’aider, car elle n’avait plus la force de s’accrocher aux bois. À trois reprises, il crut qu’elle lui échappait, quelle retombait dans la mer profonde, dont la marée grondait derrière eux. Cependant, ils purent respirer quelques minutes, quand ils eurent rencontré la première voie, libre encore. L’eau reparut, il fallut se hisser de nouveau. Et, durant des heures, cette montée continua, la crue les chassait de voie en voie, les obligeait à s’élever toujours. Dans la sixième, un répit les enfiévra d’espoir, il leur semblait que le niveau demeurait stationnaire. Mais une hausse plus forte se déclara, ils durent grimper à la septième, puis à la huitième. Une seule restait, et quand ils y furent, ils regardèrent anxieusement chaque centimètre que l’eau gagnait. Si elle ne s’arrêtait pas, ils allaient donc mourir, comme le vieux cheval, écrasés contre le toit, la gorge emplie par le flot ?","Étienne had seized it and carried it away. Besides, it was high time they went up the chimney, soaked to their shoulders. He had to help her, because she no longer had the strength to cling to the woods. Three times he thought she was slipping away from him, falling back into the deep sea, the tide roaring behind them. However, they could breathe for a few minutes when they found the first path, still free. The water reappeared, we had to pull ourselves up again. And, for hours, this rise continued, the flood chasing them from track to track, forcing them to rise ever higher. In the sixth, a respite filled them with hope, it seemed to them that the level remained stationary. But a stronger rise declared itself, they had to climb to the seventh, then to the eighth. Only one remained, and when they were there, they anxiously watched every inch the water gained. If it didn't stop, would they die, like the old horse, crushed against the roof, their throats filled by the flood?","Étienne had grabbed her and was dragging her away. It was high time in any case: as they began to climb the chimney, the water was already up to their shoulders. He had to help her, for she no longer had the strength to hold on to the timbering. Three times he thought he’d lost her and that she was about to fall back into the deep sea of water whose rising tide was still growling at their heels. However, they were able to rest for a few minutes when they reached the first level, which was still clear. But the water soon appeared again, and they had to hoist themselves up once more. And they went on climbing for hours as the floodwater pursued them from one level to the next and forced them ever upwards. At the sixth level there was a moment’s respite of hope and elation when it seemed as though the water had stopped rising. But then it rose again even more quickly than before, and they had to climb up to the seventh level, and then the eighth. There was only one more left, and when they reached it, they anxiously watched each centimetre of the water’s progress. What if it didn’t stop? Were they going to die like the old horse, crushed against the roof with their lungs full of water?","Étienne had seized her and lifted her; it was, indeed, time. They ascended the chimney passage, soaked to the shoulders. He was obliged to help her, for she had no strength to cling to the timber. Three times over he thought that she was slipping from him and falling back into that deep sea of which the tide was roaring beneath them. However, they were able to breathe for a few minutes when they reached the first gallery, which was still free. The water reappeared, and they had to hoist themselves up again. And for hours this ascent continued, the flood chasing them from passage to passage, and constantly forcing them to ascend. At the sixth level a respite rendered them feverish with hope, and it seemed that the waters were becoming stationary. But a more rapid rise took place, and they had to climb to the seventh and then to the eighth level.

"Il y eut un silence. Quand il pensait à ces choses, un vacillement pâlissait ses yeux noirs, la courte angoisse de la lésion dont il couvait l’inconnu, dans sa belle santé de jeunesse. Un instant, il resta les regards noyés au fond des ténèbres de la mine ; et, à cette profondeur, sous le poids et l’étouffement de la terre, il revoyait son enfance, sa mère jolie encore et vaillante, lâchée par son père, puis reprise après s’être mariée à un autre, vivant entre les deux hommes qui la mangeaient, roulant avec eux au ruisseau, dans le vin, dans l’ordure. C’était là-bas, il se rappelait la rue, des détails lui revenaient : le linge sale au milieu de la boutique, et des ivresses qui empuantissaient la maison, et des gifles à casser les mâchoires.","There was a silence. When he thought of these things, a flicker paled his black eyes, the brief anguish of the lesion with which he brooded over the unknown, in his beautiful youthful health. For a moment, his gaze was drowned in the depths of the darkness of the mine; and, at this depth, under the weight and the suffocation of the earth, he saw his childhood again, his mother still pretty and valiant, let go by her father, then taken back after having married another, living between the two men who ate it, rolling with them in the stream, in the wine, in the filth. It was there, he remembered the street, details came back to him: the dirty laundry in the middle of the shop, and drunkenness that stank the house, and jaw-dropping slaps.","There was a silence. When he thought of these things, a pale gleam flickered across his dark eyes, a brief moment of apprehension at the lesion whose unknown consequences he harboured within his young, healthy body.4 For a moment he was lost in contemplation of the dark reaches of the mine; and as he sat there, deep beneath the crushing weight of the earth, his mind went back to his childhood, to his mother, when she was still pretty and game for the struggle, to how she’d been abandoned by his father who’d then come back to her after she’d married someone else, and how she’d divided herself between these two men who had both exploited her, and how she’d ended up rolling in the gutter with them, in all the wine and the filth. His childhood…he could see the street now, and memories came flooding back: the dirty washing in the middle of the shop, the drinking sessions that made the whole house reek, the slaps across the face that could have broken a person’s jaw.","There was silence.

"Elle l’accabla, elle se soulagea, en lui jetant à la face tout ce quelle répétait contre elle, depuis un mois. Filer avec un homme, se coller à seize ans, lorsqu’on avait une famille dans le besoin ! Il fallait être la dernière des filles dénaturées. On pouvait pardonner une bêtise, mais une mère n’oubliait jamais un pareil tour. Et encore si on l’avait tenue à l’attache !

And even if we had kept her tied up! Not at all, she was free as the air, she was only asked to go home to sleep.","She now poured out all her pent-up abuse, throwing in Catherine’s face all the things that she had been saying about her for the past month. Getting involved with a man and her only sixteen, and running off like that when her family hadn’t a penny! You’d have to be the most unnatural of daughters to do such a thing. One could forgive a stupid mistake, but no mother could ever forget a dirty trick like that. And it wasn’t as if they’d kept her on a tight leash either! No, not at all, she’d been as free as the air to come and go as she pleased.

"On y était. Au bout d’un kilomètre, le boyau s’élargissait, on tombait dans une partie de voie admirablement conservée. C’était le fond de l’ancienne voie de roulage, taillée à travers banc, pareille à une grotte naturelle. Il avait dû s’arrêter, il voyait de loin l’enfant qui venait de poser sa chandelle entre deux pierres, et qui se mettait à l’aise, l’air tranquille et soulagé, en homme heureux de rentrer chez lui. Une installation complète changeait ce bout de galerie en une demeure confortable. Par terre, dans un coin, un amas de foin faisait une couche molle ; sur d’anciens bois, plantés en forme de table, il y avait de tout, du pain, des pommes, des litres de genièvre entamés : une vraie caverne scélérate, du butin entassé depuis des semaines, même du butin inutile, du savon et du cirage, volés pour le plaisir du vol. Et le petit, tout seul au milieu de ces rapines, en jouissait en brigand égoïste.","We were there. After a kilometer, the gut widened, we fell into a section of admirably preserved track. It was the bottom of the old haulage road, cut through the bank, like a natural cave. He must have stopped, he saw from afar the child who had just placed his candle between two stones, and who was making himself at ease, looking calm and relieved, like a man happy to return home. A complete installation changed this end of the gallery into a comfortable home. On the ground, in a corner, a heap of hay made a soft layer; on old woods, planted in the form of a table, there was everything, bread, apples, opened liters of juniper: a real villainous cave, loot heaped up for weeks, even useless loot, soap and shoe polish, stolen for the pleasure of theft. And the little one, all alone in the midst of this plunder, enjoyed it like a selfish brigand.","They were there. After a kilometre the passage widened, and they reached a part of the road that was still remarkably well preserved.

Étienne had to stop, for he could see Jeanlin up ahead setting his candle down between two rocks and generally making himself comfortable with the calm, relieved air of a man who is glad to be home. The place had been thoroughly fitted out and turned into a cosy dwelling. In one corner a pile of hay provided a soft bed; some old timbers had been stacked to make a table, and on it there was everything, from bread and apples to half-empty bottles of gin. It was a real robber’s den, full of plunder amassed over many weeks, and useless plunder too, like the soap and polish that had been stolen for the sheer hell of it.

"Quand il rentra au coron, d’ailleurs, des choses graves qu’il apprit lui firent oublier l’aventure. Le bruit courait que la Compagnie consentirait peut-être à une concession, si les délégués tentaient une nouvelle démarche près du directeur. Du moins, des porions avaient répandu ce bruit. La vérité était que, dans la lutte engagée, la mine souffrait pis encore que les mineurs. Des deux côtés, l’obstination entassait des ruines : tandis que le travail crevait de faim, le capital se détruisait. Chaque jour de chômage emportait des centaines de mille francs. Toute machine qui s’arrête est une machine morte. L’outillage et le matériel s’altéraient, l’argent immobilisé fondait, comme une eau bue par du sable. Depuis que le faible stock de houille s’épuisait sur le carreau des fosses, la clientèle parlait de s’adresser en Belgique ; et il y avait là, pour l’avenir, une menace. Mais ce qui effrayait surtout la Compagnie, ce qu’elle cachait avec soin, c’étaient les dégâts croissants, dans les galeries et les tailles. Les porions ne suffisaient pas au raccommodage, les bois cassaient de toutes parts, des éboulements se produisaient à chaque heure. Bientôt, les désastres étaient devenus tels, qu’ils devaient nécessiter de longs mois de réparation, avant que l’abattage pût être repris. Déjà, des histoires couraient la contrée : à Crèvecœur, trois cents mètres de voie s’étaient effondrés d’un bloc, bouchant l’accès de la veine Cinq-Paumes ; à Madeleine, la veine Maugrétout s’émiettait et s’emplissait d’eau. La Direction refusait d’en convenir, lorsque, brusquement, deux accidents, l’un sur l’autre, l’avaient forcée d’avouer. Un matin, près de la Piolaine, on trouva le sol fendu au-dessus de la galerie nord de Mirou, éboulée de la veille ; et, le lendemain, ce fut un affaissement intérieur du Voreux qui ébranla tout un coin de faubourg, au point que deux maisons faillirent disparaître.","When he returned to the settlement, moreover, serious things he learned made him forget the adventure. There was a rumor that the Company might consent to a concession if the delegates attempted a new approach to the director. At least, captains had spread this rumor. The truth was that in the struggle the mine suffered even worse than the miners. On both sides, obstinacy piled up ruins: while labor starved, capital destroyed itself. Each day of unemployment took away hundreds of thousands of francs. Any machine that stops is a dead machine. The tools and the material deteriorated, the immobilized money melted, like water drunk by sand. Since the low stock of coal was running out on the floor of the pits, the customers talked about going to Belgium; and there was a threat there for the future. But what frightened the Company above all, what it carefully concealed, was the increasing damage in the galleries and cuttings. The foremen were not enough to mend, the timbers were breaking on all sides, landslides were occurring every hour. Soon the disasters had become such that they required long months of repair before felling could be resumed. Already, stories were circulating the region: at Crèvecœur, three hundred meters of track had collapsed in one block, blocking access to the Cinq-Paumes vein; at Madeleine, the Maugrétout seam crumbled and filled with water. Management refused to admit it when, suddenly, two accidents, one on top of the other, had forced her to confess. One morning, near La Piolaine, the ground was found split above the north gallery of Mirou, which had collapsed the day before; and, the next day, it was an interior collapse of the Voreux which shook a whole corner of the suburb, to the point that two houses nearly disappeared.","In any case, when he reached the village, news of a serious kind soon drove all thought of the episode from his head. It was rumoured that the Company would perhaps agree to a further concession if the members of the deputation would make a new approach to the manager. At least this was the word from the deputies. The truth was that the mines were suffering even more than the miners as a result of the stand-off. The stubbornness of both parties was wreaking increasing damage: while labour was dying of hunger, capital was bleeding to death. Each day’s stoppage meant the loss of hundreds of thousands of francs. The machine that lies idle is a machine that is dying. The plant and equipment were deteriorating, and the money invested in them was draining away like water into the sand. Since the meagre stockpiles of coal had started disappearing from the pit-yards, customers had been talking of obtaining their supplies from Belgium; and that posed a threat for the future. But what worried the Company most, and what it was most careful to conceal, was the growing damage to the roadways and coal-faces. There weren’t enough deputies to keep up with the repairs; timbering was giving way all over the place, and there were rock-falls almost by the hour. The damage was soon so extensive that it would require long months of repair work before they could start hewing coal again. Stories were already going round: at Crèvecœur three hundred metres of road had subsided in one piece, blocking access to the Cinq-Paumes seam; at Madeleine, the Maugrétout seam was breaking up and filling with water. Management was refusing to confirm the stories when two disasters happened in quick succession which forced them to come clean. One morning, near La Piolaine, they found that a crevasse had opened above Mirou’s northern roadway, where there had been a rock-fall the day before. The next day part of Le Voreux subsided and sent such a tremor under one whole corner of the neighbourhood that two houses had nearly vanished completely.","When he got back to the settlement, he found serious news which made him forget the adventure. The rumour was circulating that the Company would, perhaps, agree to make a concession if the delegates made a fresh attempt with the manager. At all events some captains had spread this rumour. The truth was, that in this struggle the mine was suffering even more than the miners. On both sides obstinacy was piling up ruin: while labour was dying of hunger, capital was being destroyed. Every day of rest carried away hundreds of thousands of francs. Every machine which stops is a dead machine. Tools and material are impaired, the money that is sunk melts away like water drunk by the sand. Since the small stock of coal at the surface of the pits was exhausted, customers talked of going to Belgium, so that in future they would be threatened from that quarter. But what especially frightened the Company, although the matter was carefully concealed, was the increasing damage to the galleries. and workings. The captains could not cope with the repairs, the timber was falling everywhere, and landslips were constantly taking place. Soon the disasters became so serious that long months would be needed for repairs before hewing could be resumed. Already stories were going about the country: at Crévecoeur three hundred metres of road had subsided in a mass, stopping up access to the Cinq-Paumes; at Madeleine the Maugrétout seam was crumbling away and filling with water. The management refused to admit this, but suddenly two accidents, one after the other, had forced them to avow it. One morning, near Piolaine, the ground was found cracked above the north gallery of Mirou which had fallen in the day before; and on the following day the ground subsided within the Voreux, shaking a corner of a suburb to such an extent that two houses nearly disappeared."

"C’était Maheu qui souffrait le plus. En haut, la température montait jusqu’à trente-cinq degrés, l’air ne circulait pas, l’étouffement à la longue devenait mortel. Il avait dû, pour voir clair, fixer sa lampe à un clou, près de sa tête ; et cette lampe, qui chauffait son crâne, achevait de lui brûler le sang. Mais son supplice s’aggravait surtout de l’humidité. La roche, au-dessus de lui, à quelques centimètres de son visage, ruisselait d’eau, de grosses gouttes continues et rapides, tombant sur une sorte de rythme entêté, toujours à la même place. Il avait beau tordre le cou, renverser la nuque : elles battaient sa face, s’écrasaient, claquaient sans relâche. Au bout d’un quart d’heure, il était trempé, couvert de sueur lui-même, fumant d’une chaude buée de lessive. Ce matin-là, une goutte, s’acharnant dans son œil, le faisait jurer. Il ne voulait pas lâcher son havage, il donnait de grands coups, qui le secouaient violemment entre les deux roches, ainsi qu’un puceron pris entre deux feuillets d’un livre, sous la menace d’un aplatissement complet.","It was Maheu who suffered the most. Upstairs, the temperature rose to thirty-five degrees, the air did not circulate, the suffocation in the long run became fatal. To see clearly, he had had to fix his lamp to a nail near his head; and this lamp, which heated his skull, finished burning his blood. But his ordeal was especially aggravated by the humidity. The rock above him, a few centimeters from his face, was streaming with water, large continuous and rapid drops, falling in a sort of stubborn rhythm, always in the same place. It was no use twisting his neck, throwing back his neck: they beat his face, crushed each other, clapped relentlessly. After a quarter of an hour he was drenched, covered in sweat himself, steaming with a hot mist of laundry. That morning, a drop, persisting in his eye, made him swear. He didn't want to let go of his chop, he banged hard, which shook him violently between the two rocks, like an aphid caught between two pages of a book, under the threat of being completely flattened.","Maheu had the worst of it. Up at the top the temperature reached thirty-five degrees; there was no circulation of air, and the suffocating atmosphere was potentially fatal.

But it was the wetness that made life particularly difficult. The rock above him, just a few centimetres from his face, was streaming with water, and large drops of it would keep falling in regular, rapid succession, always landing with stubborn insistence on exactly the same spot. Try as he might to twist his neck or bend his head back, they splattered remorselessly against his face and burst. After a quarter of an hour he would be soaked through, and with his body also bathed in sweat he steamed like a wash-tub. That particular morning a drop of water was continually hitting him in the eye, and it made him curse. He didn’t want to stop hewing, and as he continued to hack fiercely at the rock, his body shook violently in the narrow space, like a greenfly caught between the leaves of a book and about to be squashed completely flat.","Maheu suffered most. At the top the temperature rose to thirty-five degrees, and the air was stagnant, so that in the long run it became lethal. In order to see, he had been obliged to fix his lamp to a nail near his head, and this lamp, close to his skull, still further heated his blood. But his torment was especially aggravated by the moisture. The rock above him, a few centimetres from his face, streamed with water, which fell in large continuous rapid drops with a sort of obstinate rhythm, always at the same spot. It was vain for him to twist his head or bend back his neck. They fell on his face, dropping unceasingly. In a quarter of an hour he was soaked, and at the same time covered with sweat, smoking as with the hot steam of a laundry. This morning a drop beating upon his eye made him swear. He would not leave his picking, he dealt great strokes which shook him violently between the two rocks, like a fly caught between two leaves of a book and in danger of being completely flattened."

"Dans la cheminée, Catherine et Étienne s’attardèrent, tandis que les haveurs glissaient jusqu’en bas. C’était une rencontre, la petite Lydie, arrêtée au milieu d’une voie pour les laisser passer, et qui leur racontait une disparition de la Mouquette, prise d’un tel saignement de nez, que depuis une heure elle était allée se tremper la figure quelque part, on ne savait pas où. Puis, quand ils la quittèrent, l’enfant poussa de nouveau sa berline, éreintée, boueuse, raidissant ses bras et ses jambes d’insecte, pareille à une maigre fourmi noire en lutte contre un fardeau trop lourd. Eux, dévalaient sur le dos, aplatissaient leurs épaules, de peur de s’arracher la peau du front ; et ils filaient si raide, le long de la roche polie par tous les derrières des chantiers, qu’ils devaient, de temps à autre, se retenir aux bois, pour que leurs fesses ne prissent pas feu, disaient-ils en plaisantant.","In the chimney, Catherine and Etienne lingered, while the pikemen slid down. It was a meeting, little Lydie, stopped in the middle of a road to let them pass, and who told them about the disappearance of Mouquette, seized with such a nosebleed, that an hour ago she had gone to soak herself figure somewhere, we didn't know where. Then, when they left her, the child pushed his sedan again, exhausted, muddy, stiffening his insect-like arms and legs, like a skinny black ant struggling against a too heavy burden. They were rolling down on their backs, flattening their shoulders, for fear of tearing the skin off their foreheads; and they sped so steeply along the polished rock all the way behind the lumberyards that they had to hold on to the woods every now and then, lest their buttocks catch fire, they said jokingly.","Inside the chimney Catherine and Étienne lingered for a moment as the four hewers slid down to the bottom. They had chanced on little Lydie, who had stopped in the middle of her road to let them pass and was now telling them how La Mouquette had been absent for an hour after having such a bad nose-bleed that she’d had to go off to wash her face. After they had gone, the child, exhausted and covered in grime, returned to pushing her tub, straining forward with her matchstick arms and legs like some thin black ant struggling with a load that is too big for it. Meanwhile Catherine and Étienne slithered down the chimney on their backs, pressing their shoulders flat so as not to graze their foreheads; and such was the speed of their descent down the rock-face, worn smooth by every backside in the mine, that from time to time they had to catch on to the timbering to slow themselves – so their bums didn’t catch fire, they jokingly said.","At the chimney Catherine and Étienne were delayed while the pikemen slid down.

Then, when they left her, the child began again to push her tram, weary and muddy, stiffening her insect-like arms and legs like a lean black ant struggling with a load that was too heavy for it. They let themselves down on their backs, flattening their shoulders for fear of taking the skin off their foreheads, and they slipped so fast down the rocky slope, polished by all the rumps of the workers, that they were obliged from time to time to hold on to the woodwork, so that their backsides should not catch fire, as they said jokingly."
"Cependant, à côté du feu, le lavage commençait, dans une moitié de tonneau, transformée en baquet. Catherine, qui passait la première, l’avait empli d’eau tiède ; et elle se déshabillait tranquillement, ôtait son béguin, sa veste, sa culotte, jusqu’à sa chemise, habituée à cela depuis l’âge de huit ans, ayant grandi sans y voir du mal. Elle se tourna seulement, le ventre au feu, puis se frotta vigoureusement avec du savon noir. Personne ne la regardait, Lénore et Henri eux-mêmes n’avaient plus la curiosité de voir comment elle était faite. Quand elle fut propre, elle monta toute nue l’escalier, laissant sa chemise mouillée et ses autres vêtements, en tas, sur le carreau. Mais une querelle éclatait entre les deux frères : Jeanlin s’était hâté de sauter dans le baquet, sous le prétexte que Zacharie mangeait encore ; et celui-ci le bousculait, réclamait son tour, criait que s’il était assez gentil pour permettre à Catherine de se tremper d’abord, il ne voulait pas avoir la rinçure des galopins, d’autant plus que, lorsque celui-ci avait passé dans l’eau, on pouvait en remplir les encriers de l’école. Ils finirent par se laver ensemble, tournés également vers le feu, et ils s’entraidèrent même, ils se frottèrent le dos. Puis, comme leur sœur, ils disparurent dans l’escalier, tout nus.","However, next to the fire, the washing began, in half a barrel, transformed into a tub. Catherine, who went first, had filled it with lukewarm water; and she undressed quietly, took off her bonnet, her jacket, her panties, even her shirt, accustomed to this since the age of eight, having grown up without seeing any harm in it. She only turned, her stomach on the fire, then rubbed herself vigorously with black soap. No one looked at it, Lénore and Henri themselves no longer had the curiosity to see how it was made. When she was clean she went up the stairs stark naked, leaving her wet shirt and other clothes in a heap on the floor. But a quarrel broke out between the two brothers: Jeanlin had hastened to jump into the tub, on the pretext that Zacharie was still eating; and the latter jostled him, demanded his turn, shouted that if he was nice enough to allow Catherine to get wet first, he did not want to have the rinsing of the urchins, especially since, when this one had passed through the water, we could fill the inkwells of the school with it. They ended up washing together, also facing the fire, and they even helped each other, they rubbed their backs. Then, like their sister, they disappeared down the stairs, stark naked.","Meanwhile beside the fire the ablutions began, in a half-barrel that had been turned into a bath-tub. Catherine, who went first, had filled it with warm water; and she calmly undressed, removing her cap, her jacket, her trousers and finally her shirt, just as she had since she was eight years old and having grown up to see no harm in it. She would simply turn away and, with her front towards the fire, rub herself vigorously with black soap. Nobody took any notice of her, even Lénore and Henri were no longer curious to see how she was shaped. Once she was clean she went upstairs completely naked, leaving her wet shirt and the rest of her clothes in a heap on the floor. But then a quarrel broke out between the two brothers. Jeanlin had quickly jumped into the tub, on the grounds that Zacharie was still eating; and now his brother was shoving him out of the way, claiming that it was his turn and shouting that just because he was kind enough to let Catherine get washed first, that didn’t mean he was going to wash in the dirty water left by little boys, especially as you could have filled every inkwell in the school each time this particular little boy had been in it. Eventually they had a bath together, also facing the fire, and they even helped each other get clean and rubbed each other’s backs. Then, like their sister, they disappeared upstairs completely naked.","In the meanwhile, beside the fire, they began to wash themselves in the half of a barrel transformed into a tub. Catherine, whose turn came first, had filled it with warm water; and she undressed herself tranquilly, took off her cap, her jacket, her breeches, and even her chemise, habituated to this since the age of eight, having grown up without seeing any harm in it. She only turned with her stomach to the fire, then rubbed herself vigorously with black soap. No one looked at her, even Lénore and Henri were no longer inquisitive to see how she was made. When she was clean she went up the stairs quite naked, leaving her damp chemise and other garments in a heap on the floor. But a quarrel broke out between the two brothers: Jeanlin had hastened to jump into the tub under the pretence that Zacharie was still eating; and the latter hustled him, claiming his turn, and calling out that he was polite enough to allow Catherine to wash herself first, but he did not wish to have the rinsings of the young urchins, all the less since, when Jeanlin had been in, it would do to fill the school ink-pots. They ended by washing themselves together, also turning towards the fire, and they even helped each other, rubbing one another's backs. Then, like their sister, they disappeared up the staircase naked."

"Du côté de Marchiennes, la route déroulait ses deux lieues de pavé, qui filaient droit comme un ruban trempé de cambouis, entre les terres rougeâtres. Mais, de l’autre côté, elle descendait en lacet au travers de Montsou, bâti sur la pente d’une large ondulation de la plaine. Ces routes du Nord, tirées au cordeau entre des villes manufacturières, allant avec des courbes douces, des montées lentes, se bâtissent peu à peu, tendent à ne faire d’un département qu’une cité travailleuse. Les petites maisons de briques, peinturlurées pour égayer le climat, les unes jaunes, les autres bleues, d’autres noires, celles-ci sans doute afin d’arriver tout de suite au noir final, dévalaient à droite et à gauche, en serpentant jusqu’au bas de la pente. Quelques grands pavillons à deux étages, des habitations de chefs d’usines, trouaient la ligne pressée des étroites façades. Une église, également en briques, ressemblait à un nouveau modèle de haut fourneau, avec son clocher carré, sali déjà par les poussières volantes du charbon. Et, parmi les sucreries, les corderies, les minoteries, ce qui dominait, c’étaient les bals, les estaminets, les débits de bière, si nombreux, que, sur mille maisons, il y avait plus de cinq cents cabarets.","On the Marchiennes side, the road unrolled its two leagues of cobblestones, which ran straight like a ribbon soaked in oil, between the reddish earth. But, on the other side, it twisted down through Montsou, built on the slope of a wide undulation in the plain. These roads of the North, drawn with the line between manufacturing cities, going with soft curves, slow ascents, are built little by little, tend to make of a department only a working city. The small brick houses, painted to brighten up the climate, some yellow, others blue, others black, these no doubt in order to arrive immediately at the final black, descended to the right and to the left, meandering down the slope. A few large two-storey pavilions, the dwellings of factory managers, pierced the tight line of the narrow facades. A church, also in brick, looked like a new model of a blast furnace, with its square steeple, already soiled by flying coal dust. And, among the sugar factories, the rope factories, the mills, what dominated were the balls, the estaminets, the beer shops, so numerous that, out of a thousand houses, there were more than five hundred cabarets.","In one direction the road ran dead straight towards Marchiennes, two leagues of paved cobblestone road unravelling across the reddish earth like a ribbon dipped in engine-grease. But in the opposite direction it zigzagged its way down through Montsou, which had been built on the side of a broad slope in the plain. In the Département du Nord there has been a steady proliferation of roads of this kind, which are designed to proceed directly from one manufacturing town to the next, pushing forward in smooth curves and gentle gradients, and all the while turning the entire Département into one big industrial city. To the right and left of the road as it wound its way down to the bottom stood little brick houses that had been painted in bright colours to make up for the dreary climate; some were yellow, some blue, others black, these latter no doubt by way of immediate anticipation of their eventual and inevitable hue. One or two large detached two-storey houses, occupied by factory managers, interrupted the serried rows of narrow house-fronts. A church, also built in brick, looked like the latest design for a blast-furnace, and its square tower was already filthy from the soot that flew about. But among all the sugar-refineries and the rope-works and the flour-mills what really caught the eye was the number of dance-halls, taverns and beer-shops, which were so plentiful that there were over five hundred of them to every thousand houses.","On the Marchiennes side the road unrolled its two leagues of pavement, which stretched straight as a ribbon soaked in cart grease between the reddish fields. But on the other side it went winding down through Montsou, which was built on the slope of a large undulation in the plain. These roads in the Nord, drawn like a string between manufacturing towns, with their slight curves, their slow ascents, gradually get lined with houses and tend to make the department one laborious city. The little brick houses, daubed over to enliven the climate, some yellow, others blue, others black--the last, no doubt, in order to reach at once their final shade--went serpentining down to right and to left to the bottom of the slope. A few large two-storied villas, the dwellings of the heads of the workshops, made gaps in the serried line of narrow facades. A church, also of brick, looked like a new model of a large furnace, with its square tower already stained by the floating coal dust. And amid the sugar works, the rope works, and the flour mills, there stood out ballrooms, restaurants, and beer-shops, which were so numerous that to every thousand houses there were more than five hundred inns."

"C’était en effet, dans le pays entier, un long retentissement de ruines. La nuit, lorsqu’il errait par la campagne noire, ainsi qu’un loup hors de son bois, il croyait entendre les effondrements des faillites, d’un bout de la plaine à l’autre. Il ne longeait plus, au bord des chemins, que des usines fermées, mortes, dont les bâtiments pourrissaient sous le ciel blafard. Les sucreries surtout avaient souffert ; la sucrerie Hoton, la sucrerie Fauvelle, après avoir réduit le nombre de leurs ouvriers, venaient de crouler tour à tour. À la minoterie Dutilleul, la dernière meule s’était arrêtée le deuxième samedi du mois, et la corderie Bleuze pour les câbles de mine se trouvait définitivement tuée par le chômage. Du côté de Marchiennes, la situation s’aggravait chaque jour : tous les feux éteints à la verrerie Gagebois, des renvois continuels aux ateliers de construction Sonneville, un seul des trois hauts fourneaux des Forges allumé, pas une batterie des fours à coke ne brûlant à l’horizon. La grève des charbonniers de Montsou, née de la crise industrielle qui empirait depuis deux ans, l’avait accrue, en précipitant la débâcle. Aux causes de souffrance, l’arrêt des commandes de l’Amérique, l’engorgement des capitaux immobilisés dans un excès de production, se joignait maintenant le manque imprévu de la houille, pour les quelques chaudières qui chauffaient encore ; et, là, était l’agonie suprême, ce pain des machines que les puits ne fournissaient plus. Effrayée devant le malaise général, la Compagnie, en diminuant son extraction et en affamant ses mineurs, s’était fatalement trouvée, dès la fin de décembre, sans un morceau de charbon sur le carreau de ses fosses. Tout se tenait, le fléau soufflait de loin, une chute en entraînait une autre, les industries se culbutaient en s’écrasant, dans une série si rapide de catastrophes, que les contrecoups retentissaient jusqu’au fond des cités voisines, Lille, Douai, Valenciennes, où les banquiers en fuite ruinaient des familles.","It was indeed, in the whole country, a long resounding of ruins. At night, when he wandered through the dark countryside, like a wolf out of his wood, he thought he heard the collapse of bankruptcies, from one end of the plain to the other. Along the roadsides, all he passed were closed, dead factories, whose buildings rotted under the pallid sky. The sweetmeats especially had suffered; the Hoton sugar factory, the Fauvelle sugar factory, after having reduced the number of their workmen, had just crumbled in turn. At the Dutilleul flour mill, the last millstone had stopped on the second Saturday of the month, and the Bleuze rope factory for mine cables was definitively killed by unemployment. On the Marchiennes side, the situation worsened every day: all the fires extinguished at the Gagebois glass factory, continual referrals to the Sonneville construction workshops, only one of the three Forges blast furnaces lit, not a battery of coke ovens burning on the horizon. The Montsou coal workers' strike, born of the industrial crisis which had been worsening for two years, had increased it, precipitating the debacle. To the causes of suffering, the cessation of orders from America, the engorgement of capital immobilized in an excess of production, was now added the unforeseen lack of coal, for the few boilers which were still burning; and there lay the supreme agony, that bread of the machines which the wells no longer supplied. Frightened by the general malaise, the Company, by reducing its extraction and starving its miners, had inevitably found itself, from the end of December, without a piece of coal on the floor of its pits. Everything held together, the scourge blew from afar, one fall led to another, the industries tumbled and crashed, in a series of catastrophes so rapid that the repercussions resounded to the depths of the neighboring cities, Lille, Douai, Valenciennes, where fleeing bankers ruined families.","And indeed news of ruin after ruin was now reverberating across the whole region. At night, as he roamed the dark countryside like a wolf that has left the shelter of its wood, he could almost hear the companies collapsing from one end of the plain to the other. Along the roadsides he was continually passing empty, lifeless factories whose buildings stood rotting beneath a pale, ghostly sky. The sugar-refineries had suffered particularly; Hoton and Fauvelle, having both reduced their workforces, had just gone bust one after the other. At the Dutilleul flour-mills the last grindstone had stopped turning on the second Saturday of the month, and the Bleuze rope-works, which made cables for the pits, had been been brought down once and for all by the halt in production. Around Marchiennes the situation was daily getting worse: not one furnace operating at the Gagebois glass factory, continual lay-offs at the Sonneville construction works, only one of the three blast-furnaces at Les Forges still functioning, and not a single battery of coke-ovens was to be seen burning on the horizon. The strike by the Montsou miners, itself the result of the industrial crisis which had been worsening for the past two years, had in turn exacerbated that crisis by precipitating this widespread bankruptcy. To the several causes of this painful predicament – the lack of orders from America, the fact that so much capital was tied up in excess production capacity – was now added an unforeseen lack of coal to fuel the few boilers that were still functioning; and this was the final agony, machines deprived of their sustenance because the pits themselves were no longer supplying it. Alarmed by the poor economic outlook, the Company had reduced output and starved its workers, with the inevitable result that since the end of December it had not had a single lump of coal in any of its pit-yards. It was a case of chain reaction: the problems began far away, one collapse led to another, industries knocked each other over as they fell, and all in such a rapid series of disasters that the effects could be felt as close as the neighbouring towns and cities of Lille, Douai and Valenciennes, where whole families were being ruined by bankers calling in their loans.","Throughout the entire country, in fact, there was nothing but a long echo of ruin. At night, when he wandered through the black country, like a wolf who has come out of his forest, he seemed to hear the crash of bankruptcies from one end of the plain to the other. He now passed by the roadside nothing but closed dead workshops, becoming rotten beneath the dull sky. The sugar works had especially suffered: the Hoton sugar works, the Fauvelle works, after having reduced the number of their hands, had come to grief one after the other. At the Dutilleul flour works the last mill had stopped on the second Saturday of the month, and the Bleuze rope works, for mine cables, had been quite ruined by the strike. On the Marchiennes side the situation was growing worse every day. All the fires were out the Gagebois glass works, men were continually being sent away from the Sonneville workshops, only one of the three blast furnaces of the Forges was alight, and not one battery of coke ovens was burning on the horizon. The strike of the Montsou colliers, born of the industrial crisis which had been growing worse for two years, had increased it and precipitated the downfall. To the other causes of suffering--the stoppage of orders from America, and the engorgement of invested capital in excessive production--was now added the unforeseen lack of coal for the few furnaces which were still kept up; and that was the supreme agony, this engine bread which the pits no longer furnished. Frightened by the general anxiety, the Company, by diminishing its output and starving its miners, inevitably found itself at the end of December without a fragment of coal at the surface of its pits. Everything held together, the plague blew from afar, one fall led to another; the industries tumbled each other over as they fell, in so rapid a series of catastrophes that the shocks echoed in the midst of the neighbouring cities, Lille, Douai, Valenciennes, where absconding bankers were bringing ruin on whole families."
"La caisse était une petite pièce rectangulaire, séparée en deux par un grillage. Sur les bancs, le long des murs, cinq ou six mineurs attendaient ; tandis que le caissier, aidé d’un commis, en payait un autre, debout devant le guichet, sa casquette à la main. Au-dessus du banc de gauche, une affiche jaune se trouvait collée, toute fraîche dans le gris enfumé des plâtres ; et c’était là que, depuis le matin, défilaient continuellement des hommes. Ils entraient par deux ou par trois, restaient plantés, puis s’en allaient sans un mot, avec une secousse des épaules, comme si on leur eût cassé l’échine.","The box was a small rectangular room, separated in two by a fence. On the benches, along the walls, five or six miners were waiting; while the cashier, aided by a clerk, paid another, standing in front of the counter, his cap in his hand. Above the bench on the left, a yellow poster was stuck up, quite fresh in the smoky gray of the plaster; and it was there that, since morning, men had been continually filing past. They entered in twos or threes, remained planted, then left without a word, with a jerk of the shoulders, as if their spines had been broken.","The cashier’s office was a small rectangular room, divided in two by a grille. Five or six miners were waiting on the benches along the wall, while the cashier, assisted by a clerk, was paying another miner, who was standing, cap in hand, at his window. Above the bench on the left a yellow notice had recently been posted, fresh and clean against the grey, smoke-stained plaster; and all day long the men had been filing past it. They would arrive in their twos and threes, stand looking at it for a while, and then silently leave with a sudden sag of the shoulders, as though this was the final straw.","The counting-house was a small rectangular room, divided in two by a grating.

"Étienne se demandait justement quel était ce bruit d’averse. Quelques grosses gouttes avaient d’abord sonné sur le toit de la cage, comme au début d’une ondée ; et, maintenant, la pluie augmentait, ruisselait, se changeait en un véritable déluge. Sans doute, la toiture était trouée, car un filet d’eau, coulant sur son épaule, le trempait jusqu’à la chair. Le froid devenait glacial, on enfonçait dans une humidité noire, lorsqu’on traversa un rapide éblouissement, la vision d’une caverne où des hommes s’agitaient, à la lueur d’un éclair. Déjà, on retombait au néant.","Étienne was just wondering what the sound of the downpour was. A few large drops had first sounded on the roof of the cage, as at the beginning of a shower; and now the rain was increasing, streaming, changing into a veritable deluge.

The cold was becoming icy, we were sinking in a black humidity, when we crossed a rapid glare, the vision of a cave where men were moving, by the light of a flash of lightning. Already, we were falling back into nothingness.","Étienne had indeed just begun to wonder why it sounded as though it were raining. At first a few heavy drops of water had splattered on to the cage roof, as though a shower were beginning; and now the rain was falling faster, streaming down in a veritable deluge. Presumably the roof must have had a hole in it because a trickle of water had landed on his shoulder and soaked him to the skin. It was becoming icy cold, and they were plunging down into the damp and the dark when suddenly they passed through a blaze of light and caught a flashing glimpse of a cave with men moving about. Already they had resumed their descent into the void.","Étienne was, in fact, now asking himself the meaning of this noise of falling rain. A few large drops had at first sounded on the roof of the cage, like the beginning of a shower, and now the rain increased, streaming down, becoming at last a deluge.

The cold became icy. and they were buried in black humidity, when they passed through a sudden flash of light, the vision of a cavern in which men were moving. But already they had fallen back into darkness."

"Dès lors, Négrel remua la poussière des archives, et quand il eut découvert les anciens plans des deux fosses, il les étudia, il détermina les points où devaient porter les recherches. Peu à peu, cette chasse l’enflammait, il était, à son tour, pris d’une fièvre de dévouement, malgré son ironique insouciance des hommes et des choses. On éprouva de premières difficultés pour descendre, à Réquillart : il fallut déblayer la bouche du puits, abattre le sorbier, raser les prunelliers et les aubépines ; et l’on eut encore à réparer les échelles. Puis, les tâtonnements commencèrent. L’ingénieur, descendu avec dix ouvriers, les faisait taper du fer de leurs outils contre certaines parties de la veine, qu’il leur désignait ; et, dans un grand silence, chacun collait une oreille à la houille, écoutait si des coups lointains ne répondaient pas. Mais on parcourut en vain toutes les galeries praticables, aucun écho ne venait. L’embarras avait augmenté : à quelle place entailler la couche ? vers qui marcher, puisque personne ne paraissait être là ? On s’entêtait pourtant, on cherchait, dans l’énervement d’une anxiété croissante.","From then on, Négrel stirred up the dust of the archives, and when he had discovered the old plans of the two pits, he studied them, he determined the points where the research should be carried out. Little by little, this hunt inflamed him, he was, in his turn, seized with a fever of devotion, in spite of his ironic carelessness of men and things. We experienced the first difficulties to go down to Réquillart: we had to clear the mouth of the well, cut down the mountain ash, shave the blackthorns and the hawthorns; and we still had to repair the ladders. Then the groping began. The engineer, who came down with ten workmen, made them strike the iron of their tools against certain parts of the vein, which he pointed out to them; and, in a great silence, each glued an ear to the coal, listening if distant knocks did not answer. But we went through all the practicable galleries in vain, no echo came. The embarrassment had increased: where to cut the diaper? Who to walk to, since no one seemed to be there? We were stubborn, however, we were searching, in the nervousness of growing anxiety.","At this point Négrel went through the files and found the original plans for the two pits, which he studied carefully, identifying the places where they ought to search. Little by little, this hunt for the trapped miners had begun to excite him, and he, too, now felt passionately committed to finding them, despite his customary ironic nonchalance towards the affairs of men and the things of this world. There were initial difficulties in getting into Réquillart: they had to clear the entrance to the shaft by removing the rowan tree and cutting back the sloe and hawthorn bushes, and then there were the ladders to be repaired as well. After that the preliminary search began. Négrel went down with ten men and had them tap their iron tools against certain parts of the seam which he indicated; and then in complete silence each man pressed his ear to the coal and listened for answering taps in the distance. They tried every roadway they could reach, but in vain; there was no answer. Now they were in even more of a quandary: where should they start cutting through the coal? In which direction should they go, since there was nobody there to guide them forward? But they kept at it, searching and searching, and the tension rose as they became increasingly concerned.","Négrel now began to stir up the dust of the archives; he discovered the old plans of the two pits, studied them, and decided on the points at which their investigations ought to be carried on. Gradually this hunt excited him; he was, in his turn, seized by a fever of devotion, in spite of his ironical indifference to men and things. The first difficulty was in going down at Réquillart; it was necessary to clear out the rubbish from the mouth of the shaft, to cut down the mountain ash, and raze the sloes and the hawthorns; they had also repair the ladders. Then they began to feel around. The engineer, having gone down with ten workmen, made them strike the iron of their tools against certain parts of the seam which he pointed out to them; and in deep silence they each placed an ear to the coal, listening for any distant blows to reply. But they went in vain through every practicable gallery; no echo returned to them. Their embarrassment increased. At what spot should they cut into the bed? Towards whom should they go, since no once appeared to be there? They persisted in seeking, however, notwithstanding the exhaustion produced by their growing anxiety."

"Mais la Maheude s’emportait davantage, au milieu des larmes d’Alzire, de Lénore et d’Henri. Tout en aidant à monter le blessé et en donnant au docteur ce dont il avait besoin, elle injuriait le sort, elle demandait où l’on voulait qu’elle trouvât de l’argent pour nourrir des infirmes. Le vieux ne suffisait donc pas, voilà que le gamin, lui aussi, perdait les pieds ! Et elle ne cessait point, pendant que d’autres cris, des lamentations déchirantes, sortaient d’une maison voisine : c’étaient la femme et les enfants de Chicot qui pleuraient sur le corps. Il faisait nuit noire, les mineurs exténués mangeaient enfin leur soupe, dans le coron tombé à un morne silence, traversé seulement de ces grands cris.","But Maheude lost her temper even more, amid the tears of Alzire, Lénore and Henri.

And it did not cease, while other cries, heartrending lamentations, issued from a neighboring house: it was Chicot's wife and children who wept over the body. It was pitch dark, the exhausted miners were finally eating their soup, in the settlement that had fallen into a gloomy silence, crossed only by these loud cries.","Alzire, Lénore and Henri were all in tears, but La Maheude was growing more and more angry. As she helped them take the injured child upstairs and supplied the doctor with what he needed, she kept cursing fate and asking where in God’s name she was supposed to find the money to feed the sick. Wasn’t it enough for the old man to lose the use of his legs? No, now it was the lad’s turn! And on she went, while all the time other, heart-rending screams of lament could be heard coming from a nearby house: Chicot’s wife and children were grieving over his dead body. It was pitch dark now, and the exhausted miners were finally able to have their soup. And a grim silence fell upon the village, punctuated only by these cries of anguish.","But Maheude grew more furious, while Alzire, Lénore, and Henri were crying around her.

"Comme elle passait devant l’église, elle vit une ombre filer rapidement. Un espoir la fit se hâter, car elle avait reconnu le curé de Montsou, l’abbé Joire, qui disait la messe le dimanche à la chapelle du coron : sans doute il sortait de la sacristie, où le règlement de quelque affaire l’avait appelé. Le dos rond, il courait de son air d’homme gras et doux, désireux de vivre en paix avec tout le monde. S’il avait fait sa course à la nuit, ce devait être pour ne pas se compromettre au milieu des mineurs. On disait du reste qu’il venait d’obtenir de l’avancement. Même, il s’était promené déjà avec son successeur, un abbé maigre, aux yeux de braise rouge.","As she passed in front of the church, she saw a shadow darting quickly by.

With a hunched back, he ran with the look of a fat, gentle man, eager to live in peace with everyone. If he had made his run at night, it must have been so as not to compromise himself among the miners. It was said, moreover, that he had just obtained a promotion. Even, he had already walked with his successor, a thin abbot, with eyes of red embers.","As she was passing the church, she saw a shadowy figure hurrying away. In a moment of hope she quickened her step, for she had recognized Father Joire, the parish priest in Montsou, who came each Sunday to say Mass in the village chapel: he must have had something to see to in the vestry. He scurried past, head bowed, with that air of a plump and kindly man whose only wish is to live in peace with everyone about him. No doubt he had run his errand at night for fear of compromising himself among the miners. Not that it mattered. It was said that he had just been promoted, and even that he had already shown his successor round, a thin man with eyes like burning embers.","As she passed before the church she saw a shadow slip rapidly by.

"Chaval tremblait, se reculait ; et, dans la bousculade, le marteau tomba, pendant que les camarades, sans attendre, massacraient la pompe à coups de barres de fer, à coups de briques, à coups de tout ce qu’ils rencontraient sous leurs mains. Quelques-uns même brisaient sur elle des bâtons. Les écrous sautaient, les pièces d’acier et de cuivre se disloquaient, ainsi que des membres arrachés. Un coup de pioche à toute volée fracassa le corps de fonte, et l’eau s’échappa, se vida, et il y eut un gargouillement suprême, pareil à un hoquet d’agonie.","Chaval trembled, drew back; and, in the jostling, the hammer fell, while the comrades, without waiting, massacred the pump with iron bars, with bricks, with blows with everything they found under their hands.

A full swing of the pickax shattered the cast iron body, and the water escaped, emptied, and there was a supreme gurgling, like a gasp of agony.","Chaval was shaking and backing away. In the general scrimmage the hammer fell to the ground, and the comrades, who could wait no longer, began to smash the pump with their crowbars or bricks or whatever came to hand. Some of them even broke their sticks over it. The screws worked loose, and the steel and brass plating began to come apart, as though the pump were being torn limb from limb. One mighty blow with a pickaxe shattered the cast-iron casing, the water spurted out, and the chamber emptied out completely, giving one last gurgle like a death rattle.","Chaval drew back trembling, and in the hustling the hammer fell; while other men, without waiting, battered the pump with blows from iron bars, blows from bricks, blows from anything they could lay their hands on. Some even broke sticks over it. The nuts leapt off, the pieces of steel and copper were dislocated like torn limbs. The blow of a shovel, delivered with full force, fractured the metal body; the water escaped and emptied itself, and there was a supreme gurgle like an agonizing death-rattle."

"Les promeneurs s’en allaient du même pas ralenti, causant toujours, lorsqu’une calèche vint s’arrêter sur la route, devant l’église.

"Alors, Étienne se tint un instant immobile sur le tronc d’arbre.

"Le vieux Mouque et Chaval étaient là. Depuis la mort de la Mouquette, sa fille, et de son garçon, Mouquet, le vieux continuait son service de palefrenier, sans un mot de regret ni de plainte.

"Comme ils soufflaient, des jurons leur firent tourner la tête. Ils venaient de retomber dans la partie de crosse, c’était Zacharie qui avait failli fendre le crâne de son frère. Les joueurs en étaient au quatrième tour : de la ferme Paillot, ils avaient filé aux Quatre-Chemins, puis des Quatre-Chemins à Montoire ; et, maintenant, ils allaient en six coups de Montoire au Pré-des-Vaches. Cela faisait deux lieues et demie en une heure ; encore avaient-ils bu des chopes à l’estaminet Vincent et au débit des Trois-Sages. Mouquet, cette fois, tenait la main. Il lui restait deux coups à choler, sa victoire était sûre, lorsque Zacharie, qui usait de son droit en ricanant, déchola avec tant d’adresse, que la cholette roula dans un fossé profond. Le partenaire de Mouquet ne put l’en sortir, ce fut un désastre. Tous quatre criaient, la partie s’en passionna, car on était manche à manche, il fallait recommencer. Du Pré-des-Vaches, il n’y avait pas deux kilomètres à la pointe des Herbes-Rousses : en cinq coups. Là-bas, ils se rafraîchiraient chez Lerenard.","As they huffed, curses made their heads spin. They had just fallen back into the lacrosse game, it was Zacharie who had nearly cracked his brother's skull. The players were in the fourth round: from the Paillot farm, they had gone to Quatre-Chemins, then from Quatre-Chemins to Montoire; and now they were going in six strokes from Montoire to Pré-des-Vaches. That was two and a half leagues in an hour; they had even drunk pints at the Vincent estaminet and at the Trois-Sages bar. Mouquet, this time, held the hand. He had two shots left to choler, his victory was certain, when Zacharie, who was using his right with a sneer, burst out with such skill that the cholette rolled into a deep ditch. Mouquet's partner couldn't get him out, it was a disaster. All four were shouting, the game was passionate about it, because we were neck and neck, we had to start over. From Pré-des-Vaches, there were not two kilometers to the tip of Herbes-Rousses: in five shots. There they would refresh themselves at Lerenard's.","As they were catching their breath, the sound of cursing made them look round. They had ended up back in the middle of the game of crosse, and Zacharie had just nearly split his brother’s skull open. The players were on their fourth leg: from Paillot Farm they had headed towards Quatre-Chemins, from Quatre-Chemins towards Montoire, and now they were trying to get from Montoire to Pré-des-Vaches in six strokes. That meant they had covered two and a half leagues in one hour, not to mention stopping for a few beers at Vincent’s bar and then at the Three Wise Men. Mouquet had won the bidding this time. He had two strokes left and was certain of victory, when Zacharie, gleefully exploiting the rules, drove back so accurately that the cholette rolled into a deep ditch. Mouquet’s playing partner could not get it out, and all was lost. The four of them were shouting their heads off and getting more and more worked up, for the scores were level. They would have to start a new leg. From Pré-des-Vaches it was only two kilometres to the tip of Les Herbes-Rousses, a matter of five strokes. And there they could have a drink at Lerenard’s.","As they were panting the sound of oaths made them turn their heads. They had just come upon the crosse party again, and Zacharie had nearly split open his brother's skull. The players were now at their fourth turn.

That made two leagues and a half in an hour; and, besides, they had had drinks at the Estaminet Vincent and at the Trois-Sages Bar. Mouquet this time was ahead. He had two more strokes to play, and his victory was certain, when Zacharie, grinning as he availed himself of his privilege, played with so much skill that the ball rolled into a deep pit. Mouquet's partner could not get it out; it was a disaster. All four shouted; the party was excited, for they were neck to neck; it was necessary to begin again. From the Pré-des-Vaches it was not two kilometres to the point of Herbes-Rousses, in five strokes. There they would refresh themselves at Lerenard's."
"Puis, baissant encore la voix, en phrases amères, il dit son ancien rêve de fraternité. Il n’avait renoncé à son rang et à sa fortune, il ne s’était mis avec les ouvriers, que dans l’espoir de voir se fonder enfin cette société nouvelle du travail en commun. Tous les sous de ses poches avaient longtemps passé aux galopins du coron, il s’était montré pour les charbonniers d’une tendresse de frère, souriant à leur défiance, les conquérant par son air tranquille d’ouvrier exact et peu causeur. Mais, décidément, la fusion ne se faisait pas, il leur demeurait étranger, avec son mépris de tous les liens, sa volonté de se garder brave, en dehors des glorioles et des jouissances. Et il était surtout, depuis le matin, exaspéré par la lecture d’un fait divers qui courait les journaux.","Then, lowering his voice still further, in bitter phrases, he said his old dream of brotherhood. He had renounced his rank and his fortune, he had joined the workers, only in the hope of finally seeing the founding of this new society of labor in common. All the pennies in his pockets had long been spent on the scamps of the settlement, he had shown the tenderness of a brother for the charcoal-burners, smiling at their mistrust, winning them over with his calm air of an exact workman and little conversationalist. But, decidedly, the fusion did not take place, he remained a stranger to them, with his contempt for all ties, his desire to keep himself brave, apart from glorioles and pleasures. And above all, since the morning, he had been exasperated by the reading of a news item that was running through the newspapers.","Then, lowering his voice, he began to speak bitterly about his old dream of brotherhood. He had given up his rank and fortune and thrown in his lot with the workers in the sole hope of seeing a new society founded on the communality of labour. Every penny he possessed had long since ended up in the pockets of the village children, and he had always treated the miners with brotherly affection, amused by their distrust of him and eventually winning them round by his quiet manner and the fact that he took pride in his work and kept himself to himself. But quite plainly he was never going to fit in completely, because in their eyes he would always remain a foreigner, a stranger in their midst, what with his scorn for all human ties and his determination to remain true to the cause, uncompromised by the pursuit of pleasure or spurious honour. And since that morning he had been feeling particularly exasperated by an item that was in all the newspapers.","Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place; he remained a stranger, with his contempt of all bonds, his desire to keep himself free of all petty vanities and enjoyments. And since this morning he had been especially exasperated by reading an incident in the newspapers."

"Il leva un bras dans un geste lent, il commença ; mais sa voix ne grondait plus, il avait pris le ton froid d’un simple mandataire du peuple qui rend ses comptes. Enfin, il plaçait le discours que le commissaire de police lui avait coupé au Bon-Joyeux ; et il débutait par un historique rapide de la grève, en affectant l’éloquence scientifique : des faits, rien que des faits. D’abord, il dit sa répugnance contre la grève : les mineurs ne l’avaient pas voulue, c’était la Direction qui les avait provoqués, avec son nouveau tarif de boisage. Puis, il rappela la première démarche des délégués chez le directeur, la mauvaise foi de la Régie, et plus tard, lors de la seconde démarche, sa concession tardive, les dix centimes quelle rendait, après avoir tâché de les voler. Maintenant, on en était là, il établissait par des chiffres le vide de la caisse de prévoyance, indiquait l’emploi des secours envoyés, excusait en quelques phrases l’Internationale, Pluchart et les autres, de ne pouvoir faire davantage pour eux, au milieu des soucis de leur conquête du monde. Donc, la situation s’aggravait de jour en jour, la Compagnie renvoyait les livrets et menaçait d’embaucher des ouvriers en Belgique ; en outre, elle intimidait les faibles, elle avait décidé un certain nombre de mineurs à redescendre. Il gardait sa voix monotone comme pour insister sur ces mauvaises nouvelles, il disait la faim victorieuse, l’espoir mort, la lutte arrivée aux fièvres dernières du courage. Et, brusquement, il conclut, sans hausser le ton.","He raised an arm in a slow gesture, he began; but his voice no longer rumbled, he had assumed the cold tone of a simple representative of the people rendering his accounts. Finally, he placed the speech which the commissioner of police had cut off for him at the Bon-Joyeux; and he began with a brief history of the strike, affecting scientific eloquence: facts, nothing but facts. First, he expressed his repugnance against the strike: the miners hadn't wanted it, it was the management that had provoked them, with its new timbering tariff. Then he recalled the delegates' first approach to the director, the Régie's bad faith, and later, during the second approach, their belated concession, the ten centimes they returned, after having tried to steal them. Now we were there, he established by figures the emptiness of the provident fund, indicated the use of the aid sent, excused in a few sentences the Internationale, Pluchart and the others, for not being able to do more for them, at the in the midst of the worries of their conquest of the world. So the situation was getting worse day by day, the Company was sending back the booklets and threatening to hire workers in Belgium; moreover, she intimidated the weak, she had persuaded a certain number of miners to come back down. He kept his voice monotonous as if to insist on this bad news, he spoke of victorious hunger, dead hope, the struggle which had reached the last fevers of courage. And, abruptly, he concludes, without raising his voice.","Slowly he raised one arm and began; but the voice of righteous indignation had gone, and he now spoke in the cold, dispassionate tone of a simple envoy of the people delivering his report. At last he was able to give the speech that the police superintendent had interrupted at the Jolly Fellow; and he began with a brief history of the strike, presenting it in the style of a fluent and informed analysis: facts, nothing but the facts. First he said how he didn’t like strikes: the miners hadn’t wanted one, it was management who had driven them to it with its new timbering rate. Then he recalled the first meeting the deputation had sought with the manager and how the Board of Directors had acted in bad faith, and then the delegates’ second approach and the manager’s belated concession, with the Company being prepared to restore the two centimes it had earlier tried to steal from them. That was how matters presently stood. He provided figures showing that the provident fund was exhausted, described how the financial help they had received had been used, and said a few words by way of excusing the International, Pluchart and the others, for not having been able to do more for them, preoccupied as they were with their plans to conquer the world. In a word, things were getting worse by the day: the Company was sacking people and threatening to recruit workers from Belgium. Not only that, it was intimidating potential blacklegs and had already persuaded a certain number of miners to return to work. Étienne said all this in the same, even tones as though to insist on the gravity of the bad news; hunger had beaten them, he said, all hope was lost, and they were now in the death throes of their courageous struggle. Then abruptly he ended, as matter-of-fact as when he had begun:","He raised his arm with a slow movement and began. But his voice was not fierce; he spoke in the cold tones of a simple envoy of the people, who was rendering his account. He was delivering the discourse which the commissioner of police had cut short at the Bon-Joyeux; and he began by a rapid history of the strike, affecting a certain scientific eloquence--facts, nothing but facts. At first he spoke of his dislike to the strike; the miners had not desired it, it was the management which had provoked it with the new timbering tariff.

Now he showed by figures the exhaustion of the provident fund, and pointed out the use that had been made of the help sent, briefly excusing the International, Pluchart and the others, for not being able to do more for them in the midst of the cares of their conquest of the world. So the situation was getting worse every day; the Company was giving back certificates and threatening to hire men from Belgium; besides, it was intimidating the weak, and had forced a certain number of miners to go down again. He preserved his monotonous voice, as if to insist on the bad news; he said that hunger was victorious, that hope was dead, and that the struggle had reached the last feverish efforts of courage. And then he suddenly concluded, without raising his voice:"
"Et lui-même s’étonna d’avoir dit cette chose. Il avait juré de ne pas redescendre, d’où venait donc cette décision brusque, sortie de ses lèvres, sans qu’il y eût songé, sans qu’il l’eût discutée un instant ? Maintenant, c’était en lui un tel calme, une guérison si complète de ses doutes, qu’il s’entêtait, en homme sauvé par le hasard, et qui avait trouvé enfin l’unique porte à son tourment. Aussi refusa-t-il de l’entendre, lorsqu’elle s’alarma, comprenant qu’il se dévouait pour elle, redoutant les mauvaises paroles dont on l’accueillerait à la fosse.

"Combien d’heures s’écoulèrent ainsi ? Il n’aurait pu le dire. Ce qu’il savait, c’était que devant lui, par le trou de la cheminée, il avait vu reparaître le flot noir et mouvant, la bête dont le dos s’enflait sans cesse pour les atteindre. D’abord, il n’y eut qu’une ligne mince, un serpent souple qui s’allongea ; puis, cela s’élargit en une échine grouillante, rampante ; et bientôt ils furent rejoints, les pieds de la jeune fille endormie trempèrent. Anxieux, il hésitait à la réveiller. N’était-ce pas cruel de la tirer de ce repos, de l’ignorance anéantie qui la berçait peut-être dans un rêve de grand air et de vie au soleil ? Par où fuir, d’ailleurs ? Et il cherchait, et il se rappela que le plan incliné, établi dans cette partie de la veine, communiquait, bout à bout, avec le plan qui desservait l’accrochage supérieur. C’était une issue. Il la laissa dormir encore, le plus longtemps qu’il fut possible, regardant le flot gagner, attendant qu’il les chassât. Enfin, il la souleva doucement, et elle eut un grand frisson.","How many hours passed like this? He couldn't have said it. What he knew was that in front of him, through the hole in the chimney, he had seen the black and moving wave reappear, the beast whose back was constantly swelling to reach them. At first there was only a thin line, a supple snake that lengthened; then it widens into a swarming, crawling spine; and soon they were joined, the sleeping girl's feet soaked. Anxious, he hesitated to wake her. Wasn't it cruel to rouse her from this rest, from the annihilated ignorance that perhaps rocked her in a dream of the open air and life in the sun? Where to flee, anyway? And he was looking, and he remembered that the inclined plane, established in this part of the vein, communicated, end to end, with the plane which served the upper attachment. It was a way out. He let her sleep longer, as long as possible, watching the rising tide, waiting for him to drive them away. Finally, he picked her up gently, and she shivered.","How many hours went by like this? He could not have said. But what he did know was that there in front of him, at the mouth of the chimney, he could see the black water moving, like a beast arching its back higher and higher to reach them. At first, it was just a thin trickle, like a writhing snake straightening out; then it grew into the swarming, crawling spine of an animal; and then it caught up with them, wetting Catherine ’s feet as she slept. He was anxious not to wake her. It would surely be cruel to rouse her from her rest and from her blissful unawareness, perhaps even from pleasant dreams of fresh air and life in the sunshine. And anyway, where could they go now? He thought for a while, and then he remembered that the top of the incline serving this part of the seam connected with the foot of the incline serving the level above. It was a way out. He let her sleep on for as long as possible, watching the water rise and waiting till it chased them on. Eventually he lifted her gently, and she gave a great shudder:","How many hours passed by thus? He would have been unable to say. All that he knew was that before him, through the hole they had ascended, he had seen the flood reappear, black and moving, the beast whose back was ceaselessly swelling out to reach them. At first it was only a thin line, a supple serpent stretching itself out; then it enlarged into a crawling, crouching flank; and soon it reached them, and the sleeping girl's feet were touched by it. In his anxiety he yet hesitated to wake her. Was it not cruel to snatch her from this repose of unconscious ignorance, which was, perhaps, lulling her with a dream of the open air and of life beneath the sun? Besides, where could they fly? And he thought and remembered that the upbrow established at this part of the seam communicated end to end with that which served the upper level. That would be a way out. He let her sleep as long as possible, watching the flood gain on them, waiting for it to chase them away. At last he lifted her gently, and a great shudder passed over her."

"L’entrevue eut lieu le mardi matin, le jour où le coron tombait à la misère noire. Elle fut moins cordiale que la première. Maheu parla encore, expliqua que les camarades les envoyaient demander si ces messieurs n’avaient rien de nouveau à leur dire. D’abord, M. Hennebeau affecta la surprise : aucun ordre ne lui était parvenu, les choses ne pouvaient changer, tant que les mineurs s’entêteraient dans leur révolte détestable ; et cette raideur autoritaire produisit l’effet le plus fâcheux, à tel point que, si les délégués s’étaient dérangés avec des intentions conciliantes, la façon dont on les recevait aurait suffi à les faire s’obstiner davantage. Ensuite, le directeur voulut bien chercher un terrain de concessions mutuelles : ainsi, les ouvriers accepteraient le paiement du boisage à part, tandis que la Compagnie hausserait ce paiement des deux centimes dont on l’accusait de profiter. Du reste, il ajoutait qu’il prenait l’offre sur lui, que rien n’était résolu, qu’il se flattait pourtant d’obtenir à Paris cette concession. Mais les délégués refusèrent et répétèrent leurs exigences : le maintien de l’ancien système, avec une hausse de cinq centimes par berline. Alors, il avoua qu’il pouvait traiter tout de suite, il les pressa d’accepter, au nom de leurs femmes et de leurs petits mourant de faim. Et, les yeux à terre, le crâne dur, ils dirent non, toujours non, d’un branle farouche. On se sépara brutalement. M. Hennebeau faisait claquer les portes. Étienne, Maheu et les autres s’en allaient, tapant leurs gros talons sur le pavé, dans la rage muette des vaincus poussés à bout.","The interview took place on Tuesday morning, the day when the settlement fell into abject poverty. She was less cordial than the first. Maheu spoke again, explaining that the comrades sent them to ask if these gentlemen had nothing new to tell them. At first, M. Hennebeau affected surprise: no order had reached him, things could not change as long as the miners persisted in their detestable revolt; and this authoritarian stiffness produced the most unfortunate effect, so much so that, if the delegates had disturbed themselves with conciliatory intentions, the way in which they were received would have sufficed to make them more obstinate. Then, the director wanted to look for a ground of mutual concessions: thus, the workers would accept the payment of the woodwork separately, while the Company would increase this payment by the two centimes of which it was accused of profiting. Besides, he added that he was taking the offer on his own, that nothing had been settled, that he flattered himself, however, that he would obtain this concession in Paris. But the delegates refused and repeated their demands: the maintenance of the old system, with an increase of five centimes per sedan. So, he confessed that he could deal at once, he urged them to accept, in the name of their wives and their starving little ones. And, their eyes on the ground, their skulls hard, they said no, still no, with a fierce motion. We parted abruptly. M. Hennebeau was slamming the doors. Étienne, Maheu and the others went off, stamping their heavy heels on the pavement, in the mute rage of the vanquished pushed to their limits.","The meeting took place on Tuesday morning, the day when the village finally found itself staring into the abyss. The encounter was less cordial than the first. Once more it was Maheu who spoke, explaining that his comrades had sent them to inquire if the gentlemen had anything new to say to them. At first M. Hennebeau pretended to be surprised: he had not received any new instructions, and there could be no change in the position as long as the miners persisted in this detestable protest of theirs. This unbending and authoritarian attitude had the worst possible effect, to the extent that even if the delegates had come to the meeting in the most conciliatory frame of mind the manner of their reception would have been enough to stiffen their resistance. Then the manager indicated his willingness to explore a possible basis for compromise: for example, the workers might accept to be paid separately for the timbering and the Company would increase payment by the two centimes which they were alleged to be gaining from the new system. Of course this offer was being made on his own initiative, nothing had been decided, though he flattered himself that he would succeed in getting Paris to agree to this concession. But the delegates refused and restated their terms: the old system to remain, and an increase of five centimes per tub. Then M. Hennebeau admitted that he did have the power to negotiate directly, and he urged them to accept for the sake of their starving wives and children. But the men stared resolutely at the floor and said no, still no, fiercely shaking their heads. The meeting ended abruptly. M. Hennebeau slammed the doors, while Étienne, Maheu and the others made their way home, their heavy boots thudding over the cobbles with the silent rage of defeated men who have been pushed as far as they will go.","The interview took place on Tuesday morning, when the settlement was sinking into desperate wretchedness. It was less cordial than the first interview. Maheu was still the speaker, and he explained that their mates had sent them to ask if these gentlemen had anything new to say. At first M. Hennebeau affected surprise: no order had reached him, nothing could be changed so long as the miners persisted in their detestable rebellion; and this official stiffness produced the worst effects, so that if the delegates had gone out of their way to offer conciliation, the way in which they were received would only have served to make them more obstinate. Afterwards the manager tried to seek a basis of mutual concession; thus, if the men would accept the separate payment for timbering, the Company would raise that payment by the two centimes which they were accused of profiting by. Besides, he added that he would take the offer on himself, that nothing was settled, but that he flattered himself he could obtain this concession from Paris. But the delegates refused, and repeated their demands: the retention of the old system, with a rise of five centimes a tram. Then he acknowledged that he could treat with them at once, and urged them to accept in the name of their wives and little ones dying of hunger. And with eyes on the ground and stiff heads they said no, always no, with fierce vigour. They separated curtly. M. Hennebeau banged the doors. Étienne, Maheu, and the others went off stamping with their great heels on the pavement in the mute rage of the vanquished pushed to extremes."

"Péniblement, Catherine s’était décidée à emplir sa berline ; puis, elle la poussa. La galerie était trop large pour qu’elle pût s’arc-bouter aux deux côtés des bois, ses pieds nus se tordaient dans les rails, où ils cherchaient un point d’appui, pendant qu’elle filait avec lenteur, les bras raidis en avant, la taille cassée. Et, dès qu’elle longeait le corroi, le supplice du feu recommençait, la sueur tombait aussitôt de tout son corps, en gouttes énormes, comme une pluie d’orage. À peine au tiers du relais, elle ruissela, aveuglée, souillée elle aussi d’une boue noire. Sa chemise étroite, comme trempée d’encre, collait à sa peau, lui remontait jusqu’aux reins dans le mouvement des cuisses ; et elle en était si douloureusement bridée, qu’il lui fallut lâcher encore la besogne.","Painfully, Catherine had decided to fill her coach; then she pushed her. The gallery was too wide for her to be able to brace herself against either side of the woods, her bare feet writhing in the rails, where they sought a foothold, while she spun slowly, her arms stiffened. forward, the broken waist. And, as soon as she skirted the corroi, the ordeal of fire began again, the sweat immediately fell from her whole body, in enormous drops, like a rainstorm. Barely a third of the belay, she dripped, blinded, also stained with black mud. His tight shirt, as if soaked in ink, clung to his skin, came up to his loins in the movement of his thighs; and she was so painfully restrained by it that she had to give up the task again.","With great effort Catherine had made herself fill the tub, and now she began to push it. The roadway was too wide for her to be able to gain purchase by arching her back against the timbering on either side, and she kept twisting her ankles as she tried to get a grip on the rails with her bare feet; and so progress was slow as she strained forward with her arms stretched out taut in front of her and her body bent in half. As soon as she reached the break, the torture by fire began again, and enormous beads of sweat started falling from every part of her body like heavy raindrops in a storm. By the time she was scarcely a third of the way along, it was pouring off her, and she could see nothing. She, too, was covered in black grime. Her tight shirt looked as though it had been soaked in ink; and as it clung to her skin, the movement of her thighs made it ride up over her hips, restricting her movements so painfully that once more she was forced to stop.","Catherine had painfully decided to fill her tram, then she pushed it. The gallery was too wide for her to get a purchase on the timber on both sides; her naked feet were twisted in the rails where they sought a point of support, while she slowly moved on, her arms stiffened in front, and her back breaking. As soon as she came up to the clay wall, the fiery torture again began, and the sweat fell from her whole body in enormous drops as from a storm-cloud. She had scarcely got a third of the way before she streamed, blinded, soiled also by the black mud. Her narrow chemise, black as though dipped in ink, was sticking to her skin, and rising up to her waist with the movement of her thighs; it hurt her so that she had once more to stop her task."
"– Ah ! çà, est-ce que tu dors ? reprit violemment Chaval, dès qu’il cessa d’entendre remuer Catherine. Qui est-ce qui m’a fichu une rosse de cette espèce ?

"Une heure encore s’écoula. Le porion avait arrêté le déblaiement, pour employer tout son monde à étayer le toit. Même la herscheuse et les deux galibots ne roulaient plus, préparaient et apportaient les pièces du boisage. Dans ce fond de galerie, l’équipe se trouvait comme aux avant-postes, perdue à une extrémité de la mine, sans communication désormais avec les autres chantiers. Trois ou quatre fois, des bruits étranges, de lointains galops firent bien tourner la tête aux travailleurs : qu’était-ce donc ? on aurait dit que les voies se vidaient, que les camarades remontaient déjà, et au pas de course. Mais la rumeur se perdait dans le profond silence, ils se remettaient à caler les bois, étourdis par les grands coups de marteau. Enfin, on reprit le déblaiement, le roulage recommença.","Another hour passed. The foreman had stopped the clearing, to employ all his people to support the roof. Even the putter and the two tramps no longer rolled, preparing and bringing the pieces of woodwork. At the back of the gallery, the team was at the forefront, lost at one end of the mine, now without communication with the other sites. Three or four times, strange noises, distant gallops, made the workers' heads spin: what was it? one would have said that the tracks were emptying, that the comrades were already coming up, and at a run. But the rumor was lost in the deep silence, they went back to wedging the wood, stunned by the great blows of the hammer. Finally, we resumed the clearing, the taxiing began again.","Another hour went by. The deputy had stopped the men clearing the rubble and set everyone to the task of strengthening the roof. Even Catherine and the two pit-boys had stopped pushing their tubs and instead were getting the props ready and bringing them along. Here at the end of the roadway the team was like a remote outpost at the furthest point of the mine, and it was now completely cut off from the other workings. On three or four occasions they heard strange noises, like the sound of people running, and they looked up from their work. What was happening? It was as if all the roads were emptying, as if the comrades were already returning to the surface, and as fast as they possibly could. But the sounds faded away in the deep silence, and they resumed their task of ramming timber props under the ceiling, dazed by the deafening blows of the sledgehammer. Eventually they returned to clearing away the rocks, and the tubs began moving again.","Another hour passed by. The captain had stopped the removal of the rubbish to employ all his people in supporting the roof. Even the putter and the two trammers left off wheeling to prepare and bring pieces of timber. At this end of the gallery the gang formed a sort of advance guard at the very extremity of the mine, now without communication with the other stalls. Three or four times strange noises, distant rushes, made the workers turn their heads to listen. What was it, then? One would have said that the passages were being emptied and the mates already returning at a running pace. But the sound was lost in the deep silence, and they set to wedging their wood again, dazed by the loud blows of the hammer. At last they returned to the rubbish, and the wheeling began once more."
"D’un geste, il réclama le silence. Maintenant, il abordait la question des grèves. En principe, il les désapprouvait, elles étaient un moyen trop lent, qui aggravait plutôt les souffrances de l’ouvrier. Mais, en attendant mieux, quand elles devenaient inévitables, il fallait s’y résoudre, car elles avaient l’avantage de désorganiser le capital. Et, dans ce cas, il montrait l’Internationale comme une providence pour les grévistes, il citait des exemples : à Paris, lors de la grève des bronziers, les patrons avaient tout accordé d’un coup, pris de terreur à la nouvelle que l’Internationale envoyait des secours ; à Londres, elle avait sauvé les mineurs d’une houillère, en rapatriant à ses frais un convoi de Belges, appelés par le propriétaire de la mine. Il suffisait d’adhérer, les Compagnies tremblaient, les ouvriers entraient dans la grande armée des travailleurs, décidés à mourir les uns pour les autres, plutôt que de rester les esclaves de la société capitaliste.","With a gesture, he called for silence. Now he was addressing the issue of strikes. In principle, he disapproved of them, they were too slow a means, which rather aggravated the sufferings of the worker. But, while waiting for better, when they became inevitable, it was necessary to resolve to do so, because they had the advantage of disorganizing capital. And, in this case, he showed the International as a providence for the strikers, he cited examples: in Paris, during the strike of the bronziers, the bosses had granted everything at once, seized with terror at the news that the International sent help; in London, it had saved the miners of a colliery, by repatriating at its own expense a convoy of Belgians, called by the owner of the mine. It was enough to join, the Companies trembled, the workers joined the great army of workers, determined to die for each other, rather than remain the slaves of capitalist society.","He motioned to them to be silent. Now he was coming to the question of strikes. In principle he was against them: they took too long to have an effect and in fact just made life worse for the workers. Things would be better arranged in future, but for the moment – and when there was just no other way – you had to accept them, because at least they had the merit of disrupting capitalism. And in that kind of situation, as he pointed out, the International could be a godsend for strikers. He gave examples: one from Paris, when the bronze-founders went on strike and the bosses had met all their demands immediately because they were terrified at the news that the International was sending aid; another from the London branch, which had saved the miners at one colliery by paying for the repatriation of a team of Belgian pitmen brought over by the mine-owner. You had only to join and the companies started running scared, and that way the workers became part of labour’s great army, ready to die for one another rather than remain the slaves of capitalist society.","With a gesture he enforced silence. Now he was entering on the strike question. In principle he disapproved of strikes; it was a slow method, which aggravated the sufferings of the worker. But before better things arrived, and when they were inevitable, one must make up one's mind to them, for they had the advantage of disorganizing capital. And in this case he showed the International as providence for strikers, and quoted examples: in Paris, during the strike of the bronze-workers, the masters had granted everything at once, terrified at the news that the International was sending help; in London it had saved the miners at a colliery, by sending back, at its own expense, a ship-load of Belgians who had been brought over by the coal-owner. It was sufficient to join and the companies trembled, for the men entered the great army of workers who were resolved to die for one another rather than to remain the slaves of a capitalistic society."

"C’était une intimité de chaque minute, il remplaçait partout le frère aîné, partageait le lit de Jeanlin, devant le lit de la grande sœur. Au coucher, au lever, il devait se déshabiller, se rhabiller près d’elle, la voyait elle-même ôter et remettre ses vêtements. Quand le dernier jupon tombait, elle apparaissait d’une blancheur pâle, de cette neige transparente des blondes anémiques ; et il éprouvait une continuelle émotion, à la trouver si blanche, les mains et le visage déjà gâtés, comme trempée dans du lait, de ses talons à son col, où la ligne du hâle tranchait nettement en un collier d’ambre. Il affectait de se détourner ; mais il la connaissait peu à peu : les pieds d’abord que ses yeux baissés rencontraient ; puis, un genou entrevu, lorsqu’elle se glissait sous la couverture ; puis, la gorge aux petits seins rigides, dès qu’elle se penchait le matin sur la terrine. Elle, sans le regarder, se hâtait pourtant, était en dix secondes dévêtue et allongée près d’Alzire, d’un mouvement si souple de couleuvre, qu’il retirait à peine ses souliers, quand elle disparaissait, tournant le dos, ne montrant plus que son lourd chignon.","It was an intimacy every minute, he replaced the older brother everywhere, shared Jeanlin's bed, in front of the big sister's bed.

When the last petticoat fell, she appeared of a pale whiteness, of that transparent snow of anemic blondes; and he felt a continual emotion to find her so white, her hands and face already spoiled, as though dipped in milk, from her heels to her collar, where the line of tan stood out clearly in a necklace of amber. He affected to turn away; but he knew her little by little: first the feet which his lowered eyes met; then, a glimpse of a knee, as she slipped under the coverlet; then, her throat with small rigid breasts, as soon as she bent over the terrine in the morning. She, without looking at him, however hastened, was in ten seconds undressed and stretched out beside Alzire, with a movement so supple like a grass snake, that he barely took off his shoes, when she disappeared, turning her back, not showing more than her heavy bun.","They lived in ceaseless and intimate proximity, for he was taking the elder brother’s place in all things and shared a bed with Jeanlin, just beside his big sister’s.

When the last underskirt fell to the floor, there she would be in all her pale whiteness, with that snowy transparency of skin characteristic of the fair-haired anaemic; and he never failed to be shocked at seeing her so white (when her hands and face were already stained), as if she had been dipped in milk from her heels right up to her neck, where the hauling-rope had left its mark like an amber necklace. He pretended to look away, but gradually he came to know her: first the feet, visible to his lowered gaze; then a knee, glimpsed as she slid beneath the blanket; and later her firm little breasts as she bent over the wash-basin in the mornings. While she seemed to pay him no heed, she would nevertheless undress as quickly as possible and in no time was lying next to Alzire, having slithered into bed so fast, like a snake, that he had hardly got his shoes off before she was vanishing from view, with her back towards him and only her thick bun now to be seen.","There was a constant intimacy, as he everywhere replaced the elder brother, sharing Jeanlin's bed over against the big sister's.

Il cria, il agita le signal d’une main furieuse ; et il était grand temps d’ailleurs, car il s’aperçut, cent mètres plus haut, que le cuvelage supérieur se mettait à son tour en mouvement : les joints s’ouvraient, perdaient leur brandissage d’étoupe, lâchaient des ruisseaux. Ce n’était à présent qu’une question d’heures, le puits achèverait de se décuveler, et s’écroulerait.","Négrel had to resign himself to pulling the signal rope so that it could be pulled up. Then he was arrested again. A stupor remained in him, that of this accident, so sudden, the cause of which he did not understand. He wanted to realize, he examined the few parts of the casing that held good. From a distance, tears, nicks in the wood had surprised him. His lamp was dying, drowned in dampness, and he touched with his fingers, he very clearly recognized the blows of the saw, the blows of the crankshaft, all an abominable work of destruction. Obviously, we had wanted this catastrophe. He remained gaping, the pieces cracked, were damaged along with their frames, in a final slippage that almost carried him away. His bravery was gone, the thought of the man who had done it made his hair stand on end, chilled him with the religious fear of evil, as if, mingled in the darkness, the man had still been there, enormous, to his disproportionate package. He shouted, he waved the signal with a furious hand; and it was high time, moreover, for he noticed, a hundred meters higher, that the upper casing was in turn beginning to move: the joints were opening, losing their tow brandishing, letting out streams. It was now only a matter of hours, the well would finish uncovering, and would collapse.","Négrel was obliged to admit defeat and pulled on the rope in order to be returned to the surface. But then he signalled for another stop. He was still amazed by how suddenly the disaster had occurred, and he did not understand why. He wanted to find out, and started examining the pieces of tubbing that were still intact. From a distance he had been surprised by the scratches and dents in the wood. His lamp had almost gone out because of the wet, and so he felt around with his fingers and was able to make out very easily the saw marks and the drill holes, the whole, ghastly process of destruction. Quite clearly someone had wanted this disaster to happen. As he stared open-mouthed, these last pieces gave way and plunged down the shaft, frames and all, in a final moment of disintegration that nearly took him with it. His courage had vanished, and the thought of the man who had done this made his hair stand on end, chilling the blood in his veins with the awestruck dread of evil, as if the man were still there, like some monstrous presence in all this darkness, a witness to his own inordinate crime. He screamed and pulled frantically on the rope. And it was high time he did so, for he noticed that a hundred metres above him the upper tubbing was starting to show signs of movement: the joints were opening up and the caulking beginning to give way, releasing streams of water. It was now only a matter of hours before the mine-shaft would lose its entire tubbing and cave in completely.","Négrel resigned himself to pulling the signal-cord as a sign to draw up. Then he had himself stopped again. He could not conceive the cause of this sudden accident. He wished to investigate it, and examined those pieces of the tubbing which were still in place. At a distance the tears and cuts in the wood had surprised him. His lamp, drowned in dampness, was going out, and, touching with his fingers, he clearly recognized the marks of the saw and of the wimble--the whole abominable labour of destruction. Evidently this catastrophe had been intentionally produced. He was stupefied, and the pieces of timber, cracking and falling down with their frames in a last slide, nearly carried him with them. His courage fled. The thought of the man who had done that made his hair stand on end, and froze him with a supernatural fear of evil, as though, mixed with the darkness, the man were still there paying for his immeasurable crime. He shouted and shook the cord furiously; and it was, indeed, time, for he perceived that the uppertubbing, a hundred metres higher, was in its turn beginning to move. The joints were opening, losing their oakum caulking, and streams were rushing through. It was now only a question of hours before the tubbing would all fall down."

"Dès le soir, ils retournèrent ensemble à la fosse prendre connaissance des affiches. Les tailles mises aux enchères se trouvaient à la veine Filonnière, dans la galerie nord du Voreux. Elles semblaient peu avantageuses, le mineur hochait la tête à la lecture que le jeune homme lui faisait des conditions. En effet, le lendemain, quand ils furent descendus et qu’il l’eut emmené visiter la veine, il lui fit remarquer l’éloignement de l’accrochage, la nature ébouleuse du terrain, le peu d’épaisseur et la dureté du charbon. Pourtant, si l’on voulait manger, il fallait travailler. Aussi, le dimanche suivant, allèrent-ils aux enchères, qui avaient lieu dans la baraque, et que l’ingénieur de la fosse, assisté du maître porion, présidait, en l’absence de l’ingénieur divisionnaire. Cinq à six cents charbonniers se trouvaient là, en face de la petite estrade, plantée dans un coin ; et les adjudications marchaient d’un tel train, qu’on entendait seulement un sourd tumulte de voix, des chiffres criés, étouffés par d’autres chiffres.","In the evening, they returned together to the pit to read the posters. The sizes put up for auction were in the Filonnière vein, in the northern gallery of the Voreux. They seemed unfavorable, the miner nodded at the young man's reading of the conditions. In fact, the next day, when they had gone down and he had taken him to visit the seam, he pointed out to him the distance of the collision, the crumbling nature of the ground, the thinness and the hardness of the coal. . However, if you wanted to eat, you had to work. Also, the following Sunday, they went to the auction, which took place in the barracks, and which the engineer of the pit, assisted by the master foreman, presided over, in the absence of the divisional engineer. Five to six hundred charcoal burners were there, facing the little platform set up in a corner; and the adjudications proceeded at such a rate that one heard only a muffled tumult of voices, figures shouted, stifled by other figures.","That evening they both went back to the pit to study the notices. The contracts being put up for auction were in the Filonnière seam, off Le Voreux’s north roadway. They did not seem very attractive propositions, and Maheu shook his head as Étienne read out the conditions of sale to him. When they were below ground the next day, Maheu duly took him to the seam to show him how far it was from pit-bottom and to point out the crumbling rock, the thinness of the seam, and the hardness of the coal. Still, if you wanted to eat, you had to work. So on the following Sunday they attended the auction, which took place in the changing-room and, in the absence of the divisional engineer, was presided over by the pit engineer and the overman. Five or six hundred colliers were there, facing the small platform that had been set up in one corner; and the contracts were sold off at such a speed that all they could hear was a dull roar of people talking and of bids being shouted and drowned out by further bids.","In the evening they returned together to the pit to take note of the placards. The cuttings put up to auction were in the Filonnire seam in the north gallery of the Voreux. They did not seem very advantageous, and the miner shook his head when the young man read out the conditions. On the following day when they had gone down, he took him to see the seam, and showed him how far away it was from the pit-eye, the crumbly nature of the earth, the thinness and hardness of the coal. But if they were to eat they would have to work. So on the following Sunday they went to the auction, which took place in the shed and was presided over by the engineer of the pit, assisted by the head captain, in the absence of the divisional engineer. From five to six hundred miners were there in front of the little platform, which was placed in the corner, and the bidding went on so rapidly that one only heard a deep tumult of voices, of shouted figures drowned by other figures."

His voice had taken on a kind of religious fear, it was as if he had spoken of an inaccessible tabernacle, where the sated and squatting god was hiding, to whom they all gave their flesh, and whom they had never seen. .","And with a wave of his hand he gestured towards an indeterminate point in the gloom, a remote, unknown place inhabited by these ‘people’ on whose behalf the Maheu family had been working the seams for over a century.

"N’en pouvant plus, elle éprouva un besoin d’ôter sa chemise. Cela tournait à la torture, ce linge dont les moindres plis la coupaient, la brûlaient. Elle résista, voulut rouler encore, fut forcée de se remettre debout. Alors, vivement, en se disant qu’elle se couvrirait au relais, elle enleva tout, la corde, la chemise, si fiévreuse, qu’elle aurait arraché la peau, si elle avait pu. Et, nue maintenant, pitoyable, ravalée au trot de la femelle quêtant sa vie par la boue des chemins, elle besognait, la croupe barbouillée de suie, avec de la crotte jusqu’au ventre, ainsi qu’une jument de fiacre. À quatre pattes, elle poussait.","Unable to take it any longer, she felt the need to take off her shirt. It turned to torture, this linen whose slightest folds cut her, burned her. She resisted, wanted to roll again, was forced to get back on her feet. Then, hastily, telling herself that she would cover herself at the belay, she took off everything, the rope, the shirt, so feverishly that she would have torn off the skin if she had been able. And, naked now, pitiful, swallowed up at the trot of the female seeking her life through the mud of the roads, she labored, her rump smeared with soot, with droppings up to her belly, like a horse-drawn carriage mare. On all fours, she pushed.","Unable to bear the heat any longer, she felt a desperate need to remove her shirt. The cloth was torturing her, and the merest crease seemed to cut into her and burn her flesh. She resisted the urge and made another attempt to push the tub, but she had to straighten up again. Then, all of a sudden, telling herself that she would cover up at the relay-point, she stripped completely, untying the string and removing her shirt in such feverish haste that she would have torn her skin off, too, had she been able. Now completely naked and pitifully reduced to the level of an animal padding along a muddy path in search of food, she went about her work, her buttocks splattered in soot and her front covered in grime up to her belly, like a filth-covered mare between the shafts of a hansom cab. She was pushing the tub on all fours.","Unable to go farther, she felt the need of taking off her chemise. It was beginning to torture her, this garment of which the least folds cut and burnt her. She resisted the longing, and tried to push again, but was forced to stand upright.

"Cinq heures sonnaient, lorsque la Pierronne vint savoir si c’était avec Jeanlin que sa Lydie avait filé. Levaque répondit que ça devait être quelque chose comme ça, car Bébert, lui aussi, avait disparu ; et ces galopins gourgandinaient toujours ensemble. Quand Maheu les eut tranquillisés, en parlant de la salade de pissenlits, lui et le camarade se mirent à attaquer la jeune femme, avec une crudité de bons diables. Elle s’en fâchait, mais ne s’en allait pas, chatouillée au fond par les gros mots, qui la faisaient crier, les mains au ventre. Il arriva à son secours une femme maigre, dont la colère bégayante ressemblait à un gloussement de poule. D’autres, au loin, sur les portes, s’effarouchaient de confiance. Maintenant, l’école était fermée, toute la marmaille traînait, c’était un grouillement de petits êtres piaulant, se roulant, se battant ; tandis que les pères, qui n’étaient pas à l’estaminet, restaient par groupes de trois ou quatre, accroupis sur leurs talons comme au fond de la mine, fumant des pipes avec des paroles rares, à l’abri d’un mur.

She was angry, but did not go away, tickled deep down by the swear words, which made her scream, hands in the stomach. A thin woman came to his aid, her stammering anger resembling the clucking of a hen. Others, in the distance, on the doors, were startled with confidence. Now the school was closed, all the kids were hanging around, it was a swarm of little beings chirping, rolling, fighting; while the fathers, who were not at the estaminet, remained in groups of three or four, squatting on their heels as if at the bottom of the mine, smoking pipes with rare words, sheltered by a wall . La Pierronne left in a rage when Levaque tried to feel if her thigh was firm; and he himself decided to go alone to Rasseneur's, while Maheu was still planting.","The clock was striking five when La Pierronne came to see if it was Jeanlin that her Lydie had gone off with. Levaque told her that something of the sort must have happened for Bébert, too, had vanished: those little rascals were always up to no good together. Once Maheu had told them about the dandelion salad and set their minds at rest, he and his comrade began to chaff La Pierronne with crude joviality. She was cross but made no effort to leave, secretly aroused by their dirty talk, which had her clutching her stomach and screaming back at them. Help arrived in the form of a skinny-looking woman whose angry splutterings made her sound like a clucking hen. Other women, standing in their doorways at a safe distance, made a show of being scandalized. School was out now and there were small children everywhere, swarms of little creatures screaming and fighting and rolling on the ground; while their fathers, at least those who were not off drinking, gathered in groups of three or four, squatting on their heels as though they were still down the mine, and smoking their pipes in the shelter of a wall as they exchanged a desultory word. La Pierronne departed in high dudgeon when Levaque asked to see if her thighs were nice and firm, and he decided to go to Rasseneur’s on his own while Maheu got on with his planting.","Five o'clock was striking when Pierrone came to know if it was with Jeanlin that her Lydie had gone off.

She was angry, but did not go away, in reality tickled by the strong words which made her scream with her hands to her sides. A lean woman came to her aid, stammering with anger like a clucking hen. Others in the distance on their doorsteps confided their alarms. Now the school was closed; and all the children were running about, there was a swarm of little creatures shouting and tumbling and fighting; while those fathers who were not at the public-house were resting in groups of three or four, crouching on their heels as they did in the mine, smoking their pipes with an occasional word in the shelter of a wall.

"Elle avait vingt-huit ans, elle passait pour la jolie femme du coron, brune, le front bas, les yeux grands, la bouche étroite ; et coquette avec ça, d’une propreté de chatte, la gorge restée belle, car elle n’avait pas eu d’enfant. Sa mère, la Brûlé, veuve d’un haveur mort à la mine, après avoir envoyé sa fille travailler dans une fabrique, en jurant qu’elle n’épouserait jamais un charbonnier, ne décolérait plus, depuis que celle-ci s’était mariée sur le tard avec Pierron, un veuf encore, qui avait une gamine de huit ans. Cependant, le ménage vivait très heureux, au milieu des bavardages, des histoires qui couraient sur les complaisances du mari et sur les amants de la femme : pas une dette, deux fois de la viande par semaine, une maison si nettement tenue, qu’on se serait miré dans les casseroles. Pour surcroît de chance, grâce à des protections, la Compagnie l’avait autorisée à vendre des bonbons et des biscuits, dont elle étalait les bocaux sur deux planches, derrière les vitres de la fenêtre. C’étaient six ou sept sous de gain par jour, quelquefois douze le dimanche. Et, dans ce bonheur, il n’y avait que la mère Brûlé qui hurlât avec son encagement de vieille révolutionnaire, ayant à venger la mort de son homme contre les patrons, et que la petite Lydie qui empochât en gifles trop fréquentes les vivacités de la famille.","She was twenty-eight years old, she passed for the pretty woman of the settlement, dark, low forehead, large eyes, narrow mouth; and flirtatious with that, with the cleanliness of a cat, her throat still beautiful, for she had had no children. Her mother, la Brûlé, widow of a pikeman who died in the mine, after having sent her daughter to work in a factory, swearing that she would never marry a coalman, was no longer angry since she had died. married late in life to Pierron, still a widower, who had an eight-year-old girl. However, the household lived very happily, amid gossip, stories that ran about the husband's complacency and the wife's lovers: not a debt, meat twice a week, a house so neatly kept that we would have been mirrored in the saucepans. To add to her luck, thanks to protections, the Company had authorized her to sell sweets and biscuits, the jars of which she spread out on two boards, behind the panes of the window. It was six or seven sous a day, sometimes twelve on Sundays. And, in this happiness, there was only Mother Brûlé who howled with her caged old revolutionary, having to avenge the death of her man against the bosses, and only little Lydie who pocketed in too frequent slaps the vivacities of family.","She was twenty-eight and considered the prettiest woman in the village, with brown hair, a low forehead, big eyes and a small mouth – and always well turned out, as clean and dainty as a cat. Moreover, since she had not had any children she still had a fine bust. Her mother, La Bruúlé, the widow of a hewer who had been killed in the mine, had sent her daughter to work in a factory, determined that she should not marry a collier; and so she had still not got over her fury that, rather late in the day, this same daughter had gone and married Pierron, who was a widower to boot and already had a girl of eight. And yet it was a happy marriage, despite all the stories and gossip about the husband’s obliging ways and the lovers his wife had taken: they had not a penny of debt, they ate meat twice a week, and their house was so spick and span that you could have seen your face in the saucepans. As if that were not enough, they knew the right people, and the Company had authorized La Pierronne to sell sweets and biscuits, which she displayed in jars along two shelves behind her window. This made her a profit of six or seven sous a day, and sometimes twelve on Sundays. The only exceptions to this general felicity were La Bruúlé herself, a revolutionary of the old school who ranted and raved and demanded revenge on the bosses for killing her husband, and little Lydie, who got smacked rather too often as a consequence of the family’s more lively exchanges.","She was twenty-eight, and was considered the beauty of the settlement, dark, with a low forehead, large eyes, straight mouth, and coquettish as well; with the neatness of a cat, and with a good figure, for she had had no children. Her mother, Brulé, the widow of a pikeman who died in the mine, after having sent her daughter to work in a factory, swearing that she should never marry a collier, had never ceased to be angry since she had married, somewhat late, Pierron, a widower with a girl of eight. However, the household lived very happily, in the midst of chatter, of scandals which circulated concerning the husband's complaisance and the wife's lovers. No debts, meat twice a week, a house kept so clean that one could see oneself in the saucepans. As an additional piece of luck, thanks to favours, the Company had authorized her to sell bon-bons and biscuits, jars of which she exhibited, on two boards, behind the windowpanes. This was six or seven sous profit a day, and sometimes twelve on Sundays. The only drawback to all this happiness was Mother Brulé, who screamed with all the rage of an old revolutionary, having to avenge the death of her man on the masters, and little Lydie, who pocketed, in the shape of frequent blows, the passions of the family."

"– Oh ! s’il n’y avait que moi, pour ce que ça m’amuse !… C’est lui.

"Mais c’était là, dans la salle de recette, que Catherine craignait les mauvaises paroles des camarades. Justement, dès l’entrée, elle reconnut Chaval au milieu d’une vingtaine de mineurs, attendant qu’une cage fût libre. Il s’avançait furieusement vers elle, lorsque la vue d’Étienne l’arrêta. Alors, il affecta de ricaner, avec des haussements d’épaules outrageux. Très bien ! il s’en foutait, du moment que l’autre avait occupé la place toute chaude ; bon débarras ! ça regardait le monsieur, s’il aimait les restes ; et, sous l’étalage de ce dédain, il était repris d’un tremblement de jalousie, ses yeux flambaient. D’ailleurs, les camarades ne bougeaient pas, muets, les yeux baissés. Ils se contentaient de jeter un regard oblique aux nouveaux venus ; puis, abattus et sans colère, ils se remettaient à regarder fixement la bouche du puits, leur lampe à la main, grelottant sous la mince toile de leur veste, dans les courants d’air continus de la grande salle.","But it was there, in the acceptance room, that Catherine feared the bad words of her comrades. Precisely, as soon as she entered, she recognized Chaval in the midst of about twenty miners, waiting for a cage to be free. He was advancing furiously towards her, when the sight of Etienne stopped him. Then he affected to sneer, with an outrageous shrug of the shoulders. Very well ! he didn't care, as long as the other had occupied the warm place; good riddance ! it was up to the gentleman if he liked leftovers; and, under the display of this disdain, he was seized with a tremor of jealousy, his eyes blazed. Besides, the comrades did not move, silent, their eyes lowered. They contented themselves with glancing sideways at the newcomers; then, dejected and without anger, they would once again stare fixedly at the mouth of the well, their lamps in their hands, shivering under the thin fabric of their jackets, in the continuous drafts of the great hall.","But it was here, at the pit-head, that Catherine feared there would be abuse from the comrades. Sure enough, the moment they walked in she spotted Chaval in the middle of twenty or so miners waiting for an empty cage. He started walking towards her with a furious look on his face but caught sight of Étienne and stopped. Then he affected to sneer and started shrugging his shoulders in a theatrical manner. Oh, fine, fine! What did he bloody care anyway! Étienne was welcome to her, he’d warmed her up nicely for him! Good riddance! It was no skin off his nose if the gentleman preferred other people’s cast-offs! But underneath this show of contempt he was quivering with jealous rage, and his eyes blazed. In fact nobody else reacted at all, and the comrades just stood there in silence, their eyes on the ground. They merely glanced over at the new arrivals, and then, demoralized and without anger, went back to staring fixedly at the entrance to the pit-shaft, clutching their lamps and shivering in their thin cotton jackets thanks to the perpetual draughts that blew in the large hall.","But it was there, in the receiving-room, that Catherine feared the mates' bad words. At the very entrance she recognized Chaval, in the midst of some twenty miners, waiting till a cage was free. He came furiously towards her, but the sight of Étienne stopped him.

It only concerned the gentleman if he liked the leavings; and beneath the exhibition of this contempt he was again seized by a tremor of jealousy, and his eyes flamed. For the rest, the mates did not stir, standing silent, with eyes lowered. They contented themselves with casting a sidelong look at the new-comers; then, dejected and without anger, they again stared fixedly at the mouth of the shaft, with their lamps in their hands, shivering beneath their thin jackets, in the constant draughts of this large room."
"Négrel lui-même dut le calmer, très égayé de sa colère. Les écrevisses passaient toujours, on entendait les petits craquements des carapaces, pendant que la conversation tombait sur la politique.

"À la trente-deuxième échelle, comme on dépassait un troisième accrochage, Catherine sentit ses jambes et ses bras se raidir. D’abord, elle avait éprouvé à la peau des picotements légers. Maintenant, elle perdait la sensation du fer et du bois, sous les pieds et dans les mains. Une douleur vague, peu à peu cuisante, lui chauffait les muscles. Et, dans l’étourdissement qui l’envahissait, elle se rappelait les histoires du grand-père Bonnemort, du temps qu’il n’y avait pas de goyot et que des gamines de dix ans sortaient le charbon sur leurs épaules, le long des échelles plantées à nu ; si bien que, lorsqu’une d’elles glissait, ou que simplement un morceau de houille déboulait d’un panier, trois ou quatre enfants dégringolaient du coup, la tête en bas. Les crampes de ses membres devenaient insupportables, jamais elle n’irait au bout.","At the thirty-second ladder, as they passed a third collision, Catherine felt her arms and legs stiffen. First, she had felt a slight tingling of the skin. Now she was losing the feeling of iron and wood, underfoot and in her hands. A vague pain, bit by bit stinging, warmed his muscles. And, in the dizziness that overwhelmed her, she remembered the stories of Grandfather Bonnemort, of the time when there was no goyot and when ten-year-old girls took out the coal on their shoulders, along bare ladders; so that when one of them slipped, or simply a piece of coal fell from a basket, three or four children tumbled down at once, upside down. The cramps in her limbs were becoming unbearable, she would never finish.","By the thirty-second ladder, as they were passing a third loading-bay, Catherine felt her arms and legs grow stiff. At first she had sensed a slight prickling of the skin. Now she could no longer feel the wood and metal beneath her hands and feet. Her muscles ached, and the pain, slight at first, was gradually becoming more acute. In her dazed state she remembered Grandpa Bonnemort’s stories about the days when there was no proper ladder shaft and girls of ten would carry the coal up on their shoulders by means of ladders that were completely unprotected and simply placed against the wall of the shaft; so that when one of them slipped or even a piece of coal just fell out of a basket, three or four children would be sent flying, head first. The cramp was becoming unbearable, she would never make it to the top.","At the thirty-second ladder, as they passed a third landing-stage, Catherine felt her legs and arms grow stiff.

"Les heures se succédaient, toutes également noires, sans qu’ils pussent en mesurer la durée exacte, de plus en plus égarés dans le calcul du temps. Leurs tortures, qui auraient dû allonger les minutes, les emportaient, rapides. Ils croyaient n’être enfermés que depuis deux jours et une nuit, lorsqu’en réalité la troisième journée déjà se terminait. Toute espérance de secours s’en était allée, personne ne les savait là, personne n’avait le pouvoir d’y descendre, et la faim les achèverait, si l’inondation leur faisait grâce. Une dernière fois, ils avaient eu la pensée de battre le rappel ; mais la pierre était restée sous l’eau. D’ailleurs, qui les entendrait ?","The hours followed one another, all equally dark, without their being able to measure the exact duration, more and more lost in the calculation of time.

"Cependant, parmi le public, des bruits avaient transpiré, et la Direction dut envoyer une note rectificative à un journal, pour démentir une version où l’on parlait d’un baril de poudre, allumé par les grévistes. Déjà, après une rapide enquête, le rapport de l’ingénieur du gouvernement concluait à une rupture naturelle du cuvelage, que le tassement des terrains aurait occasionnée ; et la Compagnie avait préféré se taire et accepter le blâme d’un manque de surveillance. Dans la presse, à Paris, dès le troisième jour, la catastrophe était allée grossir les faits divers : on ne causait plus que des ouvriers agonisant au fond de la mine, on usait avidement les dépêches publiées chaque matin. À Montsou même, les bourgeois blêmissaient et perdaient la parole au seul nom du Voreux, une légende se formait, que les plus hardis tremblaient de se raconter à l’oreille. Tout le pays montrait aussi une grande pitié pour les victimes, des promenades s’organisaient à la fosse détruite, on y accourait en famille se donner l’horreur des décombres, pesant si lourd sur la tête des misérables ensevelis.","However, among the public, rumors had transpired, and the Management had to send a corrective note to a newspaper, to deny a version where one spoke of a barrel of powder, lit by the strikers. Already, after a quick investigation, the government engineer's report concluded that there was a natural break in the casing, which the settling of the land would have caused; and the Company had preferred to be silent and accept the blame for a lack of supervision. In the press, in Paris, from the third day, the disaster had gone to magnify the various facts: they talked only about the workers dying at the bottom of the mine, they used avidly the dispatches published each morning. In Montsou itself, the bourgeois turned pale and lost their words at the mere name of the Voreux, a legend was forming, which the boldest trembled to tell in their ears. The whole country also showed great pity for the victims, walks were organized at the destroyed grave, families ran there to marvel at the rubble, weighing so heavily on the heads of the wretched people buried.","Meanwhile rumours had spread among the general public, and the management had had to write to one newspaper correcting its version of events and denying that the strikers had exploded a barrel of gunpowder. After a rapid inquiry the report by the government-appointed engineer had already concluded that the tubbing in the pit-shaft had given way of its own accord following some subsidence in the surrounding earth; and the Company had preferred to keep quiet and accept the blame for inadequate maintenance supervision. By the third day the disaster had become one of the topical news items in the Parisian press: people talked of nothing else but the workers still fighting for their lives at the bottom of the mine, and each morning everyone avidly scanned the latest reports. In Montsou itself the bourgeois turned pale and seemed to lose the power of speech as soon as Le Voreux was mentioned, and a legend was beginning to form which even the bravest were afraid to whisper in each other’s ear. The whole region was full of pity for the victims, and people organized excursions to the demolished pit, with entire families rushing to the scene to treat themselves to the horror of its ruins and the heavy mass of debris hanging over the heads of the wretched people incarcerated below.","Among the public, however, many rumours had circulated, and the directors had to send a letter of correction to one newspaper, contradicting a story in which mention was made of a barrel of powder lighted by the strikers. After a rapid inquiry the Government inspector had concluded that there had been a natural rupture of the tubbing, occasioned by the piling up of the soil; and the Company had preferred to be silent, and to accept the blame of a lack of superintendence. In the Paris press, after the third day, the catastrophe had served to increase the stock of general news; nothing was talked of but the men perishing at the bottom of the mine, and the telegrams published every morning were eagerly read. At Montsou people grew pale and speechless at the very name of the Voreux, and a legend had formed which made the boldest tremble as they whispered it.

"Les premières semaines, Étienne l’avait trouvé d’une réserve farouche. Aussi ne connut-il son histoire que plus tard. Souvarine était le dernier-né d’une famille noble du gouvernement de Toula. À Saint-Pétersbourg, où il faisait sa médecine, la passion socialiste qui emportait alors toute la jeunesse russe l’avait décidé à apprendre un métier manuel, celui de mécanicien, pour se mêler au peuple, pour le connaître et l’aider en frère. Et c’était de ce métier qu’il vivait maintenant, après s’être enfui à la suite d’un attentat manqué contre la vie de l’empereur : pendant un mois, il avait vécu dans la cave d’un fruitier, creusant une mine au travers de la rue, chargeant des bombes, sous la continuelle menace de sauter avec la maison. Renié par sa famille, sans argent, mis comme étranger à l’index des ateliers français qui voyaient en lui un espion, il mourait de faim, lorsque la Compagnie de Montsou l’avait enfin embauché, dans une heure de presse. Depuis un an, il y travaillait en bon ouvrier, sobre, silencieux, faisant une semaine le service de jour et une semaine le service de nuit, si exact, que les chefs le citaient en exemple.","For the first few weeks, Étienne had found him fiercely reserved. So he didn't know his story until later. Souvarine was the last born of a noble family in the government of Tula. In Saint-Petersburg, where he studied medicine, the socialist passion which then carried away all the Russian youth had decided him to learn a manual trade, that of mechanic, to mingle with the people, to get to know them and help them as a brother. . And it was by this trade that he lived now, after having fled following a failed attempt on the Emperor's life: for a month he had lived in the cellar of a fruit tree, digging a mine across the street, loading bombs, under continual threat of blowing up with the house. Disowned by his family, without money, blacklisted as a foreigner by French workshops who saw him as a spy, he was starving when the Compagnie de Montsou finally hired him, in an hour of press. For a year he had worked there like a good worker, sober, silent, doing day duty for a week and night duty for a week, so exact that the chiefs cited him as an example.","During the first few weeks Étienne had found him fiercely reserved, and so it was only later that he heard the full story. Souvarine was the youngest child of a noble family in the province of Tula. While studying medicine in St Petersburg, he had been swept up in the great wave of socialist fervour just like every other young person in Russia and decided to learn a manual skill instead. Thus he became a mechanic, so that he could mix with the common people and get to know them and help them as one of their own. And this was how he now earned his living, having fled after a failed assassination attempt on the Tsar:1 for a month he had lived in a greengrocer’s cellar while he dug a tunnel under the street and primed his bombs at constant risk of blowing the house up and himself with it. Disowned by his family, penniless, and blacklisted as a foreigner in French workshops where he was suspected of being a spy, he had been dying of hunger when the Montsou Mining Company had eventually taken him on during a labour shortage. For a year now he had shown himself to be a good worker, sober, quiet, doing the day shift one week and the night shift the next, and always so reliable that the bosses cited him as a model.","During the first weeks, Étienne had found him timid and reserved, so that he only discovered his history later on. Souvarine was the latest born of a noble family in the Government of Tula. At St. Petersburg, where he studied medicine, the socialistic enthusiasm which then carried away all the youth in Russia had decided him to learn a manual trade, that of a mechanic, so that he could mix with the people, in order to know them and help them as a brother. And it was by this trade that he was now living after having fled, in consequence of an unsuccessful attempt against the tsar's life: for a month he had lived in a fruiterer's cellar, hollowing out a mine underneath the road, and charging bombs, with the constant risk of being blown up with the house. Renounced by his family, without money, expelled from the French workshops as a foreigner who was regarded as a spy, he was dying of starvation when the Montsou Company had at last taken him on at a moment of pressure. For a year he had laboured there as a good, sober, silent workman, doing day-work one week and night-work the next week, so regularly that the masters referred to him as an example to the others."
"Maheu, l’après-midi, travailla dans son jardin. Déjà il y avait semé des pommes de terre, des haricots, des pois ; et il tenait en jauge, depuis la veille, du plant de choux et de laitue, qu’il se mit à repiquer. Ce coin de jardin les fournissait de légumes, sauf de pommes de terre, dont ils n’avaient jamais assez. Du reste, lui s’entendait très bien à la culture et obtenait même des artichauts, ce qui était traité de pose par les voisins, Comme il préparait sa planche, Levaque justement vint fumer une pipe dans son carré à lui, en regardant des romaines que Bouteloup avait plantées le matin ; car, sans le courage du logeur à bêcher, il n’aurait guère poussé là que des orties. Et la conversation s’engagea par-dessus le treillage. Levaque, délassé et excité d’avoir tapé sur sa femme, tâcha vainement d’entraîner Maheu chez Rasseneur. Voyons, est-ce qu’une chope l’effrayait ? On ferait une partie de quilles, on flânerait un instant avec les camarades, puis on rentrerait dîner. C’était la vie, après la sortie de la fosse. Sans doute il n’y avait pas de mal à cela, mais Maheu s’entêtait : s’il ne repiquait pas ses laitues, elles seraient fanées le lendemain. Au fond, il refusait par sagesse, ne voulant point demander un liard à sa femme sur le reste des cent sous.","Maheu, in the afternoon, worked in his garden. He had already sown potatoes, beans, peas; and he had kept a gauge, since the day before, of a seedling of cabbage and lettuce, which he began to transplant. This corner of the garden provided them with vegetables, except potatoes, of which they never had enough. Besides, he got along very well with farming and even got artichokes, which the neighbors called laying. that Bouteloup had planted in the morning; for, had it not been for the landlord's courage in digging, nothing but nettles would have grown there. And the conversation began over the trellis. Levaque, relaxed and excited at having hit his wife, tried in vain to drag Maheu to Rasseneur's. Come on, did a mug scare him? We'd have a game of bowling, we'd hang out with our comrades for a moment, then we'd go home to dinner. That was life after coming out of the pit. No doubt there was nothing wrong with that, but Maheu was stubborn: if he did not transplant his lettuces, they would be wilted the next day. Basically, he refused out of wisdom, not wanting to ask his wife for a farthing on the rest of the hundred sous.","That afternoon Maheu worked in his garden. He had already sown his potatoes, beans and peas; and he began to put in some cabbage and lettuce plants that he had heeled in the day before. This little patch of garden provided them with all the vegetables they needed, except for potatoes, of which there were never enough. He was good at gardening as it happened and even managed to grow artichokes, which his neighbours regarded as showing off. While he was preparing his bed, Levaque had chosen that moment to come and smoke his pipe in his own patch, and he was now inspecting the romaine lettuce which Bouteloup had planted that morning; for if it hadn’t been for the lodger’s determination with the spade, there would have been nothing but nettles growing there. And so they began to chat across the trellis fence. Refreshed and invigorated after beating his wife, Levaque tried unsuccessfully to drag Maheu off to Rasseneur’s. Come on, one pint wouldn’t do him any harm, would it? They could have a game of skittles, wander round with the comrades for a bit, and then come home for their dinner. This was what people generally did after work, and no doubt there wasn’t any harm in it, but Maheu stubbornly refused: if he didn’t get his lettuce plants in, they’d have withered by the next day. In fact he was being good: he didn’t want to ask his wife for a single sou out of what she had left of the hundred she’d borrowed.","""Try not to dawdle about at night on the road."" In the afternoon, Maheu worked in his garden. Already he had sown there potatoes, beans, and peas; and he now set about replanting cabbage and lettuce plants, which he had kept fresh from the night before. This bit of garden furnished them with vegetables, except potatoes of which they never had enough. He understood gardening very well, and could even grow artichokes, which was treated as sheer display by the neighbours. As he was preparing the bed, Levaque just then came out to smoke a pipe in his own square, looking at the cos lettuces which Bouteloup had planted in the morning; for without the lodger's energy in digging nothing would have grown there but nettles. And a conversation arose over the trellis. Levaque, refreshed and excited by thrashing his wife, vainly tried to take Maheu off to Rasseneur's. Why, was he afraid of a glass? They could have a game at skittles, lounge about for a while with the mates, and then come back to dinner. That was the way of life after leaving the pit. No doubt there was no harm in that, but Maheu was obstinate; if he did not replant his lettuces they would be faded by to-morrow. In reality he refused out of good sense, not wishing to ask a farthing from his wife out of the change of the five-franc piece."

"Depuis un instant, Chaval, debout, les regardait de loin. Il s’avança, s’assura que Maheu ne pouvait le voir ; et, comme Catherine était restée à terre, sur son séant, il l’empoigna par les épaules, lui renversa la tête, lui écrasa la bouche sous un baiser brutal, tranquillement, en affectant de ne pas se préoccuper d’Étienne. Il y avait, dans ce baiser, une prise de possession, une sorte de décision jalouse.","For a moment Chaval, standing, had been watching them from afar. He advanced, made sure that Maheu could not see him; and, as Catherine remained on the ground, sitting up, he seized her by the shoulders, threw back her head, crushed her mouth in a brutal kiss, calmly, affecting not to trouble himself about Etienne. There was, in this kiss, a taking possession, a kind of jealous decision.","For some moments Chaval had been standing watching them from a distance. He came forward and, making sure that Maheu couldn’t see him, grabbed Catherine by the shoulders where she sat, pulled her head back and pressed a brutal kiss down on to her lips, matter-of-factly and seemingly unaware of Étienne’s presence. This kiss constituted an act of taking possession, and a decision born of jealousy.","For a moment Chaval stood and looked at them from afar. He came forward, having assured himself that Maheu could not see him; and as Catherine was seated on the earth he seized her by the shoulders, drew her head back, and tranquilly crushed her mouth beneath a brutal kiss, affecting not to notice Étienne. There was in that kiss an act of possession, a sort of jealous resolution."

"Ce dimanche-là, dès cinq heures, on dansait, au plein jour des fenêtres. Mais ce fut vers sept heures que les salles s’emplirent. Dehors, un vent d’orage s’était levé, soufflant de grandes poussières noires, qui aveuglaient le monde et grésillaient dans les poêles de friture. Maheu, Étienne et Pierron, entrés pour s’asseoir, venaient de retrouver au Bon-Joyeux Chaval, dansant avec Catherine, tandis que Philomène, toute seule, les regardait. Ni Levaque ni Zacharie n’avaient reparu. Comme il n’y avait pas de bancs autour du bal, Catherine, après chaque danse, se reposait à la table de son père. On appela Philomène, mais elle était mieux debout. Le jour tombait, les trois musiciens faisaient rage, on ne voyait plus, dans la salle, que le remuement des hanches et des gorges, au milieu d’une confusion de bras. Un vacarme accueillit les quatre lampes, et brusquement tout s’éclaira, les faces rouges, les cheveux dépeignés, collés à la peau, les jupes volantes, balayant l’odeur forte des couples en sueur. Maheu montra à Étienne la Mouquette, qui, ronde et grasse comme une vessie de saindoux, tournait violemment aux bras d’un grand moulineur maigre : elle avait dû se consoler et prendre un homme.","That Sunday, from five o'clock, there was dancing, in broad daylight from the windows. But it was around seven o'clock that the halls filled up. Outside, a stormy wind had risen, blowing great black dust, which blinded the world and sizzled in the frying pans. Maheu, Étienne and Pierron, who had come in to take their seats, had just found Chaval at the Bon-Joyeux, dancing with Catherine, while Philomène, all alone, watched them. Neither Levaque nor Zacharie had reappeared. As there were no benches around the ball, Catherine, after each dance, rested at her father's table. They called Philomene, but she was better on her feet. Day was falling, the three musicians were raging, all that was seen in the hall was the movement of hips and throats, in the midst of a confusion of arms. A din greeted the four lamps, and suddenly everything lit up, the red faces, the disheveled hair stuck to the skin, the flying skirts, sweeping away the strong odor of sweating couples. Maheu showed Etienne la Mouquette, who, plump and plump like a bladder of lard, was turning violently in the arms of a tall, thin grinder: she must have consoled herself and taken a man.","That Sunday there was dancing from five o’clock onwards, when daylight was still streaming through the windows. But it was nearer seven by the time the rooms filled up with people. Outside a storm was gathering: the wind had got up and was stirring large clouds of black dust, which got into everybody’s eyes and sizzled in the frying-pans. Maheu, Étienne and Pierron had come to the Jolly Fellow in search of somewhere to sit and found Chaval dancing with Catherine while Philomène stood watching on her own. Neither Levaque nor Zacharie had reappeared. Since there were no benches round the dance-floor, Catherine came and sat at her father’s table between dances. They called Philomène over, but she said she preferred to stand. The light was fading, the musicians were in full swing, and all that could be seen was a flurry of hips and busts and a general flailing of arms. There was a roar when the four lamps arrived, and suddenly everything was lit up, the red faces, the tumbling hair clinging to wet skin, the swirling skirts fanning the air with the pungent smell of sweating couples. Maheu drew Étienne’s attention to La Mouquette, round and plump like a bladder of lard, who was gyrating wildly in the arms of a tall, thin banksman. She must have decided to make do with someone else.","On this Sunday there was dancing from five o'clock with the full daylight through the windows, but it was not until towards seven that the rooms began to fill. Outside, a gale was rising, blowing great black showers of dust which blinded people and sleeted into the fryingpans. Maheu, Étienne, and Pierron, having come in to sit down, had found Chaval at the Bon-Joyeux dancing with Catherine, while Philoméne by herself was looking on. Neither Levaque nor Zacharie had reappeared. As there were no benches around the ball-room, Catherine came after each dance to rest at her father's table. They called Philoméne, but she preferred to stand up. The twilight was coming on; the three musicians played furiously; one could only see in the hall the movement of hips and breasts in the midst of a confusion of arms. The appearance of the four lamps was greeted noisily, and suddenly everything was lit up--the red faces, the dishevelled hair sticking to the skin, the flying skirts spreading abroad the strong odour of perspiring couples. Maheu pointed out Mouquette to Étienne: she was as round and greasy as a bladder of lard, revolving violently in the arms of a tall, lean lander. She had been obliged to console herself and take a man."
"Maintenant, le coron entier était dehors. La curiosité des femmes montait, les groupes se rapprochaient, se fondaient en une foule ; tandis que des bandes de marmaille mal mouchée traînaient sur les trottoirs, bouche béante.

Elle le croyait avec cette fille, comme le bruit en courait depuis quinze jours ; et, quand il lui jura que non, elle hocha la tête, elle rappela le soir où elle les avait vus se baiser à pleine bouche.","It was Mouquette she was talking about. She believed him to be with this girl, as rumor had been circulating for a fortnight; and, when he swore no, she shook her head, she recalled the evening when she had seen them kiss each other openly.","She meant La Mouquette. She thought he was going with her because that had been the rumour for the past fortnight; and when he swore to Catherine that he wasn’t, she just shook her head, recalling the evening she’d seen them kissing each other on the mouth.","She meant Mouquette. She believed that he still went with this girl, as the rumour ran for the last fortnight; and when he swore to her that it was not so she shook her head, for she remembered the evening when she had seen them eagerly kissing each other."

"– C’est à cause de maman que ça m’ennuie d’avoir été mis à la rue, dit-il après avoir avalé une bouchée. Maman n’est pas heureuse, et je lui envoyais de temps à autre une pièce de cent sous.","“It’s because of mom that it bothers me to have been kicked out,” he says after swallowing a bite. Mom is not happy, and I sent her a hundred-sou piece from time to time.","‘But it’s because of Mother that I’m fed up at being sacked,’ he said, having swallowed a mouthful of bread. ‘ She’s not in a good way, and I used to be able to send her a five-franc piece from time to time.’","""It is because of mother that I didn't like being turned into the street,"" he said, after having swallowed a mouthful. "" Mother is not happy, and I used to send her a five-franc piece now and then."""
"Mouquette trouvait ça drôle, se tenait le ventre. Mais Étienne, gêné, s’en alla, tandis que Catherine lui souriait. Comme tous trois retournaient à l’accrochage, Bébert et Jeanlin y arrivaient aussi, avec un train de berlines. Il y eut un arrêt pour la manœuvre des cages, et la jeune fille s’approcha de leur cheval, le caressa de la main, en parlant de lui à son compagnon. C’était Bataille, le doyen de la mine, un cheval blanc qui avait dix ans de fond. Depuis dix ans, il vivait dans ce trou, occupant le même coin de l’écurie, faisant la même tâche le long des galeries noires, sans avoir jamais revu le jour. Très gras, le poil luisant, l’air bonhomme, il semblait y couler une existence de sage, à l’abri des malheurs de là-haut. Du reste, dans les ténèbres, il était devenu d’une grande malignité. La voie où il travaillait avait fini par lui être si familière, qu’il poussait de la tête les portes d’aérage, et qu’il se baissait, afin de ne pas se cogner, aux endroits trop bas. Sans doute aussi il comptait ses tours, car lorsqu’il avait fait le nombre réglementaire de voyages, il refusait d’en recommencer un autre, on devait le reconduire à sa mangeoire. Maintenant, l’âge venait, ses yeux de chat se voilaient parfois d’une mélancolie. Peut-être revoyait-il vaguement, au fond de ses rêvasseries obscures, le moulin où il était né, près de Marchiennes, un moulin planté sur le bord de la Scarpe, entouré de larges verdures, toujours éventé par le vent. Quelque chose brûlait en l’air, une lampe énorme, dont le souvenir exact échappait à sa mémoire de bête. Et il restait la tête basse, tremblant sur ses vieux pieds, faisant d’inutiles efforts pour se rappeler le soleil.","Mouquette found it funny, held her stomach. But Étienne, embarrassed, went away, while Catherine smiled at him. As all three were returning to the collision, Bébert and Jeanlin also arrived there, with a train of sedans. There was a stop for the maneuvering of the cages, and the young girl approached their horse, stroked it with her hand, speaking of him to her companion. It was Bataille, the dean of the mine, a white horse who was ten years old. For ten years he had lived in this hole, occupying the same corner of the stable, doing the same task along the black galleries, without ever seeing daylight again. Very fat, with shiny hair, a good-natured air, he seemed to be living a wise existence there, sheltered from the misfortunes of up there. Moreover, in the darkness, he had become very malicious. The way he worked had ended up being so familiar to him that he pushed open the ventilation doors with his head, and ducked down so as not to bump into places that were too low. No doubt he also counted his turns, for when he had made the prescribed number of trips, he refused to start another one, they had to take him back to his manger. Now, age was coming, her cat's eyes sometimes clouded with melancholy. Perhaps he vaguely saw again, in the depths of his obscure reveries, the mill where he was born, near Marchiennes, a mill planted on the edge of the Scarpe, surrounded by wide greenery, always fanned by the wind. Something was burning in the air, an enormous lamp, the exact memory of which escaped his animal memory. And he remained with his head bowed, trembling on his old feet, making useless efforts to remember the sun.","La Mouquette thought this hilarious and laughed helplessly. But Étienne was embarrassed and left, while Catherine simply gave him a smile. Just as the three of them were making their way back to pit-bottom, Bébert and Jeanlin also arrived on the scene, bringing a tub-train. There was a pause as the tubs were loaded into the cage, and Catherine went up to their horse and stroked it as she told her companion all about him. This was Battle, a white horse with ten years’ service2 and something of an elder statesman. He had spent the ten years down the mine, occupying the same corner of the stable and doing the same job every day up and down the roadways; and not once in that time had he seen daylight. Very fat, with a gleaming coat and a good-natured air, he seemed to be living the life of a sage, sheltered from the misfortunes of the world above. Moreover, down here in the darkness, he had become very crafty. The roadway in which he worked had now grown so familiar to him that he could push the ventilation doors open with his head, and he knew where to stoop and avoid getting bumped at the places where the roof was too low. He must have counted his journeys too because when he had completed the regulation number, he flatly refused to start another and had to be led back to his manger. Old age was now approaching, and his cat-like eyes sometimes clouded over with a look of sadness. Perhaps he could dimly remember the mill where he had been born, near Marchiennes, on the banks of the Scarpe, a mill surrounded by broad expanses of greenery and constantly swept by the wind. There had been something else, too, something burning away up in the air, some huge lamp or other, but his animal memory could not quite recall its exact nature. And he would stand there unsteadily on his old legs, head bowed, vainly trying to remember the sun.","Mouquette thought it funny, and held her sides. But Étienne, feeling awkward, moved away, while Catherine smiled at him. As all three returned to the pit-eye, Bébert and Jeanlin arrived there also with a train of tubs. There was a stoppage for the manoeuvring of the cages, and the young girl approached their horse, caressed it with her hand, and talked about it to her companion. It was Bataille, the doyen of the mine, a white horse who had lived below for ten years. These ten years he had lived in this hole, occupying the same corner of the stable, doing the same task along the black galleries without every seeing daylight. Very fat, with shining coat and a good-natured air, he seemed to lead the existence of a sage, sheltered from the evils of the world above. In this darkness, too, he had become very cunning. The passage in which he worked had grown so familiar to him that he could open the ventilation doors with his head, and he lowered himself to avoid knocks at the narrow spots. Without doubt, also, he counted his turns, for when he had made the regulation number of journeys he refused to do any more, and had to be led back to his manger. Now that old age was coming on, his cat's eyes were sometimes dimmed with melancholy. Perhaps he vaguely saw again, in the depths of his obscure dreams, the mill at which he was born, near Marchiennes, a mill placed on the edge of the Scarpe, surrounded by large fields over which the wind always blew. Something burnt in the air--an enormous lamp, the exact appearance of which escaped his beast's memory--and he stood with lowered head, trembling on his old feet, making useless efforts to recall the sun."

"À ce moment, l’ingénieur Négrel et Dansaert, prévenus enfin, arrivèrent avec Richomme. Le premier écoutait le récit du porion, d’un air exaspéré. Il éclata : toujours ces maudits boisages ! n’avait-il pas répété cent fois qu’on y laisserait des hommes ! et ces brutes-là qui parlaient de se mettre en grève, si on les forçait à boiser plus solidement ! Le pis était que la Compagnie, maintenant, paierait les pots cassés. M. Hennebeau allait être content !","At this moment, the engineer Négrel and Dansaert, warned at last, arrived with Richomme.

Négrel listened to the deputy’s report with growing exasperation. He exploded: it was always the damned timbering! If he’d said it once, he’d said it a hundred times: men would die! And now the brutes were talking about going on strike if anyone forced them to timber properly! The worst of it was that this time the Company would have to pay for the damage itself.

"Après avoir suivi péniblement des cours de l’École des mines, il était, à vingt-quatre ans, parti pour la Grand-Combe, comme ingénieur du puits Sainte-Barbe. Trois ans plus tard, il devint ingénieur divisionnaire, dans le Pas-de-Calais, aux fosses de Marles ; et ce fut là qu’il se maria, épousant, par un de ces coups de fortune qui sont la règle pour le corps des mines, la fille d’un riche filateur d’Arras. Pendant quinze années, le ménage habita la même petite ville de province, sans qu’un événement rompît la monotonie de son existence, pas même la naissance d’un enfant. Une irritation croissante détachait Mme Hennebeau, élevée dans le respect de l’argent, dédaigneuse de ce mari qui gagnait durement des appointements médiocres, et dont elle ne tirait aucune des satisfactions vaniteuses, rêvées en pension. Lui, d’une honnêteté stricte, ne spéculait point, se tenait à son poste, en soldat. Le désaccord n’avait fait que grandir, aggravé par un de ces singuliers malentendus de la chair qui glacent les plus ardents : il adorait sa femme, elle était d’une sensualité de blonde gourmande, et déjà ils couchaient à part, mal à l’aise, tout de suite blessés. Elle eut dès lors un amant, qu’il ignora. Enfin, il quitta le Pas-de-Calais, pour venir occuper à Paris une situation de bureau, dans l’idée qu’elle lui en serait reconnaissante. Mais Paris devait achever la séparation, ce Paris qu’elle souhaitait depuis sa première poupée, et où elle se lava en huit jours de sa province, élégante d’un coup, jetée à toutes les folies luxueuses de l’époque. Les dix ans qu’elle y passa furent emplis par une grande passion, une liaison publique avec un homme, dont l’abandon faillit la tuer. Cette fois, le mari n’avait pu garder son ignorance, et il se résigna, à la suite de scènes abominables, désarmé devant la tranquille inconscience de cette femme, qui prenait son bonheur où elle le trouvait. C’était après la rupture, lorsqu’il l’avait vue malade de chagrin, qu’il avait accepté la direction des mines de Montsou, espérant encore la corriger là-bas, dans ce désert des pays noirs.","After having painfully followed courses at the School of Mines, he had left for Grand-Combe at the age of twenty-four, as an engineer at the Sainte-Barbe pit. Three years later, he became a divisional engineer, in the Pas-de-Calais, at the Marles pits; and it was there that he married, marrying, by one of those strokes of fortune which are the rule for the corps des mines, the daughter of a rich spinner of Arras. For fifteen years, the couple lived in the same little provincial town, without an event breaking the monotony of their existence, not even the birth of a child. A growing irritation detached Madame Hennebeau, brought up to respect money, disdainful of this husband who earned a mediocre salary the hard way, and from whom she derived none of the vain satisfactions dreamed of at boarding school. He, strictly honest, did not speculate, kept to his post, like a soldier. The disagreement had only grown, aggravated by one of those singular misunderstandings of the flesh which freeze the most ardent: he adored his wife, she was of the sensuality of a greedy blonde, and already they slept apart, ill at ease. ease, immediately hurt. She then had a lover, whom he ignored. Finally, he left the Pas-de-Calais, to come to Paris to occupy an office position, in the idea that she would be grateful to him. But Paris was to complete the separation, this Paris that she had wanted since her first doll, and where she washed herself in a week of her province, suddenly elegant, thrown into all the luxurious follies of the time. The ten years she spent there were filled with a great passion, a public affair with a man, whose abandonment nearly killed her. This time, the husband had not been able to keep his ignorance, and he resigned himself, following abominable scenes, disarmed before the quiet unconsciousness of this woman, who took her happiness where she found it. It was after the breakup, when he had seen her sick with grief, that he had accepted the management of the Montsou mines, still hoping to correct her there, in this desert of the black countries.","After several years of arduous study at the École des Mines2 he had left at the age of twenty-four for La Grand ’Combe,3 where he had been appointed engineer at the Sainte-Barbe pit. Three years later he became divisional engineer at the Marles collieries in the Pas-de-Calais; and there, by one of those strokes of good fortune which seem to be the rule for graduates of the École des Mines, he married the daughter of a rich spinning-mill owner from Arras. For fifteen years the couple lived in the same small provincial town, and not a single noteworthy event broke the monotony of their lives, not even the birth of a child. A growing irritation began to distance Mme Hennebeau from her husband, for she had been brought up to respect money and she looked down on this man who worked hard to earn a paltry salary and who had brought her none of the vain gratifications she had dreamed of as a schoolgirl. He, a man of strict integrity, never took financial risks and merely did his job, sticking to his post like a soldier. The gulf between them had quite simply grown wider and wider, exacerbated by one of those curious instances of physical incompatibility that can cool even the warmest ardour: he adored his wife, and she had the sensuality of the voluptuous blonde, and yet already they had ceased to share a bed, both of them ill at ease with the other and quick to take offence. Unbeknownst to him, she then took a lover. Eventually he left the Pas-de-Calais for a desk job in Paris, hoping that this would make her grateful to him. But Paris drove them apart completely, for this was the Paris she had dreamed of ever since she had played with her first doll and where she now sloughed off her provincial existence in the space of a single week, becoming all at once the woman of fashion in pursuit of every latest foolish luxury. The ten years she spent there were filled by one great passion, a public liaison with a man whose abandonment of her nearly destroyed her. This time her husband had been unable to remain in ignorance of the facts, and after many terrible scenes he resigned himself to the situation, powerless in the face of the total lack of remorse shown by this woman who took her pleasure where she found it. It was following the end of this affair, when he saw how ill her unhappiness was making her, that he had accepted the job as manager of the Montsou mines, hoping that up there in that black wilderness he might yet manage to make her mend her ways.","After having painfully followed the courses of the École des Mines, at the age of twenty-four he had gone to the Grand'Combe as engineer to the Sainte-Barbe mine.

"Pendant un quart d’heure encore, il réfléchit, toujours ravagé par la même lutte, les yeux fixés sur cette mèche qui brûlait. Mais il y eut un grésillement, la mèche se noyait, et tout retomba aux ténèbres. Il fut repris d’un frisson, il aurait giflé Jeanlin, pour l’empêcher de ronfler si fort. Le voisinage de l’enfant lui devenait si insupportable, qu’il se sauva, tourmenté d’un besoin de grand air, se hâtant par les galeries et par le goyot, comme s’il avait entendu une ombre s’essouffler derrière ses talons.","For another quarter of an hour he reflected, still ravaged by the same struggle, his eyes fixed on that burning wick. But there was a crackling, the wick drowned, and everything fell back into darkness. He shivered again, he would have slapped Jeanlin, to prevent him from snoring so loudly.

Then there was a sizzling sound, the wick drowned in wax, and everything was once more plunged into darkness. His shudders returned, and he felt like hitting Jeanlin to stop him snoring so loudly. The proximity of the boy became so intolerable that he fled, filled with a desperate need for fresh air, and rushed through the roadways and up the shaft as though he could hear a ghost panting at his heels.","For another quarter of an hour he reflected, still absorbed in the same struggle, his eyes fixed on the burning wick. But there was a spluttering, the wick was going out, and everything fell back into darkness. He shuddered again; he could have boxed Jeanlin's ears, to keep him from snoring so loudly.

"Les regards d’Étienne remontaient du canal au coron, bâti sur le plateau, et dont il distinguait seulement les tuiles rouges. Puis, ils revenaient vers le Voreux, s’arrêtaient, en bas de la pente argileuse, à deux énormes tas de briques, fabriquées et cuites sur place. Un embranchement du chemin de fer de la Compagnie passait derrière une palissade, desservant la fosse. On devait descendre les derniers mineurs de la coupe à terre. Seul, un wagon que poussaient des hommes, jetait un cri aigu. Ce n’était plus l’inconnu des ténèbres, les tonnerres inexplicables, les flamboiements d’astres ignorés. Au loin, les hauts fourneaux et les fours à coke avaient pâli avec l’aube. Il ne restait là, sans un arrêt, que l’échappement de la pompe, soufflant toujours de la même haleine grosse et longue, l’haleine d’un ogre dont il distinguait la buée grise maintenant, et que rien ne pouvait repaître.","Etienne's gaze went up from the canal to the settlement, built on the plateau, and of which he could only make out the red tiles. Then, they returned towards the Voreux, stopped, at the bottom of the clay slope, at two huge piles of bricks, made and baked on the spot. A branch of the Company's railroad passed behind a palisade, serving the pit. We had to lower the last miners of the cup to the ground. Alone, a wagon pushed by men uttered a shrill cry. It was no longer the unknown darkness, the inexplicable thunders, the blazes of unknown stars. In the distance, the blast furnaces and coke ovens had paled with the dawn. All that remained there, without stopping, was the exhaust from the pump, still blowing with the same big, long breath, the breath of an ogre whose gray mist he could now make out, and which nothing could feed on.","Étienne’s gaze travelled from the canal back up to the village, which had been built on a plateau, but he could make out only the red tiles of the roofs. Then it moved back down towards Le Voreux and came to rest at the bottom of the muddy slope, lingering on two enormous piles of bricks which had been cast and baked on site. Here a branch of the Company’s railway line passed behind a fence and led into the pit. By now the last batch of stonemen would be going down. A solitary wagon being pushed by some workmen gave a piercing screech. But the darkness and the mystery had gone, and with them the inexplicable rumblings and the sudden flaring of unfamiliar stars. In the distance the tall blast-furnaces and the coke-ovens had been pale since dawn. All that remained from before was the ceaseless panting of the drainage-pump; but as he listened to the long, deep gasps of the ogre whose hunger could never be satisfied, this time he could see the grey steam rising.","Étienne's glance went up from the canal to the settlement built on the height, of which he could only distinguish the red tiles. Then his eyes rested again at the bottom of the clay slope, towards the Voreux, on two enormous masses of bricks made and burnt on the spot. A branch of the Company's railroad passed behind a paling, for the use of the pit. They must be sending down the last miners to the earth-cutting. Only one shrill note came from a truck pushed by men. One felt no longer the unknown darkness, the inexplicable thunder, the flaming of mysterious stars. Afar, the blast furnaces and the coke kilns had paled with the dawn. There only remained, unceasingly, the escapement of the pump, always breathing with the same thick, long breath, the ogre's breath of which he could now see the grey steam, and which nothing could satiate."

"On l’applaudit furieusement à son tour, et dès lors Étienne lui-même fut débordé. Des orateurs se succédaient sur le tronc d’arbre, gesticulant dans le bruit, lançant des propositions farouches. C’était le coup de folie de la foi, l’impatience d’une secte religieuse, qui, lasse d’espérer le miracle attendu, se décidait à le provoquer enfin. Les têtes, vidées par la famine, voyaient rouge, rêvaient d’incendie et de sang, au milieu d’une gloire d’apothéose, où montait le bonheur universel. Et la lune tranquille baignait cette houle, la forêt profonde ceignait de son grand silence ce cri de massacre. Seules, les mousses gelées craquaient sous les talons ; tandis que les hêtres, debout dans leur force, avec les délicates ramures de leurs branches, noires sur le ciel blanc, n’apercevaient ni n’entendaient les êtres misérables, qui s’agitaient à leur pied.","He was applauded furiously in his turn, and from then on Étienne himself was overwhelmed.

Heads, emptied by famine, saw red, dreamed of fire and blood, in the midst of a glory of apotheosis, where universal happiness rose. And the quiet moon bathed this swell, the deep forest surrounded with its great silence this cry of massacre. Only the frozen moss creaked under the heels; while the beeches, upright in their strength, with the delicate branches of their branches, black against the white sky, neither saw nor heard the wretched beings who moved at their feet.","He in turn was furiously applauded, and from then on even Étienne was overrun.

Minds emptied of all thought by hunger now saw red and dreamed of burning and killing, of a glorious apotheosis that would usher in the dawn of universal happiness. Meanwhile the quiet moon bathed the heaving mass of people in its light, and the thick forest cast a deep ring of silence around their murderous cries. The only other sound was the continued crunch of frozen moss as it was trampled underfoot; and the beech trees simply stood there, strong and tall, the delicate tracery of their branches etched in black against the pallor of the sky, and they neither saw nor heard the commotion of these wretched beings at their feet.","He was furiously applauded in his turn, and now Étienne himself was outflanked.

"C’était Bataille. En partant de l’accrochage, il avait galopé le long des galeries noires, éperdument. Il semblait connaître son chemin, dans cette ville souterraine, qu’il habitait depuis onze années ; et ses yeux voyaient clair, au fond de l’éternelle nuit où il avait vécu. Il galopait, il galopait, priant la tête, ramassant les pieds, filant par ces boyaux minces de la terre, emplis de son grand corps. Les rues se succédaient, les carrefours ouvraient leur fourche, sans qu’il hésitât. Où allait-il ? là-bas peut-être, à cette vision de sa jeunesse, au moulin où il était né, sur le bord de la Scarpe, au souvenir confus du soleil, brûlant en l’air comme une grosse lampe. Il voulait vivre, sa mémoire de bête s’éveillait, l’envie de respirer encore de l’air des plaines le poussait droit devant lui, jusqu’à ce qu’il eût découvert le trou, la sortie sous le ciel chaud, dans la lumière. Et une révolte emportait sa résignation ancienne, cette fosse l’assassinait, après l’avoir aveuglé. L’eau, qui le poursuivait, le fouettait aux cuisses, le mordait à la croupe. Mais à mesure qu’il s’enfonçait, les galeries devenaient plus étroites, abaissant le toit, renflant le mur. Il galopait quand même, il s’écorchait, laissait aux boisages des lambeaux de ses membres. De toutes parts, la mine semblait se resserrer sur lui, pour le prendre et l’étouffer.","It was Battle. Starting from the collision, he had galloped along the black galleries, madly. He seemed to know his way, in this underground city, which he had lived for eleven years; and his eyes saw clearly, in the depths of the eternal night in which he had lived. He galloped, he galloped, praying his head, picking up his feet, darting through these thin trenches of the earth, filled with his great body. The streets followed one another, the crossroads opened their forks, without his hesitation. Where was he going? over there perhaps, at this vision of his youth, at the mill where he was born, on the edge of the Scarpe, at the confused memory of the sun, burning in the air like a big lamp. He wanted to live, his animal memory was waking up, the desire to still breathe the air of the plains drove him straight ahead, until he had discovered the hole, the exit under the hot sky, in the light. And a revolt swept away his ancient resignation, this pit murdered him, after having blinded him. The water, which pursued him, whipped him in the thighs, bit him in the rump. But as it sank, the galleries became narrower, lowering the roof, swelling the wall. He galloped all the same, he scratched himself, leaving shreds of his limbs on the woodwork. From all sides, the mine seemed to close in on him, to seize him and smother him.","It was Battle. After leaving the loading area he had been galloping along the dark roadways in a state of panic. He seemed to know his way round this underground city which had been his home for the past eleven years; and he could see perfectly clearly in the never-ending blackness that had been his life. On and on he galloped, ducking his head and picking up his feet, racing along the earth’s narrow entrails and filling them with his own large body. Turning after turning came and went, paths would fork, but he never once hesitated. Where was he heading? Towards some yonder horizon perhaps, towards his vision of younger days, the mill where he was born on the banks of the Scarpe, and a distant memory of the sun burning up above like a lamp. He wanted to live, and his animal memories were stirring; he longed to breathe the air of the plains once more, and it drove him on, on towards the hole in the ground that would lead out into the light beneath a warm sky. And all his old docility was swept away by a new spirit of rebellion against a pit that had first taken away his sight and now sought to kill him. The water was pursuing him, whipping his flanks and nagging at his quarters. But the further he went the narrower the roadways became, as the roof became lower and the sides began to bulge inwards. But he galloped on none the less, grazing against the walls and leaving tatters of flesh on the timber props. It was as though the mine were pressing in on him from every side, trying to capture him and crush the life out of him.","It was Bataille. On leaving the pit-eye he had wildly galloped along the dark galleries.

"Alors, debout, le prêtre parla longuement. Il exploitait la grève, cette misère affreuse, cette rancune exaspérée de la faim, avec l’ardeur d’un missionnaire qui prêche des sauvages, pour la gloire de sa religion. Il disait que l’Église était avec les pauvres, qu’elle ferait un jour triompher la justice, en appelant la colère de Dieu sur les iniquités des riches. Et ce jour luirait bientôt, car les riches avaient pris la place de Dieu, en étaient arrivés à gouverner sans Dieu, dans leur vol impie du pouvoir. Mais, si les ouvriers voulaient le juste partage des biens de la terre, ils devaient s’en remettre tout de suite aux mains des prêtres, comme à la mort de Jésus les petits et les humbles s’étaient groupés autour des apôtres. Quelle force aurait le pape, de quelle armée disposerait le clergé, lorsqu’il commanderait à la foule innombrable des travailleurs ! En une semaine, on purgerait le monde des méchants, on chasserait les maîtres indignes, ce serait enfin le vrai règne de Dieu, chacun récompensé selon ses mérites, la loi du travail réglant le bonheur universel.","Then, standing, the priest spoke at length. He exploited the strike, that dreadful misery, that exasperated rancor of hunger, with the ardor of a missionary who preaches to savages, for the glory of his religion. He said that the Church was with the poor, that she would one day make justice triumph, by calling down the wrath of God on the iniquities of the rich. And that day would soon dawn, for the rich had taken the place of God, had come to rule without God, in their ungodly theft of power. But, if the workers wanted a just division of the goods of the earth, they had to place themselves immediately in the hands of the priests, as at the death of Jesus the little ones and the humble had gathered around the apostles. What strength would the pope have, what army would the clergy dispose of, when he commanded the innumerable crowd of workers! In a week, the world would be purged of the wicked, the unworthy masters would be driven out, there would finally be the true reign of God, each rewarded according to his merits, the law of labor regulating universal happiness.","The priest stood there and held forth at great length. He was using the strike – the terrible poverty, the sense of grievance sharpened by hunger – with the ardour of a missionary preaching to savages for the greater glory of his religion. He said that the Church was on the side of the poor and that one day it would cause justice to triumph by calling down the wrath of God upon the iniquities of the rich. And that day would soon dawn, for the rich had usurped God’s place and were even now governing without God, having wickedly stolen His power. But if the workers were seeking the fair distribution of the fruits of the earth, then they should begin by placing their faith in the priests of the Church, just as the humble and the meek had gathered round the apostles upon the death of Jesus. What power the Pope would have then, what an army the clergy would be able to call upon if it could command the workers in their countless hosts! Within a week they would cleanse the world of the evildoers, they would dispatch the unworthy masters, and the true kingdom of God would be at hand, where each man would be rewarded according to his just desserts and the laws of the workplace would ensure the happiness of all.","Then the priest stood and talked at length. He spoke of the strike, this terrible wretchedness, this exasperated rancour of famine, with the ardour of a missionary who is preaching to savages for the glory of religion.

And that day would come soon, for the rich had taken the place of God, and were governing without God, in their impious theft of power.

In one week they would purge the world of the wicked, they would chase away the unworthy masters.

Et l’on partit, au pas. Sur chaque berline, une lampe mettait une étoffe rouge. Puis, derrière, suivait la qu’elle des mineurs, une cinquantaine d’ombres à la file.

And off we went, walking. On each sedan, a lamp put a red cloth. Then, behind, followed the queen of the miners, fifty shadows in a row.

And off they set, at the walk. Over each tub a lamp shone like a red star. Then behind came the long line of miners, some fifty shadowy figures in single file. By now completely exhausted, they were dragging their feet and slipping on the mud, like some grim herd of animals struck down by a fatal disease. It took nearly half an hour to reach pit-bottom as this seemingly endless subterranean cortège made its way through the thick darkness along the roadways, which forked and twisted and unravelled before them.","A procession was quickly formed.

Et les hommes suivaient, dans une confusion de troupeau, en une queue qui s’élargissait, hérissée de barres de fer, dominée par l’unique hache de Levaque, dont le tranchant miroitait au soleil. Étienne, au centre, ne perdait pas de vue Chaval, qu’il forçait à marcher devant lui ; tandis que Maheu, derrière, l’air sombre, lançait des coups d’œil sur Catherine, la seule femme parmi ces hommes, s’obstinant à trotter près de son amant, pour qu’on ne lui fit pas de mal. Des têtes nues s’échevelaient au grand air, on n’entendait que le claquement des sabots, pareil à un galop de bétail lâché, emporté dans la sonnerie sauvage de Jeanlin.","From the Fourche-aux-boeufs, Etienne had taken command of it. Without anyone stopping, he shouted orders, he organized the march. Jeanlin, at the head, was galloping, sounding barbarous music in his horn. Then, in the first ranks, the women advanced, some armed with sticks, Maheude with wild eyes which seemed to seek in the distance the promised city of justice; la Brûlé, la Levaque, la Mouquette, stretching all their legs under their rags, like soldiers leaving for war. In the event of a bad encounter, we would see if the gendarmes would dare to hit women. And the men followed, in a confusion of herds, in a widening line, bristling with iron bars, dominated by Levaque's single axe, the edge of which gleamed in the sun. Étienne, in the center, did not lose sight of Chaval, whom he forced to walk in front of him; while Maheu, behind, with a gloomy air, cast glances at Catherine, the only woman among these men, persisting in trotting close to her lover, so that no one would do him harm. Bare heads were disheveled in the open air, one heard only the clicking of hooves, like the gallop of loose cattle, carried away in the wild ringing of Jeanlin.","By the time they had reached La Fourche-aux-Bœufs, Étienne had taken charge. Without interrupting their advance, he shouted out commands and organized the march. Jeanlin raced along in front, playing barbarous tunes on his horn. Then came the women, in rows, some armed with sticks: La Maheude had a wild look in her eye, as though she were straining to catch a distant glimpse of the promised land of justice, while La Brûlé, La Levaque and La Mouquette strode out in their tattered skirts like soldiers marching off to war. If they ran into any opposition, they’d soon see if the gendarmes would dare to hit a woman. The men followed, a disorderly herd that spread wider and wider as it stretched away into the distance: and among the forest of crowbars Levaque’s solitary axe stood out, its blade glinting in the sunlight. Étienne, in the middle, was keeping an eye on Chaval, whom he made walk in front of him; while behind him Maheu looked thunderous and kept casting dirty looks at Catherine, who was the only woman back here among the men and who had insisted on running along beside her lover to prevent any harm coming to him. Some were without caps, their hair tousled by the breeze; and apart from the wild blasts of Jeanlin’s horn all that could be heard was the clatter of clogs, which sounded like cattle stampeding.","From the Fourche-aux-Boeufs, Étienne had assumed command. He cried his orders while the crowd moved on, and organized the march. Jeanlin galloped at the head, performing barbarous music on his horn. Then the women came in the first ranks, some of them armed with sticks: Maheude, with wild eyes seemed to be seeking afar for the promised city of justice, Mother Brulé, the Levaque woman, Mouquette, striding along beneath their rags, like soldiers setting out for the seat of war. If they had any encounters, we should see if the police dared to strike women. And the men followed in a confused flock, a stream that grew larger and larger, bristling with iron bars and dominated by Levaque's single axe, with its blade glistening in the sun. Étienne, in the middle, kept Chaval in sight, forcing him to walk before him; while Maheu, behind, gloomily kept an eye on Catherine, the only woman among these men, obstinately trotting near her lover for fear that he would be hurt. Bare heads were dishevelled in the air; only the clank of sabots could be heard, like the movement of released cattle, carried away by Jeanlin's wild trumpeting."
"Et la course recommença, dans la boue noire et collante. Il y avait encore deux kilomètres, les petits se faisaient tirer davantage, ne s’amusant plus, consternés. À droite et à gauche du chemin, se déroulaient les mêmes terrains vagues clos de palissades moussues, les mêmes corps de fabriques, salis de fumée, hérissés de cheminées hautes. Puis, en pleins champs, les terres plates s’étalèrent, immenses, pareilles à un océan de mottes brunes, sans la mâture d’un arbre, jusqu’à la ligne violâtre de la forêt de Vandame.","And the race began again, in the black and sticky mud. There were still two kilometers, the little ones were being pulled more, no longer having fun, dismayed. To the right and left of the road stretched the same wastelands enclosed by mossy palisades, the same factory buildings, soiled with smoke, bristling with high chimneys. Then, in the middle of the fields, the flat land spread out, immense, like an ocean of brown clods, without the mast of a tree, up to the violet line of the forest of Vandame.","And off they went again, through the black, sticky mud. They still had two kilometres to go, and the little ones, rather put out and no longer finding this fun, needed more and more to be dragged. To the right and left of the road followed a succession of yet more derelict patches of waste ground surrounded by rotting fences and yet more smoke-stained factory buildings bristling with tall chimneys. When they reached open country, the vast, flat earth spread out before them, an ocean of brown, upturned soil stretching away to the purple line of the Vandame forest on the horizon and without even a single tree to suggest the presence of a mast upon its waves.","And the journey began again through the black, sticky mud. There were still two kilometres to walk, and the little ones dragged behind more than ever, for they were frightened, and no longer amused themselves. To right and to left of the path the same vague landscape unrolled, enclosed within mossy palings, the same factory buildings, dirty with smoke, bristling with tall chimneys. Then the flat land was spread out in immense open fields, like an ocean of brown clods, without a tree-trunk, as far as the purplish line of the forest of Vandame."
"Vers le commencement du dernier siècle, un coup de folie s’était déclaré, de Lille à Valenciennes, pour la recherche de la houille. Les succès des concessionnaires, qui devaient plus tard former la Compagnie d’Anzin, avaient exalté toutes les têtes. Dans chaque commune, on sondait le sol ; et les sociétés se créaient, et les concessions poussaient en une nuit. Mais, parmi les entêtés de l’époque, le baron Desrumaux avait certainement laissé la mémoire de l’intelligence la plus héroïque. Pendant quarante années, il s’était débattu sans faiblir, au milieu de continuels obstacles : premières recherches infructueuses, fosses nouvelles abandonnées au bout de longs mois de travail, éboulements qui comblaient les trous, inondations subites qui noyaient les ouvriers, centaines de mille francs jetés dans la terre ; puis, les tracas de l’administration, les paniques des actionnaires, la lutte avec les seigneurs terriens, résolus à ne pas reconnaître les concessions royales, si l’on refusait de traiter d’abord avec eux. Il venait enfin de fonder la société Desrumaux, Fauquenoix et Cie, pour exploiter la concession de Montsou, et les fosses commençaient à donner de faibles bénéfices, lorsque deux concessions voisines, celle de Cougny, appartenant au comte de Cougny, et celle de Joiselle, appartenant à la société Cornille et Jenard, avaient failli l’écraser sous le terrible assaut de leur concurrence. Heureusement, le 25 août 1760, un traité intervenait entre les trois concessions et les réunissait en une seule. La Compagnie des mines de Montsou était créée, telle qu’elle existe encore aujourd’hui. Pour la répartition, on avait divisé, d’après l’étalon de la monnaie du temps, la propriété totale en vingt-quatre sous, dont chacun se subdivisait en douze deniers, ce qui faisait deux cent quatre-vingt-huit deniers ; et, comme le denier était de dix mille francs, le capital représentait une somme de près de trois millions. Desrumaux, agonisant, mais vainqueur, avait eu, dans le partage, six sous et trois deniers.","Towards the beginning of the last century, a stroke of madness had declared itself, from Lille to Valenciennes, for the search for coal. The successes of the dealers, who were later to form the Compagnie d'Anzin, had excited all heads. In each commune, the ground was probed; and societies were created, and concessions sprang up overnight. But, among the stubborn people of the time, Baron Desrumaux had certainly left the memory of the most heroic intelligence. For forty years, he had struggled without weakening, in the midst of continual obstacles: fruitless initial research, new pits abandoned after long months of work, landslides which filled in the holes, sudden floods which drowned the workers, hundreds of thousand francs thrown into the ground; then, the hassle of administration, the panics of shareholders, the struggle with the landlords, resolved not to recognize the royal concessions, if one refused to treat first with them. He had finally just founded the company Desrumaux, Fauquenoix et Cie, to exploit the Montsou concession, and the pits were beginning to yield low profits, when two neighboring concessions, that of Cougny, belonging to the Count of Cougny, and that of Joiselle, belonging to the Cornille et Jenard company, had nearly crushed it under the terrible assault of their competition. Fortunately, on August 25, 1760, a treaty was concluded between the three concessions and united them into one. The Compagnie des mines de Montsou was created, as it still exists today. For the apportionment, the total property had been divided, according to the standard of the currency of the time, into twenty-four sous, each of which was subdivided into twelve denarii, which made two hundred and eighty-eight denarii; and, as the denier was ten thousand francs, the capital represented a sum of nearly three millions. Desrumaux, dying, but victorious, had received six sous and three denarii in the division.","Towards the beginning of the previous century, from Lille as far as Valenciennes, there had been a mad rush to discover coal. The success of the concession-holders who were later to found the Anzin Mining Company had turned the heads of one and all. In every district people were busy taking soil samples; companies were set up, and concessions materialized overnight. But among all the determined pioneers of the day it was the Baron Desrumaux who was most remembered for his shrewdness and courage. He had persevered for forty years, never faltering, overcoming obstacle after obstacle: an initial lack of success during his early prospecting, the new mines that had to be abandoned after long months of toil, mine-shafts blocked by rock-falls, miners drowned by sudden floods, hundreds of thousands of francs draining away down a few holes in the ground; and then later the problems of managing the business, the panicking shareholders, the tussles with the hereditary landowners of ancient estates who were determined not to recognize royal concessions unless people came and negotiated with them first. Finally he had established Desrumaux, Fauquenoix and Company to exploit the Montsou concession, and the pits were just beginning to yield meagre returns when the two neighbouring concessions, the one at Cougny, which belonged to the Comte de Cougny, and the one at Joiselle, belonging to the Company of Cornille and Jenard, had almost ruined him with the ferocity of their competition. Fortunately, on 25 August 1760, a settlement had been reached between the three concessions and they were amalgamated. The Montsou Mining Company thus came into being in its present form. To effect a distribution of shares, the total assets had been divided into twenty-four sous, the standard currency unit of the day;2 and each sou was subdivided into twelve deniers, giving two hundred and eighty-eight deniers; and since each denier was worth ten thousand francs, the total capital value represented a sum of nearly three million francs. Desrumaux, near to death but none the less victorious, had received six sous and three deniers as his share.","Towards the beginning of the last century, there had been a mad search for coal between Lille and Valenciennes. The success of those who held the concession, which was afterwards to become the Anzin Company, had turned all heads. In every commune the ground was tested; and societies were formed and concessions grew up in a night. But among all the obstinate seekers of that epoch, Baron Desruinaux had certainly left the reputation for the most heroic intelligence. For forty years he had struggled without yielding, in the midst of continual obstacles: early searches unsuccessful, new pits abandoned at the end of long months of work, landslips which filled up borings, sudden inundations which drowned the workmen, hundreds of thousands of francs thrown into the earth; then the squabbles of the management, the panics of the shareholders, the struggle with the lords of the soil, who were resolved not to recognize royal concessions if no treaty was first made with themselves. He had at last founded the association of Desruinaux, Fauquenoix Co. to exploit the Montsou concession, and the pits began to yield a small profit when two neighbouring concessions, that of Cougny, belonging to the Comte de Cougny, and that of Joiselle, belonging to the Cornille and Jenard Company, had nearly overwhelmed him beneath the terrible assault of their competition. Happily, on the 25th. August 1760, a treaty was made between the three concessions, uniting them into a single one. The Montsou Mining Company was created, such as it still exists to-day. In the distribution they had divided the total property, according to the standard of the money of the time, into twenty-four sous, of which each was subdivided into twelve deniers, which made two hundred and eighty-eight deniers; and as the denier was worth ten thousand francs the capital represented a sum of nearly three millions. Desruinaux, dying but triumphant, received in this division six sous' and three deniers."
"C’était ce que désirait Pluchart, qui était secrétaire de la fédération du Nord. Il insistait particulièrement sur les services que l’Association rendrait aux mineurs, s’ils se mettaient un jour en grève. Étienne, justement, croyait la grève prochaine : l’affaire des bois finirait mal, il ne fallait plus qu’une exigence de la Compagnie pour révolter toutes les fosses.","This was what Pluchart, who was secretary of the Northern Federation, wanted. He particularly insisted on the services that the Association would render to the miners, if they ever went on strike. Étienne, precisely, believed the strike was approaching: the affair of the woods would end badly, all that was needed was a demand from the Company to revolt all the pits.","This was what Pluchart wanted as secretary of the Federation of the Département du Nord, and he laid particular stress on the various ways the Association could help the miners if ever they were to come out on strike. Étienne did in fact think that a strike was imminent: the business over the timbering would turn out badly, and it only needed the Company to make one more demand and every single pit would be up in arms.","This was what was desired by Pluchart, who was secretary to the Federation of the Nord. He insisted especially on the services which the association would render to the miners should they go out on strike. Étienne believed that a strike was imminent: this timbering business would turn out badly; any further demands on the part of the Company would cause rebellion in all the pits."
"Le silence recommença. Elle avait eu un haussement d’épaules résigné. Il la battrait, et quand il serait las, de la battre, il s’arrêterait : ne valait-il pas mieux ça, que de rouler les chemins comme une gueuse ? Puis, elle s’habituait aux gifles, elle disait, pour se consoler, que, sur dix filles, huit ne tombaient pas mieux qu’elle. Si son galant l’épousait un jour, ce serait tout de même bien gentil de sa part.","The silence began again. She gave a resigned shrug. He would beat her, and when he was tired of beating her, he would stop: wasn't that better than roaming the roads like a beggar? Then, she got used to the slaps, she said, to console herself, that, out of ten girls, eight were no better off than her. If her boyfriend married her one day, it would still be very nice of him.","There was silence again. She had merely shrugged in resignation. He would beat her, and when he had tired of beating her, then he would stop. But wasn’t that better than roaming the streets like a beggar? Besides, she was getting used to the beatings, and she told herself by way of consolation that eight out of ten girls ended up no better off than she was. And if he married her some day, well, that would actually be quite decent of him.","There was silence again. She had shrugged her shoulders in resignation.

"– Chaque membre, répétait-il, pourrait bien verser vingt sous par mois.

"C’était, de son côté, une confession. Il se raillait de ses illusions de néophyte, de son rêve religieux d’une cité où la justice allait régner bientôt, entre les hommes devenus frères. Un bon moyen vraiment, se croiser les bras et attendre, si l’on voulait voir les hommes se manger entre eux jusqu’à la fin du monde, comme des loups. Non ! il fallait s’en mêler, autrement l’injustice serait éternelle, toujours les riches suceraient le sang des pauvres. Aussi ne se pardonnait-il pas la bêtise d’avoir dit autrefois qu’on devait bannir la politique de la question sociale. Il ne savait rien alors, et depuis il avait lu, il avait étudié. Maintenant, ses idées étaient mûres, il se vantait d’avoir un système. Pourtant, il l’expliquait mal, en phrases dont la confusion gardait un peu de toutes les théories traversées et successivement abandonnées. Au sommet, restait debout l’idée de Karl Marx : le capital était le résultat de la spoliation, le travail avait le devoir et le droit de reconquérir cette richesse volée. Dans la pratique, il s’était d’abord, avec Proudhon, laissé prendre par la chimère du crédit mutuel, d’une vaste banque d’échange, qui supprimait les intermédiaires ; puis, les sociétés coopératives de Lassalle, dotées par l’État, transformant peu à peu la terre en une seule ville industrielle, l’avaient passionné, jusqu’au jour où le dégoût lui en était venu, devant la difficulté du contrôle ; et il en arrivait depuis peu au collectivisme, il demandait que tous les instruments du travail fussent rendus à la collectivité. Mais cela demeurait vague, il ne savait comment réaliser ce nouveau rêve, empêché encore par les scrupules de sa sensibilité et de sa raison, n’osant risquer les affirmations absolues des sectaires. Il en était simplement à dire qu’il s’agissait de s’emparer du gouvernement, avant tout. Ensuite, on verrait.","It was, on his side, a confession. He laughed at his neophyte illusions, at his religious dream of a city where justice would soon reign among men who had become brothers. A really good way, to fold your arms and wait, if you wanted to see men eating each other until the end of the world, like wolves. No ! we had to get involved, otherwise the injustice would be eternal, the rich would always suck the blood of the poor. So he could not forgive himself for the stupidity of having said in the past that we should banish politics from the social question. He knew nothing then, and since he had read, he had studied. Now his ideas were ripe, he boasted of having a system. However, he explained it badly, in sentences whose confusion kept a little of all the theories crossed and successively abandoned. At the top, Karl Marx's idea remained standing: capital was the result of spoliation, labor had the duty and the right to regain this stolen wealth. In practice, he had at first, with Proudhon, let himself be taken in by the chimera of mutual credit, of a vast exchange bank, which eliminated intermediaries; then, the cooperative societies of Lassalle, endowed by the State, transforming little by little the earth into a single industrial city, had fascinated him, until the day when disgust overcame him, faced with the difficulty of control; and he had recently arrived at collectivism, he demanded that all the instruments of labor be returned to the collectivity. But that remained vague, he did not know how to realize this new dream, still prevented by the scruples of his sensitivity and his reason, not daring to risk the absolute affirmations of the sectarians. He was just saying that it was about taking over the government, first and foremost. Then we would see.","Now it was his turn to speak his mind. He laughed at his earlier idealism, his schoolboy vision of a brave new world in which justice would reign and men would be brothers. But the one way to make sure that men were at each other’s throats until the end of time was to sit back and wait for things to happen. No! You had to get involved, otherwise injustice would never end and the rich would forever be sucking the blood of the poor. Which was why he couldn’t forgive himself for having once been stupid enough to advocate keeping politics out of the ‘social question’. He knew nothing then, whereas he had since read things, studied things. His ideas had matured now, and he liked to think that he had a system which would work. Nevertheless he explained it badly, in a muddle of statements which bore the trace of all the theories he had encountered and abandoned along the way. At the centre was still the idea put forward by Karl Marx: capital was the result of theft, and labour had the duty and the right to recover this stolen wealth. As to putting this into practice, Étienne had at first been seduced, like Proudhon, by the attractions of mutual credit, of one vast clearing bank that would cut out all the middlemen; then it had been Lassalle’s idea of co-operative societies,1 funded by the State, which would gradually transform the earth into one great big industrial city, and he had been wildly in favour of this until the day he was finally put off by the problem of controls; and recently he had been coming round to collectivism, which called for the means of production to be returned into the ownership of the collective. But this was all still somewhat vague, and he couldn’t quite see how to achieve this new goal, prevented as he was by scruples of humanity and common sense from enjoying the fanatic’s ability to advance ideas with uncompromising conviction. For the moment his line was simply that what they had to do first was take power. Afterwards they’d see.","This was a confession on his part. He railed at his illusions of a novice, his religious dream of a city in which justice would soon reign among the men who had become brothers. A fine method truly! to fold one's arms and wait, if one wished to see men eating each other to the end of the world like wolves. No! one must interfere, or injustice would be eternal, and the rich would for ever suck the blood of the poor. Therefore he could not forgive himself the stupidity of having said formerly that politics ought to be banished from the social question. He knew nothing then; now he had read and studied, his ideas were ripe, and he boasted that he had a system. He explained it badly, however, in confused phrases which contained a little of all the theories he had successively passed through and abandoned. At the summit Karl Marx's idea remained standing: capital was the result of spoliation, it was the duty and the privilege of labour to reconquer that stolen wealth. In practice he had at first, with Proudhon, been captured by the chimera of a mutual credit, a vast bank of exchange which suppressed middlemen; then Lassalle's cooperative societies, endowed by the State, gradually transforming the earth into a single industrial town, had aroused his enthusiasm until he grew disgusted in face of the difficulty of controlling them; and he had arrived recently at collectivism, demanding that all the instruments of production should be restored to the community. But this remained vague; he knew not how to realize this new dream, still hindered by scruples of reason and good sense, not daring to risk the secretary's absolute affirmations. He simply said that it was a question of getting possession of the government first of all. Afterwards they would see."
"Elle était décidément très gentille. Quand elle aurait fini sa tartine, il la prendrait et la baiserait sur ses grosses lèvres roses. C’était une résolution de timide, une pensée de violence qui étranglait sa voix. Ces vêtements de garçon, cette veste et cette culotte sur cette chair de fille, l’excitaient et le gênaient. Lui, avait avalé sa dernière bouchée. Il but à la gourde, la lui rendit pour qu’elle la vidât.

When she had finished her toast, he would take her and kiss her on her big pink lips. It was a timid resolution, a thought of violence that strangled his voice.

He drank from the flask and handed it back for her to finish it. The moment for decisive action had arrived, and he was just casting a nervous glance in the direction of the other miners further along the tunnel when a large shadow blocked his view.","She was certainly very charming.

"Alors, il s’évanouit au fond de l’ombre, avec une telle légèreté, qu’on n’entendit même pas le bruit de ses pieds nus. Les deux enfants demeurèrent immobiles durant les cinq minutes, sans regarder en arrière, par crainte de recevoir une gifle de l’invisible. Lentement, une grande affection était née entre eux, dans leur commune terreur. Lui, toujours, songeait à la prendre, à la serrer très fort entre ses bras, comme il voyait faire aux autres ; et elle aussi aurait bien voulu, car ça l’aurait changée, d’être ainsi caressée gentiment. Mais ni lui ni elle ne se serait permis de désobéir. Quand ils s’en allèrent, bien que la nuit fût très noire, ils ne s’embrassèrent même pas, ils marchèrent côte à côte, attendris et désespérés, certains que, s’ils se touchaient, le capitaine par-derrière leur allongerait des claques.","Then he vanished into the shadows with such lightness that you couldn't even hear the sound of his bare feet.

He always dreamed of taking her, of hugging her tightly in his arms, as he saw others do; and she too would have liked, because it would have changed her, to be gently caressed. But neither he nor she would have allowed herself to disobey.

The two children stood quite still for the whole five minutes, not daring to look behind them in case they received a clout from the blue.

Bébert, for his part, thought constantly about taking Lydie and holding her very tightly in his arms, the way he had seen others do; and she would have liked him to, for it would have made a nice change to receive a kind caress. But neither would have dared to disobey. When they set off for home they didn’t even embrace, despite the fact that it was pitch dark, but simply walked along side by side in loving misery, certain that if they were to touch each other, their leader would come and clout them from behind. At the same moment Étienne had reached Réquillart.","Then he disappeared in the shadow, so lightly that the sound of his naked feet could not be heard.

"En entrant, M. Hennebeau eut une surprise : la chambre n’était pas faite, sans doute un oubli ou une paresse d’Hippolyte. Il régnait là une chaleur moite, la chaleur enfermée de toute une nuit, alourdie par la bouche du calorifère, restée ouverte ; et il fut pris aux narines, il suffoqua dans un parfum pénétrant, qu’il crut être l’odeur des eaux de toilette, dont la cuvette se trouvait pleine. Un grand désordre encombrait la pièce, des vêtements épars, des serviettes mouillées jetées aux dossiers des sièges, le lit béant, un drap arraché, traînant jusque sur le tapis. D’ailleurs, il n’eut d’abord qu’un regard distrait, il s’était dirigé vers une table, couverte de papiers, et il y cherchait la note introuvable. Deux fois, il examina les papiers un à un, elle n’y était décidément pas. Où diable cet écervelé de Paul avait-il bien pu la fourrer ?","On entering, M. Hennebeau had a surprise: the room was not made, no doubt an oversight or laziness on the part of Hippolyte. There reigned a moist heat, the enclosed heat of a whole night, weighed down by the mouth of the radiator, which had remained open; and he was taken by the nostrils, he suffocated in a penetrating perfume, which he believed to be the odor of toilet waters, with which the basin was full. A great mess encumbered the room, scattered clothes, wet towels thrown on the backs of the seats, the gaping bed, a torn sheet, dragging on the carpet. Besides, he had only a distracted look at first, he had gone to a table, covered with papers, and he was looking for the note that could not be found. Twice he examined the papers one by one, she was definitely not there. Where the hell had that crazy Paul put it?","On entering the bedroom, M. Hennebeau was taken aback: the room had not been attended to, presumably because Hippolyte had either forgotten or been too lazy to do so. The room seemed warm and clammy, stuffy from having been shut up all night, especially as the door of the stove had been left open; and his nostrils were assailed by a strong, suffocating smell of perfume that he thought must be coming from the wash-basin, which had not been emptied. The room was extremely untidy: clothes lay scattered about, wet towels had been tossed over the backs of chairs, the bed was unmade, and one sheet had been pulled half off on to the floor. But at first he barely took all this in, as he made for the table covered in papers and searched for the missing note. He went through them twice, examining each one, but it was plainly not there. What the devil had that scatterbrain Paul done with it?","As he entered, M. Hennebeau was surprised: the room had not been done, no doubt through Hippolyte's forgetfulness or laziness. There was a moist heat there, the close heat of the past night, made heavier from the mouth of the hot-air stove being left open; and he was suffocated, too, with a penetrating perfume, which he thought must be the odour of the toilet waters with which the basin was full. There was great disorder in the room--garments scattered about, damp towels thrown on the backs of chairs, the bed yawning, with a sheet drawn back and draggling on the carpet. But at first he only glanced round with an abstracted look as he went towards a table covered with papers to look for the missing report. Twice he examined the papers one by one, but it was certainly not there. Where the devil could that madcap Paul have stuffed it?"

Whom would she devour, on whom would she fall, when she no longer had complaisant nephews, sufficiently practical to accept in their own family the table, the bed, and the wife?"
"Étienne, à ce moment, devint fou. Ses yeux se noyèrent d’une vapeur rouge, sa gorge s’était congestionnée d’un flot de sang. Le besoin de tuer le prenait, irrésistible, un besoin physique, l’excitation sanguine d’une muqueuse qui détermine un violent accès de toux. Cela monta, éclata en dehors de sa volonté, sous la poussée de la lésion héréditaire. Il avait empoigné, dans le mur, une feuille de schiste, et il l’ébranlait, et il l’arrachait, très large, très lourde. Puis, à deux mains, avec une force décuplée, il l’abattit sur le crâne de Chaval.","Étienne, at this moment, went mad. His eyes were flooded with red vapor, his throat was congested with a flood of blood. The need to kill seized him, irresistible, a physical need, the sanguine excitation of a mucous membrane which determines a violent attack of coughing. It rose, burst beyond his control, under the pressure of the hereditary lesion. He had grabbed a sheet of schist in the wall, and he was shaking it, and he was tearing it off, very large, very heavy. Then, with both hands, with tenfold force, he brought it down on Chaval's skull.","At that, Étienne went mad. His eyes clouded over with a red mist, and his throat bulged as the blood rushed to his head. He was seized with the need to kill, an irresistible, physical need like a tickle of phlegm in the throat that brings on a violent, unstoppable fit of coughing. It rose up and burst forth, beyond his power to control it, under the impulse of the hereditary flaw within him. He grabbed hold of a lump of shale in the wall, loosened it and tore it free. It was large and heavy. Using both hands and with superhuman strength, he brought it crashing down on Chaval’s skull.","From that moment Étienne became mad. His eyes seemed drowned in red vapour, his chest was congested by the flow of blood. The need to kill seized him irresistibly, a physical need, like the irritation of mucus which causes a violent spasm of coughing. It rose and broke out beyond his will, beneath the pressure of the hereditary disease. He had seized a sheet of slate in the wall and he shook it and tore it out, a very large, heavy piece. Then with both hands and with tenfold strength he brought it down on Chaval's skull."

"Lydie recula de quelques pas, pendant qu’il mettait un œil à la fente du volet. Il étouffa de petits cris, son échine se renflait, dans un frémissement. À son tour, la Levaque regarda ; mais elle dit, comme prise de coliques, que ça la dégoûtait. Maheu, qui l’avait poussée, voulant voir aussi, déclara qu’on en avait pour son argent. Et ils recommencèrent, à la file, chacun son coup d’œil, ainsi qu’à la comédie. La salle, reluisante de propreté, s’égayait du grand feu ; il y avait des gâteaux sur la table, avec une bouteille et des verres ; enfin, une vraie noce. Si bien que ce qu’ils voyaient là-dedans finissait par exaspérer les deux hommes, qui, en d’autres circonstances, en auraient rigolé six mois. Qu’elle se fit bourrer jusqu’à la gorge, les jupes en l’air, c’était drôle. Mais, nom de Dieu ! est-ce que ce n’était pas cochon, de se payer ça devant un si grand feu, et de se donner des forces avec des biscuits, lorsque les camarades n’avaient ni une fichette de pain, ni une escarbille de houille ?","Lydie took a few steps back while he peered at the slit in the shutter. He stifled little cries, his spine swelled, quivering. In her turn, La Levaque looked; but she said, as if in a fit of colic, that it disgusted her. Maheu, who had pushed her, wanting to see too, declared that we had gotten our money's worth. And they began again, one after the other, each his own glance, as well as the comedy. The room, sparkling with cleanliness, was brightened by the great fire; there were cakes on the table, with a bottle and glasses; finally, a real wedding. So much so that what they saw in there ended up exasperating the two men, who, in other circumstances, would have laughed about it for six months. That she got stuffed to the throat, skirts up, it was funny. But, for God's sake! Wasn't it nasty to treat yourself to that in front of such a big fire, and to give yourself strength with biscuits, when your comrades had neither a loaf of bread nor a cinder of coal?","Lydie stepped back a few paces, while he put his eye to the crack in the shutter. He gave short muffled cries of exclamation as his back rose and shuddered. Then it was La Levaque’s turn to look; but she announced, as though she were about to vomit, that the whole thing was disgusting. Wanting to have a look, too, Maheu pushed her out of the way, and then declared that you certainly got value for money! And they repeated the process, each taking a turn to look, just like in a peep-show. The sitting-room, which was sparklingly clean, looked bright and cheerful with its roaring fire; there were cakes on the table, as well as a bottle and some glasses – quite a party, in fact. So much so that the sight of it all was enough to infuriate the two men, they who in other circumstances would have laughed at the episode for a good six months. The fact that she was lying there with her skirts in the air getting screwed for all she was worth was funny all right. But God Almighty if it wasn’t a rotten trick to be doing it in front of such a huge fire and after getting her strength up with all those biscuits when the comrades hadn’t a crumb of bread or a lump of coal to their name!","Lydie drew back a few steps while he put his eye to a crack in the shutter. He stifled a low cry and his back bent with a quiver. In her turn his wife looked through, but she said, as though taken by the colic, that it was disgusting. Maheu, who had pushed her, wishing also to see, then declared that he had had enough for his money. And they began again, in a row, each taking his glance as at a peep-show. The parlour, glittering with cleanliness, was inlivened by a large fire; there were cakes on the table with a bottle and glasses, in fact quite a feast. What they saw going on in there at last exasperated the two men, who under other circumstances would have laughed over it for six months. That she should let herself be stuffed up to the neck, with her skirts in the air, was funny. But, good God! was it not disgusting to do that in front of a great fire, and to get up one's strength with biscuits, when the mates had neither a slice of bread nor a fragment of coal?"

"Bien que, chez elle, tout fût en ordre, et qu’elle lavât chaque samedi, elle jetait un coup d’œil de ménagère jalouse sur cette salle si claire, où il y avait même de la coquetterie, des vases dorés sur le buffet, une glace, trois gravures encadrées.","Although, at home, everything was in order, and she washed every Saturday, she cast a jealous housewife's glance over this room, so bright, where there was even coquetry, gilded vases on the sideboard. , a mirror, three framed prints.","Even though everything was tidy in her own house and she did the washing every Saturday, she cast an envious housewifely eye round this room that was so bright and cheerful, stylish even, with its gilt vases on the sideboard, its mirror and its three framed prints.","Although everything was in order in her house, and she scrubbed every Saturday , she glanced with a jealous housekeeper's eye over this clean room, in which there was even a certain coquetry, gilt vases on the sideboard, a mirror, three framed prints."
"Tout de suite, il donna l’ordre de compter les lampes. Le matin, on en avait distribué trois cent vingt-deux ; et l’on n’en retrouvait que deux cent cinquante-cinq ; seulement, plusieurs ouvriers avouaient que la leur était restée là-bas, tombée de leur main, dans les bousculades de la panique. On tâcha de procéder à un appel, il fut impossible d’établir un nombre exact : des mineurs s’étaient sauvés, d’autres n’entendaient plus leur nom. Personne ne tombait d’accord sur les camarades manquants. Ils étaient peut-être vingt, peut-être quarante.

They were maybe twenty, maybe forty. And, only, one certainty was made for the engineer: there were men at the bottom, one could hear their howling, in the noise of the waters, through the collapsed frames, when one leaned over the mouth of the well.","He immediately gave orders for the lamps to be counted. Three hundred and twenty-two had been issued that morning, and only two hundred and fifty-five had been handed in. However, several miners admitted that they had left theirs behind after dropping them in the general panic.

Twenty of them perhaps, or forty. But for Négrel one thing was clear: there were still men below. If you leaned over the edge of the shaft, you could make out their screams coming up through the debris from the collapsed tubbing, despite the noise of the falling water.","He immediately gave orders to count the lamps.

"Ce dimanche-là, dès huit heures, Souvarine resta seul dans la salle de L’Avantage, à sa place accoutumée, la tête contre le mur. Plus un charbonnier ne savait où prendre les deux sous d’une chope, jamais les débits n’avaient eu moins de clients. Aussi Mme Rasseneur, immobile au comptoir, gardait-elle un silence irrité ; pendant que Rasseneur, debout devant la cheminée de fonte, semblait suivre, d’un air réfléchi, la fumée rousse du charbon.","That Sunday, from eight o'clock, Souvarine remained alone in the room of L'Avantage, in his accustomed place, his head against the wall. No longer did a charcoal burner know where to get the two sous of a mug, never had the bars had fewer customers.

So Mme Rasseneur, with nothing to do but sit at the counter, maintained a tetchy silence, while Rasseneur stood by the cast-iron stove with a pensive air, seemingly preoccupied with the russet smoke rising from the coal.","ON that Sunday, ever since eight o'clock, Souvarine had been sitting alone in the parlour of the Avantage, at his accustomed place, with his head against the wall.

"Presque au même instant, comme Mouque et Bataille disparaissaient au fond d’une galerie, un craquement eut lieu en l’air, suivi d’un vacarme prolongé de chute. C’était une pièce du cuvelage qui se détachait, qui tombait de cent quatre-vingts mètres, en rebondissant contre les parois. Pierron et les autres chargeurs purent se garer, la planche de chêne broya seulement une berline vide. En même temps, un paquet d’eau, le flot jaillissant d’une digue crevée, ruisselait. Dansaert voulut monter voir ; mais il parlait encore, qu’une seconde pièce déboula.

Dansaert wanted to go up to see; but he was still speaking, when a second piece tumbled out. And, in the face of the threatening disaster, terrified, he hesitated no longer, he gave the order to go back up, sent out foremen to warn the men in the yards.","Almost at the same instant as Mouque and Battle were disappearing down a roadway, there was a loud crack up above, followed by the prolonged clatter of something falling.

Pierron and the other onsetters were able to get clear in time so that the oak plank crushed only an empty tub. At the same time a great sheet of water came hurtling down, as though a dyke had burst. Dansaert wanted to climb up and take a look; but even as he spoke, a second piece came tumbling down. Terrified, and with disaster staring him in the face, he hesitated no longer but gave the order to return to the surface and dispatched the deputies to raise the alarm throughout the mine.","Almost at the same moment as Mouque and Bataille were disappearing at the end of a gallery, there was a crackling in the air, followed by the prolonged noise of a fall.

Devenu blême, le directeur baissait aussi la voix, dans le besoin instinctif qui fait le silence sur la monstruosité des grandes débauches et des grands crimes. Il était inutile d’avoir l’air de trembler devant les dix mille ouvriers de Montsou : plus tard, on verrait. Et tous deux continuaient à chuchoter, atterrés qu’un homme eût trouvé le courage de descendre, de se pendre au milieu du vide, de risquer sa vie vingt fois, pour cette effroyable besogne. Ils ne comprenaient même pas cette bravoure folle dans la destruction, ils refusaient de croire malgré l’évidence, comme on doute de ces histoires d’évasions célèbres, de ces prisonniers envolés par des fenêtres, à trente mètres du sol.","Yes, he answered with his head, with defiant looks. He refused to explain himself in the presence of the few overseers who were listening, he led his uncle ten meters away, did not consider himself far enough, retreated again; then, very quietly, in his ear, he finally told her of the attack, the planks pierced and sawn, the pit bled at the neck and gasping. Turning pale, the director also lowered his voice, in the instinctive need that silences the monstrosity of great debauchery and great crimes. It was useless to appear to tremble before the ten thousand workers of Montsou: later, we would see. And they both continued to whisper, appalled that a man had found the courage to descend, to hang himself in the middle of the void, to risk his life twenty times over for this dreadful task. They did not even understand this mad bravery in the destruction, they refused to believe despite the evidence, as one doubts these stories of famous escapes, of these prisoners flying out of windows, thirty meters above the ground.","Yes, Négrel nodded, glancing round warily. He did not want to explain further while some of the deputies were listening, and he led his uncle some ten metres away and then, having judged the distance insufficient, further away still. Speaking very softly in his ear, he told him about the sabotage, how the planks had been sawn and drilled, how the pit had had its throat slit and was now breathing its last. M. Hennebeau turned very pale and also lowered his voice, instinctively respecting the silence that attends the monstrousness of great crimes or wanton acts of immorality. There was no point in appearing to be frightened in front of Montsou’s ten thousand miners: they would reflect on the consequences later. And the two men continued to whisper together, appalled by the thought that any man could have found the courage to go down the shaft, hang there in the void, and risk his life twenty times over in order to carry out this dreadful deed. They could not begin to grasp this mad bravery in the cause of destruction, and they refused to believe it, despite the evidence, just as people refuse to believe the stories of famous escapes and prisoners who must have sprouted wings and flown from windows that are thirty metres up.","He nodded with a cautious look. He refused to talk in the presence of some captains who were listening, and led his uncle ten metres away, and not thinking this far enough, drew still farther back; then, in a low whisper, he at last told of the outrage, the torn and sawn planks, the pit bleeding at the neck and groaning. Turning pale, the manager also lowered his voice, with that instinctive need of silence in face of the monstrosity of great orgies and great crimes. It was useless to look as though they were trembling before the ten thousand Montsou men; later on they would see. And they both continued whispering, overcome at the thought that a man had had the courage to go down, to hang in the midst of space, to risk his life twenty times over in his terrible task. They could not even understand this mad courage in destruction; they refused to believe, in spite of the evidence, just as we doubt those stories of celebrated escapes of prisoners who fly through windows thirty metres above the ground."

"Le Voreux, à présent, sortait du rêve. Étienne, qui s’oubliait devant le brasier à chauffer ses pauvres mains saignantes, regardait, retrouvait chaque partie de la fosse, le hangar goudronné du criblage, le beffroi du puits, la vaste chambre de la machine d’extraction, la tourelle carrée de la pompe d’épuisement. Cette fosse, tassée au fond d’un creux, avec ses constructions trapues de briques, dressant sa cheminée comme une corne menaçante, lui semblait avoir un air mauvais de bête goulue, accroupie là pour manger le monde. Tout en l’examinant, il songeait à lui, à son existence de vagabond, depuis huit jours qu’il cherchait une place ; il se revoyait dans son atelier du chemin de fer, giflant son chef, chassé de Lille, chassé de partout ; le samedi, il était arrivé à Marchiennes, où l’on disait qu’il y avait du travail, aux Forges ; et rien, ni aux Forges, ni chez Sonneville, il avait dû passer le dimanche caché sous les bois d’un chantier de charronnage, dont le surveillant venait de l’expulser à deux heures de la nuit. Rien, plus un sou, pas même une croûte : qu’allait-il faire ainsi par les chemins, sans but, ne sachant seulement où s’abriter contre la bise ? Oui, c’était bien une fosse, les rares lanternes éclairaient le carreau, une porte brusquement ouverte lui avait permis d’entrevoir les foyers des générateurs, dans une clarté vive. Il s’expliquait jusqu’à l’échappement de la pompe, cette respiration grosse et longue, soufflant sans relâche, qui était comme l’haleine engorgée du monstre.","The Voreux was now emerging from the dream. Étienne, who forgot himself in front of the brazier warming his poor bleeding hands, gazed, rediscovered each part of the pit, the tarred screening shed, the belfry of the shaft, the vast chamber of the extraction machine, the square turret of the the exhaust pump. This pit, heaped at the bottom of a hollow, with its squat brick constructions, raising its chimney like a threatening horn, seemed to him to have the evil air of a greedy beast, crouching there to devour the world. While examining it, he thought of himself, of his existence as a vagabond, for the eight days he had been looking for a place; he saw himself again in his workshop on the railroad, slapping his boss, chased from Lille, chased everywhere; on Saturday he had arrived at Marchiennes, where they said there was work, at the Forges; and nothing, neither at the Forges nor at Sonneville's; he had had to spend the Sunday hidden under the woods of a cartwright's yard, from which the overseer had just expelled him at two o'clock at night. Nothing, a penny left, not even a scab: what was he going to do like this on the roads, aimlessly, not knowing where to take shelter against the wind? Yes, it was indeed a pit, the few lanterns lit up the tiled floor, a door suddenly opened had allowed him to glimpse the hearths of the generators, in a lively light. He explained himself even to the exhaust of the pump, that thick, long breath, blowing without ceasing, which was like the engorged breath of the monster.","Le Voreux was now emerging as though from a landscape of dream, and while he lingered at the brazier warming his sore, chapped hands, Étienne took in the scene. He was able to locate each part of the pit: the screening-shed with its asphalt roof; the headgear over the pit-shaft; the huge engine-house; and the square tower containing the drainage-pump. Hunkered in a hollow in the ground, with its squat brick buildings and a chimney that poked up like a menacing horn, the pit looked to him like some monstrous and voracious beast crouching there ready to gobble everyone up. As he stared at it, he began thinking about himself and the vagrant life he had been living for the past week in search of work: he saw himself back in Lille, in his railway workshop, hitting his boss and being fired and then getting turned away wherever he went. On Saturday he had arrived in Marchiennes. He had heard there was work at Les Forges, the ironworks; but there’d been nothing, neither at Les Forges nor at Sonneville’s, and he’d had to spend the Sunday hidden under a woodpile in a cartwright’s yard, from where the watchman had just evicted him at two o’clock that morning. He had nothing, not a penny to his name, not even a crust of bread. So what was he supposed to do now, wandering the highways and byways like this with nowhere to go and not even the slightest idea where to find shelter from the wind? Yes, it was a pit all right: he could see the paved yard in the light of the few lanterns hanging there, and the sudden opening of a door had allowed him a glimpse of the boiler fires blazing with light. Gradually he worked out what everything was, even that noise of the pump letting off steam, a slow, deep, insistent puffing that sounded as though the monster were congested and fighting for breath.","The Voreux was now emerging from the gloom. Étienne, who forgot himself before the stove, warming his poor bleeding hands, looked round and could see each part of the pit: the shed tarred with siftings, the pit-frame, the vast chamber of the winding machine, the square turret of the exhaustion pump. This pit, piled up in the bottom of a hollow, with its squat brick buildings, raising its chimney like a threatening horn, seemed to him to have the evil air of a gluttonous beast crouching there to devour the earth. While examining it, he thought of himself, of his vagabond existence these eight days he had been seeking work. He saw himself again at his workshop at the railway, delivering a blow at his foreman, driven from Lille, driven from everywhere. On Saturday he had arrived at Marchinnes, where they said that work was to be had at the Forges, and there was nothing, neither at the Forges nor at Sonneville's. He had been obliged to pass the Sunday hidden beneath the wood of a cartwright's yard, from which the watchman had just turned him out at two o'clock in the morning. He had nothing, not a penny, not even a crust; what should he do, wandering along the roads without aim, not knowing where to shelter himself from the wind? Yes, it was certainly a pit; the occasional lanterns lighted up the square; a door, suddenly opened, had enabled him to catch sight of the furnaces in a clear light. He could explain even the escapement of the pump, that thick, long breathing that went on without ceasing, and which seemed to be the monster's congested respiration."
"La bande, de nouveau, sillonna la plaine rase. Elle revenait sur ses pas, par les longues routes droites, par les terres sans cesse élargies. Il était quatre heures, le soleil, qui baissait à l’horizon, allongeait sur le sol glacé les ombres de cette horde, aux grands gestes furieux.","The band again criss-crossed the flat plain. She retraced her steps, by the long straight roads, by the ever widening lands. It was four o'clock, the sun, which was sinking on the horizon, stretched out on the icy ground the shadows of this horde, with great furious gestures.","Once more the mob cut a swathe across the open plain. It was now retracing its steps, along the long straight highways and across fields that had grown bigger and bigger over the years. It was four o’clock: the sun was setting on the horizon, and the shadows cast by the horde and its wild gesticulations fell across the frozen ground.","Once more the mob ploughed through the flat-plain.

"Maheu, les doigts brûlés, avait lâché l’allumette ; et les ténèbres retombèrent sur le petit cadavre encore chaud. Le médecin était reparti en courant. Étienne n’entendait plus dans la pièce noire que les sanglots de la Maheude, qui répétait son appel de mort, cette lamentation lugubre et sans fin.","Maheu, his fingers burnt, had dropped the match; and darkness fell on the still warm little corpse. The doctor ran off. Étienne no longer heard in the dark room except the sobs of Maheude, who repeated her death cry, that lugubrious and endless lamentation.","Maheu, his fingers burned, had dropped the match; and darkness fell once more on the little corpse that was still warm. The doctor had rushed away. And in the blackness of the room all Étienne could hear was La Maheude sobbing and crying out again and again, in ceaseless funereal lament, for death to come:","Maheu, with burnt fingers, had dropped the match, and the darkness closed over the little corpse, which was still warm. The doctor had gone away in a hurry. Étienne heard nothing more in the black room but Maheude's sobs, repeating her cry for death, that melancholy and endless lamentation:"
"– Tiens ! le voilà, Chaval, reprit tranquillement Maheu. Il est avec Catherine.","- Take ! there he is, Chaval,” resumed Maheu calmly. He is with Katherine.","‘Look, there’s Chaval,’ Maheu said. ‘He’s with Catherine.’","""Hallo! there's Chaval,"" said Maheu quietly; ""he is with Catherine."""
"Une heure plus tard seulement, vers neuf heures, Étienne retraversa le coron, en se disant qu’il fallait manger et se coucher, s’il voulait être debout le matin à quatre heures. Le village dormait déjà, tout noir dans la nuit. Pas une lueur ne glissait des persiennes closes, les longues façades s’alignaient, avec le sommeil pesant des casernes qui ronflent. Seul, un chat se sauva au travers des jardins vides. C’était la fin de la journée, l’écrasement des travailleurs tombant de la table au lit, assommés de fatigue et de nourriture.","Only an hour later, around nine o'clock, Étienne crossed the settlement again, telling himself that he must eat and go to bed if he wanted to be up in the morning at four o'clock. The village was already asleep, pitch black in the night. Not a gleam slipped from the closed shutters, the long facades lined up, with the heavy sleep of the rumbling barracks. Alone, a cat escaped through the empty gardens. It was the end of the day, the crush of workers falling from the table into bed, stunned with fatigue and food.","It was not until one hour later, towards nine, that Étienne made his way back through the village, having told himself that he really ought to have something to eat and go to bed if he was to be up at four the next morning. The village was already asleep, plunged in darkness beneath the blackness of the night. Not a single gleam of light filtered through the closed shutters, and row after row of houses lay deep in slumber like so many barracks filled with snoring soldiers. A solitary cat made off across the deserted gardens. It was day’s end, the final stupor of workers who had slumped from their tables into bed, stunned by food and sheer exhaustion.","It was not until an hour later, towards nine o'clock, that Étienne again passed the settlement, saying to himself that he must eat and sleep, if he was to be up again at four o'clock in the morning.

Only a cat escaped through the empty gardens. It was the end of the day, the collapse of workers falling from the table to the bed, overcome with weariness and food."
"Sous ses ordres, une centaine de grévistes accouraient ; et les chargeurs n’eurent que le temps de s’éloigner. Des hommes dételèrent les chevaux qui s’effarèrent et partirent, piqués aux cuisses ; tandis que d’autres, en renversant le tombereau, cassaient les brancards.","Under his orders, a hundred strikers flocked; and the chargers had only time to get away. Men unhitched the horses, which spooked and set off, stung in the thighs; while others, overturning the cart, broke the shafts.","At his command a hundred or so strikers came running up, and the loaders only just had time to get away. Men unhitched the horses, who took fright and ran off, having been pricked in the flanks; while others turned the cart upside down and, in so doing, broke its shafts.","At his orders some hundred strikers ran up, and the porters only had time to escape. Men unharnessed the horses, which were frightened and set off, struck in the haunches; while others, overturning the wagon, broke the shafts."
"D’un air de gêne, Étienne expliqua qu’on ne pourrait pas bouger, que les soldats qui gardaient les fosses protégeraient la descente des ouvriers belges. Et Maheu serrait les poings, irrité surtout, comme il disait, d’avoir ces baïonnettes dans le dos. Alors, les charbonniers n’étaient plus les maîtres chez eux ? on les traitait donc en galériens, pour les forcer au travail, le fusil chargé ? Il aimait son puits, ça lui faisait une grosse peine de n’y être pas descendu depuis deux mois. Aussi voyait-il rouge, à l’idée de cette injure, de ces étrangers qu’on menaçait d’y introduire. Puis, le souvenir qu’on lui avait rendu son livret lui creva le cœur.","With an air of embarrassment, Étienne explained that we could not move, that the soldiers guarding the pits would protect the descent of the Belgian workers. And Maheu clenched his fists, irritated above all, as he said, at having those bayonets behind his back. So, the charcoal burners were no longer the masters in their own house? So they were treated like galley slaves, to force them to work, with their guns loaded? He loved his well, it pained him not to have been down there for two months. So he saw red at the thought of this insult, of these strangers who were threatened to be brought in. Then, the memory that he had been given back his libretto broke his heart.","Looking embarrassed, Étienne explained that it was impossible to move an inch round the place: the soldiers guarding the pits would protect the Belgian workers as they went down. And Maheu clenched his fists, infuriated above all at having a bayonet in his back, as he put it. So the miners were no longer masters in their own backyard? Were they to be treated like galley-slaves and forced to work at rifle-point? He loved his pit, and it had hurt him greatly not to go down it for the last two months. So he saw red at the thought of being insulted like this, by these foreigners they were talking of bringing in. Then he remembered that he had been sacked, and it broke his heart.","With an air of constraint, Étienne explained that it was not possible to move, that the soldiers who guarded the pits would protect the descent of the Belgian workmen. And Maheu clenched his fists, irritated especially, as he said, by having bayonets in his back. Then the colliers were no longer masters in their own place? They were treated, then, like convicts, forced to work by a loaded musket! He loved his pit, it was a great grief to him not to have been down for two months. He was driven wild, therefore, at the idea of this insult, these strangers whom they threatened to introduce. Then the recollection that his certificate had been given back to him struck him to the heart."
"Le jeudi matin, Étienne fut pris d’inquiétude, en ne voyant pas arriver son ancien contremaître, qui avait promis par dépêche d’être là le mercredi soir. Que se passait-il donc ? Il était désolé de ne pouvoir s’entendre avec lui, avant la réunion. Dès neuf heures, il se rendit à Montsou, dans l’idée que le mécanicien y était peut-être allé tout droit, sans s’arrêter au Voreux.","On Thursday morning Étienne was overcome with anxiety when he did not see the arrival of his former foreman, who had promised by telegram to be there on Wednesday evening. So what was going on? He was sorry that he couldn't get along with him before the meeting.

What could have happened? He was disappointed that he wouldn’t be able to have a word with him in private before the meeting to discuss how they were going to proceed.

"Étienne ne se plaignait guère que de Jeanlin, qui dormait en chien de fusil. Alzire respirait d’un léger souffle, on retrouvait le matin Lénore et Henri aux bras l’un de l’autre, tels qu’on les avait couchés. Dans la maison noire, il n’y avait d’autre bruit que les ronflements de Maheu et de la Maheude, roulant à intervalles réguliers, comme des soufflets de forge. En somme, Étienne se trouvait mieux que chez Rasseneur, le lit n’était pas mauvais, et l’on changeait les draps une fois par mois. Il mangeait aussi de meilleure soupe, il souffrait seulement de la rareté de la viande. Mais tous en étaient là, il ne pouvait exiger, pour quarante-cinq francs de pension, d’avoir un lapin à chaque repas. Ces quarante-cinq francs aidaient la famille, on finissait par joindre les deux bouts, en laissant toujours de petites dettes en arrière ; et les Maheu se montraient reconnaissants envers leur logeur, son linge était lavé, raccommodé, ses boutons recousus, ses affaires mises en ordre ; enfin, il sentait autour de lui la propreté et les bons soins d’une femme.","Étienne only complained of Jeanlin, who slept curled up. Alzire breathed lightly, in the morning one found Lénore and Henri in each other's arms, just as they had been in bed. In the black house there was no other noise than the snoring of Maheu and Maheude, rolling at regular intervals, like the bellows of a forge. All in all, Étienne was better off than at Rasseneur's, the bed was not bad, and the sheets were changed once a month. He also ate better soup, he only suffered from the scarcity of meat. But all were there, he could not insist, for forty-five francs a pension, on having a rabbit at every meal. These forty-five francs helped the family, we ended up making ends meet, always leaving small debts behind; and the Maheus showed themselves grateful to their landlord, his linen was washed, mended, his buttons sewn on, his things put in order; finally, he felt around him the cleanliness and good care of a woman.","Étienne’s only cause for complaint was Jeanlin, who slept curled up like a gun dog. Alzire breathed gently as she slept, while in the mornings Lénore and Henri would still be lying in each other’s arms exactly as they had been put to bed the night before. Amid the darkness the only other sound in the house was of Maheu and La Maheude snoring, rumbling at regular intervals like bellows in a forge. All in all Étienne was more comfortable here than he had been at Rasseneur’s; the bed wasn’t bad, and they changed the sheets once a month. The soup was better, too, and his only regret was the lack of meat for dinner. But everyone was in the same straits, and he could hardly expect rabbit at every meal when he was paying forty-five francs for his board and lodging. Those forty-five francs helped the family to make ends meet more or less, while leaving various small debts to accumulate. And the Maheus showed their gratitude towards their lodger; his laundry was washed and mended, his buttons were sewn back on and his things tidied. In short, he could feel the benefits of a woman’s touch.","Étienne only complained of Jeanlin, who slept curled up.

On the whole, Étienne was better off than at Rasseneur's; the bed was tolerable and the sheets were changed every month. He had better soup, too, and only suffered from the rarity of meat. But they were all in the same condition, and for forty-five francs he could not demand rabbit to every meal. These forty-five francs helped the family and enabled them to make both ends meet, though always leaving some small debts and arrears; so the Maheus were grateful to their lodger; his linen was washed and mended, his buttons sewn on, and his affairs kept in order; in fact he felt all around him a woman's neatness and care."
"Assis de l’autre côté de la table, Étienne dit enfin :","Seated on the other side of the table, Étienne finally said:","Sitting on the other side of the table, Étienne said finally:","Seated on the other side of the table, Étienne at last said:"

"Alors, Étienne et Catherine, comme il arrivait près d’eux, l’aperçurent qui s’étranglait entre les roches. Il avait buté, il s’était cassé les deux jambes de devant. D’un dernier effort, il se traîna quelques mètres ; mais ses flancs ne passaient plus, il restait enveloppé, garrotté par la terre. Et sa tête saignante s’allongea, chercha encore une fente, de ses gros yeux troubles. L’eau le recouvrait rapidement, il se mit à hennir, du râle prolongé, atroce, dont les autres chevaux étaient morts déjà, dans l’écurie. Ce fut une agonie effroyable, cette vieille bête, fracassée, immobilisée, se débattant à cette profondeur, loin du jour. Son cri de détresse ne cessait pas, le flot noyait sa crinière, qu’il le poussait plus rauque, de sa bouche tendue et grande ouverte. Il y eut un dernier ronflement, le bruit sourd d’un tonneau qui s’emplit. Puis un grand silence tomba.","Then Étienne and Catherine, as he approached them, saw him strangled between the rocks. He had stumbled, he had broken his two front legs. With a last effort, he dragged himself a few yards; but his flanks could no longer pass, he remained enveloped, garrotted by the earth. And his bleeding head stretched out, searching for a crack again, with his big troubled eyes. The water quickly covered him, he began to neigh, the prolonged, atrocious rattle of which the other horses had already died, in the stable. It was a terrible agony, this old beast, shattered, immobilized, struggling at this depth, far from the day. His cry of distress did not cease, the flood drowned his mane, which he pushed more hoarsely, with his tense and wide open mouth. There was a final hum, the thud of a barrel filling. Then a great silence fell.","As he came nearer, Étienne and Catherine watched the rocks seize him in a stranglehold. The horse stumbled, breaking both forelegs. With one last effort he dragged himself forward for a few metres, but his haunches were wedged and he could not get through; he was trapped, caught in a noose by the earth itself. Blood was pouring from his head as he stretched out his neck and searched with wide, glazed eyes for some other way through the rock. The water was rapidly covering him, and he began to whinny with the same long, agonized cry that the other horses had given when they died in the stable. It was an appalling death as the old animal lay there in the depths of the earth, wedged tight, his bones broken, fighting for his life far from the light of day. His cry of distress went on and on, and even when the water washed over his mane it continued, only more rasping as he stretched his mouth wide, up into the air. There was one last, muffled snort, like the gurgle from a filling barrel. Then a deep silence fell.","Then Étienne and Catherine, as he came near them, perceived that he was strangling between the rocks. He had stumbled and broken his two front legs. With a last effort, he dragged himself a few metres, but his flanks could not pass; he remained hemmed in and garrotted by the earth. With his bleeding head stretched out, he still sought for some crack with his great troubled eyes. The water was rapidly covering him; he began to neigh with that terrible prolonged death-rattle with which the other horses had already died in the stable. It was a sight of fearful agony, this old beast shattered and motionless, struggling at this depth, far from the daylight.

"Étienne aurait vendu sa chair. Il avait abandonné ses appointements, il était allé à Marchiennes engager son pantalon et sa redingote de drap, heureux de faire bouillir encore la marmite des Maheu. Seules, les bottes lui restaient, il les gardait pour avoir les pieds solides, disait-il. Son désespoir était que la grève se fût produite trop tôt, lorsque la caisse de prévoyance n’avait pas eu le temps de s’emplir. Il y voyait la cause unique du désastre, car les ouvriers triompheraient sûrement des patrons, le jour où ils trouveraient dans l’épargne l’argent nécessaire à la résistance. Et il se rappelait les paroles de Souvarine, accusant la Compagnie de pousser à la grève, pour détruire les premiers fonds de la caisse.","Étienne would have sold his flesh. He had given up his salary, he had gone to Marchiennes to pledge his trousers and his frock coat, happy to keep the Maheu pot boiling again. Only the boots remained to him, he kept them to have solid feet, he said. His despair was that the strike had come too soon, when the provident fund had not had time to fill up. He saw in it the sole cause of the disaster, because the workers would surely triumph over the bosses, the day when they would find in savings the money necessary for resistance. And he remembered the words of Souvarine, accusing the Company of pushing for a strike, to destroy the first funds of the fund.","Étienne would have sold his flesh. He had stopped taking his secretarial salary and pawned his smart woollen coat and trousers in Marchiennes, happy to be able to keep the Maheus’ pot on the boil. All he had left were his boots, which he had kept, he said, so that his kicks would hurt. His major regret was that the strike had come too soon, before his provident fund had had time to accumulate. For him that was the only explanation for why they were in the present disastrous situation: come the day when they had saved enough money to fund their struggle, the workers would surely triumph over the bosses. And he remembered how Souvarine had accused the Company of provoking the strike so as to destroy the fund while it was still small.","Étienne would have sold his flesh. He had given up his salary and had gone to Marchiennes to pawn his trousers and cloth coat, happy to set the Maheus' pot boiling once more.

He regarded this as the only cause of the disaster, for the workers would surely triumph over the masters on the day when they had saved enough money to resist. And he recalled Souvarine's words accusing the Company of pushing forward the strike to destroy the fund at the beginning."
"Dès ce moment, ils se relayèrent, toujours l’un d’eux écoutait, prêt à correspondre, au moindre signal. Ils saisirent bientôt des coups de rivelaine : on commençait les travaux d’approche, on ouvrait une galerie. Pas un bruit ne leur échappait. Mais leur joie tomba. Ils avaient beau rire, pour se tromper l’un l’autre, le désespoir les reprenait peu à peu. D’abord, ils s’étaient répandus en explications : on arrivait évidemment par Réquillart, la galerie descendait dans la couche, peut-être en ouvrait-on plusieurs, car il y avait trois hommes à l’abattage. Puis ils parlèrent moins, ils finirent par se taire, quand ils en vinrent à calculer la masse énorme qui les séparait des camarades. Muets, ils continuaient leurs réflexions, ils comptaient les journées et les journées qu’un ouvrier mettrait à percer un tel bloc. Jamais on ne les rejoindrait assez tôt, ils seraient morts vingt fois. Et, mornes, n’osant plus échanger une parole dans ce redoublement d’angoisse, ils répondaient aux appels d’un roulement de sabots, sans espoir, en ne gardant que le besoin machinal de dire aux autres qu’ils vivaient encore.","From that moment, they took turns, always one of them listening, ready to correspond, at the slightest signal. They soon caught the blows of the riverbank: they were starting the approach works, they were opening a gallery. Not a sound escaped them. But their joy fell. They laughed in vain, to deceive each other, despair took hold of them little by little. At first, they had poured out explanations: we obviously arrived by Réquillart, the gallery descended into the layer, perhaps several of them were opened, for there were three men at the slaughter. Then they spoke less, they ended up being silent, when they came to calculate the enormous mass which separated them from their comrades. Silent, they continued their reflections, they counted the days and the days that a workman would take to pierce such a block. We would never catch up with them soon enough, they would have died twenty times over. And, mournful, no longer daring to exchange a word in this redoubled anguish, they answered the calls with a rolling of hooves, without hope, keeping only the mechanical need to tell the others that they were still alive.","From then on they took it in turns so that one of them was always listening and ready to reply to the slightest signal. Soon they could hear the sound of picks: they must be beginning to cut a way through to them, they must be sinking a new shaft. Not a sound escaped them. But their elation subsided. Try as they might to put on a brave face for each other, they were beginning to lose hope again. At first they had discussed the situation endlessly: it was clear the men were coming from Réquillart, they were digging down through the seam, perhaps they were making three shafts, because there were always three men digging. But then they began to talk less and eventually relapsed into silence when they considered the enormous mass of rock separating them from the comrades. They pursued their thoughts in silence, calculating the days upon days it would take someone to bore through so much rock. The men would never reach them in time, they could both have died twenty times over by then. Not daring to say anything to each other as their own anguish increased, they gloomily answered the calls by drumming out their signal with the clogs, not in hope but out of an instinctive need to let people know that they were still alive.","From that moment they relieved each other, one of them always listening, ready to answer at the least signal. They soon caught the sounds of the pick; the work of approaching them was beginning, a gallery was being opened. Not a sound escaped them. But their joy sank. In vain they laughed to deceive each other; despair was gradually seizing them. At first they entered into long explanations; evidently they were being approached from Réquillart. The gallery descended in the bed; perhaps several were being opened, for there were always three men hewing. Then they talked less, and were at last silent when they came to calculate the enormous mass which separated them from their mates. They continued their reflections in silence, counting the days and days that a workman would take to penetrate such a block. They would never be reached soon enough; they would have time to die twenty times over. And no longer venturing to exchange a word in this redoubled anguish, they gloomily replied to the appeals by a roll of the sabots, without hope, only retaining the mechanical need to tell the others that they were still alive."

"Un instant, Étienne hésita à l’appeler, pour l’empêcher de faire quelque bêtise. La lune s’était cachée, il l’avait vu se ramasser sur lui-même, prêt à bondir ; mais la lune reparaissait, et l’enfant restait accroupi. À chaque tour, la sentinelle s’avançait jusqu’à la cabane, puis tournait le dos et repartait. Et, brusquement, comme un nuage jetait ses ténèbres, Jeanlin sauta sur les épaules du soldat, d’un bond énorme de chat sauvage, s’y agrippa de ses griffes, lui enfonça dans la gorge son couteau grand ouvert. Le col de crin résistait, il dut appuyer des deux mains sur le manche, s’y prendre de tout le poids de son corps. Souvent, il avait saigné des poulets, qu’il surprenait derrière les fermes. Cela fut si rapide, qu’il y eut seulement dans la nuit un cri étouffé, pendant que le fusil tombait avec un bruit de ferraille. Déjà, la lune, très blanche, luisait.","For a moment Etienne hesitated to call him, to prevent him from doing something stupid. The moon had hidden itself, he had seen it curl up on itself, ready to spring; but the moon reappeared, and the child remained squatting. At each turn, the sentry would advance to the cabin, then turn his back and walk away. And suddenly, as a cloud cast its shadows, Jeanlin leapt on the soldier's shoulders with the enormous leap of a wildcat, clutched at him with his claws, plunged his open knife into his throat. The horsehair collar resisted, he had to press down on the handle with both hands, gripping it with all the weight of his body. Often he had bled chickens, which he surprised behind the farms. It was so rapid that there was only a stifled cry in the night, while the gun fell with the sound of iron. Already the moon, very white, was shining.","For a moment Étienne wondered if he should call out to him, to stop him doing anything silly. Just as the moon went behind a cloud, he had seen him getting ready to pounce; but then the moon came out again, and the child was still crouching there. On each occasion the sentry would come as far as the hut, then turn on his heels and walk away. Suddenly, just as another cloud cast everything into darkness, Jeanlin sprang on to the sentry’s shoulders in one enormous bound, like a wild cat, clung on by his nails, and plunged his opened knife into the man’s throat from behind. The soldier’s horsehair collar obstructed the blade, and Jeanlin had to press the handle in with both hands and pull it towards him using the full weight of his body. He was used to slitting chicken’s throats, having caught them unawares behind some farm building. It was all over so quickly that the only sound in the darkness was a muffled cry, followed by the clatter of the gun as it fell to the ground. The moon was already gleaming a brilliant white once more.","For a moment Étienne thought of calling him to prevent the execution of some stupid trick. The moon was hidden. He had seen him draw himself up ready to spring; but the moon reappeared, and the child remained crouching. At every turn the sentinel came as far as the cabin, then turned his back and walked in the opposite direction. And suddenly, as a cloud threw its shadow, Jeanlin leapt on to the soldier's shoulders with the great bound of a wild cat, and gripping him with his claws buried his large open knife in his throat. The horse-hair collar resisted; he had to apply both hands to the handle and hang on with all the weight of his body. He had often bled fowls which he had found behind farms. It was so rapid that there was only a stifled cry in the night, while the musket fell with the sound of old iron. Already the moon was shining again."
"Catherine, cependant, préoccupée, venait de parler bas à son père. Celui-ci s’étonna, puis il approuva d’un hochement de tête ; et, appelant Étienne pour lui rendre son paquet :","Catherine, however, preoccupied, had just whispered to her father. The latter was surprised, then he nodded in approval; and, calling Étienne to give him back his package:","Meanwhile Catherine’s thoughts had been elsewhere, and she had just whispered something to her father.

"Levaque avait gagné, on lâcha les quilles pour vider les chopes. Mais Maheu refusa d’en boire une seconde : on verrait plus tard, la journée n’était pas finie. Il venait de songer à Pierron.

"Alors, en deux minutes, Jean-Bart se vida. Jeanlin, qui avait trouvé une corne d’appel, soufflait, poussait des sons rauques, comme s’il avait rassemblé des bœufs. Les femmes, la Brûlé, la Levaque, la Mouquette relevaient leurs jupes pour courir ; tandis que Levaque, une hache à la main, la manœuvrait ainsi qu’une canne de tambour-major. D’autres camarades arrivaient toujours, on était près de mille, sans ordre, coulant de nouveau sur la route en un torrent débordé. La voie de sortie était trop étroite, des palissades furent rompues.","So, in two minutes, Jean-Bart was empty. Jeanlin, who had found a call horn, was blowing, making hoarse sounds, as if he had herded oxen. The women, la Brûlé, la Levaque, la Mouquette lifted their skirts to run; while Levaque, an ax in hand, maneuvered it like a drum major's cane. Other comrades were still arriving, nearly a thousand of us, without order, flowing down the road again in an overflowing torrent.

"Et les neuf sous disparurent. Pour lui fermer la bouche, il l’avait empoignée en riant, il se roulait avec elle sur le terri. C’était sa petite femme, ils essayaient ensemble, dans les coins noirs, l’amour qu’ils entendaient et qu’ils voyaient chez eux, derrière les cloisons, par les fentes des portes. Ils savaient tout, mais ils ne pouvaient guère, trop jeunes, tâtonnant, jouant, pendant des heures, à des jeux de petits chiens vicieux.

To close her mouth, he had grabbed her, laughing, he was rolling with her on the floor.

They knew everything, but they could hardly, too young, groping, playing, for hours, at games of vicious little dogs. He called it ""doing mom and dad""; and, when he led her away, she galloped, she allowed herself to be taken with the delicious trembling of instinct, often angry, but always yielding in the expectation of something which did not come.","And the nine sous vanished.

Maintenant, il fallait que l’un des deux mangeât l’autre.","Suddenly, Étienne wanted to slap the comrade. The fear of stirring up the settlement by a battle had restrained him from snatching Catherine from his hands. But, in turn, a rage prevailed, and the two men found themselves face to face, blood in their eyes. It was an old hatred, a long unacknowledged jealousy, which burst forth. Now one of them had to eat the other.","At that, Étienne was ready to hit Chaval. He had been afraid that a fight might destroy the atmosphere of calm in the village, and this had kept him from snatching Catherine out of the man’s hands. But now it was his turn to be furious, and the two men stood face to face, with blood in their eyes. Theirs was an ancient hatred, a long, unspoken, jealous rivalry, and it burst into the open. This time one of them would have to pay.","At this Étienne was about to strike his mate. The fear of arousing the settlement by a fight had kept him back from snatching Catherine from Chaval's hands. But rage was now carrying him away, and the two men were face to face with inflamed eyes. It was an old hatred, a jealousy long unacknowledged, which was breaking out. One of them now must do for the other."
"Dès ce moment, la lutte continua entre M. Hennebeau et lui, comme si les autres mineurs n’avaient plus été là.","From that moment the struggle continued between Mr. Hennebeau and himself, as if the other miners had no longer been there.","From then on the battle lay between M.

"M. Hennebeau, qui justement rentrait à cette heure, monté sur sa jument, prêtait l’oreille à ces bruits perdus. Il avait rencontré des couples, tout un lent défilé de promeneurs, par cette belle soirée d’hiver. Encore des galants qui allaient, la bouche sur la bouche, prendre du plaisir derrière les murs. N’étaient-ce pas là ses rencontres habituelles, des filles culbutées au fond de chaque fossé, des gueux se bourrant de la seule joie qui ne coûtait rien ? Et ces imbéciles se plaignaient de la vie, lorsqu’ils avaient, à pleines ventrées, cet unique bonheur de s’aimer ! Volontiers, il aurait crevé de faim comme eux, s’il avait pu recommencer l’existence avec une femme qui se serait donnée à lui sur des cailloux, de tous ses reins et de tout son cœur. Son malheur était sans consolation, il enviait ces misérables. La tête basse, il rentrait, au pas ralenti de son cheval, désespéré par ces longs bruits, perdus au fond de la campagne noire, et où il n’entendait que des baisers.","M. Hennebeau, who was just returning home at this hour, mounted on his mare, listened to these stray noises. He had met couples, a whole slow parade of walkers, on this beautiful winter evening. More suitors who went, mouth to mouth, to take pleasure behind the walls. Weren't these his usual encounters, girls tumbling into the bottom of every ditch, beggars stuffing themselves with the only joy that cost nothing? And these imbeciles complained about life, when they had, to their full bellies, this unique happiness of loving one another! Willingly, he would have starved like them, if he had been able to begin life again with a woman who would have given herself to him on stones, with all her loins and all her heart. His misfortune was without consolation, he envied these wretches. With lowered head, he returned, at the slow pace of his horse, despairing by these long noises, lost in the depths of the dark countryside, and where he heard only kisses.","M. Hennebeau was riding home just then, and he listened to these far-away sounds. He had passed many couples this fine winter’s evening, a whole procession of them out for a stroll. Still more lovers off to take their pleasure behind some wall or other, mouth against mouth! Was not this what he usually encountered, girls flat on their backs in some ditch and good-for-nothing lads busy enjoying the only pleasure that didn’t cost money! And to think that these fools complained about life, when they could have love, the one and only happiness, and as much as they jolly well pleased! He would gladly starve like them if he could start life over again with a woman who would give herself to him on the bare ground, unreservedly, body and soul. In his own unhappiness he was not to be consoled, and he envied these poor wretched people. Head bowed, he rode slowly home, deep in despair at all these noises he could hear far away in the countryside and which for him could only be the sounds of love.","M. Hennebeau, who was at this hour returning home mounted on his mare, listened to these vague sounds. He had met couples, long rows of strollers, on this beautiful winter night.

Was it not what he always met, girls tumbled over at the bottom of every ditch, beggars who crammed themselves with the only joy that cost nothing?

"Étienne, d’abord, lutta contre cette démence. Mais une contagion ébranlait sa tête plus solide, il perdit la sensation juste du réel. Tous leurs sens se faussaient, surtout ceux de Catherine, agitée de fièvre, tourmentée à présent d’un besoin de paroles et de gestes. Les bourdonnements de ses oreilles étaient devenus des murmures d’eau courante, des chants d’oiseaux ; et elle sentait un violent parfum d’herbes écrasées, et elle voyait clair, de grandes taches jaunes volaient devant ses yeux, si larges, qu’elle se croyait dehors, près du canal, dans les blés, par une journée de beau soleil.","Étienne, at first, struggled against this madness.

"Vivement, l’autre se mit debout, car il avait compris, au sifflement de la voix, que le camarade allait en finir.

"Vers deux heures, les femmes du coron tentèrent, de leur côté, une démarche près de Maigrat. Il n’y avait plus que cet espoir, fléchir cet homme, lui arracher une nouvelle semaine de crédit. C’était une idée de la Maheude, qui comptait souvent trop sur le bon cœur des gens. Elle décida la Brûlé et la Levaque à l’accompagner ; quant à la Pierronne, elle s’excusa, elle raconta qu’elle ne pouvait quitter Pierron, dont la maladie n’en finissait pas de guérir. D’autres femmes se joignirent à la bande, elles étaient bien une vingtaine. Lorsque les bourgeois de Montsou les virent arriver, tenant la largeur de la route, sombres et misérables, ils hochèrent la tête d’inquiétude. Des portes se fermèrent, une dame cacha son argenterie. On les rencontrait ainsi pour la première fois, et rien n’était d’un plus mauvais signe : d’ordinaire, tout se gâtait, quand les femmes battaient ainsi les chemins. Chez Maigrat, il y eut une scène violente. D’abord, il les avait fait entrer, ricanant, feignant de croire qu’elles venaient payer leurs dettes : ça, c’était gentil, de s’être entendu, pour apporter l’argent d’un coup. Puis, dès que la Maheude eut pris la parole, il affecta de s’emporter. Est-ce qu’elles se fichaient du monde ? Encore du crédit, elles rêvaient donc de le mettre sur la paille ? Non, plus une pomme de terre, plus une miette de pain ! Et il les renvoyait à l’épicier Verdonck, aux boulangers Carouble et Smelten, puisqu’elles se servaient chez eux, maintenant. Les femmes l’écoutaient d’un air d’humilité peureuse, s’excusaient, guettaient dans ses yeux s’il se laissait attendrir. Il recommença à dire des farces, il offrit sa boutique à la Brûlé, si elle le prenait pour galant. Une telle lâcheté les tenait toutes, qu’elles en rirent ; et la Levaque renchérit, déclara qu’elle voulait bien, elle. Mais il fut aussitôt grossier, il les poussa vers la porte. Comme elles insistaient, suppliantes, il en brutalisa une. Les autres, sur le trottoir, le traitèrent de vendu, tandis que la Maheude, les deux bras en l’air dans un élan d’indignation vengeresse, appelait la mort, en criant qu’un homme pareil ne méritait pas de manger.","About two o'clock the women of the settlement attempted, on their side, to approach Maigrat. There was nothing left but this hope, to bend this man, to snatch a new week of credit from him. It was an idea of Maheude, who often relied too much on people's good hearts. She persuaded la Brûlé and la Levaque to accompany her; as for Pierronne, she apologized, she said that she could not leave Pierron, whose illness never ceased to heal. Other women joined the band, they were in their twenties. When the citizens of Montsou saw them coming, holding the width of the road, gloomy and miserable, they shook their heads in concern. Doors closed, a lady hid her silverware. We met them like this for the first time, and nothing could be a worse sign: ordinarily, everything went wrong when women walked the streets like this. At Maigrat's there was a violent scene. First, he had let them in, sneering, pretending to believe that they had come to pay their debts: that was nice, to have agreed to bring the money all at once. Then, as soon as Maheude had spoken, he affected to lose his temper. Did they care about the world? More credit, so they dreamed of putting it on the straw? No, no more a potato, no more a crumb of bread! And he sent them back to the grocer Verdonck, to the bakers Carouble and Smelten, since they helped themselves at home now. The women listened to him with an air of fearful humility, apologized, watched in his eyes if he allowed himself to be moved. He began to tell jokes again, he offered his shop to La Brûlé, if she took him for a lover. Such cowardice possessed them all that they laughed at it; and La Levaque went one better, declared that she was willing. But he was immediately rude, he pushed them towards the door. As they insisted, pleading, he brutalized one. The others, on the sidewalk, called him sold out, while Maheude, with both arms in the air in a surge of avenging indignation, called for death, crying that such a man did not deserve to eat.","About two o’clock it was the women’s turn to try one last approach to Maigrat. Their only remaining hope was to talk the man round and extract another week’s credit from him. The idea came from La Maheude, who tended to rely too often on people’s goodness. She persuaded La Brûlé and La Levaque to go with her; La Pierronne excused herself on the grounds that she had to stay and look after Pierron, who was still not well. Other women joined the group, which numbered about twenty. When the bourgeois of Montsou saw them arriving, a line of sombre, wretched-looking women taking up the whole width of the road, they shook their heads with misgiving. Doors were shut, and one lady hid her silver. It was the first time they had been seen like this, and it was a very grave sign indeed: things usually went from bad to worse once the women took to the highways. There was a terrible scene at Maigrat’s. At first he had ushered them in with with a sneering laugh, affecting to believe that they had come to pay their debts; how kind of them to have arranged to come all together like this, and just so they could return all his money at once! Then, when La Maheude began to speak, he pretended to fly into a rage. What kind of a joke was this? More credit? Did they want him to end up sleeping in the gutter? No, not a single potato, not so much as a single crumb of bread! He suggested they try Verdonck the grocer or Carouble and Smelten the bakers, for wasn’t that where they took their custom now? The women listened to him with an air of frightened humility, apologizing to him and watching his eyes for any sign that he might relent. Instead he started on his usual banter, offering La Brûlé his whole shop if she would have him. They were all so cowed that they laughed; and La Levaque went one better by declaring that she personally was ready and willing. But he became rough with them again and herded them towards the door. When they went on begging him, he shoved one of them aside. Outside in the street the other women were accusing him of being a Company stooge, and La Maheude raised her arms to the sky in vengeful outrage, calling death down upon him and screaming that such a man did not deserve to eat.","Towards two o'clock the women of the settlement, on their side, made an application to Maigrat. There was only this hope left, to bend this man and to wrench from him another week's credit. The idea originated with Maheude, who often counted too much on people's good-nature. She persuaded the Brulé and the Levaque to accompany her; as to Pierronne, she excused herself, saying that she could not leave Pierron, whose illness still continued. Other women joined the band till they numbered quite twenty. When the inhabitants of Montsou saw them arrive, gloomy and wretched, occupying the whole width of the road, they shook their heads anxiously. Doors were closed, and one lady hid her plate. It was the first time they had been seen thus, and there could not be a worse sign: usually everything was going to ruin when the women thus took to the roads. At Maigrat's there was a violent scene. At first, he had made them go in, jeering and pretending to believe that they had come to pay their debts: that was nice of them to have agreed to come and bring the money all at once. Then, as soon as Maheude began to speak he pretended to be enraged. Were they making fun of people? More credit! Then they wanted to turn him into the street? No, not a single potato, not a single crumb of bread! And he told them to be off to the grocer Verdonck, and to the bakers Carouble and Smelten, since they now dealt with them. The women listened with timid humility, apologizing, and watching his eyes to see if he would relent. He began to joke, offering his shop to the Brulé if she would have him as a lover. They were all so cowardly that they laughed at this; and the Levaque improved on it, declaring that she was willing, she was. But he at once became abusive, and pushed them towards the door. As they insisted, suppliantly, he treated one brutally. The others on the pavement shouted that he had sold himself to the Company, while Maheude, with her arms in the air, in a burst of avenging indignation, cried out for his death, exclaiming that such a man did not deserve to eat."
"– Non, rien du tout ! hurla-t-elle.",- No nothing at all ! she screamed.,"‘No, not one inch!’ she screamed.","""No, never!"" she shouted."
"Il n’y avait donc ni dragons ni gendarmes, à la Victoire ? On l’ignorait. Tous semblaient rassurés. Et, faisant volte-face, ils descendirent du côté de Beaumont, ils coupèrent à travers champs, pour rattraper la route de Joiselle. La voie du chemin de fer leur barrait le passage, ils la traversèrent en renversant les clôtures. Maintenant, ils se rapprochaient de Montsou, l’ondulation lente des terrains s’abaissait, élargissait la mer des pièces de betteraves, très loin, jusqu’aux maisons noires de Marchiennes.","So there were neither dragoons nor gendarmes at Victory? We didn't know. Everyone seemed reassured. And, turning around, they descended towards Beaumont, they cut across the fields to catch up with the road to Joiselle.

Nobody could say, but everyone seemed reassured. And so they turned on their heels and raced down the Beaumont hill, cutting across the fields to rejoin the Joiselle road. The railway line stood in their path, but they knocked down the fences and passed over it. They were now getting close to Montsou, the gently undulating terrain was flattening out, and the sea of beetfields was beginning to stretch away towards the dark buildings of Marchiennes in the distance.","Were there,, then, neither soldiers nor police at the Victoire? Nobody knew. All seemed reassured. And turning round they descended from the Beaumont side and cut across the fields to reach the Joiselle road.

"Étienne patientait, caché derrière un buisson, lorsqu’il entendit, parmi les branches, un long frôlement. Il crut à la fuite effrayée d’une couleuvre. Mais la brusque lueur d’une allumette l’étonna, et il demeura stupéfait, en reconnaissant Jeanlin qui allumait une chandelle et qui s’abîmait dans la terre. Une curiosité si vive le saisit, qu’il s’approcha du trou : l’enfant avait disparu, une lueur faible venait du deuxième palier. Il hésita un instant, puis se laissa rouler, en se tenant aux racines, pensa faire le saut des cinq cent vingt-quatre mètres que mesurait la fosse, finit pourtant par sentir un échelon. Et il descendit doucement. Jeanlin n’avait rien dû entendre, Étienne voyait toujours, sous lui, la lumière s’enfoncer, tandis que l’ombre du petit, colossale et inquiétante, dansait, avec le déhanchement de ses jambes infirmes. Il gambillait, d’une adresse de singe à se rattraper des mains, des pieds, du menton, quand des échelons manquaient. Les échelles, de sept mètres, se succédaient, les unes solides encore, les autres branlantes, craquantes, près de se rompre ; les paliers étroits défilaient, verdis, pourris tellement, qu’on marchait comme dans la mousse ; et, à mesure qu’on descendait, la chaleur était suffocante, une chaleur de four, qui venait du goyot de tirage, heureusement peu actif depuis la grève, car en temps de travail, lorsque le foyer mangeait ses cinq mille kilogrammes de houille par jour, on n’aurait pu se risquer là, sans se rôtir le poil.","Étienne was waiting, hidden behind a bush, when he heard a long rustling among the branches. He believed in the frightened flight of a snake. But the sudden flicker of a match astonished him, and he was stupefied on recognizing Jeanlin who was lighting a candle and sinking into the ground. A curiosity so lively seized him that he approached the hole: the child had disappeared, a faint gleam came from the second landing. He hesitated for a moment, then let himself roll, holding on to the roots, thought of jumping the five hundred and twenty-four meters that the pit measured, but finally felt a rung. And he descended slowly. Jeanlin must not have heard anything, Étienne could still see the light sinking beneath him, while the shadow of the child, colossal and disturbing, danced with the swaying of his crippled legs. He gambolled with the skill of a monkey to catch up with his hands, his feet, his chin, when rungs were missing. The ladders, seven meters high, followed one another, some still solid, others rickety, creaking, on the point of breaking; the narrow landings filed past, green, so rotten, that one walked as if in moss; and, as we descended, the heat was suffocating, a heat of oven, which came from the gully, fortunately not very active since the strike, because in time of work, when the hearth ate up its five thousand kilograms of coal per day, we couldn't have risked ourselves there, without roasting our hair.","Étienne was waiting patiently behind a bush when he heard a prolonged slithering through the branches. He thought he might have disturbed an adder. But the sudden flaring of a match startled him, and he was astonished to see Jeanlin lighting a candle and disappearing below ground. Full of curiosity he approached the hole: the child had vanished, but a faint gleam of light could be seen coming from the second platform down. After a moment’s hesitation Étienne grabbed some roots and lowered himself, wondering if he would fall the full five hundred and twenty-four metres of the shaft’s depth, but eventually feeling a rung beneath his foot. And then gently he descended. Jeanlin could not have heard him because the light continued to recede beneath him, and the huge menacing shadow cast by the small boy flickered on the walls of the shaft as his hips swayed wildly on account of his damaged legs. He was swinging downwards like a monkey, using hands or feet or chin to hold on whenever rungs were missing. Ladder followed ladder, each seven metres long, some still solid, others loose or cracking and ready to break; and platform followed narrow platform, each one rotting and green with mould, which made it like stepping on moss; and as they descended, the heat became suffocating, because of the fumes coming up the shaft from the furnace. Fortunately it had barely been fired since the strike began, because under normal working conditions, when the furnace consumed five thousand kilograms of coal per day, no one could ever have risked such a descent unless he was ready to be roasted alive.","Étienne was waiting patiently, hidden behind a bush, when he heard a long rustling among the branches. He thought at first that it was the scared flight of a snake. But the sudden gleam of a match astonished him, and he was stupefied on recognizing Jeanlin, who was lighting a candle and burying himself in the earth. He was seized with curiosity, and approached the hole; the child had disappeared, and a faint gleam came from the second adder. Étienne hesitated a moment, and then let himself go, holding on to the roots. He thought for a moment that he was about to fall down the whole five hundred and eighty metres of the mine, but at last he felt a rung, and descended gently. Jeanlin had evidently heard nothing. Étienne constantly saw the light sinking beneath him, while the little one's shadow, colossal and disturbing, danced with the deformed gait of his distorted limbs. He kicked his legs about with the skill of a monkey, catching on with hands, feet, or chin where he rungs were wanting. Ladders, seven metres in length, followed one another, some still firm, others shaky, yielding and almost broken; the steps were narrow and green, so rotten that one seemed to walk in moss; and as one went down the heat grew suffocating, :he heat of an oven proceeding from the air-shaft which was, fortunately, not very active now the strike was on, or when the furnace devoured its five thousand kilograms of coal a day, one could not have risked oneself here without scorching one's hair."
"Maintenant, lorsque Étienne se promenait, le soir, ce n’était plus derrière le terri qu’il effarouchait des amoureux. Il suivait leurs sillages dans les blés, il devinait leurs nids d’oiseaux paillards, aux remous des épis jaunissants et des grands coquelicots rouges. Zacharie et Philomène y retournaient par une habitude de vieux ménage ; la mère Brûlé, toujours aux trousses de Lydie, la dénichait à chaque instant avec Jeanlin, terrés si profondément ensemble, qu’il fallait mettre le pied sur eux pour les décider à s’envoler ; et, quant à la Mouquette, elle gîtait partout, on ne pouvait traverser un champ, sans voir sa tête plonger, tandis que ses pieds seuls surnageaient, dans des culbutes à pleine échine. Mais tous ceux-là étaient bien libres, le jeune homme ne trouvait ça coupable que les soirs où il rencontrait Catherine et Chaval. Deux fois, il les vit, à son approche, s’abattre au milieu d’une pièce, dont les tiges immobiles restèrent mortes ensuite. Une autre fois, comme il suivait un étroit chemin, les yeux clairs de Catherine lui apparurent au ras des blés, puis se noyèrent. Alors, la plaine immense lui semblait trop petite, il préférait passer la soirée chez Rasseneur, à l’Avantage.","Now, when Étienne went for a walk in the evening, it was no longer behind the terri that he frightened off lovers. He followed their tracks in the wheat, he divined their nests of bawdy birds, in the eddies of the yellowing ears of corn and the great red poppies. Zacharie and Philomene returned there as a habit of old marriage; Mother Brûlé, always on the heels of Lydie, unearthed her at every moment with Jeanlin, buried so deeply together that it was necessary to set foot on them to persuade them to fly away; and, as for Mouquette, she was lying everywhere, one could not cross a field without seeing her head plunge, while her feet alone floated, in somersaults at full spine. But all of them were very free, the young man found that guilty only on the evenings when he met Catherine and Chaval. Twice he saw them, as he approached, fall down in the middle of a room, the motionless stems of which remained dead afterwards. Another time, as he was following a narrow path, Catherine's clear eyes appeared to him level with the wheat, then drowned. So, the immense plain seemed too small to him, he preferred to spend the evening at Rasseneur's, at the Avantage.","These days, whenever Étienne went for a stroll in the evening, it was no longer behind the spoil-heap that he came upon young couples. Now he would follow their tracks through the fields, and he could tell where the lovebirds were nesting from the movement of the ripening ears of corn or the tall red poppies. Zacharie and Philomène went back there out of habit, like an old married couple; La Brûlé, in her endless chasing after Lydie, was constantly running her to ground there with Jeanlin, the pair of them so deeply dug in that she had practically to step on them before they would take flight; and as for La Mouquette, she seemed to have lairs all over the place. It was impossible to cross a field without seeing her head ducking down and then just her legs sticking up as she lay pinned to the ground. As far as Étienne was concerned, they could all do as they pleased, except on the evenings when he came across Catherine and Chaval. Twice he saw them drop down in the middle of a field when they spotted him coming, and not a stalk moved afterwards. On another occasion, when he was walking along a narrow path, he saw Catherine’s crystal-clear eyes appear just above the corn and then sink from view. After that the whole vast plain seemed much too small a place, and he preferred to spend his evenings at Rasseneur’s bar, the Advantage.","When Étienne now went for a walk in the evening he no longer startled lovers behind the pit-bank. He could follow their track in the wheat and divine their wanton birds' nests by eddies among the yellowing blades and the great red poppies. Zacharie and Philoméne came back to it out of old domestic habit; Mother Brulé, always on Lydie's heels, was constantly hunting her out with Jeanlin, buried so deeply together that one had to tread on them before they made up their minds to get up; and as to Mouquette, she lay about everywhere--one could not cross a field without seeing her head plunge down while only her feet emerged as she lay at full length. But all these were quite free; the young man found nothing guilty there except on the evenings when he met Catherine and Chaval. Twice he saw them on his approach tumble down in the midst of a field, where the motionless stalks afterwards remained dead. Another time, as he was going along a narrow path, Catherine's clear eyes appeared before him, level with the wheat, and immediately sank. Then the immense plain seemed to him too small, and he preferred to pass the evening at Rasseneur's, in the Avantage."
– Eh bien ? lui demanda son oncle.,- Well ? asked his uncle.,‘Well?’ his uncle inquired.,"""Well?"" asked his uncle."
"Alors, quand cette idée des échelles les eut fait s’entêter davantage, Étienne comprit qu’il devait céder. Dans la crainte d’un plus grand désastre, il se précipita vers la machine, voulant au moins remonter les cages, pour que les câbles, sciés au-dessus du puits, ne pussent les broyer de leur poids énorme, en tombant sur elles. Le machineur avait disparu, ainsi que les quelques ouvriers du jour ; et il s’empara de la barre de mise en train, il manœuvra, pendant que Levaque et deux autres grimpaient à la charpente de fonte, qui supportait les molettes. Les cages étaient à peine fixées sur les verrous qu’on entendit le bruit strident de la lime mordant l’acier. Il se fit un grand silence, ce bruit sembla emplir la fosse entière, tous levaient la tête, regardaient, écoutaient, saisis d’émotion. Au premier rang, Maheu se sentait gagner d’une joie farouche, comme si les dents de la lime les eussent délivrés du malheur, en mangeant le câble d’un de ces trous de misère, où l’on ne descendrait plus.","So, when this idea of ladders had made them more stubborn, Étienne understood that he had to give in. In fear of a greater disaster, he rushed towards the machine, wanting at least to raise the cages, so that the cables, sawn above the shaft, could not crush them with their enormous weight, falling on them. The engineer had disappeared, as well as the few workmen of the day; and he seized the start-up bar, he maneuvered, while Levaque and two others climbed the cast-iron framework which supported the knurls. The cages were hardly fixed on the bolts when the shrill sound of the file biting the steel was heard. There was a great silence, this noise seemed to fill the entire pit, everyone raised their heads, looked, listened, seized with emotion. In the first row, Maheu felt himself overcome with a fierce joy, as if the teeth of the file had delivered them from misfortune, by eating the cable from one of those holes of misery, into which one would no longer descend.","When they remembered the ladders, everyone became even more determined, and Étienne realized that he would have to give way. Fearing an even worse disaster, he rushed towards the engine-house in the hope of at least being able to bring the cages up, so that if the cables were severed above the shaft, they wouldn’t smash the cages to pieces with their enormous weight when they fell on top of them. The mechanic in charge of it had disappeared along with the few other surface workers, and so Étienne grabbed the starting lever and pulled it while Levaque and two other men clambered up the iron framework that supported the pulleys. The cages had scarcely been locked into their keeps before the rasping sound of the file could be heard as it bit through the steel. There was total silence, and the sound seemed to fill the entire pit; everyone looked up in tense anticipation to watch and listen. Standing in the front row Maheu felt a surge of wild joy run through him, as though the blade of the file would deliver them all from evil by eating through the cable: this would be one miserable hole in the ground they would never have to go down again.","Then, when this idea of the ladders had made them still more obstinate, Étienne saw that he would have to yield. For fear of a greater disaster he hastened towards the engine, wishing at all events to bring the cages up, so that the cables, being cut above the shaft, should not smash them by falling down with their enormous weight. The engine-man had disappeared as well as the few daylight workers; and he took hold of the starting lever, manipulating it while Levaque and two other climbed up the metal scaffold which supported the pulleys. The cages were hardly fixed on the keeps when the strident sound was heard of the file biting into the steel. There was deep silence, and this noise seemed to fill the whole pit; all raised their heads, looking and listening, seized by emotion. In the first rank Maheu felt a fierce joy possess him, as if the teeth of the file would deliver them from misfortune by eating into the cable of one of these dens of wretchedness, into which they would never descend again."
"Et la Maheude dut dire leur âge, on lui adressa aussi des questions sur Estelle, par politesse. Respectueusement, le père Bonnemort avait retiré sa pipe de la bouche ; mais il n’en restait pas moins un sujet d’inquiétude, si ravagé par ses quarante années de fond, les jambes raides, la carcasse démolie, la face terreuse ; et, comme un violent accès de toux le prenait, il préféra sortir pour cracher dehors, dans l’idée que son crachat noir allait gêner le monde.","And Maheude had to say their age, they also asked her questions about Estelle, out of politeness. Respectfully, Father Bonnemort had removed his pipe from his mouth; but he remained none the less a cause for concern, so ravaged by his forty years of depth, stiff legs, demolished carcass, earthy face; and, as a violent fit of coughing seized him, he preferred to go out to spit outside, in the idea that his black spit was going to annoy the world.","La Maheude had to say how old each of them was, and then they politely asked her about Estelle too. As a mark of respect old Bonnemort had taken the pipe from his mouth; but he still presented a rather worrying sight, ravaged as he had so clearly been by forty years of working down the mine, with his stiff legs, crumpled body and ashen face; and when he was seized by a violent coughing fit, he thought he had better go and spit outside, thinking that his black phlegm might upset people.","And Maheude had to tell their ages; they also asked her questions about Estelle, out of politeness. Father Bonnemort respectfully took his pipe out of his mouth; but he was not the less a subject of uneasiness, so worn out by his forty years underground, with his stiff limbs, deformed body, and earthy face; and as a violent spasm of coughing took him he preferred to go and spit outside, with the idea that his black expectoration would make people uncomfortable."
"Ahurie, suffoquée par cette course de trois kilomètres qui l’avait encore une fois trempée de sueur, elle s’abandonnait, sans comprendre, aux remous de la foule. Alors, il la tira par le bras, à le lui briser ; et elle jeta une plainte, ses larmes jaillirent : déjà il oubliait son serment, jamais elle ne serait heureuse.","Stunned, suffocated by this three kilometer run which had once again soaked her in sweat, she abandoned herself, without understanding, to the eddies of the crowd. Then he pulled her by the arm, enough to break it; and she complained, her tears welled up: he had already forgotten his oath, she would never be happy.","Dazed and completely out of breath after this three-kilometre dash, which had once more soaked her in sweat, Catherine allowed herself to be swept along by the crowd, oblivious to what was happening. Then Chaval tugged her arm so hard he nearly broke it, and she let out a cry of pain and began to cry. He had forgotten his promise already, she would never be happy.","Out of breath, and suffocated by this race of three kilometres which had once more bathed her in sweat, she gave herself up, without understanding, to the eddies of the crowd. Then he pulled her by the arm, almost breaking it; and she cried with pain, her tears bursting out. Already he was forgetting his oath, never would she be happy."
"Dehors, Étienne, sorti avec eux, retrouva la Mouquette, qui semblait les suivre. Elle était toujours là, à le regarder de ses grands yeux fixes, riant de son rire de bonne fille, comme pour dire : « Veux-tu ? » Le jeune homme plaisanta, haussa les épaules. Alors, elle eut un geste de colère et se perdit dans la foule.","Outside, Etienne, who had gone out with them, found Mouquette, who seemed to be following them. She was still there, staring at him with her big staring eyes, laughing her good-girl laugh, as if to say, ""Do you want to?"" The young man joked, shrugged. Then she made a gesture of anger and lost herself in the crowd.","Étienne followed them outside, where he found La Mouquette; she appeared to be following them. She was always there watching him with her big, staring eyes and laughing in her good-natured way as though to say: ‘Do you want to?’ Étienne made a joke of it and shrugged, whereupon she gestured angrily and disappeared into the crowd.","Outside, Étienne who had gone with them found Mouquette, who seemed to be following them. She was always there, looking at him with her large fixed eyes, laughing her good-natured laugh, as if to say: ""Are you willing?"" The young man joked and shrugged his shoulders. Then, with a gesture of anger, she was lost in the crowd."
"Elle se tourna vers son père et sa mère, elle se tourna vers les autres.","She turned to her father and her mother, she turned to the others.",She turned to her father and mother and to everyone else standing there.,She turned towards her father and her mother; she turned towards the others.
"Mais une secousse agitait Bonnemort, un raclement profond qui semblait lui monter du ventre ; et il cracha dans le plat, un épais crachat noir. La cendre en était trempée, une boue de charbon, tout le charbon de la mine qu’il se tirait de la gorge. Déjà, il avait repris son immobilité. Il ne remuait plus, de loin en loin, que pour cracher.","But a jolt shook Bonnemort, a deep scraping that seemed to rise from his stomach; and he spat into the dish, a thick black spit. The ashes were soaked with it, a slurry of coal, all the coal from the mine he was dragging down his throat. Already he had resumed his immobility. He no longer moved, from time to time, except to spit.","But Bonnemort began to shake as a rasping sound seemed to rise up from the depths of his stomach, and he spat a thick, black gob of phlegm into the plate. The ash was saturated, a black sludge where he had heaved up all the coal-dust that had ever passed down his throat. Again he was still. He never moved now, except every once in a while like this to spit.","But Bonnemort was shaken by some agitation, a deep scraping which seemed to arise from his belly, and he expectorated into the plate a thick black expectoration. The ashes were soaked into a coaly mud, all the coal of the mine which he drew from his chest. He had already resumed his immobility. He stirred no more, except at intervals, to spit."
"– Foutu sort ! dit Jeanlin, ça ne finira pas… Vas-y, Bébert ! tire sur la queue !","- Damn fate! said Jeanlin, it won't end… Go ahead, Bébert! pull the tail!","‘Just our bloody luck!’ said Jeanlin. ‘It never stops…Go on, Bébert, grab it by the tail.’","""Damned luck!"" said Jeanlin. ""This will never finish. Go on, Bébert! Hang on to its tail!"""
"Quand il eut repris son paquet, Étienne ne s’éloigna pas encore. Il sentait les rafales lui glacer le dos, pendant que sa poitrine brûlait, devant le grand feu. Peut-être, tout de même, ferait-il bien de s’adresser à la fosse : le vieux pouvait ne pas savoir ; puis, il se résignait, il accepterait n’importe quelle besogne. Où aller et que devenir, à travers ce pays affamé par le chômage ? laisser derrière un mur sa carcasse de chien perdu ? Cependant, une hésitation le troublait, une peur du Voreux, au milieu de cette plaine rase, noyée sous une nuit si épaisse. À chaque bourrasque, le vent paraissait grandir, comme s’il eût soufflé d’un horizon sans cesse élargi. Aucune aube ne blanchissait dans le ciel mort, les hauts fourneaux seuls flambaient, ainsi que les fours à coke, ensanglantant les ténèbres, sans en éclairer l’inconnu. Et le Voreux, au fond de son trou, avec son tassement de bête méchante, s’écrasait davantage, respirait d’une haleine plus grosse et plus longue, l’air gêné par sa digestion pénible de chair humaine.","When he had picked up his package, Étienne did not yet go away. He felt the gusts freeze his back, while his chest burned in front of the great fire. Perhaps, all the same, he would do well to address the pit: the old man might not know; then, he resigned himself, he would accept any task. Where to go and what to become, through this country starved by unemployment? leave the carcass of a lost dog behind a wall? However, a hesitation disturbed him, a fear of the Voreux, in the middle of this flat plain, drowned under such a thick night. With each squall, the wind seemed to grow, as if blowing from an ever-widening horizon. No dawn whitened in the dead sky, only the blast furnaces blazed, like the coke ovens, bloodying the darkness, without illuminating the unknown. And the Voreux, at the bottom of his hole, with his squatting of a nasty beast, was crushing more, breathing with a thicker and longer breath, the air embarrassed by his painful digestion of human flesh.","Étienne picked up his bundle but lingered a while longer. He could feel the icy blasts of wind on his back while his chest roasted in the heat from the fire. Perhaps he should try at the pit all the same, the old man might be mistaken; and anyway he was past caring now , he’d take whatever they gave him. Where else could he go, what else could he do, when so many people round about were starving and out of work? Was he to end up like a stray dog, a dead carcass lying behind some wall or other? And yet something made him hesitate, a fear of Le Voreux itself, out here in the middle of this open plain that lay buried in thick darkness. With each gust the force of the wind seemed to increase, as if it were blowing in from an ever-widening horizon. No dawn paled the dead sky; there was only the blaze of the tall blast-furnaces and the coke-ovens, turning the darkness blood red but shining no light into the unknown. And Le Voreux, crouching like some evil beast at the bottom of its lair, seemed to hunker down even further, puffing and panting in increasingly slow, deep bursts, as if it were struggling to digest its meal of human flesh.","When he had picked up his bundle, Étienne still remained at the same spot. He felt the gusts freezing his back, while his chest was burning before the large fire. Perhaps, all the same, it would be as well to inquire at the pit, the old man might not know. Then he resigned himself; he would accept any work. Where should he go, and what was to become of him in this country famished for lack of work? Must he leave his carcass behind a wall, like a strayed dog? But one doubt troubled him, a fear of the Voreux in the middle of this flat plain, drowned in so thick a night. At every gust the wind seemed to rise as if it blew from an ever-broadening horizon. No dawn whitened the dead sky. The blast furnaces alone flamed, and the coke ovens, making the darkness redder without illuminating the unknown. And the Voreux, at the bottom of its hole, with its posture as of an evil beast, continued to crunch, breathing with a heavier and slower respiration, troubled by its painful digestion of human flesh."
"– Nullement. L’Internationale accorde du temps aux ouvriers en grève. Nous paierons plus tard, et c’est elle qui, tout de suite, viendra à notre secours.","– Not at all.

"Elle repartit, poussant une berline vide. Le pis était que, dans cette voie de fond, une autre cause se joignait au voisinage du Tartaret, pour rendre la chaleur insoutenable. On côtoyait d’anciens travaux, une galerie abandonnée de Gaston-Marie, très profonde, où un coup de grisou, dix ans plus tôt, avait incendié la veine, qui brûlait toujours, derrière le « corroi », le mur d’argile bâti là et réparé continuellement, afin de limiter le désastre. Privé d’air, le feu aurait dû s’éteindre ; mais sans doute des courants inconnus l’avivaient, il s’entretenait depuis dix années, il chauffait l’argile du corroi comme on chauffe les briques d’un four, au point qu’on en recevait au passage la cuisson. Et c’était le long de ce muraillement, sur une longueur de plus de cent mètres, que se faisait le roulage, dans une température de soixante degrés.","She drove off, pushing an empty sedan. The worst was that, in this bottom line, another cause joined in the neighborhood of Tartaret, to make the heat unbearable. We walked past old works, an abandoned gallery of Gaston-Marie, very deep, where a firedamp explosion, ten years earlier, had set fire to the seam, which was still burning, behind the ""corroi"", the clay wall built there and continually repaired, in order to limit the disaster. Deprived of air, the fire should have died out; but no doubt unknown currents enlivened it, it had been going on for ten years, it heated the clay of the corroi as one heats the bricks of an oven, to the point that one received the firing from it in passing. And it was along this wall, over a length of more than a hundred meters, that the rolling took place, in a temperature of sixty degrees.","And off she went, pushing her empty tub. The worst of it was that down in this remote part of the mine the proximity of Le Tartaret was not the only cause of the unbearable heat. The road ran parallel with some old workings, deep in Gaston-Marie, next to an abandoned roadway where a firedamp explosion ten years earlier had set fire to the seam; and the fire was still raging behind the break, a wall of clay which had been built alongside it and which was kept in constant repair in order to contain the disaster. Starved of oxygen the fire ought to have gone out; but draughts from unknown sources must have continued to feed it, and so it was still burning ten years later, warming the clay in the break like the bricks in a kiln, with the result that the heat could be felt through it along the whole length of the wall. And it was beside this break, over a distance of a hundred metres, that the tubs had to be rolled, in a temperature of sixty degrees.","She went off again, pushing an empty tram. The worst was that in this bottom passage another cause joined with the neighbourhood of Tartaret to make the heat unbearable. They were by the side of old workings, a very deep abandoned gallery of Gaston-Marie, where, ten years earlier, an explosion of fire-damp had set the seam alight; and it was still burning behind the clay wall which had been built there and was kept constantly repaired, in order to limit the disaster. Deprived of air, the fire ought to have become extinct, but no doubt unknown currents kept it alive; it had gone on for ten years, and heated the clay wall like the bricks of an oven, so that those who passed felt half-roasted. It was along this wall, for a length of more than a hundred metres, that the haulage was carried on, in a temperature of sixty degrees."
"– Maintenant, reprit-il d’une voix lente, ce n’est pas avec trente sous que je pourrai lui faire des cadeaux… Elle va crever de misère, c’est sûr.","“Now,” he went on in a slow voice, “I won't be able to give her presents with thirty sous. She's going to die of misery, that's for sure.","‘But now,’ he went on slowly, ‘there’ll be nothing left to give her out of thirty sous…She’ll die of poverty, for sure.’","""Now,"" he began again, in a slow voice, ""I haven't even thirty sous to make her presents with. She will die of misery, sure enough."""
"Cet aveu, arraché à sa franchise, souleva une discussion. Les dames ne s’amusaient guère. Chacun, du reste, s’occupait de son assiette, dans le feu du premier appétit. Comme le domestique rentrait, il sembla vouloir parler, puis il hésita.","This confession, torn from his frankness, gave rise to a discussion. The ladies were not having fun. Everyone, moreover, took care of his plate, in the fire of the first appetite.

"Mais il y eut dans la foule une longue secousse, et une vieille femme déboula.

"Mais on n’eut pas le temps de remarquer cette émotion, la porte s’était brutalement ouverte, et Chaval avait paru, poussant devant lui Catherine.

Having got drunk on beer and brave talk in every bar in Montsou, it had suddenly occurred to him to visit the Advantage and show his former friends that he wasn’t afraid of anybody. As he entered, he was saying to Catherine:","But no one had time to notice this emotion, for the door had opened roughly and Chaval had appeared, pushing Catherine before him. After having made himself drunk with beer and bluster in all the public-houses of Montsou, the idea had occurred to him to go to the Avantage to show his old friends that he was not afraid. As he came in, he said to his mistress:"
"Justement, lorsque Étienne arriva, un camarade qui buvait une chope, au retour de Montsou, racontait qu’une affiche était collée chez le caissier ; mais il ne savait pas bien ce qu’on lisait sur cette affiche. Un second entra, puis un troisième ; et chacun apportait une histoire différente. Il semblait certain, cependant, que la Compagnie avait pris une résolution.","As it happened, when Étienne arrived, a comrade who was drinking a beer on his return from Montsou was saying that a notice had been stuck up at the cashier's; but he did not quite know what one read on this poster. A second entered, then a third; and each brought a different story. It seemed certain, however, that the Company had come to a resolution.","In fact, just as Étienne arrived, a workmate who had come in for a beer on his way back from Montsou was busy telling everybody about how there was a notice up in the cashier’s office; but he didn’t rightly know what it said. Another man appeared, then a third; and each one had a different story. What was clear, however, was that the Company had come to some sort of a decision.","Just as Étienne arrived, a comrade, who was drinking a glass on his return from Montsou, was telling that an announcement had been stuck up at the cashier's; but he did not quite know what was on the announcement. A second entered, then a third, and each brought a different story. It seemed certain, however, that the Company had taken a resolution."

"Des rires énormes grondèrent, les herscheuses de toute la veine se tenaient le ventre.","Huge laughs rumbled, putters from all veins clutched their bellies.","Loud rumbles of mirth could be heard, and every putter in the seam was in fits of laughter:","There was a roar of laughter, and the putters of the whole seam held their sides."
"En effet, il avait donné rendez-vous à Bébert et à Lydie, dans une cachette, un trou ménagé sous la provision des bois, au Voreux. C’était toute une grosse partie, de découcher, pour en être, si l’on cassait les os des Belges à coups de pierres, quand ils descendraient.","In fact, he had arranged to meet Bébert and Lydie in a hiding place, a hole made under the supply of wood, at the Voreux. It was quite a big game, to sleep, to be there, if the bones of the Belgians were broken with stones, when they came down.","He had indeed arranged to meet Bébert and Lydie, at a secret hidingplace they’d made for themselves under the timberstack at Le Voreux. It was all to be a big adventure, sleeping away from home so as to be part of the action if people started stoning the living daylights out of the Belgians when they tried to go down the pit.","In fact, he had given a rendezvous to Bébert and Lydie in a hiding-place, a hole arranged under the wood supply at the Voreux. It had been arranged to sleep out, so as to be there if the Belgians' bones were to be broken by stoning when they went down the pit."
"Et, à la volée, il donna un premier coup de hache dans la porte de la boutique. Des camarades l’avaient suivi, Levaque, Maheu et quelques autres. Mais les femmes s’acharnaient. Cécile était retombée des doigts de Bonnemort dans les mains de la Brûlé. À quatre pattes, Lydie et Bébert, conduits par Jeanlin, se glissaient entre les jupes, pour voir le derrière de la dame. Déjà, on la tiraillait, ses vêtements craquaient, lorsqu’un homme à cheval parut, poussant sa bête, cravachant ceux qui ne se rangeaient pas assez vite.","And, on the fly, he gave the first blow of the ax in the door of the shop. Comrades had followed him, Levaque, Maheu and a few others. But the women persisted. Cecile had fallen from Bonnemort's fingers into Madame Brûlé's hands. On all fours, Lydie and Bébert, led by Jeanlin, slipped between the skirts to see the lady's behind. Already she was being tugged at, her clothes creaking, when a man on horseback appeared, pushing his horse, whipping those who did not line up quickly enough.","Whereupon he hit the door of the shop with a random swing of his axe. Some comrades followed his lead, Levaque, Maheu and a few others. But the women were not to be denied. Cécile had escaped the clutches of Bonnemort only to fall into the hands of La Brûlé. Led by Jeanlin, Lydie and Bébert were down on all fours crawling between the skirts to get a glimpse of the young lady’s bottom. Cécile was being tugged this way and that and already her clothes were beginning to split when a man on horseback appeared, urging his mount on and using his whip on anyone who was slow to get out of his way.","And at random he gave the first blow of the axe against the shop door. Some comrades had followed him--Levaque, Maheu, and a few others. But the women were furious, and Cécile had fallen from Bonnemort's fingers into Mother Brulé's hands. Lydie and Bébert, led by Jeanlin, had slipped on all fours between her petticoats to see the lady's bottom. Already the women were pulling her about; her clothes were beginning to split, when a man on horseback appeared, pushing on his animal, and using his riding-whip on those who would not stand back quick enough."
"Elle ne parut pas l’entendre, elle se plaignait maintenant, d’une plainte basse et continue.","She did not seem to hear him, she was complaining now, a low and continuous complaint.","She appeared not to hear him and poured out her sorrow in a low, continuous lament.","She did not seem to hear him, and was bemoaning herself now in a low continuous complaint."
"Et Catherine l’emmena, à l’instant où un lourd galop ébranlait au loin le pavé. Tout de suite, un cri éclata : « Les gendarmes ! les gendarmes ! » Ce fut une débâcle, un sauve-qui-peut si éperdu, qu’en deux minutes la route se trouva libre, absolument nette, comme balayée par un ouragan. Le cadavre de Maigrat faisait seul une tache d’ombre sur la terre blanche. Devant l’estaminet Tison, il n’était resté que Rasseneur, qui, soulagé, la face ouverte, applaudissait à la facile victoire des sabres ; tandis que, dans Montsou désert, éteint, dans le silence des façades closes, les bourgeois, la sueur à la peau, n’osant risquer un œil, claquaient des dents. La plaine se noyait sous l’épaisse nuit, il n’y avait plus que les hauts fourneaux et les fours à coke incendiés au fond du ciel tragique. Pesamment, le galop des gendarmes approchait, ils débouchèrent sans qu’on les distinguât, en une masse sombre. Et, derrière eux, confiée à leur garde, la voiture du pâtissier de Marchiennes arrivait enfin, une carriole d’où sauta un marmiton, qui se mit d’un air tranquille à déballer les croûtes des vol-au-vent.","And Catherine took him away, just as a heavy gallop shook the pavement in the distance. Immediately, a cry broke out: “The gendarmes! the cops! It was a debacle, such a frantic scramble that in two minutes the road was free, absolutely clear, as if swept away by a hurricane. Maigrat's corpse alone cast a shadow on the white earth. In front of the Tison estaminet, only Rasseneur remained, who, relieved, his face open, applauded the easy victory of the sabers; while, in Montsou deserted, extinguished, in the silence of the closed facades, the bourgeois, sweat on their skin, not daring to risk an eye, chattered their teeth. The plain was drowning under the thick night, there were only the blast furnaces and the burnt coke ovens at the bottom of the tragic sky. Heavy, the gallop of the gendarmes approached, they emerged without being distinguished, in a dark mass. And, behind them, entrusted to their guard, the carriage of the Marchiennes pastry cook finally arrived, a cart from which jumped a kitchen boy, who calmly began to unwrap the crusts of the vol-au-vent.","And Catherine led him away just as they began to hear the heavy clatter of hooves in the distance, approaching along the cobbled road. At once the cry went up: ‘The gendarmes! The gendarmes!’ There was chaos as everyone made a run for it, such a wild flight that within a couple of minutes the road was clear, absolutely empty, as though it had been swept by a hurricane. All that was left was the dark patch of shadow made by Maigrat’s corpse where it lay on the white ground. Outside Tison’s only Rasseneur remained, with a look of open relief on his face, applauding the easy victory of the men with sabres; and as Montsou lay silent and deserted, with not a light to be seen, the bourgeois sweated behind closed shutters, not daring to look out, teeth chattering. The plain had now merged with the pitch darkness, and all that could be seen were the blast-furnaces and the coke-ovens, blazing away against the backdrop of a doom-laden sky. The sound of thundering hooves drew closer, and suddenly the gendarmes were there in the street, visible only as one dark, solid mass. Following behind, under their protection, the pastryman’s cart arrived from Marchiennes at last: and a delivery-boy jumped down and calmly proceeded to unload the vol-au-vent cases.","And Catherine drew him away, while, at the same instant, a heavy gallop shook the street from afar. Immediately a voice arose: "" The gendarmes! the gendarmes!"" There was a general breaking up, so mad a rush for life that in two minutes the road was free, absolutely clear, as though swept by a hurricane. Maigrat's corpse alone made a patch of shadow on the white earth. Before the Estaminet Tison, Rasseneur only remained, feeling relieved, and with open face applauding the easy victory of the sabres; while in dim and deserted Montsou, in the silence of the closed houses, the bourgeois remained with perspiring skins and chattering teeth, not daring to look out. The plain was drowned beneath the thick night, only the blast furnaces and the coke furnaces were burning against the tragic sky. The gallop of the gendarmes heavily approached; they came up in an indistinguishable sombre mass. And behind them the Marchiennes pastrycook's vehicle, a little covered cart which had been confided to their care, at last arrived, and a small drudge of a boy jumped down and quietly unpacked the crusts for the vol-au-vent. * * *"
"Cette mutilation affreuse s’était accomplie dans une horreur glacée. Ni Étienne, ni Maheu, ni les autres n’avaient eu le temps d’intervenir : ils restaient immobiles, devant ce galop de furies. Sur la porte de l’estaminet Tison, des têtes se montraient, Rasseneur blême de révolte, et Zacharie, et Philomène, stupéfiés d’avoir vu. Les deux vieux, Bonnemort et Mouque, très graves, hochaient la tête. Seul, Jeanlin rigolait, poussait du coude Bébert, forçait Lydie à lever le nez. Mais les femmes revenaient déjà, tournant sur elles-mêmes, passant sous les fenêtres de la Direction. Et, derrière les persiennes, ces dames et ces demoiselles allongeaient le cou.

Neither Etienne, nor Maheu, nor the others had had time to intervene: they remained motionless before this gallop of furies. On the door of the Tison estaminet, faces appeared, Rasseneur pale with revolt, and Zacharie, and Philomène, stupefied at having seen. The two old men, Bonnemort and Mouque, very serious, shook their heads. Alone, Jeanlin was laughing, nudging Bébert with his elbow, forcing Lydie to look up. But the women were already returning, turning on their own, passing under the windows of the Direction. And, behind the shutters, these ladies and young ladies stretched their necks. They hadn't been able to see the scene, hidden by the wall, they couldn't see clearly, in the darkened night.","This dreadful act of mutilation had been witnessed with frozen horror. Neither Étienne nor Maheu nor any of the others had had time to intervene: and now they remained where they were as the furies raced off into the distance. Faces began to appear at the doorway of Tison’s bar, Rasseneur, ashen with revulsion, and Zacharie and Philomène, both dumbstruck at what they had seen. The two old men, Bonnemort and Mouque, looked very grave and shook their heads. The only one sniggering was Jeanlin, who was elbowing Bébert in the ribs and trying to make Lydie look up. But the gaggle of women was already returning, doubling back on itself and now passing beneath the windows of the manager’s house. And there, behind the shutters, the fine ladies craned their necks to see. They had not been able to observe what had happened, which had been hidden from their view by the wall, and now that it was completely dark they could not make things out properly.","This frightful mutilation was accomplished in frozen horror.

At the door of the Estaminet Tison a few heads were grouped--Rasseneur pale with disgust, Zacharie and Philoméne stupefied at what they had seen. The two old men, Bonnemort and Mouqe, were gravely shaking their heads. Only Jeanlin was making fun, pushing Bébert with his elbow, and forcing Lydie to look up. But the women were already coming back, turning round and passing beneath the manager's windows. Behind the blinds the ladies were stretching out their necks. They had not been able to observe the scene, which was hidden from them by the wall, and they could not distinguish well in the growing darkness."

"Déjà, la Mouquette le déculottait, tirait le pantalon, tandis que la Levaque soulevait les jambes. Et la Brûlé, de ses mains sèches de vieille, écarta les cuisses nues, empoigna cette virilité morte. Elle tenait tout, arrachant, dans un effort qui tendait sa maigre échine et faisait craquer ses grands bras. Les peaux molles résistaient, elle dut s’y reprendre, elle finit par emporter le lambeau, un paquet de chair velue et sanglante, qu’elle agita, avec un rire de triomphe :","Already, Mouquette was taking his pants off, pulling up his trousers, while La Levaque was lifting his legs. And La Brûlé, with her dry old hands, parted her bare thighs, grabbed this dead manhood. She held everything, snatching, in an effort that tensed her thin spine and made her great arms crack. The soft skin resisted, she had to try again, she ended up taking away the shred, a bundle of hairy and bloody flesh, which she waved, with a triumphant laugh:","Already La Mouquette was busy pulling his trousers off as La Levaque lifted his legs. And then, with her old, wizened hands, La Brûlé parted his naked thighs and seized hold of his now defunct manhood. She grabbed the whole thing in one hand and pulled, her bony spine tense with the effort, her long arms cracking. When the flabby skin refused to give, she had to pull even harder, but finally it came away in her hand, a lump of hairy, bleeding flesh which she proceeded to brandish in triumph:","Mouquette was already unfastening and drawing off the trousers, while the Levaque woman raised the legs.

The soft skin resisted; she had to try again, and at last carried away the fragment, a lump of hairy and bleeding flesh, which she brandished with a laugh of triumph."
"Mais, Catherine s’étant approchée, il la reconnut, elle aussi. Étienne protestait, déclarait qu’il ne laissait à personne le soin de juger sa conduite. Et les yeux du machineur allèrent de la jeune fille au camarade ; tandis qu’il reculait d’un pas, avec un geste de brusque abandon. Quand il y avait une femme dans le cœur d’un homme, l’homme était fini, il pouvait mourir.

Il dit simplement :","But when Catherine approached, he recognized her too. Étienne protested, declaring that he left no one to judge his conduct.

He simply says:","But just then Catherine stepped forward, and he recognized her too. Étienne was busy protesting that it was nobody’s place but his own to judge his conduct. Souvarine looked from the girl to the comrade, and then stepped back and gestured in sudden resignation. Once a woman had got under a man’s skin, he was done for, he might as well die. Perhaps Souvarine had a sudden memory of his mistress, back there in Moscow, the mistress who had been hanged, severing the last tie that bound his flesh and setting him free to dispose of the lives of others and of his own. He said simply: ‘On you go.’","But Catherine having approached, he recognized her also. Étienne protested, declaring that he allowed no one to judge his conduct.

"Justement, Paul Négrel débarquait à Montsou. Sa mère, veuve d’un capitaine provençal, vivant à Avignon d’une maigre rente, avait dû se contenter de pain et d’eau pour le pousser jusqu’à l’École polytechnique. Il en était sorti dans un mauvais rang, et son oncle, M. Hennebeau, venait de lui faire donner sa démission, en offrant de le prendre comme ingénieur, au Voreux. Dès lors, traité en enfant de la maison, il y eut même sa chambre, y mangea, y vécut, ce qui lui permettait d’envoyer à sa mère la moitié de ses appointements de trois mille francs. Pour déguiser ce bienfait, M. Hennebeau parlait de l’embarras où était un jeune homme, obligé de se monter un ménage, dans un des petits chalets réservés aux ingénieurs des fosses. Mme Hennebeau, tout de suite, avait pris un rôle de bonne tante, tutoyant son neveu, veillant à son bien-être. Les premiers mois surtout, elle montra une maternité débordante de conseils, aux moindres sujets. Mais elle restait femme pourtant, elle glissait à des confidences personnelles. Ce garçon si jeune et si pratique, d’une intelligence sans scrupule, professant sur l’amour des théories de philosophe, l’amusait, grâce à la vivacité de son pessimisme, dont s’aiguisait sa face mince, au nez pointu. Naturellement, un soir, il se trouva dans ses bras ; et elle parut se livrer par bonté, tout en lui disant qu’elle n’avait plus de cœur et qu’elle voulait être uniquement son amie. En effet, elle ne fut pas jalouse, elle le plaisantait sur les herscheuses qu’il déclarait abominables, le boudait presque, parce qu’il n’avait pas des farces de jeune homme à lui conter. Puis, l’idée de le marier la passionna, elle rêva de se dévouer, de le donner elle-même à une fille riche. Leurs rapports continuaient, un joujou de récréation, où elle mettait ses tendresses dernières de femme oisive et finie.","Precisely, Paul Négrel landed in Montsou. His mother, widow of a Provençal captain, living in Avignon on a meager income, had to be content with bread and water to push him to the École Polytechnique. He had come out of it in a poor rank, and his uncle, M. Hennebeau, had just forced him to resign, offering to take him on as an engineer at the Voreux. From then on, treated as a child of the house, he even had his own room there, ate there, lived there, which enabled him to send his mother half of his salary of three thousand francs. To disguise this benefit, M. Hennebeau spoke of the embarrassment in which a young man was, obliged to set up a household in one of the little chalets reserved for the engineers of the pits. Mme Hennebeau had immediately taken on the role of good aunt, familiarizing herself with her nephew, watching over his well-being. The first months especially, she showed a motherhood overflowing with advice, on the smallest subjects. But she remained a woman nevertheless, she slipped into personal confidences. This boy, so young and so practical, of an unscrupulous intelligence, professing philosophical theories on love, amused him, thanks to the vivacity of his pessimism, which sharpened his thin face, with its pointed nose. Naturally, one evening he found himself in her arms; and she seemed to give herself up out of kindness, while telling him that she had no more heart and that she wanted to be his friend only. In fact, she was not jealous, she joked to him about the putters whom he declared abominable, almost sulked at him, because he had no young man's jokes to tell her. Then, the idea of marrying him fascinated her, she dreamed of devoting herself, of giving him herself to a rich girl. Their relationship continued, a plaything of recreation, in which she displayed her last affections of an idle and exhausted woman.","At this precise moment Paul Négrel turned up in Montsou. His mother, the widow of a Provençal captain, lived on a meagre income in Avignon and had gone without in order to get him into the École Polytechnique.4 He had graduated with a low rank, and M. Hennebeau, his uncle, had recently told him to resign and offered him a job as engineer at Le Voreux. Since then he had been treated as one of the family; he had his own room, and he ate and lived there, which enabled him to send his mother half his salary of three thousand francs. In order to disguise this largesse, M. Hennebeau talked about how difficult life was for a young man who had to set up house in one of the little wooden houses reserved for the mine’s engineers. Mme Hennebeau had immediately adopted the role of kindly aunt, calling him by his first name and making sure he had everything he wanted. During the first few months especially she was full of motherly advice about the merest trifle. But she was still a woman, and she began to share more intimate confidences with him. She found the boy amusing, so youthful and pragmatic, with an intelligence unfettered by scruple and a penchant for professing philosophical theories about love; and she liked the urgency of his pessimism, which seemed to make his thin face and pointed nose look more angular still. One evening, naturally, he ended up in her arms; and she seemed to yield out of kindness, telling him that she was dead to love and simply wanted to be his friend. And indeed she was not possessive: she teased him about the putters he claimed to find repellent, and almost sulked when he had no young man ’s escapades to tell her about. Then she became obsessed with the idea of seeing him married, and dreamed of being the trusty go-between who would herself unite him with some wealthy girl. They continued to have relations, by way of amusing recreation, and she lavished on these the residual affectionateness of an idle and superannuated woman.","Just then Paul Négrel arrived at Montsou. His mother, the widow of a Provencal captain, living at Avignon on a slender income, had had to content herself with bread and water to enable him to reach the École Polytechnique. He had come out low in rank, and his uncle, M. Hennebeau, had enabled him to leave by offering to take him as engineer at the Voreux. From that time he was treated as one of the family; he even had his room there, his meals there, lived there, and was thus enabled to send to his mother half his salary of three thousand francs. To disguise this kindness M. Hennebeau spoke of the embarrassment to a young man of setting up a household in one of those little villas reserved for the mine engineers, Madame Hennebeau had at once taken the part of a good aunt, treating her nephew with familiarity and watching over his comfort. During the first months, especially, she exhibited an overwhelming maternity with her advice regarding the smallest subjects. But she remained a woman, however, and slid into personal confidences.

In fact, she was not jealous; she joked him about the putters, whom he declared to be abominable, and she almost sulked because he had no young man's pranks to narrate to her. Then she was carried away by the idea of getting him married; she dreamed of sacrificing herself and of finding a rich girl for him. Their relations continued a plaything, a recreation, in which she felt the last tenderness of a lazy woman who had done with the world."
"Lorsqu’il se fut relevé, Maheu passa simplement une culotte sèche. Son plaisir, quand il était propre et qu’il avait rigolé avec sa femme, était de rester un moment le torse nu. Sur sa peau blanche, d’une blancheur de fille anémique, les éraflures, les entailles du charbon, laissaient des tatouages, des « greffes », comme disent les mineurs ; et il s’en montrait fier, il étalait ses gros bras, sa poitrine large, d’un luisant de marbre veiné de bleu. En été, tous les mineurs se mettaient ainsi sur les portes. Il y alla même un instant, malgré le temps humide, cria un mot salé à un camarade, le poitrail également nu, au-delà des jardins. D’autres parurent. Et les enfants, qui traînaient sur les trottoirs, levaient la tête, riaient eux aussi à la joie de toute cette chair lasse de travailleurs, mise au grand air.","When he got up, Maheu simply put on some dry breeches. His pleasure, when he was clean and had laughed with his wife, was to stay shirtless for a while. On her white skin, the whiteness of an anemic girl, the scratches, the notches of the coal, left tattoos, ""grafts"", as the miners say; and he showed himself proud of it, he displayed his big arms, his broad chest, glistening with blue-veined marble. In summer, all the miners went to the doors like this. He even went there for a moment, despite the damp weather, shouted a salty word to a comrade, his chest also bare, beyond the gardens. Others appeared.

In summer all the miners sat out on their doorsteps like this. Even now, despite the damp weather, he went out for a moment and shouted some ribald remark to a similarly bare-chested comrade on the other side of the gardens. Other men came out also.

"Les soirs de ducasse, on terminait la fête au bal du Bon-Joyeux. C’était la veuve Désir qui tenait ce bal, une forte mère de cinquante ans, d’une rotondité de tonneau, mais d’une telle verdeur, qu’elle avait encore six amoureux, un pour chaque jour de la semaine, disait-elle, et les six à la fois le dimanche. Elle appelait tous les charbonniers ses enfants, attendrie à l’idée du fleuve de bière qu’elle leur versait depuis trente années ; et elle se vantait aussi que pas une herscheuse ne devenait grosse, sans s’être, à l’avance, dégourdi les jambes chez elle. Le Bon-Joyeux se composait de deux salles : le cabaret, où se trouvaient le comptoir et des tables ; puis, communiquant de plain-pied par une large baie, le bal, vaste pièce planchéiée au milieu seulement, dallée de briques autour. Une décoration l’ornait, deux guirlandes de fleurs en papier qui se croisaient d’un angle à l’autre du plafond, et que réunissait, au centre, une couronne des mêmes fleurs ; tandis que, le long des murs, saignaient des écussons dorés, portant des noms de saints, saint Éloi, patron des ouvriers du fer, saint Crépin, patron des cordonniers, sainte Barbe, patronne des mineurs, tout le calendrier des corporations. Le plafond était si bas, que les trois musiciens, dans leur tribune, grande comme une chaire à prêcher, s’écrasaient la tête. Pour éclairer, le soir, on accrochait quatre lampes à pétrole, aux quatre coins du bal.","On ducasse evenings, the party ended at the Bon-Joyeux ball. It was the Widow Désir who kept this ball, a strong mother of fifty, of the roundness of a barrel, but of such vigor, that she still had six lovers, one for each day of the week, said- her, and the six at the same time on Sundays. She called all the charcoal burners her children, moved by the idea of the river of beer she had poured out for them for thirty years; and she also boasted that not a putter ever got fat without first stretching her legs at home. The Bon-Joyeux consisted of two rooms: the cabaret, where the counter and tables were; then, communicating on the same level by a wide bay, the ballroom, a vast room with a plank floor only in the middle, paved with bricks all around. A decoration adorned it, two garlands of paper flowers crossing each other from one angle of the ceiling to the other, and united in the center by a wreath of the same flowers; while along the walls ran gilded escutcheons, bearing the names of saints, Saint Eloi, patron saint of ironworkers, Saint Crépin, patron saint of shoemakers, Saint Barbara, patron saint of miners, the whole calendar of corporations. The ceiling was so low that the three musicians, in their gallery, as big as a pulpit, crushed their heads. For lighting, in the evening, four kerosene lamps were hung at the four corners of the ball.","Come the evening on ducasse days, everyone would end up at the Jolly Fellow. This dance-hall was run by Widow Desire, a stout matron of fifty who was as round as a barrel but still so full of energy that she had six lovers, one for each day of the week, she used to say, and all six at once on Sundays. She referred to the miners as her children in fond remembrance of the river of beer she had poured down them over the past thirty years; and she also liked to boast that no putter ever got pregnant without having first had a spot of slap and tickle at the Jolly Fellow. The place consisted of two rooms: the bar itself, where the counter and tables were, and then, on the same level but through a broad archway, the dance-hall. This was a huge room, with an area of wooden floor-boards in the middle surrounded by brick. The only decoration was provided by garlands of paper flowers strung from opposite corners of the ceiling and joined together in the middle by a wreath of matching flowers. Round the walls ran a line of gilt shields bearing the names of saints, like St Éloi, the patron saint of ironworkers, St Crispin, the patron saint of cobblers, St Barbe, the patron saint of miners, in fact the whole calendar of saints celebrated by tradesmen’s guilds. The ceiling was so low that the three musicians sitting on the stage, itself no bigger than a pulpit, banged their heads on it. To light the room in the evenings four paraffin lamps were hung, one in each corner.","On the evenings of feast-days the fair was terminated in the ball-room of the Bon-Joyeux. It was a widow, Madame Désir, who kept this ball-room, a fat matron of fifty, as round as a tub, but so fresh that she still had six lovers, one for every day of the week, she said, and the six together for Sunday. She called all the miners her children; and grew tender at the thought of the flood of beer which she had poured out for them during the last thirty years; and she boasted also that a putter never became pregnant without having first stretched her legs at her establishment. There were two rooms in the BonJoyeux: the bar which contained the counter and tables; then, communicating with it on the same floor by a large arch, was the ball-room, a large hall only planked in the middle, being paved with bricks round the sides.

"Et, sous ses pieds, les coups profonds, les coups obstinés des rivelaines continuaient. Les camarades étaient tous là, il les entendait le suivre à chaque enjambée.

Maintenant, en plein ciel, le soleil d’avril rayonnait dans sa gloire, échauffant la terre qui enfantait. Du flanc nourricier jaillissait la vie, les bourgeons crevaient en feuilles vertes, les champs tressaillaient de la poussée des herbes. De toutes parts, des graines se gonflaient, s’allongeaient, gerçaient la plaine, travaillées d’un besoin de chaleur et de lumière. Un débordement de sève coulait avec des voix chuchotantes, le bruit des germes s’épandait en un grand baiser. Encore, encore, de plus en plus distinctement, comme s’ils se fussent rapprochés du sol, les camarades tapaient. Aux rayons enflammés de l’astre, par cette matinée de jeunesse, c’était de cette rumeur que la campagne était grosse. Des hommes poussaient, une armée noire, vengeresse, qui germait lentement dans les sillons, grandissant pour les récoltes du siècle futur, et dont la germination allait faire bientôt éclater la terre.","And, under his feet, the deep blows, the obstinate blows of the rivelaines continued. The comrades were all there, he heard them following him with every stride. Wasn't it Maheude, under that piece of beetroot, her spine broken, whose breath rose so hoarsely, accompanied by the hum of the fans. Left, right, further on, he thought he recognized others, under the wheat, the quickset hedges, the young trees. Now, in the sky, the April sun shone in its glory, warming the earth that was giving birth. Life sprang from the nourishing side, the buds burst into green leaves, the fields quivered with the growth of the grass. On all sides, seeds swelled, lengthened, cracked the plain, tormented by a need for heat and light. An overflow of sap flowed with whispering voices, the sound of germs spread in a great kiss. Again, again, more and more distinctly, as if closer to the ground, the comrades tapped. In the fiery rays of the star, on this morning of youth, it was this rumor that the campaign was pregnant with. Men sprang up, a black, vengeful army, slowly germinating in the furrows, growing for the harvests of the coming age, and whose germination would soon split the earth.","And far beneath his feet the stubborn tap-tap of the picks continued. The comrades were all there, he could hear them following him with each stride he took. Wasn’t that La Maheude beneath this field of beet, bent double at her work, her rasping breaths audible above the roar of her ventilating machine? On the left, on the right, ahead of him, he thought he recognized others, there beneath the corn and the hedges and the young trees. The risen April sun now shone from the sky in all its glory, warming the parturient earth. Life was springing from her fertile bosom, with buds bursting into verdant leaf and the fields a-quiver with the thrust of new grass. Seeds were swelling and stretching, cracking the plain open in their quest for warmth and light. Sap was brimming in an urgent whisper, shoots were sprouting with the sound of a kiss. And still, again and again, even more distinctly than before, as if they had been working their way closer to the surface, the comrades tapped and tapped. Beneath the blazing rays of the sun, on this morning when the world seemed young, such was the stirring which the land carried in its womb. New men were starting into life, a black army of vengeance slowly germinating in the furrows, growing for the harvests of the century to come; and soon this germination would tear the earth apart.","And beneath his feet, the deep blows, those obstinate blows of the pick, continued. The mates were all there; he heard them following him at every stride. Was not that Maheude beneath the beetroots. with bent back and hoarse respiration accompanying the rumble of the ventilator?

Now the April sun, in the open sky, was shining in his glory, and warming the pregnant earth. From its fertile flanks life was leaping out, buds were bursting into green leaves, and the fields were quivering with the growth of the grass.

An overflow of sap was mixed with whispering voices, the sound of the germs expanding in a great kiss.

Almost half of the mining companies in France go bankrupt… Besides, it is stupid to accuse those who succeed of cruelty. When their workers suffer, they themselves suffer.

Almost half the mining companies in France have gone bankrupt… Anyway, it’s stupid accusing the successful ones of being cruel. While their workers are feeling the pain, so are they.

The loaders were still packing sedans, with a deafening noise of rattling scrap metal, and the cages were flying away, disappearing in the pouring rain that fell from the black hole. Below, the bougnou, a ten-meter cesspool, filled with this runoff, also exhaled its muddy humidity. Men circled incessantly around the well, pulling the signal cords, pressing on the arms of the levers, in the midst of this water dust with which their clothes were soaked.

The onsetters were still loading tubs into the cages, with a deafening noise of clanking metal, and the cages would vanish up into the driving rain falling from the black hole. Down below, the bougnou – a sump ten metres deep where all the water gathered – gave off its own slimy dampness. Men were milling about constantly in the vicinity of the shaft, pulling signal-ropes, pressing levers, their clothes drenched by the spray.

The others were there, covered with sweat in the icy current, silent like himself, swallowing their grunts of rage. They had arrived too soon and could not be taken to the top for half an hour, more especially since some complicated manoeuvres were going on for lowering a horse. The porters were still rolling the trams with the deafening sound of old iron in movement, and the cages were flying up, disappearing in the rain which fell from the black hole. Below, the sump, a cesspool ten metres deep, filled with this streaming water, also exhaled its muddy moisture. Men were constantly moving around the shaft, pulling the signal cords, pressing on the arms of levers, in the midst of this spray in which their garments were soaked. The reddish light of three open lamps cut out great moving shadows and gave to this subterranean hall the air of a villainous cavern, some bandits' forge near a torrent."
"– Ouf ! nous y voilà, dit la Maheude chargée de paquets, en poussant chez eux Lénore et Henri, boueux, les jambes mortes.","– Phew! here we are, said Maheude laden with parcels, pushing Lénore and Henri home, muddy, with dead legs.","‘Oof.

"Étienne, se calmant, prit une chaise et s’accouda de l’autre côté de la table. Cette face blonde, dont les yeux rêveurs s’ensauvageaient parfois d’une clarté rouge, l’inquiétait, exerçait sur sa volonté une action singulière.

"Quatre heures sonnèrent au coucou de la salle du rez-de-chaussée, rien encore ne remua, des haleines grêles sifflaient, accompagnées de deux ronflements sonores. Et, brusquement, ce fut Catherine qui se leva. Dans sa fatigue, elle avait, par habitude, compté les quatre coups du timbre, à travers le plancher, sans trouver la force de s’éveiller complètement. Puis, les jambes jetées hors des couvertures, elle tâtonna, frotta enfin une allumette et alluma la chandelle. Mais elle restait assise, la tête si pesante, qu’elle se renversait entre les deux épaules, cédant au besoin invincible de retomber sur le traversin.","Four o'clock struck from the cuckoo clock in the room on the ground floor, nothing stirred yet, thin breaths whistled, accompanied by two loud snores.

Then, her legs thrown out of the covers, she fumbled around, finally struck a match and lit the candle. But she remained seated, her head so heavy that she fell back between her two shoulders, yielding to the invincible desire to fall back on the bolster.","The cuckoo clock downstairs struck four, but still nothing, only the faint whistle of breathing and the deeper sound of two people snoring.

Then, having swung her legs out of bed, she groped about and finally struck a match to light the candle.

"Étienne le gênait. Cependant, il continua, en lui lançant des regards obliques. Et il avait des réticences, des sous-entendus, il parlait du directeur, M. Hennebeau, de sa femme, de son neveu le petit Négrel, sans les nommer, répétant que ça ne pouvait pas continuer ainsi, que ça devait casser un de ces quatre matins. La misère était trop grande, il cita les usines qui fermaient, les ouvriers qui s’en allaient. Depuis un mois, il donnait plus de six livres de pain par jour. On lui avait dit, la veille, que M. Deneulin, le propriétaire d’une fosse voisine, ne savait comment tenir le coup. Du reste, il venait de recevoir une lettre de Lille, pleine de détails inquiétants.","Étienne bothered him. However, he continued, glancing sideways at her. And he had reservations, insinuations, he spoke of the director, M. Hennebeau, of his wife, of his nephew, little Négrel, without naming them, repeating that it couldn't go on like this, that it had to break one of these four mornings. The misery was too great, he mentioned the factories which were closing, the workers who were leaving. For a month he had been giving more than six pounds of bread a day.

Besides, he had just received a letter from Lille, full of disquieting details.","The presence of Étienne made him uneasy. Nevertheless he continued, watching him out of the corner of his eye as he did so. He spoke obliquely, leaving certain things unsaid. Without naming them he talked about the manager, Monsieur Hennebeau, and his wife, and his nephew, young Négrel, and he said how things could not go on like this, how one fine morning the lid would blow off. The poverty and suffering had spread too far, and he alluded to all the factories that were closing down and all the workers that were being laid off. He’d been giving away over six pounds of bread a day for the past month. Only yesterday he’d heard that Monsieur Deneulin, a local mine-owner, doubted whether he could survive. What’s more he’d just received a letter from Lille full of worrying news.","Étienne constrained him. However he went on, throwing sidelong glances in his direction.

"Un chemin creux s’enfonçait. Tout disparut. L’homme avait à droite une palissade, quelque mur de grosses planches fermant une voie ferrée ; tandis qu’un talus d’herbe s’élevait à gauche, surmonté de pignons confus, d’une vision de village aux toitures basses et uniformes. Il fit environ deux cents pas. Brusquement, à un coude du chemin, les feux reparurent près de lui, sans qu’il comprit davantage comment ils brûlaient si haut dans le ciel mort, pareils à des lunes fumeuses. Mais, au ras du sol, un autre spectacle venait de l’arrêter. C’était une masse lourde, un tas écrasé de constructions, d’où se dressait la silhouette d’une cheminée d’usine ; de rares lueurs sortaient des fenêtres encrassées, cinq ou six lanternes tristes étaient pendues dehors, à des charpentes dont les bois noircis alignaient vaguement des profils de tréteaux gigantesques ; et, de cette apparition fantastique, noyée de nuit et de fumée, une seule voix montait, la respiration grosse et longue d’un échappement de vapeur, qu’on ne voyait point.","A sunken path sank. Everything disappeared. The man had a palisade on the right, some wall of thick planks enclosing a railway line; while a grass bank rose to the left, surmounted by confused gables, a vision of a village with low and uniform roofs. He walked about two hundred paces. Suddenly, at a bend in the road, the fires reappeared near him, without his understanding how they were burning so high in the dead sky, like smoky moons. But, at ground level, another sight had just stopped him. It was a heavy mass, a crushed heap of buildings, from which rose the outline of a factory chimney; rare gleams came from the dirty windows, five or six sad lanterns were hung outside, on frames whose blackened wood vaguely aligned the profiles of gigantic trestles; and from this fantastic apparition, drowned in night and smoke, a single voice rose, the thick, long breathing of an escape of steam, which could not be seen.","A sunken path led away from the road, and the vision vanished. To the man’s right was a wooden fence, more like a wall, made from thick planks and running alongside a railway line; to his left rose a grass embankment topped by a jumble of gables, apparently the low, uniform roof-tops of a village. He walked on a further two hundred paces or so. Abruptly, at a turn in the path, the fires reappeared close by him, but he was still at a loss to explain how they could be burning so high up in this dead sky, like smouldering moons. But at ground level something else had caught his attention, some large, heavy mass, a huddled heap of buildings from which rose the outline of a factory chimney. Gleams of light could be seen here and there through grime-coated windows, while outside five or six paltry lanterns hung from a series of wooden structures whose blackened timbers seemed to be vaguely aligned in the shape of gigantic trestles. From the midst of this fantastical apparition, wreathed in smoke and darkness, rose the sound of a solitary voice; long, deep gasps of puffing steam, invisible to the eye.","The steep road led downwards, and everything disappeared. The man saw on his right a paling, a wall of coarse planks shutting in a line of rails, while a grassy slope rose on the left surmounted by confused gables, a vision of a village with low uniform roofs.

"Au milieu des champs de blé et de betteraves, le coron des Deux-Cent-Quarante dormait sous la nuit noire. On distinguait vaguement les quatre immenses corps de petites maisons adossées, des corps de caserne ou d’hôpital, géométriques, parallèles, que séparaient les trois larges avenues, divisées en jardins égaux. Et, sur le plateau désert, on entendait la seule plainte des rafales, dans les treillages arrachés des clôtures.","In the middle of wheat and beet fields, the settlement of Deux-Cent-Quarante slept under the black night.

"On se remit en marche. Plus loin, un carrefour se présenta, deux nouvelles galeries s’ouvraient, et la bande s’y divisa encore, les ouvriers se répartissaient peu à peu dans tous les chantiers de la mine. Maintenant, la galerie de roulage était boisée, des étais de chêne soutenaient le toit, faisaient à la roche ébouleuse une chemise de charpente, derrière laquelle on apercevait les lames des schistes, étincelants de mica, et la masse grossière des grès, ternes et rugueux. Des trains de berlines pleines ou vides passaient continuellement, se croisaient, avec leur tonnerre emporté dans l’ombre par des bêtes vagues, au trot de fantôme. Sur la double voie d’un garage, un long serpent noir dormait, un train arrêté, dont le cheval s’ébroua, si noyé de nuit, que sa croupe confuse était comme un bloc tombé de la voûte. Des portes d’aérage battaient, se refermaient lentement. Et, à mesure qu’on avançait, la galerie devenait plus étroite, plus basse, inégale de toit, forçant les échines à se plier sans cesse.","We set off again. Further on, a crossroads presented itself, two new galleries opened up, and the band divided again there, the workers were distributed little by little in all the workings of the mine. Now the haulage gallery was wooded, oak props held up the roof, made the crumbling rock a framework shirt, behind which one could see the blades of shale, sparkling with mica, and the coarse mass of sandstone, dull and rough. . Trains of sedans, full or empty, continually passed, passed each other, with their thunder carried away in the shadows by vague beasts, at the trot of phantoms. On the double track of a garage, a long black snake slept, a train stopped, whose horse shook itself, so drowned in the night, that its confused hindquarters were like a block fallen from the roof. Ventilation doors were swinging, closing slowly. And, as we advanced, the gallery became narrower, lower, uneven in roof, forcing the backs to bend incessantly.","On they trudged. Presently they came to a crossroads, where two further roadways led off, and the group divided again as the miners gradually dispersed among the various workings in the mine. Here the haulage roadway was timbered: oak props supported the roof and retained the crumbling rock behind a wooden framework through which one could see the layers of shale sparkling with mica and the solid mass of dull, rough sandstone. Trains of tubs went by all the time, full or empty, thundering past each other before being borne off into the darkness by phantom beasts at a ghostly trot. On a double track in a siding a long black snake lay sleeping: it was a stationary train, and its horse snorted in the darkness, which was so thick that the dim outline of the horse’s quarters looked like a lump of rock that had fallen from the roof. Ventilation doors opened with a bang and then slowly closed again. As they walked on, the roadway gradually got narrower and lower, and they kept having to stoop to pass beneath its uneven roof.","They again began their walk. Farther on they reached crossways, where two new galleries opened, and the band divided again, the workers gradually entering all the stalls of the mine. Now the wagon-gallery was constructed of wood; props of timber supported the roof, and made for the crumbly rock a screen of scaffolding, behind which one could see the plates of schist glimmering with mica, and the coarse masses of dull, rough sandstone. Trains of tubs, full or empty, continually passed, crossing each other with their thunder, borne into the shadow by vague beasts trotting by like phantoms. On the double way of a shunting line a long, black serpent slept, a train at standstill, with a snorting horse, whose crupper looked like a block fallen from the roof. Doors for ventilation were slowly opening and shutting. And as they advanced the gallery became more narrow and lower, and the roof irregular, forcing them to bend their backs constantly."
"Maheu, ébranlé, restait cependant plein de défiance.","Maheu, shaken, remained however full of mistrust.","This had its effect on Maheu, though he remained very sceptical:",Maheu was shaken but remained full of doubts.
"Redevenu très rouge, il cassa les briques, il les jeta.

She lashed at him, stunned him, barked words of death behind him, smothering her daughter on her throat, in her clenched arms; and he was still advancing, he found himself face to face with the guns.","The blood rushed to his cheeks, and he broke some bricks and threw them. She whipped him on so hard that it made his head spin, baying at him from behind and urging him to the kill, all the while nearly suffocating the child across her chest with her tensed arms; and he kept moving forward until eventually he stood directly in front of the rifles.","Becoming very red, he broke some bricks and threw them. She lashed him on, dazing him, shouting behind him cries of death, stifling her daughter against her breast with the spasm of her arms; and he still moved forward until he was opposite the guns."
"Souvent, il arrivait ainsi, à la nuit noire. Les Maheu, dès le second jour, avaient appris sa retraite. Mais ils gardaient le secret, personne dans le coron ne savait au juste ce qu’était devenu le jeune homme. Cela l’entourait d’une légende. On continuait à croire en lui, des bruits mystérieux couraient : il allait reparaître avec une armée, avec des caisses pleines d’or ; et c’était toujours l’attente religieuse d’un miracle, l’idéal réalisé, l’entrée brusque dans la cité de justice qu’il leur avait promise. Les uns disaient l’avoir vu au fond d’une calèche, en compagnie de trois messieurs, sur la route de Marchiennes ; d’autres affirmaient qu’il était encore pour deux jours en Angleterre. À la longue, cependant, la méfiance commençait, des farceurs l’accusaient de se cacher dans une cave, où la Mouquette lui tenait chaud ; car cette liaison connue lui avait fait du tort. C’était, au milieu de sa popularité, une lente désaffection, la sourde poussée des convaincus pris de désespoir, et dont le nombre, peu à peu, devait grossir.","Often it happened that way, in the dark of night.

Some said they had seen him in the back of a carriage, in the company of three gentlemen, on the road to Marchiennes; others affirmed that he was still for two days in England. In the long run, however, mistrust began, pranksters accused him of hiding in a cellar, where Mouquette kept him warm; for this known liaison had done him harm. It was, in the midst of his popularity, a slow disaffection, the dull thrust of the convinced, seized with despair, and whose number, little by little, was to swell.","He would often call in like this when it was completely dark. From the second day the Maheus had known about his hiding-place, but they kept the secret, and no one in the village knew exactly what had become of the young man.

People continued to believe in him, and mysterious rumours circulated, like how one day he would return at the head of an army with coffers full of gold; and it was still as though everyone was waiting religiously for a miracle, for their hour to come, for the sudden entry into the city of justice that he had promised them. Some said they’d seen him in a smart carriage, with three other gentlemen, heading for Marchiennes; others maintained that he would be remaining in England for another couple of days. Eventually, however, they began to doubt him, and some jokers accused him of hiding in a cellar with La Mouquette to keep him warm; for his affair with her was public knowledge and had done him harm. His widespread popularity was slowly beginning to give way to disillusion as more and more of the faithful began to despair. Their number would grow.","He often came thus at night-time.

La veuve Désir lui offrit de prendre quelque chose, mais il refusa. Inutile ! il parlait sans boire. Seulement, il était pressé, parce que, le soir, il comptait pousser jusqu’à Joiselle, où il voulait s’entendre avec Legoujeux. Tous alors entrèrent en paquet dans la salle de bal. Maheu et Levaque, qui arrivaient en retard, suivirent ces messieurs.

Only he was in a hurry, because in the evening he intended to push on as far as Joiselle, where he wanted to get along with Legoujeux. All of them then entered the ballroom in a pack.

Widow Desire asked if she could get him anything, but he declined. No need! He could speak without having a drink first. But time was pressing, he wanted to make it to Joiselle that evening and sort things out with Legoujeux. And so the whole group entered the hall together. Maheu and Levaque, arriving late, followed them in. The door was locked so that they could ‘make themselves at home’, which had the laughter-merchants guffawing even louder when Zacharie asked Mouquet at the top of his voice if this meant they were all going to get a screw.","Étienne walked radiantly in his shadow, while Rasseneur, in consternation, did not dare to offer his hand.

This made the jokers laugh even more, Zacharie shouting to Mouquet that perhaps they were going to get them all with child in there."

"Alors, sur le terri ébranlé, Souvarine se leva. Il avait reconnu la Maheude et Zacharie, sanglotant en face de cet effondrement, dont le poids pesait si lourd sur les têtes des misérables qui agonisaient au fond. Et il jeta sa dernière cigarette, il s’éloigna sans un regard en arrière, dans la nuit devenue noire. Au loin, son ombre diminua, se fondit avec l’ombre. C’était là-bas qu’il allait, à l’inconnu. Il allait, de son air tranquille, à l’extermination, partout où il y aurait de la dynamite, pour faire sauter les villes et les hommes. Ce sera lui, sans doute, quand la bourgeoisie agonisante entendra, sous elle, à chacun de ses pas, éclater le pavé des rues.","Then, on the shaken floor, Souvarine got up. He had recognized Maheude and Zacharie, sobbing in the face of this collapse, the weight of which weighed so heavily on the heads of the wretches who were dying at the bottom. And he threw away his last cigarette, he walked away without looking back, into the darkened night. In the distance, his shadow diminished, merging with the shadow. That was where he was going, to the unknown. He went, with his calm air, to the extermination, wherever there would be dynamite, to blow up cities and men. It will be him, no doubt, when the dying middle class hears, beneath them, at each of their steps, the cobblestones of the streets burst.","At that moment, up on the shaken spoil-heap, Souvarine rose to his feet. He had recognized La Maheude and Zacharie sobbing together at the spectacle of this collapse, the weight of which would be piling down on to the heads of those wretched people still fighting for their lives below. He threw away his last cigarette and, without a backward glance, walked off into the darkness which had now fallen. In the distance his shadowy figure faded from view and melted into the blackness of the night. He was headed somewhere, anywhere, off into the unknown. In his usual calm way he was bound upon extermination, bound for wherever there was dynamite to blow cities and people to smithereens. And in all probability, when the bourgeoisie’s final hour arrives and every cobble is exploding in the road beneath its feet, there he will be.","Then on the shaken pit-bank Souvarine rose up. He had recognized Maheude and Zacharie sobbing before this downfall, the weight of which was so heavy on the heads of the wretches who were in agony beneath. And he threw down his last cigarette; he went away, without looking back, into the now dark night. Afar his shadow diminished and mingled with the darkness. He was going over there, to the unknown. He was going tranquilly to extermination, wherever there might be dynamite to blow up towns and men. He will be there, without doubt, when the middle class in agony shall hear the pavement of the streets bursting up beneath their feet."

"Alors, devant ces coups répétés, l’espoir renaissait chez Étienne, il finissait par croire qu’un troisième mois de résistance achèverait le monstre, la bête lasse et repue, accroupie là-bas comme une idole, dans l’inconnu de son tabernacle. Il savait qu’à la suite des troubles de Montsou une vive émotion s’était emparée des journaux de Paris, toute une polémique violente entre les feuilles officieuses et les feuilles de l’opposition, des récits terrifiants, que l’on exploitait surtout contre l’Internationale, dont l’Empire prenait peur, après l’avoir encouragée ; et, la Régie n’osant plus faire la sourde oreille, deux des régisseurs avaient daigné venir pour une enquête, mais d’un air de regret, sans paraître s’inquiéter du dénouement, si désintéressés, que trois jours après ils étaient repartis, en déclarant que les choses allaient le mieux du monde. Pourtant, on lui affirmait d’autre part que ces messieurs, durant leur séjour, siégeaient en permanence, déployaient une activité fébrile, enfoncés dans des affaires dont personne autour d’eux ne soufflait mot. Et il les accusait de jouer la confiance, il arrivait à traiter leur départ de fuite affolée, certain maintenant du triomphe, puisque ces terribles hommes lâchaient tout.","So, in the face of these repeated blows, hope was reborn in Étienne, he ended up believing that a third month of resistance would finish off the monster, the weary and sated beast, crouching over there like an idol, in the unknown of its tabernacle. . He knew that following the troubles at Montsou a lively emotion had taken hold of the Paris newspapers, a whole violent polemic between the unofficial sheets and the sheets of the opposition, terrifying stories, which were exploited above all against the International, of which the Empire took fright, after having encouraged it; and, the Régie no longer daring to turn a deaf ear, two of the managers had deigned to come for an investigation, but with an air of regret, without seeming to worry about the outcome, so disinterested that three days later they had left, stating that things were going for the best in the world. However, he was told on the other hand that these gentlemen, during their stay, sat permanently, displayed a feverish activity, immersed in affairs of which no one around them breathed a word. And he accused them of playing trust, he managed to treat their departure as a panicked flight, certain now of triumph, since these terrible men let go of everything.","And so, presented with the news of this series of disasters, Étienne began once more to hope, and he came to believe that a third month of resistance would finish the monster off, that weary, sated beast squatting like an idol in its far-away temple. He knew that the trouble at Montsou had caused much excitement in the Paris press: a furious debate was raging between the newspapers sympathetic to the government and those which supported the opposition, and terrifying stories were circulating and being used in particular against the International, which the Emperor and his government had at first encouraged but which it now viewed with increasing apprehension. Moreover, since the Company’s Board of Directors could no longer continue to turn a deaf ear to what was going on, two of its members had deigned to come and hold an inquiry, but with such a reluctant air and with such apparent lack of concern for how things would turn out, so thoroughly uninterested, in fact, that they had left three days later saying that everything was perfectly fine. But Étienne had learned from other sources that during their visit these gentlemen had been in permanent session, working at fever pitch and investigating all manner of things which no one in their entourage was prepared to divulge. Whistling in the dark was how Étienne saw it, and he even managed to interpret their hurried departure as sheer panic. Now he was certain of victory, for those fearsome gentlemen had clearly thrown in the towel.","In the face of these repeated blows, hope was again born in Étienne; he came to believe that a third month of resistance would crush the monster--the weary, sated beast, crouching down there like an idol in his unknown tabernacle. He knew that after the Montsou troubles there had been great excitement in the Paris journals, quite a violent controversy between the official newspapers and the opposition newspapers, terrible narratives, which were especially directed against the International, of which the empire was becoming afraid after having first encouraged it; and the directors not daring to turn a deaf ear any longer, two of them had condescended to come and hold an inquiry, but with an air of regret, not appearing to care about the upshot; so disinterested, that in three days they went away again, declaring that everything was going on as well as possible. He was told, however, from other quarters that during their stay these gentlemen sat permanently, displaying feverish activity, and absorbed in transactions of which no one about them uttered a word. And he charged them with affecting confidence they did not feel, and came to look upon their departure as a nervous flight, feeling now certain of triumph since these terrible men were letting everything go."

"On traversa la forêt, on prit la route de Vandame à Marchiennes. Comme on approchait du Tartaret, Jeanne demanda à Mme Hennebeau si elle connaissait la Côte-Verte ; et celle-ci, malgré son séjour de cinq ans déjà dans le pays, avoua qu’elle n’était jamais allée de ce côté. Alors, on fit un détour. Le Tartaret, à la lisière du bois, était une lande inculte, d’une stérilité volcanique, sous laquelle, depuis des siècles, brûlait une mine de houille incendiée. Cela se perdait dans la légende, des mineurs du pays racontaient une histoire : le feu du ciel tombant sur cette Sodome des entrailles de la terre, où les herscheuses se souillaient d’abominations ; si bien qu’elles n’avaient pas même eu le temps de remonter, et qu’aujourd’hui encore, elles flambaient au fond de cet enfer. Les roches calcinées, rouge sombre, se couvraient d’une efflorescence d’alun, comme d’une lèpre. Du soufre poussait, en une fleur jaune, au bord des fissures. La nuit, les braves qui osaient risquer un œil à ces trous juraient y voir des flammes, les âmes criminelles en train de grésiller dans la braise intérieure. Des lueurs errantes couraient au ras du sol, des vapeurs chaudes, empoisonnant l’ordure et la sale cuisine du diable, fumaient continuellement. Et, ainsi qu’un miracle d’éternel printemps, au milieu de cette lande maudite du Tartaret, la Côte-Verte se dressait avec ses gazons toujours verts, ses hêtres dont les feuilles se renouvelaient sans cesse, ses champs où mûrissaient jusqu’à trois récoltes. C’était une serre naturelle, chauffée par l’incendie des couches profondes. Jamais la neige n’y séjournait. L’énorme bouquet de verdure, à côté des arbres dépouillés de la forêt, s’épanouissait dans cette journée de décembre, sans que la gelée en eût même roussi les bords.","We crossed the forest, we took the road from Vandame to Marchiennes. As they approached Tartaret, Jeanne asked Madame Hennebeau if she knew the Côte-Verte; and the latter, in spite of her stay of five years already in the country, confessed that she had never been that way. So we took a detour. Tartaret, on the edge of the wood, was an uncultivated moor, of volcanic sterility, under which, for centuries, a burnt coal mine had been burning. It was lost in legend, the miners of the country told a story: fire from heaven falling on this Sodom of the bowels of the earth, where the putters defiled themselves with abominations; so much so that they had not even had time to come back up, and that even today they were blazing at the bottom of this hell. The calcined rocks, dark red, were covered with an efflorescence of alum, like leprosy. Sulfur grew, in a yellow flower, at the edge of the cracks. At night, the brave who dared to peek into these holes swore they saw flames there, criminal souls sizzling in the embers within. Wandering lights ran along the ground, hot vapors, poisoning the filth and the devil's dirty kitchen, smoked continually. And, like a miracle of eternal spring, in the middle of this cursed moor of Tartaret, the Côte-Verte stood up with its evergreen lawns, its beeches whose leaves were constantly renewed, its fields where up to three crops. It was a natural greenhouse, heated by the fire of the deep layers. The snow never stayed there. The enormous clump of greenery, beside the bare trees of the forest, blossomed on this December day, without the frost having even scorched its edges.","They drove through the forest and at Vandame took the road to Marchiennes. As they were approaching Le Tartaret, Jeanne asked Mme Hennebeau if she knew of La Côte Verte, and she admitted that, despite having lived there for five years, she had never been this way before. So they made a detour. Situated at the edge of the wood, Le Tartaret was a stretch of barren, volcanic moorland, beneath which a coal-seam had been burning permanently for centuries past. The origins of the place were lost in the mists of time, and the local miners told a story about how the fire of heaven had fallen upon this underground Sodom where putters defiled themselves in all manner of abomination; and it had struck so suddenly that they had not even had time to return to the surface and continued to roast in its hell-fires to this very day. The rock had burned to a dark red and was covered in a leprous bloom of potash. Sulphur grew along the fissures like yellow flowers. After dark those brave enough to put an eye to these cracks in the earth swore that they could see flames and the souls of the damned frying in the hot coals beneath. Gleams of light flickered along the ground, and hot vapours rose continually, like a foul and poisonous stench from the devil’s kitchen. And in the middle of this accursed moor of Le Tartaret, La Côte Verte rose as though miraculously blessed by an eternal spring, with grass that was forever green, beech trees that were continually producing new leaves, and fields that yielded as many as three crops a year. It was a natural hothouse, warmed by the combustion taking place in the deep strata beneath. Snow never settled there. And on this December day its enormous bouquet of greenery rose beside the bare trees of the forest, and the frost had not even blackened the edges of the leaves.","They crossed the forest, taking the road from Vandame to Marchiennes. As they approached Tartaret, Jeanne asked Madame Hennebeau if she knew CôteVerte, and the latter, in spite of her stay of five years in the country, acknowledged that she had never been on that side. Then they made a detour. Tartaret, on the outskirts of the forest, was an uncultivated moor, of volcanic sterility, under which for ages a coal mine had been burning. Its history was lost in legend. The miners of the place said that fire from heaven had fallen on this Sodom in the bowels of the earth, where the putter-girls had committed abominations together, so that they had not even had the time to come to the surface, and today were still burning at the bottom of this hell. The calcined rocks, of a sombre red, were covered by an efflorescence of alum as by a leprosy. Sulphur grew like a yellow flower at the edge of the fissures. At night, those who were brave enough to venture to look into these holes declared that they saw flames there, sinful souls shrivelling in the furnace within. Wandering lights moved over the soil, and hot vapours, the poisons from the devil's ordure and his dirty kitchen, were constantly smoking. And like a miracle of eternal spring, in the midst of this accursed moor of Tartaret, Côte-Verte appeared, with its meadows for ever green, its beeches with leaves unceasingly renewed, its fields where three harvests ripened. It was a natural hot-house, warmed by the fire in the deep strata beneath. The snow never lay on it. The enormous bouquet of verdure, beside the leafless forest trees, blossomed on this December day, and the frost had not even scorched the edge of it."

"Mais, à gauche, la voie qui conduisait à l’écurie était barrée par un éboulement. Le voyage recommença, plus pénible et plus dangereux.

Il dut se hâter pour ne pas perdre de vue la lumière, il se jeta dans la même galerie ; seulement, où l’enfant passait à l’aise, avec sa souplesse de serpent, lui ne pouvait se glisser sans meurtrir ses membres. Cette galerie, comme toutes les anciennes voies, s’était resserrée, se resserrait encore chaque jour, sous la continuelle poussée des terrains ; et il n’y avait plus, à certaines places, qu’un boyau, qui devait finir par s’effacer lui-même. Dans ce travail d’étranglement, les bois éclatés, déchirés, devenaient un péril, menaçaient de lui scier la chair, de l’enfiler au passage, à la pointe de leurs échardes, aiguës comme des épées. Il n’avançait qu’avec précaution, à genoux ou sur le ventre, tâtant l’ombre devant lui. Brusquement, une bande de rats le piétina, lui courut de la nuque aux pieds, dans un galop de fuite.","But, on the left, the road which led to the stable was blocked by a landslide.

He had to hurry so as not to lose sight of the light, he threw himself into the same gallery; only, where the child passed at his ease, with his snakelike suppleness, he could not slip in without bruising his limbs. This gallery, like all the old ways, had been narrowed, was still narrowing each day, under the continual pressure of the ground; and in some places there was only a trench, which was to end by obliterating itself. In this work of strangulation, the splintered, torn woods became a danger, threatened to saw through his flesh, to thread him as he passed, at the point of their splinters, sharp as swords. He moved cautiously, on his knees or on his stomach, feeling the shadow in front of him. Suddenly, a pack of rats trampled on him, ran from his neck to his feet, in a gallop of flight.","But the road that led away on the left towards the stable was blocked by a rock-fall.

He had to hurry so as not to lose sight of the light, and rushed into a roadway after it; but where the child was able to wriggle through easily with the suppleness of a snake, he could only squeeze past, bruising his arms and legs as he went. Like all old mine workings, this particular roadway had narrowed and was continuing to get narrower by the day from the constant pressure of the earth; and in places it was no bigger than a tube, which would eventually disappear of its own accord. As a result of this gradual strangulation the timbering had split and its jagged edges presented a real danger, threatening to saw through his flesh or to impale him on the points of its sword-like splinters as he went by. He had to exercise the greatest care as he edged forward on his knees or stomach, groping in the darkness ahead of him. Suddenly a swarm of rats ran over the top of him, dashing the length of his body in terrified flight.","But on the left, the path which led to the stable was closed by a landslip. The journey began again, now more painful and more dangerous. Frightened bats flew about and clung to the roof of the gallery. He had to hasten so as not to lose sight of the light; only where the child passed with ease, with the suppleness of a serpent, he could not glide through without bruising his limbs. This gallery, like all the older passages, was narrow, and grew narrower every day from the constant fall of soil; at certain places it was a mere tube which would eventually be effaced. In this strangling labour the torn and broken wood became a peril, threatening to saw into his flesh, or to run him through with the points of splinters, sharp as swords. He could only advance with precaution, on his knees or belly, feeling in the darkness before him. Suddenly a band of rats stamped over him, running from his neck to his feet in their galloping flight."

"Deux jours après, il y eut une autre histoire. Le lundi et le mardi, Jeanlin que l’on croyait au Voreux, tranquillement à la besogne, s’échappa, tira une bordée dans les marais et dans la forêt de Vandame, avec Bébert et Lydie. Il les avait débauchés, jamais on ne sut à quelles rapines, à quels jeux d’enfants précoces ils s’étaient livrés tous les trois. Lui, reçut une forte correction, une fessée que sa mère lui appliqua dehors, sur le trottoir, devant la marmaille du coron terrifiée. Avait-on jamais vu ça ? des enfants à elle, qui coûtaient depuis leur naissance, qui devaient rapporter maintenant ! Et, dans ce cri, il y avait le souvenir de sa dure jeunesse, la misère héréditaire faisant de chaque petit de la portée un gagne-pain pour plus tard.","Two days later, there was another story. On Monday and Tuesday, Jeanlin, who was believed to be at Voreux, quietly at work, escaped, fired a broadside in the marshes and in the forest of Vandame, with Bébert and Lydie. He had debauched them, no one ever knew what rapines, what precocious childish games the three of them had indulged in. He received a strong beating, a spanking that his mother applied to him outside, on the sidewalk, in front of the terrified children of the settlement. Have we ever seen that? children of hers, who had cost since their birth, who were to pay now! And, in this cry, there was the memory of his hard youth, the hereditary misery making each little one of the litter a livelihood for later.","Two days later there was another drama. On Monday and Tuesday Jeanlin did a bunk, and all the time everyone thought he was quietly working away at Le Voreux he was actually out on the loose with Bébert and Lydie, roaming the marshes and the Vandame forest. He was the ringleader, and nobody ever discovered quite what manner of precocious and larcenous games the three of them got up to. He himself received a heavy punishment, a thrashing from his mother, which she conducted out in the street and in front of the terrified child population of the village. Had anyone ever seen the like? A child of hers! Who’d cost her money since the day it was born, who should now be earning its keep! And her outrage carried the memory of her own harsh childhood, the heritage of destitution which made her see every child in the brood as a future breadwinner.","Two days after there was another incident. On Monday and Tuesday Jeanlin, who was supposed to be quietly engaged on his task at the Voreux, had escaped, to run away into the marshes and the forest of Vandame with Bébert and Lydie. He had seduced them; no one knew to what plunder or to what games of precocious children they had all three given themselves up. He received a vigorous punishment, a whipping which his mother applied to him on the pavement outside before the terrified children of the settlement. Who could have thought such a thing of children belonging to her, who had cost so much since their birth, and who ought now to be bringing something in? And in this cry there was the remembrance of her own hard youth, of the hereditary misery which made of each little one in the brood a bread-winner later on."

Alors, il sembla maigrir encore sous l’éponge, la chair si blême, si transparente, qu’on voyait les os. C’était une pitié, cette dégénérescence dernière d’une race de misérables, ce rien du tout souffrant, à demi broyé par l’écrasement des roches.

"Lucie et Jeanne se serrèrent contre Mme Hennebeau, défaillante ; tandis que Négrel se mettait devant elles, comme pour les protéger de son corps. Était-ce donc ce soir même que l’antique société craquait ? Et ce qu’ils virent, alors, acheva de les hébéter. La bande s’écoulait, il n’y avait plus que la queue des traînards, lorsque la Mouquette déboucha. Elle s’attardait, elle guettait les bourgeois, sur les portes de leurs jardins, aux fenêtres de leurs maisons ; et, quand elle en découvrait, ne pouvant leur cracher au nez, elle leur montrait ce qui était pour elle le comble de son mépris. Sans doute elle en aperçut un, car brusquement elle releva ses jupes, tendit les fesses, montra son derrière énorme, nu dans un dernier flamboiement du soleil. Il n’avait rien d’obscène, ce derrière, et ne faisait pas rire, farouche.","Lucie and Jeanne hugged Madame Hennebeau, failing; while Negrel placed himself in front of them, as if to protect them with his body.

She lingered, she watched the bourgeois, at the gates of their gardens, at the windows of their houses; and, when she discovered any, not being able to spit in their face, she showed them what was for her the height of her contempt. No doubt she saw one, for suddenly she lifted her skirts, stretched out her buttocks, showed her enormous behind, naked in a last blaze of the sun. There was nothing obscene about that bottom, and it didn't make people laugh, fierce.","Lucie and Jeanne clung to Mme Hennebeau, who had nearly passed out, while Négrel stood in front of them as though to protect them with his body. Was this the night when the old order would finally crumble? What they saw next rendered them quite speechless. The main body of the mob was moving away, leaving only some stragglers, when La Mouquette emerged on to the road. She had been taking her time, watching out for any bourgeois at a window or a garden gate; and when she spotted one, being unable to spit in their face, she would treat them to what was for her the supreme expression of her contempt. Now, having presumably just seen one, she suddenly lifted her skirts and showed them her buttocks, proffering her enormous naked bottom in the dying rays of the sun. And there was nothing at all obscene about this bottom nor anything comic in its uncompromising display.","Lucie and Jeanne pressed themselves against Madame Hennebeau, who was almost fainting; while Négrel placed himself before them as though to protect them by his body.

The band had nearly passed by, there were only a few stragglers left, when Mouquette came up. She was delaying, watching the bourgeois at their garden gates or the windows of their houses; and whenever she saw them, as she was not able to spit in their faces, she showed them what for her was the climax of contempt. Doubtless she perceived someone now, for suddenly she raised her skirts, bent her back, and showed her enormous buttocks, naked beneath the last rays of the sun. There was nothing obscene in those fierce buttocks, and nobody laughed."

"Chez les Maheu, la quinzaine s’annonçait comme devant être plus maigre encore. Aussi la Maheude s’aigrissait-elle, malgré sa modération et son bon sens. Est-ce que sa fille Catherine ne s’était pas avisée de découcher une nuit ? Le lendemain matin, elle était rentrée si lasse, si malade de cette aventure, qu’elle n’avait pu se rendre à la fosse ; et elle pleurait, elle racontait qu’il n’y avait point de sa faute, car c’était Chaval qui l’avait gardée, menaçant de la battre, si elle se sauvait. Il devenait fou de jalousie, il voulait l’empêcher de retourner dans le lit d’Étienne, où il savait bien, disait-il, que la famille la faisait coucher. Furieuse, la Maheude, après avoir défendu à sa fille de revoir une pareille brute, parlait d’aller le gifler à Montsou. Mais ce n’en était pas moins une journée perdue, et la petite, maintenant qu’elle avait ce galant, aimait encore mieux ne pas en changer.","Among the Maheus, the fortnight promised to be even leaner.

Furious, Maheude, after forbidding her daughter to see such a brute again, spoke of going to slap him at Montsou. But it was none the less a wasted day, and the little one, now that she had this suitor, preferred not to change it.","In the Maheu household the fortnight in prospect promised to be even more difficult than the last, which made La Maheude increasingly sour despite her good sense and even temper.

He was becoming violently jealous now and wanted to stop her returning to Étienne’s bed, which, he said, he knew full well her family made her share. La Maheude was furious and, having forbidden her daughter to see such a brute again, she threatened to go to Montsou and slap his face for him. None of which stopped it being one day’s pay less. As for Catherine, now that she had got herself a man she preferred not to swap him.","Among the Maheus the fortnight threatened to be more meagre than ever. Maheude grew bitter, in spite of her moderation and good sense. Her daughter Catherine, too, had taken it into her head to stay out one night.

He was becoming mad with jealousy, and wished to prevent her from returning to Étienne's bed, where he well knew, he said, that the family made her sleep.

Their terror was increased by the uncertainty of the danger, of this threat which they felt there, without knowing it.","Everyone was so shocked that they downed tools and ran. They were horrified at the thought of being left behind all alone in the pit like this so far from the shaft. They had kept only their lamps and ran along in single file, the men, the boys and Catherine. Even the deputy was panicking and shouting for help, more and more terrified by the silence and the endless series of deserted roadways. What was going on? Why wasn’t there a soul to be seen? What could have happened to make everyone vanish like this? Their terror increased with the uncertainty of the danger facing them, of the threat that they could sense but could not understand.","The bewilderment was so great that the ten men threw down their tools to rush away. The idea that they were abandoned, left alone at the bottom of the mine, so far from the pit-eye, drove them wild. They only kept their lamp and ran in single file--the men, the boys, the putter; the captain himself lost his head and shouted out appeals, more and more frightened at the silence in this endless desert of galleries. What then had happened that they did not meet a soul? What accident could thus have driven away their mates? Their terror was increased by the uncertainty of the danger, this threat which they felt there without knowing what it was."

"Alors, en arrivant devant le débit de la Tête-Coupée, Chaval eut l’idée d’y faire entrer son amoureuse, pour assister à un concours de pinsons, affiché sur la porte depuis huit jours. Quinze cloutiers, des clouteries de Marchiennes, s’étaient rendus à l’appel, chacun avec une douzaine de cages ; et les petites cages obscures, où les pinsons aveuglés restaient immobiles, se trouvaient déjà accrochées à une palissade, dans la cour du cabaret. Il s’agissait de compter celui qui, pendant une heure, répéterait le plus de fois la phrase de son chant. Chaque cloutier, avec une ardoise, se tenait près de ses cages, marquant, surveillant ses voisins, surveillé lui-même. Et les pinsons étaient partis, les « chichouïeux » au chant plus gras, les « batisecouics » d’une sonorité aiguë, tout d’abord timides, ne risquant que de rares phrases, puis s’excitant les uns les autres, pressant le rythme, puis emportés enfin d’une telle rage d’émulation, qu’on en voyait tomber et mourir. Violemment, les cloutiers les fouettaient de la voix, leur criaient en wallon de chanter encore, encore, encore un petit coup ; tandis que les spectateurs, une centaine de personnes, demeuraient muets, passionnés, au milieu de cette musique infernale de cent quatre-vingts pinsons répétant tous la même cadence, à contretemps. Ce fut un « batisecouic » qui gagna le premier prix, une cafetière en fer battu.","So, on arriving in front of the Tête-Coupée bar, Chaval had the idea of having his lover enter there, to attend a competition of finches, which had been posted on the door for the past week. Fifteen nail makers, from the Marchiennes nail factories, had gone to the roll-call, each with a dozen cages; and the little dark cages, in which the blind finches remained motionless, were already hung on a palisade in the courtyard of the cabaret. It was a question of counting the one who, during an hour, would repeat the phrase of his song the most times. Each nailer, with a slate, stood near his cages, marking, watching his neighbors, watching himself. And the finches were gone, the ""chichouïeux"" with their fatter song, the ""batisecouics"" with a shrill sonority, at first timid, risking only a few phrases, then exciting each other, pressing the rhythm , then finally carried away by such a rage of emulation, that one saw some fall and die. Violently, the nail makers whipped them with their voices, yelled at them in Walloon to sing again, again, a little more; while the spectators, a hundred people, remained silent, passionate, in the midst of this infernal music of one hundred and eighty finches all repeating the same cadence, out of time. It was a ""batisecouic"" that won first prize, a wrought iron coffee pot.","Then they came to the Severed Head, and Chaval thought he would take Catherine in to watch a songbird competition which had been advertised on the door for the past week. Fifteen nailers had turned up from the nail-works at Marchiennes, each with a dozen cages; and these little cages, each one covered so that the sightless bird inside remained quite still, were already in place, hanging from a fence in the yard. The object was to see which bird would repeat its song the greatest number of times in one hour. Each nailer would stand next to his own cages, recording the tally on a slate and keeping an eye on his neighbours just as they kept an eye on him. And then the birds began: the chichouïeux with their deeper note, the batisecouics with their high-pitched trill, all of them hesitant at first, venturing only a few snatches of song, then gradually getting each other going, increasing the tempo, and eventually becoming so carried away by the spirit of competition that some of them actually fell off their perch and died. The nailers would urge them on roughly, shouting at them in Walloon to keep singing, more, more, just one last little burst of song; while the spectators, a hundred or more of them, stood there in silence, riveted, surrounded by this infernal music of a hundred and eighty finches all repeating the same song at different intervals. A batisecouic won first prize, which was a metal coffee-pot.","Then, as they arrived before another bar, the Tete-Coupée, it occurred to Chaval to take his sweetheart in to a competition of chaffinches which had been announced on the door for the past week. Fifteen nail-makers from the Marchiennes nail works had responded to the appeal, each with a dozen cages; and the gloomy little cages in which the blinded finches sat motionless were already hung upon a paling in the inn yard. It was a question as to which, in the course of an hour, should repeat the phrase of its song the greatest number of times. Each nail-maker with a slate stood near his cages to mark, watching his neighbours and watched by them. And the chaffinches had begun, the chichouïeux with the deeper note, the batisecouics with their shriller note, all at first timid, and only risking a rare phrase, then, excited by each other's songs, increasing the pace; then at last carried away by such a rage of rivalry that they would even fall dead. The nail-makers violently whipped them on with their voices, shouting out to them in Walloon to sing more, still more, yet a little more, while the spectators, about a hundred people, stood by in mute fascination in the midst of this infernal music of a hundred and eighty chaffinches all repeating the same cadence out of time. It was a batisecouic which gained the first prize, a metal coffee-pot."
– Tant mieux ! répondit la Brûlé. Ce sera de la besogne faite… Ah ! nom de Dieu ! je disais bien que je leur ferais payer la mort de mon homme !,- So much the better ! replied La Brule.

"Elle était au bas de la taille, appuyée sur sa pelle ; et un malaise l’envahissait, pendant qu’elle les regardait tous d’un air imbécile, sans obéir. Elles les voyait mal, à la lueur rougeâtre des lampes, entièrement nus comme des bêtes, si noirs, si encrassés de sueur et de charbon, que leur nudité ne la gênait pas. C’était une besogne obscure, des échines de singe qui se tendaient, une vision infernale de membres roussis, s’épuisant au milieu de coups sourds et de gémissements. Mais eux la distinguaient mieux sans doute, car les rivelaines s’arrêtèrent de taper, et ils la plaisantèrent d’avoir ôté sa culotte.","She was at the bottom of the waist, leaning on her shovel; and a feeling of unease overcame her, while she looked at them all with an imbecile air, without obeying.

It was a dark task, monkey spines tensing, an infernal vision of scorched limbs, exhausting themselves in the midst of dull blows and groans. But they no doubt distinguished her better, for the ladies stopped typing, and they made fun of her for having taken off her breeches.","She was standing at the foot of the coal-face, leaning on her shovel; and she began to feel faint, staring at everyone with a blank expression and ignoring Chaval’s order. She could barely see them in the reddish glow from the lamps; and though they were stark naked, like animals, they were so black with the grime of sweat and coal-dust that their nakedness did not trouble her. They seemed bent upon some indeterminate labour, an array of monkeys’ backs straining with effort, an infernal vision of ruddy limbs caught up in a great thudding and grunting. But they must have been able to see her better because the picks stopped tapping and the men started teasing her about having taken off her trousers.","She was at the bottom of the cutting, leaning on her shovel; she was feeling ill, and she looked at them all with a foolish air without obeying.

"Dehors, la nuit était tombée, et la lune, derrière des nuages, éclairait la terre d’une clarté louche. Au lieu de retraverser les jardins, la Maheude fit le tour, désolée, n’osant rentrer chez elle. Mais, le long des façades mortes, toutes les portes sentaient la famine et sonnaient le creux. À quoi bon frapper ? c’était misère et compagnie. Depuis des semaines qu’on ne mangeait plus, l’odeur de l’oignon elle-même était partie, cette odeur forte qui annonçait le coron de loin, dans la campagne ; maintenant, il n’avait que l’odeur des vieux caveaux, l’humidité des trous où rien ne vit. Les bruits vagues se mouraient, des larmes étouffées, des jurons perdus ; et, dans le silence qui s’alourdissait peu à peu, on entendait venir le sommeil de la faim, l’écrasement des corps jetés en travers des lits, sous les cauchemars des ventres vides.","Outside, night had fallen, and the moon, behind clouds, lit the earth with a suspicious light. Instead of recrossing the gardens, Maheude walked around, desolate, not daring to go home. But, along the dead facades, all the doors smelled of famine and rang hollow. What's the use of knocking? it was misery and company. We hadn't eaten for weeks, and even the smell of the onion had gone, that strong smell which announced the settlement from afar, in the countryside; now he had only the smell of old vaults, the dampness of holes where nothing lives. Vague noises died away, stifled tears, lost oaths; and, in the silence which grew heavier little by little, one heard the coming of the sleep of hunger, the crushing of bodies thrown across the beds, under the nightmares of empty bellies.","Night had fallen outside, and the cloud-decked moon shed a strange light over the earth. Instead of going back across the gardens, La Maheude went the long way round, sick at heart and unable to face going home. But there was no sign of life coming from the line of houses, and every door spoke of famine and empty stomachs. What was the use of knocking? This was the village of Misery For All. After weeks of starvation even the reek of onion had disappeared, that pungent aroma which meant that one could smell the village from far away in the countryside. Now there was just a smell of old cellars, of dank holes where nothing lives. Vague sounds died away, stifled sobs and curses that faded on the air; and in the deepening silence one could sense the approach of famine’s rest, the slumber of exhausted bodies sprawled on their beds and racked by the nightmare visions that feed on empty stomachs.","Outside night had come on, and the moon behind the clouds was lighting up the earth with a dubious glow. Instead of traversing the gardens again, Maheude went round, despairing, afraid to go home again. But along the dead frontages all the doors smelled of famine and sounded hollow. What was the good of knocking? There was wretchedness everywhere. For weeks since they had had nothing to eat. Even the odour of onion had gone, that strong odour which revealed the settlement from afar across the country; now there was nothing but the smell of old vaults, the dampness of holes in which nothing lives. Vague sounds were dying out, stifled tears, lost oaths; and in the silence which slowly grew heavier one could hear the sleep of hunger coming on, the collapse of bodies thrown across beds in the nightmares of empty bellies."
"On ne s’en alla point ensemble, par prudence. Depuis longtemps, Jeanlin avait disparu. Maheu et la Maheude filèrent de leur côté, obliquant vers Montsou, tandis qu’Étienne se dirigea vers la forêt, où il voulait rejoindre les camarades. En route, il rattrapa une bande de femmes, parmi lesquelles il reconnut la Brûlé et la Levaque : elles mangeaient en marchant des châtaignes que la Mouquette avait apportées, elles en avalaient les pelures pour que ça leur tint davantage à l’estomac. Mais, dans la forêt, il ne trouva personne, les camarades déjà étaient à Jean-Bart. Alors, il prit sa course, il arriva devant la fosse, au moment où Levaque et une centaine d’autres pénétraient sur le carreau. De partout, des mineurs débouchaient, les Maheu par la grande route, les femmes à travers champs, tous débandés, sans chefs, sans armes, coulant naturellement là, ainsi qu’une eau débordée qui suit les pentes. Étienne aperçut Jeanlin, grimpé sur une passerelle, installé comme au spectacle. Il courut plus fort, il entra avec les premiers. On était à peine trois cents.","We did not go away together, out of prudence. Jeanlin had long since disappeared. Maheu and Maheude sped off on their side, turning towards Montsou, while Étienne headed for the forest, where he wanted to rejoin the comrades. On the way, he caught up with a group of women, among whom he recognized La Brûlé and La Levaque: they were eating chestnuts that La Mouquette had brought as they walked, they swallowed the peels to make them more sticky in their stomachs. But, in the forest, he found no one, the comrades were already at Jean-Bart. So he took off, he arrived in front of the pit, at the moment when Levaque and a hundred others entered the floor. Miners were coming from everywhere, the Maheus by the high road, the women across the fields, all disbanded, without leaders, without weapons, flowing naturally there, like an overflowing water which follows the slopes. Étienne saw Jeanlin, climbing on a footbridge, installed as if at the show. He ran harder, he entered with the first. We were barely three hundred.","They thought it wiser not to leave together. Jeanlin was long gone. Maheu and La Maheude went in one direction, heading for Montsou by an indirect route, while Étienne made for the forest, where he expected to join his comrades. On the way he caught up with a party of women, among whom he recognized La Brûlé and La Levaque: as they walked along, they were eating some chestnuts which La Mouquette had brought them, and swallowing the husks so that they stayed down better. But Étienne found no one in the forest, the comrades were already at Jean-Bart. So he started running and reached the pit just as Levaque and a hundred others entered the yard. Miners were straggling in from every direction, the Maheus by the main road, the women from across the fields, all of them unarmed and leaderless, gravitating there naturally like a stream overflowing down a slope. Étienne spotted Jeanlin perched up on a gangway as though he were waiting for the show to begin. He quickened his pace and entered the yard with the leading group. There were barely three hundred of them altogether.","They did not go away together, from motives of prudence. Jeanlin had disappeared long ago. Maheu and Maheude went off on the side sloping towards Montsou; while Étienne turned towards the forest, where he proposed to join his mates. On the way he caught up a band of women among whom he recognized Mother Brulé and the Levaque woman; as they walked they were eating chestnuts which Mouquette had brought; they swallowed the skins so as to feel more in their stomachs. But in the forest he found no one; the men were already at Jean-Bart. He took the same course, and arrived at the pit at the moment when Levaque and some hundreds others were penetrating into the square. Miners were coming up from every direction--the men by the main road, the women by the fields, all at random, without leaders, without weapons, flowing naturally thither like water which runs down a slope. Étienne perceived Jeanlin, who had climbed up on a footbridge, installed as though at a theatre. He ran faster, and entered among the first. There were scarcely three hundred of them."
"La femme de chambre, qui aidait le domestique, crut à un ordre et alla tirer un des rideaux. Ce furent, dès lors, des plaisanteries interminables : on ne posa plus un verre ni une fourchette, sans prendre des précautions ; on salua chaque plat, ainsi qu’une épave échappée à un pillage, dans une ville conquise ; et, derrière cette gaieté forcée, il y avait une sourde peur, qui se trahissait par des coups d’œil involontaires jetés vers la route, comme si une bande de meurt-de-faim eût guetté la table du dehors.","The maid, who was helping the servant, believed an order and went to draw one of the curtains. They were, from then on, endless jokes: no one put down a glass or a fork without taking precautions; every dish was hailed, like a wreck escaped from pillage in a conquered city; and, behind this forced gaiety, there was a dull fear, which betrayed itself by involuntary glances cast towards the road, as if a band of starving people had watched the table outside.","Mme Hennebeau’s maid, who was helping Hippolyte, took this as an order and went to draw one of the curtains. This was the cue for endless jokes as everyone affected extravagant care in setting down their glass or fork, and they all greeted each course as though it had been rescued from looters in a newly conquered city. But beneath the forced merriment lay an unspoken fear, evident from all the involuntary glances towards the road, as if a band of starving ne’er-do-wells were out there spying on their table.","The housemaid, who was helping the footman, treated this as an order and went and closed one of the curtains. This led to interminable jokes: not a glass or a plate could be put down without precaution; every dish was hailed as a waif escaped from the pillage in a conquered town; and behind this forced gaiety there was a certain fear which betrayed itself in involuntary glances towards the road, as though a band of starvelings were watching the table from outside."

"L’après-midi du cinquième jour, Étienne, que la vue de cette femme silencieuse désespérait, quitta la salle et marcha lentement, le long de la rue pavée du coron. L’inaction, qui lui pesait, le poussait à de continuelles promenades, les bras ballants, la tête basse, torturé par la même pensée. Il piétinait ainsi depuis une demi-heure, lorsqu’il sentit, à un redoublement de son malaise, que les camarades se mettaient sur les portes pour le voir. Le peu qui restait de sa popularité s’en était allé au vent de la fusillade, il ne passait plus sans rencontrer des regards dont la flamme le suivait. Quand il leva la tête, des hommes menaçants étaient là, des femmes écartaient les petits rideaux des fenêtres ; et, sous l’accusation muette encore, sous la colère contenue de ces grands yeux, élargis par la faim et les larmes, il devenait maladroit, il ne savait plus marcher. Toujours, derrière lui, le sourd reproche augmentait. Une telle crainte le prit d’entendre le coron entier sortir pour lui crier sa misère, qu’il rentra, frémissant.","On the afternoon of the fifth day, Étienne, despairing at the sight of this silent woman, left the room and walked slowly along the cobbled street of the settlement. The inaction, which weighed on him, drove him to continual walks, his arms dangling, his head bent, tortured by the same thought. He had been treading about like this for half an hour, when he felt, as his uneasiness increased, that the comrades were standing at the doors to see him. The little that remained of his popularity had gone in the wind of the fusillade, he no longer passed without encountering gazes whose flames followed him. When he raised his head, menacing men were there, women were parting the small window curtains; and, under the still mute accusation, under the restrained anger of those large eyes, widened by hunger and tears, he became clumsy, he no longer knew how to walk. Always, behind him, the dull reproach increased. He was seized with such fear at hearing the whole settlement come out to cry out their misery to him, that he returned, shuddering.","On the afternoon of the fifth day, Étienne, thoroughly depressed by the spectacle of this silent woman, left the parlour and walked slowly down the cobbled street through the village. The inactivity was difficult to bear and had prompted him to take endless walks, with his arms by his side, head down, always tormented by the one single thought. He had been trudging along like this for half an hour when he became aware, from an increase in his own sense of discomfort, that the comrades were coming out on to their doorsteps to watch him. What little popularity he still enjoyed had vanished with the first rifle shot, and now wherever he went he was met with blazing eyes that burned into his back as he passed. Each time he looked up, he saw men standing with a menacing air, or women peering from behind their curtains; and, confronted by their as yet unvoiced accusations and the suppressed anger evident in these staring eyes that were widened still further by hunger and tears, he became so ill at ease that he could scarcely walk. And behind him the mute reproach continued to intensify. He was so afraid that the entire village might appear on their doorsteps and scream their wretchedness at him that he returned home shaking.","On the afternoon of the fifth day, Étienne, made miserable by the sight of this silent woman, left the room, and walked slowly along the paved street of the settlement. The inaction which weighed on him impelled him to take constant walks, with arms swinging idly and lowered head, always tortured by the same thought. He tramped thus for half an hour, when he felt, by an increase in his discomfort, that his mates were coming to their doors to look at him. His little remaining popularity had been driven to the winds by that fusillade, and he never passed now without meeting fiery looks which pursued him. When he raised his head there were threatening men there, women drawing aside the curtains from their windows; and beneath this still silent accusation and the restrained anger of these eyes, enlarged by hunger and tears, he became awkward and could scarcely walk straight. These dumb reproaches seemed to be always increasing behind him. He became so terrified, lest he should hear the entire settlement come out to shout its wretchedness at him, that he returned shuddering."
"Elle le regardait, elle recommençait à sourire dans ses larmes. Peut-être qu’il avait raison, on n’en rencontrait guère, des femmes heureuses.

"Étienne n’avait eu que le temps de parer le premier coup avec son bras. La laine du tricot fut coupée par l’épaisse lame, une de ces lames qu’une virole de cuivre fixe dans un manche de buis. Déjà, il avait saisi le poignet de Chaval, une lutte effrayante s’engagea, lui se sentant perdu s’il lâchait, l’autre donnant des secousses, pour se dégager et frapper. L’arme s’abaissait peu à peu, leurs membres raidis se fatiguaient, deux fois Étienne eut la sensation froide de l’acier contre sa peau ; et il dut faire un effort suprême, il broya le poignet dans une telle étreinte, que le couteau glissa de la main ouverte. Tous deux s’étaient jetés par terre, ce fut lui qui le ramassa, qui le brandit à son tour. Il tenait Chaval renversé sous son genou, il menaçait de lui ouvrir la gorge.","Étienne had barely had time to parry the first blow with his arm. The wool of the knitting was cut by the thick blade, one of those blades which a copper ferrule fixes in a boxwood handle. Already he had grabbed Chaval's wrist, a frightening struggle ensued, he feeling lost if he let go, the other twitching to free himself and strike. The weapon was lowered little by little, their stiffened limbs were getting tired, twice Étienne felt the cold sensation of steel against his skin; and he had to make a supreme effort, he crushed the wrist in such a grip, that the knife slipped from the open hand. Both had thrown themselves on the ground, it was he who picked it up, who brandished it in his turn. He held Chaval bent under his knee, he threatened to slit his throat.","Étienne had only just had time to ward off the first thrust with his arm. His woollen jersey was cut by the thick blade, one of those blades that are attached to a boxwood handle by a copper ferrule. Already he had grabbed hold of Chaval’s wrist, and a fierce struggle ensued, with Étienne thinking that he would be lost if he let go, and his opponent jerking his arm away repeatedly in order to break free and strike again. Slowly the weapon was coming lower and lower, their straining limbs were beginning to give out, and twice Étienne felt the cold touch of steel against his skin; but with one last, supreme effort he squeezed Chaval’s wrist so hard that the knife fell from his open hand. Both men flung themselves to the ground at once, and it was Étienne who reached it first and now brandished it in his turn. He had Chaval pinned to the floor beneath his knee, and he was threatening to slit his throat.","Étienne had only time to parry the first blow with his arm.

Both of them had fallen to the earth, and it was Étienne who snatched it up, brandishing it in his turn. He held Chaval down beneath his knee and threatened to slit his throat open."
"Cette fois, Zacharie éclata. Les amours du maître porion et de la Pierronne étaient la continuelle plaisanterie de la fosse. Catherine elle-même, appuyée sur sa pelle, en bas de la taille, se tint les côtes et mit d’une phrase Étienne au courant ; tandis que Maheu se fâchait, pris d’une peur qu’il ne cachait plus.","This time Zacharie burst out. The loves of the foreman and Pierronne were the continual joke of the pit. Catherine herself, leaning on her shovel below the waist, held her sides and told Étienne with a word; while Maheu grew angry, seized with a fear he no longer concealed.","This had Zacharie in fits. The overman’s affair with Pierron’s wife was a standing joke throughout the pit. Even Catherine, leaning on her shovel at the foot of the coal-face, was shaking with laughter as she briefly put Étienne in the picture. Maheu, meanwhile, was getting angry and no longer sought to conceal his anxieties:","This time Zacharie burst out laughing. The head captain's love for Pierronne was a constant joke in the pit. Even Catherine rested on her shovel at the bottom of the cutting, holding her sides, and in a few words told Étienne the joke; while Maheu became angry, seized by a fear which he could not conceal."
"Dansaert, cependant, tâchait de mettre de l’ordre. Armé d’une rivelaine, il menaçait d’ouvrir le crâne au premier qui n’obéirait pas ; et il voulait les ranger à la file, il criait que les chargeurs sortiraient les derniers, après avoir emballé les camarades. On ne l’écoutait pas, il avait empêché Pierron, lâche et blême, de filer un des premiers. À chaque départ, il devait l’écarter d’une gifle. Mais lui-même claquait des dents, une minute de plus, et il était englouti : tout crevait là-haut, c’était un fleuve débordé, une pluie meurtrière de charpentes. Quelques ouvriers accouraient encore, lorsque, fou de peur, il sauta dans une berline, en laissant Pierron y sauter derrière lui. La cage monta.","Dansaert, however, was trying to put things in order. Armed with a rivelaine, he threatened to open the skull of the first who did not obey; and he wanted to line them up, he shouted that the loaders would come out last, after packing up the comrades. No one listened to him, he had prevented Pierron, cowardly and pale, from following one of the first. Each time he left, he had to slap her away. But he himself chattered his teeth, a minute longer, and he was engulfed: everything was bursting up there, it was an overflowing river, a murderous rain of framework. A few workmen were still running when, maddened with fear, he jumped into a carriage, leaving Pierron to jump in behind him. The cage went up.","Dansaert, meanwhile, was trying to restore order. Armed with a pick, he was threatening to smash the skull of the first man who disobeyed him; and he endeavoured to get everyone to form a queue, shouting out that the onsetters would be the last to leave once they had seen their comrades safely away. Nobody was listening to him, indeed he had just stopped a pale and frightened Pierron from being one of the first to make his escape. Each time the cage left he had to strike him to make him stand back. But his own teeth were chattering; a minute longer, and they’d all be buried alive: everything was giving way up there, it was as though a river had burst its banks, and bits of tubbing were raining down murderously on those below. A few miners were still left when, crazed with fear, he jumped into a tub and let Pierron jump in behind him. The cage rose.","Dansaert, however, was trying to arrange matters in an orderly manner. Armed with a pick he threatened to open the skull of the first man who refused to obey; and he tried to arrange them in file, shouting that the porters were to go up last after having sent up their mates. He was not listened to, and he had to prevent the pale and cowardly Pierron from entering among the first. At each departure he pushed him aside with a blow.

"Dehors, on parla de marcher sur Saint-Thomas. Cette fosse était la mieux disciplinée, la grève ne l’avait pas atteinte, près de sept cents hommes devaient y être descendus ; et cela exaspérait, on les attendrait à coups de trique, en bataille rangée, pour voir un peu qui resterait par terre. Mais la rumeur courut qu’il y avait des gendarmes à Saint-Thomas, les gendarmes du matin, dont on s’était moqué. Comment le savait-on ? personne ne pouvait le dire. N’importe ! la peur les prenait, ils se décidèrent pour Feutry-Cantel. Et le vertige les remporta, tous se retrouvèrent sur la route, claquant des sabots, se ruant : à Feutry-Cantel ! à Feutry-Cantel ! les lâches y étaient bien encore quatre cents, on allait rire ! Située à trois kilomètres, la fosse se cachait dans un pli de terrain, près de la Scarpe. Déjà, l’on montait la pente des Plâtrières, au-delà du chemin de Beaugnies, lorsqu’une voix, demeurée inconnue, lança l’idée que les dragons étaient peut-être là-bas, à Feutry-Cantel. Alors, d’un bout à l’autre de la colonne, on répéta que les dragons y étaient. Une hésitation ralentit la marche, la panique peu à peu soufflait, dans ce pays endormi par le chômage, qu’ils battaient depuis des heures. Pourquoi n’avaient-ils pas buté contre des soldats ? Cette impunité les troublait, à la pensée de la répression qu’ils sentaient venir.","Outside, there was talk of marching on Saint-Thomas. This pit was the best disciplined, the strike had not reached it, nearly seven hundred men were to have descended there; and that exasperated, we would wait for them with cudgels, in pitched battle, to see who would be left on the ground. But the rumor ran that there were gendarmes in Saint-Thomas, the morning gendarmes, who had been made fun of. How did we know? no one could tell. Anything ! Fear seized them, they decided on Feutry-Cantel. And dizziness won them over, they all found themselves on the road, clicking their hooves, rushing: to Feutry-Cantel! in Feutry-Cantel! the cowards were there still four hundred, we were going to laugh! Located three kilometers away, the pit was hidden in a bend in the ground, near the Scarpe. We were already climbing the slope of Les Plâtrières, beyond the chemin de Beaugnies, when a voice, which remained unknown, suggested that the dragons were perhaps there, in Feutry-Cantel. Then, from one end of the column to the other, it was repeated that the dragoons were there. A hesitation slowed down the march, panic was blowing little by little, in this country asleep by unemployment, which they had been beating for hours. Why hadn't they come up against soldiers? This impunity troubled them, thinking of the repression they felt was coming.","Outside there was talk of marching on Saint-Thomas. As the pit with the most docile workforce, it had been unaffected by the strike, and nearly seven hundred men must be underground, which infuriated them. They would wait for them with cudgels, in battle formation, and then they’d see who left the field victorious! But word went round that there were gendarmes at Saint-Thomas, the very gendarmes they’d made fun of that morning. Yet how did anyone actually know that? It was impossible to say. No matter! They lost their nerve and opted for Feutry-Cantel instead. The thrill of the chase took hold of them once more as they found themselves rushing along the road to the sound of their clattering clogs: To Feutry-Cantel! To Feutry-Cantel! There were a good four hundred spineless bastards there, what a laugh! Situated some three kilometres away, the mine was hidden in a dip near La Scarpe. They were already climbing the hillside at Les Plâtrières, beyond the road to Beaugnies, when somebody or other – they never discovered who – started a rumour that maybe the dragoons were at Feutry-Cantel. This was then repeated from from one end of the column to the other: the dragoons were there. They faltered and slowed their pace; and, after all these hours spent careering round a countryside that seemed to have fallen asleep from the torpor of having so many people out of work, there was a wave of panic. Why hadn’t they come across any soldiers? It worried them that they had got away with it so far, for they could sense the repression to come.","Outside they were talking of marching on Saint-Thomas. This was the best disciplined pit. The strike had not touched it, nearly seven hundred men must have gone down there. This exasperated them; they would wait for these men with sticks, ranged for battle, just to see who would get the best of it. But the rumour ran along that there were gendarmes at Saint-Thomas, the gendarmes of the morning whom they had made fun of. How was this known? nobody could say. No matter! they were seized by fear and decided on Feutry-Cantel. Their giddiness carried them on, all were on the road, clanking their sabots, rushing forward. To Feutry-Cantel! to Feutry-Cantel! The cowards there were certainly four hundred in number and there would be fun! Situated three kilometres away, this pit lay in a fold of the ground near the Scarpe. They were already climbing the slope of the Platriéres, beyond the road to Beaugnies, when a voice, no one knew from whom, threw out the idea that the soldiers were, perhaps, down there at Feutry-Cantel. Then from one to the other of the column it was repeated that the soldiers were down there. They slackened their march, panic gradually spread in the country, idle without work, which they had been scouring for hours. Why had they not come across any soldiers? This impunity troubled them, at the thought of the repression which they felt to be coming."

"On évita Montsou, on retomba plus haut dans la route de Joiselle ; et, pour s’épargner le détour de la Fourche-aux-Bœufs, on passa sous les murs de la Piolaine. Les Grégoire, précisément, venaient d’en sortir, ayant à rendre une visite au notaire, avant d’aller dîner chez les Hennebeau, où ils devaient retrouver Cécile. La propriété semblait dormir, avec son avenue de tilleuls déserte, son potager et son verger dénudés par l’hiver. Rien ne bougeait dans la maison, dont les fenêtres closes se ternissaient de la chaude buée intérieure ; et, du profond silence, sortait une impression de bonhomie et de bien-être, la sensation patriarcale des bons lits et de la bonne table, du bonheur sage, où coulait l’existence des propriétaires.","We avoided Montsou, we fell further up the road to Joiselle; and, to avoid the detour of the Fourche-aux-Bœufs, we passed under the walls of the Piolaine. The Grégoires had just come out of it, having to pay a visit to the notary before going to dine with the Hennebeaus, where they were to meet Cécile. The property seemed to sleep, with its deserted avenue of lime trees, its vegetable garden and its orchard bare by winter. Nothing stirred in the house, the closed windows of which were dulled by the warm mist inside; and out of the deep silence came an impression of good-naturedness and well-being, the patriarchal sensation of good beds and good food, of wise happiness, in which the existence of the owners flowed.","They avoided Montsou by joining the Joiselle road higher up, and in order to save having to go round by La Fourche-aux-Bœufs they came past the walls of La Piolaine. By chance the Grégoires had just left, meaning to visit a notary before going on to dine at the Hennebeaus’, where they were to collect Cécile. The place seemed sunk in slumber, with its deserted avenue of limes, and its orchard and kitchen-garden both stripped bare by winter. Nothing stirred in the house, and the closed windows were steamed up with the warmth inside: the deep silence exuded a sense of well-being and good cheer, a patriarchal aura of comfortable beds and good food, all bespeaking the well-regulated happiness in which its owners lived out their lives.","They avoided Montsou, and farther on rejoined the Joiselle road; to spare the journey round Fourche-aux-Boeufs, they passed beneath the walls of Piolaine.

The estate seemed asleep, with its avenue of deserted limes, its kitchen garden and its orchard bared by the winter.

Étienne found himself clinking glasses with Catherine, and they all drank together, the father, the daughter and her lover, the son and his mistress, all politely saying: ‘Cheers everyone!’ Then Pierron insisted on buying his round, and everyone seemed to be on the best of terms when Zacharie flew into a rage again on catching sight of his friend Mouquet. He shouted to him to come and help him sort that nailer out, as he put it.","Maheu now arrived with his party, and quieted Catherine and Philoméne who were in tears. The nail-maker had disappeared, and there was laughter in the crowd. To bring the episode to an end, Chaval, who was at home at the Estaminet Piquette, called for drinks. Étienne had touched glasses with Catherine, and all drank together--the father, the daughter and her lover, the son and his mistress--saying politely: "" To your good health!"" Pierron afterwards persisted in paying for more drinks. And they were all in good humour, when Zacharie grew wild again at the sight of his comrade Mouquet, and called him, as he said, to go and finish his affair with the nail-maker."

"Devant le buffet ouvert, Catherine réfléchissait. Il ne restait qu’un bout de pain, du fromage blanc en suffisance, mais à peine une lichette de beurre ; et il s’agissait de faire les tartines pour eux quatre. Enfin, elle se décida, coupa les tranches, en prit une qu’elle couvrit de fromage, en frotta une autre de beurre, puis les colla ensemble : c’était le « briquet », la double tartine emportée chaque matin à la fosse. Bientôt, les quatre briquets furent en rang sur la table, répartis avec une sévère justice, depuis le gros du père jusqu’au petit de Jeanlin.","In front of the open sideboard, Catherine reflected. There was only a piece of bread left, enough cottage cheese, but barely a lick of butter; and it was a matter of making toast for the four of them. Finally, she made up her mind, cut the slices, took one, covered it with cheese, rubbed another with butter, then glued them together: it was the ""briquet"", the double sandwich taken to the pit every morning. Soon the four lighters were in a row on the table, distributed with severe justice, from the big one for the father to the little one for Jeanlin.","In front of the open dresser Catherine was pondering. All that was left was the remains of a loaf, plenty of cottage cheese and a mere sliver of butter; and it was her job to produce sandwiches for all four of them. Having eventually made up her mind, she sliced the bread, covered one slice with cheese and smeared another with butter and then pressed them together: this was their ‘piece’,8 the double slice of bread and butter that they took with them to the mine each morning. Soon the four ‘pieces’ were lined up on the table, the size of each having been gradated with rigorous fairness, from the thick one for Maheu down to the small one for Jeanlin.","Catherine, in front of the sideboard, was reflecting. There only remained the end of a loaf, cheese in fair abundance, but hardly a morsel of butter; and she had to provide bread and butter for four. At last she decided, cut the slices, took one and covered it with cheese, spread another with butter, and stuck them together; that was the ""briquet,"" the bread-and-butter sandwich taken to the pit every morning. The four briquets were soon on the table, in a row, cut with severe justice, from the big one for the father down to the little one for Jeanlin."

Une salade accompagnerait si bien la ratatouille qu’elle laissait mijoter sur le feu, des pommes de terre, des poireaux, de l’oseille, fricassés avec de l’oignon frit !

What could that little rascal possibly be picking at this hour when it was pitch dark! A salad would go so well with the vegetable stew she had simmering on the stove, a mixture of potatoes, leeks and sorrel chopped up and then cooked with fried onion!

Its foul odour penetrates the brickwork of the miners’ houses to such an extent that the strong stench of this pauper cuisine announces their existence from far off in the countryside.","Twilight suddenly came on; Maheude lit the lamp, irritated because neither her daughter nor the boys had come back.

"Et ils montèrent ensemble.

Et, au milieu du silence lourd, de l’écrasement des couches profondes, on aurait pu, l’oreille collée à la roche, entendre le branle de ces insectes humains en marche, depuis le vol du câble qui montait et descendait la cage d’extraction, jusqu’à la morsure des outils entamant la houille, au fond des chantiers d’abattage.","The two men exchanged a look, kindled by one of those instinctive hatreds which flare up suddenly.

The devouring well had swallowed its daily ration of men, nearly seven hundred workmen, who at this hour were toiling in this giant anthill, piercing the earth on all sides, sifting it like an old wood pitted with worms. And, in the middle of the heavy silence, of the crushing of the deep layers, one could have, with one's ear glued to the rock, heard the movement of these human insects on the move, from the flight of the cable which went up and down the cage of extraction, until the bite of the tools cutting into the coal, at the bottom of the working sites.","’1 The two men exchanged a look, their eyes blazing with the kind of instinctive hatred that flares in an instant.

The gluttonous pit had swallowed its daily ration of men, nearly seven hundred miners who were now at work inside this giant anthill, all burrowing into the earth and riddling it with holes, like an old piece of wood being eaten away by woodworm. And in the heavy silence created by the crushing mass of earth it was possible to put an ear to the rock and hear the teeming activity of human insects on the march, from the whirr of the cables rising and falling as the cages took the coal to the surface to the grinding of tools as they bit into the seam deep within each working.","The two men exchanged, a look, lighted up by one of those instinctive hatreds which suddenly flame up.

"Étienne, descendu enfin du terrier venait d’entrer au Voreux ; et les hommes auxquels il s’adressait, demandant s’il y avait du travail, hochaient la tête, lui disaient tous d’attendre le maître porion. On le laissait libre, au milieu des bâtiments mal éclairés, pleins de trous noirs, inquiétants avec la complication de leurs salles et de leurs étages. Après avoir monté un escalier obscur à moitié détruit, il s’était trouvé sur une passerelle branlante, puis avait traversé le hangar du criblage, plongé dans une nuit si profonde, qu’il marchait les mains en avant, pour ne pas se heurter.

Having climbed a dark, half-derelict staircase he had found himself on a rickety overhead gangway and then made his way across the screening-shed where it was so completely dark that he had to stretch out his arms in order to avoid bumping into anything. Suddenly, right in front of him, two enormous yellow eyes appeared, like holes in the blackness. He was now standing under the headgear, at the very mouth of the mine-shaft, where the coal was unloaded after it had been brought up.","ÉTIENNE had at last descended from the platform and entered the Voreux; he spoke to men whom he met, asking if there was work to be had, but all shook their heads, telling him to wait for the captain.

Incensed by the row, La Maheude, too, was about to leave when a moan from Alzire detained her. She pulled the ends of the blanket over the little girl’s shivering body and resumed her position by the window, where she gazed blankly into the distance. Still the doctor didn’t come!","He was carried out of himself, and the Levaques followed him to see what would happen, while Bouteloup, having a horror of disputes, furtively returned home.

"Lui et son compagnon s’étaient assis. Absorbés, la tête basse, tandis que le défilé continuait en face du papier jaune, ils calculaient. Est-ce qu’on se fichait d’eux ! jamais ils ne rattraperaient, avec le boisage, les dix centimes diminués sur la berline. Au plus toucheraient-ils huit centimes, et c’était deux centimes que leur volait la Compagnie, sans compter le temps qu’un travail soigné leur prendrait. Voilà donc où elle voulait en venir, à cette baisse de salaire déguisée ! Elle réalisait des économies dans la poche de ses mineurs.","He and his companion were seated. Absorbed, heads bent, as the procession continued in front of the yellow paper, they calculated. Did we care about them! they would never make up, with the woodwork, the ten centimes diminished on the saloon. At most they would get eight centimes, and the Company was stealing two centimes from them, not counting the time that careful work would take them. So that's where she was coming from, this disguised drop in salary! She was making savings in the pockets of her miners.","He and Étienne had sat down. Gazing at the floor, deep in thought, they did the sums in their heads, as people continued to file past the yellow notice. What did the Company take them for? The timbering would never allow them to recoup the ten centimes lost on each tub. They’d make eight at most, so the Company was robbing them of two centimes, not to mention the time it would take them to make a proper job of the timbering. So that’s what they were up to, a disguised reduction in pay. The Company was saving money by taking it from the miners’ pockets.","He and his companions sat down absorbed, with lowered heads, and while files of men continued to pass before the yellow paper they made calculations. Were they being made fun of? They could never make up with the timbering for the ten centimes taken off the tram. At most they could only get to eight centimes, so the Company would be robbing them of two centimes, without counting the time taken by careful work. This, then, was what this disguised lowering of wages really came to. The Company was economizing out of the miners' pockets."

"Il recommença, il parla du déplorable malentendu entre l’Église et le peuple. Maintenant, en phrases voilées, il frappait sur les curés des villes, sur les évêques, sur le haut clergé, repu de jouissance, gorgé de domination, pactisant avec la bourgeoisie libérale, dans l’imbécillité de son aveuglement, sans voir que c’était cette bourgeoisie qui le dépossédait de l’empire du monde. La délivrance viendrait des prêtres de campagne, tous se lèveraient pour rétablir le royaume du Christ, avec l’aide des misérables ; et il semblait être déjà à leur tête, il redressait sa taille osseuse, en chef de bande, en révolutionnaire de l’Évangile, les yeux emplis d’une telle lumière, qu’ils éclairaient la salle obscure. Cette ardente prédication l’emportait en paroles mystiques, depuis longtemps les pauvres gens ne le comprenaient plus.","He began again, he spoke of the deplorable misunderstanding between the Church and the people.

Deliverance would come from the country priests, all would rise to restore the kingdom of Christ, with the help of the poor; and he seemed to be already at their head, he straightened his bony figure, like a band leader, like a revolutionary of the Gospel, his eyes filled with such light that they lighted up the dark room. This ardent preaching prevailed in mystical words, for a long time the poor people no longer understood it.","He continued, turning now to the deplorable rift that had occurred between the Church and the people.

Deliverance would come at the hands of the country priests, who would rise up as one to restore the kingdom of Christ, with the aid of the poor. And it was as though he were already at their head as he drew himself up to the full height of his bony frame, a leader of men, a Gospel revolutionary, his eyes filled with such a blazing light that they lit up the dark room.

"En face de lui, la Maheude n’avait pas remué. Elle eut un grand geste, et un silence se fit, pénible et lourd des choses qu’ils ne disaient pas. Malgré son effort, il revenait quand même à sa gorge, à cette coulée de chair blanche, dont l’éclat maintenant le gênait. Sans doute, elle avait quarante ans et elle était déformée, comme une bonne femelle qui produisait trop ; mais beaucoup la désiraient encore, large, solide, avec sa grosse figure longue d’ancienne belle fille. Lentement, d’un air tranquille, elle avait pris à deux mains sa mamelle et la rentrait. Un coin rose s’obstinait, elle le renfonça du doigt, puis se boutonna, toute noire à présent, avachie dans son vieux caraco.","Opposite him Maheude had not stirred. She gestured, and there was a silence, painful and heavy with the things they weren't saying. Despite his effort, he still came back to his throat, to that cast of white flesh, the brilliance of which now bothered him. No doubt she was forty years old and deformed, like a good female who produced too much; but many still wanted her, broad, solid, with her big long face of a former beautiful girl. Slowly, with a calm air, she had taken her udder in both hands and was drawing it in. A pink corner persisted, she pushed it back with her finger, then buttoned up, all black now, slumped in her old camisole.","Opposite him, La Maheude had still not moved. She waved her hand dismissively, and an awkward silence followed, heavy with their unspoken thoughts. Étienne could not keep his eyes off her breast, and its lava-flow of white flesh disturbed him with its dazzling brightness. Yes, she was forty and her figure had gone – every bit the trusty female who has had too many children – but many a man still desired her broad, solid frame and the long, full face that had once been beautiful. Slowly and calmly she had grasped her breast with both hands and replaced it under her blouse. A corner of pink flesh refused to disappear, so she pressed it back with her finger and buttoned herself up. And she became once more the frump in her old, loose-fitting jacket, dressed in black from head to foot.","Maheude, in front of him, had not stirred. She made a vague gesture, and there was silence, a silence which was painful and heavy with unspoken things. In spite of an effort his gaze again returned to her breast, that expanse of white flesh, the brilliance of which now made him uncomfortable. No doubt she was forty, and had lost her shape, like a good female who had produced too much; but many would still desire her, strong and solid, with the large long face of a woman who had once been beautiful. Slowly and quietly she was putting back her breast with both hands. A rosy corner was still obstinate, and she pushed it back with her finger, and then buttoned herself up, and was now quite black and shapeless in her old gown."
"Des voix approuvèrent, le bruit reprenait, au milieu de gestes violents. Peu à peu, tous se rapprochaient en un cercle étroit.","Voices approved, the noise resumed, in the midst of violent gestures. Little by little, everyone was getting closer in a tight circle.","Various voices expressed their support, and the noise level rose again, accompanied by violent gestures. Gradually everyone gathered round in a tight semicircle.","Voices approved, and the noise began again in the midst of violent gesticulation. Gradually they drew near, forming a small circle."

"Étienne, maintenant, en était à Darwin. Il en avait lu des fragments, résumés et vulgarisés dans un volume à cinq sous ; et, de cette lecture mal comprise, il se faisait une idée révolutionnaire du combat pour l’existence, les maigres mangeant les gras, le peuple fort dévorant la blême bourgeoisie. Mais Souvarine s’emporta, se répandit sur la bêtise des socialistes qui acceptent Darwin, cet apôtre de l’inégalité scientifique, dont la fameuse sélection n’était bonne que pour des philosophes aristocrates. Cependant, le camarade s’entêtait, voulait raisonner, et il exprimait ses doutes par une hypothèse : la vieille société n’existait plus, on en avait balayé jusqu’aux miettes ; eh bien, n’était-il pas à craindre que le monde nouveau ne repoussât gâté lentement des mêmes injustices, les uns malades et les autres gaillards, les uns plus adroits, plus intelligents, s’engraissant de tout, et les autres imbéciles et paresseux, redevenant des esclaves ? Alors, devant cette vision de l’éternelle misère, le machineur cria d’une voix farouche que, si la justice n’était pas possible avec l’homme, il fallait que l’homme disparût. Autant de sociétés pourries, autant de massacres, jusqu’à l’extermination du dernier être. Et le silence retomba.","Étienne was now at Darwin. He had read fragments of it, summarized and vulgarized in a volume at five cents; and, from this misunderstood reading, he formed a revolutionary idea of the struggle for existence, the thin eating the fat, the strong people devouring the pale bourgeoisie. But Souvarine got carried away, ranting about the stupidity of the socialists who accept Darwin, this apostle of scientific inequality, whose famous selection was good only for aristocratic philosophers. However, the comrade was stubborn, wanted to reason, and he expressed his doubts by a hypothesis: the old society no longer existed, it had been swept away to the crumbs; well, was it not to be feared that the new world would grow back, slowly spoiled by the same injustices, some sick and others sprightly, some more skilful, more intelligent, fattening on everything, and others imbeciles and lazy, becoming slaves again? Then, faced with this vision of eternal misery, the engineer shouted in a fierce voice that, if justice was not possible with man, man had to disappear. So many rotten societies, so many massacres, until the extermination of the last being. And silence fell.","Étienne had now got as far as Darwin.1 He had read this and that, as summarized for a popular audience in a volume costing five sous; and on the basis of his patchy understanding he had come to see revolution in terms of the struggle for survival, with the have-nots eating the haves, a strong people devouring a worn-out bourgeoisie. But Souvarine became angry and started in on the stupidity of socialists who accepted Darwin, that scientific apostle of inequality whose great notion of natural selection might as well be the philosophy of an aristocrat. But Étienne refused to be persuaded and wanted to argue the point, illustrating his reservations with a hypothesis. Say the old society no longer existed and that every last trace of it had been swept away. Wasn’t there a risk that the new order which grew up in its place would slowly be corrupted by the same injustices, that there would again be the weak and the strong, that some people would be more skilful or intelligent than others and live off the fat of the land, while the stupid or lazy once more became their slaves? At this prospect of everlasting poverty Souvarine exclaimed fiercely that if justice could not be achieved with man, it would have to be achieved without him. For as long as there were rotten societies, there would have to be wholesale slaughters, until the last human being had been exterminated. The two men fell silent again.","Étienne was now studying Darwin. He had read fragments, summarized and popularized in a five-sou volume; and out of this ill-understood reading he had gained for himself a revolutionary idea of the struggle for existence, the lean eating the fat, the strong people devouring the pallid middle class. But Souvarine furiously attacked the stupidity of the Socialists who accept Darwin, that apostle of scientific inequality, whose famous selection was only good for aristocratic philosophers. His mate persisted, however, wishing to reason out the matter, and expressing his doubts by an hypothesis: supposing the old society were no longer to exist, swept away to the crumbs; well, was it not to be feared that the new world would grow up again, slowly spoilt by the same injustices, some sick and others flourishing, some more skilful and intelligent, fattening on everything, and others imbecile and lazy. becoming slaves again? But before this vision of eternal wretchedness, the engine-man shouted out fiercely that if justice was not possible with man, then man must disappear. For every rotten society there must be a massacre, until the last creature was exterminated. And there was silence again."
"Et, au bout du premier mois, Étienne et Catherine semblaient déjà ne plus se voir, quand, le soir, avant d’éteindre la chandelle, ils voyageaient déshabillés par la chambre. Elle avait cessé de se hâter, elle reprenait son habitude ancienne de nouer ses cheveux au bord de son lit, les bras en l’air, remontant sa chemise jusqu’à ses cuisses ; et lui, sans pantalon, l’aidait parfois, cherchait les épingles qu’elle perdait. L’habitude tuait la honte d’être nu, ils trouvaient naturel d’être ainsi, car ils ne faisaient point de mal et ce n’était pas leur faute, s’il n’y avait qu’une chambre pour tant de monde. Des troubles cependant leur revenaient, tout d’un coup, aux moments où ils ne songeaient à rien de coupable. Après ne plus avoir vu la pâleur de son corps pendant des soirées, il la revoyait brusquement toute blanche, de cette blancheur qui le secouait d’un frisson, qui l’obligeait à se détourner, par crainte de céder à l’envie de la prendre. Elle, d’autres soirs, sans raison apparente, tombait dans un émoi pudique, fuyait, se coulait entre les draps, comme si elle avait senti les mains de ce garçon la saisir. Puis, la chandelle éteinte, ils comprenaient qu’ils ne s’endormaient pas, qu’ils songeaient l’un à l’autre, malgré leur fatigue. Cela les laissait inquiets et boudeurs tout le lendemain, car ils préféraient les soirs de tranquillité, où ils se mettaient à l’aise, en camarades.","And, at the end of the first month, Étienne and Catherine already seemed to no longer see each other when, in the evening, before putting out the candle, they walked around the room undressed. She had ceased to hurry, she resumed her old habit of tying her hair at the edge of her bed, her arms in the air, pulling her shirt up to her thighs; and he, without trousers, sometimes helped her, looked for the pins she lost. Habit killed the shame of being naked, they found it natural to be like that, because they did no harm and it was not their fault, if there was only one room for so many people. . Disorders, however, suddenly returned to them, at times when they were not thinking of anything culpable. After not having seen the pallor of her body for evenings, he suddenly saw her again completely white, with this whiteness which shook him with a shiver, which forced him to turn away, for fear of yielding to the desire of the take. She, on other evenings, for no apparent reason, fell into a modest turmoil, fled, slipped between the sheets, as if she had felt the boy's hands seize her. Then, the candle extinguished, they understood that they were not falling asleep, that they were thinking of each other, despite their fatigue. This left them restless and sulky all the next day, for they preferred quiet evenings, when they made themselves comfortable, as comrades.","And so by the end of the first month it was as though Étienne and Catherine had ceased to notice each other, as they wandered about at bedtime in a state of undress before putting out the candle. She no longer hurried as she took off her clothes, and she had resumed her old practice of sitting on the edge of the bed while she put her hair up, causing her nightdress to ride up her thighs as she stretched her arms above her head; and sometimes, even with no trousers on, he would help her look for lost hairpins. Habit overcame the shame of their nakedness; it felt quite natural to them, for after all they meant no harm by it, and it wasn’t their fault if there was only one room for so many people. Yet there were moments when they would suddenly find it disturbing, and this when they were not even thinking improper thoughts. Having taken no notice of her pale skin for several nights, he would suddenly see her again in all her whiteness, that whiteness which made him tremble and turn away, for fear he might yield to his desire to take her. On other occasions, and for no apparent reason, she would suddenly feel coy and start avoiding him, sliding quickly under the sheets as if she had felt the young man’s hands take hold of her. Then, when the candle was out, they would know that neither of them was able to sleep and that they were thinking of each other, despite their exhaustion. And that left them feeling irritable and out of sorts the next day, because they much preferred the quiet evenings when they could relax together and be just good friends.","At the end of the first month, Étienne and Catherine seemed no longer to see each other when in the evening, before extinguishing the candle, they moved about the room, undressed. She had ceased to hasten, and resumed her old custom of doing up her hair at the edge of her bed, while her arms, raised in the air, lifted her chemise to her thighs, and he, without his trousers, sometimes helped her, looking for the hairpins that she had lost. Custom killed the shame of being naked; they found it natural to be like this, for they were doing no harm, and it was not their fault if there was only one room for so many people. Sometimes, however, a trouble came over them suddenly, at moments when they had no guilty thought. After some nights when he had not seen her pale body, he suddenly saw her white all over, with a whiteness which shook him with a shiver, which obliged him to turn away for fear of yielding to the desire to take her. On other evenings, without any apparent reason, she would be overcome by a panic of modesty and hasten to slip between the sheets as if she felt the hands of this lad seizing her. Then, when the candle was out, they both knew that they were not sleeping but were thinking of each other in spite of their weariness. This made them restless and sulky all the following day; they liked best the tranquil evenings when they could behave together like comrades."

"C’était à sept cent huit mètres, au nord, dans la première voie de la veine Désirée, que trois kilomètres séparaient de l’accrochage. Lorsqu’ils parlaient de cette région de la fosse, les mineurs du pays pâlissaient et baissaient la voix, comme s’ils avaient parlé de l’enfer ; et ils se contentaient le plus souvent de hocher la tête, en hommes qui préféraient ne point causer de ces profondeurs de braise ardente. À mesure que les galeries s’enfonçaient vers le nord, elles se rapprochaient du Tartaret, elles pénétraient dans l’incendie intérieur, qui, là-haut, calcinait les roches. Les tailles, au point où l’on en était arrivé, avaient une température moyenne de quarante-cinq degrés. On s’y trouvait en pleine cité maudite, au milieu des flammes que les passants de la plaine voyaient par les fissures, crachant du soufre et des vapeurs abominables.","It was seven hundred and eight meters to the north, in the first lane of the Désirée vein, which three kilometers separated from the collision. When they spoke of this region of the pit, the miners of the country paled and lowered their voices, as if they had spoken of hell; and most of the time they contented themselves with shaking their heads, like men who preferred not to talk about these depths of burning embers. As the galleries sank towards the north, they approached Tartaret, they penetrated into the interior fire, which, up there, calcined the rocks. The cuts, at the point we had reached, had an average temperature of forty-five degrees. We were there in the middle of the accursed city, in the midst of the flames that passers-by on the plain could see through the cracks, spitting sulfur and abominable vapors.","They were at a depth of seven hundred and eight metres, in the first road of the Désirée seam, about three kilometres away from pit-bottom. Whenever this part of the mine was mentioned, the local miners would turn pale and lower their voices, as if they were talking about hell itself; and more often than not they merely shook their heads in the way of people who didn’t want to discuss this deep, remote place where the coal burned red and fierce. As they extended northwards, the roadways drew closer to Le Tartaret and entered the area of the underground fire that had turned the rock overhead a dark red. At the point to which they had now dug, the average temperature at the coal-face was some forty-five degrees. They were right in the middle of the accursed city of the plain and in among those flames that passers-by up on the surface could see through the cracks, spitting out sulphur and foul-smelling gases.","They were seven hundred and eight metres to the north in the first passage of the Désirée seam, which was at a distance of three kilometres from the pit-eye. When they spoke of this part of the pit, the miners of the region grew pale, and lowered their voices, as if they had spoken of hell; and most often they were content to shake their heads as men who would rather not speak of these depths of fiery furnace. As the galleries sank towards the north, they approached Tartaret, penetrating to that interior fire which calcined the rocks above. The cuttings at the point at which they had arrived had an average temperature of forty-five degrees. They were there in the accursed city, in the midst of the flames which the passers-by on the plain could see through the fissures, spitting out sulphur and poisonous vapours."
"Lénore et Henri restaient immobiles de saisissement, révoltés d’une pareille menterie, eux qu’on fouettait, s’ils ne disaient pas la vérité.

"Une brusque sonnerie de clairon fit tressaillir Catherine. Elle se haussa, elle vit le poste du Voreux qui prenait les armes.

"On arriva à Gaston-Marie, en une masse grossie encore, plus de deux mille cinq cents forcenés, brisant tout, balayant tout, avec la force accrue du torrent qui roule. Des gendarmes y avaient passé une heure plus tôt, et s’en étaient allés du côté de Saint-Thomas, égarés par des paysans, sans même avoir la précaution, dans leur hâte, de laisser un poste de quelques hommes, pour garder la fosse. En moins d’un quart d’heure, les feux furent renversés, les chaudières vidées, les bâtiments envahis et dévastés. Mais c’était surtout la pompe qu’on menaçait.

"– Nous y sommes, n’est-ce pas ? Dansaert, demanda-t-il.","- We're there, aren't we? Dansaert, he asked.","‘Here we are at last. Am I right, Dansaert?’ he asked.","""Here we are, are we not, Dansaert?"" he asked."
"Pierron avait paru, avec la lampe à feu libre des porions, fixée dans le cuir de sa barrette. Depuis huit jours, il était chef d’équipe à l’accrochage, et les ouvriers s’écartaient, car les honneurs le rendaient fier. La vue d’Étienne l’ennuya, il s’approcha pourtant, finit par se rassurer, lorsque le jeune homme lui eut annoncé son départ. Ils causèrent. Sa femme tenait maintenant l’estaminet du Progrès, grâce à l’appui de tous ces messieurs, qui se montraient si bons pour elle. Mais, s’interrompant, il s’emporta contre le père Mouque, qu’il accusait de n’avoir pas remonté le fumier de ses chevaux, à l’heure réglementaire. Le vieux l’écoutait, courbait les épaules. Puis, avant de descendre, suffoqué de cette réprimande, il donna lui aussi une poignée de main à Étienne, la même que celle des autres, longue, chaude de colère rentrée, frémissante des rébellions futures. Et cette vieille main qui tremblait dans la sienne, ce vieillard qui lui pardonnait ses enfants morts, l’émotionna tellement, qu’il le regarda disparaître, sans dire un mot.","Pierron had appeared, with the foremen's free lamp, fixed in the leather of his barrette. For the past eight days he had been foreman of the rigging, and the workers moved aside, for the honors made him proud. The sight of Étienne bored him, but he approached, finally reassured himself when the young man announced his departure. They chatted. His wife now kept the Estaminet du Progrès, thanks to the support of all these gentlemen, who showed themselves so kind to her. But, interrupting himself, he flew into a rage against Father Mouque, whom he accused of not having brought up the manure from his horses at the prescribed time. The old man listened to him, hunched his shoulders. Then, before going downstairs, suffocated by this reprimand, he too gave Étienne a handshake, the same as the others, long, warm with suppressed anger, quivering with future rebellion. And this old hand which trembled in his, this old man who forgave him his dead children, moved him so much that he watched him disappear without saying a word.","Pierron had appeared, with the open lamp of a deputy attached to his leather cap. It was now a week since he had been put in charge of the onsetters at pit-bottom, and the men moved aside to let him pass, for this great honour had made him stand on his dignity. He was annoyed to see Étienne there, but he came across and was eventually reassured when Étienne told him he was leaving. Pierron’s wife, it seemed, was now running the Progress, thanks to the support of the kind gentlemen who had all been very good to her. But then Pierron broke off to reprimand old Mouque angrily for not having brought up the horse-dung at the regulation hour. The old man listened to him with hunched shoulders. Then, before going down, speechless with anger at being told off like this, he too shook Étienne’s hand, and his handshake was like the others’, long, warm with the heat of his suppressed anger, and quivering with the anticipation of future rebellions. And Étienne was so moved to feel this old man’s trembling hand in his, forgiving him for the death of his children, that he watched him go without saying a word.","Pierron had appeared with his naked captain's lamp fixed into the leather of his cap. For the past week he had been chief of the gang at the pit-eye, and the men moved away, for promotion had rendered him bossy. The sight of Étienne annoyed him; he came up, however, and was at last reassured when the young man announced his departure. They talked. His wife now kept the Estaminet du Progrés, thanks to the support of all those gentlemen, who had been so good to her. But he interrupted himself and turned furiously on to Father Mouque, whom he accused of not sending up the dung-heap from his stable at the regulation hour. The old man listened with bent shoulders. Then, before going down, suffering from this reprimand, he, too, gave his hand to Étienne, with the same long pressure as the others, warm with restrained anger and quivering with future rebellion. And this old hand which trembled in his, this old man who was forgiving him for the loss of his dead children, affected Étienne to such a degree that he watched him disappear without saying a word."

"Elle les porta l’un après l’autre. Des flaques trouaient la chaussée, elle se retroussait, avec la peur d’arriver trop sale. Trois fois, elle faillit tomber, tant ce sacré pavé était gras. Et, comme ils débouchaient enfin devant le perron, deux chiens énormes se jetèrent sur eux, en aboyant si fort que les petits hurlaient de peur. Il avait fallu que le cocher prît un fouet.","She carried them one after the other. Puddles pierced the roadway, she rolled up, with the fear of arriving too dirty.

"Maintenant, elle causait avec tranquillité de ses morts, de son homme, de Zacharie, de Catherine ; et des larmes parurent seulement dans ses yeux, lorsqu’elle prononça le nom Alzire. Elle était revenue à son calme de femme raisonnable, elle jugeait très sagement les choses. Ça ne porterait pas chance aux bourgeois, d’avoir tué tant de pauvres gens. Bien sûr qu’ils en seraient punis un jour, car tout se paie. On n’aurait pas même besoin de s’en mêler, la boutique sauterait seule, les soldats tireraient sur les patrons, comme ils avaient tiré sur les ouvriers. Et, dans sa résignation séculaire, dans cette hérédité de discipline qui la courbait de nouveau, un travail s’était ainsi fait, la certitude que l’injustice ne pouvait durer davantage, et que, s’il n’y avait plus de bon Dieu, il en repousserait un autre, pour venger les misérables.","Now she was talking quietly of her dead, of her husband, of Zacharie, of Catherine; and tears only appeared in her eyes, when she pronounced the name Alzire. She had returned to her calm, reasonable woman, she judged things very wisely. It wouldn't bring luck to the bourgeois to have killed so many poor people. Of course they would be punished for it one day, because everything is paid for. We wouldn't even need to interfere, the shop would be blown up by itself, the soldiers would fire on the bosses, as they had fired on the workers. And, in her age-old resignation, in this heredity of discipline which bent her anew, a work had thus been done, the certainty that the injustice could not last any longer, and that, if there was no longer any good God, he would repulse another, to avenge the wretched.","She now talked quite easily about those she had lost, about Maheu and Zacharie and Catherine; and tears came into her eyes only when she mentioned the name of Alzire. She was once again the calm, reasonable woman she used to be, always able to take a sensible view of things. It wouldn’t do the bourgeois any good to have killed so many poor people. Of course they would pay for it one day, the day of reckoning always came. There wouldn’t even be the need to do anything about it, the whole bloody lot would just blow up in their faces, and the soldiers would shoot the bosses the same way they’d shot the workers. Underneath the blind acceptance inherited from previous generations and the inborn sense of discipline that was again bending her neck to the yoke, a shift had thus taken place, for now she was certain that the injustice could not go on, and that just because the gates of heaven hadn’t opened this time, it didn’t mean they wouldn’t open one day and offer vengeance to the poor.","Now she talked with tranquillity of her dead, of her man, of Zacharie, of Catherine; and tears only came into her eyes when she uttered Alzire's name. She had resumed her calm reasonableness, and judged things sensibly. It would bring no luck to the middle class to have killed so many poor people. Sure enough, they would be punished for it one day, for everything has to be paid for. There would even be no need to interfere; the whole thing would explode by itself. The soldiers would fire on the masters just as they had fired on the men. And in her everlasting resignation, in that hereditary discipline under which she was again bowing, a conviction had established itself, the certainty that injustice could not last longer, and that, if there were no good God left, another would spring up to avenge the wretched."

"Cependant, la débandade commençait. Protégeant la retraite, la veuve Désir était allée s’accoter contre la porte, que les crosses des gendarmes ébranlaient dans son dos. Les mineurs enjambaient les bancs, s’échappaient à la file, par la cuisine et le bûcher. Rasseneur disparut un des premiers, et Levaque le suivit, oublieux de ses injures, rêvant de se faire offrir une chope, pour se remettre. Étienne, après s’être emparé de la petite caisse, attendait avec Pluchart et Maheu, qui tenaient à honneur de sortir les derniers. Comme ils partaient, la serrure sauta, le commissaire se trouva en présence de la veuve, dont la gorge et le ventre faisaient encore barricade.","However, the stampede was beginning. Protecting the retreat, Widow Désir went and leaned against the door, which the butts of the gendarmes shook behind her. The miners were stepping over the benches, escaping in single file, through the kitchen and the woodshed. Rasseneur was one of the first to disappear, and Levaque followed him, oblivious to his insults, dreaming of being offered a mug to recover. Étienne, after taking possession of the petty cash, was waiting with Pluchart and Maheu, who made it a point of honor to come out last. As they were leaving, the lock jumped, the commissioner found himself in the presence of the widow, whose throat and belly still formed a barricade.","Meanwhile the rout had begun. To cover their retreat Widow Desire had gone over to stand with her back to the main door, and she could feel the police slamming their rifle-butts into it behind her. The miners were clambering over the benches and streaming out through the kitchen and woodshed one after another. Rasseneur was one of the first to disappear, followed by Levaque, who had completely forgotten how he had insulted him earlier and was now hoping to cadge a beer, just to steady his nerves. Étienne, having grabbed the little chest, was waiting behind with Pluchart and Maheu, for whom it was a point of honour to be the last out. Just as they were leaving, the lock finally gave, and the superintendent found himself in the presence of Widow Desire and the further obstacle of her stomach and bust.","Meanwhile, the retreat began. In order to cover it, Widow Désir had propped herself up against the door, which the butt-ends of the gendarmes' muskets were forcing at her back. The miners jumped over the benches, and escaped, one by one, through the kitchen and the wood-yard. Rasseneur disappeared among the first, and Levaque followed him, forgetful of his abuse, and planning how he could get an offer of a glass to pull himself together. Étienne, after having seized the little box, waited with Pluchart and Maheu, who considered it a point of honour to emerge last. As they disappeared the lock gave, and the commissioner found himself in the presence of the widow, whose breast and belly still formed a barricade."
"À la porte, des herscheuses stationnaient toujours, causant avec des mineurs qui s’attardaient, pour voir. Lorsque la chambre des porions se rouvrit, un silence régna dans le groupe. Et il se forma un nouveau cortège, le fourgon devant, le brancard derrière, puis la qu’elle du monde. On quitta le carreau de la mine, on monta lentement la route en pente du coron. Les premiers froids de novembre avaient dénudé l’immense plaine, une nuit lente l’ensevelissait, comme un linceul tombé du ciel livide.","At the gate putters were still stationed, talking with miners who lingered to see. When the captains' room reopened, a silence reigned in the group. And a new procession formed, the van in front, the stretcher behind, then the queen of the world.

The first cold spells of November had bared the immense plain, a slow night buried it, like a shroud fallen from the livid sky.","Putters were still standing outside the door, chatting with some miners who had remained behind to see what was happening. When the door of the deputies’ room opened again, the group fell silent. A new funeral cortège formed up, with the wagon in front, then the stretcher, and finally the line of people following. They moved out of the pit-yard and slowly climbed the road towards the village. The first frosts of November had stripped the vast plain bare, and night was slowly burying it in a shroud of livid white as though a pall had detached itself from the paling sky.","Some putters were still standing at the door talking with some miners who were waiting about to look on. When the door reopened there was silence in the group. A new procession was then formed, the van in front, then the stretcher, and then the train of people.

The first November cold had denuded the immense plain; the night was now slowly burying it like a shroud fallen from the livid sky."
"Il hâtait la manœuvre pour la remonte, ne voulant point sévir, faisant semblant de ne pas entendre. Cependant, les murmures devenaient tels, qu’il fut forcé de s’en mêler.

"Tout de suite, les huées recommencèrent. C’étaient les femmes qui se précipitaient, prises de l’ivresse du sang.","Immediately, the boos started again.

"Mais, comme il arrivait en effet, une autre voix cria du fond de la taille :","But, as it was indeed happening, another voice cried from the depths of the waist:","But as indeed he reached the spot, another voice shouted from the coal-face:","He had, in fact, arrived, and another voice cried from the bottom of the cutting:"

What was going on? He had taken a solemn oath with them the night before, and here he was going down the mine with everyone else! Was this some sort of bloody joke?","Imprecations broke out and there was a movement of the crowd towards the traitor. What! he had sworn with them the day before, and now they found him down below with the others! Was he, then, making fools of people?"
"Dès lors, il ne fut plus possible de s’entendre. Tous se fâchaient, les Levaque renvoyaient comme réponse aux Maheu que la Pierronne en avait dit bien d’autres sur leur compte, et qu’ils avaient vendu Catherine, et qu’ils s’étaient pourris ensemble, jusqu’aux petits, avec une saleté prise par Étienne au Volcan.","From then on, it was no longer possible to agree. Everyone got angry, the Levaques sent back the Maheus as a response that Pierronne had said many more about them, and that they had sold Catherine, and that they had rotted together, down to the little ones, with a dirt taken by Etienne from the Volcano.","After that any reconciliation was out of the question. Everybody was angry, and the Levaques retorted that La Pierronne had told them all sorts about the Maheus, like how they’d sold Catherine off, and how Étienne had caught a dose at the Volcano, and now the whole filthy lot of them had it, even the children.","After that it was no longer possible to come to an understanding. They all grew angry, and the Levaques, as a reply to the Maheus, asserted that Pierronne had said a good many other things on their account; that they had sold Catherine, that they were all rotten together, even to the little ones, with a dirty disease caught by Étienne at the Volcan."
"Mais la Pierronne, calmée, tenait tête aux gros mots, très méprisante, dans sa certitude d’être la plus belle et la plus riche.","But the Pierronne, calmed down, stood up to the swear words, very contemptuous, in her certainty of being the most beautiful and the richest.","But La Pierronne had recovered her composure, and she listened unbowed to the insults and the crude remarks, thoroughly disdainful in the certainty that she was richer and prettier than any of them.","But Pierronne, grown calm, held her own against this abuse, very contemptuous in the assurance that she was the best looking and the richest."
"Les jours de paie aux Chantiers de la Compagnie, Montsou semblait en fête, comme par les beaux dimanches de ducasse. De tous les corons arrivait une cohue de mineurs. Le bureau du caissier étant très petit, ils préféraient attendre à la porte, ils stationnaient par groupes sur le pavé, barraient la route d’une qu’elle de monde renouvelée sans cesse. Des camelots profitaient de l’occasion, s’installaient avec leurs bazars roulants, étalaient jusqu’à de la faïence et de la charcuterie. Mais c’étaient surtout les estaminets et les débits qui faisaient une bonne recette, car les mineurs, avant d’être payés, allaient prendre patience devant les comptoirs, puis y retournaient arroser leur paie, dès qu’ils l’avaient en poche. Encore se montraient-ils très sages, lorsqu’ils ne l’achevaient pas au Volcan.","On paydays at the Chantiers de la Compagnie, Montsou seemed to be celebrating, as on the beautiful Sundays at the Ducasse. From all the settlements came a crowd of miners. The cashier's office being very small, they preferred to wait at the door, they parked in groups on the pavement, blocking the way from a constantly changing crowd. Street vendors took advantage of the opportunity, set up shop with their rolling bazaars, even displaying earthenware and charcuterie. But it was especially the estaminets and the bars that made a good profit, because the miners, before being paid, went to be patient in front of the counters, then returned there to sprinkle their pay, as soon as they had it in their pocket. Yet they were very wise when they did not finish him off at the Volcano.","On pay-days at the Company yards Montsou wore an air of celebration, as though it were a fine Sunday on the day of the ducasse. A horde of miners converged from the surrounding villages. Since the cashier’s office was very small, they preferred to wait outside, standing about in groups on the road and causing an obstruction with their continuous queue. Hawkers made the most of the opportunity, setting up their mobile stalls and displaying everything from crockery to cooked meats. But it was the taverns and bars that did a particularly brisk trade, since the miners would go and stand at the counter to pass the time till they were paid, and then return there to celebrate once the money was in their pockets. And they were always very well behaved about it, presuming they didn’t go and blow the lot at the Volcano.","On pay-day at the Company's Yards, Montsou seemed to be in the midst of a fete as on fine Sunday feast-days. Bands of miners arrived from all the settlements. The cashier's office being very small, they preferred to wait at the door, stationed in groups on the pavement, barring the way in a crowd that was constantly renewed. Hucksters profited by the occasion and installed themselves with their movable stalls that sold even pottery and cooked meats. But it was especially the estaminets and the bars which did a good trade, for the miners before being paid went to the counters to get patience, and returned to them to wet their pay as soon as they had it in their pockets. But they were very sensible, except when they finished it at the Volcan."
"Et elle s’était plantée devant son homme, elle le défendait, oubliant les coups, oubliant la vie de misère, soulevée dans l’idée qu’elle lui appartenait, puisqu’il l’avait prise, et que c’était une honte pour elle, quand on l’abîmait ainsi.","And she had planted herself in front of her man, she was defending him, forgetting the blows, forgetting the life of misery, uplifted in the idea that she belonged to him, since he had taken her, and that it was a shame for her, when she was spoiled like this.","She had taken up position in front of her man, ready to defend him, forgetting how he hit her, forgetting their life of misery together, mindful only that since he had taken her she belonged to him and that it brought shame on her that he should be abused like this.","And she planted herself before her man to defend him, forgetting the blows, forgetting the life of misery, lifted up by the idea that she belonged to him since he had taken her, and that it was a shame for her when they so crushed him."

She shook her head, laughed harder, played nice.

"Tous partaient, quittaient le salon dans un piétinement de troupeau, le dos arrondi, sans répondre un mot à cet espoir de soumission.

"D’abord, Catherine souffrit horriblement de la faim. Elle portait à sa gorge ses pauvres mains crispées, elle avait de grands souffles creux, une plainte continue, déchirante, comme si une tenaille lui eût arraché l’estomac. Étienne, étranglé par la même torture, tâtonnait fiévreusement dans l’obscurité, lorsque, près de lui, ses doigts rencontrèrent une pièce du boisage, à moitié pourrie, que ses ongles émiettaient. Et il en donna une poignée à la herscheuse, qui l’engloutit goulûment. Durant deux journées, ils vécurent de ce bois vermoulu, ils le dévorèrent tout entier, désespérés de l’avoir fini, s’écorchant à vouloir entamer les autres, solides encore, et dont les fibres résistaient. Leur supplice augmenta, ils s’enrageaient de ne pouvoir mâcher la toile de leurs vêtements. Une ceinture de cuir qui le serrait à la taille les soulagea un peu. Il en coupa de petits morceaux avec les dents, et elle les broyait, s’acharnait à les avaler. Cela occupait leurs mâchoires, leur donnait l’illusion qu’ils mangeaient. Puis, quand la ceinture fut achevée, ils se remirent à la toile, la suçant pendant des heures.","First, Catherine suffered horribly from hunger. She raised her poor clenched hands to her throat, she let out great hollow breaths, a continuous, heartrending moan, as if pincers had torn her stomach. Étienne, strangled by the same torture, was groping feverishly in the darkness, when, near him, his fingers encountered a part of the woodwork, half rotten, which his nails were crumbling. And he gave a handful to the putter, who swallowed it greedily. For two days, they lived on this worm-eaten wood, they devoured it whole, desperate to have finished it, scratching themselves trying to cut into the others, which were still solid, and whose fibers resisted. Their torture increased, they were enraged at not being able to chew the linen of their clothes. A leather belt around his waist relieved them a little. He cut off small pieces with his teeth, and she crushed them, persisted in swallowing them. It occupied their jaws, gave them the illusion that they were eating. Then, when the belt was finished, they went back to the canvas, sucking on it for hours.","At first Catherine suffered horribly from the lack of food. She would press her poor clenched fists to her throat, and her breath came in long, wheezing, ear-splitting moans as if her stomach were being removed by forceps. Étienne, racked by the same torture, was groping round desperately in the dark when, right next to him, his fingers came on a piece of half-rotten timber, which he broke up with his nails. He gave Catherine a handful, which she devoured greedily. For two days they lived off this mouldy piece of wood; they ate the whole thing and were in despair when they finished it, scratching away till their fingers were raw in the attempt to start on other bits of wood that were still sound and whose fibres refused to give. Their torment grew worse, and they were furious to find that they couldn’t eat the material of their clothes. Étienne’s leather belt brought a modicum of relief: he bit off little pieces for her, which she chewed to a pulp and tried her hardest to swallow. It gave their jaws something to do while affording them the illusion of eating. Then, when the belt was finished, they started to chew their clothes again, sucking them for hours on end.","At first Catherine suffered horribly from hunger. She pressed her poor shrivelled hands against her breasts, her breathing was deep and hollow, a continuous tearing moan, as though tongs were tearing her stomach. Étienne, choked by the same torture, was feeling feverishly round him in the darkness, when his fingers came upon a half-rotten piece of timber, which his nails could crumble. He gave a handful of it to the putter, who swallowed it greedily. For two days they lived on this worm-eaten wood, devouring it all, in despair when it was finished, grazing their hands in the effort to crush the other planks which were still solid with resisting fibres. Their torture increased, and they were enraged that they could not chew the cloth of their clothes. A leather belt, which he wore round the waist, relieved them a little. He bit small pieces from it with his teeth, and she chewed them, and endeavoured to swallow them. This occupied their jaws, and gave them the illusion of eating. Then, when the belt was finished, they went back to their clothes, sucking them for hours."
"Ses yeux s’étaient mouillés, dans ce cri où éclatait le secret désir du vaincu, le refuge où il aurait voulu perdre à jamais son tourment.","His eyes had watered, in this cry which burst forth the secret desire of the vanquished, the refuge where he would have liked to lose his torment forever.","His eyes had begun to fill as he gave vent to his feelings, betraying the secret desire of the vanquished for a place of eternal refuge in which all torment shall cease.","His eyes were moist, as in this cry there broke out the secret desire of the vanquished, the refuge in which he desired to lose his torment for ever."
"Elle se tut, grelottante. Puis, à voix très basse, elle continua :","She fell silent, shivering. Then, in a very low voice, she continued:","She shivered and fell silent. Then, very quietly, she went on:","She became silent, shivering. Then in a very low voice she whispered:"
"Maheu cessa de geindre. Enfin, il avait détaché son bloc. Il essuya sur sa manche son visage ruisselant, il s’inquiéta de ce que Zacharie était monté faire derrière lui.","Maheu stopped moaning. Finally, he had detached his pad. He wiped his dripping face on his sleeve, worrying about what Zacharie had come up behind him to do.",Maheu stopped grunting.

At last he had detached his block, and he wiped his streaming face on his sleeve. He was worried about what Zacharie was doing behind him."
"Cet ordre de son père ralentit un instant sa course. Elle tremblait, des larmes gonflaient ses paupières. Puis, malgré sa peur, elle reprit sa place, toujours courant.

"Celui-ci n’eut pas le temps de sauter en arrière. Il tomba, la face broyée, le crâne fendu. La cervelle avait éclaboussé le toit de la galerie, un jet pourpre coulait de la plaie, pareil au jet continu d’une source. Tout de suite, il y eut une mare, où l’étoile fumeuse de la lampe se refléta. L’ombre envahissait ce caveau muré, le corps semblait, par terre, la bosse noire d’un tas d’escaillage.","He didn't have time to jump back. He fell, his face crushed, his skull split open.

The shadow invaded this walled vault, the body seemed, on the ground, the black bump of a heap of scaling.","He did not even have time to jump back. He fell where he was, his face smashed, his skull split open. His brains had spattered against the roof, and a jet of purple was pouring from the wound like water spurting from a spring.

Dark shadow filled the walled cave, and the body on the ground looked like the black hump of a pile of coal.","The latter had not time to jump backwards. He fell, his face crushed, his skull broken.

Darkness was invading the walled-up cave, and this body, lying on the earth, looked like the black boss of a mass of rough coal."
"D’abord, ce fut une stupeur. Étienne s’était arrêté, la hache glissée des poings. Maheu, Levaque, tous les autres, oubliaient la boutique, les yeux tournés vers le mur, où coulait lentement un mince filet rouge. Et les cris avaient cessé, un silence s’élargissait dans l’ombre croissante.","First, it was a stupor. Étienne had stopped, the ax slipping from his fists.

"Cependant, il était plein d’inquiétude, trop calme encore pour céder à ce coup de colère.

"C’était une pensée charitable, qui devait compléter l’excursion. La mort de Zacharie les avait emplis de pitié pour cette tragique famille des Maheu, dont tout le pays causait.

Seulement, la mère les touchait, cette pauvre femme qui venait de perdre son fils, après avoir perdu son mari, et dont la fille n’était peut-être plus qu’un cadavre, sous la terre ; sans compter qu’on parlait encore d’un grand-père infirme, d’un enfant boiteux à la suite d’un éboulement, d’une petite fille morte de faim, pendant la grève. Aussi, bien que cette famille eût mérité en partie ses malheurs, par son esprit détestable, avaient-ils résolu d’affirmer la largeur de leur charité, leur désir d’oubli et de conciliation, en lui portant eux-mêmes une aumône.

"C’était surtout devant la porte de la Levaque que le rassemblement avait grossi. Deux femmes s’étaient avancées, puis dix, puis vingt. Prudemment, la Pierronne se taisait, à présent qu’il y avait trop d’oreilles.

Hennebeau had made the ladies sit in the back of the carriage, which sped towards Marchiennes, there was a final burst of chattering voices, all the women gesticulated, spoke to each other in the face, amidst a tumult of anthill in revolution.","People had congregated in especially large numbers outside La Levaque’s house.

"Carrément, il aborda des questions obscures de droit, le défilé des lois spéciales sur les mines, où il se perdait.

What was beneath the land belonged to the nation just as much as the land itself; but, following the granting of a vile privilege, the companies now had sole rights to it. The situation in Montsou was even less acceptable because the alleged legality of the concessions was compromised by earlier agreements made with the owners of what had once been fiefdoms, in accordance with ancient Hainaut1 custom.

She did not excuse herself, she simply narrated things--that they. had been nearly starved, and that she had made up her mind to it, so that they might not be sent away from the settlement."
"Souvent, au coude d’un chemin, Étienne s’arrêtait, dans la nuit glacée, pour écouter pleuvoir les décombres. Il respirait fortement les ténèbres, une joie du néant le prenait, un espoir que le jour se lèverait sur l’extermination du vieux monde, plus une fortune debout, le niveau égalitaire passé comme une faux, au ras du sol. Mais les fosses de la Compagnie surtout l’intéressaient, dans ce massacre. Il se remettait en marche, aveuglé d’ombre, il les visitait les unes après les autres, heureux quand il apprenait quelque nouveau dommage. Des éboulements continuaient à se produire, d’une gravité croissante, à mesure que l’abandon des voies se prolongeait. Au-dessus de la galerie nord de Mirou, l’affaissement du sol gagnait tellement, que la route de Joiselle, sur un parcours de cent mètres, s’était engloutie, comme dans la secousse d’un tremblement de terre ; et la Compagnie, sans marchander, payait leurs champs disparus aux propriétaires, inquiète du bruit soulevé autour de ces accidents. Crèvecœur et Madeleine, de roche très ébouleuse, se bouchaient de plus en plus. On parlait de deux porions ensevelis à la Victoire ; un coup d’eau avait inondé Feutry-Cantel ; il faudrait murailler un kilomètre de galerie à Saint-Thomas, où les bois, mal entretenus, cassaient de toutes parts. C’étaient ainsi, d’heure en heure, des frais énormes, des brèches ouvertes dans les dividendes des actionnaires, une rapide destruction des fosses, qui devait finir, à la longue, par manger les fameux deniers de Montsou, centuplés en un siècle.","Often, at a bend in a road, Étienne would stop in the icy night to listen to the rubble raining down. He breathed darkness strongly, a joy of nothingness seized him, a hope that the day would dawn on the extermination of the old world, no longer a standing fortune, the egalitarian level passed like a scythe, at ground level. But the pits of the Company especially interested him, in this massacre. He set off again, blinded by shadows, he visited them one after the other, happy when he learned of some new damage. Rockslides continued to occur, of increasing severity, as the abandonment of the tracks continued. Above the northern gallery of Mirou, the subsidence of the ground gained so much, that the road of Joiselle, on a distance of hundred meters, had been engulfed, as in the shock of an earthquake; and the Company, without haggling, paid the owners for their fields which had disappeared, worried about the noise raised around these accidents. Crèvecœur and Madeleine, of very loose rock, were becoming more and more blocked. There was talk of two captains buried at Victory; a rush of water had inundated Feutry-Cantel; it would be necessary to wall up a kilometer of gallery at Saint-Thomas, where the woods, badly maintained, were breaking on all sides. There were thus, from hour to hour, enormous costs, breaches opened in the dividends of the shareholders, a rapid destruction of the pits, which was to end, in the long run, by eating up the famous denarii of Montsou, a hundredfold in a century. .","Often, at a bend in the road, Étienne would stop in the freezing night air and listen to the sound of structures giving way. He would take deep lungfuls of the darkness, filled with euphoria at the prospect of this black void and with the hope that the new day would dawn on the extermination of the old world, with not a single fortune still intact and everything levelled to the ground by the scythe of equality. But amid this general destruction it was the Company’s pits which interested him the most. He would set off again, blinded by the darkness, and visit each of them one by one, delighted every time he learned of some further damage. New rock-falls were occurring constantly, and with increasing seriousness the longer the roadways remained out of use. Above the northern roadway at Mirou the subsidence was so great now that a whole hundred-metre stretch of the Joiselle road had fallen in as though there had been an earthquake; and the Company would compensate landowners at once when their fields disappeared, not even bothering to haggle over the price, so anxious were they not to let the news of such accidents spread. Crèvecœur and Madeleine, where the rock was particularly unstable, were suffering more and more blockages. There was talk of two deputies being buried alive at La Victoire; there had been flooding at Feutry-Cantel; one kilometre of roadway at Saint-Thomas would have to be bricked where the timbering had been poorly maintained and was splitting all along its length. Huge repair bills were thus mounting by the hour, making severe inroads into shareholders’ dividends, and in the long run the rapid destruction of the pits would end up consuming those famous Montsou deniers that had increased in value one hundredfold over the course of a century.","At the turn of a road Étienne often stopped in the frozen night to hear the rubbish raining down. He breathed deeply in the darkness, the joy of annihilation seized him, the hope that day would dawn on the extermination of the old world, with not a single fortune left standing, the scythe of equality levelling everything to the ground. But in this massacre it was the Company's pits that especially interested him. He would continue his walk, blinded by the darkness, visiting them one after the other, glad to discover some new disaster. Landslips of increasing gravity continued to occur on account of the prolonged abandonment of the passages. Above the north gallery of Mirou the ground sank in to such an extent, that the Joiselle road, for the distance of a hundred metres, had been swallowed up as though by the shock of an earthquake; and the Company, disturbed at the rumours raised by these accidents, paid the owners for their vanished fields without bargaining. Crévecoeur and Madeleine, which lay in very shifting rock, were becoming stopped up more and more. It was said that two captains had been buried at the Victoire; there was an inundation at Feutry-Cantel, it had been necessary to wall up a gallery for the length of a kilometre at Saint-Thomas, where the ill-kept timbering was breaking down everywhere. Thus every hour enormous sums were spent, making great breaches in the shareholders' dividends; a rapid destruction of the pits was going on, which must end at last by eating up the famous Montsou deniers which had been centupled in a century."

"C’était la veine où se trouvait leur taille. Dès les premières enjambées, Étienne se meurtrit de la tête et des coudes.

"Étienne, à son tour, vint s’asseoir sur la poutre. Sa tristesse augmentait, sans qu’il sût pourquoi. Le vieil homme, dont il regardait disparaître le dos, lui rappelait son arrivée du matin, le flot de paroles que l’énervement du vent avait arrachées à ce silencieux. Que de misère ! et toutes ces filles, éreintées de fatigue, qui étaient encore assez bêtes, le soir, pour fabriquer des petits, de la chair à travail et à souffrance ! Jamais ça ne finirait, si elles s’emplissaient toujours de meurt-de-faim. Est-ce quelles n’auraient pas dû plutôt se boucher le ventre, serrer les cuisses, ainsi qu’à l’approche du malheur ? Peut-être ne remuait-il confusément ces idées moroses que dans l’ennui d’être seul, lorsque les autres, à cette heure, s’en allaient deux à deux prendre du plaisir. Le temps mou l’étouffait un peu, des gouttes de pluie, rares encore, tombaient sur ses mains fiévreuses. Oui, toutes y passaient, c’était plus fort que la raison.","Étienne, in his turn, came and sat down on the beam. His sadness increased, without his knowing why.

It would never end if they were always filled with starving people. Shouldn't they have rather blocked their stomachs, squeezed their thighs, like when misfortune approaches? Perhaps he stirred up these gloomy ideas confusedly only out of the boredom of being alone, when the others, at that hour, were going off two by two to enjoy themselves. The mild weather suffocated him a little, drops of rain, still rare, fell on his feverish hands. Yes, all went through it, it was stronger than reason.","Étienne came and sat on the beam. He felt even sadder now, without knowing quite why.

There would be no end to it if they just went on producing more hungry mouths to feed. Would they not have done better to stop up their wombs and cross their legs in recognition of the impending disaster? But perhaps he was only mulling over such gloomy thoughts because he was fed up at finding himself alone while everyone else was pairing off to take their pleasure.

"D’abord, ils ne se firent pas grand mal. Les moulinets tapageurs de l’un, l’attente froide de l’autre, prolongeaient la lutte. Une chaise fut renversée, leurs gros souliers écrasaient le sable blanc, semé sur les dalles. Mais ils s’essoufflèrent à la longue, on entendit le ronflement de leur haleine, tandis que leur face rouge se gonflait comme d’un brasier intérieur, dont on voyait les flammes, par les trous clairs de leurs yeux.","First, they didn't hurt each other.

"La voiture n’ayant pu dépasser la ruelle de Réquillart, au milieu des groupes menaçants, Négrel avait suivi son idée, faire à pied les cent mètres qui les séparaient de l’hôtel, puis frapper à la petite porte donnant sur le jardin, près des communs : le jardinier les entendrait, il y aurait bien toujours là quelqu’un pour ouvrir. Et, d’abord, les choses avaient marché parfaitement, déjà Mme Hennebeau et ces demoiselles frappaient, lorsque des femmes, prévenues, se jetèrent dans la ruelle. Alors, tout se gâta. On n’ouvrait pas la porte, Négrel avait tâché vainement de l’enfoncer à coups d’épaule. Le flot des femmes croissait, il craignit d’être débordé, il prit le parti désespéré de pousser devant lui sa tante et les jeunes filles, pour gagner le perron, au travers des assiégeants. Mais cette manœuvre amena une bousculade : on ne les lâchait pas, une bande hurlante les traquait, tandis que la foule refluait de droite et de gauche, sans comprendre encore, étonnée seulement de ces dames en toilette, perdues dans la bataille. À cette minute, la confusion devint telle, qu’il se produisit un de ces faits d’affolement qui restent inexplicables. Lucie et Jeanne, arrivées au perron, s’étaient glissées par la porte que la femme de chambre entrebâillait ; Mme Hennebeau avait réussi à les suivre ; et, derrière elles, Négrel entra enfin, remit les verrous, persuadé qu’il avait vu Cécile passer la première. Elle n’était plus là, disparue en route, emportée par une telle peur, quelle avait tourné le dos à la maison, et s’était jetée d’elle-même en plein danger.","The car having been unable to pass the lane of Réquillart, in the midst of menacing groups, Négrel had followed his idea, walking the hundred meters which separated them from the hotel, then knocking at the little door giving onto the garden, near outbuildings: the gardener would hear them, there would always be someone there to open the door. And, at first, things had gone perfectly, Madame Hennebeau and the young ladies were already knocking, when some women, warned, threw themselves into the alley. So everything went wrong. The door was not opened; Négrel had tried in vain to push it open with his shoulders. The stream of women increased, he feared to be overwhelmed, he took the desperate step of pushing his aunt and the young girls ahead of him to reach the steps, through the besiegers. But this maneuver led to a jostling: they were not let go, a screaming mob tracked them down, while the crowd flowed back from right and left, not yet understanding, surprised only by these ladies in dress, lost in the battle. At that moment the confusion became such that one of those acts of panic occurred which remain inexplicable. Lucie and Jeanne, having reached the steps, had slipped through the door which the maid was half-opening; Madame Hennebeau had succeeded in following them; and, behind them, Négrel entered at last, put back the bolts, persuaded that he had seen Cécile pass first. She was no longer there, disappeared on the way, carried away by such fear that she had turned her back on the house, and had thrown herself into full danger.","When the carriage had been unable to get beyond the Réquillart lane because of the threatening groups of people, Négrel had kept to his plan to walk the last hundred yards to the house and then knock on the little gate leading into the garden, next to the outbuildings: the gardener would hear them, there was bound to be someone there who would let them in. Things had gone well at first, and Mme Hennebeau and the young ladies were already knocking on the gate when some women who had been tipped off came rushing into the lane. Then everything went wrong. No one would open the gate, and Négrel had then vainly tried to force it open with his shoulder. The oncoming crowd of women was growing and he was afraid of being swept away in their path, so in desperation he ushered Mme Hennebeau and the girls forward in front of him, through the besieging mob, all the way to the front steps. But this manœuvre led to further commotion: they were still being pursued by a screaming horde of women, and meanwhile the crowd around them was swirling this way and that, not yet having realized what was going on and merely astonished to see these well-dressed ladies wandering about in the midst of battle. Such was the confusion at this point that there occurred one of those inexplicable things that can happen at moments of blind panic. Lucie and Jeanne, having reached the steps, had slipped in through the front door, which the maid was holding ajar: Mme Hennebeau had managed to follow them in; and finally Négrel entered the house and bolted the door, convinced that he had seen Cécile go in first before any of them. She was not there, she had vanished on the way: she had been so frightened that she had walked off in the opposite direction and straight into danger.","The carriage had not been able to pass through the threatening groups in the Réquillart lane. Négrel had carried out his idea, walking the hundred metres which separated them from the house, and knocking at the little door which led to the garden, near the common. The gardener would hear them, for there was always someone there to open. And, at first, things had gone perfectly; Madame Hennebeau and the young ladies were already knocking when some women, who had been warned, rushed into the lane. Then everything was spoilt. The door was not opened, and Négrel in vain sought to burst it open with his shoulder. The rush of women increased, and fearing they would be carried away, he adopted the desperate method of pushing his aunt and the girls before him, in order to reach the front steps, by passing through the besiegers. But this manoeuvre led to a hustling. They were not left free, a shouting band followed them, while the crowd floated up to right and to left, without understanding, simply astonished at these dressed-up ladies lost in the midst of the battle. At this moment the confusion was so great that it led to one of those curious mistakes which can never be explained. Lucie and Jeanne reached the steps, and slipped in through the door, which the housemaid opened; Madame Hennebeau had succeeded in following them, and behind them Négrel at last came in, and then bolted the door, feeling sure that he had seen Cécile go in first. She was no longer there, having disappeared on the way, so carried away by fear, that she had turned her back to the house, and had moved of her own accord into the thick of danger."
"Onze heures sonnaient à l’église, l’estaminet était fermé, mais des lueurs passaient par les fentes.","Eleven o'clock struck at the church, the estaminet was closed, but gleams shone through the cracks.","The church clock was striking eleven. The bar was closed, but light could be seen through chinks in the shutters.","Eleven o'clock struck at the church. The estaminet was closed, but gleams came through the cracks."
"Maintenant, dans le coron, les lumières s’éteignaient. Une dernière porte claqua, tout dormait de nouveau, les femmes et les petits reprenaient leur somme, au fond des lits plus larges. Et, du village éteint au Voreux qui soufflait, c’était sous les rafales un lent défilé d’ombres, le départ des charbonniers pour le travail, roulant des épaules, embarrassés de leurs bras, qu’ils croisaient sur la poitrine ; tandis que, derrière, le briquet faisait à chacun une bosse. Vêtus de toile mince, ils grelottaient de froid, sans se hâter davantage, débandés le long de la route, avec un piétinement de troupeau.","Now, in the settlement, the lights were going out. A final door slammed, everything was asleep again, the women and the little ones resumed their slumber, at the bottom of the larger beds. And, from the extinguished village to the blowing Voreux, there was a slow defile of shadows under the gusts, the departure of the charcoal burners for work, rolling their shoulders, embarrassed by their arms, which they crossed on their chests; while, behind, the lighter gave everyone a bump. Dressed in thin canvas, they shivered with cold, without hurrying any more, disbanded along the road, with the trampling of a herd.","Throughout the village the lights were going out. A last door slammed shut, and the whole place went back to sleep as the women and small children resumed their rest in beds where there was now more room. Meanwhile, from the dark, silent village to the puffing steam of Le Voreux, a long line of shadows moved slowly forward in the gusting wind, the miners on their way to work, shoulders hunched and superfluous arms folded across their chests. On their backs the ‘pieces’ bulged like humps. Shivering with cold in their thin clothes they made no effort to hurry but quietly tramped along, strung out like a straggling herd of animals.","Now the lights in the settlement were extinguished, and the last door banged. All again fell asleep; the women and the little ones resuming their slumber in the midst of wider beds. And from the extinguished village to the roaring Voreux a slow filing of shadows took place beneath the squalls, the departure of the colliers to their work, bending their shoulders and incommoded by their arms folded on their breasts, while the brick behind formed a hump on each back. Clothed in their thin jackets they shivered with cold, but without hastening, straggling along the road with the tramp of a flock."
"Catherine, qui avait déjà enlevé sa veste, hésita, puis ôta également sa culotte ; et, les bras nus, les cuisses nues, la chemise serrée aux hanches par une corde, comme une blouse, elle se remit à rouler.","Catherine, who had already taken off her jacket, hesitated, then also took off her panties; and, her arms bare, her thighs bare, her chemise tied at the hips with a cord like a blouse, she began to roll again.","Catherine, who had already taken off her jacket, hesitated for a moment and then removed her trousers also; and with her arms and legs bare, and her shirt tied round her hips like a smock with a piece of string , she began once more to roll her tubs.","Catherine, who had already taken off her jacket, hesitated, then took off her trousers also; and with naked arms and naked thighs, her chemise tied round her hips by a cord like a blouse, she began to push again."
"Et il retourna prendre sa place à la taille. Levaque et Chaval, eux aussi, lâchaient la rivelaine. Il y eut un repos. Tous s’essuyaient le visage sur leurs bras nus, en regardant la roche du toit, dont les masses schisteuses se fendillaient. Ils ne causaient guère que de leur travail.","And he returned to take his place at the waist. Levaque and Chaval, too, let go of the rivelaine. There was a rest. All wiped their faces on their bare arms, gazing at the rock of the roof, whose schistose masses were cracking. They barely talked about anything but their work.","He returned to his place at the coal-face, where Levaque and Chaval also downed tools. It was time for a break. They wiped their faces on their bare arms and looked up at the rock above them and the crazed surface of the shale. Work was almost all they ever talked about.","And he came back to take his place at the cutting. Levaque and Chaval had also dropped their picks. They were all resting. They wiped their faces on their naked arms and looked at the roof, in which slaty masses were cracking. They only spoke about their work."
"– Ah çà ! combien sont-ils, là-dedans ? demanda Étienne.",- Oh that ! how many are in there? asked Etienne.,‘Just look at them! How many of them are there in there?’ asked Étienne.,"""Hallo! how many are there in there?"" asked Étienne."
"Dompté, Bébert accepta les deux sous. Lydie, tremblante, n’avait rien dit, car elle éprouvait, devant Jeanlin, une peur et une tendresse de petite femme battue. Comme il lui tendait les deux sous, elle avança la main avec un rire soumis. Mais il se ravisa brusquement.","Tamed, Bébert accepted the two sous. Lydie, trembling, had said nothing, for she felt, in front of Jeanlin, the fear and tenderness of a beaten little woman. As he handed her the two pennies, she held out her hand with a submissive laugh. But he suddenly changed his mind.","Bébert had no answer and accepted the two sous. Lydie, who was trembling, had said nothing for, like the child equivalent of a battered wife, she felt afraid of Jeanlin and yet loved him too.

Lydie, who was trembling, had said nothing, for with Jeanlin she experienced the fear and the tenderness of a little beaten woman.

"C’était Chaval, un grand maigre de vingt-cinq ans, osseux, les traits forts, qui se fâchait d’avoir attendu. Lorsqu’il aperçut Étienne, il demanda, avec une surprise de mépris :","It was Chaval, a tall, thin man of twenty-five, bony, with strong features, who was angry at having waited. When he saw Étienne, he asked, with a surprise of contempt:","This was Chaval, a tall, thin, bony man of twenty-five with strong features. He was cross at having had to wait. When he caught sight of Étienne, he asked in scornful surprise:",""" It was Chaval, a tall, lean, bony fellow of twenty-five, with strongly marked features, who was in a bad humour at having to wait. When he saw Étienne he asked, with contemptuous surprise:"
"Il s’aperçut alors qu’il montait sur le terri, la tête bourdonnante de ces réflexions. Pourquoi ne causerait-il pas avec ce soldat ? Il saurait la couleur de ses idées. D’un air indifférent, il continuait de s’approcher, comme s’il eût glané les vieux bois, restés dans les déblais. La sentinelle demeurait immobile.","He then found himself coming up onto the floor, his head buzzing with these thoughts. Why shouldn't he talk to this soldier? He would know the color of his ideas. With an indifferent air, he continued to approach, as if he had gleaned the old wood, which had remained in the rubble. The sentry remained motionless.","He suddenly found himself climbing the spoil-heap, his head spinning with these thoughts. Why not have a chat with the soldier? That way he’d learn how the fellow saw things. Casually he drew nearer, pretending to scavenge for old wood among the rubbish. Still the sentry did not move.","He then noticed that he was ascending the pit-bank, his head filled with these reflections. Why should he not talk with this soldier? He would get to know what his ideas were. With an air of indifference, he continued to come nearer, as though he were gleaning old wood among the rubbish. The sentinel remained motionless."
– Comme c’est profond ! murmura Étienne.,- How deep! murmured Etienne.,"‘My God, it’s deep,’ Étienne muttered under his breath.","""How deep it is!"" murmured Étienne."
"Trois fois, Étienne recommença. Derrière lui, les camarades grondaient. Le bruit courait que M. Hennebeau était à la fosse, et on parlait de le descendre par le cou, pour voir s’il abattrait son charbon lui-même. Mais c’était un faux bruit, il n’y avait là que Négrel et Dansaert, qui tous deux se montrèrent un instant à une fenêtre de la recette : le maître porion se tenait en arrière, décontenancé depuis son aventure avec la Pierronne ; tandis que l’ingénieur, bravement, promenait sur la foule ses petits yeux vifs, souriant du mépris goguenard dont il enveloppait les hommes et les choses. Des huées s’élevèrent, ils disparurent. Et, à leur place, on ne vit plus que la face blonde de Souvarine. Il était justement de service, il n’avait pas quitté sa machine un seul jour, depuis le commencement de la grève, ne parlant plus, absorbé peu à peu dans une idée fixe, dont le clou d’acier semblait luire au fond de ses yeux pâles.","Three times Étienne started again. Behind him, the comrades rumbled. It was rumored that M. Hennebeau was at the pit, and there was talk of taking him down by the neck, to see if he would cut his coal himself. But it was a false report, there were only Négrel and Dansaert, who both appeared for a moment at a window of the receipt: the head foreman was standing behind, disconcerted since his adventure with Pierronne; while the engineer bravely cast his lively little eyes over the crowd, smiling with the mocking contempt with which he shrouded men and things. Boos went up, they disappeared. And, in their place, all that was left was Souvarine's blond face. He was just on duty, he had not left his machine a single day since the start of the strike, speaking no more, absorbed little by little in a fixed idea, the steel nail of which seemed to shine in the depths of his pale eyes.","Three times Étienne tried again. Behind him the comrades were becoming restive. A rumour was going round that M. Hennebeau was at the pit, and somebody suggested letting him down the shaft by his neck to see if he would dig out the coal himself. But the rumour was false; only Négrel and Dansaert were there, and they appeared briefly at a pit-head window. The overman remained in the background, unwilling to show his face since his episode with La Pierronne, but the engineer boldly surveyed the crowd with his sharp little eyes, smiling with the cheerful contempt that he habitually bestowed on all men and all things. People started hissing and booing, and the two men vanished from sight. And in the place where they had been standing, only the fair, pale face of Souvarine could now be seen. It happened to be his shift. Since the beginning of the strike he had never left his machinery even for a single day, but he had become more and more taciturn and more and more preoccupied by some obsession or other, which seemed to gleam like a bolt of steel in the depths of his pale eyes.","Three times over Étienne tried again. Behind him his mates were growling. The report ran that M. Hennebeau was at the pit, and they talked of letting him down by the neck, to see if he would hew his coal himself. But it was a false report; only Négrel and Dansaert were there. They both showed themselves for a moment at a window of the receiving-room; the head captain stood in the background, rather out of countenance since his adventure with Pierronne, while the engineer bravely looked round on the crowd with his bright little eyes, smiling with that sneering contempt in which he enveloped men and things generally. Hooting arose, and they disappeared. And in their place only Souvarine's pale face was seen. He was just then on duty; he had not left his engine for a single day since the strike began, no longer talking, more and more absorbed by a fixed idea, which seemed to be shining like steel in the depths of his pale eyes."
"Elle eut un petit frisson, elle répondit :","She had a little shiver, she replied:",She gave a little shiver and answered him:,She shuddered slightly and replied:
"Catherine, à la vue d’Étienne, saisie, restait toute blanche. Quand il l’eut aperçu à son tour, Chaval ricana d’un air mauvais.","Catherine, at the sight of Etienne, startled, remained completely white. When he saw him in his turn, Chaval snickered wickedly.","Seeing Étienne there, Catherine was taken aback, and the colour drained from her face. When Chaval spotted him also, he gave a nasty snigger.","Catherine, moved at the sight of Étienne, had become very pale. When Chaval in his turn perceived him, he grinned in his evil fashion."
"Étienne, en se tournant, se trouva de nouveau serré contre Catherine. Mais, cette fois, il devina les rondeurs naissantes de la gorge, il comprit tout d’un coup cette tiédeur qui l’avait pénétré.","Étienne, turning, found himself pressed against Catherine again. But, this time, he guessed the incipient roundness of the throat, he understood all of a sudden this warmth which had penetrated him.","As he turned, Étienne once more found himself pressed up close against Catherine.

"– Sacrée tête de pioche ! cria Chaval, crève donc, je serai débarrassé !","- Holy pickaxe head! cried Chaval, die then, I'll be rid of it!","‘Bugger it, then!’ Chaval shouted. ‘Die if you want to. And good riddance!’","""Confounded dunderhead!"" shouted Chaval. "" Die then; I shall be rid of you!"""
Chaval ricanait toujours.,Chaval was still laughing.,"‘Oh yeah, why not?",Chaval still grinned.

"À la porte des Pierron, Maheu et les Levaque rencontrèrent Lydie, qui piétinait dans la neige. La maison était close, un filet de lumière passait par la fente d’un volet ; et l’enfant répondit d’abord avec gêne aux questions : non, son papa n’y était pas, il était allé au lavoir rejoindre la mère Brûlé, pour rapporter le paquet de linge. Elle se troubla ensuite, refusa de dire ce que sa maman faisait. Enfin, elle lâcha tout, dans un rire sournois de rancune : sa maman l’avait flanquée à la porte, parce que M. Dansaert était là, et qu’elle les empêchait de causer. Celui-ci, depuis le matin, se promenait dans le coron, avec deux gendarmes, tâchant de racoler des ouvriers, pesant sur les faibles, annonçant partout que, si l’on ne descendait pas le lundi au Voreux, la Compagnie était décidée à embaucher des Borains. Et, comme la nuit tombait, il avait renvoyé les gendarmes, en trouvant la Pierronne seule ; puis, il était resté chez elle à boire un verre de genièvre, devant le bon feu.","At the Pierron's door, Maheu and the Levaques met Lydie, who was trampling in the snow. The house was closed, a trickle of light passed through the slit in a shutter; and the child answered the questions with embarrassment at first: no, his dad wasn't there, he had gone to the laundry to join Mother Brûlé, to bring back the package of linen. She became confused then, refused to say what her mother was doing. Finally, she let go of everything, with a sly laugh of resentment: her mother had kicked her out, because Monsieur Dansaert was there, and she was preventing them from talking. The latter, since the morning, had been walking in the settlement with two gendarmes, trying to solicit workmen, weighing on the weak, announcing everywhere that, if they did not go down to the Voreux on Monday, the Company had decided to hire Borains. And, as night was falling, he had sent the gendarmes away, finding Pierronne alone; then he had stayed at her house to drink a glass of gin, in front of the good fire.","Outside the Pierrons’ door Maheu and the Levaques ran into Lydie, who was pacing up and down in the snow. The house was shut up, but a chink of light could be seen through one of the shutters; and the child replied to their questions with some embarrassment: no, her father wasn’t in, he had gone to meet La Brûlé at the wash-house so as to carry the washing home. Then she became flustered and refused to say what her mother was doing. Eventually she revealed all, with a vindictive snigger: her mother had thrown her out because M. Dansaert was there and they couldn’t talk if she was around. Dansaert had been touring the village since morning in the company of two gendarmes in an attempt to recruit some workers, putting pressure on the weak and announcing to all and sundry that if they didn’t go back to work at Le Voreux next Monday the Company had decided to take on men from Belgium. And at dusk, finding La Pierronne alone, he had sent the gendarmes away and stayed to drink a glass of gin with her in front of her warm fire.","At the Pierrons' door Maheu and the Levaques met Lydie, who was stamping in the snow. The house was closed, and a thread of light came though a crack in a shutter. The child replied at first to their questions with constraint: no, her father was not there, he had gone to the wash-house to join Mother Brulé and bring back the bundle of linen. Then she was confused, and would not say what her mother was doing. At last she let out everything with a sly, spiteful laugh : her mother had pushed her out of the door because M. Dansaert was there, and she prevented them from talking.

"Sans la laisser parler, elle continua, elle montra Pierron assis devant un grand feu de houille.","Without letting her speak, she continued, pointing to Pierron seated before a large coal fire.","Without letting La Maheude get a word in, she motioned towards Pierron, who was sitting in front of a big coal fire, and added:","Without allowing her to speak, she went on, pointing to Pierron, who was seated before a large coal fire:"

Puis, tandis qu’elle se cachait les yeux, il traîna le misérable, il le jeta dans le plan incliné, pour l’ôter de l’espace étroit où il fallait vivre encore. La vie n’aurait plus été possible, avec ce cadavre sous les pieds. Et ils s’épouvantèrent, lorsqu’ils l’entendirent plonger, au milieu d’un redressement d’écume. L’eau avait donc empli déjà ce trou ? Ils l’aperçurent, elle déborda dans la galerie.","In a hug, she clung to his shoulders, and he hugged her too, and they hoped that they were going to die. But death was in no hurry, they untied their arms. Then, while she hid her eyes, he dragged the wretch, threw him down the inclined plane, to remove him from the narrow space where he still had to live. Life would no longer have been possible, with this corpse underfoot. And they were terrified, when they heard it dive, in the midst of a recovery of foam. Had the water already filled this hole? They saw her, she overflowed into the gallery.","She wrapped her arms round his shoulders and hugged him tight, as he hugged her; and together they hoped that they were about to die. But death was in no hurry, and they loosened their embrace. Then, as she hid her eyes, he dragged the poor wretch across the ground and pushed him down the incline, to clear the cramped space they still had to live in. Life would have been impossible with that corpse under their feet. But they were horrified to hear the body land with a splash. What? Had the flood filled the hole up already? Then they caught sight of it, overflowing into their roadway.","She clasped him, hanging to his shoulders, and he clasped her; and they hoped that they would die. But death was in no hurry, and they unlocked their arms. Then, while she hid her eyes, he dragged away the wretch, and threw him down the upbrow, to remove him from the narrow space in which they still had to live. Life would no longer have been possible with that corpse beneath their feet. And they were terrified when they heard it plunge into the midst of the foam which leapt up. The water had already filled that hole, then? They saw it; it was entering the gallery."

"Étienne ressentit une secousse. Des voix grondaient, des roches roulaient jusqu’à ses pieds. Quand il aperçut une lampe, il pleura. Ses yeux clignotants suivaient la lumière, il ne se lassait pas de la voir, en extase devant ce point rougeâtre qui tachait à peine les ténèbres. Mais des camarades l’emportaient, il les laissa introduire, entre ses dents serrés, des cuillerées de bouillon. Ce fut seulement dans la galerie de Réquillart qu’il reconnut quelqu’un, l’ingénieur Négrel, debout devant lui ; et ces deux hommes qui se méprisaient, l’ouvrier révolté, le chef sceptique, se jetèrent au cou l’un de l’autre, sanglotèrent à grands sanglots, dans le bouleversement profond de toute l’humanité qui était en eux. C’était une tristesse immense, la misère des générations, l’excès de douleur où peut tomber la vie.","Etienne felt a jolt. Voices rumbled, rocks rolled to his feet. When he saw a lamp, he wept. His blinking eyes followed the light, he never tired of seeing it, in ecstasy before this reddish point which barely stained the darkness. But his comrades carried him away, he let them introduce, between his clenched teeth, spoonfuls of broth. It was only in Réquillart's gallery that he recognized someone, the engineer Négrel, standing in front of him; and these two men who despised each other, the rebellious workman, the skeptical leader, threw themselves on each other's necks, sobbed loudly, in the profound upheaval of all the humanity that was within them. It was an immense sadness, the misery of generations, the excess of pain in which life can fall.","Étienne felt a jolt. He could hear a rumble of voices, and rocks were rolling down to his feet. When he saw a lamp, he wept. His blinking eyes followed the light, and he couldn’t watch it enough, in ecstasy at the sight of this pinprick of reddish light which barely pierced the darkness. But now some comrades were lifting him up to carry him away, and he allowed them to pour spoonfuls of broth between his locked jaws. It was only when they reached the main Réquillart roadway that he recognized someone, Négrel the engineer, who was standing there in front of him; and these two men who despised each other, the rebellious worker and the sceptical boss, threw their arms round each other and sobbed their hearts out, both of them shaken to the very core of their humanity. And into their immense sadness entered all the misery of countless generations and all the excess of pain and grief that it is possible to know in this life.","Étienne felt a shock. Voices were sounding, rocks were rolling to his feet. When he perceived a lamp he wept. His blinking eyes followed the light, he was never tired of looking at it, enraptured by this reddish point which scarcely stained the darkness.

It was only in the Réquillart gallery that he recognized someone standing before him, the engineer, Négrel; and these two men, with their contempt for each other--the rebellious workman and the sceptical master--threw themselves on each other's necks, sobbing loudly in the deep upheaval of all the humanity within them. It was an immense sadness, the misery of generations, the extremity of grief into which life can fall."

"Les Maheu dînèrent à midi sonnant. Ils ne menaient pas grand vacarme, au milieu des bavardages de porte à porte, des voisinages mêlant les femmes, dans un continuel remous d’appels, de réponses, d’objets prêtés, de mioches chassés ou ramenés d’une claque. D’ailleurs, ils étaient en froid depuis trois semaines avec leurs voisins, les Levaque, au sujet du mariage de Zacharie et de Philomène. Les hommes se voyaient, mais les femmes affectaient de ne plus se connaître. Cette brouille avait resserré les rapports avec la Pierronne. Seulement, la Pierronne, laissant à sa mère Pierron et Lydie, était partie de grand matin pour passer la journée chez une cousine, à Marchiennes ; et l’on plaisantait, car on la connaissait, la cousine : elle avait des moustaches, elle était maître porion au Voreux. La Maheude déclara que ce n’était guère propre, de lâcher sa famille, un dimanche de ducasse.","The Maheus dined at twelve o'clock. They didn't make a great racket, amid door-to-door chatter, neighborhoods mixing women, in a continual eddy of calls, answers, objects lent, kids being chased away or brought back with a slap. Moreover, they had been at odds for three weeks with their neighbors, the Levaques, about the marriage of Zacharie and Philomène. The men saw each other, but the women pretended not to know each other. This estrangement had strengthened relations with Pierronne. Only Pierronne, leaving her mother Pierron and Lydie, had left very early in the morning to spend the day with a cousin at Marchiennes; and we joked, for we knew the cousin: she had mustaches, she was foreman at the Voreux. Maheude declared that it was hardly proper to let go of one's family on a ducasse's Sunday.","The Maheus dined at twelve noon precisely. They made very little noise compared with the constant chatter and bustle going on outside as women hailed or answered their neighbours from doorstep to doorstep, lending things, chasing their kids outside or ordering them back indoors with a smack. In any case the Maheus had not been on speaking terms with their own neighbours, the Levaques, for the past three weeks on account of Zacharie and Philomène getting married. The men were still talking, but the women pretended not to know each other any more. The quarrel had brought each household closer to La Pierronne. But she had gone off early that morning, leaving her mother to look after Pierron and Lydie, and was spending the day with a cousin in Marchiennes; and everybody joked about how they knew this cousin, and how she had a moustache and was an overman at Le Voreux. La Maheude declared that it was just not right abandoning one’s family like that on the Sunday of the ducasse.","The Maheus dined at midday. They made little noise in the midst of the chatter from door to door, in the coming and going of women in a constant uproar of calls and replies, of objects borrowed, of youngsters hunted away or brought back with a slap. Besides, they had not been on good terms during the last three weeks with their neighbours, the Levaques, on the subject of the marriage of Zacharie and Philoméne. The men passed the time of day, but the women pretended not to know each other. This quarrel had strengthened the relations with Pierronne, only Pierronne had left Pierron and Lydie with her mother, and set out early in the morning to spend the day with a cousin at Marchiennes; and they joked, for they knew this cousin; she had a moustache, and was head captain at the Voreux. Maheude declared that it was not proper to leave one's family on a feast-day Sunday."
"Lui-même disparut. Étienne dut le suivre. Cette cheminée, laissée dans la veine, était réservée aux mineurs et desservait toutes les voies secondaires. Elle avait l’épaisseur de la couche de charbon, à peine soixante centimètres. Heureusement, le jeune homme était mince, car, maladroit encore, il s’y hissait avec une dépense inutile de muscles, aplatissant les épaules et les hanches, avançant à la force des poignets, cramponné aux bois. Quinze mètres plus haut, on rencontra la première voie secondaire ; mais il fallut continuer, la taille de Maheu et consorts était à la sixième voie, dans l’enfer, ainsi qu’ils disaient ; et, de quinze mètres en quinze mètres, les voies se superposaient, la montée n’en finissait plus, à travers cette fente qui raclait le dos et la poitrine. Étienne râlait, comme si le poids des roches lui eût broyé les membres, les mains arrachées, les jambes meurtries, manquant d’air surtout, au point de sentir le sang lui crever la peau. Vaguement, dans une voie, il aperçut deux bêtes accroupies, une petite, une grosse, qui poussaient des berlines : c’étaient Lydie et la Mouquette, déjà au travail. Et il lui restait à grimper la hauteur de deux tailles ! La sueur l’aveuglait, il désespérait de rattraper les autres, dont il entendait les membres agiles frôler le roc d’un long glissement.","He himself disappeared. Etienne had to follow him. This chimney, left in the vein, was reserved for the miners and served all the secondary roads. It was as thick as the layer of coal, barely sixty centimeters. Fortunately, the young man was thin, for, still clumsy, he hoisted himself up there with a useless expenditure of muscles, flattening his shoulders and hips, advancing by the strength of his wrists, clinging to the wood. Fifteen meters higher, we met the first secondary road; but it was necessary to continue, the size of Maheu and consorts was at the sixth way, in hell, as they said; and, from fifteen meters to fifteen meters, the tracks overlapped, the ascent never ended, through this cleft which scraped the back and the chest. Étienne gasped, as if the weight of the rocks had crushed his limbs, his hands torn off, his legs bruised, especially lacking in air, to the point of feeling the blood burst his skin. Vaguely, in a lane, he saw two beasts crouching, one small, one large, pushing carriages: they were Lydie and Mouquette, already at work. And he still had to climb the height of two sizes! Sweat blinded him, he was in despair of catching up with the others, whose agile limbs he heard skimming the rock.","He, too, vanished, and Étienne was obliged to follow. A kind of chimney had been left in the seam so that the miners could reach all the subsidiary roads. It was the same width as the coal-seam itself, scarcely sixty centimetres. Fortunately the young man was slim, for being as yet unpractised it took him an excessive amount of muscular effort to hoist himself aloft, which he did by squeezing his shoulders and hips in tight, then clinging to the timbers and dragging himself up by his wrists. Fifteen metres up they came on the first of the secondary roads; but they had to keep going because the face worked by Maheu and his team was the sixth road in ‘Hell’, as they called it. At intervals of fifteen metres came further roads, each one running exactly above the last; and the climb seemed never-ending as they scrambled up through this crack in the rock and felt the skin being scraped off their backs and their chests. Étienne was gasping for breath, as if the weight of the rock had crushed his limbs; his legs were bruised, his hands felt as though they had been torn from his arms, but above all he was desperate for air, to such an extent that his blood felt as though it were ready to burst from his veins. Dimly, in one of the roads, he made out the hunched shapes of two animals, one small and one large, pushing coal-tubs: it was Lydie and La Mouquette, already at work. And still he had the height of two coal-faces to climb! He was blinded by sweat and despaired of keeping pace with the others as he heard their supple limbs slithering smoothly up the surface of the rock.","He himself disappeared, and Étienne had to follow him. This chimney-passage left in the seam was reserved for miners, and led to all the secondary passages. It was about the thickness of the coal-bed, hardly sixty centimetres. Fortunately the young man was thin, for, as he was still awkward, he hoisted himself up with a useless expense of muscle, flattening his shoulders and hips, advancing by the strength of his wrists, clinging to the planks. Fifteen metres higher they came on the first secondary passage, but they had to continue, as the cutting of Maheu and his mates was in the sixth passage, in hell, as they said; every fifteen metres the passages were placed over each other in never-ending succession through this cleft, which scraped back and chest. Étienne groaned as if the weight of the rocks had pounded his limbs; with torn hands and bruised legs, he also suffered from lack of air, so that he seemed to feel the blood bursting through his skin. He vaguely saw in one passage two squatting beasts, a big one and a little one, pushing trains: they were Lydie and Mouquette already at work. And he had still to climb the height of two cuttings! He was blinded by sweat, and he despaired of catching up the others, whose agile limbs he heard brushing against the rock with a long gliding movement."
"Justement, à deux kilomètres des premières maisons, un peu en dessous du carrefour où se coupaient la grande route et le chemin de Vandame, Mme Hennebeau et ces demoiselles venaient d’assister au défilé de la bande. La journée à Marchiennes s’était passée gaiement, un déjeuner aimable chez le directeur des Forges, puis une intéressante visite aux ateliers et à une verrerie du voisinage, pour occuper l’après-midi ; et, comme on rentrait enfin, par ce déclin limpide d’un beau jour d’hiver, Cécile avait eu la fantaisie de boire une tasse de lait, en apercevant une petite ferme, qui bordait la route. Toutes alors étaient descendues de la calèche, Négrel avait galamment sauté de cheval ; pendant que la paysanne, effarée de ce beau monde, se précipitait, parlait de mettre une nappe, avant de servir. Mais Lucie et Jeanne voulaient voir traire le lait, on était allé dans l’étable même avec les tasses, on en avait fait une partie champêtre, riant beaucoup de la litière où l’on enfonçait.","Just two kilometers from the first houses, a little below the crossroads where the main road and the Vandame road intersected, Madame Hennebeau and these young ladies had just watched the procession of the band. The day at Marchiennes had passed cheerfully, a pleasant lunch with the manager of the Forges, then an interesting visit to the workshops and to a glassworks in the neighborhood, to occupy the afternoon; and, as they were finally returning, on this limpid decline of a fine winter's day, Cécile had taken it into her head to drink a cup of milk, on seeing a little farmhouse bordering the road. All then had descended from the carriage, Négrel had gallantly jumped from his horse; while the peasant woman, bewildered by this beautiful world, rushed over and talked about putting on a tablecloth before serving. But Lucie and Jeanne wanted to see the milk being milked, we had gone into the barn with the cups, we had made a rural part of it, laughing a lot at the litter where we were sinking.","At that very moment, some two kilometres beyond the first houses in Montsou and just before the crossroads where the road to Vandame met the main highway, Mme Hennebeau and the two young ladies had been watching the mob file past. Their day out in Marchiennes had been a jolly one: they had had a pleasant lunch at the house of the manager of Les Forges, followed by an interesting tour of the workshops and a visit to a neighbouring glass factory, which had taken care of the afternoon; and then, as they were making their way home through the clear twilight of this bright winter’s day, Cécile had noticed a small farmstead at the side of the road and taken a fancy to a cup of milk. The women had all stepped down from the carriage, and Négrel had gallantly dismounted to accompany them. Meanwhile the farmer’s wife, flustered at being visited by gentry, rushed about and declared that she must put a cloth on the table before she could serve them. But Lucie and Jeanne wanted to see the cow being milked, and so they had all gone to the cowshed with their cups; it was almost like going on a picnic, and they laughed with delight as their feet sank into the straw.","Just then, two kilometres away from the first houses, a little beyond the crossways where the main road cut the Vandame road, Madame Hennebeau and the young ladies had witnessed the passing of the mob. The day had been spent pleasantly at Marchiennes; there had been a delightful lunch with the manager of the Forges, then an interesting visit to the workshops and to the neighbouring glass works to occupy the afternoon; and as they were now going home in the limpid decline of the beautiful winter day, Cécile had had the whim to drink a glass of milk, as she noticed a little farm near the edge of the road. They all then got down from the carriage, and Négrel gallantly leapt off his horse; while the peasant-woman, alarmed by all these fine people, rushed about, and spoke of laying a cloth before serving the milk. But Lucie and Jeanne wanted to see the cow milked, and they went into the cattle-shed with their cups, making a little rural party, and laughing greatly at the litter in which one sank."
"Zacharie avait obtenu d’être parmi les ouvriers d’élite mis à l’abattage. C’était un poste d’honneur qu’on se disputait. Et il s’emportait, lorsqu’on voulait le relayer, après ses deux heures de corvée réglementaire. Il volait le tour des camarades, il refusait de lâcher la rivelaine. Sa galerie bientôt fut en avance sur les autres, il s’y battait contre la houille d’un élan si farouche, qu’on entendait monter du boyau le souffle grondant de sa poitrine, pareil au ronflement de quelque forge intérieure. Quand il en sortait, boueux et noir, ivre de fatigue, il tombait par terre, on devait l’envelopper dans une couverture. Puis, chancelant encore, il s’y replongeait, et la lutte recommençait, les grands coups sourds, les plaintes étouffées, un encagement victorieux de massacre. Le pis était que le charbon devenait dur, il cassa deux fois son outil, exaspéré de ne plus avancer si vite. Il souffrait aussi de la chaleur, une chaleur qui augmentait à chaque mètre d’avancement, insupportable au fond de cette trouée mince, où l’air ne pouvait circuler. Un ventilateur à bras fonctionnait bien, mais l’aérage s’établissait mal, on retira à trois reprises des haveurs évanouis, que l’asphyxie étranglait.","Zacharie had obtained to be among the elite workers slaughtered. It was a post of honor that we were fighting over. And he got carried away, when we wanted to relieve him, after his two hours of regulatory chore. He stole the turn of the comrades, he refused to let go of the rivelaine. His gallery was soon in advance of the others, there he fought against the coal with such fierce vigor that one could hear the grumbling breath of his chest rising from the tunnel, like the humming of some inner forge. When he came out, muddy and black, drunk with fatigue, he fell to the ground, we had to wrap him in a blanket. Then, still tottering, he plunged back into it, and the struggle began again, the great dull blows, the stifled complaints, a victorious confinement of massacre. The worst was that the coal was getting hard, he broke his tool twice, exasperated at not moving so fast. He also suffered from the heat, a heat which increased with each meter of advancement, unbearable at the bottom of this thin gap, where the air could not circulate. A hand-held fan was working well, but ventilation was badly established, three times pikemen who had passed out and were strangled by asphyxiation were pulled out.","Zacharie had managed to get himself included among those selected for the task of cutting the coal. It was a position of honour and much sought after. He would get cross when they tried to relieve him after his regulation two-hour stint, and he would pinch the comrades’ turns and refuse to relinquish his pick. His shaft was soon ahead of the others, and he attacked the coal with such ferocity that the panting and grunting coming up from below sounded like the noise of bellows in an underground forge. When he emerged, covered in black dirt and giddy with exhaustion, he would collapse on the ground and have to be covered with a blanket. Then back he would go, still staggering with exhaustion, and battle recommenced to the sound of thudding pick and muffled groan as he slew the coal in furious triumph. The worst of it was that the coal was becoming hard, and twice he broke his tool on it in his rage at not being able to go as fast as before. He was also suffering from the heat, which was increasing with every metre, and it was quite unbearable at the bottom of the tiny shaft where the air had no room to circulate. A hand-operated ventilator was working well enough, but it was difficult to get a draught going, and three times they had to pull a man free after he passed out for lack of air.","Zacharie had secured a place among the workers chosen for the hewing. It was a post of honour which was disputed over, and he became furious when they wished to relieve him after his regulation two hours of labour. He robbed his mates of their turn, and refused to let go the pick. His gallery was soon in advance of the others. He fought against the coal so fiercely that his breath could be heard coming from the tube like the roar of a forge within his breast. When he came out, black and muddy, dizzy with fatigue, he fell to the ground and had to be wrapped up in a covering. Then, still tottering, he plunged back again, and the struggle began anew--the low, deep blows, the stifled groans, the victorious fury of massacre. The worst was that the coal now became hard; he twice broke his tool, and was exasperated that he could not get on so fast. He suffered also from the heat, which increased with every metre of advance, and was unbearable at the end of this narrow hole where the air could not circulate. A hand ventilator worked well, but aeration was so inadequate that on three occasions it was necessary to take out fainting hewers who were being asphyxiated."
"Pierron, en effet, semblait gaillard, le teint fleuri, la chair grasse. Vainement il soufflait, pour faire l’homme malade. D’ailleurs, la Maheude, en entrant, venait de sentir une forte odeur de lapin : bien sûr qu’on avait déménagé le plat. Des miettes traînaient sur la table ; et, au beau milieu, elle aperçut une bouteille de vin oubliée.","Pierron, in fact, seemed sprightly, with a flowery complexion and plump flesh. In vain he breathed, to make the man sick. Besides, Maheude, on entering, had just smelled a strong odor of rabbit: of course the dish had been moved. Crumbs lay on the table; and, right in the middle, she saw a forgotten bottle of wine.","Pierron did indeed seem to be in fine form; he had a good colour, and there was plenty of flesh on him. He pretended without success to wheeze like a sick man. In any case La Maheude had noticed a strong smell of rabbit as she came in: but of course they had cleared everything away! There were still crumbs on the table, and right in the middle stood a bottle of wine they had forgotten to remove.","Pierron, in fact, looked very well; his complexion was good and his flesh fat.

"Encore un jour, et encore un jour. Étienne, à chaque frisson de l’eau, recevait un léger coup de l’homme qu’il avait tué, le simple coudoiement d’un voisin qui rappelait sa présence. Et, toutes les fois, il tressaillait. Continuellement, il le voyait, gonflé, verdi, avec ses moustaches rouges, dans sa face broyée. Puis, il ne se souvenait plus, il ne l’avait pas tué, l’autre nageait et allait le mordre. Catherine, maintenant, était secouée de crises de larmes, longues, interminables, après lesquelles un accablement l’anéantissait. Elle finit par tomber dans un état de somnolence invincible. Il la réveillait, elle bégayait des mots, elle se rendormait tout de suite, sans même soulever les paupières ; et, de crainte qu’elle ne se noyât, il lui avait passé un bras à la taille. C’était, lui, maintenant, qui répondait aux camarades. Les coups de rivelaine approchaient, il les entendait derrière son dos. Mais ses forces diminuaient aussi, il avait perdu tout courage à taper. On les savait là, pourquoi se fatiguer encore ? Cela ne l’intéressait plus, qu’on pût venir. Dans l’hébétement de son attente, il en était, pendant des heures, à oublier ce qu’il attendait.","One more day, and one more day. Étienne, at each shiver of the water, received a light blow from the man he had killed, the simple nudge of a neighbor which reminded him of his presence. And, every time, he quivered. Continually he saw him, swollen, green, with his red mustaches, in his crushed face. Then, he couldn't remember, he hadn't killed him, the other was swimming and was going to bite him. Catherine was now shaken by long, interminable outbursts of tears, after which she was crushed by exhaustion. Eventually she fell into a state of invincible drowsiness. He woke her up, she stammered out words, she went back to sleep right away, without even lifting her eyelids; and, lest she should drown, he had put his arm around her waist. It was he, now, who answered the comrades. The blows of the riverwool were approaching, he heard them behind his back. But his strength was also diminishing, he had lost all courage to type. We knew they were there, why bother again? It no longer interested him that we could come. In the daze of his expectation, he was, for hours, forgetting what he was waiting for.","Another day went by, and another. With each little wave Étienne could feel the man he had killed gently bumping against him in the water, like a companion nudging him quietly to remind him of his presence. And each time he would give a shudder. He kept seeing him in his mind’s eye, all green and bloated, with his squashed face and his red moustache. Then he couldn’t remember any more and began to think he hadn’t killed him, that this was Chaval swimming in the water and about to bite him. Catherine now cried constantly for long periods at a time, after which she would lapse, exhausted, into semi-consciousness. Eventually she fell into a deep sleep from which it was impossible to rouse her. Étienne would wake her up, and she would mumble incoherently before going straight back to sleep, sometimes without even opening her eyes; and he had now put his arm round her waist in case she slid off and drowned. It fell to him to reply to the comrades. The sound of the picks was getting closer, from somewhere behind his back. But his own strength was failing, and he had lost the will to tap.

The long wait had left him in such a dazed state that for hours at a time he would quite forget what it was he was actually waiting for.","A day passed, and again another day. At every shiver of the water Étienne perceived a slight blow from the man he had killed, the simple elbowing of a neighbour who is reminding you of his presence. And every time it came he shuddered. He continually saw it there, swollen, greenish, with the red moustache and the crushed face. Then he no longer remembered; he had not killed him; the other man was swimming and trying to bite him. Catherine was now shaken by long endless fits of crying, after which she was completely prostrated. She fell at last into a condition of irresistible drowsiness. He would arouse her, but she stammered a few words and at once fell asleep again without even raising her eyelids; and fearing lest she should be drowned, he put his arm round her waist. It was he now who replied to the mates. The blows of the pick were now approaching, he could hear them behind his back. But his strength, too, was diminishing; he had lost all courage to strike. They were known to be there; why weary oneself more? It no longer interested him whether they came or not. In the stupefaction of waiting he would forget for hours at a time what he was waiting for."

They were mostly putter lads and banksmen, but there were pit-boys of fourteen too; in short the entire youth of the pits, and all of them drinking more gin than beer.

Already doors were closing, dark files of workmen were moving away into the night.

Already there was the sound of doors being shut, and the shadowy outlines of workers could be seen filing off into the night. But what was she thinking of standing here getting cold like this? Pierron was bound to be asleep still, he wasn’t due to start his shift till six o’clock! And yet she waited, watching the house on the other side of the gardens. The door opened, and her interest quickened.

Already doors were being closed, and black files of workers passed into the night.

"Mais Négrel eut un cri de douleur. M. Hennebeau, qui avait reculé, pleura. Le désastre n’était pas complet, une berge se rompit, et le canal se versa d’un coup, en une nappe bouillonnante, dans une des gerçures. Il y disparaissait, il y tombait comme une cataracte dans une vallée profonde. La mine buvait cette rivière, l’inondation maintenant submergeait les galeries pour des années. Bientôt, le cratère s’emplit, un lac d’eau boueuse occupa la place où était naguère le Voreux, pareil à ces lacs sous lesquels dorment des villes maudites.

Soon the crater began to fill; and where once Le Voreux had been, there now lay an expanse of muddy water, like one of those lakes in which doomed cities lie submerged. A terrified silence had fallen, and all that could be heard was the sound of the water pouring down and rumbling through the bowels of the earth.","A cry of pain escaped Négrel. M.

L’avenue de vieux tilleuls : une voûte de feuillage de trois cents mètres, plantée de la grille au perron, était une des curiosités de cette plaine rase, où l’on comptait les grands arbres, de Marchiennes à Beaugnies.","The Grégoire property, La Piolaine, was two kilometers from Montsou, to the east, on the road to Joiselle. It was a large square house, without style, built at the beginning of the last century. Of the vast lands that first depended on it, only about thirty hectares remained, walled and easy to maintain. We especially mentioned the orchard and the vegetable garden, famous for their fruits and vegetables, the most beautiful in the country. Besides, the park was missing, a small wood took its place. The avenue of old lime trees: a canopy of three hundred meters, planted from the gate to the steps, was one of the curiosities of this flat plain, where there were tall trees, from Marchiennes to Beaugnies.","The Grégoire property, La Piolaine, was to be found two kilometres east of Montsou, on the road to Joiselle. It was a tall, square house of no particular style, dating from the beginning of the previous century. Of the vast estates that had originally belonged to it only some thirty hectares remained, which were surrounded by walls and easy to maintain. The orchard and kitchen garden enjoyed especial renown, since their fruit and vegetables were celebrated as the finest in the region. For the rest, there was no parkland, but a little wood served in its stead. The avenue of old limes, a vault of foliage running three hundred metres from the gate to the front steps, was one of the sights on this bare and empty plain, where the number of large trees to be found between Marchiennes and Beaugnies was sufficiently small to be calculated exactly.","THE Grégoires' property, Piolaine, was situated two kilometres to the east of Montsou, on the Joiselle road.

"Vainement, la jeune fille protestait, parlait de Jeanlin. Sans entendre, la Maheude s’était élancée. Et, en voyant le fourgon qui débouchait devant l’église, elle avait défailli, toute pâle. Sur les portes, des femmes, muettes de saisissement, allongeaient le cou, tandis que d’autres suivaient, tremblantes à l’idée de savoir devant quelle maison s’arrêterait le cortège.","Vainly, the young girl protested, spoke of Jeanlin. Without hearing, Maheude had rushed forward. And, seeing the van coming out in front of the church, she fainted, quite pale. At the doors, women, mute with shock, craned their necks, while others followed, trembling at the idea of knowing in front of which house the procession would stop.","The girl tried in vain to say it wasn’t and to tell her about Jeanlin. But La Maheude wasn’t listening, she had already rushed out of the house. When she saw the wagon emerge opposite the church, she faltered and turned deathly pale. From every doorway women stared in silent shock, craning their necks to see, while others followed, fearful to discover which house the procession would stop at.","The young girl protested in vain, speaking of Jeanlin. Without hearing her, Maheude had rushed forward. And on seeing the van, which was passing before the church, she grew faint and pale. The women at their doors, mute with terror, were stretching out their necks, while others followed, trembling as they wondered before whose house the procession would stop."
"Ils s’attablaient enfin, le chocolat fumait dans les bols, on ne parla longtemps que de la brioche. Mélanie et Honorine restaient, donnaient les détails sur la cuisson, les regardaient se bourrer, les lèvres grasses, en disant que c’était un plaisir de faire un gâteau, quand on voyait les maîtres le manger si volontiers.","They finally sat down, the chocolate was smoking in the bowls, we talked for a long time only about the brioche. Mélanie and Honorine stayed, gave the details of the baking, watched them stuff themselves, with greasy lips, saying that it was a pleasure to bake a cake, when you saw the masters eating it so willingly.","They finally took their places at the table; the chocolate was steaming in the bowls, and for some time the sole subject of conversation was the brioche. Mélanie and Honorine remained in the room, talking about how the baking had gone and watching them all tuck in with buttery lips. What a pleasure it was to cook, they said, when you saw your master and his family eating with such relish.","They sat down to table at last with the smoking chocolate in their cups, and for a long time talked of nothing but the brioche. Mélanie and Honorine remained to give details about the cooking and watched them stuffing themselves with greasy lips, saying that it was a pleasure to make a cake when one saw the masters enjoying it so much."
"Des femmes la suivaient. La Maheude se hâta pour les empêcher de tout casser, de même que son homme avait voulu raisonner les camarades. Elle était la plus calme, on pouvait exiger son droit, sans faire du dégât chez le monde. Lorsqu’elle entra dans le bâtiment des chaudières, les femmes en chassaient déjà les deux chauffeurs, et la Brûlé, armée d’une grande pelle, accroupie devant un des foyers, le vidait violemment, jetait le charbon incandescent sur le carreau de briques, où il continuait à brûler avec une fumée noire. Il y avait dix foyers pour les cinq générateurs. Bientôt, les femmes s’y acharnèrent, la Levaque manœuvrant sa pelle des deux mains, la Mouquette se retroussant jusqu’aux cuisses afin de ne pas s’allumer, toutes sanglantes dans le reflet d’incendie, suantes et échevelées de cette cuisine de sabbat. Les tas de houille montaient, la chaleur ardente gerçait le plafond de la vaste salle.","Women followed her. Maheude hastened to prevent them from breaking everything, just as her man had wanted to reason with the comrades. She was the calmest, you could demand your right, without doing any harm to people. When she entered the boiler building, the women were already chasing the two stokers away, and La Brûlé, armed with a large shovel, crouching in front of one of the hearths, was emptying it violently, throwing the incandescent coal on the brick floor, where it continued to burn with black smoke. There were ten homes for the five generators. Soon the women were bent on it, La Levaque maneuvering her shovel with both hands, La Mouquette rolling up up to her thighs so as not to light up, all bloody in the reflection of the fire, sweating and disheveled from this kitchen of Sabbath. The heaps of coal rose, the burning heat cracked the ceiling of the vast room.","Other women followed her. La Maheude hurried to stop them wrecking everything, just as her husband had tried to reason with the comrades. She was the calmest person present: they could demand their rights without destroying people’s property. When she entered the boiler-room, the women were already chasing the two stokers out, and La Brûlé, armed with a large shovel, was squatting in front of one of the boilers and emptying it as fast as she could, throwing the red-hot coal on to the brick floor, where it continued to smoulder. There were ten fire-grates for five boilers. Soon all the women had set to, La Levaque with both hands on her shovel, La Mouquette hoisting her skirts so that she didn’t catch fire, all of them dishevelled and covered in sweat, and all bathed in the blood-red glow coming from the fires of this witches’ sabbath. As the burning embers were piled higher and higher, the fierce heat began to crack the ceiling of the vast room.","Some women followed her. Maheude hastened to prevent them from smashing everything, just as her husband had tried to reason with the men.

"Alors, la bataille s’aggrava. Rasseneur, révolté, serait intervenu de nouveau, sans le regard sévère de sa femme, qui le maintenait : est-ce que deux clients n’avaient pas le droit de régler une affaire chez eux ? Il s’était mis simplement devant la cheminée, car il craignait de les voir se culbuter dans le feu. Souvarine, de son air paisible, avait roulé une cigarette, qu’il oubliait cependant d’allumer. Contre le mur, Catherine restait immobile ; ses mains seules, inconscientes, venaient de monter à sa taille ; et, là, elles s’étaient tordues, elles arrachaient l’étoffe de sa robe, dans des crispations régulières. Tout son effort était de ne pas crier, de ne pas en tuer un, en criant sa préférence, si éperdue d’ailleurs, qu’elle ne savait même plus qui elle préférait.","So the battle escalated. Rasseneur, outraged, would have intervened again, had it not been for his wife's stern gaze, which kept him going: didn't two customers have the right to settle a matter at home? He had simply placed himself in front of the fireplace, for he feared to see them tumbling over in the fire. Souvarine, in his peaceful manner, had rolled a cigarette, which he forgot, however, to light. Against the wall, Catherine remained motionless; his hands alone, unconscious, had just risen to his waist; and there they had twisted, they tore the fabric of her dress, in regular contractions. All her effort was not to shout, not to kill one, by shouting her preference, so desperate, moreover, that she no longer even knew who she preferred.","The fight now grew fiercer. Rasseneur was sickened and would again have tried to intervene if his wife had not dissuaded him with a stern look: surely two customers were entitled to settle their differences here? So he had merely placed himself in front of the fireplace, for fear they might topple in. With his usual calm air Souvarine had rolled himself a cigarette, but he omitted to light it. Catherine was still standing motionless against the wall: only her hands had moved, rising unbidden to her waist, where they had writhed and begun to tear at her dress in recurrent spasms of nervous anxiety. It took her all her strength not to cry out, not to be the death of one man by proclaiming her preference for the other, though in fact she was so distraught that she no longer knew which one that might be.","Then the struggle became serious. Rasseneur was disgusted, and would again have interfered, but a severe look from his wife held him back: had not two customers a right to settle an affair in the house? He simply placed himself before the fireplace, for fear lest they should tumble over into it. Souvarine, in his quiet way, had rolled a cigarette, but he forgot to light it. Catherine was motionless against the wall; only her hands had unconsciously risen to her waist, and with constant fidgeting movements were twisting and tearing at the stuff of her dress. She was striving as hard as possible not to cry out, and so, perhaps, kill one of them by declaring her preference; but she was, too, so distracted that she did not even know which she preferred."
– Monsieur… Ah ! Monsieur s’est enfermé…,“Sir… Ah! Sir locked himself in...,"‘Monsieur…Ah, Monsieur has locked the door…’","""Sir--Ah! you are shut in, sir."""
"Catherine le regarda un moment en silence. Elle devait le trouver joli, avec son visage fin et ses moustaches noires. Vaguement, elle souriait de plaisir.","Catherine looked at him for a moment in silence. She must have found him handsome, with his fine face and black mustaches. Vaguely, she smiled with pleasure.","Catherine watched him for a moment in silence. She must have found him good-looking, with his delicate features and black moustache. She had a vague smile on her face, a smile of pleasure.","Catherine looked at him a moment in silence. She must have found him handsome, with his delicate face and black moustache. She vaguely smiled with pleasure."
"Machinalement, M. Hennebeau, qui voulait voir, remonta au second étage, dans la chambre de Paul : c’était la mieux placée, à gauche, car elle permettait d’enfiler la route, jusqu’aux Chantiers de la Compagnie. Et il se tint derrière la persienne, dominant la foule. Mais cette chambre l’avait saisi de nouveau, la table de toilette épongée et en ordre, le lit froid, aux draps nets et bien tirés. Toute sa rage de l’après-midi, cette furieuse bataille au fond du grand silence de sa solitude, aboutissait maintenant à une immense fatigue. Son être était déjà comme cette chambre, refroidi, balayé des ordures du matin, rentré dans la correction d’usage. À quoi bon un scandale ? est-ce que rien était changé chez lui ? Sa femme avait simplement un amant de plus, cela aggravait à peine le fait, qu’elle l’eût choisi dans la famille ; et peut-être même y avait-il avantage, car elle sauvegardait ainsi les apparences. Il se prenait en pitié, au souvenir de sa folie jalouse. Quel ridicule, d’avoir assommé ce lit à coups de poing ! Puisqu’il avait toléré un autre homme, il tolérerait bien celui-là. Ce ne serait que l’affaire d’un peu de mépris encore. Une amertume affreuse lui empoisonnait la bouche, l’inutilité de tout, l’éternelle douleur de l’existence, la honte de lui-même, qui adorait et désirait toujours cette femme, dans la saleté où il l’abandonnait.","Mechanically, M. Hennebeau, who wanted to see, went up to the second floor, to Paul's room: it was the best placed, on the left, for it allowed the road to be followed as far as the Chantiers de la Compagnie. And he stood behind the shutter, dominating the crowd. But this room had seized him again, the dressing table mopped up and in order, the bed cold, with the sheets neat and well drawn. All his rage of the afternoon, this furious battle in the depths of the great silence of his solitude, now resulted in an immense fatigue. His being was already like this room, chilled, swept away from the morning garbage, returned to the usual correction. What good is a scandal? was nothing changed in him? His wife merely had one more lover, it hardly made the matter worse, that she had chosen him in the family; and perhaps there was even an advantage, for she thus kept up appearances. He took pity on the memory of his jealous madness. How ridiculous, to knock that bed out with his fists! Since he had tolerated another man, he would tolerate this one well. It would only be a matter of a little more contempt. A dreadful bitterness poisoned his mouth, the uselessness of everything, the eternal pain of existence, the shame of himself, who still adored and desired this woman, in the filth in which he abandoned her.","Wanting to observe what was going on, M. Hennebeau made his way up to the second floor and, without thinking, into Paul’s bedroom: being on the left-hand side of the house, it was the best place because it afforded a clear view down the road as far as the Company yards. And there he stood, behind the shutters, overlooking the crowd. But once again his attention was caught by the state of the room: the wash-stand had been tidied and cleaned, and the bed was now cold, its crisp sheets neatly tucked in. All the rage he had felt that afternoon and the furious row he had conducted in total silence inside his own head had now given way to an immense fatigue. His whole being was like this room, cooler, swept clean of the morning’s filth, and restored to its usual state of propriety. Why cause a scandal? Had anything changed between them? His wife had simply taken one more lover, and it barely made matters worse that she should have chosen him from among the family; indeed perhaps it was even better that she had, for it preserved appearances. How pathetic he had been, he thought, remembering his wild fit of jealousy. How ridiculous he had been, pounding the bed with his fists like that! He had already put up with one man, so why not this one too! It would mean only that he despised her that little bit more. It all left a bitter taste in his mouth, the terrible pointlessness of everything, the endless pain and suffering of living, the shame at himself for still adoring and wanting the woman in the midst of this filth, which he was doing nothing to prevent.","Mechanically, M. Hennebeau, who wished to look out, went up to Paul's room on the second floor: it was on the left, the best situated, for it commanded the road as far as the Company's Yards. And he stood behind the blinds overlooking the crowd. But this room had again overcome him, the toilet table sponged and in order, the cold bed with neat and well-drawn sheets. All his rage of the afternoon, that furious battle in the depths of his silent solitude, had now turned to an immense fatigue. His whole being was now like this room, grown cold, swept of the filth of the morning, returned to its habitual correctness. What was the good of a scandal? had anything really changed in his house? His wife had simply taken another lover; that she had chosen him in the family scarcely aggravated the fact; perhaps even it was an advantage, for she thus preserved appearances. He pitied himself when he thought of his mad jealousy. How ridiculous to have struck that bed with his fists! Since he had tolerated another man, he could certainly tolerate this one. It was only a matter of a little more contempt. A terrible bitterness was poisoning his mouth, the uselessness of everything, the eternal pain of existence, shame for himself who always adored and desired this woman in the dirt in which he had abandoned her."
"Bonnemort était là, seul, les yeux larges et fixes, cloué sur une chaise, devant la cheminée froide. Autour de lui, la salle paraissait plus grande, sans le coucou, sans les meubles de sapin verni, qui l’animaient autrefois ; et il ne restait, dans la crudité verdâtre des murs, que les portraits de l’empereur et de l’impératrice, dont les lèvres roses souriaient avec une bienveillance officielle. Le vieux ne bougeait pas, ne clignait pas les paupières sous le coup de lumière de la porte, l’air imbécile, comme s’il n’avait pas même vu entrer tout ce monde. À ses pieds, se trouvait son plat garni de cendre, ainsi qu’on en met aux chats, pour leurs ordures.","Bonnemort was there, alone, his eyes wide and staring, nailed to a chair in front of the cold fireplace. Around him, the room seemed larger, without the cuckoo clock, without the varnished fir furniture, which formerly animated it; and there remained, in the greenish crudeness of the walls, only the portraits of the Emperor and Empress, whose rosy lips smiled with official benevolence. The old man didn't move, didn't blink his eyelids at the light from the door, looking stupid, as if he hadn't even seen everyone enter. At her feet lay her dish filled with ashes, such as they give to cats for their refuse.","There was Bonnemort, alone, sitting on a chair in front of the empty grate and staring into space. Around him the room looked bigger now, devoid of the cheering presence of the cuckoo clock and the varnished pine furniture; all that remained, hanging against the crude green walls, were the portraits of the Emperor and Empress, their pink lips smiling down with an official air of benevolence. The old man did not move, nor did his eyelids blink at the sudden light from the doorway; rather he sat with an imbecilic air as if he had not even seen all these people come in. At his feet lay his plate of ash, like a litter-tray set down for a cat.","Bonnemort was there alone, with large fixed eyes, nailed to his chair in front of the cold fireplace.

"Après avoir vu disparaître la calèche, d’où ses filles lui riaient encore, il était revenu à la fosse, repris d’une vague inquiétude. Tout pourtant s’y trouvait en bon ordre, la descente avait eu lieu, l’extraction fonctionnait, et il se rassurait de nouveau, il causait avec le maître porion, lorsqu’on lui avait signalé l’approche des grévistes. Vivement, il s’était posté à une fenêtre du criblage ; et, devant ce flot grossissant qui envahissait le carreau, il avait eu la conscience immédiate de son impuissance. Comment défendre ces bâtiments ouverts de toutes parts ? À peine aurait-il pu grouper une vingtaine de ses ouvriers autour de lui. Il était perdu.","After seeing the carriage disappear, from which his daughters were still laughing at him, he returned to the pit, seized with a vague uneasiness. Everything was there, however, in good order, the descent had taken place, the extraction was working, and he reassured himself again, he was chatting with the foreman, when he had been informed of the approach of the strikers. Hastily he posted himself at a window of the sifting; and, faced with this growing flood which invaded the windowpane, he had had the immediate awareness of his impotence. How to defend these buildings open on all sides? He could hardly have gathered about twenty of his workers around him. He was lost.","Having seen the carriage depart with his daughters gaily bidding him farewell, he had returned to the pit, filled with renewed unease. Yet everything seemed to be in order: the workers had gone down, the extraction of coal was proceeding, and he was beginning to take heart once more as he chatted with the overman when someone told him about the approaching strikers. He had at once taken up a position by the window in the screening-shed; and as the swelling crowd poured into the yard, he was immediately aware of his powerlessness. How could he defend these buildings that were open on all sides to anyone who cared to enter? He could barely have mustered twenty workers to protect him. He was lost.","After having watched the disappearance of the carriage, from which his daughters were still laughing towards him, he had returned to the pit overtaken by a strange anxiety.

"Une acclamation roula jusqu’à lui, du fond de la forêt. La lune, maintenant, blanchissait toute la clairière, découpait en arêtes vives la houle des têtes, jusqu’aux lointains confus des taillis, entre les grands troncs grisâtres. Et c’était, sous l’air glacial, une furie de visages, des yeux luisants, des bouches ouvertes, tout un rut de peuple, les hommes, les femmes, les enfants, affamés et lâchés au juste pillage de l’antique bien dont on les dépossédait. Ils ne sentaient plus le froid, ces ardentes paroles les avaient chauffés aux entrailles. Une exaltation religieuse les soulevait de terre, la fièvre d’espoir des premiers chrétiens de l’Église, attendant le règne prochain de la justice. Bien des phrases obscures leur avaient échappé, ils n’entendaient guère ces raisonnements techniques et abstraits ; mais l’obscurité même, l’abstraction élargissait encore le champ des promesses, les enlevait dans un éblouissement. Quel rêve ! être les maîtres, cesser de souffrir, jouir enfin !","A cheer rolled up to him from the depths of the forest. The moon now whitened the whole clearing, cut the swell of heads into sharp ridges, even to the confused distances of the copses, between the great greyish trunks. And there was, under the icy air, a fury of faces, gleaming eyes, open mouths, a whole rut of people, men, women, children, starving and unleashed on the just looting of the ancient well from which they were dispossessed. They no longer felt the cold, these ardent words had warmed their entrails. A religious exaltation lifted them from the ground, the fever of hope of the first Christians of the Church, awaiting the approaching reign of justice. Many obscure phrases had escaped them, they hardly understood these technical and abstract reasonings; but obscurity itself, abstraction still widened the field of promises, carried them away in a dazzle. What a dream ! be the masters, stop suffering, finally enjoy!","The roar of acclamation rolled towards him from the depths of the forest. The whole clearing was now bathed in the pale light of the moon, and the sea of faces resolved itself into sharply delineated rows that stretched away beyond the tall grey tree-trunks into the darker recesses of the forest. Here in the freezing cold there swirled a tide of angry expressions, of shining eyes and bared teeth, a pack of starving humanity, of men, women and children unleashed upon the rightful pillage of ancient property that others had taken from them. They no longer felt the cold, for this fiery oratory had warmed them to the cockles of their hearts. They were borne up on a wave of religious exaltation, filled with the feverish expectancy of the early Christians living in hope of the new age of justice. Many obscure phrases had passed them by, and they understood little of all the more technical and abstract arguments; but the very obscurity and abstraction of the speech simply enhanced the vista of a promised land and dazzled them into agreement. What a vision! To be the masters! To know an end to suffering! To live and enjoy life at last!","The cheering rolled up to him from the depths of the forest. The moon now whitened the whole of the glade, and cut into living waves the sea of heads, as far as the dimly visible copses in the distance between the great grey trunks.

What a dream! to be masters, to suffer no more, to enjoy at last!"

"À ce moment, la fosse était vide, il n’y rencontra qu’un porion, les yeux gros de sommeil. On devait chauffer seulement à deux heures, pour la reprise du travail. D’abord, il monta prendre au fond d’une armoire une veste qu’il feignait d’avoir oubliée.

"À l’accrochage, Richomme, venu en avant, avait donné l’ordre qu’une cage vide fût réservée. Pierron emballa tout de suite les deux berlines.

"Maheu approuvait, lorsque le père Mouque, justement, arriva de Réquillart. On voulut l’empêcher de passer.

And, a quarter of an hour later, as the band of strikers, little by little swelled, became threatening, a large door reopened on the ground floor, men appeared, carrying the dead animal, a lamentable package, again tight in the rope net, which they abandoned in the middle of the puddles of melted snow.

"Cependant, Catherine fit un effort désespéré. Elle s’étirait, elle crispait ses deux mains dans ses cheveux roux, qui lui embroussaillaient le front et la nuque.

"Il ne comprenait bien qu’une chose : le puits avalait des hommes par bouchées de vingt et de trente, et d’un coup de gosier si facile, qu’il semblait ne pas les sentir passer.

Without a sound, with the soft spurt of a nocturnal beast, the iron cage rose from the blackness, wedged itself on the bolts, with its four floors each containing two sedans full of coal. Moulins, at the different levels, took out the sedans, replaced them with others, empty or loaded in advance with pruning timber. And it was in the empty sedans that the workers piled up, five by five, up to forty at a time, when they held all the boxes. An order came from the megaphone, a dull and indistinct bellow, while the signal cord was pulled four times from below, ""ringing meat"", to warn of this load of human flesh.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble--sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen--could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered--when they had killed their despot. As soon as he spoke to them of razing society to the ground like a ripe harvest--as soon as he even pronounced the infantile word ""republic""--he felt that he was misunderstood and a disturber, henceforth unclassed, enrolled among the lost leaders of cosmopolitan revolution. His patriotic heart struggled, however, and it was with painful bitterness that he repeated his favourite expression:"

"Ce n’étaient plus les blés, ni l’odeur des herbes, ni le chant des alouettes, ni le grand soleil jaune ; c’étaient la mine éboulée, inondée, la nuit puante, l’égouttement funèbre de ce caveau où ils râlaient depuis tant de jours.

She was back in the mine with its rock-falls and floods, back in the stench-filled darkness and listening to the lugubrious sound of dripping water, down in this cave where they had lain dying for so many days. The tricks played by her senses now made it all seem even more horrific. Once again she fell prey to the superstitions of her childhood and saw the Black Man, the old miner whose ghost haunted the pit and strangled the life out of naughty girls.","It was no longer the meadows, the odour of the grass, the song of larks, the great yellow sun; it was the fallen, inundated mine, the stinking gloom, the melancholy dripping of this cellar where they had been groaning for so many days.

"Mais deux hommes, de nouveau, arrivaient, et l’enfant étouffa encore un juron, quand il entendit la voix de son frère Zacharie, en train de raconter à Mouquet comment il avait découvert une pièce de quarante sous, cousue dans une jupe de sa femme. Tous deux ricanaient d’aise, en se tapant sur les épaules. Mouquet eut l’idée d’une grande partie de crosse pour le lendemain : on partirait à deux heures de l’Avantage, on irait du côté de Montoire, près de Marchiennes. Zacharie accepta. Qu’est-ce qu’on avait à les embêter avec la grève ? autant rigoler, puisqu’on ne fichait rien ! Et ils tournaient le coin de la route, lorsque Étienne, qui venait du canal, les arrêta et se mit à causer.","But two men again arrived, and the child still stifled a curse when he heard the voice of his brother Zacharie, telling Mouquet how he had discovered a forty-sou piece, sewn into a skirt of her wife. Both snickered happily, patting each other on the shoulders. Mouquet had the idea of a big game of lacrosse for the next day: we would leave at two o'clock from L'Avantage, we would go towards Montoire, near Marchiennes. Zacharie accepted. Why bother them with the strike? we might as well laugh, since we weren't doing anything! And they were turning the corner of the road, when Étienne, who was coming from the canal, stopped them and began to talk.","But once again two men were coming, and Jeanlin suppressed a further oath when he heard the voice of his brother Zacharie, who was busy telling Mouquet how he’d found a two-franc piece sewn into one of his wife’s skirts. The pair were laughing cheerfully and clapping each other on the back. Mouquet suggested a full-scale game of crosse the next day: they would set out from the Advantage at two and head for Montoire, near Marchiennes. Zacharie agreed. What did they want to be bothered with this strike for, anyway? May as well have fun since there was nothing else to do! And they were just turning the corner when Étienne appeared from the direction of the canal and stopped to talk to them.","But once more two men appeared, and the child again stifled an oath when he heard the voice of his brother Zacharie narrating to Mouquet how he had discovered a two-franc piece sewn into one of his wife's petticoats.

De nouveau, il voyageait dans un dédale d’escaliers et de couloirs obscurs, où les pieds nus faisaient un bruit mou de vieux chaussons. Mais la lampisterie flamboya, une pièce vitrée, emplie de râteliers qui alignaient par étages des centaines de lampes Davy, visitées, lavées de la veille, allumées comme des cierges au fond d’une chapelle ardente. Au guichet, chaque ouvrier prenait la sienne, poinçonnée à son chiffre ; puis, il l’examinait, la fermait lui-même ; pendant que le marqueur, assis à une table, inscrivait sur le registre l’heure de la descente.","Catherine, who was warming her hands, had to follow the gang.

It was full of shelves stacked with row upon row of Davy lamps, hundreds of them, which had been inspected and cleaned the night before and now burned like candles in a memorial chapel.

"Ses yeux allèrent de la gorge au visage. Brusquement, il reconnut le petit soldat : c’était Jules, la recrue, avec qui il avait causé, un matin. Et une grande pitié le saisit, en face de cette douce figure blonde, criblée de taches de rousseur. Les yeux bleus, largement ouverts, regardaient le ciel, de ce regard fixe dont il lui avait vu chercher à l’horizon le pays natal. Où se trouvait-il, ce Plogof, qui lui apparaissait dans un éblouissement de soleil ? Là-bas, là-bas. La mer hurlait de loin, par cette nuit d’ouragan. Ce vent qui passait si haut avait peut-être soufflé sur la lande. Deux femmes étaient debout, la mère, la sœur, tenant leurs coiffes emportées, regardant, elles aussi, comme si elles avaient pu voir ce que faisait à cette heure le petit, au-delà des lieues qui les séparaient. Elles l’attendraient toujours, maintenant. Quelle abominable chose, de se tuer entre pauvres diables, pour les riches !","His eyes went from his throat to his face. Suddenly he recognized the little soldier: it was Jules, the recruit, with whom he had talked one morning. And a great pity seized him, faced with that sweet blond face, riddled with freckles. The blue eyes, wide open, gazed up at the sky with that fixed gaze which he had seen him searching the horizon for his native country. Where was he, this Plogof, who appeared to him in a dazzling sunlight? Over there, over there. The sea howled from afar, on this hurricane night. This wind which passed so high had perhaps blown on the moor. Two women were standing, the mother, the sister, holding their loose headdresses, also looking, as if they could see what the little one was doing at this hour, beyond the leagues that separated them. They would still be waiting for him now. What an abominable thing, to kill one another among the poor devils, for the rich!","His eyes travelled up from the throat to the face. All of a sudden he recognized the young soldier: it was Jules, the raw recruit he had spoken to one morning.

Where was this Plogoff that had appeared to him as in a sundrenched vision? Somewhere over yonder. Far away the sea would be roaring on this stormy night. Perhaps this gale that was passing so high above them had already swept across his moorland. Two women would be standing there, the mother and the sister, holding on to their bonnets in the wind and gazing into the distance as if they, too, might see far enough and discover what the boy was doing all those miles away. Now they would wait for ever. What a truly dreadful thing it was that poor devils should kill each other like this and all on account of the rich!","His eyes went from the throat to the face.

"Dès ce moment, une rage l’emporta. Les haleines de l’invisible le grisaient, l’horreur noire de ce trou battu d’une averse le jetait à une fureur de destruction. Il s’acharna au hasard contre le cuvelage, tapant où il pouvait, à coups de vilebrequin, à coups de scie, pris du besoin de l’éventrer tout de suite sur sa tête. Et il y mettait une férocité, comme s’il eût joué du couteau dans la peau d’un être vivant, qu’il exécrait.

He would kill it in the end, this foul beast that was Le Voreux, with its ever-gaping maw that had devoured so much human fodder.

"– C’était fatal, dit Deneulin, la prospérité trop grande des dernières années devait nous amener là… Songez donc aux énormes capitaux immobilisés, aux chemins de fer, aux ports et aux canaux, à tout l’argent enfoui dans les spéculations les plus folles. Rien que chez nous, on a installé des sucreries comme si le département devait donner trois récoltes de betteraves… Et, dame ! aujourd’hui, l’argent s’est fait rare, il faut attendre qu’on rattrape l’intérêt des millions dépensés : de là, un engorgement mortel et la stagnation finale des affaires.","“It was fatal,” said Deneulin, “the too great prosperity of the last few years must have brought us there. crazy.

Even round here they’ve built so many sugar-refineries you’d think the region was producing three beet harvests a year…And now money’s scarce, of course, and people have got to wait for a return on all the millions they’ve spent.

Those who wanted to work held their lamp, barefoot, shovel or rivelaine under their arm; while the others, still in clogs, their overcoats over their shoulders because of the great cold, blocked the well; and the captains had become hoarse trying to put things in order, begging them to be reasonable, not to prevent those who had the good will from getting off.","That morning Chaval had arrived first, as early as three o’clock, and had gone round sowing the seed of dissent among his comrades and trying to persuade them that they ought to imitate the Montsou miners and demand an increase of five centimes per tub.

In the great hall, which was still clean and pristine, normal activity was in a state of suspended animation: the winding-engine, fully primed, was letting off little whistles of steam; the cages hung from motionless cables; and the tubs, abandoned in mid-journey, were cluttering up the cast-iron floor.

Farther on, a man came across them, but he was drunk, and moved away abusing them. At last they reached the old pit, bathed in perspiration, and so exhausted that their teeth were chattering."
"Jusque-là, Étienne avait évité le Voreux, inquiété par l’éternelle silhouette noire de la sentinelle, plantée sur le terri, au-dessus de la plaine. On ne pouvait l’éviter, elle dominait, elle était, en l’air, comme le drapeau du régiment. Vers trois heures du matin, le ciel devint sombre, il se rendit à la fosse, où des camarades lui expliquèrent le mauvais état du cuvelage : même leur idée était qu’il y avait urgence à le refaire en entier, ce qui aurait arrêté l’extraction pendant trois mois. Longtemps, il rôda, écoutant les maillets des charpentiers taper dans le puits. Cela lui réjouissait le cœur, cette plaie qu’il fallait panser.","Until then, Étienne had avoided the Voreux, disturbed by the eternal black silhouette of the sentinel, planted on the terri, above the plain. It could not be avoided, it dominated, it was, in the air, like the flag of the regiment. Around three o'clock in the morning, the sky became dark, he went to the pit, where some comrades explained to him the poor state of the casing: even their idea was that it was urgent to redo it completely, which would have stopped the extraction for three months. For a long time he prowled, listening to the carpenters' mallets tapping into the well. It rejoiced his heart, this wound that had to be healed.","Until then Étienne had avoided Le Voreux, unnerved by the ever-present black silhouette of the sentry up on the spoil-heap, overlooking the plain. You couldn’t miss him, planted there against the sky like the regiment’s flag and dominating the landscape. Towards three o’clock in the morning the sky grew very dark, and Étienne went over to the pit, where some comrades briefed him on the poor state of the shaft lining: indeed in their view the whole thing needed to be replaced immediately, which would have meant halting production for three months. He wandered around for a long time, listening to the tap-tap of the joiners’ mallets down in the shaft. It cheered him to think of the mine being injured and that they were having to bind the wound.","Up to now Étienne had avoided the Voreux, warned by the everlasting black silhouette of the sentinel stationed on the pit-bank above the plain. He could not be avoided, he dominated in the air, like the flag of the regiment. Towards three o'clock in the morning the sky became overcast, and he went to the pit, where some mates explained to him the bad condition of the tubbing; they even thought that it would have to be done entirely over again, which would stop the output of coal for three months. For a long time he prowled round, listening to the carpenters' mallets hammering in the shaft. That wound which had to be dressed rejoiced his heart."
"– Et toi, est-ce que tu parles aussi de retourner à la fosse, après nous avoir tous foutus dedans ?… Je ne te reproche rien.

In spite of the latter's slight importance, its powerful neighbour was enraged at seeing, enclosed within its own sixty-seven communes, this square league which did not belong to it, and after having vainly tried to kill it had plotted to buy it at a low price when in a failing condition. The war continued without truce. Each party stopped its galleries at two hundred metres from the other; it was a duel to the last drop of blood, although the managers and engineers maintained polite relations with each other."

"C’était quand même une confiance absolue, une foi religieuse, le don aveugle d’une population de croyants. Puisqu’on leur avait promis l’ère de la justice, ils étaient prêts à souffrir pour la conquête du bonheur universel. La faim exaltait les têtes, jamais l’horizon fermé n’avait ouvert un au-delà plus large à ces hallucinés de la misère.

Nothing could shake their absolute conviction that now at last they were entering its gates. The provident fund was exhausted, the Company would not yield, the situation would worsen with each day, and yet still they hoped and still they scoffed at life’s realities.

"Aussi, dès le mercredi matin, vit-on débarquer à Montsou trois des régisseurs. La petite ville, qui n’avait osé jusque-là se réjouir du massacre, le cœur malade, respira et goûta la joie d’être enfin sauvée. Justement, le temps s’était mis au beau, un clair soleil, un de ces premiers soleils de février dont la tiédeur verdit les pointes des lilas. On avait rabattu toutes les persiennes de la Régie, le vaste bâtiment semblait revivre ; et les meilleurs bruits en sortaient, on disait ces messieurs très affectés par la catastrophe, accourus pour ouvrir des bras paternels aux égarés des corons. Maintenant que le coup se trouvait porté, plus fort sans doute qu’ils ne l’eussent voulu, ils se prodiguaient dans leur besogne de sauveurs, ils décrétaient des mesures tardives et excellentes. D’abord, ils congédièrent les Borains, en menant grand tapage de cette concession extrême à leurs ouvriers. Puis, ils firent cesser l’occupation militaire des fosses, que les grévistes écrasés ne menaçaient plus. Ce furent eux encore qui obtinrent le silence, au sujet de la sentinelle du Voreux disparue : on avait fouillé le pays sans retrouver ni le fusil ni le cadavre, on se décida à porter le soldat déserteur, bien qu’on eût le soupçon d’un crime. En toutes choses, ils s’efforcèrent ainsi d’atténuer les événements, tremblant de la peur du lendemain, jugeant dangereux d’avouer l’irrésistible sauvagerie d’une foule, lâchée au travers des charpentes caduques du vieux monde. Et, d’ailleurs, ce travail de conciliation ne les empêchait pas de conduire à bien les affaires purement administratives ; car on avait vu Deneulin retourner à la Régie, où il se rencontrait avec M. Hennebeau. Les pourparlers continuaient pour l’achat de Vandame, on assurait qu’il allait accepter les offres de ces messieurs.","So, on Wednesday morning, three of the managers were seen disembarking at Montsou. The small town, which until then had not dared to rejoice in the massacre, with a sick heart, breathed and tasted the joy of finally being saved. The weather had just turned fine, a bright sun, one of those first February suns whose warmth greens the tips of the lilacs. All the shutters of the Régie had been drawn down, the vast building seemed to come to life again; and the best noises came out of it, it was said these gentlemen very affected by the catastrophe, hastened to open paternal arms to the lost people of the settlements. Now that the blow had been struck, stronger no doubt than they would have liked, they lavished themselves in their work of saviors, they decreed belated and excellent measures. First, they dismissed the Borains, making a great noise about this extreme concession to their workmen. Then they put an end to the military occupation of the pits, which the crushed strikers no longer threatened. It was they again who obtained silence on the subject of the missing Voreux sentry: they had searched the country without finding either the gun or the corpse, they decided to carry the deserter soldier, although they had the suspicion of a crime. In all things, they thus endeavored to attenuate the events, trembling with the fear of the morrow, judging it dangerous to confess the irresistible savagery of a crowd, let loose through the decrepit frameworks of the old world. And, moreover, this work of conciliation did not prevent them from carrying out purely administrative affairs; for Deneulin had been seen returning to the Régie, where he met M. Hennebeau. The talks continued for the purchase of Vandame, it was assured that he was going to accept the offers of these gentlemen.","And so it was that on the following Wednesday morning three members of the Board were to be seen arriving in Montsou. The little town, hitherto shocked and not daring to rejoice in the massacre, now breathed again and tasted the joy of being saved at last. As it happened, there had been a marked improvement in the weather, and there was now bright sunshine, the sunshine of early February whose warmth begins to tinge the lilac shoots with green. The shutters of the Board’s offices had been thrown open, and the huge building seemed to have sprung back to life; the most reassuring rumours began to issue forth, how the gentlemen had been deeply affected by the disaster and how they had hastened to the scene to open their paternal arms and embrace the wayward miners. Now that the blow had been delivered, admittedly rather more violently than they would have wished, they were falling over themselves in their desire to rescue the situation, and they took a number of welcome if overdue measures. First, they dismissed the Belgian workers and made a great fuss about what an enormous concession this was to their workforce. Next, they ended the military occupation of the pits, which were no longer under threat from the crushed miners. By their efforts also a line was drawn under the affair of the vanished sentry at Le Voreux. The whole area had been searched and neither the rifle nor the corpse had been found, and so it was decided to post him as a deserter even though a crime was still suspected. In all matters they endeavoured in this way to take the heat out of the situation, fearful of what the morrow might bring and considering it dangerous to acknowledge their powerlessness in the face of a savage mob let loose on the creaking timbers of the old order. At the same time these attempts at conciliation did not prevent them from getting on with their own administrative affairs, for Deneulin had been seen returning to the Board’s offices, where he had meetings with M. Hennebeau. Negotiations were in hand for the purchase of Vandame, and it was confidently expected that Deneulin would soon accept the gentlemen’s terms.","So on Wednesday morning three of the directors appeared at Montsou. The little town, sick at heart, which had not dared hitherto to rejoice over the massacre, now breathed again, and tasted the joy of being saved. The weather, too, had become fine; there was a bright sun--one of those first February days which, with their moist warmth, tip the lilac shoots with green. All the shutters had been flung back at the administration building, the vast structure seemed alive again. And cheering rumours were circulating; it was said that the directors, deeply affected by the catastrophe, had rushed down to open their paternal arms to the wanderers from the settlements. Now that the blow had fallen--a more vigorous one doubtless than they had wished for--they were prodigal in their task of relief, and decreed measures that were excellent though tardy. First of all they sent away the Borains, and made much of this extreme concession to their workmen. Then they put an end to the military occupation of the pits, which were no longer threatened by the crushed strikers. They also obtained silence regarding the sentinel who had disappeared from the Voreux; the district had been searched without finding either the gun or the corpse, and although there was a suspicion of crime, it was decided to consider the soldier a deserter. In every way they thus tried to attenuate matters, trembling with fear for the morrow, judging it dangerous to acknowledge the irresistible savagery of a crowd set free amid the falling structure of the old world. And besides, this work of conciliation did not prevent them from bringing purely administrative affairs to a satisfactory conclusion; for Deneulin had been seen to return to the administration buildings, where he met M. Hennebeau. The negotiations for the purchase of Vandame continued, and it was considered certain that Deneulin would accept the Company's offers."

"Pourtant, un gardien habitait là, le vieux Mouque, auquel la Compagnie abandonnait, presque sous le beffroi détruit, deux pièces, que la chute attendue des dernières charpentes menaçait d’un continuel écrasement. Il avait même dû étayer une partie du plafond ; et il y vivait très bien, en famille, lui et Mouquet dans une chambre, la Mouquette dans l’autre. Comme les fenêtres n’avaient plus une seule vitre, il s’était décidé à les boucher en clouant des planches : on ne voyait pas clair, mais il faisait chaud. Du reste, ce gardien ne gardait rien, allait soigner ses chevaux au Voreux, ne s’occupait jamais des ruines de Réquillart, dont on conservait seulement le puits pour servir de cheminée à un foyer, qui aérait la fosse voisine.","However, a caretaker lived there, old Mouque, to whom the Company abandoned, almost under the destroyed belfry, two rooms, which the expected fall of the last frames threatened with continual crushing. He even had to shore up part of the ceiling; and he lived there very well, with his family, he and Mouquet in one room, Mouquette in the other. As the windows no longer had a single pane of glass, he had decided to block them up by nailing boards: we couldn't see clearly, but it was hot. Besides, this keeper kept nothing, went to tend his horses to the Voreux, never bothered about the ruins of Réquillart, of which only the well was preserved to serve as a chimney for a hearth, which ventilated the neighboring pit.","All the same a caretaker still lived there, old Mouque. The Company had let him have two rooms situated almost directly beneath the derelict headgear, whose last remaining beams threatened daily to come crashing down on top of them. He had even had to prop up part of his roof. But he and his family were comfortable living there, with himself and Mouquet in one room and La Mouquette in the other. As there wasn’t a single pane of glass left in the windows, they had decided to board them up: this made it dark indoors, but at least it was warm. In fact the caretaker had nothing to take care of; he simply went off to look after his horses at Le Voreux and never bothered about the ruins of Réquillart, where all that was kept under repair was the mine-shaft itself so that it could serve as a flue for the engine which ventilated the neighbouring pit.","Yet a caretaker lived there, old Mouque, to whom the Company had given up, almost beneath the destroyed tower, two rooms which were constantly threatened by destruction from the expected fall of the last walls. He had even been obliged to shore up a part of the roof, and he lived there very comfortably with his family, he and Mouquet in one room, Mouquette in the other. As the windows no longer possessed a single pane, he had decided to close them by nailing up boards; one could not see well, but it was warm. For the rest, this caretaker cared for nothing: he went to look after his horses at the Voreux, and never troubled himself about the ruins of Réquillart, of which the shaft only was preserved, in order to serve as a chimney for a fire which ventilated the neighbouring pit."

"Mais alors le feu de peloton balayait le terrain, fauchait à cent pas les groupes de curieux qui riaient de la bataille. Une balle entra dans la bouche de Mouquet, le renversa, fracassé, aux pieds de Zacharie et de Philomène, dont les deux mioches furent couverts de gouttes rouges. Au même instant, la Mouquette recevait deux balles dans le ventre. Elle avait vu les soldats épauler, elle s’était jetée, d’un mouvement instinctif de bonne fille, devant Catherine, en lui criant de prendre garde ; et elle poussa un grand cri, elle s’étala sur les reins, culbutée par la secousse. Étienne accourut, voulut la relever, l’emporter ; mais, d’un geste, elle disait qu’elle était finie. Puis, elle hoqueta, sans cesser de leur sourire à l’un et à l’autre, comme si elle était heureuse de les voir ensemble, maintenant qu’elle s’en allait.","But then the platoon fire swept the ground, mowed down the groups of onlookers laughing at the battle at a hundred paces. A bullet entered Mouquet's mouth, knocked him down, shattered, at the feet of Zacharie and Philomene, whose two brats were covered with red drops. At the same moment, Mouquette received two bullets in the stomach. She had seen the soldiers backing up, she had thrown herself, with the instinctive movement of a good girl, in front of Catherine, crying out to her to beware; and she uttered a great cry, she fell on her back, knocked over by the shock. Étienne ran up, tried to pick her up, carry her away; but, with a gesture, she said that she was finished. Then she gasped, still smiling at each other, as if happy to see them together now that she was leaving.","But after that the general volley of gunfire had cleared the terrain, mowing down the groups of onlookers who were standing about laughing a hundred paces away. One bullet entered Mouquet’s mouth, shattering his skull and knocking him flat at the feet of Zacharie and Philomène, whose two children were spattered in blood. At the same instant La Mouquette was hit twice in the belly. She had seen the troops take aim and instinctively, with her characteristic generosity of spirit, she had thrown herself in front of Catherine, shouting at her to mind out. With a scream she tumbled backwards under the force of the shots. Étienne rushed across to lift her up and carry her away, but she gestured that it was too late. Then she gave a last gasp, still smiling at the two of them as though she were happy to see them together now that she was taking her leave.","But then the volley swept the field, mowing down the inquisitive groups who were laughing at the battle a hundred paces off.

"Là, également, la bande tomba au milieu de la sortie. Une herscheuse y fut prise et fouettée par les femmes, la culotte fendue, les fesses à l’air, devant les hommes qui riaient. Les galibots recevaient des gifles, des haveurs se sauvèrent, les côtes bleues de coups, le nez en sang. Et, dans cette férocité croissante, dans cet ancien besoin de revanche dont la folie détraquait toutes les têtes, les cris continuaient, s’étranglaient, la mort des traîtres, la haine du travail mal payé, le rugissement du ventre voulant du pain. On se mit à couper les câbles, mais la lime ne mordait pas, c’était trop long, maintenant qu’on avait la fièvre d’aller en avant, toujours en avant. Aux chaudières, un robinet fut cassé ; tandis que l’eau, jetée à pleins seaux dans les foyers, faisait éclater les grilles de fonte.","There, too, the band fell off in the middle of the exit. A putter was caught there and whipped by the women, her panties slit, her buttocks exposed, in front of the laughing men. The tramps received slaps, pikemen fled, their ribs bruised with blows, their noses bleeding. And, in this growing ferocity, in this ancient need for revenge, the madness of which deranged all heads, the cries continued, strangled, the death of traitors, the hatred of badly paid work, the roar of the belly wanting bread. We began to cut the cables, but the file did not bite, it took too long, now that we had the fever to go forward, always forward. At the boilers, a cock was broken; while the water, thrown in bucketfuls into the hearths, burst the cast-iron gratings.","There, too, the mob arrived just as the men were coming up. One putter was seized by the women, who ripped her trousers open and started flogging her bare buttocks in full view of the men, to their great amusement. The pit-boys got a clip round the ear, while some of the hewers escaped only after receiving bruised ribs or a bloody nose. As the ferocity of the encounter intensified, fuelled by the demented fury of this immemorial thirst for revenge which had turned everybody’s heads, cries rang out or died in the throat, the roar of empty bellies demanding death to the scabs and an end to low wages. They began to cut the cables, but the file was blunt. Anyway it would take too long, for they were in a frenzy now, desperate to be on the move, on, on. A tap was smashed in the boiler-room and buckets of water were thrown on to the fires, causing the cast-iron grates to crack.","There, also, the mob arrived in the midst of the ascent. A putter-girl was taken and whipped by the women with her breeches split open and her buttocks exposed before the laughing men.

"De nouveau, on ronflait tous en tas, le père Bonnemort occupait l’ancien lit des deux mioches, qui dormaient avec Catherine, maintenant que la pauvre Alzire n’enfonçait plus sa bosse dans les côtes de sa grande sœur.

"Ces vauriens finissaient par être la terreur du pays. Ils l’avaient envahi peu à peu, ainsi qu’une horde sauvage. D’abord, ils s’étaient contentés du carreau du Voreux, se culbutant dans le stock de charbon, d’où ils sortaient pareils à des nègres, faisant des parties de cache-cache parmi la provision des bois, au travers de laquelle ils se perdaient, comme au fond d’une forêt vierge. Puis, ils avaient pris d’assaut le terri, ils en descendaient sur leur derrière les parties nues, bouillantes encore des incendies intérieurs, ils se glissaient parmi les ronces des parties anciennes, cachés la journée entière, occupés à des petits jeux tranquilles de souris polissonnes. Et ils élargissaient toujours leurs conquêtes, allaient se battre au sang dans les tas de briques, couraient les prés en mangeant sans pain toutes sortes d’herbes laiteuses, fouillaient les berges du canal pour prendre des poissons de vase qu’ils avalaient crus, et poussaient plus loin, et voyageaient à des kilomètres, jusqu’aux futaies de Vandaine, sous lesquelles ils se gorgeaient de fraises au printemps, de noisettes et de myrtilles en été. Bientôt l’immense plaine leur avait appartenu.","These scoundrels ended up being the terror of the country. They had invaded it little by little, like a savage horde. At first they had contented themselves with the floor of the Voreux, tumbling over the stockpile of coal, whence they came out like niggers, playing hide-and-seek among the supply of wood, through which they were lost, as in the depths of a virgin forest. Then they had stormed the terri, they descended on their backs the bare parts, still boiling from the interior fires, they slipped among the brambles of the old parts, hidden the whole day, occupied in small quiet games of mice pranks. And they always widened their conquests, went to fight to the blood in the heaps of bricks, ran through the meadows eating all sorts of milky herbs without bread, searched the banks of the canal to catch mud fish which they swallowed raw, and grew further, and traveled for miles, to the forests of Vandaine, under which they gorged themselves with strawberries in the spring, hazelnuts and blueberries in the summer. Soon the immense plain had belonged to them.","These young scamps had become the scourge of the region, gradually overrunning it like some alien horde.

Then they had stormed the spoil-heap, sliding down the smooth parts on their bottoms while it continued to smoulder away underneath; or else they would disappear among the brambles that grew in the older parts of the mine, vanishing from sight for the entire day and occupying themselves with quiet little games like mischievous mice. And gradually they extended their empire. They fought till they bled among the piles of bricks, they roamed the fields and ate all kinds of lush grasses, just as they came, without bread, or they grubbed along the banks of the canal where they caught fish in the mud and swallowed them raw. Then they ventured even further afield, whole kilometres away, as far as the woods at Vandame, where they feasted on strawberries in the spring, in summer on hazelnuts and bilberries. Little by little they had made the vast plain their own.","These young rascals had become the terror of the country. They gradually spread themselves over it like a horde of savages.

Quelques-unes tenaient leur petit entre les bras, le soulevaient, l’agitaient, ainsi qu’un drapeau de deuil et de vengeance. D’autres, plus jeunes, avec des gorges gonflées de guerrières, brandissaient des bâtons ; tandis que les vieilles, affreuses, hurlaient si fort, que les cordes de leurs cous décharnés semblaient se rompre. Et les hommes déboulèrent ensuite, deux mille furieux, des galibots, des haveurs, des raccommodeurs, une masse compacte qui roulait d’un seul bloc, serrée, confondues, au point qu’on ne distinguait ni les culottes déteintes, ni les tricots de laine en loques, effacés dans la même uniformité terreuse. Les yeux brûlaient, on voyait seulement les trous des bouches noires, chantant La Marseillaise, dont les strophes se perdaient en un mugissement confus, accompagné par le claquement des sabots sur la terre dure.

Quand il se rendait au Voreux ou qu’il en revenait, chaque fois qu’il sortait de son trou, il ne pouvait risquer un pied, sans le mettre sur un couple, dans l’herbe ; et c’était pis, s’il voulait ramasser du bois pour sa soupe, ou chercher des glaiterons pour son lapin, à l’autre bout du clos : alors, il voyait se lever, un à un, les nez gourmands de toutes les filles de Montsou, tandis qu’il devait se méfier de ne pas buter contre les jambes, tendues au ras des sentiers. D’ailleurs, peu à peu, ces rencontres-là n’avaient plus dérangé personne, ni lui qui veillait simplement à ne pas tomber, ni les fines qu’il laissait achever leur affaire, s’éloignant à petits pas discrets, en brave homme paisible devant les choses de la nature. Seulement, de même qu’elles le connaissaient à cette heure, lui avait également fini par les connaître, ainsi que l’on connaît les pies polissonnes qui se débauchent dans les poiriers des jardins. Ah ! cette jeunesse, comme elle en prenait, comme elle se bourrait ! Parfois, il hochait le menton avec des regrets silencieux, en se détournant des gaillardes bruyantes, soufflant trop haut, au fond des ténèbres. Une seule chose lui causait de l’humeur : deux amoureux avaient pris la mauvaise habitude de s’embrasser contre le mur de sa chambre. Ce n’était pas que ça l’empêchât de dormir, mais ils poussaient si fort, qu’à la longue ils dégradaient le mur.","And it was thus that Father Mouque ended his age, in the midst of love. From the age of ten, Mouquette had tumbled about in all the corners of the rubble, not like a frightened little girl still green like Lydie, but like a girl who was already plump and good for bearded boys. The father had nothing to say, for she showed herself respectful, she never introduced a gallant into his home. Then, he was used to these accidents. When he went to the Voreux or came back from it, each time he came out of his hole, he could not risk a foot without putting it on a couple in the grass; and it was worse if he wanted to pick up wood for his soup, or look for ice-cream makers for his rabbit, at the other end of the enclosure: then he saw rising, one by one, the greedy noses of all the Montsou's daughters, while he had to be careful not to stumble against the legs, which were stretched along the paths. Moreover, little by little, these encounters no longer bothered anyone, neither him who was simply careful not to fall, nor the slender ones he left to finish their business, walking away with small discreet steps, bravely peaceful man before the things of nature. Only, just as they knew him at that hour, he had also come to know them, as one knows the naughty magpies who debauchery in the pear trees of the gardens. Ah! this youth, how she took it, how stuffed she was! Sometimes he nodded his chin in silent regret, turning away from the noisy galliards, blowing too loudly, deep in the darkness. Only one thing was causing him the mood: two lovers had taken the bad habit of kissing against the wall of his room. It wasn't that it kept him awake, but they were pushing so hard that in the long run they were degrading the wall.","And this was how old Mouque came to be living out his days surrounded by young love. From the age of ten La Mouquette had been having sex in every corner of the ruins, not, like Lydie, as a timid and unripe little urchin-child, but as a girl who had filled out and was ready for boys with beards. There was nothing her father could say or do about it, for she always showed him proper respect and never asked any of her boyfriends into the house. Anyway, he was used to such things. Whether he was on his way out to Le Voreux or coming home again, the moment he ventured out of his lair he was always tripping over some couple hidden in the grass. Even worse, whenever he wanted to fetch some wood to cook his soup or pick some burdock for his rabbit over on the far side of the mine, there all the girls of Montsou would be, popping their pretty little noses up out of the grass, and he had to be careful where he trod so as not to step on any of the legs stretched out across the path. But gradually such encounters had ceased to trouble either party, neither himself, who simply tried to make sure that he didn’t trip over, nor the girls themselves, whom he left to get on with the business in hand as he tiptoed discreetly away like a good fellow who has no quarrel with the workings of nature. Except that just as they had now got to know him, so too he had come to recognize them, the way one recognizes amorous magpies disporting in the pear trees in the garden. Oh, these youngsters! They were always at it, they simply never stopped! Sometimes he shook his head in silent regret as he turned away from the noisy trollops panting loudly in the dark. Only one thing actually annoyed him: a particular pair of lovers had acquired the unfortunate habit of embracing against the outside wall of his room. Not that it kept him awake at night or anything of that sort; it was just that they pushed so hard that they were gradually damaging the wall.","It was thus that Father Mouque was ending his old age in the midst of love. Ever since she was ten Mouquette had been lying about in all the corners of the ruins, not as a timid and still green little urchin like Lydie, but as a girl who was already big, and a mate for bearded lads. The father had nothing to say, for she was considerate, and never introduced a lover into the house. Then he was used to this sort of accident. When he went to the Voreux, when he came back, whenever he came out of his hole, he could scarcely put a foot down without treading on a couple in the grass; and it was worse if he wanted to gather wood to heat his soup or look for burdocks for his rabbit at the other end of the enclosure. Then he saw one by one the voluptuous noses of all the girls of Montsou rising up around him, while he had to be careful not to knock against the limbs stretched out level with the paths. Besides, these meetings had gradually ceased to disturb either him who was simply taking care not to stumble, or the girls whom he allowed to finish their affairs, going away with discreet little steps like a worthy man who was at peace with the ways of nature. Only just as they now knew him he at last also knew them, as one knows the rascally magpies who become corrupted in the pear-trees in the garden. Ah! youth! youth! how it goes on, how wild it is! Sometimes he wagged his chin with silent regret, turning away from the noisy wantons who were breathing too loudly in the darkness. Only one thing put him out of temper: two lovers had acquired the bad habit of embracing outside his wall. It was not that it prevented him from sleeping, but they leaned against the wall so heavily that at last they damaged it."

"Cette fois, il n’amenait que trois berlines. On pouvait toujours culbuter celles-là : un accident arrivé à la cage d’extraction, un écrou cassé, allait arrêter le travail pendant un grand quart d’heure.

"Lui seul avait l’intelligence assez déliée pour analyser la situation. Il l’expliquait de son air tranquille. La Compagnie, atteinte par la crise, était bien forcée de réduire ses frais, si elle ne voulait pas succomber ; et, naturellement, ce seraient les ouvriers qui devraient se serrer le ventre, elle rognerait leurs salaires, en inventant un prétexte quelconque. Depuis deux mois la houille restait sur le carreau de ses fosses, presque toutes les usines chômaient. Comme elle n’osait chômer aussi, effrayée devant l’inaction ruineuse du matériel, elle rêvait un moyen terme, peut-être une grève, d’où son peuple de mineurs sortirait dompté et moins payé. Enfin, la nouvelle caisse de prévoyance l’inquiétait, devenait une menace pour l’avenir, tandis qu’une grève l’en débarrasserait, en la vidant, lorsqu’elle était peu garnie encore.","He alone had enough intelligence to analyze the situation. He explained it calmly. The Company, hit by the crisis, was forced to reduce its expenses, if it did not wish to succumb; and, of course, it would be the workers who would have to squeeze their stomachs, she would eat away at their wages, inventing some pretext. For two months the coal had been lying on the floor of its pits, almost all the factories were idle. As she also dared not be unemployed, frightened by the ruinous inaction of the equipment, she dreamed of a middle term, perhaps a strike, from which her people of miners would come out tamed and less paid. Finally, the new provident fund worried him, became a threat for the future, while a strike would rid him of it, by emptying it, when it was still scarce.","He was the only one with sufficient intelligence to analyse the situation accurately, and he explained it with his usual calm. Faced with the crisis, the Company had been forced to reduce its costs in order to avoid going under; and naturally the workers were the ones who were going to have to tighten their belts. The Company would gradually whittle their wages down, using whatever pretext came to hand. Coal had been piling up at the pit-heads for two months now, since all the factories were idle. But the Company didn’t dare lay off its own workers because it would be ruinous not to maintain the plant, and so it was looking for some middle way, perhaps a strike, which would bring its workforce to heel and leave it less well paid than before. Last but not least, it was worried about the provident fund: this could prove to be a threat one day, whereas a strike now would eliminate it by depleting the fund while it was still small.","He alone had a sufficiently keen intelligence to analyse the situation. He explained it in his quiet way. The Company, suffering from the crisis, had been forced to reduce their expenses if they were not to succumb, and it was naturally the workers who would have to tighten their bellies; under some pretext or another the Company would nibble at their wages. For two months the coal had been remaining at the surface of their pits, and nearly all the workshops were resting. As the Company did not dare to rest in this way, terrified at the ruinous inaction, they were meditating a middle course, perhaps a strike, from which the miners would come out crushed and worse paid. Then the new provident fund was disturbing them, as it was a threat for the future, while a strike would relieve them of it, by exhausting it when it was still small."

"Jeanlin, un soir, apporta un bout de chandelle, volé dans la lanterne d’un roulier ; et ce fut un grand soulagement pour Étienne. Lorsque les ténèbres finissaient par l’hébéter, par lui peser sur le crâne à le rendre fou, il allumait un instant ; puis, dès qu’il avait chassé le cauchemar, il éteignait, avare de cette clarté nécessaire à sa vie, autant que le pain. Le silence bourdonnait à ses oreilles, il n’entendait que la fuite d’une bande de rats, le craquement des vieux boisages, le petit bruit d’une araignée filant sa toile. Et les yeux ouverts dans ce néant tiède, il retournait à son idée fixe, à ce que les camarades faisaient là-haut. Une défection de sa part lui aurait paru la dernière des lâchetés. S’il se cachait ainsi, c’était pour rester libre, pour conseiller et agir. Ses longues songeries avaient fixé son ambition : en attendant mieux, il aurait voulu être Pluchart, lâcher le travail, travailler uniquement à la politique, mais seul, dans une chambre propre, sous le prétexte que les travaux de tête absorbent la vie entière et demandent beaucoup de calme.","Jeanlin, one evening, brought a candle-end, stolen from the lantern of a carter; and it was a great relief for Etienne. When the darkness ended by dazing him, by weighing on his skull to drive him mad, he turned on the light for a moment; then, as soon as he had driven away the nightmare, he extinguished, miserly of this clarity necessary to his life, as much as bread. Silence buzzed in his ears, he heard only the flight of a flock of rats, the creaking of old woodwork, the little sound of a spider spinning its web. And with his eyes open in this warm nothingness, he returned to his fixed idea, to what his comrades were doing up there. A defection on his part would have seemed to him the ultimate in cowardice. If he hid himself thus, it was to remain free, to advise and act. His long daydreams had fixed his ambition: while waiting for something better, he would have liked to be Pluchart, to let go of work, to work solely in politics, but alone, in a clean room, on the pretext that mental work absorbs the whole of life and demands a lot of calm.","One evening Jeanlin brought him the remains of a candle, which he had stolen from a wagoner’s lantern; and for Étienne this was a great relief. When the darkness began to get to him and his thoughts started weighing on him as though he might soon go mad, he would light it for a moment; and then, when he had chased away the gremlins, he would extinguish it, determined to economize on this bright light that was as necessary to his survival as bread itself. The silence made his ears hum, and all he ever heard was the scuttling of rats, the creaking of the old timbering, or the tiny sound of a spider weaving its web. And as he stared into the warm void, his mind kept returning to the same old question: what were his comrades doing up there? To abandon them would have seemed to him the worst possible act of cowardice. If he was hiding down here like this, it was so that he could remain free, ready to advise and act. His long periods of reflection had shown him where his true ambition lay: pending something better he wanted to be like Pluchart, to stop work and devote himself entirely to politics, but alone, in a nice clean room somewhere, on the grounds that brain work is a full-time job and requires much peace and quiet.","Jeanlin one evening brought a candle-end, stolen from a carter's lantern, and this was a great relief for Étienne.

Il faudrait des mille ans et des mille ans pour que ça se réalisât peut-être. Alors, qu’on lui fichât la paix, avec les miracles !

It would take a thousand years and a thousand years for that to happen maybe. So, leave him alone, with the miracles! The wisest course, when you didn't want to break your nose, was to walk straight, to demand the possible reforms, to finally improve the lot of the workers, on all occasions.

It would take an eternity before that ever happened, and even then! If it was miracles they were after, forget it! The only sensible thing to do if they didn’t want to end up with a bloody nose was to keep their eye on the real issue, to take every opportunity that presented itself to demand reforms that were possible, things that would actually improve the worker’s lot. If it was left to him, he had no doubt he could get the Company to bring in better working conditions; whereas with everyone digging their heels in like this, they were all going to bloody die, thank you very much!","He raised his voice, protruding his belly and squarely planted on his big legs. The man's whole patient, reasonable nature was revealed in clear phrases, which flowed abundantly without an effort. Was it not absurd to believe that with one stroke one could change the world, putting the workers in the place of the masters and dividing gold as one divides an apple? It would, perhaps, take thousands and thousands of years for that to be realized. There, hold your tongue, with your miracles! The most sensible plan was, if one did not wish to break one's nose, to go straight forward, to demand possible reforms, in short, to improve the lot of the workers on every occasion. He did his best, so far as he occupied himself with it, to bring the Company to better terms; if not, damn it all! they would only starve by being obstinate."

"En quittant le coron des Deux-Cent-Quarante, Catherine était allée à Montsou par le pavé. Depuis l’âge de dix ans, depuis qu’elle gagnait sa vie à la fosse, elle courait ainsi le pays toute seule, dans la complète liberté des familles de houilleurs ; et, si aucun homme ne l’avait eue, à quinze ans, c’était grâce à l’éveil tardif de sa puberté, dont elle attendait encore la crise. Quand elle fut devant les Chantiers de la Compagnie, elle traversa la rue et entra chez une blanchisseuse, où elle était certaine de trouver la Mouquette ; car celle-ci vivait là, avec des femmes qui se payaient des tournées de café, du matin au soir. Mais elle eut un chagrin, la Mouquette, précisément, avait régalé à son tour, si bien qu’elle ne put lui prêter les dix sous promis. Pour la consoler, on lui offrit vainement un verre de café tout chaud. Elle ne voulut même pas que sa camarade empruntât à une autre femme. Une pensée d’économie lui était venue, une sorte de crainte superstitieuse, la certitude que, si elle l’achetait maintenant, ce ruban lui porterait malheur.","On leaving the Deux-Cent-Quarante settlement, Catherine had gone to Montsou by the pavement. From the age of ten, ever since she had earned her living at the pit, she had thus traveled the country alone, in the complete freedom of the families of coal-miners; and, if no man had had her, at fifteen, it was thanks to the late awakening of her puberty, the crisis of which she still awaited. When she was in front of the Chantiers de la Compagnie, she crossed the street and entered a laundress's, where she was certain of finding La Mouquette; for this one lived there, with women who treated themselves to rounds of coffee, from morning till night. But she had a chagrin, it was precisely La Mouquette who had entertained her in turn, so much so that she could not lend her the ten sous promised. To console her, they vainly offered her a glass of hot coffee. She didn't even want her friend to borrow from another woman. A thought of economy had come to her, a kind of superstitious fear, the certainty that, if she bought it now, this ribbon would bring her bad luck.","On leaving Village Two Hundred and Forty, Catherine had walked to Montsou along the main road. Since the age of ten, when she had begun to earn her living at the pit, she had been used to going about the countryside on her own like this with the complete freedom that was customary among mining families; and if, at the age of fifteen, no man had yet laid a hand on her, it was because she was a late developer and still awaiting the onset of puberty. When she reached the Company yards, she crossed the street and went into a laundry-woman’s house where she knew she would find La Mouquette; for the latter virtually lived there, in the company of women who treated each other to endless cups of coffee from morning to night. But she was disappointed to discover that La Mouquette had just bought her round of coffees and so could not lend her the ten sous she’d promised. By way of consolation they offered Catherine a glass of steaming hot coffee, but she would not hear of La Mouquette borrowing the money off another woman on her behalf. She had a sudden urge to economize, a kind of superstitious fear amounting almost to certainty that if she bought the ribbon now it would bring her bad luck.","On leaving the settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante Catherine had gone to Montsou along the road.

"Et il plaça son discours sur la grandeur et les bienfaits de l’Internationale, celui qu’il déballait d’abord, dans les localités où il débutait. Il en expliqua le but, l’émancipation des travailleurs ; il en montra la structure grandiose, en bas la commune, plus haut la province, plus haut encore la nation, et tout au sommet l’humanité. Ses bras s’agitaient lentement, entassaient les étages, dressaient l’immense cathédrale du monde futur. Puis, c’était l’administration intérieure : il lut les statuts, parla des congrès, indiqua l’importance croissante de l’œuvre, l’élargissement du programme, qui, parti de la discussion des salaires, s’attaquait maintenant à la liquidation sociale, pour en finir avec le salariat. Plus de nationalités, les ouvriers du monde entier réunis dans un besoin commun de justice, balayant la pourriture bourgeoise, fondant enfin la société libre, où celui qui ne travaillerait pas ne récolterait pas ! Il mugissait, son haleine effarait les fleurs de papier peint, sous le plafond enfumé dont l’écrasement rabattait les éclats de sa voix.","And he placed his speech on the greatness and the benefits of the International, the one he first unpacked, in the localities where he was beginning.

His arms moved slowly, piled up the floors, erected the immense cathedral of the future world. Then it was the internal administration: he read the statutes, spoke of the congresses, indicated the growing importance of the work, the enlargement of the program, which, starting from the discussion of salaries, now attacked the social liquidation, to put an end to wage-earning. No more nationalities, the workers of the whole world united in a common need for justice, sweeping away bourgeois rot, finally founding a free society, where those who did not work would not harvest!

Then he spoke about how the organization was run: he read out its statutes, talked about the congresses, drew attention to the way the scope of its activities was growing, how its agenda had moved beyond the debate about pay and was now focused on dissolving social distinctions and abolishing the very notion of a wage-earning class. No more nationalities! The workers of the world united in the common pursuit of justice, sweeping away the dead wood of the bourgeoisie and finally creating the free society in which he who works not, reaps not!

"À la longue, Étienne souffrait aussi beaucoup moins de l’humidité et de l’étouffement de la taille. La cheminée lui semblait très commode pour monter, comme s’il eût fondu et qu’il pût passer par des fentes, où il n’aurait point risqué une main jadis. Il respirait sans malaise les poussières du charbon, voyait clair dans la nuit, suait tranquille, fait à la sensation d’avoir du matin au soir ses vêtements trempés sur le corps. Du reste, il ne dépensait plus maladroitement ses forces, une adresse lui était venue, si rapide, qu’elle étonnait le chantier. Au bout de trois semaines, on le citait parmi les bons herscheurs de la fosse : pas un ne roulait sa berline jusqu’au plan incliné, d’un train plus vif, ni ne l’emballait ensuite, avec autant de correction. Sa petite taille lui permettait de se glisser partout, et ses bras avaient beau être fins et blancs comme ceux d’une femme, ils paraissaient en fer sous la peau délicate, tellement ils menaient rudement la besogne. Jamais il ne se plaignait, par fierté sans doute, même quand il râlait de fatigue. On ne lui reprochait que de ne pas comprendre la plaisanterie, tout de suite fâché, dès qu’on voulait taper sur lui. Au demeurant, il était accepté, regardé comme un vrai mineur, dans cet écrasement de l’habitude qui le réduisait un peu chaque jour à une fonction de machine.","In the long run, Étienne also suffered much less from the humidity and suffocation of the waist. The chimney seemed to him very easy to climb, as if he had melted and could pass through crevices where he would not have risked a hand formerly. He breathed in the dust of the coal without discomfort, saw clearly in the night, sweated quietly, made up of the feeling of having his clothes soaked on his body from morning to night. Besides, he no longer spent his strength awkwardly, an address had come to him so quickly that it astonished the yard. At the end of three weeks, he was cited among the good putters in the pit: not one rolled his sedan to the inclined plane, with a more lively train, nor packed it afterwards, with as much correction. His small size allowed him to slip everywhere, and although his arms were thin and white like a woman's, they seemed like iron under the delicate skin, so rough they carried out the work. He never complained, no doubt out of pride, even when he was moaning with fatigue. He was only reproached for not understanding the joke, immediately angry, as soon as someone wanted to hit him. Moreover, he was accepted, regarded as a true miner, in this crushing of habit which reduced him a little each day to the function of a machine.","In due course Étienne also began to suffer less from the humidity and airlessness at the coal-face. The chimney now seemed an ideal way up, as though he himself had somehow become molten and could pass through chinks in the rock where once he wouldn’t even have ventured his hand. He could breathe in the coal-dust without discomfort, he could see perfectly well in the dark, and he sweated normally, having got used to feeling wet clothes against his skin all day long. Moreover, he no longer squandered his energy in clumsy movements, and his comrades were amazed at the speed and skill with which he now did things. After three weeks he was spoken of as one of the best putters in the pit: no one rolled his tub up the slope more smartly than he did, nor then dispatched it more neatly. His slim figure allowed him to squeeze past everything, and for all that his arms were as white and slender as a woman’s, there seemed to be iron beneath that delicate skin so stoutly did they do their work. He never complained, as a matter of pride no doubt, not even when he was gasping with exhaustion. His only failing was that he couldn’t take a joke, and he would flare up the moment anyone criticized him. Otherwise he was accepted and looked on as a real miner even as the crushing mould of daily routine gradually reduced him to the level of a machine.","After a time, also, Étienne suffered much less from the damp and closeness of the cutting. The chimney or ascending passage seemed to him more convenient for climbing up, as if he had melted and could pass through cracks where before he would not have risked a hand. He breathed the coal-dust without difficulty, saw clearly in the obscurity, and sweated tranquilly, having grown accustomed to the sensation of wet garments on his body from morning to night. Besides, he no longer spent his energy recklessly; he had gained skill so rapidly that he astonished the whole stall. In three weeks he was named among the best putters in the pit; no one pushed a tram more rapidly to the upbrow, nor loaded it afterwards so correctly. His small figure allowed him to slip about everywhere, and though his arms were as delicate and white as a woman's, they seemed to be made of iron beneath the smooth skin, so vigorously did they perform their task. He never complained, out of pride no doubt, even when he was panting with fatigue. The only thing they had against him was that he could not take a joke, and grew angry as soon as any one trod on his toes. In all other respects he was accepted and looked upon as a real miner, reduced beneath this pressure of habit, little by little, to a machine."

"En arrière, Étienne défaillait, le cœur noyé d’amertume. Il se rappelait la prédiction de Rasseneur, dans la forêt, lorsque celui-ci l’avait menacé de l’ingratitude des foules. Quelle brutalité imbécile ! quel oubli abominable des services rendus ! C’était une force aveugle qui se dévorait constamment elle-même. Et, sous sa colère à voir ces brutes gâter leur cause, il y avait le désespoir de son propre écroulement, de la fin tragique de son ambition. Eh quoi ! était-ce fini déjà ? Il se souvenait d’avoir, sous les hêtres, entendu trois mille poitrines battre à l’écho de la sienne. Ce jour-là, il avait tenu sa popularité dans ses deux mains, ce peuple lui appartenait, il s’en était senti le maître. Des rêves fous le grisaient alors : Montsou à ses pieds, Paris là-bas, député peut-être, foudroyant les bourgeois d’un discours, le premier discours prononcé par un ouvrier à la tribune d’un Parlement. Et c’était fini ! il s’éveillait misérable et détesté, son peuple venait de le reconduire à coups de briques.","Behind, Étienne fainted, his heart drowned in bitterness. He remembered Rasseneur's prediction, in the forest, when the latter had threatened him with the ingratitude of the crowds. What idiotic brutality! what an abominable neglect of services rendered! It was a blind force that constantly devoured itself. And beneath his anger at seeing these bullies spoil their cause, there was despair at his own collapse, at the tragic end of his ambition. Oh what! was it over already? He remembered having, under the beeches, heard three thousand breasts beating to the echo of his own. That day, he held his popularity in both hands, this people belonged to him, he felt he was master of it. Crazy dreams intoxicated him then: Montsou at his feet, Paris over there, deputy perhaps, thundering down the bourgeois with a speech, the first speech delivered by a worker from the tribune of a Parliament. And it was over! he woke up miserable and hated, his people had just driven him away with bricks.","Standing in the background, Étienne felt sickened, and his heart was filled with bitterness. He remembered Rasseneur’s prediction in the forest when he had warned him about the ingratitude of the crowd. What mindless brutality! How appalling it was, the way they had forgotten everything he had done for them! They were like a blind force constantly feeding on itself. But beneath his anger at seeing these brutes wrecking their own cause there lay despair at his own collapse, at the tragic end of his own ambitions. So that was it? It was all over? He remembered the occasion, under the beech trees, when he had listened to three thousand hearts beating in time with his own. That day he had been in control of his popularity, these people had belonged to him, he had felt himself to be their master. Then he had been drunk on wild dreams: Montsou at his feet, Paris beckoning, perhaps election to the Chamber of Deputies, lambasting the bourgeois with his oratory, the first parliamentary speech ever made by a working man. And now it was all over! Now he had awoken from the dream, wretched and hated, and his people had just thrown bricks at him and banished him from their midst.","Étienne, in the background, grew faint, and there was bitterness at his heart. He recalled Rasseneur's prediction in the forest, threatening him with the ingratitude of the mob. What imbecile brutality! What an abominable forgetfulness of old services! It was a blind force which constantly devoured itself. And beneath his anger at seeing these brutes spoil their own cause, there was despair at his own fall and the tragic end of his ambition. What! was it already done for! He remembered hearing beneath the beeches three thousand hearts beating to the echo of his own. On that day he had held his popularity in both hands. Those people belonged to him; he felt that he was their master. Mad dreams had then intoxicated him. Montsou at his feet, Paris beyond, becoming a deputy perhaps, crushing the middle class in a speech, the first speech ever pronounced by a workman in a parliament. And it was all over! He awakened, miserable and detested; his people were dismissing him by flinging bricks."

"Et, penché, l’œil élargi, Étienne le regardait. C’était donc fait, il avait tué. Confusément, toutes ses luttes lui revenaient à la mémoire, cet inutile combat contre le poison qui dormait dans ses muscles, l’alcool lentement accumulé de sa race. Pourtant, il n’était ivre que de faim, l’ivresse lointaine des parents avait suffi. Ses cheveux se dressaient devant l’horreur de ce meurtre, et malgré la révolte de son éducation, une allégresse faisait battre son cœur, la joie animale d’un appétit enfin satisfait. Il eut ensuite un orgueil, l’orgueil du plus fort. Le petit soldat lui était apparu, la gorge trouée d’un couteau, tué par un enfant. Lui aussi, avait tué.","And, leaning forward, his eyes widened, Étienne gazed at him. So it was done, he had killed. Confusedly, all his struggles came back to him, this useless fight against the poison that slept in his muscles, the slowly accumulated alcohol of his race. However, he was only drunk from hunger, the distant drunkenness of his parents had been enough. His hair stood on end before the horror of this murder, and despite the revolt of his education, a joy made his heart beat, the animal joy of an appetite finally satisfied. He then had a pride, the pride of the strongest. The little soldier had appeared to him, his throat pierced with a knife, killed by a child. He, too, had killed.","Étienne leaned over him, wide-eyed, and stared. So it was done, he had killed. The memory of all his past struggles came confusedly to his mind, memories of his long, futile battle against the poison that lay dormant in every sinew of his body, the alcohol which had slowly accumulated over the generations in his family’s blood. And yet if he was drunk now, it could only be on hunger: his parents’ alcoholism had sufficed at one remove. His hair stood on end at the horror of this murder and, though all his upbringing was against it, his heart was racing with joy, the sheer animal joy of a sated appetite. And then he felt an upsurge of pride, the pride of the fittest. He had suddenly remembered the young soldier, his throat slit with a knife, killed by a child. Now he, too, had killed.","Leaning over, with wide eyes, Étienne looked at him. It was done, then; he had killed. All his struggles came back to his memory confusedly, that useless fight against the poison which slept in his muscles, the slowly accumulated alcohol of his race.

His hair stood up before the horror of this murder; and yet, in spite of the revolt which came from his education, a certain gladness made his heart beat, the animal joy of an appetite at length satisfied. He felt pride, too, the pride of the stronger man. The little soldier appeared before him, with his throat opened by a knife, killed by a child. Now he, too, had killed."
"Il fut terrible, jamais il n’avait parlé si violemment. D’un bras, il maintenait le vieux Bonnemort, il l’étalait comme un drapeau de misère et de deuil, criant vengeance. En phrases rapides, il remontait au premier Maheu, il montrait toute cette famille usée à la mine, mangée par la Compagnie, plus affamée après cent ans de travail ; et, devant elle, il mettait ensuite les ventres de la Régie, qui suaient l’argent, toute la bande des actionnaires entretenus comme des filles depuis un siècle, à ne rien faire, à jouir de leur corps. N’était-ce pas effroyable ? un peuple d’hommes crevant au fond de père en fils, pour qu’on paie des pots-de-vin à des ministres, pour que des générations de grands seigneurs et de bourgeois donnent des fêtes ou s’engraissent au coin de leur feu ! Il avait étudié les maladies des mineurs, il les faisait défiler toutes, avec des détails effrayants : l’anémie, les scrofules, la bronchite noire, l’asthme qui étouffe, les rhumatismes qui paralysent. Ces misérables, on les jetait en pâture aux machines, on les parquait ainsi que du bétail dans les corons, les grandes Compagnies les absorbaient peu à peu, réglementant l’esclavage, menaçant d’enrégimenter tous les travailleurs d’une nation, des minions de bras, pour la fortune d’un millier de paresseux. Mais le mineur n’était plus l’ignorant, la brute écrasée dans les entrailles du sol. Une armée poussait des profondeurs des fosses, une moisson de citoyens dont la semence germait et ferait éclater la terre, un jour de grand soleil. Et l’on saurait alors si, après quarante années de service, on oserait offrir cent cinquante francs de pension à un vieillard de soixante ans, crachant de la houille, les jambes enflées par l’eau des tailles. Oui ! le travail demanderait des comptes au capital, à ce dieu impersonnel, inconnu de l’ouvrier, accroupi quelque part, dans le mystère de son tabernacle, d’où il suçait la vie des meurt-de-faim qui le nourrissaient ! On irait là-bas, on finirait bien par lui voir la face aux clartés des incendies, on le noierait sous le sang, ce pourceau immonde, cette idole monstrueuse, gorgée de chair humaine !","He was terrible, he had never spoken so violently. With one arm he held old Bonnemort, he spread him out like a flag of misery and mourning, crying out for revenge. In rapid phrases, he went back to the first Maheu, he showed all that family worn down, eaten up by the Company, hungrier after a hundred years of work; and, before her, he then placed the bellies of the Régie, who were sweating money, the whole band of shareholders, kept like girls for a century, doing nothing, enjoying their bodies. Wasn't that appalling? a people of men dying deep down from father to son, so that bribes can be paid to ministers, so that generations of great lords and bourgeois give parties or fatten themselves by their fireside ! He had studied the diseases of miners, he scrolled through them all, with frightening details: anemia, scrofula, black bronchitis, choking asthma, paralyzing rheumatism. These wretches, they were thrown to the machines, they were parked like cattle in the settlements, the big companies absorbed them little by little, regulating slavery, threatening to regiment all the workers of a nation, minions of arms, for the fortune of a thousand sloths. But the miner was no longer the ignorant, the brute crushed in the bowels of the ground. An army sprang up from the depths of the pits, a harvest of citizens whose seed germinated and made the earth burst open on a sunny day. And we would then know if, after forty years of service, we would dare to offer a hundred and fifty francs pension to an old man of sixty, spitting coal, his legs swollen by the water from the cuttings. Yes ! labor would call capital to account, that impersonal god, unknown to the worker, squatting somewhere, in the mystery of his tabernacle, from which he sucked the life of the starving people who fed him! We would go there, we would eventually see his face in the light of the fires, we would drown him in blood, this filthy pig, this monstrous idol, gorged with human flesh!","He was awesome: he had never spoken with such vehemence before. With one arm he held on to old Bonnemort, displaying him like an emblem of misery and grief and baying for vengeance as he did so. Speaking very quickly, he went back in time to the first of the Maheus and described how since then the whole family had been worn out by the mine and exploited by the Company and now found itself, after a hundred years of toil, even hungrier than it had ever been before; and then he compared them with the fat-bellied directors, men who oozed money from every pore, and with all those shareholders who had spent the past century living like kept women with nothing to do but delight in the pleasures of the flesh. Wasn’t it terrible? A whole lineage of human beings working themselves to death down the mine from father to son so that government ministers could have their kickbacks and generations of noble lords and gentlemen could give grand parties or sit and grow fat by their firesides! He had studied the occupational diseases of miners, and he regaled them with the full panoply in gruesome detail: anaemia, scrofula, the bronchitis that made them spit black coal, the asthma that choked them, the rheumatisms that stopped them walking. The miserable devils were no better than machine-fodder, they were penned in villages like livestock, and the big companies were gradually absorbing them all, regulating their slavery and threatening to enlist every worker in the country, millions upon millions of hands, in order to make the fortunes of a thousand idle men. But the miner was no longer the ignorant brute who could be crushed underfoot in the bowels of the earth. An army was taking root in the depths of the mines, a crop of citizens whose seed was slowly germinating under the surface of the earth and who would, one fine sunny day, finally break through to the light. And then they’d learn whether anyone would still dare to offer a pension of a hundred and fifty francs to a sixty-year-old miner after forty years’ service, a man who was coughing up coal-dust and whose legs were swollen with the water from the coal-faces he had worked. Yes, labour was going to call capital to account and confront this anonymous god that the worker never met, the god that squatted somewhere in its mysterious inner sanctuary and sucked the blood of the poor devils that kept it alive! They would go there themselves and they would finally see its face by the light of the coming conflagration; and then they would drown the filthy swine in its own blood, they would destroy this monstrous idol that had gorged on human flesh!","He was terrible; never had he spoken so violently. With one arm he supported old Bonnemort, exhibiting him as a banner of misery and mourning, and crying for vengeance. In a few rapid phrases he went back to the first Maheu. He showed the whole family used up at the mine, devoured by the Company, hungrier than ever after a hundred years of work; and contrasting with the Maheus he pointed to the big bellies of the directors sweating gold, a whole band of shareholders, going on for a century like kept women, doing nothing but enjoy with their bodies. Was it not fearful? a race of men dying down below, from father to son, so that bribes of wine could be given to ministers, and generations of great lords and bourgeois could give feasts or fatten by their firesides! He had studied the diseases of the miners. He made them all march past with their awful details: anaemia, scrofula, black bronchitis, the asthma which chokes, and the rheumatism which paralyses. These wretches were thrown as food to the engines and penned up like beasts in the settlements. The great companies absorbed them, regulating their slavery, threatening to enrol all the workers of the nation, millions of hands, to bring fortune to a thousand idlers. But the miner was no longer an ignorant brute, crushed within the bowels of the earth. An army was springing up from the depths of the pits, a harvest of citizens whose seed would germinate and burst through the earth some sunny day. And they would see then if, after forty years of service, any one would dare to offer a pension of a hundred and fifty francs to an old man of sixty who spat out coal and whose legs were swollen with the water from the cuttings. Yes! labour would demand an account from capital: that impersonal god, unknown to the worker, crouching down somewhere in his mysterious sanctuary, where he sucked the life out of the starvelings who nourished him! They would go down there; they would at last succeed in seeing his face by the gleam of incendiary fires, they would drown him in blood, that filthy swine, that monstrous idol, gorged with human flesh!"

"À cinq heures, Dansaert réveilla M. Hennebeau pour l’avertir que pas un homme n’était descendu au Voreux. Le coron des Deux-Cent-Quarante, qu’il avait traversé, dormait profondément, fenêtres et portes closes. Et, dès que le directeur eut sauté du lit, les yeux gros encore de sommeil, il fut accablé : de quart d’heure en quart d’heure, des messagers accouraient, des dépêches tombaient sur son bureau, dru comme grêle. D’abord, il espéra que la révolte se limitait au Voreux ; mais les nouvelles devenaient plus graves à chaque minute : c’était Mirou, c’était Crèvecœur, c’était Madeleine, où il n’avait paru que les palefreniers ; c’étaient la Victoire et Feutry-Cantel, les deux fosses les mieux disciplinées, dans lesquelles la descente se trouvait réduite d’un tiers ; Saint-Thomas seul avait son monde au complet et semblait demeurer en dehors du mouvement. Jusqu’à neuf heures, il dicta les dépêches, télégraphiant de tous côtés, au préfet de Lille, aux régisseurs de la Compagnie, prévenant les autorités, demandant des ordres. Il avait envoyé Négrel faire le tour des fosses voisines, pour avoir des renseignements précis.","At five o'clock Dansaert woke M. Hennebeau to tell him that not a man had gone down to the Voreux. The Deux-Cent-Quarante settlement, which he had passed through, was sleeping soundly, windows and doors closed. And as soon as the director had jumped out of bed, his eyes still heavy with sleep, he was overwhelmed: every quarter of an hour messengers came running, telegrams fell on his desk, thick as hail. At first he hoped that the revolt was confined to Voreux; but the news grew more serious every minute: it was Mirou, it was Crèvecœur, it was Madeleine, where only the grooms had appeared; they were the Victoire and Feutry-Cantel, the two best disciplined pits, in which the descent was reduced by a third; Saint-Thomas alone had his world complete and seemed to remain outside the movement.

Next it was Mirou, and then Crèvecœur, and Madeleine, where only the stablemen had turned up; then it was La Victoire and Feutry-Cantel, the two pits with the tightest discipline, yet where only a third of the men had reported for work.

"Depuis minuit, Catherine battait le dégel des routes. Chaval, en rentrant et en la trouvant couchée, l’avait mise debout d’un soufflet. Il lui criait de passer tout de suite par la porte, si elle ne voulait pas sortir par la fenêtre ; et, pleurante, vêtue à peine, meurtrie de coups de pied dans les jambes, elle avait dû descendre, poussée dehors d’une dernière claque. Cette séparation brutale l’étourdissait, elle s’était assise sur une borne, regardant la maison, attendant toujours qu’il la rappelât ; car ce n’était pas possible, il la guettait, il lui dirait de remonter, quand il la verrait grelotter ainsi, abandonnée, sans personne pour la recueillir.","Since midnight, Catherine had been beating the thaw on the roads. Chaval, on returning and finding her in bed, had slapped her to her feet. He shouted at her to go through the door at once, if she didn't want to go out through the window; and, weeping, barely dressed, bruised by kicks in the legs, she had had to go downstairs, pushed out with a final slap. This brutal separation bewildered her, she sat down on a bollard, looking at the house, still waiting for him to call her back; for it was not possible, he was watching her, he would tell her to come back upstairs, when he saw her shivering thus, abandoned, with no one to pick her up.","Since midnight Catherine had been wandering the streets in the slush. When Chaval had returned home to find her in bed, he had soon got her up again with a slap in the face. He had screamed at her to leave at once, by the door if she didn’t want to leave by the window; and so, in tears, with barely any clothes on, and badly bruised where he had kicked her in the legs, she had been forced downstairs and then dispatched into the street with one last blow. Dazed and bewildered by this brutal separation, she had sat down on a milestone, watching the house and waiting for him to call her back. For he was bound to; he would be waiting to see what she did, and when he saw her shivering in the cold like this, abandoned, with nobody in the world to put a roof over her head, he would surely call her back upstairs.","Since midnight, Catherine had been walking about the thawing roads.

"Sur la route, le grand Chaval accompagnait Catherine. Il marchait près d’elle, le bras ballants ; seulement, il la poussait de la hanche, il la conduisait, sans en avoir l’air. Elle s’aperçut tout d’un coup qu’il lui avait fait quitter le pavé et qu’ils s’engageaient ensemble dans l’étroit chemin de Réquillart. Mais elle n’eut pas le temps de se fâcher : déjà, il la tenait à la taille, il l’étourdissait d’une caresse de mots continue. Était-elle bête, d’avoir peur ! est-ce qu’il voulait du mal à un petit mignon comme elle, aussi douce que de la soie, si tendre qu’il l’aurait mangée ? Et il lui soufflait derrière l’oreille, dans le cou, il lui faisait passer un frisson sur toute la peau du corps. Elle, étouffée, ne trouvait rien à répondre. C’était vrai, qu’il semblait l’aimer. Le samedi soir, après avoir éteint la chandelle, elle s’était justement demandé ce qu’il arriverait, s’il la prenait ainsi ; puis, en s’endormant, elle avait rêvé qu’elle ne disait plus non, toute lâche de plaisir. Pourquoi donc, à la même idée, aujourd’hui, éprouvait-elle une répugnance et comme un regret ? Pendant qu’il lui chatouillait la nuque avec ses moustaches, si doucement, qu’elle en fermait les yeux, l’ombre d’un autre homme, du garçon entrevu le matin, passait dans le noir de ses paupières closes.","On the road, the great Chaval accompanied Catherine. He walked beside her, his arms dangling; only he pushed her with his hip, he led her, without seeming to. She suddenly perceived that he had made her leave the pavement and that they were taking the narrow road to Réquillart together. But she had no time to get angry: he was already holding her by the waist, dazing her with a continuous caress of words. Was she stupid to be afraid! did he want harm from a little darling like her, as soft as silk, so tender that he would have eaten her? And he was blowing behind her ear, down her neck, making her shiver all over the skin of her body. She, suffocated, found nothing to answer. It was true, he seemed to like her. On Saturday evening, after extinguishing the candle, she had just wondered what would happen if he took her like this; then, falling asleep, she had dreamed that she no longer said no, all cowardly with pleasure. Why then, at the same idea today, did she feel repugnance and something like regret? While he was tickling the back of her neck with his whiskers, so gently that she closed her eyes, the shadow of another man, of the boy glimpsed in the morning, passed through the darkness of her closed eyelids.","Chaval accompanied Catherine along the road. He walked close beside her, arms by his side but pushing her with his hip, guiding her while all the time pretending not to. Suddenly she realized that he had made her leave the road and that they were now on the narrow path that led to Réquillart. But she had no time to get cross; already his arm was round her waist and he was turning her head with his smooth patter. Silly girl, being afraid like that! How could anyone want to harm a pretty little thing like her? She was as soft and gentle as silk, so tender he could almost eat her. As Catherine felt his warm breath behind her ear and on her neck, her whole body began to quiver. She could hardly breathe and found no reply. He really did seem to love her. The previous Saturday night, when she had blown out the candle, she had lain there in bed wondering what would happen if he were to make his move like this; and when she fell asleep she had dreamed that she stopped saying no, that the prospect of pleasure had weakened her resolve. So why now did the same prospect fill her with revulsion and even somehow with a sense of regret? As he stroked the back of her neck with his moustache, so gently that she began to close her eyes, the shadow of another man, of the person she had glimpsed so briefly that morning, passed across the darkness of her unseeing pupils.","Lanky Chaval accompanied Catherine along the road.

Did he want to hurt such a little darling , who was as soft as silk, so tender that he could have devoured her? And he breathed behind her ear, in her neck, so that a shudder passed over the skin of her whole body. She felt stifled, and had nothing to reply. It was true that he seemed to love her. On Saturday evenings, after having blown out the candle, she had asked herself what would happen if he were to take her in this way; then, on going to sleep, she had dreamed that she would no longer refuse, quite overcome by pleasure. Why, then, at the same idea to-day did she feel repugnance and something like regret? While he was tickling her neck with his moustache so softly that she closed her eyes, the shadow of another man, of the lad she had seen that morning, passed over the darkness of her closed eyelids."

"L’influence d’Étienne s’élargissait, il révolutionnait peu à peu le coron. C’était une propagande sourde, d’autant plus sûre, qu’il grandissait dans l’estime de tous. La Maheude, malgré sa défiance de ménagère prudente, le traitait avec considération, en jeune homme qui la payait exactement, qui ne buvait ni ne jouait, le nez toujours dans un livre ; et elle lui faisait, chez les voisines, une réputation de garçon instruit, dont celles-ci abusaient, en le priant d’écrire leurs lettres. Il était une sorte d’homme d’affaires, chargé des correspondances, consulté par les ménages sur les cas délicats. Aussi, dès le mois de septembre, avait-il créé enfin sa fameuse caisse de prévoyance, très précaire encore, ne comptant que les habitants du coron ; mais il espérait bien obtenir l’adhésion des charbonniers de toutes les fosses, surtout si la Compagnie, restée passive, ne le gênait pas davantage. On venait de le nommer secrétaire de l’association, et il touchait même de petits appointements, pour ses écritures. Cela le rendait presque riche. Si un mineur marié n’arrive pas à joindre les deux bouts, un garçon sobre, n’ayant aucune charge, peut réaliser des économies.","Etienne's influence grew, he gradually revolutionized the settlement. It was secret propaganda, all the more sure as he grew in the esteem of all. Maheude, despite her distrust of a prudent housewife, treated him with consideration, like a young man who paid her exactly, who neither drank nor gambled, his nose always in a book; and she gave him, among the neighbours, a reputation as an educated fellow, which they abused, by asking him to write their letters. He was a sort of businessman, in charge of correspondence, consulted by households on delicate matters. Also, in the month of September, he had finally created his famous provident fund, still very precarious, counting only the inhabitants of the settlement; but he really hoped to obtain the adhesion of the charcoal makers of all the pits, especially if the Company, which had remained passive, did not bother him further. He had just been appointed secretary of the association, and he even received a small salary for his writings. It almost made him rich. If a married minor can't make ends meet, a sober boy with no burden can save money.","Étienne’s influence was growing, and he was gradually revolutionizing the village. His was a propaganda by stealth, which became more and more effective as he slowly rose in people’s esteem. La Maheude, though filled with the scepticism of a prudent housewife, nevertheless treated him with a certain deference as a young man who paid his rent on time, neither drank nor gambled, and always had his nose in a book; and among the women in the neighbourhood she created a reputation for him as an educated lad, a reputation which they took advantage of by asking him to write their letters for them. He became a sort of business agent, charged with their correspondence and consulted by households over ticklish matters. And so by September he had finally managed to set up his famous provident fund, as yet a very precarious enterprise with only the inhabitants of the village for members; but he hoped soon to secure the membership of the miners in all the pits, especially if the Company, which had so far done nothing, continued not to bother him. He had been made secretary of the fund, and even drew a small salary, to cover his clerical expenses. He was almost a rich man. While a married miner has trouble making ends meet, a steady bachelor without dependants can begin to save.","Étienne's influence increased; he gradually revolutionized the settlement. His propaganda was unseen, and all the more sure since he was growing in the estimation of all. Maheude, notwithstanding the caution of a prudent housekeeper, treated him with consideration, as a young man who paid regularly and neither drank nor gambled, with his nose always in a book; she spread abroad his reputation among the neighbours as an educated lad, a reputation which they abused by asking him to write their letters. He was a sort of business man, charged with correspondence and consulted by households in affairs of difficulty. Since September he had thus at last been able to establish his famous provident fund, which was still very precarious, only including the inhabitants of the settlement; but he hoped to be able to obtain the adhesion of the miners at all the pits, especially if the Company, which had remained passive, continued not to interfere. He had been made secretary of the association and he even received a small salary for the clerking. This made him almost rich. If a married miner can with difficulty make both ends meet, a sober lad who has no burdens can even manage to save."

"En effet, ça ne faisait rien. Et toutes deux burent lentement.

"La bande venait d’apercevoir Maigrat, sur la toiture du hangar. Dans sa fièvre, malgré sa lourdeur, il avait monté au treillage avec agilité, sans se soucier des bois qui cassaient ; et, maintenant, il s’aplatissait le long des tuiles, il s’efforçait d’atteindre la fenêtre. Mais la pente se trouvait très raide, il était gêné par son ventre, ses ongles s’arrachaient.

La Régie était là, dans l’angle de la route, un véritable palais de briques, où les gros messieurs de Paris, et des princes, et des généraux, et des personnages du gouvernement, venaient chaque automne donner de grands dîners. Elle, tout en marchant, dépensait déjà les cent sous : d’abord du pain, puis du café ; ensuite, un quart de beurre, un boisseau de pommes de terre, pour la soupe du matin et la ratatouille du soir ; enfin, peut-être un peu de fromage de cochon, car le père avait besoin de viande.","Now he only had the bourgeois of Piolaine left.

"La Mouquette se désespérait à l’attendre, assise sur une poutre, malgré le grand froid. Quand elle l’aperçut, elle lui sauta au cou ; et ce fut comme s’il lui enfonçait un couteau dans le cœur, lorsqu’il lui dit sa volonté de ne plus la voir. Mon Dieu ! pourquoi ? est-ce qu’elle ne l’aimait point assez ? Craignant de succomber lui-même à l’envie d’entrer chez elle, il l’entraînait vers la route, il lui expliquait, le plus doucement possible, qu’elle le compromettait aux yeux des camarades, qu’elle compromettait la cause de la politique. Elle s’étonna, qu’est-ce que ça pouvait faire à la politique ? Enfin, la pensée lui vint qu’il rougissait de la connaître ; d’ailleurs, elle n’en était pas blessée, c’était tout naturel ; et elle lui offrit de recevoir une gifle devant le monde, pour avoir l’air de rompre. Mais il la reverrait, rien qu’une petite fois, de temps à autre. Éperdument, elle le suppliait, elle jurait de se cacher, elle ne le garderait pas cinq minutes. Luis, très ému, refusait toujours. Il le fallait. Alors, en la quittant, il voulut au moins l’embrasser. Pas à pas, ils étaient arrivés aux premières maisons de Montsou, et ils se tenaient à pleins bras, sous la lune large et ronde, lorsqu’une femme passa près d’eux, avec un brusque sursaut, comme si elle avait buté contre une pierre.","La Mouquette was in despair waiting for him, seated on a beam, in spite of the great cold. When she saw him, she jumped on his neck; and it was as if he plunged a knife into her heart, when he told her of his wish not to see her again. My God ! Why ? didn't she love him enough? Fearing himself to succumb to the urge to enter her house, he dragged her towards the road, he explained to her, as gently as possible, that she was compromising him in the eyes of his comrades, that she was compromising the cause of politics. She wondered, what could that do to politics? At last the thought came to him that he blushed to know her; besides, she was not hurt by it, it was quite natural; and she offered to receive him a slap in front of the world, to appear to break. But he would see her again, just once in a while. Madly, she begged him, she swore to hide, she wouldn't keep him for five minutes. Luis, very moved, still refused. He had to. So, when he left her, he wanted to at least kiss her. Step by step, they had arrived at the first houses of Montsou, and they were standing with arms outstretched, under the broad and round moon, when a woman passed close to them, with a sudden start, as if she had stumbled against a rock.","Despite the severe cold, La Mouquette had been waiting anxiously for him, seated on an old beam. When she caught sight of him, she threw her arms round his neck; and it was as though he had plunged a knife into her heart when he told her that he did not want to see her any more. My God! Why not? Surely she loved him enough? Afraid that he might succumb to his desire to go inside with her, he walked her towards the road and explained as gently as he could that she was compromising him in the eyes of his comrades, that she was endangering the political cause. She was amazed: what on earth had it got to do with politics? Eventually she decided that he must be ashamed of her – not that she was offended, it was perfectly natural – and so she offered to let him slap her in public so as to give the impression that they had broken up. But he would still see her from time to time, just for a little while. She pleaded madly with him, promising to keep out of sight and that she wouldn’t keep him more than five minutes. Étienne was very torn, but continued to refuse. He had to. Then, by way of goodbye, he made to kiss her. Imperceptibly they had reached the first houses in Montsou, and they were standing there with their arms round each other under a broad full moon when a female figure passed them and gave a sudden start as if she had tripped on a stone.","Mouquette, seated on a beam in spite of the great cold, had grown desperate in waiting for him.

"L’homme était parti de Marchiennes vers deux heures. Il marchait d’un pas allongé, grelottant sous le coton aminci de sa veste et de son pantalon de velours. Un petit paquet, noué dans un mouchoir à carreaux, le gênait beaucoup ; et il le serrait contre ses flancs, tantôt d’un coude, tantôt de l’autre, pour glisser au fond de ses poches les deux mains à la fois, des mains gourdes que les lanières du vent d’est faisaient saigner. Une seule idée occupait sa tête vide d’ouvrier sans travail et sans gîte, l’espoir que le froid serait moins vif après le lever du jour. Depuis une heure, il avançait ainsi, lorsque sur la gauche, à deux kilomètres de Montsou, il aperçut des feux rouges, trois brasiers brûlant au plein air, et comme suspendus. D’abord, il hésita, pris de crainte ; puis, il ne put résister au besoin douloureux de se chauffer un instant les mains.","The man had left Marchiennes around two o'clock. He walked with a lengthened step, shivering under the thin cotton of his corduroy jacket and trousers. A small bundle, tied in a checkered handkerchief, was very much in the way; and he hugged him to his sides, now with one elbow, now with the other, to slip both hands at the same time into his pockets, numb hands which the straps of the east wind were making bleed. A single thought occupied his empty worker's head without work and without shelter, the hope that the cold would be less intense after daybreak. He had been advancing in this way for an hour, when on the left, two kilometers from Montsou, he saw red lights, three braziers burning in the open air, as if suspended. At first he hesitated, seized with fear; then he could not resist the painful need to warm his hands for a moment.","The man had left Marchiennes around two o’clock in the morning. He walked with long strides, shivering in his threadbare cotton jacket and his corduroy trousers.

Homeless and out of work, he had only one thing on his vacant mind: the hope that the cold would be less severe once day had broken. He had been walking like this for an hour when, two kilometres outside Montsou, he saw some red fires over to his left, three braziers burning out in the open as though suspended in mid-air. At first he hesitated, suddenly afraid; but then he could not resist the painful urge to warm his hands for a moment.","The man had set out from Marchiennes about two o'clock. He walked with long strides, shivering beneath his worn cotton jacket and corduroy breeches.

A single idea occupied his head--the empty head of a workman without work and without lodging--the hope that the cold would be less keen after sunrise. For an hour he went on thus, when on the left, two kilometres from Montsou, he saw red flames, three fires burning in the open air and apparently suspended. At first he hesitated, half afraid.

"Poussée, bousculée, la Maheude s’entassa au fond d’une berline, avec quatre autres. On tira la corde du signal pour taper à la viande, la cage se décrocha, tomba dans la nuit ; et il n’y eut plus que la fuite rapide du câble.","Pushed, jostled, Maheude piled into the back of a sedan, with four others. They pulled the signal rope to kick the meat, the cage unhooked, fell into the night; and there was only the rapid escape of the cable.","Having been pushed and jostled, La Maheude crammed into a tub with four other miners.

The signal-cord was drawn to strike for meat, the cage was unhooked and fell into the night, and there was nothing more but the rapid flight of the cable."
"Mouque, du reste, avertissait depuis huit jours le maître porion. Mais on s’inquiétait bien d’un cheval malade, en ce moment-là ! Ces messieurs n’aimaient guère déplacer les chevaux. Maintenant, il fallait pourtant se décider à le sortir. La veille, le palefrenier avait passé une heure avec deux hommes, ficelant Trompette. On attela Bataille, pour l’amener jusqu’au puits. Lentement, le vieux cheval tirait, traînait le camarade mort, par une galerie si étroite, qu’il devait donner des secousses, au risque de l’écorcher ; et, harassé, il branlait la tête, en écoutant le long frôlement de cette masse attendue chez l’équarrisseur. À l’accrochage, quand on l’eut dételé, il suivit de son œil morne les préparatifs de la remonte, le corps poussé sur des traverses, au-dessus du puisard, le filet attaché sous une cage. Enfin, les chargeurs sonnèrent à la viande, il leva le cou pour le regarder partir, d’abord doucement, puis tout de suite noyé de ténèbres, envolé à jamais en haut de ce trou noir. Et il demeurait le cou allongé, sa mémoire vacillante de bête se souvenait peut-être des choses de la terre. Mais c’était fini, le camarade ne verrait plus rien, lui-même serait ainsi ficelé en un paquet pitoyable, le jour où il remonterait par là. Ses pattes se mirent à trembler, le grand air qui venait des campagnes lointaines l’étouffait ; et il était comme ivre, quand il rentra pesamment à l’écurie.","Mouque, moreover, had been warning the foreman for a week past. But we were worried about a sick horse at the time! These gentlemen did not like to move horses. Now, however, we had to decide to take it out. The day before, the groom had spent an hour with two men, tying Trumpet. Bataille was harnessed to bring him to the well. Slowly the old horse pulled, dragged the dead comrade through a gallery so narrow that he had to give a jolt, at the risk of skinning him; and, exhausted, he shook his head, listening to the long rustle of this mass expected at the knacker's. At the collision, when he was unhitched, he followed with his dull eye the preparations for the remount, the body pushed on crosspieces, above the sump, the net tied under a cage. Finally, the loaders rang the meat, he craned his neck to watch it go, softly at first, then immediately drowned in darkness, flown forever up this black hole. And he remained with his neck stretched out, his flickering animal memory perhaps remembering the things of the earth. But it was over, the comrade would no longer see anything, he himself would thus be tied up in a pitiful bundle, the day he came up that way. His paws began to tremble, the fresh air that came from the distant countryside suffocated him; and he was as if drunk when he lumbered back to the stable.","In fact Mouque had been warning the overman for the past week. But what did they care about a sick horse at a time like this! These gentlemen were not keen on moving horses. But now they really would have to do something about getting him out. The previous day the stableman and two other men had spent an hour trying ropes round Trumpet, and then Battle was harnessed to haul him as far as the shaft. Slowly the old horse pulled his dead comrade along, dragging him through a tunnel which was so narrow that he had to jerk him forward from time to time, at the risk of skinning him. It was heavy going, and the horse kept shaking his head as he listened to this mass of flesh scraping against the rock on its way to the knacker’s yard. When they unharnessed him at pit-bottom, he gazed with a doleful eye at the preparations for Trumpet’s ascent, watching as they pushed him on to cross-beams placed over the sump and roped him to the bottom of a cage. Eventually the onsetters signalled that the ‘meat’ was on its way, and he raised his head to watch him leave, gently at first, then suddenly being whisked away into the darkness, lost for ever up the black hole. And as he stood there craning his neck, the animal could perhaps dimly remember the things of this earth. But it was all over, his comrade would never see anything ever again, and one day he too would be tied into a miserable parcel like this and make his way to the surface. His legs started trembling, and he began to choke on the fresh air coming down from those distant landscapes; and as he plodded slowly back to his stable, it was as though he were drunk.","Mouque had indeed warned the head captain a week ago. But much they troubled about a sick horse at such time as this! These gentlemen did not at all like moving the horses. Now, however, they had to make up their minds to take him out. The evening before the groom had spent an hour with two men tying up Trompette. They harnessed Bataille to bring him to the shaft. The old horse slowly pulled, dragging his dead comrade through so narrow a gallery that he could only shake himself at the risk of taking the skin off. And he tossed his head, listening to the grazing sound of the carcass as it went to the knacker's yard. At the pit-eye, when he was unharnessed, he followed with his melancholy eye the preparations for the ascent--the body pushed on to the cross-bars over the sump, the net fastened beneath a cage. At last the porters rang meat ; he lifted his neck to see it go up, at first softly, then at once lost in the darkness, flown up for ever to the top of that black hole. And he remained with neck stretched out, his vague beast's memory perhaps recalling the things of the earth. But it was all over; he would never see his comrade again, and he himself would thus be tied up in a pitiful bundle on the day when he would ascend up there. His legs began to tremble, the fresh air which came from the distant country choked him, and he seemed intoxicated when he went heavily back to the stable."
"Étienne, pour l’éviter, était tombé sur la Pierronne, accourue au travers des jardins. Celle-ci avait accueilli comme une délivrance la mort de sa mère, dont les violences menaçaient de les faire pendre ; et elle ne pleurait guère non plus la petite de Pierron, cette gourgandine de Lydie, un vrai débarras. Mais elle se mettait avec les voisines, dans l’idée de se réconcilier.","Étienne, to avoid it, had fallen on Pierronne, who had come running through the gardens. The latter had welcomed the death of her mother as a deliverance, the violence of which threatened to have them hanged; nor did she mourn much for Pierron's little one, that cheeky Lydie, a real embarrassment. But she got together with the neighbors, with the idea of reconciling.","In trying to avoid her Étienne had run into La Pierronne, who was arriving in a hurry across the gardens. She had welcomed her mother’s death as a blessed relief, for her violent behaviour had threatened to get them all hanged.

But she now sided with her neighbours, hoping to patch things up with them:","In avoiding her, Étienne tumbled on to Pierrone, who was running up across the gardens.

"La position des soldats devenait critique, car ils avaient reçu l’ordre sévère de ne se servir de leurs armes qu’à la dernière extrémité. Et comment empêcher ces enragés-là de s’embrocher eux-mêmes ? D’autre part, l’espace diminuait, ils se trouvaient maintenant acculés contre le mur, dans l’impossibilité de reculer davantage. Leur petite troupe, une poignée d’hommes, en face de la marée montante des mineurs, tenait bon cependant, exécutait avec sang-froid les ordres brefs donnés par le capitaine. Celui-ci, les yeux clairs, les lèvres nerveusement amincies, n’avait qu’une peur, celle de les voir s’emporter sous les injures. Déjà, un jeune sergent, un grand maigre dont les quatre poils de moustaches se hérissaient, battait des paupières d’une façon inquiétante. Près de lui, un vieux chevronné, au cuir tanné par vingt campagnes, avait blêmi, quand il avait vu sa baïonnette tordue comme une paille. Un autre, une recrue sans doute, sentant encore le labour, devenait très rouge, chaque fois qu’il s’entendait traiter de crapule et de canaille. Et les violences ne cessaient pas, les poings tendus, les mots abominables, des pelletées d’accusations et de menaces qui les souffletaient au visage. Il fallait toute la force de la consigne pour les tenir ainsi, la face muette, dans le hautain et triste silence de la discipline militaire.","The position of the soldiers was becoming critical, as they had received stern orders to use their weapons only to the last extremity. And how to prevent these madmen from skewering themselves? On the other hand, the space was shrinking, they now found themselves backed against the wall, unable to move back any further. Their little troop, a handful of men, faced with the rising tide of miners, held firm, however, cold-bloodedly carrying out the brief orders given by the captain. This one, with clear eyes, nervously thinned lips, had only one fear, that of seeing them lose their temper under insults. Already a young sergeant, a tall, thin man whose four hairs on his mustache stood on end, was blinking his eyelids in a disquieting fashion. Beside him a seasoned old man, with leather tanned by twenty campaigns, had turned pale when he saw his bayonet bent like a straw. Another, a recruit no doubt, still smelling of the plowing, turned very red each time he heard himself called a scoundrel and a scoundrel. And the violence did not stop, fists outstretched, abominable words, shovelfuls of accusations and threats that slapped them in the face. It required all the strength of the orders to keep them thus, with mute faces, in the haughty and sad silence of military discipline.","The soldiers’ position was becoming critical, for they had received strict orders not to use their weapons except as a last resort. How were they supposed to stop these crazy people skewering themselves to death? Moreover they had less and less room to move, and they were now backed up against the wall without any means of retreating further. Nevertheless this small squad of soldiers, a handful of men against the rising tide of miners, was still holding firm and coolly obeying their captain’s brief commands. As he stood there nervously, tight-lipped, his eyes shining, his one fear was that his men would be provoked by all this abuse. Already a young sergeant, a tall, thin chap, was blinking in an alarming manner, and his apology of a moustache was bristling. Near by a seasoned veteran with a skin tanned by umpteen campaigns had turned pale on seeing his bayonet twisted like a straw. Another man, a recent recruit no doubt, who still smelled of the ploughfield, flushed crimson every time he heard himself called a sod or a bastard. And there was no let-up in the violence of the intimidation, of the clenched fists and the foul language, of all the threats and accusations that were thrown in their faces by the shovelful. It took every ounce of military discipline to keep the men standing there like this in gloomy, disdainful silence as they carried out their orders without the shadow of an expression on their faces.","The position of the soldiers was becoming critical, for they had received strict orders not to make use of their weapons until the last extremity. And how were they to prevent these furious people from impaling themselves? Besides, the space was getting less; they were now pushed back against the wall, and it was impossible to draw further back. Their little troop--a mere handful of men--opposed to the rising flood of miners, still held its own, however, and calmly executed the brief orders given by the captain. The latter, with keen eyes and nervously compressed lips, only feared lest they should be carried away by this abuse. Already a young sergeant, a tall lean fellow whose thin moustache was bristling up, was blinking his eyes in a disquieting manner. Near him an old soldier, with tanned skin and stripes won in twenty campaigns, had grown pale when he saw his bayonet twisted like a straw. Another, doubtless a recruit still smelling the fields, became very red every time he heard himself called ""scum"" and ""riff-raff."" And the violence did not cease, the outstretched fists, the abominable words, the shovelfuls of accusations and threats which buffeted their faces.

"C’était une sourde rancune contre la Levaque, qui avait pleuré misère, la veille, pour ne rien lui prêter ; et elle la savait justement à son aise, en ce moment-là, le logeur Bouteloup ayant avancé sa quinzaine. Dans le coron, on ne se prêtait guère de ménage à ménage.","It was a secret rancor against La Levaque, who had wept miserably the day before, for not lending her anything; and she just knew she was at her ease at that moment, the lodger Bouteloup having advanced his fortnight.

"En bas, Catherine s’était d’abord occupée du feu, la cheminée de fonte, à grille centrale, flanquée de deux fours, et où brûlait constamment un feu de houille. La Compagnie distribuait par mois, à chaque famille, huit hectolitres d’escaillage, charbon dur ramassé dans les voies. Il s’allumait difficilement, et la jeune fille, qui couvrait le feu chaque soir, n’avait qu’à le secouer le matin, en ajoutant des petits morceaux de charbon tendre, triés avec soin.

"Étienne, alors, parla de la République, qui donnerait du pain à tout le monde. Mais la Maheude secoua la tête, car elle se souvenait de 48, une année de chien, qui les avait laissés nus comme des vers, elle et son homme, dans les premiers temps de leur ménage. Elle s’oubliait à en conter les embêtements d’une voix morne, les yeux perdus, la gorge à l’air, tandis que sa fille Estelle, sans lâcher son sein, s’endormait sur ses genoux.

"Bientôt, Trompette fut couché sur les dalles de fonte, comme une masse. Il ne bougeait toujours pas, il semblait dans le cauchemar de ce trou obscur, infini, de cette salle profonde, retentissante de vacarme.

Les ouvriers élargirent le cercle en plaisantant. Eh bien ! quelle bonne odeur lui trouvait-il ? Mais Bataille s’animait, sourd aux moqueries. Il lui trouvait sans doute la bonne odeur du grand air, l’odeur oubliée du soleil dans les herbes. Et il éclata tout à coup d’un hennissement sonore, d’une musique d’allégresse, où il semblait y avoir l’attendrissement d’un sanglot. C’était la bienvenue, la joie de ces choses anciennes dont une bouffée lui arrivait, la mélancolie de ce prisonnier de plus qui ne remonterait que mort.","Soon Trumpet was lying on the cast iron slabs, like a mass.

The workers widened the circle jokingly. Well ! what good smell did he find in her? But Bataille became animated, deaf to the teasing. He no doubt found in her the good smell of the open air, the forgotten smell of the sun in the grass. And it burst suddenly into a sonorous whinnying, a music of joy, in which there seemed to be the tenderness of a sob. It was the welcome, the joy of those old things from which a whiff came to him, the melancholy of this prisoner moreover who would only come back dead.","Soon Trumpet was lying in a heap on the cast-iron floor.

The workers made a circle round them and began to joke. Mmm, now then, what lovely smell was that? But Battle was becoming more excited, impervious to their mockery. He must have caught the scent of good fresh air and the long-forgotten smell of sun-drenched grass. And suddenly he gave a loud whinny, a song of gladness that could also have been a sob of tender pity. This was his way of welcoming a newcomer: with joy at the fragrant reminder of former days and with sadness at the sight of yet another prisoner who would never return to the surface alive.","Trompette was soon placed on the metal floor in a mass.

"Une colère le soulevait contre ces gens qui ne comprenaient pas.

He would have given everything, his education, his well-being, his luxury, his power as director, if he had been able to be, one day, the last of the wretches who obeyed him, free of his flesh, churl enough to slap his wife. and have fun on the neighbors. And he also wanted to die of hunger, to have an empty stomach, his stomach twisted with cramps shaking his brain with dizziness: perhaps that would have killed the eternal pain.

"Quand ils furent sortis de chez Rasseneur, Étienne et Catherine marchèrent en silence. Le dégel commençait, un dégel froid et lent, qui salissait la neige sans la fondre. Dans le ciel livide, on devinait la lune pleine, derrière de grands nuages, des haillons noirs qu’un vent de tempête roulait furieusement, très haut ; et, sur la terre, aucune haleine ne soufflait, on n’entendait que l’égouttement des toitures, d’où tombaient des paquets blancs, d’une chute molle.","When they had left Rasseneur's, Étienne and Catherine walked on in silence. The thaw was beginning, a cold, slow thaw that soiled the snow without melting it. In the livid sky, one could make out the full moon, behind great clouds, black rags that a stormy wind was rolling furiously, very high; and, on the ground, no breath blew, one heard only the dripping of the roofs, from which fell white bundles, with a soft fall.","After they left Rasseneur’s, Étienne and Catherine walked along in silence. It was beginning to thaw, a slow, chilly thaw that dirtied the snow without really melting it. In the ghostly pale sky the full moon could be glimpsed behind large clouds that were being swept along by a gale, high above them, like black rags; down below there was not a breath of wind, and all that could be heard was the water dripping from the roofs and the gentle thud as another lump of whiteness slid to the ground.","WHEN they came out of Rasseneur's, Étienne and Catherine walked on in silence. The thaw was beginning, a slow cold thaw which stained the snow without melting it. In the livid sky a full moon could be faintly seen behind great clouds, black rags driven furiously by a tempestuous wind far above; and on the earth no breath was stirring, nothing could be heard but drippings from the roofs, the falling of white lumps with a soft thud."
"En haut, rien n’avait bougé. Il constata le bon état du cuvelage supérieur. Balancé au milieu du puits, il virait, il éclairait les parois : les fuites, entre les joints, étaient si peu abondantes, que sa lampe n’en souffrait pas. Mais, à trois cents mètres, lorsqu’il arriva au cuvelage inférieur, elle s’éteignit selon ses prévisions, un jaillissement avait empli le cuffat. Dès lors, il n’eut plus pour y voir que la lampe pendue, qui le précédait dans les ténèbres. Et, malgré sa témérité, un frisson le pâlit, en face de l’horreur du désastre. Quelques pièces de bois restaient seules, les autres s’étaient effondrées avec leurs cadres ; derrière, d’énormes cavités se creusaient, les sables jaunes, d’une finesse de farine, coulaient par masses considérables ; tandis que les eaux du Torrent, de cette mer souterraine aux tempêtes et aux naufrages ignorés, s’épanchaient en un dégorgement d’écluse. Il descendit encore, perdu au centre de ces vides qui augmentaient sans cesse, battu et tournoyant sous la trombe des sources, si mal éclairé par l’étoile rouge de la lampe, filant en bas, qu’il croyait distinguer des rues, des carrefours de ville détruite, très loin, dans le jeu des grandes ombres mouvantes. Aucun travail humain n’était plus possible. Il ne gardait qu’un espoir, celui de tenter le sauvetage des hommes en péril. À mesure qu’il s’enfonçait, il entendait grandir le hurlement ; et il lui fallut s’arrêter, un obstacle infranchissable barrait le puits, un amas de charpentes, les madriers rompus des guides, les cloisons fendues des goyots, s’enchevêtrant avec les guidonnages arrachés de la pompe. Comme il regardait longuement, le cœur serré, le hurlement cessa tout d’un coup. Sans doute, devant la crue rapide, les misérables venaient de fuir dans les galeries, si le flot ne leur avait pas déjà empli la bouche.","Upstairs, nothing had moved. He noted the good condition of the upper casing. Balanced in the middle of the shaft, it turned, it lit up the walls: the leaks between the joints were so few that his lamp did not suffer. But, at three hundred meters, when he arrived at the lower casing, it went out according to his forecasts, a gush had filled the bucket. From then on, he had nothing to see except the hanging lamp, which preceded him into the darkness. And, in spite of his temerity, a shiver pales him, faced with the horror of the disaster. Some pieces of wood remained alone, the others had collapsed with their frames; behind, enormous cavities were hollowed out, yellow sands, as fine as flour, flowed in considerable masses; while the waters of the Torrent, of this subterranean sea of storms and unknown shipwrecks, poured out in a disgorgement of a sluice. He went down again, lost in the center of these ever-increasing voids, beaten and whirling beneath the whirlwind of the springs, so badly lit by the red star of the lamp, spinning downwards, which he thought he could distinguish streets, crossroads of a destroyed city, very far away, in the play of great moving shadows. No human labor was possible anymore. He only kept one hope, that of trying to save the men in danger. As he sank he heard the howl grow louder; and he had to stop, an impassable obstacle blocked the shaft, a heap of timbers, the broken planks of the guides, the split partitions of the pipes, entangling themselves with the torn handlebars of the pump. As he stared for a long time, his heart sinking, the screaming suddenly ceased. No doubt, faced with the rapid flood, the wretches had just fled into the galleries, if the flood had not already filled their mouths.","At the top nothing had shifted, and he noted that the upper tubbing was in good condition. As he hung in the middle of the shaft, he swivelled this way and that, shining his light on the sides: so few of the joints were leaking that his lamp was unaffected. But when he reached the lower tubbing, at a depth of three hundred metres, it went out just as he had foreseen: a spurt of water had landed in the tub. From then on he could see only by the light of the lamp underneath, which preceded him into the darkness. Despite his cool nerve he shivered and turned pale at the sight of the full horror of the disaster. Only a few timber staves in the tubbing remained; the others had disappeared along with their frames. Behind them yawned huge cavities from which the yellow sand, as fine as flour, was pouring out in considerable quantities, while the waters of the Torrent, that forgotten, underground sea with its own storms and wrecks, were gushing forth as though from an open sluice. He went lower, lost in the midst of these empty spaces that were now growing ever wider. The water spouting from the underground springs battered his tub and spun him round, and he was so poorly served by the red star of his lamp as it sped downwards that it was like seeing the streets and crossroads of some distant, ruined city when he gazed into the huge, dancing shadows. It would never be possible for human beings to work down here again, and he had but one hope left, that of rescuing the miners whose lives were in danger. The further he descended, the louder grew the screaming, but then he had to stop, for an impassable obstacle was blocking the shaft: a pile of tubbing staves, the broken beams of the cage-rails, and the shattered remains of the escape shaft partitions all lay in a tangled mass together with the splintered cable-guides that had once led to the pump. As he stared steadily down at the scene, his heart sinking, the screaming suddenly stopped. No doubt, faced with the rapidly rising flood, the poor people had fled into the roadways – if the water had not already filled their lungs.","At the upper part nothing had moved. He found that the tubbing here was in good condition. Balanced in the middle of the shaft he lighted up the walls as he turned round; the leaks between the joints were so slight that his lamp did not suffer. But at three hundred metres, when he reached the lower tubbing, the lamp was extinguished, as he expected, for a jet had filled the tub. After that he was only able to see by the hanging lamp which preceded him in the darkness, and, in spite of his courage, he shuddered and turned pale in the face of the horror of the disaster. A few pieces of timber alone remained; the others had fallen in with their frames. Behind, enormous cavities had been hollowed out, and the yellow sand, as fine as flour, was flowing in considerable masses; while the waters of the Torrent, that subterranean sea with its unknown tempests and shipwrecks, were discharging in a flow like a weir. He went down lower, lost in the midst of these chasms which continued to multiply, beaten and turned round by the waterspout of the springs, so badly lighted by the red star of the lamp moving on below, that he seemed to distinguish the roads and squares of some destroyed town far away in the play of the great moving shadows. No human work was any longer possible. His only remaining hope was to attempt to save the men in peril. As he sank down he heard the cries becoming louder, and he was obliged to stop; an impassable obstacle barred the shaft--a mass of scaffolding, the broken joists of the guides, the split brattices entangled with the metal-work torn from the pump. As he looked on for a long time with aching heart, the yelling suddenly ceased. No doubt, the rapid rise of the water had forced the wretches to flee into the galleries, if, indeed, the flood had not already filled their mouths."

"C’était la commune histoire des promiscuités du coron, les garçons et les filles pourrissant ensemble, se jetant à cul, comme ils disaient, sur la toiture basse et en pente du carin, dès la nuit tombée. Toutes les herscheuses faisaient là leur premier enfant, quand elles ne prenaient pas la peine d’aller le faire à Réquillart ou dans les blés. Ça ne tirait pas à conséquence, on se mariait ensuite, les mères seules se fâchaient, lorsque les garçons commençaient trop tôt, car un garçon qui se mariait ne rapportait plus à la famille.","It was the common story of the promiscuity of the settlement, the boys and the girls rotting together, throwing themselves assholes, as they said, on the low and sloping roof of the carin, as soon as night fell. All the putters had their first child there, when they did not take the trouble to go and do it at Réquillart or in the wheat fields. It didn't matter, we got married afterwards, the single mothers got angry when the boys started too early, because a boy who got married no longer brought in the family.","In a crowded village where everyone lived cheek by jowl it was a common story. Flung together at a young age, its boys and girls soon went to the bad, having their end away, as they put it,1 on the low sloping roof of the shed as soon as darkness fell. This was where the putters conceived their first baby, that is if they couldn’t be bothered to go as far as Réquillart or the cornfields. It didn’t matter, though, they got married eventually. It was only the mothers who were cross when their sons started too early, because once the lad was married he stopped bringing money home to his family.","It was the usual history of the promiscuities of the settlement; boys and girls became corrupted together, throwing themselves on their backsides, as they said, on the low, sloping roof of the shed when twilight came on. All the putters got their first child there when they did not take the trouble to go to Réquillart or into the cornfields. It was of no consequence; they married afterwards, only the mothers were angry when their lads began too soon, for a lad who married no longer brought anything into the family."

"Maintenant, autour d’eux, la vie souterraine grondait, avec le continuel passage des porions, le va-et-vient des trains, emportés au trot des chevaux. Sans cesse, des lampes étoilaient la nuit. Ils devaient s’effacer contre la roche, laisser la voie à des ombres d’hommes et de bêtes, dont ils recevaient l’haleine au visage. Jeanlin, courant pieds nus derrière son train, leur cria une méchanceté qu’ils n’entendirent pas, dans le tonnerre des roues. Ils allaient toujours, elle silencieuse à présent, lui ne reconnaissant pas les carrefours ni les rues du matin, s’imaginant qu’elle le perdait de plus en plus sous la terre ; et ce dont il souffrait surtout, c’était du froid, un froid grandissant qui l’avait pris au sortir de la taille, et qui le faisait grelotter davantage, à mesure qu’il se rapprochait du puits. Entre les muraillements étroits, la colonne d’air soufflait de nouveau en tempête. Ils désespéraient d’arriver jamais, lorsque, brusquement, ils se trouvèrent dans la salle de l’accrochage.","Now, around them, subterranean life rumbled, with the continual passage of foremen, the comings and goings of trains, carried away at the trot of horses. Constantly, lamps starred at night. They had to hide against the rock, leaving the way to the shadows of men and beasts, whose breath they received in their faces. Jeanlin, running barefoot behind his train, shouted a nasty rant at them which they did not hear, in the thunder of the wheels. They went on, she silent now, he not recognizing the crossroads or the morning streets, imagining that she was losing him deeper and deeper underground; and what he suffered above all was from the cold, an increasing cold which had taken hold of him on leaving the cutting, and which made him shiver the more the nearer he approached the shaft. Between the narrow walls, the column of air was blowing like a storm again. They were in despair of ever arriving when, suddenly, they found themselves in the room where the clash took place.","They now found themselves surrounded by the commotion of life underground, as deputies passed at regular intervals and tub-trains came and went, hauled along at the trot by the horses. An endless succession of Davy lamps pricked the darkness. They had to press themselves against the rock to let the shadowy presences of man and beast go past, feeling their breath on their faces as they did so. Jeanlin, running barefoot behind his train, yelled some piece of wickedness at them, but it was lost amid the rumble of the wheels. On they went, she now silent, he unable to recognize a single fork or junction from that morning’s journey and imagining that she was leading him further and further astray beneath the earth. What ailed him most was the cold: it had felt increasingly chilly ever since they had left the coal-face, and the closer they came to the shaft, the more he shivered. Once again the air being funnelled between the narrow walls was blowing like a gale. They were beginning to despair of ever reaching the shaft when suddenly they found themselves at pit-bottom.","Now the subterranean life rumbled around them with a continual passing of captains, the come and go of the trains drawn by trotting horses. Lamps starred the night everywhere. They had to efface themselves against the rock to leave the path free to shadowy men and beasts, whose breath came against their faces. Jeanlin, running barefooted behind his train, cried out some naughtiness to them which they could not hear amid the thunder of the wheels. They still went on, she now silent, he not recognizing the turnings and roads of the morning, and fancying that she was leading him deeper and deeper into the earth; and what specially troubled him was the cold, an increasing cold which he had felt on emerging from the cutting, and which caused him to shiver the more the nearer they approached the shaft. Between the narrow walls the column of air now blew like a tempest. He despaired of ever coming to the end, when suddenly they found themselves in the pit-eye hall."
"Puis, quand il les vit tous sans courage, quand il vit le maître porion chanceler, ivre d’épouvante, il l’écarta d’un geste de mépris.","Then, when he saw them all without courage, when he saw the master foreman stagger, drunk with terror, he dismissed him with a gesture of contempt.","But when he saw that none of them had the courage and watched the overman swaying on his feet, faint with terror, he brushed him aside with contempt.","Then, when he saw them all without courage, and that the head captain was tottering, giddy with terror, he pushed him aside with a movement of contempt."

"Onze heures sonnaient à la petite église du coron des Deux-Cent-Quarante, une chapelle de briques, où l’abbé Joire venait dire la messe, le dimanche. À côté, dans l’école, également en briques, on entendait les voix ânonnantes des enfants, malgré les fenêtres fermées au froid du dehors. Les larges voies, divisées en petits jardins adossés, restaient désertes, entre les quatre grands corps de maisons uniformes ; et ces jardins, ravagés par l’hiver, étalaient la tristesse de leur terre marneuse, que bossuaient et salissaient les derniers légumes. On faisait la soupe, les cheminées fumaient, une femme apparaissait, de loin en loin le long des façades, ouvrait une porte, disparaissait. D’un bout à l’autre, sur le trottoir pavé, les tuyaux de descente s’égouttaient dans des tonneaux, bien qu’il ne plût pas, tant le ciel gris était chargé d’humidité. Et ce village, bâti d’un coup au milieu du vaste plateau, bordé de ses routes noires comme d’un liséré de deuil, n’avait d’autre gaieté que les bandes régulières de ses tuiles rouges, sans cesse lavées par les averses.","Eleven o'clock struck at the little church in the settlement of Deux-Cent-Quarante, a brick chapel where Abbé Joire came to say mass on Sundays. Next door, in the schoolhouse, also made of brick, you could hear the thundering voices of the children, despite the closed windows against the cold outside. The wide streets, divided into little back-to-back gardens, remained deserted between the four large uniform blocks of houses; and these gardens, ravaged by winter, displayed the sadness of their marly soil, which was dented and soiled by the last vegetables. Soup was being made, the chimneys were smoking, a woman appeared from time to time along the facades, opened a door, disappeared. From one end to the other, on the cobblestone sidewalk, the downspouts were dripping in barrels, although it was not raining, so humid was the gray sky. And this village, built at once in the middle of the vast plateau, bordered by its black roads like a border of mourning, had no other gaiety than the regular bands of its red tiles, constantly washed by the showers. .","Eleven o’clock struck at the little church in Village Two Hundred and Forty, a brick chapel in which Father Joire came to say Mass on Sundays. From the school next door, which was also built of brick, the sound of children reciting their lessons could be heard even though the windows were shut to keep out the cold. Between the four great blocks of uniform housing, the broad avenues of tiny back-to-back gardens lay deserted; ravaged by winter, they made a sorry sight with their marly soil and the bumps and smudges of their last remaining vegetables. Indoors, soup was being prepared; smoke rose from the chimneys, and here and there along the rows of houses a woman would emerge, open another door, and disappear again. Even though it wasn’t raining, the grey sky was so heavy with moisture that drain-pipes dripped steadily into the water-butts that stood all along each pavement. This village had simply been plonked down in the middle of the vast plateau, surrounded by black roads as though by a border of condolence, and the only cheerful note was provided by the regular bands of red roof tiles, constantly washed clean by the rain.","ELEVEN o'clock struck at the little church in the Deux-Cent-Quarante settlement, a brick chapel to which Abbé Joire came to say mass on Sundays.

"Il y avait eu d’abord une rivalité entre Zacharie et Étienne. Un soir, ils s’étaient menacés d’une paire de gifles. Mais le premier, brave garçon et se moquant de ce qui n’était pas son plaisir, tout de suite apaisé par l’offre amicale d’une chope, avait dû s’incliner bientôt devant la supériorité du nouveau venu. Levaque, lui aussi, faisait bon visage maintenant, causait politique avec le herscheur, qui avait, disait-il, ses idées. Et, parmi les hommes du marchandage, celui-ci ne sentait plus une hostilité sourde que chez le grand Chaval, non pas qu’ils parussent se bouder, car ils étaient devenus camarades au contraire ; seulement, leurs regards se mangeaient, quand ils plaisantaient ensemble. Catherine, entre eux, avait repris son train de fille lasse et résignée, pliant le dos, poussant sa berline, gentille toujours pour son compagnon de roulage qui l’aidait à son tour, soumise d’autre part aux volontés de son amant dont elle subissait ouvertement les caresses. C’était une situation acceptée, un ménage reconnu sur lequel la famille elle-même fermait les yeux, à ce point que Chaval emmenait chaque soir la herscheuse derrière le terri, puis la ramenait jusqu’à la porte de ses parents, où il l’embrassait une dernière fois, devant tout le coron. Étienne, qui croyait en avoir pris son parti, la taquinait souvent avec ces promenades, lâchant pour rire des mots crus, comme on en lâche entre garçons et filles, au fond des tailles ; et elle répondait sur le même ton, disait par crânerie ce que son galant lui avait fait, troublée cependant et pâlissante, lorsque les yeux du jeune homme rencontraient les siens. Tous les deux détournaient la tête, restaient parfois une heure sans se parler, avec l’air de se haïr pour des choses enterrées en eux, et sur lesquelles ils ne s’expliquaient point.","At first there had been a rivalry between Zacharie and Etienne. One evening, they had threatened each other with a pair of slaps. But the first, a good fellow and making fun of what was not his pleasure, immediately appeased by the friendly offer of a mug, had to bow before the superiority of the newcomer. Levaque, too, was putting on a good face now, talking politics with the putter, who, he said, had his own ideas. And, among the men of the haggling, this one no longer felt a secret hostility except in the great Chaval, not that they seemed to be sulking, for on the contrary they had become comrades; only their looks devoured each other when they were joking together. Catherine, between them, had resumed her train of a weary and resigned girl, bending her back, pushing her sedan, always kind to her driving companion who helped her in turn, subject on the other hand to the wishes of her lover, of whom she openly suffered the caresses. It was an accepted situation, a recognized household to which the family itself turned a blind eye, to such an extent that Chaval took the putter behind the terrier every evening, then brought her back to her parents' door, where he took her. embraced one last time, in front of the whole settlement. Étienne, who thought he had made up his mind to it, often teased her with these walks, blurting out crude words in jest, as one blurts between boys and girls, at the bottom of the cuts; and she replied in the same tone, saying with swagger what her gallant had done to her, troubled however and turning pale when the young man's eyes met hers. Both turned their heads away, sometimes remained an hour without speaking to each other, with the air of hating each other for things buried in them, and on which they could not explain themselves.","At the beginning there had been some rivalry between Zacharie and Étienne, and one evening they had almost come to blows. But Zacharie was a good-natured lad who didn’t give a damn about anything other than his own pleasures, and so he was quickly pacified by the friendly offer of a beer. Soon he was obliged to recognize the newcomer’s superiority. Levaque, too, was now well disposed to Étienne and talked politics with this putter who, he said, had some interesting ideas. And so among the men in the team the only mute hostility that Étienne now encountered came from Chaval. Not that there was apparently any coldness between them; on the contrary, they seemed to be on friendly terms. It was just that when they laughed and joked together their eyes betrayed a mutual animosity. Now caught between them, Catherine carried on as before, the weary, submissive young girl forever arching her back and putting her shoulder to her tub. She was always kind towards her fellow-putter, who in his turn did what he could to assist her; but otherwise she was subject to the wishes of her lover, whose caresses she now publicly submitted to. It was an accepted situation, an acknowledged relationship to which her family turned a blind eye, so that each evening Chaval took Catherine off behind the spoil-heap and then brought her back to her parents’ front door, where they gave each other one last kiss in full view of the village. Étienne, who thought he’d come to terms with the situation, often teased her about these walks of hers, talking dirty with her for a laugh the way the lads and girls did down the mine; while she would give as good as she got and brag about what her lover had done to her. And yet when their eyes met, she would turn pale and feel uncomfortable. Then they would both look away again, and sometimes they went an hour without exchanging a word, as though they hated each other for some deep-seated reason that they never talked about.","There was at first some rivalry between Zacharie and Étienne. One evening they were even coming to blows. But the former, a good lad though careless of everything but his own pleasure, was quickly appeased by the friendly offer of a glass, and soon yielded to the superiority of the new-comer. Levaque was also on good terms with him, talking politics with the putter, who, as he said, had his own ideas. The only one of the men in whom he felt a deep hostility was lanky Chaval: not that they were cool towards each other, for, on the contrary, they had become companions; only when they joked their eyes seemed to devour each other. Catherine continued to move among them as a tired, resigned girl, bending her back, pushing her tram, always good-natured with her companion in the putting, who aided her in his turn, and submissive to the wishes of her lover, whose caresses she now received openly. It was an accepted situation, a recognized domestic arrangement to which the family itself closed its eyes to such a degree that Chaval every evening led away the putter behind the pit-bank, then brought her back to her parents' door, where he finally embraced her before the whole settlement. Étienne, who believed that he had reconciled himself to the situation, often teased her about these walks, making crude remarks by way of joke, as lads and girls will at the bottom of the cuttings; and she replied in the same tone, telling in a swaggering way what her lover had done to her, yet disturbed and growing pale when the young man's eyes chanced to meet hers. Then both would turn away their heads, not speaking again, perhaps, for an hour, looking as if they hated each other because of something buried within them and which they could never explain to each other."

Alzire, sponge a bit, huh!","‘The mess they make!’ muttered La Maheude, picking the clothes off the floor in order to hang them up to dry. ‘ Alzire, mop up a bit, will you?’","""What a slop they do make!"" murmured Maheude, taking up their garments from the floor to put them to dry.

"Pour se rendre au plan incliné, ils durent marcher ployés en deux, de nouveau mouillés jusqu’aux épaules. Et la montée recommença, plus dangereuse, par ce trou boisé entièrement, long d’une centaine de mètres. D’abord, ils voulurent tirer le câble, afin de fixer en bas l’un des chariots ; car si l’autre était descendu, pendant leur ascension, il les aurait broyés. Mais rien ne bougea, un obstacle faussait le mécanisme. Ils se risquèrent, n’osant se servir de ce câble qui les gênait, s’arrachant les ongles contre les charpentes lisses. Lui, venait le dernier, la retenait du crâne, quand elle glissait, les mains sanglantes. Brusquement, ils se cognèrent contre des éclats de poutre, qui barraient le plan. Des terres avaient coulé, un éboulement empêchait d’aller plus haut. Par bonheur, une porte s’ouvrait là, et ils débouchèrent dans une voie.","To get to the inclined plane, they had to walk bent over, again wet up to their shoulders. And the ascent began again, more dangerous, through this entirely wooded hole, a hundred meters long. First, they wanted to pull the cable, in order to fix one of the trolleys below; for if the other had descended during their ascent, he would have crushed them. But nothing moved, an obstacle distorted the mechanism. They ventured, not daring to use this cable which bothered them, tearing their nails against the smooth framework. He came last, held her back with her head when she slipped, her hands bloody. Suddenly, they bumped against shards of beams, which blocked the plan. Land had sunk, a landslide prevented going higher. Luckily, a door opened there, and they came out into a lane.","In order to reach the incline they had to walk bent over double and so once more found themselves up to their shoulders in water. Another climb began, a more dangerous one this time, up through a cavity a hundred metres long entirely lined with timber. They began by trying to pull on the cable so as to lodge one tub securely at the bottom, because if the other were to come down as they were climbing up, it would crush them to death. But nothing would move, something must be in the way and preventing the mechanism from working properly. They decided to risk it. Not daring to hold on to the cable, which was in their way, they scrabbled up the smooth wood, tearing their nails as they went. Étienne followed behind Catherine, stopping her with his head when she slid back, her hands bleeding. Suddenly they found themselves up against some fractured beams which were blocking the incline. The earth had shifted, and the rubble was preventing them from going any higher. Fortunately there was a doorway there, which led out into a road.","To reach the upbrow they had to walk doubled up, again wetted to the shoulders. And the climbing began anew, now more dangerous, through this hole entirely of timber, a hundred metres long. At first they wished to pull the cable so as to fix one of the carts at the bottom, for if the other should come down during their ascent, they would be crushed. But nothing moved, some obstacle interfered with the mechanism. They ventured in, not daring to make use of the cable which was in their way, and tearing their nails against the smooth framework. He came behind, supporting her by his head when she slipped with torn hands. Suddenly they came across the splinters of a beam which barred the way. A portion of the soil had fallen down and prevented them form going any higher. Fortunately a door opened here and they passed into a passage."
"Dans la plaine rase, sous la nuit sans étoiles, d’une obscurité et d’une épaisseur d’encre, un homme suivait seul la grande route de Marchiennes à Montsou dix kilomètres de pavé coupant tout droit, à travers les champs de betteraves. Devant lui, il ne voyait même pas le sol noir, et il n’avait la sensation de l’immense horizon plat que par les souffles du vent de mars, des rafales larges comme sur une mer, glacées d’avoir balayé des lieues de marais et de terres nues.

"Elle s’expliquait, en courtes phrases pénibles. C’était une vieille dette, contractée pendant la dernière grève. Vingt fois, ils avaient promis de s’acquitter, mais ils ne le pouvaient pas, ils ne parvenaient pas à lui donner quarante sous par quinzaine. Avec ça, un malheur lui était arrivé l’avant-veille, elle avait dû payer vingt francs à un cordonnier, qui menaçait de les faire saisir. Et voilà pourquoi ils se trouvaient sans un sou.

Added to which she’d had a spot of bad luck the day before yesterday; she’d had to pay a cobbler twenty francs because he’d threatened to call the bailiffs in.

Il circulait des histoires abominables, on parlait d’affiches manuscrites, menaçant les bourgeois de leur crever le ventre ; personne ne les avait lues, on n’en citait pas moins des phrases textuelles. Chez le notaire surtout, la terreur était à son comble, car il venait de recevoir par la poste une lettre anonyme, où on l’avertissait qu’un baril de poudre se trouvait enterré dans sa cave, prêt à le faire sauter, s’il ne se déclarait pas en faveur du peuple.","They left.

"Mais une maison parmi les autres, celle des Maheu, restait surtout noire et muette, dans l’accablement de son deuil. Depuis qu’elle avait accompagné son homme au cimetière, la Maheude ne desserrait pas les dents. Après la bataille, elle avait laissé Étienne ramener chez eux Catherine, boueuse, à demi morte ; et, comme elle la déshabillait devant le jeune homme, pour la coucher, elle s’était imaginé un instant que sa fille, elle aussi, lui revenait avec une balle au ventre, car la chemise avait de larges taches de sang. Mais elle comprit bientôt, c’était le flot de la puberté qui crevait enfin, dans la secousse de cette journée abominable. Ah ! une chance encore, cette blessure ! un beau cadeau, de pouvoir faire des enfants, que les gendarmes, ensuite, égorgeraient ! Et elle n’adressait pas la parole à Catherine, pas plus d’ailleurs qu’elle ne parlait à Étienne. Celui-ci couchait avec Jeanlin, au risque d’être arrêté, saisi d’une telle répugnance à l’idée de retourner dans les ténèbres de Réquillart, qu’il préférait la prison : un frisson le secouait, l’horreur de la nuit après toutes ces morts, la peur inavouée du petit soldat qui dormait là-bas, sous les roches. D’ailleurs, il rêvait de la prison comme d’un refuge, au milieu du tourment de sa défaite ; mais on ne l’inquiétait même pas, il traînait des heures misérables, ne sachant à quoi fatiguer son corps. Parfois, seulement, la Maheude les regardait tous les deux, lui et sa fille, d’un air de rancune, en ayant l’air de leur demander ce qu’ils faisaient chez elle.","But one house among the others, that of the Maheus, remained above all dark and mute, in the despondency of its mourning. Since she had accompanied her man to the cemetery, Maheude had not opened her teeth. After the battle, she had let Etienne take Catherine home, muddy, half-dead; and, as she was undressing her in front of the young man, to put her to bed, she had imagined for a moment that her daughter, too, was coming back to her with a bullet in her stomach, for the shirt had large stains of blood. But she soon understood, it was the flood of puberty that was finally bursting, in the jolt of this abominable day. Ah! one more chance, this injury! a fine gift, to be able to have children, whom the gendarmes would then cut their throats! And she did not speak to Catherine, any more than she spoke to Étienne. The latter slept with Jeanlin, at the risk of being arrested, seized with such repugnance at the idea of returning to the darkness of Réquillart, that he preferred prison: a shiver shook him, the horror of the night after all these deaths, the unacknowledged fear of the little soldier who slept over there, under the rocks. Besides, he dreamed of prison as a refuge, in the midst of the torment of his defeat; but they did not even worry him, he dragged miserable hours, not knowing what to tire his body. Only sometimes did Maheude look at the two of them, he and his daughter, with an air of resentment, as if asking them what they were doing at her house.","But one house among all the others, that of the Maheus, remained especially dark and silent, plunged in overwhelming grief. Since she had accompanied her husband’s body to the cemetery, La Maheude had not said a word to anyone. After the shooting she had let Étienne bring Catherine home with them, half dead and covered in mud; and as she was undressing her in front of the young man before putting her to bed, she had imagined for a moment that she, too, had returned with a bullet in her stomach, for there were large blood stains on her shirt. But she soon realized why; the flow of puberty had finally broken through under the shock of this terrible day. Ah, what a marvellous stroke of good fortune this menstruation was! A fine blessing indeed to be able to make babies for gendarmes to slaughter in their turn! But she did not speak to Catherine, any more than she spoke to Étienne for that matter. He was now sharing a bed with Jeanlin, at the risk of being arrested, having been seized with such dread at the idea of returning to the dark depths of Réquillart that he preferred prison: the prospect of that horrific blackness after all these deaths made him shudder, and he was secretly afraid of the young soldier at rest down there beneath the rocks. Indeed, amid the torment of his defeat, he dreamed of prison as a place of refuge; but nobody even gave him a thought, and time dragged as he endeavoured in vain to find ways of tiring himself out. Occasionally, however, La Maheude would look at them both with an air of resentment, as though she were asking them what they were doing in her house.","But one house, that of the Maheus, remained especially black and mute in its overwhelming grief. Since she had followed her man to the cemetery, Maheude kept her teeth clenched. After the battle, she had allowed Étienne to bring back Catherine muddy and half dead; and as she was undressing her, before the young man, in order to put her to bed, she thought for a moment that her daughter also had received a ball in the belly, for the chemise was marked with large patches of blood. But she soon understood that it was the flood of puberty, which was at last breaking out in the shock of this abominable day. Ah! another piece of luck, that wound! A fine present, to be able to make children for the gendarmes to kill; and she never spoke to Catherine, nor did she, indeed, talk to Étienne. The latter slept with Jeanlin, at the risk of being arrested, seized by such horror at the idea of going back to the darkness of Réquillart that he would have preferred a prison. A shudder shook him, the horror of the night after all those deaths, an unacknowledged fear of the little soldier who slept down there underneath the rocks. Besides, he dreamed of a prison as of a refuge in the midst of the torment of his defeat; but they did not trouble him, and he dragged on his wretched hours, not knowing how to weary out his body. Only at times Maheude looked at both of them, at him and her daughter, with a spiteful air, as though she were asking them what they were doing in her house."
"Jusqu’à dix heures, on resta. Des femmes arrivaient toujours, pour rejoindre et emmener leurs hommes ; des bandes d’enfants suivaient à la qu’elle ; et les mères ne se gênaient plus, sortaient des mamelles longues et blondes comme des sacs d’avoine, barbouillaient de lait les poupons joufflus ; tandis que les petits qui marchaient déjà, gorgés de bière et à quatre pattes sous les tables, se soulageaient sans honte. C’était une mer montante de bière, les tonnes de la veuve Désir éventrées, la bière arrondissant les panses, coulant de partout, du nez, des yeux et d’ailleurs. On gonflait si fort, dans le tas, que chacun avait une épaule ou un genou qui entrait chez le voisin, tous égayés, épanouis de se sentir ainsi les coudes. Un rire continu tenait les bouches ouvertes, fendues jusqu’aux oreilles. Il faisait une chaleur de four, on cuisait, on se mettait à l’aise, la chair dehors, dorée dans l’épaisse fumée des pipes ; et le seul inconvénient était de se déranger, une fille se levait de temps à autre, allait au fond, près de la pompe, se troussait, puis revenait. Sous les guirlandes de papier peint, les danseurs ne se voyaient plus, tellement ils suaient ; ce qui encourageait les galibots à culbuter les herscheuses, au hasard des coups de reins. Mais, lorsqu’une gaillarde tombait avec un homme par-dessus elle, le piston couvrait leur chute de sa sonnerie enragée, le branle des pieds les roulait, comme si le bal se fût éboulé sur eux.","We stayed until ten o'clock. Women always arrived, to join and take away their men; bands of children followed her; and the mothers no longer bothered themselves, coming out of their long, blond teats like sacks of oats, slathering the chubby infants with milk; while the little ones who were already walking, gorged with beer and on all fours under the tables, relieved themselves shamelessly. It was a rising sea of beer, the disemboweled barrels of the widow Désir, the beer rounding the bellies, flowing everywhere, from the nose, the eyes and elsewhere. We swelled so much, in the heap, that each one had a shoulder or a knee that went into the neighbor's, all cheered, fulfilled to feel the elbows thus. Continuous laughter kept the mouths open, slit to the ears. It was as hot as an oven, we cooked, we made ourselves comfortable, the flesh outside, golden in the thick smoke of the pipes; and the only inconvenience was getting in the way, a girl would get up from time to time, go to the back, near the pump, bundle up, then come back. Under the garlands of wallpaper, the dancers could no longer see each other, they were sweating so much; which encouraged the tramps to tumble over the putters, haphazardly with jerks. But when a strapping girl fell with a man on top of her, the piston drowned their fall with its furious ringing, the shaking of the feet rolled them, as if the ball had fallen on them.","They sat on till ten o’clock. Women were still arriving, trailing hordes of children and having come to collect their menfolk and take them home. The mothers among them, past caring, pulled out long, pale breasts like so many sacks of oats and splattered chubby babies with milk, while toddlers full of beer crawled on all fours beneath the tables and relieved themselves unconcernedly. And all around them rose a tide of beer from Widow Desire’s emptying barrels, turning bellies round and taut, flowing out of every orifice, from noses, eyes and elsewhere. There was such a general swelling among this mass of people that by now each of them had an elbow or a knee digging into their neighbour, and everyone beamed away merrily at being packed in so tight. In the continuous laughter mouths gaped fixedly, like cracks running from ear to ear. It was baking hot, and as they took their ease and bared their flesh, they all gently cooked, golden brown amid the thick pall of pipe smoke. The only disturbance came when they had to let someone past, for every so often a girl got up, went out to the place by the pump at the far end of the hall, hitched her skirts and then returned. Beneath the paper garlands the dancers were sweating so much they couldn’t see each other, which encouraged the pit-boys to try knocking the putters flying with a casual collision of backsides. But whenever a girl fell over with a man on top of her, the cornet’s furious tooting covered the sound of their fall, and they would be buried under a whirl of feet as though the whole dance-hall had rolled over them like a landslide.","They remained there till ten o'clock. Women continued to arrive, either to join or to take away their men; bands of children followed in rows, and the mothers no longer troubled themselves, pulling out their long pale breasts, like sacks of oats, and smearing their chubby babies with milk; while the little ones who were already able to walk, gorged with beer and on all fours beneath the table, relieved themselves without shame. It was a rising sea of beer, from Madame Désir's disembowelled barrels, the beer enlarged every belly, flowing from noses, eyes, and everywhere. So puffed out was the crowd that every one had a shoulder or knee poking into his neighbour; all were cheerful and merry in thus feeling each other's elbows. A continuous laugh kept their mouths open from ear to ear. The heat was like an oven; they were roasting and felt themselves at ease with glistening skin, gilded in a thick smoke from the pipes; the only discomfort was when one had to move away; from time to time a girl rose, went to the other end, near the pump, lifted her clothes, and then came back. Beneath the garlands of painted paper the dancers could no longer see each other, they perspired so much; this encouraged the trammers to tumble the putters over, catching them at random by the hips. But where a girl tumbled with a man over her, the cornet covered their fall with its furious music; the swirl of feet wrapped them round as if the ball had collapsed upon them."

These starry-eyed revolutionaries could destroy society and build another one if they liked, but it wouldn’t add one jot to the sum total of human joy. They could hand out a slice of bread to every man, woman and child, but not one of them would be the slightest bit less miserable. Indeed they would be spreading yet more unhappiness across the face of the earth, for the fact was that one day even the dogs would howl in despair when they had finally stirred everyone from the tranquillity of sated instinct and raised them to the higher suffering of unfulfilled desire. No, the only good in life lay in not being – or, if one had to be, then in being a tree, a stone, or even less than that, the grain of sand that cannot bleed beneath the grinding heel of a passer-by.","He could eat, and all the same he was groaning with torment. His desolate household, his whole wounded life, choked him at the throat like a death agony. Things were not all for the best because one had bread. Who was the fool who placed earthly happiness in the partition of wealth? These revolutionary dreamers might demolish society and rebuilt another society; they would not add one joy to humanity , they would not take away one pain, by cutting bread-and-butter for everybody. They would even enlarge the unhappiness of the earth; they would one day make the very dogs howl with despair when they had taken them out of the tranquil satisfaction of instinct, to raise them to the unappeasable suffering of passion. No, the one good thing was not to exist, and if one existed, to be a tree, a stone, less still, a grain of sand, which cannot bleed beneath the heels of the passer-by."
"Pierron, interrogé, lui qui travaillait depuis plusieurs jours, ne voulut pas montrer sa peur, qui pouvait être considérée comme une attaque à la Direction ; et il répondit :","Pierron, questioned, he who had been working for several days, did not want to show his fear, which could be considered as an attack on management; and he replied:","They asked Pierron, who had been back at work for some days, but he didn’t want to let on that he was afraid in case it was interpreted as criticism of the management; and so he replied:","Pierron, who had been working for several days, when asked about it did not like to show his fear, which might be considered as an attack on the management, so he only replied:"
"Au jour, la Maheude, abattue près de Catherine morte, jeta un cri, puis un autre, puis un autre, de grandes plaintes très longues, incessantes. Plusieurs cadavres étaient déjà remontés et alignés par terre : Chaval que l’on crut assommé sous un éboulement, un galibot et deux haveurs également fracassés, le crâne vide de cervelle, le ventre gonflé d’eau. Des femmes, dans la foule, perdaient la raison, déchiraient leurs jupes, s’égratignaient la face. Lorsqu’on le sortit enfin, après l’avoir habitué aux lampes et nourri un peu, Étienne apparut décharné, les cheveux tout blancs ; et on s’écartait, on frémissait devant ce vieillard. La Maheude s’arrêta de crier, pour le regarder stupidement, de ses grands yeux fixes.","At daybreak, Maheude, dejected near the dead Catherine, uttered a cry, then another, then another, great, very long, incessant complaints. Several corpses had already been brought up and lined up on the ground: Chaval, who was thought to have been stunned by a landslide, a tramp and two pikemen also shattered, his skull empty of brains, his stomach swollen with water. Women in the crowd were losing their minds, tearing their skirts, scratching their faces. When they finally took him out, after accustoming him to the lamps and feeding him a little, Étienne appeared emaciated, his hair completely white; and we moved away, we shuddered before this old man. Maheude stopped crying, to stare at him stupidly with her large staring eyes.","Up above, La Maheude lay slumped by the side of Catherine’s body uttering one long , wailing scream after another in unceasing lament. Several other bodies had already been brought up and placed in a row on the ground; Chaval, who was presumed to have been crushed by a rock-fall, one pit-boy and two hewers whose bodies had been similarly smashed, their skulls now emptied of brains and their bellies swollen with water. Some women in the crowd were going out of their minds, tearing at their skirts and scratching themselves in the face. When they finally brought Étienne out, having accustomed him to the light of the lamps and fed him a little, he was no more than a skeleton, and his hair had turned completely white. People moved away, shuddering at the sight of this old man. La Maheude stopped screaming and gazed at him blankly with huge, staring eyes.","At the surface, Maheude, stricken down near dead Catherine, uttered a cry, then another, then another--very long, deep, incessant moans. Several corpses had already been brought up, and placed in a row on the ground: Chaval, who was thought to have been crushed beneath a landslip. a trammer, and two hewers, also crushed, with brainless skulls and bellies swollen with water. Women in the crowd went out of their minds, tearing their skirts and scratching their faces. When Étienne was at last taken out, after having been accustomed to the lamps and fed a little, he appeared fleshless, and his hair was quite white. People turned away and shuddered at this old man. Maheude left off crying to stare at him stupidly with her large fixed eyes."
"– D’autant plus, ajouta Étienne, qu’on devrait d’abord créer ici une caisse de prévoyance, dont nous ferions à l’occasion une caisse de résistance… N’importe, il est temps de songer à ces choses. Moi, je suis prêt, si les autres sont prêts.","“All the more so,” added Etienne, “because we should first create a provident fund here, which we would make on occasion a resistance fund. No matter, it is time to think about these things. I am ready, if the others are ready.","‘Especially,’ Étienne added, ‘as we ought to start by setting up a miners’ provident fund, which could if necessary be used as a fighting fund… At any rate, it’s time we thought about these things. I’m game if the others are.’","""All the more,"" added Étienne, ""because we must first have here a provident fund, which we can use if need be as an emergency fund. No matter, it is time to think about these things. I am ready if the others are."""
"Pourtant, un continuel va-et-vient emplissait de monde la maison des Maheu. Étienne, à titre de secrétaire, y avait partagé les trois mille francs de la caisse de prévoyance, entre les familles nécessiteuses ; ensuite, de divers côtés, étaient arrivées quelques centaines de francs, produites par des souscriptions et des quêtes. Mais, aujourd’hui, toutes les ressources s’épuisaient, les mineurs n’avaient plus d’argent pour soutenir la grève, et la faim était là, menaçante. Maigrat, après avoir promis un crédit d’une quinzaine, s’était brusquement ravisé au bout de huit jours, coupant les vivres. D’habitude, il prenait les ordres de la Compagnie ; peut-être celle-ci désirait-elle en finir tout de suite, en affamant les corons. Il agissait d’ailleurs en tyran capricieux, donnait ou refusait du pain, suivant la figure de la fille que les parents envoyaient aux provisions ; et il fermait surtout sa porte à la Maheude, plein de rancune, voulant la punir de ce qu’il n’avait pas eu Catherine. Pour comble de misère, il gelait très fort, les femmes voyaient diminuer leur tas de charbon, avec la pensée inquiète qu’on ne le renouvellerait plus aux fosses, tant que les hommes ne redescendraient pas. Ce n’était point assez de crever de faim, on allait aussi crever de froid.","However, a continual coming and going filled the Maheu house with people. Étienne, as secretary, had divided the three thousand francs from the provident fund there among needy families; then, from various quarters, several hundred francs had arrived, produced by subscriptions and collections. But today, all the resources were running out, the miners had no more money to support the strike, and hunger was there, threatening. Maigrat, after promising a fortnight's credit, had suddenly changed his mind after eight days, cutting off supplies. Usually he took orders from the Company; perhaps the latter wanted to get it over with right away, by starving the settlements. Besides, he acted like a capricious tyrant, giving or refusing bread, according to the face of the girl whom the parents sent to buy provisions; and above all he closed his door to Maheude, full of resentment, wishing to punish her for not having had Catherine. To make matters worse, it was freezing very hard, the women saw their heaps of coal diminishing, with the worried thought that they would no longer renew it in the pits until the men came down again. It was not enough to die of hunger, we were also going to die of cold.","Nevertheless the Maheus’ house was constantly full of people coming and going. It was here that Étienne, as secretary, had shared out the three thousand francs in the provident fund among the most needy families. After that a few hundred francs more had come in from various sources, some as fund contributions and some from collections, but their resources were running out now. The miners had no money left to carry on the strike, and hunger was staring them in the face. Maigrat had promised everyone a fortnight’s credit but then suddenly changed his mind after the first week and cut off supplies. Generally he did what the Company told him, so perhaps they were trying to force the issue by making everyone starve. On top of which he acted like some capricious tyrant, providing or withholding bread depending on the looks of the girl the parents had sent for their food; and he was never open for La Maheude, since he bore her a deep grudge and wanted to punish her for the fact that he had not yet had Catherine. To make matters even worse the weather was bitterly cold, and the women watched their supply of coal dwindling with the anxious thought that it would not be replenished as long as the men refused to go down the pits. As if it were not enough that they were going to die of hunger, they were now going to freeze to death as well.","There was, however, a continuous coming and going of people in the Maheus' house. Étienne, as secretary, had divided the three thousand francs of the provident fund among the needy families; afterwards from various sides several hundred francs had arrived, yielded by subscriptions and collections. But now all their resources were exhausted; the miners had no more money to keep up the strike, and hunger was there, threatening them. Maigrat, after having promised credit for a fortnight, had suddenly altered his mind at the end of a week and cut off provisions. He usually took his orders from the Company; perhaps the latter wished to bring the matter to an end by starving the settlements. He acted besides like a capricious tyrant, giving or refusing bread according to the look of the girl who was sent by her parents for provisions; and he especially closed his door spitefully to Maheude, wishing to punish her because he had not been able to get Catherine. To complete their misery it was freezing very hard, and the women watched their piles of coal diminish, thinking anxiously that they could no longer renew them at the pits now that the men were not going down. It was not enough to die of hunger, they must also die of cold."
"Une rafale leur coupa la parole. Puis, Étienne demanda, en montrant le tas sombre des constructions, au pied du terri :","A burst cut them off. Then Étienne asked, pointing to the dark heap of buildings at the foot of the pit:","A sudden squall interrupted the two men. Then, pointing down at the dark huddle of buildings at the foot of the spoil-heap, Étienne asked:","A gust cut short their speech. Then Étienne asked, pointing to the sombre pile of buildings at the foot of the platform:"
"– Tu es donc une fille ? murmura-t-il, stupéfait.","""So you're a girl?"" he whispered, amazed.","‘So you’re a girl, then?’ he murmured in amazement.","""You are a girl, then!"" he exclaimed, stupefied."
"Dès lors, Étienne chevauchait sa question favorite, l’attribution des instruments de travail à la collectivité, ainsi qu’il le répétait en une phrase, dont la barbarie le grattait délicieusement. Chez lui, à cette heure, l’évolution était complète. Parti de la fraternité attendrie des catéchumènes, du besoin de réformer le salariat, il aboutissait à l’idée politique de le supprimer. Depuis la réunion du Bon-Joyeux, son collectivisme, encore humanitaire et sans formule, s’était raidi en un programme compliqué, dont il discutait scientifiquement chaque article. D’abord, il posait que la liberté ne pouvait être obtenue que par la destruction de l’État. Puis, quand le peuple se serait emparé du gouvernement, les réformes commenceraient : retour à la commune primitive, substitution d’une famille égalitaire et libre à la famille morale et oppressive, égalité absolue, civile, politique et économique, garantie de l’indépendance individuelle grâce à la possession et au produit intégral des outils du travail, enfin instruction professionnelle et gratuite, payée par la collectivité. Cela entraînait une refonte totale de la vieille société pourrie ; il attaquait le mariage, le droit de tester, il réglementait la fortune de chacun, il jetait bas le monument inique des siècles morts, d’un grand geste de son bras, toujours le même, le geste du faucheur qui rase la moisson mûre ; et il reconstruisait ensuite de l’autre main, il bâtissait la future humanité, l’édifice de vérité et de justice, grandissant dans l’aurore du vingtième siècle. À cette tension cérébrale, la raison chancelait, il ne restait que l’idée fixe du sectaire. Les scrupules de sa sensibilité et de son bons sens étaient emportés, rien ne devenait plus facile que la réalisation de ce monde nouveau : il avait tout prévu, il en parlait comme d’une machine qu’il monterait en deux heures, et ni le feu ni le sang ne lui coûtaient.","From then on, Étienne straddled his favorite question, the attribution of the instruments of labor to the community, as he repeated in one sentence, the barbarity of which scratched him deliciously. With him, at this hour, the evolution was complete. Starting from the tender fraternity of the catechumens, from the need to reform the wage-earning system, it led to the political idea of abolishing it. Since the meeting of the Bon-Joyeux, his collectivism, still humanitarian and without formula, had stiffened into a complicated program, each article of which he discussed scientifically. First, he posited that freedom could only be achieved through the destruction of the state. Then, when the people had seized the government, the reforms would begin: return to the primitive commune, substitution of an egalitarian and free family for the moral and oppressive family, absolute equality, civil, political and economic, guarantee of independence individual thanks to the possession and the integral product of the tools of work, finally professional and free instruction, paid for by the community. This involved a total overhaul of the rotten old society; he attacked marriage, the right to test, he regulated the fortune of each, he threw down the iniquitous monument of the dead centuries, with a great gesture of his arm, always the same, the gesture of the reaper who shaves the ripe harvest; and then he rebuilt with his other hand, he built the future humanity, the edifice of truth and justice, growing in the dawn of the twentieth century. At this cerebral tension, reason wavered, there remained only the fixed idea of the sectarian. The scruples of his sensitivity and his common sense were swept away, nothing became easier than the realization of this new world: he had planned everything, he spoke of it as of a machine that he would set up in two hours, and neither the neither fire nor blood cost him.","Then Étienne turned to his favourite subject, the collectivization of the means of production, a barbarous mouthful of a phrase, which he loved to trot out when he could. His own political education was now complete. Having begun with the neophyte’s sentimental taste for solidarity and a belief in the need to reform the wage system, he had come to the view that it should be abolished as a matter of policy. At the time of the meeting in the Jolly Fellow his idea of collectivism had been essentially humanitarian and unsystematic, but it had now evolved into a rigid and complex programme, each article of which he was knowledgeably ready and able to discuss. First, he took it as axiomatic that freedom could not be achieved other than by the destruction of the State. Second, once the people had taken power, the reforms would begin: namely, the return to an earlier form of community life in which a family structure based on oppression and the moral code would be replaced by a family whose members were free and had equal rights; absolute civil, political and economic equality for all; guaranteed independence for the individual, based on the ownership of, and the right to enjoy all the fruits of, the means of production; and finally, free vocational training paid for by the collective. All this required a complete overhaul of a society that was old and rotten to the core; and he duly attacked marriage and the rights of inheritance, talked about regulating the amount of money each person could have, and grandly abolished all manner of entrenched and time-honoured iniquity with a single sweep of his arm, like a reaper scything ripe corn to the ground. Then, with his other hand, he would set about the process of rebuilding, constructing the humanity of the future, the great edifice of truth and justice that would rise with the dawn of the twentieth century. In the course of his mental journey the claims of reason faltered and gave way to sectarian obsession. Any scruples prompted by common sense or normal feelings were swept aside: nothing could be simpler than the realization of this brave new world. He had it all planned, and he talked about it all as if this were simply some machine he could assemble in a matter of hours come what may.","Then Étienne trotted out his favourite subject, the assumption of the instruments of production by the collectivity, as he kept on saying in a phrase the pedantry of which greatly pleased him. At the present time his evolution was completed. Having set out with the sentimental fraternity of the novice and the need for reforming the wage system, he had reached the political idea of its suppression. Since the meeting at the Bon-Joyeux his collectivism, still humanitarian and without a formula, had stiffened into a complicated programme which he discussed scientifically, article by article. First, he affirmed that freedom could only be obtained by the destruction of the State. Then, when the people had obtained possession of the government, reforms would begin: return to the primitive commune, substitution of an equal and free family for the moral and oppressive family; absolute equality, civil, political, and economic; individual independence guaranteed, thanks to the possession of the integral product of the instruments of work; finally, free vocational education, paid for by the collectivity. This led to the total reconstruction of the old rotten society; he attacked marriage, the right of bequest, he regulated every one's fortune, he threw down the iniquitous monument of the dead centuries with a great movement of his arm, always the same movement, the movement of the reaper who is cutting down a ripe harvest. And then with the other hand he reconstructed; he built up the future humanity, the edifice of truth and justice rising in the dawn of the twentieth century. In this state of mental tension reason trembled, and only the sectarian's fixed idea was left. The scruples of sensibility and of good sense were lost; nothing seemed easier than the realization of this new world. He had foreseen everything; he spoke of it as of a machine which he could put together in two hours, and he stuck at neither fire nor blood."
"Étienne avait soufflé la chandelle, dont il ne restait qu’un petit bout. Lui aussi était courbaturé, mais il n’avait pas sommeil, des pensées douloureuses de cauchemar tapaient comme des marteaux dans son crâne. Une seule bientôt demeura, torturante, le fatiguant d’une interrogation à laquelle il ne pouvait répondre : pourquoi n’avait-il pas frappé Chaval, quand il le tenait sous le couteau ? et pourquoi cet enfant venait-il d’égorger un soldat, dont il ignorait même le nom ? Cela bousculait ses croyances révolutionnaires, le courage de tuer, le droit de tuer. Était-ce donc qu’il fût lâche ? Dans le foin, l’enfant s’était mis à ronfler, d’un ronflement d’homme saoul, comme s’il eût cuvé l’ivresse de son meurtre. Et, répugné, irrité, Étienne souffrait de le savoir là, de l’entendre. Tout d’un coup, il tressaillit, le souffle de la peur lui avait passé sur la face. Un frôlement léger, un sanglot lui semblait être sorti des profondeurs de la terre. L’image du petit soldat, couché là-bas avec son fusil, sous les roches, lui glaça le dos et fit dresser ses cheveux. C’était imbécile, toute la mine s’emplissait de voix, il dut rallumer la chandelle, il ne se calma qu’en revoyant le vide des galeries, à cette clarté pâle.","Étienne had snuffed out the candle, of which only a small end remained. He was achy too, but he wasn't sleepy, painful nightmare thoughts hammered like hammers into his skull. Only one soon remained, tormenting him, tiring him with a question he could not answer: why hadn't he struck Chaval, when he held him under the knife? and why had this child just slit the throat of a soldier, whose name he did not even know? It challenged his revolutionary beliefs, the courage to kill, the right to kill. Was it then that he was a coward? In the hay, the child had begun to snore, the snoring of a drunken man, as if he had been sleeping off the intoxication of his murder. And, repelled, irritated, Étienne suffered from knowing it there, from hearing it. Suddenly he started, the breath of fear had passed over his face. A slight rustle, a sob seemed to him to have come from the depths of the earth. The image of the little soldier, lying there with his rifle, under the rocks, froze his back and made his hair stand on end. It was stupid, my whole face was filled with voices, he had to relight the candle, he only calmed down when he saw the emptiness of the galleries again, in this pale light.","Étienne had blown out the candle, of which only a tiny stub remained. He, too, was completely exhausted, but he did not feel sleepy since painful nightmarish thoughts were hammering away inside his head. Soon only one remained, a single tormenting question that nagged away at him but which he could not answer: why had he not stabbed Chaval when he had held him at knifepoint? And why had this child just slit a soldier’s throat without even knowing his name? It all undermined his revolutionary notions about being prepared to kill, about having the right to kill. Did this mean he was a coward? Over in the hay the child had begun to snore, like a drunk, as though he had binged on slaughter. And Étienne felt disgust and irritation at knowing the boy was there and at having to listen to him. Suddenly he gave a shudder, he had just felt the breath of fear on his face. It was as though a faint ripple of air, like a sob, had issued from the depths of the earth. The picture of the young soldier lying there beneath the rocks with his rifle by his side sent shivers down his spine and made his hair stand on end. It was ridiculous, but the whole mine seemed to fill with the sound of voices, and he had to relight the candle ; he only regained his composure once he could see the empty roadways in its pale glow.","Étienne had blown out the candle, of which there was only a small end left.

C’était une suite ininterrompue de mauvaises chances, des réparations énormes et imprévues, des conditions d’exploitation ruineuses, puis le désastre de cette crise industrielle, juste à l’heure où les bénéfices commençaient. Si la grève éclatait chez lui, il était par terre.

If the strike broke out at home, he was down. He pushed open a small door: the buildings of the pit could be guessed, in the dark night, by a doubling of shadow, starred by a few lanterns.","As he took a short cut along the narrow paths of his kitchen-garden, Deneulin was thinking about the danger to his fortune, his Montsou denier, the million francs he had realized and dreamed of increasing tenfold, and which was now in such grave peril.

If the strike went ahead, he would be finished. He pushed open a small gate: in the pitch darkness the colliery buildings could be identified by their even blacker shadows and a sprinkling of lanterns.","While he was taking the shortest cut through the narrow paths of his kitchen garden, Deneulin was thinking of his compromised fortune, this Montsou denier, this million which he had realized, dreaming to multiply it tentold, and which was to-day running such great risks. It was an uninterrupted course of ill-luck, enormous and unforeseen repairs, ruinous conditions of exploitation, then the disaster of this industrial crisis, just when the profits were beginning to come in. If the strike broke out here, he would be overthrown. He pushed a little door: the buildings of the pit could be divined in the black night, by the deepening of the shadow, starred by a few lanterns."
"Dès le lendemain de la journée terrible, cette paix s’était produite, d’un coup, cachant une panique telle, qu’on faisait le plus de silence possible sur les dégâts et les atrocités. L’enquête ouverte établissait que Maigrat était mort de sa chute, et l’affreuse mutilation du cadavre demeurait vague, entourée déjà d’une légende. De son côté, la Compagnie n’avouait pas les dommages soufferts, pas plus que les Grégoire ne se souciaient de compromettre leur fille dans le scandale d’un procès, où elle devrait témoigner. Cependant, quelques arrestations avaient eu lieu, des comparses comme toujours, imbéciles et ahuris, ne sachant rien. Par erreur, Pierron était allé, les menottes aux poignets, jusqu’à Marchiennes, ce dont les camarades riaient encore. Rasseneur, également, avait failli être emmené entre deux gendarmes. On se contentait, à la Direction, de dresser des listes de renvoi, on rendait les livrets en masse : Maheu avait reçu le sien, Levaque aussi, de même que trente-quatre de leurs camarades, au seul coron des Deux-Cent-Quarante. Et toute la sévérité retombait sur Étienne, disparu depuis le soir de la bagarre, et qu’on cherchait, sans pouvoir retrouver sa trace. Chaval, dans sa haine, l’avait dénoncé, en refusant de nommer les autres, supplié par Catherine qui voulait sauver ses parents. Les jours se passaient, on sentait que rien n’était fini, on attendait la fin, la poitrine oppressée d’un malaise.","The day after the terrible day, this peace had occurred, all of a sudden, hiding such panic, that there was as much silence as possible about the damage and the atrocities. The open inquiry established that Maigrat had died of his fall, and the dreadful mutilation of the corpse remained vague, already shrouded in legend. For its part, the Company did not admit the damage suffered, any more than the Grégoires did not care to compromise their daughter in the scandal of a trial, where she would have to testify. However, a few arrests had taken place, stooges as always, dumb and bewildered, knowing nothing. By mistake, Pierron had gone, in handcuffs, to Marchiennes, which the comrades were still laughing at. Rasseneur, too, had almost been led away between two gendarmes. They were content, at the Direction, to draw up lists of dismissals, they returned the booklets en masse: Maheu had received his, Levaque too, as well as thirty-four of their comrades, at the Deux-Cent-Quarante settlement alone. . And all the severity fell on Étienne, who had disappeared since the evening of the fight, and whom they were looking for, without being able to find any trace of him. Chaval, in his hatred, had denounced him, refusing to name the others, begged by Catherine who wanted to save her parents. The days passed, we felt that nothing was over, we waited for the end, the chest oppressed with unease.","This period of calm had set in, all of a sudden, on the morning following those terrible events, and it concealed a sense of panic so great that as little as possible was said about the damage and atrocities which had been committed. The public inquest established that Maigrat had died as the result of his fall, and the circumstances surrounding the dreadful mutilation of his body, already the subject of legend, were left vague. For its part the Company did not publicly acknowledge the damage that had been incurred, no more than the Grégoires were eager to expose their daughter to the scandal of a lawsuit in which she would have had to give evidence. Nevertheless a number of arrests had been made, mere bystanders as usual, witless, gawping folk who had no idea what was going on. Pierron had been taken to Marchiennes in handcuffs by mistake, which was still a source of great amusement to the comrades. Rasseneur, too, had almost been marched off by two gendarmes. Management was content to draw up lists of those to be dismised, and whole batches of people were being handed their cards: Maheu had been given his, and Levaque also, along with thirty-four of their comrades from Village Two Hundred and Forty alone. And the harshest penalties were in store for Étienne, who had vanished without trace since the evening of the riot. Chaval in his hatred had denounced him, though he refused to name the others, having been implored not to by Catherine, who wanted to protect her parents. As the days went by, there was a sense of unfinished business, and people waited tensely to see how things would turn out.","On the morrow of that terrible day this calm had come about at once, hiding such a panic that the greatest silence possible was kept concerning the damage and the atrocities. The inquiry which had been opened showed that Maigrat had died from his fall, and the frightful mutilation of the corpse remained uncertain, already surrounded by a legend. On its side, the Company did not acknowledge the disasters it had suffered, any more than the Grégoires cared to compromise their daughter in the scandal of a trial in which she would have to give evidence. However, some arrests took place, mere supernumeraries as usual, silly and frightened, knowing nothing. By mistake, Pierron was taken off with handcuffs on his wrists as far as Marchiennes, to the great amusement of his mates. Rasseneur, also, was nearly arrested by two gendarmes. The management was content with preparing lists of names and giving back certificates in large numbers. Maheu had received his, Levaque also, as well as thirty-four of their mates in the settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante alone. And all the severity was directed against Étienne, who had disappeared on the evening of the fray, and who was being sought, although no trace of him could be found. Chaval, in his hatred, had denounced him, refusing to name the others at Catherine's appeal, for she wished to save her parents. The days passed, every one felt that nothing was yet concluded; and with oppressed hearts every one was awaiting the end."
"Et le directeur dut renoncer à en savoir davantage, puisque sa femme lui prenait son messager. Il revint s’asseoir devant son bureau, sur lequel s’était amassé un nouveau paquet de dépêches.","And the director had to give up trying to find out more, since his wife was taking his messenger from him. He returned to his seat in front of his desk, on which was piled a new bundle of telegrams.","Since his wife had now stolen his messenger, the manager was obliged to abandon hope of obtaining further information. He returned to his study and sat down at a desk piled high with a fresh batch of telegrams.","And the manager had to renounce further information, since his wife had taken his messenger.

"En haut, au milieu des décombres de Réquillart, Étienne put enfin respirer largement. Puisqu’il n’osait tuer, c’était à lui de mourir ; et cette idée de mort, qui l’avait effleuré déjà, renaissait, s’enfonçait dans sa tête, comme une espérance dernière. Mourir crânement, mourir pour la révolution, cela terminerait tout, réglerait son compte bon ou mauvais, l’empêcherait de penser davantage. Si les camarades attaquaient les Borains, il serait au premier rang, il aurait bien la chance d’attraper un mauvais coup. Ce fut d’un pas raffermi qu’il retourna rôder autour du Voreux. Deux heures sonnaient, un gros bruit de voix sortait de la chambre des porions, où campait le poste qui gardait la fosse. La disparition de la sentinelle venait de bouleverser ce poste, on était allé réveiller le capitaine, on avait fini par croire à une désertion, après un examen attentif des lieux. Et, aux aguets dans l’ombre, Étienne se souvenait de ce capitaine républicain, dont le petit soldat lui avait parlé. Qui sait si on ne le déciderait pas à passer au peuple ? La troupe mettrait la crosse en l’air, cela pouvait être le signal du massacre des bourgeois. Un nouveau rêve l’emporta, il ne songea plus à mourir, il resta des heures, les pieds dans la boue, la bruine du dégel sur les épaules, enfiévré par l’espoir d’une victoire encore possible.","Upstairs, amid the rubble of Réquillart, Étienne was finally able to breathe deeply. Since he dared not kill, it was up to him to die; and this idea of death, which had already touched him, was reborn, buried itself in his head, like a last hope. To die boldly, to die for the revolution, that would end everything, settle his account, good or bad, prevent him from thinking more. If the comrades attacked the Borains, he would be in the front row, he would have a good chance of catching a bad shot. It was with a firm step that he returned to prowl around the Voreux. Two o'clock struck, a loud noise of voices issued from the room of the captains, where the post guarding the pit was camped. The disappearance of the sentry had just upset this post, we had gone to wake the captain, we had ended up believing in a desertion, after a careful examination of the place. And, on the lookout in the shadows, Étienne remembered that Republican captain, of whom the little soldier had spoken to him. Who knows if we would not decide to pass to the people? The troop would put the stick in the air, it could be the signal for the massacre of the bourgeois. A new dream carried him away, he no longer dreamed of dying, he remained for hours, his feet in the mud, the drizzle of the thaw on his shoulders, feverish with the hope of a still possible victory.","Back on the surface, amid the ruins of Réquillart, Étienne could at last breathe freely. Since he hadn’t dared to kill, he would have to die himself, and the prospect of his own death, which had already vaguely occurred to him, now loomed once more and lodged firmly in his mind, like one last hope. If he died a valiant death, if he died for the revolution, that would be the end of it, that would resolve things one way or another, for good or ill, it would mean he didn’t have to think about the matter any further. If the comrades were going to attack the Belgians, he would make sure he was in the front line, and with a bit of luck he might get shot. And so it was with a resolute step that he returned to Le Voreux to see what was going on. Two o’clock struck, and the sound of voices could be heard coming noisily from the deputies’ room, which had been taken over by the military guards. The sentry’s disappearance had caused a considerable stir; they had gone to wake the captain, and in the end, after a careful inspection of the scene, it was decided that the soldier must have deserted. As Étienne listened from the shadows, he remembered the republican captain the young soldier had told him about. Supposing he could be persuaded to come over to the people’s side? The troops would carry their guns reversed, and that could prove to be a general signal for the wholesale slaughter of the bourgeois. A new dream took hold of him. He forgot all about dying and continued to stand there in the mud, for hour after hour; and as the drizzle from the thaw settled on his shoulders, he was filled with the feverish hope that victory might yet be possible.","Up above, in the midst of the ruins of Réquillart, Étienne was at last able to breathe freely. Since he dared not kill, it was for him to die; and this idea of death, which had already touched him, came again and fixed itself in his head, as a last hope. To die bravely, to die for the revolution, that would end everything, would settle his account, good or bad, and prevent him from thinking more. If the men attacked the Borains, he would be in the first rank, and would have a good chance of getting a bad blow. It was with firmer step that he returned to prowl around the Voreux. Two o'clock struck, and the loud noise of voices was coming from the captains' room, where the guards who watched over the pit were posted. The disappearance of the sentinel had overcome the guards with surprise; they had gone to arouse the captain, and after a careful examination of the place, they concluded that it must be a case of desertion. Hiding in the shade, Étienne recollected this republican captain of whom the little soldier had spoken. Who knows if he might not be persuaded to pass over to the people's side! The troop would raise their rifles, and that would be the signal for a massacre of the bourgeois. A new dream took possession of him; he thought no more of dying, but remained for hours with his feet in the mud, and a drizzle from the thaw falling on his shoulders, filled by the feverish hope that victory was still possible."

Puisque le bon Dieu était mort, la justice allait assurer le bonheur des hommes, en faisant régner l’égalité et la fraternité. Une société nouvelle poussait en un jour, ainsi que dans les songes, une ville immense, d’une splendeur de mirage, où chaque citoyen vivait de sa tâche et prenait sa part des joies communes. Le vieux monde pourri était tombé en poudre, une humanité jeune, purgée de ses crimes, ne formait plus qu’un seul peuple de travailleurs, qui avait pour devise : à chacun suivant son mérite, et à chaque mérite suivant ses œuvres.

"C’était au Plan-des-Dames, dans cette vaste clairière qu’une coupe de bois venait d’ouvrir. Elle s’allongeait en une pente douce, ceinte d’une haute futaie, des hêtres superbes, dont les troncs, droits et réguliers, l’entouraient d’une colonnade blanche, verdie de lichens ; et des géants abattus gisaient encore dans l’herbe, tandis que, vers la gauche, un tas de bois débité alignait son cube géométrique.

"Il y eut des poussées, la Maheude se retrouva près de Maheu, et l’un et l’autre, sortis de leur bon sens, emportés dans la lente exaspération dont ils étaient travaillés depuis des mois, approuvèrent Levaque, qui renchérissait en demandant la tête des ingénieurs. Pierron avait disparu. Bonnemort et Mouque causaient à la fois, disaient des choses vagues et violentes, qu’on ne distinguait pas. Par blague, Zacharie réclama la démolition des églises, pendant que Mouquet, sa crosse à la main, en tapait la terre, histoire simplement d’augmenter le bruit. Les femmes s’enrageaient : la Levaque, les poings aux hanches, s’empoignait avec Philomène, qu’elle accusait d’avoir ri ; la Mouquette parlait de démonter les gendarmes à coups de pied quelque part ; la Brûlé, qui venait de gifler Lydie, en la retrouvant sans panier ni salade, continuait d’allonger des claques dans le vide, pour tous les patrons quelle aurait voulu tenir. Un instant, Jeanlin était resté suffoqué, Bébert ayant appris par un galibot que Mme Rasseneur les avait vus voler Pologne ; mais, lorsqu’il eut décidé qu’il retournerait lâcher furtivement la bête, à la porte de L’Avantage, il hurla plus fort, il ouvrit son couteau neuf, dont il brandissait la lame, glorieux de la faire luire.","There were thrusts, Maheude found herself next to Maheu, and both of them, breaking their common sense, carried away by the slow exasperation with which they had been tormented for months, approved Levaque, who went further by asking for the head of engineers.

As a joke, Zacharie demanded the demolition of the churches, while Mouquet, his butt in his hand, pounded the ground, just to increase the noise. The women flew into a rage: La Levaque, fists on hips, grappled with Philomène, whom she accused of having laughed; Mouquette was talking about dismounting the gendarmes with kicks somewhere; la Brûlé, who had just slapped Lydie, on finding her without a basket or a salad, continued to slap in the air, for all the bosses she would have liked to hold. For a moment Jeanlin was suffocated, Bébert having learned from a tram that Madame Rasseneur had seen them rob Poland; but, when he had decided that he would return to stealthily release the animal, at the door of L'Advantage, he howled louder, he opened his new knife, the blade of which he brandished, glorious at making it gleam.","People started shoving and pushing, and La Maheude found herself next to Maheu; and now, after months of growing frustration and having lost all sense of proportion, they both supported Levaque when he went one further than everybody else and called for the death of the engineers. Pierron had disappeared. Bonnemort and Mouque were both talking at once and saying vague and terrible things that no one quite understood. As a joke Zacharie called on them to demolish the churches, while Mouquet, who was still holding his crosse, banged it on the ground just to add to the racket. The women were in a frenzy: La Levaque, hands on hips, was ready for a fight with Philomène, whom she accused of laughing; La Mouquette said she would soon sort the gendarmes out with a good kick up the you-know-where; La Brûlé had just slapped Lydie, having come across her without basket or salad leaves, and was continuing to beat the air in an imaginary assault on all the bosses she would dearly have laid her hands on. Jeanlin had panicked for a moment when Bébert heard from a pit-boy that Mme Rasseneur had seen them take Poland; but once he had decided he would take the rabbit back to the Advantage and quietly release it outside the door, he began to yell louder; and he got out his new knife and brandished the blade, proudly making it gleam.","There was some pushing, and Maheude found herself near Maheu. Both of them, driven out of their ordinary good sense, and carried away by the slow exasperation which had been working within them for months, approved Levaque, who went to extremes by demanding the heads of the engineers. Pierron had disappeared. Bonnemort and Mouque were both talking together, saying vague violent things which nobody heard.

For a moment Jeanlin was in terror, Bébert having learned through a trammer that Madame Rasseneur had seen them steal Poland; but when he had decided to go back and quietly release the beast at the door of the Avantage, he shouted louder than ever, and opened his new knife, brandishing the blade and proud of its glitter."

Puis, derrière, les blagueurs étaient là, Zacharie, Mouquet, d’autres encore, venus pour rire ; tandis que recueillies au contraire, graves ainsi qu’à l’église, des femmes se mettaient en groupe. La Maheude, muette, hochait la tête aux sourds jurons de la Levaque. Philomène toussait, reprise de sa bronchite depuis l’hiver. Seule, la Mouquette riait à belles dents, égayée par la façon dont la Brûlé traitait sa fille, une dénaturée qui la renvoyait pour se gaver de lapin, une vendue, engraissée des lâchetés de son homme.

Then, behind, the jokers were there, Zacharie, Mouquet, others still, come to laugh; while, on the contrary, collected, grave as in church, women gathered in groups. La Maheude, mute, shook her head at La Levaque's muffled oaths. Philomene was coughing, having resumed her bronchitis since the winter.

Behind them were the jokesters, Zacharie, Mouquet and others, who had come for the laugh; whereas many of the women, on the contrary, were standing about in respectful groups and wearing an earnest expression as though they were at church.

Et l’on rentra tous ensemble, on traversa une dernière fois la ducasse, les poêles de friture qui se figeaient, les estaminets d’où les dernières chopes coulaient en ruisseaux, jusqu’au milieu de la route. L’orage menaçait toujours, des rires montèrent, dès qu’on eut quitté les maisons éclairées, pour se perdre dans la campagne noire. Un souffle ardent sortait des blés mûrs, il dut se faire beaucoup d’enfants, cette nuit-là. On arriva débandé au coron. Ni les Levaque ni les Maheu ne soupèrent avec appétit, et ceux-ci dormaient en achevant leur bouilli du matin.","Someone passing by informed Pierron that his daughter Lydie was sleeping at the door, across the sidewalk. She had drunk her share of the stolen bottle, she was drunk, and he had to carry it around his neck, while Jeanlin and Bébert, more solid, followed him from afar, finding it very farcical. This was the signal for departure, families left Bon-Joyeux, the Maheus and the Levaques decided to return to the settlement. At this moment Father Bonnemort and old Mouque were also leaving Montsou, with the same sleepwalking pace, obstinate in the silence of their memories. And we all went back together, we crossed the ducasse one last time, the frying pans which froze, the estaminets from which the last mugs flowed in streams, to the middle of the road. The storm was still threatening, laughter rose as soon as we left the lighted houses to lose ourselves in the dark countryside. An ardent breath came from the ripe wheat, he must have had many children that night. We arrived disbanded at the settlement. Neither the Levaques nor the Maheus ate supper with appetite, and the latter slept while finishing their morning porridge.","Someone alerted Pierron as they passed that his daughter Lydie was asleep at the door and lying across the pavement. Having had her share of the stolen bottle, she was drunk, and he had to sling her over his shoulder and carry her home, while Jeanlin and Bébert, who could take their drink better, followed him at a distance, finding the whole thing very funny. This was the cue that it was time to go home. Families began to leave the Jolly Fellow, and the Maheus and the Levaques eventually decided to return to the village. At the same moment Bonnemort and old Mouque were also leaving Montsou, still walking as though in their sleep and stubbornly absorbed in the silence of their memories. And they all went home together, taking one last walk through the fair, past the frying-pans and their congealing fat, past all the bars where the last beers were streaming out to the tables in the middle of the road. The storm was still brewing, and the sound of laughter rang in the air as they left the lights of Montsou behind and vanished into the blackness of the countryside. From the fields of ripe corn rose warm, urgent breath: many a child must have been fathered that night. They straggled limply into the village. Neither the Levaques nor the Maheus had much of an appetite for their supper, and the latter fell asleep as they tried to finish their leftover beef.","Someone who was passing warned Pierron that his daughter Lydie was sleeping at the door, across the pavement. She had drunk her share of the stolen bottle and was tipsy. He had to carry her away in his arms while Jeanlin and Bébert, who were more sober, followed him behind, thinking it a great joke. This was the signal for departure, and several families came out of the Bon-Joyeux, the Maheus and the Levaques deciding to return to the settlement. At the same moment Father Bonnemort and old Mouque also left Montsou, walking in the same somnambulistic manner, preserving the obstinate silence of their recollections. And they all went back together, passing for the last time through the fair, where the frying-pans were coagulating, and by the estaminets, from which the last glasses were flowing in a stream towards the middle of the road. The storm was still threatening, and sounds of laughter arose as they left the lighted houses to lose themselves in the dark country around. Panting breaths arose from the ripe wheat; many children must have been made on that night. They arrived in confusion at the settlement. Neither the Levaques nor the Maheus supped with appetite, and the latter kept on dropping off to sleep while finishing their morning's boiled beef."
"D’abord, la Maheude refusait d’entendre, prise d’une sourde épouvante. Non, non, c’était trop beau, on ne devait pas s’embarquer dans ces idées, car elles rendaient la vie abominable ensuite, et l’on aurait tout massacré alors, pour être heureux.

"Comme son cousin, il avait eu en héritage un denier des mines de Montsou. Mais lui, ingénieur entreprenant, tourmenté du besoin d’une royale fortune, s’était hâté de vendre, lorsque le dernier avait atteint le million. Depuis des mois, il mûrissait un plan.

Or, il rêvait de réparer Jean-Bart, d’en renouveler la machine et d’élargir le puits afin de pouvoir descendre davantage, en ne gardant Gaston-Marie que pour l’épuisement.

Also he had been letting his daughters have a free rein; the elder one talked of going on the stage, while the younger had already had three landscapes rejected by the Salon Hanging Committee.4 The two girls neverthless remained cheerful in the face of their adversity, and the growing threat of poverty had revealed them to be very astute housekeepers.","Like his cousin he had inherited a denier in the Montsou mines.

"Alors, Étienne se mit à lire l’affiche. C’était un avis de la Compagnie aux mineurs de toutes les fosses. Elle les avertissait que, devant le peu de soin apporté au boisage, lasse d’infliger des amendes inutiles, elle avait pris la résolution d’appliquer un nouveau mode de paiement, pour l’abattage de la houille. Désormais, elle paierait le boisage à part, au mètre cube de bois descendu et employé, en se basant sur la quantité nécessaire à un bon travail. Le prix de la berline de charbon abattu serait naturellement baissé, dans une proportion de cinquante centimes à quarante, suivant d’ailleurs la nature et l’éloignement des tailles. Et un calcul assez obscur tâchait d’établir que cette diminution de dix centimes se trouverait exactement compensée par le prix du boisage. Du reste, la Compagnie ajoutait que, voulant laisser à chacun le temps de se convaincre des avantage présentés par ce nouveau mode, elle comptait seulement l’appliquer à partir du lundi, 1er décembre.","Then Étienne began to read the poster. It was a notice from the Company to the miners of all the pits. She warned them that, in view of the lack of care given to the woodwork, tired of inflicting useless fines, she had taken the resolution to apply a new mode of payment, for the felling of the coal. From now on, she would pay for the woodwork separately, by the cubic meter of wood taken down and used, based on the quantity necessary for a good job. The price of the sedan of coal felled would naturally be lowered, in a proportion of fifty centimes to forty, depending moreover on the nature and the distance of the sizes. And a rather obscure calculation tried to establish that this reduction of ten centimes would be exactly compensated by the price of the woodwork. Moreover, the Company added that, wanting to give everyone time to convince themselves of the advantages offered by this new method, it only intended to apply it from Monday, December 1st.","So Étienne began to read the notice. It was an announcement from the Company addressed to all miners in its pits and informing them that, in view of the continuing negligence in the matter of timbering, and having wearied of imposing fines which had no effect, it had resolved to introduce a new method of payment for the extraction of coal. Henceforth timbering would be paid for separately, by the cubic metre of wood taken below and used, having due regard to the amount appropriate for a satisfactory performance of the task. The price payable per tub of extracted coal would naturally be reduced from fifty to forty centimes, depending on the type and location of the seam. There followed a rather opaque calculation designed to show that this reduction of ten centimes would be exactly offset by the rate payable for timbering. The Company noted in addition that, in its wish to allow each miner sufficient time to be persuaded of the advantages of this new method of payment, it intended to defer its introduction until Monday, 1 December.","Then Étienne began to read him the announcement.

On oublierait vite, la Compagnie avait reçu l’ordre officieux d’étouffer l’affaire et d’en finir avec cette grève, dont la durée irritante tournait au péril social.","Montsou's shots had resounded as far as Paris, in a formidable echo. For four days, all the opposition newspapers had been indignant, spreading atrocious stories on the front pages: twenty-five wounded, fourteen dead, including two children and three women; and there were still the prisoners, Levaque had become a kind of hero, he was credited with an answer to the examining magistrate, of ancient grandeur.

The Empire had received a direct hit from these few bullets, but it was putting on a show of calm omnipotence, oblivious to the gravity of the wound it had sustained. There had simply been an unfortunate encounter, a remote incident somewhere or other in the coal-mining region, very far removed from the streets of Paris where public opinion was formed.

"Ils reconnurent Chaval, qui se trouvait bloqué par l’éboulement, dont les terres comblaient le plan incliné ; et les deux camarades, partis avec lui, étaient même restés en chemin, la tête fendue. Lui, blessé au coude, avait eu le courage de retourner sur les genoux prendre leurs lampes et les fouiller, pour voler leurs tartines. Comme il s’échappait, un dernier effondrement, derrière son dos, avait bouché la galerie.","They recognized Chaval, who was blocked by the landslide, whose earth filled the inclined plane; and the two comrades, who had left with him, had even remained on the way, their heads split open. He, wounded in the elbow, had had the courage to go back on his knees to take their lamps and search them, to steal their slices of bread. As he escaped, a final collapse, behind his back, had blocked the gallery.","They recognized Chaval, who had found himself cut off by the same rock-fall that had filled the incline with rubble; the two comrades who had gone with him had been killed on the way, their skulls smashed open by the rock. Though he had injured his elbow, Chaval had had the courage to crawl back to them to retrieve their lamps and to search them for their sandwiches, to which he helped himself. As he was making his escape, one last collapse behind him had blocked off the roadway.","They recognized Chaval, who had found himself blocked by the landslip which filled the upbrow; his two mates who had set out with him had been left on the way with fractured skulls. He was wounded in the elbow, but had had the courage to go back on his knees, take their lamps, and search them to steal their bread-and-butter. As he escaped, a final downfall behind his back had closed the gallery."
"Mais un nouveau flot arrivait du coron, et Levaque qui marchait en tête, suivi de la Levaque et de Bouteloup, criait :","But a new wave was coming from the settlement, and Levaque, who was leading the way, followed by La Levaque and Bouteloup, shouted:","But a new wave of people was arriving from the village, and Levaque, marching at their head followed by La Levaque and Bouteloup, was shouting:","But a new flood arrived from the settlement, and Levaque, who was at the head followed by his wife and Bouteloup, shouted:"
"Les Grégoire chargeaient Cécile de leurs aumônes. Cela rentrait dans leur idée d’une belle éducation. Il fallait être charitable, ils disaient eux-mêmes que leur maison était la maison du bon Dieu. Du reste, ils se flattaient de faire la charité avec intelligence, travaillés de la continuelle crainte d’être trompés et d’encourager le vice. Ainsi, ils ne donnaient jamais d’argent, jamais pas dix sous, pas deux sous, car c’était un fait connu, dès qu’un pauvre avait deux sous, il les buvait. Leurs aumônes étaient donc toujours en nature, surtout en vêtements chauds, distribués pendant l’hiver aux enfants indigents.","The Grégoires charged Cécile with their alms. It fit into their idea of a good education. You had to be charitable, they said themselves that their house was the house of God. Moreover, they flattered themselves that they did charity with intelligence, tormented by the continual fear of being deceived and of encouraging vice. Thus, they never gave money, never not ten cents, not two cents, because it was a known fact, as soon as a poor man had two cents, he drank them. Their alms were therefore always in kind, especially in warm clothes, distributed during the winter to needy children.","The Grégoires delegated the distribution of alms to Cécile. It was their idea of giving her a good education. One had to be charitable, they said, their house was God’s house. Moreover, they flattered themselves that they were intelligent about their charity, being forever concerned that they should not be duped and encourage evil ways. Hence they never gave money, never! Not so much as ten sous, not even two sous, because, of course, as everyone knew, the moment you gave the poor so much as two sous, they drank them. And so their alms were always given in kind, and particularly in the form of warm clothing, which they distributed to destitute children during the winter.","The Grégoires charged Cécile with their charities.

"Et, debout, cédant à l’emportement de sa souffrance :","And, standing, yielding to the outburst of his suffering:","Now standing, he gave vent to his pain and fury:","And standing up, yielding to the fury of his suffering:"
"Maintenant, durant des heures, Étienne demeurait allongé sur son foin. Des idées vagues le travaillaient, qu’il ne croyait pas avoir. C’était une sensation de supériorité qui le mettait à part des camarades, une exaltation de sa personne, à mesure qu’il s’instruisait. Jamais il n’avait tant réfléchi, il se demandait pourquoi son dégoût, le lendemain de la furieuse course au travers des fosses ; et il n’osait se répondre, des souvenirs le répugnaient, la bassesse des convoitises, la grossièreté des instincts, l’odeur de toute cette misère secouée au vent. Malgré le tourment des ténèbres, il en arrivait à redouter l’heure où il rentrerait au coron. Quelle nausée, ces misérables en tas, vivant au baquet commun ! Pas un avec qui causer politique sérieusement, une existence de bétail, toujours le même air empesté d’oignon où l’on étouffait ! Il voulait leur élargir le ciel, les élever au bien-être et aux bonnes manières de la bourgeoisie, en faisant d’eux les maîtres ; mais comme ce serait long ! et il ne se sentait plus le courage d’attendre la victoire, dans ce bagne de la faim. Lentement, sa vanité d’être leur chef, sa préoccupation constante de penser à leur place le dégageaient, lui soufflaient l’âme d’un de ces bourgeois qu’il exécrait.","Now, for hours, Étienne remained stretched out on his hay. Vague ideas tormented him, which he did not believe he had. It was a feeling of superiority which set him apart from his comrades, an exaltation of his person as he learned. Never had he reflected so much, he wondered why his disgust the day after the furious race through the pits; and he dared not answer himself, memories repelled him, the baseness of covetousness, the coarseness of instincts, the odor of all this misery shaken in the wind. Despite the torment of darkness, he came to dread the hour when he would return to the settlement. What nausea, these wretches in a heap, living in the common tub! Not one with whom to talk politics seriously, an existence of cattle, always the same air stench of onions in which one was suffocating! He wanted to enlarge the sky for them, raise them to the well-being and good manners of the bourgeoisie, by making them masters; but how long that would be! and he no longer felt the courage to wait for victory in this penal colony of hunger. Slowly, his vanity at being their leader, his constant preoccupation with thinking for them freed him, breathed into him the soul of one of those bourgeois whom he hated.","Now Étienne would spend hours lying on his bed of hay, turning over vague ideas which he didn’t even know he had. He felt a sense of superiority that set him apart from the rest of the comrades, as though in the process of educating himself he had acceded to some higher plane. He had never reflected so much before, and he wondered why he had felt such disgust the day after that furious rampage from pit to pit; but he was loath to answer his own question, feeling repugnance as he thought back to certain things, to the base nature of people’s desires, to the crudeness of their instincts, to the reek of all that poverty borne on the wind. Despite the tormenting darkness he eventually began to dread the moment when he would return to the village. How revolting it was, all those wretched people living on top of each other and washing in each other’s dirty water! And not one of them could he talk to seriously about politics. They might as well be animals, and always that same foul air which stank of onions and left you choking for breath! He wanted to broaden their horizons, to show them the way to the life of comfort and good manners led by the bourgeoisie, to make them the masters. But how long it was all going to take! And he no longer felt he had the courage to wait for victory, here in this prison-house of hunger. Gradually his vanity at being their leader and his constant concern to do their thinking for them were slowly setting him apart and lending him the soul of one of those bourgeois he so despised.","Now Étienne remained for hours stretched out on his hay. Vague ideas were working within him for the first time: a feeling of superiority, which placed him apart from his mates, an exaltation of his person as he grew more instructed. Never had he reflected so much; he asked himself the why of his disgust on the morrow of that furious course among the pits; and he did not dare to reply to himself, his recollections were repulsive to him, the ignoble desires, the coarse instincts, the odour of all that wretchedness shaken out to the wind. In spite of the torment of the darkness, he would come to hate the hour for returning to the settlement. How nauseous were all these wretches in a heap, living at the common bucket! There was not one with whom he could seriously talk politics; it was a bestial existence, always the same air tainted by onion, in which one choked! He wished to enlarge their horizon, to raise them to the comfort and good manners of the middle class, by making them masters; but how long it would take! and he no longer felt the courage to await victory, in this prison of hunger. By slow degrees his vanity of leadership, his constant preoccupation of thinking in their place, left him free, breathing into him the soul of one of those bourgeois whom he execrated."
"Le vieux Bonnemort partit ensuite, et Maheu se décida à prendre l’air, après avoir demandé à la Maheude si elle le rejoindrait, là-bas. Non, elle ne pouvait guère, c’était une vraie corvée, avec les petits ; peut-être que oui tout de même, elle réfléchirait, on se retrouverait toujours. Lorsqu’il fut dehors, il hésita, puis il entra chez les voisins, pour voir si Levaque était prêt. Mais il trouva Zacharie qui attendait Philomène ; et la Levaque venait d’entamer l’éternel sujet du mariage, criait qu’on se fichait d’elle, quelle aurait une dernière explication avec la Maheude. Était-ce une existence, de garder les enfants sans père de sa fille, lorsque celle-ci roulait avec son amoureux ? Philomène ayant tranquillement fini de mettre son bonnet, Zacharie l’emmena, en répétant que lui voulait bien, si sa mère voulait. Du reste, Levaque avait déjà filé, Maheu renvoya aussi la voisine à sa femme et se hâta de sortir. Bouteloup, qui achevait un morceau de fromage, les deux coudes sur la table, refusa obstinément l’offre amicale d’une chope. Il restait à la maison, en bon mari.","Old Bonnemort then left, and Maheu decided to take the air, after asking Maheude if she would join him there. No, she couldn't, it was a real chore with the little ones; maybe yes all the same, she would reflect, we would always meet again. When he was outside, he hesitated, then he went to the neighbors to see if Levaque was ready. But he found Zacharie waiting for Philomene; and La Levaque had just broached the eternal subject of marriage, shouting that no one was making fun of her, what would have a final explanation with Maheude. Was it an existence, to keep the fatherless children of his daughter, when this one rode with her lover? Philomène having quietly finished putting on her bonnet, Zacharie led her away, repeating that he was willing, if his mother wished. Besides, Levaque had already slipped away, Maheu also sent the neighbor to his wife and hastened out. Bouteloup, who was finishing a piece of cheese with both elbows on the table, stubbornly refused the friendly offer of a glass. He stayed at home, like a good husband.","Old Bonnemort was the next to leave, and Maheu decided that he, too, would get a breath of air, having first asked La Maheude if she would join him later at the fair. No, how could she, it was such a problem with the little ones; but , well, maybe she would all the same, she’d think about it, they’d always find each other anyway. Once outside he hesitated, then went into his neighbours’ to see if Levaque was ready to go. But instead he found Zacharie waiting for Philomène, and La Levaque, who had just raised the eternal topic of their marriage, shouting her head off about how no one gave a damn about her in all this and how she was going to have the whole thing out, once and for all, with La Maheude. What sort of a life was it, eh, looking after her daughter’s fatherless children while the daughter herself was always off somewhere rolling in the hay with her man? Philomène having calmly put on her bonnet, Zacharie escorted her out of the door, saying that as far he was concerned he had no objection if his mother agreed. In fact Levaque had already made himself scarce, so Maheu sent La Levaque round to see his wife and beat a hasty retreat. Bouteloup, who was sitting with his elbows on the table finishing off a piece of cheese, stubbornly refused Maheu’s friendly offer of a beer. He intended to stay at home, as though he were the devoted husband.","Old Bonnemort set out at last, and Maheu decided to have a little fresh air after asking Maheude if she would come and join him down below. No, she couldn't at all, it was nothing but drudgery with the little ones; but perhaps she would, all the same; she would think about it: they could easily find each other. When he got outside he hesitated, then he went into the neighbours' to see if Levaque was ready. There he found Zacharie, who was waiting for Philoméne. and the Levaque woman started again on that everlasting subject of marriage, saying that she was being made fun of and that she would have an explanation with Maheude once and for all. Was life worth living when one had to keep one's daughter's fatherless children while she went off with her lover? Philoméne quietly finished putting on her bonnet, and Zacharie took her off, saying that he was quite willing if his mother was willing. As Levaque had already gone, Maheu referred his angry neighbour to his wife and hastened to depart. Bouteloup, who was finishing a fragment of cheese with both elbows on the table, obstinately refused the friendly offer of a glass. He would stay in the house like a good husband."
"– Allez-vous-en donc ! répétait la mère, en les chassant à l’autre bout de la salle. Vous devriez rougir d’être toujours dans l’assiette de votre père. Et, s’il était le seul à en avoir, est-ce qu’il ne travaille pas, lui ? tandis que vous autres, tas de vauriens, vous ne savez encore que dépenser. Ah ! oui, et plus que vous n’êtes gros !","– So go away! repeated the mother, chasing them to the other end of the room. You should blush to always be on your father's plate. And if he was the only one to have it, isn't he working? while you rascals still don't know what to spend. Ah! yes, and more than you are fat!","‘Off you go now,’ their mother repeated as she herded them to the other end of the room. ‘You should be ashamed of yourselves, always sticking your nose in your father’s plate like that. And anyway, what if he were the only one who could have some? He’s been out working, hasn’t he, whereas all you good-for-nothing little scamps do is cost money. And cost more than you ought to boot!’","""Get along with you,"" said the mother, driving them to the other end of the room. ""You ought to be ashamed of being always in your father's plate; and even if he was the only one to have any, doesn't he work, while all you, a lot of good-for-nothings, can't do anything but spend! Yes, and the more the bigger you are."""
