"Il était tout naturel d’imaginer qu’après tant de désastres, Candide, marié avec sa maîtresse et vivant avec le philosophe Pangloss, le philosophe Martin, le prudent Cacambo et la vieille, ayant d’ailleurs rapporté tant de diamants de la patrie des anciens Incas, mènerait la vie du monde la plus agréable; mais il fut tant friponné par les Juifs qu’il ne lui resta plus rien que sa petite métairie; sa femme, devenant tous les jours plus laide, devint acariâtre et insupportable; la vieille était infirme et fut encore de plus mauvaise humeur que Cunégonde. Cacambo, qui travaillait au jardin, et qui allait vendre des légumes à Constantinople, était excédé de travail et maudissait sa destinée. Pangloss était au désespoir de ne pas briller dans quelque université d’Allemagne. Pour Martin, il était fermement persuadé qu’on est également mal partout; il prenait les choses en patience. Candide, Martin et Pangloss disputaient quelquefois de métaphysique et de morale. On voyait souvent passer sous les fenêtres de la métairie des bateaux chargés d’effendis, de bachas, de cadis, qu’on envoyait en exil à Lemnos, à Mitylène, à Erzeroum. On voyait venir d’autres cadis, d’autres bachas, d’autres effendis, qui prenaient la place des expulsés et qui étaient expulsés à leur tour. On voyait des têtes proprement empaillées qu’on allait présenter à la Sublime Porte. Ces spectacles faisaient redoubler les dissertations; et quand on ne disputait pas, l’ennui était si excessif que la vieille osa un jour leur dire: « Je voudrais savoir lequel est le pire, ou d’être violée cent fois par des pirates nègres, d’avoir une fesse coupée, de passer par les baguettes chez les Bulgares, d’être fouetté et pendu dans un auto-da-fé, d’être disséqué, de ramer en galère, d’éprouver enfin toutes les misères par lesquelles nous avons tous passé, ou bien de rester ici à ne rien faire? — C’est une grande question, » dit Candide.","It was quite natural to imagine that after so many disasters, Candide, married to his mistress and living with the philosopher Pangloss, the philosopher Martin, the prudent Cacambo and the old woman, having moreover brought back so many diamonds from the homeland of ancient Incas, would lead the most pleasant life in the world; but he was so cheated by the Jews that he had nothing left but his little farm; his wife, growing uglier every day, became cantankerous and insufferable; the old woman was crippled and was in even worse humor than Cunégonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden, and who went to sell vegetables in Constantinople, was worn out with work and cursed his destiny. Pangloss was in despair not to shine in some university in Germany. For Martin, he was firmly convinced that we are equally bad everywhere; he took things patiently. Candide, Martin, and Pangloss sometimes argued over metaphysics and morality. Boats were often seen passing under the windows of the farm laden with effendis, bachas, and cadis, which were sent into exile at Lemnos, at Mitylene, at Erzeroum. We saw other cadis, other bachas, other effendis coming, who took the place of the expelled and who were expelled in turn. We saw properly stuffed heads that were going to be presented to the Sublime Porte. These spectacles made the dissertations redouble; and when we weren't arguing, the boredom was so excessive that the old woman once dared to say to them: ""I would like to know which is the worst, or being raped a hundred times by Negro pirates, having a buttock cut off, to go through the chopsticks among the Bulgarians, to be whipped and hung in an auto-da-fé, to be dissected, to row in the galley, to finally experience all the miseries through which we have all passed, or else to sit here doing nothing? ""That's a great question,"" said Candide.","It was altogether natural to suppose that after undergoing so many disasters, Candide, who was married to his mistress, and living with the philosopher Pangloss, the philosopher Martin, the prudent Cacambo, and the old woman, and who had also brought home so many diamonds from the country of the ancient Incas, would lead the most agreeable life in the world. But he had been so cheated by the Jews32 that he had nothing else left but his little farm; his wife, every day growing more and more ugly, became headstrong and insupportable; the old woman was infirm, and more ill-natured even than Cunégonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden, and carried the produce of it to sell at Constantinople, was worn down by this labour, and cursed his fate. Pangloss was in despair at being unable to make a name for himself in any of the German universities. And as to Martin, he was firmly persuaded that things are equally bad everywhere; he endured with patience. Candide, Martin, and Pangloss disputed sometimes about metaphysics and morality. From the windows of the farm they often saw boats passing by carrying effendis, bashaws, and cadis, cq into exile on Lemnos, Mytilene, and Erzeroum; and other cadis, bashaws, and effendis were seen coming back to take the place of the exiles, and were then exiled in turn. They saw several heads very curiously impaled upon poles, which were going to be presented at the Sublime Porte.cr Such sights gave rise to more discussions: and when they were not arguing, the boredom was so excessive that the old woman ventured one day to tell them, “I would be glad to know which is worse: to be raped a hundred times by negro pirates, to have one buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the Bulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an auto-da-fé, to be dissected, to be chained to an oar in a galley; and, in short, to experience all the miseries through which every one of us has passed, or to remain here doing nothing?” “This,” said Candide, “is a grand question.”","It is quite natural to suppose that after so many misfortunes, Candide, married to his mistress, and living with the philosopher Pangloss, the philosopher Martin, the prudent Cacambo, and the old woman—having, besides, brought back so many diamonds from the land of the ancient Incas—must have led the most agreeable life in the world. But he was so cheated by the jews115 that nothing was left but his little farm; his wife, growing every day more ugly, became sour-tempered and insupportable; the old woman was ailing and even more ill-humored than Cunégonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden and went into Constantinople to sell vegetables, was worn out with toil, and cursed his fate. Pangloss was in despair at being unable to shine in some German university. As for Martin, he was firmly persuaded that things are just as bad wherever you are; he endured in patience. Candide, Martin, and Pangloss sometimes argued over metaphysics and morals. Before the windows of the farmhouse they often watched the passage of boats bearing effendis, pashas, and cadis into exile on Lemnos, Mytilene, and Erzeroum; they saw other cadis, other pashas, other effendis coming, to take the place of the exiles and to be exiled in their turn. They saw various heads, neatly impaled, to be set up at the Sublime Porte.116 These sights gave fresh impetus to their discussions; and when they were not arguing, the boredom was so fierce that one day the old woman ventured to say: —I should like to know which is worse, being raped a hundred times by negro pirates, having a buttock cut off, running the gauntlet in the Bulgar army, being flogged and hanged in an auto-da-fé, being dissected and rowing in the galleys—experiencing, in a word, all the miseries through which we have passed—or else just sitting here and doing nothing? —It’s a hard question, said Candide."
"Aussitôt Candide selle les trois chevaux. Cunégonde, la vieille et lui font trente milles d’une traite. Pendant qu’ils s’éloignaient, la Sainte-Hermandad arrive dans la maison; on enterre monseigneur dans une belle église, et on jette Issacar à la voirie.","Immediately Candide saddles the three horses. Cunégonde, the old woman and he cover thirty miles in one go. As they were walking away, Saint Hermandad comes into the house; Monsignor is buried in a beautiful church, and Issacar is thrown into the garbage dump.","Candide, without any further hesitation, saddles the three horses; and Miss Cunégonde, the old woman and he set out, and travel thirty miles without a stop. While they were making the best of their way, the Holy Brotherhoodz entered the house. My Lord the Inquisitor was buried in a magnificent manner; and Master Issachar’s body was thrown upon a dunghill.","Promptly, Candide saddled the three horses. Cunégonde, the old woman, and he covered thirty miles without a stop. While they were fleeing, the Holy Brotherhood28 came to investigate the house; they buried the inquisitor in a fine church and threw Issachar on the dunghill."
"Le baron ne pouvait se lasser d’embrasser Candide, il l’appelait son frère, son sauveur. « Ah! peut-être, lui dit-il, nous pourrons ensemble, mon cher Candide, entrer en vainqueurs dans la ville, et reprendre ma soeur Cunégonde. — C’est tout ce que je souhaite, dit Candide; car je comptais l’épouser, et je l’espère encore. — Vous, insolent! répondit le baron, vous auriez l’impudence d’épouser ma soeur qui a soixante et douze quartiers! Je vous trouve bien effronté d’oser me parler d’un dessein si téméraire! » Candide, pétrifié d’un tel discours, lui répondit: « Mon Révérend Père, tous les quartiers du monde n’y font rien; j’ai tiré votre soeur des bras d’un Juif et d’un inquisiteur; elle m’a assez d’obligations, elle veut m’épouser. Maître Pangloss m’a toujours dit que les hommes sont égaux, et assurément je l’épouserai. — C’est ce que nous verrons, coquin! » dit le jésuite baron de Thunder-ten-tronckh, et en même temps il lui donna un grand coup du plat de son épée sur le visage. Candide dans l’instant tire la sienne et l’enfonce jusqu’à la garde dans le ventre du baron jésuite; mais, en la retirant toute fumante, il se mit à pleurer: « Hélas! mon Dieu, dit-il, j’ai tué mon ancien maître, mon ami, mon beau-frère; je suis le meilleur homme du monde, et voilà déjà trois hommes que je tue; et dans ces trois il y a deux prêtres. »","The baron could not get tired of kissing Candide, he called him his brother, his saviour. “Oh! perhaps, he said to him, we can together, my dear Candide, enter the city as conquerors, and recapture my sister Cunégonde. ""That's all I want,"" said Candide; for I intended to marry her, and I still hope so. ""You insolent!"" answered the baron, you would have the impudence to marry my sister who has seventy-two quarters! I find you very brazen to dare to speak to me of such a rash design! Candide, petrified by such a speech, answered him: “My Reverend Father, all the quarters of the world are doing nothing about it; I rescued your sister from the arms of a Jew and an inquisitor; she has enough obligations to me, she wants to marry me. Master Pangloss has always told me that men are equal, and I will certainly marry him. ""That's what we'll see, rascal!"" said the Jesuit Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, and at the same time gave him a great blow with the flat of his sword in the face. Candide instantly pulls his own and thrusts it to the hilt into the belly of the Jesuit baron; but, as he took it out smoking, he began to cry: “Alas! my God, he said, I killed my former master, my friend, my brother-in-law; I am the best man in the world, and I have already killed three men; and in these three there are two priests. »","The baron knew no end of embracing Candide; he called him his brother, his deliverer. “Perhaps,” said he, “my dear Candide, we shall be fortunate enough to enter the town sword in hand, and recover my sister Cunégonde.” “Ah! that is all I desire,” replied Candide, “for I intended to marry her; and I hope I shall still be able to.” “Insolent fellow!” replied the baron. “You! you have the impudence to marry my sister, who bears seventy-two quarterings! Really I think you are very presumptuous to dare so much as to mention such an audacious design to me.” Candide, thunderstruck at the oddness of this speech, answered: “Reverend father, all the quarterings in the world are of no significance. I have rescued your sister from a Jew and an Inquisitor; she is under many obligations to me, and she wants to marry me. My master Pangloss always told me that all people are by nature equal. Therefore, I will certainly marry your sister.” “We will see about that, villain!” said the Jesuit baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, and struck him across the face with the flat side of his sword. Candide in an instant drew his rapier, and plunged it up to the hilt in the Jesuit’s body; but in pulling it out, reeking hot, he burst into tears. “Good God,” cried he, “I have killed my old master, my friend, my brother-in-law. I am the best man in the world, and yet I have already killed three men; and of these three two were priests.”","The baron could not weary of embracing Candide; he called him his brother, his savior. —Ah, my dear Candide, said he, maybe together we will be able to enter the town as conquerors, and be united with my sister Cunégonde. —That is all I desire, said Candide; I was expecting to marry her, and I still hope to. —You insolent dog, replied the baron, you would have the effrontery to marry my sister, who has seventy-two quarterings! It’s a piece of presumption for you even to mention such a crazy project in my presence. Candide, terrified by this speech, answered: —Most reverend father, all the quarterings in the world don’t affect this case; I have rescued your sister out of the arms of a jew and an inquisitor; she has many obligations to me, she wants to marry me. Master Pangloss always taught me that men are equal; and I shall certainly marry her. —We’ll see about that, you scoundrel, said the Jesuit baron of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh; and so saying, he gave him a blow across the face with the flat of his sword. Candide immediately drew his own sword and thrust it up to the hilt in the baron’s belly; but as he drew it forth all dripping, he began to weep. —Alas, dear God! said he, I have killed my old master, my friend, my brother-in-law; I am the best man in the world, and here are three men I’ve killed already, and two of the three were priests."
"« Je lui contai tout ce qui m’était arrivé; il me conta aussi ses aventures, et m’apprit comment il avait été envoyé chez le roi de Maroc par une puissance chrétienne, pour conclure avec ce monarque un traité, par lequel on lui fournirait de la poudre, des canons et des vaisseaux, pour l’aider à exterminer le commerce des autres chrétiens. « Ma mission est faite, me dit cet honnête eunuque; je vais m’embarquer à Ceuta, et je vous ramènerai en Italie. Ma che sciagura d’essere senza coglioni!»","“I told him everything that had happened to me; he also related his adventures to me, and told me how he had been sent to the King of Morocco by a Christian power, to conclude a treaty with this monarch, by which they would supply him with gunpowder, cannons and ships, to help him to exterminate the trade of other Christians. “My mission is done,” said this honest eunuch to me; I am going to embark at Ceuta, and I will bring you back to Italy. Ma che sciagura d’essere senza coglioni!”","I then related to him all that had happened to me, and he, in return, acquainted me with all his adventures, and how he had been sent to the court of the King of Morocco by a Christian prince,16 to conclude a treaty with that monarch; the result of which granted him gunpowder, cannon, and ships to enable him to destroy the commerce of other Christian governments. “My mission is concluded,” said the eunuch; “I am going to take ship at Ceuta, and I’ll take you along with me to Italy. ‘Ma che sciagura d’essere senza coglioni!’”","—I told him my adventures, he told me his: that he had been sent by a Christian power to the King of Morocco, to conclude a treaty granting him gunpowder, cannon, and ships with which to liquidate the traders of the other Christian powers. ‘My mission is concluded,’ said this honest eunuch; ‘I shall take ship at Ceuta and bring you back to Italy. Ma che sciagura d’essere senza coglioni!’"
"Cependant le vaisseau français et l’espagnol continuèrent leur route, et Candide continua ses conversations avec Martin. Ils disputèrent quinze jours de suite, et au bout de quinze jours ils étaient aussi avancés que le premier. Mais enfin ils parlaient, ils se communiquaient des idées, ils se consolaient. Candide caressait son mouton. « Puisque je t’ai retrouvé, dit-il, je pourrai bien retrouver Cunégonde. »","However, the French vessel and the Spanish continued their journey, and Candide continued his conversations with Martin. They disputed fifteen days in succession, and at the end of fifteen days they were as advanced as the first. But in the end they talked, they communicated ideas, they consoled each other. Candide stroked his sheep. ""Since I have found you,"" he said, ""I could very well find Cunegonde."" »","The French and Spanish ships continued on their journey, and Candide and Martin continued their conversation. They disputed for fifteen days in a row and at the end of that time they were just as far advanced as the first moment they began. However, they had the satisfaction of talking, of communicating their ideas, and of comforting each other. Candide embraced his sheep: “Since I have found you again,” said he, “I may possibly find my Cunégonde once more.”","Meanwhile the French and Spanish vessels continued on their journey, and Candide continued his talks with Martin. They disputed for fifteen days in a row, and at the end of that time were just as much in agreement as at the beginning. But at least they were talking, they exchanged ideas, they consoled one another. Candide caressed his sheep. —Since I have found you again, said he, I may well rediscover Miss Cunégonde."
"Cacambo, qui faisait sentinelle à la porte de la feuillée, accourut. « Il ne nous reste qu’à vendre cher notre vie, lui dit son maître: on va sans doute entrer dans la feuillée, il faut mourir les armes à la main. » Cacambo, qui en avait vu bien d’autres, ne perdit point la tête; il prit la robe de jésuite que portait le baron, la mit sur le corps de Candide, lui donna le bonnet carré du mort, et le fit monter à cheval. Tout cela se fit en un clin d’oeil. « Galopons, mon maître; tout le monde vous prendra pour un jésuite qui va donner des ordres; et nous aurons passé les frontières avant qu’on puisse courir après nous. » Il volait déjà en prononçant ces paroles, et en criant en espagnol: « Place, place pour le révérend père colonel. »","Cacambo, who was sentry at the door of the lane, hastened up. ""All we have to do is sell our lives dearly,"" his master told him: ""we're probably going to enter the thicket, we have to die, arms in hand. Cacambo, who had seen many others, did not lose his head; he took the Jesuit's robe which the baron wore, put it on Candide's body, gave him the dead man's square cap, and made him mount his horse. It all happened in the blink of an eye. “Let us gallop, my master; everyone will take you for a Jesuit who is going to give orders; and we will have crossed the borders before anyone can chase after us. He was already flying as he uttered these words, and shouted in Spanish: ""Place, place for the Reverend Father Colonel."" »","Cacambo, who was standing sentry near the door of the arbour, instantly ran up. “We can do nothing,” said his master, “but sell our lives as dearly as possible. They will undoubtedly look into the arbour; we must die sword in hand.” Cacambo, who had seen many of these kind of adventures, was not discouraged. He stripped the baron of his Jesuit’s habit and put it upon Candide, then gave him the dead man’s three-cornered cap, and made him mount on horse-back. All this was done in the wink of an eye. “Gallop, master,” cried Cacambo; “everybody will take you for a Jesuit going to give orders, and we will have passed the frontiers before they can overtake us.” He flew as he spoke these words, crying out aloud in Spanish: “Make way! make way for the reverend father-colonel!”","Cacambo, who was standing guard at the entry of the bower, came running. —We can do nothing but sell our lives dearly, said his master; someone will certainly come; we must die fighting. Cacambo, who had been in similar scrapes before, did not lose his head; he took the Jesuit’s cassock, which the commander had been wearing, and put it on Candide; he stuck the dead man’s square hat on Candide’s head, and forced him onto horseback. Everything was done in the wink of an eye. —Let’s ride, master; everyone will take you for a Jesuit on his way to deliver orders; and we will have passed the frontier before anyone can come after us. Even as he was pronouncing these words, he charged off, crying in Spanish: —Way, make way for the reverend father colonel!"
"« Nous avions un iman très pieux et très compatissant, qui leur fit un beau sermon par lequel il leur persuada de ne nous pas tuer tout à fait. « Coupez, dit-il, seulement une fesse à chacune de ces dames, vous ferez très bonne chère; s’il faut y revenir, vous en aurez encore autant dans quelques jours; le ciel vous saura gré d’une action si charitable, et vous serez secourus. »","“We had a very pious and very compassionate imam, who gave them a beautiful sermon in which he persuaded them not to kill us altogether. 'Cut,' he said, 'only a buttock from each of these ladies, you will make very good food; if you have to come back to it, you will have as many more in a few days; Heaven will be grateful to you for such a charitable action, and you will be helped. »","We had a very pious and humane imam,al who delivered an excellent sermon on this occasion, persuading them not to kill us at once; “Only cut off one of the buttocks of each of those ladies,” said he, “and you will fare extremely well; if you still need more you can come back in a few days and have the same. Heaven will approve of so charitable an action, and you will be saved.”","—We had an imam,39 very pious and sympathetic, who delivered an excellent sermon, persuading them not to kill us altogether. ‘Just cut off a single rumpsteak from each of these ladies,’ he said, ‘and you’ll have a fine meal. Then if you should need another, you can come back in a few days and have as much again; heaven will bless your charitable action, and you will be saved.’"
"La vieille prit alors la parole et dit: « Il y a trois chevaux andalous dans l’écurie, avec leurs selles et leurs brides: que le brave Candide les prépare; madame a des moyadors et des diamants: montons vite à cheval, quoique je ne puisse me tenir que sur une fesse, et allons à Cadix; il fait le plus beau temps du monde, et c’est un grand plaisir de voyager pendant la fraîcheur de la nuit. »","The old woman then spoke and said: “There are three Andalusian horses in the stable, with their saddles and their bridles: let the brave Candide prepare them; madame has moyadors and diamonds: let's get on horseback quickly, although I can only stand on one buttock, and go to Cadiz; it is the most beautiful weather in the world, and it is a great pleasure to travel during the cool of the night. »","The old woman then put in her word. “There were three Andalusian horses in the stable,” said she, “with their bridles and saddles. Let the brave Candide get them ready; madame has a parcel of gold coins and jewels. Let’s mount the horses immediately, though I have only one buttock to sit on. Let us set out for Cadiz; it is the finest weather in the world, and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the night.”","The old woman now spoke up and said: —There are three Andalusian steeds27 in the stable, with their saddles and bridles; our brave Candide must get them ready: my lady has some gold coin and diamonds; let’s take to horse at once, though I can only ride on one buttock; we will go to Cadiz. The weather is as fine as can be, and it is pleasant to travel in the cool of the evening."
"Candide embrassa cent fois le baron et Pangloss. « Et comment ne vous ai-je pas tué, mon cher baron? et mon cher Pangloss, comment êtes-vous en vie après avoir été pendu? et pourquoi êtes-vous tous deux aux galères en Turquie? Est-il bien vrai que ma chère soeur soit dans ce pays? disait le baron. — Oui, répondait Cacambo. — Je revois donc mon cher Candide, » s’écriait Pangloss. Candide leur présentait Martin et Cacambo. Ils s’embrassaient tous, ils parlaient tous à la fois. La galère volait, ils étaient déjà dans le port. On fit venir un Juif, à qui Candide vendit pour cinquante mille sequins un diamant de la valeur de cent mille, et qui lui jura par Abraham qu’il n’en pouvait donner davantage. Il paya incontinent la rançon du baron et de Pangloss. Celui-ci se jeta aux pieds de son libérateur et les baigna de larmes; l’autre le remercia par un signe de tête, et lui promit de lui rendre cet argent à la première occasion. « Mais est-il bien possible que ma soeur soit en Turquie? disait-il. — Rien n’est si possible, reprit Cacambo, puis qu’elle écure la vaisselle chez un prince de Transylvanie. » On fit aussitôt venir deux Juifs; Candide vendit encore des diamants; et ils repartirent tous dans une autre galère pour aller délivrer Cunégonde.","Candide kissed the Baron and Pangloss a hundred times. ""And how did I not kill you, my dear Baron?"" and my dear Pangloss, how are you alive after being hanged? and why are you both at the galleys in Turkey? Is it really true that my dear sister is in this country? said the baron. ""Yes,"" replied Cacambo. ""So I see my dear Candide again,"" exclaimed Pangloss. Candide introduced them to Martin and Cacambo. They were all kissing, they were all talking at once. The galley was flying, they were already in port. A Jew was summoned, to whom Candide sold for fifty thousand sequins a diamond worth one hundred thousand, and who swore to him by Abraham that he could give no more. He immediately paid the baron's and Pangloss's ransom. The latter threw himself at the feet of his deliverer and bathed them in tears; the other thanked him with a nod, and promised to return the money at the first opportunity. “But is it really possible that my sister is in Turkey? he said. ""Nothing is so possible,"" resumed Cacambo, then let her scrub the dishes at a prince of Transylvania. Two Jews were immediately summoned; Candide also sold diamonds; and they all left in another galley to free Cunégonde.","Candide embraced the Baron and Pangloss a hundred times. “And so, then, my dear Baron, I did not kill you? And you, my dear Pangloss, how can you be alive after your hanging? And why are you slaves on board a Turkish galley?” “Is it true that my dear sister is in this country?” said the Baron. “Yes,” said Cacambo. “And do I once again see my dear Candide?” said Pangloss. Candide presented Martin and Cacambo to them. They embraced each other, and all spoke together. The galley flew, and already they were back in port. Candide instantly sent for a Jew, and for fifty thousand sequins sold him a diamond worth one hundred thousand, though the buyer swore to him by Father Abraham that he gave him the most he could possibly afford. Candide immediately ransomed the Baron and Pangloss. The latter flung himself at the feet of his deliverer, and bathed him with his tears. The former thanked him with a gracious nod, and promised to return the money at the first opportunity. “But is it possible?” said he, “that my sister is in Turkey?” “Nothing is more possible,” answered Cacambo, “since she is the dishwasher in the house of a Transylvanian prince.” Candide sent for two Jews, and sold more diamonds to them. And then he set out with his companions in another galley, to free Miss Cunégonde from slavery.","A hundred times Candide embraced the baron and Pangloss. —And haw does it happen I didn’t kill you, my dear baron? and my dear Pangloss, how can you be alive after being hanged? and why are you both rowing in the galleys of Turkey? —Is it really true that my dear sister is in this country? asked the baron. —Yes, answered Cacambo. —And do I really see again my dear Candide? cried Pangloss. Candide introduced Martin and Cacambo. They all embraced; they all talked at once. The galley flew, already they were back in port. A jew was called, and Candide sold him for fifty thousand sequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand, while he protested by Abraham that he could not possibly give more for it. Candide immediately ransomed the baron and Pangloss. The latter threw himself at the feet of his liberator, and bathed them with tears ; the former thanked him with a nod, and promised to repay this bit of money at the first opportunity. —But is it really possible that my sister is in Turkey? said he. —Nothing is more possible, replied Cacambo, since she is a dishwasher in the house of a prince of Transylvania. At once two more jews were called; Candide sold some more diamonds; and they all departed in another galley to the rescue of Cunégonde."
"Candide avait amené de Cadix un valet tel qu’on en trouve beaucoup sur les côtes d’Espagne et dans les colonies. C’était un quart d’Espagnol, né d’un métis dans le Tucuman; il avait été enfant de choeur, sacristain, matelot, moine, facteur, soldat, laquais. Il s’appelait Cacambo, et aimait fort son maître parce que son maître était un fort bon homme. Il sella au plus vite les deux chevaux andalous. « Allons, mon maître, suivons le conseil de la vieille; partons, et courons sans regarder derrière nous. » Candide versa des larmes. « O ma chère Cunégonde! faut-il vous abandonner dans le temps que monsieur le gouverneur va faire nos noces! Cunégonde amenée de si loin, que deviendrez-vous? — Elle deviendra ce qu’elle pourra, dit Cacambo; les femmes ne sont jamais embarrassées d’elles; Dieu y pourvoit; courons. — Où me mènes-tu? où allons-nous? que ferons-nous sans Cunégonde? disait Candide. — Par saint Jacques de Compostelle, dit Cacambo, vous alliez faire la guerre aux jésuites; allons la faire pour eux: je sais assez les chemins, je vous mènerai dans leur royaume, ils seront charmés d’avoir un capitaine qui fasse l’exercice à la bulgare; vous ferez une fortune prodigieuse; quand on n’a pas son compte dans un monde, on le trouve dans un autre. C’est un très grand plaisir de voir et de faire des choses nouvelles.","Candide had brought from Cadiz a valet such as one finds many on the coasts of Spain and in the colonies. He was a quarter Spaniard, born of a mestizo in Tucuman; he had been an altar boy, sacristan, sailor, monk, postman, soldier, lackey. His name was Cacambo, and he loved his master very much because his master was a very good man. He quickly saddled the two Andalusian horses. “Come, my master, let us follow the advice of the old woman; let's go, and run without looking behind us. Candide shed tears. “O my dear Cunégonde! must we abandon you while the Governor is about to make our wedding! Cunégonde brought from so far away, what will become of you? ""She will become what she can,"" said Cacambo; women are never embarrassed by them; God provides it; let's run. ""Where are you taking me?"" Where are we going? what will we do without Cunégonde? said Candide. 'By Saint Jacques de Compostela,' said Cacambo, 'you were going to make war on the Jesuits; let's do it for them: I know the roads well enough, I'll take you to their kingdom, they'll be delighted to have a captain who does the Bulgarian drill; you will make a prodigious fortune; when you don't have your account in one world, you find it in another. It is a great pleasure to see and do new things.","Candide had brought with him from Cadiz such a footman as one often meets with on the coast of Spain and in the Colonies. He was one-quarter Spanish, the son of a half-breed and was born in Tucuman.ar He had been a singing boy, sexton, sailor, monk, pedlar, soldier, and lackey. His name was Cacambo. He had a great affection for his master, because his master was a very good man. He immediately saddled the two Andalusian horses. “Come, my good master, let’s follow the old woman’s advice, and hurry to leave this place without a backward glance.” Candide burst into a flood of tears: “Oh, my dear Cunégonde, must I leave you just as the governor was going to marry us? Cunégonde, so long lost and found again, what will now become of you?” “Lord,” said Cacambo, “she must do as well as she can: women are never at a loss. God takes care of them, and so let’s get going.” “But where will you take me? Where can we go? What can we do without Cunégonde?” cried the disconsolate Candide. “By St James of Compostella,” said Cacambo “you were going to fight against the Jesuits of Paraguay; now let’s go and fight for them. I know the road perfectly well; I’ll take you to their kingdom; they will be delighted with a captain that understands the Bulgarian drill; you will certainly make a prodigious fortune. If we cannot find our account in one world, we’ll find it in another. It is a great pleasure to see new objects and perform new exploits.”","Candide had brought from Cadiz a valet of the type one often finds in the provinces of Spain and in the colonies. He was one quarter Spanish, son of a halfbreed in the Tucuman;44 he had been choirboy, sacristan, sailor, monk, merchant, soldier, and lackey. His name was Cacambo, and he was very fond of his master because his master was a very good man. In hot haste he saddled the two Andalusian steeds. —Hurry, master, do as the old woman says; let’s get going and leave this town without a backward look. Candide wept: — O my beloved Cunégonde! must I leave you now, just when the governor is about to marry us! Cunégonde, brought from so far, what will ever become of you? —She’ll become what she can, said Cacambo; women can always find something to do with themselves; God sees to it; let’s get going. —Where are you taking me? where are we going? what will we do without Cunégonde? said Candide. —By Saint James of Compostela, said Cacambo, you were going to make war against the Jesuits, now we’ll go make war for them. I know the roads pretty well, I’ll bring you to their country, they will be delighted to have a captain who knows the Bulgar drill; you’ll make a prodigious fortune. If you don’t get your rights in one world, you will find them in another. And isn’t it pleasant to see new things and do new things?"
"« Vous avez donc, monsieur, lui dit-il, un rendez-vous à Venise? — Oui, monsieur l’abbé, dit Candide; il faut absolument que j’aille trouver Mlle Cunégonde. » Alors, engagé par le plaisir de parler de ce qu’il aimait, il conta, selon son usage, une partie de ses aventures avec cette illustre Vestphalienne.","""So you have, sir,"" he said to him, ""an appointment in Venice?"" ""Yes, Monsieur l'abbé,"" said Candide; I absolutely must go and see Miss Cunégonde. Then, engaged by the pleasure of talking about what he loved, he related, according to his custom, part of his adventures with this illustrious Westphalian.","“And so, sir, you have an engagement at Venice?” “Yes, Monsieur l’Abbé,” answered Candide, “I must absolutely wait for Miss Cunégonde;” and then, carried away by the pleasure he took in talking about the object of his love, he recounted, as he often did, part of his adventures with that illustrious Westphalian beauty.","—Well, sir, said he, so you have an assignation at Venice? —Yes indeed, sir, I do, said Candide; it is absolutely imperative that I go there to find Miss Cunégonde. And then, carried away by the pleasure of talking about his love, he recounted, as he often did, a part of his adventures with that illustrious lady of Westphalia."
"Le vieillard rougit un peu. « Comment donc, dit-il, en pouvez-vous douter? Est-ce que vous nous prenez pour des ingrats? » Cacambo demanda humblement quelle était la religion d’Eldorado. Le vieillard rougit encore. « Est-ce qu’il peut y avoir deux religions? dit-il; nous avons, je crois, la religion de tout le monde: nous adorons Dieu du soir jusqu’au matin. — N’adorez-vous qu’un seul Dieu? dit Cacambo, qui servait toujours d’interprète aux doutes de Candide. — Apparemment, dit le vieillard, qu’il n’y en a ni deux, ni trois, ni quatre. Je vous avoue que les gens de votre monde font des questions bien singulières. » Candide ne se lassait pas de faire interroger ce bon vieillard; il voulut savoir comment on priait Dieu dans l’Eldorado. « Nous ne le prions point, dit le bon et respectable sage; nous n’avons rien à lui demander; il nous a donné tout ce qu’il nous faut; nous le remercions sans cesse. » Candide eut la curiosité de voir des prêtres; il fit demander où ils étaient. Le bon vieillard sourit. « Mes amis, dit-il, nous sommes tous prêtres; le roi et tous les chefs de famille chantent des cantiques d’actions de grâces solennellement tous les matins; et cinq ou six mille musiciens les accompagnent. — Quoi! vous n’avez point de moines qui enseignent, qui disputent, qui gouvernent, qui cabalent, et qui font brûler les gens qui ne sont pas de leur avis? — Il faudrait que nous fussions fous, dit le vieillard; nous sommes tous ici du même avis, et nous n’entendons pas ce que vous voulez dire avec vos moines. » Candide à tous ces discours demeurait en extase, et disait en lui-même: « Ceci est bien différent de la Vestphalie et du château de monsieur le baron: si notre ami Pangloss avait vu Eldorado, il n’aurait plus dit que le château de Thunder-ten-tronckh était ce qu’il y avait de mieux sur la terre; il est certain qu’il faut voyager. »","The old man blushed a little. ""How then,"" said he, ""can you doubt it?"" Do you take us for ingrates? Cacambo humbly asked what the religion of Eldorado was. The old man blushed again. “Can there be two religions? he said; we have, I believe, the religion of everyone: we adore God from evening until morning. ""Do you worship only one God?"" said Cacambo, who always served as an interpreter of Candide's doubts. ""Apparently,"" said the old man, ""there are neither two, nor three, nor four."" I confess to you that the people of your world ask very strange questions. Candide never tired of having this good old man questioned; he wanted to know how they prayed to God in Eldorado. “We do not pray to him,” said the good and respectable sage; we have nothing to ask him; he has given us everything we need; we thank him unceasingly. Candide was curious to see priests; he asked where they were. The good old man smiled. “My friends,” he said, “we are all priests; the king and all the heads of families sing hymns of thanksgiving solemnly every morning; and five or six thousand musicians accompany them. - What! you have no monks who teach, who dispute, who govern, who cabal, and who burn people who are not of their opinion? ""We must be mad,"" said the old man; we are all of the same opinion here, and we do not hear what you mean with your monks. Candide at all these speeches remained in ecstasy, and said to himself: ""This is very different from Vestphalia and from Monsieur le Baron's castle: if our friend Pangloss had seen Eldorado, he would have said only the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh was the best on earth; it is certain that it is necessary to travel. »","The old man reddened a little at this question. “Can you doubt it?” he said. “Do you take us for wretches who have no sense of gratitude?” Cacambo asked in a respectful manner about the established religion of El Dorado. The old man blushed again, and said: “Can there be two religions then? Ours, I suppose, is the religion of the whole world. We worship God from morning till night.” “Do you worship only one God?” said Cacambo, who still acted as interpreter of Candide’s doubts. “Certainly,” said the old man; “there are not two nor three nor four Gods. I must confess the people of your world ask very extraordinary questions.” However, Candide could not refrain from making many more inquiries of the old man. He wanted to know how they prayed to God in El Dorado. “We do not pray to him at all,” said the reverend sage. “We have nothing to ask of him. He has given us all we want, and we give him thanks continually.” Candide was interested in seeing some of their priests and had Cacambo ask the old man where they were; at which he, smiling, said: “My friends, we are all priests. The king and all the heads of families sing solemn hymns of thanksgiving every morning, accompanied by five or six thousand musicians.” “What!” says Cacambo, “you have no monks among you to dispute, to govern, to intrigue, and to burn people who are not of the same opinion as themselves?” “Do you take us for fools?” said the old man; “here we are all of one opinion, and don’t know what you’re up to with your monks.” During this whole discourse Candide was overjoyed, and he said to himself: ” What a massive difference there is between this place and Westphalia, and this house and the baron’s castle! Ah, Master Pangloss! if you could have seen El Dorado you would no longer have maintained that the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh was the finest of all possible edifices. There is nothing like seeing the world, that’s certain.”","The old man grew a bit red. —How’s that? he said. Can you have any doubt of it? Do you suppose we are altogether thankless scoundrels? Cacambo asked meekly what was the religion of Eldorado. The old man flushed again. —Can there be two religions? he asked. I suppose our religion is the same as everyone’s, we worship God from morning to evening. —Then you worship a single deity? said Cacambo, who acted throughout as interpreter of the questions of Candide. —It’s obvious, said the old man, that there aren’t two or three or four of them. I must say the people of your world ask very remarkable questions. Candide could not weary of putting questions to this good old man; he wanted to know how the people of Eldorado prayed to God. —We don’t pray to him at all, said the good and respectable sage; we have nothing to ask him for, since everything we need has already been granted; we thank God continually. Candide was interested in seeing the priests; he had Cacambo ask where they were. The old gentleman smiled. —My friends, said he, we are all priests; the king and all the heads of household sing formal psalms of thanksgiving every morning, and five or six thousand voices accompany them. —What! you have no monks to teach, argue, govern, intrigue, and burn at the stake everyone who disagrees with them? —We should have to be mad, said the old man; here we are all of the same mind, and we don’t understand what you’re up to with your monks. Candide was overjoyed at all these speeches, and said to himself: — This is very different from Westphalia and the castle of My Lord the Baron; if our friend Pangloss had seen Eldorado, he wouldn’t have called the castle of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh the finest thing on earth; to know the world one must travel."
Cependant tous les voyageurs que Candide rencontra dans les cabarets de la route lui disaient: « Nous allons à Paris. » Cet empressement général lui donna enfin l’envie de voir cette capitale; ce n’était pas beaucoup se détourner du chemin de Venise.,"However, all the travelers whom Candide met in the cabarets along the way said to him: ""We are going to Paris."" This general eagerness finally gave him the desire to see this capital; it was not much to turn aside from the road to Venice.","In the meantime, all the travellers whom Candide met with in the inns or on the road told him that they were going to Paris. This general eagerness gave him likewise a great desire to see this capital, and it was not much out of his way to Venice.",But all the travelers with whom Candide talked in the roadside inns told him:—We are going to Paris. This general consensus finally inspired in him too a desire to see the capital; it was not much out of his road to Venice.
"Martin se tournant vers Candide avec son sang-froid ordinaire: « Eh bien! lui dit-il, n’ai-je pas gagné la gageure tout entière? » Candide donna deux mille piastres à Paquette et mille piastres à frère Giroflée. « Je vous réponds, dit-il, qu’avec cela ils seront heureux. — Je n’en crois rien du tout, dit Martin; vous les rendrez peut-être avec ces piastres beaucoup plus malheureux encore. — Il en sera ce qui pourra, dit Candide; mais une chose me console, je vois qu’on retrouve souvent les gens qu’on ne croyait jamais retrouver; il se pourra bien faire qu’ayant rencontré mon mouton rouge et Paquette, je rencontre aussi Cunégonde. — Je souhaite, dit Martin, qu’elle fasse un jour votre bonheur; mais c’est de quoi je doute fort. — Vous êtes bien dur, dit Candide. — C’est que j’ai vécu, dit Martin.","Martin turning to Candide with his usual coolness: “Well! he said to her, have I not won the whole wager? Candide gave two thousand piastres to Paquette and a thousand piastres to Brother Giroflée. “I answer you,” he said, “that with that they will be happy. ""I don't believe it at all,"" said Martin; you will perhaps make them even more unhappy with these piastres. ""It will be what may be,"" said Candide; but one thing consoles me, I see that we often find people we never thought we would find again; it may well be that having met my red sheep and Paquette, I also meet Cunégonde. “I hope,” said Martin, “that she will one day make you happy; but that's what I doubt very much. ""You are very tough,"" said Candide. ""That's what I lived,"" said Martin.","Martin, turning towards Candide with his usual coolness, said, “Well, what think you now? Have I won the wager entirely?” Candide gave two thousand piastres to Pacquette and a thousand to Friar Giroflée, saying, “I will answer that this will make them happy.” “I don’t believe so,” said Martin; “perhaps this money will only make them wretched.” “Be that as it may,” said Candide, “one thing comforts me; I see that one often meets with those whom we never expected to see again; so that perhaps, as I have found my red sheep and Pacquette, I may be lucky enough to find Miss Cunégonde also.” “I hope,” said Martin, “that one day she will make you happy, but I doubt it very much.” “You are very hard in your beliefs,” said Candide. “It is because,” said Martin, “I have seen the world.”","Martin turned to Candide and said with his customary coolness: —Well, haven’t I won the whole bet? Candide gave two thousand piastres to Paquette and a thousand to Brother Giroflée. —I assure you, said he, that with that they will be happy. —I don’t believe so , said Martin; your piastres may make them even more unhappy than they were before. —That may be, said Candide; but one thing comforts me , I note that people often turn up whom one never expected to see again; it may well be that, having rediscovered my red sheep and Paquette, I will also rediscover Cunégonde. —I hope, said Martin, that she will some day make you happy; but I very much doubt it. —You’re a hard man, said Candide. —I’ve lived, said Martin."
"Candide, partagé entre la joie et la douleur, charmé d’avoir revu son agent fidèle, étonné de le voir esclave, plein de l’idée de retrouver sa maîtresse, le coeur agité, l’esprit bouleversé, se mit à table avec Martin, qui voyait de sang-froid toutes ces aventures, et avec six étrangers qui étaient venus passer le carnaval à Venise.","Candide, torn between joy and pain, charmed to have seen his faithful agent again, surprised to see him a slave, full of the idea of finding his mistress, his heart agitated, his mind upset, sat down to table with Martin , who witnessed all these adventures in cold blood, and with six strangers who had come to spend the carnival in Venice.","Candide, divided between joy and grief, charmed to have thus met his faithful agent again, and surprised to hear he was a slave, his heart palpitating, his senses confused, but full of the hopes of recovering his dear Cunégonde, sat down to eat with Martin, who watched all these scenes cooly, and with six strangers, who had come to spend the Carnival at Venice.","Candide, torn between joy and grief, delighted to have seen his faithful agent again, astonished to find him a slave, full of the idea of recovering his mistress, his heart in a turmoil, his mind in a whirl, sat down to eat with Martin, who was watching all these events coolly, and with six strangers who had come to pass the carnival season at Venice."
"Le sergent alla sur-le-champ rendre compte de ce discours au commandant. « Dieu soit béni! dit ce seigneur; puisqu’il est allemand, je peux lui parler; qu’on le mène dans ma feuillée. » Aussitôt on conduit Candide dans un cabinet de verdure orné d’une très jolie colonnade de marbre vert et or, et de treillages qui renfermaient des perroquets, des colibris, des oiseaux-mouches, des pintades, et tous les oiseaux les plus rares. Un excellent déjeuner était préparé dans des vases d’or; et tandis que les Paraguains mangèrent du maïs dans des écuelles de bois, en plein champ, à l’ardeur du soleil, le révérend père commandant entra dans la feuillée.","The sergeant immediately went to report this speech to the commandant. “God be blessed! said this lord; since he is German, I can talk to him; let him be led into my lane. Immediately Candide was led into a green room adorned with a very pretty colonnade of green and gold marble, and trellises which contained parrots, hummingbirds, hummingbirds, guinea fowl, and all the rarest birds. An excellent breakfast was prepared in golden vessels; and while the Paraguayans ate corn from wooden bowls, in the open field, in the heat of the sun, the reverend father commander entered the field.","The sergeant immediately went off to report this speech to the commandant. “God be praised,” said the reverend commandant; “since he is a German I will hear what he has to say; bring him to my arbour.” They immediately led Candide to a beautiful pavilion adorned with a colonnade of green marble spotted with yellow, and with an inter-texture of vines, which served as a kind of cage for parrots, humming-birds, fly-birds, Guinea hens, and all other curious kinds of birds. An excellent breakfast was provided in vessels of gold, and while the Paraguayans were eating coarse Indian corn out of wooden dishes in the open air, and exposed to the burning heat of the sun, the reverend father commandant retired to his cool arbour.","The sergeant promptly went off to report this speech to the commander. —God be praised, said this worthy; since he is German, I can talk to him; bring him into my bower. Candide was immediately led into a leafy nook surrounded by a handsome colonnade of green and gold marble and trellises amid which sported parrots, birds of paradise,47 humming birds, guinea fowl, and all the rarest species of birds. An excellent breakfast was prepared in golden vessels; and while the Paraguayans ate corn out of wooden bowls in the open fields under the glare of the sun, the reverend father commander entered into his bower."
"Dans l’instant qu’on sortait de table, il arriva dans la même hôtellerie quatre altesses sérénissimes qui avaient aussi perdu leurs États par le sort de la guerre, et qui venaient passer le reste du carnaval à Venise. Mais Candide ne prit pas seulement garde à ces nouveaux venus. Il n’était occupé que d’aller trouver sa chère Cunégonde à Constantinople.","Just as they were leaving the table, four serene highnesses arrived at the same hotel, who had also lost their States by the fate of the war, and who had come to spend the rest of the carnival in Venice. But Candide did not only take heed of these newcomers. He was only occupied in going to find his dear Cunégonde in Constantinople.","Just as they rose from the table, in came four serene highnesses, who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortunes of war, and who had come to spend the remainder of the Carnival at Venice. Candide took no manner of notice of them; he was concerned only with his voyage to Constantinople, where he intended to go in search of his lovely Miss Cunégonde.","Just as they were rising from dinner, there arrived at the same establishment four most serene highnesses, who had also lost their kingdoms through the luck of war, and who came to spend the rest of the carnival season at Venice. But Candide never bothered even to look at these newcomers because he was only concerned to go find his dear Cunégonde at Constantinople."
"Elle reprit ainsi le fil de son histoire: « Un capitaine bulgare entra, il me vit toute sanglante, et le soldat ne se dérangeait pas. Le capitaine se mit en colère du peu de respect que lui témoignait ce brutal, et le tua sur mon corps. Ensuite il me fit panser, et m’emmena prisonnière de guerre dans son quartier. Je blanchissais le peu de chemises qu’il avait, je faisais sa cuisine; il me trouvait fort jolie, il faut l’avouer; et je ne nierai pas qu’il ne fût très bien fait, et qu’il n’eût la peau blanche et douce; d’ailleurs peu d’esprit, peu de philosophie: on voyait bien qu’il n’avait pas été élevé par le docteur Pangloss. Au bout de trois mois, ayant perdu tout son argent et s’étant dégoûté de moi, il me vendit à un Juif nommé don Issacar, qui trafiquait en Hollande et en Portugal, et qui aimait passionnément les femmes. Ce Juif s’attacha beaucoup à ma personne, mais il ne pouvait en triompher; je lui ai mieux résisté qu’au soldat bulgare. Une personne d’honneur peut être violée une fois, mais sa vertu s’en affermit. Le Juif, pour m’apprivoiser, me mena dans cette maison de campagne que vous voyez. J’avais cru jusque-là qu’il n’y avait rien sur la terre de si beau que le château de Thunder-ten-tronckh; j’ai été détrompée.","She thus resumed the thread of her story: “A Bulgarian captain entered, he saw me all bleeding, and the soldier did not disturb himself. The captain got angry at the lack of respect shown to him by this brute, and killed him on my body. Then he had me bandaged, and took me as a prisoner of war to his quarters. I laundered the few shirts he had, I did his cooking; he found me very pretty, it must be confessed; and I will not deny that he was very well made, and that his skin was white and soft; besides, little wit, little philosophy: it was clear that he had not been brought up by Doctor Pangloss. At the end of three months, having lost all his money and being disgusted with me, he sold me to a Jew named Don Issacar, who traded in Holland and Portugal, and who loved women passionately. This Jew attached himself very much to my person, but he could not triumph over it; I resisted him better than the Bulgarian soldier. A person of honor may be violated once, but his virtue is strengthened. The Jew, to tame me, took me to that country house you see. I had believed until then that there was nothing on earth so beautiful as the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh; I was deceived.","She continued: “A Bulgarian captain came in, and saw me covered in my blood, and the soldier still as busy as if no one had been present. The officer, enraged at the fellow’s lack of respect to him, killed him with one stroke of his sabre. This captain took care of me, had me cured, and carried me as a prisoner of war to his quarters. I washed what little linen he owned and prepared his food. He was very fond of me, that was certain; neither can I deny that he was handsome, and had a white soft skin; but he was very stupid, and knew nothing of philosophy. It was evident that he had not been educated under Dr. Pangloss. After three months, having lost all his money, and being tired of me, he sold me to a Jew named Don Issachar, who traded in Holland and Portugal, and was passionately fond of women. This Jew showed me great kindness, in hopes to gain my favours; but this got him nowhere with me. A modest woman may be once violated, but her virtue is greatly strengthened as a result. In order to keep me hidden, he brought me to this country house you now see. I have hitherto believed that nothing could equal the beauty of the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh, but I found I was mistaken.","So she look up the thread of her tale: —A Bulgar captain appeared, he saw me covered with blood and the soldier too intent to get up. Shocked by the monster’s failure to come to attention, the captain killed him on my body. He then had my wound dressed, and took me off to his quarters, as a prisoner of war. I laundered his few shirts and did his cooking; he found me attractive, I confess it, and I won’t deny that he was a handsome fellow, with a smooth, white skin ; apart from that, however, little wit, little philosophical training; it was evident that he had not been brought up by Doctor Pangloss. After three months, he had lost all his money and grown sick of me; so he sold me to a jew named Don Issachar, who traded in Holland and Portugal, and who was mad after women. This jew developed a mighty passion for my person, but he got nowhere with it; I held him off better than I had done with the Bulgar soldier; for though a person of honor may be raped once, her virtue is only strengthened by the experience. In order to keep me hidden, the jew brought me to his country house, which you see here. Till then I had thought there was nothing on earth so beautiful as the castle of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh; I was now undeceived."

"Il y avait dans la chiourme deux forçats qui ramaient fort mal, et à qui le levanti patron appliquait de temps en temps quelques coups de nerf de boeuf sur leurs épaules nues; Candide, par un mouvement naturel, les regarda plus attentivement que les autres galériens et s’approcha d’eux avec pitié. Quelques traits de leurs visages défigurés lui parurent avoir un peu de ressemblance avec Pangloss et avec ce malheureux jésuite, ce baron, ce frère de Mlle Cunégonde. Cette idée l’émut et l’attrista. Il les considéra encore plus attentivement. « En vérité, dit-il à Cacambo, si je n’avais pas vu pendre maître Pangloss, et si je n’avais pas eu le malheur de tuer le baron, je croirais que ce sont eux qui rament dans cette galère. »","There were two convicts in the crew who rowed very badly, and to whom the levanti boss applied a few blows of blackjack to their bare shoulders from time to time; Candide, by a natural movement, looked at them more attentively than the other galley slaves and approached them with pity. Some features of their disfigured faces seemed to him to bear a little resemblance to Pangloss and to that unfortunate Jesuit, that baron, that brother of Mademoiselle Cunégonde. This idea moved and saddened him. He considered them even more carefully. “In truth,” he said to Cacambo, “if I had not seen Master Pangloss hanged, and if I had not had the misfortune to kill the baron, I would believe that it is they who are rowing in this galley. »","There were two slaves among the crew of the galley, who rowed very poorly, and to whose bare backs the master of the vessel frequently applied a few lashes with a bullwhip. Candide naturally looked at these two slaves more attentively than at any of the rest, and out of pity moved closer to them. Certain features of their disfigured faces appeared to him to bear a resemblance to those of Pangloss and the unhappy Baron Jesuit, Miss Cunégonde’s brother. This notion moved and saddened him. He examined them more attentively than before. “In truth,” said he to Cacambo, “if I had not seen my master Pangloss hanged, and had not myself been unlucky enough to kill the Baron, I should absolutely think that those two rowers were the men.”","There were in the chain gang two convicts who bent clumsily to the oar, and on whose bare shoulders the Levantine109 captain delivered from time to time a few lashes with a bullwhip. Candide naturally noticed them more than the other galley slaves, and out of pity came closer to them. Certain features of their disfigured faces seemed to him to bear a slight resemblance to Pangloss and to that wretched Jesuit, that baron, that brother of Miss Cunégonde. The notion stirred and saddened him. He looked at them more closely. —To tell you the truth, he said to Cacambo, if I hadn’t seen Master Pangloss hanged, and if I hadn’t been so miserable as to murder the baron. I should think they were rowing in this very galley."
"Le patron fut prêt au bout de deux jours. On côtoya la France; on passa à la vue de Lisbonne, et Candide frémit. On entra dans le détroit et dans la Méditerranée; enfin on aborda à Venise. « Dieu soit loué! dit Candide en embrassant Martin; c’est ici que je reverrai la belle Cunégonde. Je compte sur Cacambo comme sur moi-même. Tout est bien, tout va bien, tout va le mieux qu’il soit possible. »","The pattern was ready after two days. We skirted France; they passed the view of Lisbon, and Candide shuddered. They entered the strait and the Mediterranean; at last we landed at Venice. “God be praised! said Candide, embracing Martin; it is here that I will see the beautiful Cunégonde again. I count on Cacambo as on myself. All is well, all is well, all is well. »","The skipper was ready in two days. They sailed along the coast of France, and passed within sight of Lisbon, at which Candide trembled. From there they proceeded to the straits, entered the Mediterranean, and at length they arrived at Venice. “God be praised,” said Candide, embracing Martin, “this is the place where I am to see my beloved Cunégonde once again. I trust Cacambo as I do myself. All is well—all very well; all as well as possible.”","The merchant was ready in two days; they coasted along France, they passed within sight of Lisbon, and Candide quivered. They entered the straits, crossed the Mediterranean, and finally landed at Venice. —God be praised, said Candide, embracing Martin; here I shall recover the lovely Cunégonde. I trust Cacambo as I would myself. All is well, all goes well, all goes as well as possible."
"« Oh! voici un Cicéron, dit Candide; pour ce grand homme-là, je pense que vous ne vous lassez point de le lire? — Je ne le lis jamais, répondit le Vénitien. Que m’importe qu’il ait plaidé pour Rabirius ou pour Cluentius? J’ai bien assez des procès que je juge; je me serais mieux accommodé de ses oeuvres philosophiques; mais, quand j’ai vu qu’il doutait de tout, j’ai conclu que j’en savais autant que lui, et que je n’avais besoin de personne pour être ignorant.",""" Oh! here is a Cicero, says Candide; for that great man, I don't think you tire of reading him? ""I never read it,"" replied the Venetian. What does it matter to me whether he pleaded for Rabirius or for Cluentius? I have enough cases that I judge; I would have accommodated myself better to his philosophical works; but, when I saw that he doubted everything, I concluded that I knew as much as he did, and that I did not need anyone to be ignorant.","“Oh, here is a copy of Cicero!by” said Candide; “this great man, I assume, you are never tired of reading.” “Indeed, I never read him at all,” replied Pococuranté. “What do I care whether he pleads for Rabirius or Cluentius? As a judge, I have enough trials. I might like his philosophical works better; but when I realized that he had doubts about everything, I figured I knew as much as himself, and had no need of a guide to learn ignorance.” “Ha!”","—Oh, here is a copy of Cicero,98 said Candide. Now this great man I suppose you’re never tired of reading. —I never read him at all, replied the Venetian. What do I care whether he pleaded for Rabirius or Cluentius?

I might like his philosophical works better, but when I saw that he had doubts about everything, I concluded that I knew as much as he did, and that I needed no help to be ignorant."
"La séance dura jusqu’à quatre heures du matin. Candide, en écoutant toutes leurs aventures, se ressouvenait de ce que lui avait dit la vieille en allant à Buenos-Ayres, et de la gageure qu’elle avait faite, qu’il n’y avait personne sur le vaisseau à qui il ne fût arrivé de très grands malheurs. Il songeait à Pangloss à chaque aventure qu’on lui contait. « Ce Pangloss, disait-il, serait bien embarrassé à démontrer son système. Je voudrais qu’il fût ici. Certainement, si tout va bien, c’est dans Eldorado, et non pas dans le reste de la terre. » Enfin il se détermina en faveur d’un pauvre savant qui avait travaillé dix ans pour les libraires d’Amsterdam. Il jugea qu’il n’y avait point de métier au monde dont on dût être plus dégoûté.","The meeting lasted until four o'clock in the morning. Candide, listening to all their adventures, remembered what the old woman had said to him on his way to Buenos-Ayres, and the bet she had made that there was no one on the ship whom he could not great misfortunes had happened. He thought of Pangloss in every adventure told to him. ""This Pangloss,"" he said, ""would be very embarrassed to demonstrate his system."" I wish he were here. Certainly, if all goes well, it is in Eldorado, and not in the rest of the earth. Finally he decided in favor of a poor scholar who had worked ten years for the booksellers of Amsterdam. He judged that there was no profession in the world of which one should be more disgusted.","This extraordinary assembly continued sitting till four in the morning. Candide, while he was listening to their adventures, recalled what the old woman had said to him during their voyage to Buenos Ayres, and the bet she had made that there was not a person on board the ship who had not met with some great misfortunes. Every story he heard made him think of Pangloss. “My old master,” said he, “would be hard pressed to prove his system. If only he were here! Certainly, if everything is for the best, it is in El Dorado, and not in the other parts of the world.” Finally he selected a poor scholar, who had worked ten years for the booksellers at Amsterdam. He decided that no employment could be more detestable.","The meeting lasted till four in the morning. Candide, as he listened to all the stories, remembered what the old woman had told him on the trip to Buenos Aires, and of the wager she had made, that there was nobody on the boat who had not undergone great misfortunes. At every story that was told him, he thought of Pangloss. —That Pangloss, he said, would be hard put to prove his system. I wish he was here. Certainly if everything goes well, it is in Eldorado and not in the rest of the world. At last he decided in favor of a poor scholar who had worked ten years for the booksellers of Amsterdam. He decided that there was no trade in the world with which one should be more disgusted."
"Candide fut très content d’une actrice qui faisait la reine Élisabeth dans une assez plate tragédie que l’on joue quelquefois. « Cette actrice, dit-il à Martin, me plaît beaucoup; elle a un faux air de Mlle Cunégonde; je serais bien aise de la saluer. » L’abbé périgourdin s’offrit à l’introduire chez elle. Candide, élevé en Allemagne, demanda quelle était l’étiquette, et comment on traitait en France les reines d’Angleterre. « Il faut distinguer, dit l’abbé; en province, on les mène au cabaret; à Paris, on les respecte quand elles sont belles, et on les jette à la voirie quand elles sont mortes. — Des reines à la voirie! dit Candide. — Oui vraiment, dit Martin; monsieur l’abbé a raison: j’étais à Paris quand Mlle Monime passa, comme on dit, de cette vie à l’autre; on lui refusa ce que ces gens-ci appellent les honneurs de la sépulture, c’est-à-dire de pourrir avec tous les gueux du quartier dans un vilain cimetière; elle fut enterrée toute seule de sa bande au coin de la rue de Bourgogne; ce qui dut lui faire une peine extrême, car elle pensait très noblement. — Cela est bien impoli, dit Candide. — Que voulez-vous? dit Martin; ces gens-ci sont ainsi faits. Imaginez toutes les contradictions, toutes les incompatibilités possibles, vous les verrez dans le gouvernement, dans les tribunaux, dans les églises, dans les spectacles de cette drôle de nation. — Est-il vrai qu’on rit toujours à Paris? dit Candide. — Oui, dit l’abbé, mais c’est en enrageant; car on s’y plaint de tout avec de grands éclats de rire; et même on y fait en riant les actions les plus détestables.","Candide was very pleased with an actress who played Queen Elizabeth in a rather dull tragedy that is sometimes played. 'This actress,' he said to Martin, 'pleases me very much; she looks like Miss Cunégonde; I would be happy to greet her. The Perigordian abbé offered to introduce her to her room. Candide, brought up in Germany, asked what the etiquette was, and how the queens of England were treated in France. ""We must distinguish,"" said the abbé; in the provinces, they are taken to the cabaret; in Paris, they are respected when they are beautiful, and they are thrown into the garbage when they are dead. — Queens on the road! said Candide. ""Yes, really,"" said Martin; Monsieur l'abbé is right: I was in Paris when Mademoiselle Monime passed, as they say, from this life to the other; he was refused what these people call the honors of burial, that is to say, to rot with all the beggars of the neighborhood in an ugly cemetery; she was buried alone with her band at the corner of the rue de Bourgogne; which must have pained her extremely, for she thought very nobly. ""That's very impolite,"" said Candide. - What do you want? said Martin; these people are like that. Imagine all the contradictions, all the possible incompatibilities, you will see them in the government, in the courts, in the churches, in the shows of this strange nation. ""Is it true that people always laugh in Paris?"" said Candide. ""Yes,"" said the abbé, ""but he is furious; for they complain of everything with great bursts of laughter; and even the most detestable actions are performed there while laughing.","Candide was greatly taken with an actress who performed the part of Queen Elizabeth in a rather dull tragedy.bi “That actress,” he said to Martin, “pleases me greatly. She has some resemblance to Miss Cunégonde. I would like to meet her.” The Abbé of Perigord offered to introduce him to her at her own house. Candide, who was brought up in Germany, wanted to know how one behaved in France with Queens of England. “There is a necessary distinction to be observed in these matters,” said the Abbé. “In a country town we take them to a tavern; here in Paris they are treated with great respect during their lifetime, while they are attractive, and when they die we throw their bodies upon a dunghill.”21 “How,” said Candide, “throw a Queen’s body upon a dunghill!” “The gentleman is quite right,” said Martin; “he tells you nothing but the truth. I happened to be in Paris when Miss Monimia made her exit, as one may say, out of this world into another. She was refused what they call here the rites of sepulture; that is to say she was denied the privilege of rotting in a churchyard by the side of all the beggars in the parish.22 They buried her at the corner of Burgundy Street, which must certainly have shocked her, for she had very exalted notions of things.” “That was very rude,” said Candide. “Lord!” said Martin, “what do you expect? It is the way of these people. Imagine all the contradictions, all the inconsistencies possible, and you may meet with them in the government, the courts of justice, the churches, and the public spectacles of this odd nation.” “Is it true,” said Candide, “that the people of Paris are always laughing?” “Yes,” replied the Abbé; “but it is with anger in their hearts. They express all their complaints by loud bursts of laughter, and commit the most detestable crimes with a smile on their faces.”","Candide was very pleased with an actress who took the part of Queen Elizabeth in a rather dull tragedy74 that still gets played from time to time. —I like this actress very much, he said to Martin, she bears a slight resemblance to Miss Cunégonde; I should like to meet her. The abbé from Perigord offered to introduce him. Candide, raised in Germany, asked what was the protocol, how one behaved in France with queens of England. —You must distinguish, said the abbé; in the provinces, you take them to an inn; at Paris they are respected while still attractive, and thrown on the dunghill when they are dead.75 —Queens on the dunghill! said Candide. —Yes indeed, said Martin, the abbé is right; I was in Paris when Miss Monime herself passed, as they say, from this life to the other; she was refused what these folk call ‘the honors of burial,’ that is, the right to rot with all the beggars of the district in a dirty cemetery; she was buried all alone by her troupe at the corner of the Rue de Bourgogne; this must have been very disagreeable to her, for she had a noble character.76 —That was extremely rude, said Candide. —What do you expect? said Martin; that is how these folk are. Imagine all the contradictions, all the incompatibilities you can, and you will see them in the government, the courts, the churches, and the plays of this crazy nation. —Is it true that they are always laughing in Paris? asked Candide. —Yes, said the abbé, but with a kind of rage too; when people complain of things, they do so amid explosions of laughter; they even laugh as they perform the most detestable actions."
"Il restait au sixième monarque à parler. « Messieurs, dit-il, je ne suis pas si grand seigneur que vous; mais enfin j’ai été roi tout comme un autre. Je suis Théodore; on m’a élu roi en Corse; on m’a appelé Votre Majesté, et à présent, à peine m’appelle-t-on Monsieur. J’ai fait frapper de la monnaie, et je ne possède pas un denier; j’ai eu deux secrétaires d’État, et j’ai à peine un valet; je me suis vu sur un trône, et j’ai longtemps été à Londres en prison, sur la paille. J’ai bien peur d’être traité de même ici, quoique je sois venu comme Vos Majestés passer le carnaval à Venise. »","It remained for the sixth monarch to speak. “Gentlemen,” he said, “I am not so great a lord as you; but in the end I was king like any other. I am Theodore; I was elected king in Corsica; they called me Your Majesty, and now they hardly ever call me Sir. I've had coins minted, and I don't have a denarius; I've had two secretaries of state, and I barely have a valet; I saw myself on a throne, and I was a long time in London in prison, on straw. I'm afraid I'll be treated the same here, although I came like Your Majesties to spend the carnival in Venice. »","It now came to the sixth monarch ’s turn to speak. “Gentlemen,” said he, “I am not so great a prince as the rest of you, it is true, but I am, however, a crowned head. I am Theodore, elected king of Corsica.ci I have had the title of majesty, and am now barely treated with common civility. I have coined money and am not now worth a single ducat. I have had two secretaries, and am now without a valet. I was once seated on a throne, and since then have lain upon a truss of straw in a common jail in London, and I very much fear I shall meet with the same fate here in Venice, where I’ve come, like your majesties, to divert myself at the Carnival.”","It remained for the sixth monarch to speak. —Gentlemen, said he, I am no such great lord as you, but I have in fact been a king like any other.

"« Enfin, pour détourner le fléau des tremblements de terre, et pour intimider don Issacar, il plut à monseigneur l’inquisiteur de célébrer un auto-da-fé. Il me fit l’honneur de m’y inviter. Je fus très bien placée; on servit aux dames des rafraîchissements entre la messe et l’exécution. Je fus, à la vérité, saisie d’horreur en voyant brûler ces deux Juifs et cet honnête Biscayen qui avait épousé sa commère; mais quelle fut ma surprise, mon effroi, mon trouble, quand je vis, dans un san-benito et sous une mitre, une figure qui ressemblait à celle de Pangloss! Je me frottai les yeux, je regardai attentivement, je le vis pendre; je tombai en faiblesse. A peine reprenais-je mes sens que je vous vis dépouillé tout nu: ce fut là le comble de l’horreur, de la consternation, de la douleur, du désespoir. Je vous dirai, avec vérité, que votre peau est encore plus blanche et d’un incarnat plus parfait que celle de mon capitaine des Bulgares. Cette vue redoubla tous les sentiments qui m’accablaient, qui me dévoraient. Je m’écriai, je voulus dire: « Arrêtez, barbares! » mais la voix me manqua, et mes cris auraient été inutiles. Quand vous eûtes été bien fessé: « Comment se peut-il faire, disais-je, que l’aimable Candide et le sage Pangloss se trouvent à Lisbonne, l’un pour recevoir cent coups de fouet, et l’autre pour être pendu par l’ordre de monseigneur l’inquisiteur dont je suis la bien-aimée? Pangloss m’a donc bien cruellement trompée quand il me disait que tout va le mieux du monde. »","“Finally, to avert the scourge of earthquakes, and to intimidate Don Issacar, it pleased Monsignor the Inquisitor to celebrate an auto-da-fé. He did me the honor of inviting me. I was very well placed; refreshments were served to the ladies between the mass and the execution. I was, in truth, seized with horror on seeing these two Jews and this honest Vizcayan who had married his gossip burned; but what was my surprise, my terror, my confusion, when I saw, in a san-benito and under a miter, a face which resembled that of Pangloss! I rubbed my eyes, I looked attentively, I saw him hanging; I fell into weakness. Hardly had I regained my senses than I saw you stripped naked: this was the height of horror, consternation, pain, despair. I will tell you, with truth, that your skin is still whiter and of a more perfect incarnate color than that of my captain of the Bulgarians. This sight redoubled all the feelings that overwhelmed me, that devoured me. I cried out, I wanted to say: “Stop, barbarians! but my voice failed me, and my cries would have been useless. When you had been well spanked: ""How can it be, I said, that the amiable Candide and the wise Pangloss are in Lisbon, one to receive a hundred lashes, and the other to be hanged? by order of the Inquisitor, whose beloved I am? Pangloss therefore cruelly deceived me when he told me that everything was going for the best in the world. »","“Finally, to avert further earthquakes, and to intimidate Don Issachar, my Lord Inquisitor chose to celebrate an auto-da-fé. He did me the honour of inviting me to the ceremony. I had a very good seat; and refreshments of all kinds were offered the ladies between mass and the execution. I was dreadfully shocked at the burning of the two Jews and the honest Biscayner who married his godmother; but how great was my surprise, my consternation and concern, when I beheld a figure so like Pangloss, dressed in a san-benito and mitre! I rubbed my eyes, I looked at him attentively. I saw him hanged and I fainted. Scarcely had I recovered my senses when I saw you , stark naked: this was the peak of horror, grief and despair. I must confess to you for a truth, that your skin is far whiter and more delicate than that of the Bulgarian captain. This spectacle worked me up to a pitch of distraction. I screamed out, and would have said, ‘Hold, barbarians!’ but my voice failed me; and indeed my cries would have been useless. After you had been severely whipped, ‘How is it possible,’ I said to myself, ‘that the lovely Candide and the sage Pangloss should be in Lisbon, the one to receive a hundred lashes, and the other to be hanged, by order of my Lord Inquisitor, whose mistress I am?’ Pangloss deceived me most cruelly in saying that everything is fittest and best.","—Finally, in order to avert further divine punishment by earthquake, and to terrify Don Issachar, My Lord the Inquisitor chose to celebrate an auto-da-fé. He did me the honor of inviting me to attend. I had an excellent seat; the ladies were served with refreshments between the mass and the execution. To tell you the truth, I was horrified to see them burn alive those two jews and that decent Biscayan who had married his child’s godmother; but what was my surprise, my terror, my grief, when I saw, huddled in a san-benito and wearing a mitre, someone who looked like Pangloss! I rubbed my eyes, I watched his every move , I saw him hanged; and I fell back in a swoon. Scarcely had I come to my senses again, when I saw you stripped for the lash; that was the peak of my horror, consternation, grief, and despair. I may tell you, by the way, that your skin is even whiter and more delicate than that of my Bulgar captain. Seeing you, then, redoubled the torments which were already overwhelming me. I shrieked aloud, I wanted to call out, ‘Let him go, you brutes!’ but my voice died within me, and my cries would have been useless. When you had been thoroughly thrashed: ‘How can it be,’ I asked myself, ‘that agreeable Candide and wise Pangloss have come to Lisbon, one to receive a hundred whiplashes, the other to be hanged by order of My Lord the Inquisitor, whose mistress I am? Pangloss must have deceived me cruelly when he told me that all is for the best in this world.’"

"Le quatrième prit alors la parole et dit: « Je suis roi des Polaques; le sort de la guerre m’a privé de mes États héréditaires; mon père a éprouvé les mêmes revers; je me résigne à la Providence comme le sultan Achmet, l’empereur Ivan et le roi Charles-Édouard, à qui Dieu donne une longue vie, et je suis venu passer le carnaval à Venise. »","The fourth then spoke and said: “I am king of the Polachs; the fate of the war deprived me of my hereditary States; my father experienced the same setbacks; I resign myself to Providence like Sultan Achmet, Emperor Ivan and King Charles Edward, to whom God grants a long life, and I have come to spend the carnival in Venice. »","I am going to Rome to visit the king my father, who was dethroned as well as myself and my grandfather; and I am here to spend the Carnival at Venice.” The fourth spoke thus: “I am the King of Poland;cg the fortune of war has stripped me of my hereditary dominions.

I resign myself to the will of Providence, in the same manner as Sultan Achmet, the Emperor Ivan, and King Charles Edward, to whom, I hope, God gives long lives; and I am here to spend the Carnival at Venice.”","The fourth king then spoke up, and said: —I am a king of the Poles;103 the luck of war has deprived me of my hereditary estates; my father suffered the same losses; I submit to Providence like Sultan Achmet, Emperor Ivan, and King Charles Edward, to whom I hope heaven grants long lives; and I have come to pass the carnival season at Venice."

"— Votre Excellence ne pense pas ainsi de Virgile? dit Candide. — Je conviens, dit Pococurante, que le second, le quatrième et le sixième livre de son Énéide sont excellents; mais pour son pieux Énée, et le fort Cloanthe, et l’ami Achates, et le petit Ascanius, et l’imbécile roi Latinus, et la bourgeoise Amata, et l’insipide Lavinia, je ne crois pas qu’il y ait rien de si froid et de plus désagréable. J’aime mieux le Tasse et les contes à dormir debout de l’Arioste.","""Your Excellency doesn't think so of Virgil?"" said Candide. ""I agree,"" said Pococurante, ""that the second, fourth, and sixth books of his Aeneid are excellent; but for his pious Aeneas, and the strong Cloanthe, and the friend Achates, and the little Ascanius, and the imbecile King Latinus, and the bourgeois Amata, and the insipid Lavinia, I do not believe there is anything so cold and so unpleasant. I prefer Tasso and Ariosto's tall tales.","“But your excellency does not hold the same opinion of Virgil?” said Candide. “I concede,” replied Pococuranté, “that the second, third, fourth, and sixth books of his Aeneid are excellent; but as for his pious Aeneas, his strong Cloanthus, his friendly Achates, his boy Ascanius, his silly king Latinus, his ill-bred Amata, his insipid Lavinia, and some other characters much in the same strain, I don’t believe there was ever anything more flat and disagreeable. I must confess I prefer Tasso and even that sleepy tale-teller Ariosto.”27","—Your Excellence doesn’t hold the same opinion of Virgil? said Candide. —I concede, said Pococurante, that the second, fourth, and sixth books of his Aeneid are fine; but as for his pious Aeneas, and strong Cloanthes, and faithful Achates, and little Ascanius, and that imbecile King Latinus, and middle-class Amata, and insipid Lavinia, I don’t suppose there was ever anything so cold and unpleasant.95 I prefer Tasso and those sleepwalkers’ stories of Ariosto.96"
"L’exempt alors expliqua de quoi il s’agissait. « Ah, les monstres! s’écria Candide; quoi! de telles horreurs chez un peuple qui danse et qui chante! Ne pourrai-je sortir au plus vite de ce pays où des singes agacent des tigres? J’ai vu des ours dans mon pays; je n’ai vu des hommes que dans le Dorado. Au nom de Dieu, monsieur l’exempt, menez-moi à Venise, où je dois attendre Mlle Cunégonde. — Je ne peux vous mener qu’en Basse-Normandie, » dit le barigel. Aussitôt il lui fait ôter ses fers, dit qu’il s’est mépris, renvoie ses gens et emmène à Dieppe Candide et Martin, et les laisse entre les mains de son frère. Il y avait un petit vaisseau hollandais à la rade. Le Normand, à l’aide de trois autres diamants, devenu le plus serviable des hommes, embarque Candide et ses gens dans le vaisseau qui allait faire voile pour Portsmouth en Angleterre. Ce n’était pas le chemin de Venise; mais Candide croyait être délivré de l’enfer, et il comptait bien reprendre la route de Venise à la première occasion.","The exempt then explained what it was about. “Ah, the monsters! exclaimed Candide; what! such horrors in a people who dance and sing! Couldn't I get out of this country as quickly as possible where monkeys annoy tigers? I have seen bears in my country; I only saw men in the Dorado. In the name of God, Mr. Exempt, take me to Venice, where I must wait for Miss Cunégonde. ""I can only take you to Lower Normandy,"" said the barigel. Immediately he makes him take off his irons, says he was mistaken, sends his people back and takes Candide and Martin to Dieppe, and leaves them in the hands of his brother. There was a small Dutch vessel in the harbour. The Norman, with the help of three other diamonds, who had become the most helpful of men, embarked Candide and his people on the ship which was going to sail for Portsmouth in England. It was not the way to Venice; but Candide thought he was delivered from hell, and he counted on resuming the road to Venice at the first opportunity.","The officer then explained to them what that was all about. “Horrid monsters!” exclaimed Candide. “Is it possible that such scenes could happen among a people who are perpetually singing and dancing ? Can I flee this abominable country immediately, this execrable kingdom, where monkeys provoke tigers? I have seen bears in my country, but men I have seen nowhere but in El Dorado. In the name of God, sir,” said he to the officer, “get me to Venice, where I must wait for Miss Cunégonde.” “Really, sir,” replied the officer, “I cannot possibly take you farther than Lower Normandy.” So saying, he ordered Candide’s irons to be struck off, acknowledged himself mistaken, and dismissed his squad of followers; after this he took Candide and Martin to Dieppe, and left them in the care of his brother. There happened just then to be a small Dutch ship at anchor. The Norman, whom the other three diamonds had converted into the most helpful of men, made sure that Candide and his attendants got safely on board this vessel, which was just ready to sail for Portsmouth in England. This was not the nearest way to Venice indeed; but Candide felt that he’d just escaped from hell, and did not doubt that he would quickly find an opportunity to resume his voyage to Venice. THE ARREST OF CANDIDE","The bailiff then explained what it was all about.86 —Foh! what beasts! cried Candide. What! monstrous behavior of this sort from a people who sing and dance? As soon as I can, let me get out of this country, where the monkeys provoke the tigers. In my own country I’ve lived with bears; only in Eldorado are there proper men. In the name of God, sir bailiff, get me to Venice where I can wait for Miss Cunégonde. —I can only get you to Lower Normandy, said the guardsman. He had the irons removed at once, said there had been a mistake, dismissed his gang, and took Candide and Martin to Dieppe, where he left them with his brother. There was a little Dutch ship at anchor. The Norman, changed by three more diamonds into the most helpful of men, put Candide and his people aboard the vessel, which was bound for Portsmouth in England. It wasn’t on the way to Venice, but Candide felt like a man just let out of hell; and he hoped to get back on the road to Venice at the first possible occasion."
"Le souper fut comme la plupart des soupers de Paris: d’abord du silence, ensuite un bruit de paroles qu’on ne distingue point, puis des plaisanteries dont la plupart sont insipides, de fausses nouvelles, de mauvais raisonnements, un peu de politique et beaucoup de médisance; on parla même de livres nouveaux. « Avez-vous lu, dit l’abbé périgourdin, le roman du sieur Gauchat, docteur en théologie? — Oui, répondit un des convives, mais je n’ai pu l’achever. Nous avons une foule d’écrits impertinents, mais tous ensemble n’approchent pas de l’impertinence de Gauchat, docteur en théologie; je suis si rassasié de cette immensité de détestables livres qui nous inondent que je me suis mis à ponter au pharaon. — Et les Mélanges de l’archidiacre Trublet, qu’en dites-vous? dit l’abbé. — Ah! dit Mme de Parolignac, l’ennuyeux mortel! comme il vous dit curieusement tout ce que le monde sait! comme il discute pesamment ce qui ne vaut pas la peine d’être remarqué légèrement! comme il s’approprie sans esprit l’esprit des autres! comme il gâte ce qu’il pille! comme il me dégoûte! Mais il ne me dégoûtera plus: c’est assez d’avoir lu quelques pages de l’archidiacre. »","The supper was like most suppers in Paris: first silence, then a noise of indiscernible words, then jokes, most of which are insipid, false news, bad reasoning, a little politics. and much backbiting; there was even talk of new books. ""Have you read,"" said the Périgord abbot, ""the novel by Sieur Gauchat, doctor of theology?"" ""Yes,"" replied one of the guests, ""but I couldn't finish him."" We have a host of impertinent writings, but all together do not approach the impertinence of Gauchat, doctor of theology; I am so satiated with this immensity of detestable books which flood us that I began to lay pharaoh. ""And the Miscellanies of Archdeacon Trublet, what do you say to them?"" said the abbot. - Ah! said Madame de Parolignac, the boring mortal! how curiously he tells you everything the world knows! how ponderously he discusses what is not worth noting lightly! how mindlessly he appropriates the minds of others! how he spoils what he plunders! how it disgusts me! But it will no longer disgust me: it is enough to have read a few pages of the Archdeacon. »","The supper was like most others of this kind in Paris. At first every one was silent; then followed a few confused murmurs, and afterwards several insipid jokes, false reports, false reasonings, a little politics, and a great deal of scandal. The conversation then turned upon the new productions in literature. “Tell me,” said the Abbé, “have you seen the romance written by the Sieur Gauchat, doctor of divinity?”bm “Yes,” answered one of the guests, “but I didn’t have patience to finish it. The town is pestered with a swarm of impertinent publications, but this of Dr Gauchat’s outdoes them all. In short, I was so horribly tired of reading this vile stuff, that I even decided to come here, and play cards.” “But what do you think about the Archdeacon T—’sbn miscellaneous collection?” said the Abbé. “Oh, my God!” cried the Marchioness of Parolignac, “never mention that tedious creature. He takes such pains to tell you what everyone knows; and how he talks so learnedly on matters that are hardly worth the slightest consideration! How absurdly he makes use of other people’s wit! how miserably he mangles what he has pilfered from them! The man makes me quite sick. A few pages of the good archdeacon are plenty.”","The supper was like most Parisian suppers: first silence, then an indistinguishable rush of words; then jokes, mostly insipid, false news, bad logic, a little politics, a great deal of malice. They even talked of new books. —Have you seen the new novel by Dr. Gauchat,81 the theologian? asked the abbé from Perigord. —Oh yes, answered one of the guests; but I couldn’t finish it. We have a horde of impudent scribblers nowadays, but all of them put together don’t match the impudence of this Gauchat, this doctor of theology. I have been so struck by the enormous number of detestable books which are swamping us that I have taken up punting at faro. —And the Collected Essays of Archdeacon T82— asked the abbé, what do you think of them? —Ah, said Madame de Parolignac, what a frightful bore he is! He takes such pains to tell you what everyone knows; he discourses so learnedly on matters which aren’t worth a casual remark! He plunders, and not even wittily, the wit of other people! He spoils what he plunders, he’s disgusting! But he’ll never disgust me again; a couple of pages of the archdeacon have been enough for me."
"Ce dernier discours détermina Candide; il alla se jeter aux pieds de son charitable anabaptiste Jacques, et lui fit une peinture si touchante de l’état où son ami était réduit que le bonhomme n’hésita pas à recueillir le docteur Pangloss; il le fit guérir à ses dépens. Pangloss, dans la cure, ne perdit qu’un oeil et une oreille. Il écrivait bien et savait parfaitement l’arithmétique. L’anabaptiste Jacques en fit son teneur de livres. Au bout de deux mois, étant obligé d’aller à Lisbonne pour les affaires de son commerce, il mena dans son vaisseau ses deux philosophes. Pangloss lui expliqua comment tout était on ne peut mieux. Jacques n’était pas de cet avis. « Il faut bien, disait-il, que les hommes aient un peu corrompu la nature, car ils ne sont point nés loups, et ils sont devenus loups. Dieu ne leur a donné ni canon de vingt-quatre ni baïonnettes, et ils se sont fait des baïonnettes et des canons pour se détruire. Je pourrais mettre en ligne de compte les banqueroutes, et la justice qui s’empare des biens des banqueroutiers pour en frustrer les créanciers. — Tout cela était indispensable, répliquait le docteur borgne, et les malheurs particuliers font le bien général, de sorte que plus il y a de malheurs particuliers, et plus tout est bien. » Tandis qu’il raisonnait, l’air s’obscurcit, les vents soufflèrent des quatre coins du monde et le vaisseau fut assailli de la plus horrible tempête à la vue du port de Lisbonne.","This last speech determined Candide; he went and threw himself at the feet of his charitable Anabaptist Jacques, and painted for him such a touching picture of the state in which his friend was reduced that the worthy man did not hesitate to take in Doctor Pangloss; he healed him at his expense. Pangloss, in the cure, lost only one eye and one ear. He wrote well and knew arithmetic perfectly. The Anabaptist Jacques made him his bookkeeper. At the end of two months, being obliged to go to Lisbon on business, he took his two philosophers in his ship. Pangloss explained to him how everything could not have been better. Jacques disagreed. “Men must have corrupted nature a little, he said, for they were not born wolves, and they became wolves. God gave them neither twenty-four cannons nor bayonets, and they made themselves bayonets and cannons to destroy themselves. I could put bankruptcies into account, and the justice that seizes the property of bankrupts to frustrate their creditors. ""All that was indispensable,"" replied the one-eyed doctor, ""and particular misfortunes do the general good, so that the more particular misfortunes there are, the better everything is."" As he reasoned, the air darkened, the winds blew from the four corners of the world, and the ship was beset by the most horrible storm in sight of the port of Lisbon.","This last speech had its effect on Candide. He flew to the charitable Anabaptist James. He flung himself at his feet, and gave him so striking a picture of the miserable situation of his friend, that the good man, without any further hesitation, agreed to take Dr. Pangloss into his house and to pay for his cure. During the course of the cure Pangloss lost only one eye and one ear. Since his handwriting was good and he understood accounts tolerably well, the Anabaptist made him his bookkeeper. At the end of two months, being obliged to go to Lisbon about some mercantile affairs, he took the two philosophers with him in the same ship. Pangloss during the course of the voyage explained to him how everything was so constituted that it could not be better. James did not quite agree with him on this point. “Mankind,” said he, “must in some things have deviated from their original innocence; for they were not born wolves, and yet they worry one another like those beasts of prey. God never gave them twenty-four pounders nor bayonets, and yet they have made cannon and bayonets to destroy one another. To this list I might add not only bankruptcies, but the law which seizes on the effects of bankrupts, only to cheat the creditors.” 4 “All this was indispensably necessary,” replied the one-eyed doctor; “for private misfortunes are public benefits; so that the more private misfortunes there are the greater is the general good.” While he was arguing in this manner the sky was overcast, the winds blew from the four quarters of the compass, and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest within sight of the port of Lisbon.","These last words decided Candide; he hastened to implore the help of his charitable Anabaptist, Jacques, and painted such a moving picture of his friend’s wretched state that the good man did not hesitate to take in Pangloss and have him cured at his own expense. In the course of the cure, Pangloss lost only an eye and an ear. Since he wrote a fine hand and knew arithmetic, the Anabaptist made him his bookkeeper. At the end of two months, being obliged to go to Lisbon on business, he took his two philosophers on the boat with him. Pangloss still maintained that everything was for the best, but Jacques didn’t agree with him. —It must be, said he, that men have somehow corrupted Nature, for they are not born wolves, yet that is what they become. God gave them neither twenty-four-pound cannon nor bayonets, yet they have manufactured both in order to destroy themselves. Bankruptcies have the same effect, and so does the justice which seizes the goods of bankrupts in order to prevent the creditors from getting them.17 —It was all indispensable, replied the one-eyed doctor, since private misfortunes make for public welfare, and therefore the more private misfortunes there are, the better everything is. While he was reasoning, the air grew dark, the winds blew from all directions, and the vessel was attacked by a horrible tempest within sight of Lisbon harbor."
"Le troisième dit: « Je suis Charles-Édouard, roi d’Angleterre; mon père m’a cédé ses droits au royaume; j’ai combattu pour les soutenir; on a arraché le coeur à huit cents de mes partisans, et on leur en a battu les joues. J’ai été mis en prison; je vais à Rome faire une visite au roi mon père, détrôné ainsi que moi et mon grand-père, et je suis venu passer le carnaval à Venise. »","The third said, “I am Charles Edward, King of England; my father ceded his rights to the kingdom to me; I fought to support them; they tore out the hearts of eight hundred of my partisans, and beat their cheeks with it.

"D’abord deux filles jolies et proprement mises servirent du chocolat qu’elles firent très bien mousser. Candide ne put s’empêcher de les louer sur leur beauté, sur leur bonne grâce et sur leur adresse. « Ce sont d’assez bonnes créatures, dit le sénateur Pococurante; je les fais quelquefois coucher dans mon lit, car je suis bien las des dames de la ville, de leurs coquetteries, de leurs jalousies, de leurs querelles, de leurs humeurs, de leurs petitesses, de leur orgueil, de leurs sottises, et des sonnets qu’il faut faire ou commander pour elles; mais, après tout, ces deux filles commencent fort à m’ennuyer. »","First two pretty and neatly dressed girls served chocolate which they frothed very well. Candide could not refrain from praising them for their beauty, their good grace and their address. ""They're pretty good creatures,"" said Senator Pococurante; I sometimes make them sleep in my bed, for I am very tired of the ladies of the city, of their coquetry, their jealousies, their quarrels, their humors, their pettiness, their pride, their foolishness, and sonnets that must be made or commissioned for them; but, after all, these two girls are beginning to bore me very much. »","As soon as they were seated, two very pretty girls, neatly dressed, brought in chocolate, which was extremely well frothed. Candide could not help praising their beauty and grace. “They are pretty good creatures,” said the senator. “I make them my companions, for I am tired of the ladies of the town, their coquetry, their jealousy, their quarrels, their humours, their meannesses, their pride, and their folly. I am weary of making sonnets, or of paying for sonnets to be made on them; but after all, these two girls are beginning to bore me.”","First two pretty and neatly dressed girls served chocolate, which they whipped to a froth. Candide could not forbear praising their beauty, their grace, their skill. —They are pretty good creatures, said Pococurante; I sometimes have them into my bed, for I’m tired of the ladies of the town, with their stupid tricks, quarrels, jealousies, fits of ill humor and petty pride, and all the sonnets one has to make or order for them; but, after all, these two girls are starting to bore me too."
"Ce procédé acheva de désespérer Candide; il avait à la vérité essuyé des malheurs mille fois plus douloureux; mais le sang-froid du juge, et celui du patron dont il était volé, alluma sa bile, et le plongea dans une noire mélancolie. La méchanceté des hommes se présentait à son esprit dans toute sa laideur; il ne se nourrissait que d’idées tristes. Enfin, un vaisseau français étant sur le point de partir pour Bordeaux, comme il n’avait plus de moutons chargés de diamants à embarquer, il loua une chambre du vaisseau à juste prix, et fit signifier dans la ville qu’il payerait le passage, la nourriture, et donnerait deux mille piastres à un honnête homme qui voudrait faire le voyage avec lui, à condition que cet homme serait le plus dégoûté de son état et le plus malheureux de la province.","This proceeding completed Candide's despair; he had, in truth, suffered misfortunes a thousand times more painful; but the sangfroid of the judge, and that of the patron from whom he was robbed, kindled his bile, and plunged him into a black melancholy. The wickedness of men presented itself to his mind in all its ugliness; he fed only on sad ideas. Finally, a French vessel being on the point of leaving for Bordeaux, as he had no more sheep laden with diamonds to embark, he rented a room in the vessel at a fair price, and made it known in the city that he would pay the passage. , food, and would give two thousand piastres to an honest man who would like to travel with him, on condition that this man would be the most disgusted with his condition and the most unfortunate in the province.","This treatment completed Candide’s despair. It is true he had suffered misfortunes a thousand times more grievous; but the cool insolence of the judge and the villainy of the skipper raised his anger and threw him into a deep melancholy. The villainy of mankind presented itself to his mind in all its deformity, and his mind dwelt only on gloomy thoughts. After some time, hearing that the captain of a French ship was ready to set sail for Bordeaux, as he had no more sheep loaded with diamonds to put on board, he took a cabin at a fair price; and made it known in the town that he would pay the passage and board of any honest man who would keep him company during the voyage, besides making him a present of ten thousand piastres, on condition that such person must be the most disgusted with his own condition, and the most unhappy in the whole province.","This legal proceeding completed the despair of Candide. In fact he had experienced miseries a thousand times more painful, but the coldness of the judge, and that of the merchant who had robbed him, roused his bile and plunged him into a black melancholy. The malice of men rose up before his spirit in all its ugliness, and his mind dwelt only on gloomy thoughts. Finally, when a French vessel was ready to leave for Bordeaux, since he had no more diamond-laden sheep to transport, he took a cabin at a fair price, and made it known in the town that he would pay passage and keep, plus two thousand piastres, to any honest man who wanted to make the journey with him, on condition that this man must be the most disgusted with his own condition and the most unhappy man in the province."

"Candide ne s’arrêta dans Bordeaux qu’autant de temps qu’il en fallait pour vendre quelques cailloux du Dorado, et pour s’accommoder d’une bonne chaise à deux places; car il ne pouvait plus se passer de son philosophe Martin. Il fut seulement très fâché de se séparer de son mouton, qu’il laissa à l’Académie des sciences de Bordeaux, laquelle proposa pour le sujet du prix de cette année de trouver pourquoi la laine de ce mouton était rouge; et le prix fut adjugé à un savant du Nord, qui démontra par A plus B, moins C, divisé par Z, que le mouton devait être rouge, et mourir de la clavelée.","Candide stopped in Bordeaux only as long as it took to sell a few pebbles from the Dorado, and to put up with a good two-seater chair; for he could no longer do without his philosopher Martin.

"Candide, apercevant un Milton, lui demanda s’il ne regardait pas cet auteur comme un grand homme. « Qui? dit Pococurante, ce barbare qui fait un long commentaire du premier chapitre de la Genèse en dix livres de vers durs? ce grossier imitateur des Grecs, qui défigure la création, et qui, tandis que Moïse représente l’Être éternel produisant le monde par la parole, fait prendre un grand compas par le Messiah dans une armoire du ciel pour tracer son ouvrage? Moi, j’estimerais celui qui a gâté l’enfer et le diable du Tasse; qui déguise Lucifer tantôt en crapaud, tantôt en pygmée; qui lui fait rebattre cent fois les mêmes discours; qui le fait disputer sur la théologie; qui, en imitant sérieusement l’invention comique des armes à feu de l’Arioste, fait tirer le canon dans le ciel par les diables? Ni moi, ni personne en Italie, n’a pu se plaire à toutes ces tristes extravagances. Le Mariage du Péché et de la Mort et les couleuvres dont le péché accouche font vomir tout homme qui a le goût un peu délicat, et sa longue description d’un hôpital n’est bonne que pour un fossoyeur. Ce poème obscur, bizarre et dégoûtant, fut méprisé à sa naissance; je le traite aujourd’hui comme il fut traité dans sa patrie par les contemporains. Au reste, je dis ce que je pense, et je me soucie fort peu que les autres pensent comme moi. » Candide était affligé de ces discours; il respectait Homère, il aimait un peu Milton. « Hélas! dit-il tout bas à Martin, j’ai bien peur que cet homme-ci n’ait un souverain mépris pour nos poètes allemands. — Il n’y aurait pas grand mal à cela, dit Martin. — Oh, quel homme supérieur! disait encore Candide entre ses dents, quel grand génie que ce Pococurante! rien ne peut lui plaire. »","Candide, seeing a Milton, asked him if he did not regard this author as a great man. "" Which? said Pococurante, that barbarian who makes a long commentary on the first chapter of Genesis in ten books of hard verse? this gross imitator of the Greeks, who disfigures creation, and who, while Moses represents the Eternal Being producing the world by the word, has the Messiah take a large compass from a cupboard in heaven to trace his work? I would esteem him who spoiled Tasso's hell and devil; which disguises Lucifer sometimes as a toad, sometimes as a pygmy; which makes him repeat the same speeches a hundred times; which makes him argue about theology; who, in earnest imitation of Ariosto's comic invention of firearms, makes the devils fire the cannon into the sky? Neither I nor anyone in Italy could enjoy all these sad extravagances. The Marriage of Sin and Death and the snakes from which sin gives birth make any man of delicate taste vomit, and its long description of a hospital is good only for a gravedigger. This obscure, bizarre and disgusting poem was despised at its birth; I treat him today as he was treated in his homeland by his contemporaries. Besides, I say what I think, and I care very little that others think like me. Candide was distressed by these speeches; he respected Homer, he liked Milton a little. “Alas! he said quietly to Martin, I'm afraid this man has a sovereign contempt for our German poets. ""There wouldn't be much harm in that,"" said Martin. ""Oh, what a superior man!"" said Candide again between his teeth, what a great genius this Pococurante is! nothing can please him. »","Candide, seeing an edition of a Milton,cc asked the senator if he did not consider that author a great man. “Who?” said Pococuranté sharply. “That barbarian, who writes a tedious commentary, in ten books of rambling verse, on the first chapter of Genesis! That slovenly imitator of the Greeks, who disfigures creation by making the Messiah take a pair of compasses from Heaven’s cupboard in order to plan the world while Moses represents the Deity as creating the world with a word! You expect me to admire a writer who has spoiled Tasso’s hell and devil; who transforms Lucifer, sometimes into a toad, and at other times into a pigmy; who makes him say the same thing a hundred times over; who makes him argue theology : and who, by an absurdly serious imitation of Ariosto’s comic invention of fire-arms, has the devils firing cannon in heaven! Neither I, nor any other Italian, can possibly take pleasure in such melancholy reveries. But the marriage of sin and death, and snakes that sin gives birth to, are enough to make any person sick whose taste is at all refined. This obscene, whimsical, and disagreeable poem met with the disdain that it deserved at its first publication; and I only treat the author now as he was treated in his own country by his contemporaries.” Candide was grieved at this speech, as he had a great respect for Homer and was very fond of Milton. “Alas!” said he very softly to Martin, “I am afraid this man holds our German poets in great contempt.” “There would be no great harm in that,” said Martin. “Oh, what a surprising man!” said Candide to himself; “what a great genius this Pococuranté must be! Nothing can please him.”","Candide, noting a Milton, asked if he did not consider this author a great man. —Who? said Pococurante. That barbarian who made a long commentary on the first chapter of Genesis in ten books of crabbed verse?

You expect me to admire the man who spoiled Tasso’s hell and devil? who disguises Lucifer now as a toad, now as a pigmy? who makes him rehash the same arguments a hundred times over? who makes him argue theology? and who, taking seriously Ariosto’s comic story of the invention of firearms, has the devils shooting off cannon in heaven? Neither I nor anyone else in Italy has been able to enjoy these gloomy extravagances.99 The marriage of Sin and Death, and the monster that Sin gives birth to, will nauseate any man whose taste is at all refined; and his long description of a hospital is good only for a gravedigger. This obscure, extravagant, and disgusting poem was despised at its birth; I treat it today as it was treated in its own country by its contemporaries. Anyhow, I say what I think, and care very little whether other people agree with me. Candide was a little cast down by these diatribes; he respected Homer, and had a little affection for Milton. —Alas, he said under his breath to Martin, I’m afraid this man will have a supreme contempt for our German poets. —No harm in that, said Martin. — Oh what a superior man, said Candide, still speaking softly, what a great genius this Pococurante must be! Nothing can please him."
"« Dès que mes compagnes purent marcher, on les fit aller à Moscou. J’échus en partage à un boyard qui me fit sa jardinière, et qui me donnait vingt coups de fouet par jour. Mais ce seigneur ayant été roué au bout de deux ans avec une trentaine de boyards pour quelque tracasserie de cour, je profitai de cette aventure; je m’enfuis; je traversai toute la Russie; je fus longtemps servante de cabaret à Riga, puis à Rostock, à Vismar, à Leipsick, à Cassel, à Utrecht, à Leyde, à La Haye, à Rotterdam: j’ai vieilli dans la misère et dans l’opprobre, n’ayant que la moitié d’un derrière, me souvenant toujours que j’étais fille d’un pape; je voulus cent fois me tuer, mais j’aimais encore la vie. Cette faiblesse ridicule est peut-être un de nos penchants les plus funestes; car y a t-il rien de plus sot que de vouloir porter continuellement un fardeau qu’on veut toujours jeter par terre? d’avoir son être en horreur, et de tenir à son être? enfin de caresser le serpent qui nous dévore, jusqu’à ce qu’il nous ait mangé le coeur?","“As soon as my companions could walk, they were sent to Moscow.

This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our most fatal inclinations; because is there anything more stupid than wanting to continually carry a burden that you always want to throw on the ground? to have his being in horror, and to cling to his being? finally to caress the serpent that devours us, until it has eaten our hearts?","As soon as my companions were in a condition to walk, they were sent to Moscow.

"Candide baisa d’abord le bas de la robe du commandant, ensuite ils se mirent à table. « Vous êtes donc allemand? lui dit le jésuite en cette langue. — Oui, mon Révérend Père », dit Candide. L’un et l’autre, en prononçant ces paroles, se regardaient avec une extrême surprise et une émotion dont ils n’étaient pas les maîtres. « Et de quel pays d’Allemagne êtes-vous? dit le jésuite. — De la sale province de Vestphalie, dit Candide: je suis né dans le château de Thunder-ten-tronckh. — Ô ciel! est il possible? s’écria le commandant. — Quel miracle! s’écria Candide. — Serait-ce vous? dit le commandant. — Cela n’est pas possible », dit Candide.

""So you are German?"" said the Jesuit to him in that language. ""Yes, my Reverend Father,"" said Candide.

"A peine Candide fut-il dans son auberge qu’il fut attaqué d’une maladie légère causée par ses fatigues.

Being reduced to the extremity of famine, they found themselves obliged to kill our two eunuchs, and eat them, rather than violate their oath. After a few more days, they resolved to eat the women too.","—The aga, who was a gallant soldier, took his whole seraglio with him, and established us in a little fort amid the Maeotian marshes,38 guarded by two black eunuchs and twenty soldiers. Our side killed a prodigious number of Russians, but they paid us back nicely. Azov was put to fire and sword without respect for age or sex; only our little fort continued to resist, and the enemy determined to starve us out. The twenty janizaries had sworn never to surrender. Reduced to the last extremities of hunger, they were forced to eat our two eunuchs, lest they violate their oaths. After several more days, they decided to eat the women too."

"« Je n’ai pas eu toujours les yeux éraillés et bordés d’écarlate; mon nez n’a pas toujours touché à mon menton, et je n’ai pas toujours été servante. Je suis la fille du pape Urbain X, et de la princesse de Palestrine. On m’éleva jusqu’à quatorze ans dans un palais auquel tous les châteaux de vos barons allemands n’auraient pas servi d’écurie; et une de mes robes valait mieux que toutes les magnificences de la Vestphalie. Je croissais en beauté, en grâces, en talents, au milieu des plaisirs, des respects et des espérances. J’inspirais déjà de l’amour, ma gorge se formait; et quelle gorge! blanche, ferme, taillée comme celle de la Vénus de Médicis; et quels yeux! quelles paupières! quels sourcils noirs! quelles flammes brillaient dans mes deux prunelles, et effaçaient la scintillation des étoiles, comme me disaient les poètes du quartier. Les femmes qui m’habillaient et qui me déshabillaient tombaient en extase en me regardant par-devant et par-derrière, et tous les hommes auraient voulu être à leur place.","“I haven’t always had scratchy, scarlet-rimmed eyes; my nose has not always touched my chin, and I have not always been a servant. I am the daughter of Pope Urban X, and the Princess of Palestine. I was brought up until I was fourteen in a palace to which all the castles of your German barons would not have served as stables; and one of my dresses was worth more than all the magnificence of Vestphalia. I grew in beauty, in graces, in talents, in the midst of pleasures, respects and hopes. I was already inhaling love, my throat was forming; and what a throat! white, firm, cut like that of the Venus de Medici; and what eyes! what eyelids! what black eyebrows! what flames shone in my two pupils, and effaced the scintillation of the stars, as the poets of the district told me. The women who dressed me and undressed me fell into ecstasy looking at me from the front and the back, and all the men wanted to be in their place.","I have not always been bleary-eyed; my nose did not always touch my chin; nor was I always a servant.

I grew up, and improved in beauty, wit, and every graceful accomplishment; and in the midst of pleasures, dignities and the highest expectations. I was already inspiring young men to love. My breast began to take its right form: and such a breast—white, firm, and formed like that of Venus of Medicis. My eyebrows were as black as jet; and as for my eyes, they darted flames, and eclipsed the lustre of the stars, as I was told by the poets of our part of the world. My maids, when they dressed and undressed me, used to fall into an ecstasy whether viewing me from in front or behind; and all the men longed to be in their places.","—My eyes were not always bloodshot and red-rimmed, my nose did not always touch my chin, and I was not born a servant.

I grew in beauty, in charm, in talent, surrounded by pleasures, dignities, and glowing visions of the future. Already I was inspiring the young men to love; my breast was formed—and what a breast! white, firm, with the shape of the Venus de Medici; and what eyes! what lashes, what black brows! What fire flashed from my glances and outshone the glitter of the stars, as the local poets used to tell me! The women who helped me dress and undress fell into ecstasies, whether they looked at me from in front or behind; and all the men wanted to be in their place."
"Candide, en s’en retournant avec son abbé périgourdin, sentit quelques remords d’avoir fait une infidélité à Mlle Cunégonde; monsieur l’abbé entra dans sa peine; il n’avait qu’une légère part aux cinquante mille livres perdues au jeu par Candide, et à la valeur des deux brillants moitié donnés, moitié extorqués. Son dessein était de profiter, autant qu’il le pourrait, des avantages que la connaissance de Candide pouvait lui procurer. Il lui parla beaucoup de Cunégonde; et Candide lui dit qu’il demanderait bien pardon à cette belle de son infidélité, quand il la verrait à Venise.","Candide, on returning home with his Perigordian abbot, felt some remorse at having been unfaithful to Mademoiselle Cunégonde; the abbé entered into his trouble; he had only a small share in the fifty thousand pounds lost at play by Candide, and in the value of the two brilliants, half given, half extorted. His design was to take advantage, as much as he could, of the advantages which the knowledge of Candide could procure for him. He spoke to her a great deal about Cunégonde; and Candide told him that he would ask forgiveness of this beauty for her infidelity when he saw her in Venice.","As Candide was going home with the Abbé he felt some remorse at having been unfaithful to Miss Cunégonde. The Abbé sympathized with him in his uneasiness. He had only a small share of the fifty thousand francs which Candide had lost at cards, and the two diamonds which had been in a manner extorted from him; and therefore very cunningly schemed to make the most that he could of his new acquaintance. He talked at length of Miss Cunégonde; and Candide assured him that he would beg forgiveness for his infidelity of that fair one when he saw her at Venice.","As he returned home with his Perigord abbé, Candide felt some remorse at having been unfaithful to Miss Cunégonde; the abbé sympathized with his grief; he had only a small share in the fifty thousand francs which Candide lost at cards, and in the proceeds of the two diamonds which had been half-given, half-extorted. His scheme was to profit, as much as he could, from the advantage of knowing Candide. He spoke at length of Cunégonde, and Candide told him that he would beg forgiveness from his beloved for his infidelity when he met her at Venice."
Chapitre 3,Chapter 3,III,CHAPTER 3
"— Pour moi, je n’ai nulle curiosité de voir la France, dit Candide; vous devinez aisément que, quand on a passé un mois dans Eldorado, on ne se soucie plus de rien voir sur la terre que Mlle Cunégonde; je vais l’attendre à Venise; nous traverserons la France pour aller en Italie; ne m’accompagnerez-vous pas? — Très volontiers, dit Martin; on dit que Venise n’est bonne que pour les nobles Vénitiens, mais que cependant on y reçoit très bien les étrangers quand ils ont beaucoup d’argent; je n’en ai point, vous en avez, je vous suivrai partout. — A propos, dit Candide, pensez-vous que la terre ait été originairement une mer, comme on l’assure dans ce gros livre qui appartient au capitaine du vaisseau? — Je n’en crois rien du tout, dit Martin, non plus que de toutes les rêveries qu’on nous débite depuis quelque temps. — Mais à quelle fin ce monde a-t-il donc été formé? dit Candide. — Pour nous faire enrager, répondit Martin. — N’êtes-vous pas bien étonné, continua Candide, de l’amour que ces deux filles du pays des Oreillons avaient pour ces deux singes, et dont je vous ai conté l’aventure? — Point du tout, dit Martin; je ne vois pas ce que cette passion a d’étrange; j’ai tant vu de choses extraordinaires, qu’il n’y a plus rien d’extraordinaire. — Croyez-vous, dit Candide, que les hommes se soient toujours mutuellement massacrés comme ils font aujourd’hui? qu’ils aient toujours été menteurs, fourbes, perfides, ingrats, brigands, faibles, volages, lâches, envieux, gourmands, ivrognes, avares, ambitieux, sanguinaires, calomniateurs, débauchés, fanatiques, hypocrites et sots? — Croyez-vous, dit Martin, que les éperviers aient toujours mangé des pigeons quand ils en ont trouvé? — Oui, sans doute, dit Candide. — Eh bien! dit Martin, si les éperviers ont toujours eu le même caractère, pourquoi voulez-vous que les hommes aient changé le leur? — Oh! dit Candide, il y a bien de la différence, car le libre arbitre… » En raisonnant ainsi, ils arrivèrent à Bordeaux.","""As for me, I have no curiosity to see France,"" said Candide; you can easily guess that, when one has spent a month in Eldorado, one no longer cares to see anything on earth but Miss Cunégonde; I will wait for him in Venice; we will cross France to go to Italy; won't you accompany me? "" Very willingly,"" said Martin; it is said that Venice is only good for noble Venetians, but that however foreigners are very well received there when they have a lot of money; I have none, you have none, I will follow you everywhere. ""By the way,"" said Candide, ""do you think that the earth was originally a sea, as is asserted in that big book which belongs to the captain of the vessel?"" ""I don't believe it at all,"" said Martin, ""nor of all the daydreams we've been told for some time. ""But for what end was this world formed?"" said Candide. ""To infuriate us,"" Martin replied. ""Aren't you very surprised,"" continued Candide, ""at the love that these two girls from the country of Oreillons had for these two monkeys, and whose adventure I have told you?"" ""Not at all,"" said Martin; I do not see what is strange about this passion; I have seen so many extraordinary things that there is nothing extraordinary left. ""Do you believe,"" said Candide, ""that men have always massacred one another as they do today?"" that they have always been liars, deceivers, perfidious, ungrateful, brigands, weak, fickle, cowards, envious, greedy, drunkards, avaricious, ambitious, bloodthirsty, slanderers, debauched, fanatics, hypocrites and fools? ""Do you believe,"" said Martin, ""that hawks have always eaten pigeons when they find them?"" ""Yes, no doubt,"" said Candide. - Well! said Martin, if hawks have always had the same character, why do you want men to have changed theirs? - Oh! said Candide, there is a lot of difference, because free will...” Reasoning thus, they arrived in Bordeaux.","“I myself have no curiosity to see France,” said Candide. “You no doubt realize that after spending a month at El Dorado, I desire to see nothing but Miss Cunégonde; I am going to wait for her at Venice. I intend to pass through France on my way to Italy; will you not accompany me?” “With all my heart,” said Martin. “They say Venice is good only for noble Venetians, but that, nevertheless, strangers are well treated there when they have plenty of money. Now I have none, but you have; therefore I will follow you anywhere. ”“By the way ,” said Candide, “do you think that the earth was originally sea, as we read in that great bookbd which belongs to the captain of the ship?” “I don’t believe any of that,” replied Martin, “any more than I do of the many other chimeras which people have been peddling for some time past.” “But then why,” said Candide, “was the world formed?” “To drive us mad,” said Martin. “Aren’t you surprised,” continued Candide, “at the love which the two girls in the country of the Oreillons had for those two monkeys ? You know I have told you the story.” “Surprised!” replied Martin, “not in the least; I see nothing strange in this passion. I have seen so many extraordinary things that there is nothing extraordinary to me now.” “Do you think,” said Candide, “that mankind always massacred each other as they do now? Were they always guilty of lies, fraud, treachery, ingratitude, inconstancy, envy, ambition, and cruelty? Were they always thieves, fools, cowards, gluttons, drunkards, misers, calumniators, debauchees, fanatics and hypocrites?” “Do you believe,” said Martin, “that hawks have always eaten pigeons when they could get them?” “Of course,” said Candide. “Well, then,” replied Martin, “if hawks have always had the same nature, why do you suppose that mankind has changed?” “Oh!” said Candide, “there is a great deal of difference; because free will—” And disputing in this manner they arrived at Bordeaux.","—I myself have no desire to visit France, said Candide; you no doubt realize that when one has spent a month in Eldorado, there is nothing else on earth one wants to see, except Miss Cunégonde. I am going to wait for her at Venice; we will cross France simply to get to Italy; wouldn’t you like to come with me? —Gladly, said Martin; they say Venice is good only for the Venetian nobles, but that on the other hand they treat foreigners very well when they have plenty of money. I don’t have any; you do, so I’ll follow you anywhere. —By the way, said Candide, do you believe the earth was originally all ocean, as they assure us in that big book68 belonging to the ship’s captain? —I don’t believe any of that stuff, said Martin, nor any of the dreams which people have been peddling for some time now. —But why, then, was this world formed at all? asked Candide. —To drive us mad, answered Martin. —Aren’t you astonished, Candide went on, at the love which those two girls showed for the monkeys in the land of the Biglugs that I told you about? —Not at all, said Martin, I see nothing strange in these sentiments; I have seen so many extraordinary things that nothing seems extraordinary any more. —Do you believe, asked Candide, that men have always massacred one another as they do today? That they have always been liars, traitors, ingrates, thieves, weaklings, sneaks, cowards, backbiters, gluttons, drunkards, misers, climbers, killers, calumniators, sensualists, fanatics, hypocrites, and fools? —Do you believe, said Martin, that hawks have always eaten pigeons when they could get them? —Of course, said Candide. —Well, said Martin, if hawks have always had the same character, why do you suppose that men have changed? —Oh, said Candide, there’s a great deal of difference, because freedom of the will … As they were disputing in this manner, they reached Bordeaux."
"Candide s’enfuit au plus vite dans un autre village: il appartenait à des Bulgares, et des héros abares l’avaient traité de même. Candide, toujours marchant sur des membres palpitants ou à travers des ruines, arriva enfin hors du théâtre de la guerre, portant quelques petites provisions dans son bissac, et n’oubliant jamais Mlle Cunégonde. Ses provisions lui manquèrent quand il fut en Hollande; mais ayant entendu dire que tout le monde était riche dans ce pays-là, et qu’on y était chrétien, il ne douta pas qu’on ne le traitât aussi bien qu’il l’avait été dans le château de monsieur le baron avant qu’il en eût été chassé pour les beaux yeux de Mlle Cunégonde.","Candide fled as quickly as possible to another village: it belonged to Bulgarians, and Abarian heroes had treated him in the same way. Candide, still marching on throbbing limbs or through ruins, arrived at last out of the theater of war, carrying a few small provisions in his wallet, and never forgetting Miss Cunégonde. His provisions failed him when he was in Holland; but having heard that everyone was rich in that country, and that they were Christians there, he had no doubt that they treated him as well as he had been in the castle of Monsieur le Baron. before he had been driven out for Miss Cunégonde's beautiful eyes.","Candide made haste to another village, which belonged to the Bulgarians, and there he found that the heroic Abares had enacted the same tragedy. From there, continuing to walk over palpitating limbs, or through ruined buildings, at length he arrived beyond the theatre of war, with a little provision in his budget and Miss Cunégonde’s image in his heart. When he arrived in Holland, his provisions ran out; but having heard that the inhabitants of that country were all rich and Christians, he made himself sure of being treated by them in the same manner as at the baron’s castle, before he had been driven from there through the power of Miss Cunégonde’s bright eyes.","Candide fled as fast as he could to another village; this one belonged to the Bulgars, and the heroes of the Abare cause had given it the same treatment. Climbing over ruins and stumbling over twitching torsos, Candide finally made his way out of the war area, carrying a little food in his knapsack and never ceasing to dream of Miss Cunégonde. His supplies gave out when he reached Holland; but having heard that everyone in that country was rich and a Christian, he felt confident of being treated as well as he had been in the castle of the Baron before he was kicked out for the love of Miss Cunégonde."
"Cacambo témoigna à son hôte toute sa curiosité; l’hôte lui dit: « Je suis fort ignorant, et je m’en trouve bien; mais nous avons ici un vieillard retiré de la cour, qui est le plus savant homme du royaume, et le plus communicatif. » Aussitôt il mène Cacambo chez le vieillard. Candide ne jouait plus que le second personnage, et accompagnait son valet. Ils entrèrent dans une maison fort simple, car la porte n’était que d’argent, et les lambris des appartements n’étaient que d’or, mais travaillés avec tant de goût que les plus riches lambris ne l’effaçaient pas. L’antichambre n’était à la vérité incrustée que de rubis et d’émeraudes; mais l’ordre dans lequel tout était arrangé réparait bien cette extrême simplicité.","Cacambo showed his host all his curiosity; the host said to him: “I am very ignorant, and I find myself well; but here we have an old man retired from the court, who is the most learned man in the kingdom, and the most communicative. Immediately he takes Cacambo to the old man. Candide now played only the second character, and accompanied his valet. They entered a very simple house, for the door was only silver, and the paneling of the apartments was only gold, but worked with such taste that the richest paneling did not efface it. The antechamber was, in truth, encrusted only with rubies and emeralds; but the order in which everything was arranged made up for this extreme simplicity.","Cacambo revealed all his curiosity to his host with a thousand different questions: the honest man answered him thus: “I am very ignorant, sir, but I am contented with my ignorance; however, we have in this neighbourhood an old man retired from Court, who is the most learned and communicative person in the kingdom.” He then brought Cacambo to the old man; Candide acted now only a secondary character, and attended his own valet. They entered a very plain house, for the door was nothing but silver, and the ceiling was only of beaten gold, but wrought in so elegant a taste as to vie with the richest. The ante-chamber, indeed, was only decorated with rubies and emeralds; but the order in which everything was arranged made amends for this great simplicity.","Cacambo revealed his curiosity to the host, and the host told him:—I am an ignorant man and content to remain so; but we have here an old man, retired from the court, who is the most knowing person in the kingdom, and the most talkative. Thereupon he brought Cacambo to the old man’s house. Candide now played second fiddle, and acted as servant to his own valet. They entered an austere little house, for the door was merely of silver and the paneling of the rooms was only gold, though so tastefully wrought that the finest paneling would not surpass it. If the truth must be told, the lobby was only decorated with rubies and emeralds; but the patterns in which they were arranged atoned for the extreme simplicity."
"« Voilà pourtant, dit Candide, un pays qui vaut mieux que la Vestphalie. » Il mit pied à terre avec Cacambo auprès du premier village qu’il rencontra. Quelques enfants du village, couverts de brocarts d’or tout déchirés, jouaient au palet à l’entrée du bourg; nos deux hommes de l’autre monde s’amusèrent à les regarder: leurs palets étaient d’assez larges pièces rondes, jaunes, rouges, vertes, qui jetaient un éclat singulier. Il prit envie aux voyageurs d’en ramasser quelques-uns; c’était de l’or, c’était des émeraudes, des rubis, dont le moindre aurait été le plus grand ornement du trône du Mogol. « Sans doute, dit Cacambo, ces enfants sont les fils du roi du pays qui jouent au petit palet. » Le magister du village parut dans ce moment pour les faire rentrer à l’école. « Voilà, dit Candide, le précepteur de la famille royale. »","""Here, however,"" said Candide, ""is a country which is worth more than Vestphalia."" He dismounted with Cacambo near the first village he came across. A few village children, covered in torn gold brocades, were playing shuffleboard at the entrance to the town; our two men from the other world amused themselves by looking at them: their pucks were quite large round pieces, yellow, red, green, which cast a singular brilliance. He made the travelers want to pick up some of them; it was gold, it was emeralds, rubies, the least of which would have been the greatest adornment of the Mogul throne. ""No doubt,"" said Cacambo, ""these children are the sons of the king of the country who play at small puck."" The village magister appeared at this moment to send them back to school. ""Here,"" said Candide, ""the tutor of the royal family."" »","“Here is a country,” said Candide, “that’s better than Westphalia.” He and Cacambo landed near the first village they saw, at the entrance of which they noticed some children, covered with tattered garments of the richest brocade, playing quoits. Our two inhabitants of the other hemisphere amused themselves greatly with what they saw. The quoits were large round pieces, yellow, red, and green, which cast a most glorious lustre. Our travellers picked some of them up, and they proved to be gold, emeralds, rubies and diamonds the least of which would have been the greatest ornament to the superb throne of the Great Mogul. “Without doubt,” said Cacambo, “those children who are playing quoits must be the king’s sons.” As he was uttering these words the schoolmaster of the village appeared, to call them back to school. “There,” said Candide, “is the tutor of the royal family.”","—Here now, said Candide, is a country that’s better than Westphalia. Along with Cacambo, he climbed out of the river at the first village he could see. Some children of the town, dressed in rags of gold brocade, were playing quoits at the village gate; our two men from the other world paused to watch them; their quoits were rather large, yellow, red, and green, and they glittered with a singular luster. On a whim, the travelers picked up several; they were of gold, emeralds, and rubies, and the least of them would have been the greatest ornament of the Grand Mogul’s throne. —Surely, said Cacambo, these quoit players are the children of the king of the country. The village schoolmaster appeared at that moment, to call them back to school. —And there, said Candide, is the tutor of the royal household."
Chapitre 16,Chapter 16,XVI,CHAPTER 16
"Un jour, Cunégonde, en se promenant auprès du château, dans le petit bois qu’on appelait parc, vit entre des broussailles le docteur Pangloss qui donnait une leçon de physique expérimentale à la femme de chambre de sa mère, petite brune très jolie et très docile. Comme Mlle Cunégonde avait beaucoup de dispositions pour les sciences, elle observa, sans souffler, les expériences réitérées dont elle fut témoin; elle vit clairement la raison suffisante du docteur, les effets et les causes, et s’en retourna tout agitée, toute pensive, toute remplie du désir d’être savante, songeant qu’elle pourrait bien être la raison suffisante du jeune Candide, qui pouvait aussi être la sienne.","One day, Cunégonde, while walking near the chateau, in the little wood they called a park, saw Doctor Pangloss among the brushwood, who was giving a lesson in experimental physics to her mother's maid, a very pretty, dark-haired little girl. very docile. As Mademoiselle Cunégonde had a great inclination for the sciences, she observed, without breathing, the repeated experiments which she witnessed; she saw clearly the sufficient reason of the doctor, the effects and the causes, and went back all agitated, all pensive, all filled with the desire to be learned, thinking that she might well be the sufficient reason of the young Candide, who could also be his.","One day when Miss Cunégonde went to take a walk in the little neighbouring woods, which was called a park, she saw through the bushes the sage Dr. Pangloss giving a lecture in experimental philosophy to her mother’s chambermaid, a little brown wench, very pretty and very tractable. As Miss Cunégonde had a natural disposition toward the sciences, she observed with the utmost attention the experiments which were repeated before her eyes; she perfectly well understood the force of the doctor’s reasoning upon causes and effects. She returned home greatly flurried, quite pensive and filled with the desire of knowledge, imagining that she might be a sufficing reason for young Candide, and he for her.","One day, while Cunégonde was walking near the castle in the little woods that they called a park, she saw Dr. Pangloss in the underbrush; he was giving a lesson in experimental physics to her mother’s maid, a very attractive and obedient brunette. As Miss Cunégonde had a natural bent for the sciences, she watched breathlessly the repeated experiments which were going on; she saw clearly the doctor’s sufficient reason, observed both cause and effect, and returned to the house in a distracted and pensive frame of mind, yearning for knowledge and dreaming that she might be the sufficient reason of young Candide—who might also be hers."
"Candide écouta ce propos avec attention, et conçut une grande idée du discoureur; et, comme la marquise avait eu soin de le placer à côté d’elle, il s’approcha de son oreille, et prit la liberté de lui demander qui était cet homme qui parlait si bien. « C’est un savant, dit la dame, qui ne ponte point, et que l’abbé m’amène quelquefois à souper; il se connaît parfaitement en tragédies et en livres, et il a fait une tragédie sifflée et un livre dont on n’a jamais vu hors de la boutique de son libraire qu’un exemplaire qu’il m’a dédié. — Le grand homme! dit Candide; c’est un autre Pangloss. »","Candide listened to this remark with attention, and conceived a great idea of the talker; and, as the marquise had taken care to place him beside her, he approached her ear, and took the liberty of asking her who this man was who spoke so well. “He is a scholar,” said the lady, “who does not lay eggs, and whom the abbé sometimes takes me to supper; he is perfectly conversant with tragedies and books, and he has written a hissed tragedy and a book of which no one has ever seen outside his bookseller's shop except a copy which he dedicated to me. ""The great man!"" said Candide; it's another Pangloss. »","Candide listened to this discourse with great attention, and formed a high opinion of the person who delivered it; and as the Marchioness had taken care to place him near her side, he took the liberty to whisper to her softly in the ear, and ask who this person was who spoke so well. “He is a man of letters,” replied her ladyship, “who never plays, and whom the Abbé brings to my house sometimes to spend an evening. He is a great judge of writing, especially in tragedy: he has written one himself, which was panned, and has written a book that was never seen out of his bookseller’s shop, except for one copy, which was dedicated to me.” “Oh, the great man!” cried Candide : “he is a second Pangloss.”","Candide listened attentively to this speech and conceived a high opinion of the speaker; and as the marquise had placed him by her side, he turned to ask her who was this man who spoke so well. —He is a scholar, said the lady, who never plays cards and whom the abbé sometimes brings to my house for supper; he knows all about tragedies and books, and has himself written a tragedy that was hissed from the stage and a book, the only copy of which ever seen outside his publisher’s office was dedicated to me. —What a great man, said Candide, he’s Pangloss all over."
"Cette lettre charmante, cette lettre inespérée, transporta Candide d’une joie inexprimable; et la maladie de sa chère Cunégonde l’accabla de douleur. Partagé entre ces deux sentiments, il prend son où et ses diamants, et se fait conduire avec Martin à l’hôtel où Mlle Cunégonde demeurait. Il entre en tremblant d’émotion, son coeur palpite, sa voix sanglote; il veut ouvrir les rideaux du lit, il veut faire apporter de la lumière. « Gardez-vous-en bien, lui dit la suivante, la lumière la tue; » et soudain elle referme le rideau. « Ma chère Cunégonde, dit Candide en pleurant, comment vous portez-vous? si vous ne pouvez me voir, parlez-moi du moins. — Elle ne peut parler, » dit la suivante. La dame alors tire du lit une main potelée que Candide arrose longtemps de ses larmes, et qu’il remplit ensuite de diamants, en laissant un sac plein d’or sur le fauteuil.","This charming letter, this unexpected letter, transported Candide with inexpressible joy; and the illness of his dear Cunégonde overwhelmed him with grief. Torn between these two feelings, he takes his where and his diamonds, and is driven with Martin to the hotel where Miss Cunégonde was staying. He enters trembling with emotion, his heart beating, his voice sobbing; he wants to open the curtains of the bed, he wants to bring in light. “Take good care of it,” said the attendant, “the light kills her; and suddenly she closes the curtain. ""My dear Cunégonde,"" said Candide, weeping, ""how are you?"" if you cannot see me, at least speak to me. ""She cannot speak,"" said the attendant. The lady then pulls from the bed a chubby hand which Candide wets for a long time with his tears, and which he then fills with diamonds, leaving a bag full of gold on the armchair.","This unexpected letter filled Candide with utmost joy; though on the other hand, the illness of his beloved Miss Cunégonde overwhelmed him with grief. Torn between these two feelings, he took his gold and his diamonds, and hired a person to conduct him and Martin to the house where Miss Cénogunde lodged. Upon entering the room he felt his limbs tremble, his heart flutter, his tongue falter. He attempted to open the curtain, and asked for some light. “Lord, sir,” cried a maid-servant, who was waiting in the room, “be careful; light will be the death of her.” And so saying, she pulled the curtains closed again. “Cunégonde! my dear Cunégonde!” cried Candide, bathed in tears , “how are you? If you can’t see me, at least speak to me.” “Alas! she cannot speak,” said the maid. The sick lady then put a plump hand out of the bed, and Candide first bathed it with his tears, then filled it with diamonds, leaving a purse of gold upon the chair.","This charming letter, coming so unexpectedly, filled Candide with inexpressible delight, while the illness of his dear Cunégonde covered him with grief. Torn between these two feelings, he took gold and diamonds, and had himself brought, with Martin, to the hotel where Miss Cunégonde was lodging. Trembling with emotion, he enters the room; his heart thumps, his voice breaks. He tries to open the curtains of the bed, he asks to have some lights. —Absolutely forbidden, says the serving girl; light will be the death of her. And abruptly she pulls shut the curtain. —My dear Cunégonde, says Candide in tears, how are you feeling? If you can’t see me, won’t you at least speak to me? —She can’t talk, says the servant. But then she draws forth from the bed a plump hand, over which Candide weeps a long time, and which he fills with diamonds, meanwhile leaving a bag of gold on the chair."

"Tous les domestiques ayant disparu, les six étrangers, Candide et Martin demeurèrent dans un profond silence. Enfin Candide le rompit. « Messieurs, dit-il, voilà une singulière plaisanterie: pourquoi êtes-vous tous rois? Pour moi, je vous avoue que ni moi ni Martin nous ne le sommes. »","All the servants having disappeared, the six strangers, Candide and Martin remained in profound silence. Finally Candide broke it. “Gentlemen,” he said, “here is a singular joke: why are you all kings? For me, I confess that neither I nor Martin are. »","With the servants all gone, the six strangers, with Candide and Martin, remained in a profound silence. Finally Candide broke it by saying, “Gentlemen, this is a very singular joke, upon my word; why, how came you all to be kings? For my part I assure you that neither my friend Martin here nor myself have any claim to royalty.”","When all the servants had left, the six strangers, Candide, and Martin remained under a pall of silence. Finally Candide broke it. —Gentlemen, said he, here’s a strange kind of joke. Why are you all royalty? I assure you that Martin and I aren’t."
"En causant ainsi ils abordèrent à Portsmouth; une multitude de peuple couvrait le rivage, et regardait attentivement un assez gros homme qui était à genoux, les yeux bandés, sur le tillac d’un des vaisseaux de la flotte; quatre soldats, postés vis-à-vis de cet homme, lui tirèrent chacun trois balles dans le crâne le plus paisiblement du monde, et toute l’assemblée s’en retourna extrêmement satisfaite. « Qu’est-ce donc que tout ceci? dit Candide, et quel démon exerce partout son empire? » Il demanda qui était ce gros homme qu’on venait de tuer en cérémonie. « C’est un amiral, lui répondit-on. — Et pourquoi tuer cet amiral? — C’est, lui dit-on, parce qu’il n’a pas fait tuer assez de monde; il a livré un combat à un amiral français, et on a trouvé qu’il n’était pas assez près de lui. — Mais, dit Candide, l’amiral français était aussi loin de l’amiral anglais que celui-ci l’était de l’autre! — Cela est incontestable, lui répliqua-t-on; mais dans ce pays-ci il est bon de tuer de temps en temps un amiral pour encourager les autres. »","Talking thus, they landed at Portsmouth; a multitude of people covered the shore, and gazed attentively at a fairly large man who was kneeling, blindfolded, on the deck of one of the vessels of the fleet; four soldiers, posted opposite this man, each fired three bullets into his skull in the most peaceful way possible, and the whole assembly went away extremely satisfied. “So what is all this? said Candide, and what demon exercises his sway everywhere? He asked who was this big man who had just been killed in ceremony. ""He's an admiral,"" they answered. ""And why kill this admiral?"" 'It's,' he was told, 'because he didn't have enough people killed; he fought a French admiral, and it was found that he was not close enough to him. ""But,"" said Candide, ""the French admiral was as far from the English admiral as the latter was from the other!"" ""That is indisputable,"" they replied to him; but in this country it is well to kill an admiral from time to time to encourage the others. »","As they were chatting thus together they arrived at Portsmouth. The shore on each side the harbour was lined with a multitude of people, whose eyes were steadfastly fixed on a big man who was kneeling down on the deck of one of the men-of-war with something tied over his eyes. In front of this man stood four soldiers, each of whom shot three bullets into his skull with full composure; and when it was done the crowds went away perfectly well satisfied. 26 “What is all this about?” said Candide; “and what demon is everywhere at work?” He then asked who was that big man who had just been killed with so much ceremony, when he received for answer that it was an admiral. “And why do you put your admiral to death?” “Because he did not put a sufficient number of people to death. You must know, he battled against French admiral, and it has been proved that he was not near enough to his antagonist.” “But,” replied Candide, “the French admiral must have been as far from the English admiral as the English admiral was from the French.” “There is no doubt about that; but in this country it is necessary. now and then, to put one admiral to death in order to inspire the others to fight.”","As they chatted thus, the vessel touched at Portsmouth. A multitude of people covered the shore, watching closely a rather bulky man who was kneeling, his eyes blindfolded, on the deck of a man-of-war. Four soldiers, stationed directly in front of this man, fired three bullets apiece into his brain, as peaceably as you would want; and the whole assemblage went home, in great satisfaction.88 —What’s all this about? asked Candide. What devil is everywhere at work? He asked who was that big man who had just been killed with so much ceremony. —It was an admiral, they told him. —And why kill this admiral? —The reason, they told him, is that he didn’t kill enough people; he gave battle to a French admiral, and it was found that he didn’t get close enough to him. —But, said Candide, the French admiral was just as far from the English admiral as the English admiral was from the French admiral. —That’s perfectly true, came the answer; but in this country it is useful from time to time to kill one admiral in order to encourage the others."
"« Oh! oh! dit à part soi le prudent Vanderdendur, cet étranger donne dix mille piastres tout d’un coup! il faut qu’il soit bien riche. » Puis, revenant un moment après, il signifia qu’il ne pouvait partir à moins de vingt mille. « Eh bien! vous les aurez », dit Candide.",""" Oh! Oh! said the prudent Vanderdendur to himself, ""this stranger is giving ten thousand piastres all at once!"" he must be very rich. Then, returning a moment later, he signified that he could not leave for less than twenty thousand. "" Well! you will have them,” says Candide.","“Ho, ho!” said the cunning Vanderdendur to himself, “this stranger must be very rich; he agrees to give me ten thousand piastres without hesitation.” Returning a little while later, he told Candide that, upon second consideration he could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty thousand. “Very well, you shall have them,” said Candide.","—Oh ho, said the prudent Vanderdendur to himself, this stranger pays out ten thousand piastres at once, he must be pretty well fixed. Then, returning a moment later, he made known that he could not set sail under twenty thousand. —All right, you shall have them, said Candide."

"Le cinquième dit: « Je suis aussi roi des Polaques; j’ai perdu mon royaume deux fois; mais la Providence m’a donné un autre État, dans lequel j’ai fait plus de bien que tous les rois des Sarmates ensemble n’en ont jamais pu faire sur les bords de la Vistule; je me résigne aussi à la Providence, et je suis venu passer le carnaval à Venise. »","The fifth said: “I am also king of the Polachs; I have lost my kingdom twice; but Providence has given me another State, in which I have done more good than all the kings of the Sarmatians together have ever been able to do on the banks of the Vistula; I also resign myself to Providence, and I have come to spend the carnival in Venice. »","The fifth said: “I am King of Poland also.ch I have twice lost my kingdom; but Providence has given me other dominions, where I have done more good than all the Sarmatian kings put together ever managed to do on the banks of the Vistula. I resign myself likewise to Providence; and am here to spend the Carnival at Venice.”","The fifth said: —I too am a king of the Poles;104 I lost my kingdom twice, but Providence gave me another state, in which I have been able to do more good than all the Sarmatian kings ever managed to do on the banks of the Vistula. I too have submitted to Providence, and I have come to pass the carnival season at Venice."
"Au nom du baron et de Pangloss les deux forçats poussèrent un grand cri, s’arrêtèrent sur leur banc et laissèrent tomber leurs rames. Le levanti patron accourait sur eux, et les coups de nerf de boeuf redoublaient. « Arrêtez, arrêtez, Seigneur, s’écria Candide, je vous donnerai tant d’argent que vous voudrez. — Quoi! c’est Candide! disait l’un des forçats. — Quoi! c’est Candide! disait l’autre. — Est-ce un songe? dit Candide; veillé-je? suis-je dans cette galère? Est-ce là monsieur le baron que j’ai tué? Est-ce là maître Pangloss que j’ai vu pendre?","At the name of the Baron and of Pangloss the two convicts uttered a loud cry, stopped on their bench and dropped their oars. The levanti boss came running towards them, and the blows of blackjack redoubled. ""Stop, stop, Lord,"" exclaimed Candide, ""I'll give you as much money as you want. - What! it's Candid! said one of the convicts. - What! it's Candid! said the other. ""Is it a dream?"" said Candide; am I watching? am I in this mess? Is this Monsieur le Baron whom I killed? Is that Master Pangloss I saw hanging?","No sooner had Candide uttered the names of the Baron and Pangloss than the two slaves gave a great cry, ceased rowing, and dropped their oars from their hands. The master of the vessel seeing this, ran up to them, and redoubled the discipline of the bullwhip. “Stop, stop,” cried Candide, “I will give you as much money as you want.” “Good heavens! it is Candide,” said one of the men. “Candide !” cried the other. “Do I dream?” said Candide, “or am I awake? Am I actually on board this galley? Is this my Lord Baron whom I killed? and that my Master Pangloss, whom I saw hanged?”","At the names of ‘baron’ and ‘Pangloss’ the two convicts gave a great cry, sat still on their bench, and dropped their oars. The Levantine captain came running, and the bullwhip lashes redoubled. —Stop, stop, captain, cried Candide. I’ll give you as much money as you want. —What, can it be Candide? cried one of the convicts. —What, can it be Candide? cried the other. —Is this a dream? said Candide. Am I awake or asleep? Am I in this galley? Is that my lord the Baron, whom I killed? Is that Master Pangloss, whom I saw hanged?"
"« Sainte Vierge! s’écria-t-elle, qu’allons-nous devenir? Un homme tué chez moi! si la justice vient, nous sommes perdus. — Si Pangloss n’avait pas été pendu, dit Candide, il nous donnerait un bon conseil dans cette extrémité, car c’était un grand philosophe. A son défaut consultons la vieille. » Elle était fort prudente, et commençait à dire son avis, quand une autre petite porte s’ouvrit. Il était une heure après minuit, c’était le commencement du dimanche. Ce jour appartenait à monseigneur l’inquisiteur. Il entre et voit le fessé Candide l’épée à la main, un mort étendu par terre, Cunégonde effarée, et la vieille donnant des conseils.",""" Holy Virgin! she exclaimed, what will become of us? A man killed in my house! if justice comes, we are lost. ""If Pangloss had not been hanged,"" said Candide, ""he would give us good advice in this extremity, for he was a great philosopher. Failing that, let's consult the old woman. She was very cautious, and was beginning to speak her mind, when another little door opened. It was one hour after midnight, it was the beginning of Sunday. This day belonged to Monsignor the Inquisitor. He enters and sees the spanked Candide, sword in hand, a corpse stretched out on the ground, Cunégonde terrified, and the old woman giving advice.","“Holy Virgin!” cried she, “what will become of us? A man killed in my apartment! If the police come we are done for.” “Had not Pangloss been hanged,” replied Candide, “he would have given us most excellent advice in this emergency, for he was a profound philosopher. But since he is not here let us consult the old woman.” She was very understanding, and was beginning to give her advice, when another door opened suddenly. It was now one o’clock in the morning, and of course the beginning of Sunday, which, by agreement, belonged to my Lord Inquisitor. Entering, he discovered the whipped Candide, with his drawn sword in his hand, a dead body stretched on the floor, Cunégonde frightened out of her wits, and the old woman giving advice. At that very moment thought came into Candide’s head.","—Holy Virgin! she cried. What will become of me now? A man killed in my house! If the police find out, we’re done for. —If Pangloss had not been hanged, said Candide, he would give us good advice in this hour of need, for he was a great philosopher. Lacking him, let’s ask the old woman. She was a sensible body, and was just starting to give her opinion of the situation, when another little door opened. It was just one o’clock in the morning, Sunday morning. This day belonged to the inquisitor. In he came, and found the whipped Candide with a sword in his hand, a corpse at his feet, Cunégonde in terror, and an old woman giving them both good advice."
"Plutôt que de s’exposer aux procédures de la justice, Candide, éclairé par son conseil, et d’ailleurs toujours impatient de revoir la véritable Cunégonde, propose à l’exempt trois petits diamants d’environ trois mille pistoles chacun. « Ah! monsieur, lui dit l’homme au bâton d’ivoire, eussiez-vous commis tous les crimes imaginables, vous êtes le plus honnête homme du monde; trois diamants! chacun de trois mille pistoles! Monsieur! je me ferais tuer pour vous, au lieu de vous mener dans un cachot. On arrête tous les étrangers, mais laissez-moi faire; j’ai un frère à Dieppe en Normandie, je vais vous y mener; et si vous avez quelque diamant à lui donner, il aura soin de vous comme moi-même.","Rather than exposing himself to legal proceedings, Candide, enlightened by his counsel, and moreover always impatient to see the real Cunégonde again, offers the exemption three small diamonds of about three thousand pistoles each. “Oh! sir, said the man with the ivory stick, had you committed all imaginable crimes, you are the most honest man in the world; three diamonds! each of three thousand pistoles! Sir! I would have myself killed for you, instead of leading you to a dungeon. We arrest all foreigners, but leave it to me; I have a brother in Dieppe in Normandy, I will take you there; and if you have a diamond to give him, he will take care of you as I do.","Candide, following the advice of his friend Martin, and burning with impatience to see the real Miss Cunégonde, rather than have to appear at a court of justice, offered the officer three small diamonds, each of them worth three thousand pistoles. “Ah, sir,” said this man, “even if you had committed every crime imaginable, this would render you the most honest man in my eyes. Three diamonds worth three thousand pistoles! Why, my dear sir, rather than take you to jail, I would die for you. All foreigners get arrested here, but let me manage things. I have a brother at Dieppe, in Normandy. I myself will take you there, and if you have a diamond left to give him, he will take care of you as I myself would.”","Rather than submit to the forms of justice, Candide, enlightened by Martin’s advice and eager for his own part to see the real Cunégonde again, offered the bailiff three little diamonds worth about three thousand pistoles apiece. —Ah, my dear sir! cried the man with the ivory staff, even if you have committed every crime imaginable, you are the most honest man in the world. Three diamonds! each one worth three thousand pistoles! My dear sir! I would gladly die for you, rather than take you to jail. All foreigners get arrested here; but let me manage it; I have a brother at Dieppe in Normandy; I’ll take you to him; and if you have a bit of a diamond to give him, he’ll take care of you, just like me."
Chapitre 6,Chapter 6,VI,CHAPTER 6
"A peine ont-ils mis le pied dans la ville en pleurant la mort de leur bienfaiteur, qu’ils sentent la terre trembler sous leurs pas; la mer s’élève en bouillonnant dans le port, et brise les vaisseaux qui sont à l’ancre. Des tourbillons de flammes et de cendres couvrent les rues et les places publiques; les maisons s’écroulent, les toits sont renversés sur les fondements, et les fondements se dispersent; trente mille habitants de tout âge et de tout sexe sont écrasés sous des ruines, Le matelot disait en sifflant et en jurant: « Il y aura quelque chose à gagner ici. — Quelle peut être la raison suffisante de ce phénomène? disait Pangloss. — Voici le dernier jour du monde! » s’écriait Candide. Le matelot court incontinent au milieu des débris, affronte la mort pour trouver de l’argent, en trouve, s’en empare, s’enivre, et, ayant cuvé son vin, achète les faveurs de la première fille de bonne volonté qu’il rencontre sur les ruines des maisons détruites et au milieu des mourants et des morts. Pangloss le tirait cependant par la manche. « Mon ami, lui disait-il, cela n’est pas bien, vous manquez à la raison universelle, vous prenez mal votre temps. — Tête et sang! répondit l’autre, je suis matelot et né à Batavia; j’ai marché quatre fois sur le crucifix dans quatre voyages au Japon; tu as bien trouvé ton homme avec ta raison universelle! »","No sooner have they set foot in the city mourning the death of their benefactor than they feel the earth tremble under their feet; the sea rises and boils in the port, and breaks the ships that are at anchor. Whirlwinds of flames and ashes cover the streets and public squares; the houses crumble, the roofs are knocked down on the foundations, and the foundations scatter; thirty thousand inhabitants of all ages and all sexes are crushed under ruins, The sailor said, whistling and swearing: ""There will be something to be gained here."" — What can be the sufficient reason for this phenomenon? said Pangloss. — This is the last day of the world! exclaimed Candide. The sailor runs immediately amidst the debris, faces death to find money, finds it, seizes it, gets drunk, and, having slept off his wine, buys the favors of the first willing girl whom he finds destroyed houses on the ruins and in the midst of the dying and the dead. Pangloss, however, pulled him by the sleeve. ""My friend,"" he said to him, ""that is not good, you fail universal reason, you are taking your time badly. ""Head and blood!"" answered the other, I am a sailor and born in Batavia; I walked on the crucifix four times in four trips to Japan; you have found your man with your universal reason! »","Scarcely had they finished lamenting the loss of their benefactor and set foot in the city, when they felt the earth tremble under their feet, and the sea, swelling and foaming in the harbour, dash in pieces the vessels that were anchored. Large sheets of flame and cinders covered the streets and public places. The houses tottered, and were tumbled, even to their foundations, which were themselves destroyed; and thirty thousand inhabitants of both sexes, young and old, were buried beneath the ruins.5 The sailor, whistling and swearing, cried: “Damn it , there’s something to be got here!” “What can be the ‘sufficient reason’ of this phenomenon?” said Pangloss. “It is certainly the Day of Judgment,” said Candide. The sailor, defying death in the pursuit of plunder, rushed into the midst of the ruin, where he found some money, with which he got drunk, and after he had slept off the alcohol, he purchased the favours of the first good-natured wench that came his way, amidst the ruins of demolished houses and the groans of half-buried and expiring persons. Pangloss pulled him by the sleeve: “Friend,” said he, “this is not right; you trespass against the universal reason, and your behavior is untimely.” “Bloody Hell!” answered the other, “I am a sailor and born at Batavia, and have trampled four times upon the crucifix in as many voyages to Japan;6 get out of here with your universal reason.”","Scarcely had they set foot in the town, still bewailing the loss of their benefactor, when they felt the earth quake underfoot; the sea was lashed to a froth, burst into the port, and smashed all the vessels lying at anchor there. Whirlwinds of fire and ash swirled through the streets and public squares; houses crumbled, roofs came crashing down on foundations, foundations split; thirty thousand inhabitants of every age and either sex were crushed in the ruins.19 The sailor whistled through his teeth, and said with an oath: —There’ll be something to pick up here. —What can be the sufficient reason of this phenomenon? asked Pangloss. —The Last Judgment is here, cried Candide. But the sailor ran directly into the middle of the ruins, heedless of danger in his eagerness for gain; he found some money, laid violent hands on it, got drunk, and, having slept off his wine, bought the favors of the first streetwalker he could find amid the ruins of smashed houses, amid corpses and suffering victims on every hand. Pangloss however tugged at his sleeve. —My friend, said he, this is not good form at all; your behavior falls short of that required by the universal reason; it’s untimely, to say the least. —Bloody hell, said the other, I’m a sailor, born in Batavia; I’ve been four times to Japan and stamped four times on the crucifix;20 get out of here with your universal reason."
"Quand ils furent aux frontières des Oreillons: « Vous voyez, dit Cacambo à Candide, que cet hémisphère-ci ne vaut pas mieux que l’autre: croyez-moi, retournons en Europe par le plus court. — Comment y retourner? dit Candide, et où aller? si je vais dans mon pays, les Bulgares et les Abares y égorgent tout; si je retourne en Portugal, j’y suis brûlé; si nous restons dans ce pays-ci, nous risquons à tout moment d’être mis en broche. Mais comment se résoudre à quitter la partie du monde que Mlle Cunégonde habite?","When they were at the borders of the Oreillons: ""You see,"" said Cacambo to Candide, ""that this hemisphere is no better than the other: believe me, let's return to Europe by the shortest route. ""How to get back there?"" said Candide, and where to go? if I go to my country, the Bulgarians and the Abarians slaughter everything there; if I return to Portugal, I am burned there; if we stay in this country, we risk being skewered at any moment. But how to resolve to leave the part of the world where Miss Cunégonde lives?","When they got to the frontier of the Oreillons, “You see,” said Cacambo to Candide, “this hemisphere is not better than the other; take my advice, and let’s return to Europe by the shortest possible way.” “But how can we get back,” said Candide, “and where shall we go? To my own country? The Bulgarians and the Abares are slitting everyone’s throat; or shall we go to Portugal? There I will be burnt; if we stay here, we are always in danger of being spitted. But how can I bring myself to leave that part of the world where my dear Miss Cunégonde lives?”","When they were out of the land of the Biglugs, Cacambo said to Candide: —You see that this hemisphere is no better than the other; take my advice, and let’s get back to Europe as soon as possible. —How to get back, asked Candide, and where to go? If I go to my own land, the Bulgars and Abares are murdering everyone in sight; if I go to Portugal, they’ll burn me alive; if we stay here, we risk being skewered any day. But how can I ever leave this part of the world where Miss Cunégonde lives?"
"— Jamais, répondit la baronne.","""Never,"" replied the Baroness.","“Never,” answered the young baroness.","—Never, replied the baroness."
"Les convives étaient pour la plupart des marchands et des voituriers, tous d’une politesse extrême, qui firent quelques questions à Cacambo avec la discrétion la plus circonspecte, et qui répondirent aux siennes d’une manière à le satisfaire.","The guests were for the most part merchants and carriers, all extremely polite, who put a few questions to Cacambo with the most circumspect discretion, and who answered his in a manner to satisfy him.","Most of the company were merchants and waggoners, all extremely polite; they asked Cacambo a few questions with the utmost discretion and circumspection; and replied to him in a most obliging and satisfactory manner.","The diners were for the most part merchants and travelers, all extremely polite, who questioned Cacambo with the most discreet circumspection, and answered his questions very directly."
"Candide n’en voulut pas davantage; il avoua que Martin avait raison. On se mit à table avec Paquette et le théatin, le repas fut assez amusant, et sur la fin on se parla avec quelque confiance. « Mon Père, dit Candide au moine, vous me paraissez jouir d’une destinée que tout le monde doit envier; la fleur de la santé brille sur votre visage, votre physionomie annonce le bonheur; vous avez une très jolie fille pour votre récréation, et vous paraissez très content de votre état de théatin.","Candide wanted no more; he admitted that Martin was right. We sat down to table with Paquette and the theatin, the meal was quite amusing, and at the end we talked to each other with some confidence. “My Father,” said Candide to the monk, “you seem to me to enjoy a destiny that everyone must envy; the flower of health shines on your face, your countenance announces happiness; you have a very pretty daughter for your recreation, and you seem very pleased with your state of theatin.","Candide was convinced, and acknowledged that Martin was right. They sat down to dinner with Pacquette and the Theatin; the meal was very agreeable, and towards the end they began to speak freely among themselves. “Father,” said Candide to the friar, “you seem to me to enjoy a state of happiness that even kings might envy; joy and health are painted on your countenance. You have a beautiful friend to divert you; and you seem to be perfectly well contented with your condition as a Theatin.”","Candide wanted no more; he conceded that Martin was right. They sat down to table with Paquette and the Theatine; the meal was agreeable enough, and when it was over, the company spoke out among themselves with some frankness. —Father, said Candide to the monk, you seem to me a man whom all the world might envy; the flower of health glows in your cheek, your features radiate pleasure; you have a pretty girl for your diversion, and you seem very happy with your life as a Theatine."
"Aussitôt il les aborde, il leur fait son compliment, et les invite à venir à son hôtellerie manger des macaronis, des perdrix de Lombardie, des oeufs d’esturgeon, et à boire du vin de Montepulciano, du lacrima-christi, du chypre et du samos. La demoiselle rougit, le théatin accepta la partie, et la fille le suivit en regardant Candide avec des yeux de surprise et de confusion qui furent obscurcis de quelques larmes. A peine fut-elle entrée dans la chambre de Candide qu’elle lui dit: « Eh quoi! monsieur Candide ne reconnaît plus Paquette! » A ces mots, Candide, qui ne l’avait pas considérée jusque-là avec attention, parce qu’il n’était occupé que de Cunégonde, lui dit: « Hélas! ma pauvre enfant, c’est donc vous qui avez mis le docteur Pangloss dans le bel état où je l’ai vu?","As soon as he approaches them, he pays them his compliment, and invites them to come to his hostelry to eat macaroni, Lombardy partridges, sturgeon eggs, and to drink wine from Montepulciano, lacrima-christi, chypre and samos. The damsel blushed, the Theatine accepted the part, and the girl followed him, looking at Candide with eyes of surprise and confusion that were darkened with a few tears. No sooner had she entered Candide's room than she said to him: ""What! Monsieur Candide no longer recognizes Paquette! At these words, Candide, who had not considered her with attention until then, because he was only occupied with Cunégonde, said to her: “Alas! my poor child, it is then you who put Doctor Pangloss in the beautiful state in which I saw him?","He approached them, and with great politeness invited them to his inn to eat some macaroni, with Lombard partridges and caviare, and to drink a bottle of Montepulciano, Lacryma Christi, Cyprus and Samos wine. The girl blushed; the Theatin accepted the invitation, and she followed him, eyeing Candide every now and then with a mixture of surprise and confusion, while the tears stole down her cheeks. No sooner did she enter his apartment than she cried out: “ Mr. Candide, have you quite forgotten your Pacquette? Do you not recognize her again?” Candide, who had not looked carefully at her before, being wholly preoccupied with the thoughts of his dear Cunégonde. “Ah! is it you, child? Was it you that reduced Doctor Pangloss to that fine condition","Promptly he approached them, made his compliments, and invited them to his inn for a meal of macaroni, Lombardy partridges, and caviar, washed down with wine from Montepulciano, Cyprus, and Sarnos, and some Lacrima Christi. The girl blushed but the Theatine accepted gladly, and the girl followed him, watching Candide with an expression of surprise and confusion, darkened by several tears. Scarcely had she entered the room when she said to Candide : —What, can it be that Master Candide no longer knows Paquette? At these words Candide, who had not yet looked carefully at her because he was preoccupied with Cunégonde, said to her: — Ah, my poor child! so you are the one who put Doctor Pangloss in the fine fix where I last saw him."

"Le maître de Cacambo prit alors gravement la parole, et dit en italien: « Je ne suis point plaisant, je m’appelle Achmet III. J’ai été grand sultan plusieurs années; je détrônai mon frère; mon neveu m’a détrôné; on a coupé le cou à mes vizirs; j’achève ma vie dans le vieux sérail; mon neveu le grand sultan Mahmoud me permet de voyager quelquefois pour ma santé, et je suis venu passer le carnaval à Venise. »","The master of Cacambo then spoke gravely, and said in Italian: “I am not joking, my name is Achmet III. I was Grand Sultan for several years; I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me; they cut off the necks of my viziers; I end my life in the old seraglio; my nephew the great Sultan Mahmoud allows me to travel sometimes for my health, and I came to spend the carnival in Venice. »","Cacambo’s master then began, with great gravity, to speak in Italian: “I am not joking in the least. My name is Achmet III.cd I was grand seignor for many years; I dethroned my brother, my nephew dethroned me, my viziers lost their heads, and I am condemned to end my days in the old seraglio. My nephew, the Grand Sultan Mahomet, gives me permission to travel sometimes for my health, and I am here to spend the Carnival at Venice.”","Cacambo’s master spoke up gravely then, and said in Italian: — This is no joke, my name is Achmet the Third.100 I was grand sultan for several years; then, as I had dethroned my brother, my nephew dethroned me. My viziers had their throats cut; I was allowed to end my days in the old seraglio. My nephew, the Grand Sultan Mahmoud, sometimes lets me travel for my health; and I have come to spend the carnival season at Venice."

"Candide resta encore quelque temps à Surinam, et attendit qu’un autre patron voulût le mener en Italie, lui et les deux moutons qui lui restaient. Il prit des domestiques, et acheta tout ce qui lui était nécessaire pour un long voyage; enfin M. Vanderdendur, maître d’un gros vaisseau, vint se présenter à lui. « Combien voulez-vous, demanda-t-il à cet homme, pour me mener en droiture à Venise, moi, mes gens, mon bagage, et les deux moutons que voilà? » Le patron s’accorda à dix mille piastres. Candide n’hésita pas.","Candide remained some time longer in Surinam, and waited until another patron wanted to take him and the two sheep he had left to Italy. He took servants, and bought all that he needed for a long journey; finally Mr. Vanderdendur, master of a large vessel, came to present himself to him. ""How much do you want,"" he asked this man, ""to lead me straight to Venice, me, my people, my luggage, and the two sheep here?"" The boss agreed to ten thousand piastres. Candide did not hesitate.","Candide continued some days longer at Surinam, waiting for any captain to carry him and his two remaining sheep to Italy. He hired domestics, and purchased many things necessary for the long voyage ; finally, Mynheer Vanderdendur, skipper of a large Dutch vessel, came and offered his service. “What will you charge,” said Candide, “to carry me, my servants, my baggage, and these two sheep you see here, directly to Venice?” The skipper asked for ten thousand piastres; and Candide agreed to his demand without hesitation.","Candide remained for some time in Surinam, waiting for another merchant to take him to Italy, along with the two sheep which were left him. He hired servants and bought everything necessary for the long voyage; finally Mr. Vanderdendur, master of a big ship, came calling. —How much will you charge, Candide asked this man, to take me to Venice—myself, my servants, my luggage, and those two sheep over there? The merchant set a price of ten thousand piastres; Candide did not blink an eye."
"— Et pourquoi arrête-t-on tous les étrangers? » dit Candide. L’abbé périgourdin prit alors la parole et dit: « C’est parce qu’un gueux du pays d’Atrébatie a entendu dire des sottises: cela seul lui a fait commettre un parricide, non pas tel que celui de 1610 au mois de mai, mais tel que celui de 1594 au mois de décembre, et tel que plusieurs autres commis dans d’autres années et dans d’autres mois par d’autres gueux qui avaient entendu dire des sottises. »","""And why are all foreigners arrested?"" said Candide. The Périgord abbot then took the floor and said: ""It is because a beggar from the country of Atrébatie heard some nonsense: that alone made him commit a parricide, not such as that of 1610 in the month of May, but like that of 1594 in the month of December, and like several others committed in other years and in other months by other beggars who had heard nonsense. »","“But why,” said Candide, “do they arrest all foreigners?” The Abbé of Perigord spoke up and said that it was because a beggar from Atrebatabo heard somebody tell foolish stories, and this induced him to commit a parricide; not like the one in the month of May, 1610, but like the one in the month of December in 1594,24 and much on the order of several that had been committed in other months and years by other poor devils who had heard foolish stories.","—And why do they arrest all foreigners? asked Candide. The abbé from Perigord spoke up and said: — It’s because a beggar from Atrebatum listened to some stupidities; that made him commit a parricide, not like the one of May, 1610, but like the one of December, 1594, much on the order of several other crimes committed in other years and other months by other beggars who had listened to stupidities.85"
"« Eh bien! dit Martin, voilà comme les hommes se traitent les uns les autres. — Il est vrai, dit Candide, qu’il y a quelque chose de diabolique dans cette affaire. » En parlant ainsi, il aperçut je ne sais quoi d’un rouge éclatant qui nageait auprès de son vaisseau. On détacha la chaloupe pour voir ce que ce pouvait être: c’était un de ses moutons. Candide eut plus de joie de retrouver ce mouton qu’il n’avait été affligé d’en perdre cent tous chargés de gros diamants d’Eldorado. Le capitaine français aperçut bientôt que le capitaine du vaisseau submergeant était espagnol, et que celui du vaisseau submergé était un pirate hollandais; c’était celui-là même qui avait volé Candide. Les richesses immenses dont ce scélérat s’était emparé furent ensevelies avec lui dans la mer, et il n’y eut qu’un mouton de sauvé. « Vous voyez, dit Candide à Martin, que le crime est puni quelquefois: ce coquin de patron hollandais a eu le sort qu’il méritait. — Oui, dit Martin, mais fallait-il que les passagers qui étaient sur son vaisseau périssent aussi? Dieu a puni ce fripon, le diable a noyé les autres. »",""" Well! said Martin, that's how men treat each other. ""It is true,"" said Candide, ""that there is something diabolical in this affair. So saying, he saw something of a brilliant red swimming by his ship. They untied the boat to see what it could be: it was one of his sheep. Candide was more delighted to find this sheep than he had been distressed to lose a hundred of them, all laden with large diamonds from Eldorado. The French captain soon perceived that the captain of the sinking vessel was Spanish, and that of the sunken vessel was a Dutch pirate; it was he who had robbed Candide. The immense riches which this villain had seized were buried with him in the sea, and only one sheep was saved. ""You see,"" said Candide to Martin, ""that crime is sometimes punished: that rascal of a Dutch boss got the fate he deserved. ""Yes,"" said Martin, ""but did the passengers who were on his ship have to perish too?"" God punished this rascal, the devil drowned the others. »","“Well,” said Martin, “you now see how mankind treat each other.” “It is certain,” said Candide, “that there is something diabolical in this affair.” As he was speaking, he noticed something of a shining red hue, floating close to the sunken vessel. They sent a boat to investigate what it might be, and it proved to be one of his sheep. Candide felt more joy at the recovery of this one animal than he did grief when he lost the other hundred, all laden with the large diamonds of El Dorado. The French captain quickly realized that the victorious ship belonged to the crown of Spain; that the other was a Dutch pirate and the very same captain who had robbed Candide. The immense riches which this villain had stolen were buried with him in the sea, and only this one sheep was saved. “You see,” said Candide to Martin, “that vice is sometimes punished; this villain the Dutch skipper has met with the fate he deserves.” “Very true,” said Martin “but why should the passengers perish too? God has punished the knave, and the devil has drowned the rest.”","—Well, said Martin, that is how men treat one another. —It is true, said Candide, there’s something devilish in this business. As they chatted, he noticed something of a striking red color floating near the sunken vessel. They sent out a boat to investigate; it was one of his sheep. Candide was more joyful to recover this one sheep than he had been afflicted to lose a hundred of them, all loaded with big Eldorado diamonds. The French captain soon learned that the captain of the victorious vessel was Spanish and that of the sunken vessel was a Dutch pirate. It was the same man who had robbed Candide. The enormous riches which this rascal had stolen were sunk beside him in the sea, and nothing was saved but a single sheep. —You see, said Candide to Martin, crime is punished sometimes; this scoundrel of a Dutch merchant has met the fate he deserved. —Yes, said Martin; but did the passengers aboard his ship have to perish too? God punished the scoundrel, the devil drowned the others.66"
"« Je me débarrassai avec beaucoup de peine de la foule de tant de cadavres sanglants entassés, et je me traînai sous un grand oranger au bord d’un ruisseau voisin; j’y tombai d’effroi, de lassitude, d’horreur, de désespoir et de faim. Bientôt après, mes sens accablés se livrèrent à un sommeil qui tenait plus de l’évanouissement que du repos.

"Après cette longue conversation, le bon vieillard fit atteler un carrosse à six moutons, et donna douze de ses domestiques aux deux voyageurs pour les conduire à la cour: « Excusez-moi, leur dit-il, si mon âge me prive de l’honneur de vous accompagner.

"Candide et Cacambo montent en carrosse; les six moutons volaient, et en moins de quatre heures on arriva au palais du roi, situé à un bout de la capitale.

"En disputant sur cette matière importante, et en attendant Cunégonde, Candide aperçut un jeune théatin dans la place Saint-Marc, qui tenait sous le bras une fille. Le théatin paraissait frais, potelé, vigoureux; ses yeux étaient brillants, son air assuré, sa mine haute, sa démarche fière. La fille était très jolie et chantait; elle regardait amoureusement son théatin, et de temps en temps lui pinçait ses grosses joues. « Vous m’avouerez du moins, dit Candide à Martin, que ces gens-ci sont heureux. Je n’ai trouvé jusqu’à présent dans toute la terre habitable, excepté dans Eldorado, que des infortunés; mais, pour cette fille et ce théatin, je gage que ce sont des créatures très heureuses. — Je gage que non, dit Martin. — Il n’y a qu’à les prier à dîner, dit Candide, et vous verrez si je me trompe. »","While arguing over this important matter, and while waiting for Cunégonde, Candide saw a young Theatine in St. Mark's Square, holding a girl under his arm. The Theatine looked fresh, chubby, vigorous; his eyes were bright, his air assured, his countenance high, his gait proud. The girl was very pretty and sang; she gazed lovingly at her theatin, and from time to time pinched her fat cheeks. “You will admit to me at least,” said Candide to Martin, “that these people are happy. I have hitherto found in all the habitable earth, except in Eldorado, only unfortunates; but, for this girl and this Theatine, I bet they are very happy creatures. ""I bet not,"" said Martin. ""You only have to ask them to dinner,"" said Candide, ""and you'll see if I'm wrong."" »","While they were disputing on this important subject, and still expecting Miss Cunégonde, Candide noticed a young Theatinbp friar in St. Mark’s place, with a girl under his arm.

The girl was very pretty, and was singing a song; and every now and then gave her Theatin an amorous ogle, and wantonly pinched his ruddy cheeks. “You will at least admit,” said Candide to Martin, “that these two are happy. So far I have met with none but unfortunate people in the whole habitable globe, except in El Dorado; but as to this couple, I would venture to lay a wager that they are happy.” “I bet they are not!” said Martin. “Well, we just have to ask them to dine with us,” said Candide, “and you will see whether I am mistaken or not.”","While they were discussing this important matter and still waiting for Cunégonde, Candide noticed in St. Mark’s Square a young Theatine monk89 who had given his arm to a girl.

The girl was very pretty, and singing aloud; she glanced lovingly at her Theatine, and from time to time pinched his plump cheeks. —At least you must admit, said Candide to Martin, that these people are happy. Until now I have not found in the whole inhabited earth, except Eldorado, anything but miserable people.

"— Je demande très humblement pardon à Votre Excellence, répondit Pangloss encore plus poliment, car la chute de l’homme et la malédiction entraient nécessairement dans le meilleur des mondes possibles. — Monsieur ne croit donc pas à la liberté? dit le familier. — Votre Excellence m’excusera, dit Pangloss; la liberté peut subsister avec la nécessité absolue; car il était nécessaire que nous fussions libres; car enfin la volonté déterminée… » Pangloss était au milieu de sa phrase, quand le familier fit un signe de tête à son estafier qui lui servait à boire du vin de Porto, ou d’Oporto.","“I very humbly beg your Excellency’s pardon,” Pangloss replied even more politely, for the fall of man and the curse necessarily entered into the best of all possible worlds.

Ils marchèrent en procession ainsi vêtus, et entendirent un sermon très pathétique, suivi d’une belle musique en faux-bourdon. Candide fut fessé en cadence, pendant qu’on chantait; le Biscayen et les deux hommes qui n’avaient point voulu manger de lard furent brûlés, et Pangloss fut pendu, quoique ce ne soit pas la coutume.

The same day the earth shook again with a terrible crash.","In consequence, they had rounded up a Biscayner for marrying his godmother,10 and two Portuguese who while eating a chicken had set aside a piece of bacon used for seasoning;11 after dinner, they came and secured Dr. Pangloss and his pupil Candide, the one for speaking his mind, and the other for seeming to approve what he said.

Candide obéit; le gouverneur demeura avec Mlle Cunégonde. Il lui déclara sa passion, lui protesta que le lendemain il l’épouserait à la face de l’Église, ou autrement, ainsi qu’il plairait à ses charmes.

He made her a strong declaration of love, protesting that he would marry her tomorrow in the face of the Church, or otherwise, as should appear most agreeable to a young lady of her prodigious beauty. Cunégonde asked to retire for a quarter of an hour to consult the old woman, and determine how she should proceed. The old woman gave her the following counsel: “","Don Fernando d’lbaraa y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza twirled his moustache, smiled sardonically, and ordered Captain Candide to go drill his company.

"Pendant cette conversation, la nouvelle s’était répandue qu’on venait d’étrangler à Constantinople deux vizirs du banc et le muphti, et qu’on avait empalé plusieurs de leurs amis. Cette catastrophe faisait partout un grand bruit pendant quelques heures. Pangloss, Candide et Martin, en retournant à la petite métairie, rencontrèrent un bon vieillard qui prenait le frais à sa porte sous un berceau d’orangers. Pangloss, qui était aussi curieux que raisonneur, lui demanda comment se nommait le muphti qu’on venait d’étrangler. « Je n’en sais rien, répondit le bonhomme, et je n’ai jamais su le nom d’aucun muphti ni d’aucun vizir. J’ignore absolument l’aventure dont vous me parlez; je présume qu’en général ceux qui se mêlent des affaires publiques périssent quelquefois misérablement, et qu’ils le méritent; mais je ne m’informe jamais de ce qu’on fait à Constantinople; je me contente d’y envoyer vendre les fruits du jardin que je cultive. » Ayant dit ces mots, il fit entrer les étrangers dans sa maison: ses deux filles et ses deux fils leur présentèrent plusieurs sortes de sorbets qu’ils faisaient eux-mêmes, du kaïmac piqué d’écorces de cédrat confit, des oranges, des citrons, des limons, des ananas, des pistaches, du café de Moka qui n’était point mêlé avec le mauvais café de Batavia et des îles. Après quoi les deux filles de ce bon musulman parfumèrent les barbes de Candide, de Pangloss et de Martin.","During this conversation the news had spread that two viziers of the bench and the mufti had just been strangled at Constantinople, and that several of their friends had been impaled. This catastrophe made a great noise everywhere for a few hours. Pangloss, Candide and Martin, on returning to the little farmhouse, met a good old man who was taking the cool air at his door under a cradle of orange trees. Pangloss, who was as curious as he was reasoning, asked him the name of the mufti who had just been strangled. “I don't know,” replied the good man, “and I never knew the name of any mufti or any vizier. I am absolutely unaware of the adventure you are telling me about; I presume that in general those who meddle in public affairs sometimes perish miserably, and that they deserve it; but I never inquire about what is being done in Constantinople; I content myself with sending the fruits of the garden that I cultivate there to sell. Having said these words, he let the strangers into his house: his two daughters and two sons presented them with several kinds of sorbets which they made themselves, kaïmac sprinkled with candied citron peel, oranges, lemons, lemons, pineapples, pistachios, Mocha coffee which was not mixed with the bad coffee of Batavia and the islands. After which the two daughters of this good Mussulman perfumed the beards of Candide, Pangloss and Martin.","During this conversation news was spreading aboard that two viziers of the bench and the mufti had just been strangled at Constantinople, and several of their friends impaled.

Pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked him the name of the mufti who had just been strangled. “I don’t know anything about it,” answered the good old man; “I never knew the name of any mufti or vizier breathing. I am entirely ignorant of the event you speak of; I presume that in general some who meddle in public affairs sometimes meet a miserable end, and they deserve it; but I never inquire about what is happening in Constantinople.

His two daughters and two sons presented them with all sorts of sherbet which they had made; as well as caymac heightened with the peels of candied citrons, oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee untainted with the bad coffee of Batavia or the American islands.

"Les cinq autres rois écoutèrent ce discours avec une noble compassion. Chacun d’eux donna vingt sequins au roi Théodore pour avoir des habits et des chemises; et Candide lui fit présent d’un diamant de deux mille sequins. « Quel est donc, disaient les cinq rois, ce simple particulier qui est en état de donner cent fois autant que chacun de nous, et qui le donne? »","The other five kings listened to this speech with noble compassion.

"Ensuite, se tournant vers Martin: « Qui pensez-vous, dit-il, qui soit le plus à plaindre, de l’empereur Achmet, de l’empereur Ivan, du roi Charles-Édouard, ou de moi? — Je n’en sais rien, dit Martin; il faudrait que je fusse dans vos coeurs pour le savoir. — Ah! dit Candide, si Pangloss était ici, il le saurait et nous l’apprendrait. — Je ne sais, dit Martin, avec quelles balances votre Pangloss aurait pu peser les infortunes des hommes et apprécier leurs douleurs.

""I don't know,"" said Martin, ""with what scales your Pangloss could have weighed the misfortunes of men and assessed their pains."" All I presume is that there are millions of men on earth a hundred times more to be pitied than King Charles Edward, Emperor Ivan, and Sultan Achmet. ""It might well be,"" said Candide.","Then turning to Martin, he asked, “What do you think? Whose condition is most to be pitied, the Emperor Achmet‘s, the Emperor Ivan’s, King Charles Edward’s, or mine?” “I don’t know at all,” said Martin. “I would need to enter the heart of each man to know.” “Ah!” cried Candide, “were Pangloss here now, he would have known and satisfied me at once.” “I don’t know,” said Martin, “what scales your Pangloss would use to weigh the misfortunes of mankind, and set a value on their sufferings.

All I will venture is that the earth holds millions of men who deserve our pity a hundred times more than King Charles Edward, Emperor Ivan, or Sultan Achmet. —You may well be right, said Candide."
"Il se présenta une foule de prétendants qu’une flotte n’aurait pu contenir. Candide voulant choisir entre les plus apparents, il distingua une vingtaine de personnes qui lui paraissaient assez sociables, et qui toutes prétendaient mériter la préférence.

"La belle Cunégonde, ayant entendu l’histoire de la vieille, lui fit toutes les politesses qu’on devait à une personne de son rang et de son mérite. Elle accepta la proposition; elle engagea tous les passagers l’un après l’autre à lui conter leurs aventures. Candide et elle avouèrent que la vieille avait raison. « C’est bien dommage, disait Candide, que le sage Pangloss ait été pendu contre la coutume dans un auto-da-fé; il nous dirait des choses admirables sur le mal physique et sur le mal moral qui couvrent la terre et la mer et je me sentirais assez de force pour oser lui faire respectueusement quelques objections. »","The beautiful Cunégonde, having heard the story of the old woman, paid her all the courtesies that one owed to a person of her rank and merit. She accepted the proposal; she urged all the passengers one after the other to tell her of their adventures. Candide and she confessed that the old woman was right. “It is a pity, said Candide, that the wise Pangloss was hanged against custom in an auto-da-fé; he would tell us admirable things about the physical evil and the moral evil that cover the land and the sea and I would feel strong enough to dare to raise a few objections to him respectfully. »","The fair Cunégonde, having heard the history of the old woman’s life and adventures, paid her all the respect and civility due to a person of her rank and merit. She very readily accepted her proposal of engaging every one of the passengers to relate their adventures in their turns, and was at length, as well as Candide, compelled to acknowledge that the old woman was right. “It is a thousand pities,” said Candide, “that the sage Pangloss should have been hanged contrary to the custom of an auto-da-fé, for he would have read us a most admirable lecture on the moral and physical evil which cover the earth and sea; and I think I might have courage enough to presume to offer, with all due respect, some few objections.”","Having heard out the old woman’s story, the lovely Cunégonde paid her the respects which were appropriate to a person of her rank and merit. She took up the wager as well, and got all the passengers, one after another, to tell her their adventures. She and Candide had to agree that the old woman had been right. —It’s certainly too bad, said Candide, that the wise Pangloss was hanged, contrary to the custom of autos-da-fé; he would have admirable things to say of the physical evil and moral evil which cover land and sea, and I might feel within me the impulse to dare to raise several polite objections."
"Le lendemain, ayant trouvé quelques provisions de bouche en se glissant à travers des décombres, ils réparèrent un peu leurs forces. Ensuite, ils travaillèrent comme les autres à soulager les habitants échappés à la mort. Quelques citoyens secourus par eux leur donnèrent un aussi bon dîner qu’on le pouvait dans un tel désastre. Il est vrai que le repas était triste; les convives arrosaient leur pain de leurs larmes; mais Pangloss les consola en les assurant que les choses ne pouvaient être autrement: « Car, dit-il, tout ceci est ce qu’il y a de mieux. Car, s’il y a un volcan à Lisbonne, il ne pouvait être ailleurs. Car il est impossible que les choses ne soient pas où elles sont. Car tout est bien. »","The next day, having found some food as they slipped through the rubble, they repaired their strength a little. Then, they worked like the others to relieve the inhabitants who had escaped death. A few citizens rescued by them gave them as good a dinner as could be in such a disaster. It is true that the meal was sad; the guests sprinkled their bread with their tears; but Pangloss consoled them by assuring them that things could not be otherwise: ""For,"" said he, ""all this is the best."" Because, if there is a volcano in Lisbon, it could not be elsewhere. Because it is impossible for things not to be where they are. Because all is well. »","The next day, in searching among the ruins, they found a little food, with which restored their exhausted strength. After this they assisted the inhabitants in helping the distressed and wounded. Some whom they had humanely assisted gave them as good a dinner as could be expected under such terrible circumstances. The meal, indeed, was mournful, and the company moistened their bread with their tears; but Pangloss endeavoured to comfort them by affirming that things could not be otherwise than they were: “for,” said he, “all this is for the very best end, for if there is a volcanoo at Lisbon, it could be in no other spot; for it is impossible but things should be as they are, for everything is for the best.”","Next day, as they wandered amid the ruins, they found a little food which restored some of their strength. Then they fell to work like the others, bringing relief to those of the inhabitants who had escaped death. Some of the citizens whom they rescued gave them a dinner as good as was possible under the circumstances; it is true that the meal was a melancholy one, and the guests watered their bread with tears; but Pangloss consoled them by proving that things could not possibly be otherwise. —For, said he, all this is for the best, since if there is a volcano at Lisbon, it cannot be somewhere else, since it is unthinkable that things should not be where they are, since everything is well."
"Candide, qui était naturellement curieux, se laissa mener chez la dame, au fond du faubourg Saint-Honoré; on y était occupé d’un pharaon; douze tristes pontes tenaient chacun en main un petit livre de cartes, registre cornu de leurs infortunes. Un profond silence régnait, la pâleur était sur le front des pontes, l’inquiétude sur celui du banquier, et la dame du logis, assise auprès de ce banquier impitoyable, remarquait avec des yeux de lynx tous les parolis, tous les sept-et-le-va de campagne, dont chaque joueur cornait ses cartes; elle les faisait décorner avec une attention sévère mais polie, et ne se fâchait point, de peur de perdre ses pratiques: la dame se faisait appeler la marquise de Parolignac. Sa fille, âgée de quinze ans, était au nombre des pontes et avertissait d’un clin d’oeil des friponneries de ces pauvres gens, qui tâchaient de réparer les cruautés du sort. L’abbé périgourdin, Candide et Martin entrèrent; personne ne se leva, ni les salua, ni les regarda; tous étaient profondément occupés de leurs cartes. « Madame la baronne de Thunder-ten-tronckh était plus civile, » dit Candide.","Candide, who was naturally curious, allowed himself to be led to the lady's house, at the end of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; they were busy with a pharaoh; twelve sad pundits each held a little book of cards in their hands, a horned register of their misfortunes. A profound silence reigned, pallor was on the brows of the pundits, anxiety on that of the banker, and the lady of the house, seated near this pitiless banker, noticed with lynx eyes all the parolis, all the seven-and-twenties. -the campaign, in which each player cornait his cards; she had them dehorned with severe but polite attention, and did not get angry for fear of losing her practice: the lady called herself the Marquise de Parolignac. His daughter, aged fifteen, was one of the pundits and warned with a wink of the trickery of these poor people, who were trying to repair the cruelties of fate. The Perigord Abbot, Candide and Martin entered; no one stood up, greeted them, or looked at them; all were deeply occupied with their cards. “Madame la Baroness de Thunder-ten-tronckh was more civil,” said Candide.","Candide, who was naturally curious, allowed himself to be taken to this lady’s house, which was in the suburbs of St Honoré.bj The people gathered there were playing a game of basset;bk twelve melancholy gamblers held each in his hand a small pack of cards, the corners of which, turned down, were the summaries of their bad luck. A profound silence reigned through the assembly, the gamblers were pallid and the banker was uneasy; and the lady of the house, who was seated next to him, observed with lynx’s eyes every parolebl and bet at long odds which the players signaled by folding the corners of the cards, and she made them unfold their cards with a severe exactness, though mixed with a politeness, lest she frighten away her customers. This lady assumed the tide of Marchioness of Parolignac. Her daughter, a girl of about fifteen years of age, was one of the gamblers, and tipped off her mamma, by signs, when any one of the players attempted to undo their ill-fortune by a little innocent deception. This is how the group was occupied when Candide, Martin and the Abbé made their entrance. Not a creature rose to salute them, or indeed took the least notice of them, being instead completely absorbed with their cards. “Ah!” said Candide, “My lady Baroness of Thunder-ten-tronckh would have behaved more civilly.”","Candide, who was curious by nature, allowed himself to be brought to the lady’s house, in the depths of the Faubourg St.-Honoré; they were playing faro;79 twelve melancholy punters held in their hands a little sheaf of cards, blank summaries of their bad luck. Silence reigned supreme, the punters were pallid, the banker uneasy; and the lady of the house, seated beside the pitiless banker, watched with the eyes of a lynx for the various illegal redoublings and bets at long odds which the players tried to signal by folding the corners of their cards; she had them unfolded with a determination which was severe but polite, and concealed her anger lest she lose her customers. The lady caused herself to be known as the Marquise of Parolignac.80 Her daughter, fifteen years old, sat among the punters and tipped off her mother with a wink to the sharp practices of these unhappy players when they tried to recoup their losses. The abbé from Perigord, Candide, and Martin came in; nobody arose or greeted them or looked at them; all were lost in the study of their cards. —My Lady the Baroness of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh was more civil, thought Candide."
"— Que de pièces de théâtre je vois là! dit Candide; en italien, en espagnol, en français! — Oui, dit le sénateur, il y en a trois mille, et pas trois douzaines de bonnes. Pour ces recueils de sermons, qui tous ensemble ne valent pas une page de Sénèque, et tous ces gros volumes de théologie, vous pensez bien que je ne les ouvre jamais, ni moi ni personne. »","""How many plays I see there!"" said Candide; in Italian, in Spanish, in French!

As to those huge volumes of divinity, and those enormous collections of sermons, altogether they are not worth one single page of Seneca;bz and I’m sure you will readily believe that neither myself nor anyone else ever opens them.”","—What a lot of stage plays I see over there, said Candide, some in Italian, some in Spanish and French. —Yes, said the senator, three thousand of them, and not three dozen good ones.

"Ils voguèrent quelques lieues entre des bords tantôt fleuris, tantôt arides, tantôt unis, tantôt escarpés. La rivière s’élargissait toujours; enfin elle se perdait sous une voûte de rochers épouvantables qui s’élevaient jusqu’au ciel. Les deux voyageurs eurent la hardiesse de s’abandonner aux flots sous cette voûte. Le fleuve, resserré en cet endroit, les porta avec une rapidité et un bruit horrible. Au bout de vingt-quatre heures ils revirent le jour; mais leur canot se fracassa contre les écueils; il fallut se traîner de rocher en rocher pendant une lieue entière; enfin ils découvrirent un horizon immense, bordé de montagnes inaccessibles. Le pays était cultivé pour le plaisir comme pour le besoin; partout l’utile était agréable. Les chemins étaient couverts ou plutôt ornés de voitures d’une forme et d’une matière brillante, portant des hommes et des femmes d’une beauté singulière, traînés rapidement par de gros moutons rouges qui surpassaient en vitesse les plus beaux chevaux d’Andalousie, de Tétuan et de Méquinez.","They sailed for a few leagues between shores that were sometimes flowery, sometimes arid, sometimes smooth, sometimes steep. The river kept widening; finally it was lost under a vault of terrible rocks which rose to the sky. The two travelers had the boldness to abandon themselves to the waves under this vault. The river, constricted in this place, carried them with a horrible rapidity and noise. At the end of twenty-four hours they saw the light again; but their canoe crashed against the rocks; we had to drag ourselves from rock to rock for a whole league; finally they discovered an immense horizon, bordered by inaccessible mountains. The country was cultivated for pleasure as well as for need; everywhere the useful was agreeable. The roads were covered, or rather adorned, with carriages of a brilliant shape and material, bearing men and women of singular beauty, dragged swiftly by great red sheep, which surpassed in speed the finest horses of Andalusia. , Tetuan and Méquinez.","They rowed a few leagues down the river, the banks of which in some places were covered with flowers, in others barren; in some parts smooth and level, and in others steep and rugged. The stream widened as they went farther on, till at length it passed under one of the frightful rocks whose summits seemed to reach the clouds. Here our two travellers had the courage to commit themselves to the stream, which, narrowing at this point, hurried them along with a dreadful noise and speed. At the end of twenty-four hours they saw daylight again; but their canoe was smashed to pieces against the rocks. They had to creep along from rock to rock for the length of one league, till at length a spacious plain came into sight. This place was ringed by a chain of inaccessible mountains. The country appeared cultivated for pleasure as well as to produce the necessaries of life. The useful was joined to the agreeable. The roads were covered, or rather adorned, with carriages formed of glittering materials, in which were men and women of surprising beauty, drawn with great speed by red sheep of a very large size, which far surpassed the finest horses of Andalusia, Tetuan, or Mecquinez.","They floated some leagues between banks sometimes flowery, sometimes sandy, now steep, now level. The river widened steadily; finally it disappeared into a chasm of frightful rocks that rose high into the heavens.

After twenty-four hours, they saw daylight once more; but their canoe was smashed on the snags. They had to drag themselves from rock to rock for an entire league; at last they emerged to an immense horizon, ringed with remote mountains. The countryside was tended for pleasure as well as profit; everywhere the useful was joined to the agreeable.54 The roads were covered, or rather decorated, with elegantly shaped carriages made of a glittering material, carrying men and women of singular beauty, and drawn by great red sheep which were faster than the finest horses of Andalusia, Tetuan, and Mequinez.55"
"— Eh bien! mon cher Pangloss, lui dit Candide, quand vous avez été pendu, disséqué, roué de coups, et que vous avez ramé aux galères, avez-vous toujours pensé que tout allait le mieux du monde? — Je suis toujours de mon premier sentiment, répondit Pangloss, car enfin je suis philosophe: il ne me convient pas de me dédire, Leibnitz ne pouvant pas avoir tort, et l’harmonie préétablie étant d’ailleurs la plus belle chose du monde, aussi bien que le plein et la matière subtile. »","- Well! my dear Pangloss, said Candide to him, when you were hanged, dissected, beaten, and rowed in the galleys, did you always think that everything was going for the best in the world?

There’s not a doctor in the whole world who will let your blood or give you an enema without demanding a fee. If you can’t pay yourself, you must find someone to pay for you."
"Cependant, à force de médecines et de saignées, la maladie de Candide devint sérieuse. Un habitué du quartier vint avec douceur lui demander un billet payable au porteur pour l’autre monde; Candide n’en voulut rien faire. Les dévotes l’assurèrent que c’était une nouvelle mode; Candide répondit qu’il n’était point homme à la mode. Martin voulut jeter l’habitué par les fenêtres. Le clerc jura qu’on n’enterrerait point Candide. Martin jura qu’il enterrerait le clerc s’il continuait à les importuner. La querelle s’échauffa; Martin le prit par les épaules et le chassa rudement; ce qui causa un grand scandale, dont on fit un procès-verbal.","However, by dint of medicine and bloodletting, Candide's illness became serious. A regular in the neighborhood came gently to ask him for a ticket payable to bearer for the other world; Candide didn't want to do anything about it. The devotees assured her that it was a new fashion; Candide replied that he was not a fashionable man. Martin wanted to throw the regular out of the windows. The clerk swore that Candide would not be buried. Martin swore he would bury the clerk if he continued to bother them. The quarrel heated up; Martin took him by the shoulders and chased him away roughly; which caused a great scandal, of which a report was made.","However, as a result of the purging and bleeding,bg Candide’s condition became very serious. The priest of the parish came with all imaginable politeness to ask for a note payable to the bearer in the other world.bh Candide refused to comply with his request, but the two pious ladies assured him that it was a new fashion. Candide replied that he was not one to follow fashion. Martin wanted to throw the priest out of the window. The cleric swore that Candide would not have Christian burial. Martin swore in his turn that he would bury the cleric alive if he continued to bother them any longer. The dispute grew heated; Martin took him by the shoulders and turned him out of the room, which caused a great scandal and developed into a legal case.","However, as a result of medicines and bleedings, Candide’s illness became serious. A resident of the neighborhood came to ask him politely to fill out a ticket, to be delivered to the porter of the other world.71 Candide wanted nothing to do with it. The pious ladies assured him it was a new fashion; Candide replied that he wasn’t a man of fashion. Martin wanted to throw the resident out the window. The cleric swore that without the ticket they wouldn’t bury Candide. Martin swore that he would bury the cleric if he continued to be a nuisance. The quarrel grew heated; Martin took him by the shoulders and threw him bodily out the door; all of which caused a great scandal, from which developed a legal case."

"Pendant que Candide, le baron, Pangloss, Martin et Cacambo contaient leurs aventures, qu’ils raisonnaient sur les événements contingents ou non contingents de cet univers, qu’ils disputaient sur les effets et les causes, sur le mal moral et sur le mal physique, sur la liberté et la nécessité, sur les consolations que l’on peut éprouver lorsqu’on est aux galères en Turquie, ils abordèrent sur le rivage de la Propontide à la maison du prince de Transylvanie. Les premiers objets qui se présentèrent furent Cunégonde et la vieille, qui étendaient des serviettes sur des ficelles pour les faire sécher.","While Candide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin and Cacambo related their adventures, while they reasoned about the contingent or non-contingent events of this universe, while they disputed about effects and causes, about moral evil and evil physics, on freedom and necessity, on the consolations that one can feel when one is at the galleys in Turkey, they landed on the shore of the Propontis at the house of the Prince of Transylvania. The first objects that presented themselves were Cunégonde and the old woman, who were spreading towels on strings to dry them.","While Candide, the Baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo were relating their adventures, and reasoning on the contingent or non-contingent events of this world,31 on causes and effects, on moral and physical evil, on free-will and necessity, and on the consolation available to a slave on a Turkish galley, they arrived at the house of the Transylvanian prince on the coasts of the Propontis. The first objects they saw there were Miss Cunégonde and the old woman, who were hanging out some table-cloths on a line to dry.","While Candide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo were telling one another their stories, while they were disputing over the contingent or non-contingent events of this universe, while they were arguing over effects and causes, over moral evil and physical evil, over liberty and necessity, and over the consolations available to one in a Turkish galley, they arrived at the shores of Propontis and the house of the prince of Transylvania. The first sight to meet their eyes was Cunégonde and the old woman, who were hanging out towels on lines to dry."
"Un soir que Candide, suivi de Martin, allait se mettre à table avec les étrangers qui logeaient dans la même hôtellerie, un homme à visage couleur de suie l’aborda par-derrière, et, le prenant par le bras, lui dit: « Soyez prêt à partir avec nous… n’y manquez pas. » Il se retourne, et voit Cacambo. Il n’y avait que la vue de Cunégonde qui pût l’étonner et lui plaire davantage. Il fut sur le point de devenir fou de joie. Il embrasse son cher ami. « Cunégonde est ici, sans doute, où est-elle? Mène-moi vers elle, que je meure de joie avec elle. — Cunégonde n’est point ici, dit Cacambo, elle est à Constantinople. — Ah, Ciel! à Constantinople! mais, fût-elle à la Chine, j’y vole, partons. — Nous partirons après souper, reprit Cacambo, je ne peux vous en dire davantage; je suis esclave, mon maître m’attend; il faut que j’aille le servir à table: ne dites mot; soupez et tenez-vous prêt. »","One evening when Candide, followed by Martin, was going to sit down to table with the strangers who lodged in the same hostelry, a man with a face the color of soot approached him from behind, and, taking him by the arm, said to him: Get ready to go with us…don't miss it. He turns around, and sees Cacambo. Only the sight of Cunégonde could astonish and please her more. He was about to go mad with joy. He kisses his dear friend. “Cunegonde is here, no doubt, where is she? Lead me to her, that I die of joy with her. ""Cunegonde is not here,"" said Cacambo, ""she is in Constantinople."" “Ah, Sky! in Constantinople! but, were it in China, I fly there, let us leave. 'We'll leave after supper,' resumed Cacambo, 'I can't tell you more; I am a slave, my master awaits me; I must serve him at table: don't say a word; eat supper and get ready. »","One evening when Candide and Martin were going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged at the same inn where they were staying, a man, with a face the colour of soot, came behind him, and taking him by the arm, said “Be ready to leave with us; don’t miss this.” He turned around and saw Cacambo. Nothing but the sight of Miss Cunégonde could have given him greater joy and surprise. He was almost beside himself. After embracing this dear friend, “Cunégonde!” he said, “Cunégonde has come with you, no doubt! Where, where is she? Take me to her this instant so that I may die of joy in her presence.” “Cunégonde is not here,” answered Cacambo, “she is at Constantinople.” “Good heavens, at Constantinople! But no matter if she were in China, I would fly there. Quick, quick, dear Cacambo, let’s go.” “We will leave after eating,” said Cacambo. “I cannot at present say anything more to you. I am a slave, and my master waits for me: I must go and wait on him at table. But mum! say not a word; only get your supper, and be ready.”","One evening when Candide, accompanied by Martin, was about to sit down for dinner with the strangers staying in his hotel, a man with a soot-colored face came up behind him, took him by the arm, and said: —Be ready to leave with us, don’t miss out. He turned and saw Cacambo. Only the sight of Cunégonde could have astonished and pleased him more. He nearly went mad with joy. He embraced his dear friend. —Cunégonde is here, no doubt? Where is she? Bring me to her, let me die of joy in her presence. —Cunégonde is not here at all, said Cacambo, she is at Constantinople. —Good Heavens, at Constantinople! but if she were in China, I must fly there, let’s go. —We will leave after supper, said Cacambo; I can tell you no more; I am a slave, my owner is looking for me, I must go wait on him at table; mum’s the word; eat your supper and be prepared."

"Les Oreillons trouvèrent ce discours très raisonnable; ils députèrent deux notables pour aller en diligence s’informer de la vérité; les deux députés s’acquittèrent de leur commission en gens d’esprit, et revinrent bientôt apporter de bonnes nouvelles. Les Oreillons délièrent leurs deux prisonniers, leur firent toutes sortes de civilités, leur offrirent des filles, leur donnèrent des rafraîchissements, et les reconduisirent jusqu’aux confins de leurs États, en criant avec allégresse: « Il n’est point jésuite, il n’est point jésuite! »","The Oreillons found this speech very reasonable; they deputed two notables to go hastily to inquire into the truth; the two deputies acquitted themselves of their commission like men of intelligence, and soon returned with good news. The Oreillons untied their two prisoners, paid them all sorts of courtesies, offered them girls, gave them refreshments, and escorted them to the confines of their States, shouting with joy: ""He is not a Jesuit, he is not a Jesuit. is not a Jesuit! »","This speech appeared very reasonable to the Oreillons. They sent AN OREILLON RECEPTION two of their people to inquire into the truth of this affair, who performed the task like men of sense, and soon returned with good news for our distressed adventurers. Upon this they were both freed, and those who were so recently going to roast and boil them, now showed them all sorts of civilities, offered them girls, gave them refreshments, and led them back to the border of their country, crying all the way, in token of joy: “He is no Jesuit, he is no Jesuit.”","The Biglugs found this discourse perfectly reasonable; they appointed chiefs to go posthaste and find out the truth; the two messengers performed their task like men of sense, and quickly returned bringing good news. The Biglugs untied their two prisoners, treated them with great politeness, offered them girls, gave them refreshments, and led them back to the border of their state, crying joyously: — He isn’t a Jesuit, he isn’t a Jesuit!"
"— Ô Pangloss! s’écria Candide, tu n’avais pas deviné cette abomination; c’en est fait, il faudra qu’à la fin je renonce à ton optimisme. — Qu’est-ce qu’optimisme? disait Cacambo. — Hélas! dit Candide, c’est la rage de soutenir que tout est bien quand on est mal. » Et il versait des larmes en regardant son nègre, et en pleurant il entra dans Surinam.","“O Pangloss! exclaimed Candide, you had not divined this abomination; it's all over, I'll have to give up your optimism in the end. — What is optimism? said Cacambo. — Alas! said Candide, it is the rage to maintain that all is well when one is badly. And he shed tears looking at his negro, and weeping he entered Surinam.","“O Pangloss!” cried out Candide, “such horrid doings never entered your imagination. Here is an end of the matter; I find myself, after all, obliged to renounce your optimism.” “Optimism,” said Cacambo, “what is that?” “Alas!” replied Candide , “it is the obstinacy of maintaining that everything is best when it is worst”; and so saying, he turned his eyes towards the poor negro, and shed a flood of tears; and in this weeping mood he entered the town of Surinam.","—Oh Pangloss! cried Candide, you had no notion of these abominations! I’m through , I must give up your optimism after all. —What’s optimism? said Cacambo. —Alas, said Candide, it is a mania for saying things are well when one is in hell.62 And he shed bitter tears as he looked at his negro, and he was still weeping as he entered Surinam."
"En parlant ainsi, il ne laissait pas de manger. Le soleil se couchait. Les deux égarés entendirent quelques petits cris qui paraissaient poussés par des femmes. Ils ne savaient si ces cris étaient de douleur ou de joie; mais ils se levèrent précipitamment avec cette inquiétude et cette alarme que tout inspire dans un pays inconnu. Ces clameurs partaient de deux filles toutes nues qui couraient légèrement au bord de la prairie, tandis que deux singes les suivaient en leur mordant les fesses. Candide fut touché de pitié; il avait appris à tirer chez les Bulgares, et il aurait abattu une noisette dans un buisson sans toucher aux feuilles. Il prend son fusil espagnol à deux coups, tire, et tue les deux singes. « Dieu soit loué, mon cher Cacambo! j’ai délivré d’un grand péril ces deux pauvres créatures; si j’ai commis un péché en tuant un inquisiteur et un jésuite, je l’ai bien réparé en sauvant la vie à deux filles. Ce sont peut-être deux demoiselles de condition, et cette aventure nous peut procurer de très grands avantages dans le pays. »","Speaking thus, he did not stop eating. The sun was setting. The two strays heard a few small cries which seemed to be uttered by women. They did not know if these cries were of pain or of joy; but they got up hastily with that uneasiness and that alarm which everything inspires in an unknown country. These shouts came from two naked girls running lightly along the edge of the meadow, while two monkeys followed them, biting their buttocks. Candide was touched with pity; he had learned to shoot with the Bulgarians, and he would have cut down a nut in a bush without touching the leaves. He takes his Spanish double-barreled gun, shoots, and kills the two monkeys. “God be praised, my dear Cacambo! I delivered these two poor creatures from a great peril; if I committed a sin by killing an inquisitor and a Jesuit, I made good on it by saving the lives of two girls. They are perhaps two young ladies of condition, and this adventure can bring us very great advantages in the country. »","While he was making these reflections he still continued eating. The sun was now at the point of setting when our two wanderers heard cries which seemed to be uttered by a female voice. They could not tell whether these were cries of grief or joy; however, they instantly started up, full of that inquietude and apprehension which a strange place naturally inspires. The cries came from two young women who were tripping stark naked along the meadow while two monkeys followed close at their heels, biting their backs. Candide was moved to pity; he had learned to shoot while he was among the Bulgarians, and he could hit a nut off a bush without touching a leaf. Accordingly he took up his double-barrel Spanish rifle, pulled the trigger, and killed the two monkeys. “God be praised, my dear Cacambo, I have rescued two poor creatures from a perilous situation. If I have committed a sin in killing an Inquisitor and a Jesuit, I made ample amends by saving the lives of these two distressed girls. Perhaps they are young ladies of rank, and this assistance I have been so happy to give them may gain us great advantages in this country.”","Though he talked this way, he did not neglect the food. Night fell. The two wanderers heard a few weak cries which seemed to be voiced by women. They could not tell whether the cries expressed grief or joy; but they leaped at once to their feet, with that uneasy suspicion which one always feels in an unknown country. The outcry arose from two girls, completely naked, who were running swiftly along the edge of the meadow, pursued by two monkeys who snapped at their buttocks. Candide was moved to pity; he had learned marksmanship with the Bulgars, and could have knocked a nut off a bush without touching the leaves. He raised his Spanish rifle, fired twice, and killed the two monkeys. —God be praised, my dear Cacambo! I’ve saved these two poor creatures from great danger. Though I committed a sin in killing an inquisitor and a Jesuit, I’ve redeemed myself by saving the lives of two girls. Perhaps they are two ladies of rank, and this good deed may gain us special advantages in the country."

"Vingt belles filles de la garde reçurent Candide et Cacambo à la descente du carrosse, les conduisirent aux bains, les vêtirent de robes d’un tissu de duvet de colibri; après quoi les grands officiers et les grandes officières de la couronne les menèrent à l’appartement de sa Majesté, au milieu de deux files chacune de mille musiciens, selon l’usage ordinaire. Quand ils approchèrent de la salle du trône, Cacambo demanda à un grand officier comment il fallait s’y prendre pour saluer sa Majesté; si on se jetait à genoux ou ventre à terre; si on mettait les mains sur la tête ou sur le derrière; si on léchait la poussière de la salle; en un mot, quelle était la cérémonie. « L’usage, dit le grand officier, est d’embrasser le roi et de le baiser des deux côtés. » Candide et Cacambo sautèrent au cou de sa Majesté, qui les reçut avec toute la grâce imaginable et qui les pria poliment à souper.","Twenty beautiful girls from the guard received Candide and Cacambo as they alighted from the carriage, led them to the baths, dressed them in dresses made of hummingbird down; after which the Grand Officers and Grand Officers of the Crown conducted them to His Majesty's apartment, in the midst of two files each of a thousand musicians, according to the usual custom. When they approached the throne room, Cacambo asked a grand officer how to go about saluting his Majesty; if we threw ourselves on our knees or belly to the ground; whether you put your hands on your head or on your behind; if one licked the dust from the hall; in a word, what was the ceremony. ""The custom,"" said the grand officer, ""is to embrace the king and to kiss him on both sides. Candide and Cacambo threw themselves on the neck of his Majesty, who received them with all imaginable grace and politely asked them to supper.","Twenty beautiful young virgins in waiting welcomed Candide and Cacambo as they stepped from the coach, led them to the bath, and dressed them in robes made of the down of humming-birds; afterwards they were introduced by the great officers of the crown, both male and female, to the king’s apartment, between two files of musicians, each file consisting of a thousand, as is customary in that country. When they drew near to the throne room, Cacambo asked one of the officers how they were to pay their respects to his majesty; whether it was the custom to fall upon their knees, or to prostrate themselves upon the ground? whether they should put their hands on their heads or behind their backs? whether they should lick the dust off the floor? in short, what was the proper form for such occasions? “ The custom,” said the great officer, “is to embrace the king, and kiss him on each cheek.” Candide and Cacambo threw their arms around his majesty’s neck, who received them in the most gracious manner imaginable, and very politely asked them to dine with him.","Twenty beautiful girls of the guard detail welcomed Candide and Cacambo as they stepped from the carriage, took them to the baths, and dressed them in robes woven of humming-bird feathers; then the high officials of the crown, both male and female, led them to the royal chamber between two long lines, each of a thousand musicians, as is customary. As they approached the throne room, Cacambo asked an officer what was the proper method of greeting his majesty: if one fell to one’s knees or on one’s belly; if one put one’s hands on one’s head or on one’s rear; if one licked up the dust of the earth—in a word, what was the proper form?60 —The ceremony, said the officer, is to embrace the king and kiss him on both cheeks. Candide and Cacambo warmly embraced his majesty, who received them with all the dignity imaginable, and asked them politely to dine."
"Pangloss répondit en ces termes: « O mon cher Candide! vous avez connu Paquette, cette jolie suivante de notre auguste baronne; j’ai goûté dans ses bras les délices du paradis, qui ont produit ces tourments d’enfer dont vous me voyez dévoré; elle en était infectée, elle en est peut-être morte. Paquette tenait ce présent d’un cordelier très savant, qui avait remonté à la source; car il l’avait eue d’une vieille comtesse, qui l’avait reçue d’un capitaine de cavalerie, qui la devait à une marquise, qui la tenait d’un page, qui l’avait reçue d’un jésuite, qui, étant novice, l’avait eue en droite ligne d’un des compagnons de Christophe Colomb. Pour moi, je ne la donnerai à personne, car je me meurs.","Pangloss replied in these terms: “O my dear Candide! you knew Paquette, that pretty servant of our august baroness; I tasted in his arms the delights of paradise, which produced those torments of hell with which you see me devoured; she was infected with it, she may have died of it. Paquette got this present from a very learned Cordelier, who had gone back to the source; for he had had it from an old countess, who had received it from a cavalry captain, who owed it to a marquise, who had received it from a page, who had received it from a Jesuit, who , being a novice, had had her in direct line with one of the companions of Christopher Columbus. As for me, I won't give it to anyone, because I'm dying.","Pangloss replied as follows: “Oh, my dear Candide, you must remember Pacquette, that pretty wench who waited on our noble baroness; in her arms I tasted the pleasures of paradise, which produced these hell-torments with which you see me devoured. She was infected with disease, i and perhaps is since dead of it. She received this present of a learned cordelier, who traced it back to its source. He was indebted for it to an old countess, who caught it from a captain of cavalry, who caught it from a marchioness, who caught it from a page, the page received it from a Jesuit, who during his noviciate got it directly from one of the fellow adventurers of Christopher Columbus. For my part, I shall give it to nobody. I am a dying man.”","Pangloss replied as follows: —My dear Candide! you knew Paquette, that pretty maidservant to our august Baroness. In her arms I tasted the delights of paradise, which directly caused these torments of hell, from which I am now suffering. She was infected with the disease, and has perhaps died of it. Paquette received this present from an erudite Franciscan, who took the pains to trace it back to its source; for he had it from an elderly countess, who picked it up from a captain of cavalry, who acquired it from a marquise, who caught it from a page, who had received it from a Jesuit, who during his novitiate got it directly from one of the companions of Christopher Columbus.15 As for me, I shall not give it to anyone, for I am a dying man."
"On se mit à table, et après un excellent dîner, on entra dans la bibliothèque. Candide, en voyant un Homère magnifiquement relié, loua l’illustrissime sur son bon goût. « Voilà, dit-il, un livre qui faisait les délices du grand Pangloss, le meilleur philosophe de l’Allemagne. — Il ne fait pas les miennes, dit froidement Pococurante; on me fit accroire autrefois que j’avais du plaisir en le lisant; mais cette répétition continuelle de combats qui se ressemblent tous, ces dieux qui agissent toujours pour ne rien faire de décisif, cette Hélène qui est le sujet de la guerre, et qui à peine est une actrice de la pièce; cette Troie qu’on assiège et qu’on ne prend point, tout cela me causait le plus mortel ennui. J’ai demandé quelquefois à des savants s’ils s’ennuyaient autant que moi à cette lecture. Tous les gens sincères m’ont avoué que le livre leur tombait des mains, mais qu’il fallait toujours l’avoir dans sa bibliothèque, comme un monument de l’antiquité, et comme ces médailles rouillées qui ne peuvent être de commerce.","We sat down to table, and after an excellent dinner, we entered the library. Candide, seeing a beautifully bound Homer, praised the illustrious for his good taste. ""Here,"" he said, ""is a book which was the delight of the great Pangloss, the best philosopher in Germany. ""He doesn't do mine,"" said Pococurante coldly; I was made to believe formerly that I had pleasure in reading it; but this continual repetition of combats which all look alike, these gods who always act to do nothing decisive, this Helen who is the subject of the war, and who is hardly an actress in the play; this Troy which is besieged and not taken, all that caused me the most mortal boredom. I have sometimes asked scholars if they were as bored as I was reading this. All sincere people have confessed to me that the book fell from their hands, but that one should always have it in one's library, like a monument of antiquity, and like those rusty medals which cannot be traded.","Dinner being served, they sat down to the table, and after a hearty meal, returned to the library. Candide, seeing a copy of Homerbv in splendid binding, complimented the noble Venetian’s taste. “This,” said he, “is a book that was once the delight of the great Pangloss, the best philosopher in Germany.” “Homer is no favourite of mine,” answered Pococuranté very coolly. “I was made to believe once that I took a pleasure in reading him; but his continual repetitions of battles which are all alike; his gods that are always interfering, but never doing anything decisive; his Helen, who is the cause of the war, and yet hardly acts in the whole performance; his Troy that holds out so long without being taken; in short, all these things together make the poem very boring to me. I have asked some scholars if reading it bored them as much as it bored me. Those who spoke sincerely assured me that he had made them fall asleep, and yet that they could not well avoid giving him a place in their libraries; but that is merely what they do with an antique, like those rusty medals which are kept only for curiosity, and are of no use in commerce.”","They sat down to dinner, and after an excellent meal adjourned to the library. Candide, seeing a copy of Homer94 in a splendid binding, complimented the noble lord on his good taste. —That is an author, said he, who was the special delight of great Pangloss, the best philosopher in all Germany. —He’s no special delight of mine, said Pococurante coldly. I was once made to believe that I took pleasure in reading him; but that constant recital of fights which are all alike, those gods who are always interfering but never decisively, that Helen who is the cause of the war and then scarcely takes any part in the story, that Troy which is always under siege and never taken—all that bores me to tears. I have sometimes asked scholars if reading it bored them as much as it bores me; everyone who answered frankly told me the book dropped from his hands like lead, but that they had to have it in their libraries as a monument of antiquity, like those old rusty coins which can’t be used in real trade."
"Il donna l’ordre sur-le-champ à ses ingénieurs de faire une machine pour guinder ces deux hommes extraordinaires hors du royaume. Trois mille bons physiciens y travaillèrent; elle fut prête au bout de quinze jours, et ne coûta pas plus de vingt millions de livres sterling, monnaie du pays. On mit sur la machine Candide et Cacambo; il y avait deux grands moutons rouges sellés et bridés pour leur servir de monture quand ils auraient franchi les montagnes, vingt moutons de bât chargés de vivres, trente qui portaient des présents de ce que le pays a de plus curieux, et cinquante chargés d’or, de pierreries et de diamants. Le roi embrassa tendrement les deux vagabonds.","He immediately ordered his engineers to make a machine to steer these two extraordinary men out of the kingdom. Three thousand good physicists worked there; it was ready at the end of a fortnight, and cost no more than twenty millions of pounds sterling, the currency of the country. Candide and Cacambo were put on the machine; there were two big red sheep saddled and bridled to serve as mounts for them when they had crossed the mountains, twenty pack sheep laden with provisions, thirty who carried the most curious presents in the country, and fifty laden with gold, precious stones and diamonds. The king tenderly embraced the two vagabonds.","He immediately gave orders to his engineers to make a machine to hoist these two extraordinary men out of the kingdom. Three thousand good mathematicians went to work and finished it in about fifteen days; and it did not cost more than twenty millions sterling of that country’s money. Candide and Cacambo were placed on this machine, and they took with them two large red sheep, bridled and saddled, to ride upon when they got on the other side of the mountains; twenty others for carrying provisions; thirty laden with presents of the rareties of that country; and fifty with gold, diamonds and other precious stones. The king at parting with our two adventurers, embraced them with the greatest cordiality.","may it do you. He promptly gave orders to his technicians to make a machine for lifting these two extraordinary men out of his kingdom. Three thousand good physicists worked at the problem; the machine was ready in two weeks’ time, and cost no more than twenty million pounds sterling, in the money of the country. Cacambo and Candide were placed in the machine; there were two great sheep, saddled and bridled to serve them as steeds when they had cleared the mountains, twenty pack sheep with provisions, thirty which carried presents consisting of the rarities of the country, and fifty loaded with gold, jewels, and diamonds. The king bade tender farewell to the two vagabonds."
"Ce discours plut à Cacambo: on aime tant à courir, à se faire valoir chez les siens, à faire parade de ce qu’on a vu dans ses voyages, que les deux heureux résolurent de ne plus l’être et de demander leur congé à sa Majesté.","This speech pleased Cacambo: one likes so much to run, to show off at one's own, to show off what one has seen in one's travels, that the two happy people resolved not to be one anymore and to ask for their leave. to his Majesty.","This speech was perfectly agreeable to Cacambo. A fondness for roving, for making a name for themselves in their own country, and for boasting of what they had seen in their travels, was so strong in our two wanderers, that they resolved to be no longer happy; and demanded permission of the king to leave the country. “You are about to do a rash and silly thing,” said the king.","This harangue pleased Cacambo; wandering is such pleasure, it gives a man such prestige at home to be able to talk of what he has seen abroad, that the two happy men resolved to be so no longer, but to take their leave of his majesty."
"Candide, chassé du paradis terrestre, marcha longtemps sans savoir où, pleurant, levant les yeux au ciel, les tournant souvent vers le plus beau des châteaux qui renfermait la plus belle des baronnettes; il se coucha sans souper au milieu des champs entre deux sillons; la neige tombait à gros flocons. Candide, tout transi, se traîna le lendemain vers la ville voisine, qui s’appelle Valdberghoff-trarbk-dikdorff, n’ayant point d’argent, mourant de faim et de lassitude. Il s’arrêta tristement à la porte d’un cabaret. Deux hommes habillés de bleu le remarquèrent: « Camarade, dit l’un, voilà un jeune homme très bien fait, et qui a la taille requise. » Ils s’avancèrent vers Candide et le prièrent à dîner très civilement. « Messieurs, leur dit Candide avec une modestie charmante, vous me faites beaucoup d’honneur, mais je n’ai pas de quoi payer mon écot. — Ah! monsieur, lui dit un des bleus, les personnes de votre figure et de votre mérite ne payent jamais rien: n’avez-vous pas cinq pieds cinq pouces de haut? — Oui, messieurs, c’est ma taille, dit-il en faisant la révérence. — Ah! monsieur, mettez-vous à table; non seulement nous vous défrayerons, mais nous ne souffrirons jamais qu’un homme comme vous manque d’argent; les hommes ne sont faits que pour se secourir les uns les autres. — Vous avez raison, dit Candide: c’est ce que M. Pangloss m’a toujours dit, et je vois bien que tout est au mieux. » On le prie d’accepter quelques écus, il les prend et veut faire son billet; on n’en veut point, on se met à table: « N’aimez-vous pas tendrement?… — Oh! oui, répondit-il, j’aime tendrement Mlle Cunégonde. — Non, dit l’un de ces messieurs, nous vous demandons si vous n’aimez pas tendrement le roi des Bulgares. — Point du tout, dit-il, car je ne l’ai jamais vu. — Comment! c’est le plus charmant des rois, et il faut boire à sa santé. — Oh! très volontiers, messieurs »; et il boit. « C’en est assez, lui dit-on, vous voilà l’appui, le soutien, le défenseur, le héros des Bulgares; votre fortune est faite, et votre gloire est assurée. » On lui met sur-le-champ les fers aux pieds, et on le mène au régiment. On le fait tourner à droite, à gauche, hausser la baguette, remettre la baguette, coucher en joue, tirer, doubler le pas, et on lui donne trente coups de bâton; le lendemain il fait l’exercice un peu moins mal, et il ne reçoit que vingt coups; le surlendemain on ne lui en donne que dix, et il est regardé par ses camarades comme un prodige.","Candide, driven from the earthly paradise, walked for a long time without knowing where, weeping, raising his eyes to heaven, often turning them towards the most beautiful of castles which contained the most beautiful of baronettes; he went to bed without supper in the middle of the fields between two furrows; the snow was falling in large flakes. Candide, quite chilled, dragged himself the next day to the neighboring town, which is called Valdberghoff-trarbk-dikdorff, having no money, dying of hunger and weariness. He stopped sadly at the door of a cabaret. Two men dressed in blue noticed him: ""Comrade,"" said one, ""here is a very well made young man, and who has the required size. They approached Candide and invited him to dinner very civilly. “Gentlemen,” said Candide to them with charming modesty, “you do me a lot of honor, but I have not enough to pay my bill. - Ah! sir, said one of the rookies to him, people of your figure and merit never pay anything: aren't you five feet five inches tall? ""Yes, gentlemen, that's my size,"" he said, curtsying. - Ah! sir, sit down to table; not only will we pay for you, but we will never allow a man like you to lack money; men are only made to help one another. ""You're right,"" said Candide; ""that's what M. Pangloss has always told me, and I see that everything is for the best."" We ask him to accept a few crowns, he takes them and wants to make his ticket; we don't want it, we sit down to table: ""Don't you love tenderly?... - Oh! yes, he answered, I love Mademoiselle Cunégonde dearly. “No,” said one of these gentlemen, “we ask you if you are not tenderly in love with the King of the Bulgarians. ""Not at all,"" he said, ""because I've never seen him. - How? 'Or' What! he is the most charming of kings, and we must drink to his health. - Oh! very gladly, gentlemen”; and he drinks. “That is enough,” they say to him, “here you are the support, the support, the defender, the hero of the Bulgarians; your fortune is made, and your glory is assured. They immediately put irons on his feet, and lead him to the regiment. He is made to turn to the right, to the left, to raise the rod, to put back the rod, to take aim, to fire, to double the pace, and he is given thirty strokes of the stick; the next day he does the exercise a little less badly, and he receives only twenty blows; two days later he was only given ten, and he was considered a prodigy by his comrades.","Candide, driven out of this earthly paradise, wandered a long time without knowing where he went; sometimes he raised his eyes, all wet with tears, towards heaven, and sometimes he cast a melancholy look towards the magnificent castle, where the fairest of young baronesses lived. He laid himself down to sleep in a furrow, heart-broken, and supperless. The snow fell in great flakes and in the morning, when he awoke, he was almost frozen to death; however, he dragged himself to the next town, which was called Walds-berghoff-trarbk-dikdorff, without a penny in his pocket, and half dead with hunger and fatigue. He took up his stand at the door of an inn. He had not been long there, before two men dressed in bluec fixed their eyes steadfastly upon him. “Faith, comrade,” said one of them to the other, “there is a well-made young fellow, and of the right size”; upon which they approached Candide, and with the greatest civility and politeness invited him to dine with them. “Gentlemen,” replied Candide, with a most engaging modesty, “you do me much honour; but I really don’t have enough money to pay my share.” “Money, sir,” said one of the blues to him, “young persons of your appearance and merit never pay anything; why, are not you five feet five inches tall?” “Yes, gentlemen, that is really my size,” replied he, with a low bow. “Come then, sir, sit down with us; we will not only pay your bill, but we will never allow such a clever young fellow as you to be short on money. Mankind were born to assist one another.” “You are perfectly right, gentlemen,” said Candide, “this is precisely the doctrine of Master Pangloss ; and I am convinced that everything is for the best.” His generous companions next begged him to accept a few crowns, which he readily complied with, at the same time offering them an I.O.U. for the payment, which they refused, and then sat down at the table together. “Have you not a great affection for———?” “O yes; I have a great affection for the lovely Miss Cunégonde.” “Maybe so,” replied one of the blues; “but that is not the question. We are asking you whether you have not a great affection for the King of the Bulgarians?” “For the King of the Bulgarians?” said Candide. “ Oh, Lord! not at all; why, I never saw him in my life.” “Is it possible! Oh, he is a most charming king. Come, we must drink his health.” “With all my heart, gentlemen,” says Candide, and he drinks his glass. “That will do!” cry the blues; “you are now the support, the defender, the hero of the Bulgarians; your fortune is made; your future is assured.” So saying, they handcuff him, and carry him away to the regiment. There he is made to wheel about to the right, to the left, to draw his rammer, to return his rammer, to present, to fire, to march; and they give him thirty blows with a cane. The next day he performs his exercise a little better, and they give him but twenty. The day after he comes off with ten, and is looked upon as a young fellow of surprising genius by all his comrades.","Candide, ejected from the earthly paradise, wandered for a long time without knowing where he was going, weeping, raising his eyes to heaven, and gazing back frequently on the most beautiful of castles which contained the most beautiful of Baron’s daughters. He slept without eating, in a furrow of a plowed field, while the snow drifted over him; next morning, numb with cold, he dragged himself into the neighboring village, which was called Waldberghofftrarbk-dikdorff; he was penniless, famished, and exhausted. At the door of a tavern he paused forlornly. Two men dressed in blue7 took note of him: —Look, chum, said one of them, there’s a likely young fellow of just about the right size. They approached Candide and invited him very politely to dine with them. —Gentlemen, Candide replied with charming modesty, I’m honored by your invitation, but I really don’t have enough money to pay my share. —My dear sir, said one of the blues, people of your appearance and your merit don’t have to pay; aren’t you five feet five inches tall? —Yes, gentlemen, that is indeed my stature, said he, making a bow. —Then, sir, you must be seated at once; not only will we pay your bill this time , we will never allow a man like you to be short of money; for men were made only to render one another mutual aid. —You are quite right, said Candide; it is just as Dr. Pangloss always told me, and I see clearly that everything is for the best. They beg him to accept a couple of crowns, he takes them, and offers an I.O.U.; they won’t hear of it, and all sit down at table together. —Don’t you love dearly … ? —I do indeed, says he, I dearly love Miss Cunégonde. —No, no, says one of the gentlemen, we are asking if you don’t love dearly the King of the Bulgars. —Not in the least, says he, I never laid eyes on him. —What’s that you say? He’s the most charming of kings, and we must drink his health. —Oh, gladly, gentlemen; and he drinks. —That will do, they tell him; you are now the bulwark, the support, the defender, the hero of the Bulgars; your fortune is made and your future assured. Promptly they slip irons on his legs and lead him to the regiment. There they cause him to right face, left face, present arms, order arms, aim, fire, doubletime, and they give him thirty strokes of the rod. Next day he does the drill a little less awkwardly and gets only twenty strokes; the third day, they give him only ten, and he is regarded by his comrades as a prodigy."
"« Je ne vous dirai point combien il est dur pour une jeune princesse d’être menée esclave à Maroc avec sa mère. Vous concevez assez tout ce que nous eûmes à souffrir dans le vaisseau corsaire. Ma mère était encore très belle; nos filles d’honneur, nos simples femmes de chambre, avaient plus de charmes qu’on n’en peut trouver dans toute l’Afrique. Pour moi, j’étais ravissante, j’étais la beauté, la grâce même, et j’étais pucelle; je ne le fus pas longtemps: cette fleur qui avait été réservée pour le beau prince de Massa-Carrara me fut ravie par le capitaine corsaire; c’était un nègre abominable, qui croyait encore me faire beaucoup d’honneur. Certes, il fallait que Mme la princesse de Palestrine et moi fussions bien fortes pour résister à tout ce que nous éprouvâmes jusqu’à notre arrivée à Maroc. Mais passons; ce sont des choses si communes qu’elles ne valent pas la peine qu’on en parle.","“I will not tell you how hard it is for a young princess to be taken as a slave to Morocco with her mother. You can easily imagine how much we had to suffer in the corsair ship. My mother was still very beautiful; our maids of honor, our simple maids, had more charms than can be found in all Africa. For me, I was ravishing, I was beauty, grace itself, and I was a maiden; I was not one for long: this flower which had been reserved for the handsome Prince of Massa-Carrara was stolen from me by the corsair captain; he was an abominable negro, who still thought he was doing me a great deal of honour. Certainly, the Princess of Palestine and I had to be very strong to resist all that we experienced until our arrival in Morocco. But let's move on; these are things so common that they are not worth talking about.","I need not tell you how great a hardship it was for a young princess and her mother to be made slaves and carried to Morocco. You may easily imagine that we must have suffered on board the pirate ship. My mother was still extremely handsome, our maids of honour, and even our common waiting-women had more charms than were to be found in all Africa. As to myself, I was enchanting; I was beauty itself, and then I had my innocence. But alas! I did not retain it long; this precious flower, which was reserved for the lovely prince of Massa Carara, was plucked by the captain of the Moorish vessel, who was a hideous negro, and thought he did me infinite honour. Indeed, both the Princess of Palestrina and myself must have been very strong indeed to undergo all the hardships and violences we suffered till our arrival at Morocco. But I will not detain you any longer with such common things; they are hardly worth mentioning.","—I won’t try to explain how painful it is for a young princess to be carried off into slavery in Morocco with her mother. You can imagine everything we had to suffer on the pirate ship. My mother was still very beautiful; our maids of honor, our mere chambermaids, were more charming than anything one could find in all Africa. As for myself, I was ravishing, I was loveliness and grace supreme, and I was a virgin. I did not remain so for long; the flower which had been kept for the handsome prince of Massa-Carrara was plucked by the corsair captain; he was an abominable negro, who thought he was doing me a great favor. My Lady the Princess of Palestrina and I must have been strong indeed to bear what we did during our journey to Morocco. But on with my story; these are such common matters that they are not worth describing."

"La vieille dit à Cunégonde: « Mademoiselle, vous avez soixante et douze quartiers, et pas une obole; il ne tient qu’à vous d’être la femme du plus grand seigneur de l’Amérique méridionale, qui a une très belle moustache; est-ce à vous de vous piquer d’une fidélité à toute épreuve? Vous avez été violée par les Bulgares; un Juif et un inquisiteur ont eu vos bonnes grâces: les malheurs donnent des droits. J’avoue que, si j’étais à votre place, je ne ferais aucun scrupule d’épouser monsieur le gouverneur et de faire la fortune de M. le capitaine Candide. » Tandis que la vieille parlait avec toute la prudence que l’âge et l’expérience donnent, on vit entrer dans le port un petit vaisseau; il portait un alcade et des alguazils, et voici ce qui était arrivé:","The old woman said to Cunégonde: “Mademoiselle, you have seventy-two quarters, and not an obol; it is up to you to be the wife of the greatest lord of South America, who has a very beautiful mustache; is it up to you to pride yourself on unfailing fidelity? You were raped by the Bulgarians; a Jew and an inquisitor have had your good graces: misfortunes give rights. I confess that, if I were in your place, I would have no scruple about marrying the Governor and making the fortune of Captain Candide. While the old woman was talking with all the prudence that age and experience give, a small vessel was seen entering the port; he wore an alcalde and alguazils, and this is what happened:","Miss, you have seventy-two quarterings in your arms, it is true, but you do not have a penny. It is your own fault if you are not wife to one of the greatest nobleman in South America, with an exceedingly fine mustachio. Are you going to insist on an absolute fidelity? You have been ravished by a Bulgarian soldier; a Jew and an Inquisitor have both tasted of your favours. People take advantage of misfortunes. I must confess, if I were in your place I would without the least scruple give my hand to the Governor, and make the fortune of the brave Captain Candide.” While the old woman was thus haranguing, with all the prudence that old age and experience furnish, a small ship entered the harbour, bearing an alcaydeap and his alguazils.aq And here is what happened:","My lady, you have seventy-two quarterings and not one penny; if you wish, you may be the wife of the greatest lord in South America, who has a really handsome moustache; are you going to insist on your absolute fidelity? You have already been raped by the Bulgars; a jew and an inquisitor have enjoyed your favors; miseries entitle one to privileges. I assure you that in your position I would make no scruple of marrying my lord the Governor, and making the fortune of Captain Candide. While the old woman was talking with all the prudence of age and experience, there came into the harbor a small ship bearing an alcalde and some alguazils.43 This is what had happened."
"Après le tremblement de terre qui avait détruit les trois quarts de Lisbonne, les sages du pays n’avaient pas trouvé un moyen plus efficace pour prévenir une ruine totale que de donner au peuple un bel auto-da-fé; il était décidé par l’université de Coïmbre que le spectacle de quelques personnes brûlées à petit feu, en grande cérémonie, est un secret infaillible pour empêcher la terre de trembler.","After the earthquake which had destroyed three-quarters of Lisbon, the wise men of the country had not found a more effective means of preventing total ruin than to give the people a fine auto-da-fé; it was decided by the University of Coimbra that the spectacle of a few people being burned slowly, in great ceremony, is an infallible secret to prevent the earth from shaking.","After the earthquake, which had destroyed three-fourths of the city of Lisbon, the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to preserve the kingdom from utter ruin than to entertain the people with an auto-da-fé, it having been decided by the University of Coimbra that burning a few people alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible secret for preventing earthquakes.","After the earthquake had wiped out three quarters of Lisbon, the learned men of the land could find no more effective way of averting total destruction than to give the people a fine auto-da-fé;22 the University of Coimbra had established that the spectacle of several persons being roasted over a slow fire with full ceremonial rites is an infallible specific against earthquakes."
"« Je crois, dit l’abbé, que Mlle Cunégonde a bien de l’esprit, et qu’elle écrit des lettres charmantes? — Je n’en ai jamais reçu, dit Candide; car figurez-vous qu’ayant été chassé du château pour l’amour d’elle, je ne pus lui écrire; que bientôt après j’appris qu’elle était morte, qu’ensuite je la retrouvai, et que je la perdis, et que je lui ai envoyé à deux mille cinq cents lieues d’ici un exprès dont j’attends la réponse. »","""I believe,"" said the abbé, ""that Mademoiselle Cunégonde has a lot of wit, and that she writes charming letters?"" ""I never received any,"" said Candide; for imagine that, having been driven from the chateau for love of her, I could not write to her; that soon after I learned that she was dead, that afterwards I found her, and that I lost her, and that I sent her two thousand five hundred leagues from here an express whose answer I am awaiting. »","“I suppose,” said the Abbé, “Miss Cunégonde has a great deal of wit, and that her letters must be very entertaining.” “I never received any from her,” said Candide, “for as you can imagine, being expelled from the castle on her account , I could not write to her especially because soon after my departure I heard that she was dead; but, thank God, I found out afterwards that she was living. I left her again after this, and now I have sent a messenger to her nearly two thousand leagues from here, and I am waiting here for his return with an answer from her.”","—I suppose, said the abbé, that Miss Cunégonde has a fine wit and writes charming letters. —I never received a single letter from her, said Candide; for, as you can imagine, after being driven out of the castle for love of her, I couldn’t write; shortly I learned that she was dead; then I rediscovered her; then I lost her again, and I have now sent, to a place more than twenty-five hundred leagues from here, a special agent whose return I am expecting."
"C’est ainsi que Candide, Martin et le Périgourdin raisonnaient sur l’escalier, en voyant défiler le monde au sortir de la pièce. « Quoique je sois très empressé de revoir Mlle Cunégonde, dit Candide, je voudrais pourtant souper avec Mlle Clairon; car elle m’a paru admirable. »","This is how Candide, Martin and the Périgourdin reasoned on the stairs, watching the world pass by as they left the room. “Although I am very anxious to see Mlle Cunegonde again,” said Candide, “I would like to have supper with Mlle Clairon; because it seemed to me admirable. »","THE ILLNESS OF CANDIDE IN PARIS Candide, Martin, and the Abbé of Perigord argued on the staircase while they watched the crowd leaving the theater. “Though I am in a great hurry to see Miss Cunégonde again,” said Candide, “I also have a great inclination to dine with Miss Clairon, for I am really much taken with her.”","It was after this fashion that Candide, Martin, and the abbé from Perigord chatted on the stairway as they watched the crowd leaving the theatre. —Although I’m in a great hurry to see Miss Cunégonde again, said Candide, I would very much like to dine with Miss Clairon,78 for she seemed to me admirable."
"Cacambo, qui versait à boire à l’un de ces six étrangers, s’approcha de l’oreille de son maître, sur la fin du repas, et lui dit: « Sire, Votre Majesté partira quand elle voudra, le vaisseau est prêt. » Ayant dit ces mots, il sortit. Les convives, étonnés, se regardaient sans proférer une seule parole, lorsqu’un autre domestique, s’approchant de son maître, lui dit: « Sire, la chaise de Votre Majesté est à Padoue, et la barque est prête. » Le maître fit un signe, et le domestique partit. Tous les convives se regardèrent encore, et la surprise commune redoubla. Un troisième valet, s’approchant aussi d’un troisième étranger, lui dit: « Sire, croyez-moi, Votre Majesté ne doit pas rester ici plus longtemps: je vais tout préparer; » et aussitôt il disparut.","Cacambo, who was pouring a drink for one of these six strangers, approached his master's ear, at the end of the meal, and said to him: ""Sire, Your Majesty will leave when you wish, the vessel is ready. . Having said these words, he left. The guests, astonished, looked at each other without uttering a single word, when another servant, approaching his master, said to him: ""Sire, your Majesty's chair is in Padua, and the boat is ready."" The master made a sign, and the servant departed. All the guests looked at each other again, and the common surprise redoubled. A third valet, also approaching a third stranger, said to him: “Sire, believe me, Your Majesty must not stay here any longer: I will prepare everything; and immediately he disappeared.","Cacambo, who was pouring a drink for one of these strangers, drew near to his master when the meal was nearly over, and whispered to him in the ear, “Sire, your majesty may go when you please; the ship is ready”; and so saying, he left the room. The guests, surprised at what they had heard, looked at each other without speaking a word, when another servant drawing near to his master, in like manner said, “Sire, your majesty’s post-chaise is at Padua, and the bark is ready.” The master made a sign and the servant instantly withdrew. The diners all stared at each other again, and the general astonishment was increased. A third servant then approached another of the strangers, and said, “Sire, believe me, your Majesty should not stay here any longer; I will go and get everything ready,” and instantly disappeared.","Cacambo, who was pouring wine for one of the strangers, leaned respectfully over his master at the end of the meal, and said to him: —Sire, Your Majesty may leave when he pleases, the vessel is ready. Having said these words, he exited. The diners looked at one another in silent amazement, when another servant, approaching his master, said to him: —Sire, Your Majesty’s litter is at Padua, and the bark awaits you. The master nodded, and the servant vanished. All the diners looked at one another again, and the general amazement redoubled. A third servant, approaching a third stranger, said to him: — Sire, take my word for it, Your Majesty must stay here no longer; I shall get everything ready."
"Il tomba dans une mélancolie noire, et ne prit aucune part a l’opéra alla moda ni aux autres divertissements du carnaval; pas une dame ne lui donna la moindre tentation. Martin lui dit: « Vous êtes bien simple, en vérité, de vous figurer qu’un valet métis, qui a cinq ou six millions dans ses poches, ira chercher votre maîtresse au bout du monde et vous l’amènera à Venise. Il la prendra pour lui, s’il la trouve. S’il ne la trouve pas, il en prendra une autre: je vous conseille d’oublier votre valet Cacambo et votre maîtresse Cunégonde. » Martin n’était pas consolant. La mélancolie de Candide augmenta, et Martin ne cessait de lui prouver qu’il y avait peu de vertu et peu de bonheur sur la terre, excepté peut-être dans Eldorado, où personne ne pouvait aller.","He fell into a black melancholy, and took no part in the opera alla moda nor in the other carnival amusements; not a lady gave him the slightest temptation. Martin said to him: ""You are very simple, in truth, to imagine that a mixed-race valet, who has five or six millions in his pockets, will go and fetch your mistress at the end of the world and bring her to you in Venice. He will take her for himself, if he finds her. If he does not find it, he will take another: I advise you to forget your valet Cacambo and your mistress Cunegonde. Martin was not consoling. Candide's melancholy increased, and Martin kept proving to her that there was little virtue and little happiness on earth, except perhaps in Eldorado, where no one could go.","He fell into a deep melancholy, and neither went to the fashionable operas, nor took part in any of the diversions of the Carnival: not a single woman tempted him in the least bit. Martin said to him, “I think you are very foolish to imagine that a rascally valet, with five or six millions in his pocket, would go in search of your mistress to the far end of the world, and bring her to Venice to meet you. If he finds her, he will take her for himself; if he does not, he will take another. Let me advise you to forget your valet Cacambo, and your mistress Cunégonde.” Martin’s speech was not the most consolatory to the dejected Candide. His melancholy increased, and Martin never tired of showing him, that there is very little virtue or happiness in this world—except, perhaps in El Dorado, where hardly anybody can go.","He fell into a black melancholy, and refused to attend the fashionable operas or take part in the other diversions of the carnival season; not a single lady tempted him in the slightest. Martin told him: —You’re a real simpleton if you think a half-breed valet with five or six millions in his pockets will go to the end of the world to get your mistress and bring her to Venice for you. If he finds her, he’ll take her for himself; if he doesn’t, he’ll take another. I advise you to forget about your servant Cacambo and your mistress Cunégonde. Martin was not very comforting. Candide’s melancholy increased, and Martin never wearied of showing him that there is little virtue and little happiness on this earth, except perhaps in Eldorado, where nobody can go."

"Candide, malgré tant de malheurs, mangea et dormit. Le lendemain la vieille lui apporte à déjeuner, visite son dos, le frotte elle-même d’une autre pommade; elle lui apporte ensuite à dîner; elle revient sur le soir, et apporte à souper. Le surlendemain elle fit encore les mêmes cérémonies. « Qui êtes-vous? lui disait toujours Candide; qui vous a inspiré tant de bonté? quelles grâces puis-je vous rendre? » La bonne femme ne répondait jamais rien; elle revint sur le soir et n’apporta point à souper. « Venez avec moi, dit-elle, et ne dites mot. » Elle le prend sous le bras, et marche avec lui dans la campagne environ un quart de mille: ils arrivent à une maison isolée, entourée de jardins et de canaux. La vieille frappe à une petite porte. On ouvre; elle mène Candide, par un escalier dérobé, dans un cabinet doré, le laisse sur un canapé de brocart, referme la porte, et s’en va. Candide croyait rêver, et regardait toute sa vie comme un songe funeste, et le moment présent comme un songe agréable.","Candide, despite so many misfortunes, ate and slept. The next day the old woman brings him lunch, inspects his back, rubs it herself with another ointment; she then brings him dinner; she returns in the evening, and brings supper. Two days later she performed the same ceremonies again. "" Who are you? Candide always said to him; who inspired you with so much goodness? what thanks can I give you? The good woman never answered anything; she returned in the evening and brought no supper. “Come with me,” she said, “and don't say a word. She takes him under the arm, and walks with him through the country for about a quarter of a mile: they come to an isolated house, surrounded by gardens and canals. The old woman knocks on a small door. We open; she leads Candide, by a hidden staircase, into a gilded cabinet, leaves him on a brocade sofa, closes the door, and leaves. Candide thought he was dreaming, and regarded his whole life as a fatal dream, and the present moment as a pleasant dream.","Candide, in spite of his sufferings, ate and slept. The next morning the old woman brought him breakfast, examined his back, and rubbed it herself with another ointment. She returned at the proper time and brought him lunch, and at night she visited him again with supper. The next day she repeated the routine. “Who are you?” said Candide to her. “What God has inspired you with so much goodness? How can I repay you for this charitable assistance?” The good old woman kept a profound silence. In the evening she returned, but without his supper. “Come along with me,” said she, “but do not speak a word.” She took him under her arm, and walked with him about a quarter of a mile into the country, till they came to a lonely house surrounded with moats and gardens. The old woman knocked at a little door, which was immediately opened, and she took him up a pair of back-stairs into a small but richly furnished apartment. There she made him sit down on a brocaded sofa; she closed the door, and left him. Candide thought he was in a trance; he looked upon his whole life up to this point as a frightful dream, and the present moment a very agreeable one.","In spite of his many sufferings, Candide ate and slept. Next day the old woman returned bringing breakfast; she looked at his back and rubbed it herself with another ointment; she came back with lunch; and then she returned in the evening, bringing supper. Next day she repeated the same routine. —Who are you? Candide asked continually. Who told you to be so kind to me? How can I ever repay you? The good woman answered not a word; she returned in the evening, and without food. —Come with me, says she, and don’t speak a word. Taking him by the hand, she walks out into the countryside with him for about a quarter of a mile; they reach an isolated house, quite surrounded by gardens and ditches. The old woman knocks at a little gate, it opens. She takes Candide up a secret stairway to a gilded room furnished with a fine brocaded sofa; there she leaves him, closes the door, disappears. Candide stood as if entranced; his life, which had seemed like a nightmare so far, was now starting to look like a delightful dream."
"Les voyageurs ne manquèrent pas de ramasser l’or, les rubis et les émeraudes. « Où sommes-nous? s’écria Candide; il faut que les enfants des rois de ce pays soient bien élevés, puisqu’on leur apprend à mépriser l’or et les pierreries. » Cacambo était aussi surpris que Candide. Ils approchèrent enfin de la première maison du village; elle était bâtie comme un palais d’Europe. Une foule de monde s’empressait à la porte, et encore plus dans le logis. Une musique très agréable se faisait entendre, et une odeur délicieuse de cuisine se faisait sentir. Cacambo s’approcha de la porte, et entendit qu’on parlait péruvien; c’était sa langue maternelle: car tout le monde sait que Cacambo était né au Tucuman, dans un village où l’on ne connaissait que cette langue. « Je vous servirai d’interprète, dit-il à Candide; entrons, c’est ici un cabaret. »","Travelers did not fail to pick up gold, rubies and emeralds. "" Where are we? exclaimed Candide; the children of the kings of this country must be well brought up, since they are taught to despise gold and precious stones. Cacambo was as surprised as Candide. They finally approached the first house in the village; it was built like a European palace. A crowd of people was hurrying to the door, and still more into the house. Very pleasant music was heard, and a delicious smell of cooking was felt. Cacambo approached the door, and heard that they were speaking Peruvian; it was his mother tongue: because everyone knows that Cacambo was born in Tucuman, in a village where only that language was known. “I will act as your interpreter,” he said to Candide; let's go in, this is a cabaret. »","Our travellers took care, however, to gather up the gold, the rubies and the emeralds. “Where are we?” cried Candide: “ The king’s children in this country must have an excellent education, since they are taught to show such a contempt for gold and precious stones.” Cacambo was as much surprised as his master. At last they came to the first house in the village, which was built in the manner of a European palace. There was a crowd of people around the door, and a still greater number in the house. The sound of the most delightful instruments of music was heard, and a delicious aroma came from the kitchen. Cacambo went up to the door and heard those within talking in Peruvian, which was his mother tongue; for Cacambo was born in the village of Tucuman, where no other language is spoken. “I will be your interpreter here,” he said to Candide “let’s go in; this is an eating-house.”","The travelers did not fail to pick up the gold, rubies, and emeralds. —Where in the world are we? cried Candide. The children of this land must be well trained, since they are taught contempt for gold and jewels.56 Cacambo was as much surprised as Candide. At last they came to the finest house of the village; it was built like a European palace. A crowd of people surrounded the door, and even more were in the entry; delightful music was heard, and a delicious aroma of cooking filled the air. Cacambo went up to the door, listened, and reported that they were talking Peruvian; that was his native language, for every reader must know that Cacambo was born in Tucuman, in a village where they talk that language exclusively.57 —I’ll act as interpreter, he told Candide; it’s an hotel, let’s go in."
"Candide, après le déjeuner, se promenant dans une longue galerie, fut surpris de la beauté des tableaux. Il demanda de quel maître étaient les deux premiers. « Ils sont de Raphaël, dit le sénateur; je les achetai fort cher par vanité il y a quelques années; on dit que c’est ce qu’il y a de plus beau en Italie, mais ils ne me plaisent point du tout: la couleur en est très rembrunie; les figures ne sont pas assez arrondies, et ne sortent point assez; les draperies ne ressemblent en rien à une étoffe; en un mot, quoi qu’on en dise, je ne trouve point là une imitation vraie de la nature. Je n’aimerai un tableau que quand je croirai voir la nature elle-même: il n’y en a point de cette espèce. J’ai beaucoup de tableaux mais je ne les regarde plus. »","Candide, after lunch, walking through a long gallery, was surprised at the beauty of the pictures. He asked whose master the first two were. ""They are by Raphael,"" said the senator; I bought them at a high price out of vanity a few years ago; they say they are the most beautiful in Italy, but I don't like them at all: the color is very dull; the figures are not rounded enough, and do not stand out enough; the draperies bear no resemblance to cloth; in a word, whatever one may say, I do not find there a true imitation of nature. I will only love a painting when I believe I see nature itself: there is none of this kind. I have a lot of paintings but I don't look at them anymore. »","After lunch, Candide walked through a large gallery, where he was amazed by the beauty of the paintings. Candide asked who the painter of the two finest was. “They are Raphael’s,”bs answered the senator. “I spent a great deal of money on them seven years ago, purely out of curiosity as they were said to be the finest pieces in Italy; but I cannot say they please me; the colouring is dark and heavy; the figures do not swell or come out enough; and the drapery is very bad. In short, regardless of the praises lavished upon them, they are not, in my opinion, a true representation of nature. I approveof no paintings except those where I think I see Nature herself ; and there are very few, if any, of that kind. I have what is called a fine collection, but I take no manner of delight in them.”","After lunch, Candide strolled through a long gallery, and was amazed at the beauty of the pictures. He asked who was the painter of the two finest. —They are by Raphael,93 said the senator; I bought them for a lot of money, out of vanity, some years ago; people say they’re the finest in Italy, but they don’t please me at all; the colors have all turned brown, the figures aren’t well modeled and don’t stand out enough, the draperies bear no resemblance to real cloth. In a word, whatever people may say, I don’t find in them a real imitation of nature. I like a picture only when I can see in it a touch of nature itself, and there are none of this sort. I have many paintings, but I no longer look at them."

"« Pardon, encore une fois, dit Candide au baron; pardon, mon Révérend Père, de vous avoir donné un grand coup d’épée au travers du corps. — N’en parlons plus, dit le baron; je fus un peu trop vif, je l’avoue; mais, puisque vous voulez savoir par quel hasard vous m’avez vu aux galères, je vous dirai qu’après avoir été guéri de ma blessure par le frère apothicaire du collège, je fus attaqué et enlevé par un parti espagnol; on me mit en prison à Buenos-Ayres dans le temps que ma soeur venait d’en partir. Je demandai à retourner à Rome auprès du père général. Je fus nommé pour aller servir d’aumônier à Constantinople auprès de M. l’ambassadeur de France. Il n’y avait pas huit jours que j’étais entré en fonctions, quand je trouvai sur le soir un jeune icoglan très bien fait. Il faisait fort chaud: le jeune homme voulut se baigner; je pris cette occasion de me baigner aussi. Je ne savais pas que ce fût un crime capital pour un chrétien d’être trouvé tout nu avec un jeune musulman. Un cadi me fit donner cent coups de bâton sous la plante des pieds et me condamna aux galères. Je ne crois pas qu’on ait fait une plus horrible injustice. Mais je voudrais bien savoir pourquoi ma soeur est dans la cuisine d’un souverain de Transylvanie réfugié chez les Turcs.","""Excuse me, once again,"" said Candide to the baron; Pardon me, my Reverend Father, for having given you a great blow of the sword through the body. ""Let's say no more about it,"" said the baron; I was a little too lively, I confess; but, since you want to know by what chance you saw me in the galleys, I will tell you that after having been cured of my wound by the apothecary brother of the college, I was attacked and kidnapped by a Spanish party; I was put in prison at Buenos Ayres when my sister had just left. I asked to return to Rome to the Father General. I was appointed to serve as chaplain in Constantinople to the French ambassador. It had been less than a week since I had taken up my duties when I found a very well-built young icoglan that evening. It was very hot: the young man wanted to bathe; I took this opportunity to bathe too. I did not know that it was a capital crime for a Christian to be found naked with a young Muslim. A cadi had me give a hundred blows with a stick under the soles of my feet and condemned me to the galleys. I don't think a more horrible injustice has been done. But I would like to know why my sister is in the kitchen of a sovereign of Transylvania who has taken refuge with the Turks.","“Pardon me,” said Candide to the Baron; “once more let me beg your pardon, reverend father, for having run you through the body with my sword.” “Say no more about it,” replied the Baron; “I was a little too hasty, I admit. But as you seem to want to know how I came to be a slave on board the galley where you saw me, I will tell you. After I had been cured of the wound you gave me by the college apothecary, I was attacked and carried off by a party of Spanish troops, who put me in prison in Buenos Ayres, at the very time my sister was leaving there. I asked permission to return to Rome, from the general of my order. He instead appointed me chaplain to the French ambassador at Constantinople. I had not been a week in my new office when I happened to meet one evening a young Icoglan, ck who was extremely handsome and well made. The weather was very hot; the young man wanted to swim. I took the opportunity to swim with him. I did not know it was a crime for a Christian to be found naked with a young Turk. A cadi sentenced me to receive a hundred blows on the soles of my feet, and sent me to the galleys. I do not believe there was ever an act of more flagrant injustice. But I would like to know how my sister came to be a kitchen maid to a Transylvanian prince who had taken refuge among the Turks.”","—Let me beg your pardon once more, said Candide to the baron, pardon me, reverend father, for having run you through the body with my sword. —Don’t mention it, replied the baron. I was a little too hasty myself, I confess it; but since you want to know the misfortune which brought me to the galleys, I’ll tell you. After being cured of my wound by the brother who was apothecary to the college, I was attacked and abducted by a Spanish raiding party; they jailed me in Buenos Aires at the time when my sister had just left. I asked to be sent to Rome, to the father general. Instead, I was named to serve as almoner in Constantinople, under the French ambassador. I had not been a week on this job when I chanced one evening on a very handsome young ichoglan.110 The evening was hot; the young man wanted to take a swim; I seized the occasion, and went with him. I did not know that it is a capital offense for a Christian to be found naked with a young Moslem. A cadi sentenced me to receive a hundred blows with a cane on the soles of my feet, and then to be sent to the galleys. I don’t suppose there was ever such a horrible miscarriage of justice. But I would like to know why my sister is in the kitchen of a Transylvanian king exiled among Turks."
"Ce savant, qui était d’ailleurs un bon homme, avait été volé par sa femme, battu par son fils, et abandonné de sa fille qui s’était fait enlever par un Portugais. Il venait d’être privé d’un petit emploi duquel il subsistait; et les prédicants de Surinam le persécutaient parce qu’ils le prenaient pour un socinien. Il faut avouer que les autres étaient pour le moins aussi malheureux que lui; mais Candide espérait que le savant le désennuierait dans le voyage.

"« J’ai vu dans les pays que le sort m’a fait parcourir, et dans les cabarets où j’ai servi, un nombre prodigieux de personnes qui avaient leur existence en exécration; mais je n’en ai vu que douze qui aient mis volontairement fin à leur misère: trois nègres, quatre Anglais, quatre Genevois et un professeur allemand nommé Robeck. J’ai fini par être servante chez le Juif don Issacar; il me mit auprès de vous, ma belle demoiselle; je me suis attachée à votre destinée, et j’ai été plus occupée de vos aventures que des miennes. Je ne vous aurais même jamais parlé de mes malheurs, si vous ne m’aviez pas un peu piquée, et s’il n’était d’usage dans un vaisseau de conter des histoires pour se désennuyer. Enfin, mademoiselle, j’ai de l’expérience, je connais le monde; donnez-vous un plaisir, engagez chaque passager à vous conter son histoire; et s’il s’en trouve un seul qui n’ait souvent maudit sa vie, qui ne se soit souvent dit à lui-même qu’il était le plus malheureux des hommes, jetez-moi dans la mer la tête la première. »","“I saw in the countries that fate made me travel, and in the cabarets where I served, a prodigious number of people who had their existence in execration; but I have only seen twelve who have voluntarily put an end to their misery: three Negroes, four English, four Genevans and a German professor named Robeck. I ended up being a servant to the Jew don Issachar; he placed me near you, my beautiful young lady; I have attached myself to your destiny, and I have been more occupied with your adventures than with mine. I would never even have spoken to you of my misfortunes if you hadn't piqued me a little, and if it hadn't been customary in a ship to tell stories to get bored.

"« Étonnée et ravie d’entendre la langue de ma patrie, et non moins surprise des paroles que proférait cet homme, je lui répondis qu’il y avait de plus grands malheurs que celui dont il se plaignait. Je l’instruisis en peu de mots des horreurs que j’avais essuyées, et je retombai en faiblesse. Il m’emporta dans une maison voisine, me fit mettre au lit, me fit donner à manger, me servit, me consola, me flatta, me dit qu’il n’avait rien vu de si beau que moi, et que jamais il n’avait tant regretté ce que personne ne pouvait lui rendre. « Je suis né à Naples, me dit-il, on y chaponne deux ou trois mille enfants tous les ans; les uns en meurent, les autres acquièrent une voix plus belle que celle des femmes, les autres vont gouverner les États. On me fit cette opération avec un très grand succès, et j’ai été musicien de la chapelle de Mme la princesse de Palestrine. — De ma mère! m’écriai-je. — De votre mère! s’écria-t-il en pleurant. Quoi! vous seriez cette jeune princesse que j’ai élevée jusqu’à l’âge de six ans, et qui promettait déjà d’être aussi belle que vous êtes? — C’est moi-même; ma mère est à quatre cents pas d’ici, coupée en quartiers sous un tas de morts… »","“Amazed and delighted to hear the language of my country, and no less surprised at the words that this man uttered, I answered him that there were greater misfortunes than the one of which he complained. I informed him in a few words of the horrors I had suffered, and I fell back into weakness. He took me to a neighboring house, put me to bed, fed me, served me, consoled me, flattered me, told me that he had never seen anything so beautiful as me, and that he never had regretted so much what no one could return to him. ""I was born in Naples,"" he told me, ""two or three thousand children are kept there every year; some die of it, others acquire a voice more beautiful than that of women, others go to govern the States.

"— Mais regardez ces gondoliers, dit Candide; ne chantent-ils pas sans cesse? — Vous ne les voyez pas dans leur ménage, avec leurs femmes et leurs marmots d’enfants, dit Martin. Le doge a ses chagrins, les gondoliers ont les leurs. Il est vrai qu’à tout prendre le sort d’un gondolier est préférable à celui d’un doge; mais je crois la différence si médiocre que cela ne vaut pas la peine d’être examiné.","""But look at those gondoliers,"" said Candide; do they not sing incessantly? ""You don't see them in their household, with their wives and their brats of children,"" said Martin. The doge has his sorrows, the gondoliers have theirs. It is true that all in all the fate of a gondolier is preferable to that of a doge; but I believe the difference so mediocre that it is not worth considering.","“Observe those gondoliers,” said Candide; “aren’t they always singing?” “You do not see them,” answered Martin, “at home with their wives and brats. The dogebq has his chagrin, gondoliers theirs. Nevertheless, in general I look upon the gondolier’s life as preferable to that of the doge; but the difference is so trifling that it is not worth the trouble of looking into it.”","—But look at these gondoliers, said Candide; aren’t they always singing? —You don’t see them at home, said Martin, with their wives and squalling children.

"Candide, dans le fond de son coeur, n’avait aucune envie d’épouser Cunégonde. Mais l’impertinence extrême du baron le déterminait à conclure le mariage, et Cunégonde le pressait si vivement qu’il ne pouvait s’en dédire. Il consulta Pangloss, Martin et le fidèle Cacambo. Pangloss fit un beau mémoire par lequel il prouvait que le baron n’avait nul droit sur sa soeur, et qu’elle pouvait, selon toutes les lois de l’Empire, épouser Candide de la main gauche. Martin conclut à jeter le baron dans la mer. Cacambo décida qu’il fallait le rendre au levanti patron et le remettre aux galères; après quoi on l’enverrait à Rome au père général par le premier vaisseau. L’avis fut trouvé fort bon; la vieille l’approuva; on n’en dit rien à sa soeur; la chose fut exécutée pour quelque argent, et on eut le plaisir d’attraper un jésuite et de punir l’orgueil d’un baron allemand.","Candide, in the bottom of his heart, had no desire to marry Cunégonde.

Pangloss wrote a fine memoir by which he proved that the Baron had no right over his sister, and that she could, according to all the laws of the Empire, marry Candide with her left hand.

"La moitié des passagers, affaiblis, expirants de ces angoisses inconcevables que le roulis d’un vaisseau porte dans les nerfs et dans toutes les humeurs du corps agitées en sens contraire, n’avait pas même la force de s’inquiéter du danger. L’autre moitié jetait des cris et faisait des prières; les voiles étaient déchirées, les mâts brisés, le vaisseau entrouvert. Travaillait qui pouvait, personne ne s’entendait, personne ne commandait. L’anabaptiste aidait un peu à la manoeuvre; il était sur le tillac; un matelot furieux le frappe rudement et l’étend sur les planches; mais du coup qu’il lui donna il eut lui-même une si violente secousse qu’il tomba hors du vaisseau la tête la première. Il restait suspendu et accroché à une partie de mât rompue. Le bon Jacques court à son secours, l’aide à remonter, et de l’effort qu’il fit il est précipité dans la mer à la vue du matelot, qui le laissa périr, sans daigner seulement le regarder. Candide approche, voit son bienfaiteur qui reparaît un moment et qui est englouti pour jamais. Il veut se jeter après lui dans la mer; le philosophe Pangloss l’en empêche, en lui prouvant que la rade de Lisbonne avait été formée exprès pour que cet anabaptiste s’y noyât. Tandis qu’il le prouvait a priori, le vaisseau s’entrouvre, tout périt à la réserve de Pangloss, de Candide, et de ce brutal de matelot qui avait noyé le vertueux anabaptiste; le coquin nagea heureusement jusqu’au rivage où Pangloss et Candide furent portés sur une planche.","Half of the passengers, weakened, expiring from those inconceivable anguish which the roll of a ship carries to the nerves and to all the humors of the body agitated in opposite directions, had not even the strength to worry about the danger. The other half cried out and prayed; the sails were torn, the masts broken, the ship ajar. Worked who could, no one got along, no one ordered. The Anabaptist helped a little with the maneuver; he was on the deck; a furious sailor strikes him roughly and stretches him on the planks; but from the blow he gave her he himself had such a violent shock that he fell headlong out of the vessel. It remained suspended and attached to a broken part of the mast. The good Jacques runs to his aid, helps him up, and from the effort he makes he is thrown into the sea at the sight of the sailor, who lets him perish, without even deigning to look at him. Candide approaches, sees his benefactor who reappears for a moment and who is swallowed up forever. He wants to throw himself into the sea after him; the philosopher Pangloss prevents him, by proving to him that the harbor of Lisbon had been formed expressly so that this Anabaptist should drown there. While he was proving it a priori, the vessel half-opened, everything perished except for Pangloss, Candide, and that brutal sailor who had drowned the virtuous Anabaptist; the rascal luckily swam to shore where Pangloss and Candide were carried on a plank.","One-half of the passengers, weakened and half-dead with the inconceivable anxiety and sickness which the rolling of a vessel at sea occasions through the whole human frame, were incapable of noticing the danger that surrounded them. The other half made loud outcries, or fell to their prayers. The sails were ripped to shreds, and the masts were toppled. The vessel was a perfect wreck. Everyone was busily employed, but nobody could be either heard or obeyed. The Anabaptist, being upon deck, lent a helping hand as well as the rest, when a brutish sailor struck him and knocked him to the deck; but from the violence of the blow the sailor himself tumbled headfirst overboard, and fell upon a piece of the broken mast, which he immediately grasped. Honest James, forgetting the injury he had just received from him, flew to his assistance, and with great difficulty hauled him in again, but in the attempt was, by a sudden jerk of the ship, thrown overboard himself, in sight of the very fellow whom he had risked his life to save, and who took not the least notice of him in this distress. Candide, who saw everything that had happened, and saw his benefactor one moment rising above water and the next swallowed up by the merciless waves, was preparing to jump in after him, but was prevented by the philosopher Pangloss, who demonstrated to him that the coast of Lisbon had been made on purpose for the Anabaptist to be drowned there. While he was proving his argument à priori,l the ship foundered, and the whole crew perished, except Pangloss, Candide, and the sailor who had caused the drowning of the good Anabaptist. The villain swam ashore, but Pangloss and Candide got to land upon a plank.","Half of the passengers, weakened by the frightful anguish of seasickness and the distress of tossing about on stormy waters, were incapable of noticing their danger. The other half shrieked aloud and fell to their prayers, the sails were ripped to shreds, the masts snapped, the vessel opened at the seams. Everyone worked who could stir, nobody listened for orders or issued them. The Anabaptist was lending a hand in the after part of the ship when a frantic sailor struck him and knocked him to the deck; but just at that moment, the sailor lurched so violently that he fell head first over the side, where he hung, clutching a fragment of the broken mast. The good Jacques ran to his aid, and helped him to climb back on board, but in the process was himself thrown into the sea under the very eyes of the sailor, who allowed him to drown without even glancing at him. Candide rushed to the rail, and saw his benefactor rise for a moment to the surface, then sink forever. He wanted to dive to his rescue; but the philosopher Pangloss prevented him by proving that the bay of Lisbon had been formed expressly for this Anabaptist to drown in. While he was proving the point a priori,18 the vessel opened up and everyone perished except for Pangloss, Candide, and the brutal sailor who had caused the virtuous Anabaptist to drown; this rascal swam easily to shore, while Pangloss and Candide drifted there on a plank."
"Candide écoutait attentivement, et croyait innocemment; car il trouvait Mlle Cunégonde extrêmement belle, quoiqu’il ne prît jamais la hardiesse de le lui dire. Il concluait qu’après le bonheur d’être né baron de Thunder-ten-tronckh, le second degré de bonheur était d’être Mlle Cunégonde; le troisième, de la voir tous les jours; et le quatrième, d’entendre maître Pangloss, le plus grand philosophe de la province, et par conséquent de toute la terre.","Candide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he found Mademoiselle Cunégonde extremely beautiful, although he never took the boldness to tell her so. He concluded that after the happiness of being born Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, the second degree of happiness was to be Miss Cunégonde; the third, to see her every day; and the fourth, to hear Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the province, and consequently of all the earth.","Candide listened attentively, and believed implicitly; for he thought Miss Cunégonde excessively handsome though he never had the courage to tell her so. He concluded that after the happiness of being Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, the next was that of being Miss Cunégonde, the next that of seeing her every day, and the last that of hearing the doctrine of Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole province, and consequently of the whole world.","Candide listened attentively and believed implicitly; for he found Miss Cunégonde exceedingly pretty, though he never had the courage to tell her so. He decided that after the happiness of being born Baron of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh, the second order of happiness was to be Miss Cunégonde; the third was seeing her every day; and the fourth was listening to Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher in the province and consequently in the entire world."
"Une chose acheva de confirmer Martin dans ses détestables principes, de faire hésiter plus que jamais Candide, et d’embarrasser Pangloss. C’est qu’ils virent un jour aborder dans leur métairie Paquette et le frère Giroflée, qui étaient dans la plus extrême misère; ils avaient bien vite mangé leurs trois mille piastres, s’étaient quittés, s’étaient raccommodés, s’étaient brouillés, avaient été mis en prison, s’étaient enfuis, et enfin frère Giroflée s’était fait turc. Paquette continuait son métier partout, et n’y gagnait plus rien. « Je l’avais bien prévu, dit Martin à Candide, que vos présents seraient bientôt dissipés et ne les rendraient que plus misérables. Vous avez regorgé de millions de piastres, vous et Cacambo, et vous n’êtes pas plus heureux que frère Giroflée et Paquette. — Ah, ah! dit Pangloss à Paquette, le ciel vous ramène donc ici parmi nous, ma pauvre enfant! Savez-vous bien que vous m’avez coûté le bout du nez, un oeil et une oreille? Comme vous voilà faite! Et qu’est-ce que ce monde! » Cette nouvelle aventure les engagea à philosopher plus que jamais.","One thing succeeded in confirming Martin in his detestable principles, in making Candide hesitate more than ever, and in embarrassing Pangloss. One day they saw Paquette and Brother Giroflée approaching their farm, who were in the most extreme poverty; they had quickly eaten up their three thousand piastres, had separated, had made up, had fallen out, had been imprisoned, had fled, and finally Brother Giroflée had become a Turk. Paquette continued his trade everywhere, and no longer earned anything. “I had foreseen it,” said Martin to Candide, “that your presents would soon be dissipated and would only make them more miserable. You have overflowed with millions of piastres, you and Cacambo, and you are no happier than Brother Giroflée and Paquette. — Ah, ah! said Pangloss to Paquette, ""heaven brings you back here among us, my poor child!"" Do you know that you have cost me the tip of my nose, an eye and an ear? How you are made! And what is this world! This new adventure engaged them to philosophize more than ever.","One thing more than ever confirmed Martin in his detestable principles, made Candide hesitate, and embarrassed Pangloss. It was the arrival of Pacquette and Brother Giroflée one day at their farm. This couple had been in the utmost distress; they had quickly spent their three thousand piastres; they had split up, been reconciled; quarrelled again, been thrown into prison; had made their escape, and at last Brother Giroflée turned Turk. Pacquette still continued to follow her trade wherever she went; but she made little or no money at it. “I told you,” said Martin to Candide, “that your presents would soon be squandered, and would only make them more miserable. You and Cacambo have spent millions of piastres, and yet you are not any happier than Brother Giroflée and Pacquette.” “Ah!” said Pangloss to Pacquette, “It is heaven who has brought you here among us, my poor child! Do you know that you have cost me the tip of my nose, one eye and one ear? And look at you now! Eh! What a world!” This new adventure brought them more deeply than ever into philosophical debates.","One thing served to confirm Martin in his detestable opinions, to make Candide hesitate more than ever, and to embarrass Pangloss. It was the arrival one day at their farm of Paquette and Brother Giroflée, who were in the last stages of misery.

Paquette continued to ply her trade everywhere, and no longer made any money at it. —I told you, said Martin to Candide, that your gifts would soon be squandered and would only render them more unhappy.
