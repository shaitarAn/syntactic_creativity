"Puis on causa de la session qui s'ouvrait. Laroche-Mathieu se mit à pérorer, préparant l'effet des phrases qu'il allait répandre sur ses collègues quelques heures plus tard. Il agitait sa main droite, levant en l'air tantôt sa fourchette, tantôt son couteau, tantôt une bouchée de pain, et sans regarder personne, s'adressant à l'Assemblée invisible, il expectorait son éloquence liquoreuse de beau garçon bien coiffé. Une très petite moustache roulée redressait sur sa lèvre deux pointes pareilles à des queues de scorpion, et ses cheveux huilés de brillantine, séparés au milieu du front, arrondissaient sur ses tempes deux bandeaux de bellâtre provincial. Il était un peu trop gras, un peu bouffi, bien que jeune; le ventre tendait son gilet. Le secrétaire particulier mangeait et buvait tranquillement, accoutumé sans doute à ses douches de faconde; mais Du Roy, que la jalousie du succès obtenu mordait au coeur, songeait: ""Va donc, ganache! Quels crétins que ces hommes politiques!""","Then they talked about the session which was opening.

A very small curled mustache raised two points on his lip like the tails of a scorpion, and his hair oiled with brilliantine, parted in the middle of his forehead, rounded his temples with two bands of handsome provincial. He was a little too fat, a little puffy, although young; the belly held out its waistcoat. The private secretary ate and drank calmly, no doubt accustomed to his eloquent showers; but Du Roy, whose heart was bitten by jealousy of the success he had obtained, thought: ""Go ahead, ganache! What cretins these politicians are!""","Then they chatted about the session that was about to open.

On his lip, a tiny twirly moustache poked up in two points like scorpion tails, and his brilliantined hair, parted in the centre of his brow, was combed into two curls on his temples, after the style of a provincial dandy. Despite his youth he was a trifle overweight, a trifle puffy; his waistcoat stretched tightly across his stomach. The private secretary sat calmly eating and drinking, no doubt accustomed to these showers of loquacity; but Du Roy, consumed with jealousy at Laroche-Mathieu’s success, was thinking: ‘Oh, give it a rest, you half-wit; what morons these politicos are!’ And, as he compared his own worth to the minister’s garrulous self-importance, he reflected: ‘God!","The morning of the reopening of the Chamber, Du Roy lunched with Laroche-Mathieu in order to receive instructions from him, before the session, for a political article the following day in ""La Vie Francaise,"" which was to be a sort of official declaration of the plans of the cabinet."

"M. Walter, qui l'appréciait cependant, avait souvent désiré un autre homme pour lui confier les Échos, qui sont, disait-il, la moelle du journal. C'est par eux qu'on lance les nouvelles, qu'on fait courir les bruits, qu'on agit sur le public et sur la rente. Entre deux soirées mondaines, il faut savoir glisser, sans avoir l'air de rien, la chose importante, plutôt insinuée que dite. Il faut, par des sous-entendus, laisser deviner ce qu'on veut, démentir de telle sorte que la rumeur s'affirme, ou affirmer de telle manière que personne ne croie au fait annoncé. Il faut que, dans les échos, chacun trouve chaque jour une ligne au moins qui l'intéresse, afin que tout le monde les lise. Il faut penser à tout et à tous, à tous les mondes, à toutes les professions, à Paris et à la Province, à l'Armée et aux Peintres, au Clergé et à l'Université, aux Magistrats et aux Courtisanes.","Mr. Walter, who appreciated him, however, had often desired another man to entrust him with the Echoes, which are, he said, the marrow of the journal. It is through them that we launch the news, that we spread rumors, that we act on the public and on the revenue. Between two social evenings, you have to know how to slip, without looking like anything, the important thing, rather insinuated than said. It is necessary, by innuendo, to let guess what one wants, to deny in such a way that the rumor is affirmed, or to affirm in such a way that no one believes in the announced fact. It is necessary that, in the echoes, each one finds at least one line each day which interests him, so that everyone reads them. We must think of everything and everyone, of all worlds, of all professions, of Paris and the Provinces, of the Army and the Painters, of the Clergy and the University, of the Magistrates and the Courtesans.","M. Walter, who appreciated him nevertheless, had often wished there was someone else to whom he could entrust the gossip column, which was, he used to say, the nerve centre of the paper. That is where news is first reported, where rumours are born, where influence can be exerted on the public and on the stock exchange. You need to know how to slip the important piece of news in between two fashionable evening parties, as though it is of no significance, insinuating rather than explicit. You have to hint at what you want to say, letting readers guess what you have in mind, issuing denials in terms which confirm a rumour, or confirming in such a way that no one believes it. It is essential that every reader, every day, should find at least one item of gossip that is of interest to him, so that everyone will read the column. You must think of everything and everybody, of every class, of every profession, of Paris and the provinces, of the military, the arts, the clergy, the university, the magistrature, and the world of high-class prostitution.","The man at the head of that department should be wide awake, always on his guard, quick to judge of what was best to be said and best to be omitted, to divine what would please the public and to present it well."
