"Sebastião Freitas, o vereador dissidente, tinha o dom da palavra e falou ainda por algum tempo com prudência, mas com firmeza. Os colegas estavam atônitos; o presidente pediu-lhe que, ao menos, desse o exemplo da ordem e do respeito à lei, não aventasse as suas ideias na rua, para não dar corpo e alma à rebelião, que era por ora um turbilhão de átomos dispersos. Esta figura corrigiu um pouco o efeito da outra: Sebastião Freitas prometeu suspender qualquer ação, reservando-se o direito de pedir pelos meios legais a redução da Casa Verde. E repetia consigo, namorado: — Bastilha da razão humana!","Sebastião Freitas, the dissident councilor, had the gift of speech and spoke prudently but firmly for some time. Colleagues were astonished; the president asked him to, at least, set an example of order and respect for the law, not to vent his ideas in the street, so as not to give body and soul to the rebellion, which was for now a whirlwind of dispersed atoms. This figure corrected the effect of the other a little: Sebastião Freitas promised to suspend any action, reserving the right to ask for the reduction of Casa Verde through legal means. And he repeated to himself, boyfriend: — Bastille of human reason!","This Councilman, a highly articulate fellow named Sebastião Freitas, spoke at some length. He presented the case against the Green House with restraint but with firm conviction. His colleagues were dumbfounded. The President begged him at least to help preserve law and order by not expressing his opinions in the street, where they might give body and soul to what was so far merely a whirlwind of uncoordinated atoms. This figure of speech counterbalanced to some extent the one about the Bastille. Sebastião Freitas promised to take no action for the present but reserved the right to seek the elimination of the Green House by legal means. And he murmured to himself lovingly: “That Bastille of the human reason!”","Sebastião Freitas, the dissident councilman, had a gift for words, and he continued to speak for some time with firmness, prudence, and good sense. His colleagues were dumfounded, and the president of the town council begged him, at least, to set an example of respect for law and order by not repeating such things in the street, where his ideas would “give body and soul to the whirlwind.” The effect of this phrase was to counterbalance, somewhat, the effect of the other. Sebastião Freitas promised to do nothing more, for the moment, but reserved the right to demand legal measures against the Casa Verde. “That Bastille of human reason,” he repeated under his breath, shaking his head in admiration."
"Outro da mesma espécie era um escrivão, que se vendia por mordomo do rei; outro era um boiadeiro de Minas, cuja mania era distribuir boiadas a toda a gente, dava trezentas cabeças a um, seiscentas a outro, mil e duzentas a outro, e não acabava mais. Não falo dos casos de monomania religiosa; apenas citarei um sujeito que, chamando-se João de Deus, dizia agora ser o deus João, e prometia o reino dos céus a quem o adorasse, e as penas do inferno aos outros; e depois desse, o licenciado Garcia, que não dizia nada, porque imaginava que no dia em que chegasse a proferir uma só palavra, todas as estrelas se despegariam do céu e abrasariam a terra; tal era o poder que recebera de Deus. Assim o escrevia ele no papel que o alienista lhe mandava dar, menos por caridade do que por interesse científico.","Another of the same kind was a clerk, who sold himself as a butler to the king; another was a cattleman from Minas, whose mania was to distribute cattle to everyone, he would give three hundred heads to one, six hundred to another, twelve hundred to another, and he never stopped. I am not talking about cases of religious monomania; I will only quote a fellow who, calling himself John of God, now claimed to be the god John, and promised the kingdom of heaven to those who worshiped him, and the pains of hell to others; and after that, the licentiate Garcia, who said nothing, because he imagined that the day he managed to utter a single word, all the stars would detach themselves from the sky and scorch the earth; such was the power he had received from God. So he wrote it on the paper that the alienist had sent him, less out of charity than out of scientific interest.","Beginning with the proposition that he was a child of God, which even the Vicar would not have denied, he reasoned that, as the species of the child is the same as that of the parent, he himself must be a god. This conclusion, derived from two irrefutable premises—one Biblical, the other scientific—placed him far above the lunatics who identified themselves with Caesar, Alexander, or other mere mortals.","As a first organizational measure (recommended by his friend Crispim Soares), he hired a staff of two young men (also recommended by Soares, their uncle) to keep the records of the asylum and handle its daily administration, such as the distribution of food and clothing as approved and funded by the town council. The alienist could thus concentrate his full attention on alienism."

"— Nada tenho que ver com a ciência; mas se tantos homens em quem supomos juízo são reclusos por dementes, quem nos afirma que o alienado não é o alienista?","'I have nothing to do with science; but if so many men in whom we assume judgment are recluses for being insane, who can tell us that the alienated is not the alienist?","“I know nothing about science, but if so many men whom we considered sane are locked up as madmen, how do we know that the real madman is not the alienist himself?”","“I know nothing of Science, but if he has locked up so many people who are apparently sane, who’s to say that the alienist isn’t insane himself?”"
"E levou-a aos livros. D. Evarista ficou deslumbrada. Era uma via láctea de algarismos. E depois levou-a às arcas, onde estava o dinheiro. Deus! eram montes de ouro, eram mil cruzados sobre mil cruzados, dobrões sobre dobrões; era a opulência. Enquanto ela comia o ouro com os seus olhos negros, o alienista fitava-a, e dizia-lhe ao ouvido com a mais pérfida das alusões:","And took her to the books. Dona Evarista was dazzled. It was a milky way of digits. And then he took her to the chests, where the money was. God! they were heaps of gold, a thousand cruzados upon a thousand cruzados, doubloons upon doubloons; it was opulence. As she ate the gold with her black eyes, the alienist looked at her, and said in her ear with the most perfidious of allusions:","He brought her the books of account. Dona Evarista, although impressed by the quantity of the figures, was not quite sure what they signified, so her husband took her to the chest where the money was kept. Good heavens! There were mountains of gold, thousands upon thousands of cruzados and doubloons. A fortune! While she was drinking it in with her black eyes, the alienist placed his mouth close to her and whispered mischievously:","He took her to see the account books, but Dona Evarista found the myriad of numbers bewildering, so he led her to the money chest and, Good Heavens , there were piles of gold coins, a fortune! As she devoured the sight, the alienist spoke roguishly in her ear:"
"— Vejamos, pensava ele; vejamos se chego enfim à última verdade.","— Let's see, he thought; Let's see if I finally arrive at the ultimate truth.","“Let us see,” he said to himself, “if I can discover the ultimate, underlying truth.”","“Let us see,” he said to himself, “if I can discover the ultimate truth.”"
"— Com a definição atual, que é a de todos os tempos, acrescentou, a loucura e a razão estão perfeitamente delimitadas. Sabe-se onde uma acaba e onde a outra começa. Para que transpor a cerca?","— With the current definition, which is the one of all times, he added, madness and reason are perfectly delimited. You know where one ends and the other begins. Why cross the fence?","“Under the present definition of insanity, which has always been accepted,” he added, “the fence around the area is perfectly clear and satisfactory. Why not stay within it?”","“The current definition has always served to distinguish sanity from insanity well enough. One knows who is mad and who isn’t,” he said. “Why open up a new box of worms?”"
"A vereança de Itaguaí, entre outros pecados de que é arguida pelos cronistas, tinha o de não fazer caso dos dementes. Assim é que cada louco furioso era trancado em uma alcova, na própria casa, e, não curado, mas descurado, até que a morte o vinha defraudar do benefício da vida; os mansos andavam à solta pela rua. Simão Bacamarte entendeu desde logo reformar tão ruim costume; pediu licença à câmara para agasalhar e tratar no edifício que ia construir todos os loucos de Itaguaí e das demais vilas e cidades, mediante um estipêndio, que a câmara lhe daria quando a família do enfermo o não pudesse fazer. A proposta excitou a curiosidade de toda a vila, e encontrou grande resistência, tão certo é que dificilmente se desarraigam hábitos absurdos, ou ainda maus. A ideia de meter os loucos na mesma casa, vivendo em comum, pareceu em si mesma um sintoma de demência, e não faltou quem o insinuasse à própria mulher do médico.","The council of Itaguaí, among other sins that the chroniclers argue, had to ignore the insane. So it was that each mad madman was shut up in an alcove, in his own house, and, not cured, but neglected, until death came to defraud him of the benefit of life; the meek were roaming the street. Simão Bacamarte immediately decided to reform such a bad habit; he asked the council for permission to bundle up and treat in the building that was going to build all the insane in Itaguaí and other towns and cities, through a stipend, which the council would give him when the sick man's family could not do so. The proposal aroused the curiosity of the whole town, and met with great resistance, so certain is it that it is difficult to uproot absurd habits, or even bad ones. The idea of putting the insane in the same house, living together, seemed in itself to be a symptom of dementia, and there was no shortage of people who insinuated it to the doctor's wife.","The chroniclers chide the Itaguai Town Council for its neglect of the mentally ill. Violent madmen were locked up at home; peaceable lunatics were simply left at large; and none, violent or peaceable, received care of any sort. Simão Bacamarte proposed to change all this. He decided to build an asylum and he asked the Council for authority to receive and treat all the mentally ill of Itaguai and the surrounding area. He would be paid by the patient’s family or, if the family was very poor, by the Council. The proposal aroused excitement and curiosity throughout the town. There was considerable opposition, for it is always difficult to uproot the established way of doing things, however absurd or evil it may be. The idea of having madmen live together in the same house seemed itself to be a symptom of madness, as many intimated even to the doctor’s wife.","Among the defects that local chroniclers attribute to the Itaguaí town council of those years was inattention to the needs of lunatics. Violent lunatics were locked away at home by their families, ignored and untreated, until death finally came for them, while the nonviolent ones wandered loose in the streets. Simão Bacamarte set out to remedy this situation. He informed the town council of his intention to house and treat the insane of Itaguaí and all the surrounding area in a specially constructed building, and he requested public funding to defray the costs of patients whose families could not afford treatment. His proposal raised the curiosity of everyone in town and provoked great opposition, showing how difficult it is to eliminate deeply rooted habits, even absurd or pernicious ones. The idea of gathering the town’s lunatics to live in one house seemed itself a symptom of dementia, as someone even dared insinuate to the doctor’s wife."

"— A ferocidade, Sr. Soares, é o grotesco a sério.","— The ferocity, Mr. Soares, it's the real grotesque.","“The grotesque, my friend, is simply ferocity in disguise.”","“And all these diverse manifestations, Soares, whether ferocious or grotesque, are rooted in the same phenomenon.”"
"— Supondo o espírito humano uma vasta concha, o meu fim, Sr. Soares, é ver se posso extrair a pérola, que é a razão; por outros termos, demarquemos definitivamente os limites da razão e da loucura. A razão é o perfeito equilíbrio de todas as faculdades; fora daí insânia, insânia, e só insânia.","""Supposing the human spirit to be a vast shell, my end, Mr. Soares, is to see if I can extract the pearl, which is the reason; in other words, let us definitively demarcate the limits of reason and madness. Reason is the perfect balance of all faculties; out of there insanity, insanity, and only insanity.","When he finally spoke, it was with great deliberation. “Think of humanity,” he said, “as a great oyster shell. Our first task, Soares, is to extract the pearl—that is, reason. In other words, we must determine the nature and boundaries of reason. Madness is simply all that lies beyond those limits. But what is reason if not the equilibrium of the mental faculties? An individual, therefore, who lacks this equilibrium in any particular is, to that extent, insane.”","“Let us suppose, my good Soares, that the collective human spirit resembles a great oyster. My goal is to extract the pearl. The pearl is reason itself, pure sanity. I must therefore define the precise boundaries of what is reasonable; anything else is madness, madness pure and simple. And here is the definition. Sanity is the perfect equilibrium of all the faculties, neither more, nor less.”"
"Enganava-se o digno magistrado; o médico arranjou tudo. Uma vez empossado da licença começou logo a construir a casa. Era na rua Nova, a mais bela rua de Itaguaí naquele tempo, tinha cinquenta janelas por lado, um pátio no centro, e numerosos cubículos para os hóspedes. Como fosse grande arabista, achou no Corão que Maomé declara veneráveis os doidos, pela consideração de que Alá4 lhes tira o juízo para que não pequem. A ideia pareceu-lhe bonita e profunda, e ele a fez gravar no frontispício da casa; mas, como tinha medo ao vigário, e por tabela ao bispo, atribuiu o pensamento a Benedito VIII,5 merecendo com essa fraude, aliás pia, que o padre Lopes lhe contasse, ao almoço, a vida daquele pontífice eminente.","The worthy magistrate was wrong; the doctor arranged everything. Once he was granted the license, he immediately began to build the house. It was on Rua Nova, the most beautiful street in Itaguaí at the time, it had fifty windows on each side, a patio in the center, and numerous cubicles for guests. As he was a great Arabist, he found in the Koran that Mohammed declares madmen to be venerable, on the grounds that Allah4 takes away their senses so that they do not sin. The idea seemed beautiful and profound to him, and he had it engraved on the frontispiece of the house; but, as he was afraid of the vicar, and by way of the bishop, he attributed the thought to Benedict VIII,5 deserving with this fraud, indeed pious, that Father Lopes told him, at lunch, about the life of that eminent pontiff.","But the worthy Councilman was wrong. Bacamarte built his madhouse on New Street, the finest thoroughfare in Itaguai. The building had a courtyard in the center and two hundred cubicles, each with one window. The doctor, an ardent student of Arabian lore, found a passage in the Koran in which Mohammed declared that the insane were holy, for Allah had deprived them of their judgment in order to keep them from sinning. Bacamarte found the idea at once beautiful and profound, and he had the passage engraved on the façade of the house. But he feared that this might offend the Vicar and, through him, the Bishop. Accordingly, he attributed the quotation to Benedict VIII.","But the worthy magistrate was wrong; the doctor accomplished it all. As soon as he was in possession of the license, he began construction of his asylum. It stood on the Rua Nova, Itaguaí’s most elegant street in those days, and had fifty windows on each side, a courtyard in the center, and scores of small bedrooms for the residents. An avid student of Islamic medical texts, the doctor found a passage in the Quran declaring mad people saintly, because Allah took their wits so they wouldn’t sin. He found the idea appealing and profound and had it engraved on the front of the building, but because he was worried about the disapproval of the vicar and, ultimately, the bishop, he attributed the thought to Pope Benedict VIII. His punishment for this small, pious fraud was to hear Father Lopes recount at lunch the entire biography of that eminent pontiff."

— Déspota! violento! Golias!20,— Despot! violent! Goliath! 20,“Despot! Outlaw!

"E cavando por aí abaixo, eis o resultado a que chegou: os cérebros bem organizados que ele acabava de curar, eram tão desequilibrados como os outros. Sim, dizia ele consigo, eu não posso ter a pretensão de haver-lhes incutido um sentimento ou uma faculdade nova; uma e outra coisa existiam no estado latente, mas existiam.","And digging down there, here's what he came up with: the well-organized brains he'd just cured were just as unbalanced as the others. Yes, he said to himself, I cannot claim to have instilled in them a new feeling or faculty; both of them existed in a latent state, but they did exist.","He soon arrived at this conclusion: the apparently well-balanced minds that he had just “cured” had really been unbalanced all the time, just like the obviously sane minds of the rest of the people. Their apparent illness was superficial and transient.","And digging deeper, he concluded that he really could not claim to have added anything to his patients’ already existing mental faculties. The apparent cures had simply revealed an underlying mental imbalance that was present all along—latent, perhaps, but present."
"— Não pedimos nada, replicou fremente o barbeiro; ordenamos que a Casa Verde seja demolida, ou pelo menos despojada dos infelizes que lá estão.","""We don't ask for anything,"" replied the barber frantically; we order that Casa Verde be demolished, or at least stripped of the unfortunates who are there.","“We aren’t requesting anything,” replied the barber, trembling with rage. “We are demanding that the Green House be destroyed or at least that all the prisoners in it be freed.”","“We aren’t asking for anything,” replied the barber vehemently, “we’re demanding that the Casa Verde be demolished, or at least, emptied of all its victims.”"

"Ao que o padre Lopes respondeu, sem responder:","To which Father Lopes replied, without replying:","“How can I ally myself with your enemies,” replied Father Lopes (if one can call it a reply), “when you have no enemies?","“And how could I do that,” responded the vicar, without responding, “if there isn’t any opposition?”"
"A abnegação do ilustre médico deu-lhe grande realce. Conjeturas, invenções, desconfianças, tudo caiu por terra, desde que ele não duvidou recolher à Casa Verde a própria mulher, a quem amava com todas as forças da alma. Ninguém mais tinha o direito de resistir-lhe, — menos ainda o de atribuir-lhe intuitos alheios à ciência.","The self-denial of the illustrious physician gave him great emphasis. Conjectures, inventions, suspicions, everything fell apart, since he did not hesitate to bring his own wife to Casa Verde, whom he loved with all the strength of his soul. No one else had the right to resist it, even less to attribute to it purposes alien to science.","This personal sacrifice greatly enhanced the public image of the illustrious doctor. Suspicion, distrust, accusations were all negated by the commitment of his own wife whom he loved with all his heart. No one could ever again charge him with motives other than those of science itself.","The selfless action of the illustrious physician greatly impressed the town as a whole. The mistrust and speculation that had surrounded him abruptly ceased once the alienist had his own wife—whom he loved more than life itself—committed to the Casa Verde. Who now could oppose him, or even suggest that he had considerations other than scientific ones?"
"Crispim empalideceu. Que negócio importante podia ser, se não alguma triste notícia da comitiva, e especialmente da mulher? Porque este tópico deve ficar claramente definido, visto insistirem nele os cronistas: Crispim amava a mulher, e, desde trinta anos, nunca estiveram separados um só dia. Assim se explicam os monólogos que ele fazia agora, e que os fâmulos lhe ouviam muita vez: — “Anda, bem feito, quem te mandou consentir na viagem de Cesária? Bajulador, torpe bajulador! Só para adular ao Dr. Bacamarte. Pois agora aguenta-te; anda, aguenta-te, alma de lacaio, fracalhão, vil, miserável. Dizes amen a tudo, não é? aí tens o lucro, biltre!” — E muitos outros nomes feios, que um homem não deve dizer aos outros, quanto mais a si mesmo. Daqui a imaginar o efeito do recado é um nada. Tão depressa ele o recebeu como abriu mão das drogas e voou à Casa Verde.","Crispin paled. What important business could it be, if not some sad news from the entourage, and especially from the woman? Because this topic must be clearly defined, as the chroniclers insist on it: Crispin loved his wife, and for thirty years they had never been apart for a single day. This explains the monologues he was making now, and which the servants often heard him: — “Come on, well done, who told you to consent to Cesaria's journey? Flatterer, vile flatterer! Just to flatter Dr. Blunderbuss. For now bear with thee; come on, hold on, lackey's soul, weakling, vile, wretched. You say amen to everything, don't you? there you have the profit, scoundrel!” “And many other ugly names, which a man must not say to others, let alone himself. From here to imagine the effect of the message is nothing. He received it as quickly as he gave up drugs and flew to Casa Verde.","The druggist turned pale. Something must have happened to his wife! The chroniclers of Itaguai, it should be noted, dwell upon Crispim’s love for his Cesaria and point out that they had never been separated in their thirty years of marriage. Only against this background can one explain the monologue, often overheard by the servants, with which the druggist reviled himself: “You miss your wife, do you? You’re going crazy without her? It serves you right! Always truckling to Dr. Bacamarte! Who told you to let Cesaria go traveling? Dr. Bacamarte, that’s who. Anything he says, you say amen. So now see what you get for it, you vile, miserable, groveling little lackey! Lickspittle! Flunky!” And he added many other ugly names that a man ought not call his enemies, much less himself. The effect of the message on him, in this state of mind, can be readily imagined. He dropped the drugs he had been mixing and fairly flew to the Green House.","The apothecary turned pale. What could be so urgent, if not news of Dona Evarista and his wife? Now, the chronicles of Itaguaí are specific on this point: Crispim loved his wife, and, during their thirty years of marriage, the two had not previously slept apart during a single night. No doubt that explains the things that the distraught apothecary said aloud to himself, according to the servants, after his wife’s departure: “So you miss Cesárea, do you? Well, it serves you right for consenting to let her make that trip just to please Dr. Bacamarte. You go along with everything, and this is the result. So now you have to put up with it, you miserable good-for-nothing!” And he added many other ugly names that a man shouldn’t call his worst enemy, and much less himself. It is therefore easy to deduce the effect of that morning’s message. Dropping everything, the apothecary ran to the Casa Verde."
"De manhã, com efeito, era costume do Mateus estatelar-se, no meio do jardim, com os olhos na casa, namorado, durante uma longa hora, até que vinham chamá-lo para almoçar. Os vizinhos, embora o cumprimentassem com certo respeito, riam-se por trás dele, que era um gosto. Um desses chegou a dizer que o Mateus seria muito mais econômico, e estaria riquíssimo, se fabricasse as albardas para si mesmo; epigrama ininteligível, mas que fazia rir às bandeiras despregadas.","In the morning, in fact, it was Mateus' habit to sprawl out in the middle of the garden, with his eyes on the house, boyfriend, for a long hour, until they came to call him for lunch. The neighbors, although they greeted him with a certain respect, laughed behind him, which was a pleasure. One of these went so far as to say that Mateus would be much more economical, and would be very rich, if he made the packsaddles for himself; unintelligible epigram, but which made the flags fly laugh.","For it was his custom to station himself every morning in the middle of his garden and gaze lovingly at the house. He would keep this up for a good hour, until called in to lunch. Although his neighbors always greeted him respectfully enough, they would laugh behind his back. One of them observed that Mateus could make a lot more money manufacturing pack-saddles to put on himself—a somewhat unintelligible remark, which nevertheless sent the listeners into ecstasies of laughter.","Mateus had the habit of planting himself in the garden and gazing at his house for a good hour every morning, until the servants called him to lunch. The neighbors greeted him respectfully to his face, but they laughed at him behind his back. One neighbor liked to joke that if Mateus made saddles for himself, he’d be a millionaire, which, while it made no sense strictly speaking, produced gales of laughter."

"Imagina-se a consternação de Itaguaí, quando soube do caso. Não se falou em outra coisa, dizia-se que o Costa ensandecera, ao almoço, outros que de madrugada; e contavam-se os acessos, que eram furiosos, sombrios, terríveis, — ou mansos, e até engraçados, conforme as versões. Muita gente correu à Casa Verde, e achou o pobre Costa, tranquilo, um pouco espantado, falando com muita clareza, e perguntando por que motivo o tinham levado para ali. Alguns foram ter com o alienista. Bacamarte aprovava esses sentimentos de estima e compaixão, mas acrescentava que a ciência era a ciência, que ele não podia deixar na rua um mentecapto. A última pessoa que intercedeu por ele (porque depois do que vou contar ninguém mais se atreveu a procurar o terrível médico) foi uma pobre senhora, prima do Costa. O alienista disse-lhe confidencialmente que esse digno homem não estava no perfeito equilíbrio das faculdades mentais, à vista do modo como dissipara os cabedais que…","One can imagine the consternation of Itaguaí when he learned of the case. Nothing else was said, it was said that Costa had gone mad at lunch, other than at dawn; and the attacks were counted, which were furious, dark, terrible — or mild, and even funny, depending on the versions. Many people ran to Casa Verde, and found poor Costa, calm, a little startled, speaking very clearly, and asking why he had been taken there. Some went to the alienist. Bacamarte approved of these feelings of esteem and compassion, but added that science was science, that he could not leave a fool on the street. The last person who interceded for him (because after what I'm about to tell you no one else dared to go to the terrible doctor) was a poor lady, Costa's cousin. The alienist told him confidentially that this worthy man was not in perfect balance of mental faculties, in view of the way he had dissipated the capitals that...","The consternation in Itaguai, when the matter became known, can readily be imagined. No one spoke of anything else. Some said that Costa had gone mad during lunch, others said it had happened early in the morning. They told of the mental attacks he had suffered, described by some as violent and frightening, by others as mild and even amusing. Many people hurried to the Green House. There they found poor Costa calm if somewhat surprised, speaking with great lucidity and asking why he had been brought there. Some went and talked with the alienist. Bacamarte approved of their esteem and compassion for the patient, but he explained that science was science and that he could not permit a madman to remain at large. The last person to intercede (for, after what I am about to relate, no one dared go to see the dreadful alienist) was a lady cousin of the patient. The doctor told her that Costa must certainly be insane, for otherwise he would not have thrown away all the money that . . .","Imagine the consternation of Itaguaí when people found out. They talked of nothing else, some saying he’d lost his mind at lunch, some, in the wee hours of the morning, and they described the onset of his fits: dark, violent, and terrible—or mild, and even amusing—according to the teller. A lot of people ran to the Casa Verde, and they found poor Costa calm, a bit startled, perfectly lucid, and asking repeatedly why he had been taken there. A few went to speak with the alienist. Bacamarte applauded their expressions of concern, but he made clear that Science was Science. He could not let a madman go around loose. The last person who tried to intercede (because, after what I am about to relate, nobody else dared) was Costa’s cousin. The fearsome doctor explained confidentially to the unfortunate woman that the way her cousin had squandered the family fortune betrayed a disequilibrium of his mental faculties."
"Outro doente, também modesto, opôs a mesma rebeldia à medicação; mas não sendo escritor (mal sabia assinar o nome), não se lhe podia aplicar o remédio da matraca. Simão Bacamarte lembrou-se de pedir para ele o lugar de secretário da Academia dos Encobertos estabelecida em Itaguaí. Os lugares de presidente e secretários eram de nomeação régia, por especial graça do finado rei D. João v, e implicavam o tratamento de Excelência e o uso de uma placa de ouro no chapéu. O governo de Lisboa recusou o diploma; mas representando o alienista que o não pedia como prêmio honorífico ou distinção legítima, e somente como um meio terapêutico para um caso difícil, o governo cedeu excepcionalmente à súplica; e ainda assim não o fez sem extraordinário esforço do ministro de marinha e ultramar, que vinha a ser primo do alienado. Foi outro santo remédio.","Another patient, also modest, opposed the same rebelliousness to medication; but not being a writer (he hardly knew how to sign his name), he could not be given the remedy of the rattle. Simão Bacamarte remembered to ask him for the post of secretary of the Academia dos Encobertos established in Itaguaí. The posts of president and secretaries were royally appointed, by special grace of the late King D. João V, and implied the treatment of Excellency and the use of a gold plate on the hat. The Lisbon government refused the diploma; but representing the alienist who did not ask for it as an honorary prize or legitimate distinction, and only as a therapeutic means for a difficult case, the government exceptionally yielded to the supplication; and even so, he did not do so without an extraordinary effort on the part of the Minister of Marine and Overseas, who happened to be the cousin of the alienated person. It was another holy remedy.","Another patient, also in the modest class, seemed incurable. The specific remedy used for the poet would not work, for this patient was not a writer; indeed, he could barely sign his name. But Dr. Bacamarte proved equal to the challenge. He decided to have the patient made Secretary to the Itaguai branch of the Royal Academy. The Secretary and the President of each branch were appointed by the Crown. They enjoyed the privileges of being addressed as Excellency and of wearing a gold medallion. The government at Lisbon refused Bacamarte’s request at first; but after the alienist explained that he did not ask the appointment as a real honor for his patient but merely as a therapeutic device to cure a difficult case, and after the Minister of Overseas Possessions (a cousin of the patient) intervened, the government finally granted the request. The consequent cure was hailed as another miracle.","Another madman, suffering from a similar delirium, also resisted treatment. Not being a writer (he could barely sign his name), this patient was not susceptible to the noisemaker cure. Simão Bacamarte moved the dosage to the highest level, asking His Majesty to confer a title of nobility on the poor man. The approach was admittedly desperate and fraught with delay. Lisbon denied the request initially, whereupon the alienist specified that the title could be strictly honorific and therapeutic, and the government finally acquiesced as an exceptional and temporary measure, given its utility for the advancement of medical science. One chronicler alleges that the request might never have been granted were it not for the intervention of the minister of overseas and naval affairs, the patient’s second cousin once removed. Another miracle cure."

"Nisto chegou do Rio de Janeiro a esposa do alienista, a tia, a mulher do Crispim Soares, e toda a mais comitiva, — ou quase toda, — que algumas semanas antes partira de Itaguaí. O alienista foi recebê-la, com o boticário, o padre Lopes, os vereadores e vários outros magistrados. O momento em que D. Evarista pôs os olhos na pessoa do marido é considerado pelos cronistas do tempo como um dos mais sublimes da história moral dos homens, e isto pelo contraste das duas naturezas, ambas extremas, ambas egrégias. D. Evarista soltou um grito, balbuciou uma palavra, e atirou-se ao consorte, de um gesto que não se pode melhor definir do que comparando-o a uma mistura de onça e rola. Não assim o ilustre Bacamarte; frio como um diagnóstico, sem desengonçar por um instante a rigidez científica, estendeu os braços à dona, que caiu neles, e desmaiou. Curto incidente; ao cabo de dois minutos, D. Evarista recebia os cumprimentos dos amigos, e o préstito punha-se em marcha.","At this point, the alienist's wife, his aunt, Crispim Soares' wife arrived from Rio de Janeiro, and the entire entourage — or almost all — that had left Itaguaí a few weeks earlier. The alienist went to receive her, with the apothecary, Father Lopes, the councilors and several other magistrates. The moment when Dona Evarista laid eyes on the person of her husband is considered by the chroniclers of time as one of the most sublime in the moral history of men, and this because of the contrast between the two natures, both extreme, both egregious. Dona Evarista let out a cry, stammered a word, and threw himself on his consort, a gesture that cannot be better defined than comparing him to a mixture of a jaguar and turtle dove. Not so the illustrious Bacamarte; cold as a diagnosis, without for a moment losing his scientific rigidity, he stretched out his arms to the owner, who fell into them and fainted. Short incident; after two minutes, Dona Evarista was greeted by her friends, and the procession began.","At this time the party of travelers returned from their visit of several weeks to Rio de Janeiro. The alienist, the druggist, Father Lopes, the Councilmen, and several other officials went to greet them. The moment when Dona Evarista laid eyes again on her husband is regarded by the chroniclers of the time as one of the most sublime instants in the moral history of man, because of the contrast between these two extreme (although both commendable) natures. Dona Evarista uttered a cry, stammered a word or two, and threw herself at her husband in a way that suggested at once the fierceness of a wildcat and the gentle affection of a dove. Not so the noble Bacamarte. With diagnostic objectivity, without disturbing for a moment his scientific austerity, he extended his arms to the lady, who fell into them and fainted. The incident was brief; two minutes later Dona Evarista ’s friends were greeting her and the homeward procession began.","And at that point the wife of the alienist returned from Rio de Janeiro, along with her aunt, the wife of Crispim Soares, and the rest of the party that had departed from Itaguaí a few weeks earlier. The alienist went to receive her, along with the apothecary, Father Lopes, and a number of town councilmen and magistrates. The moment when Dona Evarista laid eyes on her husband is considered by many chroniclers to be among the most sublime in human annals, because of the perfect contrast between these two noble temperaments, both extreme, both worthy. Dona Evarista let out a shriek, babbled a few words, and hurled herself at her consort in a manner that cannot be better defined than “part jaguar and part turtledove.” Not so the illustrious Bacamarte. Cold as a diagnosis, full of scientific rigidity, he wordlessly reached out to his lady, who fell into his arms and fainted. The incident did not last long. Within two minutes Dona Evarista’s friends were welcoming her back and the homeward procession had begun."
"mas uns sabiam do ódio do padre, e outros pensavam que isto era uma oração em latim.","but some knew of the priest's hatred, and others thought this was a prayer in Latin.","But the priest’s remark did not affect the general esteem in which Coelho was held, for some attributed the remark to mere personal animosity and others thought it was a prayer in Latin.","If asked, he claimed to be praying in Latin."
"De fato, o alienista oficiara à câmara expondo: — 1o, que verificara das estatísticas da vila e da Casa Verde, que quatro quintos da população estavam aposentados naquele estabelecimento; 2o, que esta deslocação de população levara-o a examinar os fundamentos da sua teoria das moléstias cerebrais, teoria que excluía do domínio da razão todos os casos em que o equilíbrio das faculdades não fosse perfeito e absoluto; 3o, que desse exame e do fato estatístico resultara para ele a convicção de que a verdadeira doutrina não era aquela, mas a oposta, e portanto que se devia admitir como normal e exemplar o desequilíbrio das faculdades, e como hipóteses patológicas todos os casos em que aquele equilíbrio fosse ininterrupto; 4o, que à vista disso, declarava à câmara que ia dar liberdade aos reclusos da Casa Verde e agasalhar nela as pessoas que se achassem nas condições agora expostas; 5o, que, tratando de descobrir a verdade científica, não se pouparia a esforços de toda a natureza, esperando da câmara igual dedicação; 6o, que restituía à câmara e aos particulares a soma do estipêndio recebido para alojamento dos supostos loucos, descontada a parte efetivamente gasta com a alimentação, roupa, etc.; o que a câmara mandaria verificar nos livros e arcas da Casa Verde.","In fact, the alienist had addressed the council exposing: — 1st, who had verified from the statistics of the village and Casa Verde, that four-fifths of the population were retired in that establishment; 2nd, that this population shift had led him to examine the foundations of his theory of brain diseases, a theory that excluded from the domain of reason all cases in which the balance of faculties was not perfect and absolute; 3, that from this examination and from the statistical fact, he was convinced that the true doctrine was not that, but the opposite, and therefore that the disequilibrium of faculties should be accepted as normal and exemplary, and as pathological hypotheses all cases in that that balance be unbroken; 4th, who, in view of this, declared to the Chamber that he was going to release the inmates of Casa Verde and shelter people who were in the conditions now exposed; 5th, that, in trying to discover scientific truth, he would spare no effort of any kind, expecting the same dedication from the camera; 6th, which refunded to the council and individuals the sum of the stipend received for housing the supposed insane, after deducting the part actually spent on food, clothing, etc.; what the council would have verified in the books and chests of Casa Verde.","The alienist informed the Council, first, that he had checked the statistics and had found that four-fifths of the population of Itaguai was in the Green House; second, that this disproportionately large number of patients had led him to reëxamine his fundamental theory of mental illness, a theory that classified as sick all people who were mentally unbalanced; third, that as a consequence of this reëxamination in the light of the statistics, he had concluded not only that his theory was unsound but also that the exactly contrary doctrine was true—that is, that normality lay in a lack of equilibrium and that the abnormal, the really sick, were the well balanced, the thoroughly rational; fourth, that in view of the foregoing he would release the persons now confined and would commit to the Green House all persons found to be mentally ill under the new theory; fifth, that he would continue to devote himself to the pursuit of scientific truth and trusted that the Council would continue to give him its support; and sixth, that he would give back the funds he had received for the board and lodging of the patients, less the amounts already expended, which could be verified by examination of his records and accounts.","In fact, the alienist had sent a formal communication to the town council with the following six points: (1) By his calculations, four fifths of the population of Itaguaí was now resident in the Casa Verde. (2) Therefore, he had reevaluated his definition of “sanity” as consisting in the perfect equilibrium of all the mental faculties. (3) Judging by the statistics of Itaguaí, he now believed the reverse to be true; i.e., that a disequilibrium of the mental faculties is normal, a perfect equilibrium, abnormal—and hypothetically pathological. (4) Consequently, he intended to release all the current residents of the Casa Verde immediately, in order to make beds available for new patients who would be chosen in accord with his revised hypothesis. (5) He would spare no effort in the continued pursuit of scientific truth and appreciated the same dedication on the part of the town council. (6) He intended to reimburse the council and the patients’ families for unspent monies paid on behalf of those mistakenly presumed to be insane, and he invited the council to inspect the financial accounts of the Casa Verde."
"— Voltai ao trabalho, concluiu o presidente, é o conselho que vos damos.","—Go back to work, concluded the president, is the advice we give you.","“My advice to you,” said the President of the Council, “is to disband and go back to work.”","“Our best advice to you,” concluded the president of the town council, “is to return to your labors.”"
"— Há melhor do que anunciar a minha ideia, é praticá-la, respondeu o alienista à insinuação do boticário.","""There's better than announcing my idea, it's putting it into practice,"" replied the alienist to the apothecary's insinuation.","“No, I won’t announce my theory to the public,” replied the alienist. “I’ll do something better: I’ll act on it.”","“Putting my idea into practice will be better than publicity,” said the alienist, in response to the apothecary’s suggestion."
"Os alienados foram alojados por classes. Fez-se uma galeria de modestos, isto é, os loucos em quem predominava esta perfeição moral; outra de tolerantes, outra de verídicos, outra de símplices, outra de leais, outra de magnânimos, outra de sagazes, outra de sinceros, etc. Naturalmente, as famílias e os amigos dos reclusos bradavam contra a teoria; e alguns tentaram compelir a câmara a cassar a licença. A câmara, porém, não esquecera a linguagem do vereador Galvão, e se cassasse a licença, vê-lo-ia na rua, e restituído ao lugar; pelo que, recusou. Simão Bacamarte oficiou aos vereadores, não agradecendo, mas felicitando-os por esse ato de vingança pessoal.","The alienated were housed by classes. A gallery was made of the modest, that is, the mad in whom this moral perfection predominated; another for tolerant, another for truthful, another for simple, another for loyal, another for magnanimous, another for sagacious, another for sincere, etc. Naturally, the families and friends of the inmates shouted against the theory; and some have tried to compel the council to revoke the license. The council, however, had not forgotten the language of councilor Galvão, and if he revoked his license, he would see him in the street, and he would be returned to the place; so he refused. Simão Bacamarte addressed the councilors, not thanking them, but congratulating them for this act of personal revenge.","The patients were segregated into classes. In one gallery lived only those whose outstanding moral quality was modesty. The notably tolerant occupied another gallery, and still others were set aside for the truthful, the guileless, the loyal, the magnanimous, the wise. Naturally, the friends and relatives of the madmen railed against the new theory. Some even tried to persuade the Town Council to cancel the authorization it had given Bacamarte. The Councilmen, however, remembered with bitterness the word of their former colleague Galvão; they did not wish to see him back in their midst, and so they refused. Simão Bacamarte sent a message to the Council, not thanking it but congratulating it on this act of personal spite.","The alienist had reorganized the Casa Verde according to various categories of insanity. There was a ward for those who were excessively modest, another for the incurably loyal, a third for those whose most notable defect was truthfulness or sincerity, a fourth for the regrettably wise, a fifth for the deplorably magnanimous, and so on. The friends and relatives of his patients naturally protested against the new theory. Some demanded that the town council rescind the operating license of the Casa Verde. The councilmen remembered the annoying language of Galvão, however. Rescinding the license would imply Galvão’s release and restoration to a seat on the council, so the councilmen refused. In a subsequent communication, Simão Bacamarte congratulated them on their display of petty spite."
"— Um excelente serviço, corrigiu o boticário.","—Excellent service, corrected the apothecary.","“A great service,” said Crispim Soares.","“Your enormous service,” corrected Soares."
"Daí em diante foi uma coleta desenfreada. Um homem não podia dar nascença ou curso à mais simples mentira do mundo, ainda daquelas que aproveitam ao inventor ou divulgador, que não fosse logo metido na Casa Verde. Tudo era loucura. Os cultores de enigmas, os fabricantes de charadas, de anagramas, os maldizentes, os curiosos da vida alheia, os que põem todo o seu cuidado na tafularia, um ou outro almotacé enfunado, ninguém escapava aos emissários do alienista. Ele respeitava as namoradas e não poupava as namoradeiras, dizendo que as primeiras cediam a um impulso natural, e as segundas a um vício. Se um homem era avaro ou pródigo ia do mesmo modo para a Casa Verde; daí a alegação de que não havia regra para a completa sanidade mental. Alguns cronistas creem que Simão Bacamarte nem sempre procedia com lisura, e citam em abono da afirmação (que não sei se pode ser aceita) o fato de ter alcançado da câmara uma postura autorizando o uso de um anel de prata no dedo polegar da mão esquerda, a toda a pessoa que, sem outra prova documental ou tradicional, declarasse ter nas veias duas ou três onças de sangue godo. Dizem esses cronistas que o fim secreto da insinuação à câmara foi enriquecer um ourives, amigo e compadre dele; mas, conquanto seja certo que o ourives viu prosperar o negócio depois da nova ordenação municipal, não o é menos que essa postura deu à Casa Verde uma multidão de inquilinos; pelo que, não se pode definir, sem temeridade, o verdadeiro fim do ilustre médico. Quanto à razão determinativa da captura e aposentação na Casa Verde de todos quantos usaram do anel, é um dos pontos mais obscuros da história de Itaguaí; a opinião mais verossímil é que eles foram recolhidos por andarem a gesticular, à toa, nas ruas, em casa, na igreja. Ninguém ignora que os doidos gesticulam muito. Em todo caso é uma simples conjetura; de positivo nada há.","From then on it was an unbridled collection. A man could not give birth or course to the simplest lie in the world, even those that benefit the inventor or disseminator, unless it was immediately thrown into Casa Verde. Everything was madness. The cultists of enigmas, the makers of riddles, of anagrams, the cursers, the curious about other people's lives, those who put all their care into tafularia, the occasional puffed-up almotacé, no one escaped the emissaries of the alienist. He respected girlfriends and did not spare flirts, saying that the former gave in to a natural impulse and the latter to an addiction. If a man was avaricious or prodigal, he went in the same way to Casa Verde; hence the claim that there was no rule for complete sanity. Some chroniclers believe that Simão Bacamarte did not always proceed with fairness, and cite in support of the statement (which I do not know if it can be accepted) the fact that he reached a position in the chamber authorizing the use of a silver ring on the thumb of his left hand. , to any person who, without any other documentary or traditional proof, declared that he had two or three ounces of Gothic blood in his veins. These chroniclers say that the secret purpose of the insinuation to the chamber was to enrich a goldsmith, his friend and compadre; but, while it is true that the goldsmith saw the business prosper after the new municipal ordinance, it is no less true that this attitude gave Casa Verde a multitude of tenants; therefore, it is not possible to define, without temerity, the true purpose of the illustrious physician. As for the decisive reason for the capture and retirement of all those who used the ring at Casa Verde, it is one of the most obscure points in the history of Itaguaí; the most plausible opinion is that they were taken away for gesticulating, aimlessly, in the streets, at home, in church. Nobody ignores that crazy people gesticulate a lot. In any case it is a simple conjecture; there is nothing positive.","From that day on, the population of the asylum increased even more rapidly than before. A person could not utter the most commonplace lie, even a lie that clearly benefited him, without being immediately committed to the Green House. Scandal-mongers, dandies, people who spent hours at puzzles, people who habitually inquired into the private lives of others, officials puffed up with authority—the alienist’s agents brought them all in. He spared sweethearts but not flirts, for he maintained that the former obeyed a healthful impulse, but that the latter yielded to a morbid desire for conquest. He discriminated against neither the avaricious nor the prodigal: both were committed to the asylum; this led people to say that the alienist’s concept of madness included practically everybody. Some of the chroniclers express doubts about Simão Bacamarte’s integrity. They note that, at his instigation, the Town Council authorized all persons who boasted of noble blood to wear a silver ring on the thumb of the left hand. These chroniclers point out that, as a consequence of the ordinance, a jeweler who was a close friend of Bacamarte became rich. Another consequence, however, was the commitment of the ring-wearers to the Green House; and the treatment of these unfortunate people, rather than the enrichment of his friend, may well have been the objective of the illustrious physician. Nobody was sure what conduct on the part of the ring-wearers had betrayed their illness. Some thought it was their tendency to gesticulate a great deal, especially with the left hand, no matter where they were—at home, in the street, even in church. Everybody knows that madmen gesticulate a great deal.","From then on, the process only accelerated. A man could not tell the simplest sort of lie without being sent instantly to the Casa Verde. Everything was madness, it seemed. Gossips, gamblers, people who exaggerated or prevaricated, those who were habitually stuck up or who merely sucked up—no one escaped the emissaries of the alienist. He left girls in love alone but would not tolerate flirts, saying that love was a natural impulse and flirtation, a vice. Misers and spendthrifts disappeared into the Casa Verde with equal frequency, giving rise to the protest that workable guidelines for sanity no longer existed. Some of the old chroniclers question Bacamarte’s integrity and cite as evidence the story of the silver ring. According to their accusation (which I cannot vouch for) he asked the town council to pass a law authorizing the use of a silver thumb ring on the left hand of any person who, without proof of any kind, claimed to descend from Portuguese nobility. These chroniclers suggest that Bacamarte’s aim was to enrich a certain silversmith, his dear friend. The silversmith clearly benefitted, but the Casa Verde did, as well, making the true motivation of the illustrious physician less than crystal clear. As for the reason why all wearers of the silver ring were taken to the Casa Verde, this is one of the murkiest issues in the entire history of Itaguaí. According to the likeliest hypothesis, they were committed for waving their hands excessively in the street, in church, even at home. Everybody knows that crazy people wave their hands excessively. However, this is merely a hypothesis. Bacamarte made no statement on the matter."
"Era um grande homem austero, Hipócrates forrado de Catão.31","He was a great austere man, Hippocrates lined with Cato.31","He was beyond doubt a man of integrity and profound objectivity, a combination of Cato and Hippocrates.","He was a hero, austere and sublime, a cross between Hippocrates and Cato."
"Costa era um dos cidadãos mais estimados de Itaguaí. Herdara quatrocentos mil cruzados em boa moeda de el-rei D. João V,15 dinheiro cuja renda bastava, segundo lhe declarou o tio no testamento, para viver “até o fim do mundo”. Tão depressa recolheu a herança, como entrou a dividi-la em empréstimos, sem usura, mil cruzados a um, dois mil a outro, trezentos a este, oitocentos àquele, a tal ponto que, no fim de cinco anos, estava sem nada. Se a miséria viesse de chofre, o pasmo de Itaguaí seria enorme; mas veio devagar; ele foi passando da opulência à abastança, da abastança à mediania, da mediania à pobreza, da pobreza à miséria, gradualmente. Ao cabo daqueles cinco anos, pessoas que levavam o chapéu ao chão, logo que ele assomava no fim da rua, agora batiam-lhe no ombro, com intimidade, davam-lhe piparotes no nariz, diziam-lhe pulhas. E o Costa sempre lhano, risonho. Nem se lhe dava de ver que os menos corteses eram justamente os que tinham ainda a dívida em aberto; ao contrário, parece que os agasalhava com maior prazer, e mais sublime resignação. Um dia, como um desses incuráveis devedores lhe atirasse uma chalaça grossa, e ele se risse dela, observou um desafeiçoado, com certa perfídia: — “Você suporta esse sujeito para ver se ele lhe paga”. Costa não se deteve um minuto, foi ao devedor e perdoou-lhe a dívida. — “Não admira, retorquiu o outro; o Costa abriu mão de uma estrela, que está no céu.” Costa era perspicaz, entendeu que ele negava todo o merecimento ao ato, atribuindo-lhe a intenção de rejeitar o que não vinham meter-lhe na algibeira. Era também pundonoroso e inventivo; duas horas depois achou um meio de provar que lhe não cabia um tal labéu: pegou de algumas dobras, e mandou-as de empréstimo ao devedor.","Costa was one of Itaguaí's most esteemed citizens. He had inherited four hundred thousand cruzados in good currency from King João V,15 money whose income was enough, as his uncle declared in his will, to live “until the end of the world”. As soon as he collected his inheritance, he began to divide it into loans, without usury, one thousand cruzados for one, two thousand for another, three hundred for this one, eight hundred for that one, to the point that, at the end of five years, he was left with nothing. If misery came suddenly, Itaguaí's astonishment would be enormous; but it came slowly; he went from opulence to affluence, from affluence to average, from average to poverty, from poverty to misery, gradually. At the end of those five years, people who took their hats to the ground as soon as he appeared at the end of the street, now tapped him on the shoulder, intimately, flicked his nose, told him whores. And Costa is always smiling, smiling. Nor did it seem to him that the least courteous were precisely those who still had outstanding debt; on the contrary, it seems that he embraced them with greater pleasure, and more sublime resignation. One day, when one of those incurable debtors threw a rude joke at him, and he laughed at it, a disaffected one observed, with a certain perfidy: — 'You put up with this fellow to see if he pays you.' Costa didn't stop for a minute, he went to the debtor and forgave him the debt. — 'No wonder,' retorted the other; Costa gave up a star, which is in the sky.” Costa was perspicacious, he understood that he denied all merit to the act, attributing to him the intention of rejecting what he had not come to put in his pocket. He was also pompous and inventive; two hours later he found a way of proving that he was not entitled to such a label: he took some folds, and sent them on loan to the debtor.","Costa was one of the most highly esteemed citizens of Itaguai. He had inherited 400,000 cruzados in the good coin of King João V. As his uncle said in the will, the interest on this capital would have been enough to support him “till the end of the world.” But as soon as he received the inheritance he began to make loans to people without interest: a thousand cruzados to one, two thousand to another, three hundred to another, eight hundred to another, until, at the end of five years, there was nothing left. If poverty had come to him all at once, the shock to the good people of Itaguai would have been enormous. But it came gradually. He went from opulence to wealth, from wealth to comfort, from comfort to indigence, and from indigence to poverty. People who, five years earlier, had always doffed their hats and bowed deeply to him as soon as they saw him a block away, now clapped him on the shoulder, flicked him on the nose, and made coarse remarks. But Costa remained affable, smiling, sublimely resigned. He was untroubled even by the fact that the least courteous were the very ones who owed him money; on the contrary, he seemed to greet them with especial pleasure. Once, when one of these eternal debtors jeered at him and Costa merely smiled, someone said to him: “You’re nice to this fellow because you still hope you can get him to pay what he owes you.” Costa did not hesitate an instant. He went to the debtor and forgave the debt. “Sure,” said the man who had made the unkind remark, “Costa canceled the debt because he knew he couldn’t collect it anyway.” Costa was no fool; he had anticipated this reaction. Inventive and jealous of his honor, he found a way two hours later to prove the slur unmerited: he took a few coins and loaned them to the same debtor.","Costa was among the most highly esteemed fellows in town. Once he had inherited a princely sum, four hundred thousand Portuguese cruzados, a sum that, invested at interest, would produce “enough,” according to the uncle who left it to him in his will, “to live on for the rest of his life, and then some.” But no sooner did the money come into Costa’s hands than he started to lend it, without interest, to anyone who asked. After five years he had practically nothing left. Had it happened all at once, the population of Itaguaí would have been dismayed, but it happened little by little. Costa slipped from opulence to affluence, from affluence to sufficiency, from sufficiency to difficulty, from difficulty to poverty, and from there to utter indigence, ever so gradually. At the end of those five years, people who had once taken off their hats when within a block of meeting Costa on the street, now clapped him familiarly on the shoulder, pinched his nose, and made brazen remarks. And Costa, ever simple and good-humored, said nothing. He even pretended not to notice that the least courteous were precisely those who still owed him money. To the contrary, when one of them made a rude joke that Costa merely laughed off and a bystander, who disliked Costa, asked scornfully whether he had no pride or suffered insults in the hopes of finally being paid back, why, Costa responded by canceling the debt on the spot. The ungrateful ex-debtor jeered at him: “How noble of Costa to cancel a debt that he couldn’t collect!” This slur at his generosity finally wounded Costa’s pride and spurred him to action. Two hours later, he laid hands on a few coins and sent them to the ungrateful ex-debtor."

"— Meus senhores, a ciência é coisa séria, e merece ser tratada com seriedade. Não dou razão dos meus atos de alienista a ninguém, salvo aos mestres e a Deus.

Poderia convidar alguns de vós, em comissão dos outros, a vir ver comigo os loucos reclusos; mas não o faço, porque seria dar-vos razão do meu sistema, o que não farei a leigos, nem a rebeldes.","“Gentlemen, science is serious business, and deserves to be treated seriously. I don't give reason for my alienist actions to anyone, except the teachers and God. If you want to amend the administration of Casa Verde, I am ready to listen to you; but if you require me to deny myself, you will gain nothing. I could invite some of you, on behalf of the others, to come and see the mad inmates with me; but I don't, because that would be giving you reason for my system, which I won't do to laymen or rebels.","“Gentlemen,” he said, “science is a serious thing and it must be treated seriously. For my professional decisions I account to no one but God and the authorities in my special field. If you wish to suggest changes in the administration of the Green House, I am ready to listen to you; but if you wish me to be untrue to myself, further talk would be futile. I could invite you to appoint a committee to come and study the way I treat the madmen who have been committed to my care, but I shall not, for to do so would be to account to you for my methods and this I shall never do to a group of rebels or, for that matter, to laymen of any description.”","“Science is a serious thing, gentlemen, and it deserves to be treated seriously. In matters of alienism, I answer to no one, save to scientific authority and to God. If you want to discuss my management of the Casa Verde, I am willing to hear you. But if you ask me to betray my principles, you will gain nothing thereby. I could invite you to send a delegation with me to observe my treatment of the demented—I could, but I will not, because I will never explain my therapeutic regimen to an unschooled mob.”"

"— Não, senhor. Eu lhe digo como o negócio se passou. O defunto meu tio não era mau homem; mas quando estava furioso era capaz de nem tirar o chapéu ao Santíssimo. Ora, um dia, pouco tempo antes de morrer, descobriu que um escravo lhe roubara um boi; imagine como ficou. A cara era um pimentão; todo ele tremia, a boca escumava; lembra-me como se fosse hoje. Então um homem feio, cabeludo, em mangas de camisa, chegou-se a ele e pediu água. Meu tio (Deus lhe fale n’alma!) respondeu que fosse beber ao rio ou ao inferno. O homem olhou para ele, abriu a mão em ar de ameaça, e rogou esta praga: — “Todo o seu dinheiro não há de durar mais de sete anos e um dia, tão certo como isto ser o sino salamão!”.16 E mostrou o sino salamão impresso no braço. Foi isto, meu senhor; foi esta praga daquele maldito.","- No sir. I'll tell you how the deal went. My late uncle was not a bad man; but when he was furious he might not even take his hat off to the Blessed Sacrament. Now, one day, shortly before he died, he discovered that a slave had stolen an ox from him; imagine how it turned out. The face was a pepper; he was trembling all over, his mouth was foaming; remember me like it was today. Then an ugly, hairy man in shirt-sleeves approached him and asked for water. My uncle (God speak to his soul!) replied that he should go to the river or hell to drink. The man looked at him, opened his hand in an air of threat, and begged this curse: — “All your money will not last more than seven years and a day, as surely as this is the salamon bell!”.16 And showed the salamon bell printed on the arm. That was it, my lord; it was this curse of that damned one.","“No, Doctor. I’ll tell you exactly what happened. My uncle was not ordinarily a bad man, but when he became angry he was so fierce that he would not even take off his hat to a religious procession. Well, one day, a short time before he died, he discovered that a slave had stolen an ox from him. His face became as red as a pepper; he shook from head to foot; he foamed at the mouth. Then an ugly, shaggy-haired man came up to him and asked for a drink of water. My uncle (may God show him the light!) told the man to go drink in the river—or in hell, for all he cared. The man glared at him, raised his hand threateningly, and uttered this curse: ‘Your money will not last more than seven years and a day, as surely as this is the star of David!’ And he showed a star of David tattooed on his arm. That was the cause of it all, Doctor—the hex put on the money by that evil man.”","“No, sir. I’ll tell you how it happened. My late uncle was not a bad man, but when he got mad, he was capable of anything—why, he wouldn’t take off his hat for a religious procession if it passed right in front of him! Now, just before he died he discovered that a slave had stolen his ox, and he about had a fit. He started trembling and foaming at the mouth, and his face turned as red as a tomato. I can see him now. And then up comes an ugly, long-haired fellow in shirt sleeves and asks him for a glass of water. My uncle, God rest his soul, told him to go drink from the river or go to hell. And the man raises his hand and says ‘Curse you, and may all your wealth vanish in seven years and one day, by this Star of David!’ and he pointed to a tattoo on his arm. A Jew’s curse, Dr. Bacamarte."
"Isso é isto. Simão Bacamarte achou em si os característicos do perfeito equilíbrio mental e moral; pareceu-lhe que possuía a sagacidade, a paciência, a perseverança, a tolerância, a veracidade, o vigor moral, a lealdade, todas as qualidades enfim que podem formar um acabado mentecapto. Duvidou logo, é certo, e chegou mesmo a concluir que era ilusão; mas sendo homem prudente, resolveu convocar um conselho de amigos, a quem interrogou com franqueza. A opinião foi afirmativa.","That's it. Simão Bacamarte found in himself the characteristics of perfect mental and moral balance; it seemed to him that he possessed the sagacity, the patience, the perseverance, the tolerance, the veracity, the moral vigor, the loyalty, all the qualities, in short, that can form a complete fool. He immediately doubted it, it is true, and even came to the conclusion that it was an illusion; but being a prudent man, he resolved to call a council of friends, whom he questioned frankly. The opinion was in the affirmative.","That’s it, of course.” What Simão Bacamarte meant was that he had found in himself the perfect, undeniable case of insanity. He possessed wisdom, patience, tolerance, truthfulness, loyalty, and moral fortitude—all the qualities that go to make an utter madman. But then he questioned his own self-observation. Surely he must be imperfect in some way. To ascertain the truth about himself he convoked a gathering of his friends and questioned them. He begged them to answer with absolute frankness. They all agreed that he had not been mistaken.","And “that” was this. Simão Bacamarte had found all the characteristics of a perfect mental and moral equilibrium within himself. Patience, sagacity, tolerance, veracity, perseverance, loyalty—all the qualities, in other words, that defined madness. He had reservations about this conclusion, too, of course, and almost discarded it as illusory. Prudent man that he was, however, he assembled a jury of his friends and asked for a frank opinion. Their verdict was affirmative."
"O alienista atendeu então; os gritos aproximavam-se, terríveis, ameaçadores; ele compreendeu tudo. Levantou-se da cadeira de espaldar em que estava sentado, fechou o livro, e, a passo firme e tranquilo, foi depositá-lo na estante. Como a introdução do volume desconcertasse um pouco a linha dos dois tomos contíguos, Simão Bacamarte cuidou de corrigir esse defeito mínimo, e, aliás, interessante. Depois disse à mulher que se recolhesse, que não fizesse nada.","The alienist then answered; the screams were approaching, terrible, threatening; he understood everything. He got up from the chair he was sitting on, closed the book, and, with a steady, calm step, went to place it on the shelf. As the introduction of the volume somewhat disconcerted the line of the two contiguous volumes, Simão Bacamarte took care to correct this minimal, and, incidentally, interesting defect. Then he told the woman to retire, not to do anything.","The alienist listened. The shouts were coming closer and closer, threatening, terrifying. He understood. Rising from the armchair, he shut the book and, with firm, calm step, walked over to the bookcase and put the volume back in its place. The insertion of the volume caused the books on either side of it to be slightly out of line. Simão Bacamarte carefully straightened them. Then he asked his wife to go to her room.","The alienist listened to the shouts, ever closer and more menacing, and he grasped the entire situation. Rising from the armchair in which he had been seated, he closed his book and went with firm and unhurried steps to deposit it on the bookshelf. Because returning the volume to its place pushed the contiguous volumes slightly out of alignment, Simão Bacamarte took a moment to correct that minimal but meaningful imperfection. Then he told his wife to stay inside and do nothing."
"— Onze mortos e vinte e cinco feridos, repetiu o alienista, depois de acompanhar o barbeiro até à porta. Eis aí dois lindos casos de doença cerebral.

Quanto à toleima dos que o aclamaram não é preciso outra prova além dos onze mortos e vinte e cinco feridos. — Dois lindos casos!","""Eleven dead and twenty-five wounded,"" repeated the alienist, after escorting the barber to the door. Here are two beautiful cases of brain disease. The symptoms of duplicity and shamelessness of this barber are positive. As for the foolishness of those who acclaimed him, no other proof is needed than the eleven dead and twenty-five wounded. — Two beautiful cases!","“Eleven dead, twenty-five wounded,” repeated the alienist after the visitors had left. “Two beautiful cases. This barber shows unmistakable symptoms of psychopathic duplicity. As for proof of the insanity of the people who acclaim him, what more could one ask than the fact that eleven were killed and twenty-five wounded? Two beautiful cases!”","“Eleven dead and twenty-five wounded,” he repeated, after seeing the barber to the door. “Here are two textbook cases of cerebral insufficiency: the barber’s pathological duplicity and the idiocy of his followers.”"

"— O pasmo de Vossa Senhoria, atalhou gravemente o barbeiro, vem de não atender à grave responsabilidade do governo. O povo, tomado de uma cega piedade, que lhe dá em tal caso legítima indignação, pode exigir do governo certa ordem de atos; mas este, com a responsabilidade que lhe incumbe, não os deve praticar, ao menos integralmente, e tal é a nossa situação. A generosa revolução que ontem derrubou uma câmara vilipendiada e corrupta, pediu em altos brados o arrasamento da Casa Verde; mas pode entrar no ânimo do governo eliminar a loucura? Não. E se o governo não a pode eliminar, está ao menos apto para discriminá-la, reconhecê-la? Também não; é matéria de ciência. Logo, em assunto tão melindroso, o governo não pode, não deve, não quer dispensar o concurso de Vossa Senhoria. O que lhe pede é que de certa maneira demos alguma satisfação ao povo. Unamo-nos, e o povo saberá obedecer. Um dos alvitres aceitáveis, se Vossa Senhoria não indicar outro, seria fazer retirar da Casa Verde aqueles enfermos que estiverem quase curados, e bem assim os maníacos de pouca monta, etc. Desse modo, sem grande perigo, mostraremos alguma tolerância e benignidade.","—Your Lordship's astonishment, the barber said gravely, comes from not attending to the serious responsibility of the government. The people, taken by a blind pity, which in such a case gives them legitimate indignation, can demand from the government a certain order of acts; but the latter, with the responsibility incumbent upon him, must not practice them, at least in their entirety, and such is our situation. The generous revolution that yesterday overthrew a vilified and corrupt chamber, loudly called for the razing of Casa Verde; but can it enter into the spirit of the government to eliminate madness? Not. And if the government cannot eliminate it, is it at least able to discriminate against it, to recognize it? Neither; it's a matter of science. Therefore, in such a sensitive matter, the government cannot, must not, does not want to dispense with your Lordship's assistance. What he asks is that we somehow give some satisfaction to the people. Let us unite, and the people will know how to obey. One of the acceptable alternatives, if Your Lordship does not indicate another, would be to remove from Casa Verde those sick who are almost cured, as well as minor maniacs, etc. In this way, without great danger, we will show some tolerance and kindness.","“That is because you don’t appreciate the grave responsibility of government,” interrupted the barber. “The people, in their blindness, may feel righteous indignation about something that they do not understand; they have a right, then, to ask the government to act along certain lines. The government, however, must remember its duty to promote the public interest, whether or not this interest is in full accord with the demands made by the public itself. The revolution, which yesterday overthrew a corrupt and despicable Town Council, screams for destruction of the Green House. But the government must remain calm and objective. It knows that elimination of the Green House would not eliminate insanity. It knows that the mentally ill must receive treatment. It knows also that it cannot itself provide this treatment and that it even lacks the ability to distinguish the sane from the insane. These are matters for science, not for politics. They are matters requiring the sort of delicate, trained judgment that you, not we, are fitted to exercise. All I ask is that you help me give some degree of satisfaction to the people of Itaguai. If you and the government present a united front and propose a compromise of some sort, the people will accept it. Let me suggest, unless you have something better to propose, that we free those patients who are practically cured and those whose illnesses are relatively mild. In this way we can show how benign and generous we are without seriously handicapping your work.”","“You would not be so surprised, sir,” interrupted the barber gravely, “if you considered the responsibility that rests upon my shoulders. The blind, uncomprehending indignation of the common people leads them to demand a certain kind of measure from their government, but the government must exercise superior judgment, moderating that blind impulse and taking only such measures as may be appropriate. That is the situation in which I find myself today. Yesterday, enflamed by their justified wrath at the corruption of their former rulers, the People called for the abolition of the Casa Verde—but can government abolish madness? No. Can government diagnose it or determine the correct therapy for it? No, a thousand times, no! Government cannot usurp the role proper to Science. Therefore, the new administration cannot do without your services, sir, nor does it wish to. Let us stand together, and the people will obey us. We need only to preserve appearances and placate the rabble. For example, we might release from the Casa Verde a few harmless lunatics, a few who are almost cured, etcetera, etcetera. In that way we would demonstrate tolerance and benevolence with little risk to public safety.”"

"— Já há algum tempo que eu desconfiava, disse gravemente o marido. A modéstia com que ela vivera em ambos os matrimônios não podia conciliar-se com o furor das sedas, veludos, rendas e pedras preciosas que manifestou, logo que voltou do Rio de Janeiro. Desde então comecei a observá-la. Suas conversas eram todas sobre esses objetos; se eu lhe falava das antigas cortes, inquiria logo da forma dos vestidos das damas; se uma senhora a visitava, na minha ausência, antes de me dizer o objeto da visita, descrevia-me o trajo, aprovando umas coisas e censurando outras. Um dia, creio que Vossa Reverendíssima há de lembrar-se, propôs-se a fazer anualmente um vestido para a imagem de Nossa Senhora da matriz. Tudo isto eram sintomas graves; esta noite, porém, declarou-se a total demência. Tinha escolhido, preparado, enfeitado o vestuário que levaria ao baile da câmara municipal; só hesitava entre um colar de granada e outro de safira. Anteontem perguntou-me qual deles levaria; respondi-lhe que um ou outro lhe ficava bem. Ontem repetiu a pergunta, ao almoço; pouco depois de jantar fui achá-la calada e pensativa. — Que tem? perguntei-lhe. — Queria levar o colar de granada, mas acho o de safira tão bonito! — Pois leve o de safira. — Ah! mas onde fica o de granada? — Enfim, passou a tarde sem novidade. Ceamos, e deitamo-nos. Alta noite, seria hora e meia, acordo e não a vejo; levanto-me, vou ao quarto de vestir, acho-a diante dos dois colares, ensaiando-os ao espelho, ora um, ora outro. Era evidente a demência: recolhi-a logo.","""I've suspected it for some time now,"" said her husband gravely. The modesty with which she had lived in both marriages could not be reconciled with the frenzy of silks, velvets, lace and precious stones that she manifested as soon as she returned from Rio de Janeiro. Since then I started watching her. Their conversations were all about these objects; if I told him about the old courts, he would immediately inquire about the shape of ladies' dresses; if a lady visited her, in my absence, before telling me the object of the visit, she would describe the dress to me, approving some things and censuring others. One day, I believe Your Reverend will remember, she proposed to make an annual dress for the image of Our Lady of the Matrix. All these were serious symptoms; this night, however, utter insanity was declared. She had chosen, prepared, decorated the clothes she would wear to the town hall ball; she was only hesitating between a garnet necklace and a sapphire necklace. The day before yesterday he asked me which one I would take; I replied that one or the other suited him well. Yesterday he repeated the question at lunch; shortly after dinner I found her silent and thoughtful. - That has? I asked him. ""I wanted to take the garnet necklace, but I think the sapphire necklace is so pretty!"" ""Then take the sapphire one."" — Oh! But where is the grenade? “Anyway, the afternoon passed without news. We ate, and we went to bed. Late at night, it would be half an hour, I wake up and don't see her; I get up, go to the dressing room, find her in front of the two necklaces, rehearsing them in the mirror, now one, now the other. The insanity was evident: I picked it up right away.","“I had long suspected that she was a sick woman,” said the alienist in response to a question from Father Lopes. “Her moderation in all other matters was hard to reconcile with her mania for silks, velvets, laces, and jewelry, a mania that began immediately after her return from Rio de Janeiro. It was then that I started to observe her closely. Her conversation was always about these objects. If I talked to her about the royal courts of earlier times, she wanted to know what kind of clothes the women wore. If a lady visited her while I was out, the first thing my wife told me, even before mentioning the purpose of the visit, was how the woman was dressed and which jewels or articles of clothing were pretty and which were ugly. Once (I think Your Reverence will remember this) she said she was going to make a new dress every year for Our Lady of the Mother Church. All these symptoms indicated a serious condition. Tonight, however, the full gravity of her illness became manifest. She had selected the entire outfit she would wear to the ball and had it all fixed and ready. All except one thing: she couldn’t decide between a garnet necklace and a sapphire necklace. The day before yesterday she asked me which she should wear. I told her it didn’t matter, that they both were very becoming. Yesterday at lunch she repeated the question. After dinner she was silent and pensive. I asked her what was the matter. ‘I want to wear my beautiful garnet necklace, but my sapphire one is so lovely.’ ‘Then wear the sapphire necklace.’ ‘But then I can’t wear the garnet necklace.’ In the middle of the night, about half-past one, I awoke. She was not in bed. I got up and went to the dressing-room. There she sat with the two necklaces, in front of the mirror, trying on first one and then the other. An obvious case of dementia. I had her put away immediately.”","“I had suspected it for some time,” said her husband. “She always lived quite modestly until her trip to Rio de Janeiro, and then that sudden fever for silks, velvet, lace, and jewels … the contrast was just too stark. So I began to observe her behavior. She could converse about nothing else. If I mentioned the history of the royal court at Lisbon, she would ask about the cut of the ladies’ dresses. If a woman paid her a visit during my absence, she would describe the visitor’s clothing item by item, approving of some and censuring others, before she mentioned the purpose of the visit. One day, I believe you will recall, Father, she promised to make a new dress every year for the image of Our Lady on the principal altar. All these symptoms were serious enough … but then, last night, she went over the edge. Her dress for this evening’s gala was all ready except for the choice of a necklace, whether one of sapphires or one of garnets. Day before yesterday she asked me which she should wear, and I told her that she looked beautiful in both. Yesterday at lunch she repeated the question and afterward I noticed that she was unusually quiet and pensive. ‘ What’s the matter?’ I asked. ‘I wanted to wear the garnet necklace,’ she said, ‘but the sapphires are so pretty!’ I said, ‘Fine, wear the sapphire necklace,’ but she objected: ‘What about the garnets?’ The rest of the afternoon passed without incident. We had dinner and went to sleep at the usual hour. I woke up in the middle of the night—it was about half past one, I believe— and she wasn’t in bed. So I got up, and there she was in her dressing room, sitting in front of the mirror, trying on the two necklaces one after the other: garnets, sapphires, garnets, sapphires. I had her committed immediately.”"

"Mas a prova mais evidente da influência de Simão Bacamarte foi a docilidade com que a câmara lhe entregou o próprio presidente. Este digno magistrado tinha declarado em plena sessão, que não se contentava, para lavá-lo da afronta dos Canjicas, com menos de trinta almudes30 de sangue; palavra que chegou aos ouvidos do alienista por boca do secretário da câmara, entusiasmado de tamanha energia. Simão Bacamarte começou por meter o secretário na Casa Verde, e foi dali à câmara, à qual declarou que o presidente estava padecendo da “demência dos touros”, um gênero que ele pretendia estudar, com grande vantagem para os povos. A câmara a princípio hesitou, mas acabou cedendo.","But the most evident proof of Simão Bacamarte's influence was the docility with which the council handed over the president himself. This worthy magistrate had declared in the middle of the session that he was not content to wash him from the affront of the Canjicas with less than thirty almudes30 of blood; word that reached the ears of the alienist through the mouth of the secretary of the chamber, excited with such energy. Simão Bacamarte started by putting the secretary in Casa Verde, and from there he went to the chamber, where he declared that the president was suffering from “bull dementia”, a genre he intended to study, to the great advantage of the people. The camera hesitated at first, but eventually relented.","Perhaps the most striking proof of the alienist’s influence was the docility with which the Town Council surrendered to him its own President. This worthy official had declared that the affront to the Council could be washed away only by the blood of the Stewed Corners. Bacamarte learned of this through the Secretary of the Council, who repeated the President’s words with immense enthusiasm. The alienist first committed the Secretary to the Green House and then proceeded to the town hall. He told the Council that its President was suffering from hemoferal mania, an illness that he planned to study in depth, with, he hoped, immense benefit to the world. The Council hesitated for a moment and then acquiesced.","The best measure of Bacamarte’s influence, however, was the docility with which the remaining councilmen turned over their own president. That worthy magistrate had declared during a council meeting that he wanted thirty buckets of blood to wash away the affront that the Pork Chop Revolution had done to his honor, words repeated to the alienist—enthusiastically and in terms of admiration—by the council secretary. Simão Bacamarte first took the secretary to the Casa Verde, then went straight to the town hall and announced to the council that its president had a dangerous form of lunacy that must be studied. The council hesitated at first but gave in, after some discussion, for the benefit of mankind."
"D. Evarista compreendeu, sorriu e respondeu com muita resignação:","D. Evarista understood, smiled and replied with great resignation:","Dona Evarista understood, smiled, and replied with infinite resignation:",And so Dona Evarista cheerfully resigned herself:
— Adeus! soluçaram enfim as damas e o boticário.,- Goodbye! finally sobbed the ladies and the apothecary.,After the departure the druggist and the alienist mounted their horses and rode homeward.,"“Farewell,” sobbed the ladies. “Farewell,” sobbed Crispim Soares."
"O alienista espiou pela janela, e ainda ouviu este resto de uma pequena fala do barbeiro às trinta pessoas que o aclamavam:","The alienist peered through the window, and he still heard this remnant of a little speech from the barber to the thirty people who cheered him:",The alienist went to the window and heard part of the barber’s speech:,The alienist looked out the window and heard a bit of the barber’s address to the thirty-or-so people.
"Apagaram-se as luminárias, reconstituíram-se as famílias, tudo parecia reposto nos antigos eixos. Reinava a ordem, a câmara exercia outra vez o governo, sem nenhuma pressão externa; o próprio presidente e o vereador Freitas tornaram aos seus lugares. O barbeiro Porfírio, ensinado pelos acontecimentos, tendo “provado tudo”, como o poeta disse de Napoleão, e mais alguma coisa, porque Napoleão não provou a Casa Verde, o barbeiro achou preferível a glória obscura da navalha e da tesoura às calamidades brilhantes do poder; foi, é certo, processado; mas a população da vila implorou a clemência de Sua Majestade; daí o perdão. João Pina foi absolvido, atendendo-se a que ele derrocara um rebelde. Os cronistas pensam que deste fato é que nasceu o nosso adágio: — ladrão que furta a ladrão, tem cem anos de perdão; — adágio imoral, é verdade, mas grandemente útil.","The lights were turned off, the families were reconstituted, everything seemed to be restored to the old axes. Order reigned, the chamber exercised government again, without any external pressure; the president himself and councilor Freitas returned to their seats. The barber Porfírio, taught by events, having “proved everything”, as the poet said of Napoleon, and something else, because Napoleon did not taste Casa Verde, the barber found the dark glory of the razor and scissors preferable to the brilliant calamities of the power; was, it is true, prosecuted; but the people of the village begged His Majesty's clemency; hence the forgiveness. João Pina was acquitted, given that he had overthrown a rebel. The chroniclers think that our adage was born from this fact: — a thief who steals from a thief has a hundred years of pardon; — immoral adage, it is true, but greatly useful.","The lanterns were taken down, the ex-patients resumed their former lives, everything appeared normal. Councilman Freitas and the President returned to their accustomed places, and the Council governed Itaguai without external interference. Porfírio the barber had “experienced everything,” as the poet said of Napoleon; indeed, Porfírio had experienced more than Napoleon, for Napoleon was never committed to the Green House. The barber now found the obscure security of his trade preferable to the brilliant calamities of power. He was tried for his crimes and convicted, but the people begged His Majesty to pardon their ex-Protector, and His Majesty did so. The authorities decided not to prosecute João Pina, for he had overthrown an unlawful ruler. The chroniclers maintain that Pina’s absolution inspired our adage: A judge will never throw the book At crook who steals from other crook. An immoral adage, but immensely useful.","The public illuminations were finally extinguished, the families of Itaguaí, finally reunited, and everything that had been out of kilter seemed to function, once again, the way it should. Order reigned anew, and the town council governed without outside interference. Its president and Councilman Freitas were back, too. As for Porfírio, the ex-protector, he had learned his lesson and decided that the obscure glories of razor and scissors were preferable to the brilliant calamities of public life. He had to go to court, of course, but the townspeople implored His Majesty for clemency and managed to secure a pardon for him. The other barber, João Pina, was absolved of the charge of rebellion because he had overthrown an illegal government. All complaints against the alienist evaporated, and not only that: resentment for his past actions evaporated, as well."
"Simão Bacamarte recebeu-o com a alegria própria de um sábio, uma alegria abotoada de circunspecção até o pescoço.","Simão Bacamarte received him with the joy of a wise man, a joy buttoned up to his neck with circumspection.","Simão Bacamarte greeted him joyfully, but he wore his joy as a wise man should—buttoned up to the neck with circumspection.",Simão Bacamarte greeted him with quiet enthusiasm.
"— O senhor trabalhará durante o dia na botica, mas almoçará e jantará com sua mulher, e cá passará as noites, e os domingos e dias santos.","— You will work during the day at the apothecary, but you will have lunch and dinner with your wife, and you will spend the nights here, and on Sundays and holy days.","“There is no reason,” he said, “why you and your wife should not eat lunch and dinner together every day at the Green House. You may even stay with her at night.”",“You can still work in your shop every day.”
"Quanto à ideia de ampliar o território da loucura, achou-a o boticário extravagante; mas a modéstia, principal adorno de seu espírito, não lhe sofreu confessar outra coisa além de um nobre entusiasmo; declarou-a sublime e verdadeira, e acrescentou que era “caso de matraca”. Esta expressão não tem equivalente no estilo moderno. Naquele tempo, Itaguaí, que como as demais vilas, arraiais e povoações da colônia, não dispunha de imprensa, tinha dois modos de divulgar uma notícia: ou por meio de cartazes manuscritos e pregados na porta da câmara e da matriz; — ou por meio de matraca. Eis em que consistia este segundo uso. Contratava-se um homem, por um ou mais dias, para andar as ruas do povoado, com uma matraca na mão. De quando em quando tocava a matraca, reunia-se gente, e ele anunciava o que lhe incumbiam, — um remédio para sezões, umas terras lavradias, um soneto, um donativo eclesiástico, a melhor tesoura da vila, o mais belo discurso do ano, etc. O sistema tinha inconvenientes para a paz pública; mas era conservado pela grande energia de divulgação que possuía. Por exemplo, um dos vereadores, — aquele justamente que mais se opusera à criação da Casa Verde, — desfrutava a reputação de perfeito educador de cobras e macacos, e aliás nunca domesticara um só desses bichos; mas, tinha o cuidado de fazer trabalhar a matraca todos os meses. E dizem as crônicas que algumas pessoas afirmavam ter visto cascavéis dançando no peito do vereador; afirmação perfeitamente falsa, mas só devida à absoluta confiança no sistema. Verdade, verdade; nem todas as instituições do antigo regime, mereciam o desprezo do nosso século.","As for the idea of expanding the territory of madness, the apothecary found it extravagant; but modesty, the chief adornment of his spirit, did not suffer him to confess anything other than a noble enthusiasm; declared it sublime and true, and added that it was “a case of rattlesnake”. This expression has no equivalent in the modern style. At that time, Itaguaí, which, like other towns, villages and settlements in the colony, did not have a press, had two ways of disseminating news: either through handwritten posters nailed to the door of the town hall and the main church; — or by means of a rattle. Here is what this second use consisted of. A man was hired, for one or more days, to walk the streets of the village, with a rattle in his hand. From time to time the rattle would ring, people would gather, and he would announce what was incumbent on him — a remedy for sezões, some farmland, a sonnet, an ecclesiastical donation, the best scissors in town, the most beautiful speech of the year. , etc. The system had drawbacks for public peace; but it was preserved by the great energy of dissemination it possessed. For example, one of the councilors — the one who was most opposed to the creation of Casa Verde — enjoyed the reputation of being a perfect educator of snakes and monkeys, and moreover, he had never domesticated a single one of these animals; but he was careful to make the rattle work every month. And the chronicles say that some people claimed to have seen rattlesnakes dancing on the councilman's chest; perfectly false statement, but only due to absolute trust in the system. True true; not all the institutions of the old regime deserved the contempt of our century.","As for the basic idea of enlarging the realm of insanity, the druggist found it a little far-fetched; but modesty, his chief virtue, kept him from stating his opinion. Instead, he expressed a noble enthusiasm. He declared the idea sublime and added that it was “something for the noisemaker.” This expression requires explanation. Like the other towns, villages, and settlements in the colony at that time, Itaguai had no newspaper. It used two media for the publication of news: hand-written posters nailed to the doors of the town hall and of the main church, and the noisemaker. This is how the latter medium worked: a man was hired for one or more days to go through the streets rattling a noisemaker. A crowd would gather and the man would announce whatever he had been paid to announce: a cure for malaria, a gift to the Church, some farm land for sale, and the like. He might even be engaged to read a sonnet to the people. The system continually disturbed the peace of the community, but it survived a long time because of its almost miraculous effectiveness. Incredible as it may seem, the noisemaker actually enabled merchants to sell inferior goods at superior prices and third-rate authors to pass as geniuses. Yes, indeed, not all the institutions of the old regime deserve our century’s contempt.","He found the notion of radically expanding the definition of insanity farfetched, but modesty, his finest quality, prevented him from saying so. Instead, he declared the idea sublime and self-evident, and he even called it “something for the noisemaker.” This last phrase cannot be translated into a modern idiom and will have to be explained. Itaguaí, like the other localities of colonial Brazil, had no newspaper, and there were only two ways of publicizing anything. The first method was posting a hand-lettered announcement on the door of the church or the town hall, and the second was by means of the noise-maker. Here is how the second method functioned. A man was hired to walk up and down through the streets for one or more days getting people’s attention with a wooden noise-making device. When a crowd had gathered to hear him, he announced whatever he had been paid to announce: a cure for fevers, a house for rent, whatever. He might even recite a sonnet or read an oration. In truth, the noisemaker could be a nuisance, but it was also highly effective. For example, one of the town councilmen of Itaguaí—the very one who had opposed the construction of the Casa Verde—periodically hired the noisemaker to publicize his skill as a snake charmer. The reputation was entirely undeserved; he had, in fact, never charmed any sort of reptile. And, yet, many townspeople did not hesitate to affirm that they had seen rattlesnakes dance on the councilman’s chest. Truth be told, the past can still teach our modern age a thing or two."
"D. Evarista sentiu faltar-lhe o chão debaixo dos pés. Nunca dos nuncas vira o Rio de Janeiro, que posto não fosse sequer uma pálida sombra do que hoje é, todavia era alguma coisa mais do que Itaguaí. Ver o Rio de Janeiro, para ela, equivalia ao sonho do hebreu cativo.11 Agora, principalmente, que o marido assentara de vez naquela povoação interior, agora é que ela perdera as últimas esperanças de respirar os ares da nossa boa cidade; e justamente agora é que ele a convidava a realizar os seus desejos de menina e moça. D. Evarista não pôde dissimular o gosto de semelhante proposta. Simão Bacamarte pegou-lhe na mão e sorriu, — um sorriso tanto ou quanto filosófico, além de conjugal, em que parecia traduzir-se este pensamento: — “Não há remédio certo para as dores da alma; esta senhora definha, porque lhe parece que a não amo; dou-lhe o Rio de Janeiro, e consola-se”. E porque era homem estudioso tomou nota da observação.","Dona Evarista felt the ground missing from under her feet. Never before had he seen Rio de Janeiro, which was not even a pale shadow of what it is today, yet it was something more than Itaguaí. Seeing Rio de Janeiro, for her, was equivalent to the dream of a captive Hebrew.11 Now, mainly, that her husband had settled for good in that interior village, now she had lost her last hopes of breathing the air of our good city; and it was just now that he was inviting her to fulfill her desires as a girl and girl. D. Evarista could not hide the taste for such a proposal. Simão Bacamarte took her hand and smiled — a smile as philosophical as it was conjugal, in which this thought seemed to translate: — “There is no right remedy for the pain of the soul; this lady languishes, because it seems to her that I don't love her; I give you Rio de Janeiro, and you console yourself”. And because he was a studious man, he took note of the remark.","Dona Evarista felt as if the floor had vanished and she were floating on air. She had never been to Rio, which, although hardly a shadow of what it is today, was, by comparison with Itaguai, a great and fascinating metropolis. Ever since childhood she had dreamed of going there. She longed for Rio as a Hebrew in the captivity must have longed for Jerusalem, but with her husband settled so definitively in Itaguai she had lost hope. And now, of a sudden, he was permitting her to realize her dream. Dona Evarista could not hide her elation. Simão Bacamarte took her by the hand and smiled in a manner at once conjugal and philosophical. “How strange is the therapy of the soul!” he thought. “This lady is wasting away because she thinks I do not love her. I give her Rio de Janeiro and she is well again.” And he made a note of the phenomenon.","Dona Evarista felt the earth move beneath her feet. She had never, ever been to Rio de Janeiro, which, while not yet what it is today, was considerably grander than Itaguaí, and she had long since given up hope of seeing our fair city. But now, when she least expected it, her husband offered her the opportunity to realize her girlhood dreams, and she could not disguise her satisfaction. Simão Bacamarte took her by the hand and smiled a conjugal—as well as a somewhat philosophical—smile that seemed to say: “How mysterious is therapy for an ailing spirit! This woman was wasting away, thinking I didn’t love her, when a trip to Rio was all she really needed.” And being a studious man, he made note of the observation."

"A irritação dos agitadores foi enorme. O barbeiro declarou que iam dali levantar a bandeira da rebelião, e destruir a Casa Verde; que Itaguaí não podia continuar a servir de cadáver aos estudos e experiências de um déspota; que muitas pessoas estimáveis, algumas distintas, outras humildes mas dignas de apreço, jaziam nos cubículos da Casa Verde; que o despotismo científico do alienista complicava-se do espírito de ganância, visto que os loucos, ou supostos tais, não eram tratados de graça: as famílias, e em falta delas a câmara, pagavam ao alienista…","The agitators' irritation was enormous. The barber declared that they were going from there to raise the flag of the rebellion, and to destroy Casa Verde; that Itaguaí could no longer serve as a corpse for the studies and experiences of a despot; that many estimable people, some distinguished, others humble but worthy of appreciation, lay in the cubicles of Casa Verde; that the scientific despotism of the alienist was complicated by the spirit of greed, since the insane, or supposed such, were not treated for free: the families, and in their absence the camera, paid the alienist…","The group could hardly contain its anger. The barber declared that the people would march to the Green House and destroy it; that Itaguai must no longer be used as a corpse for dissection in the experiments of a medical despot; that several esteemed and even distinguished individuals, not to mention many humble but estimable persons, lay confined in the cubicles of the Green House; that the alienist was clearly motivated by greed, for his compensation varied directly with the number of alleged madmen in his care—","The agitators were furious. The barber called for rebellion and the destruction of the Casa Verde. No longer could Itaguaí be a guinea pig for experimentation. Too many people, whether prominent or humble, languished in the cubicles of the Casa Verde. And moreover, the scientific despotism of the alienist had been complicated by a profit motive, because his patients were not treated free of charge. Their families or, in some cases, the town council had to foot the bill."
"— Você, que é íntimo dele, não nos podia dizer o que há, o que houve, que motivo…","— You, who are intimate with him, could not tell us what is, what happened, what reason...","“You who are his intimate friend,” they asked the druggist, “can’t you tell us what’s going on, what happened, what reason . . . ?”","“You’re his friend. Can’t you tell us what’s going on, what his motives are?”"
"Toda a gente advertiu no absoluto silêncio desta proclamação acerca da Casa Verde; e, segundo uns, não podia haver mais vivo indício dos projetos tenebrosos do barbeiro. O perigo era tanto maior quanto que, no meio mesmo desses graves sucessos, o alienista metera na Casa Verde umas sete ou oito pessoas, entre elas duas senhoras, sendo um dos homens aparentado com o Protetor. Não era um repto, um ato intencional; mas todos o interpretaram dessa maneira, e a vila respirou com a esperança de que o alienista dentro de vinte e quatro horas estaria a ferros, e destruído o terrível cárcere.","Everyone warned in the absolute silence of this proclamation about Casa Verde; and, according to some, there could not be more vivid evidence of the barber's dark projects. The danger was all the greater since, even in the midst of these serious events, the alienist had put seven or eight people into Casa Verde, including two ladies, one of the men being related to the Protector. It was not a challenge, an intentional act; but everyone interpreted it that way, and the village took a breath with the hope that within twenty-four hours the alienist would be in irons, and the terrible prison destroyed.","Everyone remarked that the proclamation said nothing whatever about the Green House, and some considered this ominous. The danger seemed all the greater when, in the midst of the important changes that were taking place, the alienist committed to the Green House some seven or eight new patients, including a relative of the Protector. Everybody erroneously interpreted Bacamarte’s action as a challenge to the barber and thought it likely that within twenty-four hours the terrible prison would be destroyed and the alienist would be in chains.","Everyone noticed the proclamation’s total silence regarding the Casa Verde, a bad sign according to some. The danger seemed all the greater because, during the momentous events of that afternoon, the alienist had taken seven or eight more people to the Casa Verde, two of them women. Another was a relative of the protector, and while this was not, in point of fact, an intentional provocation on the part of the alienist, everyone interpreted it that way. The town held its breath hoping, within another twenty-four hours, to see the alienist himself locked up and his so-called asylum destroyed forever."
— Falso?,— False?,“Not true?”,“False?”
"Dois dias depois o barbeiro era recolhido à Casa Verde. — Preso por ter cão, preso por não ter cão! exclamou o infeliz.","Two days later the barber was taken to Casa Verde. ""Arrested for having a dog, arrested for not having a dog!"" exclaimed the unfortunate.","Two days later the barber was locked up in the Green House. “You’re damned if you do and you’re damned if you don’t,” observed the new patient.","Two days later, the barber was back in the Casa Verde, muttering that he just couldn’t win. At the end of a year, the council authorized an additional six-month trial period to allow adequate testing of the alienist’s new therapies."

"Crispim Soares derretia-se todo. Esse interrogar da gente inquieta e curiosa, dos amigos atônitos, era para ele uma consagração pública. Não havia duvidar; toda a povoação sabia enfim que o privado do alienista era ele, Crispim, o boticário, o colaborador do grande homem e das grandes coisas; daí a corrida à botica. Tudo isso dizia o carão jucundo e o riso discreto do boticário, o riso e o silêncio, porque ele não respondia nada; um, dois, três monossílabos, quando muito, soltos, secos, encapados no fiel sorriso, constante e miúdo, cheio de mistérios científicos, que ele não podia, sem desdouro nem perigo, desvendar a nenhuma pessoa humana.","Crispim Soares melted all over. This questioning of the restless and curious people, of the astonished friends, was for him a public consecration. There was no doubt; the entire town finally knew that the alienist's private person was he, Crispim, the apothecary, the collaborator of the great man and great things; hence the rush to the apothecary. All this said, the jucundo face and the apothecary's discreet laugh, the laughter and the silence, because he didn't answer anything; one, two, three monosyllables, at most, loose, dry, covered in a faithful smile, constant and small, full of scientific mysteries, which he could not, without disdain or danger, reveal to any human person.","Crispim Soares was delighted. This questioning by his puzzled friends, and by the uneasy and curious in general, amounted to public recognition of his importance. There was no doubt about it, the entire population knew that he, Crispim the druggist, was the alienist’s confidant, the great man’s collaborator. That is why they all came running to the pharmacy. All this could be read in the druggist’s jocund expression and discreet smile—and in his silence, for he made no reply. One, two, perhaps three dry monosyllables at the most, cloaked in a loyal, constant half-smile and full of scientific mysteries which he could reveal to no human being without danger and dishonor.","Crispim Soares melted with contentment. The rush of people to his shop and the curiosity of all his acquaintances amounted to a public tribute, a recognition that he, Crispim the apothecary, was the confidant and collaborator of the great man. The apothecary’s glowing countenance and discreet smile said it all, his smile and his silence, because he hardly opened his mouth. At most he uttered a few oracular monosyllables that possessed nothing of the eloquence of that ever-present little half-smile, so suggestive of scientific mysteries that the apothecary could not reveal to any living person without danger or dishonor."
"— Não nos dispersaremos. Se quereis os nossos cadáveres, podeis tomá-los; mas só os cadáveres; não levareis a nossa honra, o nosso crédito, os nossos direitos, e com eles a salvação de Itaguaí.","“We will not disperse.

"Um desses limitou-se a pensá-lo, deu de ombros e foi embora. Tinha negócios pessoais. Acabava de construir uma casa suntuosa. Só a casa bastava para deter e chamar toda a gente; mas havia mais, — a mobília, que ele mandara vir da Hungria e da Holanda, segundo contava, e que se podia ver do lado de fora, porque as janelas viviam abertas, — e o jardim, que era uma obra-prima de arte e de gosto. Esse homem, que enriquecera no fabrico de albardas, tinha tido sempre o sonho de uma casa magnífica, jardim pomposo, mobília rara. Não deixou o negócio das albardas, mas repousava dele na contemplação da casa nova, a primeira de Itaguaí, mais grandiosa do que a Casa Verde, mais nobre do que a da câmara. Entre a gente ilustre da povoação havia choro e ranger de dentes, quando se pensava, ou se falava, ou se louvava a casa do albardeiro, — um simples albardeiro, Deus do céu!","One of those only thought about it, shrugged his shoulders and left. He had personal business. He had just built a sumptuous house. The house alone was enough to stop and call everyone; but there was more—the furniture, which he had ordered from Hungary and Holland, he said, and which could be seen from the outside because the windows were always open—and the garden, which was a masterpiece of art. and taste. This man, who had become rich in the manufacture of packsaddles, had always dreamed of a magnificent house, a pompous garden, rare furniture. He did not leave the business of saddlebags, but rested on it in contemplation of the new house, the first in Itaguaí, grander than the Casa Verde, more noble than the one in the town hall. Among the illustrious people of the village there was weeping and gnashing of teeth, when people thought, or spoke, or praised the house of the packsaddleman, — a simple packsaddleman, God in heaven!","But one of them merely shrugged his shoulders and went on his way. He had more important interests. He had just built a magnificent house, with a garden that was a masterpiece of art and taste. His furniture, imported from Hungary and Holland, was visible from the street, for the windows were always open. This man, who had become rich in the manufacture of packsaddles, had always dreamed of owning a sumptuous house, an elaborate garden, and rare furniture. Now he had acquired all these things and, in semi-retirement, was devoting most of his time to the enjoyment of them. His house was undoubtedly the finest in Itaguai, more grandiose than the Green House, nobler than the town hall. There was wailing and gnashing of teeth among Itaguai’s social elite whenever they heard it praised or even mentioned—indeed, when they even thought about it. Owned by a mere manufacturer of packsaddles, good God!","Mateus the outfitter, for one, had his suspicions, but he shrugged, said nothing, and went about his affairs. He had recently built a sumptuous residence. The house itself was enough to get people’s attention, but there was more: the fine furniture imported from Holland and Hungary (as he explained, and as people could see from outside, because he always had the windows open) and the magnificent garden, a masterpiece of artistry and good taste. Mateus lost himself in contemplation of his house. He had always dreamed of having it, and when he grew rich enough making the rough saddles used for pack animals such as mules and donkeys, he got what he wanted, the grandest residence in Itaguaí, more elegant than the town hall, grander, even, than the Casa Grande. The town’s most illustrious citizens were mortified at the very thought of the outfitter’s house. A mule outfitter, and such a house! Good heavens!"
"— Um caso destes é raro, disse ele à mulher pasmada. Agora esperemos o nosso Crispim.","""Such a case is rare,"" he said to the astonished woman. Now let's wait for our Crispin.","“This is a very unusual case,” said the doctor to Dona Evarista.

"E ninguém lhe respondia; todos repetiam que era um homem perfeitamente ajuizado. A mesma demanda que ele trazia com o barbeiro, acerca de uns chãos da vila, era filha da obscuridade de um alvará, e não da cobiça ou ódio. Um excelente caráter o Coelho. Os únicos desafeiçoados que tinha eram alguns sujeitos que, dizendo-se taciturnos, ou alegando andar com pressa, mal o viam de longe dobravam as esquinas, entravam nas lojas, etc. Na verdade, ele amava a boa palestra, a palestra comprida, gostada a sorvos largos, e assim é que nunca estava só, preferindo os que sabiam dizer duas palavras, mas não desdenhando os outros. O padre Lopes, que cultivava o Dante, e era inimigo do Coelho, nunca o via desligar-se de uma pessoa que não declamasse e emendasse este trecho:","And nobody answered him; everyone repeated that he was a perfectly sane man. The same demand that he brought with the barber, about some floors in the village, was the result of the obscurity of a charter, and not of greed or hatred. An excellent character the Rabbit. The only disaffected he had were some guys who, claiming to be taciturn, or claiming to be in a hurry, as soon as they saw him from afar, turned corners, went into stores, etc. In fact, he loved the good talk, the long talk, enjoyed in large sip, and so he was never alone, preferring those who knew how to say two words, but not disdaining the others. Father Lopes, who cultivated Dante, and was Coelho's enemy, never saw him leave a person who did not declaim and amend this passage:","And no one answered. Everybody said he was perfectly sane. The legal action against the barber, involving some real estate, grew not out of hatred or spite but out of the obscure wording of a deed. Coelho had an excellent reputation. A few individuals, to be sure, avoided him; as soon as they saw him approaching in the distance they ran around corners, ducked into stores. The fact is, he loved conversation—long conversation, drunk down in large draughts. Consequently he was almost never alone. He preferred those who also liked to talk, but he would compromise, if necessary, for a unilateral conversation with the more taciturn. Whenever Father Lopes, who disliked Coelho, saw him taking his leave of someone, he quoted Dante, with a minor change of his own:","And nobody answered him. Everybody considered Coelho perfectly sane. Coelho’s lawsuit against Porfírio, concerning a couple of vacant lots in town, derived from a confusion of obscurely worded property titles rather than from greed or rancor. A fine fellow, Coelho. The only people who didn’t like him were a couple of grumps (always in a hurry, according to them) who would duck into a shop or around a corner in order not to talk to Coelho when they saw him coming down the street. The truth is that Coelho did like to talk."

"O vigário Lopes, a quem ele confiou a nova teoria, declarou lisamente que não chegava a entendê-la, que era uma obra absurda, e, se não era absurda, era de tal modo colossal que não merecia princípio de execução.","Vicar Lopes, to whom he entrusted the new theory, flatly declared that he did not quite understand it, that it was an absurd work, and, if it was not absurd, it was so colossal that it did not deserve to begin its execution.","Father Lopes, to whom he also confided his theory, replied that he was not quite sure he understood it but that it sounded a little dangerous and, in any case, would involve more work than one doctor could possibly handle.","Father Lopes, another to whom the alienist confided the basic principles of his theory, declared flatly that he failed to understand it, or, rather, that he found it absurd, and if not absurd, then at least unrealistic, and he recommended against any attempt to implement it."

"Não acabou a frase; ou antes, acabou-a levantando os olhos ao teto, — os olhos, que eram a sua feição mais insinuante, — negros, grandes, lavados de uma luz úmida, como os da aurora. Quanto ao gesto, era o mesmo que empregara no dia em que Simão Bacamarte a pediu em casamento. Não dizem as crônicas se D. Evarista brandiu aquela arma com o perverso intuito de degolar de uma vez a ciência, ou, pelo menos, decepar-lhe as mãos; mas a conjetura é verossímil. Em todo caso, o alienista não lhe atribuiu outra intenção. E não se irritou o grande homem, não ficou sequer consternado. O metal de seus olhos não deixou de ser o mesmo metal, duro, liso, eterno, nem a menor prega veio quebrar a superfície da fronte quieta como a água de Botafogo. Talvez um sorriso lhe descerrou os lábios, por entre os quais filtrou esta palavra macia como o óleo do Cântico:10","The sentence is not over; or rather, she ended up raising her eyes to the ceiling — her eyes, which were her most insinuating feature — black, large, washed with a damp light, like those of dawn. As for the gesture, it was the same one she had used on the day that Simão Bacamarte asked her to marry him. The chronicles do not say whether D. Evarista brandished that weapon with the perverse intention of slaying science once and for all, or, at least, cutting off its hands; but the conjecture is credible. In any case, the alienist did not attribute any other intention to him. And the great man was not angered, he was not even dismayed. The metal of his eyes did not stop being the same metal, hard, smooth, eternal, not even the slightest crease broke the surface of his forehead, as quiet as the water in Botafogo. Perhaps a smile opened his lips, through which he filtered this word, soft as the oil of the Canticle:10","She did not complete the sentence. Or, rather, she completed it by raising her eyes to the ceiling. Dona Evarista’s eyes were her most attractive feature—large, black, and bathed in a vaporous light like the dawn. She had used them in much the same way when trying to get Simão Bacamarte to propose. Now she was brandishing her weapon again, this time for the apparent purpose of cutting science’s throat. But the alienist was not perturbed. His eyes remained steady, calm, enduring. No wrinkle disturbed his brow, as serene as the waters of Botafogo Bay. Perhaps a slight smile played on his lips as he said:","She did not finish the sentence, or, rather, finished it by raising aloft her eyes—those eyes that were her finest feature, large, dark, moist, and insinuating as the pale light of dawn. It was the same gesture that she had employed years ago to induce a proposal of marriage from Simão Bacamarte. The chronicles of Itaguaí do not record her motives on this occasion, but we may reasonably conjecture that she desired nothing less than to truncate the progress of Science. In any case, the alienist supposed exactly that and nothing less. The great man betrayed no agitation whatsoever. His gaze remained steely and serene, almost eternal, and not the slightest wrinkle crossed his brow, as untroubled as the waters of Botafogo Bay, but perhaps his lips did curl in a faint smile as he whispered:"
— O que é que me está dizendo? perguntou o alienista quando um agente secreto lhe contou a conversação do barbeiro com os principais da vila.,'What are you telling me?' asked the alienist when a secret agent told him about the barber's conversation with the village leaders.,The alienist listened with immense interest when one of his secret agents told him what Porfírio had said.,“He said what?” exclaimed the alienist when his spies informed him of the secret conversation.
— Morra o alienista! bradavam as vozes mais perto.,— Die the alienist! shouted the voices closer.,"“Death to the alienist!” shouted the voices, now closer than before.",“Death to the alienist!” shouted the approaching voices.
"— A questão é científica, dizia ele; trata-se de uma doutrina nova, cujo primeiro exemplo sou eu. Reúno em mim mesmo a teoria e a prática.","— The question is scientific, he said; it is a new doctrine, the first example of which is me. I bring together theory and practice in myself.","“This is a matter of science, of a new doctrine,” he said, “and I am the first instance of its application. I embody both theory and practice.”","“This is a scientific question,” he affirmed. “A new approach to alienism in which I embody both theory and practice.”"
"Dizia isto, passeando ao longo da vasta sala, onde fulgurava a mais rica biblioteca dos domínios ultramarinos de Sua Majestade. Um amplo chambre de damasco, preso à cintura por um cordão de seda, com borlas de ouro (presente de uma Universidade) envolvia o corpo majestoso e austero do ilustre alienista. A cabeleira cobria-lhe uma extensa e nobre calva adquirida nas cogitações quotidianas da ciência. Os pés, não delgados e femininos, não graúdos e mariolas, mas proporcionados ao vulto, eram resguardados por um par de sapatos cujas fivelas não passavam de simples e modesto latão. Vede a diferença: — só se lhe notava luxo naquilo que era de origem científica; o que propriamente vinha dele trazia a cor da moderação e da singeleza, virtudes tão ajustadas à pessoa de um sábio.","He said this, strolling along the vast room, where the richest library in His Majesty's overseas domains shone. A wide damask dressing gown, fastened to the waist by a silk cord, with gold tassels (a gift from a University) enveloped the majestic and austere body of the illustrious alienist. His hair covered an extensive and noble bald spot acquired in the everyday thoughts of science. The feet, not slender and feminine, not big and small, but proportionate to the figure, were protected by a pair of shoes whose buckles were nothing more than simple and modest brass. See the difference: — luxury was only noticed in what was of scientific origin; what properly came from him bore the color of moderation and simplicity, virtues so suited to the person of a sage.","He paced the length of the immense room, past bookcase after bookcase—the largest library in His Majesty’s overseas possessions. A gold-embroidered, damask dressing-gown (a gift from a university) enveloped the regal and austere body of the illustrious physician. The extensive top of his head, which the incessant cogitations of the scientist had rendered bald, was covered by a wig. His feet, neither dainty nor gross but perfectly proportioned to his body, were encased in a pair of ordinary shoes with plain brass buckles. Note the distinction: only those elements that bore some relationship to his work as a scientist were in any sense luxurious; the rest was simple and tem- perate.","Such were his thoughts as he paced back and forth in his vast library, the largest in all His Majesty’s overseas dominions. A damask robe tied at the waist with a silken cord embroidered with gold (the gift of a European university) enveloped his body. A powdered wig covered his head, grown bald from years of scientific cogitation. His feet, neither too delicate nor too large, precisely proportioned to the rest of his body, were encased by a pair of buckled shoes—their buckles neither of gold nor of silver, but rather, of simple, modest brass. Observe the contrast. His only luxuries were those of academic origin. All else was simple and unassuming, exactly as befits a truly wise man."
"Agora, se imaginais que o alienista ficou radiante ao ver sair o último hóspede da Casa Verde, mostrais com isso que ainda não conheceis o nosso homem. Plus ultra! era a sua divisa. Não lhe bastava ter descoberto a teoria verdadeira da loucura; não o contentava ter estabelecido em Itaguaí o reinado da razão. Plus ultra! Não ficou alegre, ficou preocupado, cogitativo; alguma coisa lhe dizia que a teoria nova tinha, em si mesma, outra e novíssima teoria.","Now, if you imagine that the alienist was overjoyed to see the last guest leave the Casa Verde, you show that you still don't know our man. Plus ultra! it was their motto. It was not enough for him to have discovered the true theory of madness; he was not content to have established the reign of reason in Itaguaí. Plus ultra! He wasn't happy, he was worried, cogitative; something told him that the new theory had, in itself, another and very new theory.","If you think the alienist was radiant with happiness on seeing the last guest leave the Green House, you apparently do not yet understand the man. Plus ultra was his motto. For him the discovery of the true theory of mental illness was not enough, nor was the establishment in Itaguai of the reign of reason with the total elimination of psychological abnormality. Plus ultra! Something told him that his new theory bore within itself a better, newer theory.","Now if you imagine that the alienist was thrilled to discharge the last of his patients, you still do not know our man. His motto was Ever Onward! For him, it was not enough to have discovered the true theory of mental illness, not sufficient to have restored the reign of Reason to Itaguaí. Ever Onward! Rather than elated, he was troubled and pensive. Something told him that beyond his new theory lay another, even newer theory."
"O alienista mal podia dissimular o assombro; confessou que esperava outra coisa, o arrasamento do hospício, a prisão dele, o desterro, tudo, menos…","The alienist could barely conceal his astonishment; confessed that he expected something else, the razing of the asylum, his arrest, exile, everything but…",The alienist could not conceal his amazement. He confessed that he had expected not only destruction of the Green House but also his own arrest and banishment. The last thing in the world he would have expected was—,"The alienist could hardly conceal his astonishment. He confessed that he had expected something quite different—the demolition of the asylum, his own arrest or banishment, anything but—"
"— Não digo que não, respondia-lhe o alienista; mas a verdade é o que Vossa Reverendíssima está vendo. Isto é todos os dias.","—I don't say no, answered the alienist; but the truth is what Your Most Reverend is seeing. This is every day.","“Quite so,” replied the alienist. “But Your Reverence has observed for himself. This happens every day.”","“Incredible, no doubt,” said the alienist, “but undeniably real. We see such things every day.”"
"Daí a nada o barbeiro, acompanhado de alguns de seus tenentes, entrava na sala da vereança e intimava à câmara a sua queda. A câmara não resistiu, entregou-se, e foi dali para a cadeia. Então os amigos do barbeiro propuseram-lhe que assumisse o governo da vila, em nome de Sua Majestade. Porfírio aceitou o encargo, embora não desconhecesse (acrescentou) os espinhos que trazia; disse mais que não podia dispensar o concurso dos amigos presentes; ao que eles prontamente anuíram. O barbeiro veio à janela, e comunicou ao povo essas resoluções, que o povo ratificou, aclamando o barbeiro. Este tomou a denominação de — “Protetor da vila em nome de Sua Majestade e do povo”. — Expediram-se logo várias ordens importantes, comunicações oficiais do novo governo, uma exposição minuciosa ao vice-rei, com muitos protestos de obediência às ordens de Sua Majestade; finalmente, uma proclamação ao povo, curta, mas enérgica:","Soon the barber, accompanied by some of his lieutenants, entered the council's room and summoned the council to his downfall. The camera did not resist, surrendered, and went from there to jail. Then the barber's friends proposed that he take over the government of the village, in His Majesty's name. Porphyry accepted the task, although he was not unaware (he added) of the thorns he brought; he said further that he could not dispense with the contest of the friends present; to which they readily acquiesced. The barber came to the window, and communicated these resolutions to the people, which the people ratified, acclaiming the barber. This took the name of — “Protector of the village in the name of His Majesty and the people”. — Several important orders were immediately issued, official communications from the new government, a detailed exposition to the Viceroy, with many protests of obedience to His Majesty's orders; finally, a proclamation to the people, short but forceful:","A few seconds later the barber and some of his lieutenants entered the chamber and told the Town Council that it had been deposed. The Councilmen surrendered and were put in jail. Then the barber’s friends urged him to assume the dictatorship of Itaguai in the name of His Majesty. Porfírio accepted this responsibility, although, as he told them, he was fully aware of its weight and of the thorny problems it entailed. He said also that he would be unable to rule without their coöperation, which they promptly promised him. The barber then went to the window and told the people what had happened; they shouted their approval. He chose the title, “Town Protector in the Name of His Majesty and of the People.” He immediately issued several important orders, official communications from the new government, a detailed statement to the Viceroy with many protestations of obedience to His Majesty, and finally the following short but forceful proclamation to the people:","The barber then entered the town hall accompanied by his chief lieutenants and arrested the council. The erstwhile councilmen did not resist and allowed themselves to be taken to jail. At that point, the barber’s associates proposed that he take charge of the municipal government in the name of His Majesty. Porfírio accepted that responsibility, although he was well aware (he added) of the thorny difficulties it entailed. He would need the support of his friends (he added further), and they assured him of it. The barber went to the window and communicated these resolutions to the crowd, who did not hesitate to ratify them and acclaim the barber “Protector of Itaguaí in the name of His Majesty and the People.” The protector then issued various important documents officially announcing the formation of the new government and providing the viceroy with a detailed report of recent events (including repeated protestations of loyalty and obedience to His Majesty). He also penned the following brief but forceful proclamation:"
— Sim?,- Yes?,“Really?”,“Is that so?”
"— Isso, não! isso não! interrompeu a boa senhora com energia. Se ele gastou tão depressa o que recebeu, a culpa não é dele.","- Not that! not that! interrupted the good lady energetically. If he spent so quickly what he received, it's not his fault.",“No! Now there you are wrong!” interrupted the good woman energetically. “He was not to blame for what he did.”,"“No, no, you are wrong!” interrupted the good woman. “It’s not his fault that he spent his inheritance so quickly.”"
"D. Evarista ficou aterrada, foi ter com o marido, disse-lhe “que estava com desejos”, um principalmente, o de vir ao Rio de Janeiro e comer tudo o que a ele lhe parecesse adequado a certo fim. Mas aquele grande homem, com a rara sagacidade que o distinguia, penetrou a intenção da esposa e redarguiu-lhe sorrindo que não tivesse medo. Dali foi à câmara, onde os vereadores debatiam a proposta, e defendeu-a com tanta eloquência, que a maioria resolveu autorizá-lo ao que pedira, votando ao mesmo tempo um imposto destinado a subsidiar o tratamento, alojamento e mantimento dos doidos pobres. A matéria do imposto não foi fácil achá-la; tudo estava tributado em Itaguaí. Depois de longos estudos, assentou-se em permitir o uso de dois penachos nos cavalos dos enterros. Quem quisesse emplumar os cavalos de um coche mortuário pagaria dois tostões à câmara, repetindo-se tantas vezes esta quantia quantas fossem as horas decorridas entre a do falecimento e a da última bênção na sepultura. O escrivão perdeu-se nos cálculos aritméticos do rendimento possível da nova taxa; e um dos vereadores, que não acreditava na empresa do médico, pediu que se relevasse o escrivão de um trabalho inútil.","D. Evarista was terrified, went to her husband, told him “that she had desires”, one mainly, to come to Rio de Janeiro and eat whatever he thought was adequate for a certain purpose. But that great man, with the rare sagacity that distinguished him, penetrated his wife's intention and replied smiling to her that she was not afraid. From there he went to the chamber, where the councilors were debating the proposal, and defended it so eloquently that the majority decided to authorize him to do what he had asked for, at the same time voting on a tax to subsidize the treatment, housing and maintenance of the insane. The tax subject was not easy to find; everything was taxed in Itaguaí. After long studies, he settled on allowing the use of two plumes on burial horses. Whoever wanted to feather the horses of a mortuary coach would pay two pennies to the chamber, repeating this amount as many times as there were hours that elapsed between the death and the last blessing at the grave. The clerk lost himself in arithmetical calculations of the possible return on the new rate; and one of the councilors, who did not believe in the doctor's company, asked that the clerk of a useless work be released.","Dona Evarista was terrified. She went to her husband and said that she had a consuming desire to take a trip with him to Rio de Janeiro. There, she said, she would eat whatever he thought necessary for the attainment of a certain objective. But the astute doctor immediately perceived what was on his wife’s mind and replied that she need have no fear. He then went to the town hall, where the Council was debating his proposal, which he supported with such eloquence that it was approved without amendment on the first ballot. The Council also adopted a tax designed to pay for the lodging, sustenance, and treatment of the indigent mad. This involved a bit of a problem, for everything in Itaguai was already being taxed. After considerable study the Council authorized the use of two plumes on the horses drawing a funeral coach. Anyone wishing to take advantage of this privilege would pay a tax of a stated amount for each hour from the time of death to the termination of the rites at the grave. The town clerk was asked to determine the probable revenue from the new tax, but he got lost in arithmetical calculations, and one of the Councilmen, who was opposed to the doctor’s undertaking, suggested that the clerk be relieved of a useless task.","It makes people loony.” Terrified, the illustrious Dona Evarista went straight to tell her husband that she had conceived a strong desire to travel to Rio de Janeiro, where she promised to eat everything that he recommended for her special diet. But the great man, with typical sagacity, recognized his wife’s intentions and merely replied, smiling, that she had nothing to fear. He went from there to the town hall, where the council was debating his proposal, and so eloquently did he defend it that the majority authorized the project and also voted for a tax to pay for the treatment, room, and board of the indigent lunatics. It was difficult to find anything to put a tax on, however, because everything in Itaguaí had been taxed already. After extensive study, the council decided to allow, for a fee, two plumes on the heads of horses used in funerals. Anyone wanting to befeather his horse-drawn hearse would have to pay for the privilege, at an hourly rate to be charged from the time of death to the moment of the final blessing over the tomb. As the council scribe lost himself in arithmetic calculations of the revenues hypothetically to result from the new tax, a councilman who did not believe in the doctor’s project suggested that the scribe be excused such a useless task."
"Vinte e quatro horas depois dos sucessos narrados no capítulo anterior, o barbeiro saiu do palácio do governo, — foi a denominação dada à casa da câmara, — com dois ajudantes de ordens, e dirigiu-se à residência de Simão Bacamarte. Não ignorava ele que era mais decoroso ao governo mandá-lo chamar; o receio, porém, de que o alienista não obedecesse, obrigou-o a parecer tolerante e moderado.","Twenty-four hours after the events narrated in the previous chapter, the barber left the government palace, — as was the name given to the town hall, — with two assistants, and went to the residence of Simão Bacamarte. He was not unaware that it was more decorous for the government to send for him; the fear, however, that the alienist would not obey, forced him to appear tolerant and moderate.","The next day Porfírio and two of his aides-de-camp left the government palace (the new name of the town hall) and set out for the residence of Simão Bacamarte. The barber knew that it would have been more fitting for him to have ordered Bacamarte to come to the palace, but he was afaid the alienist would refuse","The next morning, the barber, accompanied by two uniformed assistants, strode up the main street of Itaguaí in the direction of Simão Bacamarte’s residence. He knew that it would be more dignified and fitting to summon the alienist to the Palace of Government (as he had renamed the town hall), but he feared that his summons would be ignored, and so he chose to go to the alienist, instead. That way he would avoid embarrassment and also appear magnanimous."

Quel seccatore…21,Quel seccatore…21,[2],"Father Lopes, one of Coelho’s few enemies, liked to insult him slyly using quotations from Dante, which he thought a harmless amusement, given that neither Coelho nor anyone else in Itaguaí (except, of course, the alienist) could understand him."
"— Sempre haverá tempo de a dar à matraca, concluiu ele.","— There will always be time to give it to the rattle, he concluded.","“There’ll be plenty of time for the noisemaker afterwards,” he concluded.","“There will always be time later for the noisemaker,” he concluded."
— Viva o ilustre Porfírio! bradaram umas trinta pessoas que aguardavam o barbeiro à porta.,— Long live the illustrious Porphyry! shouted about thirty people who were waiting for the barber at the door.,“Long live our glorious Protector!” shouted thirty-odd people who had been awaiting the barber in front of the house.,“Long live the illustrious Porfírio!” cheered thirty-or-so people who had been waiting to acclaim the barber when he emerged from the alienist’s house.
"Era a vez da terapêutica. Simão Bacamarte, ativo e sagaz em descobrir enfermos, excedeu-se ainda na diligência e penetração com que principiou a tratá-los. Neste ponto todos os cronistas estão de pleno acordo: o ilustre alienista fez curas pasmosas, que excitaram a mais viva admiração em Itaguaí.","It was time for therapy. Simão Bacamarte, active and sagacious in discovering the sick, still exceeded himself in the diligence and penetration with which he began to treat them. On this point all the chroniclers are in complete agreement: the illustrious alienist performed amazing cures, which excited the most lively admiration in Itaguaí.","However diligent and perceptive he may have been in the discovery of madmen, Simão Bacamarte outdid himself when he undertook to cure them. All the chroniclers agree that he brought about the most amazing recoveries.","After diagnosis comes therapy. Simão Bacamarte, so tireless and perspicacious in diagnosing all forms of dementia, excelled even more in the delicate science of treatment. All of the old chronicles concur completely on this point: the illustrious alienist accomplished truly prodigious cures, exciting astonishment and enthusiasm in Itaguaí."

"Mas um dardo atravessou o coração de D. Evarista. Conteve-se, entretanto; limitou-se a dizer ao marido, que, se ele não ia, ela não iria também, porque não havia de meter-se sozinha pelas estradas.","But a dart pierced Dona Evarista's heart. He held back, however; she just told her husband that if he wasn't going, she wouldn't go either, because she wouldn't have to go alone on the roads.","A sudden misgiving pierced Dona Evarista’s heart. She concealed her anxiety, however, and merely told her husband that, if he did not go, neither would she, for of course she could not travel alone.","Dona Evarista had a sudden apprehension. If he didn’t go to Rio, she told him, well, she wouldn’t go either, because she couldn’t very well travel the highways by herself."
"Três meses depois efetuava-se a jornada. D. Evarista, a tia, a mulher do boticário, um sobrinho deste, um padre que o alienista conhecera em Lisboa, e que de aventura achava-se em Itaguaí, cinco ou seis pajens, quatro mucamas, tal foi a comitiva que a população viu dali sair em certa manhã do mês de maio. As despedidas foram tristes para todos, menos para o alienista. Conquanto as lágrimas de D. Evarista fossem abundantes e sinceras, não chegaram a abalá-lo. Homem de ciência, e só de ciência, nada o consternava fora da ciência; e se alguma coisa o preocupava naquela ocasião, se ele deixava correr pela multidão um olhar inquieto e policial, não era outra coisa mais do que a ideia de que algum demente podia achar-se ali misturado com a gente de juízo.","Three months later, the journey took place. D. Evarista, his aunt, the apothecary's wife, his nephew, a priest that the alienist had met in Lisbon, and who, by chance, was in Itaguaí, five or six pages, four maids, such was the entourage that the population saw him leave there one morning in May. The goodbyes were sad for everyone, except for the alienist. Although Dona Evarista's tears were abundant and sincere, they did not shake him. A man of science, and science alone, nothing dismayed him outside of science; and if anything worried him on that occasion, if he let a restless, police look through the crowd, it was nothing more than the idea that some insane person might be there mixed with the sensible people.","Three months later she left for Rio in the company of her aunt, the druggist’s wife, one of the druggist’s cousins, a priest whom Bacamarte had known in Lisbon and who happened to be in Itaguai, four maidservants, and five or six male attendants. A small crowd had come to see them off. The farewells were sad for everyone but the alienist, for he was troubled by nothing outside the realm of science. Even Dona Evarista’s tears, sincere and abundant as they were, did not affect him. If anything concerned him on that occasion, if he cast a restless and police-like eye over the crowd, it was only because he suspected the presence of one or two candidates for commitment to the Green House.","Three months later, on a May morning, a small crowd bid Dona Evarista farewell as she left for Rio accompanied by her aunt, by the wife and a third nephew of the apothecary, by a clergyman whom the alienist had befriended in Lisbon and who just happened to be in Itaguaí, and by nine or ten slaves, including male attendants and maidservants. The farewells were heartbreaking for everyone except the alienist. Dona Evarista’s tears, although abundant and sincere, did not move the man of science. His only concern, as he calmly inspected the crowd that had gathered around the travelers, was to discern the presence of any demented countenances among the faces of the sane."
"A revolução triunfante não perdeu um só minuto; recolheu os feridos às casas próximas, e guiou para a câmara. Povo e tropa fraternizavam, davam vivas a el-rei, ao vice-rei, a Itaguaí, ao “ilustre Porfírio”. Este ia na frente, empunhando tão destramente a espada, como se ela fosse apenas uma navalha um pouco mais comprida. A vitória cingia-lhe a fronte de um nimbo misterioso. A dignidade de governo começava a enrijar-lhe os quadris.","The triumphant revolution did not waste a single minute; collected the wounded to the nearby houses, and guided them to the chamber. People and troops fraternized, cheered the King, the Viceroy, Itaguaí, the “illustrious Porfírio”. He led the way, wielding his sword so deftly, as if it were just a slightly longer razor. Victory girded his forehead with a mysterious nimbus. The dignity of government was beginning to stiffen his hips.","The triumphant rebels did not lose an instant. They carried the wounded into the nearest houses and headed for the town hall. The people and the troops fraternized. They shouted vivas for the King, the Viceroy, Itaguai, and “our great leader, Porfírio.” The barber marched at their head, wielding the sword as dexterously as if it had been merely an unusually long razor. Victory hovered like a halo above him, and the dignity of government informed his every movement.","The triumphant rebellion lost no time. After attending to the wounded, it made for the town hall. Dragoons and rebels fraternized with each other and with the cheering crowd, shouting vivas for the king and his viceroy, for Itaguaí and their illustrious leader, who walked at the head of the multitude waving the surrendered sword as nimbly as one of his straight razors. Victory wreathed the barber’s brow with a mysterious aura, and the dignity of office had begun to stiffen his thighs."
"A notícia deste ato tão nobre, tão puro, suspendeu um pouco a alma dos rebeldes. Seguramente o alienista podia estar em erro, mas nenhum interesse alheio à ciência o instigava; e para demonstrar o erro era preciso alguma coisa mais do que arruaças e clamores. Isto disse o presidente, com aplauso de toda a câmara. O barbeiro, depois de alguns instantes de concentração, declarou que estava investido de um mandato público, e não restituiria a paz a Itaguaí antes de ver por terra a Casa Verde, — “essa Bastilha da razão humana”,22 — expressão que ouvira a um poeta local, e que ele repetiu com muita ênfase. Disse, e a um sinal todos saíram com ele.","The news of this act so noble, so pure, lifted the rebels' souls a little. Surely the alienist could be in error, but no interest alien to science was urging him on; and to demonstrate the error something more was needed than riots and clamor. This said the president, with applause from the entire chamber. The barber, after a few moments of concentration, declared that he was invested with a public mandate, and would not restore peace to Itaguaí before seeing Casa Verde on the ground, — “that Bastille of human reason”,22 — an expression that he had heard the a local poet, and which he repeated with great emphasis. He said, and at a signal they all left with him.","In view of this noble act of self-denial, how could the rebels persist in their attitude? The alienist might, indeed, make mistakes, but obviously he was not motivated by any interest alien to science; and to establish error on his part, something more would be needed than disorderly crowds in the street. So spoke the President, and the entire Council applauded. The barber meditated for a few moments and then declared that he was invested with a public mandate; he would give Itaguai no peace until the final destruction of the Green House, “that Bastille of human reason”—an expression he had heard a local poet use and which he now repeated with great vigor. Having spoken, he gave his cohorts a signal and led them out.","News of an action so pure, so noble, softened the rebels’ hearts. Surely he had committed errors, but the alienist’s motives were wholly scientific, after all. And an uproar did not help to clarify the errors, whatever they might be. So spoke the president of the town council, to the applause of its assembled members. After a moment’s reflection, the barber declared that he had a public mandate and would not rest until destroying the Casa Verde, “that Bastille of human reason,” in the phrase of a local poet that he repeated with great emphasis. At that, he exited the town hall with all his followers."
"— É falso, interrompeu o presidente.","""It's false,"" interrupted the president.","“That’s not true,” interrupted the President.",“False!” interrupted the mayor.
"— Lá está ele embasbacado, diziam os transeuntes, de manhã.","—There he is, gawking, said passers-by in the morning.","“There he is, staring at his own house,” the passers-by would say.","“He never gets tired of looking at it,” said passersby in the morning."
"— … porque eu velo, podeis estar certos disso, eu velo pela execução das vontades do povo. Confiai em mim; e tudo se fará pela melhor maneira. Só vos recomendo ordem. A ordem, meus amigos, é a base do governo…","—… because I watch, you can be sure of that, I watch for the execution of the will of the people. Trust me; and everything will be done in the best way. I only recommend you order. Order, my friends, is the basis of government...","“. . . for my main concern, day and night, is to execute faithfully the will of the people. Trust in me and you will not be disappointed. I ask of you only one thing: be peaceful, maintain order. For order, my friends, is the foundation on which government must rest.”","“ … because the People’s will is my command. You may rest assured of that! All I ask of you is order and obedience, the most fundamental prerequisite of good government.”"
"A mania das grandezas tinha exemplares notáveis. O mais notável era um pobre-diabo, filho de um algibebe, que narrava às paredes (porque não olhava nunca para nenhuma pessoa) toda a sua genealogia, que era esta:","The mania for grandeur had notable examples. The most notable was a poor devil, the son of an algibebe, who narrated to the walls (because he never looked at anyone) his entire genealogy, which was this:","There were some noteworthy cases of megalomania. One patient, the son of a cheap tailor, invented a genealogy in which he traced his ancestry back to members of royalty and, through them, ultimately to Jehovah.","There were noteworthy examples of megalomania, as well. One measly clerk thought he was the Grand Vizier. A poor countryman of Minas Gerais imagined himself the owner of vast herds of cattle, and he went around giving them away, three hundred to you, five hundred to me, and so on and on. Then there was an attorney-at-law who, astonishingly, kept his mouth shut, convinced that his eloquence was such that a single word from him would cause the sun to explode. At least, that is what he wrote with a pencil and paper that the alienist supplied him, less out of kindness than from scientific curiosity. I prefer not to speak of the many religious megalomaniacs. One fellow thought he was God himself. Most remarkable of all, however, was a poor tailor’s son who spent the day reciting (to nobody in particular) his illustrious genealogy, as follows:"
"Nisto entrou na vila uma força mandada pelo vice-rei, e restabeleceu a ordem. O alienista exigiu desde logo a entrega do barbeiro Porfírio, e bem assim a de uns cinquenta e tantos indivíduos, que declarou mentecaptos; e não só lhe deram esses, como afiançaram entregar-lhe mais dezenove sequazes do barbeiro, que convalesciam das feridas apanhadas na primeira rebelião.","At this, a force sent by the viceroy entered the village, and order was restored. The alienist immediately demanded the delivery of the barber Porfirio, as well as that of some fifty-odd individuals, who declared that he was a fool; and not only did they give him these, but they guaranteed to deliver him another nineteen henchmen of the barber, who were convalescing from the wounds taken in the first rebellion.","The new dictator barely had time to dispatch the documents when a military force sent by the Viceroy entered the town and restored order. At the alienist’s request, the troops immediately handed over to him Porfírio and some fifty other persons, and promised to deliver seventeen more of the barber’s followers as soon as they had sufficiently recovered from their wounds.","At that point a military force sent by the viceroy marched into Itaguaí and restored order. The alienist naturally demanded that they turn over to him the barber Porfírio, which they did, along with fifty-or-so individuals whose cerebral insufficiency destined them for the Casa Verde. Furthermore, the restored government promised to turn over nineteen others who had yet to recover fully from wounds received during the Pork Chop Revolution."

Who ever heard of putting a lot of crazy people in the same house?”"
"Este ponto da crise de Itaguaí marca também o grau máximo da influência de Simão Bacamarte. Tudo quanto quis, deu-se-lhe; e uma das mais vivas provas do poder do ilustre médico achamo-la na prontidão com que os vereadores, restituídos a seus lugares, consentiram em que Sebastião Freitas também fosse recolhido ao hospício. O alienista, sabendo da extraordinária inconsistência das opiniões desse vereador, entendeu que era um caso patológico, e pediu-o. A mesma coisa aconteceu ao boticário. O alienista, desde que lhe falaram da momentânea adesão de Crispim Soares à rebelião dos Canjicas, comparou-a à aprovação que sempre recebera dele, ainda na véspera, e mandou capturá-lo. Crispim Soares não negou o fato, mas explicou-o dizendo que cedera a um movimento de terror, ao ver a rebelião triunfante, e deu como prova a ausência de nenhum outro ato seu, acrescentando que voltara logo à cama, doente. Simão Bacamarte não o contrariou; disse, porém, aos circunstantes que o terror também é pai da loucura, e que o caso de Crispim Soares lhe parecia dos mais caracterizados.","This point in the Itaguaí crisis also marks the maximum degree of influence of Simão Bacamarte. Everything he wanted was given him; and one of the most vivid proofs of the power of the illustrious doctor we find it in the readiness with which the councilors, restored to their seats, consented that Sebastião Freitas also be taken to the asylum. The alienist, aware of the extraordinary inconsistency of this councilman's opinions, understood that it was a pathological case, and asked for it. The same thing happened to the apothecary. The alienist, ever since he was told about Crispim Soares' momentary adhesion to the Canjicas rebellion, compared it to the approval he had always received from him, even the day before, and had him captured. Crispim Soares did not deny the fact, but explained it by saying that he had given in to a movement of terror, when he saw the triumphant rebellion, and he gave proof of the absence of any other act of his, adding that he had immediately returned to bed, sick. Simão Bacamarte did not contradict him; he said, however, to the bystanders that terror is also the father of madness, and that the case of Crispim Soares seemed to him to be one of the most characteristic.","This period in the crisis of Itaguai represents the culmination of Simão Bacamarte’s influence. He got whatever he wanted. For example, the Town Council, now reëstablished, promptly consented to have Sebastião Freitas committed to the asylum. The alienist had requested this in view of the extraordinary inconsistency of the Councilman’s opinions, which Bacamarte considered a clear sign of mental illness. Subsequently the same thing happened to Crispim Soares. When the alienist learned that his close friend and staunch supporter had suddenly gone over to the side of the Stewed Corners, he ordered him to be seized and taken to the Green House. The druggist did not deny his switch of allegiance but explained that he had been motivated by an overwhelming fear of the new government. Simão Bacamarte accepted the explanation as true; he pointed out, however, that fear is a common symptom of mental abnormality.","The influence of Simão Bacamarte had now reached its zenith. He had only to ask, and he got anything and everything that he wanted. We can take the measure of his influence in the promptness with which the restored town council agreed to let councilman Sebastião Freitas be taken to the Casa Verde. Aware of the extraordinary inconsistency of the councilman’s opinions, the alienist pronounced his case pathological and asked that he be committed. The same thing happened with the apothecary. When the alienist heard about Crispim’s momentary embrace of the Pork Chop Revolution, he compared that to the approval he had always gotten from the apothecary, even the day before, and had him brought in. Crispim Soares did not deny the facts, but he attempted to explain them by claiming he was terrified and had done nothing else to support the revolution because he had been in bed, sick. Simão Bacamarte did not contradict him. He simply remarked to the others present that the case of Crispim Soares provided a remarkable illustration of how terror can, and often does, precipitate madness."
"D. Evarista era a esperança de Itaguaí; contava-se com ela para minorar o flagelo da Casa Verde. Daí as aclamações públicas, a imensa gente que atulhava as ruas, as flâmulas, as flores e damascos às janelas. Com o braço apoiado no do padre Lopes, — porque o eminente Bacamarte confiara a mulher ao vigário, e acompanhava-os a passo meditativo, — D. Evarista voltava a cabeça a um lado e outro, curiosa, inquieta, petulante. O vigário indagava do Rio de Janeiro, que ele não vira desde o vice-reinado anterior; e D. Evarista respondia, entusiasmada, que era a coisa mais bela que podia haver no mundo. O Passeio Público estava acabado, um paraíso, onde ela fora muitas vezes, e a rua das Belas Noites, o chafariz das Marrecas…17 Ah! o chafariz das Marrecas! Eram mesmo marrecas, — feitas de metal e despejando água pela boca fora. Uma coisa galantíssima. O vigário dizia que sim, que o Rio de Janeiro devia estar agora muito mais bonito. Se já o era noutro tempo! Não admira, maior do que Itaguaí, e de mais a mais sede do governo… Mas não se pode dizer que Itaguaí fosse feio; tinha belas casas, a casa do Mateus, a Casa Verde…","D. Evarista was Itaguaí's hope; it was counted on to alleviate the scourge of Casa Verde. Hence the public acclamations, the immense people who thronged the streets, the streamers, the flowers and apricots at the windows. With her arm resting on Father Lopes'—because the eminent Bacamarte had entrusted his wife to the vicar, and was accompanying them with a meditative step—D. Evarista turned her head from side to side, curious, restless, petulant. The vicar inquired of Rio de Janeiro, which he had not seen since the previous viceroyalty; and Dona Evarista responded enthusiastically that it was the most beautiful thing in the world. The Passeio Público was over, a paradise, where she had been many times, and the Rua das Belas Noites, the fountain in Marrecas…17 Ah! the fountain of the Marrecas! They were really teals—made of metal and pouring water out of their mouths. A most gallant thing. The vicar said yes, that Rio de Janeiro should be much more beautiful now. If it was already in another time! No wonder, bigger than Itaguaí, and more the seat of government… But you can't say that Itaguaí was ugly; there were beautiful houses, Mateus' house, Casa Verde...","The alienist’s wife was Itaguai’s great hope. Everyone counted on her to alleviate the scourge. Hence the public acclamation, the crowds in the streets, the pennants, and the flowers in the windows. The eminent Bacamarte, having entrusted her to the arm of Father Lopes, walked contemplatively with measured step. Dona Evarista, on the contrary, turned her head animatedly from side to side, observing with curiosity the unexpectedly warm reception. The priest asked about Rio de Janeiro, which he had not seen since the previous viceroyalty, and Dona Evarista replied that it was the most beautiful sight there could possibly be in the entire world. The Public Gardens, now completed, were a paradise in which she had often strolled—and the Street of Beautiful Nights, the Fountain of Ducks . . . Ah! the Fountain of Ducks. There really were ducks there, made of metal and spouting water through their mouths. A gorgeous thing. The priest said that Rio de Janeiro had been lovely even in his time there and must be much lovelier now. Small wonder, for it was so much larger than Itaguai and was, moreover, the capital. . . . But one could not call Itaguai ugly; it had some beautiful buildings, such as Mateus’s mansion, the Green House . . .","Dona Evarista was the great hope of Itaguaí. Everyone counted on her to save the town from the Casa Verde. Hence the public acclaim, the banners, the press of people in the street, the flowers and damask window dressings. Walking arm in arm with Father Lopes—because the eminent Bacamarte had confided his wife to the vicar and accompanied them a few steps away, lost in meditation—Dona Evarista swiveled her head from side to side, curious, stirred, swollen with pride. The vicar inquired about Rio de Janeiro, where he had not traveled since the reign of the previous viceroy, and Dona Evarista responded enthusiastically that Rio de Janeiro was the most beautiful thing that could possibly exist in the whole world. The Public Promenade and Gardens, a veritable paradise, had finally opened, and she had gone there several times, and the main streets were so impressive, and … oh, the Fountain of Ducks! Real ducks, made of metal, with water coming out of their mouths! Unbelievably lovely. The vicar said that, yes, Rio de Janeiro must be lovely now, indeed. It was already nice years ago. And no wonder, being much bigger than Itaguaí, after all, and home to the viceroy … not that Itaguaí could be called ugly, of course. It had fine buildings, like the mansion that Mateus built, and the Casa Verde …"
"— Não é patuscada, não, senhora; eles estão gritando: — Morra o Dr. Bacamarte! o tirano! dizia o moleque assustado.","— No, no, ma'am; they're screaming, ""Die Dr. Blunderbuss! the tyrant! said the frightened boy.","“They’re not a bunch of drunks, Dona Evarista,” said the child in fear. “They’re shouting: ‘Death to Dr. Bacamarte the tyrant.’”","“It’s no prank, no ma’am,” continued the boy, quite frightened. “They’re shouting, ‘Down with the tyrant Bacamarte!’”"
"Tal era o sistema. Imagina-se o resto. Cada beleza moral ou mental era atacada no ponto em que a perfeição parecia mais sólida; e o efeito era certo. Nem sempre era certo. Casos houve em que a qualidade predominante resistia a tudo; então, o alienista atacava outra parte, aplicando à terapêutica o método da estratégia militar, que toma uma fortaleza por um ponto, se por outro o não pode conseguir.","Such was the system. Imagine the rest. Every moral or mental beauty was attacked at the point where perfection seemed most solid; and the effect was right. It wasn't always right. There have been cases where the prevailing quality resisted everything; then, the alienist attacked another part, applying to therapy the method of military strategy, which takes a fortress on one point, if it cannot achieve it on the other.","said everybody upon seeing the healthy, prideful expression on the faces of the two ex-madmen. Bacamarte’s method was ultimately successful in every case, although in a few the patient’s dominant quality proved impregnable. In these cases the alienist won out by attacking at another point, like a good military strategist.","Such was the method. The rest may easily be imagined. The alienist assaulted the seeming moral or mental perfection of each sufferer at what appeared its strongest point, with unfailing results. Or rather, when the frontal assault failed, the alienist made a flanking attack, like a good military strategist, on some lesser virtue, and having breached the patient’s defenses he overwhelmed the primary virtue from behind."
"Crispim Soares entrou. A dor vencera a raiva, o boticário não arrancou as orelhas ao alienista. Este consolou o seu privado, assegurando-lhe que não era caso perdido; talvez a mulher tivesse alguma lesão cerebral; ia examiná-la com muita atenção; mas antes disso não podia deixá-la na rua. E parecendo-lhe vantajoso reuni-los, porque a astúcia e velhacaria do marido poderiam de certo modo curar a beleza moral que ele descobrira na esposa, disse Simão Bacamarte:","Crispim Soares entered. The pain had conquered the anger, the apothecary did not pluck the alienist's ears. The latter consoled his private, assuring him that he was not hopeless; perhaps the woman had some brain damage; he was going to examine it very carefully; but before that I couldn't leave her on the street. And it seemed to him to be advantageous to bring them together, because the cunning and trickery of the husband could, in a certain way, cure the moral beauty he had discovered in his wife, Simão Bacamarte said:","By the time Crispim Soares arrived at the alienist’s house, sorrow had overcome his anger. He did not tear Bacamarte’s ears off. The alienist tried to comfort his old friend. He told him that his wife might be suffering from a cerebral lesion, that there was a fair chance of recovery, and that meanwhile he must of course keep her confined. The alienist considered it desirable, however, for Soares to spend a good deal of time with her, for the druggist’s guile and intellectual dishonesty might help to overcome the moral superiority that the doctor found in his patient.","Crispim Soares quickly appeared. Grief had overcome rage; he did not box the alienist’s ears. The latter consoled his friend and confidant, assuring him that all was not lost. Crispim’s wife might have a mental disorder that had escaped detection so far. One could only hope. The alienist promised a thorough examination, but until then he could not release her in good conscience. On the other hand, considering that the husband’s cowardice and lack of integrity could be a therapeutic influence on his consort, Simão Bacamarte offered to let the apothecary eat and sleep with her in the Casa Verde."
"— Muito maior, acrescentou o outro.","""Much bigger,"" added the other.","“Far greater,” agreed the druggist.","“Much greater,” affirmed the apothecary."
"— Agradeço as suas palavras, retorquiu-lhe o alienista, e ainda me não arrependo de o haver restituído à liberdade.","—Thank you for your words, replied the alienist, and I still don't regret having returned him to freedom.","“Thank you,” said the alienist. “Obviously I was right to set you free.”","“Thank you,” said the alienist, “for confirming that I was correct to release you.”"
"Os vereadores, às janelas, vendo a multidão e a tropa, cuidaram que a tropa capturara a multidão, e sem mais exame, entraram e votaram uma petição ao vice-rei para que mandasse dar um mês de soldo aos dragões, “cujo denodo salvou Itaguaí do abismo a que o tinha lançado uma cáfila de rebeldes”. Esta frase foi proposta por Sebastião Freitas, o vereador dissidente, cuja defesa dos Canjicas tanto escandalizara os colegas. Mas bem depressa a ilusão se desfez. Os vivas ao barbeiro, os morras aos vereadores e ao alienista vieram dar-lhes notícia da triste realidade. O presidente não desanimou: — Qualquer que seja a nossa sorte, disse ele, lembremo-nos que estamos ao serviço de Sua Majestade e do povo. — Sebastião Freitas insinuou que melhor se poderia servir à coroa e à vila saindo pelos fundos e indo conferenciar com o juiz de fora, mas toda a câmara rejeitou esse alvitre.","The councilors, at the windows, seeing the crowd and the troops, thought that the troops had captured the crowd, and without further examination, they went in and voted on a petition to the viceroy to order a month's pay to be given to the dragons, ""whose courage he saved. Itaguaí from the abyss into which a group of rebels had thrown him”. This sentence was proposed by Sebastião Freitas, the dissident councilor, whose defense of the Canjicas had so scandalized his colleagues. But very quickly the illusion was shattered. The cheers to the barber, the dying to the councilors and the alienist came to give them news of the sad reality. The president was not discouraged: — Whatever our fate, he said, let us remember that we are at the service of His Majesty and the people. — Sebastião Freitas suggested that the crown and the town could be better served by going out the back and going to confer with the outside judge, but the entire chamber rejected that suggestion.","The Councilmen, watching from the windows, thought that the troops had captured the Stewed Corners. The Council formally resolved to send a petition to the Viceroy asking him to give an extra month’s pay to the dragoons, “whose high devotion to duty has saved Itaguai from the chaos of rebellion and mob rule.” This phrase was proposed by Sebastião Freitas, whose defense of the rebels had so scandalized his colleagues. But the legislators were soon disillusioned. They could now clearly hear the vivas for the barber and the shouts of “death to the Councilmen” and “death to the alienist.” The President held his head high and said: “Whatever may be our fate, let us never forget that we are the servants of His Majesty and of the people of Itaguai.” Sebastião suggested that perhaps they could best serve the Crown and the town by sneaking out the back door and going to the Circuit Judge’s office for advice and help, but all the other members of the Council rejected this suggestion.","The councilmen, peering from the windows of the town hall, assumed that the dragoons were bringing the rebels back as captives. Immediately, they voted to petition the viceroy for a bonus to reward the troops whose bravery had saved Itaguaí from “plunging headlong into the abyss of anarchy.” This phrase was proposed by Sebastião Freitas, the dissident councilman whose earlier defense of the rebels had so scandalized his colleagues. Very quickly, however, shouts of “Long live Porfírio” and “Death to the alienist” informed the council of the sad truth. Its president did not lose his nerve: “Whatever may be our fate, let us never forget that we are, above all, servants of His Majesty and Itaguaí.” Sebastião Freitas insinuated that their most effective service might be to exit by the backdoor and consult with the judge, but the other councilmen vigorously rejected that suggestion."
"Era decisivo. Simão Bacamarte curvou a cabeça juntamente alegre e triste, e ainda mais alegre do que triste. Ato contínuo, recolheu-se à Casa Verde. Em vão a mulher e os amigos lhe disseram que ficasse, que estava perfeitamente são e equilibrado: nem rogos nem sugestões nem lágrimas o detiveram um só instante.","It was decisive. Simão Bacamarte bowed his head together happy and sad, and even more happy than sad. Immediately afterwards, he retired to Casa Verde. In vain his wife and friends told him to stay, that he was perfectly healthy and balanced: neither entreaties nor suggestions nor tears stopped him for a single moment.","Simão Bacamarte bowed his head. He was both sad and happy, but more happy than sad. He immediately committed himself to the Green House. His wife and his friends begged him not to. They told him he was perfectly sane. They wept, they pleaded. All in vain.","The observation was decisive. Simão Bacamarte bowed his head, both sad and happy, but a bit happier than sad. Immediately, he interned himself in the Casa Verde. His wife and his friends begged him not to do it. There was absolutely nothing wrong with him, they said. But pleading and tears were to no avail."
"Não descrevo o terror do boticário ao ouvir dizer que o barbeiro ia à casa do alienista. — Vai prendê-lo, pensou ele. E redobraram-lhe as angústias. Com efeito, a tortura moral do boticário naqueles dias de revolução excede a toda a descrição possível. Nunca um homem se achou em mais apertado lance: — a privança do alienista chamava-o ao lado deste, a vitória do barbeiro atraía-o ao barbeiro. Já a simples notícia da sublevação tinha-lhe sacudido fortemente a alma, porque ele sabia a unanimidade do ódio ao alienista; mas a vitória final foi também o golpe final. A esposa, senhora máscula, amiga particular de D. Evarista, dizia que o lugar dele era ao lado de Simão Bacamarte; ao passo que o coração lhe bradava que não, que a causa do alienista estava perdida, e que ninguém, por ato próprio, se amarra a um cadáver. Fê-lo Catão, é verdade, sed victa Catoni,28 pensava ele, relembrando algumas palestras habituais do padre Lopes; mas Catão não se atou a uma causa vencida, ele era a própria causa vencida, a causa da república; o seu ato, portanto, foi de egoísta, de um miserável egoísta; minha situação é outra. Insistindo, porém, a mulher, não achou Crispim Soares outra saída em tal crise senão adoecer; declarou-se doente e meteu-se na cama.","I cannot describe the apothecary's terror when he heard that the barber was going to the alienist's house. —Go arrest him, he thought. And his anguish redoubled. Indeed, the moral torture of the apothecary in those days of revolution exceeds all possible description. Never did a man find himself in a tighter bid: the alienist's privation drew him to his side, the barber's victory drew him to the barber. The simple news of the uprising had already shaken his soul strongly, because he knew the unanimous hatred of the alienist; but the final victory was also the final blow. His wife, a manly lady, a particular friend of Dona Evarista, said that he belonged next to Simão Bacamarte; while his heart cried out to him that no, that the alienist's cause was lost, and that no one, by his own will, ties himself to a corpse. Cato did it, it's true, sed victa Catoni,28 he thought, recalling some of Father Lopes' usual lectures; but Cato was not tied to a defeated cause, he was the defeated cause itself, the cause of the republic; his act, therefore, was that of an egoist, of a selfish wretch; my situation is different. However, when the woman insisted, Crispim Soares found no other way out of such a crisis than to get sick; declared himself ill and went to bed.","The barber knew that it would have been more fitting for him to have ordered Bacamarte to come to the palace, but he was afaid the alienist would refuse and so he decided to exercise forbearance in the use of his powers. Crispim Soares was in bed at the time. The druggist was undergoing continual mental torture these days. His intimacy with Simão Bacamarte called him to the doctor’s defense, and Porfírio’s victory called him to the barber’s side. This victory, together with the intensity of the hatred for Bacamarte, made it unprofitable and perhaps dangerous for Crispim to continue to associate with the doctor. But the druggist’s wife, a masculine woman who was very close to Dona Evarista, told him that he owed the alienist an obligation of loyalty. The dilemma appeared insoluble, so Crispim avoided it by the only means he could devise: he said he was sick, and went to bed.","I will not describe the apothecary’s terrified state of mind when told that the barber was going to Bacamarte’s house. “They’re going to arrest him,” he thought. The apothecary’s anguish during those days of revolution can hardly be imagined. No man ever found himself on the horns of a worse dilemma. Bacamarte’s hour of need called Crispim Soares to his friend’s side, but the triumph of the barber called him to the barber. News of the rebellion had burdened the apothecary’s spirit severely the day before, because he knew that the alienist was universally hated. News of the barber’s triumph a few hours later had been the last straw. Crispim’s wife, a woman of fortitude and a particular friend of Dona Evarista, had told him that his place was at the side of Simão Bacamarte. But his heart had cried out that, no, it was a lost cause, and nobody willingly espouses a lost cause. “Cato did it, true enough,” he had reflected, “when he fell on his own sword.” Father Lopes had often told him the story of Cato’s suicide when Julius Caesar conquered Pompeii. But Crispim reasoned that Cato had no choice, and he did. So, when his wife had insisted that he make his stand with the alienist, Crispim Soares declared that he had a fever and felt ill."

Itaguaians, I ask only for your trust and for your help in restoring peace and the public funds, recklessly squandered by the Council. You may count on me to make every personal sacrifice for the common good, and you may rest assured that we shall have the full support of the Crown.","“The former, privileged town council, grown negligent and corrupt, was conspiring against the interests of His Majesty and the People. Public opinion condemned it, and now a handful of citizens, aided by the courageous Royal Dragoons, have dissolved it and, with the unanimous consensus of the townspeople, have confided in me, your faithful servant, the responsibility of governing until such a time as His Majesty disposes otherwise. People of Itaguaí! All that I ask is your confidence and your help in restoring public tranquility and probity in the management of our public finances, so needlessly squandered by the council that you have seen fit to overthrow today. Rest assured of my disposition to self-sacrifice and of the eventual favor and gratitude of His Majesty."
