"Não só era o maior viajante, porque o mais verdadeiro, que tenho conhecido: era também uma das pessoas mais felizes que me tem sido dado encontrar. Tenho pena de não saber o que é feito dele, ou, na verdade, suponho somente que deveria ter pena; na realidade não a tenho, pois hoje, que passaram dez anos, ou mais, sobre o breve tempo em que o conheci, deve ser homem, estúpido, cumpridor dos seus deveres, casado talvez, sustentáculo social de qualquer — morto, enfim, em sua mesma vida. É até capaz de ter viajado com o corpo, ele que tão bem viajava com a alma.","Not only was he the greatest traveller, because the truest, that I have known: he was also one of the happiest people I have been able to meet. I'm sorry I don't know what's become of him, or, indeed, I only suppose I should be sorry; In fact, I don't have it, because today, ten years or more have passed since I met him, he must be a man, stupid, fulfilling his duties, married perhaps, social support for anyone — dead, in short, in your same life. He is even capable of traveling with his body, he who traveled so well with his soul.","But I only felt it, I didn’t hear it. There was an intensity in the stranger’s singing that nourished the dreamer in us, or the part that cannot dream. For us, though, it was just something to look at in the street and we all noticed the policeman coming slowly round the corner.","He was not only the greatest – because truest – traveller I’ve known, he was also one of the happiest people I’ve had the privilege to meet. I regret not knowing what’s become of him, or rather , I pretend I should regret it; in fact I don’t, because by now, ten years or more after the brief period when I knew him, he must be a grown-up, a responsible idiot who fulfils his duties, perhaps as a married man, somebody’s provider – dead, that is, while still alive. And maybe he has even travelled in body, he who travelled so well in his soul."
"Um silêncio frio. Os sons da rua como que foram cortados à faca. Sentiu-se, prolongadamente, como um mal-estar de tudo, um suspender cósmico da respiração. Parara o universo inteiro. Momentos, momentos, momentos. A treva encarvoou-se de silêncio.","A cold silence. The sounds of the street as if they were cut with a knife. He felt, for a long time, like a malaise of everything, a cosmic suspension of breath. The entire universe had stopped. Moments, moments, moments. The darkness was clouded with silence.","And the symbol fuses with reality when I, a passerby in body and soul along these low streets leading down to the Tejo, see the city’s hills aglow, like a glory belonging to someone else, with the various colors and lights left behind by a sun that has already set.","A cold silence. The sounds from the street seemed to be cut by a knife. Then there was a long, cosmically held breath, a kind of generalized dread. The entire universe had stopped dead. Moments, moments, moments… Silence blackened the darkness."
"Quedar-nos-emos indiferentes à verdade ou mentira de todas as religiões, de todas as filosofias, de todas as hipóteses inutilmente verificáveis a que chamamos ciências. Tão-pouco nos preocupará o destino da chamada humanidade, ou o que sofra ou não sofra em seu conjunto. Caridade, sim, para com o “próximo” como no Evangelho se diz, e não com o homem, de que nele se não fala. E todos, até certo ponto, assim somos: que nos pesa, ao melhor de nós, um massacre na China? Mais nos dói, ao que de nós mais imagine, a bofetada injusta que vimos dar na rua a uma criança.","We will remain indifferent to the truth or lie of all religions, all philosophies, all uselessly verifiable hypotheses that we call science. Nor will we be concerned about the fate of so-called humanity, or what suffers or does not suffer as a whole. Charity, yes, towards the “neighbour”, as it is said in the Gospel, and not towards the man, who is not mentioned in him. And we all, to a certain extent, are like that: what does the best of us feel about a massacre in China? The most unjust slap we saw given to a child on the street hurts us the most.","There are some deep-seated griefs so subtle and pervasive that it is difficult to grasp whether they belong to our soul or to our body, whether they come from a malaise brought on by pondering the futility of life, or whether they are caused rather by an indisposition in some chasm within ourselves — stomach, liver or brain.","We are ultimately indifferent to the truth or falseness of all religions, all philosophies, and all the uselessly verifiable hypotheses we call sciences. Nor are we really concerned about the fate of so-called humanity, or about what as a whole it does or doesn’t suffer. Charity, yes, for our ‘neighbour’, as the Gospel says, and not for man, of whom it says nothing. And we all feel this way to a certain extent. How much does a massacre in China really disturb even the most noble of us? It’s more heart-rending, even for the most sensitively imaginative, to see a child in the street get slapped for no apparent reason."
"Reparando, às vezes, no trabalho literário abundante ou, pelo menos, feito de coisas extensas e completas de tantas criaturas que ou conheço ou de quem sei, sinto em mim uma inveja incerta, uma admiração desprezante, um misto incoerente de sentimentos mistos.","Noticing, at times, the abundant literary work, or at least made up of extensive and complete things of so many creatures that I either know or of whom I know, I feel in myself an uncertain envy, a contemptuous admiration, an incoherent mixture of mixed feelings.","I often wonder what kind of person I would be if I had been protected from the cold wind of fate by the screen of wealth, and my uncle’s moral hand had never led me to an office in Lisbon, and I had never moved on from there to other offices and reached the tawdry heights of being a good assistant bookkeeper in a job that is about as demanding as an afternoon nap and offers a salary that gives me just enough to live on.","When I consider all the people I know or have heard of who write prolifically or who at least produce lengthy and finished works, I feel an ambivalent envy, a disdainful admiration, an incoherent mixture of mixed feelings."
"É entre a sensação e a consciência dela que se passam todas as grandes tragédias da minha vida. Nessa região indeterminada, sombria, de florestas e sons de água toda, neutral até ao ruído das nossas guerras, decorre aquele meu ser cuja visão em vão procuro…","It is between her sensation and her consciousness that all the great tragedies of my life take place. In that indeterminate, dark region, of forests and sounds of water, neutral even to the noise of our wars, that being of mine, whose vision I seek in vain...",,"Sometimes we would leave together after dinner and stroll around for a while, talking. Vicente Guedes endured his utterly grey life with the indifference of a master."
"Não conheço prazer como o dos livros, e pouco leio. Os livros são apresentações aos sonhos, e não precisa de apresentações quem, com a facilidade da vida, entre em conversa com eles. Nunca pude ler um livro com entrega a ele; sempre, a cada passo, o comentário da inteligência ou da imaginação me estorvou a sequência da própria narrativa. No fim de minutos, quem escrevia era eu, e o que estava escrito não estava em parte alguma.","I know no pleasure like that of books, and I read little. Books are presentations to dreams, and one who, with the ease of life, enters into conversation with them, needs no introduction. I could never read a book with surrender to it; always, at every step, the commentary of intelligence or imagination hampered the sequence of the narrative itself. At the end of minutes, I was writing, and what was written was nowhere to be found.","How often, weighed down by a tedium that verges on madness, or an anguish that seems to go beyond all anguish, do I stop and hesitate before I rebel, do I hesitate and stop before making myself a god.","I know no pleasure like that of books, and I read very little. Books are introductions to dreams, and no introductions are necessary for one who freely and naturally enters into conversation with them. I’ve never been able to lose myself in a book; as I’m reading, the commentary of my intellect or imagination has always hindered the narrative flow. After a few minutes it’s I who am writing, and what I write is nowhere to be found."

Por vezes parecia mais uma doença1 dos olhos do que uma realidade da natureza.,Mist or smoke? Did it ascend from the earth or descend from the sky? It was not known: it was more like a disease of the air than a descent or an emanation. Sometimes it seemed more like an eye disease1 than a reality of nature.,Mist or smoke?

"Por que é bela a arte? Porque é inútil. Por que é feia a vida? Porque é toda fins e propósitos e intenções. Todos os seus caminhos são para ir de um ponto para o outro. Quem nos dera o caminho feito de um lugar donde ninguém parte para um lugar para onde ninguém vai! Quem desse a sua vida a construir uma estrada começada no meio de um campo e indo ter ao meio de um outro; que, prolongada, seria útil, mas que ficou, sublimemente, só o meio de uma estrada.","Why is art beautiful? Because it's useless. Why is life ugly? Because it's all ends and purposes and intentions. All your ways are to go from one point to another. I wish we had a path made from a place where no one leaves to a place where no one goes! Who would give his life to build a road that started in the middle of a field and ended up in the middle of another; that, prolonged, would be useful, but that remained, sublimely, only the middle of a road.","It is for me alone, even though I can’t see its waters flowing, that the wide river glitters beneath the sunset. It is for me alone that this open square was built looking out over the river and its turning tide. Was it today that the tobacconist’s assistant was buried in a common grave? Today’s sunset is not for him. But, even as I’m thinking this, quite against my will I suddenly understand that it also ceased to be for me … 377 [29 Jan 1932] Once the last heat of summer had relented and given way to a mellower sun, the autumn started — even before it was properly upon us — with a slight, long, undefined sadness, as if the sky had lost the will to smile.","Why is art beautiful? Because it’s useless. Why is life ugly? Because it’s all aims, objectives and intentions. All of its roads are for going from one point to another. If only we could have a road connecting a place no one ever leaves from to a place where no one goes! If only someone would devote his life to building a road from the middle of one field to the middle of another – a road that would be useful if extended at each end, but that would sublimely remain as only the middle stretch of a road!"
"Assim cada um se sonha, um momento, o chefe do exército de cuja cauda fugiu3. Assim cada um, entre a lama dos ribeiros, saúda a vitória que ninguém pôde ter, e de que ficou4 como migalhas entre nódoas na toalha que se esqueceram de sacudir5.","Thus each one dreams, for a moment, the leader of the army from whose tail he fled. Thus, each one, among the mud of the streams, salutes the victory that no one could have, and that remained4 like crumbs between stains on the towel that they forgot to shake5.","Somewhere there is a transcendent reason for all this, some fluid divinity, heard but not seen. Yes, I reread these pages representative of empty hours, of minor moments of tranquillity or illusion, great hopes turned into landscapes, griefs like rooms no one enters, a few voices, a great weariness, the gospel yet to be written.","Each of them, for a moment, has dreamed he’s the commander of the army whose rear guard he deserted. Each of them, from the sludge of streams, has hailed the victory which no one could win and which left only crumbs on the stained tablecloth that nobody remembered to shake."

"O meu desejo é fugir. Fugir ao que conheço, fugir ao que é meu, fugir ao que amo. Desejo partir — não para as Índias impossíveis, ou para as grandes ilhas ao Sul de tudo, mas para o lugar qualquer — aldeia ou ermo — que tenha em si o não ser este lugar. Quero não ver mais estes rostos, estes hábitos e estes dias. Quero repousar, alheio, do meu fingimento orgânico. Quero sentir o sono chegar como vida, e não como repouso. Uma cabana à beira-mar, uma caverna, até, no socalco rugoso de uma serra, me pode dar isto. Infelizmente, só a minha vontade mo não pode dar.","My wish is to run away. Running away from what I know, running away from what's mine, running away from what I love. I want to leave—not to the impossible Indies, or to the great islands south of everything, but to any place—village or wilderness—that has in itself the non-being of this place. I want to no longer see these faces, these habits and these days. I want to rest, oblivious, from my organic pretense. I want to feel sleep come as life, not rest. A cabin by the sea, a cave, even, on the rough terrace of a mountain, can give me this. Unfortunately, my will alone cannot give it to me.","Beneath the great blue canopy of the silent sky, I will always be a pageboy caught up in some incomprehensible ritual, clothed in life in order to take part in it, and blindly going through the different gestures and steps, poses and mannerisms, until the party or my role in it ends","I feel like fleeing. Like fleeing from what I know, fleeing from what’s mine, fleeing from what I love. I want to depart, not for impossible Indias or for the great islands south of everything, but for any place at all – village or wilderness – that isn’t this place. I want to stop seeing these unchanging faces, this routine, these days. I want to rest, far removed, from my inveterate feigning. I want to feel sleep come to me as life, not as rest. A cabin on the seashore or even a cave in a rocky mountainside could give me this, but my will, unfortunately, cannot."
"Todos os dias acontecem no mundo coisas que não são explicáveis pelas leis que conhecemos das coisas1. Todos os dias, faladas nos momentos, esquecem, e o mesmo mistério que as trouxe as leva, convertendo-se o segredo em esquecimento. Tal é a lei do que tem que ser esquecido porque não pode ser explicado. À luz do sol continua regular o mundo visível. O alheio espreita-nos da sombra.","Every day things happen in the world that cannot be explained by the laws we know about things1. Every day, spoken in the moments, they forget, and the same mystery that brought them carries them away, converting the secret into oblivion. Such is the law of what must be forgotten because it cannot be explained. Sunlight continues to regulate the visible world. The alien stalks us from the shadows.","The pain of not understanding the mystery of life, the pain of being unloved, the pain of others’ injustice to us, the pain of life crushing us, suffocating and imprisoning us, the pain of toothache, of pinching shoes — who can say which pain he finds the worse, let alone which is worse for others, or worse for others in general?","Every day things happen in the world that can’t be explained by any law of things we know. Every day they’re mentioned and forgotten, and the same mystery that brought them takes them away, transforming their secret into oblivion. Such is the law by which things that can’t be explained must be forgotten. The visible world goes on as usual in the broad daylight. Otherness watches us from the shadows."
"E é sempre a mesma sucessão das mesmas frases… “E então ela disse…” e o tom diz da intriga dela. “Se não foi ele, foste tu…” e a voz que responde ergue-se no protesto que já não oiço. “Disseste, sim senhor, disseste…” e a voz da costureira afirma estridentemente “Minha-mãe diz que não quer…” “Eu?” e o pasmo do rapaz que traz o lunch embrulhado em papel-manteiga não me convence, nem deve convencer a loura suja. “Se calhar era…” e o riso de três das quatro raparigas cerca do meu ouvido a obscenidade que ▢. “E então pus-me mesmo diante do gajo, e ali mesmo na cara dele — na cara dele, hein, ó Zé…” e o pobre diabo mente, pois o chefe do escritório — sei pela voz que o outro contendor era chefe do escritório que desconheço — não lhe recebeu na arena entre as secretárias o gesto de gladiador de palhinhas. “… E então eu fui fumar para a retrete…” ri o pequeno de fundilhos escuros.","And it's always the same succession of the same sentences...

"A literatura, que é a arte casada com o pensamento e a realização sem a mácula da realidade, parece-me ser o fim para que deveria tender todo o esforço humano, se fosse verdadeiramente humano, e não uma superfluidade do animal.

As flores, se forem descritas com frases que as definam no ar da imaginação, terão cores de uma permanência que a vida celular não permite.","Literature, which is art married to thought and realization without the stain of reality, seems to me to be the end towards which all human effort should tend, if it were truly human, and not a superfluity of the animal. I believe that to say one thing is to preserve its virtue and take away its terror1. The fields are greener in their saying than in their greenness. Flowers, if described with phrases that define them in the air of imagination, will have colors of a permanence that cellular life does not allow.","In those occasional moments of detachment in which we become aware of ourselves as individuals whom other people perceive as other, it has always bothered me to imagine the sort of moral and physical figure I must cut in front of those who see and talk to me whether daily or from time to time. We are all accustomed to think of ourselves as essentially mental realities and of others as merely physical realities; because of the way others respond to us, we do vaguely think of ourselves as physical beings; we vaguely think of other people as mental beings, but only when we find ourselves in love or conflict with another do we really take in the fact that others have a soul just as we do. That’s why I sometimes lose myself in futile imaginings about the kind of person I am for those who see me, what my voice sounds like, what kind of impression I leave on the involuntary memory of others, how my gestures, my words, my outward life engrave themselves on the retina of other people’s interpretations. I’ve never managed to see myself from outside. There is no mirror that can show us to ourselves as exteriors, because no mirror can take us outside ourselves. We would need another soul, another way of looking and thinking. If I were an actor captured on film or could record my speaking voice on disc I’m sure that I would still be a long way from knowing how I seem from outside because, whether I like it or not, record what I will of myself, I remain stuck here inside the high-walled garden of my consciousness of me. I don’t know if other people feel the same, or if the science of life does not indeed consist essentially in being so alienated from oneself that one instinctively achieves the alienation necessary to be able to participate in life as if unaware of one’s own consciousness; or if others, even more inward-looking than me, are not entirely given over to the brutishness of just being themselves, living entirely outwardly through that miracle whereby bees form societies better organized than any human nation and ants communicate in a language of tiny twitching antennae far superior to our complex ability to misunderstand one another. The geography of our consciousness of reality is one of complicated coastlines, lakes and rugged mountains. And to me, if I think about it too long, it begins to seem like the sort of map one finds in the Pays du Tendre or in Gulliver’s Travels, a joke drawn up with precision in some fantastic or ironic book for the diversion of superior beings who know where lands are really lands.vi For those who think, everything is complex, and thought, no doubt purely for its own pleasure, only complicates things further. But any thinking person has a need to justify his abdication with a vast manifesto of understanding, embellished, like the excuses given by liars, with the excess of detail which, when shaken off like earth from a plant, reveals the root of the lie. Everything is complex or perhaps it’s","Literature – which is art married to thought, and realization untainted by reality – seems to me the end towards which all human effort would have to strive, if it were truly human and not just a welling up of our animal self. To express something is to conserve its virtue and take away its terror. Fields are greener in their description than in their actual greenness. Flowers, if described with phrases that define them in the air of the imagination, will have colours with a durability not found in cellular life."
"Nos meus braços esquecerás o próprio caminho doloroso que te trouxe a eles. Contra o meu seio não sentirás mais o próprio amor que fez com que o buscasses!

Against my breast you will no longer feel the very love that made you seek it! Sit by my side, on my throne, and you are forever the indestructible emperor of the Mystery and the Grail, you coexist with the gods and with the destinies, in being nothing, in having nothing below and beyond, in not even needing the what you have left, not even what you lack, not even what you need.",,"‘In my arms you will forget even the painful road that brought you to them.

"Depois dos dias todos de chuva, de novo o céu traz o azul, que escondera, aos grandes espaços do alto. Entre as ruas, onde as poças dormem como charcos do campo, e a alegria clara que esfria no alto, há um contraste que torna agradáveis1 as ruas sujas e primaveril o céu de inverno banal. É domingo e não tenho que fazer. Nem sonhar me apetece, de tão bem que está o dia. Gozo-o com uma sinceridade de sentidos a que a inteligência se abandona. Passeio como um caixeiro liberto2.

It's Sunday and I don't have to. I don't even feel like dreaming, the day is so good. I enjoy it with a sincerity of senses to which the intelligence abandons itself. Walk like a freed clerk2. I feel old, just to have the pleasure of feeling myself rejuvenated.","I notice suddenly that there is much more noise, that there are many more people about. The footsteps of this larger number of passersby seem less hurried. Making a reappearance on the street, in sharp contrast to the leisurely pace of everyone else, come the brisk steps of the women selling fish and the swaying stride of the bakers with their monstrous baskets. The diverse monotony of the sellers of other produce is broken only by what’s in their baskets, varying more in color than in content. The milkmen rattle the miscellaneous metal cans of their meandering trade as if they were a bunch of absurd hollow keys. The policemen stand stolidly at the crossroads, civilization’s uniformed denial of the imperceptibly rising day. If only, I feel now, if only I could be someone able to see all this as if he had no relation with it other than that of seeing it, someone able to observe everything as if he were an adult traveler newly arrived today on the surface of life! If only one had not learned, from birth onwards, to give certain accepted meanings to everything, but instead was able to see the meaning inherent in each thing rather than that imposed on it from without. If only one could know the human reality of the woman selling fish and go beyond just labeling her a fishwife and the known fact that she exists and sells fish. If only one could see the policeman as God sees him. If only one could notice everything for the first time, not apocalyptically, as if they were revelations of the Mystery, but directly as the flowerings of Reality. I hear the hour struck by some bell or clock tower — it must be eight o’clock though I don’t count.","After many days of rain, the sky brings back its hidden blue to the vast expanses on high. Between the streets, whose puddles sleep like country ponds, and the clear and chilly gladness overhead, there’s a contrast that makes the dirty streets congenial and the dreary winter sky spring-like.

Feito o negócio, veio-lhe a sensibilidade. Só depois, é claro, pois, se viesse antes, o negócio nunca se faria. “Tenho pena do tipo”, disse-me ele. “Vai ficar na miséria.” Depois, acendendo o charuto, acrescentou: “Em todo o caso, se ele precisar qualquer coisa de mim” — entendendo-se qualquer esmola — “eu não esqueço que lhe devo um bom negócio e umas dezenas de contos”.","The boss Vasques made a business today in which he ruined a sick individual and his family.

"Passo por uma rua e estou vendo na face dos transeuntes, não a expressão que eles realmente têm, mas a expressão que teriam para comigo se soubessem a minha vida, e como eu sou, se eu trouxesse transparente nos meus gestos e no meu rosto a ridícula e tímida anormalidade da minha alma. Em olhos que não me olham, suspeito troças que acho naturais, dirigidas contra a excepção deselegante que sou entre um mundo de gente que age e goza; e no fundo suposto de fisionomias que passam gargalha da acanhada gesticulação da minha vida uma consciência dela que sobreponho e interponho. Debalde, depois de pensar isto, procuro convencer-me de que de mim, e só de mim, a ideia da troça e do opróbrio leve parte e esguicha. Não posso já chamar a mim a imagem do ver-me ridículo, uma vez objectivado nos outros. Sinto-me, de repente, abafar e hesitar numa estufa de mofas e inimizades. Todos me apontam a dedo do fundo das suas almas. Lapidam-me de alegres e desdenhosas troças todos que passam por mim. Caminho entre fantasmas inimigos que a minha imaginação doente imaginou e localizou em pessoas reais. Tudo me esbofeteia e me escarnece.

In eyes that don't look at me, I suspect mockery that I find natural, directed against the inelegant exception that I am among a world of people who act and enjoy; and in the supposed background of physiognomies that laugh at the shy gesticulation of my life, an awareness of it that I superimpose and interpose. In vain, after thinking about this, I try to convince myself that from me, and only from me, the idea of mockery and reproach takes off and spurts out. I can no longer call myself the image of seeing myself ridiculous, once objectified in others. I suddenly feel myself stifling and hesitating in a hothouse of mockery and enmity. All point fingers at me from the depths of their souls. All who pass me by, they stone me with merry and disdainful mockery. I walk among enemy ghosts that my sick imagination has imagined and located in real people. Everything slaps me and mocks me.

Something in me is always begging for compassion, and it weeps over itself as over a dead god whose altars were all destroyed when the white wave of young barbarians stormed the borders and life came and demanded to know what the empire had done with happiness. I’m always afraid others might talk about me. I’ve failed in everything. I didn’t dare think of being something; I didn’t even dream of thinking about being something, because even in my dreams – in my visionary state as a mere dreamer – I realized I was unfit for life.

"E assim sou, fútil e sensível, capaz de impulsos violentos e absorventes, maus e bons, nobres e vis, mas nunca de um sentimento que subsista, nunca de uma emoção que continue, e entre para a substância da alma. Tudo em mim é a tendência para ser a seguir outra coisa; uma impaciência da alma consigo mesma, como com uma criança inoportuna; um desassossego sempre crescente e sempre igual. Tudo me interessa e nada me prende. Atendo a tudo sonhando sempre; fixo os mínimos gestos faciais de com quem falo, recolho as entoações milimétricas dos seus dizeres expressos; mas ao ouvi-lo, não o escuto, estou pensando noutra coisa, e o que menos colhi da conversa foi a noção do que nela se disse, da minha parte ou da parte de com quem falei. Assim, muitas vezes, repito a alguém o que já lhe repeti, pergunto-lhe de novo aquilo a que ele já me respondeu; mas posso descrever, em quatro palavras fotográficas, o semblante muscular com que ele disse o que me não lembra, ou a inclinação de ouvir com os olhos com que recebeu a narrativa que me não recordava ter-lhe feito. Sou dois, e ambos têm a distância — irmãos siameses que não estão pegados1.","And so I am, futile and sensitive, capable of violent and absorbing impulses, bad and good, noble and base, but never of a feeling that subsists, never of an emotion that continues, and enters the substance of the soul. Everything in me is the tendency to be after something else; an impatience of the soul with itself, as with an inopportune child; an ever-increasing and ever-equal unrest. Everything interests me and nothing holds me back. I attend to everything dreaming always; I fix the minimal facial gestures of the person I am talking to, I collect the millimetric intonations of their expressed sayings; but when I hear him, I don't hear him, I'm thinking about something else, and what I least gleaned from the conversation was the notion of what was said in it, on my part or on the part of the person I spoke to. So, many times, I repeat to someone what I have already repeated to him, I ask him again what he has already answered me; but I can describe, in four photographic words, the muscular countenance with which he said what I do not remember, or the inclination to listen with the eyes with which he received the narrative that I did not remember having given him. I am two, and they both have the distance — Siamese twins who are not attached1.","[1929?] I have often tried in dreams to be the kind of imposing individual the Romantics imagined themselves to be, and whenever I have, I’ve always ended up laughing out loud at myself for even giving house-room to such an idea. After all, the homme fatal exists in the dreams of all ordinary men, and romanticism is merely the turning inside out of our normal daily selves. In the most secret part of their being, all men dream of ruling over a great empire, with all men their subjects, all women theirs for the asking, adored by all the people and (if they are inferior men) of all ages … Few are as accustomed to dreaming as I am and so are not lucid enough to laugh at the aesthetic possibility of nurturing such dreams. The most serious criticism of romanticism has not yet been made, namely, that it represents the inner truth of human nature, an externalization of what lies deepest in the human soul, but made concrete, visible, even possible, if being possible depends on something other than Fate, and its excesses, its absurdities, its various ploys for moving and seducing people, all stem from that. Even I who laugh at the seductive traps laid by the imagination often find myself imagining how wonderful it would be to be famous, how gratifying to be loved, how thrilling to be a success! And yet I can never manage to see myself in those exulted roles without hearing a guffaw from the other “I” I always keep as close to me as a street in the Baixa. Do I imagine myself famous? Only as a famous bookkeeper. Do I fancy myself raised up onto the thrones of celebrity? This fantasy only ever comes upon me in the office in Rua dos Douradores, and my colleagues inevitably ruin the effect. Do I hear the applause of the most variegated multitudes? That applause comes from the cheap fourth-floor room where I live and clashes horribly with the shabby furnishings, with the surrounding vulgarity, humiliating both me and the dream. I never even had any castles in Spain, like those Spaniards we Portuguese have always feared. My castles were built out of an incomplete deck of grubby playing cards; and they didn’t collapse of their own accord, but had to be demolished with a sweeping gesture of the hand, the impatient gesture of an elderly maid wanting to restore the tablecloth and reset the table, because teatime was calling like some fateful curse. Even that vision is of little worth, because I don’t have a house in the provinces or old aunts at whose table, at the end of a family gathering, I sit sipping a cup of tea that tastes to me of repose. My dream failed even in its metaphors and figurations. My empire didn’t even go as far as a pack of old playing cards. My victory didn’t even include a teapot or an ancient cat. I will die as I lived, among the bric-a-brac of my room, sold off by weight among the postscripts of things lost. May I at least take with me into the immense possibilities to be found in the abyss of everything the glory of my disillusion as if it were that of a great dream, the splendor of my unbelief like a flag of defeat — a flag held aloft by feeble hands, but dragged through the mud and blood of the weak and held on high as we sink into the shifting sands, whether in protest or defiance or despair no one knows … No one knows because no one knows anything, and the sands swallow up those with flags and those without … And the sands cover everything, my life, my prose, my eternity. I carry with me the knowledge of my defeat as if it were a flag of victory.","Futile and sensitive, I’m capable of violent and consuming impulses – both good and bad, noble and vile – but never of a sentiment that endures, never of an emotion that continues, entering into the substance of my soul. Everything in me tends to go on to become something else. My soul is impatient with itself, as with a bothersome child; its restlessness keeps growing and is forever the same. Everything interests me, but nothing holds me. I attend to everything, dreaming all the while. I note the slightest facial movements of the person I’m talking with, I record the subtlest inflections of his utterances; but I hear without listening , I’m thinking of something else, and what I least catch in the conversation is the sense of what was said, by me or by him. And so I often repeat to someone what I’ve already repeated, or ask him again what he’s already answered. But I’m able to describe, in four photographic words, the facial muscles he used to say what I don’t recall, or the way he listened with his eyes to the words I don’t remember telling him. I’m two, and both keep their distance – Siamese twins that aren’t attached."

"São cetins prolixos, púrpuras perplexas e os impérios seguiram o seu rumo de morte entre embandeiramentos exóticos de ruas largas e luxúrias de dosséis sobre paragens. Pálios passaram.

Forgotten the gardens in the suburbs and the waters in the fountains, mere continuation of what was left, distant laughter falling amid memories of lights, not that the statues on the alleys spoke, nor that the tones of autumn fringing tombs were lost, between yellows in sequence. The corner halberds for pompous times, green-black, old-purple and garnet the tone of the clothes; deserted squares in the midst of the evasions; and never again will the shadows that have left the contours of the aqueducts wander through flowerbeds where one passes.","The pain of not understanding the mystery of life, the pain of being unloved, the pain of others’ injustice to us, the pain of life crushing us, suffocating and imprisoning us, the pain of toothache, of pinching shoes — who can say which pain he finds the worse, let alone which is worse for others, or worse for others in general?","In lavish satins and puzzled purples the empires proceeded towards death under exotic flags flanking wide roads and luxurious canopies at the stopping-places. Baldachins passed by. Roads now drab, now spruce, let the processions come through. The weapons coldly flashed in the excruciatingly slow, pointless marches. The gardens on the outskirts were forgotten, and the fountains’ water was merely the continuation of what had been left behind, a distant laughter falling among memories of lights, which is not to say that the statues along the paths talked, nor did the succession of yellows stifle the autumn colours that embellished the tombs. The halberds were corners around which lay splendorous ages dressed in green-black, faded purple and garnet-coloured robes. Behind all the evasions, the squares lay empty, and never again would the flower beds where we stroll be visited by the shadows that had abandoned the aqueducts."

"Nunca me esqueceu aquela frase de Haeckel, o biologista, que li na infância da inteligência, quando se lêem as divulgações científicas e as razões contra a religião. A frase é esta, ou quase esta: que muito mais longe está o homem superior (um Kant ou um Goethe, creio que diz) do homem vulgar que o homem vulgar do macaco. Nunca esqueci a frase porque ela é verdadeira. Entre mim, que pouco sou na ordem dos que pensam, e um camponês de Loures vai, sem dúvida, maior distância que entre esse camponês e, já não digo um macaco, mas um gato ou um cão. Nenhum de nós, desde o gato até mim, conduz de facto a vida que lhe é imposta, ou o destino que lhe é dado; todos somos igualmente derivados de não sei quê, sombras de gestos feitos por outrem, efeitos encarnados, consequências que sentem. Mas entre mim e o camponês há uma diferença de qualidade, proveniente da existência em mim do pensamento abstracto e da emoção desinteressada; e entre ele e o gato não há, no espírito, mais que uma diferença de grau.","I have never forgotten that phrase by Haeckel, the biologist, which I read in the infancy of intelligence, when one reads scientific publications and reasons against religion. The sentence is this, or almost this: that the superior man (a Kant or a Goethe, I believe he says) is much further from the common man than the common man is from the ape. I have never forgotten the phrase because it is true. Between me, who am little in the order of those who think, and a peasant from Loures undoubtedly goes a greater distance than between that peasant and, I will no longer say a monkey, but a cat or a dog. None of us, from the cat to me, actually leads the life that is imposed on him, or the destiny that is given to him; we are all equally derived from I don't know what, shadows of gestures made by others, incarnated effects, consequences they feel. But between me and the peasant there is a difference in quality, arising from the existence in me of abstract thought and disinterested emotion; and between him and the cat there is, in the mind, only a difference of degree.","These pages are the doodles of my intellectual unconsciousness of myself. I set them down in a torpor of feeling, like a cat in the sun, and reread them at times with a dull, belated pang, as if remembering something I had always previously forgotten. Writing is like paying myself a formal visit. I have special rooms, recalled in the interstices of the imagination by someone else, where I enjoy myself analyzing what I do not feel and peer at myself as at a painting hung in the shadows. I lost my ancient castle even before I was born. The tapestries of my ancestral palace were all sold before I even came into being. My mansion, built before I lived, has now crumbled into ruins and, only at certain times, when the moon rises in me over the reeds, do I feel the chill of nostalgia emanating from that site where the toothless remains of the walls stand","I’ve never forgotten that phrase from Haeckel,* the biologist, whom I read in the childhood of my intelligence, that period when we’re attracted to popular science and writings that attack religion. The phrase is more or less the following: The distance between the superior man (a Kant or a Goethe, I believe he says) and the common man is much greater than the distance between the common man and the ape. I’ve never forgotten the phrase, because it’s true. Between me, whose rank is low among thinking men, and a farmer from Loures, * there is undoubtedly a greater distance than between the farmer and, I won’t say a monkey, but a cat or dog.

But between me and the farmer there’s a difference of quality, due to the presence in me of abstract thought and disinterested emotion; whereas between him and the cat, intellectually and psychologically, there is only a difference of degree."

"Não posso entreter-me com a especulação metafísica porque sei de sobra, e por mim, que todos os sistemas são defensáveis e intelectualmente possíveis; e, para gozar a arte intelectual de construir sistemas, falta-me o poder esquecer que o fim da especulação metafísica é a procura da verdade.","I cannot indulge in metaphysical speculation because I know all too well, and for myself, that all systems are defensible and intellectually possible; and, in order to enjoy the intellectual art of building systems, I lack the power to forget that the aim of metaphysical speculation is the search for truth.","The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","I can’t be satisfied by metaphysical speculation, for I know all too well (from my own experience) that all systems are defensible and intellectually possible, and to enjoy the intellectual art of constructing systems, I would have to be able to forget that the goal of metaphysical speculation is the search for truth."

"Sabemos bem que toda a obra tem que ser imperfeita, e que a menos segura das nossas contemplações estéticas será a daquilo que escrevemos. Mas imperfeito é tudo, nem há poente tão belo que o não pudesse ser mais, ou brisa leve que nos dê sono que não pudesse dar-nos um sono mais calmo ainda. E assim, contempladores iguais das montanhas e das estátuas, gozando os dias como os livros, sonhando tudo, sobretudo, para o converter na nossa íntima substância, faremos também descrições e análises, que, uma vez feitas, passarão a ser coisas alheias, que podemos gozar como se viessem na tarde.","We know well that every work has to be imperfect, and that the least sure of our aesthetic contemplations will be that of what we write. But everything is imperfect, there is no sunset so beautiful that it couldn't be more beautiful, or a light breeze that makes us sleepy that couldn't give us an even more peaceful sleep. And so, equal contemplators of mountains and statues, enjoying the days like books, dreaming everything, above all, to convert it into our intimate substance, we will also make descriptions and analyses, which, once done, will become alien things, which we can enjoy as if they came in the afternoon.","We know only too well that every work is doomed to imperfection and that there is no aesthetic contemplation less assured than the aesthetic contemplation of what we ourselves write. But everything is imperfect; there is no sunset, however lovely, that could not be more so, no gentle breeze lulling us to sleep that could not lull us into a still deeper sleep. Thus, equally contented contemplating mountains or statues, poring over the days as if they were books, above all dreaming everything in order to convert it into something intimately ours, we, too, will write descriptions and analyzes which, once written, will become alien objects that we can enjoy as if they had simply arrived along with the dusk.","We’re well aware that every creative work is imperfect and that our most dubious aesthetic contemplation will be the one whose object is what we write. But everything is imperfect. There’s no sunset so lovely it couldn’t be yet lovelier, no gentle breeze bringing us sleep that couldn’t bring a yet sounder sleep. And so, contemplators of statues and mountains alike, enjoying both books and the passing days, and dreaming all things so as to transform them into our own substance, we will also write down descriptions and analyses which, when they’re finished, will become extraneous things that we can enjoy as if they happened along one day."
"Palácios muito longe, parques absortos, a estreiteza das áleas ao longe, a graça morta dos bancos de pedra para os que foram — pompas mortas, graça desfeita, ouropel perdido.

"Por mais que por mim me embrenhe, todos os atalhos do meu sonho vão dar a clareiras de angústia.","As much as I go through me, all the shortcuts of my dream will lead to clearings of anguish.","All this mixing up of soul and feelings, of my thoughts with the air and the river, just to say that life wounds my sense of smell and my consciousness, just because I do not have the wit to use the simple, all-embracing words of the Book of Job: “My soul is weary of my life!”","However deeply I delve into myself, all of my dreams’ paths lead to clearings of anxiety."

And they were of the same humanity.","In these thoughts of mine and in the abrupt fall from light of that one high cloud, everything I am or was or whatever I think of what I am or was suddenly loses its grasp on the secret, the truth, perhaps even the danger there might be in whatever it is that uses life as its bed.","Through a passive association of ideas, I start thinking about the men whose consciousness of that space and time was so analytically and intuitively acute that it lost touch with the world. It seems ludicrous that on nights no doubt like this one, in cities surely not very different from the one in which I contemplate, there were men such as Plato, Scotus Erigena,* Kant and Hegel who virtually forgot about all this, who became different from these people. And they were from the same human race....."

"Antefalhei a vida, porque nem sonhando-a ela me apareceu deleitosa.

On such afternoons, I am filled, like the sea at high tide, by a feeling worse than tedium, but for which there is no other word than tedium — a feeling of desolate desolation, as if my entire soul were shipwrecked.","I bowed out of life before it began, for not even in dreams did I find it attractive. Dreams themselves wearied me, and this brought me a false, external sensation, as of having come to the end of an infinite road. I overflowed from myself to end up I don’t know where, and that’s where I’ve uselessly stagnated. I’m something that I used to be.

Estes livros, releio-os sempre a bem; e, se é certo que já os li todos muitas vezes, também é certo que a nenhum deles li em sequência.

There are two that never leave me — Father Figueiredo's Rhetoric1 and Father Freire's Reflections on the Portuguese Language2. I always reread these books carefully; and if it is true that I have read them all many times, it is also true that I have read none of them in sequence. I owe to these books a discipline that I almost believe to be impossible in myself—a rule of writing objectively, a law of why things are written.","How often, weighed down by a tedium that verges on madness, or an anguish that seems to go beyond all anguish, do I stop and hesitate before I rebel, do I hesitate and stop before making myself a god.","My favourite things to read are the banal books that sleep with me at my bedside.

It was as if each thing projected a vaguely diurnal shadow of itself, in all directions, with no light to explain it as a shadow, no place of projection to justify it as visible.","There was not the shading-off of edges and sharp angles that lingering mists usually lend to the outlines of trees or to the corners of buildings, nor were they half revealed and half obscured as one would have expected had it been real smoke. It was as if each thing projected all around it a vague diurnal shadow, but without there being any source of light that could produce such a shadow, nor any surface onto which it could be projected and which would account for its visibility.","One couldn’t even find, around the outlines of the trees or the corners of buildings, that blurring of contours and edges caused by true fog when it sets in, nor that slipping into view and out of view caused by real smoke.

I see those who leave and those who have not yet entered, waiting for some who are not seeing who leaves.","The banal fact of the existence of time, the confines that social life imposes on continuous time — a frontier around the abstract, a limit on the unknown — brings me back to myself. I come to, look around at everything, which is full of life and ordinary humanity now, and I see that, apart from the patches of imperfect blue where it still lingers, the mist has cleared completely from the sky and seeped instead into my soul and into all things, into that part of them that touches my soul.

Opium I have it in my soul.","The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","Today I’m an ascetic in my religion of myself.

"Estabelecer teorias, pensando-as paciente e honestamente, só para depois agirmos contra elas — agirmos e justificar as nossas acções com teorias que as condenam.

Todas as coisas são, até às suas raízes de mistério, da cor do meu aborrecimento1.","I watch myself. I present myself. My sensations pass before I don't know what to look at mine as external things. I hate myself in everything. All things are, to their roots of mystery, the color of my annoyance1.","On such afternoons, I am filled, like the sea at high tide, by a feeling worse than tedium, but for which there is no other word than tedium — a feeling of desolate desolation, as if my entire soul were shipwrecked.","I observe myself.

"Foi um momento, e já passou. Já vejo os móveis que me cercam, os desenhos do papel velho das paredes, o sol pelas vidraças poeirentas. Vi a verdade um momento. Fui um momento, com consciência, o que os grandes homens são com a vida. Recordo-lhes os actos e as palavras, e não sei se não foram também tentados vencedoramente pelo Demónio da Realidade. Não saber de si é viver. Saber mal de si é pensar. Saber de si, de repente, como neste momento lustral, é ter subitamente a noção da mónada íntima, da palavra mágica da alma. Mas essa luz súbita cresta tudo, consume tudo. Deixa-nos nus até de nós.","It was a moment, and it's gone. I can already see the furniture that surrounds me, the drawings on the old paper on the walls, the sun through the dusty windows. I saw the truth for a moment. I was a moment, with conscience, what great men are with life. I remind them of their deeds and words, and I don't know if they were also successfully tempted by the Demon of Reality. Not knowing yourself is living. Knowing bad about yourself is thinking. To suddenly know yourself, as in this lustral moment, is to suddenly have the notion of the intimate monad, the magic word of the soul. But this sudden light scorches everything, consumes everything. It leaves us naked even of ourselves.","It lasted only a moment and has passed now. I notice the furniture around me, the design on the old wallpaper, the sun through the dusty panes. For a moment I saw the truth. For a moment I was, consciously, what great men are throughout their lives. I recall their actions and their words and I wonder if they too were tempted by and succumbed to the Demon Reality. To know nothing about oneself is to live. To know a little about oneself is to think. To know oneself precipitately, as I did in that moment of pure enlightenment, is suddenly to grasp Leibniz ’s notion of the dominant monad, the magic password to the soul. A sudden light scorches and consumes everything. It strips us naked even of our selves.","It was just a brief moment, and it’s already over. Once more I see the furniture all around me, the pattern on the old wallpaper, and the sun through the dusty panes. I saw the truth for a moment. For a moment I was consciously what great men are their entire lives. I recall their words and deeds and wonder if they were also successfully tempted by the Demon of Reality. To know nothing about yourself is to live. To know yourself badly is to think. To know yourself in a flash, as I did in this moment, is to have a fleeting notion of the intimate monad, the soul’s magic word. But that sudden light scorches everything, consumes everything. It strips us naked of even ourselves."
"Tive um certo talento para a amizade, mas nunca tive amigos, quer porque eles me faltassem, quer porque a amizade que eu concebera fora um erro dos meus sonhos.

I have always lived isolated, and increasingly isolated, the more I found myself.","There were trails which somehow we knew, and we walked uncertainly along them among the dappled shadows and the shafts of cold, hard moonlight. We were talking of impossible things, and that whole real landscape was equally impossible.","I had a certain talent for friendship, but I never had any friends, either because they simply didn’t turn up, or because the friendship I had imagined was an error of my dreams.

"O tédio… Quem tem Deuses nunca tem tédio. O tédio é a falta de uma mitologia. A quem não tem crenças, até a dúvida é impossível, até o cepticismo não tem força para desconfiar.

Boredom is the lack of a mythology. For those who have no beliefs, even doubt is impossible, even skepticism has no strength to distrust.

Tedium is the lack of a mythology. To the unbeliever, even doubt is denied, even scepticism does not give the strength to despair.

"É preciso certa coragem intelectual para um indivíduo reconhecer destemidamente que não passa de um farrapo humano, aborto sobrevivente, louco ainda fora das fronteiras da internabilidade; mas é preciso ainda mais coragem de espírito para, reconhecido isso, criar uma adaptação perfeita ao seu destino, aceitar sem revolta, sem resignação, sem gesto algum, ou esboço de gesto, a maldição orgânica que a Natureza lhe impôs.

"Suponho que seja o que chamam um decadente, que haja em mim, como definição externa do meu espírito, essas lucilações tristes de uma estranheza postiça que incorporam em palavras inesperadas uma alma ansiosa e malabar. Sinto que sou assim e que sou absurdo. Por isso busco, por uma imitação de uma hipótese dos clássicos, figurar ao menos em uma matemática expressiva as sensações decorativas da minha alma substituída. Em certa altura da cogitação escrita, já não sei onde tenho o centro da atenção — se nas sensações dispersas que procuro descrever, como a tapeçarias incógnitas, se nas palavras com que, querendo descrever a própria descrição, me embrenho, me descaminho e vejo outras coisas. Formam-se em mim associações de ideias, de imagens, de palavras — tudo lúcido e difuso —, e tanto estou dizendo o que sinto, como o que suponho que sinto, nem distingo o que a alma me sugere do que as imagens, que a alma deixou cair, me enfloram no chão, nem até, se um som de palavra bárbara, ou um ritmo de frase interposta, me não tiram do assunto já incerto, da sensação já em parque, e me absolvem de pensar e de dizer, como grandes viagens para distrair. E isto tudo, que, se o repito, deveria dar-me uma sensação de futilidade, de falência, de sofrimento, não conseguem senão dar-me asas de ouro. Desde que falo de imagens, talvez porque fosse a condenar o abuso delas, nascem-me imagens; desde que me ergo de mim para repudiar o que não sinto, eu o estou sentindo já e o próprio repúdio é uma sensação com bordados; desde que, perdida enfim a fé no esforço, me quero abandonar ao extravio, um termo clássico1, um adjectivo espacial e sóbrio, fazem-me de repente, como uma luz de sol, ver clara diante de mim a página escrita dormentemente, e as letras da minha tinta da caneta são um mapa absurdo de sinais mágicos. E deponho-me como à caneta, e traço a capa de me reclinar sem nexo, longínquo, intermédio e súcubo, final como um náufrago afogando-se à vista de ilhas maravilhosas, em aqueles mesmos mares doirados de violeta que em leitos remotos verdadeiramente sonhara.","I suppose it's what they call a decadent, that there's in me, as an external definition of my spirit, those sad lucidities of a false strangeness that embody in unexpected words an anxious and juggling soul. I feel that I am like that and that I am absurd. That's why I seek, by imitating a hypothesis from the classics, to figure at least in an expressive mathematics the decorative sensations of my replaced soul. At a certain point in the written thought, I no longer know where my attention is focused — whether in the dispersed sensations that I try to describe, like incognito tapestries, or in the words with which, wanting to describe the description itself, I immerse myself, wander and see other stuff. Associations of ideas, images, words form in me — all lucid and diffuse — and I am either saying what I feel or what I suppose I feel, nor do I distinguish what the soul suggests to me from the images, which my soul has dropped, they flower me to the ground, not even, if a sound of a barbaric word, or a rhythm of an interposed sentence, doesn't take me away from the subject already uncertain, from the sensation already in park, and absolve me from thinking and saying, like big trips to distract. And all this, which, if I repeat it, should give me a feeling of futility, bankruptcy, suffering, can only give me golden wings. Ever since I speak of images, perhaps because I was condemning their abuse, images are born to me; as soon as I rise from myself to repudiate what I don't feel, I am already feeling it and the repudiation itself is a sensation with embroidery; since, finally losing faith in the effort, I want to go astray, a classic term1, a spatial and sober adjective, make me suddenly, like sunlight, see clearly before me the dormant written page, and the letters in my pen ink are an absurd map of magic signs. And I lay down as if with a pen, and I trace the cape of reclining without nexus, distant, intermediate and succubus, final like a castaway drowning at the sight of wonderful islands, in those same golden seas of violet that in remote beds I had truly dreamed .","[c. November 1932] Despite the clear perfection of the day, the sun-filled air stagnates. It isn’t the present tension created by a gathering thunderstorm, the unease of bodies lacking all will, a vague dullness in the otherwise true blue sky. It is the perceptible torpor of the promise of leisure, a feather lightly touching a drowsy cheek. Though it’s the height of summer, it feels like spring. The countryside seems tempting even to someone who wouldn’t usually enjoy it. If I were someone else, I think, this would be a happy day, for I would just feel it without thinking about it. Full of anticipated pleasure I would finish my day’s work, the work that is monotonously abnormal to me each and every day. I’d take the tram out to Benfica with a group of friends.","I suppose I’m what they call a decadent, one whose spirit is outwardly defined by those sad glimmers of artificial eccentricity that incarnate an anxious and artful soul in unusual words. Yes, I think that’s what I am, and that I’m absurd. That’s why, in the spirit of a classical writer, I try at least to place into an expressive mathematics the decorative sensations of my substituted soul. At a certain point in my written cogitation, I no longer know where the centre of my attention lies – whether in the scattered sensations I attempt to describe like enigmatic tapestries, or in the words which absorb me as I try to describe the act of describing and which, absorbing me, distract me and cause me to see other things. Beset by lucid and free associations of ideas, images and words, I say what I imagine I’m feeling as much as what I’m really feeling, and I’m unable to distinguish between the suggestions of my soul and the fruits born of images that fell from my soul to the ground, nor do I know whether the sound of a discordant word or the rhythm of an incidental phrase might not be diverting me from the already hazy point, from the already stowed sensation, thereby absolving me from thinking and saying, like long voyages designed to distract us. And all of this, which even as I’m telling it should stir in me a sense of futility, failure and anguish, gives me only wings of gold. As soon as I start talking about images, even if it’s to say they should be used sparingly, images are born in me; as soon as I stand up from myself to repudiate something I don’t feel, I start feeling that very thing, and even my repudiation becomes a feeling trimmed with embroidery; as soon as I want to abandon myself to the wind, having lost faith in my efforts, a placid phrase or a sober, concrete adjective suddenly, like sunlight, makes me clearly see the dormantly written page before me, and the letters drawn in my ink are an absurd map of magic signs. And I lay myself aside like my pen, and wrap myself in the flowing cape of obliviously leaning back, far away, intermediate and submissive, doomed like a castaway drowning within sight of marvellous islands, engulfed by the same purplish seas that he had so truly dreamed in distant beds."
"Acabo a minha solitária peregrinação. Um vasto silêncio, que sons miúdos não alteram no como é sentido, como que me assalta e subjuga. Um cansaço imenso das meras coisas, do simples estar aqui, do ▢ encontrar-me deste modo pesa-me do espírito ao corpo ▢. Quase que me surpreendo a querer gritar, de afundando-me que me sinto em um oceano de ▢ de uma imensidão que nada tem com a infinidade do espaço nem com a eternidade do tempo, nem com qualquer coisa susceptível de medida e nome. Nestes momentos de terror supremamente silencioso não sei o que sou materialmente, o que costumo fazer, o que me é usual querer, sentir e pensar. Sinto-me perdido de mim mesmo, fora do meu alcance. A ânsia moral de lutar, o esforço intelectual para sistematizar e compreender, a irrequieta aspiração artista a produzir uma coisa que ora não compreendo, mas que me lembro de compreender, e a que chamo beleza, tudo isto se me some do instinto do real, tudo isto se me afigura nem digno de ser pensado inútil, vazio e longínquo. Sinto-me apenas um vácuo, uma ilusão de uma alma, um lugar de um ser, uma escuridão de consciência onde estranho insecto ▢ procurasse em vão sequer a cálida lembrança1 de uma luz.","I finish my lonely pilgrimage. A vast silence, which small sounds do not change in how it is felt, as if it assails and subjugates me. An immense tiredness of mere things, of simply being here, of ▢ finding myself in this way weighs me down from spirit to body ▢. It almost surprises me that I want to scream, sinking that I feel myself in an ocean of ▢ an immensity that has nothing to do with the infinity of space, nor with the eternity of time, nor with anything susceptible of measurement and name. In these moments of supremely silent terror, I don't know what I am materially, what I usually do, what I usually want, feel and think about. I feel lost from myself, out of my reach. The moral urge to fight, the intellectual effort to systematize and understand, the restless artist aspiration to produce something that I don't understand now, but that I remember understanding, and which I call beauty, all this adds up to my instinct for the real, all this seems to me not even worthy of being thought useless, empty and distant. I just feel like a void, an illusion of a soul, a place of a being, a darkness of consciousness where a strange insect ▢ sought in vain even for the warm memory1 of a light.","In these thoughts of mine and in the abrupt fall from light of that one high cloud, everything I am or was or whatever I think of what I am or was suddenly loses its grasp on the secret, the truth, perhaps even the danger there might be in whatever it is that uses life as its bed. This, like a truant sun, is all that remains to me; the changing light lets its hands slip from the tall roofs and the inner shadow of all things slowly appears on the rooftops.","I end my solitary peregrination. A vast silence, impassive to slight sounds, assaults and overwhelms me. In both body and spirit I feel sorely weary of things, all things, of simply being here, of finding myself in this present state. I almost catch myself wanting to scream because of a feeling that I’m sinking in an ocean of whose immensity has nothing to do with the infinity of space or the eternity of time, nor with anything that can be measured and named. In these moments of supremely silent terror, I don’t know what I materially am, what I normally do, what I usually want, feel and think. I feel cut off from myself, outside of my reach. The moral impulse to struggle, the intellectual effort to systematize and understand, the restless artistic yearning to produce something that I no longer fathom but that I remember having fathomed and that I call beauty – all of this vanishes from my sense of reality, all of this strikes me as not even worthy of being considered useless, empty and remote. I feel like a mere void, the illusion of a soul, the locus of a being, a conscious darkness where a strange insect vainly seeks at least the warm memory of a light."

"Abandonar todos os deveres, ainda os que nos não exigem, repudiar todos os lares, ainda os que não foram nossos, viver do impreciso e do vestígio, entre grandes púrpuras de loucura, e rendas falsas de majestades sonhadas… Ser qualquer coisa que não sinta o pesar de chuva externa, nem a mágoa da vacuidade íntima… Errar sem alma nem pensamento, sensação sem si-mesma, por estrada contornando montanhas, por vales sumidos entre encostas íngremes, longínquo, imerso e fatal… Perder-se entre paisagens como quadros.

"O homem não deve poder ver a sua própria cara. Isso é o que há de mais terrível. A Natureza deu-lhe o dom de não a poder ver, assim como de não poder fitar os seus próprios olhos.","Man must not be able to see his own face. That's the most terrible thing. Nature gave him the gift of not being able to see it, as well as not being able to look into his own eyes.","[c. 19 June 1934] When we live constantly in the abstract — whether it be abstractness of thought or of feelings one has thought — it soon comes about that contrary to our own feelings and our own will the things in real life which, according to us, we should feel most deeply turn into phantasms.","Man shouldn’t be able to see his own face – there’s nothing more sinister. Nature gave him the gift of not being able to see it, and of not being able to stare into his own eyes."
"Só quando vem a noite de algum modo sinto, não uma alegria, mas um repouso que, por outros repousos serem contentes, se sente contente por analogia dos sentidos. Então o sono passa, a confusão do lusco-fusco mental que esse sono dera esbate-se, esclarece-se, quase se ilumina. Vem, um momento, a esperança de outras coisas. Mas essa esperança é breve. O que sobrevém é um tédio sem sono nem esperança, o mau despertar de quem não chegou a dormir. E da janela do meu quarto fito, pobre alma cansada de corpo, muitas estrelas; muitas estrelas, nada, o nada, mas muitas estrelas…","It is only when night comes that I somehow feel, not a joy, but a repose that, because other reposes are content, feels content by analogy with the senses. Then the sleep passes, the confusion of the mental twilight that this sleep had brought about fades, clears, almost lights up. Come, for a moment, the hope of other things. But that hope is brief. What ensues is boredom without sleep or hope, the bad awakening of someone who hasn't slept. And from the window of my room I gaze, poor soul tired of body, many stars; many stars, nothing, nothingness, but many stars…","Only when night comes do I feel, if not happiness, at least some kind of repose which I experience as contentment by analogy with other states of repose that do bring contentment. Then the drowsiness passes, the confused mental twilight of that state fades and grows clearer, almost lights up. For a moment a hope for other things arises. But such hopes are short-lived, overridden by a sleepless, hopeless tedium, the comfortless waking of one who has not slept. And, a poor soul weary of body, I stare out from the window of my room at the multitudes of stars; at multitudes of stars and nothing, nothingness, but oh so many stars …","Only when night comes do I feel, not happiness, but a kind of repose which, since other reposes are pleasant, seems pleasant by way of analogy. Then my sleepiness goes away, and the confusing mental dusk brought on by the sleepiness begins to fade and to clear until it almost glows. For a moment there’s the hope of other things. But the hope is short-lived. What comes next is a hopeless, sleepless tedium, the unpleasant waking up of one who never fell asleep.

"E no meio disto tudo a sua fisionomia, o seu traje, os seus gestos, não me escapam. Vivo ao mesmo tempo os seus sonhos, a alma do instinto e o corpo e atitudes deles.

I live their dreams, the soul of instinct and their bodies and attitudes at the same time.

"Não era bem sem caminhos a floresta incerta. Havia atalhos que, sem querer, conhecíamos, e os nossos passos ondeavam neles entre os mosqueamentos das sombras e o palhetar vago do luar duro e frio. Falávamos das coisas impossíveis e toda a paisagem real era impossível também.","The uncertain forest was not quite pathless. There were paths that we unintentionally knew, and our footsteps wavered in them between the dappled shadows and the vague pick of the hard, cold moonlight. We talked about impossible things and the whole real landscape was impossible too.","The boulder falls and kills a man; the greed or jealousy puts a weapon in someone’s hand, and the hand kills a man. That is how the world is, a dungheap of instinctive impulses, that somehow glitters in the shafts of sunlight, pale gold and dark gold. The mystics realized that repudiation was the best way of facing down the brutality of indifference, which constitutes the visible basis of things.","The obscure forest wasn’t entirely pathless. Our steps wended along trails that we instinctively knew, among dappling shadows and streaks of cold, hard moonlight. We talked about impossible things, and the whole of that real-life landscape was just as impossible."
"Chove, nesta tarde fria de inverno triste, como se houvesse chovido, assim monotonamente, desde a primeira página do mundo. Chove, e meus sentimentos, como se a chuva os vergasse, dobram seu olhar bruto para a terra da cidade, onde corre uma água que nada alimenta, que nada lava, que nada alegra. Chove, e eu sinto subitamente a opressão imensa de ser um animal que não sabe o que é, sonhando o pensamento e a emoção, encolhido, como num tugúrio, numa região espacial do ser, contente de um pequeno calor como de uma verdade eterna.","It rains, on this cold, sad winter afternoon, as if it had rained, so monotonously, from the front page of the world. It rains, and my feelings, as if the rain were bending them, bend their brute gaze to the land of the city, where a water flows that feeds nothing, that nothing washes, that nothing cheers. It rains, and I suddenly feel the immense oppression of being an animal that doesn't know what it is, dreaming of thought and emotion, huddled, as in a tugur, in a spatial region of being, content with a little warmth as with an eternal truth.","It’s raining on this cold, sad winter’s day, as if it had been raining monotonously like this since the world’s first page was written. It’s raining, and my feelings, as if the rain were bowing them down, bend their gaze to the ground, over which flows a water that feeds nothing, washes nothing clean and brings no joy. It’s raining, and I suddenly feel the immense oppressive weight of being an animal that doesn’t know what it is, dreaming its thoughts and emotions, hunched, as if in a hovel, in a spatial region of being, as contented with a little warmth as it would be with an eternal truth.","It’s raining on this cold and sad winter afternoon as if it had been raining, just as monotonously, since the first page of the world. It’s raining, and as if the rain had made them hunch forward, my feelings lower their stupid gaze to the ground, where water flows and nourishes nothing, washes nothing, cheers up nothing. It’s raining, and I suddenly feel the terrible weight of being an animal that doesn’t know what it is, dreaming its thought and emotion, withdrawn into a spatial region of being as into a hovel, satisfied by a little heat as by an eternal truth."
"O despertar de uma cidade, seja entre névoa ou de outro modo, é sempre para mim uma coisa mais enternecedora do que o raiar da aurora sobre os campos. Renasce muito mais, há muito mais que esperar, quando, em vez de só dourar, primeiro de luz obscura, depois de luz húmida, mais tarde de ouro luminoso5, as relvas, os relevos dos arbustos, as palmas das mãos das folhas, o sol multiplica os seus possíveis efeitos nas janelas, nos muros, nos telhados — nas janelas tantos, nos muros cores diferentes, nos telhados tons vários — grande manhã diversa a tantas realidades diversas. Uma aurora no campo faz-me bem; a aurora na cidade bem e mal, e por isso me faz mais que bem. Sim, porque a esperança maior que me traz tem, como todas as esperanças, aquele travo longínquo e saudoso de não ser realidade. A manhã do campo existe; a manhã da cidade promete. Uma faz viver; a outra faz pensar. E eu hei-de sempre sentir, como os grandes malditos, que mais vale pensar que viver.","The awakening of a city, whether amid fog or otherwise, is always something more touching to me than the dawning of the fields. Much more is reborn, there is much more to hope for, when, instead of just gilding, first with dim light, then with humid light, later with luminous gold5, the grasses, the reliefs of the bushes, the palms of the leaves, the sun multiplies its possible effects on windows, walls, roofs — on the windows so many, on the walls different colors, on the roofs different shades — a great morning different to so many different realities. A dawn in the countryside does me good; the dawn in the city good and bad, and that's why it does me more than good. Yes, because the greatest hope that it brings me has, like all hopes, that distant and longing aftertaste of not being reality. The morning of the field exists; the morning of the city promises. One makes living; the other makes you think. And I will always feel, like the great damned, that it is better to think than to live.","I’ve always found the awakening of a city, whether wreathed in mists or not, more moving than sunrise in the country. There is a stronger sense of rebirth, more to look forward to; instead of merely illuminating the fields, the silhouettes of trees and the open palms of leaves with first dark then liquid light and finally with pure luminous gold, the sun multiplies its every effect in windows, on walls, on roofs […] — so many windows, so many different walls, so many varied rooftops — a splendid morning, diverse among all those diverse realities. Seeing dawn in the countryside does me good, seeing dawn in the city affects me for both good and ill and therefore does me even more good. For the greater hope it brings me contains, as does all hope, the far-off, nostalgic aftertaste of unreality. Dawn in the countryside just exists; dawn in the city overflows with promise. One makes you live, the other makes you think. And, along with all the other great unfortunates, I’ve always believed it better to think than to live.","The awakening of a city, with or without fog, moves me far more than the breaking of dawn in the country. It’s much more of a rebirth, there’s much more to look forward to, when the sun – instead of just gilding the grasses, the shrubs’ silhouettes and the trees’ countless green hands with its murky, then moist, and finally luminously gold light – multiplies its possible effects on windows (in myriad reflections), walls (painting them different colours) and rooftops (shading each one uniquely) to make a glorious morning absolutely distinct from so many other distinctive realities. A dawning in the country does me good; a dawning in the city good and bad, and so it does me more than just good. Yes, because the greater hope it stirs in me has, like all hopes, that slightly bitter, nostalgic taste of not being reality. The country morning exists; the city morning promises. The former makes one live; the latter makes one think. And I’m doomed always to feel, like the world’s great damned men, that it’s better to think than to live."
"Um dia houve um acontecimento na rua, por baixo das janelas — uma cena de pugilato entre dois indivíduos. Os que estavam na sobreloja correram às janelas, e eu também, e também o indivíduo de quem falo. Troquei com ele uma frase casual, e ele respondeu no mesmo tom. A sua voz era baça e trémula, como a das criaturas que não esperam nada, porque é perfeitamente inútil esperar. Mas era porventura absurdo dar esse relevo ao meu colega vespertino de restaurante.","One day there was an event in the street, under the windows—a scene of boxing between two individuals. Those in the mezzanine rushed to the windows, and so did I, and so did the individual I speak of. I exchanged a casual phrase with him, and he responded in the same tone. His voice was dull and shaky, like that of creatures who don't expect anything, because it's perfectly useless to wait. But it was perhaps absurd to give this emphasis to my evening colleague at the restaurant.","“I did remain his friend, a friend devoted to the reason he had drawn me to him in the first place, that is, the publication of this his book.” [1] “Postpone everything. Never do today what you can put off until tomorrow. You don’t have to do anything, tomorrow or today.”","One day there was an incident in the street down below – a fist fight between two men. Everyone in the first-floor restaurant ran to the windows, including me and the man I’ve been describing. I made a casual remark to him and he replied in like manner. His voice was hesitant and colourless, as in those who hope for nothing because it’s perfectly useless to hope. But perhaps it was absurd to see this in my supper-time peer."
"Publicar-se — socialização de si próprio. Que ignóbil necessidade! Mas ainda assim que afastada de um acto — o editor ganha, o tipógrafo produz. O mérito da incoerência ao menos.","Publish yourself — socialization of yourself. What an ignoble necessity! But even when removed from an act — the editor wins, the typographer produces. The merit of inconsistency at least.","Others will lean from the same windows; those who have forgotten about shadowy fears are sleeping, nostalgic for the sun they never knew; and I myself, who dares but does not act, will end up, with no regrets, among those soggy reeds made muddy by the nearby river and by my own flaccid inertia, beneath the vast autumn skies of evening, in impossibly far-flung places.","To publish – the socialization of one’s self. A vile necessity! But still not a real act, since it’s the publisher who makes money, the printer who produces. It at least has the merit of being incoherent."
"Chamamos “românticos”, por igual, aos grandes que faliram e aos pequenos que se revelaram. Mas não há semelhança senão na sentimentalidade evidente; mas em uns a sentimentalidade mostra a impossibilidade do uso activo da inteligência; em outros mostra a ausência da própria inteligência. São fruto da mesma época um Chateaubriand e um Hugo, um Vigny e um Michelet. Mas um Chateaubriand é uma alma grande que diminui; um Hugo é uma alma pequena que se distende com o vento do tempo; um Vigny é um génio que teve de fugir; um Michelet uma mulher que teve de ser homem de génio. No pai de todos, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as duas tendências estão juntas. A inteligência nele era de criador, a sensibilidade de escravo. Afirma ambas por igual. Mas a sensibilidade social, que tinha, envenenou as suas teorias, que a inteligência apenas dispôs claramente. A inteligência que tinha só serviu para gemer a miséria de coexistir com tal sensibilidade.","We call “romantics”, equally, to the big ones who went bankrupt and the little ones who revealed themselves. But there is no resemblance except in the evident sentimentality; but in some the sentimentality shows the impossibility of the active use of the intelligence; in others it shows the absence of intelligence itself. A Chateaubriand and a Hugo, a Vigny and a Michelet are the result of the same period. But a Chateaubriand is a great soul that dwindles; a Hugo is a small soul that stretches with the wind of time; a Vigny is a genius who had to run away; a Michelet a woman who had to be a man of genius. In the father of all, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the two trends come together. The intelligence in him was that of a creator, the sensitivity of a slave. It states both equally. But the social sensibility, which he had, poisoned his theories, which intelligence only clearly disposed of. The intelligence he had only served to groan the misery of coexisting with such sensitivity.","The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","We apply the name ‘Romantics’ both to the great men who failed and to the little men who showed themselves for what they were. But the only similarity between the two is in their overt sentimentality, which in the former denotes an inability to make active use of the intelligence, while in the latter it denotes the lack of intelligence itself. A Chateaubriand and a Hugo, a Vigny and a Michelet, are products of the same age. But Chateaubriand is a great soul that was diminished, Hugo a little soul that was inflated by the winds of the day. Vigny is a genius that had to flee, Michelet a woman that was forced to be a man of genius. In the father of them all, Jean Jacques Rousseau, the two tendencies coincide. He possessed, in equal measure, the intelligence of a creator and the sensibility of a slave. His social sensibility infected his theories, which his intelligence merely set forth with clarity. His intelligence served only to bemoan the tragedy of coexisting with such a sensibility."
"Houve tempo em que me irritavam aquelas coisas que hoje me fazem sorrir. E uma delas, que quase todos os dias me lembram, é a insistência com que os homens quotidianos e activos na vida sorriem dos poetas e dos artistas. Nem sempre o fazem, como crêem os pensadores dos jornais, com um ar de superioridade. Muitas vezes o fazem com carinho. Mas é sempre como quem acarinha uma criança, alguém alheio à certeza e à exactidão da vida.","There was a time when I was irritated by those things that make me smile today. And one of them, which I am reminded of almost every day, is the insistence with which everyday men and women who are active in life smile at poets and artists. They do not always do it, as newspaper thinkers believe, with an air of superiority. They often do it with affection. But it is always like someone who cares for a child, someone who is oblivious to the certainty and exactitude of life.","There was a time when the very things that today make me smile used to irritate me intensely. One of them, of which I am reminded almost every day, is the way normal, active men persist in laughing at poets and artists. Although newspaper philosophers would have us believe otherwise, ordinary men do not always laugh at us with an air of superiority. They often do so affectionately. But it’s always rather like the pat on the head an adult would give a child, someone unconvinced of life’s certainty and exactitude.","There was a time when I was irritated by certain things that today make me smile. And one of those things, which I’m reminded of nearly every day, is the way men who are active in day-to-day life smile at poets and artists.

"E debruçado ao parapeito, gozando do dia, sobre o volume vário da cidade inteira, só um pensamento me enche a alma — a vontade íntima de morrer, de acabar, de não ver mais luz sobre cidade alguma, de não pensar, de não sentir, de deixar atrás, como um papel de embrulho, o curso do sol e dos dias, de despir, como um traje pesado, à beira do grande leito, o esforço involuntário de ser.","And leaning over the parapet, enjoying the day, over the various volumes of the entire city, only one thought fills my soul — the inner desire to die, to end, to see no more light on any city, not to think, not to feel. , to leave behind, like a wrapping paper, the course of the sun and the days, to undress, like a heavy garment, at the edge of the big bed, the involuntary effort to be.","Leaning over the balcony, enjoying the day, looking out at the diverse shapes of the whole city, just one thought fills my soul — the deep-seated will to die, to finish, no more to see light falling on a city, not to think or feel, to leave behind me, like discarded wrapping paper, the course of the sun and all its days, and to peel off the involuntary effort of being, just as one would discard one’s heavy clothing at the foot of the great bed.","And leaning on the windowsill to enjoy the day, gazing at the variegated mass of the whole city, just one thought fills my soul: that I profoundly wish to die, to cease, to see no more light shining on this city or any city, to think no more, to feel no more, to leave behind the march of time and the sun like a piece of wrapping paper, to remove like a heavy suit – next to the big bed – the involuntary effort of being."
"Reconheço hoje que falhei; só pasmo, às vezes, de não ter previsto que falharia. Que havia em mim que prognosticasse um triunfo?

What was there in me that predicted a triumph? I didn't have the blind strength of the victors or the right vision of the mad… I was lucid and sad like a cold day.","I don’t mean someone who is merely considered to be a great man, but a man who truly is. He has value, if there is such a thing in this world; other people know that and he knows they know. He therefore fulfills all the necessary conditions that allow me to call him a great man.","I realize now that I’ve failed, and it only surprises me that I didn’t foresee that I was going to fail. What was there in me to suggest I might triumph? I had neither the conqueror’s blind force nor the madman’s sure vision. I was lucid and sad, like a cold day."

And through the light taste of smoke all the past revives me.","It isn’t a difficult concept to grasp once one has seen it; after all, to someone whose experience of the equine is restricted to mules, a zebra must seem inconceivable. Feelings adjust themselves within us to certain degrees and types of comprehension of them.","Like someone who revisits a place where he lived in his youth, with a cheap cigarette I can return – heart and soul – to the time in my life when I used to smoke them. Through the mild flavour of the smoke, the whole of the past comes back to me."

"Que é viajar, e para que serve viajar? Qualquer poente é o poente; não é mister ir vê-lo a Constantinopla. A sensação de libertação, que nasce das viagens? Posso tê-la saindo de Lisboa até Benfica, e tê-la mais intensamente do que quem vá de Lisboa à China, porque se a libertação não está em mim, não está, para mim, em parte alguma. “Qualquer estrada”, disse Carlyle, “até esta estrada de Entepfuhl, te leva até ao fim do mundo.”1 Mas a estrada de Entepfuhl, se for seguida toda, e até ao fim, volta a Entepfuhl; de modo que o Entepfuhl, onde já estávamos, é aquele mesmo fim do mundo que íamos a buscar.","What is travel, and what is travel for? Any sunset is the sunset; there is no need to go to Constantinople to see him. The feeling of liberation that comes from traveling? I can have it going from Lisbon to Benfica, and have it more intensely than someone who goes from Lisbon to China, because if liberation is not in me, it is nowhere for me. “Any road,” said Carlyle, “up to this Entepfuhl road, takes you to the end of the world.”1 But the Entepfuhl road, if followed all the way to the end, returns to Entepfuhl; so that Entepfuhl, where we were already, is that very end of the world that we were going to seek.","Tomorrow we face the guillotine or, if not tomorrow, then the day after. Let us spend this respite before the end walking in the sun, wilfully disregarding all aims and pursuits. The sun will burnish our smooth brows and the breeze bring coolness to he who abandons all hope. I throw down my pen, and before I can pick it up again, it rolls back down the slope of the desk on which I write. All this came to me in a rush, and my happiness manifests itself in this gesture of an anger I do not feel. 284 [1930?] Symphony of an unquiet night Everything was sleeping as if the universe were simply a mistake, and the hesitant wind was a limp, unfurled flag on top of a nonexistent building.","What’s travel and what good is it? Any sunset is the sunset; one doesn’t have to go to Constantinople to see it. The sensation of freedom that travel brings? I can have it by going from Lisbon to Benfica,* and have it more intensely than one who goes from Lisbon to China, because if the freedom isn’t in me, then I won’t have it no matter where I go. ‘ Any road,’ said Carlyle,* ‘this simple Entepfuhl road, will lead you to the end of the World.’ But the Entepfuhl road, if it is followed all the way to the end, returns to Entepfuhl; so that Entepfuhl, where we already were, is the same end of the world we set out to find."
"Devaneio entre Cascais e Lisboa. Fui pagar a Cascais uma contribuição do patrão Vasques, de uma casa que tem no Estoril. Gozei antecipadamente o prazer de ir, uma hora para lá, uma hora para cá, vendo os aspectos sempre vários do grande rio e da sua foz atlântica. Na verdade, ao ir, perdi-me em meditações abstractas, vendo sem ver as paisagens aquáticas que me alegrava ir ver, e ao voltar perdi-me na fixação destas sensações. Não seria capaz de descrever o mais pequeno pormenor da viagem, o mais pequeno trecho de visível. Lucrei estas páginas, por olvido e contradição. Não sei se isso é melhor ou pior do que o contrário, que também não sei o que é.","Daydream between Cascais and Lisbon. I went to Cascais to pay a contribution from boss Vasques, from a house he owns in Estoril. I enjoyed in advance the pleasure of going, an hour there, an hour here, seeing the always different aspects of the great river and its Atlantic mouth. In fact, when I went, I lost myself in abstract meditations, seeing without seeing the aquatic landscapes that I was happy to go to see, and when I returned, I lost myself in the fixation of these sensations. I wouldn't be able to describe the smallest detail of the trip, the smallest stretch of visible. I profited from these pages, through oblivion and contradiction. I don't know if that's better or worse than the other way around, I don't know what it is either.","I find it so irritating, the happiness of all those men unaware of their unhappiness. Their human life is full of everything that would constitute a whole series of anxieties for any truly sensitive soul. However, since their real life is purely vegetative, any pain they feel passes by without even touching their soul, and they live a life that can only be compared to that of a rich man who occasionally suffers from toothache, but takes plenty of aspirin — the genuine good fortune of being alive without realizing it, which is the greatest gift the gods can give, because it is the gift of being similar to them, and, like them, superior (albeit in a different way) to those incidents called joy and pain. That is why, despite everything, I love them all. My beloved vege­tables! 201 [1929?] Isolation made me in its own image. The presence of another person — one person is all it takes — immediately slows down my thinking and, just as in a normal person contact with others acts as a stimulus to expression and speech, in me that contact acts as a counter-stimulus, if such a word exists. When I’m alone I can come up with endless bon mots, acerbic ripostes to remarks no one has made, sociable flashes of wit exchanged with no one; but all this disappears when I’m confronted by another human being. I lose all my intelligence, I lose the power of speech and after a while all I feel like doing is sleeping. Yes, talking to people makes me feel like sleeping. Only my spectral and imagined friends, only the conversations I have in dreams, have reality and substance, and in them the spirit is present like an image in a mirror. The whole idea of being forced into contact with someone oppresses me. A simple invitation to supper from a friend produces in me an anguish difficult to put into words. The idea of any social obligation — going to a funeral, discussing something with someone at the office, going to meet someone (whether known or unknown) at the station — the mere idea blocks that whole day’s thoughts and sometimes I even worry about it the night before and sleep badly because of it. Yet the reality, when it comes, is utterly insignificant, and certainly doesn’t justify so much fuss, yet it happens again and again and I never learn. “My habits are those of solitude not of men.”","I daydream between Cascais* and Lisbon. I went to Cascais to pay a property tax for my boss, Senhor Vasques, on a house he owns in Estoril. * I took anticipated pleasure in the trip, an hour each way in which to enjoy the forever changing views of the wide river and its Atlantic estuary. But on actually going out there, I lost myself in abstract contemplations, seeing but not seeing the riverscapes I’d looked forward to seeing, while on the way back I lost myself in mentally nailing down those sensations. I wouldn’t be able to describe the slightest detail of the trip, the slightest scrap of what there was to see. What I got out of it are these pages, the fruit of contradiction and forgetting. I don’t know if this is better or worse than the contrary, nor do I know what the contrary is."
Adelgaçava-se mais a névoa incerta. O sol invadia mais as coisas. Os sons da vida acentuavam-se no arredor.,The uncertain fog thinned further. The sun invaded more things. The sounds of life were accentuated around them.,"Quite independently of me the grass grows, the rain waters the grass as it grows and the sun turns to gold the whole field of grass that has grown or will grow; the mountains have been there since ancient times and the wind that blows sounds just as it did to Homer (even if he never existed).",The uncertain fog thinned even more. The sun penetrated things more deeply. The sounds of life were growing everywhere louder.
"Quando nasceu a geração a que pertenço encontrou o mundo desprovido de apoios para quem tivesse cérebro, e ao mesmo tempo coração. O trabalho destrutivo das gerações anteriores fizera que o mundo, para o qual nascemos, não tivesse segurança que nos dar na ordem religiosa, esteio que nos dar na ordem moral, tranquilidade que nos dar na ordem política. Nascemos já em plena angústia metafísica, em plena angústia moral, em pleno desassossego político. Ébrias das fórmulas externas, dos meros processos da razão e da ciência, as gerações, que nos precederam, aluíram todos os fundamentos da fé cristã, porque a sua crítica bíblica, subindo de crítica dos textos a crítica mitológica, reduziu os evangelhos e a anterior hierografia dos judeus a um amontoado incerto de mitos, de legendas e de mera literatura; e a sua crítica científica gradualmente apontou os erros, as ingenuidades selvagens da “ciência” primitiva dos evangelhos; ao mesmo tempo, a liberdade de discussão, que pôs em praça todos os problemas metafísicos, arrastou com eles os problemas religiosos onde fossem da metafísica. Ébrias de uma coisa incerta, a que chamaram “positividade”, essas gerações criticaram toda a moral, esquadrinharam todas as regras de viver, e, de tal choque de doutrinas, só ficou a certeza de nenhuma, e a dor de não haver essa certeza. Uma sociedade assim indisciplinada nos seus fundamentos culturais não podia, evidentemente, ser senão vítima, na política, dessa indisciplina; e assim foi que acordámos para um mundo ávido de novidades sociais, e com alegria ia à conquista de uma liberdade que não sabia o que era, de um progresso que nunca definira.","When the generation to which I belong was born, the world was devoid of support for anyone who had a brain and at the same time a heart. The destructive work of previous generations had meant that the world for which we were born had no security to give us in the religious order, no support to give us in the moral order, tranquility to give us in the political order. We were born in the midst of metaphysical anguish, in the midst of moral anguish, in the midst of political unrest. Intoxicated with external formulas, with the mere processes of reason and science, the generations that preceded us have all the foundations of the Christian faith, because their biblical criticism, rising from criticism of texts to mythological criticism, reduced the gospels and the previous one. Jewish hierography to an uncertain jumble of myths, legends and mere literature; and his scientific criticism gradually pointed out the errors, the savage naiveties of the primitive ""science"" of the gospels; at the same time, the freedom of discussion, which brought into play all metaphysical problems, dragged with them religious problems wherever they were metaphysical. Drunk with an uncertain thing, which they called “positivity”, these generations criticized all morals, scrutinized all the rules of living, and, from such a clash of doctrines, all that was left was the certainty of none, and the pain of not having that certainty. . A society so undisciplined in its cultural foundations could, of course, only be a victim, in politics, of that indiscipline; and so it was that we woke up to a world avid for social novelties, and with joy I was going to conquer a freedom that I didn't know what it was, a progress that I had never defined.","[13 July 1931] In the vague shadows cast by the dying light before the evening turns to early darkness, I enjoy wandering, unthinking, through what the city is becoming, and I walk as if everything were lost.","The generation I belong to was born into a world where those with a brain as well as a heart couldn’t find any support. The destructive work of previous generations left us a world that offered no security in the religious sphere, no guidance in the moral sphere, and no tranquillity in the political sphere. We were born into the midst of metaphysical anguish, moral anxiety and political disquiet. Inebriated with objective formulas, with the mere methods of reason and science, the generations that preceded us did away with the foundations of the Christian faith, for their biblical criticism – progressing from textual to mythological criticism – reduced the gospels and the earlier scriptures of the Jews to a doubtful heap of myths, legends and mere literature, while their scientific criticism gradually revealed the mistakes and ingenuous notions of the gospels’ primitive ‘science’. At the same time, the spirit of free inquiry brought all metaphysical problems out into the open, and with them all the religious problems that had to do with metaphysics. Drunk with a hazy notion they called ‘positivism’, these generations criticized all morality and scrutinized all rules of life, and all that remained from the clash of doctrines was the certainty of none of them and the grief over there being no certainty. A society so undisciplined in its cultural foundations could obviously not help but be a victim, politically, of its own chaos, and so we woke up to a world eager for social innovations, a world that gleefully pursued a freedom it didn’t grasp and a progress it had never defined."
"Tudo é o que somos, e tudo será, para os que nos seguirem na diversidade do tempo, conforme nós intensamente o houvermos imaginado, isto é, o houvermos, com a imaginação metida no corpo, verdadeiramente sido. Não creio que a história seja mais, em seu grande panorama desbotado, que um decurso de interpretações, um consenso confuso de testemunhos distraídos. O romancista é todos nós, e narramos quando vemos, porque ver é complexo como tudo.","Everything is what we are, and everything will be, for those who follow us in the diversity of time, as we have intensely imagined it, that is, we have truly been, with the imagination in the body. I do not believe that history, in its great faded panorama, is more than a course of interpretations, a confused consensus of distracted testimonies. The novelist is all of us, and we narrate when we see, because seeing is complex like everything else.","[1929?] In order to understand, I destroyed myself. To understand is to forget to love.","Everything is what we are, and everything will be, for those who come after us in the diversity of time, what we will have intensely imagined – what we, that is, by embodying our imagination, will have actually been. The grand, tarnished panorama of History amounts, as I see it, to a flow of interpretations, a confused consensus of unreliable eyewitness accounts. The novelist is all of us, and we narrate whenever we see, because seeing is complex like everything."
"Só na água dos rios e dos lagos ele podia fitar seu rosto. E a postura, mesmo, que tinha de tomar, era simbólica. Tinha de se curvar, de se baixar para cometer a ignomínia de se ver.","Only in the water of rivers and lakes could he look at her face. And the posture I had to take was symbolic. He had to bend over, to stoop to commit the ignominy of seeing himself.","one has thought — it soon comes about that contrary to our own feelings and our own will the things in real life which, according to us, we should feel most deeply turn into phantasms.","Only in the water of rivers and ponds could he look at his face. And the very posture he had to assume was symbolic. He had to bend over, stoop down, to commit the ignominy of beholding himself."
"Há dias que são filosofias, que nos insinuam interpretações da vida, que são notas marginais, cheias de grande crítica, no livro do nosso destino universal. Este dia é um dos que sinto tais. Parece-me, absurdamente, que é com meus olhos pesados e meu cérebro nulo que, lápis absurdo, se vão traçando as letras do comentário inútil e profundo.","There are days that are philosophies, that insinuate us interpretations of life, that are marginal notes, full of great criticism, in the book of our universal destiny. This day is one of those I feel such. It seems to me, absurdly, that it is with my heavy eyes and my null brain that, absurd pencil, the letters of the useless and profound commentary are traced.","May I always be blessed with the monotony, the dull sameness of identical days, my indistinguishable todays and yesterdays, so that I may enjoy with an open heart the fly that distracts me, drifting randomly past my eyes, the gust of laughter that wafts volubly up from the street somewhere down below, the sense of vast freedom when the office closes for the night, and the infinite leisure of my days off.","There are days that are philosophies, that suggest interpretations of life, that are marginal notes – full of critical observations – in the book of our universal destiny. This seems to be one of those days. I have the ludicrous impression that it is my heavy eyes and my empty brain that trace, like an absurd pencil, the letters of my profound and useless commentary."
"Sim, os outros não existem… É para mim que este poente estagna, pesadamente alado, as suas cores nevoentas e duras. Para mim, sob o poente, treme, sem que eu veja que corre, o grande rio.

Mas, de o pensar, e sem que eu queira, também deixou de ser para mim…","Yes, the others don't exist… It's for me that this sunset stagnates, heavily winged, its misty and harsh colors. For me, under the west, trembles, without my seeing it flowing, the great river. This open wide was made for me over the river whose tide comes in. Was the tobacconist's clerk buried today in the mass grave? The sunset of today is not for him. But, from thinking about it, and without my wanting to, it also stopped being for me…","That I should lose, as I grow older, imagination, emotion, a certain type of intelligence, a way of feeling, all that, whilst painful, would not shock me. But what is happening to me when I can read what I wrote as if it were written by a stranger? What shore can I be standing on that allows me to look down and see my own self at the bottom of the sea? On other occasions I’ve found passages I can’t remember having written, which is not so surprising, but to be unable to remember even having been capable of writing something, that terrifies me. Certain phrases belong to another way of thinking altogether. It’s as if I had found an old portrait, clearly of myself, yet showing someone of a different stature, with unrecognizable features that are still indisputably, frighteningly mine.","No, others don’t exist… It’s for me that this heavy-winged sunset lingers, its colours hard and hazy. It’s for me that the great river shimmers below the sunset, even if I can’t see it flow. It’s for me that this square was built overlooking the river, whose waters are now rising. Was the cashier of the tobacco shop buried today in the common grave? Then the sun isn’t setting for him today. But because I think this, and against my will, it has also stopped setting for me."
"Sim, o que eu sou fora insuportável, se eu não pudesse lembrar-me do que fui.

In that lies my originality.,"Yes, what I am would be unbearable if I couldn’t remember what I’ve been.

35.,35.,"I slowly shut the book and raise my eyes, weary with unshed tears, and of all the mingled feelings this arouses, I feel more than anything a sense of sadness that the closing of the office may mean the ending of my dream; that the gesture of my hand closing the book may mean covering up my own irreparable past; that I will go to the bed of life not in the least tired, but companionless and troubled, caught in the ebb and flow of my confused consciousness, twin tides flowing in the black night, at the outer limits of nostalgia and desolation.",35

"Sentir tudo de todas as maneiras; saber pensar com as emoções e sentir com o pensamento; não desejar muito senão com a imaginação; sofrer com coquetterie; ver claro para escrever justo; conhecer-se com fingimento e táctica, naturalizar-se diferente e com todos os documentos; em suma, usar por dentro todas as sensações, descascando-as até Deus; mas embrulhar de novo e repor na montra como aquele caixeiro que daqui estou vendo com as latas pequenas da graxa da nova marca.","To feel everything in every way; knowing how to think with emotions and feel with thoughts; not to desire much but with the imagination; suffer from coquetterie; see clear to write fair; getting to know each other with pretense and tactics, becoming naturalized differently and with all the documents; in short, to use all sensations from within, peeling them back to God; but wrap it up again and put it back in the window like that clerk I'm seeing from here with the small cans of new brand grease.","That’s how I am, frivolous and sensitive, capable of impulses that can be violent and all-consuming, good and bad, noble and base, but they never contain any lasting feeling, any enduring emotion that really penetrates the substance of my soul. Everything in me is a tendency to be about to become something else; an impatience of the soul with itself, as if with an importunate child; a disquiet that is always growing and always the same. Everything interests me and nothing holds my attention. I listen to everything while constantly dreaming; I notice the tiniest facial tics of the person I’m talking to, pick up minimal changes in the intonation of what they say; but when I hear, I do not listen, for I’m thinking about something else, and I come away from any conversation with little idea of what was said, either by me or by the other person.","To feel everything in every way; to be able to think with the emotions and feel with the mind; not to desire much except with the imagination; to suffer with haughtiness; to see clearly so as to write accurately; to know oneself through diplomacy and dissimulation; to become naturalized as a different person, with all the necessary documents; in short, to use all sensations but only on the inside, peeling them all down to God and then wrapping everything up again and putting it back in the shop window like the sales assistant I can see from here with the small tins of a new brand of shoe polish."

We have to cling to a support, to put our small hand in another hand; because the time is always uncertain, the sky is always far away, and life is always alien.","In the vague shadows cast by the dying light before the evening turns to early darkness, I enjoy wandering, unthinking, through what the city is becoming, and I walk as if everything were lost.","There’s a childish instinct in humanity that makes the proudest among us, if he’s a man and not crazy, long – Blessed Father! – for the paternal hand that would guide us, in whatever shape or form as long as it guides us, through the world’s mystery and confusion. Each of us is a speck of dust that the wind of life lifts up and then drops. We have to depend on a stronger force, to place our small hand in another hand, for today is always uncertain, the sky always far, and life always alien."
Ter já lido os Pickwick Papers é uma das grandes tragédias da minha vida. (Não posso tornar a relê-los.),Having read the Pickwick Papers is one of the great tragedies of my life. (I cannot reread them.),"Today tragedy is made visible by an absence and made tangible because it barely deserves to be felt. Ah, but the office boy left today.",One of my life’s greatest tragedies is to have already read The Pickwick Papers. (I can’t go back and read them for the first time.)
"Suponho que a maioria daqueles, com que cruzo no acaso das ruas, traz consigo — noto-lho no movimento silencioso dos beiços e na indecisão indistinta dos olhos ou no altear da voz com que rezam juntos — uma igual projecção para a guerra inútil do exército sem pendões. E todos — viro-me para trás a contemplar os seus dorsos de vencidos pobres — terão, como eu, a grande derrota vil, entre os limos e os juncos, sem luar sobre as margens nem poesia de pauis, miserável e marçana.","I suppose that most of those whom I pass by chance on the streets, carry with them - I can see it in the silent movement of their lips and in the indistinct indecision of their eyes or in the raising of the voice with which they pray together - an equal projection for the useless war of the army. without tassels. And all of them — I turn back to contemplate their backs of poor vanquished — will, like me, have the great vile defeat, among the silts and rushes, without moonlight on the banks or poetry of marshes, miserable and marçan.","The whole life of the human soul is just a movement in the half-light. We live in a twilight of consciousness never sure about what we are or what we think we are. Even in the best of us there exists some feeling of vanity about something, some error whose dimensions we cannot calculate.","I suppose that most of the people I chance to pass in the street also feel – I notice it in their silently moving lips and in their eyes’ vague uncertainty, or in the sometimes raised voice of their joint mumbling – like a flagless army fighting a hopeless war. And probably all of them – I turn around to see their slumping, defeated-looking shoulders – share with me this sense of salesmanly squalor, of being no more than humiliatingly vanquished stragglers amid reeds and scum, with no moonlight over the shores or poetry in the marshes."
"Não os sete palmos de terra fria que se fecham sobre os olhos fechados sob o sol quente e ao lado da erva verde, mas a morte que excede a nossa vida e é uma vida ela mesma — uma morta presença em algum deus, o ignoto deus da religião dos meus Deuses2.","Not the six feet of cold earth that closes over closed eyes under the hot sun and beside the green grass, but the death that exceeds our life and is a life itself - a dead presence in some god, the unknown god. of the religion of my Gods2.","The pain of not understanding the mystery of life, the pain of being unloved, the pain of others’ injustice to us, the pain of life crushing us, suffocating and imprisoning us, the pain of toothache, of pinching shoes — who can say which pain he finds the worse, let alone which is worse for others, or worse for others in general?","Not the six feet of cold earth that cover our closed eyes beneath the warm sun and next to the green grass, but the death that surpasses our life and is a life all its own – a dead presence in some god, the unknown god of the religion of my Gods. *"
OS GRANDES TRECHOS,THE GREAT STRETCHES,[1934?],A Disquiet Anthology
A única tragédia é não nos podermos conceber trágicos. Vi sempre nitidamente a minha coexistência com o mundo. Nunca senti nitidamente a minha falta de coexistir com ele; por isso nunca fui um normal.,The only tragedy is that we cannot conceive of being tragic. I have always clearly seen my coexistence with the world. I never clearly felt the lack of coexisting with him; so I was never a normal.,How many things are suggested to us by music and how comforting to know those things can never be!,The only tragedy is not being able to conceive of ourselves as tragic. I’ve always clearly seen that I coexist with the world. I’ve never clearly felt that I needed to coexist with it. That’s why I’ve never been normal.

"Quando, depostas as mãos sobre a mesa ao alto, lancei sobre o que lá via o olhar que deveria ser de um cansaço cheio de mundos mortos, a primeira coisa que vi, com ver, foi uma mosca varejeira (aquele vago zumbido que não era do escritório!) poisada em cima do tinteiro. Contemplei-a do fundo do abismo, anónimo e desperto. Ela tinha tons verdes de azul preto e era lustrosa de um nojo que não era feio. Uma vida!","When, placing my hands on the table at the top, I cast over what I saw there the look that must have been of a tiredness full of dead worlds, the first thing I saw, of course, was a blowfly (that vague buzzing that was not of the office!) perched on top of the inkwell. I looked at her from the bottom of the abyss, anonymous and awake. She had green shades of blue and black and was lustrous with a disgust that wasn't ugly. A life!","When I rested my hands on the desk again and glanced round with what must have been the terrible weariness of worlds long dead, the first thing my eyes saw was a bluebottle perched on my inkwell (so that was where the vague buzzing extraneous to the other office noises came from!). Anonymous and watchful, I regarded it from the pit of the abyss. Its lustrous green and blue-black tones were oddly repellent, but not ugly. It was a life!","When I laid my hands on the desk and looked at what was there with a gaze that must have been heavy with dead worlds, the first thing I saw, with my physical eyes, was a blowfly (that soft buzzing that didn’t belong to the office!) poised on top of the inkstand. I looked at it from the depths of the abyss, anonymous and attentive. It was coloured by green shades of black-blue, and its shiny repulsiveness wasn’t ugly. A life!"
457.,457.,"How often, to obtain a deeper sense of repose, do I remember what I never was, and there is no clarity, no nostalgia about my memories of a provincial town where I lived as people do, measuring out each floorboard, moving in and out of the long ago, in vast rooms I never knew.",457
"Bem aprontada esta ▢, dramas podem aparecer em nós, verso a verso, desenrolando-se alheios e perfeitos. Talvez já não haja a força de os escrevermos — nem isso será preciso. Poderemos criar em segunda mão — imaginar em nós um poeta a escrever, e ele escrevendo de uma maneira, outro poeta entretanto escreverá de outra... Eu, em virtude de ter apurado imenso esta faculdade, posso escrever de inúmeras maneiras diversas, originais todas.","▢ This well prepared, dramas can appear in us, verse by verse, unfolding alien and perfect. Perhaps we no longer have the strength to write them down—even that won't be necessary. We will be able to create second hand — imagine in ourselves a poet writing, and he writing in one way, another poet will write in another... .",,"We are mere ashes endowed with a soul but no form – not even that of water, which adopts the shape of the vessel that holds it. With this thoroughly established, complete and autonomous plays can unfold in us line by line. We may no longer have the energy to write them, but that won’t be necessary. We’ll be able to create secondhand; we can imagine one poet writing in us in one way, while another poet will write in a different way. I, having refined this skill to a considerable degree, can write in countlessly different ways, all of them original."
"Desde o princípio baço do dia quente e falso nuvens escuras e de contornos mal rotos rondavam a cidade oprimida. Dos lados a que chamamos da barra, sucessivas e torvas, essas nuvens sobrepunham-se, e uma antecipação de tragédia estendia-se com elas do indefinido rancor1 das ruas contra o sol alterado.","From the tarnished beginning of the hot day and false dark clouds and badly broken outlines roamed the oppressed city. On the sides we call the bar, successive and crooked, these clouds overlapped, and an anticipation of tragedy spread with them from the indefinite rancor1 of the streets against the altered sun.","On such afternoons, I am filled, like the sea at high tide, by a feeling worse than tedium, but for which there is no other word than tedium — a feeling of desolate desolation, as if my entire soul were shipwrecked.","Since the dull beginning of the hot, deceitful day, dark clouds with jagged edges had been ranging over the oppressed city. Towards the estuary they were grimly piled one on top the other, and as they spread, so did a forewarning of tragedy, in the streets’ vague rancour against the altered sun."

"Nada me comove que se diga, de um homem que tenho por louco ou néscio, que supera a um homem vulgar em muitos casos e conseguimentos da vida. Os epilépticos são, na crise, fortíssimos; os paranóicos raciocinam como poucos homens normais conseguem discorrer; os delirantes com mania religiosa agregam multidões de crentes como poucos (se alguns) demagogos as agregam, e com uma força íntima que estes não logram dar aos seus sequazes. E isto tudo não prova senão que a loucura é loucura. Prefiro a derrota com o conhecimento da beleza das flores que a vitória no meio dos desertos, cheia de cegueira da alma a sós com a sua nulidade separada.","Nothing moves me to be said of a man I consider to be mad or foolish, who surpasses an ordinary man in many cases and achievements in life. Epileptics are, in crisis, very strong; paranoids reason as few normal men can; the delusional with religious mania gather multitudes of believers as few (if any) demagogues do, and with an inner strength that they cannot give to their followers. And all this proves nothing but that madness is madness. I prefer defeat with the knowledge of the beauty of flowers than victory in the midst of deserts, full of blindness of the soul alone with its separate nullity.","And in the depths of my soul — the only reality of the moment — there is an intense, invisible pain, a sadness like the sound of someone weeping in a dark room.","I’m not impressed should someone tell me that a certain man I consider crazy or stupid surpasses a common man in many achievements and particulars of life. Epileptics have amazing strength when they go into seizure; paranoiacs have an ability to reason that few normal men can match; religious maniacs bring multitudes of believers together as few (if any) demagogues can, and with a force of conviction that the latter can’t inspire in their followers. And all that this proves is that craziness is craziness. I prefer a defeat that knows the beauty of flowers to a victory in the desert, full of blindness in the soul, alone with its isolated nothingness."
Tudo vem de fora e a mesma alma humana não é porventura mais que o raio de sol que brilha e isola do chão onde jaz o monte de estrume que é o corpo.,Everything comes from outside and the human soul itself is perhaps nothing more than the ray of sunlight that shines and isolates from the ground where the dung heap that is the body lies.,Everything comes from without and even the human soul is perhaps no more than the ray of sunlight shining in and picking out on the floor the dungheap that is the body.,"Everything comes from outside, and the human soul itself may be no more than the ray of sunlight that shines and isolates from the soil the pile of dung that’s the body."
Ler é sonhar pela mão de outrem. Ler mal e por alto é libertarmo-nos da mão que nos conduz. A superficialidade na erudição é o melhor modo de ler bem e ser profundo.,Reading is dreaming by the hand of another. To read wrongly and over the top is to free ourselves from the hand that leads us. Superficiality in scholarship is the best way to read well and be profound.,"Some are white, the tattered vanguard of some unknown army; others, more ponderous and almost black, are swept slowly along by the audible wind; besmirched with white, they seem inclined to linger and plunge into darkness the illusion of space afforded to the serried ranks of houses by the narrow streets, a darkness provoked more by their approach than by any actual shadow they cast. Clouds … I exist unconsciously and I’ll die unwillingly.","To read is to dream, guided by someone else’s hand. To read carelessly and distractedly is to let go of that hand.

"Quantos Césares fui, mas não dos reais. Fui verdadeiramente imperial enquanto sonhei, e por isso nunca fui nada. Os meus exércitos foram derrotados, mas a derrota foi fofa, e ninguém morreu. Não perdi bandeiras. Não sonhei até ao ponto do exército, onde elas aparecessem ao meu olhar em cujo sonho há esquina. Quantos Césares fui, aqui mesmo, na Rua dos Douradores. E os Césares que fui vivem ainda na minha imaginação; mas os Césares que foram estão mortos, e a Rua dos Douradores, isto é, a Realidade, não os pode conhecer.","How many Caesars have I been, but not the real ones. I was truly imperial while I dreamed, and that's why I was nothing. My armies were defeated, but the defeat was sweet, and no one died. I didn't lose flags. I did not dream until the point of the army, where they appeared to my eyes in whose dream there is a corner. How many Caesars have I been, right here, on Rua dos Douradores. And the Caesars I was still live in my imagination; but the Caesars who were are dead, and Rua dos Douradores, that is, Reality, cannot know them.","How many countless Caesars have I been, yet I was never like the real Caesars. I was truly imperial in my dreams and for that reason came to nothing. My armies were defeated, but it was a thing of no importance and no one died. No flags were taken. I never dreamed the army to the point where those flags might hove into view around the corner of my dreaming gaze. How many countless Caesars have I been right here in Rua dos Douradores. Those Caesars still live in my imagination, but the real Caesars are all long dead, and Rua dos Douradores, that is, Reality, would not now recognize them.","How many Caesars I’ve been, but not the real ones. I’ve been truly imperial while dreaming, and that’s why I’ve never been anything. My armies were defeated, but the defeat was fluffy, and no one died. I lost no flags.

"Não vale a pena pressentir nem conhecer. Todo o futuro é uma névoa que nos cerca e amanhã sabe a hoje quando se entrevê. Meus destinos os palhaços que a caravana abandonou, e isto sem melhor luar que o luar nas estradas, nem outros estremecimentos nas folhas que a brisa, e a incerteza da hora e o nosso julgar ali estremecimentos. Púrpuras distantes, sombras fugidias, o sonho sempre incompleto e não crendo que a morte o complete, raios de sol mortiço, a lâmpada da casa na encosta, a noite angustiosa, o perfume a morte entre livros só, com a vida lá fora, árvores cheirando a verdes na imensa noite mais estrelada do outro lado do monte. Assim as tuas agruras tiveram o seu consórcio benigno; as tuas poucas palavras sagraram de régio o embarque, não voltaram nunca naus nenhumas, nem as verdadeiras, e o fumo de viver despiu os contornos de tudo, deixando só as sombras, e os engastes, mágoas das águas nos lagos aziagos entre buxos por portões (à vista de longe) Watteau, a angústia, e nunca mais. Milénios, só os de vires, mas a estrada não tem curva, e por isso nunca poderás chegar. Taças só para as cicutas inevitáveis — não as tuas, mas a vida de todos, e mesmo os lampiões, os recessos, as asas vagas, ouvidas só, e com o pensamento, na noite inquieta, sufocada, que minuto a minuto se ergue de si e avança pela sua angústia fora. Amarelo, verde-negro, azul-amor — tudo morto, minha ama, tudo morto, e todos os navios aquele navio sem partir! Reza por mim, e Deus talvez exista por ser por mim que rezas. Baixinho, a fonte longe, a vida incerta, o fumo acabando no casal onde anoitece, a memória turva, o rio afastado… Dá-me que eu durma, dá-me que eu me esqueça, senhora dos Desígnios Incertos, Mãe das Carícias e das Bênçãos inconciliáveis com existirem…","It is not worth sensing or knowing. The entire future is a fog that surrounds us and tomorrow knows today when it is glimpsed. My fates are the clowns that the caravan abandoned, and this without better moonlight than moonlight on the roads, nor any other tremors in the leaves than the breeze, and the uncertainty of the hour and our judgment there tremors. Distant purples, fleeting shadows, the dream always incomplete and not believing that death completes it, rays of fading sun, the lamp of the house on the slope, the anguished night, the perfume death among books alone, with life outside, trees smelling of greens in the immense starry night on the other side of the hill. Thus thy hardships had their benign consort; your few words made the embarkation royal, no ships never returned, not even the real ones, and the smoke of living stripped the contours of everything, leaving only the shadows, and the settings, sorrows of the waters in the ill-fated lakes between boxwoods by gates (in sight from afar) Watteau, anguish, and never again. Millennia, only those to come, but the road has no curve, and therefore you will never be able to arrive. Cups only for the inevitable hemlocks - not yours, but everyone's life, and even the lanterns, the recesses, the vague handles, heard only, and with the thought, in the restless, suffocated night, which minute by minute rises from himself and advances through his anguish outside. Yellow, green-black, blue-love—all dead, my mistress, all dead, and all the ships on that ship without departing! Pray for me, and maybe God exists because you pray for me. Softly, the fountain far away, life uncertain, the smoke ending in the couple where it gets dark, the memory blurred, the river far away... of Blessings irreconcilable with existing…","We should think of them as the toothache or the corns of life, things that give us some discomfort but which, although ours, are outside us, as things that it is up to our organic existence to deal with, things that only our biology need concern itself with. Once we fully adopt this attitude, which, in a way, is that of the mystics, we are defended not only against the world but also against ourselves, because we have conquered what is other, what is external and contrary to us and therefore our enemy. That’s what Horace meant when he spoke of the just man who remained unmoved even as the world crashed about his ears. The image may be absurd, but the truth of its meaning is indisputable. Even if what we pretend to be — because the real we and the pretend we coexist — even if it collapses around us, we must remain unmoved, not because we are just, but because we are ourselves, and being ourselves means having nothing to do with those external things collapsing about us even if, in falling, they destroy what we are for them.","It’s useless to discern or foresee. The whole of the future is a mist that surrounds us, and when we glimpse tomorrow, it tastes like today. My destinies are the clowns that the caravan left behind, with no better moonlight than that of the open road, nor any quivering in the leaves except what the breeze causes, and the uncertainty of the moment, and our belief that they are quivering. Distant purples, fleeting shadows, the dream incomplete and no hope of death’s completing it, the rays of a dying sun, the light in the house on the hill, the anguished night, the perfume of death here among these books, all alone, with life outside, the trees smelling greenly in the vast night that is starrier on the other side of the hill… And so your sorrows had their solemn and benevolent union; your few words royally consecrated the voyage, no ships ever returned, not even the real ones, and the smoke of living stripped everything of its contours, leaving only the shadows and skeletons, the bitter waters of eerie ponds among boxwoods seen through gates that from a distance recall Watteau, anguish, and never again. Millenniums just for you to come, but the road has no curves and so you can never arrive. Goblets reserved for the inevitable hemlocks – not yours, but the life of us all, and even the street lamps, the nooks and crannies, the faint wings we only hear, while in the restless, suffocating night our thought slowly rises and paces across its anxiety… Yellow, green-black, love-blue: all dead, my divine nursemaid, all dead, and all ships are the ship that never set sail! Pray for me, and perhaps God will exist because it’s for me that you pray. The fountain softly pattering in the distance, life uncertain, the smoke fading to nothing in the village where night is falling, my memory so hazy, the river so far away… Grant that I may sleep, grant that I may forget myself, lady of Obscure Designs, Mother of Endearments and of Blessings incompatible with their own existence…"
"Farei do sonhar-te o ser forte, e a minha prosa, quando fale a tua Beleza, terá melodias de forma, curvas de estrofes, esplendores súbitos como os dos versos imortais.","I will make your strong being from dreaming, and my prose, when your Beauty speaks, will have melodies of form, curves of stanzas, sudden splendours like those of immortal verses.",,"Yes, this is my role as a stagnator of life, chiseller of inaccuracies, sick pageboy of my soul and Queen, reading to her at twilight not the poems from the book of my Life that lies open on my knees, but the poems that I invent and pretend to read, and that she pretends to hear, while somewhere and somehow the Evening is softening – over this metaphor raised up in me into Absolute Reality – the last hazy light of a mysterious spiritual day."
"A vida, para a maioria dos homens, é uma maçada passada sem se dar por isso, uma coisa triste composta de intervalos alegres, qualquer coisa como os momentos de anedotas que contam os veladores de mortos, para passar o sossego da noite e a obrigação de velar. Achei sempre fútil considerar a vida como um vale de lágrimas: é um vale de lágrimas, sim, mas onde raras vezes se chora. Disse Heine que, depois das grandes tragédias, acabamos sempre por nos assoar.1 Como judeu, e portanto universal, viu com clareza a natureza universal da humanidade.","Life, for most men, is a drudgery passed without realizing it, a sad thing composed of happy intervals, something like the moments of anecdotes that the wakes of the dead tell, to pass the peace of the night and the obligation to watch. I have always found it futile to consider life as a valley of tears: it is a valley of tears, yes, but where one rarely cries. Heine said that after great tragedies we always end up blowing our nose.1 As a Jew, and therefore universal, he saw clearly the universal nature of humanity.","For most people life is a bore that is over before they realize it, a sad business interspersed by a few happy interludes, rather like the anecdotes told by people watching over the dead in order to pass the still night and complete their vigil. I always found it futile to think of life as a vale of tears: it is a vale of tears but one where people rarely cry. Heine said that every great tragedy was followed by a general blowing of noses. As a Jew, he saw all too clearly the universal nature of humanity.","Life, for most people, is a pain in the neck that they hardly notice, a sad affair with some happy respites, as when the watchers of a dead body tell anecdotes to get through the long, still night and their obligation to keep watch. I’ve always thought it futile to see life as a valley of tears; yes, it is a valley of tears, but one in which we rarely weep. Heine said that after great tragedies we always merely blow our noses. As a Jew, and therefore universal, he understood the universal nature of humanity."
"Cheguei hoje, de repente, a uma sensação absurda e justa. Reparei, num relâmpago íntimo, que não sou ninguém. Ninguém, absolutamente ninguém. Quando brilhou o relâmpago, aquilo onde supus uma cidade era um plaino deserto; e a luz sinistra que me mostrou a mim não revelou céu acima dele. Roubaram-me o poder ser antes que o mundo fosse. Se tive que reencarnar, reencarnei sem mim, sem ter eu reencarnado.","I came today, suddenly, to an absurd and fair feeling. I noticed, in an intimate flash, that I am nobody. Nobody, absolutely nobody. When the lightning flashed, that where I supposed a city was a desert plain; and the sinister light it showed me revealed no sky above it. They robbed me of the power to be before the world was. If I had to reincarnate, I reincarnated without me, without having reincarnated myself.","[1 Dec 1931] Since I’m so given to tedium, it’s odd that until today I’ve never really thought much about what it actually consists of. Today I’m in that intermediate state of mind in which I feel no interest in life or in anything else.","Today I was struck by an absurd but valid sensation. I realized, in an inner flash, that I’m no one. Absolutely no one. In that flash, what I’d supposed was a city proved to be a barren plain, and the sinister light that showed me myself revealed no sky above. Before the world existed, I was deprived of the power to be. If I was reincarnated, it was without myself, without my I."
"Saber encontrar a cada sensação o modo sereno de ela se realizar. Fazer o amor resumir-se apenas a uma sombra de ser sonho de amor, pálido e trémulo intervalo entre os cimos de duas pequenas ondas onde o luar bate. Tornar o desejo uma coisa inútil e inofensiva, no como que sorriso delicado da alma a sós consigo própria; fazer dela uma coisa que nunca pense em realizar-se nem em dizer-se. Ao ódio adormecê-lo como a uma serpente prisioneira, e dizer ao medo que dos seus gestos guarde apenas a agonia no olhar, e no olhar da nossa alma, única atitude compatível com ser estética.","Knowing how to find in each sensation the serene way for it to come true. Making love just a shadow of being a dream of love, pale and trembling interval between the tops of two small waves where the moonlight beats. To make desire a useless and harmless thing, in the kind of delicate smile of the soul alone with itself; to make of it something that never thinks to be realized or to be said. To hate to put him to sleep like a prisoner snake, and to tell fear that from his gestures he only keeps the agony in his gaze, and in the gaze of our soul, the only attitude compatible with being aesthetic.","High up in the sky, like a visible void, hangs one tiny cloud, a pale forgotten fragment of the whole universe.","We should try to find a serene way to realize each sensation. To reduce love to the shadow of a dream of love, a pale and tremulous interval between the crests of two tiny, moonlit waves. To turn desire into a useless and innocuous thing, a kind of knowing smile in our soul; to make it into something we never dream of achieving or even expressing. To lull hatred to sleep like a captive snake, and to tell fear to give up all its outer manifestations except for anguish in our eyes, or rather, in the eyes of our soul, for only this attitude can be considered aesthetic."
"Era meio-dia e já, na saída para o almoço, pesava uma esperança má na atmosfera empalidecida. Farrapos de nuvens esfarrapadas negrejavam na dianteira dela. O céu, para os lados do Castelo, era limpo mas de um mau azul. Havia sol mas não apetecia gozá-lo.","It was midday and already, on the way out for lunch, there was a bad hope in the pale atmosphere. Tattered wisps of clouds blackened in front of her. The sky towards the Castle was clear but a bad blue. There was sun but I didn't feel like enjoying it.","On such afternoons, I am filled, like the sea at high tide, by a feeling worse than tedium, but for which there is no other word than tedium — a feeling of desolate desolation, as if my entire soul were shipwrecked.","At midday, when we left for lunch, a dire expectation hung in the pallid atmosphere. Shreds of tattered clouds were growing blacker in the foreground. Towards the Castle the sky was clear but with something ominous in its blue. The sun was out but it wasn’t enticing."
"Nessas horas estranhas não é só a minha vida material, mas a minha própria vida moral, que me são só apensos — desleixo a ideia do dever mas também a ideia de ser, e tenho sono físico do universo inteiro.

Sim, nessas horas sei mais de mim do que nunca soube, e todo eu sou todas as sestas de mendigos entre as árvores da quinta de Ninguém.","In these strange hours it is not only my material life, but my own moral life, that are only attached to me — I neglect the idea of duty but also the idea of being, and I have physical sleep from the entire universe. I sleep what I know and what I dream with an equality that weighs heavily on my eyes. Yes, in those hours I know more about myself than I ever did, and all of me is all the beggars' naps among the trees on Nobody's farm.","I am the outskirts of some nonexistent town, the long-winded prologue to an unwritten book. I am nobody, nobody. I don’t know how to feel or think or love. I’m a character in a novel as yet unwritten, hovering in the air and undone before I’ve even existed, among the dreams of someone who never quite managed to breathe life into me.","At these strange times, my moral as well as material life are mere appendages to who I am. I forget not only about the notion of duty but also about the idea of being, and I feel physically tired of the whole universe. I sleep what I know and what I dream with an equal intensity that makes my eyes sore. Yes, at these times I know more about myself than I’ve ever known, and I’m every snooze of every beggar lying under the trees on the estate of Nobody."

Each life – that of dreams and that of the world – has a reality all its own that’s just as valid as the other, but different. Like things near versus things far away. The figures of dreams are nearer to me, but ....."

"Assim como o Cristianismo não foi senão a degeneração bastarda2 do neoplatonismo abaixado, a judaização do helenismo pelo romano3, assim nossa época, senil e cancerígena4, é o desvio múltiplo de todos os grandes propósitos, confluentes ou opostos, de cuja falência surgiu a era com que faliram5.","Just as Christianity was nothing but the bastard degeneration2 of lowered Neoplatonism, the Judaization of Hellenism by the Roman,3 so our age, senile and cancerous,4 is the manifold deviation of all great purposes, confluent or opposed, from whose failure the era with that went bankrupt5.","To be understood is akin to prostituting oneself. I prefer to be taken seriously as what I am not and, with decency and naturalness, to be ignored as a person. Nothing would displease me more than to have my colleagues in the office think me different. I want to savor the irony of their not doing so. I want the penance of having them think me the same as them. I want the crucifixion of their not thinking me any different. There are more subtle martyrdoms than those recorded among saints and hermits. There are torments of the intellect just as there are of the body and of desire.

Esses cestos costumam ter duas tampas, como meias ovais, que se levantam um pouco em um ou outro dos extremos curvos se o bicho estrebucha. Mas o braço de quem transporta, apoiado um pouco ao longo dos dobramentos centrais, não deixa coisa tão débil erguer frustemente mais do que as extremidades inúteis, como asas de borboleta que enfraquecem.","And, today, thinking about what my life has been like, I feel like a living animal, transported in a basket to bend the arm, between two suburban stations. The image is stupid, but the life it defines is even stupider than it. These baskets usually have two lids, like oval socks, which lift a little at one or the other of the curved ends if the animal struggles. But the carrier's arm, supported a little along the central folds, doesn't let such a weak thing lift more than the useless ends, like weakening butterfly wings.","[5 Apr 1930] And today, thinking about my life, I feel like some living creature being carried in a basket on someone’s arm, between two suburban stations. It’s a stupid image, but then the life it describes is even more stupid.

However, the arm carrying the basket and resting lightly on the hinges in the middle doesn’t allow such a feeble creature to do anything more than vainly lift those ends, like the wings of a dying butterfly.","And today, thinking about what my life has been, I feel like some sort of animal that’s being carried in a basket under a curved arm between two suburban train stations.

"Que há-de alguém confessar que valha ou que sirva? O que nos sucedeu, ou sucedeu a toda a gente ou só a nós; num caso não é novidade, e no outro não é de compreender. Se escrevo o que sinto é porque assim diminuo a febre de sentir. O que confesso não tem importância, pois nada tem importância. Faço paisagens com o que sinto. Faço férias das sensações. Compreendo bem as bordadoras por mágoa e as que fazem meia porque há vida. Minha tia velha fazia paciências durante o infinito do serão. Estas confissões de sentir são paciências minhas. Não as interpreto, como quem usasse cartas para saber o destino. Não as ausculto, porque nas paciências as cartas não têm propriamente valia. Desenrolo-me como uma meada multicolor, ou faço comigo figuras de cordel, como as que se tecem nas mãos espetadas e se passam de umas crianças para as outras. Cuido só de que o polegar não falhe o laço que lhe compete. Depois viro a mão e a imagem fica diferente. E recomeço.","What will anyone confess that is worthy or useful? What happened to us, or happened to everyone or only to us; in one case it is not new, and in the other it is not understandable. If I write what I feel, it's because that's how I reduce the fever of feeling. What I confess doesn't matter, because nothing matters. I make landscapes with what I feel. I take a vacation from sensations. I understand well the embroiderers out of sorrow and those who make stockings because there is life. My old aunt was doing solitaire during the infinity of the evening. These confessions of feeling are my patience. I don't interpret them, as if using cards to find out their destiny. I don't listen to them, because in solitaires the cards have no real value. I unroll myself like a multicolored skein, or I make figures with string, like the ones that are weaved in skewered hands and passed from one child to the next. I just take care that the thumb doesn't miss the loop that belongs to it. Then I turn my hand and the image is different. And start over.","From the brief time in which I stagnated in that intellectual exile, I recall a few genuinely funny and enjoyable moments, and many more sad and monotonous ones, a few profiles silhouetted against the void, a few gestures directed at whatever waiter happened to be serving us; in short, a physically nauseating tedium and the memory of a few witty anecdotes. Interspersed like blank spaces among the others were a few older men, some of whom told hackneyed jokes and were just as bad as the others when it came to speaking ill of others; indeed, they spoke ill of the very same people. I never felt so sympathetic towards minor figures in the public eye as when I saw them criticized by these nobodies, even though they had never sought their pathetic public glory. I understood that the reason the pariahs of Greatness could triumph was because they triumphed over those nobodies and not over humanity as a whole. Poor devils, always hungry, either for lunch or fame or for life’s desserts. Any stranger hearing them speak would think he was listening to Napoleon’s teachers or to Shakespeare’s tutors. There are those who triumph in love, those who triumph in politics and those who triumph in art. The first have the advantage of being able to come up with their own version of their amorous triumphs without anyone knowing what really happened. However, when hearing one of these individuals describing his sexual marathons, one does tend to feel a touch suspicious when he reaches his seventh deflowering. Those who are the lovers of titled ladies or famous women (as almost all of them are) get through so many countesses that a list of their conquests would shake the gravity and composure of even the great-grandmothers of young women of title. Others specialize in physical conflict and claim to have slain all the boxing champions of Europe one drunken night on the corner of the Chiado. Some have influence with all the ministers in all the ministries, and their claims are slightly more plausible simply because they are less repellent. Some are great sadists, others are great pederasts, others proclaim in loud, mournful tones that they beat women, whom they have whipped along the paths of life. And they always leave someone else to pay the bill. Then there are the poets, the […]","What is there to confess that’s worthwhile or useful? What has happened to us has happened to everyone or only to us; if to everyone, then it’s no novelty, and if only to us, then it won’t be understood.

I can easily understand women who embroider out of sorrow or who crochet because life exists. My elderly aunt would play solitaire throughout the endless evening. These confessions of what I feel are my solitaire. I don’t interpret them like those who read cards to tell the future. I don’t probe them, because in solitaire the cards don’t have any special significance.

No one would love himself if he really knew himself1, and thus, without vanity, which is the blood of spiritual life, we would die in the soul of anemia2.

Don't go drunk; go dreamy. It is attentive to the non-existent; maybe still wait. The Gods, if they are just in their injustice, keep us dreams even when they are impossible, and give us good dreams, even if they are low. Today, when I'm not old yet, I can dream of islands in the south and impossible Indies; tomorrow maybe I will be given, by the same Gods, the dream of being the owner of a small tobacconist, or reformed in a house on the outskirts. Any of the dreams is the same dream, because they are all dreams. May the gods change my dreams, but not the gift of dreaming.","Like someone high on a peak trying to make out the lives of those living in the valley, I look down and see myself, along with everything else, as just a blurred, confused landscape. At times like this, when my soul is plunged into the abyss, even the tiniest detail grieves me as if it were a letter of farewell.","At this very moment, idle and alone in the office, because everyone else went to lunch, I’m staring through the grimy window at an old man who’s slowly teetering down the other side of the street. He’s not drunk; he’s dreaming. He’s attentive to what doesn’t exist. Perhaps he still hopes. If there’s any justice in the Gods’ injustice, then may they let us keep our dreams, even when they’re impossible, and may our dreams be happy, even when they’re trivial. Today, because I’m still young, I can dream of South Sea islands and impossible Indias. Tomorrow perhaps the same Gods will make me dream of owning a small tobacco shop, or of retiring to a house in the suburbs. Every dream is the same dream, for they’re all dreams. Let the Gods change my dreams, but not my gift for dreaming."

E não são na verdade absurdos e vãos todos os nossos receios, e todos os nossos ódios, e todos os nossos amores?","The child does not value gold more than glass. And really, is gold worth more?

"Não é o dia lento e suave, nublado e brando. Não é a aragem imperfeita, quase nada, pouco mais do que o ar que já se sente. Não é a cor anónima do céu aqui e ali azul, frouxamente. Não. Não, porque não sinto. Vejo sem intenção nem remédio. Assisto atento a espectáculo nenhum. Não sinto alma, mas sossego. As coisas externas, que estão nítidas e paradas, ainda as que se movem, são para mim como para o Cristo seria o mundo, quando, da altura de tudo, Satã o tentou. São nada, e compreendo que o Cristo se não tentasse. São nada, e não compreendo como Satã, velho de tanta ciência, julgasse que com isso tentaria.","It is not the day slow and smooth, cloudy and bland. It's not the imperfect breeze, almost nothing, little more than the air you already feel. There is the anonymous color of the sky here and there, loosely blue. Not. No, because I don't. I see without intention or remedy. I watch attentively to any show. I don't feel a soul, but I'm still. The external things, which are clear and still, even those that move, are for me what the world would be for Christ, when, from the height of everything, Satan tempted him. They are nothing, and I understand that Christ did not try. They are nothing, and I don't understand how Satan, old with so much science, thought that he would try to do so.","It’s not this slow, sweet day, cloudy and soft. It’s not the barely existent breeze, scarcely more insistent than the air I feel on my skin. It isn’t the anonymous color of the sky, touched feebly here and there with blue. It isn’t that. Because I feel nothing. I simply see unintentionally, unwittingly, the attentive spectator of a nonexistent spectacle. I cannot feel my soul and yet I’m quite calm. Everything in the external world, even those things that move, has grown clear and motionless, and it seems to me as the world must have seemed to Christ when he looked down at the city spread before him and was tempted by Satan. These things are nothing, and I understand why Christ wasn’t tempted. They are as nothing and I cannot understand how an old hand like Satan could possibly have imagined they could prove to be a temptation.","It’s not the mild and languidly cloudy day. It’s not the feeble, almost non-existent breeze, hardly more perceptible than the still air. It’s not the anonymous colour of the faintly and spottily blue sky. It’s none of this, because I feel none of it. I see without wanting to see, helplessly. I attentively watch the non-spectacle. I don’t feel my soul, just peace. External things, all of them distinct and now perfectly still, even if they’re moving, are to me as the world must have been to Christ when, looking down at everything, Satan tempted him. They are nothing, and I can understand why Christ wasn’t tempted. They are nothing, and I can’t understand why clever old Satan thought they would be tempting."
"Fazer uma obra e reconhecê-la má depois de feita é uma das tragédias da alma. Sobretudo é grande quando se reconhece que essa obra é a melhor que se podia fazer. Mas ao ir escrever uma obra, saber de antemão que ela tem de ser imperfeita e falhada; ao está-la escrevendo estar vendo que ela é imperfeita e falhada — isto é o máximo da tortura e da humilhação do espírito. Não só os versos que escrevo sinto que me não satisfazem, mas sei que os versos que estou para escrever me não satisfarão, também. Sei-o tanto filosoficamente, como carnalmente, por uma entrevisão obscura e gladiolada.","Doing a work and recognizing it as bad after it is done is one of the tragedies of the soul. It is especially great when one recognizes that this work is the best that could be done. But when going to write a work, know in advance that it has to be imperfect and flawed; when you are writing it, you are seeing that it is imperfect and flawed—this is the height of torture and humiliation of the spirit. Not only do the lines I write feel like they don't satisfy me, but I know the lines I'm about to write won't satisfy me either. I know it both philosophically and carnally, through an obscure and gladiolated vision.","Clouds … Today they are everything, dismantled fragments of heaven, the only real things between the empty earth and the nonexistent sky, indescribable scraps of a tedium I impose on them, mist condensed into bland threats, soiled tufts of cotton wool in a hospital without walls. Clouds … They are, like me, a ruined road between sky and earth, at the mercy of some invisible impulse, they may or may not thunder, they gladden the earth with their whiteness, sadden it with their darkness, fictions born of empty intervals and aimless meanderings, remote from earthly noises, but lacking the silence of the sky. Clouds … They continue to drift past, on and on, as they always will, like a constantly interrupted winding and unwinding of dull yarns, the diffuse prolongation of a false, fragmented sky. 326 [after 18 Oct 1931] I enjoy using words.","One of the soul’s great tragedies is to execute a work and then realize, once it’s finished, that it’s not any good. The tragedy is especially great when one realizes that the work is the best he could have done. But to write a work, knowing beforehand that it’s bound to be flawed and imperfect; to see while writing it that it’s flawed and imperfect – this is the height of spiritual torture and humiliation. Not only am I dissatisfied with the poems I write now; I also know that I’ll be dissatisfied with the poems I write in the future. I know it philosophically and in my flesh, through a hazy, gladiolated* foreglimpse."
"= Sim, sim… É a minha vez de pedir perdão… Mas olhe que eu estava distraída e não reparei realmente em que tinha dito uma coisa justa… Mudemos de assunto… Que tarde que é sempre!… Não se torne a zangar… Olhe que esta minha frase não tem sentido absolutamente nenhum…","= Yes, yes… It's my turn to ask for forgiveness… But look, I was distracted and I didn't really notice that I had said a fair thing… Let's change the subject… What an afternoon it always is!… Don't get angry again… Look at that This sentence of mine makes absolutely no sense...","Everything I see is, for me, the purely visible, be it the vast blue, green-tinged sky of the coming morning, be it the false grimace of pain on the face of someone watching the death of a loved one and aware that he is being watched.","= You’re right… Now it’s my turn to ask forgiveness… But I was distracted and really didn’t notice that I’d said something that makes sense… Let’s change the subject… How late it always is!… Don’t get upset again – the sentence I just said, after all, is complete nonsense…"
"A delícia de se ver compreendido, não a pode ter quem se quer ver compreendido, porque só aos complexos e incompreendidos isso acontece; e os outros, os simples, aqueles que os outros podem compreender — esses nunca têm o desejo de serem compreendidos.","The delight of seeing oneself understood cannot be had by those who want to see themselves understood, because this happens only to complex and misunderstood people; and the others, the simple, those whom others can understand—these never have the desire to be understood.","The others are just part of the landscape for us, usually the invisible landscape of a familiar street.","The joy of being understood by others cannot be had by those who want to be understood, for they are too complex to be understood; and simple people, who can be understood by others, never have the desire to be understood."
"Por mais amigo, e verdadeiramente amigo, que eu seja de alguém, o saber que ele está doente, ou que morreu, não me dá mais que uma impressão vaga, incerta, apagada, que me envergonho de sentir. Só a visão directa do caso, a sua paisagem, me daria emoção. À força de viver de imaginar, gasta-se o poder de imaginar, sobretudo o de imaginar o real. Vivendo mentalmente do que não há nem pode haver, acabamos por não poder cismar o que pode haver.","No matter how friend, and truly friend, I am to someone, knowing that he is sick, or that he has died, gives me nothing more than a vague, uncertain, faded impression, which I am ashamed to feel. Just the direct view of the case, its landscape, would give me emotion. By dint of living on imagining, the power of imagining is spent, especially that of imagining the real. Mentally living on what there is and cannot be, we end up not being able to think about what there can be.","However good or genuine a friend I might be to someone, hearing that he is ill or has died leaves me with such a vague, uncertain, dull impression that I’m ashamed to feel it. Only seeing the event itself, finding its landscape laid out before me, would move me. Living so much on one’s imagination actually erodes one’s ability to imagine, especially one’s ability to imagine the real. Living mentally on what is not and cannot be, we are, in the end, unable even to ponder what might really be.","However much and however sincerely I may be someone’s friend, the news that he is sick or that he died produces in me only a vague, indefinite, dull impression, which it embarrasses me to feel. Only direct contact, the actual scene, would kindle my emotion. When we live by the imagination, we exhaust our capacity for imagining, and especially for imagining what’s real. Mentally living off what doesn’t and can never exist, we lose our ability to ponder what can exist."
II,II,"The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.",II
"Será que o meu hábito de me colocar na alma dos outros, me leva a ver-me como os outros me vêem, ou me veriam se em mim reparassem? Sim. E uma vez eu perceba como eles sentiriam a meu respeito se me conhecessem, é como se eles o sentissem na verdade, o estivessem sentindo, e sentindo-o, exprimindo-o naquele momento. Conviver com os outros é uma tortura para mim. E eu tenho os outros em mim. Mesmo longe deles sou forçado ao seu convívio. Sozinho, multidões me cercam. Não tenho para onde fugir a não ser que fuja de mim.","Does my habit of putting myself in the souls of others lead me to see myself as others see me, or would they see me if they noticed me? Yes. And once I see how they would feel about me if they knew me, it's like they actually feel it, they're feeling it, and feeling it, expressing it in that moment. Living with others is torture for me. And I have the others in me. Even far from them I am forced to live with them. Alone, crowds surround me. I have nowhere to run unless you run away from me.",,"I don’t speak the language of any reality, and I stagger among the things of life like a sick man who finally got up after being bedridden for months. Only in bed do I feel like part of normal life. It pleases me to get a fever, since it seems perfectly natural to my recumbent state. Like a flame in the wind I flutter and get dizzy. Only in the dead air of closed rooms do I breathe the normality of my life. I don’t even miss the ocean breeze. I’ve become resigned to having my soul for a cloister and to being no more to myself than an autumn in an arid expanse, with only a glimmer of living life, as of a light which expires in the canopied darkness of pools, with no energy and colour but that of the violet splendour of exile when the sun dips behind the hills…"
"Para além destas coisas do mundo profano, há, é certo, as lições secretas das ordens iniciáticas, os mistérios declarados2, quando secretos, ou velados, quando os figuram ritos públicos. Há o que está oculto ou meio oculto nos grandes ritos católicos, seja no Ritual de Maria na Igreja Romana, seja a Cerimónia do Espírito na Franco-Maçonaria.","In addition to these things of the profane world, there are, of course, the secret lessons of the initiatory orders, the declared mysteries2, when secret, or veiled, when public rites appear. There is what is hidden or half-hidden in the great Catholic rites, whether in the Rite of Mary in the Roman Church or the Ceremony of the Spirit in Freemasonry.","There are some deep-seated griefs so subtle and pervasive that it is difficult to grasp whether they belong to our soul or to our body, whether they come from a malaise brought on by pondering the futility of life, or whether they are caused rather by an indisposition in some chasm within ourselves — stomach, liver or brain.","Besides these lessons from the profane world, there are, of course, the secret teachings of esoteric orders, the mysteries that are freely acknowledged but kept strictly secret, and the veiled mysteries embodied in public rites. There are things hidden, or half hidden, in great universal rites such as the Marian Ritual of the Roman Church, or the Freemasons’ Ceremony of the Spirit."

"O Tejo ao fundo é um lago azul, e os montes da Outra Banda são de uma Suíça achatada. Sai um navio pequeno — vapor de carga preto — dos lados do Poço do Bispo para a barra que não vejo.

"Considero o verso como uma coisa intermédia, uma passagem da música para a prosa. Como a música, o verso é limitado por leis rítmicas, que, ainda que não sejam as leis rígidas do verso regular, existem todavia como resguardos, coacções, dispositivos automáticos de opressão e castigo. Na prosa falamos livres. Podemos incluir ritmos musicais, e contudo pensar. Podemos incluir ritmos poéticos, e contudo estar fora deles. Um ritmo ocasional de verso não estorva a prosa; um ritmo ocasional de prosa faz tropeçar o verso.","I consider verse to be something in between, a passage from music to prose. Like music, verse is limited by rhythmic laws, which, although not the rigid laws of regular verse, nevertheless exist as safeguards, coercion, automatic devices of oppression and punishment. In prose we speak freely. We can include musical rhythms, and yet think. We can include poetic rhythms, and yet be outside of them. An occasional rhythm of verse does not hamper the prose; an occasional rhythm of prose trips the verse.","I consider poetry to be an intermediate thing, a transitional stage between music and prose.

An occasional poetic rhythm does not get in the way of prose, but an occasional prosaic rhythm can cause poetry to stumble.","I consider poetry to be an intermediate stage between music and prose.

"Esperar? Que tenho eu que espere? O dia não me promete mais que o dia, e eu sei que ele tem decurso e fim. A luz anima-me mas não me melhora, que sairei de aqui como para aqui vim4 — mais velho em horas, mais alegre uma sensação, mais triste um pensamento. No que nasce tanto podemos sentir o que nasce como pensar o que há-de morrer. Agora, à luz ampla e alta, a paisagem da cidade é como de um campo de casas — é natural, é extensa, é combinada. Mas, ainda no ver disto tudo, poderei eu esquecer que existo? A minha consciência da cidade é, por dentro, a minha consciência de mim.","Wait? What have I to wait for? The day promises me no more than the day, and I know it has a course and an end. The light cheers me up but doesn't improve me, that I'll leave here as I came here4 — older in hours, happier a feeling, sadder a thought. In what is born, we can both feel what is born and think about what will die. Now, in the wide, high light, the cityscape is like a field of houses—it's natural, it's extensive, it's combined. But, not yet seeing all this, can I forget that I exist? My awareness of the city is, inside, my awareness of myself.","Hope? What have I got to hope for? The only promise the day holds for me is that it will be just another day with a fixed course to run and a conclusion.

Whenever something is being born one can as easily concentrate on the fact of its birth as imagine its inevitable death. Now, in the strong, generous sunlight, the city landscape looks like a field of houses — broad, natural and orderly. But, even as I see all this, can I really forget my own existence? Deep down, my consciousness of the city is my consciousness of myself .","Hope? What do I have to hope for?

"Começou, então, nas almas recentes aquela doença a que se chamou romantismo, aquele cristianismo sem ilusões, aquele cristianismo sem mitos, que é a própria secura da sua essência doentia.","Then, in recent souls, that disease that was called romanticism began, that Christianity without illusions, that Christianity without myths, which is the very dryness of its unhealthy essence.","An over-curious analysis of sensations — sometimes purely imaginary — the identification of the heart with the landscape, the anatomical laying bare of the nerves, replacing will with desire and thought with aspiration — all these things are too familiar to seem novel in someone else’s words or to bring me peace.","In recent times, souls contracted a sickness known as Romanticism, which is Christianity without illusions or myths, stripped to its withered and diseased essence."
Assim nasceu uma literatura e uma arte feitas dos elementos secundários do pensamento — o romantismo; e uma vida social feita dos elementos secundários da actividade — a democracia moderna.,Thus was born a literature and an art made up of the secondary elements of thought—romanticism; and a social life made up of the secondary elements of activity—modern democracy.,"The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","Thus was born a literature and art made of the lower elements of thought – Romanticism. And with it, a social life made of the lower elements of action – modern democracy."
"Deixei abertas as portas da janela, para despertar cedo, mas até agora, e a noite é já tão velha que nada se ouve, não pude deixar-me ao sono nem estar desperto bem. Um luar está para além das sombras do meu quarto, mas não passa pela janela.

It is just there, like a day of hollow silver, and the roofs of the building opposite, which I can see from my bed, are liquid with inky whiteness.

"Um dos malefícios de pensar é ver quando se está pensando. Os que pensam com o raciocínio estão distraídos, os que pensam com a emoção estão dormindo, os que pensam com a vontade estão mortos.

Those who think with reason are distracted, those who think with emotion are asleep, those who think with will are dead.

"A visão de ti seria o leito onde a minha alma adormecesse, criança doente, para sonhar outra vez com outro céu. Falares?

"Nos espíritos a que chamam calculistas — e a palavra é muito bem delineada —, os sentimentos sofrem a delimitação do cálculo, do escrúpulo egoísta, e parecem outros. Nos espíritos a que chamam propriamente escrupulosos, a mesma deslocação dos instintos naturais se nota. Em mim nota-se igual perturbação da certeza do sentimento, mas nem sou calculista nem sou escrupuloso. Não tenho desculpa para sentir mal. Por instinto desnaturo os instintos. Sem querer, quero erradamente.","In the spirits that they call calculating — and the word is very well delineated — feelings suffer the delimitation of calculation, of selfish scruples, and seem different. In the spirits that are properly called scrupulous, the same displacement of natural instincts is noticeable. In me there is the same disturbance of the certainty of feeling, but I am neither calculating nor scrupulous. I have no excuse to feel bad. By instinct I denature instincts. Unintentionally, I want it wrongly.","I lived among them as a spy and no one, not even I, suspected.","In what is very aptly called a calculating personality, feelings are shaped by calculation and a kind of scrupulous self-interest to the point that they seem like something else. In what is specifically known as a scrupulous personality, the same displacement of natural instincts can be observed. In me there is a similar disturbance, a lack of clarity in my feelings, yet I am neither calculating nor scrupulous. I have no excuse for feeling things abnormally. I instinctively denature my instincts. Against my will, I will in the wrong way."
"Nunca senti tanta simpatia pelos inferiores da glória pública como quando os vi malsinar por estes inferiores sem querer essa pobre glória. Reconheci a razão do triunfo porque os párias do Grande triunfavam em relação a estes, e não em relação à humanidade.",I never felt so much sympathy for the inferiors of public glory as when I saw them curse these inferiors without wanting that poor glory. I recognized the reason for the triumph because the Great's outcasts triumphed over them and not over humanity.,"Or else I’ll be interned in a poorhouse, content with my utter failure, mingling with the riff-raff who believed they were geniuses when in fact they were just beggars with dreams, mixing with the anonymous mass of people who had neither the strength to triumph nor the power to turn their defeats into victories.",I’ve never felt so much sympathy for the minor figures of public glory as when I saw them vilified by these minor men who grudge them their petty glory. I understood then why the pariahs of Greatness are able to triumph: because they triumph in relation to these men and not in relation to humanity.
"Vagueio indefinidamente nas ruas sossegadas, ando até cansar o corpo em acordo com a alma, dói-me até aquele extremo da dor conhecida que tem um gozo em sentir-se, uma compaixão materna por si-mesma, que é musicada e indefinível.","I wander indefinitely in the quiet streets, I walk until my body wears out in agreement with my soul, it hurts me to that extreme of known pain that has a joy in feeling, a maternal compassion for itself, which is set to music and indefinable.","[1930?] … and gazing down from these majestic dream-heights, here am I, an assistant bookkeeper in the city of Lisbon. Far from feeling crushed by this comparison, I feel liberated; indeed, the irony of it all is my life’s blood. The very thing I ought to find humiliating has become my standard, which I proudly unfurl; and the mocking laughter with which I ought to greet my own thoughts is a bugle with which I welcome and create the aurora I have become.","I haphazardly roam the calm streets, walking until my body is as tired as my soul, grieved to the point of that old and familiar grief that likes to be felt, pitying itself with an indefinable, maternal compassion set to music."

"Daí a insistência do persa no uso do vinho. Bebe! Bebe! é toda a sua filosofia prática. Não é o beber da alegria, que bebe porque mais se alegre, porque mais seja ela mesma. Não é o beber do desespero, que bebe para esquecer, para ser menos ele mesmo. Ao vinho junta a alegria a acção e o amor; e há que reparar que não há em Khayyam nota alguma de energia, nenhuma frase de amor. Aquela Sàki, cuja figura grácil entrevista surge (mas surge pouco) nos rubaiyat, não é senão a “rapariga que serve o vinho”. O poeta é grato à sua esbelteza como o fora à esbelteza da ânfora, onde o vinho se contivesse.","Hence the Persian insistence on the use of wine. Baby! Baby! it's his whole practical philosophy. It is not the drinking of joy, which drinks because it is more joyful, because it is more itself. It is not the drinking of despair, which drinks to forget, to be less himself. To wine joins joy, action and love; and it must be noted that in Khayyam there is no note of energy, no phrase of love. That Sàki, whose graceful figure appears (but rarely appears) in the rubaiyat, is nothing but the “girl who serves the wine”. The poet is as grateful to his slenderness as he was to the slenderness of the amphora, where the wine was contained.","There are some deep-seated griefs so subtle and pervasive that it is difficult to grasp whether they belong to our soul or to our body, whether they come from a malaise brought on by pondering the futility of life, or whether they are caused rather by an indisposition in some chasm within ourselves — stomach, liver or brain.","That’s why the Persian insists on the use of wine. ‘Drink! Drink!’ sums up his practical philosophy. It’s not the kind of drinking inspired by happiness, which drinks to become even happier, more itself. Nor is it the drinking inspired by despair, which drinks to forget, to be less itself. Happiness adds vigour and love to the wine, and in Khayyám we find no note of energy, no words of love. The wispy, gracile figure of Sáki appears only occasionally in the Rubáiyát, and she is merely ‘the girl who serves the wine’. The poet appreciates her elegant shape as he appreciated the shape of the amphora containing the wine."

"O sócio capitalista aqui da firma, sempre doente em parte incerta, quis, não sei por que capricho de que intervalo de doença, ter um retrato do conjunto do pessoal do escritório. E assim, anteontem, alinhámos todos, por indicação do fotógrafo alegre, contra a barreira branca suja que divide, com madeira frágil, o escritório geral do gabinete do patrão Vasques. Ao centro o mesmo Vasques; nas duas alas, numa distribuição primeiro definida, depois indefinida, de categorias, as outras almas humanas que aqui se reúnem em corpo todos os dias para pequenos fins cujo último intuito só o segredo dos Deuses conhece.","The capitalist partner here at the firm, always ill in an uncertain part, wanted, I don't know on what whim during what period of illness, to have a portrait of the office's staff as a whole.

So, the day before yesterday, following the instructions of the jolly photographer, we all lined up against the grubby white partition that serves as a rickety wooden division between the general office and Senhor Vasques’ office. In the center stood Vasques himself; on either side of him, according to a hierarchy that began logically enough but rapidly broke down, stood the other human souls who gather here each day, in body, to perform the small tasks, the ultimate aim of which is a secret known only to the gods.","The firm’s monied partner, chronically afflicted by a vague illness, decided on a whim during one of his healthy respites to have a group portrait made of the office personnel. And so the day before yesterday a cheerful photographer lined us all up against the grimy white partition, made of flimsy wood, that divides the main office from the private one of Senhor Vasques. In the middle was Vasques himself; flanking him in a definite, then indefinite, ranking by category were the other human souls that daily come together here as one body to accomplish small tasks whose ultimate objective is the secret of the Gods."
"Sim, se eu tivesse sido rico, resguardado, escovado, ornamental, não teria sido nem esse breve episódio de papel bonito entre migalhas; teria ficado num prato da sorte — “não, muito obrigado” — e recolheria ao aparador para envelhecer.

So, rejected after eating my practical brains, I go with the dust of what remains of the body of Christ to the dustbin, and I can't even imagine what follows, and between what stars; but always follow.","I write, or rather scribble, these lines not in order to say anything in particular but to give my distraction something to do. With the soft marks made by a blunt pencil I haven’t the heart to sharpen, I slowly fill the white paper the café uses to wrap up sandwiches (and which they provided me with because I required nothing better and anything would have done, as long as it was white). And I feel content.","Yes, if I’d been wealthy, shielded, spruce, ornamental, I wouldn’t even have been this brief episode of pretty paper among crumbs; I would have remained on a lucky dish – ‘Thank you but no’ – and have retreated to the sideboard to grow old.

"Não durmo. Entresou. Tenho vestígios na consciência. Pesa em mim o sono sem que a inconsciência pese… Não sou. O vento… Acordo e redurmo e ainda não dormi. Há uma paisagem de som alto e torvo para além de que me desconheço. Gozo, recatado, a possibilidade de dormir. Com efeito durmo, mas não sei se durmo.

Sleep weighs on me without unconsciousness weighing me down… I'm not. The wind… I wake up and go to sleep and still haven't slept. There is a landscape of loud and noisy sound beyond which I don't know myself. I enjoy, demurely, the possibility of sleeping. In fact I sleep, but I don't know if I sleep. There is always, in what I think is sleep, a sound of the end of everything, the wind in the dark, and, if I still listen, the sound with me of the lungs and the heart.","novelty and there’s the boredom of the eternally new, and the latter brings about the death of the former. The truly wise man could enjoy the whole spectacle of the world from his armchair; he wouldn’t need to talk to anyone or to know how to read, just how to make use of his five senses and a soul innocent of sadness. One must monotonize existence in order to rid it of monotony. One must make the everyday so anodyne that the slightest incident proves entertaining. In the midst of my day-to-day work, dull, repetitive and pointless, visions of escape surface in me, vestiges of dreams of far-off islands, parties held in the avenues of gardens in some other age, different landscapes, different feelings, a different me. But, between balance sheets, I realize that if I had all that, none of it would be mine.","I don’t sleep. I interexist. * A few vestiges of consciousness persist. I feel the weight of slumber but not of unconsciousness. I don’t exist. The wind… I wake up and go back to sleep without yet having slept.

In what seems to me like a slumber there is always a sound of the end of all things, the wind in the darkness, and, if I listen closely, the sound of my own lungs and heart."

It doesn’t matter a jot, apart from the hope that everything is nothing and, therefore, that nothing is everything. 430 [c. 29 June 1934] Inaction is our consolation for everything, not acting our one great provider. The ability to imagine is all, as long as it does not lead to action. No one can be king of the world except in dreams. And, if we are honest, each of us wants to be king of the world. Not to be, but to think, that is the true throne. Not to want, but to desire, that is the crown. Whatever we renounce we preserve intact in our dreams, eternally bathed in the sun that does not exist or the moon that will never exist.","What’s the point of knowing that in the sun or in the rain, as a body or a soul, I will also pass on? No point – just the hope that everything is nothing and nothing, therefore, everything."
"Seria interessante poder ser dois reis ao mesmo tempo: ser não a uma alma de eles dois, mas as duas almas.","It would be interesting to be able to be two kings at the same time: to be not the one soul of the two of them, but the two souls.","For most people life is a bore that is over before they realize it, a sad business interspersed by a few happy interludes, rather like the anecdotes told by people watching over the dead in order to pass the still night and complete their vigil.","It would be interesting to be two kings at the same time: not the one soul of them both, but two distinct, kingly souls."
"Na mocidade somos dois: há em nós a coexistência da nossa inteligência própria, que pode ser grande, e a da estupidez da nossa inexperiência, que forma uma segunda inteligência inferior.

Only when we reach another age does unification take place in us. Hence the ever frustrated action of youth—due not to their inexperience, but to their non-unity.","In my walking meditation, all the thoughts that have made men live, all the emotions that men have allowed to exist, passed through my mind like an obscure summary of history. I suffered in myself, with myself, the aspirations of every era and all the unrest of all time strolled alongside me by the thunderous shore. What men wanted to do but did not and what they destroyed in so doing, what became of their souls and was never spoken of — all that formed part of the sensitive soul accompanying me along the night shore.","In youth we’re twofold. Our innate intelligence, which may be considerable, coexists with the stupidity of our inexperience, which forms a second, lesser intelligence. Only later on do the two unite. That’s why youth always blunders – not because of its inexperience, but because of its non-unity."

Pela Morte vivemos quando sonhamos, porque sonhar é negar a vida. Pela morte morremos quando vivemos, porque viver é negar a eternidade! A Morte nos guia, a morte nos busca, a morte nos acompanha. Tudo o que temos é morte, tudo o que queremos é morte, é morte tudo o que desejamos querer.","Through death we live, because we are only today because we died to yesterday. We wait for death, because we can only believe in tomorrow by trusting in the death of today. Through Death we live when we dream, because to dream is to deny life.

"Quase sem o sabermos morde-nos uma simpatia ancestral pela magia negra, pelas formas proibidas da ciência transcendente, pelos Senhores do Poder que se venderam à Condenação e à Reencarnação degradada. Os nossos olhos de débeis e de incertos perdem-se, com um cio feminino, na teoria dos graus invertidos, nos ritos inversos, na curva sinistra da hierarquia descendente.","Almost without knowing it, an ancestral sympathy bites us for black magic, for the forbidden forms of transcendent science, for the Lords of Power who sold themselves to Condemnation and degraded Reincarnation. Our weak and uncertain eyes are lost, with a feminine heat, in the theory of inverted degrees, in inverse rites, in the sinister curve of the descending hierarchy.",,With each passing day the presence of others – which my soul always receives like a rude surprise – becomes more painful and distressing.
"J.-J. Rousseau é o homem moderno, mas mais completo que qualquer homem moderno. Das fraquezas que o fizeram falir tirou — ai dele e de nós! — as forças que o fizeram triunfar. O que partiu dele venceu, mas nos lábaros da sua vitória, quando entrou na cidade, viu-se que estava escrita, em baixo, a palavra “Derrota”. No que dele ficou para trás, incapaz do esforço de vencer, foram as coroas e os ceptros, a majestade de mandar e a glória de vencer por destino interno.","J.-J. Rousseau is the modern man, but more complete than any modern man. From the weaknesses that made him bankrupt he took — woe to him and to us! — the forces that made him triumph. What came from him won, but on the lips of his victory, when he entered the city, it was seen that the word “Defeat” was written at the bottom. In what was left of him, incapable of the effort to win, were crowns and scepters, the majesty of ruling and the glory of winning by internal destiny.","The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","His intelligence served only to bemoan the tragedy of coexisting with such a sensibility. Rousseau is the modern man, but more complete than any modern man. From the weaknesses that made him fail, he extracted – alas for him and for us! – the forces that made him triumph. The part of him that went forward conquered, but when he entered the city, the word ‘Defeat’ could be read at the bottom of his victory banners. And in the part of him that stayed behind, incapable of fighting to conquer, there were crowns and sceptres, a ruler’s majesty and a conqueror’s glory – his legitimate inner destiny."

"Busco-me e não me encontro. Pertenço a horas crisântemos, nítidas em alongamentos de jarros. Deus fez da minha alma uma coisa decorativa.","I look for myself and I can't find myself. I belong to chrysanthemum hours, sharp in elongated jugs. God made my soul a decorative thing.","I only get tired when I think. When I look out at the street or I feel it, then I don’t think: I do my work with a great sense of inner repose, usefully filling my corner of the office, a clerical nobody. I have no soul, no one does — here it’s all work, work, work. Far off, doubtless in some foreign place, where the millionaires swan around, there is work too, and, as here, no souls either.","I seek and don’t find myself. I belong to chrysanthemum hours, neatly lined up in flowerpots. God made my soul to be a decorative object."
"Leves, entre os sulcos que havia na erva, porque os passos abriam nadas entre o verdor agitado, as passagens dos últimos perdidos soavam arrastadamente, como reminiscências do vindouro. Eram velhos os que haveriam de vir, e só novos os que não viriam nunca. Os tambores rolaram à beira da estrada e os clarins pendiam nulos nas mãos lassas, que os deixariam se ainda tivessem força para deixar qualquer coisa.","Light, between the furrows that were in the grass, because the footsteps opened nothing among the agitated green, the passages of the last lost ones sounded dragged, like reminiscences of the future. Those who would come were old, and only those who would never come were new. The drums rolled by the side of the road and the bugles dangled void in the limp hands that would have left them if they still had the strength to leave anything.","I hear the sound of slippers walking down an absurd corridor that leads straight to my heart. And with an abrupt gesture, like someone at last finding the resolve to kill himself, I throw off the heavy bedclothes that shelter my stiff body. I’m awake. Somewhere outside, the sound of the rain moves farther off.","Over the furrows in the grass, like remembrances of what was to come, the treading of the last lost men sounded ever so lightly, their dragging steps opening nothings in the restless greenery. Those who would come were bound to be old, and only the young would never arrive. The drums rumbled on the roadside, and the bugles hung uselessly from exhausted arms that would have dropped them if they still had strength enough to drop something."

Sim, é o princípio do outono, e o conhecimento claro, na hora límpida, da insuficiência anónima de tudo. O outono, sim, o outono, o que há ou o que vai haver, e o cansaço antecipado de todos os gestos, a desilusão antecipada de todos os sonhos. Que posso eu esperar e de quê?

Autumn, yes, autumn, what is or what will be, and the anticipated weariness of all gestures, the anticipated disillusionment of all dreams. What can I expect and from what? Now, in what I think of myself, I go among the leaves and dust of the atrium, in the meaningless orbit of nothing, making the sound of life on the clean slabs that an angular sun gilds at the end I don't know where.","My heart aches as if it were not mine. My brain lulls to sleep everything I feel. Yes, it is the beginning of autumn that touches both the air and my soul with the same unsmiling light that edges with dull yellow the hazy contours of the few clouds at sunset. Yes, it is the beginning of autumn and, in this limpid hour, the beginning of a clear understanding of the anonymous inadequacy of all things. The autumn, yes, the autumn, as it is and always will be: an anticipation of weariness in every gesture, of disillusionment with every dream. What possible hopes can I have? In my thoughts, I already walk among the leaves and dust of the atrium, caught up in this senseless orbit around nothing, my footsteps the only human sound on the clean flagstones that an angular sun — from where I know not — burnishes with death.","My heart hurts me like a foreign body.

"Como, porém, sou eu, gozo um pouco o pouco que é imaginar-me esse outro.

Yes, soon he-I, under a vine or a tree, will eat twice as much as I know how to eat, drink twice as much as I dare to drink, laugh twice as much as I can think of laughing. Soon him, me now. Yes, one moment was another: I saw, lived, in others, this humble and human joy of existing like an animal in shirt sleeves. Great day that made me dream like this! It's all blue and sublime at the top like my ephemeral dream of being a health care clerk on I don't know what end-of-day vacation.","There is a touch of autumn in all one’s emotions and thoughts, or rather one feels like one of those early spring days when the air and sky seem more like autumn than spring, except, of course, that no leaves fall.","But since I am me, I merely take a little pleasure in the little that it is to imagine myself as that someone else. Yes, soon he-I, under a tree or bower, will eat twice what I can eat, drink twice what I dare drink, and laugh twice what I can conceive of laughing. Soon he, now I. Yes, for a moment I was someone else: in someone else I saw and lived this human and humble joy of existing as an animal in shirtsleeves. Great day that made me dream all this!

"Num carro eléctrico em marcha eu sei, por uma atitude constante e instantânea de análise, separar a ideia de carro da ideia de velocidade, separá-las de todo, até serem coisas-reais diversas.

E, cansado, se acaso quero o delírio da velocidade enorme, posso transportar a ideia para o Puro Imitar da Velocidade e a meu bom prazer aumentá-la ou diminuí-la, alargá-la para além de todas as velocidades possíveis de veículos comboios.","In an electric car in motion, I know, through a constant and instantaneous attitude of analysis, to separate the idea of a car from the idea of speed, to separate them completely, until they are different real-things. Afterwards, I can feel myself following not inside the car but inside its Mere-Speed. And, tired, if I want the delirium of enormous speed, I can transport the idea to the Pure Imitation of Speed and at my pleasure increase or decrease it, extend it beyond all possible speeds of convoys.","Some feelings are like dreams that pervade every corner of one’s spirit like a mist, that do not let one think or act or even be.","On a tram in motion I’m able, through my constant and instantaneous analysis, to separate the idea of the tram from the idea of speed, separating them so completely that they’re distinct things-inreality.

"… reles como os fins da vida que vivemos, sem que queiramos nós tais fins.","… as paltry as the ends of the life we live, without our wanting such ends.","Today, as I note down these few impressions in a legitimate break brought about by a shortage of work, I am the person carefully transcribing them, the person who is pleased not to have to work just now, the person who looks at the sky even though he can’t actually see it from here, the person who is thinking all this, and the person feeling physically at ease and noticing that his hands are still slightly cold.","… contemptible like the aims we live for, without our having chosen those aims."

"Outras vezes será um certo doce. Um simples bombom de chocolate escangalha-me às vezes os nervos com o excesso de recordações que os estremece. A infância! E entre os meus dentes que se cravam na massa escura e macia, trinco e gosto as minhas humildes felicidades de companheiro alegre de soldados de chumbo, de cavaleiro congruente com a cana casual meu cavalo. Sobem-me as lágrimas aos olhos e junto com o sabor do chocolate mistura-se ao meu sabor a minha felicidade passada, a minha infância ida, e pertenço voluptuosamente à suavidade da minha dor.","Other times it will be a certain sweet. A simple chocolate candy sometimes breaks my nerves with the excess of memories that shake them. The childhood! And between my teeth that sink into the dark and soft mass, I click and enjoy my humble happiness as a cheerful companion of tin soldiers, as a knight congruent with the casual cane of my horse. Tears well up in my eyes and along with the taste of chocolate, my past happiness, my gone childhood, mingles with my taste, and I belong voluptuously to the softness of my pain.","There are ways of understanding that dictate the ways they are to be understood. It’s a suffocation of life in my own self, a desire in every pore of my being to be another person, a brief warning that the end is near. 409 [1932?] In what feels like my now distant adolescence — and because it feels so remote it seems to me like something I must have read about or a personal story someone once told me — I twice enjoyed the painful humiliation of loving.","At other times it’s a certain sweet. A mere piece of chocolate can shake up my nerves with the surfeit of memories it provokes. Childhood! And as my teeth sink into the dark, soft mass, I chew and savour my humble joys as the happy companion of my toy soldiers, as the knight in perfect accord with whatever stick happened to be serving as my horse. Tears well up in my eyes, and along with the flavour of the chocolate I can taste my bygone happiness, my long lost childhood, and I voluptuously bask in the sweetness of my sorrow."
"“Quero-te só para sonho”, dizem à mulher amada, em versos que lhe não enviam, os que não ousam dizer-lhe nada. Este “quero-te só para sonho” é um verso de um velho poema meu.

"A acção desorienta-nos, em parte por incompetência física, ainda mais por inapetência moral. Parece-nos imoral agir.

"O amor romântico, portanto, é um caminho de desilusão.

E como tem reparado, deve ter achado estranho que esse olhar, não sendo propriamente tímido, nunca esboçasse uma significação. Sempre atento, vago e o mesmo, como que contente de ser só a tristeza disso… Mais nada… E dentro do seu pensar nisso — seja o sentimento qual seja com que tem pensado em mim — deve ter perscrutado as minhas possíveis intenções.

Always attentive, vague and the same, as if content to be just the sadness of it... Nothing else...

A minor incident in the street brings the cook to the door and entertains him more than I would be entertained by contemplating the most original idea, by reading the greatest book, or by having the most gratifying of useless dreams. If life is basically monotony, he has escaped it more than I. And he escapes it more easily than I. The truth isn’t with him or with me, because it isn’t with anyone, but happiness does belong to him."

"“O amor, que me têm”, ela disse, “não tem paixão que consuma; ciúme que desvaire; esquecimento que deslustre. Amar-me é como uma noite de verão, quando os mendigos dormem ao relento, e parecem pedras13 à beira dos caminhos. Dos meus lábios mudos não vem canto como o das sereias, nem melodia como a das árvores e das fontes; mas o meu silêncio acolhe como uma música indecisa14, o meu sossego afaga como o torpor15 de uma brisa.”","“The love that they have for me,” she said, “has no passion to consume; jealousy that rages; oblivion that tarnishes. Loving me is like a summer night, when beggars sleep in the open, and look like stones13 by the wayside. From my mute lips comes no song like that of sirens, nor melody like that of trees and fountains; but my silence welcomes like an indecisive music14, my calm caresses like the torpor15 of a breeze.”",,"‘The love that souls have for me is free of the passion that consumes, of the jealousy that deranges, of the forgetfulness that tarnishes.

It would be nice if you thought of me sometimes.,,"Materially adding to it spiritually diminishes it. This attitude is no doubt responsible for my aversion to museums. The only museum for me is the whole of life, in which the picture is always absolutely accurate, with any inaccuracy being due to the spectator’s imperfection. I do what I can to reduce that imperfection, and if I can’t do anything, then I rest content with the way it is, because, like everything else, it can’t be any other way."

Strength without dexterity is simple mass.","Between myself, of little significance amongst the ranks of thinkers, and a peasant in Loures there is a greater distance than between that peasant and, I won’t say a monkey, but a cat or a dog. None of us, from the cat up, actually leads the life imposed on us or the fate given to us; we all derive from equally obscure origins, we are all shadows of gestures made by someone else, effects made flesh, consequences with feelings.","Thought can be lofty without being elegant, but to the extent it lacks elegance it will have less effect on others.

"As guerras e as revoluções — há sempre uma ou outra em curso1 — chegam, na leitura dos seus efeitos, a causar não horror mas tédio. Não é a crueldade de todos aqueles mortos e feridos, o sacrifício de todos os que morrem batendo-se, ou são mortos sem que se batam, que pesa duramente na alma: é a estupidez que sacrifica vidas e haveres a qualquer coisa inevitavelmente inútil. Todos os ideais e todas as ambições são um desvairo de comadres homens. Não há império que valha que por ele se parta uma boneca de criança. Não há ideal que mereça o sacrifício de um comboio de lata. Que império é útil ou que ideal profícuo? Tudo é humanidade, e a humanidade é sempre a mesma — variável mas inaperfeiçoável, oscilante mas improgressiva. Perante o curso inimplorável das coisas, a vida que tivemos sem saber como e perderemos sem saber quando, o jogo de dez mil xadrezes que é a vida em comum e luta, o tédio de contemplar sem utilidade o que se não realiza nunca ▢ — que pode fazer o sábio senão pedir o repouso, o não ter que pensar em viver, pois basta ter que viver, um pouco de lugar ao sol e ao ar2 e ao menos o sonho de que há paz do lado de lá dos montes.","Wars and revolutions — there are always one or the other going on1 — arrive, when reading their effects, to cause not horror but boredom. It is not the cruelty of all those killed and wounded, the sacrifice of all those who die by hitting each other, or are killed without hitting each other, that weighs heavily on the soul: it is stupidity that sacrifices lives and possessions to something inevitably useless. All ideals and all ambitions are a madness of male godparents. There is no empire worth breaking a child's doll for. There is no ideal that deserves the sacrifice of a tin train. What empire is useful or what fruitful ideal? Everything is humanity, and humanity is always the same—variable but unperfectable, fluctuating but unprogressive. In the face of the unbearable course of things, the life we had without knowing how and we will lose without knowing when, the game of ten thousand chess that is life in common and struggle, the tedium of contemplating uselessly what is never achieved ▢ — that what the wise can do but ask for rest, not having to think about living, because it is enough to have to live, a little place in the sun and air2 and at least the dream that there is peace on the other side of the mountains.","I think of us as climates constantly threatened by storms that always break somewhere else. The empty immensity of things, the great forgetting that fills sky and earth …","Reading about the effects of wars and revolutions – there’s always one or the other in the news* – doesn’t make us feel horror but tedium. What really disturbs our soul isn’t the cruel fate of all the dead and wounded, the sacrifice of all who die in action or who die without seeing action, but the stupidity that sacrifices lives and property to some inevitably futile cause. All ideals and all ambitions are a hysteria of prattling women posing as men. No empire justifies breaking a child’s doll. No ideal is worth the sacrifice of a toy train. What empire is useful or what ideal profitable? It’s all humanity, and humanity is always the same – variable but unimprovable, with fluctuations but unprogressive. Vis-à-vis the intransigent march of all things, the life that we were given without knowing why and that we’ll lose we don’t know when, the ten thousand chess games that constitute our life in common and in conflict, the tedium of uselessly contemplating what we’ll never accomplish ..... – vis-à-vis all that, what can the wise man do but ask to retire, to be excused from having to think about life (since living it is already burdensome enough), to have a little sun and fresh air and at least the dream that there’s peace on the other side of the hills?"

"Eu próprio não sei se este eu, que vos exponho, por estas coleantes páginas fora, realmente existe ou é apenas um conceito estético e falso que fiz de mim próprio. Sim, é assim. Vivo-me esteticamente em outro. Esculpi a minha vida como a uma estátua de matéria alheia a meu ser. Às vezes não me reconheço, tão exterior me pus a mim, e tão de modo puramente artístico empreguei a minha consciência de mim próprio. Quem sou por detrás desta irrealidade? Não sei. Devo ser alguém. E se não busco viver, agir, sentir, é — crede-me bem — para não perturbar as linhas feitas da minha personalidade suposta. Quero ser tal qual quis ser e não sou. Se eu cedesse destruir-me-ia. Quero ser uma obra de arte, da alma pelo menos, já que do corpo não posso ser. Por isso me esculpi em calma e alheamento e me pus em estufa, longe dos ares frescos e das luzes francas — onde a minha artificialidade, flor absurda2, floresça em afastada beleza.","I myself don't know if this self, which I'm exposing to you throughout these slithering pages, really exists or is just an aesthetic and false concept that I've made of myself. Yes, it is. I live aesthetically in another. I sculpted my life like a statue of matter alien to my being. Sometimes I don't recognize myself, I have become so outside of myself, and so purely artistically have I used my self-awareness. Who am I behind this unreality? I don't know. I must be somebody. And if I don't seek to live, act, feel, it's — believe me — so as not to disturb the sharp lines of my supposed personality. I want to be what I wanted to be and I'm not. If I gave in it would destroy myself. I want to be a work of art, of the soul at least, since I cannot be of the body. That's why I sculpted myself in calm and aloofness and put myself in a greenhouse, far from fresh air and open lights — where my artificiality, an absurd flower2, blooms in remote beauty.","I know that I’m walking down a street, but I’m not conscious of it comprising two sides made up of different houses built by human beings. I walk down a street. From a baker’s comes the almost sickeningly sweet smell of bread and from a district right on the other side of town my childhood rises up and another baker’s appears before me from that fairy kingdom which is everything we have lost. I walk down a street. Suddenly it smells of the fruit on the stand outside a narrow little shop, and my short time in the country — I no longer know when or where it was — plants trees and quiet comfort in my heart, for a moment indisputably that of a child. I walk down a street. I’m overcome, quite unexpectedly, by the smell of the wooden crates being made by the box-maker: ah, Cesário, you appear before me and at last I am happy because, through memory, I have returned to the one truth that is literature.","Not even I know if this I that I’m disclosing to you, in these meandering pages, actually exists or is but a fictitious, aesthetic concept I’ve made of myself. Yes, that’s right. I live aesthetically as someone else. I’ve sculpted my life like a statue made of matter that’s foreign to my being. Having employed my self-awareness in such a purely artistic way, and having become so completely external to myself, I sometimes no longer recognize myself. Who am I behind this unreality? I don’t know. I must be someone. And if I avoid living, acting and feeling, then believe me, it’s so as not to tamper with the contours of my invented personality. I want to be exactly like what I wanted to be and am not. If I were to give in to life, I’d be destroyed. I want to be a work of art, at least in my soul, since I can’t be one in my body. That’s why I’ve sculpted myself in quiet isolation and have placed myself in a hothouse, cut off from fresh air and direct light – where the absurd flower of my artificiality can blossom in secluded beauty."
"Ao toque de clarim desta frase simples a minha alma aliviou-se como se num céu de nuvens o vento de repente as afastasse. E então reconheci o que nunca claramente reconhecera, que nestes criados de café e de restaurante, nos barbeiros, nos moços de frete das esquinas, eu tenho uma simpatia espontânea, natural, que não posso orgulhar-me de receber dos que privam comigo em maior intimidade, impropriamente dita…","At the clarion call of this simple sentence, my soul was relieved as if in a cloudy sky the wind had suddenly blown them away. And then I recognized what I had never clearly recognized, that in these cafe and restaurant servants, in the barbers, in the street freight boys on the corners, I have a spontaneous, natural sympathy, which I cannot be proud of receiving from those who deprive me to a greater extent. intimacy, improperly said...","The tram was making its slow way to the avenues. As it approached the more densely built-up areas, he was gripped by a vague sense of loss. Human reality was beginning to stir. In those morning hours, when the shadows had vanished, but not as yet their light weight, the spirit that allows itself to be carried along by the impulse of the moment longs to arrive, and to arrive in the ancient, sunny port. What would cheer one up is not so much for this moment to remain fixed and forever, as when one gazes at a solemn landscape or at the moonlight shining serenely on the river, but for life to have been something else, so that this moment would have had for him a different, more recognizable savor. The uncertain mist was growing still thinner.","The trumpet blast of this simple phrase relieved my soul like a sudden wind clearing the sky of clouds. And I realized something I had never really thought about: with these café and restaurant waiters, with barbers and with the delivery boys on street corners I enjoy a natural, spontaneous rapport that I can’t say I have with those I supposedly know more intimately."

"Às vezes, nos meus diálogos comigo, nas tardes requintadas da Imaginação, em colóquios cansados em crepúsculos de salões supostos, pergunto-me, naqueles intervalos da conversa em que fico a sós com um interlocutor mais eu do que os outros, por que razão verdadeira não haverá a nossa época científica estendido a sua vontade de compreender até aos assuntos que são artificiais. E uma das perguntas em que com mais languidez me demoro é a por que se não faz, a par da psicologia usual das criaturas humanas e sub-humanas, uma psicologia também — que a deve haver — das figuras artificiais e das criaturas cuja existência se passa apenas nos tapetes e nos quadros. Triste noção tem da realidade quem a limita ao orgânico, e não põe a ideia de uma alma dentro das estatuetas e dos lavores. Onde há forma há alma.","Sometimes, in my conversations with myself, in the exquisite afternoons of Imagination, in tired conversations in the twilight of supposed salons, I ask myself, in those intervals of conversation when I am alone with an interlocutor more me than the others, why the real reason our scientific epoch will not extend its will to understand even to matters that are artificial. And one of the questions on which I languish most languidly is why, alongside the usual psychology of human and subhuman creatures, there is not also a psychology - which there must be - of artificial figures and of creatures whose existence is passes only on rugs and paintings. A sad notion of reality has those who limit it to the organic, and do not put the idea of a soul within the statuettes and works. Where there is form, there is soul.","How often, weighed down by a tedium that verges on madness, or an anguish that seems to go beyond all anguish, do I stop and hesitate before I rebel, do I hesitate and stop before making myself a god.","Sometimes, in my inner dialogues on exquisite afternoons of Imagination, as I carry on weary conversations in imaginary sitting rooms at twilight, it can happen during a lull in the discussion that, finding myself alone with an interlocutor who’s more I than the others, I start to wonder why our scientific age’s will to understand hasn’t been extended to artificial, inorganic things. And one of the questions that I most languidly ponder is why we don’t develop, along with the usual psychology of human and subhuman creatures, a psychology (for surely they have one) of artificial figures and of creatures whose existence takes place only in rugs and in pictures. It’s a sad view of reality that would limit it to the organic realm and not place the idea of soul in statuettes and needlework. Where there ’s form there ’s a soul."

In general, men weep little and, when they do complain, they make literature out of it. Pessimism is not really viable as a democratic formula. Those who bemoan the ills of the world are an isolated few — they are only bemoaning their own ills. If a Leopardi or an Antero de Quental has no beloved, no lover, then the universe is a terrible place.iii If Vigny feels unwell or unloved, the world is a prison. If Chateaubriand longs for the impossible, then human life is a bore. If Job is covered in boils, then the whole earth is covered in boils. If you tread on a sad man’s corns, then woe betide the feet of the sun and the stars. Indifferent to this, and grieving only as much as he needs to and for as little time as possible — over the death of a son, for example, whom he will forget as the years pass, except on his birthday; over the loss of money, which he mourns until he gets some more or becomes used to the loss — humanity continues digesting and loving. Life recovers and carries on. The dead are buried. Losses forgotten. 179 [1929?]","Future married couples pass by, chatting seamstresses pass by, young men in a hurry for pleasure pass by, those who have retired from everything smoke on their habitual stroll, and at one or another doorway a shopkeeper stands like an idle vagabond, hardly noticing a thing. Army recruits – some of them brawny, others slight – slowly drift along in noisy and worse-than-noisy clusters. Occasionally someone quite ordinary goes by. Cars at that time of day are rare, and their noise is musical. In my heart there’s a peaceful anguish, and my calm is made of resignation."
"Cuidarás primeiro em nada respeitar, em nada crer, em nada ▢. Guardarás da tua atitude ante o que não respeites, a vontade de respeitar alguma coisa; do teu desgosto ante o que não ames, o desejo doloroso de amar alguém; do teu desprezo pela vida guardarás a ideia de que deve ser bom vivê-la e amá-la. E assim terás construído os alicerces para o edifício dos teus sonhos.","First, you will be careful to respect nothing, to believe in nothing, to believe in nothing ▢. You will keep from your attitude towards what you do not respect, the will to respect something; from your displeasure at what you do not love, the painful desire to love someone; from your contempt for life you will keep the idea that it must be good to live and love it. And so you will have built the foundations for the building of your dreams.",,"Make sure, first of all, that you respect nothing, believe nothing, nothing. But while showing disrespect, you should hold on to the desire to respect something; while despising what you don’t love, you should retain the painful longing to love someone; and while disdaining life, you should preserve the idea that it must be wonderful to live and cherish it. Having done this, you’ll have laid the foundations for the edifice of your dreams."

"Perguntar-se-á talvez se faço minha a filosofia de Khayyam, tal como aqui, creio que com justeza, a escrevi de novo e interpreto. Responderei que não sei. Há dias em que essa me parece a melhor, e até a única, de todas as filosofias práticas. Há outros dias em que me parece nula, morta, inútil, como um copo vazio. Não me conheço, porque penso. Não sei pois o que verdadeiramente penso. Não seria assim se tivesse fé; mas também não seria assim se estivesse louco. Na verdade, se fosse outro seria outro.","One will perhaps ask whether I make Khayyam's philosophy my own, as here, I think rightly, I have written it again and interpreted it.

There are other days when it seems null, dead, useless, like an empty glass. I don't know myself, because I think. So I don't know what I really think. It would not be so if you had faith; but neither would it be so if he were mad. In fact, if it were someone else, it would be someone else.","There are some deep-seated griefs so subtle and pervasive that it is difficult to grasp whether they belong to our soul or to our body, whether they come from a malaise brought on by pondering the futility of life, or whether they are caused rather by an indisposition in some chasm within ourselves — stomach, liver or brain.","Some may wonder if I myself subscribe to the philosophy of Khayyám as restated and interpreted here (with fair accuracy, I believe). I would have to say that I don’t know. On certain days it seems to me the best, and even the only, practical philosophy there is. On other days it strikes me as void, dead and useless, like an empty glass. Because I think, I don’t know myself. And so I don’t know what I really think.

"Atrás dos primeiros menos-calores do estio findo vieram, nos acasos das tardes, certos coloridos mais brandos do céu amplo, certos retoques de brisa fria que anunciavam o outono. Não era ainda o desverde da folhagem, ou o desprenderem-se das folhas, nem aquela vaga angústia que acompanha a nossa sensação da morte externa, porque o há-de ser também a nossa. Era como um cansaço do esforço existente, um vago sono sobrevindo aos últimos gestos de agir. Ah, são tardes de uma tão magoada indiferença, que, antes que comece nas coisas, começa em nós o outono.","After the first lesser heats of the late summer came, in the afternoons, certain softer colors of the wide sky, certain touches of cold breeze that announced autumn. It was not yet the greening of the foliage, or the detachment of the leaves, nor that vague anguish that accompanies our sensation of external death, because ours will also be. It was like a tiredness of the existing effort, a vague sleep overcoming the last gestures of acting. Ah, these are afternoons of such wounded indifference that, before things begin, autumn begins in us.","[14 Sep 1931] The coming of autumn was announced in the aimless evenings by a certain softening of color in the ample sky, by the buffetings of a cold breeze that arose in the wake of the first cooler days of the dying summer. The trees had not yet lost their green or their leaves, nor was there yet that vague anguish which accompanies our awareness of any death in the external world simply because it reflects our own future death. It was as if what energy remained had grown weary so that a kind of slumber crept over any last attempts at action. Ah, these evenings are full of such painful indifference it is as if the autumn were beginning in us rather than in the world.","After the heat began to wane at summer’s end, it sometimes happened in late afternoon that certain softer hues in the broad sky and certain strokes of cold breezes already signalled the coming of autumn. There was still no discolouring or falling of leaves, nor yet that vague anxiety we naturally feel when we see death all around us, since we know ours will also come. But there was a sort of flagging of all effort, a vague slumber fallen over the last signs of action. Ah, with so much sad indifference in these afternoons, the autumn begins in us before it begins in things."
"A posse é para meu pensar1 uma lagoa absurda — muito grande, muito escura, muito pouco profunda.

The water looks deep because it's fake dirty.",,"And for a few tenuous moments I’m able to forget my taste for life, to bury the thought of daylight and bustle, and to consciously, absurdly terminate in my sensations, with an empire in agonizing ruins but also with a grand entrance amid victory banners and drums into a glorious final city where I would weep over nothing and desire nothing, asking no one – not even myself – for so much as the right to exist. It’s me who suffers from the sickly surfaces of the pools I’ve created in dreams."
"Da nascença à morte, o homem vive servo da mesma exterioridade de si mesmo que têm os animais. Toda a vida não vive, mas vegeta em maior grau e com mais complexidade. Guia-se por normas que não sabe que existem, nem que por elas se guia, e as suas ideias, os seus sentimentos, os seus actos, são todos inconscientes — não porque neles falte a consciência, mas porque neles não há duas consciências.","From birth to death, man lives a servant of the same exteriority of himself that animals have. All life does not live, but vegetates to a greater degree and with more complexity. He is guided by norms that he does not know exist, or that he is guided by them, and his ideas, his feelings, his actions are all unconscious – not because they lack conscience, but because there are not two consciences in them.","We can never disembark from ourselves. We can never become another person, except by making ourselves other through the sensitive application of our imaginations to our selves. The true landscapes are those that we ourselves create, because, since we are their gods, we see them as they really are, that is, exactly as they were created.","From birth to death, man is the slave of the same external dimension that rules animals. Throughout his life he doesn’t live, he vegetatively thrives, with greater intensity and complexity than an animal. He’s guided by norms without knowing that they guide him or even that they exist, and all his ideas, feelings and acts are unconscious – not because there’s no consciousness in them but because there aren’t two consciousnesses."
"Passou naturalmente, como o vento e o dia, levando consigo a alma, que o fizera diferente. Mergulhou na sombra como quem entra na porta onde chega.

He plunged into the shadows as one who enters the door where he arrives. He died for the Fatherland, the only thing superior to us of which we have knowledge and reason.

And the story tells that he became known in it as Sigismundo “super-grammaticam”. Wonderful symbol! Every man who knows how to say what he says is, in his own way, King of Rome. The title is not bad, and the soul is being itself2.","Only those who are unable to think what they feel obey grammatical rules.

Anyone who knows how to say what he wants to say is, in his own way, King of Rome. The title is regal and the reason for it impossible. 242","Let grammar rule the man who doesn’t know how to think what he feels. Let it serve those who are in command when they express themselves.

I imagined the mirror in my room, reflecting my poor, unpoor beggar’s face, and suddenly the mirror moved away, and the specter of Rua dos Douradores opened up before me like a nirvana for postmen. The intensity of my sensations is almost like a disease that’s quite separate from me. Someone else of whom I am the ailing part suffers from that disease, because I genuinely feel as though I were dependent on someone else’s greater capacity to feel. I am merely a special tissue, or even a cell, responsible for a whole organism.","For a long time now I haven’t written and haven’t even existed. I hardly even seem to be dreaming.

"Não é este o conceito dos pessimistas, como aquele de Vigny, para quem a vida é uma cadeia, onde ele tecia palha para se distrair.

Medito, então, em uma modorra de físico, que se parece com a volúpia apenas como o sussurro de vento lembra vozes, na eterna insaciabilidade dos meus desejos vagos, na perene instabilidade das minhas ânsias impossíveis. Sofro, principalmente, do mal de poder sofrer. Falta-me qualquer coisa que não desejo e sofro por isso não ser propriamente sofrer.","Sometimes I spend hours at Terreiro do Paço, by the river, meditating in vain. My impatience constantly wants to pull me out of that quiet, and my inertia constantly holds me back. I meditate, then, on a physical slumber, which resembles voluptuousness only as the whisper of the wind recalls voices, on the eternal insatiability of my vague desires, on the perennial instability of my impossible cravings. I suffer mainly from the evil of being able to suffer. I lack something that I don't want and I suffer because it's not really suffering.","Like a voice unleashed from the long peaceful line of the sea, the wave arches, crashes and dies, leaving behind the sound of its waters licking the invisible shore. How I die if I allow myself to feel for all things!","Sometimes I spend hours at the Terreiro do Paço,* next to the river, meditating in vain. My impatience keeps trying to tear me away from that peace, and my inertia keeps holding me there. And in this state of bodily torpor that suggests sensuality only in the way the wind’s whispering recalls voices, I meditate on the eternal insatiability of my vague desires, on the permanent fickleness of my impossible yearnings. I suffer mainly from the malady of being able to suffer. I’m missing something I don’t really want, and I suffer because this isn’t true suffering."

"O isolamento talhou-me à sua imagem e semelhança. A presença de outra pessoa — de uma só pessoa que seja — atrasa-me imediatamente o pensamento, e, ao passo que no homem normal o contacto com outrem é um estímulo para a expressão e para o dito, em mim esse contacto é um contra-estímulo, se é que esta palavra composta é viável perante a linguagem. Sou capaz, a sós comigo, de idear quantos ditos de espírito, respostas rápidas ao que ninguém disse, fulgurações de uma sociabilidade inteligente com pessoa nenhuma; mas tudo isso se me some se estou perante um outrem físico, perco a inteligência, deixo de poder dizer, e, no fim de uns quartos de hora, sinto apenas sono. Sim, falar com gente dá-me vontade de dormir. Só os meus amigos espectrais e imaginados, só as minhas conversas decorrentes em sonho, têm uma verdadeira realidade e um justo relevo, e neles o espírito é presente como uma imagem num espelho.","Isolation carved me in its image and likeness. The presence of another person - even a single person - immediately delays my thinking, and while in the normal man contact with another is a stimulus for expression and saying, in me this contact is a counter-measure. -stimulus, if this compound word is viable in the face of language. I am capable, alone with myself, of devising how many sayings of the spirit, quick answers to what no one has said, flashes of an intelligent sociability with no one; but all this adds up if I am facing a physical other, I lose my intelligence, I can no longer say, and, after a few quarters of an hour, I just feel sleepy. Yes, talking to people makes me want to sleep. Only my spectral and imagined friends, only my conversations arising in dreams, have a true reality and a fair relief, and in them the spirit is present like an image in a mirror.","The phrase still fills my whole soul, I rest every emotion I have on it, and the indecipherable peace of the harsh moonlight beginning to spread as night comes falls on me, in me, as it does on the city beyond.","Isolation has carved me in its image and likeness. The presence of another person – of any person whatsoever – instantly slows down my thinking, and while for a normal man contact with others is a stimulus to spoken expression and wit, for me it is a counterstimulus, if this compound word be linguistically permissible. When all by myself, I can think of all kinds of clever remarks, quick comebacks to what no one said, and flashes of witty sociability with nobody. But all of this vanishes when I face someone in the flesh: I lose my intelligence, I can no longer speak, and after half an hour I just feel tired. Yes, talking to people makes me feel like sleeping. Only my ghostly and imaginary friends, only the conversations I have in my dreams, are genuinely real and substantial, and in them intelligence gleams like an image in a mirror."
"E porque este livro é absurdo, eu o amo; porque é inútil, eu o quero dar; e porque de nada serve querer to dar, eu to dou…","And because this book is absurd, I love it; because it is useless, I want to give it; and because it's useless to want to give it to you, I give it to you...",,"Then life stops for me, and art grovels at my feet."

Let us watch Time paint the world and find the painting not only false but also empty.
"A minha figura humana, se a considerava com uma atenção externa, era do ridículo que tudo quanto é humano assume sempre que é íntimo. Vestira, sobre os trajes simples do sono abandonado, um sobretudo velho, que me serve para estas vigílias matutinas. Os meus chinelos velhos estavam rotos, principalmente o do pé esquerdo. E, com as mãos nos bolsos do casaco póstumo, eu fazia a avenida do meu quarto curto em passos largos e decididos, cumprindo com o devaneio inútil um sonho igual aos de toda a gente.","My human figure, if I considered it with an external attention, was ridiculous that everything that is human assumes whenever it is intimate. I had put on, over the simple clothes of abandoned sleep, an old overcoat, which I use for these morning vigils. My old slippers were broken, especially the one on my left foot. And, with my hands in the pockets of my posthumous coat, I walked the avenue of my short room with long, decisive strides, fulfilling with useless daydream a dream like everyone else's.","Seen from outside, my human figure appeared ridiculous in the way that everything human is when seen in private. Over the simple vestments of abandoned sleep I’d put on an ancient overcoat that I wear for these morning vigils. My old slippers, especially the left one, were badly split. And, with long decisive steps, my hands in the pockets of my posthumous coat, I walked the avenue of my small room, enjoying in those vain thoughts a dream much the same as everyone else’s.","Seen from the outside, my human figure was ridiculous like everything human in its intimacy. Over the pyjamas of my abandoned sleep I’d put on an old overcoat, habitually employed for these morning vigils. My old slippers were falling apart, especially the left one.

"E assim arrasto a fazer o que não quero, e a sonhar o que não posso ter, a minha vida ▢, absurda como um relógio público parado.","And so I drag, doing what I don't want, and dreaming what I can't have, my life ▢, absurd as a stopped public clock.","“All this is pure dream and phantasmagoria, and it matters little whether the dream is an entry in an accounts ledger or a piece of superb prose.”","And so I drag myself to do what I don’t want and to dream what I can’t have, my life....., as meaningless as a broken public clock."
"Com separar-me dos homens não me encontrei, nem ▢","With separating myself from men I have not found myself, nor ▢",,"O my life, futile as that of a shiftless vagabond who sleeps on the side of the road, in a fresh and transparent slumber, with the fragrance of the meadows entering his soul like a mist, profound and full of eternity like everything that’s not linked to anything, nocturnal, anonymous, nomadic and weary beneath the stars’ cold compassion."

"Comparados com os homens simples e autênticos, que passam pelas ruas da vida, com um destino natural e calhado, essas figuras dos cafés assumem um aspecto que não sei definir senão comparando-as a certos duendes de sonhos — figuras que não são de pesadelo nem de mágoa, mas cuja recordação, quando acordamos, nos deixa, sem que saibamos porquê, um sabor a um nojo passado, um desgosto de qualquer coisa que está com eles mas que se não pode definir como sendo deles.","Compared with the simple and authentic men, who pass through the streets of life, with a natural and chance destiny, these figures from the cafes take on an aspect that I cannot define except by comparing them to certain elves in dreams - figures that are neither from nightmares nor from dreams. of sorrow, but the memory of which, when we wake up, leaves us, without our knowing why, a taste of a past disgust, a displeasure of something that is with them but that cannot be defined as being theirs.","Perhaps because I am so sceptical about what is truly intelligible, I look with equal interest upon a tree and a face, a poster and a smile.","Compared with real, ordinary men who walk down the streets of life with a natural, fortuitous goal in mind, those who sit around in cafés cut a figure that can be described only by comparing them to certain elves from dreams – creatures that aren’t exactly nightmarish or anguishing but whose remembrance, when we wake up, leaves a foul taste in our mouth that we don’t quite understand, a feeling of deep disgust that’s not for them, directly, but for something they embody."
"Daqui, da cama, se abro os olhos que têm o sono que não tenho, é um ar de neve tornada cor onde bóiam filamentos de madrepérola morna. E, se o sinto1 com o que sinto, é um tédio tornado sombra branca, escurecendo como se olhos se fechassem sobre essa indistinta brancura.","From here, from the bed, if I open my eyes that have the sleep I don't have, it's an air of snow turned color where filaments of warm mother-of-pearl float. And if I feel it with what I feel, it's a boredom turned white shadow, darkening as if eyes were closing on this indistinct whiteness.","From here, from my bed, if I open my eyes filled with a sleep I do not as yet enjoy, the air is like snow made color in which float filaments of warm mother-of-pearl.

"A tampa, por amor de Deus, a tampa! Concluam-me a inconsciência e vida! Felizmente, pela janela fria, de portas desdobradas para trás, um fio triste de luz pálida começa a tirar a sombra do horizonte. Felizmente, o que vai raiar é o dia.

"Não tomando nada a sério, nem considerando que nos fosse dada, por certa, outra realidade que não as nossas sensações, nelas nos abrigamos, e a elas exploramos como a grandes países desconhecidos. E, se nos empregamos assiduamente, não só na contemplação estética mas também na expressão dos seus modos e resultados, é que a prosa ou o verso que escrevemos, destituídos de vontade de querer convencer o alheio entendimento ou mover a alheia vontade, é apenas como o falar alto de quem lê, feito para dar plena objectividade ao prazer subjectivo da leitura.","Not taking anything seriously, nor considering that we were, of course, given a reality other than our sensations, we shelter in them, and explore them like great unknown countries. And if we assiduously employ ourselves, not only in aesthetic contemplation but also in the expression of its modes and results, it is because the prose or verse we write, devoid of the will to want to convince the other's understanding or move the other's will, is just like the loud speech of the reader, made to give full objectivity to the subjective pleasure of reading.","Unable to take anything seriously and believing that we were given no other reality than that of our feelings, we took shelter in them and explored them as if they were great undiscovered lands. And if we work assiduously not just at aesthetic contemplation but at finding expression for its modes and consequences, it is because the prose or poetry we write, stripped of the desire to influence another’s perceptions or change someone else’s mind, has become rather like someone reading out loud in order to give a heightened objectivity to the subjective pleasure of reading.","Taking nothing seriously and recognizing our sensations as the only reality we have for certain, we take refuge there, exploring them like large unknown countries. And if we apply ourselves diligently not only to aesthetic contemplation but also to the expression of its methods and results, it’s because the poetry or prose we write – devoid of any desire to move anyone else’s will or to mould anyone’s understanding – is merely like when a reader reads out loud to fully objectify the subjective pleasure of reading."
"O patrão Vasques. Lembro-me já dele no futuro com a saudade que sei que hei-de ter então. Estarei sossegado numa casa pequena nos arredores de qualquer coisa, fruindo um sossego onde não farei a obra que não faço agora, e buscarei, para a continuar a não ter feito, desculpas diversas daquelas em que hoje me esquivo a mim. Ou estarei internado num asilo de mendicidade, feliz da derrota inteira, misturado com a ralé dos que se julgaram génios e não foram mais que mendigos com sonhos, junto com a massa anónima dos que não tiveram poder para vencer nem renúncia larga para vencer do avesso. Seja onde estiver, recordarei com saudade o patrão Vasques, o escritório da Rua dos Douradores, e a monotonia da vida quotidiana será para mim como a recordação dos amores que me não foram advindos, ou dos triunfos que não haveriam de ser meus.","The boss Vasques. I already remember him in the future with the nostalgia I know I will have then. I will be at peace in a small house on the outskirts of something, enjoying a peace where I will not do the work that I am not doing now, and I will seek, in order to continue not having done it, excuses different from those in which I elude myself today. Or will I be interned in a begging asylum, happy with the entire defeat, mixed with the rabble of those who thought they were geniuses and were nothing more than beggars with dreams, along with the anonymous mass of those who had neither the power to win nor the wide resignation to win inside out. . Wherever I am, I will fondly remember boss Vasques, the office on Rua dos Douradores, and the monotony of everyday life will be for me like the memory of the loves that did not come to me, or the triumphs that would not have been mine.","The search for the truth — whether the subjective truth of one’s own convictions, the objective truth of reality or the social truth of money or power — always brings with it, if the searcher in question deserves the prize, the ultimate knowledge that the truth does not exist. Life’s biggest lottery prize goes only to those who happened to buy tickets. The value of art is that it takes us away from here. 191 [1929?] Normality is like a home to us and everyday life a mother. After a long incursion into great poetry, into the mountains of sublime aspiration, the cliffs of the transcendent and the occult, it is the sweetest thing, savoring of all that is warm in life, to return to the inn where the happy fools laugh and joke, to join with them in their drinking, as foolish as they are, just as God made us, content with the universe that was given us, and to leave the rest to those who climb mountains and do nothing when they reach the top. It doesn’t shock me that people should say of a man I consider mad or stupid that he is better than some other person whose life and achievements are merely ordinary. When seized by a fit, epileptics are extraordinarily strong; paranoiacs have reasoning powers beyond those of most normal people; religious maniacs in their delirium attract larger crowds of believers than (almost) any demagogue and give an inner strength to their followers that demagogues never can. But all this proves nothing except that madness is madness. I prefer to fail having known the beauty of flowers than to triumph in a wilderness, for triumph is the blindness of the soul left alone with its own worthlessness. How often has some futile dream left me filled with a horror of the inner life, with a physical nausea for mysticisms and meditations. I rush from my home, where I have dreamed these things, and go to the office, where I gaze on Moreira’s face like a voyager finally reaching port. All things considered, I prefer Moreira to the astral world; I prefer reality to truth; in fact, I prefer life to the God who created it. This is how he presented it to me, so this is how I will live it. I dream because I dream, but I don’t insult myself by giving to dreams a value they do not have, apart from that of being my own personal theatre, just as I do not call wine (from which I still do not abstain) “food” or “one of life’s necessities.” 192","Vasques – the boss. I already remember him in the future with the nostalgia I know I’m bound to feel. I’ll be peacefully ensconced in a small house on the outskirts of somewhere or other, enjoying a tranquillity in which I won’t write the works I don’t write now, and to keep on not writing them I’ll come up with even better excuses than the ones I use today to elude myself. Or I’ll be in an institution for paupers, happy in my utter defeat, mixed up with the rabble of would-be geniuses who were no more than beggars with dreams, thrown in with the anonymous throng of those who didn’t have strength enough to conquer nor renunciation enough to conquer by not competing. Wherever I may be, I’ll miss Senhor Vasques and the office on the Rua dos Douradores, and the monotony of my daily life will be like the remembrance of the loves that never came my way and the triumphs that weren’t to be mine."

"Oh, o passado morto que eu trago comigo e nunca esteve senão comigo! As flores do jardim da pequena casa de campo e que nunca existiu senão em mim. As hortas, os pomares, o pinhal, da quinta que foi só um meu sonho! As minhas vilegiaturas supostas, os meus passeios por um campo que nunca existiu! As árvores de à beira da estrada, os atalhos, as pedras, os camponeses que passam… tudo isto, que nunca passou de um sonho, está gravado em minha memória a fazer de dor e eu, que passei horas a sonhá-los, passo horas depois a recordar tê-los sonhado e é, na verdade, saudade que eu tenho, um passado que eu choro, uma vida-real morta que fito, solene no seu caixão.","Oh, the dead past that I carry with me and was never with me! The flowers from the garden of the little country house and that never existed but in me. The vegetable gardens, the orchards, the pine forest, from the farm that was just a dream of mine! My supposed vacations, my walks through a countryside that never existed! The trees by the side of the road, the shortcuts, the stones, the peasants who pass by… all this, which was never more than a dream, is engraved in my memory doing pain and I, who spent hours dreaming about them, spend hours later remembering having dreamed them and it is, in fact, nostalgia that I have, a past that I cry, a real-life dead that I stare, solemn in its coffin.","What does it matter to me if the paper money of my soul can never be converted into gold, since there is no gold in the factitious alchemy of life.","Oh, the dead past that survives in me and that has never been anywhere but in me! The flowers from the garden of the little country house that never existed except in me! The pine grove, orchards and vegetable plots of the farm that was only a dream of mine! My imaginary excursions, my outings in a countryside that never existed! The trees along the roadside, the pathways, the stones, the rural folk passing by – all of this, which was never more than a dream, is recorded in my memory, where it hurts, and I, who spent so many hours dreaming these things, now spend hours remembering having dreamed them, and it’s a genuine nostalgia that I feel, an actual past that I mourn, a real-life corpse that I stare at, lying there solemnly in its coffin."
"Nasce-me, às vezes, desta constatação, uma impressão dolorosa de inimizade divina. Parece-me que só por um ajeitar consciente dos factos, de modo a que me sejam maléficos, a série de desastres, que define a minha vida, me poderia ter acontecido.","At times, from this realization, a painful impression of divine enmity arises for me. It seems to me that just by consciously arranging the facts, so that they are harmful to me, the series of disasters that define my life could have happened to me.","As well as the occasional cart passing rapidly down the street, a truck nearby booms out its own private thunder — a ridiculous, mechanical echo of what’s happening for real in the looming heavens. Again, without warning, another shaft of magnetic light flickers, blinking, across the sky.","This observation sometimes causes me a painful impression of divine hostility. It seems that only by some conscious manipulation of events, to make them work against me, could the series of disasters that define my life have happened."
"O que há de mais doloroso no sonho é não existir. Realmente, não se pode sonhar.","The most painful thing about the dream is that it doesn't exist. Really, you can't dream.",,"A cup of coffee, a bit of tobacco whose aroma passes through me when I smoke it, my eyes half shut in a half-dark room – this, and my dreams, are all I want from life."
"Abdiquemos, pois, de toda a crença sincera, como de toda a preocupação de influir em outrem.","Let us, therefore, abdicate all sincere belief, as well as all concern to influence others.","I feel nothing but aversion and disgust for the sincere adherents of every kind of sincerity and for the mystics of every kind of mysticism, or rather for the sincerities of all sincere people and for the mysticisms of all mystics.","So let us renounce all sincere beliefs, along with all concern to influence others."

The fatigue that I bring with me from a train trip to Cascais is as if I had, in that short time, traveled through the countryside and cities of four or five countries.","[1931?] For me, everything that is not my soul is, whether I like it or not, mere scenery, mere decor.","Every time I go somewhere, it’s a vast journey.

"Porque parei, estremeceram as águas. Porque reflecti, o sol recolheu-se. Cerro os olhos lentos e cheios de sono, e não há dentro de mim senão uma região lacustre onde a noite começa a deixar de ser dia num reflexo castanho escuro de águas de onde as algas surgem.","Because I stopped, the waters trembled. Because I reflected, the sun went down. I close my eyes, slow and sleepy, and there is nothing inside me but a lakeside region where the night begins to change from day to a dark brown reflection of waters from which algae emerge.","Because I stopped, the waters trembled.

"Meu pai, que vivia longe, matou-se quando eu tinha três anos e nunca o conheci. Não sei ainda por que é que vivia longe. Nunca me importei de o saber. Lembro-me da notícia da sua morte como de uma grande seriedade às primeiras refeições depois de se saber. Olhavam, lembro-me, de vez em quando para mim. E eu olhava de troco, entendendo estupidamente. Depois comia com mais regra, pois talvez, sem eu ver, continuassem a olhar-me.","My father, who lived far away, killed himself when I was three and I never met him. I still don't know why he lived far away. I never cared to know. I remember the news of his death as a great seriousness to the first meals after knowing. They looked, I remember, from time to time at me. And I looked back, stupidly understanding. Then I ate more regularly, because perhaps, without my seeing them, they would continue to look at me.","Taking care that my thumb doesn’t miss the vital loop, I turn it over to reveal a different pattern. Then I start again. Living is like crocheting patterns to someone else’s design. But while one works, one’s thoughts are free and, as the ivory hook dives in and out amongst the wool, all the enchanted princes that ever existed are free to stroll through their parks. The crochet of things … A pause … Nothing … For the rest, what qualities can I count on in myself? A horribly keen awareness of sensation and an all too deep consciousness of feeling … A sharp self-destructive intelligence and an extraordinary talent for dreams to entertain myself with … A defunct will and a reflective spirit in which to cradle it like a living child … In short, crochet …","My father, who lived far away, killed himself when I was three, and so I never met him. I still don’t know why he lived far away. I never cared to find out. I remember his death as a grave silence during the first meals we ate after learning about it. I remember that the others would occasionally look at me. And I would look back, dumbly comprehending. Then I’d eat with more concentration, since they might, when I wasn’t looking, still be looking at me."
"Mesmo eu, o que sonha tanto, tenho intervalos em que o sonho me foge. Então as coisas aparecem-me nítidas. Esvai-se a névoa de que me cerco. E todas as arestas visíveis ferem a carne da minha alma. Todas as durezas olhadas me magoam o conhecê-las2 durezas. Todos os pesos visíveis de objectos me pesam por a alma dentro.","Even I, the one who dreams so much, have intervals when the dream eludes me. Then things seem clear to me. The fog that I surround myself with vanishes. And every visible edge hurts the flesh of my soul. All the hardnesses I've seen hurt me to know them. All the visible weights of objects weigh my soul inside.","All this mixing up of soul and feelings, of my thoughts with the air and the river, just to say that life wounds my sense of smell and my consciousness, just because I do not have the wit to use the simple, all-embracing words of the Book of Job: “My soul is weary of my life!”","There are times when dreaming eludes even me, an obsessive dreamer, and then I see things in vivid detail. The mist in which I take refuge dissipates. And every visible edge cuts the skin of my soul. Every harsh thing I see wounds the part of me that recognizes its harshness. Every object’s visible weight weighs heavy inside my soul."
"A impossibilidade de agir foi sempre em mim uma moléstia com etiologia metafísica. Fazer um gesto foi sempre, para o meu sentimento das coisas, uma perturbação, um desdobramento, no universo exterior; mexer-me deu-me sempre a impressão que não deixaria intactas as estrelas nem os céus sem mudança. Por isso a importância metafísica do mais pequeno gesto cedo tomou um relevo atónito dentro de mim. Adquiri perante agir um escrúpulo de honestidade transcendental, que me inibe, desde que o fixei na minha consciência, de ter relações muito acentuadas com o mundo palpável.","The impossibility of acting has always been an illness with a metaphysical etiology for me. To make a gesture was always, for my feeling of things, a disturbance, an unfolding, in the external universe; moving always gave me the impression that I would not leave the stars intact or the skies unchanged. So the metaphysical importance of the smallest gesture soon took on an astonished relief within me. I acquired a scruple of transcendental honesty before acting, which prevents me, as soon as I have fixed it in my consciousness, from having very strong relationships with the palpable world.","First I was him, now I am me. Yes, for a moment I was someone else: I saw and lived as another that humble, human happiness of existing like a dumb beast in shirtsleeves. What an excellent day to bring me such a dream! Up above it is all blue and sublime like my ephemeral dream of being a hale and hearty traveling salesman off on some after-hours jaunt.","My inability to act has always been an ailment with a metaphysical aetiology. I’ve always felt that to perform a gesture implied a disturbance, a repercussion, in the outer universe; I’ve always had the impression that any movement I might make would unsettle the stars and rock the skies. And so the tiniest gesture assumed for me early on a metaphysical significance of astonishing proportions. I developed an attitude of transcendental honesty with respect to all action, and ever since this attitude took firm hold in my consciousness, it has prevented me from having intense relations with the tangible world."
"Desenganemo-nos, meu amor, da vida e dos seus modos. Fujamos a sermos nós… Não tiremos do dedo o anel mágico que chama, mexendo-se-lhe, pelas fadas do silêncio e pelos elfos da sombra e pelos gnomos do esquecimento…","Let us be deceived, my love, of life and its ways. Let's run away to be ourselves...

Let us flee, my love, from being ourselves… Let us never remove from our finger the magic ring that summons, when turned, the fairies of silence and the elves of darkness and the gnomes of oblivion…"
"Poder escrever, em palavras sobre papel, que se possam depois ler alto e ouvir, os diálogos das personagens dos meus dramas imaginados! Esses dramas têm uma acção perfeita e sem quebra, diálogos sem falha, mas nem a acção se esboça em mim em comprimento, para que eu a possa projectar em realização; nem são propriamente palavras o que forma a substância desses diálogos íntimos, para que, ouvidas com atenção, eu as possa traduzir para escritas.","To be able to write, in words on paper, which can then be read aloud and heard, the dialogues of the characters in my imagined dramas!

"Feliz, pois, o que não pensa, porque realiza por instinto e destino orgânico o que todos nós temos que realizar por desvio e destino inorgânico ou social. Feliz o que mais se assemelha aos brutos, porque é sem esforço o que todos nós somos com trabalho imposto; porque sabe o caminho de casa, que nós outros não encontramos senão por atalhos de ficção e regresso; porque, enraizado como uma árvore, é parte da paisagem e portanto da beleza, e não, como nós, mitos da passagem, figurantes de trajo vivo da inutilidade e do esquecimento.","Happy, therefore, is he who does not think, because he accomplishes by instinct and organic destiny what we all have to accomplish by deviation and inorganic or social destiny.

Happy the man most like the brute beasts because he effortlessly is what we all struggle to be; because he knows the way home which we find only through the byways of fiction and after much retracing of steps; because, rooted like a tree, he is part of the landscape and therefore part of its beauty and not, like us, a transient myth, a mannequin wearing the bright costumes of vanity and oblivion.","Happy the man who doesn’t think, for he accomplishes instinctively and through organic destiny what the rest of us must accomplish through much meandering and an inorganic or social destiny. Happy the man who most resembles the animals, for he is effortlessly what the rest of us only are by hard work; for he knows the way home, which the rest of us can reach only through byways of fiction and hazy return routes; for he is rooted like a tree, forming part of the landscape and therefore of beauty, while we are but myths who cross the stage, walk-ons of futility and oblivion dressed in real-life costumes."

"Quantas vezes, presa da superfície e do bruxedo, me sinto homem. Então convivo com alegria e existo com clareza. Sobrenado. E é-me agradável receber o ordenado e ir para casa.

"E o criado velho que me serve, e que acaba de depor ante mim o que deve ser o milionésimo café da sua deposição de café em mesas?

"Mas o que fica de sentir tudo isto é com certeza um desgosto da vida e de todos os seus gestos, um cansaço antecipado dos desejos e de todos os seus modos, um desgosto anónimo de todos os sentimentos. Nestas horas de mágoa subtil, torna-se-nos impossível, até em sonho, ser amante, ser herói, ser feliz. Tudo isso está vazio, até na ideia do que é. Tudo isso está dito em outra linguagem, para nós incompreensível, meros sons de sílabas sem forma no entendimento. A vida é oca, a alma é oca, o mundo é oco. Todos os deuses morrem de uma morte maior que a morte. Tudo está mais vazio que o vácuo. É tudo um caos de coisas nenhumas.","But what remains of feeling all this is certainly a displeasure of life and of all its gestures, an anticipated tiredness of desires and of all their ways, an anonymous displeasure of all feelings.

"Sem querer, sinto que tenho estado a pensar na minha vida. Não dei por isso, mas assim foi. Julguei que somente via e ouvia, que não era mais, em todo este meu percurso ocioso, que um reflexor de imagens dadas, um biombo branco onde a realidade projecta cores e luz em vez de sombras.

I thought that I only saw and heard, that I was nothing more, throughout my idle journey, than a reflection of given images, a white screen where reality projects colors and light instead of shadows. But it was more, without her knowing it. It was still the soul that denies itself, and my own abstract observation was still a denial.","How often, to obtain a deeper sense of repose, do I remember what I never was, and there is no clarity, no nostalgia about my memories of a provincial town where I lived as people do, measuring out each floorboard, moving in and out of the long ago, in vast rooms I never knew.","I realize that I’ve been inadvertently thinking about my life.

"De suave e aérea a hora era uma ara onde orar. Por certo que no horóscopo do nosso encontro benéficos conjuntos culminavam. Tal, tão sedosa e tão subtil, a matéria incerta de sonho visto que se intrometia na nossa consciência de sentir. Cessara por completo, como um verão qualquer, a nossa noção ácida de que não vale a pena viver. Renascia aquela primavera que, embora por erro, podíamos pensar que houvéssemos tido. No desprestígio das nossas semelhanças os tanques lamentavam-se da mesma maneira, entre árvores, e as rosas nos canteiros descobertos, e a melodia indefinida de viver — tudo irresponsavelmente.","From light and airy, the hour was a place to pray. Of course, in the horoscope of our meeting, joint benefices culminated. Such, so silky and so subtle, the uncertain matter of dream as it intruded on our consciousness of feeling. Like any other summer, our sour notion that life is not worth living had completely ceased. That spring was reborn that, albeit by mistake, we might have thought we had had. In the lack of prestige of our similarities, the ponds moaned in the same way, among the trees, and the roses in the open beds, and the indefinite melody of living - all irresponsibly.","Everything unpleasant that happens to us in life — for example, when we appear ridiculous in the eyes of others, behave badly or lapse from virtue — should be considered merely external events without the power to touch the depths of our soul.","The so gentle and ethereal hour was an altar for prayer. The horoscope of our meeting was surely ruled by auspicious conjunctions – so subtle and silken was the vague substance of glimpsed dreams that had mingled with our awareness of feeling. Our bitter conviction that life wasn’t worth living had come to an end, like one more summer. There was a rebirth of that spring which we could now, albeit fallaciously, imagine had been ours. With humiliating similarity to humans, the pools among the trees also lamented, along with the roses in the unshaded flower beds and the indefinite melody of living – all irresponsibly."
"Tudo ali é quebrado, anónimo e impertencente. Vi ali grandes movimentos de ternura, que me pareceram revelar o fundo de pobres almas tristes; descobri que esses movimentos não duravam mais que a hora em que eram palavras, e que tinham raiz — quantas vezes o notei com a sagacidade dos silenciosos — na analogia de qualquer coisa com o piedoso, perdida com a rapidez da novidade da notação, e, outras vezes, no vinho do jantar do enternecido. Havia sempre uma relação sistematizada entre os humanitarismos e a aguardente de bagaço, e foram muitos os grandes gestos que sofreram do copo supérfluo ou do pleonasmo da sede.","Everything there is broken, anonymous and impertinent. There I saw great movements of tenderness, which seemed to me to reveal the depths of poor sad souls; I found that these movements did not last longer than the hour they were words, and that they had their root—how often I have noticed it with the sagacity of the silent—in the analogy of anything with the pious, lost with the rapidity of the novelty of notation, and, at other times, in the wine at the dinner of the loved one. There was always a systematic relationship between humanitarianism and marc spirits, and there were many great gestures that suffered from the superfluous glass or the pleonasm of thirst.","Or else I’ll be interned in a poorhouse, content with my utter failure, mingling with the riff-raff who believed they were geniuses when in fact they were just beggars with dreams, mixing with the anonymous mass of people who had neither the strength to triumph nor the power to turn their defeats into victories.","There everything is feeble, anonymous and gratuitous. There I saw great demonstrations of compassion, which seemed to reveal the depths of tragically sad souls, but I discovered that the demonstrations lasted no longer than the moment in which they were words, and that they originated – how often I observed this with the discernment of the silent – in something analogous to pity, lost as swiftly as the novelty of the observation, or else in the wine of the compassionate soul’s dinner. There was always a direct relationship between the humanitarian sentiments expressed and the amount of brandy consumed, and many a grand gesture suffered from one glass too many or from a pleonastic thirst."

"“Sou do tamanho do que vejo!” Cada vez que penso esta frase com toda a atenção dos meus nervos, ela me parece mais destinada a reconstruir consteladamente o universo. “Sou do tamanho do que vejo!” Que grande posse mental vai desde o poço das emoções profundas até às altas estrelas que se reflectem nele, e, assim, em certo modo, ali estão.","“I am the size of what I see!” Every time I think of this sentence with all the attention of my nerves, it seems to me more destined to constellately reconstruct the universe. “I am the size of what I see!” What great mental possession goes from the well of deep emotions to the high stars that are reflected in it, and so, in a way, there they are.","“I am the size of what I see!” Each time I think this phrase with every nerve of my being, I’m filled by an even stronger conviction of its ability to reorganize the heavens into new constellations. “I am the size of what I see!” What mental energy springs up from the well of deep emotions to the high stars it reflects and which, in some way, inhabit it.","‘I’m the size of what I see!’ Each time I think on this phrase with all my nerves, the more it seems destined to redesign the whole starry universe. ‘I’m the size of what I see!’ How large are the mind’s riches, ranging from the well of profound emotions to the distant stars that are reflected in it and so in some sense are there!"

"Não sei se os outros serão assim, se a ciência da vida não consistirá essencialmente em ser tão alheio a si mesmo que instintivamente se consegue um alheamento e se pode participar da vida como estranho à consciência; ou se os outros, mais ensimesmados do que eu, não serão de todo a bruteza de não serem senão eles, vivendo exteriormente por aquele milagre pelo qual as abelhas formam sociedades mais organizadas que qualquer nação, e as formigas comunicam entre si com uma fala de antenas mínimas que excede nos resultados a nossa complexa ausência de nos entendermos.","I don't know if others will be like that, if the science of life doesn't essentially consist in being so alien to oneself that one instinctively achieves an alienation and can participate in life as a stranger to consciousness; or whether the others, more self-absorbed than I am, are not at all the brutish of being nothing but themselves, living outwardly by that miracle by which bees form societies more organized than any nation, and ants communicate with each other with a speech of minimal antennas that exceed in results our complex absence of understanding.","I, however, think with my imagination, and everything in me that should be reason or sorrow or impulse is reduced inside me to something distant and indifferent, like that dead lake set among rocks over which hovers the last lingering ray of sun.","I don’t know if others are like me, or if the science of life consists essentially in being so alienated from oneself that this alienation becomes second nature, such that one can participate in life as an exile from his own consciousness. Or perhaps other people, even more self-absorbed than I, are completely given over to the brutishness of being only themselves, living outwardly by the same miracle that enables bees to form societies more highly organized than any nation and allows ants to communicate with a language of tiny antennae whose results surpass our complex system of mutual understanding."
"Nova, fluida, incerta, a chuva soava. Os momentos tardavam ao som dela. A solidão da minha alma alargava-se, alastrava, invadia o que eu sentia, o que eu queria, o que eu ia a sonhar. Os objectos vagos, participantes, na sombra, da minha insónia, passavam a ter lugar e dor na minha desolação.","New, fluid, uncertain, the rain sounded. Moments lingered at the sound of her. The loneliness of my soul widened, spread, invaded what I felt, what I wanted, what I was dreaming. The vague objects, participants, in the shadows, of my insomnia, started to have a place and pain in my desolation.","The light tang of that cigarette smoke is enough for me to relive the whole of my past life. At other times, a certain type of sweet might serve the same purpose. One innocent chocolate can rack my nerves with the profusion of memories it provokes.","Again, fluid and uncertain, the rain pattered. Time dragged to its accompaniment. My soul’s solitude grew and spread, invading what I felt, what I wanted, and what I was going to dream. The room’s hazy objects, which shared my insomnia in the shadows, moved with their sadness into my desolation."
"É mais pesado, mais velho, menos voluntário que me sento à carteira alta e começo a continuação da escrita de ontem. Mas a vaga tragédia de hoje interrompe com meditações, que tenho que dominar à força, o processo automático da escrita como deve ser.

O moço do escritório foi-se embora.","It's heavier, older, less willing that I sit down at the tall desk and start the continuation of yesterday's writing. But today's vague tragedy interrupts with meditations, which I have to master by force, the automatic process of writing properly. I have no soul to work except because I can, with an active inertia, be my slave. The office boy left.","And what about the old waiter who serves me and who, for what must be the millionth time in his career, has just placed a coffee on the table before me? His life is the same as the cook’s, the only difference being the four or five yards that separate the kitchen where one works from the restaurant dining room where the other works. Apart from minor differences like having two rather than five children, paying more frequent visits to Galicia, and knowing Lisbon better than the cook (as well as Oporto, where he lived for four years), he is equally contented.","Wearier, older, and less willing, I sit down at the high desk and continue working from where I left off yesterday.

"As coisas nítidas confortam, e as coisas ao sol confortam. Ver passar a vida sob um dia azul compensa-me de muito. Esqueço indefinidamente, esqueço mais do que podia lembrar. O meu coração translúcido e aéreo penetra-se da suficiência das coisas, e olhar basta-me carinhosamente. Nunca eu fui outra coisa que uma visão incorpórea, despida de toda a alma salvo um vago ar que passou e que via.","Sharp things comfort, and things in the sun comfort. Watching life go by under a blue day makes up for a lot. I forget indefinitely, I forget more than I could remember. My translucent and airy heart is penetrated by the sufficiency of things, and looking affectionately suffices for me. I was never anything other than a disembodied vision, stripped of all soul save for a vague air that passed and saw.",And indeed that is what I do call him. Physically he looks like a worn-out businessman. The signs of weariness on his face could as easily come from leading an unhealthy life as from thinking too much. His gestures are utterly unremarkable. There’s a certain sparkle in his eyes — the privilege of one not afflicted with myopia.,"Clear things console me, and sunlit things console me. To see life passing by under a blue sky makes up for a lot. I forget myself indefinitely, forgetting more than I could ever remember. The sufficiency of things fills my weightless, translucent heart, and just to look is a sweet satisfaction. I’ve never been more than a bodiless gaze, whose only soul was a slight breeze that passed by and saw."
"E mostrou-me como era estéril a esperança de melhores dias, quando se não nascera com alma, em que os dias bons18 se obtivessem. Mostrou-me como o sonho não consola, porque a vida dói mais quando se acorda.

It showed me how dreams don't console, because life hurts more when you wake up. He showed me how sleep does not rest, because ghosts inhabit it, shadows of things, traces of gestures, dead embryos of desires, remains of the shipwreck of living.",,"And she showed me the futility of hoping for better days when one isn’t born with a soul that can know better days. She showed me how dreaming never consoles, for life hurts all the more when we wake up. She showed me how sleep gives no rest, for it is haunted by phantoms, shadows of things, ghosts of gestures, stillborn desires, the flotsam from the shipwreck of living."

"Desde que possamos considerar este mundo uma ilusão e um fantasma, poderemos considerar tudo que nos acontece como um sonho, coisa que fingiu ser porque dormíamos. E então nasce em nós uma indiferença subtil e profunda para com todos os desaires e desastres da vida. Os que morrem viraram a uma esquina, e por isso os deixámos de ver; os que sofrem passam perante nós, se sentimos, como um pesadelo, se pensamos, como um devaneio ingrato. E o nosso próprio sofrimento não será mais que esse nada. Neste mundo dormimos sobre o lado esquerdo e ouvimos nos sonhos a existência opressa do coração.","As long as we can regard this world as an illusion and a ghost, we can regard everything that happens to us as a dream, which it pretended to be because we slept. And then a subtle and profound indifference is born in us towards all the failures and disasters of life. Those who die have turned a corner, and that is why we no longer see them; those who suffer pass before us, if we feel, like a nightmare, if we think, like an ungrateful daydream. And our own suffering will be nothing but this nothingness. In this world we sleep on the left side and we hear in dreams the oppressed existence of the heart.","Once we believe this world to be merely an illusion and a phantasm, we are then free to consider everything that happens to us as a dream, something that only pretended to exist because we were asleep. And then a subtle and profound indifference towards all life’s vexations and disasters is born in us. Those who died simply turned a corner and are out of sight; those who suffer pass before our eyes like a nightmare (if we feel), like an unpleasant daydream (if we think). And our own suffering will be nothing more than that nothingness. In this world we all sleep on our left side and hear in our dreams the oppressive beating of our heart.","Once we’re able to see this world as an illusion and a phantasm, then we can see everything that happens to us as a dream, as something that pretended to exist while we were sleeping.

"Considero-me feliz por não ter já parentes. Não me vejo assim na obrigação, que inevitavelmente me pesaria, de ter que amar alguém. Não tenho saudades senão literariamente. Lembro a minha infância com lágrimas, mas são lágrimas rítmicas, onde já se prepara a prosa. Lembro-a como uma coisa externa e através de coisas externas; lembro só as coisas externas. Não é sossego dos serões de província que me enternece da infância que vivi neles, é a disposição da mesa para o chá, são os vultos dos móveis em torno da casa, são as caras e os gestos físicos das pessoas. É de quadros que tenho saudades. Por isso, tanto me enternece a minha infância como a de outrem: são ambas, no passado que não sei o que é, fenómenos puramente visuais, que sinto com a atenção literária. Enterneço-me, sim, mas não é porque lembro, mas porque vejo.","I consider myself happy that I no longer have relatives. I don't see myself like this in the obligation, which would inevitably weigh on me, of having to love someone. I don't miss it except literally. I remember my childhood with tears, but they are rhythmic tears, where prose is already being prepared. I remember it as an external thing and through external things; I only remember the external things. It's not the peace of the country evenings that moves me from the childhood I lived in them, it's the arrangement of the table for tea, it's the shapes of the furniture around the house, it's the faces and physical gestures of the people. It's paintings I miss. That's why my childhood as much as someone else's touches me: they are both, in the past I don't know what they are, purely visual phenomena, which I feel with literary attention. I am touched, yes, but not because I remember, but because I see.","Others will lean from the same windows; those who have forgotten about shadowy fears are sleeping, nostalgic for the sun they never knew; and I myself, who dares but does not act, will end up, with no regrets, among those soggy reeds made muddy by the nearby river and by my own flaccid inertia, beneath the vast autumn skies of evening, in impossibly far-flung places.","I consider myself fortunate for no longer having family, as it relieves me of the obligation to love someone, which I would surely find burdensome. Any nostalgia I feel is literary. I remember my childhood with tears, but they’re rhythmic tears, in which prose is already being formed. I remember it as something external, and it comes back to me through external things; I remember only external things. It’s not the stillness of evenings in the country that endears me to the childhood I spent there , it’s the way the table was set for tea , it’s the way the furniture was arranged in the room , it’s the faces and physical gestures of the people. I feel nostalgia for scenes. Thus someone else’s childhood can move me as much as my own; both are purely visual phenomena from a past I’m unable to fathom, and my perception of them is literary. They move me, yes, but because I see them, not because I remember them."
"A vida deve ser, para os melhores, um sonho que se recusa a confrontos.","Life must be, for the best, a dream that refuses confrontation.","Or perhaps … Yes, sometimes, when I consider the huge gulf that exists between the intelligence of children and the stupidity of adults, I think that as children we must have a guardian angel who lends us his own astral intelligence and then, perhaps with sadness, but in accordance with a higher law, abandons us, the way female animals abandon their grown-up offspring, to become the fattened pigs it’s our destiny to be.","For superior men, life should be a dream that spurns confrontations."

"Sempre que podem, sentam-se defronte do espelho. Falam connosco e namoram-se de olhos a si mesmos. Por vezes, como nos namoros1, distraem-se da conversa. Fui-lhes sempre simpático, porque a minha aversão adulta pelo meu aspecto me compeliu sempre a escolher o espelho como coisa para onde virasse as costas. Assim, e eles de instinto o reconheciam tratando-me sempre bem, eu era o rapaz escutador que lhes deixava sempre livres a vaidade e a tribuna.","Whenever they can, they sit in front of the mirror. They talk to us and make love with their eyes on themselves. Sometimes, as in dating1, they are distracted from the conversation. I was always nice to them, because my adult aversion to my appearance always compelled me to choose the mirror as something to turn my back on. So, and they instinctively recognized him by always treating me well, I was the listening boy who always left their vanity and the platform free.","Then, reaching out for my forgotten pen, I write my way back into the anonymous health of normal life.","Whenever they can, they sit opposite a mirror. While talking to us, they look at themselves with infatuated eyes. Sometimes, as happens to people in love, they lose track of the conversation.

And so they treated me well, for they instinctively recognized that I was the good listener who would always let them show off and have the pulpit."

Another soul, of one who watches the night. I walk uncertainly and allegorically, unreally sentient.

"Tudo quanto não é a minha alma é para mim, por mais que eu queira que o não seja, não mais que cenário e decoração. Um homem, ainda que eu possa reconhecer pelo pensamento que ele é um ente vivo como eu, teve sempre, para o que em mim, por me ser involuntário, é verdadeiramente eu, menos importância que uma árvore, se a árvore é mais bela. Por isso senti sempre os movimentos humanos — as grandes tragédias colectivas da história ou do que dela fazem — como frisos coloridos, vazios da alma dos que passam neles. Nunca me pesou o que de trágico se passasse na China. É decoração longínqua, ainda que a sangue e peste.","Everything that is not my soul is for me, as much as I would like it not to be, nothing more than scenery and decoration. A man, even though I can recognize by thought that he is a living being like me, has always had, for what in me, because I am involuntary, is truly me, of less importance than a tree, if the tree is more beautiful. That's why I've always felt human movements — the great collective tragedies of history or what they make of it — as colored friezes, empty of the souls of those who pass through them. I never weighed what tragic happened in China. It is a distant decoration, even if in blood and plague.","On the way there, I lost myself in abstract thoughts, watching, without actually seeing, the waterscapes I was so looking forward to, and on the way back I lost myself in the analysis of those feelings.","Whether I like it or not, everything that isn’t my soul is no more for me than scenery and decoration. Through rational thought I can recognize that a man is a living being just like me, but for my true, involuntary self he has always had less importance than a tree, if the tree is more beautiful. That’s why I’ve always seen human events – the great collective tragedies of history or of what we make of history – as colourful friezes, with no soul in the figures that appear there. I’ve never thought twice about anything tragic that has happened in China. It’s just scenery in the distance, even if painted with blood and disease."

"Por isso a morte enobrece, veste de galas desconhecidas o pobre corpo absurdo. É que ali está um liberto, embora o não quisesse ser. É que ali não está um escravo, embora ele chorando perdesse a servidão.

It's just that there's a freedman there, even though he didn't want to be one. It's just that there isn't a slave there, although he was weeping and lost his servitude. Like a king whose greatest pomp is his king's name, and who may be laughable as a man, but as a king he is superior, so the dead may be misshapen, but he is superior, because death has set him free.",I have caught occasional hints of something similar to this ambition (which outdoes in negativity even the void itself) in the often confused speculations of the Indians. But either they lack the keenness of feeling that would enable them to explain what they think or the acuity of thought to feel what they feel.,"Death ennobles, dressing our poor ridiculous bodies in finery they have never known. In death a man is free, even if he didn’t want freedom. In death he’s no longer a slave, even if he wept on giving up his slavery. Like a king whose greatest glory is his kingly title, and who as a man may be laughable but as a king is superior, so the dead man may be horribly deformed but is still superior, because death has freed him."

"O exemplo máximo do homem prático, porque reúne a extrema concentração da acção com a sua extrema importância, é a do estratégico. Toda a vida é guerra, e a batalha é, pois, a síntese da vida. Ora o estratégico é um homem que joga com vidas como o jogador de xadrez com peças do jogo. Que seria do estratégico se pensasse que cada lance do seu jogo põe noite em mil lares e mágoa em três mil corações? Que seria do mundo se fôssemos humanos? Se o homem sentisse deveras, não haveria civilização. A arte serve de fuga para a sensibilidade que a acção teve que esquecer.

If man really felt, there would be no civilization. Art serves as an escape for the sensibility that action had to forget. Art is Cinderella, who stayed at home because she had to.","I detest and could happily do without cars and the other products of science — telephones and telegrams — that make life easy, or the by-products of fantasy — gramophones and radios — which, to those who like them, make life fun. I’m not interested in any of that; I want none of it. But I love the Tejo because of the great city on its banks. I enjoy the sky because I see it from a fourth-floor window in a street in the Baixa. Nothing in the countryside or in nature can give me anything to equal the ragged majesty of the calm moonlit city seen from Graça or São Pedro de Alcântara. For me no flowers can match the endlessly varied colors of Lisbon in the sunlight.","The best example of the practical man is the military strategist, in whom extreme concentration of action is joined to its extreme importance.

But — in addition to having always lived with a false personality of his own, and suspecting that he never really had me as a friend — I always realized that someone would call him to leave him the book he left. I like to think that, even if it pained me at first, when I noticed him, at last seeing everything through the only criterion worthy of a psychologist, I became1 in the same way his friend and dedicated to the end for which he brought me closer to him — the publication of your book.","vii This passage is headed by a note in English: “1st article.” It is likely that texts 134 and 136 were intended as preliminary texts. Around 1917, Pessoa sketched out not one but several attempts at a preface to the Book. viii This passage is headed by a note in Portuguese: “(Prefácio?).” The Book of Disquiet","He never had to face the demands of society or of the state. He even evaded the demands of his own instincts. Nothing ever prompted him to have friends or lovers. I was the only one who was in some way his intimate. But even if I always felt that I was relating to an assumed personality and that he didn’t really consider me his friend, I realized from the beginning that he needed someone to whom he could leave the book that he left. This troubled me at first, but I’m glad to say that I was able to see the matter from a psychologist’s point of view, and I remained just as much his friend, devoted to the end for which he’d drawn me to himself – the publication of this book."

"Viver uma vida desapaixonada e culta, ao relento das ideias, lendo, sonhando, e pensando em escrever, uma vida suficientemente lenta para estar sempre à beira do tédio, bastante meditada para se nunca encontrar nele. Viver essa vida longe das emoções e dos pensamentos, só no pensamento das emoções e na emoção dos pensamentos. Estagnar ao sol, douradamente, como um lago obscuro rodeado de flores. Ter, na sombra, aquela fidalguia da individualidade que consiste em não insistir para nada com a vida. Ser no volteio dos mundos como uma poeira de flores, que um vento incógnito ergue pelo ar da tarde, e o torpor do anoitecer deixa baixar no lugar de acaso, indistinta entre coisas maiores. Ser isto com um conhecimento seguro, nem alegre nem triste, reconhecido ao sol do seu brilho e às estrelas do seu afastamento. Não ser mais, não ter mais, não querer mais… A música do faminto, a canção do cego, a relíquia do viandante incógnito, as passadas no deserto do camelo vazio sem destino…","To live a dispassionate and cultured life, outside of ideas, reading, dreaming, and thinking about writing, a life slow enough to always be on the edge of boredom, meditated enough to never find yourself in it. To live this life away from emotions and thoughts, only in the thought of emotions and in the emotion of thoughts. To stagnate in the sun, golden, like a dark lake surrounded by flowers. To have, in the shadows, that nobility of individuality that consists in not insisting on anything with life. To be in the whirl of worlds like a dust of flowers, which an incognito wind lifts through the afternoon air, and the torpor of dusk lets it settle in the place of chance, indistinct among greater things. To be this with a sure knowledge, neither happy nor sad, recognized by the sun of its brightness and the stars of its remoteness. To be no more, to have no more, to want no more… The music of the hungry, the song of the blind man, the relic of the incognito traveler, the strides in the desert of the empty camel with no destination…","And with what relief — a bright flash, a pause, a thunderclap — did that thunder, now near at hand, now moving off, relieve us of what had been. God was retreating. I felt myself filling my lungs. I noticed how airless the office was. I noticed that there were other people present too, as well as the office boy. Everyone had fallen silent.

"Subitamente, como uma criança do Mistério, um galo canta sem saber da noite. Posso dormir, porque é manhã em mim. E sinto a minha boca sorrir, deslocando levemente as pregas moles da fronha que me prende o rosto.

"Tinha entrado já o princípio do outono, e, além das folhas que pisávamos, ouvíamos cair continuamente, no acompanhamento brusco do vento, outras folhas, ou sons de folhas, por toda a parte onde íamos ou havíamos ido. Não havia mais paisagem senão a floresta que velava todas. Bastava, porém, como sítio e lugar para os que, como nós, não tínhamos por vida senão o caminhar uníssono e diverso sobre um solo mortiço. Era — creio — o fim de um dia, ou de qualquer dia, ou porventura de todos os dias, num outono todos os outonos, na floresta simbólica e verdadeira.","The beginning of autumn had already arrived, and, in addition to the leaves that we were stepping on, we could hear other leaves falling continuously, in the sudden accompaniment of the wind, other leaves, or sounds of leaves, everywhere we went or had gone. There was no more landscape than the forest that veiled them all. It was enough, however, as a place and place for those who, like us, had for life nothing but walking in unison and diverse on a dead ground. It was — I believe — the end of a day, or of any day, or perhaps of every day, in an autumn every autumn, in the symbolic and true forest.","It was already the beginning of autumn, and, as well as the leaves we were walking over, we could hear, everywhere we went or had been, the continual fall, to the brusque accompaniment of the wind, of other leaves, or the sounds of leaves.

It was enough, though, as a site and a place for those like us, whose only life was to walk in diverse unison over the dying earth. It was — I believe — the end of a day, of any day, or perhaps of all days, in an autumn that was all autumns, in that real and symbolic forest.","Autumn had already begun, and besides the leaves under our feet we could hear, in the wind’s rough accompaniment, the constant falling of other leaves, or sounds of leaves, wherever we walked or had walked.

"E curo-a com o escrevê-la. Sim, não há desolação, se é profunda deveras, desde que não seja puro sentimento, mas nela participe a inteligência, para que não haja o remédio irónico de a dizer. Quando a literatura não tivesse outra utilidade, esta, embora para poucos, teria.","And I heal it by writing it. Yes, there is no desolation, if it is really profound, as long as it is not pure feeling, but intelligence participates in it, so that there is no ironic remedy to say it. When literature had no other use, this one, although for a few, would have.","If I find myself dreaming, I immediately fill up with words. In me every emotion is an image, and every dream a painting set to music. What I write may be bad, but it is more me than what I think … Or so I sometimes believe …","And yet I do cure it, by writing about it. Yes, for every truly profound desolation, one that’s not pure feeling but has some intelligence mixed in with it, there’s always the ironic remedy of expressing it. If literature has no other usefulness, it at least has this one, though it serves only a few."
"Tudo, porém, era falso. Não contaram histórias que outros houvessem contado, nem se sabe ao certo do que partiu outrora, na esperança do embarque falso, filho da bruma futura e da indecisão por vir.

They did not tell stories that others had told, nor is it known for certain what left in the past, in the hope of false boarding, child of the future mist and the indecision to come. I have a name among those who delay, and that name is a shadow like everything else.","Others will lean from the same windows; those who have forgotten about shadowy fears are sleeping, nostalgic for the sun they never knew; and I myself, who dares but does not act, will end up, with no regrets, among those soggy reeds made muddy by the nearby river and by my own flaccid inertia, beneath the vast autumn skies of evening, in impossibly far-flung places.","But it was all false. They told none of the stories that nobody told them, and no one knows anything for sure about the one who departed long ago, placing his hope in the false voyage, son of the fog and indecision to come. I have a name among those who tarry, and that name is shadow, like everything."
"O meu desejo é de morrer, pelo menos temporariamente, mas isto, como disse, só porque me dói a cabeça. E neste momento, de repente, lembra-me com que melhor nobreza um dos grandes prosadores diria isto. Desenrolaria, período a período, a mágoa anónima do mundo; aos seus olhos imaginadores de parágrafos surgiriam, diversos, os dramas humanos que há na terra, e através do latejar das fontes febris erguer-se-ia no papel toda uma metafísica da desgraça. Eu, porém, não tenho nobreza estilística. Dói-me a cabeça porque me dói a cabeça. Dói-me o universo porque a cabeça me dói. Mas o universo que realmente me dói não é o verdadeiro, o que existe porque não sabe que existo, mas aquele, meu de mim, que, se eu passar as mãos pelos cabelos, me faz parecer sentir que eles sofrem todos só para me fazerem sofrer.","My wish is to die, at least temporarily, but this, as I said, only because my head hurts. And at this moment, suddenly, it reminds me with what better nobility one of the great prose writers would say this. It would unfold, period by period, the anonymous grief of the world; to his imagining eyes of paragraphs, the human dramas that exist on earth would emerge, and through the throbbing of feverish sources a whole metaphysics of misfortune would rise on paper. I, however, have no stylistic nobility. My head hurts because my head hurts. The universe hurts me because my head hurts. But the universe that really hurts me is not the real one, the one that exists because it doesn't know I exist, but the one, mine of me, that, if I run my hands through my hair, makes me feel like they all suffer just to make me suffer.","My one desire is to die, at least temporarily, but this, as I said, is only because I have a headache. In this moment I suddenly think how much more nobly one of the great prose writers would put all this. Phrase by phrase, he would unwrap the anonymous pain of the world; inspired paragraphs would appear before his eyes that would conjure up all earthly human dramas and, out of the pounding of his fevered temples, he would construct a whole metaphysics of misfortune. I, however, lack all stylistic nobility. My head aches because it does. The universe hurts me because my head does. But the universe that really hurts me is not the real one, which exists because it does not know I exist, but my very own universe, which, if I run my fingers through my hair, seems to make me feel that each hair on my head suffers only in order to make me suffer.","What I feel like doing is dying, at least temporarily, but this, as I’ve indicated, is only because my head aches. And it suddenly occurs to me how much more eloquently a great prose stylist would say this. Sentence by sentence he would elaborate on the anonymous grief of the world; the imagining eyes behind his paragraphs would scan the earth’s various human dramas; and through the feverish throbbing of his temples an entire metaphysics of woe and misery would take shape on paper. But I don’t have an eloquent style. My head aches because my head aches. The universe hurts me because my head hurts. But the universe that actually hurts me is not the true one, which exists because it doesn’t know I exist, but that other universe which belongs only to me and which, should I pass my hands through my hair, makes me feel that each strand suffers for no other reason than to make me suffer."

I acquired in him such lucidity that I see every thing I dream as real. It was loss, therefore, all that he valued as a dream.","The pain of not understanding the mystery of life, the pain of being unloved, the pain of others’ injustice to us, the pain of life crushing us, suffocating and imprisoning us, the pain of toothache, of pinching shoes — who can say which pain he finds the worse, let alone which is worse for others, or worse for others in general?",Dreaming itself has become a torture. I’ve acquired such lucidity in my dreams that I see all dreamed things as real. And so all the value that they had as mere dreams has been lost.

"Era difícil dizer se o céu tinha nuvens ou antes névoa. Era um torpor baço, aqui e ali colorido, um acinzentamento imponderavelmente amarelado, salvo onde se esboroava em cor-de-rosa falso, ou onde estagnava azulescendo, mas aí não se distinguia se era o céu que se revelava, se era outro azul que o encobria.","It was hard to tell if the sky was cloudy or misty. It was a dull torpor, colored here and there, an imponderably yellowish gray, except where it faded into fake pink, or where it stagnated in blue, but there you couldn't tell if it was the sky that was revealing itself, if it was another blue that covered it up.","It was difficult to make out what it was covering the sky — clouds or mist. It was more like a dull torpor touched here and there by a little color, an odd yellowish gray except where this fragmented into a false pink or blue, but even then you couldn’t tell if it was the sky showing through or merely a layer of blue.","It was hard to tell if the sky was filled with clouds or fog. It was all a torpid haze that was coloured here and there, a greyness with just a hint of yellow, except where it had dissolved into a false pink or had bluely stagnated, though this blue may have been the sky showing through rather than another blue overlaying it."
"Cansamo-nos de tudo, excepto de compreender, disse o escoliasta.

Let's understand, let's always understand, and let's do it by craftily weaving chapels or wreaths that will also wither, the spectral flowers of that understanding.","My only nostalgias are literary ones. My eyes fill with tears at the memory of my childhood, but they are rhythmical tears in which some piece of prose is already in preparation.","We weary of everything, said the scholiast, except understanding.

"Há os que vencem no amor, há os que vencem na política, há os que vencem na arte. Os primeiros têm a vantagem da narrativa, pois se pode vencer largamente no amor sem haver conhecimento célebre do que sucedeu. É certo que, ao ouvir contar a qualquer desses indivíduos as suas Maratonas sexuais, uma vaga suspeita nos invade, pela altura do sétimo desfloramento.

The first group has the advantage of storytelling, since one can be highly successful in love without there being public knowledge of what happened. Of course, on hearing one of these men recount his sexual marathons, we begin to have our doubts after about the seventh conquest. Those who are the lovers of aristocratic or well-known ladies (and it seems to be the case for nearly all of them) ravage so many countesses that a tally of their conquests would shatter the gravity and composure of even the great-grandmothers of young women with titles."

Then I understood a phrase by Chateaubriand that had always deceived me for lack of experience of myself. Says Chateaubriand, appearing in René, “loving him tired him” — on le fatigait en l’aimant. I knew with amazement that this represented an experience identical to mine, and the truth of which I therefore had no right to deny.","At this moment, when I almost overflow with feeling, I would like to have the wit simply to speak out and have as my destiny the capricious freedom of a style.","But most of all I felt weariness – a weariness beyond all tedium. I finally understood a phrase of Chateaubriand whose meaning, because of my lack of personal experience, had always eluded me. Chateaubriand writes of René, his personification, ‘it wearied him to be loved’ – on le fatigait en l’aimant. I realized with astonishment that this experience was identical to my own, and so I couldn’t deny its validity."
"A leitura dos jornais, sempre penosa do ponto de ver estético, é-o frequentemente também do moral, ainda para quem tenha poucas preocupações morais.","Reading newspapers, always painful from an aesthetic point of view, is often also a moral one, even for those who have few moral concerns.","Much the same thing happens when, in the course of living, the soul, weighed down by life, feels the burden suddenly and inexplicably lift.","Reading the newspaper is always unpleasant from an aesthetic point of view, and often from a moral point of view as well, even for those who don’t worry much about morality."

É possível a certas almas sentir uma dor profunda por a paisagem pintada num abano chinês não ter três dimensões.,It is possible for certain souls to feel a deep pain because the landscape painted on a Chinese fan does not have three dimensions.,"Everything I see is, for me, the purely visible, be it the vast blue, green-tinged sky of the coming morning, be it the false grimace of pain on the face of someone watching the death of a loved one and aware that he is being watched.",Certain souls are capable of feeling heartfelt grief because the painted landscape on a Chinese fan isn’t three-dimensional.

"De tal modo anteponho o sonho à vida que consigo, no trato verbal (outro não tenho), continuar sonhando, e persistir, através das opiniões alheias e dos sentimentos dos outros, na linha fluida da minha individualidade amorfa.","In such a way I put the dream before life that I manage, in the verbal treatment (I don't have another one), to continue dreaming, and to persist, through the opinions of others and the feelings of others, in the fluid line of my amorphous individuality.","If I found the tree more interesting, I would grieve more over that tree being felled than over the man dying.","I’ve so favoured dreaming over real life that I’m able, in my verbal encounters (the only kind I have), to keep on dreaming and to keep following, through the opinions and feelings of others, the fluid course of my own amorphous personality."
"Estes homens, afinal, obtiveram tudo quanto a mão pode atingir, estendendo o braço. Variava neles o comprimento do braço; no resto eram iguais. Não consegui nunca ter inveja desta espécie de gente. Achei sempre que a virtude estava em obter o que não se alcançava, em viver onde se não está, em ser mais vivo depois de morto que quando se está vivo, em conseguir, enfim, qualquer coisa de difícil1, de absurdo, em vencer, como obstáculos, a própria realidade do mundo.","These men, after all, have gotten all the hand can reach by reaching out. The length of the arm varied in them; otherwise they were the same. I could never be envious of these kind of people. I always thought that virtue was in getting what you couldn't achieve, in living where you aren't, in being more alive after death than when you're alive, in achieving, in short, something difficult1, absurd, in winning, as obstacles, the very reality of the world.","295 [1930?] Sometimes I think I will never leave Rua dos Douradores. Once written down, that seems to me like eternity.","These men obtained all that their hand could grasp within arm’s reach. What varied in them was the length of their arm; they were identical in other respects. I’ve never been able to envy this sort of person. I’ve always felt that virtue lay in obtaining what was out of one’s reach, in living where one isn’t, in being more alive after death than during life, in achieving something impossible, something absurd, in overcoming – like an obstacle – the world’s very reality."
"Só o absoluto de Hegel conseguiu, em páginas, ser duas coisas ao mesmo tempo. O não-ser e o ser não se fundem e confundem nas sensações e razões da vida: excluem-se, por uma síntese às avessas.","Only Hegel's absolute managed, in pages, to be two things at once. The non-being and the being do not merge and confuse in the sensations and reasons of life: they exclude each other, by an inverted synthesis.","Happy the man most like the brute beasts because he effortlessly is what we all struggle to be; because he knows the way home which we find only through the byways of fiction and after much retracing of steps; because, rooted like a tree, he is part of the landscape and therefore part of its beauty and not, like us, a transient myth, a mannequin wearing the bright costumes of vanity and oblivion.","Only the absolute of Hegel managed to be two things at once, but in writing. Being and non-being do not mix and meld in the sensations and laws of life; they exclude one another, by a kind of reverse synthesis."
"Em todos os lugares da vida, em todas as situações e convivências, eu fui sempre, para todos, um intruso. Pelo menos, fui sempre um estranho. No meio de parentes, como no de conhecidos, fui sempre sentido como alguém de fora. Não digo que o fui, uma só vez sequer, de caso pensado. Mas fui-o sempre por uma atitude espontânea da média dos temperamentos alheios.","In all places of life, in all situations and coexistences, I have always been, for everyone, an intruder. At least, I've always been a stranger. In the midst of relatives, as with acquaintances, I was always felt as an outsider. I'm not saying that I was, even once, by design. But I have always been so because of a spontaneous attitude of the average of other people's temperaments.","[7 Apr 1933] Though I walked among them a stranger, no one noticed.","Throughout my life, in every situation and in every social circumstance, everyone has always seen me as an intruder. Or at least as a stranger. Whether among relatives or acquaintances, I’ve always been regarded as an outsider. I’m not suggesting that this treatment was ever deliberate. It was due, rather, to a natural reaction in the people around me."

"Os classificadores de coisas, que são aqueles homens de ciência cuja ciência é só classificar, ignoram, em geral, que o classificável é infinito e portanto se não pode classificar.

But my astonishment is that they ignore the existence of classifiable unknowns, things of the soul and consciousness that are in the interstices of knowledge.","[25 July 1932] Generally speaking, the classifiers of the world, those men of science whose only knowledge consists in their ability to classify, are ignorant of the fact that what is classifiable is infinite and therefore unclassifiable. But what amazes me most is that they know nothing of the existence of certain unknown classifiable categories, things of the soul and the consciousness that live in the interstices of knowledge.","The classifiers of things, by which I mean those scientists whose science is merely to classify, generally don’t realize that what’s classifiable is infinite and thus cannot be classified.

"A meio caminho entre a fé e a crítica está a estalagem da razão. A razão é a fé no que se pode compreender sem fé; mas é uma fé ainda, porque compreender envolve pressupor que há qualquer coisa compreensível.","Halfway between faith and criticism is the inn of reason. Reason is faith in what can be understood without faith; but it is still a faith, because understanding involves presupposing that there is something understandable.","In the vague shadows cast by the dying light before the evening turns to early darkness, I enjoy wandering, unthinking, through what the city is becoming, and I walk as if everything were lost.","On the road halfway between faith and criticism stands the inn of reason.

"Descobri que penso sempre, e atendo sempre, a duas coisas no mesmo tempo. Todos, suponho, serão um pouco assim. Há certas impressões tão vagas que só depois, porque nos lembramos delas, sabemos que as tivemos; dessas impressões, creio, se formará uma parte — a parte interna, talvez — da dupla atenção de todos os homens. Sucede comigo que têm igual relevo as duas realidades a que atendo. Nisto consiste a minha originalidade. Nisto, talvez, consiste a minha tragédia, e a comédia dela.","I have discovered that I always think, and always attend to, two things at the same time. Everyone, I suppose, will be a bit like that. There are certain impressions that are so vague that only afterwards, because we remember them, do we know that we had them; from these impressions, I believe, a part will form—the inner part, perhaps—of the double attention of all men. It happens to me that the two realities I attend to have equal importance. Therein lies my originality. In this, perhaps, consists my tragedy, and her comedy.","Yes, that’s an activity, a real fact about myself that distinguishes me from them. But in my soul I’m just the same. I know there are islands in the South and grand cosmopolitan passions and […] I’m sure that even if I held the world in my hand, I’d exchange it all for a tram ticket back to Rua dos Douradores. Perhaps it’s my destiny to remain a bookkeeper for ever and for poetry and literature to remain simply butterflies that alight on my head and merely underline my own ridiculousness by their very beauty. I would miss Moreira, but what does missing someone matter compared with a chance for real promotion?","I’ve discovered that I’m always attentive to, and always thinking about, two things at the same time. I suppose everyone is a bit like that. Certain impressions are so vague that only later, because we remember them, do we even realize we had them. I believe these impressions form a part – perhaps the internal part – of the dual attention we all possess. In my case the two realities that hold my attention are equally vivid.

"Com a morte? Não, nem com a morte. Quem vive como eu não morre: acaba, murcha, desvegeta-se. O lugar onde esteve fica sem ele ali estar, a rua por onde andava fica sem ele lá ser visto, a casa onde morava é habitada por não-ele. É tudo, e chamamos-lhe o nada; mas nem essa tragédia da negação podemos representar com aplauso, pois nem ao certo sabemos se é nada, vegetais da verdade como da vida, pó que tanto está por dentro como por fora das vidraças, netos do Destino e enteados de Deus, que casou com a Noite Eterna quando ela enviuvou do Caos que nos procriou7.","With death? No, not even with death. Whoever lives like me doesn't die: it ends, withers, withers. The place where he was is without him being there, the street where he walked is without him being seen there, the house where he lived is inhabited by not-him. It is everything, and we call it nothingness; but not even this tragedy of denial can we represent with applause, because we don't even know for sure if it's nothing, vegetables of truth and life, dust that is both inside and outside the windowpanes, grandchildren of Fate and stepchildren of God, who married the Eternal Night when she was widowed from the Chaos that begat us7.","The people in my dreams are not the same as those in real life. They are parallel. Each life — that of dreams and that of the world — has its own reality, the same but different. Like things that are close and things that are distant.

"A praia pequena, formando uma baía pequeníssima, excluída do mundo por dois promontórios em miniatura, era, naquelas férias de três dias, o meu retiro de mim mesmo. Descia-se para a praia por uma escada tosca, que começava, em cima, em escada de madeira, e a meio se tornava em recorte de degraus na rocha, com corrimão de ferro ferrugento. E, sempre que eu descia a escada velha, e sobretudo da pedra aos pés para baixo, saía da minha própria existência, encontrando-me.","The small beach, forming a tiny bay, excluded from the world by two miniature promontories, was, on that three-day vacation, my retreat from myself. You went down to the beach by a crude staircase, which started at the top with a wooden staircase, and halfway down it became a cutout of steps in the rock, with a rusty iron handrail. And whenever I went down the old stairs, and especially from the stone to the feet down, I came out of my own existence, finding myself.","And in the depths of my soul — the only reality of the moment — there is an intense, invisible pain, a sadness like the sound of someone weeping in a dark room.","The small cove with its small beach, cut off from the world by two miniature promontories, was my retreat from myself during those three days of holiday. The beach was reached by a crudely built stairway that began with wooden steps at the top and continued, halfway down, with steps cut directly into the rock, with a rusty iron handrail for support. And each time I went down that old stairway, and especially on the part made of stone, I stepped out of my own existence and found myself."
"Quando o estio entra entristeço. Parece que a luminosidade, ainda que acre, das horas estivais devera acarinhar quem não sabe quem é. Mas não, a mim não me acarinha. Há um contraste demasiado entre a vida externa que exubera e o que sinto e penso, sem saber sentir nem pensar — o cadáver perenemente insepulto das minhas sensações. Tenho a impressão de que vivo, nesta pátria informe chamada o universo, sob uma tirania política que, ainda que me não oprima directamente, todavia ofende qualquer oculto princípio da minha alma. E então desce em mim, surdamente, lentamente, a saudade antecipada do exílio impossível.","When summer comes, I'm sad. It seems that the light, albeit acrid, of the summer hours should caress those who don't know who they are. But no, I don't care. There is too much contrast between the external life that exudes and what I feel and think, without knowing how to feel or think — the perennially unburied corpse of my sensations. I have the impression that I live, in this formless country called the universe, under a political tyranny which, although it does not directly oppress me, nevertheless offends some hidden principle of my soul. And then descends on me, deafly, slowly, the anticipated longing for the impossible exile.","[9 June 1934] With the beginning of summer I grow sad. One would think that the brilliance of summer hours, however harsh, would seem sweet to someone ignorant of his own identity. But that’s not the case with me. There is too sharp a contrast between all that exuberant outer life and what I feel and think, without knowing how to feel or think — the perennially unburied corpse of my feelings. I have the impression that, in this formless homeland called the universe, I live beneath a political tyranny which, although it does not oppress me directly, still offends some hidden principle of my soul. And then slowly, secretly, there grows within me the anticipated nostalgia of an impossible exile.","The advent of summer makes me sad. It seems that summer’s luminosity, though harsh, should comfort those who don’t know who they are, but it doesn’t comfort me. There’s too sharp a contrast between the teeming life outside me and the forever unburied corpse of my sensations – what I feel and think, without knowing how to feel or think. In this borderless country known as the universe, I feel like I’m living under a political tyranny that doesn’t oppress me directly but that still offends some secret principle of my soul.

A posse de um corpo lindo não abraça a beleza, abraça a carne celulada e gordurosa; o beijo não toca na beleza da boca, mas na carne húmida dos lábios perecíveis e mucosas; a própria cópula é um contacto apenas, um contacto esfregado e próximo, mas não uma penetração real, sequer de um corpo por outro corpo… Que possuímos nós? que possuímos?","What do we own? what do we own?

Tal homem, que toda a vida falou da inconstância e da volubilidade femininas como de coisas naturais e típicas, terá toda a angústia da surpresa triste quando se encontre traído em amor — tal qual, não outro, como se tivesse sempre tido por dogma ou esperança a fidelidade e a firmeza da mulher. Tal outro, que tem tudo por oco e vazio, sentirá como um raio súbito a descoberta de que têm por nada o que escreve, de que é estéril o seu esforço por ensinar, de que é falsa a comunicabilidade da sua emoção.","The human soul is such an inevitable victim of pain that it suffers the pain of painful surprise even with what it should expect. Such a man, who all his life spoke of female inconstancy and volubility as natural and typical things, will have all the anguish of sad surprise when he finds himself betrayed in love - just like, no other, as if he had always held it for dogma or hope woman's fidelity and firmness. Another person, who considers everything hollow and empty, will feel like a sudden lightning the discovery that what he writes is for nothing, that his effort to teach is sterile, that the communicability of his emotion is false.","What would happen to all those happy couples if they could see into each other’s soul, if they could understand each other, as the romantics say, unaware of the danger (albeit futile) in their words? Every married couple in the world is a mismatch because each person harbors, in the secret part of the soul that belongs to the Devil, the subtle image of the man they desire but who is not their husband, the nubile figure of the sublime woman their wife never was. The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","The human soul is so inevitably the victim of pain that is suffers the pain of the painful surprise even with things it should have expected. A man who has always spoken of fickleness and unfaithfulness as perfectly normal behaviour in women will feel all the devastation of the sad surprise when he discovers that his sweetheart has been cheating on him, exactly as if he’d always held up female fidelity and constancy as a dogma or a rightful expectation. Another man, convinced that everything is hollow and empty, will feel like he’s been struck by lightning when he learns that what he writes is considered worthless, or that his efforts to educate people are in vain, or that it’s impossible to communicate his emotion."
"É um humanitarismo directo, sem conclusões nem propósitos, o que me assalta neste momento. Sofro uma ternura como se um deus visse. Vejo-os a todos através de uma compaixão de único consciente, os pobres diabos homens, o pobre diabo humanidade. O que está tudo isto a fazer aqui?","It is a direct humanitarianism, without conclusions or purposes, which assails me at this moment. I suffer a tenderness as if a god saw. I see them all through a single conscious compassion, the poor devil men, the poor devil humanity. What is all this doing here?",I think what creates in me the deep sense I have of living out of step with others is the fact that most people think with their feelings whereas I feel with my thoughts.,"It’s an immediate humanitarianism, without aims or conclusions, that overwhelms me right now. I feel a tenderness as if I were seeing with the eyes of a god. I see everyone as if moved by the compassion of the world’s only conscious being. Poor hapless men, poor hapless humanity! What are they all doing here?"

"Na tarde em que escrevo, o dia de chuva parou. Uma alegria do ar é fresca de mais contra a pele. O dia vai acabando não em cinzento, mas em azul-pálido. Um azul vago reflecte-se, mesmo, nas pedras das ruas. Dói viver, mas é de longe. Sentir não importa. Acende-se uma ou outra montra. Em uma outra janela alta há gente que vê acabarem o trabalho. O mendigo que roça por mim pasmaria, se me conhecesse.","On the afternoon I write, the rainy day has stopped. A joy in the air is too fresh against the skin. The day ends not in gray but in pale blue. A vague blue is even reflected in the stones of the streets. It hurts to live, but it's from afar. Feel doesn't matter. One or another window lights up. In another high window there are people watching the work finish. The beggar who brushes by me would be amazed if he knew me.","Unknowingly, I have been a witness to the gradual wasting away of my life, to the slow shipwreck of everything I ever wanted to be.","On the afternoon in which I write, the rain has finally let up. A gladness in the air feels almost too cool against the skin. The day is ending not in grey but in pale blue. A hazy blue is even reflecting off the stones of the street. It hurts to live, but the pain is remote. Feeling doesn’t matter. One or another shop window lights up. In a window higher up, there are people looking down at the workers who are finishing up for the day. The beggar who brushes my shoulder would be shocked if he knew me."
"A rua franziu-se de luz intensa e pálida, e o negrume baço3 tremeu, de leste a oeste do mundo, com um estrondo feito de escangalhamentos ecoantes… A tristeza dura da chuva bruta piorou o ar negro de intensidade feia. Frio, morno, quente — tudo ao mesmo tempo —, o ar em toda a parte era errado. E, a seguir, pela ampla sala uma cunha de luz metálica abriu brecha nos repousos dos corpos humanos, e, com o sobressalto gelado, um pedregulho de som bateu em toda a parte, esfacelando-se com silêncio duro4. O som da chuva diminui como uma voz de menos peso5. O ruído das ruas diminui angustiantemente. Nova luz, de um amarelado rápido, tolda o negrume surdo, mas houve agora uma respiração possível antes que o punho do som trémulo ecoasse súbito doutro ponto; como uma despedida zangada, a trovoada começava a aqui não estar.","The street wrinkled with intense pale light, and the dull blackness trembled, from east to west of the world, with a roar made of echoing rumblings… The harsh sadness of the raw rain made the black air worse with ugly intensity. Cold, warm, hot—all at the same time—the air everywhere was wrong. And then, across the wide room, a wedge of metallic light breached the reposes of human bodies, and, with the icy start, a boulder of sound hit everywhere, shattering with hard silence. The sound of rain diminishes like a voice of less weight5. Street noise diminishes distressingly. New light, rapidly yellowing, clouds the dull blackness, but there was now a breath possible before the fist of trembling sound suddenly echoed from elsewhere; like an angry farewell, the thunder began to not be here.","my childhood, lived somewhere in the distance, that night’s","The street winced in the stark white light, and the dull darkness trembled all around the world with a boom of echoing crashes. The harsh sadness of the heavy rain accentuated the air’s ugly black hue. Cold and warm and hot at the same time, the air was everywhere equivocal. Then a wedge of metallic light entered the large office, ripping into the peace of each human body, and a huge rock of sound struck with a chill shock on all sides, shattering into a hard silence. The sound of rain diminishes, becoming a soft voice. The noise from the street diminishes out of fear. A new light spreads its swift yellow over the silent darkness, but breathing was again possible before the fist of rumbling sound abruptly echoed from afar; like an angry farewell, the storm was beginning to draw away."

I feel sorry for myself that this didn't happen to me!,"[15 May 1932] Nothing weighs so heavily on one as other people’s affections, not even hate, because hate is more intermittent than affection; being a disagreeable emotion, it tends instinctively to be less frequent among those who feel it.",If only I had been the Madame of a harem!

"Não sei se estes sentimentos são uma loucura lenta do desconsolo, se são reminiscências de qualquer outro mundo em que houvéssemos estado — reminiscências cruzadas e misturadas, como coisas vistas em sonhos, absurdas na figura que vemos mas não na origem se a soubéssemos. Não sei se houve outros seres que fomos, cuja maior completidão sentimos hoje, na sombra que deles somos, de uma maneira incompleta — perdida a solidez e nós figurando-no-la mal nas só duas dimensões da sombra que vivemos.","I don't know if these feelings are a slow madness of disconsolation, if they are reminiscences of some other world we had been in - reminiscences crossed and mixed together, like things seen in dreams, absurd in the figure we see but not in origin if we knew it.

I don’t know if we were once other beings, whose greater completeness we sense only incompletely today, being mere shadows of what they were, beings that have lost their solidity in our feeble two-dimensional imaginings of them among the shadows we inhabit.","I don’t know if these feelings are a slow madness born of disconsolation or if they’re reminiscences of some other world in which we’ve lived – jumbled, criss-crossing remembrances, like things seen in dreams, absurd in the form they come to us but not in their origin, if we knew what it was. I don’t know if we weren’t in fact other beings, whose greater completeness we can sense today, incompletely, forming at best a sketchy notion of their lost solidity in the two dimensions of our present lives, mere shadows of what they were."

"Cheguei à janela com os olhos quentes de não estarem fechados. Por sobre os telhados densos a luz fazia diferenças de amarelo pálido. Fiquei a contemplar tudo com a grande estupidez da falta de sono. Nos vultos erguidos das casas altas o amarelo era aéreo e nulo. Ao fundo do ocidente, para onde eu estava virado, o horizonte era já de um branco verde.","I reached the window with my eyes hot from not being closed. Over the dense roofs the light cast a pale yellow difference. I watched it all with the great stupidity of lack of sleep. In the raised figures of the tall houses the yellow was airy and null. In the far west, where I was facing, the horizon was already a white green.","If I possessed the impossible landscapes, what would remain of the impossible? May I always be blessed with the monotony, the dull sameness of identical days, my indistinguishable todays and yesterdays, so that I may enjoy with an open heart the fly that distracts me, drifting randomly past my eyes, the gust of laughter that wafts volubly up from the street somewhere down below, the sense of vast freedom when the office closes for the night, and the infinite leisure of my days off.","I walked to the window with eyes that were burning from having stayed open all night. The light reflected off the crowded rooftops in various shades of pale yellow. I contemplated everything with the grand stupidity that comes from not sleeping. The yellow was wispy and insignificant against the hulking figures of the tall buildings. Far off in the west (the direction I was facing), the horizon was already a greenish white."

"Dizem os ocultistas, ou alguns deles, que há momentos supremos da alma em que ela recorda, com a emoção ou com parte da memória, um momento, ou um aspecto, ou uma sombra, de uma encarnação anterior. E então, como regressa a um tempo que está mais próximo que o seu presente da origem e do começo das coisas, sente, em certo modo, uma infância e uma libertação.","The occultists, or some of them, say that there are supreme moments of the soul when it remembers, with emotion or with part of memory, a moment, or an aspect, or a shadow, of a previous incarnation. And then, as he returns to a time that is closer than his present to the origin and beginning of things, he feels, in a way, a childhood and a release.","And in the depths of my soul — the only reality of the moment — there is an intense, invisible pain, a sadness like the sound of someone weeping in a dark room.","Occultists say (or at least some of them do) that the soul has supreme moments when it recalls, with the emotions or with some part of memory, a moment or an aspect or a shadow from a previous incarnation. And since the soul returns to a time that is closer than the present to the beginning and origin of things, it experiences a sensation of childhood and of liberation."
"Posso pensar em dormir. Posso sonhar de sonhar. Vejo mais claro a objectividade de tudo. Uso com mais conforto o sentimento externo da vida. E tudo isto, efectivamente, porque, ao chegar quase à esquina, um virar no ar da brisa me alegra a superfície da pele.","I can think about sleeping. I can dream of dreaming. I see more clearly the objectivity of everything. I use more comfortably the external feeling of life. And all this, in fact, because, when I almost reach the corner, a turn in the air of the breeze makes the surface of my skin happy.","I can think about sleeping. I can dream about dreaming.

"Um desespero de mim, uma angústia de existir preso a mim extravasa-se por mim todo sem me exceder, compondo-me o ser em ternura, medo, dor e desolação.","A despair of me, an anguish of existing trapped in me overflows all over me without exceeding myself, composing my being in tenderness, fear, pain and desolation.","Between myself and life there have always been panes of opaque glass, undetectable to me by sight or touch; I never actually lived life according to a plan, I was the daydream of what I wanted to be, my dream began in my will, my goal was always the first fiction of what I never was. I never knew if my sensibility was too advanced for my intelligence or my intelligence too advanced for my sensibility.

"Convalescemos. Em geral somos criaturas que não aprendemos nenhuma arte ou ofício, nem sequer o de gozar a vida. Estranhos a convívios demorados, aborrecemo-nos em geral dos maiores amigos, depois de estarmos com eles meia hora; só ansiamos por os ver quando pensamos em vê-los, e as melhores horas em que os acompanhamos são aquelas em que apenas sonhamos que estamos com eles. Não sei se isto indica pouca amizade. Porventura não indica. O que é certo é que as coisas que mais amamos, ou julgamos amar, só têm o seu pleno valor real quando simplesmente sonhadas.","We convalesce. In general, we are creatures who have not learned any art or craft, not even that of enjoying life. Strangers to long meetings, we are generally bored with our closest friends, after spending half an hour with them; we only look forward to seeing them when we think of seeing them, and the best times when we accompany them are those when we only dream that we are with them. I don't know if this indicates little friendship. Maybe it doesn't. What is certain is that the things we love the most, or we think we love, only have their full real value when they are simply dreamed of.",,"We’re convalescents. Most of us are people who never learned an art or a trade, not even the art of enjoying life. Since we’re basically averse to prolonged social contact, even the greatest of friends tend to bore us after half an hour; we long to see them only when we think about seeing them, and the best moments we spend with them occur in our dreams. I don’t know if this is indicative of superficial friendship. Perhaps not. What I do know is that the things we love, or think we love, have their full weight and worth only when simply dreamed."

"Depois que o calor cessou, e o princípio leve da chuva cresceu para ouvir-se, ficou no ar uma tranquilidade que o ar do calor não tinha, uma nova paz em que a água punha uma brisa sua. Tão clara era a alegria desta chuva branda, sem tempestade nem escuridão, que aqueles mesmos, que eram quase todos, que não tinham guarda-chuva ou roupa de defesa, estavam rindo a falar no seu passo rápido pela rua lustrosa.","After the heat had stopped, and the light beginning of the rain had grown to be heard, there was a tranquility in the air that the air of heat did not have, a new peace in which the water put a breeze of its own. So clear was the joy of this gentle rain, without storm or darkness, that those same people, who were almost all of them, who had no umbrella or protective clothing, were laughing and talking as they walked quickly along the shiny street.","Once the heat had passed and the first light spots of rain began to fall heavily enough to make themselves heard, there was a quietness in the air that had been absent from the earlier heat, a new peace into which the rain introduced a breeze all its own. Such was the bright, sheer joy of that soft rain, with no storms or dark skies, that even those who had come out without umbrellas or waterproof clothing, almost everyone in fact, laughed as they hurried, chattering, down the shining street.","After the heat had lulled and the light beginning of rain increased until it could be heard, there was a tranquillity that the air didn’t have when it was hot, a new peace in which the water blew its own breeze. So clear was the joy of this soft rain, with no darkness or threat of storm, that even those without raincoats or umbrellas (which was almost everyone) laughingly talked as they stepped quickly down the glistening street."
"Outros entregaram-se, atarefados por fora da alma, ao culto da confusão e do ruído, julgando viver quando se ouviam, crendo amar quando chocavam contra as exterioridades do amor. Viver doía-nos, porque sabíamos que estávamos vivos; morrer não nos aterrava porque tínhamos perdido a noção normal da morte.","Others gave themselves up, busy outside their souls, to the cult of confusion and noise, thinking they were alive when they heard each other, believing they loved when they collided with the externals of love. Living hurt us, because we knew we were alive; dying didn't terrify us because we had lost the normal notion of death.","I find those last two things particularly unsettling — the way certain men arrogantly believe that, by reaching an understanding with Gods or Masters or Demiurges, they will discover — keeping their discovery to themselves, of course, and excluding the rest of us — the great secrets that are the very foundations of this world. I can’t believe that to be true, but I can believe that someone else might.","Still others, busy on the outside of the soul, devoted themselves to the cult of noise and confusion, thinking they were living whenever they heard themselves, and supposing they loved whenever they brushed love’s outward forms.

We write and we lose; we add and pass; we close the balance and the invisible balance is always against us.","How often, weighed down by a tedium that verges on madness, or an anguish that seems to go beyond all anguish, do I stop and hesitate before I rebel, do I hesitate and stop before making myself a god.",All of us who dream and think are assistant bookkeepers in a fabric warehouse or in some other business in this or another downtown.

"A quem, como eu, assim, vivendo não sabe ter vida, que resta senão, como a meus poucos pares, a renúncia por modo e a contemplação por destino? Não sabendo o que é a vida religiosa, nem podendo sabê-lo, porque se não tem fé com a razão; não podendo ter fé na abstracção do homem, nem sabendo mesmo que fazer dela perante nós, ficava-nos, como motivo de ter alma, a contemplação estética da vida. E, assim, alheios à solenidade de todos os mundos, indiferentes ao divino e desprezadores do humano, entregamo-nos futilmente à sensação sem propósito, cultivada num epicurismo subtilizado, como convém aos nossos nervos cerebrais.","Who, like me, living like this, doesn't know how to have life, what remains but, like my few peers, renunciation by way and contemplation by destiny? Not knowing what the religious life is, nor being able to know it, because one does not have faith with reason; not being able to have faith in man's abstraction, not even knowing what to do with it before us, we were left, as a reason for having a soul, the aesthetic contemplation of life. And so, oblivious to the solemnity of all worlds, indifferent to the divine and despising the human, we give ourselves futilely to senseless sensation, cultivated in a subtle epicureanism, as befits our cerebral nerves.","To someone like myself, and to the few like me who live without knowing they live, what remains except renunciation as a way of life and contemplation as destiny? Ignorant of the meaning of a religious life and unable to discover it through reason, unable to have faith in the abstract concept of man and not even knowing what to do with it, all that remains for us as a justification for having a soul is the aesthetic contemplation of life. And so, insensitive to the solemnity of the world, indifferent to the divine and despising humankind, we give ourselves vainly over to a purposeless sensationism crossed with a refined form of epicureanism suited to our cerebral nerves.","For those few like me who live without knowing how to have life, what’s left but renunciation as our way and contemplation as our destiny?

"Mas o criticismo frustre dos nossos pais, se nos legou a impossibilidade de ser cristão, não nos legou o contentamento com que a tivéssemos; se nos legou a descrença nas fórmulas morais estabelecidas, não nos legou a indiferença à moral e às regras de viver humanamente; se deixou incerto o problema político, não deixou indiferente o nosso espírito a como esse problema se resolvesse. Nossos pais destruíram contentemente, porque viviam numa época que tinha ainda reflexos da solidez do passado. Era aquilo mesmo que eles destruíam que dava força à sociedade para que pudessem destruir sem sentir o edifício rachar-se. Nós herdámos a destruição e os seus resultados.","But the frustrated criticism of our parents, if it bequeathed us the impossibility of being a Christian, did not bequeath us the contentment with which we had it; if disbelief in established moral formulas bequeathed us, it did not bequeath us indifference to morals and the rules of human living; if it left the political problem uncertain, it did not leave our spirit indifferent to how this problem was resolved. Our parents happily destroyed, because they lived in a time that still had reflections of the solidity of the past. It was the very thing they destroyed that gave society strength so that they could destroy without feeling the building crack. We have inherited destruction and its results.","In the vague shadows cast by the dying light before the evening turns to early darkness, I enjoy wandering, unthinking, through what the city is becoming, and I walk as if everything were lost.","But while the sloppy criticism of our fathers bequeathed us the impossibility of being Christians, it didn’t bequeath us an acceptance of the impossibility; while it bequeathed us a disbelief in established moral codes, it didn’t bequeath us an indifference to morality and the rules for peaceful human coexistence; while it left the thorny problem of politics in doubt, it didn’t leave our minds unconcerned about how to solve it. Our fathers blithely wreaked destruction, for they lived in a time that was still informed by the solidity of the past. The very thing they destroyed was what gave strength to society and enabled them to destroy without noticing that the building was cracking. We inherited the destruction and its aftermath."

Não é que o passo me diga quem é que vem, nem que me lembre o passo deste ou daquele que eu conheça.

"Como uma esperança negra, qualquer coisa de mais antecipador pairou: a mesma chuva pareceu intimidar-se; um negrume surdo calou-se sobre o ambiente. E súbito, como um grito, um formidável dia estilhaçou-se. Uma luz de inferno frio1 visitara o conteúdo de tudo, e enchera os cérebros e os recantos. Tudo pasmou. Um peso caiu2 de tudo porque o golpe passara. A chuva triste3 era alegre com o seu ruído bruto e humilde4. Sem querer, o coração sentia-se e pensar era um estonteamento.

A weight fell from everything because the blow had passed. The sad rain3 was happy with its raw and humble noise4. Without meaning to, the heart felt and thinking was dizzying. A vague religion was forming in the office. Nobody was who they were, and boss Vasques appeared at the office door to think about saying something. Moreira smiled, with the yellowness of sudden fear still around his face. And his smile said that without a doubt the next thunder should be farther away.

A swift wagon loudly broke in on the usual noises from the street. The telephone shivered uncontrollably. Instead of retreating to his private office, Vasques stepped towards the phone in the common office. There was a respite, a silence, and the rain fell like a nightmare.

"Nesses momentos, em que compreenderia os ascetas e os retirados, se houvesse em mim poder de compreender os que se empenham em qualquer esforço com fins absolutos, ou em qualquer crença capaz de produzir um esforço, eu criaria, se pudesse, toda uma estética da desconsolação, uma rítmica íntima de balada de berço, coada pelas ternuras da noite em grandes afastamentos de outros lares.","In those moments, when I would understand the ascetics and the withdrawn, if I had the power to understand those who engage in any effort with absolute ends, or in any belief capable of producing an effort, I would create, if I could, an entire aesthetic of disconsolation, an intimate rhythm of a cradle ballad, strained by the tenderness of the night in great distances from other homes.","Others will lean from the same windows; those who have forgotten about shadowy fears are sleeping, nostalgic for the sun they never knew; and I myself, who dares but does not act, will end up, with no regrets, among those soggy reeds made muddy by the nearby river and by my own flaccid inertia, beneath the vast autumn skies of evening, in impossibly far-flung places.","In times like these – when I could readily understand ascetics and recluses, were I able to understand how anyone can make an effort on behalf of absolute ends or subscribe to a creed that might produce an effort – I would create, if I could, a full-fledged aesthetics of despair, an inner rhythm like a crib’s rocking, filtered by the night’s caresses in other, far-flung homelands."
"Estas duas verdades são irredutíveis uma à outra. O sábio abster-se-á de as querer conjugar, e abster-se-á também de repudiar uma ou outra.

The sage will refrain from wishing to combine them, and will also refrain from repudiating one or the other. You will, however, have to follow one, longing for the one that doesn't; or repudiate both, rising above yourself in a nirvana of your own.","Vieira’s famous passage on King Solomon. “Solomon built a palace …” I read on to the end, trembling and confused, then burst into joyful tears that no real happiness could have provoked, tears that no sadness in my life will ever provoke. The stately rhythm of our clear, majestic language, the expression of ideas in words that flowed as inevitably as water down a hillside, that vocalic thrill by which every sound takes on its ideal color: all this intoxicated me as instinctively as some great political passion.","These two truths are mutually exclusive. The wise man won’t try to reconcile them, nor will he dismiss one or the other.

If I lift up my eyes from my thinking, they smart at the sight of the world."
"Isto irritava-me antigamente, porque supunha, como os ingénuos, e eu era ingénuo, que esse sorriso dado às preocupações de sonhar e dizer era um eflúvio de uma sensação íntima de superioridade. É somente um estalido de diferença. E se antigamente eu considerava esse sorriso como um insulto, porque implicasse uma superioridade, hoje considero-o como uma dúvida inconsciente; como os homens adultos muitas vezes reconhecem nas crianças uma agudeza de espírito superior à própria, assim nos reconhecem, a nós que sonhamos e o dizemos, uma qualquer coisa diferente de que eles desconfiam como estranha. Quero crer que, muitas vezes, os mais inteligentes deles entrevejam a nossa superioridade; e então sorriem superiormente, para esconder que a entrevêem.","This annoyed me in the past, because I assumed, like the naive, and I was naive, that this smile given to the worries of dreaming and saying was an effluvia of an intimate feeling of superiority. It's just a click of difference. And if in the past I considered that smile an insult, because it implied superiority, today I consider it an unconscious doubt; just as grown men often recognize in children an acuteness of mind superior to their own, so we, who dream and say it, recognize something different that they distrust as strange. I want to believe that the most intelligent of them often glimpse our superiority; and then they smile superiorly, to hide that they catch a glimpse of her.","This used to irritate me because I thought ingenuously — for I was ingenuous then — that the smile they bestowed on other people’s preoccupation with dreaming and with describing their dreams was the effluvium of a deep sense of superiority. In fact, it’s just a blunt recognition of difference. And while I used to consider that smile an insult because it implied some kind of superiority, now I consider it to be the admission of an unconscious doubt; just as grown men often recognize in children a sharper wit than their own, so they recognize in us, in those who dream and speak of our dreams, a difference that they distrust because it is strange. I’d like to think that often the more intelligent among them glimpse our superiority and then smile in order to conceal that fact.","This used to irritate me, because I naïvely assumed that this outward smile directed at dreaming and self-expression sprang from an inner conviction of superiority. In fact it’s only a reaction to something that’s different. While I once took this smile as an insult, because it seemed to imply a superior attitude, today I see it as the sign of an unconscious doubt. Just as adults often recognize in children a quick-wittedness they don’t have, so the smilers recognize in us, who are devoted to dreaming and expressing, something different that makes them suspicious, just because it’s unfamiliar. I like to think that the smartest among them sometimes detect our superiority, and then smile in a superior way to hide the fact."

"Uma das minhas preocupações constantes é o compreender como é que outra gente existe, como é que há almas que não sejam a minha, consciências estranhas à minha consciência que, por ser consciência, me parece ser a única. Compreendo bem que o homem que está diante de mim, e me fala com palavras iguais às minhas, e me faz gestos que são como eu faço ou poderia fazer, seja de algum modo meu semelhante. O mesmo, porém, me sucede com as gravuras que sonho das ilustrações, com as personagens que vejo dos romances, com as pessoas dramáticas que no palco passam1 através dos actores que as figuram.","One of my constant concerns is to understand how other people exist, how there are souls that are not mine, consciences that are foreign to my conscience, which, being conscience, seems to me to be the only one. I understand very well that the man who stands in front of me, and speaks to me in words similar to mine, and makes gestures to me that are as I do or could do, is in some way my fellow man. The same, however, happens to me with the engravings that I dream of in illustrations, with the characters I see in novels, with the dramatic people who on stage pass through the actors who portray them.","I realize that I am the same as I was. And, having often thought that to get to where I am now I must have progressed a lot from what I was , I wonder in what that progress consists if I was the same then as I am now. There’s a mystery in this that undermines and oppresses me.","One of my constant preoccupations is to understand how other people can exist, how there can be souls that aren’t mine, consciousnesses that have nothing to do with my own, which – because it’s a consciousness – seems to me like the only one. I accept that the man standing before me, who speaks with words like mine and gesticulates as I do or could do, is in some sense my fellow creature. But so are the figures from illustrations that fill my imagination, the characters I meet in novels, and the dramatic personae that move on stage through the actors who represent them."
"Mas é o fumo do cigarro o que mais espiritualmente me reconstrói momentos passados. Ele apenas roça a minha consciência de ter paladar. Por isso mais em grupo e transferência me evoca as horas que morri, mais longínquas as faz presentes, mais nevoentas quando me envolvem, mais etéreas quando as corporizo. Um cigarro ao mentol, um charuto barato toldam de suavidade alguns meus momentos. Com que subtil plausibilidade de sabor-aroma reergo os cenários mortos e empresto outra vez as cores de um passado, tão século dezoito sempre pelo afastamento malicioso e cansado, tão medievais sempre pelo irremediavelmente perdido.","But it is the cigarette smoke that most spiritually reconstructs past moments for me. It just brushes against my awareness of having taste. That's why, more as a group and transference, it evokes in me the hours I died, the more distant it makes them present, more hazy when they envelop me, more ethereal when I embody them. A cigarette with menthol, a cheap cigar cloud some of my moments with softness. With what subtle plausibility of flavor-aroma I raise the dead scenarios and lend again the colors of a past, so eighteenth century always for the malicious and tired distance, so medieval always for the irretrievably lost.","From my vantage point of today, looking back at that past, which I no longer know whether to describe as remote or recent, I think it was a good thing to have experienced that disappointment so early. It was nothing really, except what I felt at the time. From an objective point of view, legions of men have been through the same torments.","But it’s cigarette smoke that most subtly, spiritually, reconstructs my past. Since it just barely grazes my awareness of taste, it evokes the moments to which I’ve died in a more general way, by a kind of displacement; it makes them more remotely present, more like mist when they envelop me, more ethereal when I embody them. A menthol cigarette or a cheap cigar wraps certain of my moments in a sweet softness. With what subtle plausibility – taste combined with smell – I recreate the dead stage settings and reinvest them with the colours of a past, always so eighteenth century in its weary and mischievous aloofness, always so medieval in its irreparable lostness!"

"Nas paredes escuramente visíveis do meu quarto, se eu abria os olhos do sono falso, boiavam fragmentos de sonhos por fazer, vagas luzes, riscos pretos, coisas de nada que trepavam e desciam. Os móveis, maiores do que de dia, manchavam vagamente o absurdo da treva. A porta era indicada por qualquer coisa nem mais branca, nem mais preta do que a noite, mas diferente.

"Há um sono da atenção voluntária, que não sei explicar, e que frequentemente me ataca, se de coisa tão esbatida se pode dizer que ataca alguém. Sigo por uma rua como quem está sentado, e a minha atenção, desperta a tudo, tem todavia a inércia de um repouso do corpo inteiro. Não seria capaz de me desviar conscientemente de um transeunte oposto. Não seria capaz de responder com palavras, ou sequer, dentro em mim, com pensamentos, a uma pergunta de qualquer casual que fizesse escala pela minha casualidade coincidente. Não seria capaz de ter um desejo, uma esperança, uma coisa qualquer que representasse um movimento, não já da vontade do meu ser completo, mas até, se assim posso dizer, da vontade parcial e própria de cada elemento em que sou decomponível. Não seria capaz de pensar, de sentir, de querer. E ando, sigo, vagueio. Nada nos meus movimentos (reparo por o que os outros não reparam) transfere para o observável o estado de estagnação em que vou. E este estado de falta de alma, que seria cómodo, porque certo, num deitado ou num recumbente, é singularmente incómodo, doloroso até, num homem que vai andando pela rua.","There is a sleep of voluntary attention, which I cannot explain, and which often attacks me, if something so faint can be said to attack someone. I walk down the street as if I were sitting down, and my attention, awakens to everything, nevertheless has the inertia of a rest of the whole body. I wouldn't be able to consciously dodge an opposing passerby. I wouldn't be able to answer with words, or even, inside me, with thoughts, to a question from any chance that made a stopover by my coincidental chance. I would not be able to have a desire, a hope, anything that could represent a movement, not of the will of my complete being, but even, if I may say so, of the partial and proper will of each element into which I am decomposable. I wouldn't be able to think, feel, want. And I walk, I follow, I wander. Nothing in my movements (I notice what others don't notice) transfers the state of stagnation I'm in to the observable. And this state of lack of soul, which would be comfortable, because certainly, when lying down or recumbent, is singularly uncomfortable, even painful, in a man walking down the street.","[c. 23 Mar 1930] Having nothing to do or to even think of doing, I am going to set down on this piece of paper a description of my ideal: A note. The sensibility of Mallarmé in the style of Vieira; to dream like Verlaine in the body of Horace; to be Homer by moonlight. To feel everything in all possible ways; to be able to think with the emotions and feel with the intellect; to desire nothing very much except with the imagination; to suffer coquettishly; to see clearly in order to write precisely; to know oneself through simulation and tactics; to become naturalized as an entirely different person, with all the correct documentation; in short, to experience all sensations inside oneself, stripping them down to God, but wrapping them up again and putting them back in the shop window just as the sales assistant I can see now is doing with small tins of a new brand of shoe polish. Whether possible or impossible, they all come to nothing, these ideals, and if there were any others, I’ve forgotten them. I have reality before me — and it isn’t even the sales assistant, but the isolated creature that is his hands, the absurd tentacle of a soul with a family and a fate making the gestures of a spider without a web as it reaches into the window opposite. And then one of the tins fell, like this note of mine. 226 [c. 23 Mar 1930] The office boy was tying up the day’s parcels in the crepuscular cool of the vast office.","There’s a sleepiness of our conscious attention that I can’t explain but that often attacks me, if something so hazy can be said to attack. I’ll be walking down a street as if I were sitting down, and my attention, although alert to everything, will have the inertia of a body completely at rest. I would be incapable of deliberately stepping aside for an approaching passer-by. I would be incapable of responding with words, or even with thoughts inside my mind, to a question asked me by a random stranger who happened to cross paths with my random presence. I would be incapable of having a desire, a hope, or anything at all representing a movement of my general will or even – if I may so speak – of the partial will belonging to each of my component parts. I would be incapable of thinking, of feeling, of wanting. And I walk, I roam, I keep going. Nothing in my movements (I notice by what others don’t notice) transmits my state of stagnation to the observable plane. And this spiritless state, which would be natural and therefore comfortable in someone lying down or reclining, is singularly uncomfortable, even painful, in a man walking down the street."

"Conformar-se é submeter-se e vencer é conformar-se, ser vencido. Por isso toda a vitória é uma grosseria.

Ficam satisfeitos, e satisfeito só pode estar aquele que se conforma, que não tem a mentalidade do vencedor. Vence só quem nunca consegue. Só é forte quem desanima sempre. O melhor e o mais púrpura é abdicar. O império supremo é o do Imperador que abdica de toda a vida normal, dos outros homens, em quem o cuidado da supremacia não pesa como um fardo de jóias.","To conform is to submit and to win is to conform, to be defeated. So any victory is rude. Winners always lose all the qualities of dismay at the present that led them to the struggle that brought them victory. They are satisfied, and only those who conform, who do not have the winner's mentality, can be satisfied. Only those who never succeed win. Only those who are always discouraged are strong. The best and the most purple is to abdicate. The supreme empire is that of the Emperor who abdicates all normal life, from other men, on whom the care of supremacy does not weigh like a burden of jewels.","What men wanted to do but did not and what they destroyed in so doing, what became of their souls and was never spoken of — all that formed part of the sensitive soul accompanying me along the night shore. And what lovers found wanting in each other, the truth about herself that the wife always hid from her husband, what the mother thought of the child she never had, things that found expression only in a smile or an opportunity, in a moment that was not the right one or in an absent emotion — all of this came with me on my walk and returned with me while the vast waves crashed out the accompaniment that lulled me to sleep.","To conform is to submit, and to conquer is to conform, to be conquered. Thus every victory is a debasement. The conqueror inevitably loses all the virtues born of frustration with the status quo that led him to the fight that brought victory. He becomes satisfied, and only those who conform – who lack the conqueror’s mentality – are satisfied. Only the man who never achieves his goal conquers. Only the man who is forever discouraged is strong. The best and most regal course is to abdicate. The supreme empire belongs to the emperor who abdicates from all normal life and from other men, for the preservation of his supremacy won’t weigh on him like a load of jewels."

"Dir-se-ia que, descendo aquela escada pouco usada agora, e entrando lentamente na praia pequena sempre deserta, eu empregava um processo mágico para me encontrar mais próximo da mónada possível que sou. Certos modos e feições da minha vida quotidiana — representados no meu ser constante por desejos, repugnâncias, preocupações — sumiam-se de mim como emboscados da ronda, apagavam-se nas sombras até se não perceber o que eram, e eu atingia um estado de distância íntima em que se me tornava difícil lembrar-me de ontem, ou conhecer como meu o ser que em mim está vivo todos os dias. As minhas emoções de constantemente, os meus hábitos regularmente irregulares, as minhas falas com outros, as minhas adaptações à constituição social do mundo — tudo isto me parecia coisas lidas algures, páginas inertes de uma biografia impressa, pormenores de um romance qualquer, naqueles capítulos intervalares que lemos pensando em outra coisa, e o fio da narrativa se esbambeia até cobrejar1 pelo chão.","It could be said that, descending that little used staircase now, and slowly entering the small, always deserted beach, I was employing a magical process to find myself as close to the possible monad that I am. Certain ways and features of my daily life — represented in my constant being by desires, repugnances, worries — disappeared from me like ambushes from the round, faded into the shadows until I didn't realize what they were, and I reached a state of intimate distance in which it became difficult for me to remember yesterday, or to know as mine the being that is alive in me every day. My constantly erratic emotions, my regularly irregular habits, my conversations with others, my adaptations to the social constitution of the world—all these seemed to me to be things I read somewhere, inert pages of a printed biography, details of some novel, in those chapters. intervals that we read thinking about something else, and the thread of the narrative unravels until it covers1 the floor.","And in the depths of my soul — the only reality of the moment — there is an intense, invisible pain, a sadness like the sound of someone weeping in a dark room.","In descending that now little-used stairway and slowly stepping out on to the forever deserted beach, it was as if I were using some magical technique to find myself nearer the monad that I perhaps am. Certain aspects and characteristics of my daily existence – represented in my normal self by desires, aversions, worries – vanished from me like fugitives from the law, fading into the shadows beyond recognition, and I attained a state of inward distance in which it was hard to remember yesterday or to believe that the self who lives in me day after day really belongs to me. My usual emotions, my regularly irregular habits, my conversations with others, my adaptations to the world’s social order – all of this seemed like things I’d read somewhere, like inert pages of a published biography, or details from some novel, in one of the middle chapters we read while thinking about something else, and the story-line slackens until it finally slithers away on the ground."

It ended metaphysically in the impossibility in our soul of continuing to have the joy of a dubious anguish. The boys on the dock looked at us as they would anyone else who didn't have that emotion unbecoming the useful part of the boarding.","The Tejo in the background is a blue lake and the hills on the far shore a squat Switzerland. A small boat — a black cargo steamer — leaves the shores of Poço do Bispo for the estuary mouth that I cannot see from here. Until the day when this outward aspect of my self should cease, may the gods preserve in me this clear, sunny notion of external reality, this sense of my own unimportance, this comforting feeling of being small and capable of imagining being happy.","The morning hour came to an end in the city, like the slope on the other side of the river when the boat touches the wharf. As long as it didn’t dock, it bore the scenic view of the far shore on its hull; the scenery fell away at the sound of the hull scraping against the rocks. A man whose trousers were rolled up past his knees placed a clamp on the rope; his gesture was definitive, perfectly natural, and it metaphysically concluded with my soul no longer being able to enjoy a doubtful anxiety. The boys on the wharf looked at me as at a normal man, one who would never feel such undue emotion for the practical aspects of docking a boat."
"Isto é verdade em toda a escala do amor. No amor sexual buscamos um prazer nosso dado por intermédio de um corpo estranho. No amor diferente do sexual, buscamos um prazer nosso dado por intermédio de uma ideia nossa. O onanista é abjecto, mas, em exacta verdade, o onanista é a perfeita expressão lógica do amoroso. É o único que não disfarça nem se engana.","This is true on the whole scale of love. In sexual love we seek our own pleasure given through a foreign body.

He is the only one who neither disguises nor deceives himself.","This is true of every kind of love. In sexual love we seek our own pleasure through the intermediary of another’s body.

He is the only one who neither disguises nor deludes himself.","This is true in the whole gamut of love. In sexual love we seek our own pleasure via another body.

Once, when I was a happy child, the voice of a green parrot in color lived in a house in the courtyard next door.

"Quantas vezes os tenho ouvido dizer a mesma frase que simboliza todo o absurdo, todo o nada, toda a insciência falada das suas vidas. É aquela frase que usam de qualquer prazer material: “é o que a gente leva desta vida”… Leva onde? leva para onde? leva para quê? Seria triste despertá-los da sombra com uma pergunta como esta… Fala assim um materialista, porque todo o homem que fala assim é, ainda que subconscientemente, materialista. O que é que ele pensa levar da vida, e de que maneira? Para onde leva as costeletas de porco e o vinho tinto e a rapariga casual? Para que céu em que não crê? Para que terra para onde não leva senão a podridão que toda a sua vida foi de latente? Não conheço frase mais trágica nem mais plenamente reveladora da humanidade humana. Assim diriam as plantas se soubessem conhecer que gozam do sol. Assim diriam dos seus prazeres sonâmbulos os bichos inferiores ao homem na expressão de si mesmos. E, quem sabe, eu que falo, se, ao escrever estas palavras numa vaga impressão de que poderão durar, não acho também que a memória de as ter escrito é o que eu “levo desta vida”. E, como o inútil cadáver do vulgar à terra comum, baixa ao esquecimento comum o cadáver igualmente inútil da minha prosa feita a atender. As costeletas de porco, o vinho, a rapariga do outro? para que troço eu deles?","How many times have I heard them say the same phrase that symbolizes all the absurdity, all the nothingness, all the spoken inscience of their lives. It's that phrase they use for any material pleasure: “it's what we take from this life”… Where does it take? take where? take it for what? It would be sad to wake you from the shadows with a question like this… A materialist talks like that, because every man who talks like that is, even if subconsciously, a materialist. What does he plan to take with his life, and in what way? Where does it take the pork chops and red wine and the casual girl? For what heaven do you not believe in? To what land does it lead only to the rot that its whole life has been dormant? I know of no phrase more tragic or more fully revealing of human humanity. That's what plants would say if they knew how to know that they enjoy the sun. This is what animals inferior to man would say of their sleepwalking pleasures in the expression of themselves. And, who knows, I who speak, if, when writing these words with a vague impression that they could last, I also don't think that the memory of having written them is what I “take away from this life”. And, like the useless corpse of the vulgar to the common earth, the equally useless corpse of my prose made to attend to the common oblivion sinks into oblivion. The pork chops, the wine, the other guy's girl? why do i part of them?","In the countries I have visited I have been not only the secret pleasure felt by the unknown traveler but the majesty of the king who rules there, I have been the people who live there and their customs, and the whole history of that and other nations. I saw those landscapes and those houses because I was them, created in God from the substance of my imagination. Renunciation is freedom. Not wanting is power. What can China give me that my soul has not already given me? And if my soul cannot give me that, how can China, since it is with my soul that I would see China, were I ever to see it? I can go in search of riches in the Orient, but not the riches of the soul, because I am the riches of my soul, and I am where I am, with or without the Orient. I can understand why people incapable of feeling like to travel. That’s why travel books are always so lacking as books of experience, because they are only as good as the imagination of the person writing them. And if the writer has imagination, he can delight us as much with a detailed, photographic description of flags and landscapes as with the inevitably less detailed description of landscapes he only imagined he saw. We are all myopic, except when we look inside ourselves. Only in dreams do we truly see. Basically, there are only two things that our experience of the world can give us — the universal and the particular. To describe the universal is to describe what is common to every human soul and to all human experience — the vast sky and the days and nights that emerge from it and exist within it; the flowing rivers — all with the same cool, nunlike water; the seas and the great undulating mountains, which keep the majesty of their great height in the secret of their depths; the fields, the seasons, houses, faces, gestures; clothes and smiles; love and war; the gods, finite and infinite; the formless Night, mother of the origin of the world; Fate, the intellectual monster that is everything … Describing this, or any other universal thing, my soul is speaking a primitive, divine language, the Adamic language everyone understands. But what fragmented, Babelic language would I be speaking when describing the Elevador de Santa Justa, Reims Cathedral, Zouave trousers, the way Portuguese people pronounce Tras-os-Montes? These things are superficial accidents; they can be experienced by walking, but not by feeling. What is universal about the Elevador de Santa Justa is the helpful mechanical knowledge it brings to the world. What is true about Reims Cathedral is neither the Cathedral nor Reims, but the sacred majesty of buildings devoted to the knowledge of the depths of the human soul. What is eternal in those Zouave trousers is the colorful fiction of clothes, a human language that gives voice to a social simplicity which is, in its own way, a new nakedness. What is universal about local pronunciations is the homely timbre of the voices of people who live spontaneously, the diversity within groups of individuals, the multicolored panoply of customs, the differences between peoples, and the vast variety of nations. We are eternal travelers of ourselves, and the only landscape that exists is what we are. We possess nothing, because we do not even possess ourselves. We have nothing because we are nothing. What hands will I reach out to what universe?","How often I’ve heard people say the same old phrase that symbolizes all the absurdity, all the nothingness, all the verbalized ignorance of their lives. It’s the phrase they use in reference to any material pleasure: ‘This is what we take away from life…’ Take where? take how? take why? It would be sad to wake them out of their darkness with questions like that… Only a materialist can utter such a phrase, because everyone who utters such a phrase is, whether he knows it or not, a materialist. What does he plan to take from life, and how? Where will he take his pork chops and red wine and lady friend? To what heaven that he doesn’t believe in? To what earth, where he’ll take only the rottenness that was the latent essence of his whole life? I can think of no phrase that’s more tragic, or that reveals more about human humanity. That’s what plants would say if they could know that they enjoy the sun. That’s what animals would say about their somnambulant pleasures, were their power of self-expression not inferior to man’s. And perhaps even I, while writing these words with a vague impression that they might endure, imagine that my memory of having written them is what I ‘take away from life’. And just as a common corpse is lowered into the common ground, so the equally useless corpse of the prose I wrote while waiting will be lowered into common oblivion. A man’s pork chops, his wine, his lady friend – who am I to make fun of them?"

However, that most natural of emotions soon passed, to be overtaken by a feeling difficult to define but one in which tedium, humiliation and weariness predominated. A feeling of tedium as if Fate had imposed on me a task to be carried out during some unfamiliar evening shift. As if a new duty — that of an awful reciprocity — were given to me, ironically, as a privilege over which I would have to toil, all the time thanking Fate for it. As if the flaccid monotony of life were not enough to bear without superimposing on it the obligatory monotony of a definite feeling.","The most contemptible thing about dreams is that everyone has them. The delivery boy who dozes against the lamppost in between deliveries is thinking about something in his darkened mind.

"É tão difícil descrever o que se sente quando se sente que realmente se existe, e que a alma é uma entidade real, que não sei quais são as palavras humanas com que possa defini-lo.

Espero, pois, debruçado sobre a ponte, que me passe a verdade, e eu me restabeleça nulo e fictício, inteligente e natural.","It is so difficult to describe what it feels like when you feel that you really exist, and that the soul is a real entity, that I don't know what human words can be used to define it.

"Há, porém, ocasiões da meditação — e a todos quantos meditam elas chegam — em que tudo está gasto, tudo velho, tudo visto, ainda que esteja por ver. Porque, por mais que meditemos qualquer coisa, e, meditando-a, a transformemos, nunca a transformamos em qualquer coisa que não seja substância de meditação. Chega-nos então a ânsia da vida, de conhecer sem ser com o conhecimento, de meditar só com os sentidos ou pensar de um modo táctil ou sensível, de dentro do objecto pensado, como se fôssemos água e ele esponja. Então também temos a nossa noite, e o cansaço de todas as emoções aprofunda-se com serem emoções do pensamento, já de si profundas. Mas é uma noite sem repouso, sem luar, sem estrelas, uma noite como se tudo houvesse sido virado do avesso — o infinito tornado interior e apertado, o dia feito forro negro de um trajo desconhecido.","There are, however, occasions of meditation - and to all who meditate they come - when everything is worn out, everything old, everything seen, even if it is yet to be seen. Because however much we meditate on anything, and by meditating on it transform it, we never transform it into anything other than the substance of meditation. Then comes the urge for life, to know without knowing it, to meditate only with the senses or think in a tactile or sensitive way, from within the object thought, as if we were water and it was a sponge. Then we also have our night, and the tiredness of all emotions deepens as they are emotions of thought, already deep. But it is a night without rest, without moonlight, without stars, a night as if everything had been turned inside out—the infinite turned inside and cramped, the day made the black lining of an unknown garment.","There are, however, times — and this happens to all those who meditate — when everything, however new, seems old and worn and hackneyed, because, however hard we meditate on anything — and, by meditating, transform it — we can only ever transform it into something that can be used as further matter for meditation. We are assailed then by a desire to live, to know things without knowing them, to meditate only with the senses or to think in a tactile or sensitive way, from within the object we are thinking about, as if it were a sponge and we were water. Then, too, we have our night, and the weariness of all emotions grows even deeper because they are thought emotions, which are, in themselves, deep. But it is a night without repose, without moonlight, without stars, a night in which everything seems to have been turned inside out — the infinite is transformed into a tight, constraining interior, and the day has become the black lining of a suit we have never seen before.","But there are times in our meditation – and they come to all who meditate – when everything is suddenly worn-out, old, seen and reseen, even though we have yet to see it. Because no matter how much we meditate on something, and through meditation transform it, whatever we transform it into can only be the substance of meditation. At a certain point we are overwhelmed by a yearning for life, by a desire to know without the intellect, to meditate with only our senses, to think in a tactile or sensory mode, from inside the object of our thought, as if it were a sponge and we were water. And so we also have our night, and the profound weariness produced by emotions becomes even more profound, since in this case the emotions come from thought. But it’s a night without slumber or moon or stars, a night as if all had been turned inside out – infinity internalized and ready to burst, and the day converted into the black lining of an unfamiliar suit."
"Em baixo, afastando-se do alto onde estou em desnivelamentos de sombra, dorme ao luar, álgida, a cidade inteira.","Below, moving away from the top where I am in unevenness of shadow, the whole city sleeps in the moonlight, algid.","I don’t know if the ineffable poetry of those sentences belongs entirely to the fact that they were lost or partly to the fact that they were never written down. I hesitate before doing anything, often without knowing why. How often — like the straight line appropriate to my nature (conceiving this in my head as the ideal straight line) — I deliberately seek out the longest distance between two points. I’ve never had a talent for the active life. I always bungled the gestures no one else gets wrong; what others were born to do, I always had to struggle not to forget to do. I always want to achieve what others achieved almost casually.","Far below, sloping down in a tumult of shadows from the heights where I gaze, the icy city sleeps in the moonlight."

What this weariness aspires to is not simply to cease to exist — which might or might not be possible — but, far more horrifying, far deeper than that, it wants never to have existed at all, and that, of course, cannot be. I have caught occasional hints of something similar to this ambition (which outdoes in negativity even the void itself) in the often confused speculations of the Indians.","Death is a liberation because to die is to need no one. In death the wretched slave is forcibly set free from his pleasures, from his sufferings, from his coveted and ongoing life. The king is freed of the domains he didn’t want to give up. Women who spread love are freed of the triumphs they cherish. Men who conquered are freed of the victories for which their lives were predestined."

"Não comungo, não comunguei nunca, não poderei, suponho, alguma vez comungar aquele conceito bastardo pelo qual somos, como almas, consequências de uma coisa material chamada cérebro, que existe, por nascença1, dentro de outra coisa material chamada crânio. Não posso ser materialista, que é o que, creio, se chama àquele conceito, porque não posso estabelecer uma relação nítida — uma relação visual2, direi — entre uma massa visível de matéria cinzenta, ou de outra cor qualquer, e esta coisa eu que por detrás do meu olhar vê os céus e os pensa, e imagina céus que não existem. Mas, ainda que nunca possa cair no abismo de supor que uma coisa possa ser outra só porque estão no mesmo lugar, como a parede e a minha sombra nela, ou que depender a alma do cérebro seja mais que depender eu, para o meu trajecto, do veículo em que vou, creio, todavia, que há entre o que em nós é só espírito e o que em nós é espírito do corpo uma relação de convívio em que podem surgir discussões. E a que surge vulgarmente é a de a pessoa mais ordinária incomodar a que o é menos.","I don't share, I never have, I can't, I suppose, ever share that bastard concept by which we are, as souls, consequences of a material thing called the brain, which exists, by birth, inside another material thing called the skull. I cannot be a materialist, which is what, I believe, that concept is called, because I cannot establish a clear relationship—a visual relationship, I shall say—between a visible mass of gray matter, or any other color, and this thing I behind my gaze he sees the skies and thinks about them, and imagines skies that don't exist. But even though I can never fall into the abyss of supposing that one thing can be another just because they are in the same place, like the wall and my shadow on it, or that depending the soul on the brain is more than depending on me, for my journey , from the vehicle in which I go, I believe, however, that there is, between what in us is just spirit and what in us is spirit of the body, a relationship of conviviality in which discussions can arise. And the one that commonly arises is that the most ordinary person bothers the least.","I never take communion, I never have. Neither, I suppose, will I ever be able to partake of that bastardized concept according to which we, as souls, are consequences of a material thing called the brain that exists from birth inside another material thing called the cranium. I cannot be a materialist, which is, I believe, what that concept implies, because I cannot establish a clear link — a visual link I mean — between a visible mass of gray or any other colored matter and the “I” which, from behind my eyes, sees the skies and ponders them and imagines other nonexistent skies. But, even though I could never fall into the trap of supposing that one thing is the same as another simply because the two things exist in the same place, like a wall and my shadow falling on it, or of assuming that a relationship between the soul and the brain is any more logical than a relationship between me, on my journey to work, and the vehicle in which I travel, I still believe there is an intimate relationship between what is pure spirit in us and what is body and that this can give rise to disputes between them. These disputes are like those in which the more vulgar of two parties starts pestering the less vulgar one.","I do not share, have never shared, and can’t imagine ever sharing that degenerate concept that regards us, as living souls, to be consequences of a material thing called the brain, which originates and resides in another material thing known as the cranium. I cannot be a materialist, which I believe is what one calls an adherent to this concept , for I cannot establish a clear relationship – I mean a visual relationship – between a tangible mass of grey or otherwise coloured matter and this thing known as the I that behind my gaze sees the skies and thinks about them, and imagines skies that don’t exist. But even if I cannot fall into the pit of supposing that one thing is another just because they’re in the same place, like a wall and my shadow on it, or that my soul’s dependence on my brain is any greater than my dependence, when travelling, on the vehicle that carries me, I do believe there is a social relationship between what in us is pure spirit and what in us is the body’s spirit, such that quarrels can occur between them. And what usually occurs is that the more ordinary of the two persons gets on the other’s nerves."
"Perder tempo comporta uma estética. Há, para os subtis nas sensações, um formulário da inércia que inclui receitas para todas as formas de lucidez. A estratégia com que se luta com a noção das conveniências sociais, com os impulsos dos instintos, com as solicitações do sentimento exige um estudo que qualquer mero esteta não suporta fazer1. A uma acurada etiologia dos escrúpulos deve seguir-se uma diagnose irónica das subserviências à normalidade. Há a cultivar, também, a agilidade contra as intrusões da vida; um cuidado ▢ deve couraçar-nos contra sentir as opiniões alheias, e uma mole indiferença encamar-nos a alma contra os golpes surdos da coexistência com os outros.","Wasting time has an aesthetic. There is, for the subtle in sensation, a form of inertia that includes recipes for all forms of lucidity. The strategy with which one struggles with the notion of social conveniences, with the impulses of instincts, with the requests of feeling requires a study that any mere esthete cannot bear to do1. An accurate etiology of scruples must be followed by an ironic diagnosis of subservience to normality. There is also to cultivate agility against the intrusions of life; ▢ care must shield us against feeling the opinions of others, and a soft indifference must incarnate our souls against the muffled blows of coexistence with others.","Everything about me is fading away. My whole life, my memories, my imagination and its contents, my personality, it’s all fading away. I continually feel that I was someone else, that I felt and thought as another. I am present at a play with different scenery and the drama I watch is me. Sometimes amidst the accumulated banality of my literary work stored randomly in various desk drawers, I come across things I wrote ten or even fifteen or more years ago. And many of them seem to me to have been written by a stranger; I don’t recognize myself in them.","There’s an aesthetics to wasting time. For those who cultivate sensations there’s an unwritten handbook on inertia, with recipes for all the forms of lucidity. To develop the right strategy for fighting against the notion of social mores, against the impulses of our instincts and against the solicitations of sentiment requires a study that not every aesthete is prepared to undertake. A rigorous aetiology of our scruples should be followed by an ironic diagnosis of our concessions to normality. We must also learn how to ward off life’s intrusions; a caution is necessary to make us impervious to outside opinions, and a velvety indifference to insulate our soul against the invisible blows of coexisting with others."
"Lastro do falso, não servem senão para que não sirvamos. São dúvidas do abismo, deitadas na alma, arrastando dobras sonolentas e frias. Duram fumos, passam rastros, e não há mais que o haverem sido na substância estéril de ter tido consciência deles. Um ou outro é como uma peça íntima de fogo-de-artifício: faísca-se um tempo entre sonhos, e o resto é a inconsciência da consciência com que o vimos.","Ballast of the false, they only serve so that we don't serve. They are doubts of the abyss, lying in the soul, dragging sleepy and cold folds. Smoke lingers, trails pass, and there is nothing more than having been in the sterile substance of having been aware of them. One or the other is like an intimate piece of fireworks: there is a spark between dreams, and the rest is the unconsciousness of the consciousness with which we saw it.","They are the ballast of falsehood, their only purpose is to render us useless. They are doubts from the deep that settle in cold, sleepy folds upon the soul. They are as ephemeral as smoke, as tracks on the ground, and all that remains of them is the fact of their once having existed in the sterile soil of our awareness of them. Some are like fireworks of the mind that glitter for a moment between dreams, the rest are just the unconsciousness of the consciousness with which we saw them. Like a bow","Ballast of falseness, they’re useful for nothing but to render us useless. They are doubts from the abyss that drag their cold and slithery bodies across the soul.

I didn't even represent. They represented me. I was, not the actor, but his gestures.","I look down on my past life as if it were a plain stretched out beneath the sun just breaking through the clouds, and I notice, with a metaphysical shock, how all my most assured gestures, my clearest ideas and my most logical aims were, after all, nothing but an innate drunkenness, a natural madness, an immense ignorance.

"Há um terceiro método para subtilizar em prazeres as dores e fazer das dúvidas e das inquietações um mole leito. É o dar às angústias e aos sofrimentos, por uma aplicação irritada da atenção, uma intensidade tão grande que pelo próprio excesso tragam o prazer do excesso, assim como pela violência sugiram a quem de hábito e educação de alma ao prazer se vota e dedica, o prazer que dói porque é muito prazer, o gozo que sabe a sangue porque feriu. E quando, como em mim — requintador que sou de requintes falsos, arquitecto que me construo de sensações subtilizadas através da inteligência, da abdicação da vida, da análise e da própria dor — todos os três métodos são empregados conjuntamente, quando uma dor, sentida imediatamente, e sem demoras para estratégia íntima, é analisada até à secura, colocada num Eu exterior até à tirania, e enterrada em mim até ao auge de ser dor, então verdadeiramente eu me sinto o triunfador e o herói. Então me pára a vida, e a arte se me roja aos pés.","There is a third method for subtlying pain into pleasures and turning doubts and worries into a soft bed. It is to give to anguish and suffering, by an irritated application of attention, an intensity so great that by the very excess they bring the pleasure of excess, as well as by violence they suggest to those who, by habit and education of soul, devote themselves to pleasure, the pleasure that hurts because it's a lot of pleasure, the pleasure that tastes like blood because it hurt. And when, as in myself — a refiner that I am of false refinements, an architect who builds myself from subtle sensations through intelligence, the abdication of life, analysis and pain itself — all three methods are used together, when a pain, felt immediately, and without delay for intimate strategy, is analyzed to the point of dryness, placed in an outer Self to the point of tyranny, and buried in me to the height of being pain, then truly I feel the triumphant and the hero. Then life stops me, and art collapses at my feet.",,"I have no other real pleasure besides the analysis of my pain, nor any other sensual delight besides the morbid dribbling of sensations when they crumble and rot – light footsteps in the murky shadows, and we don’t even turn around to find out whose they are; faint songs in the distance, the words of which we don’t try to catch, for we are lulled more by the vagueness of what they’re saying and by the mystery of where they come from; hazy secrets of pallid waters, filling the and nocturnal spaces with ethereal far-aways; bells of distant carriages, and who knows where they’re returning from or what laughs and gaiety they contain, because from here they’re just distant, drowsy carriages in the dull torpor of an afternoon in which summer is giving way to autumn…"

Falha-nos para isso a vontade inata, e, ainda, a paciência para a educar de modo a tornar-se o perfeito instrumento dos magos e dos magnetizadores. Mas simpatizamos com o ocultismo, sobretudo porque ele sói exprimir-se de modo a que muitos que lêem, e mesmo muitos que julgam compreender, nada compreendem. É soberbamente superior essa atitude misteriosa. É, além disso, fonte copiosa de sensações do mistério e de terror: as larvas do astral, os estranhos entes de corpos diversos que a magia cerimonial evoca nos seus templos, as presenças desencarnadas da matéria deste plano, que pairam em torno aos nossos sentidos fechados, no silêncio físico do som interior — tudo isso nos acaricia com uma mão viscosa, terrível, no desabrigo e na escuridão.","Our sympathy is great for the occult and the arts of the hidden. We are not, however, occultists. For this we lack the innate will, and also the patience to educate it so that it becomes the perfect instrument of magicians and magnetizers. But we sympathize with occultism, above all because it only expresses itself in such a way that many who read it, and even many who think they understand, do not understand. This mysterious attitude is superbly superior. It is, moreover, a copious source of sensations of mystery and terror: the larvae of the astral, the strange beings of different bodies that ceremonial magic evokes in its temples, the disembodied presences of the matter of this plane, which hover around our senses. closed, in the physical silence of the inner sound—all this caresses us with a slimy, terrible hand, in homelessness and darkness.",,"To make a decision, to finalize something, to emerge from the realm of doubt and obscurity – these are things that seem to me like catastrophes or universal cataclysms.

"O tédio de Khayyam não é o tédio de quem não sabe o que faça, porque na verdade nada pode ou sabe fazer. Esse é o tédio dos que nasceram mortos, e dos que legitimamente se orientam para a morfina ou a cocaína. É mais profundo e mais nobre o tédio do sábio persa. É o tédio de quem pensou claramente e viu que tudo era obscuro, de quem mediu todas as religiões e todas as filosofias e depois disse, como Salomão: “Vi que tudo era vaidade e aflições de ânimo”, ou como, ao despedir-se do poder e do mundo, outro rei, que era imperador, nele, Septímio Severo: “Omnia fui, nihil…” “Fui tudo; nada vale a pena”.","Khayyam's boredom is not the boredom of someone who doesn't know what to do, because in reality nothing can or knows how to do it. This is the tedium of the stillborn, and of those who legitimately turn to morphine or cocaine. Deeper and nobler is the boredom of the Persian sage. It is the boredom of one who thought clearly and saw that everything was obscure, of one who measured all religions and all philosophies and then said, like Solomon: ""I saw that everything was vanity and afflictions of spirit"", or how, when saying goodbye of power and the world, another king, who was emperor, in it, Septimius Severus: “Omnia fui, nihil…” “I was everything; nothing is worth it”.","There are some deep-seated griefs so subtle and pervasive that it is difficult to grasp whether they belong to our soul or to our body, whether they come from a malaise brought on by pondering the futility of life, or whether they are caused rather by an indisposition in some chasm within ourselves — stomach, liver or brain.","The tedium of Khayyám isn’t the tedium of those who, because they don’t know how to do anything, naturally don’t know what to do. This tedium belongs to those who were born dead and who understandably turn to morphine or cocaine. The tedium of the Persian sage is more noble and profound. It’s the tedium of one who clearly considered and saw that everything was obscure, of one who took stock of all the religions and philosophies and said, like Solomon: ‘I saw that all was vanity and vexation of spirit.’ Or in the words of another king, the emperor Septimus Severus, when he said farewell to power and the world: ‘Omnia fui, nihil expedit.’ ‘I’ve been everything; nothing’s worth the trouble.’"
"O chegar, porém, a este grau de sensação, acarreta ao amador de sensações o correspondente peso ou gravame físico de que correspondentemente sente, com idêntico exaspero consciente, o que de doloroso impinge do exterior, e por vezes do interior também, sobre o seu momento de atenção. É quando assim constata que sentir excessivamente, se por vezes é gozar em excesso, é outras sofrer com prolixidade, e porque o constata, que o sonhador é levado a dar o segundo passo na sua ascensão para si próprio. Ponho de parte o passo que ele poderá ou não dar, e que, consoante ele o possa ou não dar, determinará tal ou tal outra atitude, jeito de marcha, nos passos que vai dando, segundo possa ou não isolar-se por completo da vida real (se é rico ou não — redunda nisso). Porque suponho compreendido nas entrelinhas do que narro que, consoante é ou não possível ao sonhador isolar-se e dar-se a si1, com menor ou maior intensidade ele deve concentrar-se sobre a sua obra de despertar doentiamente o funcionamento das suas sensações das coisas e dos sonhos. Quem tem de viver entre os homens, activamente e encontrando-os — e é realmente possível reduzir ao mínimo a intimidade que se tem de ter com eles (a intimidade, e não o mero contacto, com gente, é que é o prejudicador) —, terá de fazer gelar toda a sua superfície de convivência para que todo o gesto fraternal e social feito a ele escorregue e não entre ou não se imprima. Parece muito isto, mas é pouco. Os homens são fáceis de afastar: basta não nos aproximarmos. Enfim, passo sobre este ponto e reintegro-me no que explicava.","Reaching this level of sensation, however, entails the corresponding weight or physical burden on the amateur of sensations, from which he correspondingly feels, with the same conscious exasperation, what is painfully imposed from the outside, and sometimes from the inside as well, on his body. moment of attention. It is when he realizes that feeling excessively, if sometimes it means enjoying in excess, is at other times suffering with prolixity, and because he realizes it, the dreamer is led to take the second step in his ascent towards himself. I put aside the step he may or may not take, and which, depending on whether he may or may not take it, will determine this or that attitude, way of walking, in the steps he takes, depending on whether or not he can completely isolate himself from the real life (whether you're rich or not — it boils down to that). Because I suppose it is understood between the lines of what I narrate that, depending on whether or not it is possible for the dreamer to isolate himself and give himself1, with less or greater intensity he must concentrate on his work of sickeningly awakening the functioning of his sensations of the things and dreams. Who has to live among men, actively and meeting them - and it is really possible to reduce to a minimum the intimacy that one has to have with them (intimacy, and not mere contact, with people, is the harm) - , he will have to freeze his entire surface of coexistence so that every fraternal and social gesture made to him slips away and does not enter or be imprinted. It looks like a lot, but it's not much. Men are easy to push away: just don't get close. Anyway, I pass on this point and reintegrate myself with what I explained.",,"I have no other real pleasure besides the analysis of my pain, nor any other sensual delight besides the morbid dribbling of sensations when they crumble and rot – light footsteps in the murky shadows, and we don’t even turn around to find out whose they are; faint songs in the distance, the words of which we don’t try to catch, for we are lulled more by the vagueness of what they’re saying and by the mystery of where they come from; hazy secrets of pallid waters, filling the and nocturnal spaces with ethereal far-aways; bells of distant carriages, and who knows where they’re returning from or what laughs and gaiety they contain, because from here they’re just distant, drowsy carriages in the dull torpor of an afternoon in which summer is giving way to autumn…"

This page, even, by Vieira, in its cold perfection of syntactic engineering, makes me tremble like a branch in the wind, in a passive delirium of something moved.","and it’s a point that every superior man will reach. The second stage is the point at which we doubt both ourselves and our doubt, and, in the brief yet long curve of time during which we, as humans, have watched the sun rise and the night fall over the varied surface of the earth , that is a stage very few men have reached. To know oneself is to err, and the oracle who said “Know thyself” proposed a task greater than all of Hercules’ labors and an enigma even more obscure than that of the Sphinx.","I enjoy speaking. Or rather, I enjoy wording. Words for me are tangible bodies, visible sirens, incarnate sensualities. Perhaps because real sensuality doesn’t interest me in the least, not even intellectually or in my dreams, desire in me metamorphosed into my aptitude for creating verbal rhythms and for noting them in the speech of others. I tremble when someone speaks well. Certain pages from Fialho* and from Chateaubriand make my whole being tingle in all of its pores, make me rave in a still shiver with impossible pleasure. Even certain pages of Vieira,* in the cold perfection of their syntactical engineering, make me quiver like a branch in the wind, with the passive delirium of something shaken."
"Para alguns que me falam e me ouvem, sou um insensível. Sou, porém, mais sensível — creio — que a vasta maioria dos homens. O que sou, contudo, é um sensível que se conhece, e que, portanto, conhece a sensibilidade.","For some who speak to me and listen to me, I am insensitive. But I am more sensitive - I believe - than the vast majority of men. What I am, however, is a sensible that knows itself, and that, therefore, knows the sensibility.","To some people who speak and listen to me I must seem an insensitive soul. However, I am, I think, more sensitive than the vast majority of men. I am, moreover, a sensitive man who knows himself and therefore knows what sensitivity is.","Some of the people I talk with consider me insensitive. But I think I’m more sensitive than the vast majority. I’m a sensitive man who knows himself, and who therefore knows sensitivity."

"Pelo futuro delas? Pela inconsciência delas? Não directamente por elas — ou, quem sabe? talvez apenas por mim.","For their future? Because of their unconsciousness? Not directly by them — or, who knows? maybe just for me.","— beginning, middle and end, and this consoles me for being alive. Or else (a passage on rhetorical figures) that takes me back to the preface. I’m not exaggerating a single verbal inch: I really feel all this. Just as others read passages from the Bible, I read his book on rhetoric. I enjoy the advantage of repose and a lack of religious devotion.","For their future? For their unconsciousness? Not directly for them, and perhaps, after all, only for me."
"Vinha, por fim, o outono certo: o ar tornava-se frio de vento; soavam folhas num tom seco, ainda que não fossem folhas secas; toda a terra tomava a cor e a forma impalpável de um paul incerto. Descoloria-se o que fora sorriso último, num cansaço de pálpebras, numa indiferença de gestos. E assim tudo quanto sente, ou supomos que sente, apertava, íntima, ao peito a sua própria despedida. Um som de redemoinho num átrio flutuava através da nossa consciência de outra coisa qualquer. Aprazia convalescer para sentir verdadeiramente a vida.","Finally, the sure autumn came: the air became cold with the wind; leaves sounded in a dry tone, even though they were not dry leaves; the whole earth took on the color and impalpable shape of an uncertain marsh. What had been a last smile faded, in a tiredness of the eyelids, in an indifference of gestures. And so everything he feels, or we suppose he feels, intimately pressed his own farewell to his chest. A swirling sound in an atrium floated through our awareness of something else. It was a pleasure to convalesce to truly feel life.","The second is this: every noble soul wishes to live life to the full, to experience everything and every feeling, to know every corner of the earth and, given that this is impossible, life can only be lived to the full subjectively, only lived in its entirety once renounced. These two truths are mutually irreducible. The wise man will refrain from trying to conflate them and will also refrain from repudiating one or other of them. He will, however, have to choose one and then live with his regret at not having chosen the other, or else reject both, and rise above himself to some personal nirvana. Happy the man who demands no more from life than what life spontaneously gives him and who guides himself with the instinct of cats who seek the sun when there is sun and, when there is no sun, find what warmth they can.","Finally the full autumn came. The air turned cold and windy; leaves rustled with a dry sound, even if they weren’t dry; the ground took on the colour and impalpable shape of a shifting swamp. What had been a final smile faded as eyelids drooped and gestures flagged. And so everything that feels, or that we imagine feels, pressed its own farewell tight against its breast. A sound of whirling wind in a courtyard wafted through our consciousness of something else. Convalescence appealed as a way of at least truly feeling life."
"As carroças da rua ronronam1, sons separados, lentos, de acordo, parece, com a minha sonolência. É a hora do almoço mas fiquei no escritório. O dia é tépido e um pouco velado. Nos ruídos há, por qualquer razão, que talvez seja a minha sonolência, a mesma coisa que há no dia.","The street carts purr, separate sounds, slow, in accord, it seems, with my drowsiness. It's lunchtime but I've stayed in the office. The day is warm and a little veiled. In the noises there is, for some reason, that maybe it's my drowsiness, the same thing there is in the day.","[23 Apr 1930] An uncertain evening breeze touches my brow and my consciousness with something like a vague caress, all the gentler for not being a caress.","The carts in the street purr slow, distinct sounds in seeming accord with my drowsiness. It’s lunchtime but I’ve stayed in the office. It’s a warm day, a bit overcast. And the sounds, for some reason, which might be my drowsiness, are exactly like the day."
"O silêncio que sai do som da chuva espalha-se, num crescendo de monotonia cinzenta, pela rua estreita que fito. Estou dormindo desperto, de pé contra a vidraça, a que me encosto como a tudo. Procuro em mim que sensações são as que tenho perante este cair esfiado de água sombriamente luminosa que [se] destaca das fachadas sujas e, ainda mais, das janelas abertas. E não sei o que sinto, não sei o que quero sentir, não sei o que penso nem o que sou.","The silence that comes from the sound of the rain spreads, in a crescendo of gray monotony, across the narrow street I stare at. I'm sleeping awake, standing against the windowpane, which I lean against like everything else. I look for the sensations I have in front of this frayed fall of darkly luminous water that [stands out] from the dirty facades and, even more, from the open windows. And I don't know what I feel, I don't know what I want to feel, I don't know what I think or what I am.","The silence that emanates from the sound of the falling rain spreads in a crescendo of gray monotony along the narrow street I’m gazing down at. I’m sleeping on my feet, leaning against the window as if there were nothing else in the world. I search myself to find out what feelings I have before this unraveling fall of dark, luminous water standing out clearly against the grubby façades and, even more clearly, against the open windows. And I don’t know what I feel , I don’t know what I want to feel , I don’t know what I think or what I am.","Silence emerges from the sound of the rain and spreads in a crescendo of grey monotony over the narrow street I contemplate. I’m sleeping while awake, standing by the window, leaning against it as against everything. I search in myself for the sensations I feel before these falling threads of darkly luminous water that stand out from the grimy building façades and especially from the open windows. And I don’t know what I feel or what I want to feel. I don’t know what to think or what I am."

"E por fim, sobre a escuridão dos telhados lustrosos, a luz fria da manhã tépida raia como um suplício do Apocalipse. É outra vez a noite imensa da claridade que aumenta. É outra vez o horror de sempre — o dia, a vida, a utilidade fictícia, a actividade sem remédio. É outra vez a minha personalidade física, visível, social, transmissível por palavras que não dizem nada, usável pelos gestos dos outros e pela consciência alheia. Sou eu outra vez, tal qual não sou. Com o princípio da luz de trevas que enche de dúvidas cinzentas as frinchas das portas das janelas — tão longe de herméticas, meu Deus! —, vou sentindo que não poderei guardar mais o meu refúgio de estar deitado, de não estar dormindo mas de o poder estar, de ir sonhando, sem saber que há verdade nem realidade, entre um calor fresco de roupas limpas e um desconhecimento, salvo de conforto, da existência do meu corpo. Vou sentindo fugir-me a inconsciência feliz com que estou gozando da minha consciência, o modorrar de animal com que espreito, entre pálpebras de gato ao sol, os movimentos da lógica da minha imaginação desprendida. Vou sentindo sumirem-se-me os privilégios da penumbra, e os rios lentos sob as árvores das pestanas entrevistas, e o sussurro das cascatas perdidas entre o som do sangue lento1 nos ouvidos e o vago perdurar de chuva. Vou-me perdendo até vivo.","And finally, over the gloom of the glossy roofs, the cold light of the tepid morning streaks like an ordeal of the Apocalypse. It is again the immense night of increasing clarity. It is again the usual horror — the day, life, fictitious utility, activity without remedy. It is once again my physical, visible, social personality, transmitted by words that say nothing, usable by the gestures of others and by the conscience of others. It's me again, just as I'm not. With the beginning of the light of darkness that fills the cracks in the window doors with gray doubts — so far from airtight, my God! —, I feel that I will no longer be able to keep my refuge of lying down, of not sleeping but of being able to be, of dreaming, without knowing that there is neither truth nor reality, between the fresh heat of clean clothes and a lack of knowledge, unless of comfort, of the existence of my body. I feel the happy unconsciousness with which I am enjoying my conscience slip away, the sleep of an animal with which I watch, between cat's eyelids in the sun, the movements of the logic of my detached imagination. I can feel the privileges of the penumbra disappearing from me, and the lazy rivers under the trees of the interviewed lashes, and the whisper of the waterfalls lost between the sound of slow blood in my ears and the vague lingering of rain. I'm losing myself even alive.","Only then did I notice that there was something else in the street apart from the street lamps: a diffuse moonlight, hidden and silent, full of nothing, like life …","And finally, over the darkness of the gleaming rooftops, the cold light of the tepid morning breaks like a torment of the Apocalypse. Once again it’s the vast night of increasing luminosity. Once again it’s the usual horror: the day, life, fictitious purposes, inescapable activity. Once again it’s my physical, visible and social personality, communicated by meaningless words and exploited by the acts and consciousness of others. Once again I’m I, exactly as I’m not. And as this light from the darkness fills with grey doubts the cracks around the shutters (far from hermetic, alas!) , I begin to realize that I can no longer hold on to this refuge of staying in bed, of not sleeping but being able to, of dreaming without remembering truth and reality, of nestling between a cool warmth of clean sheets and an ignorance of my body’s existence beyond its feeling of comfort. I realize that I’m losing the happy unconsciousness with which I’ve been enjoying my consciousness, the animal drowsiness in which I observe – as through the slowly blinking eyelids of a cat in the sun – the movements described by my free imagination’s logic. I realize that the privileges of darkness are vanishing, and with them the slow rivers under the bowing trees of my glimpsed eyelashes, and the murmur of the cascades lost between the soft flowing of blood in my ears and the faint, steady rain. I’m losing myself to become alive."
O gládio do primeiro relâmpago volteou vagamente no além... É cor de relâmpago o luar sobre o mar alto e tudo isto é ser ruínas já e passado afastado o meu palácio do príncipe que nunca fui...,The glaive of the first lightning flashed vaguely in the beyond... The moonlight over the open sea is the color of lightning and all this is to be ruins already and past my palace away from the prince I never was...,"[1931?] Everything has become unbearable to me, except life — the office, my house, the streets — even their opposite, if such a thing existed — everything overwhelms and oppresses me. Only the totality affords me relief.","The sword of the first lightning bolt vaguely whirled in the beyond. The moonlight over the high sea is the colour of lightning, and what it all means is that the palace of the prince I never was is now ruins in a distant past."
"Caminhávamos, juntos e separados, entre os desvios bruscos da floresta. Nossos passos, que era o alheio de nós, iam unidos, porque uníssonos, na macieza estalante das folhas, que juncavam, amarelas e meio-verdes, a irregularidade do chão. Mas iam também disjuntos porque éramos dois pensamentos, nem havia entre nós de comum senão que o que não éramos pisava uníssono o mesmo solo ouvido.","We walked, together and apart, between the abrupt detours of the forest. Our steps, which were alien to us, were united, because they were in unison, in the crackling softness of the leaves, which, yellow and half-green, jumbled the irregularity of the ground. But they were also disjointed because we were two thoughts, there was nothing in common between us, except that what we were not treaded in unison on the same heard ground.","We were walking, together and separate, along forest paths that kept abruptly changing direction. Our steps, which were not ours, were united, treading in unison over the crisp softness of the fallen leaves scattered, yellow and faded green, over the rough ground. They were also disunited because we were two different thoughts, with nothing in common except that what-we-were-not was treading in unison over the same heard surface.","Together and apart we walked along the forest’s sharply turning paths. Foreign to us, our steps were united, for they went in unison over the crackling softness of the yellow and half-green leaves that matted the ground’s unevenness. But they also went separately, for we were two minds, with nothing in common except for the fact that what we weren’t was treading in unison over the same resonant ground."
"Paisagens inúteis como aquelas que dão a volta às chávenas chinesas, partindo da asa e vindo acabar na asa, de repente. As chávenas são sempre tão pequenas… Para onde se prolongaria, e com que ▢ de porcelana, a paisagem que não se prolongou para além da asa da chávena?","Useless landscapes like those that go around Chinese cups, starting from the handle and ending up on the handle, suddenly. The cups are always so small… Where would the landscape extend, and with what ▢ of porcelain, the landscape that did not extend beyond the cup's handle?","Everything I see is, for me, the purely visible, be it the vast blue, green-tinged sky of the coming morning, be it the false grimace of pain on the face of someone watching the death of a loved one and aware that he is being watched.","Useless landscapes like those that wind around Chinese teacups, starting out from the handle and abruptly ending at the handle. The cups are always so small… Where would the landscape lead to, and with what of porcelain, if it could continue past the teacup handle?"
"Cedo de mais obtive, por uma experiência, simultânea e conjunta, da sensibilidade e da inteligência, a noção de que a vida da imaginação, por mórbida que pareça, é contudo aquela que calha aos temperamentos como é o meu. As ficções da minha imaginação (posterior) podem cansar, mas não doem nem humilham. Às amantes impossíveis é também impossível o sorriso falso, o dolo do carinho, a astúcia das carícias. Nunca nos abandonam, nem de qualquer modo nos cessam.","Very soon I obtained, through an experience, simultaneous and joint, of sensibility and intelligence, the notion that the life of the imagination, morbid as it may seem, is nevertheless the one that suits temperaments like mine. The fictions of my (later) imagination may tire, but they do not hurt or humiliate. For impossible lovers, it is also impossible to fake a smile, the deceit of affection, the cunning of caresses. They never abandon us, nor in any way cease us.","I saw that I had in my hands a message to deliver and when I told them the paper was blank, they laughed at me. I still don’t know if they laughed because all such pieces of paper are blank or because all messages are only hypothetical. At last, as if before the hearth I did not have, I sat down on the milestone at the crossroads and, all by myself, began to make paper boats out of the lie they had given me. No one took me seriously, not even as a liar, and I had no lake on which to test my truth.","Through an experience that simultaneously involved my sensibility and intelligence, I realized early on that the imaginative life, however morbid it might seem, is the one that suits temperaments like mine. The fictions of my imagination (as it later developed) may weary me, but they don’t hurt or humiliate. Impossible lovers can’t possibly cheat on us, or smile at us falsely, or be calculating in their caresses. They never forsake us, and they don’t die or disappear."
"Somos, por pouco que o queiramos, servos da hora e das suas cores e formas, súbditos do céu e da terra. Aquele de nós que mais se embrenhe em si mesmo, desprezando o que o cerca, esse mesmo se não embrenha pelos mesmos caminhos quando chove do que quando o céu está bom. Obscuras transmutações, sentidas talvez só no íntimo dos sentimentos abstractos, se operam porque chove ou deixou de chover, se sentem sem que se sintam porque sem sentir o tempo se sentiu.","We are, however little we want to, servants of the hour and its colors and shapes, subjects of heaven and earth. The one of us who gets more into himself, despising what surrounds him, does not go down the same paths when it rains as when the sky is good. Obscure transmutations, perhaps felt only in the depths of abstract feelings, operate because it rains or has stopped raining, they are felt without feeling because without feeling time was felt.","Even if what we pretend to be — because the real we and the pretend we coexist — even if it collapses around us, we must remain unmoved, not because we are just, but because we are ourselves, and being ourselves means having nothing to do with those external things collapsing about us even if, in falling, they destroy what we are for them. For the best of us, life should be a dream that eschews all comparisons. 403","Whether we like it or not we’re servants of the hour and its colours and shapes, we’re subjects of the sky and earth. Even those who delve only in themselves, disdaining what surrounds them, delve by different paths when it rains and when it’s clear. Obscure transmutations, perhaps felt only in the depths of abstract feelings, occur because it rains or stops raining. They’re felt without our feeling them because the weather we didn’t feel made itself felt."
"O meu estoicismo é uma necessidade orgânica. Preciso de me couraçar contra a vida. Como todo o estoicismo não passa de um epicurismo severo, desejo, quanto possível, fazer que a minha desgraça me divirta. Não sei até que ponto o consigo. Não sei até que ponto consigo qualquer coisa. Não sei até que ponto qualquer coisa se pode conseguir…","My stoicism is an organic necessity. I need to armor myself against life. As all stoicism is but a severe Epicureanism, I wish, as far as possible, to make my misfortune amuse me. I don't know how far I can. I don't know how far I can get anything. I don't know how far anything can be achieved...","With the fraternal feeling that comes from knowing I must look the same, I notice him gasping for air. 406 [1932?] I was already feeling uneasy. All at once, the silence stopped breathing. The infinite day suddenly splintered like steel.","My stoicism is an organic necessity; I need to shield myself against life. Since stoicism is after all just a stringent form of Epicureanism, I try to get some amusement out of my misfortune. I don’t know to what extent I achieve this. I don’t know to what extent I achieve anything. I don’t know to what extent anything can be achieved…"

"Para quem faz do sonho a vida, e da cultura em estufa das suas sensações uma religião e uma política, para esse, o primeiro passo, o que acusa na alma que ele deu o primeiro passo, é o sentir as coisas mínimas extraordinária e desmedidamente. Este é o primeiro passo, e o passo simplesmente primeiro não é mais do que isto. Saber pôr no saborear duma chávena de chá a volúpia extrema que o homem normal só pode encontrar nas grandes alegrias que vêm da ambição subitamente satisfeita toda ou das saudades de repente desaparecidas, ou então nos actos finais e carnais do amor; poder encontrar na visão dum poente ou na contemplação dum detalhe decorativo aquela exasperação de senti-los que geralmente só pode dar, não o que se vê ou o que se ouve, mas o que se cheira ou se gosta — essa proximidade do objecto da sensação que só as sensações carnais — o tacto, o gosto, o olfacto — esculpem de encontro à consciência; poder tornar a visão interior, o ouvido do sonho — todos os sentidos supostos e do suposto — recebedores e tangíveis como sentidos virados para o externo: escolho estas, e as análogas suponham-se, dentre as sensações que o cultor de sentir-se logra, educado já, espasmar, para que dêem uma noção concreta e próxima do que busco dizer.","For those who turn dreams into life, and from the culture in the hothouse of their sensations, a religion and a politics, for this, the first step, what shows in the soul that he took the first step, is to feel the smallest things extraordinarily and disproportionately. . This is the first step, and the simply first step is nothing more than that. Knowing how to put into the taste of a cup of tea the extreme voluptuousness that the normal man can only find in the great joys that come from ambition suddenly fulfilled or from nostalgia that has suddenly disappeared, or else in the final and carnal acts of love; to be able to find in the sight of a sunset or in the contemplation of a decorative detail that exasperation of feeling them that usually can only give, not what one sees or what one hears, but what one smells or likes — that proximity to the object of sensation that only carnal sensations — touch, taste, smell — sculpt against conscience; being able to make the inner vision, the ear of the dream — all the supposed and supposed senses — receptive and tangible as senses turned to the outside: I choose these, and the analogous ones, suppose, among the sensations that the cultivator of feeling manages to achieve. , educated already, spasm, so that they give a concrete and close notion of what I am trying to say.",,"I have no other real pleasure besides the analysis of my pain, nor any other sensual delight besides the morbid dribbling of sensations when they crumble and rot – light footsteps in the murky shadows, and we don’t even turn around to find out whose they are; faint songs in the distance, the words of which we don’t try to catch, for we are lulled more by the vagueness of what they’re saying and by the mystery of where they come from; hazy secrets of pallid waters, filling the and nocturnal spaces with ethereal far-aways; bells of distant carriages, and who knows where they’re returning from or what laughs and gaiety they contain, because from here they’re just distant, drowsy carriages in the dull torpor of an afternoon in which summer is giving way to autumn…"
"Que missa branca interrompes para me lançar a bênção de te mostrar sendo? Em que ponto ondeado da dança estacas, e o Tempo contigo, para do teu parar fazeres ponte até minha alma e do teu sorriso púrpura do meu fausto?","What white mass do you interrupt to offer me the blessing of showing you being? At what undulating point of the dance do you stop, and Time with you, to bridge your stop to my soul and your purple smile of my splendor?",,"If I take one of my sensations and unravel it so as to use it to weave the inner reality I call ‘The Forest of Estrangement’ or ‘A Voyage I Never Made’, you can be sure I don’t do it for the sake of a lucid and shimmering prose, nor even for the sake of the pleasure I get from that prose – though I’m quite glad to have it as an additional final touch, like a splendidly falling curtain over my dreamed stage settings – but to give complete exteriority to what is interior, thereby enabling me to realize the unrealizable, to conjoin the contradictory and, having exteriorized my dream, to give it its most powerful expression as pure dream."

"Recordo-me de repente: ele sabia exactamente por que vias-férreas se ia de Paris a Bucareste, por que vias-férreas se percorria a Inglaterra, e, através das pronúncias erradas dos nomes estranhos, havia a certeza aureolada da sua grandeza de alma. Hoje, sim, deve ter existido para morto, mas talvez um dia, em velho, se lembre como é não só melhor, senão mais verdadeiro, o sonhar com Bordéus do que desembarcar em Bordéus.","I suddenly remember: he knew exactly by which railroads you went from Paris to Bucharest, by which railroads you traveled through England, and, through the wrong pronunciations of strange names, there was the haloed certainty of his greatness of soul. .

At that point the singer stopped. No one said a word.","I just remembered: he knew the exact route of the train from Paris to Bucharest as well as the routes of all the trains in England, and as he mispronounced the strange names, I could see the glowing certainty of his greatness of soul.

"Se não faço o bem, por moral, também não exijo que mo façam. Se adoeço, o que mais me pesa é que obrigo alguém a tratar-me, coisa que me repugnaria de fazer a outrem. Nunca visitei um amigo doente. Sempre que, tendo eu adoecido, me visitaram, sofri cada visita como um incómodo, um insulto, uma violação injustificável da minha intimidade decisiva. Não gosto que me dêem coisas; parecem com isso obrigar-me a que as dê também — aos mesmos ou a outros, seja a quem for.","If I don't do good, out of morals, I don't demand that they do it to me either. If I get sick, what weighs me the most is that I force someone to treat me, which I would be disgusted to do to someone else. I have never visited a sick friend. Whenever, having fallen ill, they visited me, I suffered each visit as a nuisance, an insult, an unjustifiable violation of my decisive intimacy. I don't like being given things; they seem to oblige me to give them too—to the same people or to others, whoever it may be.","Others will lean from the same windows; those who have forgotten about shadowy fears are sleeping, nostalgic for the sun they never knew; and I myself, who dares but does not act, will end up, with no regrets, among those soggy reeds made muddy by the nearby river and by my own flaccid inertia, beneath the vast autumn skies of evening, in impossibly far-flung places.","If, for moral reasons, I don’t do good to others, neither do I expect others to do good to me. When I get sick, what I hate most is if someone should feel obliged to take care of me, something I’d loathe doing for another. I’ve never visited a sick friend. And whenever I’ve been sick and had visitors, I’ve always felt their presence as a bother, an insult, an unwarranted violation of my wilful privacy. I don’t like people to give me things, because it seems like they’re obligating me to give something in return – to them or to others, it’s all the same."
"Desde antes de manhã cedo, contra o uso solar desta cidade clara, a névoa envolve1, num manto leve2, que o sol foi crescentemente dourando, as casas múltiplas3, os espaços abolidos, os acidentes da terra e das construções. Chegada, porém, a hora alta antes do meio-dia — começou a desfiar-se4 a bruma branda, e, em hálitos de sombras de véus, a cessar imponderavelmente. Pelas dez horas da manhã só um ténue mau-azular do céu revelava que a névoa fora.","From early in the morning, against the solar use of this bright city, the mist envelops1, in a light mantle2, which the sun has been increasingly gilding, the multiple houses3, the abolished spaces, the accidents of land and buildings. But when the high hour arrived before noon—the soft mist began to unravel, and, in breaths of shadowy veils, to cease imponderably. By ten o'clock in the morning, only a faint hazy blue sky revealed that the fog had gone.","Contrary to the sunny custom of this bright city, the successive rows of houses, the empty plots, the ragged outline of roads and buildings have, since early morning, been wrapped in a light blanket of mist that the sun has slowly turned to gold. Towards midmorning the soft fog began to unravel and, tenuously, in shadowy gusts like the lifting of veils, to vanish. By ten o’clock, the only remaining evidence of the vanished mist was the tenuously tarnished blue of the sky.","Since early morning and against the solar custom of this bright city, the fog had wrapped a weightless mantle (which the sun slowly gilded) around the rows of houses, the cancelled open spaces, and the shifting heights of land and of buildings. But as the hours advanced towards midday, the gentle mist began to unravel until, with breaths like flapping shadows of veils, it expired altogether. By ten o’clock, the tenuous blueing of the sky was the only evidence that there had been fog."

"Tudo morre em mim, mesmo o saber que posso sonhar! De nenhum modo físico estou bem. Todas as maciezas em que me reclino têm arestas para a minha alma.

"Viajei. Julgo inútil explicar-vos que não levei nem meses, nem dias, nem outra quantidade qualquer de qualquer medida de tempo a viajar. Viajei no tempo, é certo, mas não do lado de cá do tempo, onde o contamos por horas, dias e meses; foi do outro lado do tempo que eu viajei, onde o tempo se não conta por medida.

"A vida é uma viagem experimental, feita involuntariamente. É uma viagem do espírito através da matéria, e como é o espírito que viaja, é nele que se vive. Há, por isso, almas contemplativas que têm vivido mais intensa, mais extensa, mais tumultuariamente do que outras que têm vivido externas. O resultado é tudo. O que se sentiu foi o que se viveu. Recolhe-se tão cansado de um sonho como de um trabalho visível. Nunca se viveu tanto como quando se pensou muito.","Life is an experimental journey, made involuntarily. It is a journey of the spirit through matter, and as it is the spirit that travels, it is in it that we live. There are, therefore, contemplative souls who have lived more intensely, more extensively, more tumultuously than others who have lived externally. The result is everything. What you felt was what you lived. He withdraws as tired of a dream as he is of visible work. Never lived as long as when you thought a lot.","Life is an experimental journey undertaken involuntarily. It is a journey of the spirit through the material world and, since it is the spirit that travels, it is in the spirit that it is experienced. That is why there exist contemplative souls who have lived more intensely, more widely, more tumultuously than others who have lived their lives purely externally. The end result is what matters. What one felt was what one experienced. One retires to bed as wearily from having dreamed as from having done hard physical labor. One never lives so intensely as when one has been thinking hard.","Life is an experimental journey that we make involuntarily. It is a journey of the mind through matter, and since it is the mind that journeys, that is where we live. And so there are contemplative souls who have lived more intensely, more widely and more turbulently than those who live externally. The end result is what counts. What was felt is what was lived. A dream can tire us out as much as physical labour. We never live as hard as when we’ve thought a great deal."
"Tenho principalmente sono. Não um sono que traz latente, como todos os sonos, ainda os mórbidos, o privilégio físico do sossego. Não um sono que, porque vai esquecer a vida, e porventura trazer sonhos, traz na bandeja com que nos vem até à alma as oferendas plácidas de uma grande abdicação. Não: este é um sono que não consegue dormir, que pesa nas pálpebras sem as fechar, que junta num gesto que se sente ser de estupidez e repulsa as comissuras sentidas dos beiços descrentes. Este é um sono como o que pesa inutilmente sobre1 o corpo nas grandes insónias da alma.","I'm mostly sleepy. Not a sleep that brings latent, like all sleeps, even the morbid ones, the physical privilege of peace. Not a sleep that, because it will forget life, and perhaps bring dreams, brings on the tray with which the placid offerings of a great abdication come to our souls. No: this is a sleep that cannot sleep, that weighs heavily on the eyelids without closing them, that joins in a gesture that feels stupid and repulses the felt corners of the disbelieving lips. This is a sleep like that which weighs uselessly on the body in the great insomnia of the soul.","What I most want is to sleep. But the sleep I desire, unlike other varieties, even those induced by sickness, does not include the physical reward of rest. Nor does it help one to forget about life, or even bring with it the promise of dreams, balancing on the tray it carries as it approaches our soul the calm gift of a final abdication. No, this is a sleep that never actually sleeps, it weighs on one’s eyelids but never closes them and puckers the corners of unbelieving lips in a gesture one feels to be a combination of repugnance and stupidity. This is the sleep that weighs on one’s body during periods of great insomnia of the soul.","What I mostly feel is slumber. Not a slumber that latently brings – like all other slumbers, even those caused by sickness – the privilege of physical rest. Not a slumber that, because it’s going to forget life and perhaps bring dreams, bears the soothing gifts of a grand renunciation on the platter with which it approaches our soul. No: this is a slumber that’s unable to sleep , that weighs on the eyelids without closing them, that purses the corners of one’s disbelieving lips into what feels like a stupid and repulsive expression. It’s the kind of sleepiness that uselessly overwhelms the body when one’s soul is suffering from acute insomnia."
"— Passeei pelas margens dos rios cujo nome me encontrei ignorando. Às mesas dos cafés de cidades visitadas descobri-me a perceber que tudo me sabia a sonho, a vago. Cheguei a ter às vezes a dúvida se não continuava sentado à mesa da nossa casa antiga, imóvel e deslumbrado por sonhos!

Dá-se o facto ainda absurdo de não o poder explicar…","— I strolled along the banks of rivers whose name I found myself ignoring. At tables in cafes in cities I visited, I found myself realizing that I knew everything in a dream, vaguely.

I can't tell you that it doesn't happen, that I'm not there yet, that all of this, including this conversation with you, isn't false and supposed. Sir who are you?

"Considerando, aliás, e com a clareza que posso, o que tem sido aparentemente a minha vida, vejo-a como uma coisa colorida — capa de chocolate ou anilha de charuto — varrida, pela escova leve da criada que escuta de cima, da toalha a levantar para a pá de lixo das migalhas, entre as côdeas da realidade propriamente dita. Destaca-se das coisas cujo destino é igual por um privilégio que vai ter à pá também. E a conversa dos deuses continua por cima do escovar, indiferente a esses incidentes do serviço do mundo.","Considering, moreover, and as clearly as I can, what has apparently been my life, I see it as a colorful thing - chocolate wrapper or cigar ring - swept, by the light brush of the maid who listens from above, from the towel lifting to the dustpan of crumbs, between the crusts of reality itself. It stands out from the things whose fate is the same for a privilege that will also have the shovel. And the talk of the gods goes on over the brushing, indifferent to these incidents of the service of the world.","because it has the appearance of sleep; if we call death a new life, it’s because it seems different from life. We build our beliefs and hopes out of these small misunderstandings with reality and live off husks of bread that we call cakes, the way poor children play at being happy. But that’s how all of life is; at least that’s how the particular way of life generally known as civilization is. Civilization consists in giving an inappropriate name to something and then dreaming what results from that. And in fact the false name and the true dream do create a new reality. The object really does become other, because we have made it so. We manufacture realities. We use the raw materials we always used, but the form lent it by art effectively prevents it from remaining the same. A table made out of pinewood is a pine tree but it is also a table. We sit down at the table not at the pine tree. Although love is a sexual instinct, we do not love with that instinct, rather we presuppose the existence of another feeling, and that presupposition is, effectively, another feeling. These meandering thoughts that I calmly record in the café I chanced to sit down in were evoked by something as I was walking down the street, quite what I don’t know, a sudden subtle trick of the light, a vague noise, the memory of a perfume or a snatch of music, each strummed into being by some unknown influence from without. I don’t know where I was going to lead those thoughts or where I would choose to lead them. There’s a light mist today, damp and warm, unthreateningly sad, oddly monotonous. Some feeling I don’t recognize aches in me; I feel as if I had lost the thread of some discussion; the words I write are utterly will-less. Sadness lurks beneath consciousness.","And if I think, with all the lucidity I can muster, about what my life has apparently been, I see it as a coloured thing – a chocolate wrapper or a cigar band – swept from the dirty tablecloth by the brisk brush of the housemaid (who’s listening overhead) and landing in the dustpan with the crumbs and the crusts of reality proper. It stands out from other things with a similar destiny by its privilege of getting to ride in the dustpan as well. And above the maid’s brushing the gods continue their conversation, indifferent to the affairs of the world’s servants."

"Muitas vezes para me entreter — porque nada entretém como as ciências, ou as coisas com jeito de ciências, usadas futilmente — ponho-me escrupulosamente a estudar o meu psiquismo através da forma como o encaram os outros. Raras vezes é triste o prazer, por vezes doloroso, que esta táctica fútil me causa.","Often to amuse myself — because nothing entertains like science, or things that look like science, used futilely — I scrupulously study my psyche through the way others see it. The pleasure, sometimes painful, that this futile tactic gives me is seldom sad.","Some feelings are like dreams that pervade every corner of one’s spirit like a mist, that do not let one think or act or even be.","There’s no pastime like the use of science, or things that smack of science, for futile ends, and so I often pass the time by intently studying my psyche as others see it. The pleasure I get from this sterile artifice is sometimes sad, sometimes painful."

"Ser imoral não vale a pena, porque diminui, aos olhos dos outros, a vossa personalidade, ou a banaliza. Ser imoral dentro de si, cercada do máximo respeito alheio. Ser esposa e mãe corporeamente virginal e dedicada, e ter, porém, contraído doenças[?] inexplicáveis com todos os homens da vizinhança, desde os merceeiros até aos ▢ — eis o que maior sabor tem a quem realmente quer gozar e alargar a sua individualidade, sem descer ao método da criada de servir, que, por ser também delas, é baixo, nem cair na honestidade rigorosa da mulher profundamente estúpida, que é decerto filha do interesse.","Being immoral is not worth it, because it diminishes, in the eyes of others, your personality, or trivializes it. To be immoral within oneself, surrounded by the utmost respect from others. Being a corporeally virginal and devoted wife and mother, and yet having contracted inexplicable diseases[?] with all the men in the neighborhood, from the grocers to the , without descending into the maid's method of serving, which, because it is also theirs, is low, nor falling into the rigorous honesty of the profoundly stupid woman, who is certainly the daughter of interest.",,"But to be inwardly immoral while being held in high esteem by everyone around you, to be a dedicated and corporally chaste wife and mother while at the same time mysteriously catching diseases from all the men in the neighbourhood, from the grocers to – this is the height of gratification for anyone who really wants to enjoy and expand her individuality without stooping to the base method of naturally base housemaids or else falling into the rigid virtuousness of profoundly stupid women, whose virtue is merely the offspring of self-interest."
"O mais alto grau do sonho é quando, criado um quadro com personagens, vivemos todas elas ao mesmo tempo — somos todas essas almas conjunta e interactivamente. É incrível o grau de despersonalização e encinzamento do espírito a que isto leva e é difícil, confesso-o, fugir a um cansaço geral de todo o ser ao fazê-lo... Mas o triunfo é tal!","The highest level of the dream is when, having created a picture with characters, we live all of them at the same time - we are all these souls together and interactively. It is incredible the degree of depersonalization and graying of the spirit that this leads to and it is difficult, I confess it, to escape a general tiredness of the whole being in doing so... But the triumph is such!",,"The highest stage of dreaming is when, having created a picture with various figures whose lives we live all at the same time, we are jointly and interactively all of those souls. This leads to an incredible degree of depersonalization and the reduction of our spirit to ashes, and it is hard, I admit, not to feel a general weariness throughout one’s entire being. But what triumph! This is the only final asceticism. It’s an asceticism without faith, and without any God. God am I. CASCADE Children know that the doll isn’t real, but they treat it as if it were, to the point of crying with grief when it breaks. The art of children is in non-realization. How blessed is that deluded age, when life is negated* by the absence of sex, and reality is negated by the act of playing, unreal things standing in for real ones! If I could only go back to being a child and remain one for ever, oblivious to the values that men attach to things and the relations they establish between them! When I was little, I often stood my toy soldiers on their heads. And what convincing argument of logic can prove to me that real soldiers shouldn’t march head downward? Gold is worth no more than glass to a child. And is gold’s value truly any greater? The child obscurely senses the absurdity of the wraths, passions and fears he sees sculpted in adult gestures. And aren’t all our fears, hatreds and loves truly vain and absurd? O divinely absurd intuition of children! True vision of things, which we always dress with conventions, however nakedly we see them, and always blur with our ideas, however directly we look at them! Might not God be an enormous child? Doesn’t the whole universe seem like a game, like the prank of a mischievous child? So unreal, so..... I laughingly threw out this idea for consideration, and only now, seeing it from a distance, do I realize how ghastly it is. (Who’s to say it isn’t true?) And it falls to the ground at my feet, shattering into shards of mystery and pulverized horror… I wake up to make sure I exist… An immense, indefinite tedium gurgles with a deceptively fresh sound in the cascades past the beehives, at the stupid far end of the yard. CENOTAPH No surviving widow or son placed the obol in his mouth to pay Charon. We’ll never know with what eyes he crossed the Styx and saw his face – forever veiled to us – reflected nine times in the waters of the underworld. The name of his shadow, which now wanders on the banks of the gloomy rivers, is for us but another shadow. He died for his Country, without knowing how or why. His sacrifice had the glory of going unrecognized. He gave his life with his whole heart and soul: out of instinct, not duty; because he loved his Country, not because he was conscious of it. He defended it as a man defends his mother, whose son he is by birth rather than by logic. Faithful to the primeval secret, he didn’t think about or wish for his death but instinctively lived it, as he had lived his life. The shadow he now inhabits is brother to the shadows that fell at Thermopylae, faithful in their flesh to the pledge made at their birth. He died for his Country the way the sun daily rises. He was already, by nature, what Death would make of him. He did not fall on behalf of some zealous faith, nor was he killed in the vile struggle for some great ideal. Unsullied by faith or humanitarianism, he did not die in defence of a political idea, the future of humanity, or a new religion. Having no faith in another world, with which the credulous of Mohammed and the followers of Christ deceive themselves, he saw death arrive without hoping for life in it; he saw life leave him without hoping for a better one. He passed on naturally, like the wind and the day, taking with him the soul that had made him different. He plunged into the shadows the way a man, arriving at a door, walks through it. He died for his Country, the only thing above us that we can know and grasp. Neither the paradise of Moslems and Christians nor the transcendental oblivion of Buddhists was reflected in his eyes when in their depths the flame of his earthly life went out. If we don’t know who he is, neither did he know who he was. He did his duty without knowing what he’d done. He was guided by what makes the roses bloom and the death of leaves beautiful. Life has no better purpose, nor death a better reward. Now, according as the gods allow, he visits the lightless regions, passing by the laments of Cocytus and the fire of Phlegethon, and hearing in the night the slow flowing of the livid, Lethean current. He is anonymous like the instinct that killed him. He didn’t think he would die for his Country; he died for it. He didn’t decide to do his duty; he just did it. Since his soul bore no name, it is only right that we not ask what name defined his body. He was Portuguese, but not this or that Portuguese, and so he stands as the universal Portuguese. His place is not next to the creators of Portugal, who have a different stature and a different consciousness. He doesn’t belong in the company of our demigods, whose daring extended the routes of the sea and brought within our reach more land than could be had. Let no statue or stone commemorate this soul who was all of us. Since he was the entire people, for a tomb he should have this entire land. We should bury him in his own memory, with only his example for a stone. DECLARATION OF DIFFERENCE The things of city and state have no power over us. It doesn’t matter that the ministers and their courtiers shamelessly mishandle the nation’s affairs. All of this occurs outside, like mud on a rainy day. We have nothing to do with it, however much it may have to do with us. We are likewise indifferent to great convulsions such as war and crises around the world. As long as they don’t come to our house, we don’t care on whose door they knock. This attitude would appear to be founded on a profound contempt for others, but its real basis is merely a sceptical view of ourselves. We’re not kind or charitable. Not because we’re the opposite, but because we’re neither one way nor the other. Kindness is the form of delicacy that belongs to crude souls. It interests us as a phenomenon that takes place in other people, who have other ways of thinking. We observe without approving or disapproving. Our vocation is to be nothing. We would be anarchists if we had been born in the classes which call themselves underprivileged, or in any of the others from which one can move up or down. But we are for the most part individuals born in the cracks between classes and social divisions – nearly always in that decadent space between the aristocracy and the upper-middle class, the social niche of geniuses and lunatics with whom it’s possible to get along. Action disconcerts us, partly because of our physical incompetence, but mainly because it offends our moral sensibility. We consider it immoral to act. It seems to us that every thought is debased when expressed in words, which transform the thought into the property of others, making it understandable to anyone who can understand it. We’re sympathetic towards the occult and the secret arts. We are not occultists, however. We weren’t born with the kind of will it takes, let alone the patience to educate and develop such a will into the perfect instrument of a wizard or hypnotist. But we sympathize with occultism, especially since it tends to express itself in ways that many who read and even think they understand it don’t understand a thing. Its arcane attitude is arrogantly superior. It is, in addition, a rich source of mysterious and terrifying sensations: astral larvae, the strange beings with strange bodies evoked in its temples by ritual magic, and the immaterial presences that hover all around our unperceiving senses, in the physical silence of inner sound – all of this comforts us in darkness and distress with the caress of its sticky, horrid hand. But we don’t sympathize with occultists when they act as apostles and champions of humanity; this strips them of their mystery. The only valid reason for an occultist to operate in the astral realm is for the sake of a higher aesthetic, not for the insidious purpose of doing good to others. Almost unawares we harbour an ancestral sympathy for black magic, for the forbidden forms of transcendental science, and for the Lords of Power who sold themselves to Condemnation and a degenerate Reincarnation. The eyes of our weak, vacillating souls lose themselves – like a bitch in heat – in the theory of inverse degrees, in corrupted rites, and in the sinister curve of the descendent, infernal hierarchy. Like it or not, Satan exerts an attraction on us like a male on a female. The serpent of Material Intelligence has wound around our heart, as around the symbolic caduceus of the God who communicates: Mercury, lord of Understanding. Those of us who aren’t homosexuals wish we had the courage to be. Our distaste for action can’t help but feminize us. We missed our true calling as housewives and idle chatelaines because of a sexual mix-up in our current incarnation. Although we don’t believe this one bit, to act as though we do smacks of irony’s very blood. None of this is out of meanness, just weakness. In private we adore the Bad, not because it’s bad, but because it’s stronger and more intense than the Good, and all that is strong and intense is attractive to nerves that should have belonged to a woman. Pecca fortiter can’t apply to us, for we have no force, not even the force of intelligence, which is the only one we could ever claim. To think of sinning forcefully – that’s the most we can do with this severe dictum. But even this is not always possible, for our inner life has its own reality which we sometimes find painful just because it is a reality. The existence of laws governing the association of ideas (along with all other mental operations) is insulting to our inherent lack of discipline. DIVINE ENVY Whenever I experience an agreeable sensation in the company of others, I begrudge the part they had in the sensation. It strikes me as an indecency that they should feel the same thing I do, that they should penetrate my soul through their own concordantly feeling soul. How can I take pride in the landscapes I contemplate, when the painful truth is that someone else has no doubt contemplated them for the same reasons I do? At other times and on other days, to be sure, but to call attention to such differences would be a pedantic consolation that’s beneath me. I know all too well that these differences are petty and that other people, with the same spirit of contemplation, have seen the landscape in a way not identical, but similar, to my own. That’s why I constantly strive to alter what I see, thereby making it indisputably mine – to alter the mountains’ profile while making it every bit as beautiful, and beautiful in the exact same way; to replace certain trees and flowers with others that are vastly and very differently the same; to see other colours that produce an identical effect in the sunset. In this way I create, thanks to my experience and my habit of spontaneously seeing when I look, an inner version of the outer world. And this is but the lowest level of replacing the visible. In my best and most intense moments of dreaming, I alter and create much more. I cause the landscape to affect me like music and to evoke visual images for my viewing pleasure – a peculiar and difficult ecstasy to achieve, since the evocative agent is of the same order as the sensations it evokes. My greatest triumph of this sort occurred when, during a moment of hazy light and atmosphere, I looked at the square at Cais"

"A manhã, meio fria, meio morna, alava-se pelas casas raras das encostas no extremo da cidade. Uma névoa ligeira, cheia de despertar, esfarrapava-se, sem contornos, no adormecimento das encostas.

And all of it—all this slow freshness of the light morning, was analogous to a joy he'd never been able to have.","[7 June 1932] Amiel said that a landscape is a state of mind, but the phrase is the feebly felicitous one of a feeble dreamer. A landscape is a landscape and therefore cannot be a state of mind.

"Há momentos em que tudo cansa, até o que nos repousaria. O que nos cansa porque nos cansa; o que nos repousaria porque a ideia de o obter nos cansa.

The image is absurd, just its meaning. Even if around us there is what we pretend to be, because we coexist, we must remain undaunted — not because we are fair, but because it is us, and being us is nothing to do with those external things that crumble, even if they roam on top of the earth. that for them we are.","Or perhaps … Yes, sometimes, when I consider the huge gulf that exists between the intelligence of children and the stupidity of adults, I think that as children we must have a guardian angel who lends us his own astral intelligence and then, perhaps with sadness, but in accordance with a higher law, abandons us, the way female animals abandon their grown-up offspring, to become the fattened pigs it’s our destiny to be.","Horace said* that the just man will remain undaunted, even if the world crumbles all around him. Although the image is absurd, the point is valid. Even if what we pretend to be (because we coexist with others) crumbles around us, we should remain undaunted – not because we’re just, but because we’re ourselves, and to be ourselves means having nothing to do with external things that crumble, even if they crumble right on top of what for them we are."
"Uma tristeza de crepúsculo, feita de cansaços e de renúncias falsas, um tédio de sentir qualquer coisa, uma dor como de um soluço parado ou de uma verdade obtida.

And when I leaned out of the high window over the street I looked down at without seeing, I suddenly felt like one of those damp cloths used to clean grimy objects in the house that gets taken to the window to dry, but instead is left there, screwed up on the sill it slowly stains. 217","It was an occasion to be happy. But something weighed on me, some inscrutable yearning, an indefinable and perhaps even noble desire. Perhaps it was just taking me a long time to feel alive.

"“Tudo vem da sem-razão”, diz-se na Antologia Grega. E, na verdade, tudo vem da sem-razão. Fora da matemática, que não tem que ver senão com números mortos e fórmulas vazias, e por isso pode ser perfeitamente lógica, a ciência não é senão um jogo de crianças no crepúsculo, um querer apanhar sombras de aves e parar sombras de ervas ao vento.","“Everything comes from without reason”, it is said in the Greek Anthology. And, in fact, everything comes from without reason. Outside of mathematics, which has nothing to do with anything other than dead numbers and empty formulas, and therefore can be perfectly logical, science is nothing but a children's game in the twilight, a desire to catch shadows of birds and stop shadows of weeds in the wind. .","I put them into errant words that desert me as soon as they’re written and wander off independently down hills and across lawns of images, along avenues lined with conceits and lanes of confusions. This is of no use to me, for nothing is of any use. But it calms me to write, the way an invalid may breathe more easily even though his sickness has not passed.","‘All that exists comes from unreason,’ says The Greek Anthology. And everything, indeed, comes from unreason. Since it deals only with dead numbers and empty formulas, mathematics can be perfectly logical, but the rest of science is no more than child’s play at dusk, an attempt to catch birds’ shadows and to stop the shadows of windblown grass."

"Para dar relevo aos meus sonhos preciso conhecer como é que as paisagens reais e as personagens da vida nos aparecem relevadas. Porque a visão do sonhador não é como a visão do que vê as coisas. No sonho, não há o assentar da vista sobre o importante e o inimportante de um objecto que há na realidade. Só o importante é que o sonhador vê. A realidade verdadeira dum objecto é apenas parte dele; o resto é o pesado tributo que ele paga à matéria em troca de existir no espaço. Semelhantemente, não há no espaço realidade para certos fenómenos que no sonho são palpavelmente reais. Um poente real é imponderável e transitório. Um poente de sonho é fixo e eterno. Quem sabe escrever é o que sabe ver os seus sonhos nitidamente (e é assim) ou ver em sonho a vida, ver a vida imaterialmente, tirando-lhe fotografias com a máquina do devaneio, sobre a qual os raios do pesado, do útil e do circunscrito não têm acção, dando negro na chapa espiritual.","To give relief to my dreams, I need to know how real landscapes and characters in life appear to us in relief. Because the dreamer's vision is not like the vision of the one who sees things. In the dream, there is no settling of the view on the important and unimportant of an object that exists in reality. Only the important thing is that the dreamer sees. The true reality of an object is only part of it; the rest is the heavy tribute he pays to matter in exchange for existing in space. Similarly, there is no reality in space for certain phenomena that are palpably real in the dream. A real sunset is imponderable and transitory. A dream sunset is fixed and eternal. Those who know how to write are those who can see their dreams clearly (and that's how it is) or see life in a dream, see life immaterially, taking pictures of it with the daydream machine, on which the rays of the heavy, the useful and of the circumscribed have no action, giving black on the spiritual plate.",,"And Aunt Anica (see her letter) will probably leave soon for Switzerland with her daughter, who will be married by then. Another good friend is going off to Galicia for a long while. Still another fellow, my next best friend after the first one I mentioned, is going to Oporto to live. Thus everything in my human circle is coming together (or apart) to force me either into isolation or else on to a new, uncertain path. Even the circumstance of publishing my first book will alter my life. I’ll lose something: my unpublished status. To change for the better, because change is bad, is always to change for the worse. And to lose something negative – be it a personal defect or deficiency, or the fact of being rejected – is still a loss. Imagine, Mother, how someone who feels this way must live, overwhelmed by such painful daily sensations! What will I be ten years from now, or even five? My friends say I’ll be one of the greatest contemporary poets – they say this based on what I’ve already written, not what I may yet write (otherwise I wouldn’t mention what they say…)."
"De tédio, como se o Destino me houvesse imposto uma tarefa em serões desconhecidos. De tédio, como se um novo dever — o de uma horrorosa reciprocidade — me fosse dado com a ironia de um privilégio, que eu me teria ainda que maçar, agradecendo-o ao Destino. De tédio, como se me não bastasse a monotonia inconsistente da vida, para agora se lhe sobrepor a monotonia obrigatória de um sentimento definido.","Boredom, as if Fate had imposed a task on me in unknown evenings. Of boredom, as if a new duty — that of a horrible reciprocity — were given to me with the irony of a privilege, which I would still have to bore myself, thanking Fate for it. Boredom, as if the inconsistent monotony of life wasn't enough for me to now be superimposed on the obligatory monotony of a definite feeling.","At this moment, when I almost overflow with feeling, I would like to have the wit simply to speak out and have as my destiny the capricious freedom of a style.","Of tedium, as if Fate had obliged me to occupy my free evenings with some strange and unfamiliar labour. Of tedium, as if a new duty – that of a hideous reciprocity – had been ironically foisted on me as a privilege for which I was expected to thank Fate profusely.

"O patrão Vasques. Tenho, muitas vezes, inexplicavelmente, a hipnose do patrão Vasques. Que me é esse homem, salvo o obstáculo ocasional de ser dono das minhas horas, num tempo diurno da minha vida?

O que é?","The boss Vasques. I have, many times, inexplicably, the hypnosis of boss Vasques. What is this man to me, apart from the occasional obstacle of being master of my hours, in a daytime period of my life? He treats me well, speaks kindly to me, except in sudden moments of unknown concern when he doesn't speak well to someone. Yes, but why do I worry? Is it a symbol? Is it a reason? What is?","[1929?] I asked for so little from life and life denied me even that. Part of a ray of sunlight, a nearby field, some peace and quiet and a mouthful of bread, not to feel the knowledge of my existence weigh too heavily on me, to demand nothing of others and have them demand nothing of me. That was denied me, like someone denying the beggar not out of malice, but merely so as not to have to unbutton his jacket. Sad, in my quiet room, alone as I have always been and as I always will be, I sit writing. And I wonder if that seemingly feeble thing, my voice, does not perhaps embody the substance of thousands of voices, the hunger to speak out of thousands of lives, the patience of millions of souls who, like me, have submitted in their daily lives to vain dreams and evanescent hopes. In moments like these my heart beats faster simply because I am conscious of it. I live more intensely because I live more fully. I feel in my person a religious force, a form of prayer, something like a clamor of voices. But the reaction against myself begins in my intellect … I see myself in the fourth-floor room in Rua dos Douradores and feel drowsy; on the half-written page, I observe rather unlovely writing, the cheap cigarette in my left hand as it rests on the old blotter. Here I am, in this fourth-floor room, demanding answers from life! Pronouncing on what other souls feel! Writing prose as if I were a real genius, a famous writer! Me, here, like this! 190 [1929?]","Vasques – the boss. At times I’m inexplicably hypnotized by Senhor Vasques. What is this man to me besides an occasional obstacle, as the owner of my time, in the daylight hours of my life?

Slowly (though not as slowly as I imagine) I make my way back to my own door in order to go up to my room again. But I don’t go in, I hesitate, then continue on. Praça da Figueira, replete with goods of various colors, fills with customers and peoples my horizon with vendors of all kinds. I advance slowly, a dead man, and my vision, no longer my own, is nothing now: it is merely that of a human animal who unwittingly inherited Greek culture, Roman order, Christian morality and all the other illusions that make up the civilization in which I live and feel. What’s become of the living?","When I was a child, I used to go to this Mass, or perhaps another one, but I think it was this one.

Todo o dia me senti pesar a vida sobre os olhos e contra as têmporas — sono nos olhos, pressão para fora nas têmporas, consciência de tudo isto no estômago, náusea e desalento.","I am in one of those moments, and I write these lines as someone who at least wants to know that he lives. All day, until now, I worked like a sleeper, doing math by dream processes, writing along in my torpor. All day I felt life weighed down on my eyes and against my temples—sleep in my eyes, pressure out of my temples, awareness of all this in my stomach, nausea and dismay.","All day I’ve felt life like a weight on my eyelids and temples — my eyes heavy with sleep, constant pressure on my temples, an awareness of all this in the pit of my stomach, feelings of nausea and despair.","I am at one of those points, and I write these lines as if to prove that I’m at least alive. All day long I’ve worked as if in a half-sleep, doing my sums the way things are done in dreams, writing left to right across my torpor. All day long I’ve felt life weighing on my eyes and against my temples – sleep in my eyes, pressure from inside my temples, the consciousness of all this in my stomach, nausea, despondency."
DIÁRIO LÚCIDO,Lucid Diary,,"I have no other real pleasure besides the analysis of my pain, nor any other sensual delight besides the morbid dribbling of sensations when they crumble and rot – light footsteps in the murky shadows, and we don’t even turn around to find out whose they are; faint songs in the distance, the words of which we don’t try to catch, for we are lulled more by the vagueness of what they’re saying and by the mystery of where they come from; hazy secrets of pallid waters, filling the and nocturnal spaces with ethereal far-aways; bells of distant carriages, and who knows where they’re returning from or what laughs and gaiety they contain, because from here they’re just distant, drowsy carriages in the dull torpor of an afternoon in which summer is giving way to autumn…"
"Choro sobre as minhas páginas imperfeitas, mas os vindouros, se as lerem, sentirão mais com o meu choro do que sentiriam com a perfeição, se eu a conseguisse, que me privaria de chorar e portanto até de escrever. O perfeito não se manifesta. O santo chora, e é humano. Deus está calado. Por isso podemos amar o santo mas não podemos amar a Deus.","I cry over my imperfect pages, but those to come, if they read them, will feel more with my crying than they would with perfection, if I could achieve it, which would deprive me of crying and therefore even of writing. The perfect does not manifest. The saint cries, and he is human. God is silent. So we can love the saint but we cannot love God.","Intrigue, gossip, boasting about what no one actually dared to do, the contentment of each poor wretch dressed in the unconscious consciousness of his own soul, all that unwashed sexuality, the jokes they tell, like a monkey scratching itself, the horrifying ignorance of their own unimportance … All this leaves me with the impression of a vile, monstrous animal created out of the unwitting dreams of the soggy crusts of desire, the chewed-over remains of sensations.","I weep over my imperfect pages, but if future generations read them, they will be more touched by my weeping than by any perfection I might have achieved, since perfection would have kept me from weeping and, therefore, from writing. Perfection never materializes. The saint weeps, and is human. God is silent. That is why we can love the saint but cannot love God."

"Deixei leituras, abandonei casuais caprichos de este ou aquele modo estético da vida. Do pouco que lia aprendi a extrair só elementos para o sonho. Do pouco que presenciava, apliquei-me a tirar apenas o que se podia, em reflexo distante e errado, prolongar mais dentro de mim. Esforcei-me porque todos os meus pensamentos, todos os capítulos quotidianos da minha experiência me fornecessem apenas sensações. Criei à minha vida uma orientação estética. E orientei essa estética para puramente individual. Fi-la minha apenas.","I left readings, abandoned the casual whims of this or that aesthetic way of life. From the little I read I learned to extract only elements for the dream. From the little I witnessed, I applied myself to taking only what could, in a distant and wrong reflection, extend more within me. I made an effort because all my thoughts, all the daily chapters of my experience gave me only sensations. I created an aesthetic orientation in my life. And I oriented this aesthetic towards the purely individual. I just made it mine.","The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","I got tired of reading, and I stopped arbitrarily pursuing now this, now that aesthetic mode of life. Of the little I did read, I learned to extract only the elements useful for dreaming. Of the little I saw and heard, I strove to take away only what could be prolonged in me as a distant and distorted reflection. I endeavoured to make all my thoughts and all the daily chapters of my experience provide me with nothing but sensations. I gave my life an aesthetic orientation, and I made that aesthetic utterly personal, exclusively my own."
"Quero, para meu próprio gosto de analisar-me, ir, à medida que a isso me ajeite, ir pondo em palavras os processos mentais que em mim são um só, esse, o de uma vida devotada ao sonho, de uma alma educada só em sonhar.","I want, for my own pleasure to analyze myself, to go, as I am able, to put into words the mental processes that in me are only one, that of a life devoted to dreams, of an educated soul only in dreaming.",,"For Vicente Guedes, to be conscious of himself was an art and a morality; to dream was a religion."
"Ouviu-me ler os meus versos — que nesse dia1 li bem, porque me distraí — e disse-me, com a simplicidade de uma lei natural: “Você, assim, e com outra cara, seria um grande fascinador”. A palavra “cara”, mais que a referência que continha, ergueu-me de mim pela gola do que me não conheço2. Vi o espelho do meu quarto, o meu pobre rosto de mendigo sem pobreza; e de repente o espelho virou-se3 e o espectro da Rua dos Douradores abriu-se diante de mim como um nirvana do carteiro.","He heard me read my verses — which I read well that day, because I got distracted — and he said to me, with the simplicity of a natural law: “You, like that, and with another face, would be a great fascinator”. The word “cara”, more than the reference it contained, lifted me from me by the collar of what I don't know2. I saw the mirror in my room, my poor beggar's face without poverty; and suddenly the mirror turned and the specter of Rua dos Douradores opened before me like postman nirvana.","However good or genuine a friend I might be to someone, hearing that he is ill or has died leaves me with such a vague, uncertain, dull impression that I’m ashamed to feel it.","He listened to me read my verses – which I read well that day, for I was relaxed – and said to me with the simplicity of a natural law: ‘If you could always be like that but with a different face, you’d be a charmer.’ The word ‘face’ – more than what it referred to – yanked me out of myself by the collar of my self-ignorance. I looked at the mirror in my room and saw the poor, pathetic face of an unpoor beggar; and then the mirror turned away, and the spectre of the Rua dos Douradores opened up before me like a postman’s nirvana."

"No fundo, há na nossa experiência da terra duas coisas só — o universal e o particular. Descrever o universal é descrever o que é comum a toda a alma humana e a toda a experiência humana — o céu vasto, com o dia e a noite que acontecem dele e nele; o correr dos rios — todos da mesma água sororal e fresca; os mares, montanhas tremulamente extensas, guardando a majestade da altura no segredo da profundeza; os campos, as estações, as casas, as caras, os gestos; o traje e os sorrisos; o amor e as guerras; os deuses, finitos e infinitos; a Noite sem forma, mãe da origem do mundo; o Fado, o monstro intelectual que é tudo… Descrevendo isto, ou qualquer coisa universal como isto, falo com a alma a linguagem primitiva e divina, o idioma adâmico que todos entendem. Mas que linguagem estilhaçada e babélica falaria eu quando descrevesse o Elevador de Santa Justa, a Catedral de Reims, os calções dos zuavos, a maneira como o português se pronuncia em Trás-os-Montes? Estas coisas são acidentes da superfície; podem sentir-se com o andar mas não com o sentir. O que no Elevador de Santa Justa é universal é a mecânica facilitando o mundo. O que na Catedral de Reims é verdade não é a Catedral nem o Reims, mas a majestade religiosa dos edifícios consagrados ao conhecimento da profundeza da alma humana. O que nos calções dos zuavos é eterno é a ficção colorida dos trajes, linguagem humana, criando uma simplicidade social que é em seu modo uma nova nudez. O que nas pronúncias locais é universal é o timbre caseiro das vozes de gente que vive espontânea, a diversidade dos seres juntos, a sucessão multicolor das maneiras, as diferenças1 dos povos, e a vasta variedade das nações.","Basically, there are only two things in our experience of the earth - the universal and the particular. To describe the universal is to describe what is common to every human soul and to every human experience—the vast sky, with the day and night that happen in and out of it; the flow of rivers — all of the same fresh sororal water; the seas, mountains tremblingly vast, keeping the majesty of the height in the secret of the deep; the fields, the seasons, the houses, the faces, the gestures; the attire and the smiles; love and wars; the gods, finite and infinite; the formless Night, mother of the origin of the world; Fado, the intellectual monster that is everything… Describing this, or anything universal like it, I speak with my soul the primitive and divine language, the Adamic language that everyone understands. But what splintered and Babelian language would I speak when describing the Santa Justa Lift, the Reims Cathedral, the Zuavos shorts, the way Portuguese is pronounced in Trás-os-Montes? These things are surface accidents; they can be felt with walking but not with feeling. What is universal about the Elevador de Santa Justa is the mechanics making the world easier. What is true about the Cathedral of Reims is not the Cathedral or Reims, but the religious majesty of the buildings consecrated to the knowledge of the depths of the human soul. What is eternal in the shorts of the Zuavos is the colorful fiction of the costumes, human language, creating a social simplicity that is, in its own way, a new nudity. What is universal in local pronunciations is the homely timbre of the voices of people who live spontaneously, the diversity of beings together, the multicolored succession of manners, the differences1 of peoples, and the vast variety of nations.","We clearly see a plan in everything; we see some things that seem wrong, but we must consider that if there is a reason for everything, there must also be a reason for the things that are apparently wrong. We see the reason but not the plan; if we do not know what the plan is, how can we say that certain things fall outside it? Just as a poet, say, a master of subtle rhythms, may introduce a dissonant line into a poem for reasons of rhythm, that is, for a reason that seems entirely contrary to its nature (and which a more prosaic critic would denounce as wrong), so the Creator may interpose in the majestic flow of his metaphysical rhythms things that our narrow reasoning perceives as mistakes. Neither, as I said, do I accept the theory of the cruel watchmaker. I agree it’s a more difficult argument to answer but only apparently so. We can say that we don’t really know what “bad” means, and cannot therefore state categorically that a thing is good or bad. What is certain is that pain, even if it is for our own good, is in itself bad and is in itself sufficient proof of the existence of evil in the world. One toothache is enough for us to disbelieve in the benevolence of the Creator. Now the essential defect of this argument would seem to lie in our complete ignorance of God’s plan, and our equal ignorance of what, as an intelligent being, the Intellectual Infinite might be like. The existence of evil is one thing, the reason for its existence quite another. The distinction is perhaps subtle to the point of sophistry, but it is accurate.","There are basically only two things in our earthly experience: the universal and the particular. To describe the universal is to describe what is common to all human souls and to all human experience – the broad sky, with day and night occurring in it and by it; the flowing of rivers, all with the same fresh and nunnish water; the vast waving mountains known as oceans, which hold the majesty of height in the secret of their depths; the fields, the seasons, houses, faces, gestures; clothes and smiles; love and wars; gods both finite and infinite; the formless Night, mother of the world’s origin; Fate, the intellectual monster that is everything… Describing these or any other universals, my soul speaks the primitive and divine language, the Adamic tongue that everyone understands. But what splintered, Babelish language would I use to describe the Santa Justa Lift,* the Reims Cathedral, the breeches worn by the Zouaves, or the way Portuguese is pronounced in the province of Trás-os-Montes? These are surface differences, the ground’s unevenness, which we can feel by walking but not by our abstract feeling. What’s universal in the Santa Justa Lift is the mechanical technology that makes life easier. What’s true in the Reims Cathedral is neither Reims nor the Cathedral but the religious splendour of buildings dedicated to understanding the human soul’s depths. What’s eternal in the Zouaves’ breeches is the colourful fiction of clothes, a human language whose social simplicity is, in a certain way, a new nakedness. What’s universal in local accents is the homely tone of voice in those who live spontaneously, the diversity within groups, the multicoloured parade of customs, the differences between peoples, and the immense variety of nations."
"Sinto e esqueço. Uma saudade, que é a de toda a gente por tudo, invade-me como um ópio do ar frio. Há em mim um êxtase de ver, íntimo e postiço.","I feel and forget.

There is in me an ecstasy of seeing, intimate and false.","delicious meal, the lunar scenery, the future Verlaine and the present me — in a diffuse refraction, in a false space between what I was and what I am.","I feel and forget. A nostalgia – the same one that everyone feels for everything – invades me as if it were an opium in the cold air. I have an inner, pseudo-ecstasy that comes from seeing."

É melhor, mesmo, do que o que poderiam escrever os melhores. Mas está infinitamente abaixo daquilo que eu, não sei porquê, sinto que podia — ou talvez seja, que devia — escrever. Choro sobre os meus versos maus da infância como sobre uma criança morta, um filho morto, uma última esperança que se fosse.","As a child, he already wrote verses. So I wrote very bad verses, but I thought they were perfect. Never again will I have the false pleasure of producing perfect work. What I write today is much better. It is even better than what the best could write. But it is infinitely below what I, I don't know why, feel like I could—or maybe I should—write. I cry over my bad childhood verses as over a dead child, a dead child, a last hope gone.","Moreover, some pages by Vieira, in all the cold perfection of his syntactical engineering, make me shiver like a branch in the wind, in the passive delirium of something set in motion. Like all great lovers, I enjoy the pleasure of losing myself, that pleasure in which one suffers wholeheartedly the delights of surrender. And that’s why I often write without even wanting to think, in an externalized daydream, letting the words caress me as if I were a little girl sitting on their lap.","I wrote my first poems when I was still a child. Though dreadful, they seemed perfect to me. I’ll never again be able to have the illusory pleasure of producing perfect work. What I write today is much better. It’s even better than what some of the best writers write. But it’s infinitely inferior to what I for some reason feel I could – or perhaps should – write.

To swear to you that it was I who left and not the landscape, that it was I who visited other lands and not they who visited me — I cannot do that to you. I who, not knowing what life is, don't even know if I'm the one who lives it if it's she who lives me (have that hollow verb ""live"" whatever meaning it wants to have), I'm certainly not going to swear anything to you.",,"I set out?

"Quando depunha o jornal sobre a mesa do café, já reflectia que o mesmo, na sua esfera, poderia dizer o caixeiro de praça, mais ou menos meu conhecido, que todos os dias almoça, como hoje está almoçando, na mesa ao fundo do canto. Tudo quanto o milionário teve, este homem teve; em menor grau, é certo, mas para a sua estatura. Os dois homens conseguiram o mesmo, nem há diferença de celebridade, porque aí também a diferença de ambientes estabelece a identidade. Não há ninguém no mundo que não conhecesse o nome do milionário americano; mas não há ninguém na praça de Lisboa que não conheça o nome do homem que está ali almoçando.","When he put the newspaper down on the coffee table, he already reflected that the same, in his sphere, could say the clerk of the square, more or less my acquaintance, who has lunch every day, as he is having lunch today, at the table in the back corner .

The two men achieved the same, there is no difference in celebrity, because there, too, the difference in environments establishes the identity. There is no one in the world who did not know the name of the American millionaire; but there is no one in Lisbon square who does not know the name of the man who is having lunch there.","The carts go snoring down the street, the sound slow and distinct, in keeping, it seems, with my own somnolent state. It’s lunchtime, but I’ve stayed behind in the office. The day is warm and slightly overcast. For some reason — possibly due to that somnolent state — the noises from the street reflect the kind of day it is.","As I laid the paper down on the restaurant table, I was already thinking how a similar article, narrowing the focus, could have been written about the firm’s sales representative, more or less my acquaintance, who’s eating lunch at the table in the back corner, as he does every day. All that the millionaire had, this man has – in smaller measure, to be sure, but abundantly for his stature. Both men have had equal success, and there isn’t even a difference in their fame, for here too we must see each man in his particular context. There’s no one in the world who doesn’t know the name of the American millionaire, but there’s no one in Lisbon’s commercial district who doesn’t know the name of the man eating lunch in the corner."

What there seems to be contempt between man and man, the indifferent thing that allows people to be killed without feeling that they are being killed, as among murderers, or without thinking that they are being killed, as among soldiers, is that no one pays due attention to the apparently abstruse fact that others are souls too.",How could I know myself today when I did not yesterday?

"Mas daquela vez em que uma malícia da oportunidade me fez julgar que amava, e verificar deveras que era amado, fiquei, primeiro, estonteado e confuso, como se me saíra uma sorte grande em moeda inconvertível. Fiquei, depois, porque ninguém é humano sem o ser, levemente envaidecido; esta emoção, porém, que pareceria a mais natural, passou rapidamente. Sucedeu-se um sentimento difícil de definir, mas em que se salientavam incomodamente as sensações de tédio, de humilhação e de fadiga.","But that time when a malice of opportunity made me think that I loved, and really verify that I was loved, I was, at first, stunned and confused, as if I had been lucky in an inconvertible coin. I remained, afterwards, because no one is human without being so, slightly flattered; this emotion, however, which would have seemed the most natural, passed quickly. There followed a feeling that was difficult to define, but in which the sensations of boredom, humiliation and fatigue stood out uncomfortably.","There is a torpor in the air of things unfulfilled. Above, the landscape of the sky falls silent. At this moment, when I almost overflow with feeling, I would like to have the wit simply to speak out and have as my destiny the capricious freedom of a style.","But on that occasion when circumstances mischievously led me to suppose that I loved and to verify that the other person truly loved me, my first reaction was of bewildered confusion, as if I’d won a grand prize in an unconvertible currency. And then, because no human can avoid being human, I felt a certain vanity; this emotion, however, which would seem to be the most natural one, quickly vanished. It was followed by an uncomfortable feeling that’s hard to define but that was composed of tedium, of humiliation, and of weariness."
"O ruído do dia humano aumenta de repente, como um som de sineta de chamada. Estala adentro da casa o fecho suave da primeira porta que se abre para viverem.

"Não sei porquê, passámos a cumprimentarmo-nos desde esse dia. Um dia qualquer, que nos aproximara talvez a circunstância absurda de coincidir virmos ambos jantar às nove e meia, entrámos em uma conversa casual. A certa altura ele perguntou-me se eu escrevia. Respondi que sim. Falei-lhe da revista Orpheu, que havia pouco aparecera. Ele elogiou-a, elogiou-a bastante, e eu então pasmei deveras.

"Passo por eles, subo qualquer das ruas suas afluentes, depois desço de novo essa rua, para a eles regressar.

"Seja a expressão do nosso rosto um sorriso pálido, como de alguém que vai chorar, um olhar vago, como de alguém que não quer ver, um desdém esparso por todas as feições, como o de alguém que despreza a vida e a vive apenas para ter que desprezar.","Whether the expression on our face is a pale smile, as of someone who is going to cry, a vacant look, as of someone who does not want to see, a disdain spread over every feature, like that of someone who despises life and lives it only to have to despise","I write like someone asleep, and my whole life is like a receipt awaiting signature.","May our facial expression consist of a wan smile, like that of someone who’s about to cry, a far-away gaze, like that of someone who doesn’t want to see, and a disdain in all its features, as when someone despises life and lives only to despise it."
"Não choro por nada que a vida traga ou leve. Há porém páginas de prosa que me têm feito chorar. Lembro-me, como do que estou vendo, da noite em que, ainda criança, li pela primeira vez numa selecta o passo célebre de Vieira sobre o Rei Salomão. “Fabricou Salomão um palácio…” E fui lendo, até ao fim, trémulo, confuso; depois rompi em lágrimas, felizes, como nenhuma felicidade real me fará chorar, como nenhuma tristeza da vida me fará imitar. Aquele movimento hierático da nossa clara língua majestosa, aquele exprimir das ideias nas palavras inevitáveis, correr de água porque há declive, aquele assombro vocálico em que os sons são cores ideais — tudo isso me toldou de instinto como uma grande emoção política. E, disse, chorei; hoje, relembrando, ainda choro. Não é — não — a saudade da infância de que não tenho saudades: é a saudade da emoção daquele momento, a mágoa de não poder já ler pela primeira vez aquela grande certeza sinfónica.","I don't cry for anything life brings or takes away. There are, however, pages of prose that have made me cry. I remember, like what I'm seeing, the night when, as a child, I read for the first time in a select collection Vieira's famous passage about King Solomon. “Solomon built a palace…” And I read until the end, trembling, confused; then I burst into tears, happy, as no real happiness will make me cry, as no sadness in life will make me imitate. That hieratic movement of our clear, majestic language, that expressing of ideas in inevitable words, running of water because there is a slope, that vowel astonishment in which sounds are ideal colors — all this instinctively clouded me like a great political emotion. And, I said, I cried; Today, remembering, I still cry. It's not — no — the nostalgia for childhood that I don't miss: it's the longing for the emotion of that moment, the regret of not being able to read that great symphonic certainty for the first time.","That’s what tires one more than life when life grows wearisome, and more than any knowledge of or meditation on life, which are never less than exhausting. I get up from the chair where, leaning distractedly on the table, I’ve been amusing myself setting down these rough and ready impressions. I get up, I make my body get up, and go over to the window, high above the rooftops, from where I can see the city settling to sleep in the slow beginnings of silence. The big, bright white moon sadly points out the ragged line of the terraced roofs and its icy light seems to illuminate all the mystery of the world. It seems to reveal everything and that everything is just shadows intermingled with dim light, false intervals, erratically absurd, the incoherent mutterings of the visible world. The absence of any breeze only seems to increase the mystery. I’m sick of abstract thoughts. I will never write a single page that will reveal myself or anything else. The lightest of clouds hovers vaguely above the moon as if it were the moon’s hiding place.","I weep over nothing that life brings or takes away, but there are pages of prose that have made me cry. I remember, as clearly as what’s before my eyes, the night when as a child I read for the first time, in an anthology, Vieira’s famous passage on King Solomon: ‘Solomon built a palace…’ And I read all the way to the end, trembling and confused. Then I broke into joyful tears – tears such as no real joy could make me cry, nor any of life’s sorrows ever make me shed. That hieratic movement of our clear majestic language, that expression of ideas in inevitable words, like water that flows because there’s a slope, that vocalic marvel in which the sounds are ideal colours – all of this instinctively seized me like an overwhelming political emotion. And I cried. Remembering it today, I still cry. Not out of nostalgia for my childhood, which I don’t miss, but because of nostalgia for the emotion of that moment, because of a heartfelt regret that I can no longer read for the first time that great symphonic certitude."
"Alguma coisa nova, ao menos, esta atitude me trouxe? Nem essa consolação se aproxima de mim.

Not even that consolation comes close to me. It was all already in Heraclitus and Ecclesiastes: Life is a child's play in the sand... vanity and affliction of spirit...

Todos os problemas são insolúveis. A essência de haver um problema é não haver uma solução. Procurar um facto significa não haver um facto. Pensar é não saber existir.,All problems are insoluble.

"O desgosto de não encontrar nada encontrei comigo pouco a pouco. Não achei razão nem lógica senão a um cepticismo que nem sequer buscava uma lógica para se defender. Em curar-me disto não pensei — por que me havia eu de curar disso? E o que era ser são? Que certeza tinha eu que esse estado de alma deva pertencer à doença? Quem nos afirma que, a ser doença, a doença não era mais desejável, ou mais lógica, ou mais ▢, do que a saúde? A ser a saúde preferível, por que era eu doente se não por naturalmente o ser, e se naturalmente o era, por que ir contra a Natureza, que para algum fim, se fim ela tem, me quereria decerto doente?","The displeasure of not finding anything found me little by little. I found no reason or logic other than a skepticism that did not even seek a logic to defend itself. I didn't think about being cured of this—why should I be cured of this? And what was it to be sane? How sure was I that this state of mind must belong to the disease? Who tells us that, if it were a disease, illness was not more desirable, or more logical, or more ▢, than health? If health were preferable, why was I sick if not naturally so, and if naturally I was, why go against Nature, which for some purpose, if it has an end, would certainly want me sick?","The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","I gradually discovered the frustration of discovering nothing. I could find no reason or logic for anything except a scepticism that didn’t even seek a self-justifying logic. It never occurred to me to cure myself of this. And indeed, why be cured of it? What would it mean to be ‘healthy’? How could I be sure that this attitude meant I was sick? And if I was sick, who’s to say that sickness wasn’t preferable or more logical or more than health? If health was preferable, then wasn’t I sick due to some natural cause? And if it was natural, why go against Nature, which for some purpose or other – if it has any purpose – must have wanted me to be sick?"

"Outrora gozava tudo isto, porém é só agora, talvez, que compreendo quanto o gozava. Entrava para a missa como para um grande mistério, e saía da missa como para uma clareira.

Só o ser que não crê e é adulto7, com alma que recorda e chora, são a ficção e o transtorno, o desalinho e a lajem fria.","I used to enjoy all this, but it is only now, perhaps, that I understand how much I enjoyed it.

I would enter Mass as into a great mystery, and come out at the end as into a clearing. And that’s how it really was, and how it still really is.

Only a paltry goal is worth aiming for, because only a paltry goal stands any chance of being achieved. If I want to put all my efforts into earning a fortune, I will, up to a point, achieve it, since all such paltry, quantitative goals, whether personal or not, are attainable and verifiable.

I’m not interested in knowing the identity, activities or opinions of the human creature whose outward appearance I see. The vast succession of persons and things that make up the world is for me an endless gallery of paintings, whose inner dimension doesn’t interest me. It doesn’t interest me, because the soul is monotonous and always the same in everybody; only its personal manifestations change, and the best part of the soul spills over into dreams, behaviour and gestures, thereby entering the painting which captivates me and in which I see faces that are faithful to my affection. A human creature, as far as I’m concerned, has no soul."

"Encontrei-me neste mundo certo dia, que não sei qual foi, e até ali, desde que evidentemente nascera, tinha vivido sem sentir. Se perguntei onde estava, todos me enganaram, e todos se contradiziam. Se pedi que me dissessem o que faria, todos me falaram falso, e cada um me disse uma coisa sua. Se, de não saber, parei no caminho, todos pasmaram que eu não seguisse para onde ninguém sabia o que estava, ou não voltasse para trás — eu, que, desperto na encruzilhada, não sabia de onde viera. Vi que estava em cena e não sabia o papel que os outros diziam logo, sem o saberem também. Vi que estava vestido de pajem, e não me deram a rainha, culpando-me de a não ter. Vi que tinha nas mãos a mensagem que entregar, e quando lhes disse que o papel estava branco, riram-se de mim. E ainda não sei se riram porque todos os papéis estão brancos, ou porque todas as mensagens se adivinham.","I found myself in this world one day, which I don't know, and until then, since I was evidently born, I had lived without feeling. If I asked where I was, everyone deceived me, and everyone contradicted themselves. If I asked them to tell me what they would do, they all told me false, and each one told me his own thing. If, not knowing, I stopped on the way, everyone was amazed that I didn't go where no one knew what I was, or didn't turn back - I, who, awake at the crossroads, didn't know where I came from. I saw that I was on the scene and I didn't know the role that the others were saying right away, without knowing it either. I saw that he was dressed as a page, and they didn't give me the queen, blaming me for not having her. I saw that I had the message to deliver in my hands, and when I told them that the paper was white, they laughed at me. And I still don't know if they laughed because all the papers are white, or because all the messages are guessed.","Years ago, when I was a child, I used to go to mass here (at least I think it was here, though it may have been somewhere else). Conscious of the importance of the occasion, I would put on my best suit and simply enjoy it all, even those things there was no reason to enjoy. I lived outwardly then and the suit I had on was brand new and spotless. What more could be wished for by someone who one day must die but who, holding tight to his mother’s hand, as yet knows nothing of death? Years ago I used to enjoy all this, perhaps that’s why only now do I realize how much I did enjoy it. For me going to mass was like penetrating a great mystery and leaving it was like stepping out into a clearing in the woods. And that is how it really was, and how it still is. Only the unbelieving adult, whose soul still remembers and weeps, only he is but fiction and turmoil, confusion and the cold grave.","One day, I don’t know which, I found myself in this world, having lived unfeelingly from the time I was evidently born until then. When I asked where I was, everyone misled me, and they contradicted each other. When I asked them to tell me what I should do, they all spoke falsely, and each one said something different. When in bewilderment I stopped on the road, everyone was shocked that I didn’t keep going to no one knew where, or else turn back – I, who’d woken up at the crossroads and didn’t know where I’d come from. I saw that I was on stage and didn’t know the part that everyone else recited straight off, also without knowing it. I saw that I was dressed as a page, but they didn’t give me the queen, and blamed me for not having her. I saw that I had a message in my hand to deliver, and when I told them that the sheet of paper was blank, they laughed at me. And I still don’t know if they laughed because all sheets are blank, or because all messages are to be guessed."

All of life is a dream. No one knows what he does, no one knows what he wants, no one knows what he knows. We sleep our lives away, the eternal children of Fate. That’s why, if I think with that feeling, I experience an immense, boundless tenderness for all of infantile humanity, for the somnambulist lives people lead, for everyone, for everything. What sweeps over me in such moments is a pure humanitarianism that draws no conclusions and knows no ulterior motives. I’m overwhelmed by tenderness as if I saw all this with the eyes of a god. I see everyone with the compassion of the only conscious being alive: poor men, poor humanity. What is it all doing here?","Ah, I understand!

E se quem a roubasse a queimasse, quão artista seria, que maior artista que aquele que a pintou!","How much more beautiful Gioconda since we couldn't see her! And if whoever stole it burned it, what an artist he would be, what greater artist than the one who painted it!","Nothing more. No, other people don’t exist … It is for me alone that the setting sun holds out its heavy wings of harsh, misty colors.","How much more beautiful the Mona Lisa would be if we couldn’t see it!

"Estas considerações vieram ter comigo depois de ler num jornal a notícia da grande vida múltipla de um homem célebre. Era um milionário americano, e tinha sido tudo. Tivera quanto ambicionara — dinheiro, amores, afectos, dedicações, viagens, colecções. Não é que o dinheiro possa tudo, mas o grande magnetismo, com que se obtém muito dinheiro, pode, efectivamente, quase tudo.","These considerations came to me after reading in a newspaper the news of the great multiple life of a famous man. He was an American millionaire, and that had been it. He'd had what he'd wanted—money, loves, affections, dedications, travel, collections. It's not that money can do everything, but the great magnetism with which you get a lot of money can, in fact, almost anything.","The Marques account should be debited not credited. (I can see him, fat and friendly and jokey, and in that moment, the ship disappears.) (If l were knocked down by a child’s bicycle, that bicycle would become part of my story.) 294 [1930?]","These thoughts occurred to me after reading a newspaper article about the great and multifaceted life of a celebrity – an American millionaire who had been everything. He had achieved all that he’d aspired to – money, love, friendship, recognition, travels, collections. Money can’t buy everything, but the personal magnetism that enables a man to make lots of money can, indeed, obtain most things."
"Hoje, como me oprimisse a sensação do corpo aquela angústia antiga que por vezes extravasa, não comi bem, nem bebi o costume, no restaurante, ou casa de pasto, em cuja sobreloja baseio a continuação da minha existência. E como, ao sair eu, o criado verificasse que a garrafa de vinho ficara em meio voltou-se para mim e disse: “Até logo, sr. Soares, e desejo as melhoras”.","Today, as the sensation of the body oppresses me that old anguish that sometimes overflows, I didn't eat well, nor drink the usual, in the restaurant, or the eating house, on whose mezzanine I base the continuation of my existence. And as, on my way out, the servant noticed that the bottle of wine had been left in the middle, he turned to me and said: “Good-bye, Mr. Soares, and I wish him well.”","The morning, half-cold, half-warm, winged its way over the scarce houses on the slopes of the hills at the outer edge of the city. On those drowsing slopes, a faint mist, full of awakening light, was gradually dissolving into nebulous shreds. (It wasn’t cold, apart from the chilly business of having to resume life.) And all of that — all that slow, light morning coolness — was like a joy he had never been able to feel.","Today, feeling almost physically ill because of that age-old anxiety which sometimes wells up, I ate and drank rather less than usual in the first-floor dining room of the restaurant responsible for perpetuating my existence. And as I was leaving, the waiter, having noted that the bottle of wine was still half full, turned to me and said: ‘So long, Senhor Soares, and I hope you feel better.’"
"Que rainha imperiosa guarda ao pé dos seus lagos a memória da minha vida partida? Fui o pajem de alamedas insuficientes às horas aves do meu sossego azul. Naus longe completaram o mar a ondear dos meus terraços, e nas nuvens do sul perdi minha alma, como um remo deixado cair.","What imperious queen keeps at the foot of her lakes the memory of my broken life? I was the page boy of insufficient avenues at the bird hours of my blue peace. Ships far away completed the sea rippling from my terraces, and in the southern clouds I lost my soul, like an oar dropped.","He had everything he could have wanted — money, love affairs, affection, devotion, travel, private art collections. Not that money can buy everything, but the magnetism that comes with great wealth can achieve almost anything. When I put the newspaper down on the table in the café, I was already thinking that the same could be said, in his own sphere, of the traveling salesman, an acquaintance of mine, who has lunch every day, as he is today, at the table in the corner at the back. Everything that millionaire had, he has too; to a lesser degree, of course, but far more than befits his status.","What imperious queen, standing by her ponds, holds on to the memory of my broken life? I was the pageboy of tree-lined paths that weren’t enough for the soaring moments of my blue peace. Ships in the distance completed the sea that lapped my terraces, and in the clouds towards the south I lost my soul, like an oar dropped in the water."

It’s not so much the natural things that affect me, that communicate that feeling so powerfully , it’s rather the arrangement of the streets, shop signs , the people talking to one another, their clothes, jobs, newspapers, the intelligence underlying everything. Or, rather, it’s the fact of the very existence of streets, shop signs, jobs, men and society, all getting on together, following familiar routes and setting out along new ones.","From any trip, even a short one, I return as from a slumber full of dreams – in a dazed confusion, with one sensation stuck to another, feeling drunk from what I saw."

I started to superimpose on the things seen, even when already dreamily seen, other dreams that I bring with me. Inattentive enough to do well what I called seeing things in a dream, even so, because this inattention was motivated by a perpetual daydream and a, also not overly attentive, preoccupation with the course of my dreams, I superimpose what I dream on the dream. that I see and intersect reality already stripped of matter with an absolute immaterial.",,"In my hands I can feel the shoddy, broken toy I was given out of some shoddy irony.

"O homem de ciência reconhece que a única realidade para si é ele próprio, e o único mundo real o mundo como a sua sensação lho dá. Por isso, em lugar de seguir o falso caminho de procurar ajustar as suas sensações às dos outros, fazendo ciência objectiva, procura, antes, conhecer perfeitamente o seu mundo, e a sua personalidade. Nada mais objectivo do que os seus sonhos. Nada mais seu do que a sua consciência de si. Sobre essas duas realidades requinta ele a sua ciência. É muito diferente já da ciência dos antigos científicos, que, longe de buscarem as leis da sua própria personalidade e a organização dos seus sonhos, procuravam as leis do “exterior” e a organização daquilo a que chamavam “Natureza”.","The man of science recognizes that the only reality for him is himself, and the only real world is the world as his sensation gives it. Therefore, instead of following the false path of trying to adjust his sensations to those of others, doing objective science, he seeks, rather, to know his world and his personality perfectly. Nothing more objective than your dreams. Nothing more yours than your self-awareness. On these two realities he refines his science. It is already very different from the science of the ancient scientists, who, far from seeking the laws of their own personality and the organization of their dreams, sought the laws of the “outside” and the organization of what they called “Nature”.",,"This is all that remains and will remain of one of the most subtly passive souls and one of the purest, most profligate dreamers that the world has ever known. I doubt that any outwardly human creature has lived their consciousness of self in a more complex fashion. A dandy in spirit, he promenaded the art of dreaming through the randomness of existing. This book is the autobiography of a man who never existed."
"A vaidade, quando existe só, sem acrescentamento de orgulho, o que é possível porém raro, manifesta-se, no seu resultado, pela audácia. Quem tem a certeza de que os outros vêem nele valor nada receia deles. Pode haver coragem física sem vaidade; pode haver coragem moral sem vaidade; não pode haver audácia sem vaidade. E por audácia se entende a confiança na iniciativa. A audácia pode ser desacompanhada de coragem, física ou moral, pois estas disposições da índole são de ordem diferente, e com ela incomensuráveis.","Vanity, when it exists alone, without the addition of pride, which is possible but rare, manifests itself, in its result, by audacity. Anyone who is sure that others see value in him has nothing to fear from them. There can be physical courage without vanity; there can be moral courage without vanity; there can be no audacity without vanity. And by audacity is meant trust in the initiative. Audacity can be unaccompanied by courage, physical or moral, for these dispositions of the nature are of a different order, and with it incommensurable.","To consider our greatest anguish an incident of no importance, not just in terms of the life of the universe, but in terms of our own souls, is the beginning of knowledge.","Vanity all by itself, unaccompanied by pride, which is rare but possible, manifests itself through audacity. One who is certain that others think highly of him will fear nothing from them. Both physical courage and moral courage can exist without vanity, but audacity cannot. And by audacity I mean boldness in taking the initiative. Audacity can exist without physical or moral courage, for these character traits are of a different, incommensurable order."

"Como então me não engano sobre os meus íntimos processos de ilusão de mim? Porque o processo que arranca para uma realidade mais que real um aspecto do mundo ou uma figura de sonho, arranca também para mais que real uma emoção ou um pensamento; despe-o portanto de todo o apetrecho de nobre ou puro quando, o que quase sempre acontece, o não é. Repare-se que a minha objectividade é absoluta, a mais absoluta de todas. Eu crio o objecto absoluto, com qualidades de absoluto no seu concreto. Eu não fugi à vida propriamente, no sentido de procurar para a minha alma uma cama mais suave, apenas mudei de vida e encontrei nos meus sonhos a mesma objectividade que encontrava na vida. Os meus sonhos — noutra página estudo isto — erguem-se independentes da minha vontade e muitas vezes me chocam e me ferem. Muitas vezes o que descubro em mim me desola, me envergonha (talvez por um resto de humano em mim — o que é a vergonha?) e me assusta.","How, then, am I not mistaken about my intimate processes of illusion of myself? Because the process that pulls an aspect of the world or a dream figure to a more than real reality, also pulls an emotion or a thought to more than real; It therefore strips it of all the noble or pure paraphernalia when, which almost always happens, it is not. Note that my objectivity is absolute, the most absolute of all. I create the absolute object, with qualities of the absolute in its concrete. I didn't run away from life itself, in the sense of looking for a softer bed for my soul, I just changed my life and found in my dreams the same objectivity I found in life. My dreams — I study this on another page — arise independently of my will and often shock and hurt me. Often what I discover in myself upsets me, embarrasses me (perhaps because of a human remnant in me — what is shame?) and scares me.",,"The absurdity of the sentence speaks for me. This is one of those days in which I’ve never had a future. There’s just a static present, surrounded by a wall of anxiety. The other side of the river, as long as it’s the other side, is not this side; that is the root cause of all my suffering. There are many boats destined for many ports, but no boat for life to stop hurting, nor a landing-place where we can forget everything. All of this occurred a long time ago, but my grief is even older. On days of the soul like today I feel, in my awareness of every bodily pore, like the sad child who was beaten up by life.

Não sonho o intervalo certo, mas reparo, como se começasse a despertar de um sono não dormido, os primeiros ruídos da vida da cidade, a subir, como uma cheia2, do lugar3 vago, lá em baixo, onde ficam as ruas que Deus fez. São sons alegres, coados pela tristeza da chuva que há, ou, talvez, que houve — pois a não oiço agora — só o cinzento excessivo da luz frinchada até mais longe que me dá, nas sombras de uma claridade frouxa, insuficiente4 para a altura da madrugada, que não sei qual é… São sons alegres e dispersos e doem-me no coração5 como se me viessem, com eles, chamar a um exame ou a uma execução. Cada dia, se o oiço raiar da cama onde ignoro, me parece o dia de um grande acontecimento meu que não terei coragem para enfrentar. Cada dia, se o sinto erguer-se do leito das sombras, com um cair de roupas da cama pelas ruas e pelas vielas, vem chamar-me a um tribunal. Vou ser julgado em cada hoje que há. E o condenado perene que há em mim agarra-se ao leito como à mãe que perdeu, e acaricia o travesseiro como se a ama o defendesse de gentes.","I don't know if I sleep, or if I just feel that I sleep. I don't dream of the right interval, but I notice, as if I were beginning to wake up from a sleepless sleep, the first sounds of city life, rising, like a flood, from the vacant place3, down there, where the streets that God made are. . They are happy sounds, strained by the sadness of the rain that there is, or, perhaps, that there was - because I don't hear it now - only the excessive gray of the cracked light even farther that gives me, in the shadows of a weak clarity, insufficient4 for the height. in the early morning, which I don't know what it is… They are happy and scattered sounds and my heart hurts5 as if they came to call me to an exam or an execution. Every day, if I hear it rise from the bed where I ignore it, it seems to me the day of a great event of mine that I won't have the courage to face. Every day, if I feel him rising from the bed of the shadows, with bedclothes falling through the streets and alleys, he comes to call me to court. I will be judged on every today there is. And the perennial damned in me clings to the bed like the mother he lost, and caresses the pillow as if the nurse defended him from people.","Only then did I notice that there was something else in the street apart from the street lamps: a diffuse moonlight, hidden and silent, full of nothing, like life …","I don’t know if I’m sleeping or if I just feel as if I were. I’m not exactly dreaming but seem, rather, to be waking up from a sleepless slumber, for I hear the city’s first sounds of life rising like floodwaters from that vague place down below, where the streets made by God run this way and that. The sounds are happy, filtered through the sadness of the rain that’s falling, or that perhaps has stopped falling, for I don’t hear it any more; I’m aware only of the excessive greyness it gives to the light that’s advancing through the cracks, in the shadows of a clarity too faint for this time of morning, whatever time that may be. The sounds are happy, scattered, and painful to my heart,* as if they were calling me to an exam or an execution. Each new day, if I hear it break from the bed of my sweet oblivion, seems like the day of a great event in my life that I won’t have the courage to face. Each new day, if I feel it rise from its bed of shadows as linens fall in the lanes and streets, comes to summon me to a court of law. Each new day, I’m going to be judged. And the man in me who is perpetually condemned clings to his bed as to the mother he lost, and fondles the pillow as if his nursemaid could protect him from people."
"Envelheci pelas sensações... Gastei-me gerando os pensamentos... E a minha vida passou a ser uma febre metafísica, sempre descobrindo sentidos ocultos nas coisas, brincando com o fogo das analogias misteriosas, procrastinando a lucidez integral, a síntese normal para se denegrir [?].","I grew old through sensations... I spent myself generating thoughts... And my life became a metaphysical fever, always discovering hidden meanings in things, playing with the fire of mysterious analogies, procrastinating integral lucidity, normal synthesis to denigrate [?].","The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","Sensations aged me. Too much thinking wore me out. My life became a metaphysical fever, always searching for the occult meanings of things, playing with the fire of mysterious analogies, denigrating [?] itself by putting off full lucidity and normal synthesis."

"Os males da inteligência, infelizmente, doem menos que os do sentimento, e os do sentimento, infelizmente, menos que os do corpo. Digo “infelizmente” porque a dignidade humana exigiria o avesso. Não há sensação angustiada do mistério que possa doer como o amor, o ciúme, a saudade, que possa sufocar como o medo físico intenso, que possa transformar como a cólera ou a ambição. Mas também nenhuma dor das que esfacelam a alma consegue ser tão realmente dor como a dor de dentes, ou a das cólicas, ou (suponho) a dor de parto.","The ills of intelligence, unfortunately, hurt less than those of feeling, and those of feeling, unfortunately, less than those of the body. I say “unfortunately” because human dignity would demand the reverse. There is no anguished sense of mystery that can hurt like love, jealousy, longing, that can suffocate like intense physical fear, that can transform like anger or ambition. But no pain that shatters the soul can be as truly pain as toothache, or colic, or (I suppose) pain in childbirth.","All my life I have been narrating myself, and if I lean over to observe the very least of my tediums, it blossoms, by virtue of some magnetism of […], into flowers the colors of musical abysses. 289 [1930?] When I consider the vast literary output — or if not vast then fairly extensive and complete — of many of the people I know or know of, I do feel a kind of envy, a scornful admiration, an incoherent blend of mixed emotions. The ability to complete something, whether good or bad — and while it will never be entirely good, it will often not be entirely bad either —","The ailments of our intelligence unfortunately hurt less than those of our feelings, and those of our feelings unfortunately less than those of the body. I say ‘unfortunately’ because human dignity would require it to be the other way around. There is no mental anguish vis-à-vis the unknown that can hurt us like love or jealousy or nostalgia, that can overwhelm us like intense physical fear, or that can transform us like anger or ambition. But neither can any pain that ravishes the soul be as genuinely painful as a toothache, a stomach-ache, or the pain (I imagine) of childbirth."
"O ambiente é a alma das coisas. Cada coisa tem uma expressão própria, e essa expressão vem-lhe de fora. Cada coisa é a intersecção de três linhas, e essas três linhas formam essa coisa: uma quantidade de matéria, o modo como interpretamos, e o ambiente em que está. Esta mesa, a que estou escrevendo, é um pedaço de madeira, é uma mesa, e é um móvel entre outros aqui neste quarto. A minha impressão desta mesa, se a quiser transcrever, terá que ser composta das noções de que ela é de madeira, de que eu chamo àquilo uma mesa e lhe atribuo certos usos e fins, e de que nela se reflectem, nela se inserem, e a transformam, os objectos em cuja justaposição ela tem alma externa, o que lhe está posto em cima. E a própria cor que lhe foi dada, o desbotamento dessa cor, as nódoas e partidos que tem — tudo isso, repare-se, lhe veio de fora, e é isso que, mais que a sua essência de madeira, lhe dá a alma. E o íntimo dessa alma, que é o ser mesa, também lhe foi dado de fora, que é a personalidade.","The environment is the soul of things. Each thing has an expression of its own, and that expression comes from outside. Each thing is the intersection of three lines, and these three lines form that thing: a quantity of matter, the way we interpret it, and the environment it is in. This table, the one I'm writing to, is a piece of wood, it's a table, and it's one piece of furniture among others here in this room. My impression of this table, if I want to transcribe it, will have to be composed of the notions that it is made of wood, that I call it a table and attribute certain uses and ends to it, and that they are reflected in it, inserted in it, and transform it, the objects in whose juxtaposition it has an external soul, what is placed on top of it. And the very color that was given to it, the fading of that color, the stains and breaks it has — all this, mind you, came from outside, and that, more than its wood essence, gives it its soul. . And the innermost part of this soul, which is the table being, was also given to it from outside, which is the personality.","Atmosphere constitutes the soul of things. Each thing has its own mode of expression and that expression comes from without. Each thing is the intersection of three lines which, together, shape that thing: a quantity of material, the way in which we interpret it and the atmosphere in which it exists. This table at which I’m writing is a piece of wood, it is a table and one of the pieces of furniture in this room. My impression of this table, if I wanted to transcribe it, would have to be made up of various notions: that it is made of wood, that I call it a table and attribute to it certain uses and purposes, and that in it are reflected or inserted the objects in whose presence it acquires its external soul, the things that are imposed on it and that transform it. And the color it was given, the way that color has faded, the knots and splits it contains, all of this, you will notice, comes from without and, more than its innate woodenness, these are what give it soul. And the inner kernel of that soul, the being a table, that is, its personality, also comes from without.","The environment is the soul of things. Each thing has its own expression and this expression comes from outside it. Each thing is the intersection of three lines, and these three lines form the thing: a certain quantity of material, the way in which we interpret it, and the environment it’s in. This table on which I’m writing is a block of wood, it’s the table, and it’s a piece of furniture among others in the room. My impression of this table, if I wish to transcribe it, will be composed of the notions that it is made of wood, that I call it a table and attribute certain uses to it, and that it receives, reflects and is transformed by the objects placed on top of it, in whose juxtaposition it has an external soul. And its very colour, the fading of that colour, its spots and cracks – all came from outside it, and this (more than its wooden essence) is what gives it its soul. And the core of that soul, its being a table, also came from the outside, which is its personality."

Veste teu ser do ouro da tarde morta, como um rei deposto numa manhã de rosas, com Maio nas nuvens brancas e o sorriso das virgens nas quintas afastadas. Tua ânsia morra entre mirtos, teu tédio cesse entre tamarindos e o som da água acompanhe tudo isto como um entardecer ao pé de margens, e o rio, sem sentido salvo correr, eterno, para marés longínquas. O resto é a vida que nos deixa, a chama que morre no nosso olhar, a púrpura gasta antes de a vestirmos, a lua que vela o nosso abandono, as estrelas que estendem o seu silêncio sobre a nossa hora de desengano. Assídua, a mágoa estéril e amiga que nos aperta ao peito com amor.","Be indifferent. Love the sunset and the dawn, because there is no use, even for you, in loving them.

Your eagerness dies among myrtles, your boredom ceases among tamarinds and the sound of the water accompanies all this like a sunset at the foot of the banks, and the river, meaningless save running, eternal, to distant tides. The rest is the life that leaves us, the flame that dies in our eyes, the purple spent before we wear it, the moon that watches over our abandonment, the stars that extend their silence over our hour of disillusionment. Assiduous, the sterile and friendly sorrow that holds us to our chests with love.","Everything I see is, for me, the purely visible, be it the vast blue, green-tinged sky of the coming morning, be it the false grimace of pain on the face of someone watching the death of a loved one and aware that he is being watched.","Be indifferent.

Let your yearning perish among myrtles, your tedium cease among tamarinds, and may the sound of water accompany all of this as if it were twilight on the banks of a river whose only meaning is to flow – eternal – towards distant seas. The rest is but the life that leaves us, the sparkle in our eyes that fades, the purple robes worn thin even before we don them, the moon that shines down on our exile, the stars that spread their silence over our hour of disillusionment.

À vida nunca pedi senão que passasse por mim sem que eu a sentisse. Do amor apenas exigi que nunca deixasse de ser um sonho longínquo. Nas minhas próprias paisagens interiores, irreais todas elas, foi sempre o longínquo que me atraiu, e os aquedutos que se esfumavam — quase na distância das minhas paisagens sonhadas, tinham uma doçura de sonho em relação às outras partes da paisagem — uma doçura que fazia com que eu as pudesse amar.","I never pretended to be anything but a dreamer.

"Quando o dia se ajusta a estas sensações, como hoje, que, ainda que estio, está meio nublado com azuis, e um vago vento que por não ser quente é quase frio, então aquele estado de alma se acentua em que pensamos, sentimos, vivemos estas impressões. Não que sejam mais claras as memórias, as esperanças, os desejos que tínhamos. Mas sente-se mais, e a sua soma incerta pesa um pouco, absurdamente, sobre o coração.","When the day adjusts to these sensations, like today, which, even though it's dry, is half cloudy with blues, and a vague wind that, because it's not hot, is almost cold, then that state of mind is accentuated in which we think, feel, we live these impressions.

"A luz tornara-se de um amarelo exageradamente lento, de um amarelo sujo de lividez. Haviam crescido os intervalos entre as coisas, e os sons, mais espaçados de uma maneira nova, davam-se desligadamente. Quando se ouviam acabavam de repente, como que cortados. O calor, que parecia ter aumentado, parecia estar, ele calor, frio. Pela leve frincha das portas encostadas da janela via-se a atitude de exagerada expectativa da única árvore visível. O seu verde era outro. O silêncio entrara-lhe com a cor. Na atmosfera haviam-se fechado pétalas. E na própria composição do espaço uma interrelação diferente de qualquer coisa como planos havia alterado e quebrado o modo dos sons, das luzes e das cores usarem a extensão.","The light had turned an exaggeratedly slow yellow, a dirty yellow with lividity. The intervals between things had grown, and the sounds, more spaced out in a new way, were given disconnectedly. When they were heard, they ended suddenly, as if cut off. The heat, which seemed to have increased, seemed to be hot, cold. Through the slight crack in the doors leaning against the window, the attitude of exaggerated expectation of the only visible tree could be seen. His green was different. The silence had entered him with color. In the atmosphere petals had closed. And in the composition of space itself, an interrelationship unlike anything like planes had altered and broken the way sounds, lights, and colors used extension.","My eyes fill with tears, and the taste of chocolate mingles with the taste of my past happiness, my lost childhood, and I cling voluptuously to that sweet pain. The simplicity of this ritual tasting does not detract from the solemnity of the occasion. But it is cigarette smoke that most subtly rebuilds past moments for me. lt just barely touches my consciousness of having a sense of taste and that’s why, part wrapped in gauze, part transparent, it evokes hours to which I am now dead, makes far-off times present, makes them mistier the closer they wrap about me, more ethereal when I make them flesh. A mentholated cigarette or a cheap cigar can bathe in tenderness almost any moment from my past. With what subtle plausibility I use that combination of taste and smell to reconstruct dead scenes and perform the comedies from my past, as distant, bored and malicious as the eighteenth century, as irredeemably lost to me as the Middle Ages.","The light had become an extremely sluggish yellow, a yellow that was filthy white. The distance between things had increased, and sounds were spaced differently, disconnectedly, and farther apart. As soon as they were heard, they suddenly ceased, as if cut short. The heat, which seemed to have intensified, was cold, though it was still heat. Through the crack between the window’s two shutters, the only visible tree displayed an exaggeratedly expectant attitude. It had a different kind of green, which infused it with silence. The atmosphere, like a flower, had closed its petals. And in the composition of space itself, a different interrelationship of something like planes had changed and fragmented the way that sounds, lights and colours use space."

E então, porque o espírito humano tende naturalmente para criticar porque sente, e não porque pensa, a maioria desses jovens escolheu a Humanidade para sucedâneo de Deus. Pertenço, porém, àquela espécie de homens que estão sempre na margem daquilo a que pertencem, nem vêem só a multidão de que são, senão também os grandes espaços que há ao lado. Por isso nem abandonei Deus tão amplamente como eles, nem aceitei nunca a Humanidade. Considerei que Deus, sendo improvável, poderia ser, podendo pois dever ser adorado; mas que a Humanidade, sendo uma mera ideia biológica, e não significando mais que a espécie animal humana, não era mais digna de adoração do que qualquer outra espécie animal. Este culto da Humanidade, com seus ritos de Liberdade e Igualdade, pareceu-me sempre uma revivescência dos cultos antigos, em que animais eram como deuses, ou os deuses tinham cabeças de animais.","I was born at a time when most young people had lost belief in God, for the same reason their elders had—without knowing why. And then, because the human spirit naturally tends to criticize because it feels, and not because it thinks, most of these young people chose Humanity to replace God. I belong, however, to that kind of men who are always on the margins of what they belong to, not only seeing the multitude of which they are, but also the large spaces that are beside them. That's why I didn't abandon God as widely as they did, nor did I ever accept Humanity. I considered that God, being improbable, might be, and could therefore be worshipped; but that Humanity, being a mere biological idea, and meaning no more than the human animal species, was no more worthy of worship than any other animal species. This cult of Humanity, with its rites of Freedom and Equality, always seemed to me to be a revival of the ancient cults, in which animals were like gods, or the gods had the heads of animals.","[29 Mar 1930] I was born at a time when most young people had lost their belief in God for much the same reason that their elders had kept theirs — without knowing why. And so, because the human spirit tends naturally to criticize because it feels rather than because it thinks, most of those young people chose Humanity as a substitute for God. I belong, however, to that species of man who is always on the edge of the thing he belongs to, who sees not only the crowd of which he forms a part, but also the great spaces all around. That’s why I did not abandon God as wholeheartedly as they did, nor did I ever accept Humanity as a replacement. I considered that God, because unlikely, just might exist and might therefore deserve to be worshipped, but that Humanity, being a mere biological idea designating nothing more than the human race itself, was no more deserving of worship than any other animal species. This worship of Humanity, with its rituals of Liberty and Equality, always struck me as being like a revival of the ancient cults, in which animals were gods or the gods bore the heads of animals.","I was born in a time when the majority of young people had lost faith in God, for the same reason their elders had had it – without knowing why. And since the human spirit naturally tends to make judgements based on feeling instead of reason, most of these young people chose Humanity to replace God. I, however, am the sort of person who is always on the fringe of what he belongs to, seeing not only the multitude he’s a part of but also the wide-open spaces around it. That’s why I didn’t give up God as completely as they did, and I never accepted Humanity. I reasoned that God, while improbable, might exist, in which case he should be worshipped; whereas Humanity, being a mere biological idea and signifying nothing more than the animal species we belong to, was no more deserving of worship than any other animal species. The cult of Humanity, with its rites of Freedom and Equality, always struck me as a revival of those ancient cults in which gods were like animals or had animal heads."
"Numa hora como esta, vazia e imponderável, apraz-me conduzir voluntariamente o pensamento para uma meditação que nada seja, mas que retenha, na sua limpidez de nula, qualquer coisa da frieza erma do dia esclarecido, com o fundo negro ao longe, e certas intuições, como gaivotas, evocando por contraste o mistério de tudo em grande negrume.","At a time like this, empty and imponderable, I like to voluntarily lead my thought towards a meditation that is nothing, but that retains, in its void limpidity, something of the bleak coldness of the enlightened day, with the black background in the distance, and certain intuitions, like seagulls, evoking by contrast the mystery of everything in great blackness.","At such empty, fathomless moments, I like to guide my thoughts into a meditation, which is nothing in itself, but retains in its empty lucidity something of the solitary cold of the brightening day with its backdrop of distant black clouds and certain intuitive feelings which, like the seagulls, evoke by way of contrast the mystery of everything in the gloom.","At empty and imponderable times like this, I like to employ my thoughts in a meditation that’s nothing at all but that captures, in its void transparency, something of the desolate chill in the cleared-up day, with the black sky in the background, and certain intuitions – like seagulls – which evoke by way of contrast the mystery of everything shrouded in darkness."
"… e um profundo e tediento desdém por todos quantos trabalham para a humanidade, por todos quantos se batem pela pátria e dão a sua vida para que a civilização continue…","… and a deep and boring disdain for all those who work for humanity, for all those who fight for their country and give their lives for civilization to continue…","I slowly shut the book and raise my eyes, weary with unshed tears, and of all the mingled feelings this arouses, I feel more than anything a sense of sadness that the closing of the office may mean the ending of my dream; that the gesture of my hand closing the book may mean covering up my own irreparable past; that I will go to the bed of life not in the least tired, but companionless and troubled, caught in the ebb and flow of my confused consciousness, twin tides flowing in the black night, at the outer limits of nostalgia and desolation.","… and a deep and weary disdain for all those who work for mankind, for all those who fight for their country and give their lives so that civilization may continue…"
"Na perfeição nítida do dia estagna contudo o ar cheio de sol. Não é a pressão presente da trovoada futura, mal-estar dos corpos involuntários, vago baço do céu azul deveras. É o torpor sensível da insinuação do ócio, pluma roçando leve a face a adormecer. É estio mas verão. Apetece o campo até a quem não gosta dele.","In the clear perfection of the day, however, the sun-filled air stagnates. It is not the present pressure of the future thunderstorm, the malaise of involuntary bodies, the vague haze of the blue sky indeed. It is the sensitive torpor of the insinuation of idleness, a feather lightly brushing the sleeping face. It's summer but summer. Even those who don't like the countryside like it.","[16 July 1932] Convalescence, especially if the preceding illness affected one’s nerves, has a sort of gay sadness about it. There is a touch of autumn in all one’s emotions and thoughts, or rather one feels like one of those early spring days when the air and sky seem more like autumn than spring, except, of course, that no leaves fall.","In the day’s limpid perfection, the sun-filled air nevertheless stagnates. It’s not the present pressure of the future storm, not a malaise in our involuntary bodies, not a vague haziness in the truly blue sky. It’s the torpor that the thought of not working makes us feel, a feather tickling our dozing face. It’s sultry but it’s summer. The countryside appeals even to those who don’t like it."
"Às vezes quando, abatido e humilde, a própria força de sonhar se me desfolha e se me seca, e o meu único sonho só pode ser1 o pensar nos meus sonhos, folheio-os então, como a um livro que se folheia e se torna a folhear sem ler mais que palavras inevitáveis. É então que me interrogo sobre quem tu és, figura que atravessas todas as minhas antigas visões demoradas de paisagens outras2, e de interiores antigos e de cerimoniais faustosos de silêncio. Em todos os meus sonhos ou apareces, sonho, ou, realidade falsa, me acompanhas. Visito contigo regiões que são talvez sonhos teus, terras que são talvez corpos teus de ausência e desumanidade, o teu corpo essencial descontornado para planície calma e monte de perfil frio em jardim de palácio oculto. Talvez eu não tenha outro sonho senão tu, talvez seja nos teus olhos, encostando a minha face à tua, que eu lerei essas paisagens impossíveis, esses tédios falsos, esses sentimentos que habitam a sombra dos meus cansaços e as grutas dos meus desassossegos. Quem sabe se as paisagens dos meus sonhos não são o meu modo de não te sonhar? Eu não sei quem tu és, mas sei ao certo o que sou? Sei eu o que é sonhar para que saiba o que vale o chamar-te o meu sonho? Sei eu se não és uma parte, quem sabe se a parte essencial e real, de mim? E sei eu se não sou eu o sonho e tu a realidade, eu um sonho teu e não tu um Sonho que eu sonhe?","Sometimes, when, dejected and humble, the very strength of dreaming strips me of its leaves and dries me up, and my only dream can only be to think about my dreams, then I leaf through them, like a book that is leafed through and becomes to leaf through without reading more than inevitable words. It is then that I ask myself who you are, a figure that passes through all my old long visions of other landscapes2, and of ancient interiors and lavish ceremonials of silence. In all my dreams you either appear, dream, or, false reality, you accompany me. I visit with you regions that are perhaps your dreams, lands that are perhaps your bodies of absence and inhumanity, your essential body set aside for calm plains and hills with a cold profile in a hidden palace garden. Maybe I have no other dream but you, maybe it's in your eyes, touching my face to yours, that I'll read these impossible landscapes, these false boredoms, these feelings that inhabit the shadow of my fatigue and the caves of my unrest. Who knows if the landscapes of my dreams are not my way of not dreaming of you? I don't know who you are, but do I know for sure what I am? Do I know what it's like to dream so that you know what it's worth to call you my dream? I know if you are not a part, who knows if the essential and real part of me? And do I know if it's not me the dream and you the reality, I a dream of yours and not you a Dream that I dream?",,"Do I survive myself? I keep on living. Dreaming? But dreaming is part of life. Do we live our dreams? We live. Do we only dream them? We die. And death is part of life. Life pursues us like our own shadow. And that shadow disappears only when there’s nothing but shadow. Only when we surrender to it does life stop pursuing us. The most painful thing about dreaming is our not existing. In reality, we cannot dream. What does it mean to possess? We don’t know. So how is it possible to possess anything? You will say that we don’t know what life is, and yet we live… But do we really live? To live without knowing what life is – is that living? THE LAKE OF POSSESSION (II) Be it atoms or souls, nothing interpenetrates, which is why possession is impossible. From truth to a handkerchief – nothing is possessable. Property isn’t a theft: it’s nothing. * A LETTER (I) For some indefinite number of months you’ve seen me looking at you, constantly looking at you, always with the same hesitant and solicitous gaze. I know you’ve noticed this. And since you’ve noticed, you must have thought it strange that this gaze, which can’t really be called shy, has never intimated a meaning. Always attentive, vague and unchanging, as if satisfied to be only the sadness of all this… Nothing else… And when you’ve thought about this – regardless of what you feel when you think about me – you must have considered my possible intentions. You must have reasoned, without being too convinced, that I’m either an eccentric version of the shy type or else something on the order of a madman. I can assure you, Madam, with respect to my habit of looking at you, that I am not merely bashful nor positively mad. I am, first and foremost, something else, as I shall explain, without much hope you’ll believe me. How often I’ve whispered to my dream of you: ‘Do your duty as a useless amphora; fulfil your calling as a mere vessel.’ What nostalgia I felt for the idea I wanted to have of you when I learned, one day, that you were married! What a tragic day in my life that was! I wasn’t jealous of your husband. It had never even occurred to me to wonder if you had one. I simply felt nostalgia for my idea of you. Were I to learn the absurd fact that a woman in a painting – yes, a painting – was married, I would feel just as sorry. Possess you? I don’t know how that might be done. And even if I had the human stain of knowing how, what a disgrace I would be to myself, what a flagrant insult to my own greatness were I even to think of putting myself on a par with your husband! Possess you? One evening when you happen to be alone on a dark street, an attacker can subdue and possess you. He can even fertilize you, leaving behind a trace of himself in your womb. If possessing you means to possess your body, what good is that? The attacker doesn’t possess your soul? But how is a soul possessed? And is there a lover clever enough to be able to possess your ‘soul’.....? I leave the job to your husband. Or do you expect me to stoop to his level? How many hours I’ve spent in secret company with my idea of you! How much we’ve loved each other in my dreams! But I swear that even there I’ve never dreamed of possessing you. I’m a courteous and chaste man, even in my dreams. I have respect for the mere idea of a beautiful woman. ♦ I wouldn’t know how to make my soul interested in having my body possess yours. The very idea makes me trip in myself over unseen obstacles, and I get all tangled up in obscure inner webs. Imagine what would happen to me if I really wanted to possess you! I would, I repeat, be incapable of trying to do it. I can’t even make myself dream of doing it. These, Madam, are the words I have to write in response to your involuntarily interrogative glance. It is in this book that you’ll first read this letter to you. If you don’t realize it’s for you, it won’t matter. I write to entertain myself more than to tell you anything. Only business letters are addressed to other people. The rest of one’s letters, at least for a superior soul, should be exclusively from and to oneself. I have nothing else to say to you. Be assured that I esteem you as much as I can. I should be pleased if you sometimes think of me. A LETTER (II) Ah, if only you understood your duty to be merely a dreamer’s dream. To be nothing but the censer in the cathedral of reveries. To trace your gestures like dreams, like mere windows opening on to new landscapes in your soul. To model your body so perfectly after dreams that no one could look at you without thinking of something else, since you would call to mind everything in the world but you, and to see you would be to hear music and to sleepwalk across vast landscapes with stagnant ponds, through hazy and quiet forests lost in the depths of ages past, where other invisible couples experience feelings we don’t have. The only thing I’d ever want you for is to not have you. If I were dreaming and you appeared, I’d want to be able to imagine I was still dreaming, perhaps without even seeing you, though perhaps noticing that the moonlight had filled the stagnant ponds with and that echoes of songs were suddenly rippling through the great inexplicit forest, lost in impossible ages. My vision of you would be the bed where my soul would lie down and sleep, like a sick child, to dream once more of other skies. If you could talk? Yes, but only if hearing you wouldn’t be hearing you but seeing great bridges joining the two dark shores of a moonlit river leading to the ancient sea where the caravels are forever ours. You smile? I hadn’t realized, but the stars were coursing my inner skies. You call me in my sleep. I hadn’t noticed, but from that far-flung boat whose dreamed sail was cutting the moonlight, I can see distant coasts. LUCID DIARY My life: a tragedy booed off stage by the gods,* never getting beyond the first act. Friends: not one. Just a few acquaintances who imagine they feel something for me and who might be sorry if a train ran over me and the funeral was on a rainy day. The logical reward of my detachment from life is the incapacity I’ve created in others to feel anything for me. There’s an aureole of indifference, an icy halo, that surrounds me and repels others. I still haven’t succeeded in not suffering from my solitude. It’s hard to achieve that distinction of spirit whereby isolation becomes a repose without anguish. I put no faith in the friendship I was shown, and I wouldn’t have put any in love had I been shown love, which wouldn’t even have been possible. Although I never harboured illusions about those who claimed to be my friends, I inevitably managed to feel disillusioned with them – such is my complex and subtle destiny of suffering. I never doubted that everyone would let me down, and I was always dumbfounded when they did. When the thing I was expecting happened, it always hit me like something unexpected. Having never discovered qualities in myself that might attract someone else, I could never believe that anyone felt attracted to me. This opinion of myself would be stupidly modest, if facts on facts – those unexpected facts I expected – didn’t always confirm it. I can’t even imagine receiving affection out of pity, for although physically ungainly and unappealing, I’m not organically malformed enough to enter the sphere of those who deserve the world’s pity, nor do I have the winsomeness that attracts pity even when it’s not clearly deserved; and what in me deserves pity can’t have it, for there is no pity for the lame in spirit. So I fell into the centre of gravity of the world’s disdain, in which I tend towards the fellow feeling of nobody. My entire life has been a struggle to adapt to this circumstance without being overwhelmed by its cruelty and humiliation. It takes a certain intellectual courage for a man to frankly recognize that he’s nothing more than a human tatter, an abortion that survived, a madman not mad enough to be committed; and once he recognizes this, it takes even more moral courage to devise a way of adapting to his destiny, to accept without protest and without resignation, without any gesture or hint of a gesture, the organic curse imposed on him by Nature. To want not to suffer from this is to want too much, for it’s beyond human capacity to accept what’s obviously bad as if it were something good; and if we accept it as the bad thing it is, then we can’t help but suffer. To conceive of myself from the outside was my ruin – the ruin of my happiness. I saw myself as others see me, and I despised myself – not because I had character traits that made me worthy of contempt, but because I saw myself through the eyes of others, and felt the contempt they feel towards me. I experienced the humiliation of knowing myself. Since there’s nothing noble about this calvary, and no resurrection three days later, I couldn’t help but suffer from its disgrace. I realized that nobody could love me unless he were completely lacking in aesthetic sensibility, in which case I would then despise him; and even a fond feeling towards me couldn’t be any more than a whim of someone’s basic indifference. To see clearly into ourselves and into how others see us! To stare into the face of that truth! And in the end the cry of Christ on Calvary, when he stared into the face of his truth: ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ THE MAJOR There’s nothing that so intimately reveals and so perfectly conveys the substance of my innate misfortune as the type of daydream I most cherish, the personal balsam I most often choose to allay the anxiety I feel for existing. The essence of what I desire is simply this: to sleep away life. I love life too much to want it to be over; I love not living too much to have an active craving for life. That’s why, of all my dreams, the one I’m about to write down is my favourite. Sometimes at night, when the house is still because the landlords have gone out or fallen silent, I close my window and its heavy shutters; wearing an old suit, I sink down in my easy chair, and I slide into this dream in which I’m a retired major in a small-town hotel, hanging on after dinner in the company of several other guests who are more sober than I – the lingering major, sitting there for no reason. I imagine myself born that way. I’m not interested in the boyhood of the retired major, nor in the military ranks through which he ascended to arrive at the place I yearn for. Independent of Time and of Life, the major I imagine myself to be doesn’t have any kind of past life, nor does he or did he ever have relatives; he exists externally in the life he lives at the small-town hotel, already weary of the jokes and the talk of the other guests who linger there with him. MAXIMS § To have sure and definite opinions, instincts, passions, and a dependable, recognizable character – all of this leads to the horror of transforming our soul into a fact, into a material and external thing. To live in a sweet, fluid state of ignorance about things and about oneself is the only lifestyle that suits a wise man and makes him warm. § To be adept at constantly standing between ourselves and external things is the highest degree of wisdom and prudence. §Our personality should be inscrutable, even to ourselves. That’s why we should always dream, making sure that we’re included in our dreams so that we won’t be able to have opinions about ourselves. And we should especially protect our personality against being invaded by others. All outside interest in us is a flagrant disrespect. What saves the banal greeting ‘How are you?’ from being an inexcusable vulgarity is the fact that it’s usually completely empty and insincere. §To love is to tire of being alone; it is therefore a cowardice, a betrayal of ourselves. (It’s exceedingly important that we not love.) §To give good advice is to disdain the faculty of erring that God gave to others. Not only that, we should be glad that other people don’t act like us. It makes sense only to ask for advice from others, so that we can be sure – by doing just the opposite – that we are totally ourselves, in complete disagreement with all Otherness. §The only advantage of studying is to take delight in all the things that other people haven’t said. § Art is an isolation. Every artist should seek to isolate others, to fill their souls with a desire to be alone. The supreme triumph for the artist who writes is when his readers, on reading his works, prefer just to have them and not read them. This doesn’t necessarily happen to celebrated writers, but it is the greatest tribute..... §To be lucid is to be out of sorts with oneself. The right state of mind for looking inside ourselves is that of someone looking at nerves and indecisions. §The only intellectual attitude worthy of a superior creature is that of a calm and cold compassion for everything that isn’t himself. Not that this attitude has a grain of legitimacy or truth, but it’s so enviable that he must adopt it. MILKY WAY …with twisting phrases that have a poisonous spirituality… …rituals clothed in tattered purples, mysterious ceremonial rites from the time of no one*… …sequestered sensations felt in a body that is not our physical body and yet is physical in its own way, with subtleties that fall between the complex and the simple… …lakes where a pellucid hint of muted gold hovers, hazily divested of ever having been materialized, and no doubt through tortuous refinements, a lily in sheer white hands… …pacts between torpor and anguish – dull green-black and looking terribly weary between their sentries of tedium… …nacre of useless consequences, alabaster of many macerations – the welcome distraction of violet gold sunsets with fringes, but no boats leading to better shores, nor bridges to better twilights… …nor even to the edge of the idea of pools, lots of pools, in the distance amid poplar trees or perhaps cypresses, depending on the syllables employed by the wistful moment to utter their name… …hence windows opening on to wharfs, a continual pounding of waves against docks, a mad and enraptured retinue like a confusion of opals in which amaranths and terebinths write with lucid insomnias on the dark stone walls of being able to hear… …strands of fine silver, ties made from the thread of unravelled robes, futile feelings beneath linden trees, ancient couples on quiet paths lined by hedges, sudden fans, vague gestures, and no doubt better gardens awaiting the placid weariness of nothing but paths and promenades… …bowers, trees in quincunxes, artificial grottoes, sculpted flower beds, fountains, all the art that survives from the dead masters whose dissatisfaction duelled with the visible, and they authored whole processions of things made for dreams along the narrow streets of the ancient villages of sensations… …melodies that resound against the marble of distant palaces, reminiscences that place their hands on ours, sunsets in fateful skies like fortuitous glances of uncertainty, giving way to starlit nights over silently decaying empires… _____ To reduce sensation to a science, to make psychological analysis into a microscopically precise method – that’s the goal that occupies, like a steady thirst, the hub of my life’s will. It’s between my sensations and my consciousness of them that all of my life’s great tragedies occur. It’s there in that murky, indefinite region of nothing but woods and every kind of water sound, where not even the commotion of our wars is felt, that my true being – which I try in vain to see clearly – takes place. I lay down my life. (My sensations are a long-drawn-out epitaph* on top of my dead life.) I subsist in death and dusk. The most I can sculpt is my tomb of inner beauty. The gates of my seclusion open on to parks of infinity, but no one passes through them, not even in my dreams – and yet they are open eternally on to the useless, they are eternally of iron opening on to the unreal… I pluck the petals of private glories in the gardens of my inner splendours, and between dreamed hedges my feet loudly tread the paths that lead to the Confused. I’ve pitched my Empires in the Confused, at the edge of silences, in the tawny war that will do away with the Exact. _____ The man of science realizes that the only reality for him is his own self, and that the only real world is the world as his sensations give it to him. That’s why, instead of following the fallacious path of adapting his sensations to other people’s, he uses objective science to try to achieve a perfect knowledge of his world and his personality. There’s nothing more objective than his dreams, and nothing more infallibly his than his self-awareness. Around these two realities he refines his science. It’s very different from the one practised by the old scientists, who, rather than studying the laws of their own personality and the organization of their dreams, sought the laws of the ‘outside’ and the organization of what they called ‘Nature’. ♦ What’s primordial in me are my habit of dreaming and my knack for dreaming. The circumstances of my life, solitary and quiet since my childhood, and perhaps forces that go further back, moulding me to their sinister specifications through the obscure action of heredity, have made my mind an endless stream of daydreams. Everything I am comes down to this, and even what seems farthest in me from the dreamer belongs unequivocally to the soul of one who only dreams, with his soul as elevated as it can be. For the sake of my own pleasure in self-analysis, I would like to express in words, as far as I’m able, the mental processes which in me are really just one process – that of a life devoted to dreaming, of a soul that knows only how to dream. Seeing myself from the outside (as I almost always do), I’m unfit for action, flustered when I have to take a step or make a move, tongue-tied when I have to talk to someone, lacking the inner lucidity needed to enjoy things that require mental effort, and without the physical stamina to entertain myself through some merely mechanical labour. It’s only natural that I’m this way. A dreamer is expected to be this way. All reality disconcerts me. Other people’s speech throws me into a state of great anguish. The reality of other souls always astounds me. The vast network of unconscious behaviours responsible for all the action I see strikes me as an absurd illusion, without any plausible coherence, nothing. But should someone imagine that I’m ignorant of the workings of other people’s psychology, that I’m not clearly aware of their motives and private thoughts, then he’ll be quite mistaken about what I am. For I’m not just a dreamer, I’m exclusively a dreamer. My sole habit – to dream – has endowed me with an extraordinarily keen inner eyesight. I not only see the figures and stage sets of my dreams with astounding and startling clarity, I see just as clearly my abstract ideas, my human feelings (what’s left of them), my secret urges and my psychological attitudes towards myself. I even see, inside myself, my own abstract ideas; I see them in an internal space, with my veritable inner eyesight. And thus their meanders are visible to me in every detail. I therefore know myself completely and, knowing myself completely, I know all of humanity completely. There is no base impulse or noble intention that hasn’t been a flash in my soul, and I know the tell-tale gestures of each one. Beneath the masks of goodness or indifference that wicked thoughts wear, even within us, I recognize them for what they are by their gestures. I know what strives, inside us, to delude us. And thus I know most people better than they know themselves. I often probe them at some length, for in that way I make them mine. I conquer every psyche I fathom, because for me to dream is to possess. And so it’s only natural that I, dreamer that I am, should be the analyst I profess to be. That’s why plays count among the few things I occasionally enjoy reading. Plays are performed in me every day, and I know exactly how souls are laid out flat, in a Mercator projection. But this doesn’t really amuse me much, because playwrights are always making the same trite and glaring errors. No play ever satisfied me. Knowing human psychology with a lightning precision that probes every cranny with a single glance, I find the crude analysis and construction of playwrights offensive, and the little that I read in this genre annoys me like a blot of ink on a handwritten page. Things are the raw material of my dreams; that’s why I apply a distractedly hyperattentive attention to certain details of the Outside. To give contours and relief to my dreams, I have to understand how life’s characters and reality’s landscapes appear to us with contours and relief. Because the dreamer’s eyesight is not like the eyesight we use to see actual things. In dreams we do not, as in reality, focus equally on the important and unimportant aspects of an object. The dreamer sees only what’s important. An object’s true reality is only a portion of what it is; the rest is the heavy tribute it pays to physical matter for the right to exist in space. In like manner, certain phenomena that are palpably real in dreams have no reality in space. A real sunset is imponderable and transitory. A dreamed sunset is fixed and eternal. Those who can write are those who know how to see their dreams with sharp clarity (and do so) and to see life as they see dreams, to see life immaterially, taking pictures of it with reverie’s camera, which is insensible to the rays of what’s heavy, useful and circumscribed, such things yielding nothing but a black blur on the photographic plate of the soul. This attitude, engrafted into me from so much dreaming, makes me always see the dream side of reality. My eyesight suppresses those aspects of an object that my dreams can’t use. And so I always live in dreams, even when I live in life. To look at a sunset inside me or at a sunset on the Outside is all the same to me, for I see them in the same way, my eyesight registering the same thing in both cases. It will therefore seem to many that I have a distorted view of myself. In a certain way it is distorted. But I dream myself and choose those parts of me that are dreamable, constructing and reconstructing myself in every way possible until what I am and what I am not conform to my ideal. Sometimes the best way to see an object is to delete it, because it subsists in a way I can’t quite explain, consisting of the substance of its negation and deletion; this is what I do with vast areas of my real-life being, which, after they’re deleted from my picture of myself, transfigure my true being, the one that’s real for me. How do I keep from deceiving myself in these processes of illusion applied to my own person? Well, the process that thrusts a certain aspect of the world or the figure of a dream into a more-than-real reality also thrusts emotions and thoughts into the more-than-real sphere, stripping them of all the false trappings (and only rarely are they not false) of nobility and purity. It should be noted that my objectivity couldn’t be more absolute, for I create each object absolute, with absolute qualities in its concrete form. I haven’t really fled from life, in the sense of seeking a softer bed for my soul; I’ve merely changed lives, finding in my dreams the same objectivity that I found in life. My dreams – I discuss this in another passage – take shape independently of my will, and they frequently shock and offend me. The things I discover in myself very often make me feel dismayed, ashamed (perhaps due to some vestige of humanity in me – what is shame?), and alarmed. In me ceaseless daydreaming has replaced attention. Over everything I see, including things seen in dreams, I’ve taken to superimposing other dreams I have inside me. I’m already sufficiently inattentive to be adept at what I’ve dubbed ‘the dream view’ of things. Even so, since this inattentiveness was motivated by a perpetual daydreaming and by a preoccupation (likewise not overly attentive) with the course of my dreams, I superimpose what I dream on the dreams I see in the real world around me, intersecting reality already stripped of its physical matter with an absolute immateriality. This explains the ability I’ve acquired to focus on various ideas at the same time, to observe certain things while at the same time dreaming other, very different things, to dream simultaneously of a real sunset over the real Tagus River and a dreamed morning on an inner Pacific Ocean; and the two dreamed things crisscross without blending, without anything getting mixed up besides the different emotional states induced by each. It’s as if I saw a number of people walking down a street and felt all their souls inside me (which could occur only in a unity of feeling) at the same time that I saw their various bodies (these I could see only separately) crossing paths on the street full of legs in motion. MILLIMETRES (the sensation of slight things) The present is ancient, because everything from the past was in the present when it existed, and so I have an antique dealer’s fondness for things precisely because they belong to the present, and I have the wrath of an outrivalled collector for anyone who tries to replace my mistaken notions about things with plausible and even provable, scientifically based arguments. The various points that a butterfly successively occupies in space are various things which, to my astonished eyes, remain visible in space. My recollections are so intense that..... But it is only the subtlest sensations of the slightest things that I live intensely. Perhaps this is due to my love of futility. Or maybe it’s because of my concern for detail. But I’m inclined to believe – I can’t say I know, for these are things I never bother to analyse – that it’s because slight things, having absolutely no social or practical importance, are for that very reason absolutely free of sordid associations with reality. Slight things smack to me of unreality. The useless is beautiful because it’s less real than the useful, which continues and extends, whereas the marvellously futile and the gloriously minuscule stay where and as they are, living freely and independently. The useless and the futile open up humbly aesthetic interludes in our real lives. What dreams and fond delights are stirred in my soul by the puny existence of a pin in a ribbon! What a pity for those who don’t realize how important this is! Among the sensations that inwardly torture us to the point of becoming pleasurable, the disquiet provoked by the world’s mystery is one of the most common and complex. And that mystery is never more evident than when we contemplate tiny things, which don’t move and are therefore perfectly translucent, allowing their mystery to show through. It’s harder to feel mystery when contemplating a battle (and yet to meditate on the absurdity of there being people and societies and conflicts between them is what can most unfurl in our minds the flag of triumph over mystery) than when contemplating a small stone on the road which, since it brings to mind no idea beyond that of its existence, will naturally and necessarily lead us – if we keep thinking about it – to consider the mystery of its existence. Blessed be instants and millimetres and the shadows of tiny things, which are even more humble than the things themselves! Instants..... Millimetres – how astonished I am by their audacity to exist side by side and so close together on a tape measure. Sometimes these things make me suffer or rejoice, and then I feel a kind of gut pride. I’m an ultrasensitive photographic plate. All details are engraved in me out of all proportion to any possible whole. The plate fills up with nothing but me. The outer world that I see is pure sensation. I never forget that I feel. OUR LADY OF SILENCE Sometimes, when I feel discouraged and depressed, even my ability to dream loses its leaves and shrivels, and the only kind of dreaming I can have is to muse on my dreams, and so I leaf through them, like a book one leafs through over and over, finding nothing but inevitable words. And then I ask myself who you are, you this figure who traverses all my languid visions of unknown landscapes and ancient interiors and splendid pageants of silence. In all of my dreams you appear, in dream form, or you accompany me as a false reality. With you I visit regions that are perhaps dreams of yours, lands that are perhaps your bodies of absence and inhumanity, your essential body dissolved into the shape of a tranquil plain and a stark hill on the grounds of some secret place. Perhaps I have no dream but you. Perhaps it is in your eyes, when my face leans into yours, that I read these impossible landscapes, these unreal tediums, these feelings that inhabit the shadows of my weariness and the caves of my disquiet. Perhaps the landscapes of my dreams are my way of not dreaming about you. I don’t know who you are, but do I know for certain who I am? Do I really know what it means to dream , such that I can know what it means to call you my dream? How do I know that you’re not a part of me, perhaps the real and essential part? And how do I know it’s not I who am the dream and you the reality, I who am your dream instead of you being mine?"

"Escrevo, triste, no meu quarto quieto, sozinho como sempre tenho sido, sozinho como sempre serei. E penso se a minha voz, aparentemente tão pouca coisa, não encarna a substância de milhares de vozes, a fome de dizerem-se de milhares de vidas, a paciência de milhões de almas submissas como a minha ao destino quotidiano, ao sonho inútil, à esperança sem vestígios. Nestes momentos meu coração pulsa mais alto por minha consciência dele. Vivo mais porque vivo maior. Sinto na minha pessoa uma força religiosa, uma espécie de oração, uma semelhança de clamor. Mas a reacção contra mim desce-me da inteligência... Vejo-me no quarto andar alto da Rua dos Douradores, assisto-me com sono; olho, sobre o papel meio escrito, a vida vã sem beleza e o cigarro barato que a expender estendo sobre o mata-borrão velho2. Aqui eu, neste quarto andar, a interpelar a vida!, a dizer o que as almas sentem!, a fazer prosa como os génios e os célebres! Aqui, eu, assim!...","I write sadly in my quiet room, alone as I have always been, alone as I will always be. And I wonder if my voice, apparently so little, doesn't embody the substance of thousands of voices, the hunger to speak of thousands of lives, the patience of millions of souls submissive like mine to the daily destiny, to the useless dream, to hope without a trace. In these moments my heart beats louder through my awareness of him. I live longer because I live longer. I feel in my person a religious force, a kind of prayer, a semblance of a cry. But the reaction against me descends from my intelligence... I see myself on the fourth floor of Rua dos Douradores, I watch myself sleepily; I look over the half-written paper at the vain life without beauty and the cheap cigarette I spend it, I spread it out on the old blotter. Here I am, on this fourth floor, questioning life!, saying what souls feel!, writing prose like geniuses and famous people! Here, I, like this!...","And yet I walk , I move on, I drift. Nothing in my movements (I know this because no one else seems to notice) betrays my stagnant state. And this lack of soul which would be comfortable, even correct, in someone lying down or recumbent, is singularly uncomfortable, even painful, in a man walking down a street. It’s like being drunk on inertia, a drinking spree as utterly joyless in itself as in its cause. It’s an illness from which there is no hope of recovery. It is a cheerful death. 186 [1929?] Sometimes when I raise my heavy head from the books in which I keep track of other people’s accounts and of the absence of a life of my own, I feel a physical nausea. It may come from sitting so bent over but it goes beyond a mere question of numbers and disillusion. Life sickens me like a dose of bad medicine. And it’s then, with immense clarity of vision, that I see how easy it would be to remove myself from this tedium if I just had the strength truly to want to do so. We live through action, that is, through the will. Those of us — be we geniuses or beggars — who do not know how to want are brothers in our shared impotence. What’s the point of calling myself a genius when in fact I’m just an assistant bookkeeper? When Cesário Verde had himself announced to the doctor not as Senhor Verde, commercial clerk, but Cesário Verde, poet, he was using one of those expressions of futile pride that stink of vanity. Poor man, he was never anything but Senhor Verde, commercial clerk. The poet was born only after he died, because it was only after his death that his poetry came to be appreciated. To act, that is true intelligence. I will be what I want to be. But I have to want whatever that is.","Sadly I write in my quiet room, alone as I have always been, alone as I will always be. And I wonder if my apparently negligible voice might not embody the essence of thousands of voices, the longing for self-expression of thousands of lives, the patience of millions of souls resigned like my own to their daily lot, their useless dreams, and their hopeless hopes. In these moments my heart beats faster because I’m conscious of it. I live more because I live on high. I feel a religious force within me, a species of prayer, a kind of public outcry. But my mind quickly puts me in my place… I remember that I’m on the fourth floor of the Rua dos Douradores, and I take a drowsy look at myself. I glance up from this half-written page at life, futile and without beauty, and at the cheap cigarette I’m about to extinguish in the ashtray beyond the fraying blotter. Me in this fourth-floor room, interrogating life!, saying what souls feel! , writing prose like a genius or a famous author! Me, here, a genius!…"

O homem de acção considera o mundo externo como composto exclusivamente de matéria inerte — ou inerte em si mesma, como uma pedra sobre que passa ou que afasta do caminho; ou inerte como um ente humano que, porque não lhe pôde resistir, tanto faz que fosse homem como pedra, pois, como à pedra, ou se afastou ou se passou por cima.","In order to act, therefore, it is necessary that we do not easily figure out the personalities of others, their pains and joys. Whoever sympathizes stops. The man of action regards the external world as composed exclusively of inert matter—or inert in itself, like a stone over which he passes or which he pushes out of the way; or inert like a human being that, because it could not resist it, makes no difference that it was man like stone, because, like stone, it either moved away or passed over.","But it seems that for me, or for people who feel as I do, the artificial has come to seem natural and the natural strange. No, that’s not quite it : the artificial has not become natural; the natural has simply become different.","To act, then, requires a certain incapacity for imagining the personalities of others, their joys and sufferings. Sympathy leads to paralysis. The man of action regards the external world as composed exclusively of inert matter – either intrinsically inert, like a stone he walks on or kicks out of his path, or inert like a human being who couldn’t resist him and thus might as well be a stone as a man since, like a stone, he was walked on or kicked out of the way."
"Pensar, sentir, querer, tornam-se uma só confusa coisa. As crenças, as sensações, as coisas imaginadas e as actuais estão desarrumadas, são como o conteúdo misturado no chão, de várias gavetas subvertidas2.","Thinking, feeling, wanting become one confused thing. Beliefs, sensations, imagined and actual things are in disarray, they are like the contents mixed up on the floor, from several subverted drawers2.","There is a touch of autumn in all one’s emotions and thoughts, or rather one feels like one of those early spring days when the air and sky seem more like autumn than spring, except, of course, that no leaves fall.","Thinking, feeling and wanting become a single confused thing. Beliefs, sensations, imagined things and real things get all mixed up, like the contents of various drawers overturned on to the floor."

"Quem éramos? Seríamos dois ou duas formas de um? Não o sabíamos nem o perguntávamos. Um sol vago devia existir, pois na floresta não era noite. Um fim vago devia existir, pois caminhávamos. Um mundo qualquer devia existir, pois existia uma floresta. Nós, porém, éramos alheios ao que fosse ou pudesse ser, caminheiros uníssonos e intermináveis sobre folhas mortas, ouvidores anónimos e impossíveis de folhas caindo. Nada mais. Um sussurro, ora brusco ora suave, do vento incógnito, um murmúrio, ora alto ora baixo, das folhas presas, um resquício, uma dúvida, um propósito que findara, uma ilusão que nem fora — a floresta, os dois caminheiros, e eu, eu, que não sei qual deles era, ou se era ou dois, ou nenhum, e assisti, sem ver o fim, à tragédia de não haver nunca mais do que o outono e a floresta, e o vento sempre brusco e incerto, e as folhas sempre caídas ou caindo. E sempre, como se por certo houvesse fora um sol e um dia, via-se claramente, para fim nenhum, no silêncio rumoroso da floresta.","Who were we? Are we two or two forms of one? We didn't know or ask. There must have been a vague sun, for in the forest it was not night. A vague end must have existed, for we were walking. Any world must exist, because there was a forest. We, however, were oblivious to what was or could be, unison and endless walkers on dead leaves, anonymous and impossible listeners of falling leaves. Just it. A whisper, sometimes brusque, sometimes soft, of the incognito wind, a murmur, sometimes high and sometimes low, of the trapped leaves, a remnant, a doubt, a purpose that had ended, an illusion that wasn't even - the forest, the two walkers, and me , I, who don't know which one it was, or whether it was or two, or neither, and watched, without seeing the end, the tragedy of never being more than autumn and the forest, and the wind always sudden and uncertain, and the leaves always fallen or falling. And always, as if surely there were a sun and a day outside, he saw himself clearly, for no purpose, in the noisy silence of the forest.","Who were we? Were we two or two forms of the same person? We did not know nor did we ask. There must have been some kind of sun somewhere, because in the forest it wasn’t yet dark night. We must have had some kind of goal too, because we kept walking. A world of some sort must have existed, because the forest existed. We, though, were indifferent to what was or might be , interminable travelers crunching in unison over the dead leaves, anonymous, impossible hearers of falling leaves. Nothing more. A whisper, now shrill, now soft, from that mysterious wind, a murmur, now loud, now quiet, from the trapped leaves, a gap, a doubt, a failed attempt, an illusion that never was — the forest, the two travelers, and me, and I don’t know which of them I was, if I was both or neither, and I witnessed, without waiting to see how it ended , the tragedy of nothing ever having been more than the autumn and the forest, and the still-brusque and hesitant wind, and the leaves always fallen or falling. And always, as if there really were a sun and a day out there, I could clearly see, although to no purpose, the murmurous silence of the forest.","Who were we? Were we two, or two forms of one? We didn’t know and we didn’t ask. A hazy sun presumably existed, for it wasn’t night in the forest. A vague aim presumably existed, for we were walking. Some world or other presumably existed, since a forest existed. But what it was or might be was foreign to us, two perpetual walkers treading in unison over dead leaves, anonymous and impossible listeners to falling leaves. Nothing else. A now harsh now gentle murmur of the inscrutable wind, a now loud now soft rustle of the unfallen leaves, a vestige, a doubt, a goal that had perished, an illusion that never was – the forest, the two walkers, and I, I, unsure of which one I was, or if I was both, or neither, and without seeing it to the end I watched the tragedy of nothing ever having existed but the autumn and the forest, the always rough and unsteady wind, and the always fallen or falling leaves. And always, as if surely there were a sun and day out there, one could see clearly – to nowhere – in the clamorous silence of the forest."

"Amo, pelas tardes demoradas de verão, o sossego da cidade baixa, e sobretudo aquele sossego que o contraste acentua na parte que o dia mergulha em mais bulício. A Rua do Arsenal, a Rua da Alfândega, o prolongamento das ruas tristes que se alastram para leste desde que a da Alfândega cessa, toda a linha separada dos cais quedos — tudo isso me conforta de tristeza, se me insiro, por essas tardes, na solidão do seu conjunto. Vivo uma era anterior àquela em que vivo; gozo de sentir-me coevo de Cesário Verde, e tenho em mim, não outros versos como os dele, mas a substância igual à dos versos que foram dele. Por ali arrasto, até haver noite, uma sensação de vida parecida com a dessas ruas. De dia elas são cheias de um bulício que não quer dizer nada; de noite são cheias de uma falta de bulício que não quer dizer nada. Eu de dia sou nulo, e de noite sou eu. Não há diferença entre mim e as ruas para o lado da Alfândega, salvo elas serem ruas e eu ser alma, o que pode ser que nada valha, ante o que é a essência das coisas. Há um destino igual, porque é abstracto, para os homens e para as coisas — uma designação igualmente indiferente na álgebra do mistério.","I love, for long summer afternoons, the quiet of the lower city, and above all that quiet that the contrast accentuates in the part where the day plunges into more hustle. Rua do Arsenal, Rua da Alfândega, the extension of the sad streets that spread to the east since that of Alfândega ceases, the entire line separated from the quiet quays — all this comforts me with sadness, if I insert myself, on these afternoons, in the solitude of the whole. I live in an age before the one in which I live; I enjoy feeling myself coeval with Cesário Verde, and I have in me not other verses like his, but the substance equal to the verses that were his. Through there I drag, until there is night, a sensation of life similar to that of these streets. By day they are full of a hustle that means nothing; at night they are full of a lack of hustle that means nothing. I am null by day, and by night I am. There is no difference between me and the streets on the Customs side, except that they are streets and I am a soul, which may be worthless, given the essence of things. There is an equal destiny, because it is abstract, for men and for things - an equally indifferent designation in the algebra of mystery.","On these lingering summer evenings, I love the quiet of this, the commercial part of town, all the more because it’s such a contrast with the noisy bustle that fills it during the day. Rua do Arsenal, Rua da Alfândega — the sad roads that reach out to the east where the Alfândega ends — and the long, solitary line of quiet quays: they comfort me with sadness on those evenings when I choose to share their solitude. I’m transported back to a time long before the one in which I actually live. I like to imagine myself a contemporary of Cesário Verdeii and feel within myself, not more verses like the ones he wrote, but the substance of his verses. The life I drag around with me until night falls is not dissimilar to that of the streets themselves. By day, they’re full of meaningless bustle and, by night, full of an equally meaningless lack of bustle. By day, I am nothing, by night, I am myself. There’s no difference between me and the streets around the Alfândega, except that they are streets and I am a human soul, and this, when weighed against the essence of all things, might also count for little. Men and objects share a common abstract destiny: to be of equally insignificant value in the algebra of life’s mystery.","I love the stillness of early summer evenings downtown, and especially the stillness made more still by contrast, on the streets that seethe with activity by day. Rua do Arsenal, Rua da Alfândega, the sad streets extending eastward from where the Rua da Alfândega ends, the entire stretch along the quiet docks – all of this comforts me with sadness when on these evenings I enter the solitude of their ensemble. I slip into an era prior to the one I’m living in; I enjoy feeling that I’m a contemporary of Cesário Verde, * and that in me I have, not verses like his, but the identical substance of the verses that were his. Walking on these streets, until the night falls, my life feels to me like the life they have. By day they’re full of meaningless activity; by night they’re full of a meaningless lack of it. By day I am nothing, and by night I am I. There is no difference between me and these streets, save they being streets and I a soul, which perhaps is irrelevant when we consider the essence of things. There is an equal, abstract destiny for men and for things; both have an equally indifferent designation in the algebra of the world’s mystery."

Mas todo o mal entra [em] casa pela janela da observação e pela porta do pensamento.","So that everything that distresses me I see. And everything that makes me happy, I don't feel.

Because not thinking, not seeing, a certain contentment is acquired, like that of mystics and bohemians and scoundrels. But all evil enters [into] the house through the window of observation and through the door of thought.","How often, weighed down by a tedium that verges on madness, or an anguish that seems to go beyond all anguish, do I stop and hesitate before I rebel, do I hesitate and stop before making myself a god.","And so I see all the things which cause anguish and feel none of the things which bring joy. And I’ve noticed that suffering is seen more than felt, whereas happiness is felt more than seen.

It’s by the door of thought and the window of observation that suffering comes into one’s house."

"Amo alguns poetas líricos porque não foram poetas épicos ou dramáticos, porque tiveram a justa intuição de nunca querer mais realização do que a de um momento de sentimento ou de sonho. O que se pode escrever inconscientemente — tanto mede o possível perfeito. Nenhum drama de Shakespeare satisfaz como uma lírica de Heine. É perfeita a lírica de Heine, e todo o drama — de um Shakespeare ou de outro, é imperfeito sempre. Poder construir, erguer um Todo, compor uma coisa que seja como um corpo humano, com perfeita correspondência nas suas partes, e com uma vida, uma vida de unidade e congruência, unificando a dispersão de feitios das suas1 partes!","I love some lyric poets because they were not epic or dramatic poets, because they had the right intuition of never wanting more fulfillment than a moment of feeling or dream. What can be written unconsciously — so much measures the perfect possible. No drama by Shakespeare satisfies like a lyric by Heine. Heine's lyric is perfect, and the whole drama - of one Shakespeare or another, is always imperfect. To be able to build, to erect a Whole, to compose a thing that is like a human body, with perfect correspondence in its parts, and with a life, a life of unity and congruence, unifying the dispersion of shapes of its parts!","and I feel physically sickened by the voices and gestures of my so-called fellow man. That genuine nausea, felt in my stomach and in my head, is the foolish wonderment of an alert sensibility … Each individual who speaks to me, each face whose eyes meet mine, has the same impact on me as a direct insult or foul language. I overflow with a horror of everything. I grow dizzy feeling myself feel that. And almost always, when I feel sick to my stomach like that, a man, or a woman, or even a child, rises before me like a representative of the very banality that afflicts me.","I love certain lyric poets precisely because they weren’t epic or dramatic poets, because they had the intuitive wisdom never to want to express more than an intensely felt or dreamed moment. What can be written unconsciously is the exact measure of the perfection that is possible. No Shakespearian drama satisfies like a lyric poem of Heine. The poetry of Heine is perfect, whereas all drama – of Shakespeare or anyone else – is inevitably imperfect. Ah, to be able to construct a complete Whole, to compose something that would be like a human body, with perfect harmony among all its parts, and with a life, a life of unity and congruency, uniting the scattered traits of its various parts! *"

Life can be lived to the extreme by the extreme possession of it, by the ulysseia journey through all experienced sensations, through all forms of externalized energy. Rare, however, in all ages of the world, are those who can close their eyes full of tiredness, the sum of all tiredness, those who have possessed everything in every way.","I owe these books a discipline I thought almost impossible in me, namely, that one must always write objectively and rationally. Father Figueiredo’s affected, monastic, fusty style is a discipline that delights my understanding.

Choro de tudo, entre perda do regaço, a morte da mão que me davam, os braços que não soube como me cingissem, o ombro que nunca poderia ter… E o dia que raia definitivamente, a mágoa que raia em mim como a verdade crua do dia, o que sonhei, o que pensei, o que se esqueceu em mim — tudo isso, numa amálgama de sombras, de ficções e de remorsos, se mistura no rastro em que vão os mundos e cai entre as coisas da vida como o esqueleto de um cacho de uvas, comido à esquina pelos garotos que o roubaram.","Ah, and again, like the renewed protest of those who have not been convinced, I hear the sudden noise of the rain splashing in the illuminated universe. I feel cold to my supposed bones, as if I'm afraid. And crouching, null, human alone with me in the little darkness I still have, I cry. Yes, I cry, I cry from loneliness and life, and my futile grief like a car without wheels lies on the edge of reality among the dung of abandonment. I cry for everything, between the loss of my lap, the death of the hand they gave me, the arms that I didn't know how to wrap around me, the shoulder that I could never have... of the day, what I dreamed, what I thought, what was forgotten in me - all this, in an amalgamation of shadows, fictions and regrets, blends in the trail in which the worlds go and falls among the things of life like the skeleton of a bunch of grapes, eaten on the corner by the boys who stole it.","Only then did I notice that there was something else in the street apart from the street lamps: a diffuse moonlight, hidden and silent, full of nothing, like life …","And again I hear, like the renewed protest of one who still isn’t convinced, the abrupt clamour of rain spattering the lit-up universe. I feel a chill in my imagined bones, as if I were afraid. And cowering in my insignificance, so human and alone in the last vestige of the darkness that’s deserting me, I begin to weep. I weep, yes, over solitude and life, and my useless grief lies like a wheelless cart on the edge of reality, amid the dung of oblivion. I weep over everything – the loss of the lap where I once lay, the death of the hand I was given, the arms to embrace me that I never found, the shoulder to lean on that I never had. And the day that breaks definitively, the grief that breaks in me like the naked truth of day, all that I dreamed or thought or forgot – all of this, like an amalgam of shadows, fictions and regrets, blends into the wake of the passing worlds and falls among the things of life like the skeleton of a bunch of grapes, filched by young boys and eaten on the street corner."
"Quanto mais avançamos na vida, mais nos convencemos de duas verdades que todavia se contradizem. A primeira é de que, perante a realidade da vida, soam pálidas todas as ficções da literatura e da arte. Dão, é certo, um prazer mais nobre que os da vida; porém são como os sonhos, em que sentimos sentimentos que na vida se não sentem, e se conjugam formas que na vida se não encontram; são contudo sonhos, de que se acorda, que não constituem memórias nem saudades, com que vivamos depois uma segunda vida.","The more we advance in life, the more we are convinced of two truths that still contradict each other. The first is that, faced with the reality of life, all the fictions of literature and art are pale. They give, it is true, a nobler pleasure than those of life; but they are like dreams, in which we feel feelings that are not felt in life, and forms that are not found in life are combined; they are, however, dreams that one wakes up from, which are neither memories nor nostalgia, with which we later live a second life.","They’re just meaningless sentences, flowing languidly with the fluidity of water that forgets itself as a stream does in the waves that mingle and fade, constantly reborn, following endlessly one on the other. That’s how ideas and images, tremulous with expression, pass through me like a rustling procession of faded silks amongst which a sliver of an idea flickers, mottled and indistinct in the moonlight. Though I weep for nothing that life might bring or take away from me, certain pages of prose can reduce me to tears.","The more we live, the more convinced we become of two truths that contradict each other. The first is that next to the reality of life all the fictions of literature and art pale. It’s true that they give us a nobler pleasure than what we get from life, but they’re like dreams which, though offering us feelings not felt in life and joining together forms that never meet in life, are none the less dreams that dissipate when we wake up, leaving no memories or nostalgia with which we could later live a second life."
"Afinal, isto bem me contentaria se eu conseguisse persuadir-me que esta teoria não é o que é, um complexo barulho que faço aos ouvidos da minha inteligência, quase para ela não perceber que, no fundo, não há senão a minha timidez, a minha incompetência para a vida.","After all, I would be happy if I could convince myself that this theory is not what it is, a complex noise that I make in the ears of my intelligence, almost so that it doesn't understand that, deep down, there is nothing but my shyness, the my incompetence for life.",It evokes sentimental landscapes out of a mere sketch in our subconscious minds.,"No doubt this theory would satisfy me, if I could convince myself that it’s not what it is: a complicated jabber to fill the ears of my intelligence, to make it almost forget that at heart I’m just timid, with no aptitude for life."
"Deliciosa psicologia das coisas deveras estáticas! A eternidade tece-a e o gesto que uma figura pintada tem desdenha, do alto da sua eternidade visível, a nossa transitória febre, que nunca se demora nas janelas de uma atitude nem se atarda1 nos portões de um esgar2.","Delicious psychology of really static things! Eternity weaves it, and the gesture that a painted figure has disdains, from the height of its visible eternity, our transitory fever, which never lingers at the windows of an attitude or lingers1 at the gates of a grimace2.","Everything I see is, for me, the purely visible, be it the vast blue, green-tinged sky of the coming morning, be it the false grimace of pain on the face of someone watching the death of a loved one and aware that he is being watched.","Exquisite psychology of truly static things, a psychology woven by eternity! And the expression of a painted figure, from the summit of its visible eternity, disdains our transitory fever, which never lingers at the windows of an attitude* nor pauses at the gates of a gesture."

"A acção é uma doença do pensamento, um cancro da imaginação. Agir é exilar-se. Toda a acção é incompleta e imperfeita. O poema que eu sonho não tem falhas senão quando tento realizá-lo. No mito de Jesus está escrito isto; Deus, ao tornar-se homem, não pode acabar senão pelo martírio. O supremo sonhador tem por filho o martírio supremo.","Action is a disease of thought, a cancer of the imagination. To act is to exile. All action is incomplete and imperfect.

The supreme dreamer has the supreme martyrdom for his son.","… the imaginative episode we call reality. It’s been raining for two days now and the rain that falls from the cold, gray sky is of a color that grieves the soul. Two days … I’m sad from too much feeling and reflect this back onto the window to the sound of water dripping and rain falling. My heart feels heavy and all my memories have turned to anguish. I’m not sleepy, nor is there any reason for me to feel sleepy, but I nevertheless feel a great desire to sleep.","Action is a disease of thought, a cancer of the imagination. Action is self-exile. Every action is incomplete and flawed. The poem I dream has no flaws until I try to realize it. We find this recorded in the myth of Jesus. God, becoming man, cannot help but end in martyrdom. The supreme dreamer has the supreme martyr for a son."

"Ficções do interlúdio, cobrindo coloridamente o marasmo e a desídia1 da nossa íntima descrença.","Fictions of the interlude, colorfully covering the doldrums and slackness1 of our intimate disbelief.","The man of action considers the external world as being made up exclusively of inert matter, either inert in itself, like a stone that one either steps over or kicks to the side of the road, or like a human being who, unable to resist the man of action, might just as well be a stone since he, too, will be stepped over or kicked to one side.","Fictions of the interlude,* colourfully covering the torpor and sloth of our underlying disbelief."

As almas viram-se tais quais eram.","So, in this world of souls, the visible ruin, the obvious disgrace, remained, without the darkness that covered it with its false affection. The souls saw themselves as they were.","An over-curious analysis of sensations — sometimes purely imaginary — the identification of the heart with the landscape, the anatomical laying bare of the nerves, replacing will with desire and thought with aspiration — all these things are too familiar to seem novel in someone else’s words or to bring me peace.","And so our world of souls was left with this visible damage, this glaring affliction, without the darkness to cloak it with its false affection. Souls were seen for what they were."
"Vendo-me de fora, como quase sempre me vejo, eu sou um inapto à acção, perturbado ante ter que dar passos e fazer gestos, inábil para falar com os outros, sem lucidez interior para me entreter com o que me cause esforço ao espírito, nem sequência física para me aplicar a qualquer mero mecanismo de entretenimento trabalhando.","Seeing myself from the outside, as I almost always see myself, I am incapable of action, disturbed by having to take steps and make gestures, incapable of talking to others, without the inner lucidity to entertain myself with what makes my spirit strain. , nor physical sequence to apply to any mere entertainment mechanism at work.",,He was the definitive creator of inner aristocracy – that posture of soul which most resembles the bodily posture of a full-fledged aristocrat.

"Estamos todos habituados a considerar-nos como primordialmente realidades mentais, e aos outros como directamente realidades físicas; vagamente nos consideramos como gente física, para efeitos nos olhos dos outros; vagamente consideramos os outros como realidades mentais, mas só no amor ou no conflito tomamos verdadeira consciência de que os outros têm sobretudo alma, como nós para nós.","We are all used to seeing ourselves as primarily mental realities, and others as directly physical realities; we vaguely regard ourselves as physical people, for the purposes of the eyes of others; we vaguely consider others as mental realities, but only in love or conflict do we truly become aware that others have a soul, as we do for us.","I, however, think with my imagination, and everything in me that should be reason or sorrow or impulse is reduced inside me to something distant and indifferent, like that dead lake set among rocks over which hovers the last lingering ray of sun.","We’re all used to thinking of ourselves as primarily mental realities, and of other people as immediately physical realities.

"Mas a Julieta ideal da realidade melhor fechou sobre o Romeu fictício do meu sangue a janela alta da entrevista literária. Ela obedece ao pai dela; ele obedece ao pai dele.

"Uns governam o mundo, outros são o mundo. Entre um milionário americano, um César ou Napoleão, ou Lenine, e o chefe socialista da aldeia — não há diferença de qualidade mas apenas de quantidade. Abaixo destes estamos nós, os amorfos, o dramaturgo atabalhoado William Shakespeare, o mestre-escola John Milton, o vadio Dante Alighieri, o moço de fretes que me fez ontem o recado, ou o barbeiro que me conta anedotas, o criado que acaba de me fazer a fraternidade de me desejar aquelas melhoras, por eu não ter bebido senão metade do vinho.","Some rule the world, others are the world. Between an American millionaire, a Caesar or Napoleon, or Lenin, and the socialist village chief—there is no difference in quality but only in quantity. Below these are we, the amorphous ones, the clumsy playwright William Shakespeare, the schoolmaster John Milton, the vagrant Dante Alighieri, the freight boy who sent me the message yesterday, or the barber who tells me anecdotes, the servant who has just make me the fraternity of wishing me those improvements, because I only drank half the wine.","The sounds of life were growing louder. At such an hour, it would be best never to arrive at the human reality for which our life is destined. To be left hanging weightlessly between the mist and the morning, hovering above real life, not in one’s spirit, but in one’s spiritualized body, that, more than anything, would satisfy our longing to find a refuge, even if we have no reason to seek such a refuge. Feeling everything very subtly makes us indifferent, except to those things we cannot have — sensations that our soul is still in too embryonic a form to feel, human activities in keeping with deep feelings, with passions and emotions lost among other kinds of achievement. The trees, lined up along the avenues, had nothing to do with all this. That moment came to an abrupt halt, just as the bank on the other side of the river does when the boat touches the quay. Before that, it carried imprinted on its hull the landscape of the other shore, which vanished with the sound of the hull scraping the quayside. The man with his trousers rolled up to his knees caught hold of the rope, and that natural gesture was definitive and conclusive. It brought metaphysical closure to the impossibility of our soul continuing to enjoy the pleasure of a hesitant anxiety. The boys on the quay looked at me as they would look at anyone, at someone who does not experience such inappropriate emotions while watching the practical business of a boat docking.","Some govern the world, others are the world. Between an American millionaire, a Caesar or Napoleon, or Lenin, and the Socialist leader of a small town, there’s a difference in quantity but not of quality. Below them there’s us, the unnoticed: the reckless playwright William Shakespeare, John Milton the schoolteacher, Dante Alighieri the tramp, the delivery boy who ran an errand for me yesterday, the barber who tells me jokes, and the waiter who just now demonstrated his camaraderie by wishing me well, after noticing I’d drunk only half the wine."
"Mais do que outras artes, são a literatura e a música propícias às subtilezas de um psicólogo. As figuras de romance são — como todos sabem — tão reais como qualquer de nós. Certos aspectos de sons têm uma alma alada e rápida, mas susceptíveis de psicologia e sociologia. Porque — bom é que os ignorantes o saibam — as sociedades existem dentro das cores, dos sons, das frases, e há regimes e revoluções, reinados, políticas e ▢ — há-os em absoluto e sem metáfora — no conjunto instrumental das sinfonias, no todo organizado das novelas, nos metros quadrados de um quadro complexo, onde gozam, sofrem, e misturam as atitudes coloridas de guerreiros, de amorosos ou de simbólicos.","More than other arts, literature and music are conducive to the subtleties of a psychologist. Romance figures are—as everyone knows—as real as any of us. Certain aspects of sounds have a winged and fast soul, but susceptible to psychology and sociology.

Novelistic figures, as we all know, are as real as any of us. Certain aspects of sounds have a swift, winged soul, but they are still susceptible to psychology and sociology.

The imperfect dream, with a point of departure in life, disgusts me, or rather, it would disgust me if I got into it.",,"and the kind of life I lead, if my face and my gestures betrayed the shy and ridiculous abnormality of my soul. In eyes that don’t even look at me I suspect there are smirks (which I consider only natural) directed at the awkward exception I embody in a world of people who know how to act and to enjoy life; and the passing physiognomies, informed by an awareness that I myself have interposed and superimposed, seem to snicker out loud at my life’s timid gesticulations.

"Ele mobilara — é impossível que não fosse à custa de algumas coisas essenciais — com um certo e aproximado luxo os seus dois quartos. Cuidara especialmente das cadeiras — de braços, fundas, moles —, dos reposteiros e dos tapetes. Dizia ele que assim se criara um interior “para manter a dignidade do tédio”. No quarto à moderna o tédio torna-se desconforto, mágoa física.","He had furnished—it is impossible that it was not at the expense of some essentials—with a certain approximate luxury his two rooms. She had taken special care of the chairs—arms, slings, soft—and the hangings and rugs. He said that in this way an interior had been created “to maintain the dignity of boredom”. In the modern bedroom, boredom becomes discomfort, physical grief.","i The literary magazine Orpheu was started in 1915 by Fernando Pessoa, Mário de Sá-Carneiro and Luís de Montalvor. Although only two issues were produced, the magazine had a considerable impact on the evolution of modern Portuguese literature.","He had furnished his two rooms with a semblance of luxury, no doubt at the expense of certain basic items. He had taken particular pains with the armchairs, which were soft and well-padded, and with the drapes and rugs. He explained that with this kind of an interior he could ‘maintain the dignity of tedium’. In rooms decorated in the modern style, tedium becomes a discomfort, a physical distress."

"Há momentos em que a vacuidade de se sentir viver atinge a espessura de uma coisa positiva.

"Há claustros na hora. Entardeceu nas esquivanças. Nos olhos azuis dos tanques um último desespero reflecte a morte do sol. Nós éramos tanta coisa dos parques antigos; de tão voluptuoso modo estávamos incorporados na presença das estátuas, no talhado inglês das áleas. Os vestidos, os espadins, as perruques, os meneios e os cortejos pertenciam tanto à substância de que o nosso espírito era feito! Nós quem? O repuxo apenas, no jardim deserto, água alada indo já menos alta no seu acto triste de querer voar.","There are cloisters on time. Dusk in the evasions. In the blue eyes of the tanks a last despair reflects the death of the sun. We were so much from the old parks; in such a voluptuous way we were incorporated in the presence of the statues, in the English carving of the alleys. The dresses, the swords, the wigs, the swings and the processions belonged so much to the substance of which our spirit was made! We who? Only the fountain, in the deserted garden, winged water rising less high in its sad act of wanting to fly.","A mischievous Destiny has made of me its playground. How I’d like to have emotions made of chintz or silk or brocade! How I’d like to have emotions as easily describable as that, to have emotions that could at least be described! There rises in my soul a feeling of regret that is God’s regret for everything, a dumb, tearful fury at the condemnation of dreams in the very flesh of those who dreamed them … And I hate without hatred the poets who wrote verses, all the idealists who realized their ideals, all those who got what they wanted. I wander aimlessly through the quiet streets, I walk until my body is as tired as my soul, until I feel that familiar pain that revels in being felt, a maternal compassion for oneself, set to music, indefinable. Oh to sleep, finally to sleep! To find some peace! To be an abstract consciousness of one’s own quiet breathing, with no world, no stars, no soul — a dead sea of emotion reflecting only an absence of stars!","There are cloisters in this moment. Night has fallen on all our evasions. A final despair in the blue eyes of the pools reflects the dying sun. We were so many things in the parks of old!

"A maioria da gente enferma de não saber dizer o que vê e o que pensa. Dizem que não há nada mais difícil do que definir em palavras uma espiral: é preciso, dizem, fazer no ar, com a mão sem literatura, o gesto, ascendentemente enrolado em ordem, com que aquela figura abstracta das molas ou de certas escadas se manifesta aos olhos. Mas, desde que nos lembremos que dizer é renovar, definiremos sem dificuldade uma espiral: é um círculo que sobe sem nunca conseguir acabar-se1. A maioria da gente, sei bem, não ousaria definir assim, porque supõe que definir é dizer o que os outros querem que se diga, que não o que é preciso dizer para definir. Direi melhor: uma espiral é um círculo virtual que se desdobra a subir sem nunca se realizar. Mas não, a definição ainda é abstracta. Buscarei o concreto, e tudo será visto: uma espiral é uma cobra sem cobra enroscada verticalmente em coisa nenhuma.","Most people suffer from not being able to say what they see and what they think. They say that there is nothing more difficult than defining a spiral in words: it is necessary, they say, to make in the air, with a hand without literature, the gesture, curled upwards in order, with which that abstract figure of springs or certain stairs manifest to the eyes. But as long as we remember that saying is renewing, we will easily define a spiral: it is a circle that goes up without ever managing to end1. Most people, I know well, would not dare to define it that way, because they suppose that defining is saying what others want to be said, rather than what it is necessary to say in order to define. I will put it better: a spiral is a virtual circle that unfolds upwards without ever being realized. But no, the definition is still abstract. I will look for the concrete, and everything will be seen: a spiral is a snake without a snake coiled vertically into nothing.","But as long as we remember that to speak means to renew language, we should have no difficulty whatsoever in describing a spiral: it is a circle that rises upwards but never closes upon itself (I know perfectly well that most people wouldn’t dare to define it thus, because they imagine that to define something one should say what other people want, and not what one needs to say in order to produce a definition). I would go farther: a spiral is a virtual circle which repeats itself as it rises but never reaches fulfillment. But, no, that’s still abstract. If I make it concrete all will become clear: a spiral is a snake, which is not a snake, coiled vertically around nothing.","Most people are afflicted by an inability to say what they see or think. They say there’s nothing more difficult than to define a spiral in words; they claim it’s necessary to use the unliterary hand, twirling it in a steadily upward direction, so that human eyes will perceive the abstract figure immanent in a wire spring and a certain type of staircase. But if we remember that to say is to renew, we will have no trouble defining a spiral: it’s a circle that rises without ever closing. I realize that most people would never dare define it this way, for they suppose that defining is to say what others want us to say rather than what’s required for the definition. I’ll say it more accurately: a spiral is a potential circle that winds round as it rises, without ever completing itself. But no, the definition is still abstract. I’ll resort to the concrete, and all will become clear: a spiral is a snake without a snake, vertically wound around nothing."

"Mas de repente, e no próprio imaginar, que fazia num café no feriado modesto do meio-dia, uma impressão de desagrado me assaltou o sonho: senti que teria pena. Sim, digo-o como se o dissesse circunstanciadamente: teria pena. O patrão Vasques, o guarda-livros Moreira, o caixa Borges, os bons rapazes todos, o garoto alegre que leva as cartas ao correio, o moço de todos os fretes, o gato meigo — tudo isso se tornou parte da minha vida; não poderia deixar tudo isso sem chorar, sem compreender que, por mau que me parecesse, era parte de mim que ficava com eles todos, que o separar-me deles era uma metade e semelhança da morte.","But suddenly, and in the very imagination, which I was doing in a cafe on the modest midday holiday, an impression of displeasure came over my dream: I felt that I would be sorry. Yes, I say it as if I said it in detail: I would be sorry. The boss Vasques, the bookkeeper Moreira, the cashier Borges, all the good guys, the happy boy who takes the letters to the post office, the boy with all the freights, the sweet cat — all this became part of my life; I couldn't leave all this without crying, without understanding that, as bad as it seemed to me, it was part of me that stayed with them all, that separating from them was a half and likeness of death.","But suddenly, even as I imagined this (during the brief holiday afforded by my lunch break in a café), a feeling of displeasure erupted into the dream: I would, I felt, be sad. Yes, I say it quite seriously: I would be sad. For my boss Vasques, Moreira the bookkeeper, Borges the cashier, all the lads, the cheery boy who takes the letters to the post office, the errand boy, the friendly cat — they have all become part of my life. I could never leave all that behind without weeping, without realizing, however displeasing the thought, that part of me would remain with them and that losing them would be akin to death.","But even as I was imagining this, during my miniature midday holiday in a café, an unpleasant thought assaulted my dream: I realized I would feel regret. Yes, I say it as if confronted by the actual circumstance: I would feel regret. Vasques my boss, Moreira the head bookkeeper, Borges the cashier, all the young men, the cheerful boy who takes letters to the post office, the boy who makes deliveries, the gentle cat – all this has become part of my life. And I wouldn’t be able to leave it without crying, without feeling that – like it or not – it was a part of me which would remain with all of them, and that to separate myself from them would be a partial death."

"As sombras rotas das folhagens, o canto trémulo das aves, os braços estendidos dos rios, trepidando ao sol o seu luzir fresco, as verduras, as papoilas, e a simplicidade das sensações — ao sentir isto, sinto dele saudades, como se ao senti-lo o não sentisse.","The broken shadows of the foliage, the trembling song of the birds, the outstretched arms of the rivers, their fresh glow trembling in the sun, the vegetables, the poppies, and the simplicity of sensations — when I feel this, I miss him, as if I felt it did not feel.","Once, when I was a child and happy, the voice of a brightly colored green parrot used to live in the neighboring courtyard.","The leaves’ tattered shadows, the birds’ tremulous song, the river’s long arms shimmering coolly in the sun, the plants, the poppies, and the simplicity of sensations – even while feeling all this, I’m nostalgic for it, as if in feeling it I didn’t feel it."
"Todo o homem de acção é essencialmente animado e optimista porque quem não sente é feliz. Conhece-se um homem de acção por nunca estar mal disposto.

The artificial provides an approach to the natural.,"Every man of action is basically cheerful and optimistic, because those who don’t feel are happy.

Whoever governs is happy, since to be sad one has to feel."

"Não aceito, disse, nem o critério do relojoeiro imperfeito nem o do relojoeiro sem benevolência. Não aceito o critério do relojoeiro imperfeito porque aqueles pormenores do governo e ajustamento do mundo, que nos parecem lapsos ou sem-razões, não podem, como tal, ser verdadeiramente dados sem que saibamos o plano. Vemos claramente um plano em tudo; vemos certas coisas que nos parecem sem razão, mas é de ponderar que, se há em tudo uma razão, haverá nisso também a mesma razão que há em tudo. Vemos a razão, porém não o plano; como diremos, então, que certas coisas estão fora do plano que não sabemos o que é? Assim como um poeta de ritmos subtis pode intercalar um verso arrítmico para fins rítmicos, isto é, para o próprio fim de que parece afastar-se, e um crítico mais purista do rectilíneo que do ritmo chamará errado esse verso, assim o Criador pode intercalar o que nossa estreita [lógica?] considera arritmias no decurso majestoso do seu ritmo metafísico.","I do not accept, he said, neither the criterion of the imperfect watchmaker nor that of the watchmaker without benevolence. I do not accept the criterion of the imperfect watchmaker because those details of the government and adjustment of the world, which seem to us to be lapses or unreasonable, cannot, as such, be truly given without our knowing the plan. We clearly see a plan in everything; we see certain things that seem to us to be without reason, but it must be pondered that, if there is a reason in everything, there will also be the same reason in it as there is in everything. We see the reason, but not the plan; how shall we say, then, that certain things are out of the plan that we do not know what they are? Just as a poet of subtle rhythms can intersperse an arrhythmic verse for rhythmic ends, that is, for the very end from which it seems to move away, and a more purist critic of the rectilinear who of rhythm will wrongly call that verse, so the Creator can intersperse what our narrow [logic?] considers arrhythmias in the majestic course of its metaphysical rhythm.","The happiest are unaware of these frustrated inner longings; the less happy are neither aware nor entirely unaware of them, and only the occasional clumsy impulse, a roughness in the way they treat the other, evokes, on the casual surface of gestures and words, the hidden Demon, the old Eve, the Knight or the Sylph.","I’ve said that I don’t accept the notion of the watchmaker who is imperfect or who isn’t benevolent. I reject the notion of the imperfect watchmaker, because those aspects of the world’s government and organization that seem flawed or nonsensical might prove otherwise, if we only knew the plan. While clearly seeing a plan in everything, we also see certain things that apparently make no sense, but if there’s a reason behind everything, then won’t these things be guided by that same reason? Seeing the reason but not the actual plan, how can we say that certain things are outside the plan, when we don’t know what it is? Just as a poet of subtle rhythms can insert an arrhythmic verse for rhythmic purposes, i.e. for the very purpose he seems to be going against (and a critic who’s more linear than rhythmic will say that the verse is mistaken), so the Creator can insert things that our narrow logic considers arrhythmic into the majestic flow of his metaphysical rhythm."

"Ao agir com outros perco, ao menos, uma coisa — que é agir só.","In acting with others, I lose at least one thing - which is to act alone.","Others will lean from the same windows; those who have forgotten about shadowy fears are sleeping, nostalgic for the sun they never knew; and I myself, who dares but does not act, will end up, with no regrets, among those soggy reeds made muddy by the nearby river and by my own flaccid inertia, beneath the vast autumn skies of evening, in impossibly far-flung places.","When I act with others, there’s at least one thing I lose – acting alone."
"E eu, cujo espírito de crítica própria me não permite senão que veja os defeitos, as falhas, eu, que não ouso escrever mais que trechos, bocados, excertos do inexistente, eu mesmo, no pouco que escrevo, sou imperfeito também. Mais valera, pois, ou a obra completa, ainda que má, que em todo o caso é obra; ou a ausência de palavras, o silêncio inteiro da alma que se reconhece incapaz de agir.","And I, whose spirit of self-criticism only allows me to see the flaws, the flaws, I, who dare not write more than excerpts, bits, excerpts of the non-existent, I myself, in the little I write, am imperfect too. It would be better, therefore, or the complete work, even if bad, which in any case is work; or the absence of words, the entire silence of the soul that recognizes itself incapable of acting.","Much of what I feel and think I owe to my work as a bookkeeper since the former exists as a negation of and flight from the latter. If I had to fill in the space provided on a questionnaire to list one’s formative literary influences, on the first dotted line I would write the name of Cesário Verde, but the list would be incomplete without the names of Senhor Vasques, Moreira the bookkeeper, Vieira the traveling salesman and António the office boy. And after each of them I would write in capital letters the key word: LISBON. In fact, they were all as important as Cesário Verde in providing corrective coefficients for my vision of the world. I think “corrective coefficients” is the term (though, of course, I’m unsure of its exact meaning) that engineers use of a methodology applying mathematics to life. If it is the right term, that’s what they were to me. If it isn’t, let it stand for what might have been, and my intention serve in place of a failed metaphor. When, with all the clarity I can muster, I consider what my life has apparently been, I imagine it as some brightly colored scrap of litter — a chocolate wrapper or a cigar ring — that the eavesdropping waitress brushes lightly from the soiled tablecloth into the dustpan, among the crumbs and crusts of reality itself. It stands out from those things whose fate it shares by virtue of a privilege that is also destined for the dustpan. The gods continue their conversations above the sweeping, utterly indifferent to these incidents in the world below. Yes, if I had been rich, cosseted, carefully groomed and ornamental, I would never have known that brief moment as a pretty piece of paper among the breadcrumbs; I would have been left on one of fortune’s trays — ‘Not for me, thank you’ — and returned to the sideboard to grow old and stale. Discarded once my useful center has been eaten, I am thus relegated to the rubbish bin, along with the crumbs of what remains of Christ’s body, unable even to imagine what will come after, and under what stars; but I know there will be an “after.” 243 [c. 4/1930] The burden of feeling! The burden of having to feel!","And I, whose self-critical spirit allows me only to see my lapses and defects, I, who dare write only passages, fragments, excerpts of the non-existent, I myself – in the little that I write – am also imperfect. Better either the complete work, which is in any case a work, even if it’s bad, or the absence of words, the unbroken silence of the soul that knows it is incapable of acting."
"Sábio deveras é o que tem a possibilidade da altura nos músculos e a negação de subir no conhecimento. Ele tem, por visão, todos os montes; e tem, por posição, todos os vales. O sol que doura os píncaros dourá-los-á para ele mais [que] para quem ali o sofre; e o palácio alto entre florestas será mais belo ao que o contempla do vale que ao que o esquece nas salas que o constituem de prisão.","Wise indeed is he who has the possibility of height in his muscles and the denial of rising in knowledge. He has by vision all the mountains; and has, by position, all valleys. The sun that gilds the peaks will gild them more for him [than] for those who suffer there; and the high palace among forests will be more beautiful to the one who contemplates it from the valley than to the one who forgets it in the rooms that constitute it as a prison.","The wise man has in his muscles the ability to climb to great heights and, in his mind, the refusal to do so. From where he stands, he can see all the mountains and all the valleys. The sun that gilds the peaks looks more golden to him than it does to someone actually on the peak exposed to that bright light; and the palace built high up in the woods is far more beautiful to someone looking at it from the valley than to someone imprisoned in its grand rooms.","Wise is the man who has the potential for height in his muscles but who renounces climbing in his consciousness. By virtue of his gaze, he has all hills, and by virtue of his position, all valleys. The sun that gilds the summits will gild them more for him than for someone at the top who must endure the bright light; and the palace perched high in the woods will be more beautiful for those who see it from the valley than for those who, imprisoned in its rooms, forget it."

"Feliz quem não exige da vida mais do que ela espontaneamente lhe dá, guiando-se pelo instinto dos gatos, que buscam o sol quando há sol, e quando não há sol o calor, onde quer que esteja. Feliz quem abdica da sua personalidade pela imaginação, e se deleita na contemplação das vidas alheias, vivendo, não todas as impressões, mas o espectáculo externo de todas as impressões alheias. Feliz, por fim, esse que abdica de tudo, e a quem, porque abdicou de tudo, nada pode ser tirado nem diminuído.","Happy is he who does not demand more from life than it spontaneously gives him, guided by the instinct of cats, who seek the sun when there is sun, and when there is no sun, heat, wherever it is. Happy is he who gives up his personality through imagination, and delights in contemplating the lives of others, living, not all impressions, but the external spectacle of all other people's impressions. Happy, finally, is he who gives up everything, and to whom, because he has given up everything, nothing can be taken away or diminished.","The stately rhythm of our clear, majestic language, the expression of ideas in words that flowed as inevitably as water down a hillside, that vocalic thrill by which every sound takes on its ideal color: all this intoxicated me as instinctively as some great political passion. And, as I said, I wept; I still cry when I remember it today. It isn’t nostalgia for my childhood, for which I feel no nostalgia: it’s nostalgia for the emotion of that moment","Happy the man who doesn’t ask for more than what life spontaneously gives him, being guided by the instinct of cats, which seek sunlight when there’s sun, and when there’s no sun then heat, wherever they find it. Happy the man who renounces his personality in favour of the imagination and who delights in contemplating other people’s lives, experiencing not all impressions but the outward spectacle of all impressions. And happy, finally, the man who renounces everything, who has nothing that can be taken from him, nothing that can be diminished."
"Onde está Deus, mesmo que não exista? Quero rezar e chorar, arrepender-me de crimes que não cometi, gozar ser perdoado como uma carícia não propriamente materna.","Where is God, even if he doesn't exist? I want to pray and cry, to repent of crimes I didn't commit, to enjoy being forgiven like a caress that isn't exactly maternal.","Sometimes the actual rhythm of the phrase will demand “God” and not “the Gods”; at others, the two syllables of “the Gods” will simply impose themselves on a phrase, and I then verbally change universes; at still other times, in contrast, the need of an internal rhyme, a shift in rhythm or an emotional shock, will tip the balance and then either polytheism or monotheism will fit itself to the moment and be preferred.","Where is God, even if he doesn’t exist? I want to pray and to weep, to repent of crimes I didn’t commit, to enjoy the feeling of forgiveness like a caress that’s more than maternal."

"Nos primeiros dias do outono subitamente entrado, quando o escurecer toma uma evidência de qualquer coisa prematura, e parece que tardámos muito no que fazemos de dia, gozo, mesmo entre o trabalho quotidiano, esta antecipação de não trabalhar que a própria sombra traz consigo, por isso que é noite e a noite é sono, lares, livramento.

When the lights go on in the big office, banishing the darkness, and we move seamlessly from day to evening shift, I am assailed by an absurd sense of comfort, like the memory of another time, and I feel as contented with what I write as if I were sitting reading myself to sleep in bed.","During the first days of Autumn when nightfall arrives suddenly, as if prematurely, and it seems we took longer to do our day’s work, I enjoy, while still working, the thought of not working which the darkness brings, for the darkness is night, and night means sleep, home, freedom.

"Considero a vida uma estalagem onde tenho que me demorar até que chegue a diligência do abismo. Não sei onde ela me levará, porque não sei nada. Poderia considerar esta estalagem uma prisão, porque estou compelido a aguardar nela; poderia considerá-la um lugar de sociáveis, porque aqui me encontro com outros. Não sou, porém, nem impaciente nem comum. Deixo ao que são os que se fecham no quarto, deitados moles na cama onde esperam sem sono; deixo ao que fazem os que conversam nas salas, de onde as músicas e as vozes chegam cómodas até mim.

I don't know where it will take me, because I don't know anything. I might consider this inn a prison, for I am compelled to wait there; I could consider it a sociable place, because here I meet others. But I am neither impatient nor common.

"Tudo é complexo, ou sou eu que o sou. Mas, de qualquer modo, não importa porque, de qualquer modo, nada importa.

But at any rate it doesn’t matter, because at any rate nothing matters.

"Há um cansaço da inteligência abstracta, e é o mais horroroso dos cansaços. Não pesa como o cansaço do corpo, nem inquieta como o cansaço do conhecimento pela emoção. É um peso da consciência do mundo, um não poder respirar com a alma1.","There is a weariness of abstract intelligence, and it is the most horrible of weariness. It doesn't weigh like the tiredness of the body, nor restless like the tiredness of knowledge through emotion. It is a weight of the conscience of the world, an inability to breathe with the soul1.","There is such a thing as a weariness of the abstract intelligence, which is the most terrible of all wearinesses. It does not weigh on you like physical weariness, nor does it trouble you like a weariness of the emotions. It is the consciousness of the weight of the whole world, an inability in the soul to breathe.","The abstract intelligence produces a fatigue that’s the worst of all fatigues. It doesn’t weigh on us like bodily fatigue, nor disconcert like the fatigue of emotional experience. It’s the weight of our consciousness of the world, a shortness of breath in our soul."
"Assim sou. Quando quero pensar, vejo.

When I want to go down in my soul, I suddenly stop, forgotten, at the beginning of the spiral of the deep stairs, watching through the high-floor window the sun that leaves the diffused agglomeration of the roofs fawn.","That’s how I am.

"Hoje, em um dos devaneios sem propósito nem dignidade que constituem grande parte da substância espiritual da minha vida, imaginei-me liberto para sempre da Rua dos Douradores, do patrão Vasques, do guarda-livros Moreira, dos empregados todos, do moço, do garoto e do gato. Senti em sonho a minha libertação, como se mares do Sul me houvessem oferecido ilhas maravilhosas por descobrir. Seria então o repouso, a arte conseguida, o cumprimento intelectual do meu ser.","Today, in one of the daydreams without purpose or dignity that constitute a large part of the spiritual substance of my life, I imagined myself forever freed from Rua dos Douradores, from boss Vasques, from the bookkeeper Moreira, from all the employees, from the young man, from the boy and cat. In a dream I felt my liberation, as if the South Seas had offered me wonderful islands to discover. It would then be the rest, the achieved art, the intellectual fulfillment of my being.","Any large area of land has the potential to be a palace, but where’s the palace if no one builds there? My pride stoned by blind men and my disillusion trampled on by beggars. “I want you only so that I can dream you,” they say to their beloved in poems they never send, those who dare not say anything to her. The line “I want you only so that I can dream you” is from an old poem of mine. I register this memory with a smile, and do not even comment on the smile. 187 [Spring 1929?] Facing me on the sloping desk are the two large pages of the heavy accounts ledger; I look up with weary eyes, my soul even wearier than my eyes. Beyond the nothing that this represents is the warehouse in Rua dos Douradores with its rows of ordinary shelves and ordinary employees, human order and the peace and quiet of the vulgar. Through the window come diverse noises, and those diverse noises are as vulgar as the peace and quiet of the shelves. I look with new eyes at the two white pages, on which my careful numbers record the company’s results. And I smile to myself as I think that life, which includes these pages bearing the names of fabrics and various sums of money, blank spaces, ruled lines and letters, also includes the great navigators, the great saints, the poets of every age, none of whom appear in this book, a whole vast progeny excluded by those who determine what is of value in the world. As I write the name of a fabric I do not even know, the doors of the Indus and of Samarkand open up to me; and — belonging to neither place — the poetry of Persia with its quatrains and unrhymed third lines provides a distant support for my disquiet. I make no mistakes, though, I write, I add up, and the accounts continue to be kept, carried out as usual by an employee of this office. 188 [1929?] Today, during one of those periods of daydreaming which, though devoid of either purpose or dignity, still constitute the greater part of the spiritual substance of my life, I imagined myself free for ever of Rua dos Douradores, of my boss Vasques, of Moreira the bookkeeper, of all the other employees, the errand boy, the post boy, even the cat. In dreams, that freedom felt to me as if the South Seas had proffered up a gift of marvelous islands as yet undiscovered. Freedom would mean rest, artistic achievement, the intellectual fulfillment of my being.","Today, in one of the pointless and worthless daydreams that constitute a large part of my inner life, I imagined being forever free from the Rua dos Douradores, from Vasques my boss, from Moreira the head bookkeeper, from all the employees, from the delivery boy, the office boy and the cat. In my dream I experienced freedom, as if the South Seas had offered me marvellous islands to be discovered. It would all be repose, artistic achievement, the intellectual fulfilment of my being."

"Faço a paisagem ter para mim os efeitos da música, evocar-me imagens visuais — curioso e dificílimo triunfo do êxtase, tão difícil porque o agente evocativo é da mesma ordem de sensações que o que há-de evocar. O meu triunfo máximo no género foi quando, a certa hora ambígua de aspecto e luz, olhando para o Cais do Sodré nitidamente o vi um pagode chinês com estranhos guizos nas pontas dos telhados como chapéus absurdos — curioso pagode chinês pintado no espaço, sobre o espaço-cetim, não sei como, sobre o espaço que perdura na abominável terceira dimensão. E a hora cheirou-me verdadeiramente a um tecido arrastado e longínquo e com uma grande inveja de realidade…","I make the landscape have the effects of music for me, conjure up visual images for me — a curious and extremely difficult triumph of ecstasy, so difficult because the evocative agent is of the same order of sensations as the one it is to evoke. My greatest triumph in the genre was when, at a certain ambiguous hour of appearance and light, looking at Cais do Sodré I clearly saw a Chinese pagoda with strange bells on the roof tips like absurd hats — a curious Chinese pagoda painted in space, over the satin-space, I don't know how, about the space that lingers in the abominable third dimension. And the hour really smelled like a fabric dragged and far away and with a great envy of reality…","The women who freely offered their love find themselves free of the conquests they so adore. Those who conquered find themselves free of the victories to which their lives predestined them. Death ennobles and clothes the poor absurd cadaver in unaccustomed finery. There you have a free man, though admittedly it was not a freedom he sought.","Immoral behaviour is inadvisable, for it demeans your personality in the eyes of others and makes it banal. But to be inwardly immoral while being held in high esteem by everyone around you, to be a dedicated and corporally chaste wife and mother while at the same time mysteriously catching diseases from all the men in the neighbourhood, from the grocers to – this is the height of gratification for anyone who really wants to enjoy and expand her individuality without stooping to the base method of naturally base housemaids or else falling into the rigid virtuousness of profoundly stupid women, whose virtue is merely the offspring of self-interest."

"Em qualquer espírito, que não seja disforme, existe a crença em Deus. Em qualquer espírito, que não seja disforme, não existe crença em um Deus definido. É qualquer ente, existente e impossível, que rege tudo; cuja pessoa, se a tem, ninguém pode definir; cujos fins, se deles usa, ninguém pode compreender. Chamando-lhe Deus dizemos tudo, porque, não tendo a palavra Deus sentido algum preciso, assim o afirmamos sem dizer nada. Os atributos de infinito, de eterno, de omnipotente, de sumamente justo ou bondoso, que por vezes lhe colamos, descolam-se por si como todos os adjectivos desnecessários quando o substantivo basta. E Ele, a que, por indefinido, não podemos dar atributos, é, por isso mesmo, o substantivo absoluto.","In any spirit, which is not deformed, there is belief in God. In any spirit, which is not deformed, there is no belief in a definite God. It is any being, existing and impossible, that governs everything; whose person, if any, no one can define; whose ends, if he uses them, no one can understand. By calling him God, we say everything, because, the word God having no precise meaning, we say so without saying anything. The attributes of the infinite, the eternal, the omnipotent, the supremely just or kind, which we sometimes attach to it, take off by themselves like all unnecessary adjectives when the noun suffices. And He, to whom, indefinitely, we cannot attribute attributes, is, for that very reason, the absolute noun.","A belief in God exists in every healthy mind, but not a belief in a definite God. God is just some supreme, impossible being who rules over everything; whose person, if he has one, no one can define; whose intentions, if he has any, no one can understand. By calling him God, we are saying exactly that, because the word God has no precise meaning, and so we affirm his existence without actually affirming that he does exist. The attributes of infinite, eternal, omnipotent, supremely just or kind that we sometimes attach to him detach themselves as do all unnecessary adjectives when the noun itself suffices. And so we cannot give Him any attributes because he is indefinite and, for that same reason, he is the ultimate noun.","Every sound mind believes in God. No sound mind believes in a definite God. There is some being, both real and impossible, who reigns over all things and whose person (if he has one) cannot be defined, and whose purposes (if he has any) cannot be fathomed.

"Mas recolho-me e abrando. “Sou do tamanho do que vejo!” E a frase fica-me sendo a alma inteira, encosto a ela todas as emoções que sinto, e sobre mim, por dentro, como sobre a cidade por fora, cai a paz indecifrável do luar duro que começa largo com o anoitecer.","But I pull back and slow down. “I am the size of what I see!” And the phrase becomes my entire soul, I put all the emotions I feel against it, and over me, inside, as over the city on the outside, falls the indecipherable peace of the hard moonlight that starts wide with dusk.","But I pull myself together and calm myself. “I am the size of what I see!” The phrase still fills my whole soul, I rest every emotion I have on it, and the indecipherable peace of the harsh moonlight beginning to spread as night comes falls on me, in me, as it does on the city beyond.","But I control myself and calm down. ‘I’m the size of what I see!’ And the phrase becomes my entire soul, I rest all my emotions on it, and over me, on the inside, as over the city on the outside, there descends an indecipherable peace from the hard moonlight that broadly begins to shine as the night falls."
"Sei bem que o dia em que for guarda-livros da casa Vasques e C.a será um dos grandes dias da minha vida. Sei-o com uma antecipação amarga e irónica, mas sei-o com a vantagem intelectual da certeza.","I know very well that the day I become a bookkeeper at the Vasques e C.a. house will be one of the great days of my life. I know this with bitter, ironic anticipation, but I know it with the intellectual edge of certainty.","And at last — I see it in my mind’s eye — over the darkness of the shining roofs, the cold light of the warm morning breaks like a torment out of the Apocalypse. Once more the immense night of the growing brightness. Once more the same horror — another day, life and its fictitious usefulness and vain activity; my physical personality, visible, social, communicable through words that mean nothing, usable by other people’s thoughts and gestures.","I know that the day I become head bookkeeper of Vasques & Co. will be one of the great days of my life.

"Tudo isto vale para o esteta pelas sensações que lhe causa. Avançar seria entrar no domínio onde começa o ciúme, o sofrimento, a excitação. Nesta antecâmara da emoção há toda a suavidade do amor sem a sua profundeza — um gozo leve, portanto, aroma vago de desejos, e, se com isso se perde a grandeza que há na tragédia do amor, repare-se que, para o esteta, as tragédias são coisas interessantes de observar, mas incómodas de sofrer. O próprio cultivo da imaginação é prejudicado pelo da vida. Reina quem não está entre os vulgares.","All this is valid for the esthete for the sensations it causes him. Moving forward would be entering the domain where jealousy, suffering, excitement begin. In this antechamber of emotion there is all the softness of love without its depth - a light enjoyment, therefore, a vague aroma of desires, and, if this loses the grandeur that is in the tragedy of love, notice that, for the esthete , tragedies are interesting things to observe, but uncomfortable to suffer. The very cultivation of imagination is hindered by that of life. Whoever is not among the vulgar reigns.",The sense of smell is like a strange way of seeing. It evokes sentimental landscapes out of a mere sketch in our subconscious minds.,"The value of this for the aesthete is in the feelings it produces. To go further would be to enter the realm of jealousy, suffering and anxiety. In this antechamber of emotion there’s all the sweetness of love – hints of pleasure, whiffs of passion – without any of its depth. If this means giving up the grandeur of tragic love, we must remember that tragedies, for the aesthete, are interesting to observe but unpleasant to experience. The cultivation of life hinders that of the imagination. It is the aloof, uncommon man who rules."

"Parece uma constipação na alma. E com a imagem literária de se estar doente nasce um desejo de que a vida fosse uma convalescença, sem andar; e a ideia de convalescença evoca as quintas dos arredores, mas lá para dentro, onde são lares, longe da rua e das rodas.

And with the literary image of being sick, a desire is born that life would be a convalescence, without walking; and the idea of convalescence evokes the farms in the surroundings, but inside, where they are homes, away from the street and the wheels. Yes, you don't feel anything. One passes consciously, sleeping only with the impossibility of giving the body another direction, the door where one must enter. Everything passes. What is with the tambourine, O standing bear?","It’s like having a cold in the soul. And with that literary image of illness comes a longing for life to be like a long period of convalescence, confined to bed; and the idea of convalescence evokes the image of large villas on the outskirts of the city, but deep in the heart of them, by the hearth, far from the streets and the traffic. No, you can’t hear anything. You consciously pass through the door you must enter, you go through it as if asleep, unable to make your body go in any other direction. You pass through everything. Where’s your tambourine now, sleeping bear?","It’s like a head-cold of the soul. And this literary image of being sick makes us wish that life were a convalescence, obliging us to stay off our feet. And the idea of convalescence makes us think of villas on the outskirts of town – not the gardens that surround them but their cosy interiors, far from the road and the turning wheels. No, we don’t feel anything. We consciously pass through the door we have to enter, and the fact we have to enter it is enough to put us to sleep. We pass through everything. Where’s your tambourine, O bear that just stands there?"
"Não são uma ociosidade estas minhas considerações comigo, mas uma elucubração científica como qualquer outra que o seja. Por isso, antes de e sem ter uma resposta, suponho o possível actual e entrego-me, em análises interiores, à visão imaginada de aspectos possíveis deste desideratum realizado. Mal nisso penso, logo dentro da visão do meu espírito surgem cientistas curvados sobre estampas, sabendo bem que elas são vidas; microscopistas da tessitura surgem dos tapetes; fisicistas do seu desenho largo e bruxuleante nos contornos; químicos, sim, da ideia das formas e das cores nos quadros; geologistas das camadas estráticas dos camafeus; psicólogos, enfim — e isto mais importa — que uma a uma notam e congregam as sensações que deve sentir uma estatueta, as ideias que devem passar pelo psiquismo esbatido de uma figura de quadro ou de vitral, os impulsos loucos, as paixões sem freio, as compaixões e ódios ocasionais e ▢ que têm nesses universos especiais de fixidezes e morte nos gestos eternos dos baixos-relevos, nas consciências imortais[?] dos figurantes das telas.","These considerations of mine are not idleness with me, but a scientific elucubration like any other. Therefore, before and without having an answer, I assume the current possible and surrender, in interior analyses, to the imagined vision of possible aspects of this realized desideratum. As soon as I think about it, just within the vision of my spirit there appear scientists bent over prints, knowing well that they are lives; weave microscopists emerge from the rugs; physicalists of its wide design and flickering in the contours; chemists, yes, from the idea of shapes and colors in paintings; geologists of the stratic layers of cameos; psychologists, finally — and this is more important — that one by one they notice and bring together the sensations that a statuette must feel, the ideas that must pass through the faint psyche of a picture or stained-glass figure, the crazy impulses, the unbridled passions, the occasional ▢ compassion and hatred that they have in these special universes of fixity and death in the eternal gestures of the bas-reliefs, in the immortal consciences[?] of the extras on the canvas.","How often, weighed down by a tedium that verges on madness, or an anguish that seems to go beyond all anguish, do I stop and hesitate before I rebel, do I hesitate and stop before making myself a god.","These private deliberations aren’t an idle pastime but a scientific lucubration like any other. And so, before having an answer and without knowing if I’ll ever have one, I think of what’s possible as if it already existed, and with inner analyses and intense concentration I envision the likely results of this actualized desideratum. As soon as I start thinking this way, scientists immediately appear in my mind, hunched over illustrations that they know to be real lives; microscopists of warp and weft emerge from the rugs, physicists emerge from the broad, swirling patterns around their borders, chemists from the idea of shapes and colours in pictures, geologists from the stratified layers in cameos, and finally (and most importantly) psychologists who record and classify – one by one – the sensations that a statuette must feel, the ideas that pass through the hazy psyche of a figure in a painting or a stained-glass window, the wild impulses, the unbridled passions, the occasional hatreds and sympathies and? found in these special universes marked by death and immobility – whether in the eternal gestures of bas-reliefs or in the immortal consciousnesses of painted figures."

"Nada mais… De tanto lidar com sombras, eu mesmo me converti numa sombra — no que penso, no que sinto, no que sou. A saudade do normal que nunca fui entra então na substância do meu ser. Mas é ainda isso, e só isso, que sinto. Não sinto propriamente pena do amigo que vai ser operado.

"Parecendo às vezes, à minha análise rápida, parasitar os outros, na realidade o que acontece é que os obrigo a ser parasitas da minha posterior emoção.

Inhabits my living the shells of their individualities. I trace their steps in the clay of my spirit and so more than they, taking them into my consciousness, I have taken their steps and walked in their ways.","In order that I can feel, I always keep my own feelings to myself. I feel almost guilty to be writing these semi-reflections at this late-afternoon hour when a light breeze is beginning to get up, taking on color as it does. No, not taking on color, it isn’t the breeze that’s doing that, it’s the air on which it so hesitantly floats; but since it seems to me that it is the breeze taking on color, that is what I say, because, given that I am I, I have to say how it seems to me.","Although it sometimes seems to my hasty analysis that I’m the parasite of others, what really occurs is that I force them to be parasites of my subsequent emotion. My life inhabits the shells of their personalities. I reproduce their footsteps in my spirit’s clay, absorbing them so thoroughly into my consciousness that I, in the end, have taken their steps and walked in their paths even more than they."

"E, daí, talvez isto tudo tivesse outra explicação qualquer, e ele estivesse somente imitando alguém.

"Mas, de repente, da surpresa de uma esquina que já lá estava, rodou para a minha vista um homem velho e mesquinho, pobre e não humilde, que seguia impaciente sob a chuva que havia abrandado. Esse, que por certo não tinha fito, tinha ao menos impaciência. Olhei-o com a atenção, não já desatenta, que se dá às coisas, mas definidora, que se dá aos símbolos. Era o símbolo de ninguém; por isso tinha pressa. Era o símbolo de quem nada fora; por isso sofria. Era parte, não dos que sentem a sorrir a alegria incómoda da chuva, mas da mesma chuva — um inconsciente, tanto que sentia a realidade.","But suddenly, from the surprise of a corner that was already there, I saw an old and mean man, poor and not humble, who was impatient in the rain that had slowed down. This one, who certainly had no intention, was at least impatient. I looked at him with the attention, no longer inattentive, which is given to things, but defining, which is given to symbols. It was nobody's symbol; so I was in a hurry. It was the symbol of one who was nothing; that's why I suffered. He was part, not of those who smile at the uncomfortable joy of the rain, but of the rain itself—an unconscious, so much so that he felt reality.","However, a surprise was waiting just around the corner: suddenly, a miserable old man, poor but not humble, came making his ill-tempered way through the slackening rain. This man, while clearly without any urgent goal, was possessed at least of a keen impatience. I studied him intently, not with the distracted eye with which one usually looks at things, but with the analytical eye reserved for deciphering symbols. He symbolized nobody; that was why he was in such a hurry. He symbolized those who have never been anybody; that was at the root of his suffering. He did not belong with those who smiled beneath the inconvenient joy of the rain, he belonged to the rain itself — an unconscious being, so unconscious that he could feel reality.","But suddenly, popping into my view from behind a corner, there appeared an old, mean-looking, poor and unhumble man who impatiently made his way in the rain that was letting up. He surely had no special aim, but at least he had impatience. I looked at him with concentration, no longer the careless kind applied to things, but the kind that discerns symbols. He was the symbol of nobody, which is why he was in a hurry. He was the symbol of those who were never anything; that is why he suffered. He belonged not to those who smile as they feel the rain’s joyful discomfort, but to the rain itself – a man so unconscious that he felt reality."

55.,55.,"An over-curious analysis of sensations — sometimes purely imaginary — the identification of the heart with the landscape, the anatomical laying bare of the nerves, replacing will with desire and thought with aspiration — all these things are too familiar to seem novel in someone else’s words or to bring me peace.",55

"O olfacto é uma vista estranha. Evoca paisagens sentimentais por um desenhar súbito do subconsciente. Tenho sentido isto muitas vezes. Passo numa rua. Não vejo nada, ou antes, olhando tudo, vejo como toda a gente vê. Sei que vou por uma rua e não sei que ela existe com lados feitos de casas diferentes e construídas por gente humana. Passo numa rua. De uma padaria sai um cheiro a pão que nauseia por doce no cheiro dele: e a minha infância ergue-se de determinado bairro distante, e outra padaria me surge daquele reino das fadas que é tudo que se nos morreu. Passo numa rua. Cheira de repente às frutas do tabuleiro inclinado da loja estreita; e a minha breve vida de campo, não sei já quando nem onde, tem árvores ao fim e sossego no meu coração, indiscutivelmente menino. Passo uma rua. Transtorna-me, sem que eu espere, um cheiro aos caixotes do caixoteiro: ó meu Cesário, apareces-me e eu sou enfim feliz porque regressei, pela recordação, à única verdade, que é a literatura.","Smell is a strange sight. It evokes sentimental landscapes through a sudden drawing of the subconscious. I have felt this many times. I walk on a street. I don't see anything, or rather, looking at everything, I see as everyone else sees. I know I'm going down a street and I don't know that it exists with sides made of different houses built by human people. I walk on a street. From a bakery comes a smell of bread that makes me nauseous for sweetness in its smell: and my childhood rises from a certain distant neighborhood, and another bakery comes to me from that fairyland that is everything that has died for us. I walk on a street. It suddenly smells of fruit on the slanted tray of the narrow shop; and my brief country life, I don't know when or where, has trees at the end and peace in my heart, indisputably a boy. I pass a street. Unexpectedly, the smell of the cashier's crates overwhelms me: oh my Cesario, you appear to me and I am finally happy because I have returned, through memory, to the only truth, which is literature.","Everything that was ours, simply because it was once ours, even those things we merely chanced to live with or see on a daily basis, becomes part of us. It was not the office boy who left today for some place in Galicia unknown to me, it was a part, vital because both visual and human, of the very substance of my life. Today I am diminished, no longer quite the same. The office boy left today. Everything that happens in the world we live in happens in us. Anything that ceases to exist in the world we see around us, ceases to exist in us. Everything that was, assuming we noticed it when it was there, is torn from us when it leaves. The office boy left today. As I sit down at the high desk and return to yesterday’s accounts, I feel heavier, older, my will weaker. But today’s vague tragedy interrupts what should be the automatic process of drawing up accounts with meditations that I have to struggle to suppress. The only way I can find the heart to work is by turning myself, through active inertia, into my own slave. The office boy left today. Yes, tomorrow or another day or whenever the silent bell of death or departure tolls for me, it will be me who is no longer here, an old copybook to be tidied away into a cupboard under the stairs. Yes, tomorrow, or whenever Fate decrees, what was supposedly me will die. Will I go back to my native village?","Smell is a strange way of seeing. It evokes sentimental scenes, sketched all of a sudden by the subconscious. I’ve often experienced this. I’m walking down a street. I see nothing, or rather, I look all around and see the way everyone sees. I know I’m walking down a street and don’t know that it exists with two sides comprised of variously shaped buildings made by human hands. I’m walking down a street. The smell of bread from a bakery nauseates me with its sweetness, and my childhood rises up from a distant neighbourhood, and another bakery emerges from that fairyland which is everything we ever had that has died. I’m walking down a street. Suddenly I smell the fruit on the slanted rack of the small grocery, and my short life in the country – I can’t say from when or where – has trees in the background and peace in what can only be my childhood heart. I’m walking down a street. I’m unexpectedly thrown off balance by the smell of crates from the crate-maker’s: my dear Cesário! * You appear before me and at last I’m happy, for I’ve returned by way of memory to the only truth, which is literature."
"Detesto a leitura. Tenho um tédio antecipado das páginas desconhecidas. Sou capaz de ler só o que já conheço.

"Tenho reparado, muitas vezes, que certas personagens de romance tomam para nós um relevo que nunca poderiam alcançar os que são nossos conhecidos e amigos, os que falam connosco e nos ouvem na vida visível e real.

And this makes me fantasize about whether everything in the sum total of the world might not be an interconnected series of dreams and novels, like little boxes inside larger boxes that are inside yet larger ones, everything being a story made up of stories, like A Thousand and One Nights, unreally taking place in the never-ending night."

"Leve, como uma coisa que começasse, a maresia da brisa pairou de sobre o Tejo e espalhou-se sujamente pelos princípios da Baixa. Nauseava frescamente, num torpor frio de mar morno. Senti a vida no estômago, e o olfacto tornou-se-me uma coisa por detrás dos olhos. Altas, pousavam em nada nuvens ralas, rolos, num cinzento a desmoronar-se para branco falso. A atmosfera era de uma ameaça de céu cobarde, como a de uma trovoada inaudível, feita de ar somente.","Light, like something just starting, the sea breeze hovered over the Tagus and spread dirty through the beginnings of Baixa. He was nauseated freshly, in the cold torpor of a warm sea. I felt life in my stomach, and smell became something behind my eyes. Tall, thin clouds landed on nothing, rolls, a gray crumbling to false white. The atmosphere was that of a cowardly sky menace, like an inaudible thunderclap, made of air alone.","Fragile as something just begun, the salt breeze hovered over the Tejo and grubbily infiltrated the fringes of the Baixa. It blew cool and rank over the torpor of the warm sea. Life became something lodged in my stomach, and my sense of smell inhabited some space behind my eyes. High up, perching on nothing at all, thin skeins of cloud dissolved from gray into false white. The atmosphere was like a threat made by a cowardly sky, like inaudible thunder, full of nothing but air.","Faint, like something just beginning, the low-tide smell wafted over the Tagus and putridly spread over the streets near the shore. The stench was crisply nauseating, with a cold torpor of lukewarm sea. I felt life in my stomach, and my sense of smell shifted to behind my eyes. Tall, sparse bundles of clouds alighted on nothing, their greyness disintegrating into a pseudo-white. A cowardly sky threatened the atmosphere, as if with inaudible thunder, made only of air."

"Não se subordinar a nada — nem a um homem, nem a um amor, nem a uma ideia, ter aquela independência longínqua que consiste em não crer na verdade, nem, se a houvesse, na utilidade do conhecimento dela — tal é o estado em que, parece-me, deve decorrer, para consigo mesma, a vida íntima intelectual dos que não vivem sem pensar. Pertencer — eis a banalidade. Credo, ideal, mulher ou profissão — tudo isso é a cela e as algemas. Ser é estar livre. A mesma ambição, se nos orgulhamos de que é, é um fardo, não nos orgulharíamos se compreendêssemos que é um cordel pelo qual nos puxam. Não: nem ligações connosco! Livres de nós como dos outros, contemplativos sem êxtase, pensadores sem conclusão, viveremos, libertos de Deus, o pequeno intervalo que a distracção dos algozes concede ao nosso êxtase na parada. Temos amanhã a guilhotina. Se a não tivéssemos amanhã tê-la-íamos depois de amanhã. Passeemos ao sol o repouso antes do fim, ignorantes voluntariamente dos propósitos e dos prosseguimentos. O sol dourará nossas frontes sem rugas e a brisa terá frescura para quem deixar de esperar1.","Not to be subordinated to anything - not to a man, not to a love, not to an idea, to have that distant independence which consists in not believing in the truth, nor, if there were any, in the usefulness of knowing it - such is the state in which that, it seems to me, the intimate intellectual life of those who do not live without thinking must take place within themselves. Belonging—this is banality. Creed, ideal, woman or profession—all these are the cell and the shackles. To be is to be free. The same ambition, if we are proud that it is, is a burden, we would not be proud if we understood that it is a string by which we are pulled. No: no connections with us! Free from ourselves as from others, contemplatives without ecstasy, thinkers without conclusion, we will live, freed from God, the small interval that the distraction of the executioners grants to our ecstasy in the parade. We have the guillotine tomorrow. If we didn't have it tomorrow we would have it the day after tomorrow. Let us spend repose in the sun before the end, willfully ignorant of the purposes and the pursuits. The sun will gild our foreheads without wrinkles and the breeze will have freshness for those who stop waiting1.","The absence of a true God has become the empty corpse of the vast sky and the closed soul. Infinite prison, because you are infinite no one can escape you! 328 [after 18 Oct 1931] Just as, whether we know it or not, we all have a metaphysics, so also, whether we like or not, we all have a morality. I have a very simple morality — to do neither good nor evil to anyone. To do no evil because I not only recognize in others the same right I believe myself to have, which is not to be bothered by them, but also because I think there are enough natural evils in the world without my adding to them. In this world we’re all travelers on the same ship that has set sail from one unknown port en route to another equally foreign to us; we should treat each other, therefore, with the friendliness due to fellow travelers.","To submit to nothing, whether to a man or a love or an idea, and to have the aloof independence of not believing in the truth or even (if it existed) in the usefulness of knowing it – this seems to me the right attitude for the intellectual inner life of those who can’t live without thinking. To belong is synonymous with banality. Creeds, ideals, a woman, a profession – all are prisons and shackles. To be is to be free. Even ambition, if we take pride in it, is a hindrance; we wouldn’t be proud of it if we realized it’s a string by which we’re pulled. No: no ties even to ourselves! Free from ourselves as well as from others, contemplatives without ecstasy, thinkers without conclusions and liberated from God, we will live the few moments of bliss allowed us in the prison yard by the distraction of our executioners. Tomorrow we will face the guillotine. Or if not tomorrow, then the day after. Let us stroll about in the sun before the end comes, deliberately forgetting all projects and pursuits. Without wrinkles our foreheads will glow in the sun, and the breeze will be cool for those who quit hoping."

In this hour of the senses stagnating and everything seems to me something else — my sensations a confused and lucid error, I spread wings but I don't move, like a supposed condor.","The storm that was threatening the uneasy calm has finally passed over, and three consecutive days of unending heat have brought to the lucid surface of things a tepid but delicious coolness. Much the same thing happens when, in the course of living, the soul, weighed down by life, feels the burden suddenly and inexplicably lift.","From the terrace of this café I look at life with tremulous eyes. I see just a little of its vast diversity concentrated in this square that’s all mine. A slight daze like the beginning of drunkenness reveals to me the soul of things.

In this moment when my feelings are but a lucid and confused mistake, when my senses have stagnated and everything seems like something else, I spread my wings without moving, like an imaginary condor."

But it seems to me that for me, or for those who feel like me, the artificial has become the natural, and it is the natural that is strange. I don't say it well: the artificial did not become the natural; the natural became different. I dispense with and hate vehicles, I dispense with and hate the products of science — telephones, telegraphs — which make life easy, or the by-products of fantasy — gramophonographs, radio receivers — which, for those whom they amuse, make it fun.","The phrase still fills my whole soul, I rest every emotion I have on it, and the indecipherable peace of the harsh moonlight beginning to spread as night comes falls on me, in me, as it does on the city beyond.","I don’t know if it happens only to me or to everyone who, through civilization, has been born a second time. But for me, and perhaps for other people like me, it seems that what’s artificial has become natural, and what’s natural is now strange.

I’ve never been able to feel envious of such people. I always felt that virtue lay in getting what lay beyond one’s reach, in living where you were not, in being more alive when dead than when alive, in achieving, in short, something difficult, something absurd, in overleaping — like an obstacle — the obstinate reality of the world. If I were told that there is no pleasure to be had in enduring after you have ceased to exist, I would answer, firstly, that I don’t know if that’s true or not, because I don’t know what happens after death; I would then say that the pleasure of future fame is a present pleasure — it’s the fame that is future.","To create in myself a nation with its own politics, parties and revolutions, and to be all of it, everything, to be God in the real pantheism of this people-I, to be the substance and movement of their bodies and their souls, of the very ground they tread and the acts they perform!

Tropeço nos sentimentos reais dos outros, o antagonismo dos seus psiquismos com o meu entala-me e entaramela-me os passos, escorrego e destrambelho-me por entre e por sobre o som das suas palavras estranhas a ser ouvido em mim, o apoio forte e certo dos seus passos no chão actual, os seus gestos que existem verdadeiramente, os seus vários1 e complexos modos de serem outras pessoas que não variantes da minha.","Like someone whose eyes, raised from a long ▢ of a book, receive the violence for them from a mere bright natural sun, if I sometimes lift my eyes from me to see me, it hurts and burns me to look at me. the sharpness and independence-from-me of clearly external life, of the existence of others, of the position and correlation of movements in space. I trip over the real feelings of others, the antagonism of their psyches with mine snags me and scrambles my steps, I slip and fall apart between and over the sound of their strange words being heard in me, the strong support and certain of their steps on the current floor, their gestures that truly exist, their various1 and complex ways of being other people than variants of mine.","and I weep real tears, hot tears, the tears of those who do not have or never had a mother; and my eyes, burning with those dead tears, burn too inside my heart. Perhaps the nostalgia that comes from never having been someone’s son has contributed to my emotional indifference. The person who clasped me to her when I was a child could not truly clasp me to her heart. The one person who could have done that was far away, laid in a tomb — the mother who would have been mine, had Fate wished it so.","Like someone whose eyes, when lifted up after staring at a book for a long time, wince at the mere sight of a naturally bright sun, so too, when I lift my eyes from looking at myself, it hurts and stings me to see the vivid clarity and independence-from-me of the world outside, of the existence of others, of the position and correlation of movements in space. I stumble on the real feelings of others. The antagonism of their psyches towards mine shoves me and trips up my steps. I slide and tumble above and between the sounds of their strange words in my ears, the hard and definite falling of their feet on the actual floor, their motions that really exist, their various and complex ways of being persons who are not mere variants of my own."

"Há metáforas que são mais reais do que a gente que anda na rua. Há imagens nos recantos de livros que vivem mais nitidamente que muito homem e muita mulher. Há frases literárias que têm uma individualidade absolutamente humana. Passos de parágrafos meus há que me arrefecem de pavor, tão nitidamente gente eu os sinto, tão recortados de encontro aos muros do meu quarto, na noite, na sombra, ▢. Tenho escrito frases cujo som, lidas alto ou baixo — é impossível ocultar-lhes o som — é absolutamente o de uma coisa que ganhou exterioridade absoluta e alma inteiramente.","There are metaphors that are more real than people walking down the street. There are images in the corners of books that live more clearly than many men and women. There are literary phrases that have an absolutely human individuality. There are passages in my paragraphs that chill me with dread, I feel them so clearly people, so cut out against the walls of my room, in the night, in the shadows, ▢. I have written sentences whose sound, read aloud or low — it is impossible to hide the sound from them — is absolutely that of a thing that has gained absolute exteriority and an entirely soul.","It might well be illusory, but even if it is, it lasts longer than the pleasure of enjoying only what is here. The American millionaire cannot expect posterity to appreciate his poems, because he hasn’t written any; the traveling salesman cannot expect the future to take delight in his paintings, because he didn’t paint any. On the other hand, I, who am nothing in this transitory life, can savor the vision of the future reading this page, because I am actually writing it; I can pride myself, as if it were a child, on the fame I will enjoy, because I do at least have the means to achieve that fame.","There are metaphors more real than the people who walk in the street. There are images tucked away in books that live more vividly than many men and women. There are phrases from literary works that have a positively human personality. There are passages from my own writings that chill me with fright, so distinctly do I feel them as people, so sharply outlined do they appear against the walls of my room, at night, in the shadows ..... I’ve written sentences whose sound, read out loud or silently (impossible to hide their sound), can only be of something that has acquired absolute exteriority and a full-fledged soul."
"Com um ruído soturno e aproximando-se o navio entre as águas, a saleta escurece lividamente, e não morreu, não está preso algures, não sei o que [é] feito dele — do príncipe — que gélida coisa desconhecida lhe é o destino agora?…","With a gloomy noise and the ship approaching through the waters, the room is lividly darkened, and he has not died, he is not imprisoned somewhere, I do not know what has become of him - of the prince - what a cold unknown thing is his fate now ?…","Yes, any part of it is enough to console me. A ray of sunlight falling endlessly into the dead office; a street cry that soars up to the window of my room; the existence of people, of climates and changes in the weather; the terrifying objectivity of the world …","As the ship draws near with a sullen sound, the room lividly darkens, and he didn’t die, nor is he captive, but I don’t know what has become of him, the prince. What cold and unknown thing is his destiny now?"

"A sensação era exactamente idêntica àquela que nos assalta perante alguém que dorme. Tudo o que dorme é criança de novo. Talvez porque no sono não se possa fazer mal, e se não dá conta da vida, o maior criminoso, o mais fechado egoísta é sagrado, por uma magia natural, enquanto dorme. Entre matar quem dorme e matar uma criança não conheço diferença que se sinta.","The sensation was exactly the same as that which assails us in front of someone who is sleeping. Everything that sleep is a child again. Perhaps because in sleep you can't do harm, and if you don't take care of life, the greatest criminal, the most closed selfish is sacred, by a natural magic, while he sleeps. Between killing a sleeping person and killing a child I don't know any difference to be felt.",I think what creates in me the deep sense I have of living out of step with others is the fact that most people think with their feelings whereas I feel with my thoughts.,"I had the same sensation as when we watch someone sleep. When asleep we all become children again. Perhaps because in the state of slumber we can do no wrong and are unconscious of life, the greatest criminal and the most self-absorbed egotist are holy, by a natural magic, as long as they’re sleeping. For me there’s no discernible difference between killing a child and killing a sleeping man."

"É curioso de onde, afinal, eu conhecia a figura. No escritório há, no canto do fundo, um calendário idêntico, que tenho visto muitas vezes. Mas, por um mistério, ou oleográfico ou meu, a idêntica do escritório não tem olhos com pena. É só uma oleografia. (É de papel que brilha e dorme por cima da cabeça do Alves canhoto o seu viver de esbatimento.)","It's curious where, after all, I knew the figure from. In the office there is, in the back corner, an identical calendar, which I have seen many times. But, by a mystery, either oleographic or mine, the identical one in the office doesn't have pitying eyes. It's just an oleography. (It is made of paper that shines and sleeps over the head of the left-handed Alves, his life of fading.)","Oddly enough, I do already know that figure. There’s an identical calendar, which I’ve often seen, in the office, in a corner at the back. But by some mystery, to do with both the lithograph and me, the calendar in the office doesn’t have sad eyes. It’s just a lithograph. (It’s printed on shiny paper and sleeps away its dull life above the head of Alves, the left-handed clerk.)","Funny where I knew that figure from. In the corner at the back of the office there’s an identical calendar which I’ve seen countless times, but due to some lithographic mystery, or some mystery of my own, the eyes of the office copy express no sorrow. It’s just a lithograph. (Printed on glossy paper, it sleeps away its subdued life above the head of left-handed Alves.)"
"Atiro com a caixa de fósforos, que está vazia, para o abismo que a rua é para além do parapeito da minha janela alta sem sacada. Ergo-me na cadeira e escuto. Nitidamente, como significasse qualquer coisa, a caixa de fósforos vazia soa na rua que me declara deserta. Não há mais som nenhum, salvo os da cidade inteira. Sim, os da cidade dum domingo inteiro — tantos, sem se entenderem, e todos certos.","I throw the matchbox, which is empty, into the abyss that the street is beyond the sill of my high window without a balcony. I rise in my chair and listen. Clearly, as if to signify anything, the empty matchbox sounds in the street that declares me deserted. There's no more sound, save for the entire city. Yes, the townspeople for an entire Sunday — so many, without understanding each other, and all right.","I toss an empty matchbox out into the abyss that is the street beyond the sill of my high window. I sit up in my chair and listen. As if the fact were significant, the empty matchbox sends back a clear echo telling me the street is deserted. There is no sound apart from the sounds made by the entire city. Yes, the sounds of the entire city — so many indecipherable sounds and each in its way right.","I throw an empty matchbox towards the abyss that’s the street beyond the sill of my high window without balcony. I sit up in my chair and listen. Distinctly, as if it meant something, the empty matchbox resounds on the street, declaring to me its desertedness. Not another sound can be heard, except the sounds of the whole city. Yes, the sounds of the city on this long Sunday – so many, all at odds, and all of them right."
"Que curioso deve ser o folclore do colorido povo dos painéis! Os amores das figuras bordadas — amores de duas dimensões, duma castidade geométrica — devem ser ▢ para entretenimento dos psicólogos ousados.","How curious must be the folklore of the colorful people of the panels! The loves of embroidered figures — loves of two dimensions, of a geometric chastity — must be ▢ for the entertainment of daring psychologists.","Everything I see is, for me, the purely visible, be it the vast blue, green-tinged sky of the coming morning, be it the false grimace of pain on the face of someone watching the death of a loved one and aware that he is being watched.","Just imagine the folklore of the colourful people who inhabit paintings! The loves of embroidered figures – loves marked by a two-dimensional, geometric chastity – should be [probed] for the entertainment of venturesome psychologists."
"Em que barco fiz essa viagem? No vapor Qualquer. Rides. Eu também, e de vós talvez. Quem vos diz, e a mim, que não escrevo símbolos para os deuses compreenderem?","What boat did I take this trip on? On Steam Any. rides. Me too, and you maybe. Who tells you and me that I don't write symbols for the gods to understand?",,"On what ship did I make this voyage? On the steamer Whichever. You laugh.

"Todo o prazer é um vício, porque buscar o prazer é o que todos fazem na vida, e o único vício negro é fazer o que toda a gente faz.","All pleasure is an addiction, because seeking pleasure is what everyone does in life, and the only black vice is doing what everyone else does.","I’ve often wanted to cross the river, the ten minutes it takes to go from Terreiro do Paço to Cacilhas.","Every pleasure is a vice, because to seek pleasure is what everyone does in life, and the only black vice is to do what everyone else does."
"Pesa-me, aliás, toda a ideia de ser forçado a um contacto com outrem. Um simples convite para jantar com um amigo me produz uma angústia difícil de definir. A ideia de uma obrigação social qualquer — ir a um enterro, tratar junto de alguém de uma coisa do escritório, ir esperar à estação uma pessoa qualquer, conhecida ou desconhecida —, só essa ideia me estorva os pensamentos de um dia, e às vezes é desde a mesma véspera que me preocupo, e durmo mal, e o caso real, quando se dá, é absolutamente insignificante, não justifica nada; e o caso repete-se e eu não aprendo nunca a aprender.","In fact, the whole idea of being forced into contact with another weighs heavily on me. A simple invitation to dinner with a friend produces an anguish that is difficult to define. The idea of some kind of social obligation—going to a funeral, dealing with someone in the office, going to the station to wait for some person, known or unknown—this idea alone gets in the way of the thoughts of a day, and sometimes it's been the day before that I've been worried, and I've slept badly, and the real case, when it happens, is absolutely insignificant, it doesn't justify anything; and the case repeats itself and I never learn to learn.","The phrase still fills my whole soul, I rest every emotion I have on it, and the indecipherable peace of the harsh moonlight beginning to spread as night comes falls on me, in me, as it does on the city beyond.","The mere thought of having to enter into contact with someone else makes me nervous. A simple invitation to have dinner with a friend produces an anguish in me that’s hard to define. The idea of any social obligation whatsoever – attending a funeral, dealing with someone about an office matter, going to the station to wait for someone I know or don’t know – the very idea disturbs my thoughts for an entire day, and sometimes I even start worrying the night before, so that I sleep badly. When it takes place, the dreaded encounter is utterly insignificant, justifying none of my anxiety, but the next time is no different: I never learn to learn."
"Um frio desassossegado põe mãos gélidas em torno ao meu pobre coração.

The gray hours and ▢ lengthen, flatten out in time; the moments drag.","Everyone has always treated me kindly.

The grey hours get longer, flattening out in time; the moments drag."

"Quantas vezes, sob o peso de um tédio que parece ser loucura, ou de uma angústia que parece passar além dela, paro, hesitante, antes que me revolte, hesito, parando, antes que me divinize. Dor de não saber o que é o mistério do mundo, dor de nos não amarem, dor de serem injustos connosco, dor de pesar a vida sobre nós, sufocando e prendendo, dor de dentes, dor de sapatos apertados — quem pode dizer qual é maior em si mesmo, quanto mais nos outros, ou na generalidade dos que existem?","How many times, under the weight of a boredom that seems to be madness, or an anguish that seems to pass beyond it, I stop, hesitating, before I revolt, I hesitate, stopping, before I divinize myself. Pain of not knowing what the mystery of the world is, pain of not loving us, pain of being unfair to us, pain of weighing life upon us, choking and holding, toothache, pain from tight shoes — who can say what it is. greater in itself, let alone in others, or in the generality of those that exist?","The pain of not understanding the mystery of life, the pain of being unloved, the pain of others’ injustice to us, the pain of life crushing us, suffocating and imprisoning us, the pain of toothache, of pinching shoes — who can say which pain he finds the worse, let alone which is worse for others, or worse for others in general?","How often, oppressed by a tedium that seems like insanity or by an anxiety that seems to surpass it, I stop, hesitating, before I revolt, I hesitate, stopping, before I deify myself. From among all the pains there are – the pain of not grasping the mystery of the world, the pain of not being loved, the pain of being treated unjustly, the pain of life oppressing us, suffocating and restraining us, the pain of a toothache, the pain of shoes that pinch – who can say which is the worst for himself, let alone for someone else, or for the generality of those who exist?"
"Suponho, porém, que nisto tudo sou translato, que a saudade que sinto não é bem minha, nem bem abstracta, mas a emoção interceptada de não sei que terceiro, a quem estas emoções, que em mim são literárias, fossem — di-lo-ia Vieira — literais. É na minha suposição de sentir que me magoo e angustio, e as saudades, a cuja sensação se me mareiam os olhos próprios, é por imaginação e outridade que as penso e sinto.","I suppose, however, that in all of this I am translated, that the nostalgia I feel is not quite mine, not quite abstract, but the emotion intercepted by I don't know what third party, to whom these emotions, which in me are literary, were—says it. -ia Vieira — literals. It is in my assumption of feeling that I am hurt and anguished, and the nostalgia, whose sensation my own eyes are filled with, is by imagination and otherness that I think and feel.","I suppose, though, that I am merely a vehicle for all this and that the longing I feel is neither truly mine nor truly abstract, but the intercepted emotion of some unknown third party for whom these emotions, which in me are literary, would be — as Vieira would say — literal. My hurt and anguish come from my imagined feelings, and it is only in my imagination and my sense of otherness that I think and feel this nostalgia, which nevertheless leaves my own eyes awash with tears.","I suspect, however, that all of this is vicarious, that the nostalgia I feel isn’t truly mine or truly abstract but is the emotion intercepted from an unidentified third party, for whom these emotions, which in me are literary, are – as Vieira* would say – literal. Conjectured feelings are what grieve and torment me, and the nostalgia that makes my eyes well with tears is conceived and felt through imagination and projection."
"Sigo o curso dos meus sonhos, fazendo das imagens degraus para outras imagens; desdobrando, como um leque, as metáforas casuais em grandes quadros de visão interna; desato de mim a vida, e ponho-a de banda como a um traje que aperta. Oculto-me entre árvores longe das estradas. Perco-me. E logro, por momentos que correm levemente, esquecer o gosto à vida, deixar ir-se a ideia de luz e de bulício e acabar conscientemente, absurdamente pelas sensações fora, com um império de ruínas angustiadas, e uma entrada entre pendões e tambores de vitória numa grande cidade final onde não choraria nada, nem desejaria nada e nem a mim próprio pediria o ser.","I follow the course of my dreams, making images stepping stones to other images; fanning out the casual metaphors into large pictures of inner vision; I untie my life, and I put it aside like a garment that tightens. I hide between trees away from the roads. I lose myself. And I manage, for moments that pass lightly, to forget the taste for life, to let go of the idea of light and hustle and to end up consciously, absurdly for the sensations outside, with an empire of anguished ruins, and an entrance between banners and drums of victory in a great final city where I wouldn't cry anything, I wouldn't want anything and I wouldn't even ask myself to be.",,"Yes, this is my role as a stagnator of life, chiseller of inaccuracies, sick pageboy of my soul and Queen, reading to her at twilight not the poems from the book of my Life that lies open on my knees, but the poems that I invent and pretend to read, and that she pretends to hear, while somewhere and somehow the Evening is softening – over this metaphor raised up in me into Absolute Reality – the last hazy light of a mysterious spiritual day."
"Disseram-me, mais tarde, que minha mãe era bonita, e dizem que, quando mo disseram, eu não disse nada. Era já apto de corpo e alma, desentendido de emoções, e o falarem ainda não era uma notícia de outras páginas difíceis de imaginar.","I was told later that my mother was beautiful, and they say that when I was told I didn't say anything. He was already fit in body and soul, misunderstanding of emotions, and the talk was not yet a news of other pages difficult to imagine.","I don’t scrutinize them because, as in games of patience, the cards have no value in themselves. I unwind myself like a length of multicolored yarn, or make cat’s cradles out of myself, like the ones children weave around stiff fingers and pass from one to the other.","They told me later on that my mother was pretty, and they say that, when they told me, I made no comment. I was already fit in body and soul, but ignorant about emotions, and people’s speech was not yet news from other, hard-to-imagine pages."
"E assim nós morremos a nossa vida, tão atentos separadamente a morrê-la que não reparámos que éramos um só, que cada um de nós era uma ilusão do outro, e cada um, dentro de si, o mero eco do seu próprio ser…","And so we died our life, so intent on dying it separately that we didn't notice that we were one, that each of us was an illusion of the other, and each, within himself, the mere echo of his own being...",,"And thus we died our life, so individually intent on dying it that we never noticed that we were only one, that we were each an illusion of the other, and that each of us – as a separate self – was nothing on the inside but an echo of that self…"
"Senti imediatamente a inutilidade da vida. Ver, sentir, lembrar, esquecer — tudo isso se me confundiu, numa vaga dor nos cotovelos, com o murmúrio incerto da rua próxima e os pequenos ruídos do trabalho sossegado no escritório quedo.","I immediately felt the futility of life. Seeing, feeling, remembering, forgetting—all this confused me, in a vague pain in my elbows, with the uncertain murmur of the nearby street and the small noises of quiet work in the quiet office.","I had an immediate sense of the meaninglessness of life. Seeing, feeling, remembering, forgetting were all one, all mixed up with a slight ache in my elbows, the fragmented murmurings from the street below and the faint sounds of steady work going on in the quiet office.","I immediately felt how futile life is. As if prompted by a dull pain in my elbows, everything I was seeing, feeling, remembering and forgetting merged with the faint din from the street and the slight sounds of work as usual in the quiet office."
"Quem sabe se sonhando-te eu não te crio, real noutra realidade; se não serás minha ali, num outro e puro mundo, onde sem corpo táctil nos amemos, com outro jeito de abraços e outras atitudes essenciais de posse? Quem sabe mesmo se não existias já e não te criei mas te vi apenas, com outra visão, interior e pura, num outro e perfeito mundo? Quem sabe se o meu sonhar-te não foi o encontrar-te simplesmente, se o meu amar-te não foi o pensar-em-ti11, se o meu desprezo pela carne e o meu nojo pelo amor não foram a obscura ânsia com que, ignorando-te, te esperava, e a vaga aspiração com que, desconhecendo-te, te queria?","Who knows if dreaming of you I don't create you, real in another reality; if you won't be mine there, in another and pure world, where without a tactile body we love each other, with another way of hugs and other essential attitudes of possession? Who knows even if you didn't already exist and I didn't create you but I only saw you, with another vision, interior and pure, in another and perfect world? Who knows if my dreaming of you wasn't simply finding you, if my loving you wasn't thinking-of-you, if my contempt for the flesh and my disgust for love weren't the obscure yearning with which ignoring you, I was waiting for you, and the vague aspiration with which, not knowing you, I wanted you?",,"Perhaps by dreaming you I create you, real in some other reality; perhaps it is there that you are mine, in a different, pure world where we love each other without tangible bodies, with another kind of embrace and other, ideal forms of possessing. Perhaps I didn’t create you; perhaps you already existed and I merely saw you with a different kind of vision – pure and inner – in another, perfect world. Perhaps my dreaming of you was simply my finding you, and my loving you merely my thinking of you. Perhaps my contempt for the flesh and my loathing of love were the obscure desire with which, unaware of your existence, I waited for you; perhaps they were my uncertain hope by which, without knowing you, I already loved you."
"Atiro a caneta pela secretária fora e ela rola, regressando, sem que eu a apanhe, pelo declive onde trabalho. Senti tudo de repente. E a minha alegria manifesta-se por este gesto da raiva que não sinto.","I throw the pen across the desk and it rolls back, without me picking it up, down the slope where I work. I felt everything suddenly. And my joy is manifested by this gesture of anger that I don't feel.","And I choose to do no good because I don’t know what good is, nor whether I really am doing good when I think I am. How am I to know what evils I may cause when I give alms, or if I attempt to educate or instruct?",I throw my pen against the slanted desk top and watch it roll down without bothering to catch it. I felt all of this without warning. And my happiness consists in this gesture of rage that I don’t feel.
"Sou uma espécie de carta de jogar, de naipe antigo e incógnito, restando única do baralho perdido. Não tenho sentido, não sei do meu valor, não tenho a que me compare para que me encontre, não tenho a que sirva para que me conheça. E assim, em imagens sucessivas em que me descrevo — não sem verdade, mas com mentiras —, vou ficando mais nas imagens do que em mim, dizendo-me até não ser, escrevendo com a alma como tinta, útil para mais nada do que para se escrever com ela. Mas cessa a reacção, e de novo me resigno. Volto em mim ao que sou, ainda que seja nada. E alguma coisa de lágrimas sem choro arde nos meus olhos hirtos, alguma coisa de angústia que não houve me empola asperamente a garganta seca. Mas aí, nem sei o que chorara, se houvesse chorado, nem por que foi que o não chorei. A ficção acompanha-me, como a minha sombra. E o que quero1 é dormir.","I'm a kind of playing card, old and unknown, the only one left in the lost deck. I have no meaning, I don't know my worth, I don't have anything to compare me to so that you can find me, I don't have anything to use for you to get to know me. And so, in successive images in which I describe myself — not without truth, but with lies — I remain more in the images than in myself, telling myself until I am not, writing with my soul like ink, useful for nothing more than to write with her. But the reaction ceases, and I resign myself again. I return in myself to what I am, even if it is nothing. And something of tears without tears burns in my stiff eyes, something of anguish that hasn't been there blisters my dry throat roughly. But then, I don't even know what I would have cried, if I had cried, or why I didn't cry. Fiction accompanies me, like my shadow. And what I want is sleep.","I’m like a playing card that belongs to some ancient and unknown suit, the only remnant of a lost pack. I have no meaning, I do not know my value, I have nothing to compare myself with in order to find myself, I have no purpose in life by which to know myself. And thus, in the successive images I use to describe myself — not untruthful but not truthful either — I become more image than me, talking myself out of existence, using my soul as ink, whose sole purpose is to write. But that reaction fades and I resign myself again. I return to myself as I am, even though that is nothing. And something like dry tears burns in my staring eyes; something like a never-felt anxiety catches in my dry throat. But, alas, I don’t know what I would have wept for if I had cried, nor why it was I did not weep. The fiction cleaves as close to me as my shadow. All I dream of is to sleep.","I’m like a playing card belonging to an old and unrecognizable suit – the sole survivor of a lost deck. I have no meaning , I don’t know my worth , there’s nothing I can compare myself with to discover what I am, and to make such a discovery would be of no use to anyone. And so, describing myself in image after image – not without truth, but with lies mixed in – I end up more in the images than in me, stating myself until I no longer exist, writing with my soul for ink, useful for nothing except writing. But the reaction ceases, and again I resign myself. I go back to whom I am, even if it’s nothing. And a hint of tears that weren’t cried makes my stiff eyes burn; a hint of anguish that wasn’t felt gets caught in my dry throat. But I don’t even know what I would have cried over, if I’d cried, nor why it is that I didn’t cry over it. The fiction follows me, like my shadow. And what I want is to sleep."
"O homem vulgar, por mais dura que lhe seja a vida, tem ao menos a felicidade de a não pensar.

"O amor, o sono, as drogas e intoxicantes, são formas elementares da arte, ou, antes, de produzir o mesmo efeito que ela. Mas amor, sono e drogas tem cada um a sua desilusão. O amor farta ou desilude. Do sono desperta-se, e, quando se dormiu, não se viveu. As drogas pagam-se com a ruína de aquele mesmo físico que serviram de estimular. Mas na arte não há desilusão porque a ilusão foi admitida desde o princípio. Da arte não há despertar, porque nela não dormimos, embora sonhássemos. Na arte não há tributo ou multa que paguemos por ter gozado dela.","Love, sleep, drugs and intoxicants are elementary forms of art, or rather of producing the same effect. But love, sleep and drugs each have their disillusionment. Love is full or disappoints. One wakes up from sleep, and when one has slept, one has not lived. Drugs are paid for with the ruin of that very physique they served to stimulate. But in art there is no disillusionment because the illusion was admitted from the beginning. From art there is no awakening, because in it we do not sleep, although we dream. In art there is no tribute or fine that we pay for having enjoyed it.","I’m almost convinced now that I’m never truly awake. I’m not sure if it’s that I don’t dream when I live, or don’t live when I dream, or if dreaming and living commingle and overlap in me and out of that interpenetration is formed my conscious being. Sometimes, right in the middle of my active life, when I’m evidently as clear about myself as anyone else is, a strange feeling of doubt enters my imagination; I do not know if I exist, it seems possible to me that I might be someone else’s dream; the idea occurs to me, with an almost carnal reality, that I might be a character in a novel, moving through the long waves of someone else’s literary style, through the created truth of a great narrative. I’ve often noticed that certain characters in novels take on for us an importance that our acquaintances and friends, who talk and listen to us in the real and visible world, could never have.","Love, sleep, drugs and intoxicants are elementary forms of art, or rather, of producing the same effect as art. But love, sleep and drugs all have their disillusion. Love wearies or disappoints. We wake up from sleep, and while sleeping we haven’t lived. And we pay for drugs with the ruin of the very body they served to stimulate. But in art there is no disillusion, since illusion is accepted from the start. There’s no waking up from art, because we dream but don’t sleep in it. Nor do we pay a tax or penalty for having enjoyed art."
"Num intervalo de indolência cheguei à janela aberta do escritório — o calor a fizera abrir, a chuva não a fizera fechar — e contemplei com a atenção intensa e indiferente, que é o meu modo, aquilo mesmo que acabo de descrever com justeza antes de o ter visto. Sim, lá ia a alegria aos dois banais, falando a sorrir pela chuva miúda, com passos mais rápidos que apressados, na claridade limpa do dia que se velara.","In an interval of indolence I arrived at the open window of the study — the heat had made it open, the rain had not made it close — and I contemplated with the intense and indifferent attention, which is my way, the very thing that I have justly described before have seen. Yes, there was the joy of the two banal men, talking smiling through the light rain, with quicker than hurried steps, in the clear clarity of the day that had been veiled.","In an idle moment I went over to the open window in the office — it had been opened because of the heat and left open when the rain came — and looking out at the scene with my usual mixture of intense and indifferent attentiveness, I saw exactly the scene I had described even before I had seen it. Sure enough, there was joy walking down the street in the guise of two ordinary men, talking and smiling in the fine rain, not hurrying, just strolling briskly through the clean clarity of the darkening day.","During an idle moment I walked over to the open office window – the heat had caused it to be opened, but the rain hadn’t caused it to be shut – and looked with intense and indifferent concentration, as is my custom, at what I just finished accurately describing before I saw it. Yes, there went the joy of two banal souls, smiling as they talked in the fine rain, walking more briskly than hurriedly in the veiled yet luminous, limpid day."
"Quantas horas tenho passado em convívio secreto com a ideia de si! Temo-nos amado tanto, dentro dos meus sonhos! Mas mesmo aí, eu lho juro, nunca me sonhei possuindo-a. Sou um delicado e um casto mesmo nos meus sonhos. Respeito até a ideia5 de uma mulher bela.","How many hours have I spent in secret living with the idea of you! We have loved each other so much, within my dreams! But even then, I swear to you, I never dreamed of possessing her. I am gentle and chaste even in my dreams. I even respect the idea5 of a beautiful woman.",,"It’s not a case of what psychiatrists call psychic onanism, nor is it what they term erotomania. I don’t fantasize, as in psychic onanism; I don’t imagine myself as a carnal lover or even as a casual friend of the person I gaze at and remember. Nor, as in erotomania, do I idealize and remove the person from the concretely aesthetic sphere; I don’t think about or desire anything more from the person than what I receive from my eyes and from the pure, direct memory of what my eyes have seen. THE VISUAL LOVER(II) And I avoid spinning webs of fantasy around the figures I contemplate to entertain myself."
"Três dias seguidos de calor sem calma, tempestade latente no mal-estar da quietude de tudo, vieram trazer, porque a tempestade se escoasse para outro ponto, um leve fresco morno e grato à superfície lúcida das coisas. Assim às vezes, neste decurso da vida, a alma, que sofreu porque a vida lhe pesou, sente subitamente um alívio, sem que se desse nela o que o explicasse.","Three days in a row of heat without calm, a tempest latent in the uneasiness of the stillness of everything, came to bring, because the storm drained to another point, a slight warm and grateful freshness to the lucid surface of things. So sometimes, in this course of life, the soul, which has suffered because life has weighed on it, suddenly feels a relief, without being given anything to explain it.","Unknowingly, I have been a witness to the gradual wasting away of my life, to the slow shipwreck of everything I ever wanted to be.","During three straight days of heat without let-up, a storm lurked in the anxious stillness until finally drifting elsewhere, and then a gentle, almost cool warmth arrived to soothe the bright surface of things. So too, it sometimes happens in life that a soul weighed down by living suddenly feels relief, for no apparent reason."
"Hoje, mais demorada do que nunca, veio a Morte vender ao meu limiar. Diante de mim, mais demorada do que nunca, desdobrou os tapetes, as sedas, e os damascos, do seu esquecimento e da sua consolação. Sorria deles, por elogio, e não se importando que eu a visse1. Mas quando eu me tentava por comprar, falou-me que não os vendia. Não viera para que eu quisesse o que me mostrava2; mas para que, por o que mostrava3, a quisesse a ela. E, dos seus tapetes, disse-me que eram os que se gozavam4 no seu palácio longínquo; das suas sedas, que outras se não trajavam no seu castelo na5 sombra; dos seus damascos, que melhores ainda eram os que cobriam, toalhas, os retábulos da sua estância para além do mundo.","Today, longer than ever, Death came to sell at my threshold. Before me, longer than ever, she unfolded the rugs, silks, and damasks of her forgetfulness and her consolation. Smile at them, out of praise, and not caring that I see her. But when I tried to buy them, he told me he didn't sell them. He hadn't come to make me want what he was showing me; but so that, for what he showed, he wanted her. And from his rugs, he told me that they were the ones who made fun of each other in his distant palace; of their silks, which others were not dressed in their castle in the shade; of his damasks, which even better were the ones that covered, tablecloths, the altarpieces of his place beyond the world.",,"Today Death, tarrying longer than ever, came to sell at my doorstep. Slower than ever, she unfolded before me the rugs, silks and linens of her oblivion and her consolation. She smiled with satisfaction at the things she showed, without caring that I saw her smile. But as soon as I felt tempted to buy them, she said they weren’t for sale. She hadn’t come to make me want the things she showed but, through those things, to make me want her. The rugs, she said, were the kind that graced her far-away palace; the silks were the same ones worn in her castle of darkness; and even better linens than what she had showed me draped the altarpieces of her abode in the nether world."
"E eu ofereço-te este livro porque sei que ele é belo e inútil. Nada ensina, nada faz crer, nada faz sentir. Regato que corre para um abismo-cinza que o vento espalha e nem fecunda nem é daninho ▢ — pus toda a alma em fazê-lo, mas não pensei nele fazendo-o, mas só em mim que sou triste e em ti que não és ninguém.","And I offer you this book because I know it is beautiful and useless. Nothing teaches, nothing makes you believe, nothing makes you feel. Stream that flows into a gray abyss that the wind scatters and neither fertilizes nor is harmful ▢ — I put all my soul into doing it, but I did not think of him doing it, but only of me who am sad and of you who are not nobody.",,"And an exquisite exhaustion tinged with disquiet and melancholy evokes the complex sensation of anguish that our pleasures arouse, in the thought that they will vanish, as well as the melancholy pre-weariness we feel in our sensual delights, when we think of the weariness they’ll bring. There is a third method for subtilizing pains into pleasures and for making doubts and worries into a soft bed. It consists in intensely concentrating on our anxieties and sufferings, making them so fiercely felt that by their very excess they bring the pleasure of excess, while by their violence they suggest the pleasure that hurts for being so pleasurable and the gratification that smacks of blood for having wounded us. This can only happen, of course, in souls dedicated to pleasure by habit and by education. And when, as in me – refiner that I am of fallacious refinements, an architect dedicated to building myself out of sensations subtilized through the intellect, through abdication from life, through analysis and through pain itself –, all three methods are employed simultaneously, when every felt pain (felt so quickly there’s no time for the soul to plan any defence) is automatically analysed to the core, ruthlessly foisted on an extraneous I, and buried in me to the utmost height of pain, then I truly feel like a victor and a hero."

I prefer to be taken seriously as what I am not, ignored humanly, with decency and naturalness.","Scraps of ragged clouds grew still blacker. The sky near the castle was a clear but ominous blue. It was sunny, but not the kind of sun you could enjoy.","I’ve always rejected being understood. To be understood is to prostitute oneself.

"Ergo a cabeça de sobre o papel em que escrevo… É cedo ainda. Mal passa o meio-dia e é domingo. O mal da vida, a doença de ser consciente, entra com o meu próprio corpo e perturba-me. Não haver ilhas para os inconfortáveis, alamedas vetustas, inencontráveis de outros, para os isolados no sonhar! Ter de viver e, por pouco que seja, de agir; ter de roçar pelo facto de haver outra gente, real também, na vida! Ter de estar aqui escrevendo isto, por me ser preciso à alma fazê-lo, e, mesmo isto, não poder sonhá-lo apenas, exprimi-lo sem palavras, sem consciência mesmo, por uma construção de mim próprio em música e esbatimento, de modo que me subissem as lágrimas aos olhos só de me sentir expressar-me, e eu fluísse, como um rio encantado, por lentos declives de mim próprio, cada vez mais para o inconsciente e o Distante, sem sentido nenhum excepto Deus.","I lift my head from the paper I'm writing on… It's still early. Barely past noon and it's Sunday. The evil of life, the disease of being conscious, enters with my own body and disturbs me. There are no islands for the uncomfortable, ancient alleys, unfindable for others, for those isolated in dreaming! Having to live and, however little, to act; having to touch the fact that there are other people, real too, in life! Having to be here writing this, because my soul needs to do it, and even this, not being able to just dream it, to express it without words, without even conscience, through a construction of myself in music and blurring, so that tears would rise in my eyes just to feel myself expressing myself, and I would flow, like an enchanted river, down slow slopes of myself, more and more into the unconscious and the Distant, with no meaning except God.","What does it matter to me if the paper money of my soul can never be converted into gold, since there is no gold in the factitious alchemy of life.","I raise my head from the sheet of paper where I’m writing… It’s early still. It’s just past noon on a Sunday. Life’s basic malady, that of being conscious, begins with my body and discomfits me. To have no islands where those of us who are uncomfortable could go, no ancient garden paths reserved for those who’ve retreated into dreaming! To have to live and to act, however little; to have to physically touch because there are other, equally real people in life! To have to be here writing this, because my soul needs it, and not to be able to just dream it all, to express it without words, without so much as consciousness, through a construction of myself in music and diffuseness, such that tears would well in my eyes as soon as I felt like expressing myself, and I would flow like an enchanted river across gentle slopes of my own self, ever further into unconsciousness and the Far-away, to no end but God."
"Como nunca descobri em mim qualidades que atraíssem alguém, nunca pude acreditar que alguém se sentisse atraído por mim. A opinião seria de uma modéstia estulta, se factos sobre factos — aqueles inesperados factos que eu esperava — a não viessem confirmar sempre.","As I never discovered qualities in myself that attracted someone, I could never believe that someone was attracted to me. The opinion would be foolishly modest, if facts about facts—those unexpected facts I had hoped for—did not always confirm it.",,"I have no other real pleasure besides the analysis of my pain, nor any other sensual delight besides the morbid dribbling of sensations when they crumble and rot – light footsteps in the murky shadows, and we don’t even turn around to find out whose they are; faint songs in the distance, the words of which we don’t try to catch, for we are lulled more by the vagueness of what they’re saying and by the mystery of where they come from; hazy secrets of pallid waters, filling the and nocturnal spaces with ethereal far-aways; bells of distant carriages, and who knows where they’re returning from or what laughs and gaiety they contain, because from here they’re just distant, drowsy carriages in the dull torpor of an afternoon in which summer is giving way to autumn…"
"Amar-me é ter pena de mim. Um dia, lá para o fim do futuro, alguém escreverá sobre mim um poema, e talvez só então eu comece a reinar no meu Reino.","To love me is to pity me.

With the clarity afforded by the lightning flashes of reason that pick out from the thick blackness of life the immediate objects it is composed of, I see with utter lucidity all that is base, flaccid, neglected and factitious in this Rua dos Douradores that makes up my entire life: the squalid office whose squalor seeps into the very marrow of its inhabitants’ bones, the room, rented by the month, in which nothing happens except the living death of its occupant, the grocer’s shop on the corner whose owner I know only in the casual way people do know each other, the boys standing at the door of the old tavern, the laborious futility of each identical day, the same characters constantly rehearsing their roles, like a drama consisting only of scenery and in which even that scenery is facing the wrong way …","To love myself is to feel sorry for myself. Perhaps one day, towards the end of the future, someone will write a poem about me, and I’ll begin to reign in my Kingdom."
"O carro descia lentamente, a caminho das avenidas. À medida que se aproximava do maior aglomeramento das casas, uma sensação de perda tomava-lhe o espírito vagamente. A realidade humana começava a despontar.","The car descended slowly, heading for the avenues. As he approached the largest cluster of houses, a sense of loss vaguely crept into his mind. Human reality was beginning to dawn.","To see is perhaps to dream but if we use the word “see” rather than the word “dream,” it’s because we distinguish between seeing and dreaming.","The tram slowly descended towards the avenues.

Sonhadores felizes são os pessimistas. Formam o mundo à sua imagem e assim sempre conseguem estar em casa.

They shape the world in their image and so they always manage to be at home. What hurts me the most is the difference between the noise and joy of the world and my sadness and my boring silence.,"To consider our greatest anguish an incident of no importance, not just in terms of the life of the universe, but in terms of our own souls, is the beginning of knowledge.","The happy dreamers are the pessimists.

"Várias vezes, no decurso da minha vida opressa por circunstâncias, me tem sucedido, quando quero libertar-me de qualquer grupo delas, ver-me subitamente cercado por outras da mesma ordem, como se houvesse definidamente uma inimizade contra mim na teia incerta das coisas. Arranco do pescoço uma mão que me sufoca. Vejo que na mão, com que a essa arranquei, me veio preso um laço que me caiu no pescoço com o gesto de libertação. Afasto, com cuidado, o laço, e é com as próprias mãos que me quase estrangulo.","Several times, in the course of my life, oppressed by circumstances, it has happened to me, when I want to free myself from any group of them, to find myself suddenly surrounded by others of the same order, as if there were definitely an enmity against me in the uncertain web of things. . I snatch a hand from my neck that suffocates me. I see that in the hand, with which I snatched it, a noose came to me that fell around my neck with the gesture of liberation. I carefully pull back the noose, and it's with my bare hands that I nearly strangle myself.","I can only comprehend the perennial inertia in which I allow my monotonously uneventful life to lie, like a layer of dust or dirt on the surface of a resolute unchangeability, as a lack of personal cleanliness. We should bathe our destinies as we do our bodies, change our lives just as we change our clothes — not to keep ourselves alive, which is why we eat and sleep, but out of the disinterested respect for ourselves which can properly be called cleanliness. There are many people in whom a lack of cleanliness is not an act of will but an intellectual shrug of the shoulders. And there are many people for whom the dullness and sameness of their lives are not what they would have chosen for themselves nor a natural conformity with that lack of choice, but rather a snuffing out of self-knowledge, an automatic irony of the understanding. There are pigs who, however disgusted they may feel at their own filth, fail to remove themselves from it, frozen by the same extremity of feeling that prevents the terrified from removing themselves from the path of danger. There are those, like me, pigs by destiny, who do not attempt to escape the daily banality of life, mesmerized by their own impotence. They are birds fascinated by the absence of the snake; flies who, unaware, hover above the branches until they come within the sticky reach of the chameleon’s tongue. So each day I promenade my conscious unconsciousness along my particular branch of the tree of routine. I promenade my destiny which trots ahead without waiting for me and my time that advances even when I don’t. And the only thing that saves me from the monotony is these brief notes I make about it. I am merely glad that in my cell there are glass panes this side of the bars, and in large letters, in the dust of necessity, I write my daily signature on my contract with death. Did I say my contract with death? No, not even with death. Anyone who lives the way I do does not die: he comes to an end, withers, merely ceases to vegetate. The space he occupied continues to exist without him, the street he walked along remains though he’s no longer seen there, the house where he lived is inhabited by not-him. That is all and we call it nothing; but, were we to put it on, not even this tragedy of denial would be guaranteed applause, for we do not know for certain that it is nothing, we who are as much the vegetables of truth as we are of life, the dust that covers the windowpanes both inside and out, the grandchildren of Destiny and the stepchildren of God, who married Eternal Night when she was left a widow by Chaos, our true father. To leave Rua dos Douradores for the Impossible … To get up from my desk and set off into the Unknown …","Whenever I’ve tried to free my life from a set of the circumstances that continuously oppress it, I’ve been instantly surrounded by other circumstances of the same order, as if the inscrutable web of creation were irrevocably at odds with me. I yank from my neck a hand that was choking me, and I see that my own hand is tied to a noose that fell around my neck when I freed it from the stranger’s hand. When I gingerly remove the noose, it’s with my own hands that I nearly strangle myself."
"Todos têm, como eu, um coração exaltado e triste. Conheço-os bem: uns são moços de lojas, outros são empregados de escritório, outros são comerciantes de pequenos comércios; outros são os vencedores dos cafés e das tascas, gloriosos1 sem saberem no êxtase da palavra egotista, a contento no silêncio do egotismo avaro sem ter que guardar. Mas todos, coitados, são poetas, e arrastam, a meus olhos, como eu aos olhos deles, a igual miséria da nossa comum incongruência. Têm todos, como eu, o futuro no passado.","Everyone has, like me, an exalted and sad heart. I know them well: some are shopkeepers, others are clerks, others are shopkeepers; others are the winners of cafes and taverns, glorious1 without knowing it in the ecstasy of the egotist word, content in the silence of avaricious egotism without having to keep it. But all, poor people, are poets, and they drag, in my eyes, as I do in theirs, the same misery of our common incongruity. They all, like me, have the future in the past.","We are something that happens in the interval of a play; sometimes, through certain doors, we glimpse what may only be the scenery. The whole world is confused, like voices in the night. I’ve just reread these pages, in which I write with a clarity that will last only as long as they last, and I ask myself: What is this, and what is it for? Who am I when I feel? What dies in me when I am me?","Like me, they have an exalted and sad heart. I know them all. Some are shop assistants, others are office workers, and still others are small businessmen. Then there are the conquerors from the bars and cafés, unwittingly sublime in the ecstasy of their self-centred chatter, or content to remain self-centredly silent, with no need to defend what they’re too stingy to say. But they’re all poets, poor devils, who drag past my eyes, as I drag past theirs, the same sorry sight of our common incongruity. They all have, like me, their future in the past."

"Era um feriado incerto, legal e que se não mantinha. Havia sossego e trabalho conjuntos, e eu não tinha que fazer. Tinha-me levantado cedo e tardava em preparar-me para existir. Passeava de um lado ao outro do quarto e sonhava alto coisas sem nexo nem possibilidade — gestos que me esquecera de fazer, ambições impossíveis realizadas sem rumo, conversas firmes e contínuas que, se fossem, teriam sido. E neste devaneio sem grandeza nem calma, neste atardar sem esperança nem fim, gastavam meus passos a manhã livre e as minhas palavras altas, ditas baixo, soavam múltiplas2 no claustro do meu simples isolamento.","It was an uncertain, legal, and unsustainable holiday. There was quiet and joint work, and I didn't have to. I had gotten up early and took a long time to prepare myself to exist.

And in this daydream without grandeur or calm, in this delay without hope or end, my steps spent the free morning and my loud words, spoken low, sounded multiple2 in the cloister of my simple isolation.","It was like an optional holiday, quite legal, but observed by no one. Rest and work lived alongside one another, and I had absolutely nothing to do. I’d got up early and lingered over my preparations for existence. I walked from one side of the room to the other, dreaming out loud of unconnected, impossible things — gestures I had forgotten to make, impossible ambitions only randomly realized, long, steadfast conversations which, had I had them, would have taken place. And in this reverie devoid of all grandeur and calm, in this hopeless, endless dawdling, my pacing feet wasted away my free morning, and my words, uttered out loud in a quiet voice, multiplied as they reverberated round the cloister of my simple isolation.","It was an ambiguous holiday, official but not strictly observed.

"Quantas vezes ergo do livro onde estou escrevendo e que trabalho a cabeça vazia de todo o mundo! Mais me valera estar inerte, sem fazer nada, sem ter que fazer nada, porque esse tédio, ainda que real, ao menos o gozaria.

Nothing was going to die yet, but everything, as if in a smile that was still missing, turned to nostalgia for life2.","Though it’s true that the latter afford us a nobler pleasure than life, in fact they are like dreams in which we experience feelings never felt in life and that conjure up shapes never seen; they are just dreams from which one awakens, not memories or nostalgic longings with which we might later live a second life.","The real beginning of autumn was announced by a coldness in the air’s non-coldness, by a subduing of the still unsubdued colours, by something of shadow and distance in the tint of the landscapes and the fuzzy countenance of things. Nothing was going to die yet, but everything – as in a still unformed smile – looked longingly back at life."
"Todos estes ideais, possíveis ou impossíveis, acabam agora1. Tenho a realidade diante de mim — não é sequer o caixeiro, é a mão dele (a ele não vejo)2, tentáculo absurdo de uma alma com família e sorte, que faz trejeitos de aranha sem teia no esticar-se da reposição cá à frente.","All these ideals, possible or impossible, are now over1. I have reality in front of me — it's not even the clerk, it's his hand (I don't see him)2, the absurd tentacle of a soul with a family and luck, which makes spider-like gestures without a web in the stretch of replenishment from here to there. front.","So I often find myself repeating to someone something I’ve already told him or asking again the very thing he’s just told me; yet I can describe in four photographic words the set of his facial muscles as he said the words I no longer remember, or the attentive way he looked at me as I told him the story I now have no recollection of having told. I’m two people who mutually keep their distance — Siamese twins living separate lives. 276 [1930?]","All these ideals, possible or impossible, now end. Now I face reality, which isn’t even the sales assistant (whom I don’t see), only his hand, the absurd tentacle of a soul with a family and a fate, and it twists like a spider without a web while putting back tins of polish in the window. And one of the tins fell, like the Fate of us all."
"Nunca encarei o suicídio como uma solução, porque eu odeio a vida por amor a ela. Levei tempo a convencer-me deste lamentável equívoco em que vivo comigo. Convencido dele, fiquei desgostoso, o que sempre me acontece quando me convenço de qualquer coisa, porque o convencimento é em mim sempre a perda de uma ilusão.","I never saw suicide as a solution, because I hate life for the sake of it. It took me time to convince myself of this regrettable mistake I live in with myself. Convinced of it, I was disgusted, which always happens to me when I'm convinced of anything, because conviction is always in me the loss of an illusion.","How often, to obtain a deeper sense of repose, do I remember what I never was, and there is no clarity, no nostalgia about my memories of a provincial town where I lived as people do, measuring out each floorboard, moving in and out of the long ago, in vast rooms I never knew. So completely have I become a fiction of myself that the minute any natural feeling (should I experience such a thing) is born, it becomes at once an imagined feeling — memory becomes dream, dream a forgetting of dreams, self-knowledge a lack of self-­reflection.","I’ve never seen suicide as a solution, because my hatred of life is due to my love of life. It took me a long time to be convinced of this unfortunate mistake in how I live with myself. Convinced of it, I felt frustrated, which is what I always feel when I convince myself of something, since for me each new conviction means another lost illusion."

"Mas tu, na tua vaga essência, não és nada. Não tens realidade, nem mesmo uma realidade só tua. Propriamente, não te vejo, nem mesmo te sinto.

You have no reality, not even a reality that belongs only to you. Strictly speaking, I don’t see you or even feel you.

"A vida, disse Tarde1, é a busca do impossível através do inútil.

Let us always seek the impossible, because such is our fate; let us seek it through the useless, because the way does not pass through another point; let us rise, however, to the awareness that we seek nothing that can be obtained, that we experience nothing that deserves affection or nostalgia.","I feel an almost physical nausea when those mysticisms turn evangelical, when they try to convince another intelligence or another will to find the truth or change the world. I consider myself fortunate to no longer have any relatives, for I am thus free of the obligation, which would inevitably weigh on me, of having to love someone.","Life, said Tarde,* is the search for the impossible by way of the useless. Let us always search for the impossible, since that is our destiny, and let us search for it by way of the useless, since no path goes by any other way, but let us rise to the consciousness that nothing we search for can be found, and that nothing along the way deserves a fond kiss or memory."
"Estou quase místico, como eles, ao falar deles, mas seria incapaz de ser mais que estas palavras escritas ao sabor da minha inclinação ocasional. Serei sempre da Rua dos Douradores, como a humanidade inteira. Serei sempre, em verso ou prosa, empregado de carteira. Serei sempre no místico ou no não-místico, local e submisso, servo das minhas sensações e da hora em que as ter. Serei sempre, sob o grande pálio azul do céu mudo, pajem num rito incompreendido, vestido de vida para cumpri-lo, e executando, sem saber porquê, gestos e passos, posições e maneiras, até que a festa acabe, ou o meu papel nela, e eu possa ir comer coisas de gala nas grandes barracas que estão, dizem, lá em baixo ao fundo do jardim.","I am almost mystical, like them, in speaking of them, but I would be incapable of being more than these words written at the whim of my occasional inclination. I will always be from Rua dos Douradores, like all of humanity. I will always be, in verse or prose, a pickpocket. I will always be in the mystical or the non-mystical, local and submissive, a servant of my sensations and the moment I have them. I will always be, under the great blue canopy of the mute sky, a page in a misunderstood rite, dressed in life to fulfill it, and performing, without knowing why, gestures and steps, positions and manners, until the party is over, or my role in it, and I can go and eat fancy things in the big stalls that are, they say, down at the end of the garden.","Even I feel almost mystical when I speak of them but I would be incapable of being more than these words written under the influence of a chance mood. Like all of humanity, I will always belong to a Rua dos Douradores. In verse or prose, I will always be just another employee at his desk. With or without mysticism, I will always be parochial and submissive, the slave of my feelings and of the moment in which I feel them.

"Assim como, quer o saibamos quer não, temos todos uma metafísica, assim também, quer o queiramos quer não, temos todos uma moral. Tenho uma moral muito simples — não fazer a ninguém nem mal nem bem. Não fazer a ninguém mal, porque não só reconheço nos outros o mesmo direito que julgo que me cabe, de que não me incomodem, mas acho que bastam os males naturais para mal que tenha de haver no mundo. Vivemos todos, neste mundo, a bordo de um navio saído de um porto que desconhecemos para um porto que ignoramos; devemos ter uns para os outros uma amabilidade de viagem. Não fazer bem, porque não sei o que é o bem, nem se o faço quando julgo que o faço. Sei eu que males produzo se dou esmola? Sei eu que males produzo se educo ou instruo? Na dúvida, abstenho-me. E acho, ainda, que auxiliar ou esclarecer é, em certo modo, fazer o mal de intervir na vida alheia. A bondade é um capricho temperamental: não temos o direito de fazer os outros vítimas de nossos caprichos, ainda que de humanidade ou de ternura. Os benefícios são coisas que se infligem; por isso os abomino friamente.","Just as, whether we know it or not, we all have a metaphysics, so, whether we like it or not, we all have a morality. I have a very simple moral—do no harm or good to anyone. Do no harm to anyone, because not only do I recognize in others the same right that I think I have, that they do not bother me, but I think that natural evils are enough for harm that has to be in the world. We all live in this world aboard a ship that leaves a port we don't know to a port we don't know; we should have a travel amiability for each other. Not doing good, because I don't know what good is, or if I do it when I think I'm doing it. Do I know what evils I produce if I give alms? Do I know what evils I produce if I educate or instruct? When in doubt, I abstain. And I also think that helping or clarifying is, in a certain way, to do the harm of intervening in the lives of others. Kindness is a temperamental whim: we do not have the right to make others victims of our whims, even if of humanity or tenderness. Benefits are things that are inflicted; therefore I abhor them coldly.","Others will lean from the same windows; those who have forgotten about shadowy fears are sleeping, nostalgic for the sun they never knew; and I myself, who dares but does not act, will end up, with no regrets, among those soggy reeds made muddy by the nearby river and by my own flaccid inertia, beneath the vast autumn skies of evening, in impossibly far-flung places.","Just as, whether we know it or not, we all have a metaphysics, so too, whether we like it or not, we all have a morality. I have a very simple morality: not to do good or evil to anyone. Not to do evil, because it seems only fair that others enjoy the same right I demand for myself – not to be disturbed – and also because I think that the world doesn’t need more than the natural evils it already has. All of us in this world are living on board a ship that is sailing from one unknown port to another, and we should treat each other with a traveller’s cordiality. Not to do good, because I don’t know what good is, nor even if I do it when I think I do. How do I know what evils I generate if I give a beggar money? How do I know what evils I produce if I teach or instruct? Not knowing, I refrain. And besides, I think that to help or clarify is, in a certain way, to commit the evil of interfering in the lives of others. Kindness depends on a whim of our mood, and we have no right to make others the victims of our whims, however humane or kind-hearted they may be. Good deeds are impositions; that’s why I categorically abhor them."

"Certas horas-intervalos que tenho vivido, horas perante a Natureza, esculpidas na ternura do isolamento, ficar-me-ão para sempre como medalhas. Nesses momentos esqueci todos os meus propósitos de vida, todas as minhas direcções desejadas. Gozei não ser nada com uma plenitude de bonança espiritual, caindo no regaço azul das minhas aspirações. Não gozei nunca, talvez, uma hora indelével, isenta de um fundo espiritual de falência e de desânimo. Em todas as minhas horas libertas uma dor dormia, floria vagamente, por detrás dos muros da minha consciência, em outros quintais; mas o aroma e a própria cor dessas flores tristes atravessavam intuitivamente os muros, e o lado de lá deles, onde floriam as rosas, nunca deixava de ser, no mistério confuso do meu ser, um lado de cá esbatido na minha sonolência de viver.","Certain hours-intervals that I have lived, hours before Nature, sculpted in the tenderness of isolation, will remain as medals for me forever. In those moments I forgot all my life purposes, all my desired directions. I enjoyed being nothing with a fullness of spiritual calm, falling into the blue lap of my aspirations. I never enjoyed, perhaps, an indelible hour, free from a spiritual background of bankruptcy and discouragement. In all my free hours a pain slept, bloomed vaguely, behind the walls of my conscience, in other backyards; but the scent and the very color of those sad flowers intuitively crossed the walls, and the side beyond them, where the roses bloomed, never ceased to be, in the confused mystery of my being, a side over here dimmed in my drowsiness of living.","that a great poet should have Apollo’s body and Napoleon’s face or, rather less demanding, that he be a man of distinction with an expressive face. I know that such ideas are absurd, if natural, human foibles. However, it is not unreasonable to expect some sign of greatness. And when one moves from physical appearance to consider the utterances of the soul, whilst one can do without spirit and vivacity, one does expect intelligence with at least a trace of grandeur. All this, all these human disappointments, make us question the truth of what is vulgarly called inspiration.","I’ve lived certain moments of respite in the presence of Nature, moments sculpted out of tender isolation, that will always be like medals for me. In these moments I forgot all of my life’s goals, all of the paths I wanted to follow. An immense spiritual tranquillity fell into the blue lap of my aspirations and allowed me to enjoy being nothing. But I’ve probably never enjoyed an incorruptible moment, free of any underlying spirit of failure and gloom. In all my moments of spiritual liberation there was a dormant sorrow, vaguely blooming in gardens beyond the walls of my consciousness, and the scent and the very colour of those sad flowers intuitively passed through the stone walls, whose far side (where the roses bloomed) never ceased being a hazy near side in the obscure mystery of who I am, in the drowsiness of my daily existence."
"Coisa arrojada a um canto, trapo caído na estrada, meu ser ignóbil ante a vida finge-se.","Thing thrown into a corner, rag lying on the road, my ignoble being in the face of life pretends.","The feud between the Montagues and the Capulets continues; the curtain falls on what did not happen; and, my office worker’s collar turned unselfconsciously up around the neck of a poet, my boots, which I always buy in the same shop, instinctively skirting the puddles of cold rainwater, I return home (to that room where the absent mistress of the house is as sordid a reality as the rarely seen children and the office colleagues I will meet again tomorrow), feeling a slight, confused concern that I may have lost for ever both my umbrella and the dignity of my soul.","An object tossed into a corner, a rag that fell on to the road, my contemptible being feigns to the world."
"O grande sonho requer certas circunstâncias sociais. Um dia que, embevecido por certo movimento rítmico e dolente do que escrevera, me recordei de Chateaubriand, não tardou que me lembrasse de que eu não era visconde, nem sequer bretão2. Outra vez que julguei sentir, no sentido do que dissera, uma semelhança com Rousseau, não tardou, também, que me ocorresse que, não [tendo] tido o privilégio de ser fidalgo e castelão, também o não tivera de ser suíço e vagabundo.","The big dream requires certain social circumstances. One day when, enraptured by a certain rhythmic and painful movement of what I had written, I remembered Chateaubriand, it didn't take long for me to remember that I was not a viscount, not even a Breton. Another time that I thought I felt, in the sense of what I had said, a resemblance to Rousseau, it did not take long, too, for it to occur to me that, not having had the privilege of being a nobleman and a castellan, I also had not had to be a Swiss and a vagabond.","Faint breeze of all that never dared to live, dumb breath of all that did not want to feel, vain murmur of all that did not want to think, go slowly, lazily down into the whirlpools that inevitably await you and down the slippery slopes placed there for you, go into the shadows or into the light, brother of the world, go forward into glory or into the abyss, son of Chaos and of Night, always remembering in some corner of your being that the Gods came later, and that the Gods too pass away.","Great dreams require special social circumstances. One day, when the doleful cadence of a certain passage I’d written made me excitedly think of Chateaubriand, it didn’t take me long to remember that I’m not a viscount, nor even a Breton. On another occasion, when I’d written something whose content seemed to recall Rousseau, it likewise didn’t take long for me to realize that, besides not being the noble lord of a castle, I also lack the privilege of being a wanderer from Switzerland."

"Nem posso conceber que me estimem por compaixão, porque, embora fisicamente desajeitado e inaceitável, não tenho aquele grau de amarfanhamento orgânico com que entre na órbita da compaixão alheia, nem mesmo aquela simpatia que a atrai quando ela não seja patentemente merecida; e para o que em mim merece piedade, não a pode haver, porque nunca há piedade para os aleijados do espírito. De modo que caí naquele centro de gravidade do desdém alheio, em que não me inclino para a simpatia de ninguém.","Nor can I conceive of anyone esteeming me out of pity, for, though physically awkward and unacceptable, I do not have that degree of organic crumple with which I enter the orbit of other people's pity, nor even that sympathy which attracts it when it is not patently deserved; and for what in me deserves pity, there cannot be, because there is never pity for the crippled of the spirit. So I fell into that center of gravity of other people's disdain, where I don't lean towards anyone's sympathy.",,"I have no other real pleasure besides the analysis of my pain, nor any other sensual delight besides the morbid dribbling of sensations when they crumble and rot – light footsteps in the murky shadows, and we don’t even turn around to find out whose they are; faint songs in the distance, the words of which we don’t try to catch, for we are lulled more by the vagueness of what they’re saying and by the mystery of where they come from; hazy secrets of pallid waters, filling the and nocturnal spaces with ethereal far-aways; bells of distant carriages, and who knows where they’re returning from or what laughs and gaiety they contain, because from here they’re just distant, drowsy carriages in the dull torpor of an afternoon in which summer is giving way to autumn…"
"Há qualquer coisa de longínquo em mim neste momento. Estou de facto à varanda da vida, mas não é bem desta vida. Estou por sobre ela, e vendo-a de onde vejo. Jaz diante de mim, descendo em socalcos e resvalamentos, como uma paisagem diversa, até aos fumos sobre casas brancas das aldeias do vale. Se cerrar os olhos, continuo vendo, pois que não vejo. Se os abrir nada mais vejo, pois que não via. Sou todo eu uma vaga saudade, nem do passado, nem do futuro: sou uma saudade do presente, anónima, prolixa e incompreendida.","There's something far away in me right now. I am indeed on the balcony of life, but not quite this life. I'm over her, and I'm seeing her from where I see her. It lies in front of me, descending in terraces and slips, like a different landscape, to the smoke above the white houses of the villages in the valley. If I close my eyes, I keep seeing, because I don't see. If I open them, I can't see anything else, because I didn't see them. I am all a vague longing, neither for the past nor for the future: I am a longing for the present, anonymous, long-winded and misunderstood.","There is something distant about me just now. I stand on the verandah of life, but it’s not quite of this life. I’m both in the midst of life and observing it from where I stand. It lies before me, descending in ledges and slopes, like a varied landscape, down to the smoke rising from the white houses of the villages in the valley. If I shut my eyes I continue to see it just because I can’t see it. If I open my eyes I see no more, because I never really saw anything. Every part of me is a vague nostalgia neither for the past nor for the future: the whole of me is a nostalgia for the anonymous, prolix, unfathomable present.","In this moment I feel strangely far away. I’m on the balcony of life, yes, but not exactly of this life. I’m above life, looking down on it. It lies before me, descending in a varied landscape of dips and terraces towards the smoke from the white houses of the villages in the valley. If I close my eyes, I keep seeing, because I’m not really seeing. If I open them I see no more, because I wasn’t really seeing in the first place. I’m nothing but a vague nostalgia, not for the past nor for the future but for the present – anonymous, unending and unintelligible."
Quero que a leitura deste livro vos deixe a impressão de terdes atravessado um pesadelo voluptuoso.,I want the reading of this book to leave you with the impression that you have passed through a voluptuous nightmare.,"No tales were told that others might have told before, and no one had any firm information about the person who left earlier in the hope of embarking on some illusory boat, child of the coming fog and of future indecision.",I’d like the reading of this book to leave you with the impression that you’ve traversed a sensual nightmare.
"Sê a Noite Total, torna-te a Noite Única e que todo eu me perca e me esqueça em ti, e que os meus sonhos brilhem, estrelas, no teu corpo de distância e negação…","Be the Total Night, become the Unique Night and may all of me lose myself and forget myself in you, and may my dreams shine, stars, in your body of distance and denial...",,"Be the Absolute Night, the Sole Night, in which I totally lose and forget myself, with my dreams glowing as stars on your body of distance and negation…"
