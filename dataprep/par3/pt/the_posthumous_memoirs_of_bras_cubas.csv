"Naquela noite não padeci essa triste sensação de enfado, mas outra, e deleitosa. As fantasias tumultuavam-me cá dentro, vinham umas sobre outras, à semelhança de devotas que se abalroam para ver o anjo cantor das procissões. Não ouvia os instantes perdidos, mas os minutos ganhados. De certo tempo em diante não ouvi cousa nenhuma, porque o meu pensamento, ardiloso e traquinas, saltou pela janela fora e bateu as asas na direção da casa de Virgília. Aí achou ao peitoril de uma janela o pensamento de Virgília, saudaram-se e ficaram de palestra. Nós a rolarmos na cama, talvez com frio, necessitados de repouso, e os dous vadios ali postos, a repetirem o velho diálogo de Adão e Eva.","That night I didn't suffer that sad feeling of boredom, but another, and delightful one. The fantasies were in turmoil inside me, coming one on top of the other, like devotees who crash together to see the singing angel of the processions. He didn't hear the moments lost, but the minutes gained. From then on I heard nothing, because my thought, cunning and mischievous, jumped out the window and fluttered its wings in the direction of Virgilia's house. There he found Virgilia's thoughts on the windowsill, they greeted each other and continued to talk. Us rolling over in bed, maybe cold, in need of rest, and the two bums lying there, repeating the old dialogue between Adam and Eve.","On that night I didn’t suffer that sad feeling of tedium but a different and delightful one. Fantasies swarmed inside of me, coming one on top of another like the devout women who crush forward in order to get a look at the singing angel in processions. I wasn’t hearing the instants lost but the minutes gained. From a certain time forward I didn’t hear anything at all because my thought, wily and frisky, leaped out the window and flapped its wings toward Virgília’s house. There it found Virgília’s thought on a window sill. They greeted each other, remained chatting. We were tossing in bed, cold perhaps, in need of rest, and those two idlers there were repeating the old dialogue of Adam and Eve.","On that night I was not visited by that terrible ennui, but by another sensation, a delightful one. Fantasies were aflutter within me, one tumbling after the other, like pious ladies jostling to see the singing angel in a religious procession. I heard not the moments lost, but the minutes gained. At some point hence I heard nothing at all, for my thoughts, cunning and restless as they were, leaped out the window and flew over to Virgília’s house. There they found Virgília’s thoughts on a windowsill, where they greeted one another and struck up a conversation. There we were, tossing and turning in our beds, perhaps feeling cold, deprived of rest, as those two vagabonds echoed the age-old dialogue of Adam and Eve."
"Naquela noite descobri a causa verdadeira. Era medo do parto e vexame da gravidez. Padecera muito quando lhe nasceu o primeiro filho; e essa hora, feita de minutos de vida e minutos de morte, dava-lhe já imaginariamente os calafrios do patíbulo. Quanto ao vexame, complicava-se ainda da forçada privação de certos hábitos da vida elegante. Com certeza, era isso mesmo; dei-lho a entender, repreendendo-a, um pouco em nome dos meus direitos de pai. Virgília fitou-me; em seguida desviou os olhos e sorriu de um jeito incrédulo.","That night I discovered the real cause. It was fear of childbirth and vexation of pregnancy. She had suffered a lot when her first child was born; and that hour, made up of minutes of life and minutes of death, already made him shiver on the scaffold. As for the embarrassment, it was further complicated by the forced deprivation of certain habits of elegant life. Sure enough, that was it; I let her know, scolding her, a little in the name of my father's rights. Virgilia looked at me; then he averted his eyes and smiled in disbelief.","That night I discovered the real reason. It was fear of childbirth and the annoyance of pregnancy. She’d suffered a great deal with the birth of her first child. During that hour made up of minutes of life and minutes of death, she’d experienced the chills of the gallows in her imagination. As for the annoyance, it was complicated all the more by the forced deprivation of certain habits of her elegant life. That must have been it, most certainly. I gave her to understand that, scolding her a little by my rights as a father. Virgília stared at me. She immediately turned her eyes away and smiled in an incredulous way.","On that night, I discovered the true cause. It was her fear of childbirth and the indignity of pregnancy. She had suffered greatly when her first child was born; and at the very thought of that hour, made up of minutes of life and minutes of death, her imagination gave her the chills of the gallows. As for the indignity, it was rendered even more onerous by the forcible privation of social pleasures. This was certainly it; I made as much known to her and delivered a reprimand, partly in the name of my rights as a father. Virgília stared at me; then she looked away and smiled incredulously."
"O despropósito fez-me perder outro capítulo. Que melhor não era dizer as cousas lisamente, sem todos estes solavancos! Já comparei o meu estilo ao andar dos ébrios. Se a ideia vos parece indecorosa, direi que ele é o que eram as minhas refeições com Virgília, na casinha da Gamboa, onde às vezes fazíamos a nossa patuscada, o nosso luncheon. Vinho, fruta, compotas. Comíamos, é verdade, mas era um comer virgulado de palavrinhas doces, de olhares ternos, de criancices, uma infinidade desses apartes do coração, aliás o verdadeiro, o ininterrupto discurso do amor. Às vezes vinha o arrufo temperar o nímio adocicado da situação. Ela deixava-me, refugiava-se num canto do canapé, ou ia para o interior ouvir as denguices de D. Plácida. Cinco ou dez minutos depois, reatávamos a palestra, como eu reato a narração, para desatá-la outra vez. Note-se que, longe de termos horror ao método, era nosso costume convidá-lo, na pessoa de D. Plácida, a sentar-se conosco à mesa; mas D. Plácida não aceitava nunca.","The nonsense made me miss another chapter. What better way to say things smoothly, without all these bumps! I've compared my style to that of drunkards. If the idea seems unseemly to you, I will say that it is what my meals with Virgília were like, at the little house in Gamboa, where we sometimes had our patuscada, our luncheon. Wine, fruit, jams. We ate, it's true, but it was eating with sweet little words, tender looks, childishness, an infinity of those asides of the heart, in fact the true, uninterrupted discourse of love. Sometimes the fuss came to temper the sweet mood of the situation. She would leave me, take refuge in a corner of the sofa, or go inside to listen to Dona Plácida's denguices. Five or ten minutes later, we would resume the lecture, as I resume the narration, to untie it again. It should be noted that, far from being terrified of the method, it was our custom to invite him, in the person of Dona Plácida, to sit with us at the table; but Dona Plácida never accepted.","The absurdity made me lose another chapter. How much better it would have been to have said things smoothly, without all these jolts! I’ve already compared my style to a drunkard’s gait. If the idea seems indecorous to you, let me say that it’s what my meals with Virgília were like in the little house in Gamboa, where we would have our sumptuous feast sometimes, our luncheon. Wine, fruit, compotes. We would eat, it’s true, but it was eating punctuated by loving little words, tender looks, childish acts, an infinity of those side comments of the heart in addition to the real, uninterrupted discourse of love. Sometimes a tiff would come to temper the excessive sweetness of the situation. She would leave me, take refuge in a corner of the settee or go inside to listen to Dona Plácida’s pruderies. Five or ten minutes later we would pick up the thread of our conversation the way I pick up the thread of this narrative to let it unwind again. Let it be noted that far from being horrified at the method, it was our custom to invite it in the person of Dona Plácida, to sit down at the table with us, but Dona Plácida never accepted.","The nonsense has made me waste another chapter. How much better it would be to say things smoothly, without all this jolting! I’ve already compared my style to a drunkard’s walk. If the idea strikes you as indecorous, I will say that it was precisely what my meals with Virgília were at the little house in Gamboa, where we often had our feasts, our refreshments. Wine, fruit, compotes. We ate, it’s true, but the eating was punctuated with the commas of sweet words, tender gazes, childish moments, an endless stream of these asides of the heart which are the true, uninterrupted discourse of love. At times a lover’s quarrel would come to temper the surfeit of sweetness. She would leave me and take refuge in a corner of the sofa, or go inside to hear Dona Plácida’s cooing. Five or ten minutes later, we would resume the thread of our conversation again, as I resume the thread of narration, only to abandon it yet again. Note that not only did we not flee from method, we also habitually invited it, in the form of Dona Plácida, to join us at the table; but Dona Plácida never said yes."
"Como este apelido de Cubas lhe cheirasse excessivamente a tanoaria, alegava meu pai, bisneto de Damião, que o dito apelido fora dado a um cavaleiro, herói nas jornadas da África,* em prêmio da façanha que praticou, arrebatando trezentas cubas aos mouros. Meu pai era homem de imaginação; escapou à tanoaria nas asas de um calembour. Era um bom caráter, meu pai, varão digno e leal como poucos. Tinha, é verdade, uns fumos de pacholice; mas quem não é um pouco pachola nesse mundo? Releva notar que ele não recorreu à inventiva senão depois de experimentar a falsificação; primeiramente, entroncou-se na família daquele meu famoso homônimo, o capitão-mor Brás Cubas,** que fundou a vila de São Vicente onde morreu em 1592, e por esse motivo é que me deu o nome de Brás. Opôs-se-lhe, porém, a família do capitão-mor, e foi então que ele imaginou as trezentas cubas mouriscas.","As this nickname of Cubas smacks of cooperage excessively, my father, Damião's great-grandson, alleged that the said nickname had been given to a knight, a hero in the African journeys,* as a reward for the feat he performed, snatching three hundred vats from the Moors. My father was a man of imagination; escaped the cooperage on the wings of a calembour. He was a good character, my father, a worthy and loyal man like few others. It had, it is true, a hint of pacholice; but who isn't a little pachola in this world? It is worth noting that he did not resort to inventiveness until after experimenting with forgery; first, he became part of the family of that famous namesake of mine, the captain-major Brás Cubas,** who founded the village of São Vicente where he died in 1592, and for that reason he gave me the name Brás. However, the captain-major's family opposed him, and it was then that he imagined the three hundred Moorish vats.","Since the surname Cubas, meaning kegs, smelled too much of cooperage, my father, Damião’s great–grandson, alleged that the aforesaid surname had been given to a knight, a hero of the African campaigns, as a reward for a deed he brought off: the capture of three hundred barrels from the Moors. My father was a man of imagination; he flew out of the cooperage on the wings of a pun. He was a good character, my father, a worthy and loyal man like few others. He had a touch of the fibber about him, it’s true, but who in this world doesn’t have a bit of that? It should be noted that he never had recourse to invention except after an attempt at falsification. At first he had the family branch off from that famous namesake of mine, Captain-Major Brás Cubas, who founded the town, of São Vicente, where he died in 1592, and that’s why he named me Brás. The captain-major’s family refuted him, however, and that was when he imagined the three hundred Moorish kegs.","Since the name Cubas wafted of cooperage, my father, Damião’s great-grandson, alleged that the cognomen had been given to a knight, a hero of the African campaigns, in recognition of a feat in which he captured three hundred barrels from the Moors. My father was a man of great imagination; he escaped from the cooper’s shop on the wings of wordplay. He was a good man, my father, worthy and loyal like few others. He had a way of putting on airs, it’s true, but who in this world hasn’t wrapped himself in an air or two? It may be appropriate to note that he resorted to invention only after having tried out falsification; he had initially grafted himself onto the family of my famous namesake, Captain-Major Brás Cubas, who founded the town of São Vicente and died there in 1592, and it was for that reason that he gave me the name Brás.3 The family of the captain-major objected, however, and it was then that my father conjured up the three hundred Moorish barrels."

No one takes any notice of me anymore. But to leave no room for suspicion, I’ll come with Nhonhô.”5"
"— Nunca, nunca, meu amor!","""Never, never, my love!""","She held out her hands, took mine, snuggled me against her breast, and whispered softly in my ear, “Never, never, my love!”","“Never, never, my love!”"

Perhaps because nature rushed me, they forced me early to grab the chairs, they took me out of my diaper, they gave me wooden strollers.","Note: I began to walk.

"Jantei triste. Não era a falta do relógio que me pungia, era a imagem do autor do furto, e as reminiscências de criança, e outra vez a comparação, e a conclusão… Desde a sopa, começou a abrir em mim a flor amarela e mórbida do capítulo XXV, e então jantei depressa, para correr à casa de Virgília. Virgília era o presente; eu queria refugiar-me nele, para escapar às opressões do passado, porque o encontro do Quincas Borba tornara-me aos olhos o passado, não qual fora deveras, mas um passado roto, abjeto, mendigo e gatuno.","I had a sad dinner. It wasn't the lack of a watch that stung me, it was the image of the author of the theft, and the reminiscences of a child, and again the comparison, and the conclusion... From the soup, the morbid yellow flower of the chapter began to open in me XXV, and then I had a quick dinner, to run to Virgilia's house.

Virgília was the present. I wanted to take refuge in it so I could escape the burdens of the past, because the encounter with Quincas Borba had turned my eyes back to the past and I had really entered it, but it was a broken, abject, beggarly, and thievish past.","I had a melancholy supper.

"Começo a ficar patético e prefiro dormir. Dormi, sonhei que era nababo, e acordei com a ideia de ser nababo. Eu gostava, às vezes, de imaginar esses contrastes de região, estado e credo. Alguns dias antes tinha pensado na hipótese de uma revolução social, religiosa e política, que transferisse o arcebispo de Cantuária* a simples coletor de Petrópolis, e fiz longos cálculos para saber se o coletor eliminaria o arcebispo, ou se o arcebispo rejeitaria o coletor, ou que porção de arcebispo pode jazer num coletor, ou que soma de coletor pode combinar com um arcebispo, etc. Questões insolúveis, aparentemente, mas na realidade perfeitamente solúveis, desde que se atenda que pode haver num arcebispo dous arcebispos — o da bula e o outro. Está dito, vou ser nababo.","I'm starting to get pathetic and I'd rather sleep. I slept, dreamed I was a nawab, and woke up with the idea of being a nawab. I sometimes liked to imagine these contrasts of region, state, and creed. A few days before, I had thought about the hypothesis of a social, religious and political revolution, which would transfer the Archbishop of Canterbury* to a simple collector of Petropolis, and I made long calculations to know if the collector would eliminate the archbishop, or if the archbishop would reject the collector, or what portion of archbishop may lie in a collector, or what sum of collector may combine with an archbishop, &c. Insoluble questions, apparently, but in reality perfectly solvable, as long as it is understood that there can be two archbishops in an archbishop — the one with the bull and the other. It's been said, I'm going to be a nawab.","I was beginning to get dotty and I preferred sleeping. I slept, I dreamed I was a nabob and I woke up with the idea of being a nabob.

Insoluble questions, apparently, but in reality perfectly soluble if one considers that there can be two archbishops in one archbishop—the one from the bull and the other one. It’s all set, I’m going to be a nabob. It was nothing but drollery.","I was beginning to grow plaintive, to which I preferred sleep. I slept, dreamt that I was a nabob, and awoke wanting to be one.

Apparently insoluble questions, but in reality they are quite soluble, once one realizes that in a single archbishop there may actually be two archbishops: the one from the bull and the other one. It’s settled, I’ll be a nabob."
"Interrompi-me; Virgília empalidecera muito, deixou cair os braços e sentou-se no canapé. Esteve assim alguns instantes, sem me dizer palavra, não sei se vacilante na escolha, se aterrada com a ideia da descoberta e da morte. Fui-me a ela, insisti na proposta, disse-lhe todas as vantagens de uma vida a sós, sem zelos, nem terrores, nem aflições. Virgília ouvia-me calada; depois disse: — Não escaparíamos talvez; ele iria ter comigo e matava-me do mesmo modo.","I interrupted myself; Virgilia had turned very pale, dropped her arms and sat down on the sofa.

I went over to her, insisted on the proposal, told her all of the advantages of a life alone together, without jealousies, terrors, or afflictions. Virgília listened to me in silence, then said: “We might not escape. He’d catch up with me and kill me just the same.”","I broke off; Virgília had gone very pale, let her arms fall by her sides, and sat down on the sofa. She remained that way for a few moments without saying a word, either hesitating over her choice or terrified by the idea of being found out and killed.

Virgília heard me out in silence; then she said: “We might not escape; he’d come and kill me just the same.”"
"Fiz-lhe sinal para que não insistisse, e ele calou-se por alguns instantes. O doente ficou a olhar para o teto, calado, a arfar muito; Virgília empalideceu, levantou-se, foi até à janela. Suspeitara a morte e tinha medo. Eu procurei falar de outras cousas. O sujeito magro contou uma anedota, e tornou a tratar da casa, alteando a proposta.","I signaled him not to insist, and he was silent for a few moments. The patient stared at the ceiling, silent, panting heavily; Virgilia paled, got up, went to the window. He had suspected death and was afraid. I tried to talk about other things. The thin guy told an anecdote, and went back to the house, raising the proposal.","I signaled him not to go on and he was silent for a few moments.

"Deixei-o nessa reticência, e fui descalçar as botas, que estavam apertadas. Uma vez aliviado, respirei à larga, e deitei-me a fio comprido, enquanto os pés, e todo eu atrás deles, entrávamos numa relativa bem-aventurança. Então considerei que as botas apertadas são uma das maiores venturas da Terra, porque, fazendo doer os pés, dão azo ao prazer de as descalçar. Mortifica os pés, desgraçado, desmortifica-os depois, e aí tens a felicidade barata, ao sabor dos sapateiros e de Epicuro. Enquanto esta ideia me trabalhava no famoso trapézio, lançava eu os olhos para a Tijuca, e via a aleijadinha perder-se no horizonte do pretérito, e sentia que o meu coração não tardaria também a descalçar as suas botas. E descalçou-as, o lascivo. Quatro ou cinco dias depois, saboreava esse rápido, inefável e incoercível momento de gozo, que sucede a uma dor pungente, a uma preocupação, a um incômodo… Daqui inferi eu que a vida é o mais engenhoso dos fenômenos, porque só aguça a fome com o fim de deparar a ocasião de comer, e não inventou os calos, senão porque eles aperfeiçoam a felicidade terrestre. Em verdade vos digo que toda a sabedoria humana não vale um par de botas curtas.","I left him in that reticence, and went to take off my boots, which were tight. Once relieved, I took a deep breath, and lay down long, while my feet, and all of me behind them, entered a relative bliss. So I considered that tight boots are one of the greatest adventures on Earth, because, making your feet hurt, they give rise to the pleasure of taking them off. Mortify your feet, wretch, then de-mortify them, and there you have cheap happiness, at the whim of shoemakers and Epicurus. While this idea was working on the famous trapeze, I cast my eyes towards Tijuca, and saw the little cripple lose itself in the horizon of the past, and I felt that my heart would soon take off its boots as well. And took them off, the lascivious. Four or five days later, I was savoring that quick, ineffable and incomprehensible moment of joy, which follows a pungent pain, a worry, an annoyance... in order to find the opportunity to eat, and did not invent corns, but because they perfect earthly happiness. Truly I say to you that all human wisdom is not worth a pair of short boots.","I left him with that reticence and went to take off my boots, which were tight. Once relieved, I took a deep breath and stretched out while my feet and all that extended up from them went into relative bliss. Then I pondered the fact that tight boots are one of the best bits of good fortune on earth, because by making one’s feet hurt they give occasion to the pleasure of taking them off. Punish your feet, wretch, then unpunish them and there you have cheap happiness, at the mercy of shoemakers and worthy of Epicurus. While that idea was working out on my famous trapeze, I cast my eyes up toward Tijuca and saw the little cripple disappearing over the horizon of the past and I felt that my heart wouldn’t be long in taking off its boots either. And they were taken off by lechery. Four or five days later I was savoring that quick, ineffable, and irrepressible moment of pleasure that follows a sharp pain, a preoccupation, an indisposition … From that I inferred that life is the most ingenious of phenomena because hunger only becomes sharp with an aim to bring on the occasion for eating, and that life only invented calluses because they perfect earthly happiness. In all truth I can tell you that all of human wisdom isn’t worth a pair of short boots.","I left him in his ellipsis and went to take off my boots, which were tight. Once relieved, I breathed deeply and stretched out while my feet, and all the rest of myself after them, entered into relative bliss. Then I pondered that tight boots are one of the greatest blessings on earth, for by causing one’s feet to hurt, they make way for the pleasure of taking them off. Mortify your feet, wretch, then unmortify them, and there you have cheap happiness, befitting both shoemakers and Epicurus. As this idea worked away on my famous trapeze, I cast my eyes to Tijuca, saw the little crippled girl vanish away on the horizon of the past tense, and felt that my heart would not be long in taking off its own boots. And take them off it did, the wanton thing. Four or five days later, it would savor that swift, ineffable, irrepressible moment of pleasure that follows a racking pain, a worry, a discomfort . . . From this I inferred that life is the most ingenious of all phenomena, as it sharpens hunger only for the purpose of providing occasion to eat, and it invented corns only because they work to perfect earthly happiness. Verily I say unto you that the sum total of human wisdom isn’t worth a pair of tight boots."

"Ao ouvir esta última palavra, recuei um pouco, tomado de susto.

"O estilo desmentia da pessoa, assaz rude e aparentemente alheia a locuções rebuscadas. Fitei-o; ele pareceu saborear o meu espanto.

O capitão rosnou alguma cousa, deu dous passos, meteu a mão no bolso, sacou um pedaço de papel, muito amarrotado; depois, à luz de uma lanterna, leu uma ode horaciana sobre a liberdade da vida marítima. Eram versos dele.","The style belied the person, quite rude and apparently oblivious to far-fetched phrases. I stared at him; he seemed to savor my amazement.

"— Imagina, por exemplo, que eu não tinha nascido — continuou o Quincas Borba —; é positivo que não teria agora o prazer de conversar contigo, comer esta batata, ir ao teatro, e para tudo dizer numa só palavra: viver. Nota que eu não faço do homem um simples veículo de Humanitas; não, ele é ao mesmo tempo veículo, cocheiro e passageiro; ele é o próprio Humanitas reduzido; daí a necessidade de adorar-se a si próprio. Queres uma prova da superioridade do meu sistema? Contempla a inveja. Não há moralista grego ou turco, cristão ou muçulmano, que não troveje contra o sentimento da inveja. O acordo é universal, desde os campos da Idumeia até o alto da Tijuca. Ora bem; abre mão dos velhos preconceitos, esquece as retóricas rafadas, e estuda a inveja, esse sentimento tão subtil e tão nobre. Sendo cada homem uma redução de Humanitas, é claro que nenhum homem é fundamentalmente oposto a outro homem, quaisquer que sejam as aparências contrárias. Assim, por exemplo, o algoz que executa o condenado pode excitar o vão clamor dos poetas; mas substancialmente é Humanitas que corrige em Humanitas uma infração da lei de Humanitas. O mesmo direi do indivíduo que estripa a outro; é uma manifestação da força de Humanitas. Nada obsta (e há exemplos) que ele seja igualmente estripado. Se entendeste bem, facilmente compreenderás que a inveja não é senão uma admiração que luta, e sendo a luta a grande função do gênero humano, todos os sentimentos belicosos são os mais adequados à sua felicidade. Daí vem que a inveja é uma virtude.","""Imagine, for example, that I hadn't been born,"" Quincas Borba continued; It's good that I wouldn't have the pleasure of talking to you now, eating this potato, going to the theater, and to say it all in one word: live. Note that I do not make man a mere vehicle of Humanitas; no, he is at once vehicle, coachman, and passenger; he is the reduced Humanitas itself; hence the need to worship oneself. You want proof of the superiority of my system? Contemplate envy. There is no moralist, Greek or Turkish, Christian or Muslim, who does not thunder against the feeling of envy. The agreement is universal, from the fields of Idumeia to the top of Tijuca. Well; give up the old prejudices, forget the rafado rhetoric, and study envy, that feeling so subtle and so noble. Each man being a reduction of Humanitas, it is clear that no man is fundamentally opposed to another man, whatever appearances to the contrary. Thus, for example, the executioner who executes the condemned can excite the vain clamor of poets; but substantially it is Humanitas that corrects in Humanitas a violation of the Humanitas law. The same will be said of the individual who disembowels another; it is a manifestation of the strength of Humanitas. Nothing prevents (and there are examples) that he is also disemboweled. If you understand well, you will easily understand that envy is nothing but an admiration that fights, and since the fight is the great function of the human race, all bellicose feelings are the most adequate to its happiness. Hence envy is a virtue.","“Imagine, for example, that I had not been born,” Quincas Borba went on. “It’s positive that I wouldn’t be having the pleasure of chatting with you now, of eating this potato, of going to the theatre, or, to put it all into one word, living. Note that I’m not making a man a simple vehicle of Humanitas. He is vehicle, passenger, and coachman all at the same time. He is Humanitas itself in a reduced form. It follows from that that there is a need for him to worship himself. Do you want a proof of the superiority of my system? Think about envy. There is no moralist, Greek or Turkish, Christian or Muslim, who doesn’t thunder against the feeling of envy. Agreement is universal, from the fields of Idumea to the heights of Tijuca. So, then, let go of old prejudices, forget about shabby rhetoric, and study envy, that ever so subtle and so noble feeling. With every man a reduction of Humanitas, it’s clear that no man is fundamentally opposed to another man, whatever contrary appearances may be. Thus, for example, the headsman who executes the condemned man can excite the vain clamor of poets. But, substantially, it is Humanitas correcting in Humanitas an infraction of the law of Humanitas. I will say the same of an individual who disembowels another. It’s a manifestation of the force of Humanitas. There is nothing to prevent (and there are examples) his being disemboweled just the same. If you’ve understood well, you will easily understand that envy is nothing but an admiration that fights, and since fighting is the main function of humankind, all bellicose feelings are the ones that best serve its happiness. It follows, then, that envy is a virtue.”","“Imagine, for example, that I had never been born,” Quincas Borba went on. “I would certainly not have the pleasure of speaking to you now, eating this potato, going to the theater . . . in a word, living. Note that I do not make man a simple vehicle for Humanitas; no, he is at the same time the vehicle, coachman, and passenger; he is Humanitas itself in miniature; hence the need to adore oneself. Would you like proof of the superiority of my system? Consider envy. There is no moralist, Greek or Turk, Christian or Muslim, who does not rail against the sentiment of envy. They are in perfect accord, from the fields of Edom to the heights of Tijuca. See here; leave off old prejudices, forget all the frayed rhetoric, and study envy, that subtle and noble sentiment. If each man is Humanitas in miniature, clearly no man is fundamentally opposed to another man, despite appearances to the contrary. Thus, for example, the hangman who executes a condemned man may arouse the vain lamentations of the poets; but concretely, this is Humanitas correcting in Humanitas an infraction of the law of Humanitas. I would say the same of an individual who disembowels another; this is a manifestation of the strength of Humanitas. Nothing stands in the way of his being disemboweled in turn (and there are examples of this). If you have understood well, then you will easily comprehend that envy is nothing but an admiration that struggles, and since struggle is the highest function of the human race, bellicose sentiments are those most suitable to its happiness. It follows then that envy is a virtue.”"
"Não acabaria se houvesse de contar pelo miúdo o que padeci nas primeiras horas. Vacilava entre um querer e um não querer, entre a piedade que me empuxava à casa de Virgília e outro sentimento — egoísmo, suponhamos —, que me dizia: — Fica; deixa-a a sós com o problema, deixa-a que ela o resolverá no sentido do amor. — Creio que essas duas forças tinham igual intensidade, investiam e resistiam ao mesmo tempo, com ardor, com tenacidade, e nenhuma cedia definitivamente. Às vezes sentia um dentezinho de remorso; parecia-me que abusava da fraqueza de uma mulher amante e culpada, sem nada sacrificar nem arriscar de mim próprio; e, quando ia a capitular, vinha outra vez o amor, e me repetia o conselho egoísta, e eu ficava irresoluto e inquieto, desejoso de a ver, e receoso de que a vista me levasse a compartir a responsabilidade da solução.","It wouldn't end if I had to tell the kid what I suffered in the first few hours. I vacillated between wanting and not wanting, between the pity that drove me to Virgilia's house and another feeling — selfishness, let's suppose — that told me: — Stay; leave her alone with the problem, let her solve it in the sense of love. — I believe that these two forces had equal intensity, they invested and resisted at the same time, with ardor, with tenacity, and neither gave definitively. Sometimes he felt a little tooth of remorse; it seemed to me that I abused the weakness of a loving and guilty woman, without sacrificing or risking anything of myself; and when I was about to capitulate, love came again, and repeated the selfish advice to me, and I was irresolute and restless, desirous of seeing her, and afraid that the sight would lead me to share the responsibility of the solution.","I would never finish were I to recount every detail of how I suffered during the first few hours. I vacillated between wanting and not wanting, between the compassion that was pulling me toward Virgília’s house and a different feeling—selfishness, let us suppose—that was telling me: “Stay here. Leave her alone with the problem, leave her along because she’ll resolve it in favor of love.” I think those two forces were equal in intensity; they attacked and resisted at the same time, fervently, tenaciously, and neither was giving way at all. Sometimes I felt a tiny bite of remorse. It seemed to me that I was abusing the weakness of a guilty woman in love, without any sacrifice or risk on my part. And when I was about to surrender, love would come again and repeat the selfish advice to me and I would remain irresolute and restless, desirous of seeing her and wary that the sight of her would lead me to share the responsibility of the solution.","If I were to recount in minute detail what I suffered in those first hours, I should never finish. I wavered between wanting and not wanting, between the pity thrusting me toward Virgília’s house and another sentiment—selfishness, let’s say—which said: “Stay where you are; leave her alone with the problem, and she’ll decide on the side of love.” I believe that these two forces were equally powerful, assailing and resisting at the same time, ardent and tenacious, and neither would give way entirely. At times I felt a pang of remorse; it seemed that I was taking advantage of the weakness of a woman in love and in the wrong, while I neither sacrificed nor risked anything of my own; but just as I was about to capitulate, love would come again, repeating its selfish counsel, and I was left irresolute and restless, yearning to see her and fearing that the sight of her might lead me to share the responsibility for the solution."

"O fundador da minha família foi um certo Damião Cubas, que floresceu na primeira metade do século XVIII. Era tanoeiro de ofício, natural do Rio de Janeiro, onde teria morrido na penúria e na obscuridade, se somente exercesse a tanoaria. Mas não; fez-se lavrador, plantou, colheu, permutou o seu produto por boas e honradas patacas, até que morreu, deixando grosso cabedal a um filho, o licenciado Luís Cubas. Neste rapaz é que verdadeiramente começa a série de meus avós — dos avós que a minha família sempre confessou —, porque o Damião Cubas era afinal de contas um tanoeiro, e talvez mau tanoeiro, ao passo que o Luís Cubas estudou em Coimbra, primou no Estado, e foi um dos amigos particulares do vice-rei conde da Cunha.","The founder of my family was a certain Damião Cubas, who flourished in the first half of the 18th century.

It is in this boy that the series of my grandparents really begins — the grandparents that my family has always confessed to — because Damião Cubas was, after all, a cooper, and perhaps a bad cooper, while Luís Cubas studied in Coimbra, excelled in State, and was one of the private friends of the viceroy Count da Cunha.","The founder of my family was a certain Damião Cubas, who flourished in the first half of the eighteenth century.

It was with this young man that my series of grandfathers really begins—the grandfathers my family always admitted to—because Damião Cubas was, after all, a cooper, and perhaps even a bad cooper, while Luís Cubas studied at Coimbra, was conspicuous in affairs of state, and was a personal friend of the viceroy, Count da Cunha.","The founder of my family was one Damião Cubas, who flourished in the first half of the eighteenth century.

Plácida acabaria como tantas outras criaturas humanas; donde se poderia deduzir que o vício é muitas vezes o estrume da virtude. O que não impede que a virtude seja uma flor cheirosa e sã. A consciência concordou, e eu fui abrir a porta a Virgília.","I agreed that this was so, but I argued that Dona Plácida's old age was now protected from begging: it was a compensation. If it weren't for my loves, probably D. Plácida would end up like so many other human creatures; whence it might be deduced that vice is often the dung of virtue. Which does not prevent virtue from being a fragrant and healthy flower. Conscience agreed, and I went to open the door for Virgilia.","I agreed that that was how it was, but I argued that Dona Plácida’s old age was not protected from beggary. It was a compensation. If it hadn’t been for our love affair, most likely Dona Plácida would have ended up like so many other human creatures, from which it can be deduced that vice many times is manure for virtue. And that doesn’t prevent virtue from being a fragrant and healthy bloom. My conscience agreed and I went to open the door for Virgília.","I agreed that this was so, but I alleged that Dona Plácida was now safe from beggary in her old age, and that this was ample compensation.

None of which prevents virtue from being a fragrant, healthy flower. My conscience agreed, and I went to open the door for Virgília."
"Fui até a janela, e comecei a rufar com os dedos no peitoril. Virgília chamou-me; deixei-me estar, a remoer os meus zelos, a desejar estrangular o marido, se o tivesse ali à mão… Justamente, nesse instante, apareceu na chácara o Lobo Neves. Não tremas assim, leitora pálida; descansa, que não hei de rubricar esta lauda com um pingo de sangue.

Virgília hurriedly left the room, which he entered three minutes later.","I went to the window and began drumming my fingers on the sill.

"Saí desatinado; gastei duas mortais horas em vaguear pelos bairros mais excêntricos e desertos, onde fosse difícil dar comigo.

Então resolvia embarcar imediatamente para cortar a minha vida em duas metades, e deleitava-me com a ideia de que Marcela, sabendo da partida, ficaria ralada de saudades e remorsos. Que ela amara-me, a tonta, devia de sentir alguma cousa, uma lembrança qualquer, como do alferes Duarte… Nisto, o dente do ciúme enterrava-se-me no coração; toda a natureza bradava que era preciso levar Marcela comigo.","I went out of my mind; I spent two deadly hours wandering through the most eccentric and deserted neighborhoods, where it was difficult to find myself.

So I decided to embark immediately to cut my life in two halves, and I delighted in the idea that Marcela, knowing about the departure, would be grated with homesickness and remorse. That she had loved me, the fool, she must have felt something, a memory of some kind, like that of Ensign Duarte... In this, the tooth of jealousy sank into my heart; all nature shouted that it was necessary to take Marcela with me.","I ran out, crazy. I spent two fatal hours wandering through the most distant and deserted neighborhoods, where it would have been hard to find me. I went along gnawing on my despair with a kind of morbid gluttony. I brought back the days, the hours, the instants of delirium, and now I was gratified in believing that they were eternal, that all of this was a nightmare. Deceiving myself now, I tried to push them away like a useless burden. Then I resolved to embark immediately in order to cut my life into two halves, and I pleased myself with the idea that Marcela, learning of my departure, would be tormented by longing and remorse. Since she’d been madly in love with me, she would have to feel something, some kind of remembrance, like that of Lieutenant Duarte … At that point the fangs of jealousy buried themselves in my heart. All of nature roared that I had to take Marcela with me.","I went out, beside myself; I spent two deadly hours wandering round the most far-flung and deserted neighborhoods, where I wouldn’t easily be found. I gnawed at my despair with a sort of morbid gluttony; I evoked every day, hour, and instant of rapture, first heartening myself with the thought that they were eternal and that all this was nothing more than a nightmare, and then deceiving myself, trying to shrug them off as a useless burden. Then I would resolve to set off at once, to cleave my life in two, and I delighted in the idea that Marcela would be consumed with longing and remorse when she heard of my departure. After all, she had loved me madly, so she must feel something, be left with some memory, like that of the sub-lieutenant . . .

"Note-se que eu estava em Veneza, ainda recendente aos versos de lord Byron;* lá estava, mergulhado em pleno sonho, revivendo o pretérito, crendo-me na Sereníssima República.

Cinquenta e cinco anos que pareciam quarenta, macia, risonha, vestígios de beleza, porte elegante e maneiras finas.

Os outros, não sabendo o que era, falavam, olhavam, gesticulavam, ao tempo que ela olhava só, ora fixa, ora móbil, levando a astúcia ao ponto de olhar às vezes para dentro de si, porque deixava cair as pálpebras; mas, como as pestanas eram rótulas, o olhar continuava o seu ofício, remexendo a alma e a vida dos outros.","Arriving on the street, I regretted having left.

The others, not knowing what it was, spoke, looked, gesticulated, while she looked alone, now fixed, now moving, taking her cunning to the point of sometimes looking inside herself, because she let her eyelids fall; but, as the eyelashes were kneecaps, the gaze continued its craft, rummaging through the soul and life of others.","Out on the street I was sorry I’d left.

At those times she would sit back in her chair, unsheathe her long, sharp vision, and take her ease. The others, not knowing what was going on, would talk, look, gesticulate, while she would simply look, sometimes staring, sometimes moving her eyes, carrying the ruse to the point of looking inside herself sometimes because she would let her eyelids droop but since eyelashes are lattices, her glance would continue its work, rummaging in the souls and lives of others.","As I stepped out onto the street, I regretted having left.

"Há cousas que melhor se dizem calando; tal é a matéria do capítulo anterior. Podem entendê-lo os ambiciosos malogrados. Se a paixão do poder é a mais forte de todas, como alguns inculcam, imaginem o desespero, a dor, o abatimento do dia em que perdi a cadeira da Câmara dos Deputados. Iam-se-me as esperanças todas; terminava a carreira política. E notem que o Quincas Borba, por induções filosóficas que fez, achou que a minha ambição não era a paixão verdadeira do poder, mas um capricho, um desejo de folgar. Na opinião dele, este sentimento, não sendo mais profundo que o outro, amofina muito mais, porque orça pelo amor que as mulheres têm às rendas e toucados. Um Cromwell ou um Bonaparte, acrescentava ele, por isso mesmo que os queima a paixão do poder, lá chegam à fina força ou pela escada da direita, ou pela da esquerda. Não era assim o meu sentimento; este, não tendo em si a mesma força, não tem a mesma certeza do resultado; e daí a maior aflição, o maior desencanto, a maior tristeza. O meu sentimento, segundo o Humanitismo…","There are things that are best said silently; such is the matter of the previous chapter. The unsuccessful ambitious can understand it. If the passion for power is the strongest of all, as some inculcate, imagine the despair, the pain, the dejection of the day I lost my seat in the Chamber of Deputies. All my hopes were gone; ended his political career. And notice that Quincas Borba, through philosophical inductions he made, thought that my ambition was not the true passion for power, but a whim, a desire to have fun. In his opinion, this feeling, not being more profound than the other, is much more irritating, because it is based on the love that women have for lace and headdresses. A Cromwell or a Bonaparte, he added, because even if the passion for power burns them, they arrive there by fine force either by the stairs on the right or by the ones on the left. That was not my feeling; the latter, not having the same strength in himself, is not so sure of the result; and hence the greatest affliction, the greatest disenchantment, the greatest sadness. My feeling, according to Humanitism…","There are things that are better said in silence. Such is the material of the previous chapter. Unsuccessful ambitious people will understand it. If the passion for power is the strongest of all, as some say, imagine the despair, the pain, the depression on the day I lost my seat in the Chamber of Deputies. All my hopes left: me, my political career was over. And take note that Quincas Borba, through philosophical inductions he made, found that my ambition wasn’t a true passion for power, but a whim, a desire to have some fun. In his opinion that feeling, no less profound than the other one, is much more vexing because it matches the love women have for lace and coiffures. A Cromwell or a Bonaparte, he added, for the very reason that they were burning with the passion for power, got there by sheer strength, either by the stairs on the right or the ones on the left. My feelings weren’t like that. Not having that same strength in themselves, they didn’t have certainty in the results and that was why there was greater affliction, greater disappointment, greater sadness. My feelings, according to Humanitism …","Some things are better said by falling silent; this is the case with the previous chapter. Those with dashed ambitions of their own may comprehend it. If the passion for power is the strongest of all, as some have said, then imagine my despair, pain, and dejection on the day I lost my seat in the Chamber of Deputies. All my hopes abandoned me; my political career was at an end. And mark that Quincas Borba, through philosophical inductions, concluded that my ambition was not a true passion for power but merely a whim, a desire to amuse myself. In his opinion, this sentiment, while not more profound, is much more bothersome, on par with women’s love of lace and finery. Cromwells or Bonapartes, he added, those who positively burn with the passion for power, will get there by force, by hook or by crook.

"Marcela franziu a testa, cantarolou uma seguidilha, entre dentes; depois queixou-se do calor, e mandou vir um copo de aluá. Trouxe-lho a mucama, numa salva de prata, que fazia parte dos meus onze contos. Marcela ofereceu-me polidamente o refresco; minha resposta foi dar com a mão no copo e na salva; entornou-se-lhe o líquido no regaço, a preta deu um grito, eu bradei-lhe que se fosse embora. Ficando a sós, derramei todo o desespero de meu coração; disse-lhe que ela era um monstro, que jamais me tivera amor, que me deixara descer a tudo, sem ter ao menos a desculpa da sinceridade; chamei-lhe muitos nomes feios, fazendo muitos gestos descompostos. Marcela deixara-se estar sentada, a estalar as unhas nos dentes, fria como um pedaço de mármore. Tive ímpetos de a estrangular, de a humilhar ao menos, subjugando-a a meus pés. Ia talvez fazê-lo; mas a ação trocou-se noutra; fui eu que me atirei aos pés dela, contrito e súplice; beijei-lhos, recordei aqueles meses da nossa felicidade solitária, repeti-lhe os nomes queridos de outro tempo, sentado no chão, com a cabeça entre os joelhos dela, apertando-lhe muito as mãos; ofegante, desvairado, pedi-lhe com lágrimas que me não desamparasse… Marcela esteve alguns instantes a olhar para mim, calados ambos, até que brandamente me desviou e, com um ar enfastiado: — Não me aborreça — disse.","Marcela frowned, hummed a follow-up, between her teeth; then he complained about the heat, and ordered a glass of aluá. The maid brought it to him, in a silver salver, which was part of my eleven contos. Marcela politely offered me the refreshment; my answer was to put my hand on the cup and on the sage; The liquid was spilled on her lap, the black woman screamed, I yelled at her to go away. Being alone, I poured out all the despair of my heart; I told her that she was a monster, that she had never loved me, that she had let me get down to everything, without even having the excuse of sincerity; I called him a lot of bad names, making a lot of awkward gestures. Marcela had remained seated, clicking her nails in her teeth, cold as a piece of marble. I had the urge to strangle her, to humiliate her at least, by subduing her to my feet. Perhaps he was going to; but the action changed into another; it was I who threw myself at her feet, contrite and pleading; I kissed them, I remembered those months of our solitary happiness, I repeated to her the dear names of another time, sitting on the floor, with his head between her knees, squeezing her hands very tightly; panting, frantic, I begged him with tears not to abandon me… Marcela stared at me for a few moments, both of them silent, until she gently turned me away and, with an air of boredom: —Don't bother me,” he said.","Marcela furrowed her brow, hummed a sequidilha, then complained about the heat and sent for a glass of pineapple wine. A slave girl brought it on a silver tray, which was part of my eleven cantos. Marcela politely offered me the refreshment. My answer was to strike the glass and the tray. The liquid spilled into her lap and the black girl cried out. I roared at her to get out. When we were alone I poured out all the despair in my heart. I told her that she was a monster, that she’d never loved me, that she’d let me drop down to the bottom without even the excuse of sincerity. I called her all sorts of ugly names, making wild gestures. Marcela kept herself seated, tapping her teeth with her nails, cold as a piece of marble. I had an urge to strangle her, humiliate her at least, make her crawl at my feet. Perhaps I would have, but my actions took the opposite turn: It was I who threw myself at her feet, contrite and supplicant. I kissed them, I remembered those months of our happiness alone together , I repeated our pet names from past times to her, sitting on the floor with my head between her knees, squeezing her hands, gasping, delirious, I begged her, tearfully, not to abandon me … Marcela sat looking at me for a few seconds, both of us silent, until she pushed me away softly and with an annoyed air. “Stop annoying me,” she said.","Marcela furrowed her brow and hummed a seguidilla through her teeth; then she complained of the heat and called for a cup of aluá. The slave brought it over on a silver tray, which was part of my eleven thousand milréis. Marcela politely offered me the sweet wine; my response was to slap the cup and the tray, whereupon the liquid spilled into her lap, the negress shrieked, and I bellowed at her to get out. Once we were alone, I poured out all the despair in my heart; I said she was a monster, that she’d never loved me, that she’d brought me this low without even the excuse of sincerity; I called her many an ugly name, to which I added wild gesticulation. Marcela let herself sit there, tapping a nail on her teeth, cold as a slab of marble. I felt the impulse to strangle her, or at least to humiliate her and see her grovel at my feet. I might have done so; but somehow the act become another; it was I who threw myself at her feet, contrite and beseeching; I kissed them, recalled the months of our private happiness, repeated the sweet names of old, sitting on the floor with my head between her knees, pressing her hands in mine; breathless, beside myself, I pled tearfully that she not forsake me . . . Marcela gazed at me for a moment or two, both of us silent, until she lightly turned me aside and said, with a weary air: “Stop pestering me.”"
"E assim reatamos o fio da aventura, como a sultana Scheherazade, o dos seus contos. Esse foi, cuido eu, o ponto máximo do nosso amor, o cimo da montanha, donde por algum tempo divisamos os vales de leste e de oeste, e por cima de nós, o céu tranquilo e azul. Repousado esse tempo, começamos a descer a encosta, com as mãos presas ou soltas, mas a descer, a descer…","And so we resume the thread of the adventure, like the sultana Scheherazade, that of her tales. That was, I think, the height of our love, the top of the mountain, from which for a time we could see the valleys to the east and west, and above us, the calm blue sky. After that time, we started to go down the slope, with our hands tied or loose, but going down, down…","And thus we picked up the thread of our adventure the same as the Sultaness Scheherezade had done with the thread of her stories. That was, to my mind, the high point of our love, the summit of the mountain from where, for a time, we could make out the valleys to the east and west and the tranquil blue sky above us. Having rested for that time, we began to descend the slope, holding hands or apart, but descending, descending …","And so we resumed the thread of adventure, just as the sultaness Scheherazade resumed the thread of her stories.1 This was, I believe, the crowning point of our love, the mountaintop from which, for some time, we gazed upon the valleys to our east and west, and above us the calm blue sky. Having rested for that time, we began to go down the slope, our hands clasped at times, unclasped at others, but always going down, down . . ."

"Vi que era impossível separar duas cousas que no espírito dela estavam inteiramente ligadas: o nosso amor e a consideração pública.

"Ai! Nem sempre dormir. Três semanas depois, indo à casa de Virgília — eram quatro horas da tarde —, achei-a triste e abatida. Não me quis dizer o que era; mas, como eu instasse muito: — Creio que o Damião desconfia alguma cousa. Noto agora umas esquisitices nele… Não sei… Trata-me bem, não há dúvida; mas o olhar parece que não é o mesmo. Durmo mal; ainda esta noite acordei, aterrada; estava sonhando que ele me ia matar.

"Oito dias depois, encontrei-a num baile; creio que chegamos a trocar duas ou três palavras. Mas noutro baile, dado daí a um mês, em casa de uma senhora que ornara os salões do Primeiro Reinado, e não desornava então os do Segundo, a aproximação foi maior e mais longa, porque conversamos e valsamos.

"No sétimo dia, acabada a missa fúnebre, travei de uma espingarda, alguns livros, roupa, charutos, um moleque — o Prudêncio do capítulo XI —, e fui meter-me numa velha casa de nossa propriedade. Meu pai forcejou por me torcer a resolução, mas eu é que não podia nem queria obedecer-lhe. Sabina desejava que eu fosse morar com ela algum tempo, duas semanas, ao menos; meu cunhado esteve a ponto de me levar à fina força. Era um bom rapaz este Cotrim; passara de estroina a circunspecto. Agora comerciava em gêneros de estiva, labutava de manhã até à noite, com ardor, com perseverança. De noite, sentado à janela, a encaracolar as suíças, não pensava em outra cousa. Amava a mulher e um filho, que então tinha, e que lhe morreu alguns anos depois. Diziam que era avaro.","On the seventh day, when the funeral mass was over, I grabbed a shotgun, some books, clothes, cigars, a kid—the Prudêncio in chapter XI—and went to stay in an old house on our property.

Sabina wanted me to move in with her for a while, two weeks at least; my brother-in-law was on the point of taking me by fine force. This Cotrim was a good boy; he had gone from sluggish to circumspect. Now he traded in stowage goods, toiled from morning to night, with ardour, with perseverance. At night, sitting by the window, curling his whiskers, he thought of nothing else. He loved his wife and a son, which he had then, and who died a few years later. They said he was greedy.","On the seventh day, when the funeral mass was over, I gathered together a shotgun, some books, clothing, cigars, a houseboy—the Prudêncio of Chapter XI—and went off to establish myself in an old house we owned.

"O caso de Virgília tinha alguma gravidade mais. Ela era menos escrupulosa que o marido: manifestava claramente as esperanças que trazia no legado, cumulava o parente de todas as cortesias, atenções e afagos que poderiam render, pelo menos, um codicilo. Propriamente, adulava-o; mas eu observei que a adulação das mulheres não é a mesma cousa que a dos homens. Esta orça pela servilidade; a outra confunde-se com a afeição. As formas graciosamente curvas, a palavra doce, a mesma fraqueza física dão à ação lisonjeira da mulher uma cor local, um aspecto legítimo. Não importa a idade do adulado; a mulher há de ter sempre para ele uns ares de mãe ou de irmã — ou ainda de enfermeira, outro ofício feminil, em que o mais hábil dos homens carecerá sempre de um quid, um fluido, alguma cousa.","Virgilia's case was a little more serious. She was less scrupulous than her husband: she clearly expressed the hopes she brought in the legacy, showered her relative with all the courtesies, attentions and caresses that could earn at least one codicil. Indeed, it flattered him; but I have observed that the adulation of women is not the same thing as that of men. This budgets for servitude; the other is confused with affection. The gracefully curved forms, the sweet word, the same physical weakness give the woman's flattering action a local color, a legitimate aspect. It does not matter how old the flattered is; a woman will always have the air of a mother or sister to him—or even that of a nurse, another feminine craft, in which the most skillful of men will always lack a quid, a fluid, something.","Virgília’s case was a bit more serious. She was less scrupulous than her husband. She openly showed the hope she had for the legacy, showering her relative with all manner of courtesies, attentions, and allurements that could bring on a codicil at the very least. Properly speaking, she flattered him, but I have observed that women’s flattery is not the same as that of men. The latter tends toward servility, the former is mingled with affection. The gracefully curved figure, the honeyed word, their very physical weakness give women’s flattery a local hue, a legitimate look. The age of the one being flattered doesn’t matter. A woman will always have a certain air of mother or sister for his—or even that of a nurse, another feminine position in which the most skillful of men will always lack a quid, a fluid, something.","Virgília’s case was slightly more serious. She was less scrupulous than her husband: she manifested her hopes of an inheritance quite clearly, heaping upon her relative enough courtesies, cares, and caresses to earn her at least a codicil. She fawned over him, to put it plainly; but I observed that women’s fawning is not the same as men’s. The latter lists toward servility; the former may be taken for affection. A charmingly curving figure, a sweet word, and even physical fragility lend women’s flattery a dash of local color, an air of legitimacy. No matter the age of the fawned over; the woman will always strike him as motherly or sisterly—or as a nurse, another feminine profession for which even the ablest of men will always lack some quid, some fluid, something else entirely."

"Compreendi que estava velho, e precisava de uma força; mas o Quincas Borba partira seis meses antes para Minas Gerais, e levou consigo a melhor das filosofias. Voltou quatro meses depois, e entrou-me em casa, certa manhã, quase no estado em que eu o vira no Passeio Público. A diferença é que o olhar era outro. Vinha demente. Contou-me que, para o fim de aperfeiçoar o Humanitismo, queimara o manuscrito todo e ia recomeçá-lo. A parte dogmática ficava completa, embora não escrita; era a verdadeira religião do futuro.","I understood that I was old, and I needed strength; but Quincas Borba had left six months earlier for Minas Gerais, and he took with him the best of philosophies.

"Se esse mundo não fosse uma região de espíritos desatentos, era escusado lembrar ao leitor que eu só afirmo certas leis, quando as possuo deveras; em relação a outras restrinjo-me à admissão da probabilidade. Um exemplo da segunda classe constitui o presente capítulo, cuja leitura recomendo a todas as pessoas que amam o estudo dos fenômenos sociais. Segundo parece, e não é improvável, existe entre os fatos da vida pública e os da vida particular uma certa ação recíproca, regular, e talvez periódica — ou, para usar de uma imagem, há alguma cousa semelhante às marés da praia do Flamengo e de outras igualmente marulhosas. Com efeito, quando a onda investe a praia, alaga-a muitos palmos adentro; mas essa mesma água torna ao mar, com variável força, e vai engrossar a onda que há de vir, e que terá de tornar como a primeira.

It seems, and it is not improbable, that between the facts of public life and those of private life there is a certain reciprocal, regular, and perhaps periodic action - or, to use an image, there is something similar to the tides of Flamengo beach and from others that are equally noisy. Indeed, when the wave invades the beach, it floods it many feet inland; but that same water returns to the sea, with varying force, and will swell the wave that is to come, and which will have to return like the first.

"Dito isto, peço licença para ir um dia destes expor-lhe um trabalho, fruto de longo estudo, um novo sistema de filosofia, que não só explica e descreve a origem e a consumação das cousas, como faz dar um grande passo adiante de Zenon e Sêneca, cujo estoicismo era um verdadeiro brinco de crianças ao pé da minha receita moral. É singularmente espantoso este meu sistema; retifica o espírito humano, suprime a dor, assegura a felicidade, e enche de imensa glória o nosso país.

"Ao soltar a última frase, D. Plácida teve um calafrio. Depois, como se tornasse a si, pareceu atentar na inconveniência daquela confissão ao amante de uma mulher casada, e começou a rir, a desdizer-se, a chamar-se tola, “cheia de fidúcias”, como lhe dizia a mãe; enfim, cansada do meu silêncio, retirou-se da sala. Eu fiquei a olhar para a ponta do botim.","When she released the last sentence, Dona Plácida shivered. Then, as if coming to her senses, she seemed to notice the inconvenience of that confession to the lover of a married woman, and began to laugh, to say something wrong, to call herself a fool, “full of trusts”, as her mother used to say to her; finally, tired of my silence, she withdrew from the room. I kept looking at the toe of the boot.","As she uttered the last phrase Dona Plácida shuddered. Then, as if recovered, she seemed to be worrying about the impropriety of that confession to the lover of a married woman and she began to laugh, retract, call herself silly, “full of beans,” as her mother used to tell her. Finally, tired of my silence, she left the room. I stayed there staring at my shoetops.","As she let out these last words, Dona Plácida shivered. Then, as if coming to her senses, she seemed to realize how unseemly it was to make such a confession to the lover of a married woman and began to laugh, go back on what she’d said, calling herself a fool, “full of airs,” as her mother said; finally, tiring of my silence, she withdrew from the room. I was left staring at the tip of my boot."
"— Para entender bem o meu sistema — concluiu ele —, importa não esquecer nunca o princípio universal, repartido e resumido em cada homem. Olha: a guerra, que parece uma calamidade, é uma operação conveniente, como se disséssemos o estalar dos dedos de Humanitas; a fome (e ele chupava filosoficamente a asa do frango), a fome é uma prova a que Humanitas submete a própria víscera. Mas eu não quero outro documento da sublimidade do meu sistema, senão este mesmo frango. Nutriu-se de milho, que foi plantado por um africano, suponhamos, importado de Angola. Nasceu esse africano, cresceu, foi vendido; um navio o trouxe, um navio construído de madeira cortada no mato por dez ou doze homens, levado por velas, que oito ou dez homens teceram, sem contar a cordoalha e outras partes do aparelho náutico. Assim, este frango, que eu almocei agora mesmo, é o resultado de uma multidão de esforços e lutas, executados com o único fim de dar mate* ao meu apetite.","— To understand my system well — he concluded — it is important never to forget the universal principle, divided and summarized in each man. Look: the war, which looks like a calamity, is a convenient operation, as if we were to say the snap of the fingers of Humanitas; hunger (and he philosophically sucked the chicken's wing), hunger is a test to which Humanitas submits its own innards. But I don't want any other document of the sublimity of my system, other than this same chicken. It fed on maize, which was planted by an African, let us suppose, imported from Angola. This African was born, grew up, was sold; a ship brought it, a ship built of wood cut in the bush by ten or twelve men, carried by sails, which eight or ten men wove, not counting the rope and other parts of the nautical apparatus. So this chicken, which I just had for lunch, is the result of a multitude of efforts and struggles, carried out with the sole aim of satisfying my appetite.","“In order to understand my system well,” he concluded, “it’s necessary never to forget the universal principle, distributed and summed up in every man. Look. War, which looks like a calamity, is a convenient operation, which we could call the snapping of Humanitas’ fingers; hunger (and he sucked philosophically on his chicken wing), hunger is proof that Humanitas is subject to its own entrails. But I don’t need any other documentation of the sublimity of my system than this chicken right here. It nourished itself on corn, which was planted by an African, let us suppose imported from Angola. That African was born, grew up, was sold. A ship brought him here, a ship built of wood cut in the forest by ten or twelve men, propelled by sails that eight or ten men sewed together, not to mention the rigging and other parts of the nautical apparatus. In that way, this chicken, which I have lunched on just now, is the result of a multitude of efforts and struggles carried out with the sole aim of satisfying my appetite.”","“To understand my system properly,” he concluded, “one must never forget the universal principle, which is divided and epitomized in each man. Look: war, which seems a calamity, is a useful operation, which we might call Humanitas cracking its knuckles; hunger (at this he sucked philosophically on the chicken wing), hunger is a test to which Humanitas sets its very entrails. But I need no more demonstration of the sublimity of my system than this very chicken. It fed on corn, which was planted by an African—imported from Angola, let’s say. That African was born, grew up, and was sold; a ship brought him here, a ship built from wood cut down in the forest by some ten or twelve men, borne on sails sewn by some eight or ten men, to say nothing of the rigging and other elements of the nautical apparatus. Thus, this chicken, which I have just had for lunch, is the result of a multitude of efforts and struggles, executed with the sole aim of checkmating my hunger.”"

"Naquele dia, a árvore dos Cubas brotou uma graciosa flor. Nasci; recebeu-me nos braços a Pascoela, insigne parteira minhota, que se gabava de ter aberto a porta do mundo a uma geração inteira de fidalgos. Não é impossível que meu pai lhe ouvisse tal declaração; creio, todavia, que o sentimento paterno é que o induziu a gratificá-la com duas meias dobras.

"Saí do grupo, que me olhava espantado e cochichava as suas conjecturas. Segui caminho, a desfiar uma infinidade de reflexões, que sinto haver inteiramente perdido; aliás, seria matéria para um bom capítulo, e talvez alegre. Eu gosto dos capítulos alegres; é o meu fraco. Exteriormente, era torvo o episódio do Valongo; mas só exteriormente. Logo que meti mais dentro a faca do raciocínio achei-lhe um miolo gaiato, fino, e até profundo. Era um modo que o Prudêncio tinha de se desfazer das pancadas recebidas — transmitindo-as a outro. Eu, em criança, montava-o, punha-lhe um freio na boca, e desancava-o sem compaixão; ele gemia e sofria. Agora, porém, que era livre, dispunha de si mesmo, dos braços, das pernas, podia trabalhar, folgar, dormir, desagrilhoado da antiga condição, agora é que ele se desbancava: comprou um escravo, e ia-lhe pagando, com alto juro, as quantias que de mim recebera. Vejam as subtilezas do maroto!","I left the group, who were looking at me in astonishment and whispering their conjectures. I continued on my way, unraveling an infinity of reflections, which I feel I have completely lost; in fact, it would be the subject of a good chapter, and perhaps a happy one. I like the lighthearted chapters; is my weakness. Outwardly, the Valongo episode was murky; but only externally. As soon as I put the knife of reasoning deeper inside, I found it to be a playful, thin, and even deep brain. It was Prudencio's way of getting rid of the blows he had received — transmitting them to someone else. As a child, I would ride him, put a bit in his mouth, and beat him without compassion; he groaned and suffered. Now, however, that he was free, he had himself, his arms, his legs, he could work, play, sleep, unfettered by his old condition, now he was overthrown: he bought a slave, and he was paying him, at a high price. swear, the sums he had received from me. See the subtleties of the marauder!","I left the crowd of people who were looking at me with wonder and whispering conjectures. I went on my way, unraveling an infinite number of reflections that I think I’ve lost completely. They would have been material for a good and maybe happy chapter.

As soon as I stuck the knife of rationality deeper into it I found it to have a happy, delicate, and even profound marrow. It was the way Prudêncio had to rid himself of the beatings he’d received by transmitting them to someone else.

Now that he was free, however, he had the free use of himself, his arms, his legs, he could work, rest, sleep unfettered from his previous status. Now he could make up for everything. He bought a slave and was paying him back with high interest the amount he’d received from me. Just look at the subtlety of the rogue!","I left the crowd, which looked at me in astonishment and muttered conjectures.

As soon as I slid the knife of reasoning farther in, I found a marrow that was mischievous, refined, even profound.

"Para mim era aquilo uma situação nova do nosso amor, uma aparência de posse exclusiva, de domínio absoluto, alguma cousa que me faria adormecer a consciência e resguardar o decoro. Já estava cansado das cortinas do outro, das cadeiras, do tapete, do canapé, de todas essas cousas, que me traziam aos olhos constantemente a nossa duplicidade. Agora podia evitar os jantares frequentes, o chá de todas as noites, enfim a presença do filho deles, meu cúmplice e meu inimigo. A casa resgatava-me tudo; o mundo vulgar terminaria à porta; dali para dentro era o infinito, um mundo eterno, superior, excepcional, nosso, somente nosso, sem leis, sem instituições, sem baronesas, sem olheiros, sem escutas — um só mundo, um só casal, uma só vida, uma só vontade, uma só afeição —, a unidade moral de todas as cousas pela exclusão das que me eram contrárias.","For me this was a new situation in our love, an appearance of exclusive possession, of absolute dominion, something that would put my conscience to sleep and protect my decorum.

"Mas é sestro antigo da Sandice criar amor às casas alheias, de modo que, apenas senhora de uma, dificilmente lha farão despejar. É sestro; não se tira daí; há muito que lhe calejou a vergonha. Agora, se advertirmos no imenso número de casas que ocupa, umas de vez, outras durante as suas estações calmosas, concluiremos que esta amável peregrina é o terror dos proprietários. No nosso caso, houve quase um distúrbio à porta do meu cérebro, porque a adventícia não queria entregar a casa, e a dona não cedia da intenção de tomar o que era seu. Afinal, já a Sandice se contentava com um cantinho no sótão.","But it's Sandice's old skill to create love in other people's houses, so that, just the lady of one, it's difficult to make her evict. It is sestro; it is not taken from there; shame has long been calloused to him. Now, if we notice the immense number of houses that it occupies, some at once, others during its calm seasons, we will conclude that this amiable pilgrim is the terror of the owners. In our case, there was almost a disturbance at the door of my brain, because the adventitia didn't want to give up the house, and the owner didn't give in to her intention to take what was hers. After all, Sandice was content with a corner in the attic.","There’s no getting rid of her. She was hardened to shame a long time ago. Now, if we take note of the huge number of houses she occupies—some permanently, others during their periods of calm—we will conclude that this affable wanderer is the terror of householders. In our case there was almost a commotion at the door to my brain because the intruder didn’t want to relinquish the house and the owner wouldn’t give up her intention of taking what was hers. In the end Folly contented herself with a small corner of the attic.","But Folly has an old habit of becoming accustomed to houses that are not her own; once she has made herself at home, it is no easy task to expel her. Force of habit; she won’t be removed; she grew hardened to shame long ago. Now, if we look to the immense number of houses that she occupies, some for good, others only during the summertime, we may conclude that this charming wanderer is the veritable bane of householders.

"Desde os cinco anos merecera eu a alcunha de “menino diabo”; e verdadeiramente não era outra cousa; fui dos mais malignos do meu tempo, arguto, indiscreto, traquinas e voluntarioso. Por exemplo, um dia quebrei a cabeça de uma escrava, porque me negara uma colher do doce de coco que estava fazendo, e, não contente com o malefício, deitei um punhado de cinza ao tacho, e, não satisfeito da travessura, fui dizer à minha mãe que a escrava é que estragara o doce “por pirraça”; e eu tinha apenas seis anos. Prudêncio, um moleque de casa, era o meu cavalo de todos os dias; punha as mãos no chão, recebia um cordel nos queixos, à guisa de freio, eu trepava-lhe ao dorso, com uma varinha na mão, fustigava-o, dava mil voltas a um e outro lado, e ele obedecia — algumas vezes gemendo —, mas obedecia sem dizer palavra, ou, quando muito, um “Ai, nhonhô!”, ao que eu retorquia: “Cala a boca, besta!”. Esconder os chapéus das visitas, deitar rabos de papel a pessoas graves, puxar pelo rabicho das cabeleiras, dar beliscões nos braços das matronas, e outras muitas façanhas deste jaez, eram mostras de um gênio indócil, mas devo crer que eram também expressões de um espírito robusto, porque meu pai tinha-me em grande admiração; e se às vezes me repreendia, à vista de gente, fazia-o por simples formalidade: em particular dava-me beijos.","From the age of five I had earned the nickname ""devil boy""; and truly it was nothing else; I was one of the most evil of my time, shrewd, indiscreet, mischievous and willful. For example, one day I broke a slave's head, because she had refused me a spoonful of the coconut candy she was making, and, not content with the harm, I poured a handful of ashes into the pot, and, not satisfied with the mischief, went to say to my mother, the slave, who had spoiled the candy “out of temper”; and I was only six years old. Prudêncio, a kid at home, was my everyday horse; he would put his hands on the floor, receive a string on his chin, as a brake, I would climb his back, with a wand in my hand, I would whip him, turn a thousand times this way and that, and he would obey—sometimes groaning. — but he obeyed without saying a word, or, at the most, a “Oh, nhonhô!”, to which I retorted: “Shut up, beast!”. Hiding visitors' hats, throwing paper tails at serious people, pulling the tail of their hair, pinching the arms of matrons, and many other feats of this kind, were signs of an unruly genius, but I must believe that they were also expressions of a robust spirit, because my father held me in great admiration; and if he sometimes scolded me in front of people, he did it out of simple formality: in private he gave me kisses.","From the age of five I’d earned the nickname of “Devil Child,” and I really was just that. I was one of the most malevolent children of my time, evasive, nosey, mischievous, and willful. For example, one day I split open the head of a slave because she’d refused to give me a spoonful of the cocoanut confection she was making and, not content with that evil deed, I threw a handful of ashes into the bowl and, not satisfied with that mischief, I ran to tell my mother that the slave was the one who’d ruined the dish out of spite. And I was only six years old. Prudêncio, a black houseboy, was my horse every day. He’d get down on his hands and knees, take a cord in his mouth as a bridle, and I’d climb onto his back with a switch in my hand. I would whip him, make him do a thousand turns, left and right, and he would obey—sometimes moaning—but he would obey without saying a word or, at most, an—“Ouch, little master!”—to which I would retort, “Shut your mouth, animal!” Hiding visitors’ hats, pinning paper tails on dignified people, pulling pigtails, pinching matrons on the arm, and many other deeds of that sort were the sign of a restive nature, but I have to believe that they were also the expressions of a robust spirit, because my father held me in great admiration, and if at times he scolded me in the presence of people , he did it as a mere formality. In private he would give me kisses.","From age five I had earned the nickname “devil child,” and it was truly fitting; I was one of the wickedest of my time, cunning, bold, troublesome, and headstrong. For example, one day I broke the head of a slave because she had refused to give me a spoonful of the coconut sweet she was making, and, not content with the deed, I threw a handful of ashes in the pot, and, not satisfied with that mischief, I went and told my mother that the slave had ruined the sweet “out of spite”; and this at age six. Prudêncio, one of our slave boys, was the horse I rode around on; with his hands on the ground and a length of string between his teeth by way of a bit, I would climb astride his back with a little switch in hand, whipping him, riding up and down and around, and he would obey, moaning at times, but obeying without a word, or at most an “Ow, little master!” to which I would retort, “Shut your mouth, beast!” Hiding visitors’ hats, pinning paper tails on dignified people, pulling the pigtails of their wigs, pinching matrons’ arms, and many other feats of the same sort were signs of an unruly temperament, but I must be sure that they were also expressions of a robust spirit, as my father esteemed me greatly; if he ever reprehended me in the sight of others, it was out of pure formality: in private, he would cover me with kisses."

Pareceu-me então (e peço perdão à crítica, se este meu juízo for temerário!), pareceu-me que ele tinha medo — não medo de mim, nem de si, nem do código, nem da consciência; tinha medo da opinião. Supus que esse tribunal anônimo e invisível, em que cada membro acusa e julga, era o limite posto à vontade do Lobo Neves. Talvez já não amasse a mulher; e, assim, pode ser que o coração fosse estranho à indulgência dos seus últimos atos. Cuido (e de novo insto pela boa vontade da crítica!), cuido que ele estaria pronto a separar-se da mulher, como o leitor se terá separado de muitas relações pessoais; mas a opinião, essa opinião que lhe arrastaria a vida por todas as ruas, que abriria minucioso inquérito acerca do caso, que coligiria uma a uma todas as circunstâncias, antecedências, induções, provas, que as relataria na palestra das chácaras desocupadas, essa terrível opinião, tão curiosa das alcovas, obstou à dispersão da família. Ao mesmo tempo tornou impossível o desforço, que seria a divulgação. Ele não podia mostrar-se ressentido comigo, sem igualmente buscar a separação conjugal; teve então de simular a mesma ignorância de outrora, e, por dedução, iguais sentimentos.","But it was written that this day must be the day of dubious bids. A few hours later, I met Lobo Neves, on Ouvidor Street; we talk about the presidency and politics. He took advantage of the first acquaintance that passed us by the side, and left me, after many compliments. It reminds me that I was withdrawn, but with a withdrawal that I struggled to conceal. It seemed to me then (and I apologize for the criticism, if my judgment is rash!), it seemed to me that he was afraid—not afraid of me, not of himself, not of the code, not of conscience; I was afraid of the opinion. I assumed that this anonymous and invisible court, in which each member accuses and judges, was the limit placed on Lobo Neves' will. Perhaps he no longer loved the woman; and so it may be that the heart was foreign to the indulgence of his last acts. I take care (and again I urge the goodwill of the critic!), I take care that he would be ready to separate from his wife, as the reader will have separated himself from many personal relationships; but the opinion, that opinion that would drag his life through all the streets, that would open a detailed inquiry into the case, that would collect one by one all the circumstances, antecedents, inductions, proofs, which would relate them in the lecture of the vacant farms, that terrible opinion, so curious of the alcoves, prevented the dispersion of the family. At the same time, it made the effort, which would be disclosure, impossible. He could not be resentful of me without also seeking marital separation; then he had to simulate the same ignorance as before, and, by deduction, the same feelings.","But it was written that the day was to be one of dubious moves. A few hours later I ran into Lobo Neves on the Rua do Ouvidor. We talked about the presidency and politics. He took advantage of the first acquaintance who passed and left me after all manner of pleasant words. I remember that he was withdrawn, but it was a withdrawal he was struggling to hide. It seemed to me then (and may the critics forgive me if this judgment of mine is too bold), it seemed to me that he was afraid—not afraid of me, or of himself, or of the law, or of his conscience. He was afraid of public opinion. I imagined that that anonymous and invisible tribunal in which every member accuses and judges was the limit set for Lobo Neves’ will. Maybe he didn’t love his wife anymore and therefore it was possible that his heart was indifferent in its indulgence of her latest acts. I think (and again I beg the critics’ good will) , I think he was probably prepared to break with his wife, as the reader has probably broken with many personal relationships, but public opinion, that opinion which would drag his life along all the streets, would open a minute investigation into the matter, would put together, one by one, all circumstances, antecedents, inductions, proofs, would talk about them in idle backyard conversations, that terrible public opinion, so curious about bedrooms, stood in the way of a family breakup. At the same time, it made vengeance, which would be an admission, impossible. He couldn’t appear resentful toward me without also seeking a conjugal breakup. Therefore he had to pretend the same ignorance as before and, by deduction, similar feelings.","But it was written: that day was to be one of obscure incidents. A few hours later, I came across Lobo Neves on the Rua do Ouvidor; we spoke of the presidency and of politics. He seized on the first acquaintance who drifted by and left me, after many warm greetings. I recall that he was reserved, but struggling to disguise that reserve. It struck me then (and may the critics forgive me if this judgment should prove presumptuous!) , it struck me that he was afraid—not of me, or himself, or the law, or his conscience; he was afraid of public opinion. I surmised that this anonymous, invisible court, in which each member both prosecutes and judges, was the check on Lobo Neves’s free will. Perhaps he no longer loved his wife; his heart might have been cold to the indulgence of his latest actions. I believe (again, I must appeal to the goodwill of the critics!) , I believe that he would be willing to break with his wife, as the reader must have broken off many personal relations; but public opinion—that opinion which would drag his life through every street, open up a painstaking inquiry into the case, gather each detail, precedent, inference, and piece of evidence, one by one, and relate them in idle sitting-room conversations, that fearsome public opinion, with its fascination for bedrooms—stood in the way of the dissolution of the family. At the same time, it made revenge impossible, for it would mean revealing all to the world. He could not show his resentment of me without seeking a marital separation; so he was forced to simulate his prior ignorance, as well as the same sentiments he had harbored then."

"Sabido que reli a carta, antes e depois do almoço, sabido fica que almocei, e só resta dizer que essa refeição foi das mais parcas da minha vida: um ovo, uma fatia de pão, uma xícara de chá. Não me esqueceu esta circunstância mínima; no meio de tanta cousa importante obliterada escapou esse almoço. A razão principal poderia ser justamente o meu desastre; mas não foi; a principal razão foi a reflexão que me fez o Quincas Borba, cuja visita recebi naquele dia. Disse-me ele que a frugalidade não era necessária para entender o Humanitismo, e menos ainda praticá-lo; que esta filosofia acomodava-se facilmente com os prazeres da vida, inclusive a mesa, o espetáculo e os amores; e que, ao contrário, a frugalidade podia indicar certa tendência para o ascetismo, o qual era a expressão acabada da tolice humana.","Knowing that I reread the letter, before and after lunch, it is known that I had lunch, and I can only say that this meal was one of the most meager of my life: an egg, a slice of bread, a cup of tea. I have not forgotten this minimal circumstance; in the midst of so much obliterated important stuff this lunch escaped. The main reason could just be my disaster; but it was not; the main reason was the reflection given to me by Quincas Borba, whose visit I received that day. He told me that frugality was not necessary to understand Humanitism, still less to practice it; that this philosophy was easily accommodated with the pleasures of life, including the table, the spectacle and love; and that, on the contrary, frugality could indicate a certain tendency towards asceticism, which was the finished expression of human folly.","Since it’s known that I reread the letter before and after breakfast, it’s known, therefore, that I had breakfast, and all that remains to be said is that the breakfast was one of the most frugal of my life: an egg, a slice of bread, a cup of tea. I haven’t forgotten that small circumstance. In the midst of so many important things that were obliterated, that breakfast escaped. The main reason might have been my disaster, but it wasn’t. The main reason was a reflection made to me by Quincas Borba, who visited me that day. He told me that frugality wasn’t necessary in order to understand Humanitism, much less to practice it. That philosophy enjoyed easy accommodation with the pleasures of life, including table, theatre, and love, and that, quite the contrary, frugality could be an indication of a certain tendency toward asceticism, which was the perfect expression of human idiocy.","It being known that I reread the letter before and after breakfast, one may deduce that I breakfasted, and all that remains to say is that this was one of the most sparing meals of my life: an egg, a slice of bread, a cup of tea. I did not forget this tiny detail; amidst so many important things which were obliterated, that breakfast was saved. The principal reason might have been precisely my misfortune; but it was not; the principal reason was the reflection I heard from Quincas Borba, who visited me that day. He told me that frugality was not necessary to understand Humanitism, much less to practice it; that this philosophy was easily reconciled with the pleasures of life, including the table, the theater, and love; and that, indeed, frugality might indicate a certain tendency toward asceticism, which was the fullest expression of human foolishness."

"Vaguei pelas ruas e recolhi-me às nove horas. Não podendo dormir, atirei-me a ler e escrever. Às onze horas estava arrependido de não ter ido ao teatro, consultei o relógio, quis vestir-me, e sair. Julguei, porém, que chegaria tarde; demais, era dar prova de fraqueza. Evidentemente, Virgília começava a aborrecer-se de mim, pensava eu. E esta ideia fez-me sucessivamente desesperado e frio, disposto a esquecê-la e a matá-la. Via-a dali mesmo, reclinada no camarote, com os seus magníficos braços nus — os braços que eram meus, só meus —, fascinando os olhos de todos, com o vestido soberbo que havia de ter, o colo de leite, os cabelos postos em bandós, à maneira do tempo, e os brilhantes, menos luzidios que os olhos dela… Via-a assim, e doía-me que a vissem outros. Depois, começava a despi-la, a pôr de lado as joias e sedas, a despenteá-la com as minhas mãos sôfregas e lascivas, a torná-la — não sei se mais bela, se mais natural —, a torná-la minha, somente minha, unicamente minha.","I wandered the streets and retired at nine o'clock. Unable to sleep, I threw myself into reading and writing. At eleven o'clock I was sorry I hadn't gone to the theater, I looked at my watch, wanted to get dressed, and go out. I thought, however, that I would be late; too much was to show weakness. Evidently Virgilia was beginning to get annoyed with me, I thought. And this idea made me successively desperate and cold, ready to forget her and kill her. I could see her from there, reclining in the cabin, with her magnificent bare arms—the arms that were mine, mine alone—fascinating everyone's eyes, with the superb dress she was bound to wear, her lap of milk, her hair put on. in bands, in the manner of time, and the shiny ones, less shiny than her eyes… I saw her like that, and it hurt me that others saw her. Then I began to undress her, to put aside the jewels and silks, to ruffle her hair with my greedy and lascivious hands, to make her—I don't know if more beautiful, if more natural—to make her mine. , only mine, only mine.","I wandered through the streets and retired at nine o’clock.

"Vejam agora a que excessos pode levar uma inadvertência; doeu-me um pouco a cegueira da epidemia que, matando à direita e à esquerda, levou também uma jovem dama, que tinha de ser minha mulher; não cheguei a entender a necessidade da epidemia, menos ainda, daquela morte. Creio até que esta me pareceu ainda mais absurda que todas as outras mortes. Quincas Borba, porém, explicou-me que epidemias eram úteis à espécie, embora desastrosas para uma certa porção de indivíduos; fez-me notar que, por mais horrendo que fosse o espetáculo, havia uma vantagem de muito peso: a sobrevivência do maior número. Chegou a perguntar-me se, no meio do luto geral, não sentia eu algum secreto encanto em ter escapado às garras da peste; mas esta pergunta era tão insensata, que ficou sem resposta.","See now what excesses can lead to inadvertence; The blindness of the epidemic hurt me a little, which, killing on the right and on the left, also took away a young lady, who had to be my wife; I didn't understand the need for the epidemic, even less for that death. I even believe that this one seemed even more absurd than all the other deaths. Quincas Borba, however, explained to me that epidemics were useful to the species, although disastrous for a certain portion of individuals; made me notice that, as horrendous as the spectacle was, there was one very weighty advantage: the survival of the greatest number. He even asked me if, in the midst of general mourning, I didn't feel some secret charm at having escaped the clutches of the plague; but this question was so foolish that it went unanswered.","See now how excesses can lead to unawareness. I was pained a little by the blindness of the epidemic that was killing right and left and also carried off a young lady who was to be my wife.

"Um grande futuro! Enquanto esta palavra me batia no ouvido, devolvia eu os olhos, ao longe, no horizonte misterioso e vago. Uma ideia expelia outra, a ambição desmontava Marcela. Grande futuro? Talvez naturalista, literato, arqueólogo, banqueiro, político, ou até bispo — bispo que fosse —, uma vez que fosse um cargo, uma preeminência, uma grande reputação, uma posição superior. A ambição, dado que fosse águia, quebrou nessa ocasião o ovo, e desvendou a pupila fulva e penetrante. Adeus, amores! Adeus, Marcela! Dias de delírio, joias sem preço, vida sem regímen, adeus! Cá me vou às fadigas e à glória; deixo-vos com as calcinhas da primeira idade.","A great future! As this word hit my ear, I looked back at the eyes, far away, on the mysterious and vague horizon.

Maybe a naturalist, a literary man, an archeologist, a banker, a politician, or even a bishop—let it be a bishop—as long as it meant responsibility, preeminence, a fine reputation, a superior position. Ambition, since it was an eagle, had broken the shell of its egg on that occasion and removed the cover from that tawny, penetrating eye. Farewell, love! Farewell, Marcela! Days of delirium, priceless jewels, ungoverned life, farewell! Here I come for toil and glory. I leave you with the short pants of childhood.","A great future!

"Recuei espantado. Quem me dera agora o verbo solene de um Bossuet ou de Vieira, para contar tamanha desolação! Era o Quincas Borba, o gracioso menino de outro tempo, o meu companheiro de colégio, tão inteligente e abastado. Quincas Borba! Não; impossível; não pode ser. Não podia acabar de crer que essa figura esquálida, essa barba pintada de branco, esse maltrapilho avelhentado, que toda essa ruína fosse o Quincas Borba. Mas era. Os olhos tinham um resto da expressão de outro tempo, e o sorriso não perdera certo ar escarninho, que lhe era peculiar. Entretanto, ele suportava com firmeza o meu espanto. No fim de algum tempo arredei os olhos; se a figura repelia, a comparação acabrunhava.","I recoiled in astonishment. I now wish I had the solemn word of a Bossuet or Vieira, to tell of such desolation! It was Quincas Borba, the graceful boy from another time, my schoolmate, so intelligent and wealthy. Quincas Borba! No; impossible; it can not be. I couldn't stop believing that that scrawny figure, that white-painted beard, that aged ragamuffin, that all that ruin was Quincas Borba. But was. The eyes had a remnant of the expression of another time, and the smile had not lost a certain sneer that was peculiar to him. However, he steadfastly bore my astonishment. After a while I rolled my eyes; if the figure repelled, the comparison was overwhelming.","I drew back in astonishment… If only I’d been given the solemn speech of a Bossuet or a Vieira to describe such desolation! It was Quincas Borba, the amusing boy of times gone by and my schoolmate, so intelligent and so well-off. Quincas Borba! No, impossible. It couldn’t be. I couldn’t come to believe that this filthy figure, this beard tinted with white, this aging tatterdemalion, all that ruination was Quincas Borba. But it was.

I could not believe that this squalid figure, this white-spattered beard, this aged tatterdemalion, this ruin of a man, was Quincas Borba. But it was.

"Realmente, sentia-me aborrecido, incomodado, com o pedido de Virgília. Tinha dado a D. Plácida cinco contos de réis; duvido muito que ninguém fosse mais generoso do que eu, nem tanto. Cinco contos! E que fizera deles? Naturalmente botou-os fora, comeu-os em grandes festas, e agora toca para a Misericórdia, e eu que a leve! Morre-se em qualquer parte. Acresce que eu não sabia ou não me lembrava do tal beco das Escadinhas; mas, pelo nome, parecia-me algum recanto estreito e escuro da cidade. Tinha de lá ir, chamar a atenção dos vizinhos, bater à porta, etc. Que maçada! Não vou.","Really, I felt annoyed, uncomfortable, with Virgilia's request. He had given Dona Plácida five contos de réis; I doubt very much that anyone was more generous than I, not even that. Five tales! And what had he done with them? Naturally he threw them away, ate them at great parties, and now it's time for Mercy, and I'll take it! Die anywhere. In addition, I didn't know or didn't remember the alley of Escadinhas; but from its name it seemed to me to be some dark, narrow corner of the city. I had to go there, get the neighbors' attention, knock on the door, etc. How boring! I am not going.","I felt really bothered, annoyed with Virgília’s request. I’d given Dona Plácida five contos. I doubt very much that anyone had been more generous than I, or even equally as generous. Five contos! And what had she done with them? She’d thrown them away, naturally, squandered them on big parties, and now she’s ready for Misericórdia and I’m the one to get her in! You can die anywhere. Furthermore, I didn’t know or didn’t recall any Beco das Escadinhas. But judging from its name as an alley I imagined it to be some dark and narrow corner of the city. I would have to go there, attract neighbors’ attention, knock on the door and all that. What a nuisance! I’m not going.","Indeed, I was quite vexed, bothered by Virgília’s request. I had given Dona Plácida five thousand milréis; I highly doubted that anyone could be more generous than I was, even close to it. Five thousand! And what had she done with them? She’d thrown them away, of course, squandered them on great parties, and now it was off to the Misericórdia, and I was to take her! A body may die anywhere at all. Besides, I didn’t know if I remembered where this Escadinhas Alley was; but to judge by the name, it was probably some cramped, dark corner of the city.1 I’d have to go there, be the object of the neighbors’ attention, knock on doors, et cetera. What a nuisance! I won’t go."

"E ria, de um riso grosso, rasteiro e frívolo. Sabina olhou para mim receosa de alguma réplica; mas sorriu, quando me viu sorrir, e voltou o rosto para disfarçá-lo. As outras pessoas olhavam-me com um ar de curiosidade, indulgência e simpatia; era transparente que não acabavam de ouvir nenhuma novidade. O caso dos meus amores andava mais público do que eu podia supor. Entretanto sorri, um sorriso curto, fugitivo e guloso — palreiro como as pegas de Sintra.* Virgília era um belo erro, e é tão fácil confessar um belo erro! Costumava ficar carrancudo, a princípio, quando ouvia alguma alusão aos nossos amores; mas — palavra de honra! — sentia cá dentro uma impressão suave e lisonjeira. Uma vez, porém, aconteceu-me sorrir, e continuei a fazê-lo das outras vezes. Não sei se há aí alguém que explique o fenômeno. Eu explico-o assim: a princípio, o contentamento, sendo interior, era por assim dizer o mesmo sorriso, mas abotoado; andando o tempo, desabotoou-se em flor, e apareceu aos olhos do próximo. Simples questão de botânica.","And he laughed, a thick, shallow, frivolous laugh. Sabina looked at me, wary of a retort; but he smiled, when he saw me smile, and turned his face away to hide it. The other people looked at me with an air of curiosity, indulgence and sympathy; it was transparent that they hadn't just heard anything new. The affair of my loves was more public than I could have imagined. However, he smiles, a short, fleeting, greedy smile — chattering like Sintra's magpies.* Virgília was a beautiful mistake, and it's so easy to confess a beautiful mistake! I used to frown at first when I heard some allusion to our loves; but — word of honour! I felt a soft, flattering impression inside. Once, however, I happened to smile, and I continued to do so the other times. I don't know if anyone out there can explain the phenomenon. I explain it like this: at first, contentment, being interior, was, so to speak, the same smile, but buttoned up; As time passed, he unbuttoned himself in flower, and appeared in the eyes of his neighbour. Simple question of botany.","And he laughed, a gross, vulgar, frivolous laugh. Sabina looked at me, fearful of some reply. But she smiled when she saw me smile and turned her face to hide it. The other people looked at me with expressions of curiosity, indulgence, and sympathy. It was quite obvious that they hadn’t heard anything new. The matter of my love affair was more public than I could have imagined. Nevertheless, I smiled a quick, fugitive, swallowing smile—chattering like the Sintra magpies. Virgília was a beautiful mistake, and it’s so easy to confess a beautiful mistake! At first I was accustomed to scowl when I heard some reference to our love affair, but—word of honor—inside I had a warm and flattered feeling. Once, however, I happened to smile and I continued doing so on other occasions. I don’t know if there’s anyone who can explain the phenomenon. I explain it this way: in the beginning the contentment, being inner, was, in a manner of speaking, that same smile but only a bud. With the passage of time the flower bloomed and appeared for the eyes of others. A simple matter of botany.","And he laughed, a coarse, contemptible, frivolous laugh. Sabina looked at me, fearing some retort; but when she saw me smile, she smiled as well, then turned away to hide it. The others looked at me with an air of curiosity, indulgence, and sympathy; it was clear that they had heard nothing new. My affair was more public than I could have imagined. Nevertheless, I smiled, a brief, fleeting, greedy smile—as garrulous as the gossiping magpies of Sintra.1 Virgília was a beautiful transgression, and it is so easy to confess a beautiful transgression! At first I grew surly when I heard allusions to our love; but— I swear to you!—I felt a soft, flattering sensation inside. Once it so happened that I smiled, and I kept on doing so on subsequent occasions. I do not know whether anyone can explain this phenomenon. My explanation is as follows: my contentment, for as long as it remained within me, was itself a smile, but a smile in the bud. As time went on, it bloomed into flower and appeared to the eyes of others. A simple matter of botany."

Eu amava minha mãe; tinha ainda diante dos olhos as circunstâncias da última bênção que ela me dera, a bordo do navio. “Meu triste filho, nunca mais te verei”, soluçava a pobre senhora apertando-me ao peito. E essas palavras ressoavam-me agora, como uma profecia realizada.","After some years of pilgrimage, I answered my father's pleas: “Come”, he said in his last letter; ""if you don't come quickly, you'll find your mother dead!"" This last word was a blow to me. I loved my mother; I still had before my eyes the circumstances of the last blessing she had given me aboard the ship. “My sad son, I will never see you again”, sobbed the poor lady, clutching me to her breast. And those words resonated with me now, like a fulfilled prophecy.","After some years of wandering I heeded my father’s entreaties: “Come home,” he said in his last letter, “if you don’t come quickly you’ll find your mother dead!” That last word was a blow to me.

"E vejam agora com que destreza, com que arte faço eu a maior transição deste livro. Vejam: o meu delírio começou em presença de Virgília; Virgília foi o meu grão pecado da juventude; não há juventude sem meninice; meninice supõe nascimento; e eis aqui como chegamos nós, sem esforço, ao dia 20 de outubro de 1805, em que nasci. Viram? Nenhuma juntura aparente, nada que divirta a atenção pausada do leitor: nada. De modo que o livro fica assim com todas as vantagens do método, sem a rigidez do método. Na verdade, era tempo. Que isto de método, sendo, como é, uma cousa indispensável, todavia é melhor tê-lo sem gravata nem suspensórios, mas um pouco à fresca e à solta, como quem não se lhe dá da vizinha fronteira, nem do inspetor de quarteirão. É como a eloquência, que há uma genuína e vibrante, de uma arte natural e feiticeira, e outra tesa, engomada e chocha. Vamos ao dia 20 de outubro.","And see now with what dexterity, with what art I make the greatest transition from this book. Look: my delirium began in Virgília's presence; Virgilia was my greatest sin of youth; there is no youth without boyhood; childhood supposes birth; and here is how we arrived, effortlessly, at the 20th of October, 1805, when I was born. See? No apparent juncture, nothing that amuses the reader's paused attention: nothing. So the book is left with all the advantages of the method, without the rigidity of the method. In fact, it was time. That this method, being, as it is, an indispensable thing, nevertheless it is better to have it without a tie or suspenders, but a little fresh and loose, like someone who doesn't care for the neighbor border, or the block inspector. It is like eloquence, that there is one genuine and vibrant, of a natural and sorceress art, and another stiff, starched and flat. Let's go to the 20th of October.","And now watch the skill, the art with which I make the greatest transition in this book. Watch. My delirium began in Virgília’s presence. Virgília was the great sin of my youth. There’s no youth without childhood, childhood presumes birth, and here is how we come, effortlessly, to that day of October 20, 1805, on which I was born. See? Seamlessly, nothing to divert the reader’s calm attention, nothing. So the book goes on like this with all of method’s advantages but without method’s rigidity. It was about time. Because this business of method, being something indispensable, is better still if it comes without a necktie or suspenders, but, rather, a little cool and loose, like someone who doesn’t care about the woman next door or the policeman on the block. It’s like eloquence, because there’s one kind that’s genuine and vibrant, with a natural and fascinating art, and another that’s stiff, sticky, and stale. Let’s get along to October 20th.","Now, behold the dexterity and skill with which I shall carry out the most important transition in the book. To wit: my delirium began in the presence of Virgília; Virgília was the great sin of my youth; there can be no youth without childhood; childhood presupposes birth; and thus we have arrived, with no effort at all, at the 20th of October, 1805, the day of my birth. You see? No visible joints, nothing to upset the reader’s calm attention—not a thing. The book is given all the advantages of method without its inflexibility. And it was about time, for that matter.1 This business of a method, indispensable as it may be, works better sans cravat and sans suspenders, lightly and loosely dressed, taking no mind of the lady who lives across the street or the watchman on the block. It is like eloquence; there is the genuine, vibrant variety, with a natural, enchanting art, and another sort, which is stiff, pressed, and altogether hollow. Let us go to the 20th of October."

"Longa foi a agonia, longa e cruel, de uma crueldade minuciosa, fria, repisada, que me encheu de dor e estupefação. Era a primeira vez que eu via morrer alguém. Conhecia a morte de outiva; quando muito, tinha-a visto já petrificada no rosto de algum cadáver que acompanhei ao cemitério, ou trazia-lhe a ideia embrulhada nas amplificações de retórica dos professores de cousas antigas — a morte aleivosa de César, a austera de Sócrates, a orgulhosa de Catão.** Mas esse duelo do ser e do não ser,*** a morte em ação, dolorida, contraída, convulsa, sem aparelho político ou filosófico, a morte de uma pessoa amada, essa foi a primeira vez que a pude encarar.

Uma criatura tão dócil, tão meiga, tão santa, que nunca jamais fizera verter uma lágrima de desgosto, mãe carinhosa, esposa imaculada, era força que morresse assim, trateada, mordida pelo dente tenaz de uma doença sem misericórdia? Confesso que tudo aquilo me pareceu obscuro, incongruente, insano…","Long was the agony, long and cruel, of a minute, cold, repeated cruelty that filled me with pain and stupefaction.

Reclinado na cadeira, apanhava de memória os retalhos da conversação do Lobo Neves, refazia as maneiras dele, e concluía que era muito melhor a nova situação. Bastava-nos a Gamboa. A frequência da outra casa aguçaria as invejas. Rigorosamente podíamos dispensar-nos de falar todos os dias; até era melhor, metia a saudade de permeio nos amores. Ao demais, eu galgara os quarenta anos, e não era nada, nem simples eleitor de paróquia. Urgia fazer alguma cousa, ainda por amor de Virgília, que havia de ufanar-se quando visse luzir o meu nome… Creio que nessa ocasião houve grandes aplausos, mas não juro; eu pensava em outra cousa.","I heard nothing of the following act, nor the words of the actors, nor the applause of the audience. Leaning back in his chair, he picked up the scraps of Lobo Neves' conversation from memory, retraced his manners, and concluded that the new situation was much better. Gamboa was enough for us. The frequency of the other house would spur the envy. Strictly speaking, we could dispense with talking every day; it was even better, it put nostalgia in the way of loves. Besides, I had reached the age of forty, and I was nothing, not even a simple parish voter. There was an urgent need to do something, even for the love of Virgília, who would be proud when she saw my name shine… I think there was great applause on that occasion, but I don't swear it; I was thinking of something else.","I didn’t hear any of the second act, neither the words of the actors nor the applause of the audience. Leaning back in my chair I was picking the shreds of my conversation with Lobo Neves out of my memory, re-creating his manners, and I concluded that the new situation was much better. All we needed was Gamboa. Visiting the other house would only sharpen suspicions. We could rigorously go without speaking every day. It was even better, it put the longing during our breaks back into our love. Besides, I was going on forty and I wasn’t anything, not even a district elector. It was urgent that I do something, if only for the love of Virgília, who would be proud to see my name shine … I think that there was loud applause at that moment, but I can’t swear to it. I was thinking about something else.","I heard nothing of the second act, neither the words of the actors nor the applause of the audience.

Gamboa was enough for us. Frequenting the other house would only sharpen jealousies. Really, we could go without speaking every day; this was even better, for it introduced a note of longing into our love. As for the rest, I was past forty and I had become nothing, not even a parish elector. I had to do something, if only for love of Virgília, who would swell with pride when she saw my name shine . . .

"Não te arrependas de ser generoso; a pratinha rendeu-me uma confidência de D. Plácida, e conseguintemente, este capítulo. Dias depois, como eu a achasse só em casa, travamos palestra, e ela contou-me em breves termos a sua história. Era filha natural de um sacristão da Sé e de uma mulher que fazia doces para fora. Perdeu o pai aos dez anos. Já então ralava coco e fazia não sei que outros trabalhos de doceira, compatíveis com a idade. Aos quinze ou dezesseis casou com um alfaiate, que morreu tísico algum tempo depois, deixando-lhe uma filha. Viúva e moça, ficaram a seu cargo a filha, com dous anos, e a mãe, cansada de trabalhar. Tinha de sustentar a três pessoas. Fazia doces, que era o seu ofício, mas cosia também, de dia e de noite, com afinco, para três ou quatro lojas, e ensinava algumas crianças do bairro, a dez tostões por mês. Com isto iam-se passando os anos, não a beleza, porque não a tivera nunca. Apareceram-lhe alguns namoros, propostas, seduções, a que resistia.","Do not regret being generous; the little silver earned me a confidence from Dona Plácida, and consequently, this chapter. A few days later, as I found her alone at home, we had a talk, and she told me in brief terms her story. She was the natural daughter of a sacristan from the Cathedral and a woman who made sweets for outside. He lost his father at the age of ten. By then, I was already grating coconuts and doing all kinds of other jobs as a confectioner, compatible with my age. At fifteen or sixteen she married a tailor, who died of consumption some time later, leaving her a daughter. Widow and girl, they were in charge of the daughter, aged two, and the mother, tired of working. I had to support three people. She made sweets, which was her trade, but she also sewed, day and night, diligently, for three or four stores, and taught some children in the neighborhood, for ten pennies a month. With that, the years passed, not the beauty, because he had never had it. Some courtships, proposals, seductions appeared to him, which he resisted.","Never repent for being generous. The little silver coin brought me Dona Plácida’s confidence and, consequently, this chapter.

She was the illegitimate child of a sexton at the cathedral and a woman who sold sweets on the street. She lost her father when she was ten. By then she was shredding cocoanut and doing all kinds of other chores of a sweets-maker fitting for her age. At fifteen or sixteen she married a tailor who died of tuberculosis a while later, leaving her with a daughter two years old and her mother, exhausted from a life of work. She had three mouths to feed. She made sweets, which was her trade, but she also sewed, day and night, assiduously, for three or four shops and she taught some girls in the neighborhood for ten tostões a month.

"Tranquilizei-a como pude; disse que podiam ser cuidados políticos. Virgília concordou que seriam, mas ficou ainda muito excitada e nervosa.

Uma janela aberta deixava entrar o vento, que sacudia frouxamente as cortinas, e eu fiquei a olhar para as cortinas, sem as ver.

Eu cínico, alma sensível? Pela coxa de Diana! Esta injúria merecia ser lavada com sangue, se o sangue lavasse alguma cousa nesse mundo. Não, alma sensível, eu não sou cínico, eu fui homem; meu cérebro foi um tablado em que se deram peças de todo gênero, o drama sacro, o austero, o piegas, a comédia louçã, a desgrenhada farsa, os autos, as bufonerias, um pandemonium, alma sensível, uma barafunda de cousas e pessoas, em que podias ver tudo, desde a rosa de Esmirna* até a arruda do teu quintal, desde o magnífico leito de Cleópatra até o recanto da praia em que o mendigo tirita o seu sono. Cruzavam-se nele pensamentos de vária casta e feição. Não havia ali a atmosfera somente da águia e do beija-flor; havia também a da lesma e do sapo.

I cynical, sensitive soul? By Diana's thigh! This injury deserved to be washed away with blood, if blood washed anything away in this world. No, sensitive soul, I am not cynical, I was a man; my brain was a stage on which plays of all kinds were played, the sacred drama, the austere, the mushy, the disheveled comedy, the disheveled farce, the plays, the buffoonery, a pandemonium, a sensitive soul, a jumble of things and people , where you could see everything from the rose of Smyrna* to the rue in your yard, from Cleopatra's magnificent bed to the corner of the beach where the beggar shivers in his sleep. Thoughts of various castes and features crossed in him. There was not only the atmosphere of the eagle and the hummingbird there; there was also that of the slug and the frog.

"— Não me podes negar um fato — disse ele —; é que o prazer do beneficiador é sempre maior que o do beneficiado. Que é o benefício? É um ato que faz cessar certa privação do beneficiado. Uma vez produzido o efeito essencial, isto é, uma vez cessada a privação, torna o organismo ao estado anterior, ao estado indiferente. Supõe que tens apertado em demasia o cós das calças; para fazer cessar o incômodo, desabotoas o cós, respiras, saboreias um instante de gozo, o organismo torna à indiferença, e não te lembras dos teus dedos que praticaram o ato. Não havendo nada que perdure, é natural que a memória se esvaeça, porque ela não é uma planta aérea, precisa de chão. A esperança de outros favores, é certo, conserva sempre no beneficiado a lembrança do primeiro; mas este fato, aliás um dos mais sublimes que a filosofia pode achar em seu caminho, explica-se pela memória da privação, ou, usando de outra fórmula, pela privação continuada na memória, que repercute a dor passada e aconselha a precaução do remédio oportuno. Não digo que, ainda sem esta circunstância, não aconteça, algumas vezes, persistir a memória do obséquio, acompanhada de certa afeição mais ou menos intensa; mas são verdadeiras aberrações, sem nenhum valor aos olhos de um filósofo.","""You cannot deny me a fact,"" he said; is that the pleasure of the beneficiary is always greater than that of the beneficiary. What's the benefit? It is an act that puts an end to a certain deprivation of the beneficiary. Once the essential effect has been produced, that is, once the deprivation has ceased, it returns the organism to the previous state, to the indifferent state. Suppose you have tightened the waistband of your pants too much; to stop the discomfort, you unbutton your waistband, you breathe, you savor a moment of enjoyment, the organism returns to indifference, and you don't remember your fingers that performed the act. If there is nothing that lasts, it is natural for the memory to fade, because it is not an aerial plant, it needs the ground. The hope of other favors, it is true, always preserves in the beneficiary the memory of the first; but this fact, in fact one of the most sublime that philosophy can find in its path, is explained by the memory of deprivation, or, using another formula, by the deprivation continued in memory, which echoes the past pain and advises the precaution of the remedy. timely. I am not saying that, even without this circumstance, the memory of the gift does not sometimes persist, accompanied by a more or less intense affection; but they are true aberrations, worthless in the eyes of a philosopher.","“You can’t deny one fact,” he said, “which is that the pleasure of the benefactor is always greater than that of the benefactee. What is a benefit? It’s an act that brings a certain deprivation of the one benefited to an end. Once the essential effect has been produced, once the deprivation has ceased, that is, the organism returns to its previous state, a state of indifference. Just suppose that the waist of your trousers is too tight. In order to relieve the uncomfortable situation you unbutton the waist, you breathe, you enjoy an instant of pleasure, the organism returns to indifference and you forget about the fingers that performed the operation. If there’s nothing that lasts, it’s natural that memory should disappear, because it’s not an aerial plant, it needs earth. The hope for other favors, of course, always holds the benefactee in a remembrance of the first one, but that fact, also one of the most sublime that philosophy can find in its path, is explained by the memory of deprivation or, using a different formula, by deprivation’s continuing on in memory, which echoes the past pain and advises alertness for an opportune remedy. I’m not saying that even without this circumstance it doesn’t sometimes happen that the memory of the favor will persist, accompanied by a certain more or less intense affection. But they’re true aberrations with no value whatever in the eyes of a philosopher.”","“You cannot deny me one fact,” he said, “which is that the pleasure of the benefiter is always greater than that of the beneficiary. What is a benefit? It is an act that causes some privation on the part of the beneficiary to cease. Once the essential effect is produced—that is, once the privation has indeed ceased—the organism returns to its previous state of indifference. Suppose you have tightened your waistband too far; to make the discomfort cease, you loosen it, breathe, savor an instant of pleasure, your organism returns to indifference, and you no longer think of your fingers, which carried out the act. Just as nothing lasts, so it is natural that memory should fade; it is no air plant, it needs soil in which to root. The expectation of other favors, of course, will always preserve the beneficiary’s recollection of the first; but this fact, which is, incidentally, one of the most sublime that philosophy may have the opportunity to observe, can be explained by the memory of privation—or, to use another formula, by the privation that continues in memory, echoing that past pain and advising that an opportune remedy be kept at hand. I’ll not deny that, even in the absence of such a thing, the memory of the kindness may at times persist, accompanied by a degree of affection; but these are true aberrations, with no value in the eyes of a philosopher.”"

"Com efeito, eu havia faltado à palavra que dera, e a culpa era toda de Virgília. Questão de ciúmes. Essa mulher esplêndida sabia que o era, e gostava de o ouvir dizer, fosse em voz alta ou baixa. Na antevéspera, em casa da baronesa, valsara duas vezes com o mesmo peralta, depois de lhe escutar as cortesanices, ao canto de uma janela. Estava tão alegre! Tão derramada! Tão cheia de si! Quando descobriu, entre as minhas sobrancelhas, a ruga interrogativa e ameaçadora, não teve nenhum sobressalto, nem ficou subitamente séria; mas deitou ao mar o peralta e as cortesanices. Veio depois a mim, tomou-me o braço, e levou-me a outra sala, menos povoada, onde se me queixou de cansaço, e disse muitas outras cousas, com o ar pueril que costumava ter, em certas ocasiões, e eu ouvi-a quase sem responder nada.","In fact, I had broken my word, and it was Virgilia's fault. Jealousy issue. This splendid woman knew she was, and she liked to hear him say it, whether aloud or low. The day before, at the baroness's house, he had waltzed twice with the same mischief, after listening to her courtesies, in the corner of a window. I was so happy! So spilled! So full of you! When he discovered, between my eyebrows, the questioning and threatening frown, he did not start, nor did he suddenly become serious; but he threw the mischief and the courtesies into the sea. Then he came to me, took my arm, and led me to another room, less populated, where he complained of tiredness, and said many other things, with the childish air he used to have on certain occasions, and I heard -a almost without answering anything.","As a matter of fact, I had broken the promise I’d made and the fault was all Virgília’s. A matter of jealousy. That splendid woman knew that it was and she liked to hear it said, whether aloud or in a whisper. Two days before at the baroness’ she’d waltzed twice with the same dandy after listening to his courtly talk in a corner by the window. She was so merry! So open! So self-possessed! When she caught an interrogative and threatening wrinkle between my eyebrows, she showed no surprise, nor did she become suddenly serious, but she threw the dandy and his courtly talk overboard. Then she came over to me, took my arm, and led me into the other room, with fewer people, where she complained of being tired and said many other things with the childlike air she was accustomed to assume on certain occasions and I listened to her almost without replying.","Indeed, I had broken my promise, and it was all Virgília’s fault.

"O melhor é que conversávamos os dous, o embrião e eu, falávamos de cousas presentes e futuras. O maroto amava-me, era um pelintra gracioso, dava-me pancadinhas na cara com as mãozinhas gordas, ou então traçava a beca de bacharel, porque ele havia de ser bacharel, e fazia um discurso na Câmara dos Deputados. E o pai a ouvi-lo de uma tribuna, com os olhos rasos de lágrimas. De bacharel passava outra vez à escola, pequenino, lousa e livros debaixo do braço, ou então caía no berço para tornar a erguer-se homem. Em vão buscava fixar no espírito uma idade, uma atitude: esse embrião tinha a meus olhos todos os tamanhos e gestos: ele mamava, ele escrevia, ele valsava, ele era o interminável nos limites de um quarto de hora — baby e deputado, colegial e pintalegrete. Às vezes, ao pé de Virgília, esquecia-me dela e de tudo; Virgília sacudia-me, reprochava-me o silêncio; dizia que eu já lhe não queria nada. A verdade é que estava em diálogo com o embrião; era o velho colóquio de Adão e Caim, uma conversa sem palavras entre a vida e a vida, o mistério e o mistério.","The best thing is that the two of us talked, the embryo and I, we talked about present and future things. The rascal loved me, he was a graceful rogue, he would pat me on the face with his fat little hands, or else he would draw a bachelor's gown, because he was going to be a bachelor, and make a speech in the Chamber of Deputies. And his father listening to him from a rostrum, his eyes brimming with tears. From a bachelor's degree, he would go back to school, a little boy, with a blackboard and books under his arm, or else he would fall into his crib to rise again as a man. In vain I tried to fix in my mind an age, an attitude: this embryo had, in my eyes, all sizes and gestures: he suckled, he wrote, he waltzed, he was the interminable within the limits of a quarter of an hour — baby and deputy, schoolboy and guinea pig. Sometimes, near Virgília, I forgot about her and everything; Virgilia shook me, reproached my silence; Said I didn't want anything from him anymore. The truth is that he was in dialogue with the embryo; it was the old colloquy of Adam and Cain, a wordless conversation between life and life, mystery and mystery.","The best thing was that we would both converse, the embryo and I, talking about present and future things. The rascal loved me, he was a funny little rogue, giving me little pats on the face with his chubby little hands or then sketching out the shape of a lawyer’s robe, because he was going to be a lawyer and he would make a speech in the chamber of deputies. And his father would listen to him from a box, his eyes gleaming with tears. From lawyer he would go back to school again, tiny, slate and books under his arm, or then he would drop into his cradle and stand up again as a man. I sought in vain to fix the spirit in one age, one appearance. That embryo had my eyes, all of my forms and gestures. He suckled, he wrote, he waltzed, he was interminable in the limits of a quarter hour—baby and deputy, schoolboy and dandy. Sometimes, beside Virgília, I would forget about her and everything. Virgília would shake me, scold me for my silence. She said that I didn’t love her anymore at all. The truth is I was having a dialogue with the embryo. It was the ancient dialogue between Adam and Cain, a conversation without words, between life and life, mystery and mystery.","The best of it was that the two of us conversed, the embryo and I, we spoke of present and future things. The scamp loved me, he was a charming little rascal, and he would pat me on the face with his chubby hands, or then, resplendent in his lawyer’s robes—as he would undoubtedly take a degree —he would give a speech in the Chamber of Deputies. And his father would listen from the gallery, eyes gleaming with tears. From the university he would become a little schoolboy again, slate and books under his arm, or he might sink back into his cradle to rise once more as a man.

At times, next to Virgília, I forgot her and everything else; Virgília would give me a shake and reproach me for my silence, saying that I no longer cared for her.

"Não foi outro o delito do glosador: retardara a compota e dera causa à minha exclusão. Tanto bastou para que eu cogitasse uma vingança, qualquer que fosse, mas grande e exemplar, cousa que de alguma maneira o tornasse ridículo. Que ele era um homem grave, o Dr. Vilaça, medido e lento, quarenta e sete anos, casado e pai. Não me contentava o rabo de papel nem o rabicho da cabeleira; havia de ser cousa pior. Entrei a espreitá-lo, durante o resto da tarde, a segui-lo, na chácara, aonde todos desceram a passear. Vi-o conversar com D. Eusébia, irmã do sargento-mor Domingues, uma robusta donzelona, que se não era bonita, também não era feia.","The glosser's offense was no other: he had delayed the jam and caused my exclusion.

I saw him talking to Dona Eusebia, the sister of Sergeant Major Domingues, a robust maiden who, if she wasn't pretty, wasn't ugly either.","The glosser’s crime had been only that: delaying the compote and bringing about my exclusion.

I began scrutinizing him for the rest of the afternoon, following him around the grounds, where they’d all gone to stroll. I saw him chatting with Dona Eusébia, Sergeant-Major Domingues’ sister, a big robust maiden lady, who, if she wasn’t pretty, wasn’t ugly either.","Such was the improvisatore’s crime: he had delayed the compote and caused my banishment.

I wouldn’t be satisfied with a paper tail or a yanked wig; I needed something worse. I spent the rest of the afternoon watching him, then following him around the grounds as the guests embarked on a postprandial stroll. I saw him talking with Dona Eusébia, the sister of Sergeant-Major Domingues, a robust spinster, who, though not pretty, was hardly homely."

"Meu espírito (permitam-me aqui uma comparação de criança!), meu espírito era naquela ocasião uma espécie de peteca. A narração do Quincas Borba dava-lhe uma palmada, ele subia; quando ia a cair, o bilhete de Virgília dava-lhe outra palmada, e ele era de novo arremessado aos ares; descia, e o episódio do Passeio Público recebia-o com outra palmada, igualmente rija e eficaz. Cuido que não nasci para situações complexas. Esse puxar e empuxar de cousas opostas desequilibrava-me; tinha vontade de embrulhar o Quincas Borba, o Lobo Neves e o bilhete de Virgília na mesma filosofia, e mandá-los de presente a Aristóteles. Contudo, era instrutiva a narração do nosso filósofo; admirava-lhe sobretudo o talento de observação com que descrevia a gestação e o crescimento do vício, as lutas interiores, as capitulações vagarosas, o uso da lama.","My spirit (allow me a child's comparison here!), my spirit was at that time a kind of shuttlecock.

I take care that I was not born for complex situations. This pulling and pulling of opposite things unbalanced me; I wanted to wrap Quincas Borba, Lobo Neves and Virgília's note in the same philosophy and send them to Aristotle as a gift.

I had an urge to wrap up Quincas Borba, Lobo Neves, and Virgília’s note in the same philosophy and send them to Aristotle as a gift. Nevertheless, our philosopher’s narrative was instructive.

I don’t believe I was born for complex situations. This pulling and pushing of opposite things unbalanced me; I felt an urge to wrap up Quincas Borba, Lobo Neves, and Virgília’s note in a single philosophy and send them to Aristotle as a present.

Um deles, o João, era um homem de língua solta, vida galante, conversa picaresca. Desde os onze anos entrou a admitir-me às anedotas reais ou não, eivadas todas de obscenidade ou imundície. Não me respeitava a adolescência, como não respeitava a batina do irmão; com a diferença que este fugia logo que ele enveredava por assunto escabroso. Eu não; deixava-me estar, sem entender nada, a princípio, depois entendendo, e enfim achando-lhe graça. No fim de certo tempo, quem o procurava era eu; e ele gostava muito de mim, dava-me doces, levava-me a passeio. Em casa, quando lá ia passar alguns dias, não poucas vezes me aconteceu achá-lo, no fundo da chácara, no lavadouro, a palestrar com as escravas que batiam roupa; aí é que era um desfiar de anedotas, de ditos, de perguntas, e um estalar de risadas, que ninguém podia ouvir, porque o lavadouro ficava muito longe de casa. As pretas, com uma tanga no ventre, a arregaçar-lhes um palmo dos vestidos, umas dentro do tanque, outras fora, inclinadas sobre as peças de roupa, a batê-las, a ensaboá-las, a torcê-las, iam ouvindo e redarguindo às pilhérias do tio João, e a comentá-las de quando em quando com esta palavra:","Surrounded by transmission and education, there was still the strange example, the domestic environment. We saw the parents; let's see the uncles. One of them, João, was a man with a loose tongue, a gallant life, picaresque conversation. From the age of eleven, he began to admit me to real or not real anecdotes, all tainted with obscenity or filth. I didn't respect my adolescence, just as I didn't respect my brother's cassock; with the difference that the latter fled as soon as he embarked on a ludicrous subject. I am not; I let myself be, not understanding anything, at first, then understanding, and finally finding it amusing. At the end of a certain time, I was the one looking for him; and he was very fond of me, he gave me sweets, he took me for walks. At home, when I was going to spend a few days there, I often found him, at the back of the farm, in the wash, talking to the slaves who were washing clothes; That's where it was a string of anecdotes, sayings, questions, and a burst of laughter, which no one could hear, because the washhouse was a long way from home. The black women, with a loincloth on their stomachs, pulling up their dresses an inch, some inside the tank, others outside, bent over the garments, beating them, soaping them, wringing them, listening to and replying to Uncle João's jokes, and commenting on them from time to time with this word:","Along with communication with education there was also outside example, the domestic milieu. We’ve seen the parents, now let’s have a look at the uncles and the aunt. One of them, João, was a man with a loose tongue, a dashing life, and picaresque conversation. From the age of eleven on I was admitted to his anecdotes, true or otherwise, all contaminated with obscenity or filth. He didn’t respect my adolescence any more than he respected his brother’s cassock, with the difference that the latter would flee as soon as some scabrous subject was touched upon. Not 1.1 allowed myself to stay without understanding anything at first, later understanding, and finally finding him amusing. After a time the one who sought him out was I and he liked me a lot, gave me candy, took me for walks. At home, when he would come to spend a few days, it happened quite often that I would find him in the rear of the house in the laundry chatting with the slave girls who were washing clothes. ‘ That’s where he’d string together stories, comments, questions, and there’d be an explosion of laughter that nobody could hear because the laundry was too far away from the house. The black women, with clothes around their middle, their dresses hiked up a little, some inside the tank, others outside, leaning over the articles of clothing, beating them, soaping them, twisting them, went on listening to Uncle Joéo’s jokes and commenting on them from time to time, saying:","Along with my extraction and education was the example set by the rest of the domestic environment. We have seen my parents; let us turn to my uncles. One of them, João, was a man with a loose tongue, a merry life, and an endless supply of roguish conversation. From age eleven on I was granted admittance to the stories he told, some true, some not, but all shot through with obscenity or filth. He had no care for my youth, just as he had no care for his brother’s cassock; the difference was that the priest fled whenever he started in on some scabrous subject. I never did; I would let myself listen, understanding nothing at first, then understanding, and finally finding the fun in it. After a while, I was the one seeking him out; and he liked me very much, and would give me sweets and take me out with him. At home, when he happened to spend a few days with us, I found him more than a few times behind the house, in the laundry, chatting with the slave women as they beat at the clothes; then there would come a string of jokes, japes, questions, and bursts of laughter that nobody could hear, since the laundry was quite far from the house. The slave women, their dresses tucked into the tanga-cloths4 round their waists, some wading in the laundry tank, others outside it, leaning over the clothes as they beat, soaped, and wrung them, would take in and snap back at Uncle João’s witticisms, punctuating them now and again with the following exclamation:"

"Não pôde Eugênia encobrir a satisfação que sentia com esta minha palavra, mas emendou-se logo, e ficou como dantes, erecta, fria e muda. Em verdade, parecia ainda mais mulher do que era; seria criança nos seus folgares de moça; mas assim quieta, impassível, tinha a compostura da mulher casada. Talvez essa circunstância lhe diminuía um pouco da graça virginal. Depressa nos familiarizamos; a mãe fazia-lhe grandes elogios, eu escutava-os de boa sombra,* e ela sorria, com os olhos fúlgidos, como se lá dentro do cérebro lhe estivesse a voar uma borboletinha de asas de ouro e olhos de diamante…","Eugenia couldn't hide the satisfaction she felt at my words, but she immediately corrected herself, and remained as before, erect, cold and mute. In fact, she looked even more womanly than she was; she would be a child in her girlish leisure; but still, impassively, she had the composure of a married woman. Perhaps this circumstance diminished her virginal grace a little.

As a matter of fact she looked even more womanly than she was. She could have been a child playing at being a young lady but, quiet, impassive like that, she had the composure of a married woman. That circumstance may have diminished her virginal grace a bit. We quickly became familiar. Her mother sang her praises and I listened to them willingly and she was smiling, her eyes sparkling as if inside her brain a little butterfly with golden wings and diamond eyes were flying …","Eugênia couldn’t conceal the satisfaction that my words brought her, but she soon recovered herself and became straight-backed, cold, and silent once more. Indeed, she seemed to be even more of a woman than she was in fact; she might be a child when left to her youthful devices, but once quiet and impassive, she had the composure of a married woman. This may have diminished her virginal charm somewhat. We shortly became familiar; her mother praised her to no end, I listened to the praise readily, and the girl smiled, her eyes shining, as if a butterfly were flitting around inside her head with wings of gold and diamond eyes . . ."

"Comecei devagar. Três dias depois, discutindo-se o orçamento da Justiça, aproveitei o ensejo para perguntar modestamente ao ministro se não julgava útil diminuir a barretina da Guarda Nacional. Não tinha vasto alcance o objeto da pergunta, mas ainda assim demonstrei que não era indigno das cogitações de um homem de Estado; e citei Filopêmen, que ordenou a substituição dos broquéis de suas tropas, que eram pequenos, por outros maiores, e bem assim as lanças, que eram demasiado leves;* fato que a história não achou que desmentisse a gravidade de suas páginas. O tamanho das nossas barretinas estava pedindo um corte profundo, não só por serem deselegantes, mas também por serem anti-higiênicas. Nas paradas, ao sol, o excesso de calor produzido por elas podia ser fatal. Sendo certo que um dos preceitos de Hipócrates era trazer a cabeça fresca, parecia cruel obrigar um cidadão, por simples consideração de uniforme, a arriscar a saúde e a vida, e consequentemente o futuro da família. A Câmara e o governo deviam lembrar-se que a Guarda Nacional era o anteparo da liberdade e da independência, e que o cidadão, chamado a um serviço gratuito, frequente e penoso, tinha direito a que se lhe diminuísse o ônus, decretando um uniforme leve e maneiro. Acrescia que a barretina, por seu peso, abatia a cabeça dos cidadãos, e a pátria precisava de cidadãos cuja fronte pudesse levantar-se altiva e serena diante do poder; e concluí com esta ideia: o chorão, que inclina os seus galhos para a terra, é árvore de cemitério; a palmeira, erecta e firme, é árvore do deserto, das praças e dos jardins.","I started slowly. Three days later, while the Justice budget was being discussed, I took the opportunity to modestly ask the minister if he did not think it would be useful to reduce the National Guard's shako. The object of the question was not far-reaching, yet I showed that it was not unworthy of the musings of a statesman; and I quoted Philopemen, who ordered the replacement of the bucklers of his troops, which were small, by larger ones, and also the spears, which were too light;* a fact that history did not think belied the gravity of its pages. The size of our shakos was asking for a deep cut, not only because they were inelegant, but also because they were unhygienic. On parades, in the sun, the excess heat produced by them could be fatal. Since one of Hippocrates' precepts was to bring a fresh head, it seemed cruel to oblige a citizen, for the simple consideration of uniform, to risk health and life, and consequently the future of the family. The Chamber and the government should remember that the National Guard was the bulwark of freedom and independence, and that the citizen, called to a free, frequent and painful service, had the right to have the burden reduced by decreeing a uniform light and handy. He added that the shako, by its weight, lowered the citizens' heads, and the country needed citizens whose foreheads could raise proud and serene in the face of power; and I concluded with this idea: the willow, which bends its branches towards the earth, is a cemetery tree; the palm tree, erect and firm, is a tree of the desert, of squares and gardens.","I began slowly. Three days later during the discussion of the budget for the ministry of justice, I took advantage of an opening to ask the minister modestly if it wouldn’t be useful to reduce the size of the National Guard’s shakos. The object of the question wasn’t far-reaching, but even so I demonstrated how it wasn’t unworthy of the cogitations of a statesman and I cited Philopaemen, who ordered the replacement of his troops’ shields, which were small, by other larger ones, and also their spears, which were too light, a fact that history didn’t find out of line with the gravity of its pages. The size of our shakos called for a profound cut, not only to make them more stylish, but also to make them more hygienic. On parade in the sun the excessive heat they produce could be fatal. Since it was a well-known fact that it was a precept of Hippocrates that a person should keep his head cool, it seemed cruel to oblige a citizen, from the simple consideration of being in uniform, to risk his health and his life and, consequently, the future of his family. The chamber and the government should keep in mind that the National Guard is the rampart of freedom and independence, and that a citizen called up for service freely given, frequent, and arduous, had the right to have the onus of it lessened by a decree calling for a light and easy-fitting uniform. I added that the shako, because of its weight, lowered a citizen’s head, and the nation needed citizens whose brow could be raised, proud and serene, in the face of power. And I concluded with this idea: the weeping willow, which bends its branches toward the earth, is a graveyard tree. The palm tree, erect and firm, is a tree of the wilderness, public squares, and gardens.","I started slowly. Three days later, during a discussion on the budget for the Ministry of Justice, I took the opportunity to ask the minister modestly if he didn’t think it wise to reduce the size of the National Guard’s shakos. The object of the question was not of a great scale, but even so, I demonstrated that it was not unworthy of the cogitations of a statesman; and I cited Philopoemen, who ordered that his troops’ bucklers be replaced with larger shields and their spears with heavier pikes, a fact that history did not find unbefitting the gravity of its pages. Our shakos were in need of a profound trimming, not only because they were inelegant but also because they were unhygienic. Out on parades, under the sun, the excessive heat they produced might prove fatal. Given that one of Hippocrates’ precepts was to keep one’s head cool, it seemed callous to force a citizen to risk his health and life, and hence the future of his family, out of purely sartorial considerations. The Chamber and the administration ought to recall that the National Guard was the bulwark of liberty and independence, and that citizens called to a service that was freely bestowed, habitual, and arduous were entitled to have their burden lessened by the establishment of a light and comfortable uniform. I added that the weight of the shako was casting citizens’ heads down, and the nation needed men whose brows might rise, proud and serene, in the face of power; and I concluded with this idea: the weeping willow, which bends its branches toward the earth, grows in cemeteries; the palm, erect and steadfast, grows in the wilderness, in public squares, and in gardens."

"Havia alguma afetação naquele desdém; era um arrebique do gesto.* Lá dentro, ela padecia, e não pouco — ou fosse mágoa pura, ou só despeito; e porque a dor que se dissimula dói mais, é mui provável que Virgília padecesse em dobro do que realmente devia padecer. Creio que isto é metafísica.","There was some affectation in that disdain; it was an upheaval of the gesture.* Inside, she was suffering, and not a little—either it was pure grief, or just spite; and because the pain that is hidden hurts more, it is very likely that Virgilia suffered twice as much as she really should have. I believe this is metaphysics.","There was a certain affection in that disdain. It was a kind of contrived expression. She was suffering inside, and quite a bit—it was either real suffering or just annoyance. And because pain that’s covered up hurts all the more, quite probably Virgília was suffering twice over what she really should have been suffering. I think that’s called metaphysics.","There was a measure of affectation in that disdain; there were airs in the gesture. Inside she was suffering, and not a little, whether it was pure distress or only spite; and since dissembled pains hurt all the worse, it is quite probable that Virgília was actually suffering twice as much as she really should have been. I believe that is metaphysical."
"Repetia-se isto, com variantes. Como o Viegas gostasse de jogar damas, Virgília cumpria-lhe o desejo, aturando-o por largo tempo, a mover as pedras com a mão frouxa e tarda. Outras vezes, desciam a passear na chácara, dando-lhe ela o braço, que ele nem sempre aceitava, por dizer-se rijo e capaz de andar uma légua. Iam, sentavam-se, tornavam a ir, a falar de cousas várias, ora de um negócio de família, ora de uma bisbilhotice de sala, ora enfim de uma casa que ele meditava construir, para residência própria, casa de feitio moderno, porque a dele era das antigas, contemporânea de el-rei D. João VI, à maneira de algumas que ainda hoje (creio eu) se podem ver no bairro de São Cristóvão, com as suas grossas colunas na frente. Parecia-lhe que o casarão em que morava podia ser substituído, e já tinha encomendado o risco a um pedreiro de fama. Ah! Então sim, então é que Virgília chegaria a ver o que era um velho de gosto.","This was repeated, with variants. As Viegas liked to play checkers, Virgília fulfilled his wish, putting up with it for a long time, moving the stones with a limp and slow hand. Other times, they would go down to walk around the farm, and she would give him her arm, which he did not always accept, as he said he was tough and capable of walking a league. They went, sat down, went back, talking about various things, sometimes about a family business, sometimes about a living room gossip, sometimes about a house that he was considering building, for his own residence, a modern-style house, because his was an ancient one, contemporary with King D. João VI, in the manner of some that can still be seen today (I believe) in the São Cristóvão district, with its thick columns in front. It seemed to him that the big house in which he lived could be replaced, and he had already commissioned the design from a famous bricklayer. Oh! So yes, then Virgilia would come to see what an old man of taste was.","This would be repeated with variations. Since Viegas liked to play checkers, Virgília would follow his desire, enduring it for a long spell as he moved the pieces with his weak, slow hand. At other times they would go out to stroll in the yard, with her offering him her arm, which he wouldn’t always accept, saying that he was solid and capable of walking a league. They would walk, sit down, walk again, talk about different things, sometimes about some family matter, sometimes about drawing-room gossip, sometimes, finally, about a house he was thinking of building for his own residence, a house of modern design because his was an ancient one, going back to the time of King John VI, like some that can still be seen today (I think) in the São Cristóvão district with their thick columns in front. He thought that the big house where he was living could be replaced and he’d already ordered a sketch from a well-known mason. Ah!, then indeed, Virgília would see what an old man of good taste was like.","All this repeated itself, with variations. Since Viegas liked to play checkers, Virgília would indulge him, abiding at length as he moved the pieces with a slack, faltering grip. On other occasions they would go down to stroll around the grounds, she offering him her arm, which he spurned at times, saying that he was hale enough to walk a league. They would walk, sit, and walk again, speaking of many things: a family matter, a bit of drawing-room gossip, and finally of a house he had it in mind to build for himself, one with a modern make, as his was an old place, a contemporary of King João VI’s, like those that (I believe) may still be found in the neighborhood of São Cristóvão, with their sturdy columns out front. He felt that the manse in which he lived might be replaced, and he had already ordered a plan from a renowned mason. Ah! Then Virgília would really see what an old man with good taste could get up to."

"Deixei dito noutra página que o Lobo Neves, nomeado presidente de província, recusou a nomeação por motivo da data do decreto, que era 13; ato grave, cuja consequência foi separar do ministério o marido de Virgília. Assim, o fato particular da ojeriza de um número produziu o fenômeno da dissidência política. Resta ver como, tempos depois, um ato político determinou na vida particular uma cessação de movimento. Não convindo ao método deste livro descrever imediatamente esse outro fenômeno, limito-me a dizer por ora que o Lobo Neves, quatro meses depois de nosso encontro no teatro, reconciliou-se com o ministério; fato que o leitor não deve perder de vista, se quiser penetrar a subtileza do meu pensamento.","I left it on another page that Lobo Neves, appointed president of the province, refused the appointment because of the date of the decree, which was 13; serious act, the consequence of which was to separate Virgília's husband from the ministry.

It remains to be seen how, some time later, a political act determined a cessation of movement in private life.

It remains to be seen how, sometimes afterward, a political event determined a cessation of motion in private life. Since it’s not suitable to the method of this book to describe that other phenomenon immediately, I shall limit myself for now to say that Lobo Neves, four months after our meeting in the theatre, made up with the minister, a fact that the reader must not lose sight of if he wishes to penetrate the subtlety of my thought.","I said on another page that Lobo Neves, having been named provincial president, refused the nomination on the grounds of the date of the decree, which was the 13th: a grave act, the consequence of which was to separate Virgília’s husband from the administration.

"Talvez pareça excessivo o escrúpulo do Cotrim, a quem não souber que ele possuía um caráter ferozmente honrado. Eu mesmo fui injusto com ele durante os anos que se seguiram ao inventário de meu pai. Reconheço que era um modelo. Arguiam-no de avareza, e cuido que tinham razão; mas a avareza é apenas a exageração de uma virtude, e as virtudes devem ser como os orçamentos: melhor é o saldo que o deficit. Como era muito seco de maneiras, tinha inimigos, que chegavam a acusá-lo de bárbaro. O único fato alegado neste particular era o de mandar com frequência escravos ao Calabouço,* donde eles desciam a escorrer sangue; mas, além de que ele só mandava os perversos e os fujões, ocorre que, tendo longamente contrabandeado em escravos, habituara-se de certo modo ao trato um pouco mais duro que esse gênero de negócio requeria, e não se pode honestamente atribuir à índole original de um homem o que é puro efeito de relações sociais. A prova de que o Cotrim tinha sentimentos pios encontrava-se no seu amor aos filhos, e na dor que padeceu quando lhe morreu Sara, dali a alguns meses; prova irrefutável, acho eu, e não única. Era tesoureiro de uma confraria, e irmão de várias irmandades, e até irmão remido de uma destas, o que não se coaduna muito com a reputação da avareza; verdade é que o benefício não caíra no chão: a irmandade (de que ele fora juiz) mandara-lhe tirar o retrato a óleo. Não era perfeito, decerto; tinha, por exemplo, o sestro de mandar para os jornais a notícia de um ou outro benefício que praticava — sestro repreensível ou não louvável, concordo; mas ele desculpava-se dizendo que as boas ações eram contagiosas, quando públicas; razão a que se não pode negar algum peso. Creio mesmo (e nisto faço o seu maior elogio) que ele não praticava, de quando em quando, esses benefícios senão com o fim de espertar a filantropia dos outros; e se tal era o intuito, força é confessar que a publicidade tornava-se uma condição sine qua non. Em suma, poderia dever algumas atenções, mas não devia um real a ninguém.","Perhaps Cotrim's scruples would seem excessive, to anyone who did not know that he had a fiercely honorable character. I myself was unfair to him during the years following my father's inventory. I recognize that it was a model. They accused him of avarice, and I think they were right; but avarice is only the exaggeration of a virtue, and virtues must be like budgets: better is the balance than the deficit. As he was very dry in manners, he had enemies, who even accused him of being a barbarian. The only fact alleged in this regard was that he frequently sent slaves to the Dungeon,* from which they descended dripping blood; but besides the fact that he only sent the perverts and fugitives, it so happens that, having smuggled in slaves for a long time, he had somehow become accustomed to the somewhat harsher treatment that this kind of business required, and it cannot honestly be attributed to his character. origin of a man, which is the pure effect of social relations. The proof that Cotrim had pious feelings was found in his love for his children, and in the pain he suffered when Sara died a few months later; irrefutable proof, I think, and not the only one. He was treasurer of a brotherhood, and brother of several brotherhoods, and even a redeemed brother of one of these, which is not in keeping with the reputation of avarice; The truth is that the benefit had not fallen to the ground: the brotherhood (of which he was a judge) had ordered his oil portrait to be taken. It wasn't perfect, of course; he had, for example, the habit of sending the news to the newspapers of one or another benefit he practiced — reprehensible or not commendable, I agree; but he excused himself by saying that good deeds were contagious, when public; reason why some weight cannot be denied. I even believe (and in this I pay his highest praise) that he did not, from time to time, practice these benefits except in order to arouse the philanthropy of others; and if that was the intention, it is forceful to confess that publicity became a sine qua non condition. In short, he might owe some attention, but he didn't owe anyone a dollar.","Perhaps Cotrim’s scruples will seem excessive to one who didn’t know that he possessed an extremely honorable character. I myself was unjust with him during the years following ray father’s will. I recognize now that he was a model. They accused him of avarice and I think they were right, but avarice is only the exaggeration of a virtue, and virtues should serve as evaluations. Oversupply is better than deficit. Since he was very cold in his manners, he had enemies who even accused him of being a barbarian. The only fact alleged in that particular was his frequent sending of slaves to the dungeon, from where they would emerge dripping blood. But, alongside the fact that he only sent recalcitrants and runaways, it so happens that, having been long involved in the smuggling of slaves, he’d become accustomed to a certain way of dealing that was a bit harsher than the business required, and one can’t honestly attribute to the original nature of a man what is simply the effect of his social relations. The proof that Cotrim had pious feelings could be found in his love for his children and the grief he suffered when Sara died a few months after that. Irrefutable proof, I think, and not the only one.

The truth is that the beneficence didn’t fall on barren ground: the brotherhood (of which he was a judge) ordered a portrait of him in oils to be painted. He wasn’t perfect, needless to say. He had, for example, the bad habit of letting the press know about his various charities—a reprehensible and not praiseworthy custom I must agree. But he defended himself by saying that good works were contagious when public. An argument that’s not without some weight. I do believe (and here I give him the highest praise) that he only practiced those occasional charities with an aim to arousing the philanthropy of others, and if such was his intent, I must confess that publicity is a sine qua","Cotrim’s scruples may seem excessive to those unaware that he possessed a ferociously honorable character. I myself treated him unfairly during the years after my father’s estate was settled. I recognize now that he was a paragon. People accused him of avarice, and I believe they were right; but avarice is nothing more than the exaggeration of a virtue, and virtues should be like budgets: better a surplus than a deficit. Since he had a brusque way about him, he had enemies, and they went so far as to accuse him of savagery. The only thing they alleged on this score was that he often sent slaves to the Dungeon,1 from which they would descend streaming with blood; but, apart from the fact that he only sent runaways and incorrigibles, it so happens that, having dealt for so long in the smuggling of slaves, he had become somewhat used to the slightly harsher treatment required by that sort of business, and one cannot honestly attribute to a man’s original nature that which is the pure effect of social relations.

He was the treasurer of a fraternal order, and a member of several religious societies, even a perpetual brother2 in one of them, which hardly fits with his reputation as a miser; although the truth is that this charity had its own benefits: the brotherhood (of which he had been a board member) had an oil portrait painted of him. He was not perfect, certainly; he had the fault of sending notes to the newspapers about this or that charitable act of his—a reprehensible fault, or at least not one to be lauded, I agree; but he excused himself by saying that good deeds were contagious when made public, an argument to which one cannot deny some weight. I truly believe (and in this I see his greatest merit) that he practiced these occasional charitable acts only with the aim of arousing the philanthropy of others; and if this was his intention, one must admit that publicity was a sine qua"

"A resposta foi compelir-me fortemente a olhar para baixo, e a ver os séculos que continuavam a passar, velozes e turbulentos, as gerações que se superpunham às gerações, umas tristes, como os Hebreus do cativeiro, outras alegres, como os devassos de Cômodo, e todas elas pontuais na sepultura. Quis fugir, mas uma força misteriosa me retinha os pés; então disse comigo: “Bem, os séculos vão passando, chegará o meu, e passará também, até o último, que me dará a decifração da eternidade”. E fixei os olhos, e continuei a ver as idades, que vinham chegando e passando, já então tranquilo e resoluto, não sei até se alegre. Talvez alegre. Cada século trazia a sua porção de sombra e de luz, de apatia e de combate, de verdade e de erro e o seu cortejo de sistemas, de ideias novas, de novas ilusões; em cada um deles rebentavam as verduras de uma primavera, e amareleciam depois, para remoçar mais tarde. Ao passo que a vida tinha assim uma regularidade de calendário, fazia-se a história e a civilização, e o homem, nu e desarmado, armava-se e vestia-se, construía o tugúrio e o palácio, a rude aldeia e Tebas de cem portas, criava a ciência, que perscruta, e a arte que enleva, fazia-se orador, mecânico, filósofo, corria a face do globo, descia ao ventre da terra, subia à esfera das nuvens, colaborando assim na obra misteriosa, com que entretinha a necessidade da vida e a melancolia do desamparo. Meu olhar, enfarado e distraído, viu enfim chegar o século presente, e atrás dele os futuros. Aquele vinha ágil, destro, vibrante, cheio de si, um pouco difuso, audaz, sabedor, mas ao cabo tão miserável como os primeiros, e assim passou e assim passaram os outros, com a mesma rapidez e igual monotonia. Redobrei de atenção; fitei a vista; ia enfim ver o último — o último! Mas então já a rapidez da marcha era tal, que escapava a toda a compreensão; ao pé dela o relâmpago seria um século. Talvez por isso entraram os objetos a trocarem-se; uns cresceram, outros minguaram, outros perderam-se no ambiente; um nevoeiro cobriu tudo — menos o hipopótamo que ali me trouxera, e que aliás começou a diminuir, a diminuir, a diminuir, até ficar do tamanho de um gato. Era efetivamente um gato. Encarei-o bem; era o meu gato Sultão, que brincava à porta da alcova, com uma bola de papel…","The answer was to strongly compel me to look down, and to see the centuries that continued to pass, swift and turbulent, the generations that were superimposed on generations, some sad, like the Hebrews of captivity, others joyful, like the profligates of Comfortable, and all of them punctual in the grave. I wanted to run away, but a mysterious force held me back; then I said to myself: “Well, the centuries go by, mine will arrive, and it will also pass, until the last one, which will give me the deciphering of eternity”. And I fixed my eyes, and I continued to see the ages, which were coming and going, now calm and resolute, I don't know how to be happy. Perhaps cheerful. Each century brought its share of shadow and light, of apathy and combat, of truth and error and its procession of systems, of new ideas, of new illusions; in each one of them the greens of a spring burst forth, and then turned yellow, to be renewed later. While life thus had the regularity of a calendar, history and civilization were made, and man, naked and unarmed, armed himself and dressed himself, built his hut and palace, the rude village and Thebes of a hundred doors, created science, which scrutinizes, and art that enchants, became an orator, mechanic, philosopher, ran the face of the globe, descended to the womb of the earth, ascended to the sphere of clouds, thus collaborating in the mysterious work, with that entertained the necessity of life and the melancholy of helplessness. My gaze, bored and distracted, finally saw the present century arrive, and the future ones behind it. That one came agile, dexterous, vibrant, full of himself, a little diffuse, audacious, knowing, but in the end as miserable as the first ones, and so it passed and so did the others, with the same speed and the same monotony. I redoubled my attention; I gazed at the view; I was finally going to see the last — the last! But by then the speed of the march was such that it was beyond all comprehension; at her feet the lightning would be a century. Maybe that's why the objects came in to change; some grew, others waned, others were lost in the environment; a fog covered everything except the hippopotamus that had brought me there, and which in fact began to shrink, shrink, shrink, until it was the size of a cat. It was effectively a cat. I faced him well; it was my cat Sultan, who was playing at the door of the alcove, with a ball of paper…","Her answer was to force me to look down below and watch the centuries that were still passing, swift and turbulent, the generations that were superimposed on generations, some sad like the Hebrews of the Captivity, others merry like Commodus’ profligates, and all of them punctual for the tomb. I tried to flee but a mysterious force held back my feet. Then I said to myself: “Fine, the centuries keep passing, mine will arrive and it will pass, too, right down to the last one, which will decipher eternity for me.” And I fixed my gaze on them and continued watching the ages, which kept coming and passing, calm and resolute now. I don’t know, but I may even have been happy. Happy perhaps. Each century brought its portion of light and shadow, apathy and combat, truth and error, and its cortège of systems, new ideas, new illusions.

So in that way life had the regularity of a calendar, history and civilization were being made, and man, naked and unarmed, armed himself and dressed; built hovel and palace, a crude village and Thebes of a Thousand Gates; created science that scrutinizes and art that elevates; made himself orator, mechanic, philosopher, covered the face of the globe; descended into the bowels of the Earth; climbed up to the sphere of the clouds, collaborating in that way in the mysterious work with which he mitigated the necessities of life and the melancholy of abandonment. My gaze, bored and distracted, finally saw the present century arrive, and behind it the future ones. It came along agile, dexterous, vibrant, self-confident, a little diffuse, bold, knowledgeable, but in the end as miserable as the ones before, and so it passed, and that was how the others passed, with the same rapidity and the same monotony. I redoubled my attention, sharpened my sight. I was finally going to see the last—the last! But by then the speed of the march was such that it went beyond all comprehension. At its base a lightning flash would have been a century. Maybe that was why objects began to change. Some grew, others shrank, others were lost in their background. A mist covered everything—except the hippopotamus who had brought me there and who, likewise, began to grow smaller, and smaller, and smaller, until he reached the size of a cat. In fact he was a cat.","Her response was to force me to look downward and watch the swift and turbulent ages as they kept on passing by, generations overtaking generations, some sorrowful, like the Hebrews in captivity, others joyful, like the libertines under Commodus, and all arriving punctually at the grave.

Perhaps even happy. Each age bore its portion of shadow and light, of apathy and combat, of truth and error, with their processions of systems, new ideas, and new illusions; in each of them there burst forth the green of spring, which would yellow, only to bloom again. While life obeyed the regularity of a calendar, history and civilization were made, and man, naked and unarmed, armed and dressed himself, built huts and palaces, humble villages and Thebes of the hundred gates, created science, which scrutinizes, and art, which enraptures, became an orator, a mechanical, a philosopher, girdling the globe, descending to the bowels of the earth, and rising to the sphere of the clouds, thus contributing to the mysterious work with which he staved off the needs of life and the melancholy of abandonment. My eyes, wearied and distracted, at last beheld the present age, and the ages to come behind it. As it came, the former was agile, cunning, vibrant, and self-assured, a bit scattered, bold and learned, but in the end as miserable as the first, and so it passed like all the rest, with the same swiftness and like monotony. I redoubled my attention; I fixed my gaze; I would finally see the end—the end! But by then the speed of the procession was such that it escaped all comprehension; compared to it, a lightning bolt would last a century. Perhaps that was why things set to changing; some grew, others dwindled, others vanished into the air; a fog covered everything—except the hippopotamus that had brought me, and it, for that matter, began to shrink, shrink, and shrink, until it was the size of a cat. It was, in fact, a cat. I looked at it more closely; it was my cat Sultan, playing with a ball of paper by my bedroom door . . ."
"Depois do almoço fui à casa de D. Plácida; achei um molho de ossos, envolto em molambos, estendido sobre um catre velho e nauseabundo; dei-lhe algum dinheiro. No dia seguinte fi-la transportar para a Misericórdia, onde ela morreu uma semana depois. Minto: amanheceu morta; saiu da vida às escondidas, tal qual entrara. Outra vez perguntei, a mim mesmo, como no capítulo LXXV, se era para isto que o sacristão da Sé e a doceira trouxeram D. Plácida à luz, num momento de simpatia específica. Mas adverti logo que, se não fosse D. Plácida, talvez os meus amores com Virgília tivessem sido interrompidos, ou imediatamente quebrados, em plena efervescência; tal foi, portanto, a utilidade da vida de D. Plácida.

Again I asked myself, as in chapter LXXV, if it was for this that the sacristan of the Cathedral and the confectioner brought D. Plácida to light, in a moment of specific sympathy. But I immediately realized that, if it hadn't been for Dona Plácida, perhaps my love affairs with Virgília would have been interrupted, or immediately broken, in full effervescence; such, therefore, was the usefulness of D. Plácida's life. Relative utility, I agree; but what the hell is there absolute in this world?","After breakfast I went to Dona Plácida’s place. I found a bundle of bones wrapped in rags lying on an old and revolting cot. I gave her some money. The next day I had her taken to Misericórdia, where she died a week later. I’m lying. She was found dead in the morning. She’d sneaked out of life just the way she’d come into it. I asked myself again, as in Chapter LXXV, if that was why the sexton of the cathedral and the candymaker had brought Dona Plácida into the world at a specific moment of affection. But I realized immediately that if it hadn’t been for Dona Plácida my affair with Virgília might have been interrupted or broken off suddenly in its full effervescence.

But I soon realized that were it not for Dona Plácida , my affair with Virgília might have been interrupted or broken off entirely in its full bloom; hence, that was what Dona Plácida’s life was good for. A relative utility, I’ll grant you that; but what the deuce is absolute in this world?"

Voluntariamente, comem-se gafanhotos, como o Precursor, ou cousa pior, como Ezequiel;ii logo, o ruim é comível; resta saber se é mais digno do homem disputá-lo, por virtude de uma necessidade natural, ou preferi-lo, para obedecer a uma exaltação religiosa, isto é, modificável, ao passo que a fome é eterna, como a vida e como a morte.","— Disputing it with other men is more logical, because the condition of the contenders is the same, and whoever is stronger takes the bone.

"Mostrei-lhe que não.

Por que bonita, se coxa? Por que coxa, se bonita? Tal era a pergunta que eu vinha fazendo a mim mesmo ao voltar para casa, de noite, sem atinar com a solução do enigma. O melhor que há, quando se não resolve um enigma, é sacudi-lo pela janela fora; foi o que eu fiz; lancei mão de uma toalha e enxotei essa outra borboleta preta, que me adejava no cérebro.

"No dia seguinte, abro uma folha política e leio a notícia de que, por decreto de 13, tínhamos sido nomeados presidente e secretário da província de *** o Lobo Neves e eu.

"Sorriu o filho, eu creio que também sorri, e tudo acabou em pura galhofa. Virgília estava serena e risonha, tinha o aspecto das vidas imaculadas. Nenhum olhar suspeito, nenhum gesto que pudesse denunciar nada; uma igualdade de palavra e de espírito, uma dominação sobre si mesma, que pareciam e talvez fossem raras.

"Lobo Neves, a princípio, metia-me grandes sustos. Pura ilusão! Como adorasse a mulher, não se vexava de mo dizer muitas vezes; achava que Virgília era a perfeição mesma, um conjunto de qualidades sólidas e finas, amorável, elegante, austera, um modelo. E a confiança não parava aí. De fresta que era, chegou a porta escancarada. Um dia confessou-me que trazia uma triste carcoma na existência; faltava-lhe a glória pública. Animei-o; disse-lhe muitas cousas bonitas, que ele ouviu com aquela unção religiosa de um desejo que não quer acabar de morrer; então compreendi que a ambição dele andava cansada de bater as asas, sem poder abrir o voo. Dias depois disse-me todos os seus tédios e desfalecimentos, as amarguras engolidas, as raivas sopitadas; contou-me que a vida política era um tecido de invejas, despeitos, intrigas, perfídias, interesses, vaidades.

I cheered him up; I told him many beautiful things, which he heard with that religious anointing of a desire that doesn't want to finish dying; then I understood that his ambition was tired of flapping its wings, unable to open its flight. A few days later, he told me about all his boredom and fainting spells, the bitterness he had swallowed, the anger he had spewed out; he told me that political life was a fabric of envy, spite, intrigue, treachery, interests, vanities.

"Se não contei a morte, não conto igualmente a missa do sétimo dia. A tristeza do Damasceno era profunda; esse pobre homem parecia uma ruína. Quinze dias depois estive com ele; continuava inconsolável, e dizia que a dor grande com que Deus o castigara fora ainda aumentada com a que lhe infligiram os homens. Não me disse mais nada. Três semanas depois tornou ao assunto, e então confessou-me que, no meio do desastre irreparável, quisera ter a consolação da presença dos amigos. Doze pessoas apenas, e três quartas partes amigos do Cotrim, acompanharam à cova o cadáver de sua querida filha. E ele fizera expedir oitenta convites. Ponderei-lhe que as perdas eram tão gerais que bem se podia desculpar essa desatenção aparente. Damasceno abanava a cabeça de um modo incrédulo e triste.","If I didn't count the death, I don't count the seventh day mass either. Damascene's sadness was deep; this poor man looked like a wreck. Fifteen days later I was with him; he was still inconsolable, and said that the great pain with which God had punished him had been increased by the pain inflicted on him by men. He didn't say anything else to me. Three weeks later he returned to the subject, and then confessed to me that, in the midst of the irreparable disaster, he had wanted to have the consolation of the presence of his friends. Only twelve people, and three-quarters of Cotrim's friends, accompanied the corpse of their dear daughter to the grave. And he had sent out eighty invitations. I reasoned to him that the losses were so general that this apparent inattention could well be excused. Damasceno shook his head in an incredulous and sad way.","Since I haven’t recounted the death, neither shall I speak about the seventh-day mass. Damasceno’s sadness was profound. The poor man looked like a ruin. I was with him two weeks later. He was still inconsolable and he said that the great pain God had inflicted upon him was increased all the more by that inflicted on him by men. He didn’t tell me anything else. Three weeks later he got back onto the subject and then he confessed to me that in the midst of the irreparable disaster he would have liked to have had the consolation of the presence of his friends. Only twelve people, and three-quarters of them Cotrim’s friends, had accompanied the corpse of his beloved daughter to her grave. And he’d sent out eighty notices. I argued that with the losses being so widespread he could easily forgive that apparent lack of concern.

"Vai em versaletes esse nome. OBLIVION!* Justo é que se deem todas as honras a um personagem tão desprezado e tão digno, conviva da última hora, mas certo. Sabe-o a dama que luziu na aurora do atual reinado, e mais dolorosamente a que ostentou suas graças em flor sob o ministério Paraná, porque esta acha-se mais perto do triunfo, e sente já que outras lhe tomaram o carro. Então, se é digna de si mesma, não teima em espertar a lembrança morta ou expirante; não busca no olhar de hoje a mesma saudação do olhar de ontem, quando eram outros os que encetavam a marcha da vida, de alma alegre e pé veloz. Tempora mutantur.** Compreende que este turbilhão é assim mesmo, leva as folhas do mato e os farrapos do caminho, sem exceção nem piedade; e se tiver um pouco de filosofia, não inveja, mas lastima as que lhe tomaram o carro, porque também elas hão de ser apeadas pelo estribeiro OBLIVION. Espetáculo, cujo fim é divertir o planeta Saturno, que anda muito aborrecido.","Go in small caps that name. OBLIVION!* It is only right that all honor should be given to a character so despised and so worthy, a guest at the last minute, but right. The lady who shone at the dawn of the present reign knows this, and more painfully the one who flaunted her graces in bloom under the Paraná ministry, because she is closer to triumph, and she already feels that others have taken her car. So, if it is worthy of itself, it does not insist on awakening the dead or expiring memory; does not seek in today's gaze the same greeting as in yesterday's gaze, when others began the march of life, with a happy soul and swift foot. Tempora mutantur.** Understand that this whirlwind is just like that, it takes the leaves of the bush and the rags of the path, without exception or mercy; and if he has a little philosophy, he does not envy, but he regrets those who took his car, because they too will have to be dismounted by the steward OBLIVION. Spectacle, whose purpose is to amuse the planet Saturn, which is very bored.","Put that name in small caps. OBLIVION! It’s only proper that all honor be paid to a personage so despised and so worthy, a last-minute guest at the party, but a sure one. The lady who dazzled at the dawn of the present reign knows it and, even more painfully, the one who displayed her charms in bloom during the Paraná ministry, because the latter is closer to triumph and she is already beginning to feel that others have taken her carriage. So if she’s true to herself she won’t persist in a dead or expiring memory. She won’t seek in the looks of today the same greeting as in yesterday’s looks, when it was others who took part in the march of life with a merry heart and a swift foot. Tempora mutantur. She understands that this whirlwind is like that, it carries off the leaves of the forest and the rags of the road without exception or mercy. And if she has a touch of philosophy she won’t envy but will feel sorry for the ones who have taken her carriage because they, too, will be helped down by the footman OBLIVION. A spectacle whose purpose is to amuse the planet Saturn, which is quite bored with it.","Let the name be printed in small capitals. OBLIVION! It is only right that all due honor be given to a figure so despised and so worthy, that tardy but unfailing guest. The lady who shone at the dawn of the current monarchy feels his presence, but it is all the more painful for she who flaunted her blooming charms under the administration of the Marquis of Paraná,2 for her triumph is closer at hand, and she may be given to feeling that her rivals have stolen her carriage. If she is worthy of herself, she will not persist in trying to stir that lifeless or dying memory; she does not seek in today’s gaze the same warmth of yesterday ’s, when those setting out on the march of life were others, their souls gay and their feet swift. Tempora mutantur. She understands the nature of the whirlwind, which carries off the leaves from the grove and the rags from the road, saving none and pitying none; and if she has a shred of philosophy in her, she will not envy, but rather grieve for those who have stolen her carriage, as they, too, will be helped to dismount by that unflagging footman OBLIVION. A spectacle put on to amuse the planet Saturn, which has been quite bored of late."

"Ao fundo, por trás do balcão, estava sentada uma mulher, cujo rosto amarelo e bexiguento não se destacava logo, à primeira vista; mas logo que se destacava era um espetáculo curioso. Não podia ter sido feia; ao contrário, via-se que fora bonita, e não pouco bonita; mas a doença e uma velhice precoce destruíram-lhe a flor das graças. As bexigas tinham sido terríveis; os sinais, grandes e muitos, faziam saliências e encarnas, declives e aclives, e davam uma sensação de lixa grossa, enormemente grossa. Eram os olhos a melhor parte do vulto, e aliás tinham uma expressão singular e repugnante, que mudou, entretanto, logo que eu comecei a falar. Quanto ao cabelo, estava ruço e quase tão poento como os portais da loja. Num dos dedos da mão esquerda fulgia-lhe um diamante. Crê-lo-eis, pósteros? Essa mulher era Marcela.","At the back, behind the counter, sat a woman, whose yellow, pockmarked face was not immediately noticeable at first glance; but as soon as it stood out it was a curious sight. It couldn't have been ugly; on the contrary, you could see that she was pretty, and not unpretty; but illness and premature old age destroyed the flower of his graces. The bladders had been terrible; the signs, large and many, made bumps and reds, slopes and inclines, and gave a sensation of coarse sandpaper, enormously coarse. The eyes were the best part of the figure, and in fact they had a singular and disgusting expression, which changed, however, as soon as I began to speak. As for the hair, it was gray and almost as dusty as the store's portals. On one of the fingers of his left hand a diamond glowed. Will you believe it, posterity?

"Ela derreou os cantos da boca, e moveu a cabeça a um e outro lado; mas esse gesto de indiferença era desmentido por alguma cousa menos definível, menos clara, uma expressão de gosto e de esperança. Não sei por quê, imaginei que a carta imperial da nomeação podia atraí-la à virtude, não digo pela virtude em si mesma, mas por gratidão ao marido. Que ela amava cordialmente a nobreza. Um dos maiores desgostos de nossa vida foi o aparecimento de certo pelintra de legação — da legação da Dalmácia, suponhamos —, o conde B. V., que a namorou durante três meses. Esse homem, vero fidalgo de raça, transtornara um pouco a cabeça de Virgília, que, além do mais, possuía a vocação diplomática. Não chego a alcançar o que seria de mim, se não rebentasse na Dalmácia uma revolução, que derrocou o governo e purificou as embaixadas. Foi sangrenta a revolução, dolorosa, formidável; os jornais, a cada navio que chegava da Europa, transcreviam os horrores, mediam o sangue, contavam as cabeças; toda a gente fremia de indignação e piedade… Eu não, eu abençoava interiormente essa tragédia, que me tirara uma pedrinha do sapato. E depois a Dalmácia era tão longe!","She melted the corners of her mouth, and moved her head this way and that; but this gesture of indifference was belied by something less definable, less clear, an expression of taste and hope. I don't know why, I imagined that the imperial letter of appointment could attract her to virtue, I don't say for virtue itself, but out of gratitude to her husband. That she heartily loved the nobility. One of the greatest regrets of our lives was the appearance of a certain rogue from the legation - from the Dalmatian legation, let us suppose - Count B. V., who dated her for three months. This man, a true nobleman by race, had upset Virgilia's head a little, who, moreover, had a diplomatic vocation. I don't get to what I would be if a revolution didn't break out in Dalmatia, which overthrew the government and purified the embassies. The revolution was bloody, painful, formidable; the newspapers, with each ship that arrived from Europe, transcribed the horrors, measured the blood, counted the heads; everyone trembled with indignation and pity… Not me, I was inwardly blessing this tragedy, which had taken a pebble out of my shoe. And then Dalmatia was so far away!","She turned down the corners of her mouth and shook her head from side to side. But that gesture of indifference was contradicted by something less definable, less clear, an expression of pleasure and expectation. I don’t know why, but I imagined that the imperial letter of nomination was capable of drawing her into virtue, I won’t say because of virtue in herself, but out of gratitude for her husband. Because she was sincerely in love with nobility. One of the greatest displeasures to come up in our life was the appearance of a dandy from a legation—let us call it the legation of Dalmatia—Count B. V., who chased after her for three months. That man, a genuine nobleman by blood, had turned Virgília’s head a little, for she, among other things, had a diplomatic vocation. I can’t get to what might have become of me if a revolution hadn’t broken out in Dalmatia that overthrew the government and cleaned out its embassies. The revolution was bloody, painful, formidable. With every ship arriving from Europe the newspapers described the horrors, calculated the bloodshed, counted the heads. Everybody was seething with indignation and pity … Not I. Inside I blessed the tragedy that had removed a pebble from my shoe. And, then, Dalmatia was so far away!","She let the corners of her mouth sag, and shook her head; but this gesture of indifference was belied by something less definable, less clear, an expression of pleasure and expectation. I can’t say why, but I imagined that the imperial letter of nomination might draw her back to virtue, not for virtue’s sake but out of gratitude to her husband. She had a sincere love of nobility. One of the greatest afflictions to ever buffet our life together had been the appearance of a fop from the legation of—from the legation of Dalmatia, let’s say—one Count B.V., who flirted with her for three months. This man, a true nobleman by blood, turned Virgília’s head somewhat; on top of it all, she had a talent for diplomacy. I can’t say what might have become of me if a revolution hadn’t broken out in Dalmatia, toppling the government and purging the embassies. It was a bloody revolution, harrowing and formidable; at each ship that arrived from Europe, the newspapers transcribed the fresh horrors, measured the blood spilt, counted the severed heads; all groaned with indignation and pity . . .

I explained that it had been a mistake, and so on . . . But it wasn’t, I believe it was pure distraction.

"Vamos lá; retifique o seu nariz, e tornemos ao emplasto. Deixemos a história com os seus caprichos de dama elegante. Nenhum de nós pelejou a batalha de Salamina, nenhum escreveu a confissão de Augsburgo; pela minha parte, se alguma vez me lembro de Cromwell, é só pela ideia de que Sua Alteza, com a mesma mão que trancara o parlamento, teria imposto aos ingleses o emplasto Brás Cubas. Não se riam dessa vitória comum da farmácia e do puritanismo. Quem não sabe que ao pé de cada bandeira grande, pública, ostensiva, há muitas vezes várias outras bandeiras modestamente particulares, que se hasteiam e flutuam à sombra daquela, e não poucas vezes lhe sobrevivem? Mal comparando, é como a arraia-miúda, que se acolhia à sombra do castelo feudal; caiu este e a arraia ficou. Verdade é que se fez graúda e castelã… Não, a comparação não presta.","Come on; straighten your nose, and let's go back to the poultice. Let's leave history to its elegant lady's whims.

Don't laugh at this common victory of pharmacy and puritanism. Who does not know that at the foot of each large, public, ostentatious flag, there are often several other modestly private flags, which are raised and floated in the shadow of that one, and not infrequently outlive it? Barely comparing, it is like the small ray, which sheltered in the shadow of the feudal castle; This one fell and the stingray stayed. The truth is that she became a big girl and a chatelaine… No, the comparison is useless.","Let’s go. Straighten out your nose and let’s get back to the poultice.

"Vária foi a impressão deste discurso. Quanto à forma, ao rapto eloquente, à parte literária e filosófica, a opinião foi só uma; disseram-me todos que era completo, e que de uma barretina ninguém ainda conseguira tirar tantas ideias. Mas a parte política foi considerada por muitos deplorável; alguns achavam o meu discurso um desastre parlamentar; enfim, vieram dizer-me que outros me davam já em oposição, entrando nesse número os oposicionistas da Câmara, que chegaram a insinuar a conveniência de uma moção de desconfiança. Repeli energicamente tal interpretação, que não era só errônea, mas caluniosa, à vista da notoriedade com que eu sustentava o gabinete; acrescentei que a necessidade de diminuir a barretina não era tamanha que não pudesse esperar alguns anos; e que, em todo caso, eu transigiria na extensão do corte, contentando-me com três quartos de polegada ou menos; enfim, dado mesmo que a minha ideia não fosse adotada, bastava-me tê-la iniciado no parlamento.","Various was the impression of this speech. As for the form, the eloquent abduction, the literary and philosophical part, there was only one opinion; everyone told me that it was complete, and that no one had yet managed to get so many ideas out of a shako.

I added that the need to reduce the size of the shako was not so great that it couldn’t wait a few years and, in any case, I was ready to compromise in the extent of the cut, being content with three-quarters of an inch or less.

"Com efeito, bastou-me atentar no costume do faquir. Sabe o leitor que o faquir gasta longas horas a olhar para a ponta do nariz, com o fim único de ver a luz celeste. Quando ele finca os olhos na ponta do nariz, perde o sentimento das cousas externas, embeleza-se no invisível, apreende o impalpável, desvincula-se da terra, dissolve-se, eteriza-se. Essa sublimação do ser pela ponta do nariz é o fenômeno mais excelso do espírito, e a faculdade de a obter não pertence ao faquir somente: é universal. Cada homem tem necessidade e poder de contemplar o seu próprio nariz, para o fim de ver a luz celeste, e tal contemplação, cujo efeito é a subordinação do universo a um nariz somente, constitui o equilíbrio das sociedades. Se os narizes se contemplassem exclusivamente uns aos outros, o gênero humano não chegaria a durar dois séculos: extinguia-se com as primeiras tribos.","In fact, it was enough for me to pay attention to the fakir's custom. The reader knows that the fakir spends long hours looking at the tip of his nose, with the sole purpose of seeing the celestial light. When he fixes his eyes on the tip of his nose, he loses the feeling of external things, he beautifies himself in the invisible, apprehends the impalpable, detaches himself from the earth, dissolves, etherizes himself. This sublimation of the being through the tip of the nose is the most exalted phenomenon of the spirit, and the faculty of obtaining it does not belong to the fakir alone: it is universal. Every man has the need and power to contemplate his own nose, in order to see the celestial light, and such contemplation, the effect of which is the subordination of the universe to a single nose, constitutes the balance of societies. If noses looked exclusively at each other, the human race would not have lasted two centuries: it was extinct with the first tribes.","All I needed, really, was to follow the habits of a fakir. As the reader knows, a fakir spends long hours looking at the tip of his nose with his only aim that of seeing the celestial light. When he fixes his eyes on the tip of his nose he loses his sense of outside things, becomes enraptured with the invisible, learns the intangible, becomes detached from the world, dissolves, is aetherialized. That sublimation of the being by the tip of the nose is the most lofty phenomenon of the spirit, and the faculty for obtaining it doesn’t belong to the fakir alone. It’s universal. Every man has the need and the power to contemplate his own nose with an aim to see the celestial light, and such contemplation, whose effect is subordination to just one nose, constitutes the equilibrium of societies. If noses only contemplated each other, humankind wouldn’t have lasted two centuries, it would have died out with the earliest tribes.","Indeed, I had only to attend to the habits of the fakir. The reader will know that a fakir spends hours upon hours staring at the tip of his nose with the sole aim of beholding the celestial light. When he trains his eyes on the tip of his nose, he loses all sense of the outside world, becomes enraptured in the invisible, grasps the impalpable, unlashes himself from the earth, dissolves, becomes one with the ether. This sublimation of one’s being via the tip of the nose is the loftiest phenomenon of the spirit, and its obtainment is not the sole province of the fakir: it is universal. Every man has both the need and the power to contemplate his own nose so as to behold the celestial light, and such contemplation, the effect of which is the subordination of the universe to nothing more than a nose, ensures the equilibrium of societies. If noses only contemplated one another, the human race would never have lasted two centuries: it would have extinguished itself during the first tribes."
"Sim, eu era esse garção bonito, airoso, abastado; e facilmente se imagina que mais de uma dama inclinou diante de mim a fronte pensativa, ou levantou para mim os olhos cobiçosos.

A que me cativou foi uma dama espanhola, Marcela, a “linda Marcela”, como lhe chamavam os rapazes do tempo. E tinham razão os rapazes.

But come on; or whether to say all or nothing. The one that captivated me was a Spanish lady, Marcela, the “beautiful Marcela”, as the boys of the time called her. And the boys were right. She was the daughter of an Asturian gardener; she told me so herself, on a day of sincerity, because the accepted opinion is that she was born to a scholar in Madrid, a victim of the French invasion, wounded, imprisoned, shot at when she was only twelve years old. Things of Spain. Whoever the father was, however, scholar or gardener, the truth is that Marcela did not possess rustic innocence, and could barely understand the morals of the code.

Of them all, however, the one who captivated me immediately was a … a … I don’t know if I should say it. This book is chaste, at least in its intention. In its intention it is ever so chaste. But out with it, either you say everything or nothing. The one who captivated me was a Spanish woman, Marcela, “beautiful Marcela,” as the boys of those times called her. And the boys were right. She was the daughter of a gardener from Asturias. She told me so herself during a day of sincerity, because the accepted version was that she’d been born to a lawyer from Madrid, a victim of the French invasion, wounded, jailed, and shot when she was only twelve years old. Cosas de España. Whatever her father was, however, lawyer or gardener, the truth is that Marcela didn’t have any rustic innocence and hardly understood the morality of the law. She was a good girl, cheerful, without scruples, a little hampered by the austerity of the times, which wouldn’t allow her to haul her flightiness and her gossip games through the streets, fond of luxury, impatient, a friend of money and young men. That year she was madly in love with a certain Xavier, a wealthy and tubercular fellow—a pearl.","Yes, I was that handsome, graceful, wealthy lad; and one may easily imagine that more than one lady inclined a pensive brow in my direction, or raised a pair of covetous eyes to meet mine.

But let’s have at it, and say all or nothing. My capturer was a Spanish lady, Marcela, “lovely Marcela,” as the young men of the day called her. And they were right. She was the daughter of a gardener from Asturias; she told me so herself, on a sincere day, because the accepted version had it that she was born to a lawyer from Madrid, a victim of the French invasion who was wounded, imprisoned, and shot when she was just twelve years old. Cosas de España. Whoever he might have been, her father, lawyer or gardener, the truth is that Marcela lacked any rustic innocence, and barely understood the morality of the law at that. She was pretty, agreeable, sans scruples, and somewhat hampered by the austerity of the time, which kept her from parading her fancies and fine carriages down the streets; luxurious, impatient, fond of money and of young men. That year, she was fairly dying for love of a certain Xavier, a wealthy fellow, and consumptive to boot—a gem."
"Não obstante os meus quarenta e tantos anos, como eu amasse a harmonia da família, entendi não tratar o casamento sem primeiro falar ao Cotrim. Ele ouviu-me e respondeu-me seriamente que não tinha opinião em negócio de parentes seus. Podiam supor-lhe algum interesse, se acaso louvasse as raras prendas de Nhã-loló; por isso calava-se. Mais: estava certo de que a sobrinha nutria por mim verdadeira paixão, mas se ela o consultasse, o seu conselho seria negativo. Não era levado por nenhum ódio; apreciava as minhas boas qualidades — não se fartava de as elogiar, como era de justiça; e pelo que respeita a Nhã-loló, não chegaria jamais a negar que era noiva excelente; mas daí a aconselhar o casamento ia um abismo.","Despite my late forties, as I loved the harmony of the family, I understood not to deal with marriage without first talking to Cotrim. He listened to me and answered me seriously that he had no opinion in the business of his relatives. They might have assumed some interest in him, if by chance he praised Nhã-loló's rare gifts; that's why he kept quiet. More: I was sure that my niece had a real passion for me, but if she consulted him, his advice would be negative. He was not driven by any hatred; he appreciated my good qualities — he was not tired of praising them, as was fair; and as far as Nhã-loló is concerned, he would never be able to deny that she was an excellent bride; but from there to advising marriage went an abyss.","In spite of my forty-some-odd years, since I loved harmony in the family, I understood that I shouldn’t bring up the matter of marriage without first speaking to Cotrim. He listened to me and answered seriously that he had no opinions when it came to his relatives. They might imagine some special interest if he happened to praise the rare qualities of Nhã-loló. That’s why he kept quiet. Furthermore, he was sure that his niece had a real passion for me, but if she consulted him his advice would be negative. It wasn’t brought about by any hate, he appreciated my good qualities—they couldn’t be more praiseworthy, it was true, and as for Nhã-loló, he could never deny that she was an excellent bride, but from there to advise marriage there was a wide gap.","Despite my forty-odd years, I believed that I should not propose the marriage before first speaking with Cotrim, for I prized family harmony. He heard me out and responded gravely that he would not opine on the affairs of his relatives. He might be suspected of harboring some interest if he were to praise Nhã-loló’s rare talents; he would thus be silent. What’s more, though he was convinced that his niece bore a true passion for me, if she were to consult him he would counsel against the match. This was not out of any bad feeling; he appreciated my virtues and never tired of praising them, as was only fair; and as for Nhã-loló, he would never deny that she would make an excellent bride; but between there and counseling marriage lay an abyss."

"Quanto a mim, se vos disser que li o bilhete três ou quatro vezes, naquele dia, acreditai-o, que é verdade; se vos disser mais que o reli no dia seguinte, antes e depois do almoço, podeis crê-lo, é a realidade pura. Mas se vos disser a comoção que tive, duvidai um pouco da asserção, e não a aceiteis sem provas. Nem então, nem ainda agora cheguei a discernir o que experimentei. Era medo e não era medo; era dó e não era dó; era vaidade e não era vaidade; enfim, era amor sem amor, isto é, sem delírio; e tudo isso dava uma combinação assaz complexa e vaga, uma cousa que não podereis entender, como eu não entendi.

It was fear and it wasn't fear; it was pity and it was not pity; it was vanity and it was not vanity; in short, it was love without love, that is, without delirium; and all this made for a rather complex and vague combination, something that you will not be able to understand, as I did not understand.

"E estas três palavras últimas, expressas com muita ênfase, produziram em toda a assembleia um frêmito de admiração e pasmo. Pois esse homem tão dado, tão simples, além de pleitear com poetas, discreteava com duquesas! Um Bocage e uma Cadaval! Ao contato de tal homem, as damas sentiam-se superfinas; os varões olhavam-no com respeito, alguns, com inveja, não raros, com incredulidade. Ele, entretanto, ia caminho, a acumular adjetivo sobre adjetivo, advérbio sobre advérbio, a desfiar todas as rimas de tirano e de usurpador. Era à sobremesa; ninguém já pensava em comer. No intervalo das glosas, corria um burburinho alegre, um palavrear de estômagos satisfeitos; os olhos moles e úmidos, ou vivos e cálidos, espreguiçavam-se ou saltitavam de uma ponta à outra da mesa, atulhada de doces e frutas, aqui o ananás em fatias, ali o melão em talhadas, as compoteiras de cristal deixando ver o doce de coco, finamente ralado, amarelo como uma gema — ou então o melado escuro e grosso, não longe do queijo e do cará. De quando em quando um riso jovial, amplo, desabotoado, um riso de família, vinha quebrar a gravidade política do banquete. No meio do interesse grande e comum, agitavam-se também os pequenos e particulares. As moças falavam das modinhas que haviam de cantar ao cravo, e do minuete e do solo inglês;iv nem faltava matrona que prometesse bailar um oitavado de compasso, só para mostrar como folgara nos seus bons tempos de criança. Um sujeito, ao pé de mim, dava a outro notícia recente dos negros novos que estavam a vir, segundo cartas que recebera de Luanda, uma carta em que o sobrinho lhe dizia ter já negociado cerca de quarenta cabeças, e outra carta em que… Trazia-as justamente na algibeira, mas não as podia ler naquela ocasião. O que afiançava é que podíamos contar, só nessa viagem, uns cento e vinte negros, pelo menos.","And these last three words, expressed with great emphasis, produced in the whole assembly a thrill of admiration and amazement. For this man, so given, so simple, besides pleading with poets, also discreetly with duchesses! A Bocage and a Cadaval! At the touch of such a man, the ladies felt superfine; the men looked at him with respect, some with envy, often with disbelief. He, however, was on his way, piling adjective on adjective, adverb on adverb, unraveling all the rhymes of tyrant and usurper. It was for dessert; no one ever thought about eating. In between the glosses, there was a merry buzz, the chatter of satisfied stomachs; her eyes, soft and moist, or alive and warm, stretched or skipped from one end of the table to the other, strewn with sweets and fruits, here the sliced pineapple, there the sliced melon, the crystal bowls showing the sweets. of coconut, finely grated, yellow as a yolk — or else the thick, dark molasses, not far from the cheese and yams. From time to time a jovial, broad, unbuttoned laugh, a family laugh, would break the banquet's political gravity. In the midst of the great and common interest, the small and private ones were also agitated. The girls talked about the modinhas they would sing on the harpsichord, and the minuet and the English solo;iv there was no lack of matron who promised to dance an octave of a bar, just to show how much fun she had enjoyed in her good childhood days. A guy next to me was giving another recent news about the new blacks who were coming, according to letters he had received from Luanda, a letter in which his nephew told him he had already traded about forty heads, and another letter in which… He had them right in his pocket, but he couldn't read them on that occasion. What he assured was that we could count, on this trip alone, at least one hundred and twenty blacks.","And those last three words, expressed quite emphatically, produced a flutter of admiration and amazement in all assembled because so cordial and so simple a man, in addition to competing with poets, was close to duchesses! A Bocage and a Cadaval! Contact with such a man made the ladies feel superrefined. The males looked on him with respect, some with envy, no few with disbelief. He, meanwhile, went along piling adjective on adjective, adverb on adverb, listing everything that rhymed with tyrant and usurper. It was dessert time. No one was thinking anymore about eating. During the intervals in the glosses a merry murmur went about, the chatter of full stomachs. The eyes, sluggish and moist or lively and warm, lounged or leaped about the table loaded with sweets and fruit—pineapple wedges here, melon slices there, the crystal dessert dishes displaying the thinly shredded cocoanut sweets, yellow as an egg yolk—or the molasses, thick and dark, not far from the cheese. From time to time a full, jovial, unbuttoned laugh—a family laugh—would come along to break the political gravity of the banquet. In the midst of the great and common interest, the small and private ones were also moving about. The girls spoke about the modinhas they were going to sing to the accompaniment of the harpsichord, the minuets, the English airs. Nor was there any lack of a matron who promised to perform an eight-beat dance just to show them how she had enjoyed herself in the good old days of childhood. One fellow, next to me, was passing on to another a recent report on the new slaves who were on their way according to letters he’d received from Luanda, one letter in which his nephew told him that he’d already made a deal for about forty head, and another in which … He had them right there in his pocket but he couldn’t read them on that occasion. What he guaranteed is that from this one shipment we can count on some hundred and twenty slaves at least.","And these last three words, spoken with considerable emphasis, sent a quiver of admiration and astonishment through all assembled. This affable, artless man not only sparred with poets, but also discoursed with duchesses! A Bocage and a Cadaval! At coming into contact with such a man, the ladies felt themselves superbly refined; the men looked on him with respect, some with envy, not a few with incredulity. He, all the while, sailed along, piling adjective upon adjective, adverb upon adverb, running through all of the rhymes for tyrant and usurper. Dessert had come; nobody thought of eating. In between glosses, there came a cheerful murmur, the chatter of satisfied stomachs; languid and moist eyes, or lively and bright ones, sprawled out or darted up and down the table, which was crowded with sweets and fruits: here slices of pineapple, there cuts of melon, the glass serving dishes revealing the finely grated coconut sweet, gleaming yolk-yellow; farther along, the dark, thick molasses, not far from the cheese and the sweet yams. Now and then a jovial, hearty, unselfconscious laugh, the way one laughs when among family, would come to break through the political solemnity of the banquet. Alongside the grand common interest, smaller, personal matters stirred as well. The young ladies spoke of the songs they would sing at the harpsichord, of minuets and English solo dancing; and there was, of course, a matron who swore she’d dance a measure or two, just to show how she’d made merry in her girlhood. A fellow next to me was telling another the latest about the new blacks that were coming in, according to letters he’d received from Luanda, one letter in which his nephew reported he’d already acquired around forty, and another letter in which . . . He was carrying them right there in his pocket, but couldn’t read them out just yet. What he did hazard is that this journey alone would bring us some hundred and twenty blacks at the very least."

"O que vexava a Nhã-loló era o pai. A facilidade com que ele se metera com os apostadores punha em relevo antigos costumes e afinidades sociais, e Nhã-loló chegara a temer que tal sogro me parecesse indigno. Era notável a diferença que ela fazia de si mesma; estudava-se e estudava-me. A vida elegante e polida atraía-a, principalmente porque lhe parecia o meio mais seguro de ajustar as nossas pessoas. Nhã-loló observava, imitava, adivinhava; ao mesmo tempo dava-se ao esforço de mascarar a inferioridade da família. Naquele dia, porém, a manifestação do pai foi tamanha que a entristeceu grandemente. Eu busquei então diverti-la do assunto, dizendo-lhe muitas chanças e motes de bom-tom; vãos esforços, que não a alegravam mais. Era tão profundo o abatimento, tão expressivo o desânimo, que cheguei a atribuir a Nhã-loló a intenção positiva de separar, no meu espírito, a sua causa da causa do pai. Este sentimento pareceu-me de grande elevação; era uma afinidade mais entre nós.","What vexed Nhã-loló was her father. The ease with which he got involved with gamblers highlighted old customs and social affinities, and Nhã-loló had come to fear that such a father-in-law would seem unworthy to me. The difference she made to herself was remarkable; studied and studied me. The elegant and polished life appealed to her, mainly because it seemed to her the surest way to adjust our people. Nhã-loló observed, imitated, guessed; at the same time, he made an effort to mask the family's inferiority. On that day, however, her father's manifestation was such that it saddened her greatly. I then sought to amuse her from the subject, telling her many chances and good-natured mottos; vain efforts, which no longer cheered her up. The despondency was so deep, the discouragement so expressive, that I came to attribute to Nhã-loló the positive intention of separating, in my mind, his cause from his father's cause. This feeling seemed to me of great elevation; it was more of an affinity between us.","What had upset Nhã-loló was her father. The ease with which he’d joined the bettors brought out old habits and social affinities and Nhã-loló had become afraid that a father-in-law like that would seem unworthy to me. The difference she was making in herself was notable. She would study herself and study me. Elegant and polished life attracted her, principally because she thought it the surest way to blend our personalities. Nhã-loló would observe, imitate, and guess. At the same time she undertook an effort to conceal her family’s inferiority. On that day, however, her father’s display was so great that it made her quite sad. I then sought to get her mind off the matter, telling her a string of jokes and jests, all in good taste. A vain effort that didn’t make her any happier. Her depression was so deep, she was so obviously downcast, that I came to see in Nhã-loló the positive intention of separating her cause from her father’s cause in my mind. I thought that a most elevated feeling. It was one more affinity we had in common.","What mortified Nhã-loló was her father. The ease with which he had fallen in with the bettors had thrown old habits and social affinities into relief, and Nhã-loló had come to fear that I might find him an unworthy father-in-law. The way she set herself apart was remarkable; she studied herself and she studied me. Elegant, refined life attracted her, principally because it struck her as the most reliable means by which to make us suit one another. Nhã-loló would observe, imitate, and infer; at the same time, she dedicated herself to masking her family’s inferiority. On that day, however, her father manifested it so extravagantly that she was saddened to no end. I sought to distract her from the matter with jests and gentle witticisms; all in vain, for they no longer lifted her spirits.

"Creiam-me, o menos mau é recordar; ninguém se fie da felicidade presente; há nela uma gota da baba de Caim.

"Há em cada empresa, afeição ou idade um ciclo inteiro da vida humana. O primeiro número do meu jornal encheu-me a alma de uma vasta aurora, coroou-me de verduras, restituiu-me a lepidez da mocidade. Seis meses depois batia a hora da velhice, e daí a duas semanas, a da morte, que foi clandestina, como a de D. Plácida. No dia em que o jornal amanheceu morto, respirei como um homem que vem de longo caminho. De modo que, se eu disser que a vida humana nutre de si mesma outras vidas, mais ou menos efêmeras, como o corpo alimenta os seus parasitas, creio não dizer uma cousa inteiramente absurda. Mas, para não arriscar essa figura menos nítida e adequada, prefiro uma imagem astronômica: o homem executa à roda do grande mistério um movimento duplo de rotação e translação; tem os seus dias, desiguais como os de Júpiter, e deles compõe o seu ano mais ou menos longo.","There is in each company, affection or age an entire cycle of human life. The first issue of my newspaper filled my soul with a vast dawn, crowned me with greens, restored my youthful spirits. Six months later, the time of old age struck, and two weeks later, the time of death, which was clandestine, like D. Plácida's. The day the newspaper dawned dead, I breathed like a man who has come a long way. So if I say that human life nourishes other lives of itself, more or less ephemeral, as the body nourishes its parasites, I think I am not saying something completely absurd. But, in order not to risk this less clear and adequate figure, I prefer an astronomical image: man performs around the great mystery a double movement of rotation and translation; it has its days, unequal like those of Jupiter, and from them it makes up its more or less long year.","Every enterprise, attachment, or age contains a complete cycle of human life.

On the day the paper was found dead in the morning, I sighed deeply, like a man who’d come back from a long journey. So if I were to say that human life feeds other more or less ephemeral lives, the way a body feeds its parasites, I don’t think I would be saying something completely absurd. But in order not to risk a less neat and adequate image like that, I prefer an astronomical one: man executes, to the turn of the wheel of the great mystery, a double movement of rotation and translation.

On the day when morning found the newspaper dead, I sighed like a man come from a long journey. And so if I say that human life nourishes and gives rise to other lives, which may be more or less fleeting, just as the body feeds its parasites, I believe that I will not be saying something entirely absurd.

"Meu espírito deu um salto para trás, como se descobrisse uma serpente diante de si. Encarei o Lobo Neves, fixamente, imperiosamente, a ver se lhe apanhava algum pensamento oculto… Nem sombra disso; o olhar vinha direito e franco, a placidez do rosto era natural, não violenta, uma placidez salpicada de alegria. Respirei, e não tive ânimo de olhar para Virgília; senti por cima da página o olhar dela, que me pedia também a mesma cousa, e disse que sim, que iria. Na verdade, um presidente, uma presidenta, um secretário, era resolver as cousas de um modo administrativo.","My spirit jumped back, as if discovering a snake before it. I stared at Lobo Neves, fixedly, imperiously, to see if I could catch any hidden thoughts… Not even a shadow of it; the look was straight and frank, the placidity of the face was natural, non-violent, a placidity sprinkled with joy. I took a breath, and didn't have the courage to look at Virgília; I felt her gaze across the page, asking me the same thing, and I said yes, I would. In fact, a president, a president, a secretary, was to solve things in an administrative way.","My spirit gave a leap backward, as if I’d seen a snake in front of me. I faced Lobo Neves, stared at him demandingly to see if some hidden thought had caught hold of him … Not a shadow of it. His look was direct and open, the calmness of his face was natural, not forced, a calmness sprinkled with joy. I took a deep breath and didn’t have the courage to look at Virgília. I could feel her gaze over the page, also asking me the same. And I said yes, I’d go. In all truth, a president, a president’s wife, a secretary was a way of resolving things in an administrative way.","My spirit leaped back as if it had spotted a snake. I looked hard at Lobo Neves to see if I could make out any hidden reflection . . . Not a shadow; his gaze was direct and frank, his features naturally serene and peaceable, a serenity dotted with satisfaction.

Indeed, to have a president, a presidentess, and a secretary was a fine administrative solution."

"Era minha sobrinha. Apanhei-a do chão, beijei-a muitas vezes; a pequena, espantada, empurrava-me o ombro com a mãozinha, quebrando o corpo para descer… Nisto, aparece-me à porta um chapéu, e logo um homem, o Cotrim, nada menos que o Cotrim. Eu estava tão comovido, que deixei a filha e lancei-me aos braços do pai. Talvez essa efusão o desconcertou um pouco; é certo que me pareceu acanhado. Simples prólogo. Daí a pouco falávamos como bons amigos velhos. Nenhuma alusão ao passado, muitos planos de futuro, promessa de jantarmos em casa um do outro. Não deixei de dizer que essa troca de jantares podia ser que tivesse uma curta interrupção, porque eu andava com ideias de uma viagem ao Norte. Sabina olhou para o Cotrim, o Cotrim, para Sabina; ambos concordaram que essas ideias não tinham senso comum. Que diacho podia eu achar no Norte? Pois não era na Corte, em plena Corte, que devia continuar a luzir, a meter num chinelo os rapazes do tempo? Que, na verdade, nenhum havia que se me comparasse; ele, Cotrim, acompanhava-me de longe, e não obstante uma briga ridícula, teve sempre interesse, orgulho, vaidade nos meus triunfos. Ouvia o que se dizia a meu respeito, nas ruas e nas salas; era um concerto de louvores e admirações. E deixa-se isso para ir passar alguns meses na província, sem necessidade, sem motivo sério? A menos que não fosse política…","It was my niece. I picked her up from the floor, kissed her many times; the little girl, startled, pushed my shoulder with her little hand, breaking her body to go down… At this, a hat appears at the door, and then a man, Cotrim, none other than Cotrim. I was so moved that I left the daughter and threw myself into the arms of the father. Perhaps this outpouring disconcerted him a little; Admittedly, he seemed shy to me. Simple prologue. Soon we were talking like good old friends. No allusions to the past, lots of plans for the future, promises to have dinner at each other's houses. I did not fail to say that this exchange of dinners might have a short interruption, because I had ideas about a trip to the North. Sabina looked at Cotrim, Cotrim at Sabina; both agreed that these ideas lacked common sense. What the hell could I find in the North? For wasn't it in the Court, in the heart of the Court, that should continue to shine, to put the boys of the time in a slipper? That, in truth, there was none to compare with me; he, Cotrim, followed me from afar, and despite a ridiculous fight, he always had an interest, pride, and vanity in my triumphs. I listened to what was said about me, in the streets and in the halls; it was a concert of praise and admiration. And do you leave that behind to spend a few months in the province, without need, without serious reason? Unless it wasn't politics...","It was my niece. I picked her up, kissed her several times. The little one, frightened, pushed me off on my shoulder with her little hand, writhing to get down … At that moment a hat appeared in the door followed by a man, Cotrim, no less. I was so moved that I put the daughter down and threw myself into the arms of the father. That effusion may have disconcerted him a little because he seemed awkward to me. A simple prologue. Shortly after we were talking like two good old friends. No allusions to the past, lots of plans for the future, the promise to dine at each other’s house. I didn’t fail to mention that the exchange of dinners might have to have a slight interruption because I was thinking of traveling north. Sabina looked at Cotrim, Cotrim at Sabina. Both agreed that the idea made no sense. What the devil could I expect to find up north? Because wasn’t it in the capital, right there in the capital, that I should continue to shine, showing up the young fellows of the time? Because, really, there wasn’t a single one of them who could compare to me. He, Cotrim, had been following me from a distance and, in spite of a ridiculous quarrel, had always had an interest, pride, and vanity in my triumphs. He heard what was being said about me on the street and in salons. It was a concert of praise and admiration. And leave all that to go spend a few months in the provinces without any need to, without any serious reason? Unless it was political.","It was my niece. I snatched her up and kissed her again and again; the girl, startled, pushed at my shoulder with a little hand and squirmed to get down . . . Just then, a hat emerged in the doorway, and then a man, Cotrim, none other than Cotrim. I was so moved that I set the daughter down and threw myself into the arms of the father. This effusiveness may have disconcerted him somewhat; he certainly seemed reserved. A mere prologue. Soon we were speaking like old friends. No allusions to the past, many plans for the future, a promise to dine at each other’s houses. I made sure to say that these alternating suppers might undergo a brief interruption, as I had a notion to travel to the North. Sabina looked at Cotrim, and Cotrim at Sabina; they agreed that my notion made no sense. What on earth was there for me in the North? Wasn’t it at the Court, at the heart of the Court, that I was meant to shine and outdo all the young fellows? There was truly none other to rival me; he, Cotrim, had been observing me from a distance, and despite our ridiculous quarrel, he had always taken an interest, pride, and satisfaction in my triumphs. He had heard what was being said about me, on the streets and in the salons; it was a concert of praise and admiration. And leave all that to spend a few months in the provinces when there was no need, no serious reason? Unless it were political . . ."

"E esta palavra não vinha à toa; Virgília era um pouco religiosa. Não ouvia missa aos domingos, é verdade, e creio até que só ia às igrejas em dia de festa, e quando havia lugar vago em alguma tribuna. Mas rezava todas as noites, com fervor, ou, pelo menos, com sono. Tinha medo às trovoadas; nessas ocasiões, tapava os ouvidos, e resmoneava todas as orações do catecismo. Na alcova dela havia um oratoriozinho de jacarandá, obra de talha, de três palmos de altura, com três imagens dentro; mas não falava dele às amigas; ao contrário, tachava de beatas as que eram só religiosas. Algum tempo desconfiei que havia nela certo vexame de crer, e que a sua religião era uma espécie de camisa de flanela, preservativa e clandestina; mas evidentemente era engano meu.","And this word did not come for nothing; Virgilia was a little religious. I didn't hear Mass on Sundays, it's true, and I think I only went to church on feast days, and when there was a vacant seat on a platform. But he prayed every night, fervently, or at least sleepily. He was afraid of thunderstorms; on these occasions he would cover his ears, and mutter all the prayers in the catechism. In her alcove there was a little jacaranda oratory, a work of carving, three palms high, with three images inside; but she didn't tell her friends about him; on the contrary, he labeled those who were only religious as religious. For some time I suspected that there was a certain shame in her for believing, and that her religion was a sort of flannel shirt, conservative and clandestine; but evidently it was my mistake.","And that wasn’t just random words. Virgília was somewhat religious. She didn’t go to mass on Sundays , it’s true, and I even think she only went to church on feast days and when there was a vacant pulpit somewhere. But she prayed every night, fervently, or sleepily at least. She was afraid of thunder. On those occasions she’d cover her ears and mumble all the prayers in the catechism. In her bedroom she had a small carved jacaranda prie-dieu, three feet high and with images inside. But she never mentioned it to her friends. On the contrary, she would tag as fanatics those who were simply religious. For some time I suspected that there was a certain annoyance with belief in her and that her religion was a kind of flannel undergarment, hidden and cozy, but I was obviously mistaken.","She didn’t say so lightly; Virgília was somewhat religious. She didn’t attend Mass on Sundays, it’s true, and I believe that she went to church only on festival days, or when there was a spare seat in a reserved pew. But she prayed every night, fervently, or at least drowsily. Thunderclaps frightened her; when she heard them, she would cover her ears and mumble all the prayers in the catechism. In her bedroom there was a little altar in carved jacaranda wood, three spans high, with three statues on it; but she never spoke of it to her friends. On the contrary, she called the religious ones sanctimonious. For some time I suspected that she was somewhat ashamed at believing, that her religion was a sort of flannel undershirt, a furtive safeguard; but evidently I was mistaken."

"No intervalo fui visitá-los. Damasceno recebeu-me com muitas palavras, a mulher, com muitos sorrisos. Quanto a Nhã-loló, não tirou mais os olhos de mim. Parecia-me agora mais bonita que no dia do jantar. Achei-lhe certa suavidade etérea casada ao polido das formas terrenas: — expressão vaga, e condigna de um capítulo em que tudo há de ser vago. Realmente, não sei como lhes diga que não me senti mal, ao pé da moça, trajando garridamente um vestido fino, um vestido que me dava cócegas de Tartufo.ii Ao contemplá-lo, cobrindo casta e redondamente o joelho, foi que eu fiz uma descoberta subtil, a saber, que a natureza previu a vestidura humana, condição necessária ao desenvolvimento da nossa espécie. A nudez habitual, dada a multiplicação das obras e dos cuidados do indivíduo, tenderia a embotar os sentidos e a retardar os sexos, ao passo que o vestuário, negaceando a natureza, aguça e atrai as vontades, ativa-as, reprodu-las, e conseguintemente faz andar a civilização. Abençoado uso, que nos deu Oteloiii e os paquetes transatlânticos!","During the break I went to visit them. Damasceno received me with many words, the woman with many smiles. As for Nhã-loló, he never took his eyes off me. She looked prettier to me now than she had the day of dinner. I found him to have a certain ethereal softness married to the polish of earthly forms: — a vague expression, befitting a chapter in which everything must be vague. Really, I don't know how to tell you that I didn't feel bad, standing next to the girl, wearing a fine dress, a dress that made me tickle like Tartuffe.ii As I looked at him, covering my knee chastely and roundly, that's what I did. a subtle discovery, namely, that nature foresaw human clothing, a necessary condition for the development of our species. Habitual nudity, given the multiplication of the works and cares of the individual, would tend to dull the senses and retard the sexes, while clothing, denying nature, sharpens and attracts the wills, activates them, reproduces them, and consequently makes civilization walk. Blessed use, which gave us Oteloiii and the transatlantic liners!","I went to visit them during intermission. Damascene greeted me with lots of words, his wife with lots of smiles. As for Nhã-loló, she didn’t take her eyes off me. She seemed prettier to me than at the time of the dinner. I found in her a certain ethereal softness wedded to the polish of earthly forms—a vague expression and worthy of a chapter in which everything must be vague. Really, I don’t know how to tell you, I didn’t feel too bad beside the girl who was done up smartly in a fine dress, a dress that gave me the itching of a Tartuffe. As I contemplated how it chastely and completely covered her knee, I made a subtle discovery, to wit, that nature foresaw human clothing, a condition necessary for the development of our species. Habitual nudity, given the multiplicity of the works and cares of the individual, would tend to dull the senses and retard sex, while clothing, deceiving nature, sharpens and attracts desires, activates them, reproduces them, and, consequently, drives civilization. A blessed custom that gave us Othello and transatlantic packets.","At intermission, I went to visit them. Damasceno greeted me with many words, his wife with many smiles. As for Nhã-loló, she never took her eyes off me. She now seemed prettier than on the day of the supper. I saw in her a certain ethereal softness wedded to the refinement of earthly forms: that is a vague turn of phrase, worthy of a chapter in which all must be vague. Truly, I know not how to express to you that I felt quite fine next to that young lady, who was smartly dressed in an exquisite gown, a gown that gave me Tartuffian ticklings. As I contemplated the gown, which was chastely and wholly covering its wearer’s knees, I made a subtle discovery: to wit, that nature foresaw human vesture as a necessary condition for the development of our species. Habitual nudity, in light of the multiplication of individuals’ works and cares, would tend to dull the senses and hold back the sexes, while clothing, by provoking nature, whets and entices desires, activates them, reproduces them, and thus moves civilization forward. Blessed be the habit that has given us Othello and transatlantic steamers!"

"Fiquei só; mas a musa do capitão varrera-me do espírito os pensamentos maus; preferi dormir, que é um modo interino de morrer. No dia seguinte, acordamos debaixo de um temporal, que meteu medo a toda a gente, menos ao doudo; esse entrou a dar pulos, a dizer que a filha o mandava buscar, numa berlinda; a morte de uma filha fora a causa da loucura. Não, nunca me há de esquecer a figura hedionda do pobre homem, no meio do tumulto das gentes e dos uivos do furacão, a cantarolar e a bailar, com os olhos a saltarem-lhe da cara, pálido, cabelo arrepiado e longo. Às vezes parava, erguia ao ar as mãos ossudas, fazia umas cruzes com os dedos, depois um xadrez, depois umas argolas, e ria muito, desesperadamente. A mulher não podia já cuidar dele; entregue ao terror da morte, rezava por si mesma a todos os santos do céu. Enfim, a tempestade amainou. Confesso que foi uma diversão excelente à tempestade do meu coração. Eu, que meditava ir ter com a morte, não ousei fitá-la quando ela veio ter comigo.","I was alone; but the captain's muse had banished evil thoughts from my mind; I preferred to sleep, which is an interim way of dying. The next day, we woke up under a storm, which scared everyone, except the crazy one; he started jumping up and down, saying that his daughter was sending for him, in a hot seat; the death of a daughter had been the cause of the madness. No, I will never forget the hideous figure of the poor man, amid the turmoil of the people and the howls of the hurricane, humming and dancing, with his eyes bulging out of his face, pale, his hair standing on end and long. Sometimes he would stop, raise his bony hands in the air, make crosses with his fingers, then a checkerboard, then some rings, and laugh a lot, desperately. The woman could no longer care for him; surrendered to the terror of death, she prayed for herself to all the saints in heaven. Finally, the storm subsided. I confess it was excellent diversion to the storm of my heart. I, who was thinking about going to death, didn't dare look at her when she came to me.","I was left alone, but the captain’s muse had swept away all evil thoughts from my spirit.

His wife could no longer take care of him; given over to the terror of death, she was praying to all the saints in heaven for herself. Finally the storm abated.

I, who’d thought about going to meet death, didn’t dare look it in the eye when it came to meet me.","I was left alone; but the captain’s muse had swept the evil thoughts from my spirit; I preferred to sleep, which is a provisional form of dying.

E mais este outro acréscimo, que o ministro não acreditou nos motivos particulares; atribuiu a recusa do Lobo Neves a manejos políticos, ilusão complicada de algumas aparências; tratou-o mal, comunicou a desconfiança aos colegas; sobrevieram incidentes; enfim, com o tempo, o presidente resignatário foi para a oposição.","Or a wart or something else, what was that worth, for someone who doesn't lose a provincial presidency?

And what was more, the minister was unconvinced by his personal motives and attributed Lobo Neves’s refusal to political maneuverings, a perception aggravated by appearances; the minister treated him poorly, made his distrust known to colleagues; incidents came to pass; eventually, after some time, the resigning president went over to the opposition."

"Nisto entrou o moleque trazendo o relógio com o vidro novo. Era tempo; já me custava estar ali; dei uma moedinha de prata ao moleque; disse a Marcela que voltaria noutra ocasião, e saí a passo largo. Para dizer tudo, devo confessar que o coração me batia um pouco; mas era uma espécie de dobre de finados. O espírito ia travado de impressões opostas. Notem que aquele dia amanhecera alegre para mim. Meu pai, ao almoço, repetiu-me, por antecipação, o primeiro discurso que eu tinha de proferir na Câmara dos Deputados; rimo-nos muito, e o sol também, que estava brilhante, como nos mais belos dias do mundo; do mesmo modo que Virgília devia rir, quando eu lhe contasse as nossas fantasias do almoço. Vai senão quando, cai-me o vidro do relógio; entro na primeira loja que me fica à mão; e eis me surge o passado, ei-lo que me lacera e beija; ei-lo que me interroga, com um rosto cortado de saudades e bexigas…","Into this came the boy bringing the watch with the new glass.

To say it all, I must confess that my heart was beating a little; but it was a kind of death knell. The spirit was clogged with opposing impressions. Note that that day had dawned happy for me. My father, at lunch, repeated to me, in anticipation, the first speech I had to deliver in the Chamber of Deputies; we laughed a lot, and so did the sun, which was shining, as on the most beautiful days in the world; in the same way that Virgilia must have laughed when I told her about our lunch fantasies. Go if not when, the glass of the watch falls; I enter the first store that comes to hand; and behold the past appears to me, behold it lacerates and kisses me; here he is questioning me, with a face full of longing and pockmarks…","At that point the black boy came in carrying the watch with a new crystal. It was about time. It was already beginning to bother me being there. I gave the boy a small silver coin, told Marcela that I’d come back on another occasion, and went out with long strides. To tell the truth, I must confess that my heart was pounding a little. But it was a kind of death knell. My spirit was bound by opposing impressions. Remember that the day had dawned happily for me. My father had repeated in advance for me at breakfast the first speech I would make in the Chamber of Deputies. We were laughing a lot and the sun was, too, brilliant as on the most beautiful days in the world, the same way that Virgília should laugh when I told her about our breakfast fantasies. All is going well when I lose the crystal to my watch, go into the first shop at hand, and, behold, the past rises up before me, lacerates and kisses me, interrogates me with a face scarred by nostalgia and smallpox …","At this the slave boy came in bearing the watch, now with a new glass. It was high time, for being there was an ordeal; I gave the boy a silver coin, told Marcela that I would come back another day, and strode out.

Note that the day had begun joyfully for me. Over breakfast my father had recited the first speech that I was to give in the Chamber of Deputies; we laughed heartily, and the sun laughed with us, shining just as on the most beautiful days the world has ever seen—and Virgília would laugh brightly, too, when I told her of our breakfast-table fantasies.

"O que é novo neste livro é a geologia moral do Lobo Neves, e provavelmente a do cavalheiro que me está lendo. Sim, essas camadas de caráter, que a vida altera, conserva ou dissolve, conforme a resistência delas, essas camadas mereceriam um capítulo, que eu não escrevo, por não alongar a narração. Digo apenas que o homem mais probo que conheci em minha vida foi um certo Jacó Medeiros ou Jacó Valadares, não me recorda bem o nome. Talvez fosse Jacó Rodrigues; em suma, Jacó. Era a probidade em pessoa; podia ser rico, violentando um pequenino escrúpulo, e não quis; deixou ir pelas mãos fora nada menos de uns quatrocentos contos; tinha a probidade tão exemplar, que chegava a ser miúda e cansativa. Um dia, como nos achássemos, a sós, em casa dele, em boa palestra, vieram dizer que o procurava o Dr. B., um sujeito enfadonho. Jacó mandou dizer que não estava em casa.","What is new in this book is Lobo Neves' moral geology, and probably that of the gentleman reading me.

I'm just saying that the most honest man I ever met in my life was a certain Jacó Medeiros or Jacó Valadares, I don't remember the name very well. Perhaps it was Jacó Rodrigues; in short, Jacob. He was probity personified; he could be rich, violating a little scruple, and he didn't want to; he let go of nothing less than four hundred contos; her probity was so exemplary that it was small and tiresome. One day, as we were alone, at his house, having a good talk, they came to say that Dr. B., a boring fellow. Jacob sent word that he was not at home.","What’s new to this book is Lobo Neves’ moral, geology, and probably that of the gentleman reading me.

And he said this with such conviction that I, having already been informed of our ancestor the cooper, forgot my fickle lady for a moment and simply contemplated this phenomenon, which, while not rare, was nonetheless curious: a figment of imagination promoted to the rank of fact."

"O epitáfio diz tudo. Vale mais do que se lhes narrasse a moléstia de Nhã-loló, a morte, o desespero da família, o enterro.

"Unamos agora os pés e demos um salto por cima da escola, a enfadonha escola, onde aprendi a ler, escrever, contar, dar cacholetas, apanhá-las, e ir fazer diabruras, ora nos morros, ora nas praias, onde quer que fosse propício a ociosos.","Now let's put our feet together and take a leap over the school, the boring school, where I learned to read, write, count, give chuckles, catch them, and go do mischief, sometimes on the hills, sometimes on the beaches, wherever I went. conducive to idlers.","Let’s put our feet together now and leap over school, the irksome school where I learned to read, write, count, whack noggins, get mine whacked, and make mischief, sometimes up on the hills, sometimes on the beaches, wherever it was convenient for loafers. They were bitter times.","Let us put our feet together and take a flying leap over the school, that tedious school, where I learned to read, write, count, deliver punches and take them, and to make mischief in the hills or on the beaches, wherever proved more inviting to the idle.

"Eram, e naquela manhã parece que o diabo do homem adivinhara a nossa catástrofe. Jamais o engenho e a arte lhe foram tão propícios. Que requinte de temperos! Que tenrura de carnes! Que rebuscado de formas! Comia-se com a boca, com os olhos, com o nariz. Não guardei a conta desse dia; sei que foi cara. Ai dor! Era-me preciso enterrar magnificamente os meus amores. Eles lá iam, mar em fora, no espaço e no tempo, e eu ficava-me ali numa ponta de mesa, com os meus quarenta e tantos anos, tão vadios e tão vazios; ficava-me para os não ver nunca mais, porque ela poderia tornar e tornou, mas o eflúvio da manhã, quem é que o pediu ao crepúsculo da tarde?","They were, and that morning it seems that the devil of man had divined our catastrophe. Never was ingenuity and art so favorable to him. What a refinement of spices! What tenderness of meat! What fancy shapes! You ate with your mouth, with your eyes, with your nose. I did not keep the account of that day; I know it was expensive. Oh pain! It was necessary for me to bury my loves magnificently. They would go there, sea in out, in space and time, and I would stay there at one end of the table, in my late forties, so idle and so empty; I stayed to never see them again, because she could return and did, but the effluvium of the morning, who asked for it in the twilight of the afternoon?","They were, and on that morning it was as if the devil of a fellow had sensed our catastrophe. Never had ingenuity and art been so favorable to him. What a delight of spices! What a delicacy of meats! What refinement in the shapes! You ate with your mouth, with your eyes, and with your nose. I can’t remember the bill on that day. I know that it was expensive. Oh, the sorrow of it! I had to give magnificent burial to my love affair. It was going off there, out to sea, off into space and time, and I was staying behind at a corner table with my forty-some-odd years, so lazy and so hazy.","Indeed they were, and on that morning it seemed that devil of a chef had guessed at our misfortune. Never had ingenuity and artifice smiled on him as they did then. What refined spices! What tender meats! What elegant forms! One ate with one’s mouth, eyes, and nose.

There it went, away across the sea, in space and time, and I remained there at the end of the table, with my forty-odd years, so idle and so empty; I remained, never to see my love again, for even if she could return, as return she did, who would ever ask for the fragrance of morning when faced with the twilight of afternoon?"

"E esta reflexão — uma das mais profundas que se tem feito, desde a invenção das borboletas — me consolou do malefício, e me reconciliou comigo mesmo. Deixei-me estar a contemplar o cadáver, com alguma simpatia, confesso. Imaginei que ela saíra do mato, almoçada e feliz. A manhã era linda. Veio por ali fora, modesta e negra, espairecendo as suas borboletices, sob a vasta cúpula de um céu azul, que é sempre azul, para todas as asas. Passa pela minha janela, entra e dá comigo. Suponho que nunca teria visto um homem; não sabia, portanto, o que era o homem; descreveu infinitas voltas em torno do meu corpo, e viu que me movia, que tinha olhos, braços, pernas, um ar divino, uma estatura colossal. Então disse consigo: “Este é provavelmente o inventor das borboletas”. A ideia subjugou-a, aterrou-a; mas o medo, que é também sugestivo, insinuou-lhe que o melhor modo de agradar ao seu criador era beijá-lo na testa, e beijou-me na testa. Quando enxotada por mim, foi pousar na vidraça, viu dali o retrato de meu pai, e não é impossível que descobrisse meia verdade, a saber, que estava ali o pai do inventor das borboletas, e voou a pedir-lhe misericórdia.","And this reflection — one of the most profound that has been done since the invention of butterflies — consoled me for the evil, and reconciled me to myself. I let myself be contemplating the corpse, with some sympathy, I confess. I imagined that she had come out of the woods, having lunch and happy. The morning was beautiful. She came that way, modest and black, venting her butterflies, under the vast dome of a blue sky, which is always blue, for all wings. Go through my window, come in and find me. I suppose I would never have seen a man; he did not, therefore, know what man was; described infinite turns around my body, and saw that I moved, that I had eyes, arms, legs, a divine air, a colossal stature. Then he said to himself: “This is probably the inventor of butterflies”. The idea overwhelmed her, terrified her; but fear, which is also suggestive, suggested to him that the best way to please his maker was to kiss him on the forehead, and he kissed me on the forehead. When shooed away by me, it came to rest on the windowpane, saw from there the portrait of my father, and it is not impossible that it discovered half the truth, namely, that the father of the inventor of butterflies was there, and flew to ask for mercy.","And that reflection—one of the most profound that has been made since butterflies were invented—consoled me for the evil deed and reconciled me with myself. I let myself contemplate the corpse with a certain sympathy, I must confess. I imagined that it had come out of the woods, having had breakfast, and that it was happy. The morning was beautiful. It came out of there, modest and black, having fun butterflying under the broad cupola of a blue sky, which is always blue for all wings. It came through my window and found me. I suppose it had never seen a man before. It didn’t know, therefore, what a man was. It executed infinite turns around my body and saw that I moved, that I had eyes, arms, legs, a divine look, colossal stature. Then it said to itself: “This is probably the inventor of butterflies.” The idea subjugated it, terrified it, but fear, which is also suggestive, hinted to it that the best way to please its creator was to kiss him on the forehead, and it kissed me on the forehead. When I drove it away, it went to land on the counterpane. There it saw my father’s picture and it’s quite possible that it discovered a half-truth there, to wit, that this was the father of the inventor of butterflies, and it flew over to beg his mercy.","And this reflection—one of the most profound to be produced since the invention of butterflies—consoled me for my misdeed, and I made peace with myself. I let myself contemplate the cadaver with some affection, I confess. I imagined that it had left the forest, content and having breakfasted. The morning was lovely. It had wandered out, modest and black, reveling in its butterflydom, below the vast dome of a blue sky—the sky which is always blue, no matter the color of one’s wings. It went in through my window and happened upon me. I presume it had never seen a man; therefore, it could not know what a man was; it traced countless circles around my body and saw that I moved, that I had eyes, arms, legs, a divine air, colossal stature. Then it said to itself: “This is probably the inventor of butterflies.” The idea overpowered it, cowed it; but fear, which may also be persuasive, insinuated to the butterfly that the best way to thank its maker would be to kiss him on the forehead, and so it kissed me on the forehead. When I brushed it away, it landed on the windowpane, and from there it spotted the portrait of my father. It may well have hit upon a half-truth—that this was the father of the inventor of butterflies—and, accordingly, it flew over to beg his mercy.2"
"Defendi-me do melhor modo; falei do cavalo que empacara, e de um amigo, que me detivera. De repente morre-me a voz nos lábios, fico tolhido de assombro. Virgília… seria Virgília aquela moça? Fitei-a muito, e a sensação foi tão penosa, que recuei um passo e desviei a vista. Tornei a olhá-la. As bexigas tinham-lhe comido o rosto; a pele, ainda na véspera tão fina, rosada e pura, aparecia-me agora amarela, estigmada pelo mesmo flagelo que devastara o rosto da espanhola. Os olhos, que eram travessos, fizeram-se murchos; tinha o lábio triste e a atitude cansada. Olhei-a bem; peguei-lhe na mão, e chamei-a brandamente a mim. Não me enganava; eram as bexigas. Creio que fiz um gesto de repulsa.","I defended myself as best I could; I spoke of the horse that had stalled, and of a friend who had stopped me. Suddenly the voice on my lips dies, I am stunned. Virgília… was Virgília that girl? I stared at her a lot, and the sensation was so painful that I took a step back and looked away. I looked at her again. The smallpox had eaten into his face; her skin, still so fine, pink and pure the day before, now appeared yellow, stigmatized by the same scourge that had devastated the Spanish woman's face. The eyes, which were mischievous, became withered; he had a sad lip and a tired attitude. I looked at her well; I took her hand, and softly called her to me. I was not deceived; were the bladders. I think I made a gesture of disgust.","I defended myself as best I could. I mentioned a balky horse, a friend who’d held me up. All of a sudden my voice died on my lips, I was paralyzed with wonder.

The smallpox had eaten at her face. Her skin, so delicate and pink and pure before, just a day ago, looked yellow to me now, stigmatized by the same lash that had devastated the Spanish woman’s face. Her eyes, which used to be lively, were dull, her lips were sad and she had a weary air about her. I took a good look, took her hand and softly drew her toward me. I hadn’t been deceived, they were pockmarks. I think I took on an expression of revulsion.","I defended myself as best I could; I spoke of a balky horse and a friend who’d kept me. Suddenly my voice died on my lips as I was paralyzed by astonishment. Virgília . . . was this young lady Virgília?

Pockmarks had eaten away at her face; her skin, only recently so fine, rosy, and pure, now looked yellowed, afflicted with the same malady that had devastated the Spanish lady’s face. Her eyes, once mischievous, had gone dull; her mouth was dejected, her air weary. I looked at her closely; I took her by the hand and drew her gently to me. I wasn’t mistaken; there were the pockmarks. I think I showed some sign of disgust."

"Ocorreu-me logo o episódio de 1814, e senti-me vexado; mas adverti que os acontecimentos tinham-me dado razão. Na verdade, fora impossível evitar as relações íntimas do Vilaça com a irmã do sargento-mor; antes mesmo do meu embarque, já se boquejava misteriosamente no nascimento de uma menina. Meu tio João mandou-me dizer depois que o Vilaça, ao morrer, deixara um bom legado a D. Eusébia, cousa que deu muito que falar em todo o bairro. O próprio tio João, guloso de escândalos, não tratou de outro assunto na carta, aliás de muitas folhas. Tinham-me dado razão os acontecimentos. Ainda porém que ma não dessem, 1814 lá ia longe, e, com ele, a travessura, e o Vilaça, e o beijo da moita; finalmente, nenhumas relações estreitas existiam entre mim e ela.

My uncle João sent me to tell me afterwards that Vilaça, when he died, had left a good legacy to Dona Eusébia, something that caused a lot of talk in the whole neighborhood. Uncle Joao himself, greedy for scandals, did not deal with any other subject in the letter, which had many pages. The events had given me reason. Even though they didn't give it to me, 1814 went far, and with it, the prank, and Vilaça, and the kiss from the bush; finally, no close relations existed between her and me. I made this reflection with myself and I just closed the trunk.","The episode from 1814 came to me immediately and I felt annoyed. But I called my attention to the fact that: events proved me right.

My uncle João sent word later that when Vilaça died, he left a sizable bequest to Dona Eusébia, which set the entire neighborhood talking. Uncle João, a glutton for scandals, spoke of nothing else in the letter, which was many pages long at that. Events had proved me right.

"Outra cousa que também me parece metafísica é isto: dá-se movimento a uma bola, por exemplo; rola esta, encontra outra bola, transmite-lhe o impulso, e eis a segunda bola a rolar como a primeira rolou. Suponhamos que a primeira bola se chama… Marcela — é uma simples suposição —; a segunda, Brás Cubas; a terceira, Virgília. Temos que Marcela, recebendo um piparote do passado, rolou até tocar em Brás Cubas, o qual, cedendo à força impulsiva, entrou a rolar também até esbarrar em Virgília, que não tinha nada com a primeira bola; e eis aí como, pela simples transmissão de uma força, se tocam os extremos sociais, e se estabelece uma cousa que poderemos chamar — solidariedade do aborrecimento humano. Como é que este capítulo escapou a Aristóteles?","Another thing that also seems metaphysical to me is this: a ball is given movement, for example; this one rolls, finds another ball, gives it momentum, and here's the second ball rolling as the first rolled. Let us suppose that the first ball is called… Marcela — it is a simple supposition —; the second, Brás Cubas; the third, Virgilia. We have that Marcela, receiving a flick from the past, rolled until she touched Brás Cubas, who, yielding to impulsive force, started to roll as well until bumping into Virgília, who had nothing to do with the first ball; and this is how, by the simple transmission of a force, the social extremes are touched, and something that we can call — the solidarity of human annoyance is established. How did this chapter escape Aristotle?","Another thing that seems metaphysical to me is this: put a ball into motion, for example. It rolls, touches another ball, transmits the impulse, and there you have the second ball rolling like the first. Let us suppose that the first ball is called … Marcela—and it’s only a supposition. The second Brás Cubas—the third Virgília. Put the case that Marcela, receiving a flick from the past, rolls until she touches Brás Cubas—who, reacting to the impelling force, begins to roll, too, until he runs up against Virgília, who had nothing to do with the first ball. And there you have now, by the simple transmission of a force, two social extremes come into contact and something is established that we can call… the solidarity of human aversion. How is it that Aristotle left that chapter out?","Another thing that also strikes me as metaphysical is this: a ball is put in motion, for example; it rolls, comes up against another ball, transmits the driving force, and here we have the second ball rolling just as the first did. Let us suppose that the first ball is called . . . Marcela—a mere supposition—while the second ball is called Brás Cubas, and the third, Virgília. Thus we have it that Marcela, receiving a flick from the past, rolled until it touched Brás Cubas, which, ceding to that propulsive force, set off rolling until it ran into Virgília, which had nothing to do with the first ball; this is how, through the simple transmission of force, social extremes may touch one another, creating what we may call the solidarity of human disgruntlement. How on earth did this chapter escape Aristotle?"

"Vejo-a assomar à porta da alcova, pálida, comovida, trajada de preto, e ali ficar durante um minuto, sem ânimo de entrar, ou detida pela presença de um homem que estava comigo. Da cama, onde jazia, contemplei-a durante esse tempo, esquecido de lhe dizer nada ou de fazer nenhum gesto. Havia já dous anos que nos não víamos, e eu via-a agora não qual era, mas qual fora, quais fôramos ambos, porque um Ezequias misterioso fizera recuar o sol** até os dias juvenis. Recuou o sol, sacudi todas as misérias, e este punhado de pó, que a morte ia espalhar na eternidade do nada, pôde mais do que o tempo, que é o ministro da morte.

It had been two years since we had seen each other, and now I saw her not who she was, but who she was, who we both were, because a mysterious Hezekiah had turned the sun back to youthful days.

No water from Juventa could equal simple nostalgia there.","I see her appear in the door of my bedroom—pale, upset, dressed in black—and remain there for a minute without the courage to come in, or held back by the presence of the man who was with me.

"Número fatídico, lembras-te que te abençoei muitas vezes? Assim também as virgens ruivas de Tebas deviam abençoar a égua, de ruiva crina, que as substituiu no sacrifício de Pelópidas —* uma donosa égua, que lá morreu, coberta de flores, sem que ninguém lhe desse nunca uma palavra de saudade. Pois dou-ta eu, égua piedosa, não só pela morte havida, como porque, entre as donzelas escapas, não é impossível que figurasse uma avó dos Cubas… Número fatídico, tu foste a nossa salvação. Não me confessou o marido a causa da recusa; disse-me também que eram negócios particulares, e o rosto sério, convencido, com que eu o escutei fez honra à dissimulação humana. Ele é que mal podia encobrir a tristeza profunda que o minava; falava pouco, absorvia-se, metia-se em casa, a ler. Outras vezes recebia, e então conversava e ria muito, com estrépito e afetação. Oprimiam-no duas cousas — a ambição, que um escrúpulo desazara, e logo depois a dúvida —, e talvez o arrependimento, mas um arrependimento que viria outra vez, se se repetisse a hipótese, porque o fundo supersticioso existia. Duvidava da superstição, sem chegar a rejeitá-la. Essa persistência de um sentimento que repugna ao mesmo indivíduo era um fenômeno digno de alguma atenção. Mas eu preferia a pura ingenuidade de D. Plácida, quando confessava não poder ver um sapato voltado para o ar.","Fateful number, do you remember that I blessed you many times? In the same way the red-haired virgins of Thebes had to bless the mare, with the red mane, who replaced them in the sacrifice of Pelopidas—* a masterful mare, who died there, covered with flowers, without anyone ever giving her a word of longing. Well, I give it to you, pious mare, not only because of the death that happened, but also because, among the escaped maidens, it's not impossible that a grandmother of the Cubas would figure... A fateful number, you were our salvation. The husband did not confess to me the reason for the refusal; he also told me that it was private business, and the serious, convinced face with which I listened to him did honor to human dissimulation. He was the one who could barely cover the deep sadness that swamped him; He spoke little, absorbed himself, stayed at home, reading. Other times he received, and then he talked and laughed a lot, with noise and affectation. Two things oppressed him — ambition, which a scruple had unleashed, and then doubt — and perhaps regret, but a regret that would come again, if the hypothesis were repeated, because the superstitious background existed. He doubted superstition without actually rejecting it. This persistence of a feeling repugnant to the same individual was a phenomenon worthy of some attention. But I preferred the sheer naivety of Dona Placida, when she confessed that she couldn't see a shoe turned up in the air.","Fateful number, can you remember how many times I blessed you? That, too, must have been the way the red-haired virgins of Thebes blessed the mare with a russet mane that took their place in Pelopidas’ sacrifice—a charming mare who died there covered with flowers without anyone’s ever having given her a word of fond remembrance. Well, I give you one, pitiful mare, not only because of the death you suffered but because among the spared maidens it’s not impossible that a grandmother of the Cubases figured … Fateful number, you were our salvation.

He told me, too, that it was because of personal business and the serious, convinced face with which I listened to him did honor to human hypocrisy. He was the only one who had trouble covering up the sadness eating at him. He spoke little, was self-absorbed, stayed home reading. On other occasions he would receive and then he would converse and laugh a lot, with noise and affection. Two things were oppressing him—ambition, which had had its wings clipped by a scruple and immediately following doubt and perhaps regret, but a regret that would return if the hypothesis were repeated, because the superstitious basis still existed. He had his doubts about the superstition without arriving at its rejection. That persistence of a feeling that was repugnant to the individual himself was a phenomenon worthy of some attention. But I preferred that she couldn’t bear seeing a toad turned on its back.","Fateful number, do you recall how many times I blessed you?

Fateful number, you were our salvation. Her husband never confessed to me why he had refused the nomination; he also told me that he had private matters to attend to, and the serious, persuaded look with which I listened to him was a tribute to humanity’s capacity for dissembling. He, on the other hand, could barely disguise the profound sorrow eating away at him; he spoke very little, became withdrawn, and took to retiring to his home and reading. At other times he would receive guests, and then he conversed and laughed a great deal, loudly and affectedly. He was oppressed by two things—ambition, whose wings had been clipped by a worry, and then doubt, hard on its heels—and perhaps regret as well, but a regret that would come again if the scenario were to repeat itself, for the superstitious foundation remained. He doubted his superstition without coming to reject it. The persistence of a sentiment in an individual who finds it loathsome was a phenomenon worthy of some attention. But I preferred the pure naiveté of Dona Plácida when she confessed that she couldn’t bear to see an upturned shoe."

Deu-me uma cadeira, e, com o balcão permeio, falou-me longamente de si, da vida que levara, das lágrimas que eu lhe fizera verter, das saudades, dos desastres, enfim das bexigas, que lhe escalavraram o rosto, e do tempo, que ajudou a moléstia, adiantando-lhe a decadência. Verdade é que tinha a alma decrépita. Vendera tudo, quase tudo; um homem, que a amara outrora, e lhe morreu nos braços, deixara-lhe aquela loja de ourivesaria, mas, para que a desgraça fosse completa, era agora pouco buscada a loja — talvez pela singularidade de a dirigir uma mulher. Em seguida pediu-me que lhe contasse a minha vida. Gastei pouco tempo em dizer-lha; não era longa, nem interessante.","I didn't answer anything. Marcela understood the reason for my silence (it wasn't difficult), and she only hesitated, I think, in deciding which dominated more, if the astonishment of the present, or the memory of the past. He gave me a chair and, with the counter between us, spoke at length about himself, the life he had led, the tears I had made him shed, the homesickness, the disasters, finally the smallpox that had scarred his face, and of time, which helped the disease, advancing its decadence. The truth is that he had a decrepit soul. He had sold everything, almost everything; a man, who had once loved her, and died in her arms, had left her that jewelery shop, but, to make the disgrace complete, the shop was now little sought after—perhaps because of the singularity of running it by a woman. Then he asked me to tell him about my life. I spent little time telling him; it wasn't long or interesting.","I didn’t answer. Marcela understood the cause of my silence (it wasn’t difficult) and only hesitated, I think, in deciding which was stronger, the fright of the present or the memory of the past. She brought me a chair and with the counter between us spoke to me at length about herself, the life she’d led, the tears I’d caused her to shed, the longing, the disasters, finally the smallpox that had scarred her face, and time, which the illness had helped in bringing on her early decline. The truth is that she did have a decrepit soul. She’d sold everything, almost everything. A man who’d loved her in times past and died in her arms had left her that jewelry store but, to make misfortune complete, there weren’t many customers coming to the shop now—maybe because of the odd situation that it was run by a woman. She immediately asked me to tell her about my life. I didn’t spend much time telling it. It was neither long nor interesting.","I said nothing. Marcela understood the cause of my silence (it was not difficult), and only hesitated, I believe, in deciding which was foremost, the astonishment of the present or the memory of the past. She offered me a chair, and, with the counter between us, she told me at length of herself, the life she had lived, the tears I had made her shed, the longing, the misfortunes, and finally the pox, which had blighted her face, and time, which had helped the malady along in accelerating her decay. The truth is that her very soul was decrepit. She had sold everything, nearly everything; a man who had once loved her and died in her arms had left her the jeweler’s; but as if to crown her ill fortune, the shop was now little frequented—perhaps for the singular fact of its being run by a woman. Then she asked me to tell of my life. I spent very little time in doing so; the story was neither long nor interesting."

"Sim, senhor, amávamos. Agora, que todas as leis sociais no-lo impediam, agora é que nos amávamos deveras.

"Depois chamou a minha atenção para os cocheiros de casa-grande, mais empertigados que o amo, para os criados de hotel, cuja solicitude obedece às variações sociais da freguesia, etc. E concluiu que era tudo a expressão daquele sentimento delicado e nobre — prova cabal de que muitas vezes o homem, ainda a engraxar botas, é sublime.","Then he called my attention to the coachmen in the manor house, who were more erect than the master, to the hotel servants, whose solicitude obeyed the social variations of the parish, etc. And he concluded that it was all the expression of that delicate and noble feeling - proof that many times the man, still shining his boots, is sublime.","Then he called my attention to the coachmen in great houses, more haughty than their masters, to hotel servants, whose solicitude depends upon the social variations of the guest, etc. And he concluded that all of it was an expression of that delicate and noble sentiment—full proof that so many times man, even when shining shoes, is sublime.","Then he called my attention to the coachmen at grand houses, whose bearing is haughtier than their masters’; to hotel servants, whose degree of solicitude follows the social position of each guest, et cetera.

"Saí dali a saborear o beijo. Não pude dormir; estirei-me na cama, é certo, mas foi o mesmo que nada. Ouvi as horas todas da noite. Usualmente, quando eu perdia o sono, o bater da pêndula fazia-me muito mal; esse tic-tac soturno, vagaroso e seco parecia dizer a cada golpe que eu ia ter um instante menos de vida. Imaginava então um velho diabo, sentado entre dous sacos, o da vida e o da morte, a tirar as moedas da vida para dá-las à morte, e a contá-las assim: — Outra de menos…","I left there savoring the kiss. I couldn't sleep; I stretched out on the bed, it's true, but it was the same as nothing. I heard all hours of the night. Usually, when I lost sleep, the swing of the pendulum made me very sick; that dark, slow, dry tick seemed to say with every blow that I was going to have a moment less to live. I then imagined an old devil, sitting between two bags, the one for life and the other for death, taking the coins of life to give them to death, and counting them like this: — Another too few...","I left there savoring the kiss. I couldn’t sleep. I lay down on my bed, of course, but it meant nothing. I heard the hours of night. Usually when I couldn’t sleep, the chiming of the grandfather clock would upset me very much. The mournful tick-tock, slow and dry, seemed to say with every note that I was having one instant less of life. Then I would picture an old devil sitting between two sacks, that of life and that of death, taking out the coins of life and giving them to death, counting them like this: “Another less…”","I left, savoring the kiss. I couldn’t get to sleep that night; I did lie down in bed, but it was as good as nothing. I heard all the hours strike that night. Ordinarily, when I found myself unable to sleep, the sound of the pendulum clock tormented me; that somber, bone-dry, sluggish tick-tock seemed to say with each stroke that I now had one fewer moment of life. Then I would envision an old devil seated between two sacks, one of life and one of death, and taking the coins from life and passing them over to death, counting them out: “Another one gone . . .”"
"Ultimamente, restituído à forma humana, vi chegar um hipopótamo, que me arrebatou. Deixei-me ir, calado, não sei se por medo ou confiança; mas, dentro em pouco, a carreira de tal modo se tornou vertiginosa, que me atrevi a interrogá-lo, e com alguma arte lhe disse que a viagem me parecia sem destino.","Lately, restored to human form, I saw a hippopotamus arrive, which snatched me away. I let myself go, silent, I don't know if out of fear or trust; but in a little while his career became so vertiginous that I dared to question him, and with some art I told him that the journey seemed to me aimless.","Finally, restored to human form, I saw a hippopotamus come and carry me off. I let myself go, silent, I don’t know whether out of fear or trust, but after a short while the running became so dizzying that I dared question him and in some way told him that the trip didn’t seem to be going anywhere.","Finally, restored to human form, I saw a hippopotamus come up and carry me off.
