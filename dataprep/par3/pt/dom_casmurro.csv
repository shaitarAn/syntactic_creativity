"Em caminho, encontramos o imperador, que vinha da Escola de Medicina. O ônibus em que íamos parou, como todos os veículos; os passageiros desceram à rua e tiraram o chapéu, até que o coche imperial passasse. Quando tornei ao meu lugar, trazia uma ideia fantástica, a ideia de ir ter com o imperador, contar-lhe tudo e pedir-lhe a intervenção. Não confiaria esta ideia a Capitu. “Sua Majestade pedindo, mamãe cede”, pensei comigo.","On the way, we met the emperor, who was coming from the School of Medicine. The bus we were on stopped, like all vehicles; the passengers went down to the street and took off their hats, until the imperial coach passed.

I would not entrust this idea to Capitu. “Your Majesty asking, mother gives in”, I thought to myself.","On the way, we met the Emperor,* who was coming from the School of Medicine.

"Fui, cheguei aos Arcos, entrei na rua de Matacavalos. A casa não era logo ali, mas muito além da dos Inválidos, perto da do Senado. Três ou quatro vezes, quisera interrogar o meu companheiro, sem ousar abrir a boca; mas agora, já nem tinha tal desejo. Ia só andando, aceitando o pior, como um gesto do destino, como uma necessidade da obra humana, e foi então que a Esperança, para combater o Terror, me segredou ao coração, não estas palavras, pois nada articulou parecido com palavras, mas uma ideia que poderia ser traduzida por elas: “Mamãe defunta, acaba o seminário”.","I went, arrived at Arcos, entered Rua de Matacavalos. The house was not right there, but far beyond that of the Invalides, close to that of the Senate. Three or four times I had wanted to question my companion, without daring to open my mouth; but now, he no longer had such a desire. I just walked, accepting the worst, as a gesture of fate, as a necessity of human work, and it was then that Hope, to fight the Terror, whispered to my heart, not these words, for she articulated nothing like words, but an idea that could be translated by them: “Dead mother, the seminar is over”.","I went on, got to the arches of the Lapa aqueduct, and turned into the Rua de Matacavalos. The house was not there, but a long way past the Rua dos Inválidos, near the Rua do Senado. Three or four times, I had wanted to question my companion, without daring to open my mouth; but now, I didn’t even want to do that. I only walked on, accepting the worst, as a stroke of destiny, as a necessary part of the human condition, and it was then that Hope, to combat Terror, whispered into my ear—not these words, for nothing reached expression in words, but an idea which could be translated by them: “If Mamma’s dead, it’s the end of the seminary.”","I walked on, arrived at the Arcos and turned into Rua de Matacavalos.

"— É tarde, disse ele; mas, para lhe provar que não há falta de vontade, irei falar a sua mãe. Não prometo vencer, mas lutar; trabalharei com alma. Deveras, não quer ser padre? As leis são belas, meu querido… Pode ir a São Paulo, a Pernambuco, ou ainda mais longe. Há boas universidades por esse mundo fora. Vá para as leis, se tal é a sua vocação. Vou falar a dona Glória, mas não conte só comigo; fale também a seu tio.","— It is late, he said; but, to prove to you that there is no lack of will, I will speak to your mother.

I'm going to talk to Dona Glória, but don't just count on me; also speak to your uncle.","“It is late,” he said, “but to prove there’s no lack of willing on my part, I’ll go and speak to your mother.

Law is a wonderful thing, dear boy … You could go to São Paulo, Pernambuco, or even farther afield. There are good universities out there in the great world. Go into law, if you’ve the calling. I’ll speak to Dona Glória, but don’t just count on me ; speak to your Uncle too.”","But to prove to you that I’m not unwilling I’ll speak to your mother.

"Fui eu que cansei primeiro. Comecei a demorar as respostas, até que não dei mais nenhuma; ele ainda teimou duas ou três vezes depois do meu silêncio, mas não recebendo contestação alguma, por fadiga também ou por não aborrecer, acabou de todo com as suas apologias. A última, como a primeira, como todas, afirmava a mesma predição eterna:","I was the one who got tired first. I started to delay the answers, until I didn't give any more; he still persisted two or three times after my silence, but receiving no objection, either through fatigue or because he was not bored, he put an end to his apologies. The last, like the first, like all, affirmed the same eternal prediction:","It was I who tired of it first. I began to delay my replies, until I sent them no longer; he still persisted two or three times after I ceased, but when he received no replies, either out of exhaustion or so as not to be a nuisance, he stopped sending his arguments. The last one, like the first, like all the others, affirmed the same eternal prediction:","I tired of it first. I began to delay sending my answers until finally I sent none at all. Even then he persisted two or three times after I had fallen silent, but not receiving any answer he, too, stopped writing, either like me from weariness or so as not to pester me. His last letter, like the first, like all of them, maintained the same eternal affirmation: ‘The Russians will never enter Constantinople.’"

"A soma era enorme. A razão é que eu andava carregado de promessas não cumpridas. A última foi de duzentos padre-nossos e duzentas ave-marias, se não chovesse em certa tarde de passeio a Santa Teresa. Não choveu, mas eu não rezei as orações. Desde pequenino acostumara-me a pedir ao céu os seus favores, mediante orações que diria, se eles viessem. Disse as primeiras, as outras foram adiadas, e à medida que se amontoavam iam sendo esquecidas. Assim cheguei aos números vinte, trinta, cinquenta. Entrei nas centenas e agora no milhar. Era um modo de peitar a vontade divina pela quantia das orações; além disso, cada promessa nova era feita e jurada no sentido de pagar a dívida antiga. Mas vão lá matar a preguiça de uma alma que a trazia do berço e não a sentia atenuada pela vida! O céu fazia-me o favor, eu adiava a paga. Afinal perdi-me nas contas.","The sum was huge. The reason is that I was loaded with broken promises. The last one was two hundred Our Fathers and two hundred Hail Marys, if it didn't rain on a certain afternoon on a trip to Santa Teresa. It didn't rain, but I didn't say the prayers. Since I was little, I had been accustomed to asking heaven for its favors, by means of prayers I would say if they came. I said the first, the others were postponed, and as they piled up, they were forgotten. So I arrived at numbers twenty, thirty, fifty. I entered the hundreds and now the thousands. It was a way of challenging the divine will for the amount of prayers; moreover, each new promise was made and sworn to pay the old debt. But go there to kill the laziness of a soul that brought it from the cradle and didn't feel it was attenuated by life! Heaven did me a favor, I postponed payment. In the end, I lost count.","It was an enormous quantity. The reason was that I was loaded down with unfulfilled promises. The last one had been two hundred paternosters and two hundred ave marias, if it didn’t rain one afternoon on an outing to Santa Teresa. It didn’t rain, but I didn’t say the prayers. Ever since I was small I had become used to asking favors of heaven, promising prayers if they were granted. I said the first ones, the next were put off, and as they piled up they were gradually forgotten. In this way I got to twenty, thirty, fifty. I got into the hundreds, and now it was a thousand. It was a way of bribing the divine will by the number of prayers; furthermore, each new promise was made and sworn on the basis that the outstanding debt would be paid. But what can you do, when your soul has been marked by sloth from the cradle, and life has done nothing to change this? Heaven would do me the favor, and I would put off the payment. In the end, I got lost in the accounts.","It was an enormous number. The reason was that I was already encumbered with unfulfilled promises. The last had been two hundred paternosters and two hundred Ave Marias if it didn’t rain on the afternoon we planned an outing to Santa Teresa. It didn’t rain, but I didn’t say my prayers. Ever since I was a child I had begged favours of heaven, promising to say prayers if they were granted. The first ones were duly said, but later ones got postponed, and as they grew in number they came to be forgotten. In this way I arrived at twenty, thirty, fifty. I entered the hundreds, and now a thousand. It was a way of bribing the divine will by the sheer number of prayers; but more than that, each new promise was made and formally avowed with the intention of paying off old debts and, it was to be hoped, curing me of an indolence I had possessed from the cradle and which life as yet had not corrected. Heaven granted me the favour and I postponed the payment, until finally I lost count."

"Fiquei sério depressa. Era o momento da saída. Peguei da minha vara; e, como já conhecia a distância, e agora voltávamos para a igreja, o que fazia a distância menor, — o peso da vara era mui pequeno. Demais, o sol cá fora, a animação da rua, os rapazes da minha idade que me fitavam cheios de inveja, as devotas que chegavam às janelas ou entravam nos corredores e se ajoelhavam à nossa passagem, tudo me enchia a alma de lepidez nova.","I got serious quickly. It was time to leave. I took it from my rod; and, as we already knew the distance, and now we went back to the church, which made the distance shorter, — the weight of the rod was very small. Also, the sun outside, the liveliness of the street, the boys my age who looked at me with envy, the devotees who came to the windows or entered the corridors and knelt as we passed, everything filled my soul with new levity.","I quickly composed myself. Now it was the moment to leave. I took hold of my pole; and, as I already knew how far it was and we were now going back to the church , the distance seemed less—the pole hardly weighed at all. Moreover, the sun outside, the stir in the street, the boys of my age who gazed enviously at me, the women who came to the windows and alley ways and piously knelt down as we passed, all of this made me feel quite sprightly again.","I quickly composed myself. It was time to leave. I took hold of the shaft, and as I already knew the distance, and also because we were returning to the church (which made it seem even shorter), the weight of the shaft was insignificant. Moreover, the sun outside, the crush of people in the street, the lads of my own age who gazed at me enviously, the women who crowded the windows and the alleyways and knelt down as we passed – all this served to raise my spirits the higher."

"Tenho ali na parede o retrato dela, ao lado do marido, tais quais na outra casa. A pintura escureceu muito, mas ainda dá ideia de ambos. Não me lembra nada dele, a não ser vagamente que era alto e usava cabeleira grande; o retrato mostra uns olhos redondos, que me acompanham para todos os lados, efeito da pintura que me assombrava em pequeno. O pescoço sai de uma gravata preta de muitas voltas, a cara é toda rapada, salvo um trechozinho pegado às orelhas. O de minha mãe mostra que era linda. Contava então vinte anos, e tinha uma flor entre os dedos. No painel parece oferecer a flor ao marido. O que se lê na cara de ambos é que, se a felicidade conjugal pode ser comparada à sorte grande, eles a tiraram no bilhete comprado de sociedade.","I have her picture on the wall, next to her husband, just like in the other house. The painting has darkened a lot, but it still gives an idea of both. I don't remember anything about him, except vaguely that he was tall and had long hair; the portrait shows round eyes that follow me everywhere, an effect of the painting that haunted me as a child. The neck comes out of a black tie with many loops, the face is all shaved, except for a little bit stuck to the ears. My mother's shows that she was beautiful. He was then twenty years old, and he had a flower between his fingers. On the panel, she appears to be offering the flower to her husband. What you can read on their faces is that, if marital bliss can be compared to the jackpot, they got it on the society ticket they bought.","I have her portrait there on the wall, next to her husband’s, just as they were in the other house.

His neck emerges from a voluminous black necktie, and his face is clean shaven, except for a small patch just next to the ears. My mother’s picture shows she was lovely. She was twenty, and she held a flower in her fingers. On the canvas, she seems to be offering the flower to her husband.

There was a case, however, in which I don't know whether he learned or taught, or whether he did both, as I did. That's what I'll tell you in the next chapter. In this I will only say that, after a few days of adjustment with the household, I went to see my friend; it was ten o'clock in the morning. Dona Fortunata, who was in the backyard, didn't even wait for me to ask her about her daughter.","Nothing escaped Capitu’s curiosity. There was one occasion, though, when I do not know if she was the teacher or the pupil, or both at the same time: the same was true of me. I’ll tell the story in the next chapter.

"Neste ponto, — lembra-me como se fosse hoje, — os olhos de José Dias fulguraram tão intensamente que me encheram de espanto. As pálpebras caíram depois, e assim ficaram por alguns instantes, até que novamente se ergueram, e os olhos fixaram-se na parede do pátio, como que embebidos em alguma cousa, se não era em si mesmos; depois despegaram-se da parede e entraram a vagar pelo pátio todo. Podia compará-lo aqui à vaca de Homero; andava e gemia em volta da cria que acabava de parir. Não lhe perguntei o que é que tinha, já por acanhamento, já porque dous lentes, um deles de teologia, vinham caminhando na nossa direção. Ao passarem por nós, o agregado, que os conhecia, cortejou-os com as deferências devidas, e pediu-lhes notícias minhas.","At this point — he remembers me as if it were today — José Dias' eyes shone so intensely that they filled me with astonishment. The eyelids then dropped, and remained so for a few moments, until they rose again, and the eyes fixed themselves on the wall of the courtyard, as if absorbed in something, if not themselves; then they detached themselves from the wall and began to wander around the whole courtyard. I could compare it here to Homer's cow; walked and moaned around the calf that had just given birth. I didn't ask him what he had, either out of shyness or because two professors, one of them in theology, were walking towards us. As they passed us, the aggregate, who knew them, courted them with due deference, and asked them to hear from me.","At this point—I remember as if it were today—José Dias’ eyes flashed so intensely that I was amazed. His lids then shut, and stayed thus for a few moments, until they lifted again, and his eyes fixed on the patio wall, as if absorbed in something: unless they were absorbed in themselves. Then they dragged themselves away from the wall and began to wander round the whole patio. I might compare him to Homer’s cow; it wandered and moaned around the calf which it had just given birth to. * I did not ask him what the matter was, either out of shyness, or because two lecturers, one of whom taught theology, were coming in our direction. As they passed us, the dependent, who knew them, greeted them with appropriately deferential words, and asked how I was getting on.","At this point – I remember it as if it were today – José Dias’s eyes blazed so intensely that I was filled with amazement. Then he lowered his lids and held them like that for a moment or two before opening them again and fixing his eyes on the wall of the yard as if fascinated by something. Finally his gaze switched from the wall and began to stray round the yard. I might compare him to Homer’s cow, which wandered, mooing, round its newly born calf. I did not ask him what the matter was, partly out of shyness and partly because two lecturers, one of them a theologian, were coming in our direction.

Era não menos que isto. Minha mãe, ao parecer dele, estava arrependida do que fizera, e desejaria ver-me cá fora, mas entendia que o vínculo moral da promessa a prendia indissoluvelmente. Cumpria rompê-lo, e para tanto valia a Escritura, com o poder de desligar dado aos apóstolos. Assim que, ele e eu iríamos a Roma pedir a absolvição do papa… Que me parecia?","The next day he revealed the mystery to me. At first glance, I confess that I was dazzled. It carried a note of grandeur and spirituality that spoke to my eyes as a seminarian. It was no less than this. My mother, in his opinion, was sorry for what she had done, and would have liked to see me outside, but she understood that the moral bond of the promise bound her indissolubly. It was necessary to break it, and for this the Scripture was valid, with the power of loosing given to the apostles. So he and I would go to Rome to ask for the Pope's absolution… What did I think?","The next day he unveiled the mystery. At first sight, I confess I was dazzled. It had a grand, spiritual quality which answered to my seminarist’s notions. It was nothing less than this: my mother, he thought, repented of what she had done, and would like to see me out here in the world, but thought that the moral ties of the promise bound her irrevocably. We had to break those ties, and the means was in Scripture, in the power of unbinding given to the apostles. So, he and I would go to Rome to ask absolution of the Pope … What did I think?","The next day he unveiled the mystery, which at first hearing left me fascinated. There was something lofty and spiritual about it that appealed to me as a seminarist. It was no less than this. My mother, in his view, repented of what she had done and wanted me back but was convinced that the moral obligation of her promise bound her indissolubly. The problem was to release her, and here the Scriptures came into play through the power of dispensation given to the Apostles. He and I would go to Rome to beg absolution from the Pope … What did I think?"
"— Seguramente, acudiu José Dias, entretanto, pode ser que a sra. dona Justina tenha alguma razão. A verdade é que uma cousa não impede outra, e a reflexão casa-se muito bem à curiosidade natural. Parece curioso, isso parece, mas…","— Surely, José Dias came to the rescue, however, it could be that Mrs. Justina has a point. The truth is that one thing does not prevent another, and reflection is very well married to natural curiosity. It sounds curious, it does, but…","“Assuredly,” added José Dias, “however, it may be that there is some truth in what Dona Justina says. One thing does not rule out the other, and reflection is well matched with natural curiosity. He is inquisitive, certainly, but …”","‘That’s it,’ put in José Dias, ‘though Dona Justina may well be right. The truth is that one thing doesn’t rule out the other, and thoughtfulness goes very well with natural curiosity. There’s no doubt he’s curious, but …’"
"— Jura, papai!","- Swear it, daddy!","“Swear it, Papa!”",‘Will you promise?’
"— Não importa, disse-me José Dias; podemos apear-nos à porta do Passeio Público.","— It doesn't matter, José Dias told me; we can get off at the door of the Passeio Público.","“It doesn’t matter,” José Dias said to me, “we can get off at the entrance to the Promenade.”†","‘It doesn’t matter,’ said José Dias. ‘We can get off at the Promenade.’"
"O recebedor das passagens puxou a correia que ia ter ao braço do cocheiro, o ônibus parou, e o homem desceu. José Dias deu duas voltas rápidas à cabeça, pegou-me no braço e fez-me descer consigo. Iríamos também acompanhar o Santíssimo. Efetivamente, o sino chamava os fiéis àquele serviço da última hora. Já havia algumas pessoas na sacristia. Era a primeira vez que me achava em momento tão grave; obedeci, a princípio constrangido, mas logo depois satisfeito, menos pela caridade do serviço que por me dar um ofício de homem. Quando o sacristão começou a distribuir as opas, entrou um sujeito esbaforido; era o meu vizinho Pádua, que também ia acompanhar o Santíssimo. Deu conosco, veio cumprimentar-nos. José Dias fez um gesto de aborrecido, e apenas lhe respondeu com uma palavra seca, olhando para o padre, que lavava as mãos. Depois, como Pádua falasse ao sacristão, baixinho, aproximou-se deles; eu fiz a mesma cousa. Pádua solicitava do sacristão uma das varas do pálio. José Dias pediu uma para si.","The ticket recipient pulled the strap he was going to have on the coachman's arm, the bus stopped, and the man got off. José Dias turned his head twice quickly, took me by the arm and made me go down with him. We would also accompany the Blessed Sacrament. In effect, the bell called the faithful to that last-minute service. There were already some people in the sacristy. It was the first time that I found myself in such a serious situation; I obeyed, at first embarrassed, but soon after satisfied, less for the charity of the service than for giving me a man's office. As the sexton began to distribute the opas, a breathless fellow entered; it was my neighbor Padua, who was also going to accompany the Blessed Sacrament. He found us, came to greet us. José Dias made a gesture of annoyance, and only replied with a dry word, looking at the priest, who was washing his hands. Then, as Padua was speaking to the sacristan, in a low voice, he approached them; i did the same thing. Padua asked the sacristan for one of the poles of the pallium. José Dias asked for one for himself.","The conductor pulled the cord which was connected to the driver’s arm, the bus stopped, and the man got off. José Dias jerked his head round twice, grabbed me by the arm and made me get off with him. We too were going to accompany the Sacrament. The bell was indeed calling the faithful to the service of extreme unction. There were already some people in the sacristy. It was the first time I had ever been present at such a solemn occasion; I obeyed, somewhat embarrassed at first, but soon pleased with myself, less because of the charity being performed than because I was taking a man’s position. When the sacristan began to hand out the surplices, someone came in out of breath; it was my neighbor Pádua, who had also come to accompany the Sacrament. He saw us and came over to greet us. José Dias gave an irritated gesture, and barely replied with one brief word: he was looking at the priest, who was washing his hands. Then, as Pádua was talking to the sacristan in a low voice, he went nearer; I did the same thing. Pádua was asking the sacristan if he could carry one of the poles of the canopy. José Dias asked for one for himself:","The conductor pulled the cord, which was attached to the coachman’s arm, the bus came to a halt and the man got off. José Dias gave a quick look round, then, seizing me by the arm, made me get off with him. We, too, were to accompany the procession. The bells were in fact summoning the faithful to the service of the last rites, and there were already some people in the sacristy. It was the first time I had been present on such a solemn occasion; I obeyed him, unwillingly at first, but later I was pleased not so much by the charitable nature of the church service but because I performed the duties of an adult. As the sacristan was about to distribute the surplices a fellow rushed in completely out of breath; it was my neighbour, Pádua, who had also come to accompany the procession. Seeing us he came over to greet us. With an offended air José Dias gave a brief word of reply, keeping his eyes fixed on the priest, who was washing his hands. Then, as Pádua was whispering to the sacristan, he moved closer and I followed. Pàdua was asking to hold one of the shafts of the canopy. José Dias asked for one for himself."
"— Não, retorquiu o Senhor, não quero ouvir nada.","— No, retorted the Lord, I don't want to hear anything.","“No,” replied the Lord, “I don’t want to hear a thing.”","‘“No,” replied the Lord. “I don’t want to hear anything.”"

"Custa-me dizer isto, mas antes peque por excessivo que por diminuto. Quis responder que não, que não queria ver o Manduca, e fiz até um gesto para fugir. Não era medo; noutra ocasião pode ser até que entrasse com facilidade e curiosidade, mas agora ia tão contente! Ver um defunto ao voltar de uma namorada… Há cousas que se não ajustam nem combinam. A simples notícia era já uma turvação grande. As minhas ideias de ouro perderam todas a cor e o metal para se trocarem em cinza escura e feia, e não distingui mais nada. Penso que cheguei a dizer que tinha pressa, mas provavelmente não falei por palavras claras, nem sequer humanas, porque ele, encostado ao portal, abria-me espaço com o gesto, e eu, sem alma para entrar nem fugir, deixei ao corpo fazer o que pudesse, e o corpo acabou entrando.","It's hard for me to say this, but I'd rather sin as excessive than too small. I wanted to say no, I didn't want to see Manduca, and I even made a gesture to run away. It wasn't fear; on another occasion he might even enter with ease and curiosity, but now he was so happy! Seeing a dead person returning from a girlfriend… There are things that don't fit or match. The simple news was already a big turmoil. My golden ideas lost all color and metal to change into ugly dark gray, and I couldn't make out anything else. I think I even said that I was in a hurry, but I probably didn't speak in clear words, not even human ones, because he, leaning against the portal, opened space for me with the gesture, and I, without a soul to enter or escape, let my body do the work. whatever it could, and the body ended up entering.","It’s painful for me to say this, but it is better to sin by saying too much than too little. I wanted to say no, that I did not want to see Manduca, and I even made a move as if to get away. It was not fear; I might have gone in on another occasion quite readily and with a certain curiosity, but I was so happy at that moment! To see a dead body on my way back from seeing my sweetheart… There are things that don’t mix or fit in with each other. Even the news itself upset me. My golden thoughts all lost their color and metallic sheen, turning into dull, ugly ashes, and I felt utterly confused. I think I went so far as to say that I was in a hurry, but probably I didn’t speak in clear words, or even in human speech, because he, leaning in the entrance way, was motioning me in, and I, without the heart to enter or run away, let my body do what it could, and it ended up going in.","It is not easy to admit this, but it is better to sin on the side of too much than too little. I wanted to say no, that I didn’t want to see Manduca, and made as if to walk away. It wasn’t fear. On any other occasion my curiosity would easily have convinced me to go inside, but now it was not so inviting. To look at a corpse after meeting one’s lover … Certain things do not go well together. The news alone was enough to upset me. My golden thoughts lost their hard brightness and were reduced to ugly, dark ashes; my mind was in a whirl. I think I managed to stammer that I was in a hurry, but probably my words were confused and indistinguishable, because he moved aside from where he was leaning against the doorpost and motioned me in. Incapable of moving one way or the other I let my body do what it would, and my body ended up going inside."
"— Qual, Sírio, Capitu. Há vinte minutos que eu falei de Sírio.","— Come on, Sirius, Capitu. Twenty minutes ago I spoke about Sirius.","“Sirius my foot, Capitu. It’s twenty minutes since I mentioned Sirius.”","‘Sirius my foot, Capitu! It’s twenty minutes since I mentioned Sirius.’"
"Retórica dos namorados, dá-me uma comparação exata e poética para dizer o que foram aqueles olhos de Capitu. Não me acode imagem capaz de dizer, sem quebra da dignidade do estilo, o que eles foram e me fizeram. Olhos de ressaca? Vá, de ressaca. É o que me dá ideia daquela feição nova. Traziam não sei que fluido misterioso e enérgico, uma força que arrastava para dentro, como a vaga que se retira da praia, nos dias de ressaca. Para não ser arrastado, agarrei-me às outras partes vizinhas, às orelhas, aos braços, aos cabelos espalhados pelos ombros; mas tão depressa buscava as pupilas, a onda que saía delas vinha crescendo, cava e escura, ameaçando envolver-me, puxar-me e tragar-me. Quantos minutos gastamos naquele jogo? Só os relógios do céu terão marcado esse tempo infinito e breve. A eternidade tem as suas pêndulas; nem por não acabar nunca deixa de querer saber a duração das felicidades e dos suplícios. Há de dobrar o gozo aos bem-aventurados do céu conhecer a soma dos tormentos que já terão padecido no inferno os seus inimigos; assim também a quantidade das delícias que terão gozado no céu os seus desafetos aumentará as dores aos condenados do inferno. Este outro suplício escapou ao divino Dante; mas eu não estou aqui para emendar poetas. Estou para contar que, ao cabo de um tempo não marcado, agarrei-me definitivamente aos cabelos de Capitu, mas então com as mãos, e disse-lhe, — para dizer alguma cousa, — que era capaz de os pentear, se quisesse.","Valentine's rhetoric, gives me an exact and poetic comparison to say what those eyes of Capitu were like. I have no image capable of saying, without breaking the dignity of the style, what they were and did to me. Hangover eyes? Come on, hungover. That's what gives me the idea of that new feature. I don't know what mysterious and energetic fluid they carried, a force that dragged them inward, like the wave that retreats from the beach on a hangover day. In order not to be dragged, I clung to the other neighboring parts, to the ears, to the arms, to the hair spread over the shoulders; but as soon as I searched for the pupils, the wave that came out of them was growing, deep and dark, threatening to envelop me, pull me in and engulf me. How many minutes did we spend on that game? Only the clocks in the sky will have marked this infinite and brief time. Eternity has its pendulums; nor, because it does not end, never ceases to want to know the duration of happiness and torture. The joy of the blessed in heaven must be doubled to know the sum of the torments that their enemies will have already suffered in hell; in the same way the amount of delights that his disaffected will have enjoyed in heaven will increase the pain of the damned of hell. This other torture escaped the divine Dante; but I'm not here to amend poets. I'm about to tell you that, after an unmarked time, I definitely grabbed hold of Capitu's hair, but then with my hands, and told her — to say something — that I could comb it if I wanted to.","Lovers’ language, give me an exact and poetic comparison to say what those eyes of Capitu were like. No image comes to mind that doesn’t offend against the rules of good style, to say what they were and what they did to me. Undertow eyes? Why not? Undertow. That’s the notion that the new expression put in my head. They held some kind of mysterious, active fluid, a force that dragged one in, like the undertow of a wave retreating from the shore on stormy days. So as not to be dragged in, I held on to anything around them, her ears, her arms, her hair spread about her shoulders; but as soon as I returned to the pupils of her eyes again, the wave emerging from them grew towards me, deep and dark, threatening to envelop me, draw me in and swallow me up. How many minutes did this game last? Only the clocks of heaven could have registered that space of time which was infinite, yet brief. Eternity has its pendula; just because it never ends does not mean it takes no cognizance of the duration of bliss and damnation. The joy of the blessed in heaven must be doubled by knowing the sum of torments their enemies have already suffered in hell; so too the quantity of delights their foes enjoy in heaven must increase the agony of the damned. This particular torture escaped the divine Dante’s notice; but I am not here to correct poets. I am simply about to recount that, after an unspecified time, I finally grasped Capitu’s hair, but this time with my hands, and said—so as to say something—that I would comb it for her, if she wanted.","Rhetorical muse of lovers, give me an exact poetical image to describe those eyes of Capitu. I can think of no comparison which, without lowering the dignity of the style, can convey what they were and the effect they produced on me. Whirlpool eyes? Very well then, whirlpool eyes be it. That is the idea her new expression brings to mind. They had some mysterious, powerful fluidity that drew one into them like a whirlpool or a wave receding from the beach on a stormy day. So as not to be dragged in I clung to neighbouring parts – her ears, her arms, her hair that fell loosely over her shoulders. But immediately I returned to seek those pupils, that ever-growing wave, dark and profound, that threatened to reach out, suck me in and engulf me. How many minutes did our game last? Only the clocks of heaven could register a space of time so infinite and yet so brief. Eternity has its own clocks, which never stop, yet still it wishes to know the duration of our joys and our suffering. To know the extent of the torments of their enemies in hell serves to double the pleasures of the favoured of heaven. Similarly, the number of the delights their foes enjoy in heaven increases the agony of those condemned to hell. This further torture was omitted by the divine Dante. But I have no intention here of emending the poets. What I wish to say is that after a brief pause I seized hold of Capitu’s hair, this time with my hands, and said to her – for the sake of saying something – that I would comb it for her if she wished."
"— Por ora nada se pode afiançar, disse um deles, mas parece que dará conta da mão.","—Nothing can be secured for the time being, said one of them, but it looks like it will do the trick.","“We can’t promise anything yet,” said one of them, “but it seems he’ll do well.”","‘It’s too early to say yet,’ replied one of them, ‘but I think he’ll do well.’"

"No dia seguinte, passei pela casa do defunto, sem entrar nem parar, — ou, se parei, foi só um instante, ainda mais breve que este em que vo-lo digo.

"Já disse que era poupada, ou fica dito agora, e não só de dinheiro mas também de cousas usadas, dessas que se guardam por tradição, por lembrança ou por saudade. Uns sapatos, por exemplo, uns sapatinhos rasos de fitas pretas que se cruzavam no peito do pé e princípio da perna, os últimos que usou antes de calçar botinas, trouxe-os para casa, e tirava-os de longe em longe da gaveta da cômoda, com outras velharias, dizendo-me que eram pedaços de criança. Minha mãe, que tinha o mesmo gênio, gostava de ouvir falar e fazer assim. Quanto às puras economias de dinheiro, direi um caso, e basta. Foi justamente por ocasião de uma lição de astronomia, à praia da Glória. Sabes que alguma vez a fiz cochilar um pouco. Uma noite perdeu-se em fitar o mar, com tal força e concentração, que me deu ciúmes.","I have already said that I was saved, or it is said now, and not only of money but also of used things, those that are kept by tradition, memory or nostalgia. Some shoes, for example, a pair of flat shoes with black ribbons that crossed the instep and the beginning of the leg, the last ones she wore before putting on boots, she brought them home, and took them from far to far from the drawer of the chest of drawers, with other old things, telling me they were pieces of a child. My mother, who had the same genius, liked to hear about it and do it like that. As for the pure savings of money, I will mention one case, and that will be enough. It was precisely on the occasion of an astronomy lesson, at Praia da Glória. You know I once made her nap a little. One night he lost himself staring at the sea with such strength and concentration that it made me jealous.","I’ve already said that she was thrifty—and if I haven’t I have now—and not only with money but with worn-out objects, that you keep out of respect for the past, as a memory or for old times’ sake. A pair of shoes, for example, little flat shoes with black ribbons that were tied at the instep and ankle, the last ones she had used before she wore more formal shoes: she brought them home, and once in a while took them out the chest of drawers, with other old things, telling me that they were part of her childhood. My mother, who had the same temperament, liked to hear her talking and doing things in this way. As for saving money itself, I’ll tell one story, and that’s enough. It was, precisely, on one of those occasions when I was giving her an astronomy lesson, at our house in Glória. You know that sometimes I made her nod off a little. One night she was lost to the world, staring at the sea, with such intensity and concentration that I became jealous.","I have always said that she was thrifty, or if I haven’t I do so now and not only with money but with old worn-out things that you keep out of habit, as a souvenir or for sentimental reasons. She had some shoes, for example, small, flat shoes that tied at the instep with black ribbon, the last that she had used before wearing boots, which she brought to the house and would take from her dressing-table from time to time together with other old odds and ends, saying that they were part of her childhood. My mother, who was of a similar temperament, liked to hear her talk and behave in this way. As for purely financial matters, I shall mention just one instance and that will do. It was on the occasion of an astronomy lesson by the seaside in Glória, when you will remember that I made her doze off. One night she was gazing at the sea with such deep concentration that I felt jealous."
"Quando levantei a cabeça, dei com a figura de Capitu diante de mim.

Here's another move, which will seem like a theater, and it's as natural as the first, since the mother and son went to mass, and Capitu didn't leave without talking to me. It was already dry and brief speech; Most of the time, I didn't even look at her. She always looked, waiting.","When I lifted my head, I saw the figure of Capitu before me.

"Tudo me ia repetindo o diabo do opúsculo, com as suas letras velhas e citações latinas. Vi sair daquelas folhas muitos perfis de seminaristas: os irmãos Albuquerque, por exemplo, um dos quais é cônego na Bahia, enquanto o outro seguiu medicina e dizem haver descoberto um específico contra a febre amarela. Vi o Bastos, um magricela, que está de vigário em Meia-Ponte, se não morreu já; Luiz Borges, apesar de padre, fez-se político, e acabou senador do Império… Quantas outras caras me fitavam das páginas frias do Panegírico! Não, não eram frias; traziam o calor da juventude nascente, o calor do passado, o meu próprio calor. Queria lê-las outra vez, e lograva entender algum texto, tão recente como no primeiro dia, ainda que mais breve.

I saw on those sheets many profiles of seminarians: the Albuquerque brothers, for example, one of whom is a canon in Bahia, while the other studied medicine and they say they have discovered a specific one against yellow fever. I saw Bastos, a scrawny one, who is a vicar in Meia-Ponte, if he hasn't died already; Luiz Borges, despite being a priest, became a politician, and ended up a senator of the Empire… How many other faces stared at me from the cold pages of the Panegyric! No, they weren't cold; they brought the warmth of nascent youth, the warmth of the past, my own warmth. I wanted to read them again, and I managed to understand some text, as recent as the first day, although shorter.

"Falava baixinho; pegou-me na mão, e pôs o dedo na boca.

"Não fui logo, logo; fi-lo esperar uns dez ou quinze minutos na sala. Só depois é que me lembrou que cumpria ter certo alvoroço e correr, abraçá-lo, falar-lhe na mãe. A mãe, — creio que ainda não disse que estava morta e enterrada. Estava; lá repousa na velha Suíça. Acabei de vestir-me às pressas. Quando saí do quarto, tomei ares de pai, um pai entre manso e crespo, metade dom Casmurro. Ao entrar na sala, dei com um rapaz, de costas, mirando o busto de Massinissa, pintado na parede. Vim cauteloso, e não fiz rumor. Não obstante, ouviu-me os passos, e voltou-se depressa. Conheceu-me pelos retratos e correu para mim. Não me mexi; era nem mais nem menos o meu antigo e jovem companheiro do seminário de São José, um pouco mais baixo, menos cheio de corpo, e, salvo as cores, que eram vivas, o mesmo rosto do meu amigo. Trajava à moderna, naturalmente, e as maneiras eram diferentes, mas o aspecto geral reproduzia a pessoa morta. Era o próprio, o exato, o verdadeiro Escobar.

Only later did he remind me that I had to be excited and run, hug him, talk to him about his mother. The mother—I don't think I said yet that she was dead and buried. Was; there he rests in old Switzerland. I just got dressed in a hurry. When I left the room, I took on the air of a father, a father between meek and curly, half Don Casmurro. Upon entering the room, I found a young man, his back turned, looking at the bust of Massinissa, painted on the wall. I came cautiously, and made no noise. Nevertheless, he heard my footsteps, and turned quickly. He knew me from the portraits and ran to me. I didn't move; he was neither more nor less my old, young companion from the seminary in São José, a little shorter, less full of body, and, save for the colors, which were vivid, the same face as my friend. He was dressed in modern fashion, of course, and the manners were different, but the general appearance reproduced the dead person. He was the very, the exact, the real Escobar. It was my combo; was his father's son. She wore mourning clothes for her mother; I was also in black. We sat down.","I didn’t go straight away; I made him wait for ten or fifteen minutes in the living room. Only afterwards did it occur to me that I should be somewhat excited, and should run in, embrace him and speak to him of his mother. His mother—I don’t think I’ve said that she was dead and buried. She was; there she rests in the earth of old Switzerland. I hurriedly finished dressing. When I came out of my room, I took on a father’s air, somewhere between gentle and brusque, half Dom Casmurro. When I came into the room, I saw a young man, with his back to me, looking at the bust of Massinissa painted on the wall. I trod carefully, making no sound.

He was dressed in the modern fashion, of course, and his manners were different, but his general demeanor reproduced the dead man. It was the same, the exact, the true Escobar. It was my wife’s lover; he was his father’s son. He was in mourning for his mother; I too was in black.

"Padre Cabral respondeu que sim, que se podia, e, voltando-se para mim, falou da minha vocação, que era manifesta; os meus brinquedos foram sempre de igreja, e eu adorava os ofícios divinos. A prova não provava; todas as crianças do meu tempo eram devotas. Cabral acrescentou que o reitor de São José, a quem contara ultimamente a promessa de minha mãe, tinha o meu nascimento por milagre; ele era da mesma opinião. Capitu, cosida às saias de minha mãe, não atendia aos olhos ansiosos que eu lhe mandava; também não parecia escutar a conversação sobre o seminário e suas consequências, e, aliás, decorou o principal, como vim a saber depois. Duas vezes fui à janela, esperando que ela fosse também, e ficássemos à vontade, sozinhos, até acabar o mundo, se acabasse, mas Capitu não me apareceu. Não deixou minha mãe, senão para ir embora.

Capitu, sewn into my mother's skirts, did not respond to the anxious eyes I sent her; nor did he seem to be listening to the conversation about the seminar and its aftermath, and indeed he memorized the main thing, as I later learned. Twice I went to the window, hoping she would go too, and we would be at ease, alone, until the world ended, if it did, but Capitu did not appear. He didn't leave my mother, except to go away. They were Hail Marys, he said goodbye.","Father Cabral said yes, that one could, and turning to me, spoke of my. vocation, which was manifest; my toys had always had to do with the Church, and I loved divine service.

Capitu, who stayed close to my mother, paid no attention to the anxious looks I directed at her; she did not even seem to be listening to the conversation about the seminary and its consequences, though she had its main points by heart, as I found out afterwards. Twice I went to the window, hoping that she would go too, and that we would be free and alone till the end of the world, if it should ever end, but Capitu did not come. She didn’t leave my mother’s side, until she went home. It was time for her ave marias, and she said goodbye.","Father Cabral replied that you could. Then, turning to me, he said that my vocation was obvious: my toys were all connected with the Church and I loved the divine services. This proved nothing: all the children in those days were devout. Cabral added that the rector of São José, whom he had recently informed of my mother’s promise, regarded my birth as a miracle, and he himself was of the same opinion. Capitu, who remained glued to my mother’s side, paid no attention to the anxious looks I cast at her, nor did she appear to be listening to the conversation about the seminary and its implications, though she fully remembered the main topics, as I afterwards learned. Twice I went to the window in the hope that she would join me, and the two of us be alone together until the end of the world, if the world ever came to an end, but Capitu never appeared. She stayed with my mother until she left. It was time for her prayers, so she said goodbye."

Escobar era muito polido; e, conquanto falasse mais do que veio a falar depois, ainda assim não era tanto como os rapazes da nossa idade; naquele dia achei-o um pouco mais expansivo que de costume. Tio Cosme quis que jantasse conosco. Escobar refletiu um instante e acabou dizendo que o correspondente do pai esperava por ele. Eu, lembrando-me das palavras do Gurgel, repeti-as:","Tio Cosme and José Dias liked the young man; the household told him that he had seen his father once in Rio de Janeiro.

"Outra ideia, não, — um sentimento cruel e desconhecido, o puro ciúme, leitor das minhas entranhas. Tal foi o que me mordeu, ao repetir comigo as palavras de José Dias: “Algum peralta da vizinhança”. Em verdade, nunca pensara em tal desastre. Vivia tão nela, dela e para ela, que a intervenção de um peralta era como uma noção sem realidade; nunca me acudiu que havia peraltas na vizinhança, vária idade e feitio, grandes passeadores das tardes. Agora lembrava-me que alguns olhavam para Capitu, — e tão senhor me sentia dela que era como se olhassem para mim, um simples dever de admiração e de inveja. Separados um do outro pelo espaço e pelo destino, o mal aparecia-me agora, não só possível, mas certo. E a alegria de Capitu confirmava a suspeita; se ela vivia alegre é que já namorava a outro, acompanhá-lo-ia com os olhos na rua, falar-lhe-ia à janela, às ave-marias, trocariam flores e…","Another idea, no — a cruel and unknown feeling, pure jealousy, reader of my guts. This was what bit me, when I repeated the words of José Dias: “Some mischievous neighbor”. In truth, he had never thought of such a disaster.

Now I remembered that some looked at Capitu — and I felt so lord of her that it was as if they were looking at me, a simple duty of admiration and envy. Separated from each other by space and fate, evil now appeared to me, not only possible, but certain. And Capitu's joy confirmed the suspicion; if she was happy, it was because she was already dating someone else, she would follow him with her eyes on the street, she would talk to him at the window, at the Hail Mary's, they would exchange flowers and...","Not another idea—a cruel, unknown feeling, pure jealousy, dearly beloved reader. That was what bit into me, as I repeated to myself José Dias’ words: “some local beau.” The truth is that I had never thought of such a calamity.

And Capitu’s happiness confirmed the suspicion; if she was continually happy it was because she was already flirting with someone else, following him with her eyes in the street, talking to him at the window in the evening, exchanging flowers and…","Then another thought came into my head … Not another thought – a strange, cruel sensation: pure jealousy, my dearest reader. That is what gripped me when I repeated to myself José Dias’s words: some young buck in the neighbourhood. The idea of such a calamity had never entered my head. She was part of my life. I lived so bound up in her that the intrusion of a young buck was something that made no sense; it had never occurred to me that there were young bucks in the neighbourhood, of different ages and types, much given to strolling about of an afternoon. I remembered now that some of them used to look at Capitu, but so sure was I of her that it was as if they were looking at me, paying an ordinary tribute of admiration and envy. Now that destiny had separated us, the danger seemed not merely possible but certain.

"Corri ao meu quarto, peguei dos livros, mas não passei à sala da lição; sentei-me na cama, recordando o penteado e o resto. Tinha estremeções, tinha uns esquecimentos em que perdia a consciência de mim e das cousas que me rodeavam, para viver não sei onde nem como. E tornava a mim, e via a cama, as paredes, os livros, o chão, ouvia algum som de fora, vago, próximo ou remoto, e logo perdia tudo para sentir somente os beiços de Capitu… Sentia-os estirados, embaixo dos meus, igualmente esticados para os dela, e unindo-se uns aos outros.

Demorei-me mais nisto que no resto, em parte porque éramos religiosos, em parte para compensar a batina que eu ia deitar às ortigas; mas ainda restava uma parte que atribuo ao intuito secreto e inconsciente de captar a proteção do céu.

"Manduca enterrou-se sem mim. A muitos outros aconteceu a mesma cousa, sem que eu sentisse nada, mas este caso afligiu-me particularmente pela razão já dita.

Nem foi só ele; duas pessoas vieram ajudá-lo, Capitu, cuja imagem dormiu comigo na mesma noite, e outra que direi no capítulo que vem.

The rest of this chapter is just to ask that if anyone has to read my book with any more attention than the price of the copy demands, do not fail to conclude that the devil is not as ugly as he paints. What I mean to say…","Manduca was buried without me. The same thing has happened to many others, without my feeling anything, but this case upset me particularly for the reason already mentioned. I also felt a kind of melancholy as I recalled the first polemic of my life, the joy with which he received my papers and got to work to refute them, not counting the desire to go in the carriage … But time quickly erased all those regrets and rebirths of old memories. Nor was it only time; two people came to assist it, Capitu, whose image came to sleep with me that same night, and another which I will tell you of in the next chapter. The rest of this chapter is only to ask that, if someone reads my book with more attention than is demanded by the price of a copy, he should be certain to conclude that the devil is not as black as he’s painted. What I mean is…","I never forgot Manduca. Others, too, I have never forgotten, though they did not move me in the same way: his case was especially affecting for the reason I have already stated. It was with a certain regret that I recalled my first experience of polemics, the pleasure with which he received my arguments and prepared to refute them, not to mention the pleasure of the coach … But time soon eradicated all these recollections and fond memories. And not time alone: two people came to his assistance – Capitu, whose image slept with me that night, and another, about whom I shall write in the next chapter.

"Deus é o poeta. A música é de Satanás, jovem maestro de muito futuro, que aprendeu no conservatório do céu. Rival de Miguel, Rafael e Gabriel, não tolerava a precedência que eles tinham na distribuição dos prêmios. Pode ser também que a música em demasia doce e mística daqueles outros condiscípulos fosse aborrecível ao seu gênio essencialmente trágico. Tramou uma rebelião que foi descoberta a tempo, e ele expulso do conservatório. Tudo se teria passado sem mais nada, se Deus não houvesse escrito um libreto de ópera, do qual abrira mão, por entender que tal gênero de recreio era impróprio da sua eternidade. Satanás levou o manuscrito consigo para o inferno. Com o fim de mostrar que valia mais que os outros, — e acaso para reconciliar-se com o céu — compôs a partitura, e logo que a acabou foi levá-la ao Padre Eterno.","God is the poet.

"A enferma era uma senhora viúva, tísica, tinha uma filha de quinze ou dezesseis anos, que estava chorando à porta do quarto. A moça não era formosa, talvez nem tivesse graça; os cabelos caíam despenteados, e as lágrimas faziam-lhe encarquilhar os olhos. Não obstante, o total falava e cativava o coração. O vigário confessou a doente, deu-lhe a comunhão e os santos óleos. O pranto da moça redobrou tanto que senti os meus olhos molhados e fugi. Vim para perto de uma janela. Pobre criatura! A dor era comunicativa em si mesma; complicada da lembrança de minha mãe, doeu-me mais, e, quando enfim pensei em Capitu, senti um ímpeto de soluçar também, enfiei pelo corredor, e ouvi alguém dizer-me:","The sick woman was a widow, with consumption, she had a daughter of fifteen or sixteen years old, who was crying at the door of her room. The girl wasn't pretty, maybe not even funny; her hair was disheveled, and tears made her eyes pucker. Nevertheless, the total spoke and captivated the heart. The vicar confessed the sick woman, gave her communion and the holy oils. The girl's crying redoubled so much that my eyes felt wet and I ran away. I came to a window. Poor creature! Pain was communicative in itself; complicated by the memory of my mother, it hurt me more, and when I finally thought about Capitu, I felt an urge to sob too, I went down the hall, and I heard someone say to me:","The sick person was a widow, a consumptive with a daughter of fifteen or sixteen, who was crying at the door to the room. She was not a pretty girl, perhaps not even agreeable; her hair hung down uncombed, and her tears wrinkled her eyes. All the same, the whole scene spoke to my heart and moved me. The priest confessed the sick woman, gave her communion and extreme unction. The girl began to weep so much that I felt the tears coming to my eyes and fled. I went over to a window. Poor creature! The pain itself was catching; wound up with memories of my mother, it hurt me more, and when I finally thought of Capitu I felt the urge to cry. I ran into the corridor, and heard someone say to me:","The sick woman was dying of consumption; she was a widow and had a daughter of fifteen or sixteen who was standing at the bedroom door, crying. The girl was far from pretty, not even comely-looking; her hair was in disorder and her eyes screwed up with weeping. But the sight of her moved one to compassion. The priest heard the sick woman’s confession and administered the sacrament and holy oil. The girl’s sobs grew so loud that I felt my own eyes moisten and hastened away. I stood close to a window. Poor girl! Her grief communicated itself, made more intense by my thoughts of my own mother, and when I finally came round to thinking of Capitu"

"Hão de perguntar-me por que razão, tendo a própria casa velha, na mesma rua antiga, não impedi que a demolissem e vim reproduzi-la nesta. A pergunta devia ser feita a princípio, mas aqui vai a resposta. A razão é que, logo que minha mãe morreu, querendo ir para lá, fiz primeiro uma longa visita de inspeção por alguns dias, e toda a casa me desconheceu. No quintal a aroeira e a pitangueira, o poço, a caçamba velha e o lavadouro, nada sabia de mim. A casuarina era a mesma que eu deixara ao fundo, mas o tronco, em vez de reto, como outrora, tinha agora um ar de ponto de interrogação; naturalmente pasmava do intruso. Corri os olhos pelo ar, buscando algum pensamento que ali deixasse, e não achei nenhum. Ao contrário, a ramagem começou a sussurrar alguma cousa que não entendi logo, e parece que era a cantiga das manhãs novas. Ao pé dessa música sonora e jovial, ouvi também o grunhir dos porcos, espécie de troça concentrada e filosófica.","You will ask me why, having the old house itself, in the same old street, I didn't prevent it from being demolished and I came to reproduce it in this one. The question should have been asked at first, but here's the answer. The reason is that as soon as my mother died, wanting to go there, I first made a long inspection visit for a few days, and the whole house didn't know me. In the backyard, the mastic tree and the cherry tree, the well, the old bucket and the washing machine, knew nothing about me. The casuarina was the same one I had left at the bottom, but the trunk, instead of being straight, as it used to be, now had the look of a question mark; naturally amazed of the intruder. I ran my eyes through the air, looking for some thought to leave there, and found none. On the contrary, the branches began to whisper something that I didn't understand right away, and it seems that it was the song of the new mornings. At the foot of this sonorous and jovial music, I also heard the grunt of pigs, a kind of concentrated and philosophical mockery.","You will ask me why, since I owned the old house itself, in the same old street, I did not stop it being demolished and instead had this one reproduce it. The question should have been asked at the beginning, but here is the reply. The reason is that, shortly after my mother died, I wanted to move there, and first made a long visit of inspection for some days, and the whole house refused to recognize me. In the garden, the aroeira and the pitanga tree, the well with its old bucket and the washing stones knew nothing of me. * The casuarina tree was the same one I had left at the bottom of the garden, but the trunk, instead of being straight as in earlier days, now had the look of a question mark; probably it was surprised by the intruder. I ran my eyes over the scene, looking for some thought I might have left there, and could find none. On the contrary, the branches began to whisper something that I didn’t at first understand, and which it seems was the song of a new morning. Beneath that clear and cheerful music, I also heard the grunting of the pigs, a kind of concentrated, philosophical mockery.","I may well be asked why it was, owning the old house itself in the same old street, that I didn’t prevent it being demolished but came and made this copy. This question should have been asked at the beginning; nevertheless, here is the answer. The reason is that shortly after my mother died I thought of moving there, but going there first on a long visit of inspection I found that the house no longer knew me. In the garden, to the Californian pepper, the cherry tree, the well with its old bucket and the wash-house, I was a complete stranger. The oak was just as I had left it at the bottom of the garden, except that the trunk, instead of being straight as before, was now bent like a question mark, in natural astonishment at my intrusion. I gazed round, seeking some familiar vestige of the past, but there was none. On the contrary, the branches began to murmur something I did not at first understand, though I think it was a hymn to the morning. And accompanying this sweet harmonious music I heard, too, the grunting of the pigs, in a kind of mocking but meaningful counterpoint."
"— Juro! Deixe ver os olhos, Capitu.","- Interest! Let me see the eyes, Capitu.","“I swear! Let me see your eyes, Capitu.”","‘I promise. Let me see your eyes, Capitu.’"
"A razão disto era acabar de cismar, e escolher uma resolução que fosse adequada ao momento. O carro andaria mais depressa que as pernas; estas iriam pausadas ou não, podiam afrouxar o passo, parar, arrepiar caminho, e deixar que a cabeça cismasse à vontade. Fui andando e cismando. Tinha já comparado o gesto de Sancha na véspera e o desespero daquele dia; eram inconciliáveis. A viúva era realmente amantíssima. Assim se desvaneceu de todo a ilusão da minha vaidade. Não seria o mesmo caso de Capitu? Cuidei de recompor-lhe os olhos, a posição em que a vi, o ajuntamento de pessoas que devia naturalmente impor-lhe a dissimulação, se houvesse algo que dissimular. O que aqui vai pôr ordem lógica e dedutiva, tinha sido antes uma barafunda de ideias e sensações, graças aos solavancos do carro e às interrupções de José Dias. Agora, porém, raciocinava e evocava claro e bem. Concluí de mim para mim que era a antiga paixão que me ofuscava ainda e me fazia desvairar como sempre.","The reason for this was to finish brooding, and choose a resolution that suited the moment. The car would go faster than its legs; these would go slowly or not, they could slow down, stop, shiver along the way, and let their heads wander at will. I was walking and brooding. He had already compared Sancha's gesture the day before and the despair of that day; they were irreconcilable. The widow was really loving. Thus the illusion of my vanity vanished altogether. Wouldn't it be the same case of Capitu? I took care to restore her eyes, the position in which I saw her, the gathering of people who must naturally impose on her the dissimulation, if there was anything to dissimulate. What will put logical and deductive order here had previously been a mess of ideas and sensations, thanks to the bumps of the car and the interruptions of José Dias. Now, however, he reasoned and evoked clearly and well. I concluded for myself that it was the old passion that still dazzled me and made me frantic as usual.","The reason for this was to finish my thoughts, and reach a decision suitable to the moment. The carriage would go faster than my legs: these could choose their own pace, they could slow down, stop, turn back, and allow the head to go on thinking as it wanted to. I went on walking and brooding. I had already compared Sancha’s gesture of the previous day and her present despair: they were irreconcilable. She really was a most loving widow. Thus all the illusion conjured up by. my vanity disappeared. Wasn’t it the same with Capitu? I tried to visualize her eyes again, the position I saw her in, the press of the people that would naturally force her to dissemble, if there was anything to dissemble for. What is here present in logical, deductive order, had first been a confused medley of ideas and sensations, thanks to the jolting of the carriage and José Dias’ interruptions. Now, however, my head was clear and I could remember correctly. I came to the conclusion that it was my old passion that was blinding me still, and making me lose my head as always.","My reason was to carry on brooding and come to a decision appropriate at that moment. The carriage would move faster than my legs, which could choose their own pace, slow down, stop, turn back and allow the head to go on brooding. So I walked on, still brooding. I had already compared Sancha ’s behaviour the day before with her present anguish; they were irreconcilable. The widow really was loving. My vain illusions vanished into thin air. Might it not be the same with Capitu? I strove to remember her eyes, her position when I saw her, the press of people, which would naturally recommend dissimulation, if there were anything to dissemble. What I now examined in an orderly, logical manner had until then been a confused hotchpotch of ideas and impressions thanks to the jolting of the carriage and José Dias’s interruptions. Now, however, I was able to think straight and see things clearly. I told myself that I had been blinded by my former passion, which as always had left me slightly unhinged."
"José Dias tratava-me com extremos de mãe e atenções de servo. A primeira cousa que conseguiu logo que comecei a andar fora, foi dispensar-me o pajem; fez-se pajem, ia comigo à rua. Cuidava dos meus arranjos em casa, dos meus livros, dos meus sapatos, da minha higiene e da minha prosódia. Aos oito anos os meus plurais careciam, alguma vez, da desinência exata, ele a corrigia, meio sério para dar autoridade à lição, meio risonho para obter o perdão da emenda. Ajudava assim o mestre de primeiras letras. Mais tarde, quando o padre Cabral me ensinava latim, doutrina e história sagrada, ele assistia às lições, fazia reflexões eclesiásticas, e, no fim, perguntava ao padre: “Não é verdade que o nosso jovem amigo caminha depressa?”. Chamava-me “um prodígio”; dizia a minha mãe ter conhecido outrora meninos muito inteligentes, mas que eu excedia a todos esses, sem contar que, para a minha idade, possuía já certo número de qualidades morais sólidas. Eu, posto não avaliasse todo o valor deste outro elogio, gostava do elogio; era um elogio.","José Dias treated me with the extremes of a mother and the attentions of a servant. The first thing he succeeded in as soon as I began to go out was to send the page to me; he became a page, went with me to the street. I took care of my arrangements at home, my books, my shoes, my hygiene and my prosody. When I was eight, my plurals sometimes lacked the exact ending, he corrected it, half serious to give authority to the lesson, half smiling to obtain pardon for the amendment. This helped the master of first letters. Later, when Father Cabral taught me Latin, doctrine and sacred history, he attended the lessons, made ecclesiastical reflections, and, at the end, asked the priest: “Is it not true that our young friend walks fast?”. He called me “a prodigy”; My mother used to say that she had once known very intelligent boys, but that I exceeded them all, not to mention that, for my age, I already possessed a number of solid moral qualities. Even though I didn't appreciate the full value of this other compliment, I liked the compliment; it was a compliment.","José Dias treated me with a mother’s affection and a servant’s attentiveness. The first thing that he arranged as soon as I was old enough to go out, was to dispense with the page boy; he became my page, and accompanied me in the street. He looked after my affairs at home, my books, my shoes, my cleanliness and my grammar. When I was eight, my plurals sometimes carried the wrong endings, and he would correct them, half seriously to give the requisite authority to the lesson, half laughing to ask pardon for correcting me. In this way he helped my primary teacher. Later, when Father Cabral taught me Latin, doctrine, and sacred history, he sat in on the lessons and made ecclesiastical comments. At the end, he would ask the priest: “Our young friend is making admirable progress, is he not?” He called me “a prodigy”; told my mother that he had known very intelligent boys in years gone by, but that I surpassed them all, not to mention the fact that, for my age, I already possessed a number of solid moral qualities. Even though I could hardly appreciate the value of these words of praise, I took pleasure in them; it was praise, after all.","José Dias treated me with the tenderness of a mother and the attentiveness of a servant. The first thing he did when I began to be allowed out was to dispense with my attendant page. He himself became my page and accompanied me in the street. He also looked after me at home, taking care of my books, my shoes, my personal hygiene and my speech. When I was eight and my plural endings were wrong, he would correct them, half seriously to give authority to his instruction and half jokingly to excuse his interruption. In this way he helped my primary teacher. Later, when Father Cabral taught me Latin, doctrine and sacred history, he would sit in on the lessons, make observations of an ecclesiastical nature and at the end ask the priest, ‘Isn’t it true that our young friend is getting along fast?’ He would call me a prodigy and would tell my mother that in the past he had known many intelligent boys but that I surpassed them all, even without taking into account that for my age I possessed a number of solid moral qualities. And though I was unable fully to appreciate these final words of praise, I was pleased by them. Praise is always praise."
"Se pensas que o almoço foi amargo, enganas-te. Teve seus minutos de aborrecimento, é verdade; a princípio doeu-me que Ezequiel não fosse realmente meu filho, que me não completasse e continuasse. Se o rapaz tem saído à mãe, eu acabava crendo tudo, tanto mais facilmente quanto que ele parecia haver-me deixado na véspera, evocava a meninice, cenas e palavras, a ida para o colégio…","If you think lunch was bitter, you're wrong.

"E séria, fitou em mim os olhos, convidando-me ao jogo. O susto é naturalmente sério; eu estava ainda sob a ação do que trouxe a entrada de Pádua, e não fui capaz de rir, por mais que devesse fazê-lo, para legitimar a resposta de Capitu. Esta, cansada de esperar, desviou o rosto, dizendo que eu não ria daquela vez por estar ao pé do pai. E nem assim ri. Há cousas que só se aprendem tarde; é mister nascer com elas para fazê-las cedo. E melhor é naturalmente cedo que artificialmente tarde. Capitu, após duas voltas, foi ter com a mãe, que continuava à porta da casa, deixando-nos a mim e ao pai encantados dela; o pai, olhando para ela e para mim, dizia-me, cheio de ternura:","And serious, she looked me in the eyes, inviting me to the game. Fright is naturally serious; I was still under the influence of what had brought Padua's entry, and I was not able to laugh, as much as I should have, to legitimize Capitu's answer. This one, tired of waiting, averted her face, saying that I wasn't laughing that time because I was next to her father. And not even that laughs. There are things that are learned only late; it is necessary to be born with them to make them early. It is better naturally early than artificially late. Capitu, after two rounds, went to her mother, who was still at the door of the house, leaving me and her father enchanted by her; her father, looking at her and me, said to me, full of tenderness:","With a serious face she stared at me, to make me join the game. A fright, however, makes one serious: I was still under the effect of the shock brought on by Pádua’s entry on the scene, and I was incapable of laughing, however much I should have done so to corroborate Capitu. Tired of waiting, she turned her face away, saying that I couldn’t laugh that time because he was there. Even then I didn’t laugh. There are things which can only be learned late in life; to do them early on you have to be born with the talent. Even then, it is better to learn naturally early on, rather than late and artificially. Capitu, after two attempts, went to her mother, who was still at the back door, leaving me and her father full of admiration; looking at her and at me, he said, tenderly:","With a serious face she fixed her eyes on mine, inviting me to play. But I had had a severe shock, and, being still under the influence of what had brought Pádua into the yard, I was quite incapable of laughing, no matter how necessary it was to justify Capitu’s answer. Tired of waiting, she looked away, saying that I couldn’t laugh that time because her father was near. Even then I didn’t laugh. There are things that one learns only late in life. In order to practise them early it is necessary to be born with them; and better still to do so early and naturally than late and artificially. After a couple of turns in the yard Capitu went to speak to her mother, who was still standing at the back door, leaving her father and me lost in admiration. Her father, looking at her and then at me, said tenderly, ‘Who would think that girl is only fourteen?"

Era um grande e belo mundo, a vida uma carreira excelente, e eu nem mais nem menos um mimoso do céu; eis a minha sensação. Nota que eu não lhe disse tudo, nem o melhor; não lhe referi o capítulo do penteado, por exemplo, nem outros assim; mas o contado era muito.","You can't imagine the pleasure I was given by the confidence I gave you. It was like one more happiness. That young heart that listened to me and gave me reason, brought an extraordinary aspect to this world. It was a great and beautiful world, life an excellent career, and I was neither more nor less a sweetheart from heaven; here's my feeling. Note that I have not told you everything, not even the best; I didn't mention the hairstyling chapter, for example, or others like that; but the story was too much.","You can’t imagine the pleasure that I got from confiding this secret. It was one happiness on top of another. That youthful heart that listened to me and approved of my plans, gave the world an extraordinary new aspect. It was grand and beautiful, life was a wonderful race to be run, and I no more nor less than the darling of heaven; that was the sensation I had. And note that I didn’t tell him everything, nor yet the best of it ; I didn’t tell him the story of combing her hair, for example, nor others like it; but I did tell him a great deal.","You have no idea how happy that confession made me. It brought me new happiness. The lad who listened to me and gave me his approval completely changed my view of the world. I felt that his world was immense and beautiful, life a marvellous adventure and I myself nothing less than one of the blessed of heaven. And note that I didn’t tell him everything, even leaving out the best details. I said nothing about the hairdressing incident, for example, and other things, too, I omitted, though I told him a great deal."

"Inventariei as lembranças de Escobar, livros, um tinteiro de bronze, uma bengala de marfim, um pássaro, o álbum de Capitu, duas paisagens do Paraná e outras. Também ele as possuía de minha mão. Vivemos assim a trocar memórias e regalos, ora em dia de anos, ora sem razão particular. Tudo isso me empanava os olhos… Vieram os jornais do dia: davam notícia do desastre e da morte de Escobar, os estudos e os negócios deste, as qualidades pessoais, a simpatia do comércio, e também falavam dos bens deixados, da mulher e da filha. Tudo isso foi na segunda-feira. Na terça-feira foi aberto o testamento, que me nomeava segundo testamenteiro; o primeiro lugar cabia à mulher. Não me deixava nada, mas as palavras que me escrevera em carta separada eram sublimes de amizade e estima. Capitu desta vez chorou muito; mas compôs-se depressa.","I made an inventory of Escobar's memories, books, a bronze inkwell, an ivory cane, a bird, Capitu's album, two landscapes of Paraná and others. He also had them from my hand. We live like this exchanging memories and gifts, sometimes on birthdays, sometimes for no particular reason. All this blurred my eyes... The newspapers of the day came: they reported on the disaster and death of Escobar, his studies and business, his personal qualities, the friendliness of the trade, and they also spoke of the goods left, of his wife and daughter. All this was on Monday. On Tuesday the will was opened, appointing me second executor; the first place belonged to the woman. He left me nothing, but the words he had written to me in a separate letter were sublime in friendship and esteem. Capitu this time cried a lot; but it composed quickly.","I made a list of the gifts I had received from Escobar, books, a bronze inkwell, a walking stick with an ivory top, a bird, Capitu’s album, two landscapes of Paraná and other things. He had also had some from me. We often exchanged presents and keepsakes in this way, on birthdays or for no particular reason. All this made my eyes mist over … Then the daily papers came; they gave the news of the accident and Escobar’s death, his education and commercial activities, his personal qualities, the condolences of the business community, and spoke, too, of his estate, of his wife and daughter. All this was on the Monday. On Tuesday the will was opened, and it named me second executor; the first was his wife. He left me nothing, but the words he had written to me in a separate letter were a sublime expression of friendship and esteem. This time, Capitu wept a great deal; but she composed herself quickly.","I made a list of my mementoes of Escobar – books, a bronze inkwell, an ivory walking-stick, a bird, Capitu’s album, two landscapes of Parana and other things. He also had things of mine. We had always been like that, exchanging keepsakes and presents at birthdays or for no particular reason. My eyes misted over. The newspapers arrived; they gave accounts of the tragedy, Escobar’s death, his studies and business affairs, his personal qualities, the sympathy of his colleagues, and they also mentioned the estate he had left and his wife and daughter. That was on the Monday. On Tuesday his will was opened, and I found myself nominated second executor, the first being his wife. He left me nothing, but the words he wrote in a separate letter were a monument of affection and respect. This time Capitu shed copious tears, but she soon recovered."
"Enxuguei os olhos, posto que de todas as palavras de José Dias uma só me ficasse no coração; foi aquele gravíssimo. Vi depois que ele só queria dizer grave, mas o uso do superlativo faz a boca longa, e, por amor do período, José Dias fez crescer a minha tristeza. Se achares neste livro algum caso da mesma família, avisa-me, leitor, para que o emende na segunda edição; nada há mais feio que dar pernas longuíssimas a ideias brevíssimas. Enxuguei os olhos, repito, e fui andando, ansioso agora por chegar a casa, e pedir perdão a minha mãe do ruim pensamento que tive. Enfim, chegamos, entramos, subi trêmulo os seis degraus da escada, e daí a pouco, debruçado sobre a cama, ouvia as palavras ternas de minha mãe que me apertava muito as mãos, chamando-me seu filho. Estava queimando, os olhos ardiam nos meus, toda ela parecia consumida por um vulcão interno. Ajoelhei-me ao pé do leito, mas como este era alto, fiquei longe das suas carícias:","I wiped my eyes, since of all José Dias' words, only one remained in my heart; it was that serious. I saw later that he only meant serious, but the use of the superlative makes the mouth long, and, for the sake of the period, José Dias made my sadness grow. If you find in this book any case of the same family, let me know, reader, so that I can amend it in the second edition; There is nothing uglier than giving very long legs to very brief ideas. I wiped my eyes, I repeat, and walked, anxious now to get home, and ask my mother's forgiveness for the bad thought I had. Finally, we arrived, entered, I climbed the six steps of the stairs, trembling, and after a while, leaning over the bed, I heard the tender words of my mother who squeezed my hands a lot, calling me her son. She was burning, her eyes were burning into mine, her whole body seemed to be consumed by an internal volcano. I knelt at the foot of the bed, but as it was tall, I stayed away from its caresses:","I dried my eyes, although the only word that had remained in my heart from what José Dias had said was gravest. Afterwards, I saw that he had only wanted to say grave, but the use of the superlative stretches things out, and for the love of a phrase, José Dias increased my misery. If you find anything similar in this book, dear reader, let me know, so that I can correct it in the second edition: there’s nothing worse than giving the longest of legs to the shortest of ideas. I dried my eyes, as I say, and went on, anxious now to get home, and ask my mother’s pardon for the wicked thought I had had. Finally, we arrived, went in , I went trembling up the six steps, and soon, leaning over the bed, I heard my mother’s tender words as she clasped my hands, calling me her son. She seemed to be on fire, and her eyes burned in mine; her whole being seemed consumed by a volcano inside her. I knelt by the bed, but as it was high, I was far from her caresses:","I dried my eyes, though of all the expressions used by José Dias one alone pierced me to the heart: it was that ‘most seriously’. I realized later that he meant only ‘seriously’, but the use of the superlative added sonority, and for the sake of effect José Dias aggravated my misery. If you find examples of a similar nature in this book, dear reader, please let me know so that I can correct them in the second edition. There is nothing worse than giving the longest of legs to the smallest of ideas. I repeat, I dried my eyes and walked on, by now anxious to reach home and beg pardon of my mother for my wicked thoughts. We arrived at last, walked in, climbed with trepidation the six steps of the staircase, and before long I was leaning over the bed and listening to the tender words of my mother as she squeezed my hands, calling me her son. She was as if on fire, her eyes burning into mine, her whole body consumed by a furnace raging within her. I fell to my knees beside the bed, but since it was high I was out of reach of her caresses."

"— Já, já, não, mas eu hei de avisar você para tossir, quando for preciso, aos poucos, uma tossezinha seca, e algum fastio; eu irei preparando a excelentíssima… Oh! Tudo isto é em benefício dela. Uma vez que o filho não pode servir a Igreja, como deve ser servida, o melhor modo de cumprir a vontade de Deus é dedicá-lo a outra cousa. O mundo também é igreja para os bons…","— No, no, no, but I'll warn you to cough, when you need it, little by little, a dry cough, and some boredom; I will prepare the most excellent… Oh!

This world too is a church for the righteous …","‘No, no, not now. I’m saying it would be a good idea for you to give a little cough occasionally, a dry, irritating cough. Meanwhile I’ll prepare your dear mother. Oh, it’s all for her own good. Since her son cannot serve the Church as it ought to be served, the best way to fulfil God’s will is to dedicate him to something else. For the virtuous the world, too, is a church …’"
"Pela cara de José Dias passou algo parecido com o reflexo de uma ideia, — uma ideia que o alegrou extraordinariamente. Calou-se alguns instantes; eu tinha os olhos nele, ele voltara os seus para o lado da barra. Como insistisse:","Something like the reflection of an idea passed over José Dias' face — an idea that made him extraordinarily happy. He was silent for a few moments; I had my eyes on him, he had turned his eyes to the side of the bar. As I insisted:","Over José Dias’ face there passed something like the flash of an idea—an idea that made him extraordinarily happy. He went silent for a few moments; my eyes were fixed on him, and his had turned towards the entrance to the bay. When I pressed the point:","The glimmering of an idea seemed to flicker over José Dias’s face – an idea which brought him considerable pleasure. I was watching him closely. At first he said nothing but turned and gazed out over the bay. Then, when I insisted, he said, ‘It’s too late."

"Quando voltamos, à noite, viemos por ali a pé, falando das minhas dúvidas. Capitu novamente me aconselhou que esperássemos. Sogras eram todas assim; lá vinha um dia e mudavam. Ao passo que me falava, recrudescia de ternura. Dali em diante foi cada vez mais doce comigo; não me ia esperar à janela, para não espertar-me os ciúmes, mas quando eu subia, via no alto da escada, entre as grades da cancela, a cara deliciosa da minha amiga e esposa, risonha como toda a nossa infância. Ezequiel às vezes estava com ela; nós o havíamos acostumado a ver o ósculo da chegada e da saída, e ele enchia-me a cara de beijos.","When we came back in the evening, we came by on foot, talking about my doubts. Capitu again advised me to wait. Mothers-in-law were all like that; one day they would come and change. As he spoke to me, he increased with tenderness. From then on he was sweeter and sweeter to me; He wasn't going to wait for me at the window, so as not to make me jealous, but when I went up, I saw at the top of the stairs, between the bars of the gate, the delicious face of my friend and wife, smiling like all our childhood. Ezekiel was sometimes with her; we had used him to see the kiss of arrival and departure, and he would shower my face with kisses.","When we came back home, at night, we went on foot, and spoke of my doubts. Again Capitu told me we should wait. All mothers-in-law are like that; there comes a day when they change. As she talked to me, her tenderness grew. Thenceforth, she was more and more affectionate with me; she didn’t wait for me at the window, so as not to awaken my jealousy, but as I was going in, I saw at the top of the steps, through the gate, the delightful face of my wife and companion, as full of laughter as it had been all through our childhood. Sometimes Ezequiel was with her; we had accustomed him to seeing the kiss we gave when I left for work and when I came back, and he would cover my face with kisses.","Walking home that night we again discussed my doubts, and Capitu again advised patience. All mothers-in-law were like that; then came a day and everything was changed. As she spoke she became increasingly tender. From that time on she was ever more loving towards me; she did not wait for me at the window so as not to arouse my jealousy, but whenever I came in, there at the top of the steps, between the rails of the gate, I would see the sweet face of my friend and wife, as radiant as during our childhood. Sometimes Ezequiel would be with her; we had accustomed him to our welcoming and farewell kisses, and he, too, would smother my face with his own."
"Ele, com os olhos no ar, devia estar ouvindo, e naturalmente ouvia, mas só me disse uma palavra, e ainda assim depois de algum tempo de silêncio, recolhendo os olhos e um suspiro!","He, with his eyes in the air, must have been listening, and of course he did, but he only said a word to me, and even then after some time of silence, withdrawing his eyes and a sigh!","Staring into space, he must have been listening, and of course heard what I had said, but he only said one thing, and even that after staying silent for a while: he brought his eyes back into focus and sighed:","With his eyes staring into space, he seemed to be listening – and probably he was – though he made only one remark after a considerable silence; he refocused and sighed, ‘It was a success, this Panegyric of mine.’"

He even showed regret, and left; I then, in order not to be caught, left the corner and ran to the balcony. But, let it be, he pays me!","I only heard them telling her not to cry, that it was nothing to cry about … He even said he regretted what he’d said, and went out; that was when I left the corner and ran to the verandah, so as not to be seen. But you wait and see, he’ll pay me for this!”","‘I don’t know. I just heard them telling her not to cry, that it wasn’t a matter for tears.

"Ezequiel, quando começou o capítulo anterior, não era ainda gerado; quando acabou era cristão e católico.

"Sentou-se. “Vamos ver o grande cabeleireiro”, disse-me rindo. Continuei a alisar os cabelos, com muito cuidado, e dividi-os em duas porções iguais, para compor as duas tranças. Não as fiz logo, nem assim depressa, como podem supor os cabeleireiros de ofício, mas devagar, devagarinho, saboreando pelo tato aqueles fios grossos, que eram parte dela. O trabalho era atrapalhado, às vezes por desazo, outras de propósito para desfazer o feito e refazê-lo. Os dedos roçavam na nuca da pequena ou nas espáduas vestidas de chita, e a sensação era um deleite. Mas, enfim, os cabelos iam acabando, por mais que eu os quisesse intermináveis. Não pedi ao céu que eles fossem tão longos como os da Aurora, porque não conhecia ainda esta divindade que os velhos poetas me apresentaram depois; mas, desejei penteá-los por todos os séculos dos séculos, tecer duas tranças que pudessem envolver o infinito por um número inominável de vezes. Se isto vos parecer enfático, desgraçado leitor, é que nunca penteastes uma pequena, nunca pusestes as mãos adolescentes na jovem cabeça de uma ninfa… Uma ninfa! Todo eu estou mitológico. Ainda há pouco, falando dos seus olhos de ressaca, cheguei a escrever Tétis; risquei Tétis, risquemos ninfa; digamos somente uma criatura amada, palavra que envolve todas as potências cristãs e pagãs. Enfim, acabei as duas tranças. Onde estava a fita para atar-lhes as pontas? Em cima da mesa, um triste pedaço de fita enxovalhada. Juntei as pontas das tranças, uni-as por um laço, retoquei a obra alargando aqui, achatando ali, até que exclamei:","Sat down. “Let's see the big hairdresser”, he told me, laughing. I continued to straighten my hair, very carefully, and divided it into two equal portions, to compose the two braids. I didn't do them right away, not even that quickly, as professional hairdressers might suppose, but slowly, slowly, tasting those thick strands that were part of her. The work was disturbed, sometimes out of spite, sometimes on purpose to undo the deed and redo it. His fingers brushed the back of the little girl's neck or her calico-clad shoulders, and the sensation was a delight. But anyway, the hair was running out, as much as I wanted it to be endless. I didn't ask the sky to make them as long as those of Aurora, because I didn't yet know this divinity that the old poets presented to me later; but, I wanted to comb them through all the centuries of the centuries, to weave two braids that could wrap infinity an innumerable number of times. If this seems emphatic to you, unfortunate reader, it's that you've never combed a little girl's hair, you've never laid your adolescent hands on a young nymph's head... A nymph! I'm all mythological. Just now, speaking of your hungover eyes, I even wrote Thetis; I crossed out Thetis, let's cross out nymph; let us say only a beloved creature, a word that involves all Christian and pagan powers. Finally, I finished the two braids. Where was the ribbon to tie the ends? On the table, a sad piece of soiled tape. I joined the ends of the braids, tied them together with a bow, touched up the work, widening it here, flattening it there, until I exclaimed:","She sat down. “Let’s see the great hairdresser,” she said with a laugh. I went on smoothing out her hair, very carefully, and divided it into two equal parts, to make the two plaits. I didn’t make them straight away, or as fast as a professional hairdresser might imagine: slowly, very slowly, I enjoyed the feel of those thick strands, which were a part of her. I did the work clumsily, sometimes out of sheer ineptitude, at others deliberately, so as to undo what I had done and do it again. My fingers brushed her neck, or her back with its cotton dress: it was á delicious sensation. But in the end, however interminable I wanted this to be, I ran out of hair. I didn’t ask the heavens for the strands to be as long as Aurora’s, because I was as yet unfamiliar with this goddess who was later introduced to me by the poets; but I did want to comb them for ever and ever, weaving two braids that would envelop infinity an unnamable number of times. If all this seems a little emphatic, irritating reader, it’s because you have never combed a girl ’s hair , you’ve never put your adolescent hands on the young head of a nymph … A nymph! I’ve become all mythological. A little while ago, talking about her undertow eyes, I even wrote “Thetis”*; I crossed out Thetis, let’s cross out nymph; let’s say only a beloved creature, which is a word which embraces all the powers, pagan and Christian. In the end, I finished the two braids. Where was the ribbon to tie their ends together? On the table, a miserable little piece of crumpled material. I tied the ends of the braids, joined them with a bow, gave the work some final touches, stretching it out here, smoothing it there. Then I exclaimed:","She sat down. ‘Now we shall see the famous hairdresser,’ she said, with a laugh. I went on combing her hair with the utmost care, dividing it into two parts to form the two plaits. I did not do this all at once, or quickly as professional hairdressers might suppose, but slowly and deliberately, savouring the touch of those threads that were a part of her. It was clumsily performed, sometimes through carelessness, at others on purpose so that I could undo what had been done and redo it. My fingers brushed her neck or the cotton frock that covered her shoulders, giving me a sensation of pure delight. But no matter how much I wished it interminable, her hair ended. I did not pray to heaven to make it as long as that of Aurora because I was as yet unacquainted with that divinity, to whom the old poets introduced me later in life. But I wanted to go on combing it for centuries on end, to weave two plaits that would enclose eternity in an infinite number of coils. If you find this too exaggerated, unhappy reader, it is because you have never combed a young girl’s hair, never placed your adolescent hands on the youthful head of a nymph … A nymph! I’m completely given up to mythology. Just now, speaking of her whirlpool eyes, I even wrote ‘Thetis’. I crossed out ‘Thetis’, so let us cross out ‘nymph’, too. We’ll merely say a beloved creature, a word that includes every power, both Christian and pagan. Finally I finished the two plaits. Where was the ribbon to tie the ends together? There on the table was a miserable piece of crumpled silk. I joined the ends of the plaits, tied them together with a bow, put the final touches to my work, plumping it out here, flattening it there, and then said, ‘It’s finished.’"

"Fui devagar, mas ou o pé ou o espelho traiu-me. Este pode ser que não fosse; era um espelhinho de pataca (perdoai a barateza), comprado a um mascate italiano, moldura tosca, argolinha de latão, pendente da parede, entre as duas janelas. Se não foi ele, foi o pé. Um ou outro, a verdade é que, apenas entrei na sala, pente, cabelos, toda ela voou pelos ares, e só lhe ouvi esta pergunta:","I went slowly, but either the foot or the mirror betrayed me. This one may not have been; it was a little pataca mirror (pardon the cheapness), bought from an Italian peddler, crude frame, small brass ring, hanging on the wall between the two windows. If it wasn't him, it was the foot. One or the other, the truth is, I just entered the room, comb, hair, all of it flew through the air, and I only heard this question:","I did as I was told, but either my footsteps or the mirror gave me away. It may not have been the latter; it was a twopenny mirror (with apologies for the cheapness), bought from an Italian pedlar, with a rough frame, hanging by a brass ring between the two windows. If it wasn’t that, it was my footsteps. Whichever it was, hardly had I entered the room when comb, hair, all of her flew up in the air, and all I heard was this question:","I crept in, but either my feet or the mirror betrayed me. It probably wasn’t the latter, which was a little twopenny mirror (pardon its cheapness) bought from an Italian pedlar, with a rough frame and a tin hook, hanging on the wall between the two windows. If it wasn’t that it was my feet. Whichever it was, the truth is that I had barely entered the room when comb, hair, the girl herself flew into the air"

"Quem era a flor? Capitu, naturalmente; mas podia ser a virtude, a poesia, a religião, qualquer outro conceito a que coubesse a metáfora da flor, e flor do céu. Aguardei o resto, recitando sempre o verso, e deitado ora sobre o lado direito, ora sobre o esquerdo; afinal deixei-me estar de costas, com os olhos no teto, mas nem assim vinha mais nada. Então adverti que os sonetos mais gabados eram os que concluíam com chave de ouro, isto é, um desses versos capitais no sentido e na forma. Pensei em forjar uma de tais chaves, considerando que o verso final, saindo cronologicamente dos treze anteriores, com dificuldade traria a perfeição louvada; imaginei que tais chaves eram fundidas antes da fechadura. Assim foi que me determinei a compor o último verso do soneto, e, depois de muito suar, saiu este:","Who was the flower? Capitu, naturally; but it could be virtue, poetry, religion, any other concept that could fit the metaphor of the flower, and flower of the sky. I waited for the rest, always reciting the verse, and lying now on my right side, now on my left; finally I lay on my back, with my eyes on the ceiling, but even then nothing else came. Then I noticed that the most praised sonnets were those that concluded with a golden key, that is, one of those verses that were capital in terms of meaning and form. I thought of forging such a key, considering that the final verse, chronologically departing from the previous thirteen, would hardly bring the praised perfection; I imagined that such keys were melted before the lock. So it was that I determined to compose the last verse of the sonnet, and, after much sweating, this came out:","Who was the flower? Capitu, of course; but it could be virtue, poetry, religion, any other concept that would fit the metaphor of flower, and flower of heaven. I waited for the rest, reciting the line over and over, lying now on my left side, now on my right; finally, I lay on my back, with my eyes on the ceiling; even so, nothing more came. Then I remarked that the most lauded sonnets were those that ended with a “golden key,” that is, with one of those lines that sum everything up, in their meaning and their form. I thought of inventing one of these lines, thinking that the final line, if it were composed in order, after the thirteen previous ones, would be unlikely to display such perfection; I imagined that such keys were made before the lock. Thus it was that I decided to compose the last line of the sonnet, and after a great deal of sweating, out came this:","What was the flower? Capitu, of course; but it could be virtue, poetry, religion, any other concept that would fit the metaphor of ‘flower’ and ‘flower of heaven’ I waited for the rest, reciting the line over and over, first on my right side, then on the left; finally I lay on my back with my eyes fixed on the ceiling. Even in this position nothing more came. Then it dawned on me that the most highly extolled sonnets were those that ended with a ‘golden key’, that is, with one of those lines that sum up everything in their meaning and form. I decided to forge such a key, for, I reflected, if the final line came forth after the preceding thirteen one could scarcely expect it to have the approved perfection. I imagined that such keys were made before the lock. Thus it was that I determined to compose the last line of the sonnet, and after much sweating this emerged:"
"Não a matei por não ter à mão ferro nem corda, pistola nem punhal; mas os olhos que lhe deitei, se pudessem matar, teriam suprido tudo. Um dos erros da Providência foi deixar ao homem unicamente os braços e os dentes, como armas de ataque, e as pernas como armas de fuga ou de defesa. Os olhos bastavam ao primeiro efeito. Um mover deles faria parar ou cair um inimigo ou um rival, exerceriam vingança pronta, com este acréscimo que, para desnortear a justiça, os mesmos olhos matadores seriam olhos piedosos, e correriam a chorar a vítima. Prima Justina escapou aos meus; eu é que não escapei ao efeito da insinuação, e no domingo, às onze horas, corri à rua dos Inválidos.","I didn't kill her because I didn't have iron or rope, pistol or dagger at hand; but the eyes that I cast him, if they could kill, would have supplied everything. One of the mistakes of Providence was to leave to man only the arms and teeth, as weapons of attack, and the legs as weapons of escape or defense. The eyes were enough for the first effect. A move by them would stop or fall an enemy or a rival, they would exercise ready revenge, with this addition that, to bewilder justice, the same murderous eyes would be pitying eyes, and they would run to weep for the victim. Cousin Justina escaped mine; it was I who did not escape the effect of the insinuation, and on Sunday, at eleven o'clock, I ran to Rua dos Invalidos.","I didn’t kill her because I didn’t have steel or cord, a pistol or a dagger at hand; but the look I gave her, if it could have killed, would have made up for all these things. One of the mistakes of Providence was to have given men only their arms and teeth as offensive weapons, and their legs as means of flight or defense. For the first of these, the eyes should be enough. A single movement of them would make an enemy or a rival stop or fall to the ground, they would carry out swift vengeance, with the added advantage that, to delude justice, these same murderous eyes would be full of mercy, and would make haste to weep for the victim. Cousin Justina escaped mine; but I did not escape from the effect of her insinuation, and on Sunday at eleven, I ran to the Rua dos Inválidos.","I didn’t kill her because I didn’t have handy either steel or cord, pistol or dagger, but the look I threw at her, if it could have killed, would have made up for their lack. One of Providence’s errors is to have given man only his arms and his teeth as weapons of attack and his legs as a means of flight or defence. For the first his eyes ought to be sufficient. One glance from them would halt or fell an enemy or rival and would execute prompt vengeance, with the additional advantage that, to circumvent justice, those same lethal eyes could become tender and hasten to weep for the victim. Cousin Justina escaped from mine, but I did not escape from the effect of her insinuation, and at eleven o’clock on Sunday I ran to the Rua dos Invalidos."
"— Se eu disser a mesma cousa, retorquiu ele sorrindo, perde a graça; parece que estou repetindo. Mas a verdade é que não tenho aqui relações com ninguém, você é o primeiro e creio que já notaram; mas eu não me importo com isso.","—If I say the same thing, he retorted with a smile, it loses the fun; I seem to be repeating. But the truth is that I don't have relationships with anyone here, you are the first and I believe they have already noticed; but I don't care about that.","“If I say the same thing,” he replied with a smile, “it won’t seem so spontaneous; it’ll look as if I’m repeating you. But it’s true that here I have no intimate friends , you are the first, and I think they have already noticed; but that doesn’t matter to me.”","‘If I tell you the same thing,’ he answered with a smile, ‘it won’t sound so good; it will seem as if I am just repeating your words. But it’s true – here I have made friends with no one. You are the first, and I think they have noticed it, but that doesn’t worry me.’"
"Sorriu vexado, e respondeu-me que as mulheres eram criaturas tão da moda e do dia que nunca haviam de entender uma ruína de trinta séculos. Eram dous colegas da universidade. Prometi-lhe recursos, e dei-lhe logo os primeiros dinheiros precisos. Comigo disse que uma das consequências dos amores furtivos do pai era pagar eu as arqueologias do filho; antes lhe pagasse a lepra… Quando esta ideia me atravessou o cérebro, senti-me tão cruel e perverso que peguei no rapaz, e quis apertá-lo ao coração, mas recuei; encarei-o depois, como se faz a um filho de verdade; os olhos que ele me deitou foram ternos e agradecidos.","He smiled vexedly, and replied that women were creatures so fashionable and of the day that they would never understand a ruin of thirty centuries. They were two colleagues from the university. I promised him resources, and I immediately gave him the first necessary monies. He said to me that one of the consequences of his father's furtive love affairs was that I had to pay for his son's archeologies; I would rather pay him for leprosy... When this idea crossed my mind, I felt so cruel and perverse that I took hold of the boy, and wanted to hold him to my heart, but I recoiled; I looked at him afterwards, as one does with a real child; the eyes he gave me were tender and grateful.","He smiled embarrassed, and answered that women were such creatures of fashion and of the present moment, that they would never understand a ruin thirty centuries old. They were two fellow students from the university. I promised him resources, and immediately gave him an advance on the money he needed. To myself I said that one of the consequences of the secret loves of the father was that I was paying for the son’s archaeology; I’d rather have paid for a dose of leprosy … When this idea passed through my brain, I felt so cruel and perverse that I took hold of the lad, and went to embrace him to my heart, but I retreated; then I looked at him, as one does a real son; the look he gave me was tender and grateful.","He smiled but looked annoyed and replied that women were creatures of fashion, so wrapped up in the present that they could never understand a ruin thirty centuries old. They were two university friends. I promised him money and later gave him the necessary funds. To myself I said that one of the consequences of his father’s furtive love affairs was that I should pay for his son to become an archaeologist ; I’d rather he became a leper … No sooner did this thought enter my head than I felt so cruel and perverse that I seized him and would have hugged him to me, but I held back. I gazed at him as one would one’s own son, and the look he gave me was one of tenderness and gratitude."

"Leitor, houve aqui um gesto que eu não descrevo por havê-lo inteiramente esquecido, mas crê que foi belo e trágico. Efetivamente, a figura do pequeno fez-me recuar até dar de costas na estante. Ezequiel abraçou-me os joelhos, esticou-se na ponta dos pés, como querendo subir e dar-me o beijo do costume; e repetia, puxando-me:","Reader, there was a gesture here that I do not describe because I have completely forgotten it, but you believe it was beautiful and tragic. Indeed, the figure of the little one made me back up until my back was against the bookcase. Ezekiel embraced my knees, stretched out on tiptoe, as if wanting to go up and give me the usual kiss; and repeated, pulling me:","Reader, at this point there was a gesture that I won’t describe because I’ve completely forgotten it, but believe me that it was beautiful and tragic. For the figure of the boy made me retreat until I backed into the bookcase. Ezequiel hugged my knees, stood up on the tips of his toes, as if to climb up and give me his usual kiss; and he repeated, tugging at me:","Reader, at this point something happened that I shall not describe since I have completely forgotten it, though it must have been both beautiful and tragic. At the boy’s entrance I retreated until my back was against the bookcase. Ezequiel hugged my knees and stretched up on his toes as if wanting to climb up and give me his customary kiss. He went on tugging at me and repeating, ‘Papa!"

"Capitu, a princípio não disse nada. Recolheu os olhos, meteu-os em si e deixou-se estar com as pupilas vagas e surdas, a boca entreaberta, toda parada. Então eu, para dar força às afirmações, comecei a jurar que não seria padre. Naquele tempo jurava muito e rijo, pela vida e pela morte. Jurei pela hora da morte. Que a luz me faltasse na hora da morte se fosse para o seminário. Capitu não parecia crer nem descrer, não parecia sequer ouvir; era uma figura de pau. Quis chamá-la, sacudi-la, mas faltou-me ânimo. Essa criatura que brincara comigo, que pulara, dançara, creio até que dormira comigo, deixava-me agora com os braços atados e medrosos. Enfim, tornou a si, mas tinha a cara lívida, e rompeu nestas palavras furiosas:","Capitu, at first said nothing. He withdrew his eyes, put them to himself and remained with the pupils vacant and deaf, the mouth half-open, completely still. So, to give strength to the statements, I began to swear that I would not be a priest. At that time I swore a lot and sternly, by life and by death. I swore by the hour of death. That the light would fail me at the time of death if I went to the seminary. Capitu didn't seem to believe or disbelieve, didn't even seem to hear; it was a stick figure. I wanted to call out to her, shake her, but I didn't have the courage. This creature that had played with me, that had jumped, danced, I think even slept with me, now left me with my arms tied and afraid. Finally, he came to his senses, but his face was livid, and broke into these furious words:","Capitu at first said nothing. She withdrew her eyes, turned them inwards, and stayed that way, with her pupils vague and sightless, her mouth half open, stock still. Then, to back up what I had said, I began to swear that I would never be a priest. In those days I swore a great deal, each oath more extreme than the last, even by life and death. I swore by the hour of my death. Let the light be taken from me at the hour of my death if I went to the seminary. Capitu seemed neither to believe or disbelieve me: she seemed not even to hear me; it was as if she were made of wood. I wanted to speak to her, to shake her, but I hadn’t the courage. This girl who had been my playmate, jumping around and dancing—I think she’d even slept in the same bed—now left me with my arms paralyzed and afraid. Finally, she came back from her trance, but her face was livid, and she broke out with these furious words:","At first Capitu said nothing. She withdrew her gaze from me and remained still, her eyes expressionless, her mouth half open. Then, to give greater force to my protestations, I swore to her that I would not be a priest. In those days it was the custom to swear up hill and down dale, by one’s life and by one’s death. I swore by the hour of my death that at the moment of my death the light would be taken from me if I went to the seminary. Capitu seemed neither to believe nor disbelieve me; she seemed not even to hear me but stood there like a block. The girl who had played with me, who had jumped and danced and I even think had slept with me, left me now helpless and half scared. Finally she recovered her composure, but her face was livid, and she spat out furiously, ‘Sanctimonious simpleton!"
— Coitado de Manduca!,— Poor Manduca!,“Poor Manduca!”,"Before passing through, just as I had remembered the words of the dead boy’s father, I now heard those of his mother, and I murmured them to myself: ‘Poor Manduca!’"
"Agora é que o lance é o mesmo; mas se conto aqui, tais quais, os dous lances de há quarenta anos, é para mostrar que Capitu não se dominava só em presença da mãe; o pai não lhe meteu mais medo. No meio de uma situação que me atava a língua, usava da palavra com a maior ingenuidade deste mundo. A minha persuasão é que o coração não lhe batia mais nem menos. Alegou susto, e deu à cara um ar meio enfiado; mas eu, que sabia tudo, vi que era mentira e fiquei com inveja. Foi logo falar ao pai, que apertou a minha mão, e quis saber por que a filha falava em protonotário apostólico. Capitu repetiu-lhe o que ouvira de mim, e opinou logo que o pai devia ir cumprimentar o padre em casa dele; ela iria à minha. E coligindo os petrechos da costura, enfiou pelo corredor, bradando infantilmente:","Now the bid is the same; but if I recount the two moves from forty years ago, as they were, it is to show that Capitu did not dominate herself only in the presence of her mother; his father no longer scared him. In the midst of a situation that tied my tongue, I used the word with the greatest naivety in the world. My persuasion is that her heart didn't beat more or less. He claimed to be frightened, and gave his face a half-shrugged look; but I, who knew everything, saw that it was a lie and was jealous. He immediately went to speak to his father, who shook my hand, and wanted to know why his daughter spoke in protonotary apostolic. Capitu repeated to him what he had heard from me, and immediately suggested that his father should go and greet the priest at his house; she would go to mine. And gathering up her sewing supplies, she went down the hall, crying childishly:","Now the scene is the same as the previous one; but if I recount here, after forty years, the twin situations just as they happened, it is to show that Capitu was not only able to control herself in her mother’s presence; she was no more afraid of her father. In the midst of a crisis which left me tongue-tied, she expressed herself as innocently as could be. I am persuaded that her heart beat no faster or slower. She said she had been startled, and put on a rather annoyed look; but I, who knew what had happened, saw it was a pretence and felt envious. She went to greet her father, who shook my hand and wanted to know why his daughter was talking about protonotaries apostolic. Capitu repeated to him what she had heard from me, and immediately expressed the opinion that he ought to go and congratulate the priest at his house; she would go to mine. And so, gathering her sewing things, she ran down the corridor, shouting like a child:","Her performance was the same as before, and if I describe them both here after an interval of forty years, it is to show that Capitu could control herself not only in the presence of her mother but that her father inspired no greater fear. In a situation that left me tongue-tied, she could converse with the most disarming innocence. I am convinced that her heart beat neither faster nor slower. She claimed she had had a fright and assumed a slightly shocked expression; but I, who knew the truth, saw that it was a sham and could only feel envious. I went up to her father, who shook me by the hand and wanted to know why his daughter was talking about an apostolic protonotary. Capitu repeated what I had told her, saying that she thought he should go and congratulate the priest in his own house; she would do so in mine. So saying, she gathered up her sewing things and ran into the corridor, crying out in a childish manner, ‘Mamma, let’s have dinner."
"Nos dias seguintes, continuou a entrar e sair de casa, cosido à parede, cara no chão. Não era o mesmo homem que estragava o chapéu em cortejar a vizinhança, risonho, olhos no ar, antes mesmo da administração interina. Vieram as semanas, a ferida foi sarando. Pádua começou a interessar-se pelos negócios domésticos, a cuidar dos passarinhos, a dormir tranquilo as noites e as tardes, a conversar e dar notícias da rua. A serenidade regressou; atrás dela veio a alegria, um domingo, na figura de dous amigos, que iam jogar o solo, a tentos. Já ele ria, já brincava, tinha o ar do costume; a ferida sarou de todo.","Over the next few days, he continued to walk in and out of the house, sewn to the wall, face down. He was not the same man who spoiled his hat in courting the neighborhood, smiling, eyes in the air, even before the interim administration. The weeks came, the wound was healing. Padua began to take an interest in domestic affairs, taking care of the birds, sleeping peacefully at night and in the afternoon, talking and giving news from the street. Serenity returned; behind her came joy, one Sunday, in the figure of two friends, who were going to play the soil, trying to play. Already he was laughing, already joking, he had the usual air; the wound has completely healed.","On the next few days, he went in and out of the house, as if he were trying to hide, and with his eyes on the ground. He was not the same man who wore his hat out greeting the neighbors, smiling, looking straight ahead of him, even before the temporary directorship. As the weeks went by, the wound began to heal. Pádua began to take an interest in the home again, to look after his birds, to sleep well at night and during the siesta, to chat and retail local gossip. His serenity came back; and in its wake came happiness, in the form of two friends, who came round one Sunday to play a game of solo, with tokens instead of money. He laughed, he joked, he was his usual self; the wound had healed completely.","In the days that followed he would enter and leave the house glued to the wall, with his head down. He was no longer the same man who wore out his hat in greeting the neighbours, beaming round him happily, even before his temporary directorship. As the weeks passed Pádua slowly recovered. He began to interest himself in domestic matters, to care for his birds, to sleep peacefully every night and afternoon, to converse and bring back news from town. His serenity returned and with it some cheerfulness apparent when two friends came one Sunday to play solo for counters. Once again he was laughing, joking in his old habitual manner. The wound was completely cured."

"Concertou a capinha e ergueu-se. Suspirou, creio que suspirou, enquanto eu, que não pedia outra cousa mais que a plena justificação dela, disse-lhe não sei que palavras adequadas a este fim. Capitu olhou para mim com desdém, e murmurou:","He fixed the cape and stood up. She sighed, I think she sighed, while I, who asked for nothing more than her full justification, spoke to her I don't know what words were adequate for this purpose. Capitu looked at me with disdain, and muttered:","She adjusted her short cape and stood up. She sighed, I think she sighed, while I, who wanted nothing more than her complete vindication, said some words I can’t remember to this effect. Capitu looked at me disdainfully, and murmured:","She adjusted her shawl and stood up. She sighed , at least I think she sighed, while I, who wanted nothing other than a full acquittal, muttered some words to this effect. Capitu gave me a look of contempt and murmured, ‘I know the reason."
"Em tudo isso mostrava a minha amiga tanta lucidez que eu bem podia deixar de citar um terceiro exemplo, mas os exemplos não se fizeram senão para ser citados, e este é tão bom que a omissão seria um crime. Foi à minha terceira ou quarta vinda à casa. Minha mãe depois que lhe respondi às mil perguntas que me fez sobre o tratamento que me davam, os estudos, as relações, a disciplina, e se me doía alguma cousa, e se dormia bem, tudo o que a ternura das mães inventa para cansar a paciência de um filho, concluiu voltando-se para José Dias.","In all this my friend showed so much lucidity that I could well have failed to mention a third example, but the examples were only made to be cited, and this one is so good that the omission would be a crime. It was my third or fourth visit to the house. My mother, after I answered the thousand questions she asked me about the treatment they gave me, studies, relationships, discipline, and if anything hurt me, and if I slept well, everything that the tenderness of mothers invents to tire me out. the patience of a son, he concluded, turning to José Dias.","In all this my companion gave evidence of such clear thinking that there is almost no need for me to cite a third example, but what are examples for but citing, and this is such a good one that it would be a crime to omit it. It was on my third or fourth visit home. My mother, after I had replied to a thousand questions about the way I was treated, my studies, my friendships, the discipline, and if anything was hurting, if I was sleeping well, everything that a mother’s tenderness can invent to try the patience of her son, ended by turning to José Dias:","In all this Capitu showed such good sense that I might well omit citing a third example, but what are examples for if not to be cited? And this one is so good that to omit it would be a crime. It was my third or fourth visit home. After I had replied to the thousand questions my mother asked concerning how I was treated, my studies, my friends, the discipline, whether I felt ill, whether I slept well and everything else that a mother’s tenderness can invent to exhaust the patience of a son, she turned to José Dias and said, ‘Senhor José Dias, do you still have doubts about them making him into a good priest?’"

"A resposta de Capitu foi um riso doce de escárnio, um desses risos que não se descrevem, e apenas se pintarão; depois estirou os braços e atirou-mos sobre os ombros, tão cheios de graça que pareciam (velha imagem!) um colar de flores. Eu fiz o mesmo aos meus, e senti não haver ali um escultor que nos transferisse a atitude a um pedaço de mármore. Só brilharia o artista, é certo. Quando uma pessoa ou um grupo saem bem, ninguém quer saber de modelo, mas da obra, e a obra é que fica. Não importa; nós saberíamos que éramos nós.","Capitu's answer was a sweet laugh of derision, one of those laughs that cannot be described, and will only be painted; then he stretched out his arms and threw them over his shoulders, so full of grace that they looked like (old picture!) a necklace of flowers. I did the same to mine, and I felt that there was no sculptor there to transfer our attitude to a piece of marble. Only the artist would shine, that's for sure. When a person or a group does well, nobody cares about the model, but about the work, and the work remains. Does not matter; we would know it was us.","Capitu’s reply was a soft mocking laugh, one of those laughs which can’t be described, and hardly painted; then she stretched her arms out and flung them over my shoulders, so full of charm that they seemed—to use a worn image—a garland of flowers. I did the same with mine, and was sorry that there was no sculptor there to copy our posture in a piece of marble. It is true that only the artist would get any glory from it. When a person or a group turn out well, no one wants to know about the model, only the work, and it is the work that endures. No matter: we would know it was us.","For answer Capitu gave a sweet ironic smile, one of those smiles that cannot be described, only painted. Then she stretched out her arms and placed them over my shoulders, looking so graceful that they seemed – a hackneyed image – a necklace of flowers. I did the same with mine, regretting that there was no sculptor there to reproduce the image in marble. No doubt only the artist would be admired.

"Nem só os olhos, mas as restantes feições, a cara, o corpo, a pessoa inteira, iam-se apurando com o tempo. Eram como um debuxo primitivo que o artista vai enchendo e colorindo aos poucos, e a figura entra a ver, sorrir, palpitar, falar quase, até que a família pendura o quadro na parede, em memória do que foi e já não pode ser. Aqui podia ser e era. O costume valeu muito contra o efeito da mudança; mas a mudança fez-se, não à maneira de teatro, fez-se como a manhã que aponta vagarosa, primeiro que se possa ler uma carta, depois lê-se a carta na rua, em casa, no gabinete, sem abrir as janelas; a luz coada pelas persianas basta a distinguir as letras. Li a carta, mal a princípio e não toda, depois fui lendo melhor. Fugia-lhe, é certo, metia o papel no bolso, corria a casa, fechava-me, não abria as vidraças, chegava a fechar os olhos. Quando novamente abria os olhos e a carta, a letra era clara e a notícia claríssima.","Not just the eyes, but the rest of the features, the face, the body, the whole person, were getting better with time. They were like a primitive sketch that the artist gradually fills and colors, and the figure starts to see, smile, throb, almost speak, until the family hangs the painting on the wall, in memory of what was and can no longer be. Here it could be and it was. Custom was very good against the effect of change; but the change took place, not in a theatrical way, it took place like the morning that slowly points, first you can read a letter, then you read the letter on the street, at home, in the office, without opening the windows ; the light filtered through the blinds is enough to distinguish the letters. I read the letter, barely at first and not all of it, then I read it better. I would run away from him, it is true, I would put the paper in my pocket, run around the house, close myself, I would not open the windows, I would even close my eyes. When he opened his eyes and the letter again, the handwriting was clear and the news very clear.","Not only the eyes, but the other features, the face, the body, the whole person, were gradually rounded out with time. They were like a primitive sketch which the artist fills out and colors in little by little, and the figure starts to look out of the canvas, to smile, pulsate with life, almost to speak, until the family hangs the portrait on the wall, in memory of what once was and can no longer be. Here it could be and was. Habit could still fight against the effect of the change; but the change did take place, and not as happens in the theater; it happened like the day dawning: at first, it’s impossible to make out some handwriting: then you can read it in the street, at home, and then in your study, without opening the windows: the light filtering through the blinds is enough to make out the words. I read this letter, at first with difficulty and not entire, then I started to read more easily. True, I fled from it, put it in my pocket, ran home, shut myself in, didn’t open the windows: I even shut my eyes. When I opened them and the letter again, the writing was clear, and the message as clear as could be.","Not only his eyes but all his other features, his face, his body, his whole person, became more defined as time passed. It was like a rough sketch which the artist fills in and colours little by little: the figure starts to emerge, to breathe, almost to speak, and the family hang the portrait on the wall in memory of what once was and could never be again. Here it could be and was. Everyday intercourse disguised the effects of change, but change there was, not as in the theatre but like a day slowly dawning and growing lighter: at first you cannot read a letter, then you can read it in the street, in the house, in your study without opening the windows, the light filtering through the shutters being sufficient to make out the words. I read the letter, with difficulty at first and not all of it; then I read it more easily. It is true that I tore myself from it; put the paper in my pocket, ran through the house, locked myself in, left the windows closed and even closed my eyes. When I again opened my eyes and the letter, the words stood out and the message was all too evident."
"Grande foi a sensação do beijo; Capitu ergueu-se, rápida, eu recuei até à parede com uma espécie de vertigem, sem fala, os olhos escuros. Quando eles me clarearam, vi que Capitu tinha os seus no chão. Não me atrevi a dizer nada; ainda que quisesse, faltava-me língua. Preso, atordoado, não achava gesto nem ímpeto que me descolasse da parede e me atirasse a ela com mil palavras cálidas e mimosas… Não mofes dos meus quinze anos, leitor precoce. Com dezessete, Des Grieux (e mais era Des Grieux) não pensava ainda na diferença dos sexos.","Great was the sensation of the kiss; Capitu got up quickly, I backed up to the wall with a kind of vertigo, speechless, my eyes dark. When they cleared me, I saw that Capitu had hers on the floor. I didn't dare say anything; even if I wanted to, I lacked a language. Stunned, stunned, I didn't find a gesture or impetus to take me off the wall and throw myself at it with a thousand warm and sweet words... Don't mock my fifteen years old, precocious reader. At seventeen, Des Grieux (and more was Des Grieux) did not yet think about the difference between the sexes.","The kiss had an extraordinary effect; Capitu got up quickly, and I recoiled to the wall with a kind of vertigo, speechless, my eyes darkened over. When vision returned, I saw that Capitu had her eyes on the ground. I dared not say anything; even if I had wanted to, I was tongue-tied. I was caught, stunned: no gesture or impulse could pry me from the wall and make me rush towards her with a thousand warm and endearing words … Don’t make fun of my fifteen years, precocious reader. At seventeen, Des Grieux—Des Grieux, what’s more—had not yet thought about the difference between the sexes. *","That kiss produced an extraordinary effect. Capitu stood up quickly, while I retreated against the wall in a kind of trance, speechless and misty-eyed. When these cleared I saw that Capitu had hers fixed on the ground. I did not dare to speak, and even had I wanted to my tongue was tied. Dazed and incapable of movement I had no strength to tear myself from the wall and throw myself at her feet with a thousand passionate words of endearment. Do not mock my fifteen years, precocious reader. At seventeen, Des Grieux (Des Grieux himself) had as yet given no thought to the difference between the sexes."

"Era tão perto, que antes de três minutos me achei em casa. Parei no corredor, a tomar fôlego; buscava esquecer o defunto, pálido e disforme, e o mais que não disse para não dar a estas páginas um aspecto repugnante, mas podes imaginá-lo. Tudo arredei da vista, em poucos segundos; bastou-me pensar na outra casa, e mais na vida e na cara fresca e lépida de Capitu… Amai, rapazes! e, principalmente, amai moças lindas e graciosas; elas dão remédio ao mal, aroma ao infecto, trocam a morte pela vida… Amai, rapazes!","It was so close that within three minutes I found myself at home.

Everything disappeared from view in a few seconds; it was enough for me to think about the other house, and more about life and Capitu's fresh and cheerful face… Love, boys! and, above all, love beautiful and graceful girls; they give medicine to the evil, aroma to the infected, they exchange death for life... Love, boys!","It was so close that within three minutes I was home. I stopped in the corridor to catch my breath; I was trying to forget the dead body, pale and deformed, and everything else I haven’t said so as not to give a repugnant aspect to these pages, but you can imagine it. I put everything out of my mind in a few seconds; all I needed to do was to think about the other house, about life and Capitu ’s fresh, lively face … Love, my lads!

"Ora, nesse mesmo capítulo, verteu ela umas lágrimas, que enxugou sem explicar, e que nenhum dos presentes, nem Tio Cosme, nem prima Justina, nem o agregado José Dias entendeu absolutamente; eu, que estava atrás da porta, não as entendi mais que eles. Bem examinadas, apesar da distância, vê-se que eram saudades prévias, a mágoa da separação, — e pode ser também (é o princípio do ponto), pode ser que arrependimento da promessa. Católica e devota, sentia muito bem que as promessas se cumprem; a questão é se é oportuno e adequado fazê-las todas, e naturalmente inclinava-se à negativa. Por que é que Deus a puniria, negando-lhe um segundo filho? A vontade divina podia ser a minha vida, sem necessidade de lha dedicar ab ovo. Era um raciocínio tardio; devia ter sido feito no dia em que fui gerado. Em todo caso, era uma conclusão primeira; mas, não bastando concluir para destruir, tudo se manteve, e eu fui para o seminário.","Now, in that same chapter, she shed a few tears, which she wiped away without explaining, and which none of those present, neither Uncle Cosme, nor cousin Justina, nor the associate José Dias understood at all; I, who was behind the door, did not understand them any more than they did. Closely examined, despite the distance, it can be seen that they were previous homesickness, the hurt of separation, — and it could also be (this is the beginning of the point), it could be that repentance of the promise. Catholic and devout, she felt very well that promises were fulfilled; the question is whether it is opportune and proper to do them all, and naturally he was inclined towards the negative. Why would God punish her by denying her a second child? The divine will could be my life, without the need to dedicate it ab ovo. It was an afterthought; it should have been done the day I was begotten. In any case, it was a first conclusion; but, as it was not enough to finish to destroy, everything remained, and I went to the seminary.","Now, in that same chapter, she shed some tears, which she then dried without explaining them, and which none of those present, Uncle Cosme, cousin Justina, nor the dependent José Dias understood at all; I, behind the door, understood them no better than they did. On careful examination, and in spite of the distance in time, it can be seen that they were tears of anticipated longing, the pain of separation—and it may also be (this is the beginning of the point), it may also be that she repented of her promise. Catholic and devout, she knew very well that promises must be kept; the question is whether or not it is appropriate and fitting to keep them all, and naturally she inclined to reply in the negative. Why would God punish her, denying her a second child? The divine will might have been that I should live, without there being any need to dedicate me to Him ab ovo. It was a belated argument; she should have thought of it on the day I was conceived. At any event, she had reached a first conclusion; but since this was not enough to destroy everything, everything went on as planned, and I went to the seminary.","Now, in that same chapter she shed some tears and dried them without giving any explanation, so that none of those present, neither Uncle Cosme, nor Cousin Justina, nor José Dias, was able to understand, and I, hidden behind the door, understood no more than they did. If we consider the matter carefully, and despite the distance in time, we realize that the tears were in anticipation of the sadness of our parting – though (and this is the main point) they could equally well mean she repented of her promise. A devout Catholic, she was aware that promises are made to be kept; the question is whether it is wise and convenient to keep them all, and naturally she preferred the negative answer. Why should God punish her, denying her a second child? The divine will might be that I should live without the necessity of dedicating me to God ab ovo. Such reasoning came late in the day: it should have come the day I was conceived. In any case it was an obvious conclusion, but it did not suffice to change matters: the promise was kept, and I went to the seminary."
"Não foi o último superlativo de José Dias. Outros teve que não vale a pena escrever aqui, até que veio o último, o melhor deles, o mais doce, o que lhe fez da morte um pedaço de vida. Já então morava comigo; posto que minha mãe lhe deixasse uma pequena lembrança, veio dizer-me que, com legado ou sem ele, não se separaria de mim. Talvez a esperança dele fosse enterrar-me. Correspondia-se com Capitu, a quem pedia que lhe mandasse o retrato de Ezequiel; mas Capitu ia adiando a remessa de correio a correio, até que ele não pediu mais nada, a não ser o coração do jovem estudante; pedia-lhe também que não deixasse de falar a Ezequiel no velho amigo do pai e do avô, “destinado pelo céu a amar o mesmo sangue”. Era assim que ele preparava os cuidados da terceira geração; mas a morte veio antes de Ezequiel. A doença foi rápida. Mandei chamar um médico homeopata.","It was not the last superlative of José Dias. Others had it not worth writing here, until the last came, the best of them, the sweetest, which made death a piece of life. He was already living with me; since my mother had left him a small souvenir, she came to tell me that, with or without a legacy, she would not be parted from me. Maybe his hope was to bury me. He corresponded with Capitu, to whom he asked to send him the portrait of Ezequiel; but Capitu kept putting off sending it from post to post, until he asked for nothing but the young student's heart; he also asked him not to stop talking to Ezequiel about his father's and grandfather's old friend, ""destined by heaven to love the same blood."" This was how he prepared the care of the third generation; but death came before Ezekiel. The illness was quick. I sent for a homeopathic doctor.","It was not José Dias’ last superlative. There were others which it is not worth transcribing here, until the last, the best of them, the gentlest, which made his death a part of his life. Now he was living with me; although my mother had left him a small legacy, he came to tell me that now, with the legacy or without it, he would not be separated from me. Perhaps he hoped to bury me. He corresponded with Capitu, asking her to send him a portrait of Ezequiel; but Capitu kept putting it off from one mail to the next, until he asked for nothing more than the young student’s affection; he also asked her that she should not fail to speak to Ezequiel of his father’s and grandfather’s old friend, “destined by heaven to love those of the same blood.” That was his way of preparing himself to be looked after by the third generation; but death came before Ezequiel. It was a brief illness. I asked for a homeopathic doctor to be sent for.","That was not José Dias’s last superlative. There were others which it is not worth recording here, until we come to the last, the best of all, the sweetest, the one that transformed death into a breath of life. He was then living with me. Although my mother had left him a small legacy, he came to tell me that with it or without it he would not be separated from me. Perhaps he hoped to see me buried. He corresponded with Capitu, whom he asked to send a portrait of Ezequiel, but she delayed sending it from one post to the next until he gave up asking, wanting only to be remembered to him. He asked her to tell Ezequiel of his father’s and grandfather’s old friend, ‘destined by heaven to love all of that blood’. Thus he paved the way to accepting the cares of the third generation, but his own death came before that of Ezequiel. He fell ill suddenly, and I ordered a homoeopathic doctor to be sent for."

"Quero dizer que o meu vizinho de Matacavalos, temperando o mal com a opinião antirrussa, dava à podridão das suas carnes um reflexo espiritual que as consolava. Há consolações maiores, de certo, e uma das mais excelentes é não padecer esse nem outro mal algum, mas a natureza é tão divina que se diverte com tais contrastes, e aos mais nojentos ou mais aflitos acena com uma flor. E talvez saia assim a flor mais bela; o meu jardineiro afirma que as violetas, para terem um cheiro superior, hão mister de estrume de porco. Não examinei, mas deve ser verdade.","I mean that my neighbor from Matacavalos, tempering evil with anti-Russian opinion, gave the rottenness of his flesh a spiritual reflection that consoled him. There are greater consolations, of course, and one of the most excellent is not to suffer this or any other evil, but nature is so divine that it enjoys such contrasts, and to the most disgusting or most afflicted waves a flower. And maybe that's how the most beautiful flower emerges; my gardener says that violets, in order to have a superior smell, need pig manure. I haven't examined it, but it must be true.","What I mean is that my Matacavalos neighbor, easing his illness with his anti-Russian opinions, gave to his rotting flesh a spiritual glow that consoled him in his sufferings. No doubt there are greater consolations, and one of the most excellent of all is not to suffer from this or any other illness, but nature is so divine that it amuses itself with such contrasts, and it beckons the most loathsome and unhappy with a flower. Perhaps, even, the flower turns out more beautiful that way; my gardener tells me that violets, to have a lovely scent, need pig’s manure. I’ve never gone into it, but it must be true.","What I mean is that my neighbour in Matacavalos tempered the corruption of his flesh with his anti-Russian opinions, producing a spiritual balm that acted as a consolation. There are of course better consolations, one of the best being not to suffer from this or any other disease, but the divinity of nature is such that she delights in these contrasts, greeting the foulest and most oppressive with a flower.

"O riso animou-me. As palavras pareciam ser uma troça consigo mesma, uma vez que, desde manhã, era mulher, como eu era homem. Achei-lhe graça, e, para dizer tudo, quis provar-lhe que era moça inteira. Peguei-lhe levemente na mão direita, depois na esquerda, e fiquei assim pasmado e trêmulo. Era a ideia com mãos. Quis puxar as de Capitu, para obrigá-la a vir atrás delas, mas ainda agora a ação não respondeu à intenção. Contudo, achei-me forte e atrevido. Não imitava ninguém; não vivia com rapazes, que me ensinassem anedotas de amor. Não conhecia a violação de Lucrécia. Dos romanos apenas sabia que falavam pela artinha do padre Pereira e eram patrícios de Pôncio Pilatos. Não nego que o final do penteado da manhã era um grande passo no caminho da movimentação amorosa, mas o gesto de então foi justamente o contrário deste. De manhã, ela derreou a cabeça, agora fugia-me; nem é só nisso que os lances diferiam; em outro ponto, parecendo haver repetição, houve contraste.","Laughter cheered me up. The words seemed to be a mockery of herself, since since morning she was a woman, as I was a man. I found her funny, and, to say it all, I wanted to prove to her that I was a complete girl. I took it lightly in my right hand, then in my left, and I was thus amazed and trembling. It was the idea with hands. He wanted to pull Capitu's hands, to force her to come after them, but even now the action did not respond to the intention. However, I found myself strong and bold. He didn't imitate anyone; I didn't live with boys who taught me love stories. I didn't know about Lucrecia's rape. I only knew of the Romans that they spoke through the art of Father Pereira and were patricians of Pontius Pilate. I don't deny that the end of the morning hairstyle was a big step in the way of amorous movement, but the gesture of that time was just the opposite of this one. In the morning, she melted her head, now she ran away from me; nor is it only in this that the bids differed; at another point, appearing to be repetition, there was contrast.","Her laughter cheered me. The words seemed to be a joke at her own expense, the more so since, after the events of the morning, she was as much a woman as I was a man. I thought her charming, and to tell the truth, I wanted to prove to her that she was a complete woman. I took her gently by the right hand, then the left, and stopped at that point, astonished at myself and trembling. This time it was an idea with hands. I wanted to pull Capitu’s towards me, so as to force her to come with them, but the action still did not correspond to the intention. Even so, I thought myself bold and daring. I wasn’t imitating anyone; I didn’t have the company of other boys to tell me of their exploits. I had never read about the rape of Lucretia. All I knew about the Romans was that they spoke like the people in Padre Pereira’s grammar, and that they were compatriots of Pontius Pilate. * I don’t deny that the conclusion of the morning’s combing was a great step down the road of amorous expertise, but her gestures then were the exact opposite of what she did now. In the morning, she leaned her head back: now she avoided me. Nor was that the only way that the situations differed. On another point, where there seemed to be repetition, there was a contrast.","Her laugh encouraged me. Her words seemed to be a joke levelled at herself, since from that morning she was a woman as I myself was a man. I found it funny, and to make an end of the matter I wanted to prove to her that she was completely a young woman. Lightly I took hold of her right hand, then of her left, and stayed like that, breathless and trembling. My thoughts were only of hands. I wanted to pull Capitu’s to bring her nearer to me, but still the action was unequal to the desire. Nevertheless I considered myself strong and daring. I was not imitating anyone; I had never consorted with other boys to learn stories of love from them. I had not heard of the rape of Lucrece. All I knew of the Romans was that they spoke the language of Father Pereira’s handbook and that they were the compatriots of Pontius Pilate. I do not deny that the close of the hairdressing session was a great step forward in my initiation to love, but her gesture then was just the opposite of now. In the morning she had inclined her head; now she held it back. Nor was this the only difference: in one other aspect, what appeared to be a repetition was in fact a contrast."

— Mamãe quê? Que é que tem mamãe?,— Mom what? What's up with mom?,"For some time I could not say the rest, though it wasn’t much, and I had it by heart, José Dias asked again what it was, gently shook me, lifted my chin, and gazed at me anxiously, like cousin Justina the evening before. “Mamma what? What about Mamma?”",‘Your mother? What about your mother?’

"Capitu refletia. A reflexão não era cousa rara nela, e conheciam-se as ocasiões pelo apertado dos olhos. Pediu-me algumas circunstâncias mais, as próprias palavras de uns e de outros, e o tom delas. Como eu não queria dizer o ponto inicial da conversa, que era ela mesma, não lhe pude dar toda a significação. A atenção de Capitu estava agora particularmente nas lágrimas de minha mãe; não acabava de entendê-las. Em meio disto, confessou que certamente não era por mal que minha mãe me queria fazer padre; era a promessa antiga, que ela, temente a Deus, não podia deixar de cumprir. Fiquei tão satisfeito de ver que assim espontaneamente reparava as injúrias que lhe saíram do peito, pouco antes, que peguei da mão dela e apertei-a muito. Capitu deixou-se ir, rindo; depois a conversa entrou a cochilar e dormir. Tínhamos chegado à janela; um preto, que, desde algum tempo, vinha apregoando cocadas, parou em frente e perguntou:","Capitu reflected. Reflection was not uncommon for her, and occasions were known by the squint of her eyes. He asked me for a few more circumstances, their own words and their tone. As I didn't want to say the starting point of the conversation, which was herself, I couldn't give her full meaning. Capitu's attention was now particularly on my mother's tears; I just didn't understand them. In the midst of this, he confessed that it was certainly not out of spite that my mother wanted to make me a priest; it was the old promise, which she, fearing God, could not fail to keep. I was so pleased to see that he was thus spontaneously repairing the injuries that had left his chest just before, that I took her hand and squeezed it very tightly. Capitu let himself go, laughing; then the conversation drifted off to sleep. We had reached the window; a black man, who for some time had been hawking cocadas, stopped in front of him and asked:","Capitu was reflecting. Reflection was not a rare occurrence with her, and you could tell it was happening by her eyes, which were shut tight. She asked me for a few more details, the actual words spoken by each person, and their tone. Since I did not want to tell her about the starting point of the conversation—that is, she herself—I could not give the whole meaning. Capitu concentrated particularly now on my mother’s tears; she could not convince herself she understood them. In the middle of all this, she admitted that my mother certainly did not want to make me a priest out of malice; it was the old promise, which she, God fearing as she was, dared not break. I was so pleased to see that she made up for the insults that had sprung from her a short time before that I took her hand and squeezed it. Capitu let herself go, laughing; then the conversation began to nod off and finally went to sleep. We had gone over to the window; a black who for some time had been hawking coconut sweets, stopped in the street opposite and asked:","Capitu was deep in thought. This was not unusual with her, and one could tell by the narrowing of her eyes. She asked me for some further details, the exact words used by one or the other and the tone of their voice. As I did not want to tell her what had set off the conversation, the reference to her, I could not make everything clear. Capitu was particularly struck by my mother’s tears and was quite unable to account for them. She admitted that it was not through ill will that my mother wanted me to be a priest; it was her former promise, which she, being a God-fearing woman, did not dare to break. I was so pleased to see the spontaneity with which Capitu made up for the insults she had so recently uttered that I seized her hand and squeezed it tight. She gave a laugh, and the conversation died away until it broke off altogether. We were now standing by the window."

"Assim falara na véspera e no quarto. Agora não dizia nada, ou proferia algum aforismo sobre a religião e a família; lembro-me deste: “Dividi-lo com Deus é ainda possuí-lo”. Quando minha mãe me deu o último beijo: “Quadro amantíssimo!” suspirou ele. Era manhã de um lindo dia. Os moleques cochichavam; as escravas tomavam a benção: “Benção, Nhõ Bentinho! Não se esqueça de sua Joana! Sua Miquelina fica rezando por vosmecê!”. Na rua José Dias insistiu nas esperanças:","So he had said the day before and in the bedroom.

Don't forget your Joana! Miquelina keeps praying for you!”. On José Dias Street, he insisted on his hopes:","Thus he had spoken the previous day in his room.

The slave-children were whispering to each other; the women came to take their blessing: “ Your blessing, massa Bentinho! Don’t forget your old Joana! Miquelina pray for your worship!” In the street, José Dias still insisted on hope for the future:","That was what he had said the day before in his room.

"O destino não é só dramaturgo, é também o seu próprio contrarregra, isto é, designa a entrada dos personagens em cena, dá-lhes as cartas e outros objetos, e executa dentro os sinais correspondentes ao diálogo, uma trovoada, um carro, um tiro. Quando eu era moço, representou-se aí, em não sei que teatro, um drama que acabava pelo juízo final. O principal personagem era Ahasvérus, que no último quadro concluía um monólogo por esta exclamação: “Ouço a trombeta do arcanjo!”. Não se ouviu trombeta nenhuma. Ahasvérus, envergonhado, repetiu a palavra, agora mais alto, para advertir o contrarregra, mas ainda nada. Então caminhou para o fundo, disfarçadamente trágico, mas efetivamente com o fim de falar ao bastidor, e dizer em voz surda: “O pistom! O pistom! O pistom!”. O público ouviu esta palavra e desatou a rir, até que, quando a trombeta soou deveras, e Ahasvérus bradou pela terceira vez que era a do arcanjo, um gaiato da plateia corrigiu cá debaixo: “Não, senhor, é o pistom do arcanjo!”.","Destiny is not only a playwright, it is also its own counter-rule, that is, it designates the entry of the characters on the stage, gives them the cards and other objects, and executes the signs corresponding to the dialogue, a thunderstorm, a car, a shot. When I was young, a drama that ended in the final judgment was played out there, in I don't know what theater. The main character was Ahasvérus, who in the last frame concluded a monologue with this exclamation: “I hear the trumpet of the archangel!”. No trumpet was heard. Ahasvérus, embarrassed, repeated the word, louder now, to warn the stagehand, but still nothing. Then he walked to the back, disguisedly tragic, but effectively in order to speak behind the scenes, and say in a muffled voice: “The piston! The piston! The piston!” The audience heard this word and burst out laughing, until, when the trumpet really sounded, and Ahasverus shouted for the third time that it was the archangel's, a chuckle from the audience corrected below: ""No, sir, it's the archangel's piston! ”.","That is, it sets up the characters’ entrances on stage, gives them letters and other objects, and makes the offstage noises corresponding to the dialogue: a roll of thunder, a carriage, a gunshot.

"José Dias amava os superlativos. Era um modo de dar feição monumental às ideias; não as havendo, servir a prolongar as frases. Levantou-se para ir buscar o gamão, que estava no interior da casa. Cosi-me muito à parede, e vi-o passar com as suas calças brancas engomadas, presilhas, rodaque e gravata de mola. Foi dos últimos que usaram presilhas no Rio de Janeiro, e talvez neste mundo. Trazia as calças curtas para que lhe ficassem bem esticadas. A gravata de cetim preto, com um aro de aço por dentro, imobilizava-lhe o pescoço; era então moda. O rodaque de chita, veste caseira e leve, parecia nele uma casaca de cerimônia. Era magro, chupado, com um princípio de calva; teria os seus cinquenta e cinco anos. Levantou-se com o passo vagaroso do costume, não aquele vagar arrastado dos preguiçosos, mas um vagar calculado e deduzido, um silogismo completo, a premissa antes da consequência, a consequência antes da conclusão. Um dever amaríssimo!","José Dias loved superlatives. It was a way of giving a monumental aspect to ideas; if there are none, serve to prolong the sentences. He got up to fetch his backgammon, which was inside the house. I sewed myself against the wall a lot, and watched him walk by in his starched white pants, belt loops, lace and snap-on tie. He was one of the last to use barrettes in Rio de Janeiro, and perhaps in this world. She wore her short pants so they were tight. His black satin tie, with a steel ring inside, immobilized his neck; it was then fashion. The calico trouser, homely and light, looked like a ceremonial coat on him. He was thin, full, with a beginning of baldness; would have been fifty-five. He got up with the usual leisurely pace, not that sluggish leisurely pace, but a calculated and deduced pace, a complete syllogism, the premise before the consequence, the consequence before the conclusion. A most loving duty!","José Dias loved superlatives. It was a way of giving an impressive aspect to his ideas; or, if these latter were lacking, they made the sentence longer. He got up to fetch the backgammon, which was in the back of the house. I flattened myself against the wall, and watched him go by with his starched white trousers, trouserstraps,* jacket, and cravat. He was one of the last people to use trouserstraps in Rio de Janeiro—perhaps in the whole world. He wore his trousers short so that they would be stretched very tightly. The black satin cravat, with a steel ring inside, immobilized his neck: it was the fashion at the time. His jacket, which was made of cheap cotton, lightweight and for indoor use, on him looked like a formal frock coat. He was thin, emaciated, and beginning to go bald; he must have been about fifty-five. He got up with his usual slow step: not the lethargic gait of a lazy man, but a logical, calculated slowness, a complete syllogism, the premise before the consequence, the consequence before the conclusion. The harshest of duties!","José Dias loved superlatives. They served to give grandiosity to his ideas and, when these were lacking, to prolong his sentences.

He was one of the last to use trouser straps in Rio de Janeiro, perhaps in the world, and he always wore his trousers short so that they could be stretched tight. His black satin tie had a steel hoop inside which immobilized his neck, as was then the fashion. His cotton waistcoat, lightweight for indoor wear, on him seemed to be ceremonial dress. He was thin, frail and balding and must have been about fifty-two years old.

"A verdade é que eu só vim a aprender equitação mais tarde, menos por gosto que por vergonha de dizer que não sabia montar. “Agora é que ele vai namorar deveras”, disseram quando eu comecei as lições. Não se diria o mesmo de Tio Cosme. Nele era velho costume e necessidade. Já não dava para namoros. Contam que, em rapaz, foi aceito de muitas damas, além de partidário exaltado; mas os anos levaram-lhe o mais do ardor político e sexual, e a gordura acabou com o resto de ideias públicas e específicas. Agora só cumpria as obrigações do ofício e sem amor. Nas horas de lazer vivia olhando ou jogava. Uma ou outra vez dizia pilhérias.","The truth is that I only came to learn riding later, less because I liked it than because I was ashamed to say that I didn't know how to ride. ""Now he's really going to date"", they said when I started the lessons. The same could not be said of Tio Cosme. In him was old custom and necessity. It was no longer for dating. They say that, as a boy, he was accepted by many ladies, as well as an exalted partisan; but the years took most of the political and sexual ardor from him, and the fat wiped out the rest of public and specific ideas. Now he only fulfilled the obligations of his office and without love. In his leisure time, he lived watching or playing. Once in a while he said jokes.","The truth is that I only learned horsemanship later, less for the pleasure of it than because I was ashamed to say that I didn’t know how to ride. “Now he’ll really be chasing the girls,” they said when I began the lessons. The same could not be said of Uncle Cosme. With him, it had been an old habit, and a necessity. Now, he was done with flirting. They say that when he was younger he was very popular with the ladies, and was a fervent political enthusiast; but the years had removed the greater part of his political and sexual ardor, and corpulence had dealt a final blow to his ambitions, both in the public arena and in more intimate spheres. Now, he only carried out his duties, without his old enthusiasm. In his leisure hours he would sit staring, or playing cards. From time to time he would tell jokes.","If the truth be known it was only later that I learned how to ride and then less out of a wish to do so than from shame at saying I didn’t know how. When I started having lessons people said, ‘Now he’ll really be off after the girls.’ They wouldn’t say the same of Uncle Cosme. With him it was a matter of habit and necessity. Love affairs no longer interested him, though it is said that as a young man he won the hearts of many ladies and was an outspoken party man. But with the passage of the years he lost his sexual and political ardour, and his corpulence effectively put an end to any social or political ambitions. Nowadays he merely performed his duties, leading a loveless life. His leisure hours he spent observing others or playing cards. From time to time he would crack a joke."

"Um dos gestos que melhor exprimem a minha essência foi a devoção com que corri no domingo próximo a ouvir missa em Santo Antônio dos Pobres. O agregado quis ir comigo, e principiou a vestir-se, mas era tão lento nos suspensórios e nas presilhas, que não pude esperar por ele. Demais, eu queria estar só. Sentia necessidade de evitar qualquer conversação que me desviasse o pensamento do fim a que ia, e era reconciliar-me com Deus, depois do que se passou no capítulo LXVII. Nem era só pedir-lhe perdão do pecado, era também agradecer o restabelecimento de minha mãe, e, visto que digo tudo, fazê-lo renunciar ao pagamento da minha promessa. Jeová, posto que divino, ou por isso mesmo, é um Rothschild muito mais humano, e não faz moratórias, perdoa as dívidas integralmente, uma vez que o devedor queira deveras emendar a vida e cortar nas despesas. Ora, eu não queria outra cousa; dali em diante não faria mais promessas que não pudesse pagar, e pagaria logo as que fizesse.","One of the gestures that best expresses my essence was the devotion with which I ran next Sunday to hear mass in Santo Antônio dos Pobres. The householder wanted to go with me, and started to get dressed, but he was so slow with the braces and clips that I couldn't wait for him. Too much, I wanted to be alone. I felt the need to avoid any conversation that would divert my thoughts from the end to which I was going, and it was to reconcile myself with God, after what happened in chapter LXVII. It wasn't just asking him for forgiveness of sin, it was also thanking my mother for his recovery, and, as I say all, to make him renounce the payment of my promise. Jehovah, since divine, or because of that, is a much more human Rothschild, and does not make moratoriums, forgives debts in full, once the debtor really wants to amend his life and cut expenses. Well, I didn't want anything else; henceforth he would make no more promises that he could not pay, and he would soon pay those he made.","One of the gestures that best expresses my essence was the devotion with which I ran next Sunday to hear mass at Santo Antonio dos Pobres. José Dias wanted to go with me, and began to get dressed, but he was so slow with his braces and trouserstraps, that I couldn’t wait for him. Moreover, I wanted to be alone. I felt the need to avoid any conversation that might turn my thoughts aside from my purpose, which was to reconcile myself with God after what happened in Chapter LXVII. Nor was it only to ask pardon for the sin, it was also to thank Him for my mother’s recovery, and, since I am confessing all, to make Him forgo the payment of my promise. Jehovah, even though He is divine, or for that very reason, is a much more humane Rothschild, who doesn’t insist on prompt payment: he waives debts entirely, if the debtor truly wishes to mend his ways and cut down on his expenses. Well, that was just what I wanted; from now on I would make no promises that I could not pay, and those that I did make I would pay straight away.","One of the actions that best illustrates my essence was the reverence with which I ran to hear mass at Santo Antônio dos Pobres the following Sunday.

I felt the need to avoid any conversation that might distract my thoughts from the purpose for which I went there, which was to reconcile myself with God after what had taken place in Chapter 67. I wanted not only to ask pardon for my sin but to give thanks for my mother’s recovery and, since I am making a clean breast of it, to ask Him to cancel the payment of my promise. Jehovah, though He is divine or, rather, because of this, is a much more human Rothschild, not declaring moratoriums but freely pardoning our debts if the debtor truly wishes to mend his ways and reduce his expenses.

"Dali mesmo busquei os olhos de Sancha, ao pé do piano; encontrei-os em caminho. Pararam os quatro e ficaram diante uns dos outros, uns esperando que os outros passassem, mas nenhuns passavam. Tal se dá na rua entre dous teimosos. A cautela desligou-nos; eu tornei a voltar-me para fora. E assim posto entrei a cavar na memória se alguma vez olhara para ela com a mesma expressão, e fiquei incerto.

The four of them stopped and stood in front of each other, one waiting for the others to pass, but none did. This happens on the street between two stubborn people.

I was sure of only one thing, it was that one day I thought of her, as one thinks of the beautiful unknown that passes by; but then it would happen that she guessing… Perhaps the mere thought would shine through me outside, and she would flee from me, once irritated or shy, and now by an invincible movement… Invincible; this word was like a priest's blessing at mass, which people receive and repeat in themselves.","From that very place I sought Sancha’s eyes, next to the piano: mine met hers half way.

I was sure of one thing, that I had thought of her one day, as one thinks of any pretty passer-by; but could it be that she had guessed … Perhaps the mere thought had shone in my face, but before, she had fled from me out of annoyance or timidity; now, because of an invincible urge … Invincible; the word was like the priest’s blessing at mass, which one receives and repeats inside oneself.","It was from there that I sought Sancha’s eyes – she was by the piano – and met them halfway. All four halted in front of each other as if waiting for the others to pass on; but none passed on. It was like two stubborn people meeting in the street.

The only thing I was sure of was that one day I had thought of her as one does of a pretty girl, a stranger one sees in the street. But could she have guessed … Perhaps my thoughts made themselves obvious, and at the time she had avoided me, either angry or shy, and now, by some irresistible force … Irresistible!

Why did he have to die exactly half an hour previously? For a death, any time is suitable; you can die equally well at six o’clock in the afternoon as at seven."

"Parei na varanda; ia tonto, atordoado, as pernas bambas, o coração parecendo querer sair-me pela boca fora. Não me atrevia a descer à chácara, e passar ao quintal vizinho. Comecei a andar de um lado para outro, estacando para amparar-me, e andava outra vez e estacava. Vozes confusas repetiam o discurso do José Dias:","I stopped on the porch; I was dizzy, dizzy, my legs were weak, my heart seemed to want to go out of my mouth. I didn't dare go down to the farm and go to the neighboring yard. I started pacing back and forth, stopping to support myself, and I would walk again and stop. Confused voices repeated José Dias' speech:","I stopped on the verandah; I felt dizzy, stunned, my legs were trembling, and my heart seemed on the point of coming out of my mouth. I did not dare go down into our orchard, and through to the yard next door. I began to walk back and forth, stopping to lean against the wall, starting again and stopping. Confused voices kept repeating what José Dias had said:","I felt bewildered, dizzy; my legs were groggy and my heart seemed to be trying to escape through my mouth. I did not dare go down to the garden and cross over to the next-door yard. I began to walk up and down, stopping to collect my thoughts, then walking and stopping again.

"Rigorosamente, eram duas pessoas, Capitu e Escobar, mas eu neguei a pés juntos que quisesse consultar ninguém. E que pessoa, o reitor? Não era natural que lhe confiasse tal assunto. Não, nem reitor, nem professor, nem ninguém; era só o tempo de refletir, uma semana, no domingo daria a resposta, e desde já lhe dizia que a ideia não me parecia má.","Strictly speaking, there were two people, Capitu and Escobar, but I completely denied that I wanted to consult anyone. And what person, the dean? It was unnatural for him to entrust such a matter to him. No, not dean, not professor, not anyone; it was just time to reflect, a week, on Sunday I would give the answer, and I told him right away that the idea didn't seem bad to me.","In point of fact there were two people, Capitu and Escobar, but I flatly denied that I wanted to consult anyone. Who, anyway, the Rector? Why should I want to confide in him on such a matter? No, not the Rector, nor my teachers, nobody; I only wanted time to reflect, a week, and on Sunday I would give my reply; I could tell him now that it didn’t seem a bad idea to me.","In point of fact there were two people – Escobar and Capitu – but I swore blind that I didn’t want to consult anybody. Who? The rector? It wouldn’t be normal to consult him on such a matter. No, neither the rector, nor any teacher, nor anyone at all. All I asked was a week to think about it; on Sunday I’d give him my answer, but I could say right away that it didn’t seem a bad idea."
"— Sim, tem alguma cousa, os olhos, a disposição do rosto. É o pai, um pouco mais moderno, concluiu por chalaça. E diga-me agora, mana Glória, não foi melhor que ele não teimasse em ser padre? Veja se este peralta daria um padre capaz.","— Yes, there is something, the eyes, the disposition of the face. It's the father, a little more modern, he concluded as a joke. And tell me now, sis Gloria, wasn't it better that he didn't insist on being a priest? See if this peralta would make a capable priest.","“Yes, he’s got something, his eyes, the shape of his face. He’s his father, only a bit more modern,” he concluded jokingly. “And tell me now, sister Glória, wasn’t it better that he didn’t persist in becoming a priest? Imagine this dandy making a good priest!”","‘Yes, he has something of him – the eyes, the shape of his face. He’s a modern version of his father.’ Then, jokingly, he added, ‘Tell me now, Sister Glória, wasn’t it a good thing he didn’t insist on being a priest? Can you imagine this idle fellow making a good priest?’"
"A voz era a mesma de Escobar, o sotaque era afrancesado. Expliquei-lhe que realmente pouco diferia do que era, e comecei um interrogatório para ter menos que falar e dominar assim a minha emoção. Mas isto mesmo dava animação à cara dele, e o meu colega do seminário ia ressurgindo cada vez mais do cemitério. Ei-lo aqui, diante de mim, com igual riso e maior respeito; total, o mesmo obséquio e a mesma graça. Ansiava por ver-me. A mãe falava muito em mim, louvando-me extraordinariamente, como o homem mais puro do mundo, o mais digno de ser querido.","The voice was Escobar's, the accent was French. I explained that it really didn't differ much from what it was, and I began an interrogation to have less to talk about and thus control my emotion. But this really made his face lively, and my seminary colleague was emerging more and more from the cemetery. Here he is, before me, with equal laughter and greater respect; totality, the same bounty and the same grace. He longed to see me. Mother talked a lot about me, praising me extraordinarily, as the purest man in the world, the most worthy of being loved.","His voice was the same as Escobar’s, with a French accent. I explained to him that in fact I had changed very little, and began asking him questions, so as to have to speak less, and keep control of my emotions. But even this brought animation to his face, and my seminary friend began to arise even more from the cemetery. Here he was before me, with the same laughter and a greater respect; all in all, the same politeness and the same charm. He was eager to see me. His mother had spoken of me often, with the greatest praise, as the purest man in the world, the most worthy of love.","His voice was the same as Escobar’s, though with a French accent. I said that I hadn’t changed much lately and then began asking him questions in order to talk less myself and so control my emotion. But at this his face lit up, and more and more my seminarist friend re-emerged from the cemetery. He sat there in front of me, with the same smile and respectful manner, the very same person, the same politeness, the same charm. He had been looking forward to seeing me. His mother had spoken a lot about me, praising me to the skies, saying I was the finest man in the world, the most worthy and lovable."
"Demais, as nossas relações de família estavam previamente feitas; Sancha e Capitu continuavam depois de casadas a amizade da escola, Escobar e eu a do seminário. Eles moravam em Andaraí, aonde queriam que fôssemos muitas vezes, e, não podendo ser tantas como desejávamos, íamos lá jantar alguns domingos, ou eles vinham fazê-lo conosco. Jantar é pouco. Íamos sempre muito cedo, logo depois do almoço, para gozarmos o dia compridamente, e só nos separávamos às nove, dez e onze horas, quando não podia ser mais. Agora que penso naqueles dias de Andaraí e da Glória, sinto que a vida e o resto não sejam tão rijos como as Pirâmides.","Furthermore, our family relationships were previously made; Sancha and Capitu continued their friendship at school after they were married, Escobar and I at the seminary. They lived in Andaraí, where they wanted us to go often, and, not being able to be as many as we wanted, we went there for dinner some Sundays, or they came to have dinner with us. Dinner is little. We always went very early, right after lunch, to enjoy the day at length, and we only parted ways at nine, ten, and eleven o'clock, when it couldn't be more. Now that I think about those days of Andaraí and Gloria, I feel that life and the rest are not as tough as the Pyramids.","In any case, the relationship between our families was already set up; Sancha and Capitu continued their schoolgirl friendship after marriage, Escobar and I ours from the seminary. They lived in Andaraí, and were always inviting us to go there; and though we couldn’t go as often as we wanted, we went there to dine sometimes on Sundays, or they came to us. * Dinner hardly describes it. We always went very early, straight after lunch, to enjoy the whole day to the full, and we only came away at nine, ten, eleven, when we could really stay no longer. Now, when I think of those days in Andaraí and Glória, I am sorry that life and the rest of it are not as solid as the Pyramids.","The relationship between the two families was already established: Sancha and Capitu continued, after their marriage, the friendship begun at school and Escobar and I ours of the seminary. They lived in Andaraí where they were continually inviting us, and, though not able to go as often as we wished, we occasionally went there for dinner on Sundays, or they came to us. To go for dinner is an understatement. We always went early, immediately after lunch, in order to stretch out the day and would return only at nine, ten or eleven o’clock, as late as possible. Now, when I look back on those days at Andaraí and Glória, I feel sorry that life and everything else are not so enduring as the pyramids."

"José Dias suspirava. Uma vez olhou para mim tão cheio de pena que me pareceu haver-me adivinhado, e eu quis pedir-lhe que não dissesse nada a ninguém, que eu ia castigar-me etc. Mas a pena trazia tanto amor, que não podia ser pesar do meu pecado; mas então era sempre a morte de minha mãe… Senti uma angústia grande, um nó na garganta, e não pude mais, chorei de uma vez.","José Dias sighed. Once he looked at me so full of pity that I thought he had guessed it, and I wanted to ask him not to say anything to anyone, that I was going to punish myself, etc. But the pity brought so much love that it could not be a regret for my sin; but then it was always my mother's death… I felt a great anguish, a lump in my throat, and I couldn't go on anymore, I cried all at once.","José Dias was sighing. Once he looked at me with such pity that I thought he had seen what had happened, and I almost asked him not to say anything to anybody, that I would punish myself, etc. But in the pity there was so much love that it could not be sorrow at my sin; but then it was still my mother’s death … I felt a great anguish, a knot in my throat, and I could help it no longer, and burst out crying.","José Dias was still sighing. Once he looked at me with such pity that it seemed he had guessed, and I wanted to ask him not to tell anyone, that I would do penance and so on. But his pity was so mingled with love that it could not be sorrow at my sin; it must be the death of my mother. I was overcome with grief. I felt a knot in my throat and, unable to control myself, I burst into tears."

"Há tanto tempo que isto sucedeu que não posso dizer com segurança se chorou deveras, ou se somente enxugou os olhos; cuido que os enxugou somente. Vendo-lhe o gesto, peguei-lhe na mão para animá-la, mas também eu precisava ser animado. Caímos no canapé, e ficamos a olhar para o ar. Minto; ela olhava para o chão. Fiz o mesmo, logo que a vi assim… Mas eu creio que Capitu olhava para dentro de si mesma, enquanto que eu fitava deveras o chão, o roído das fendas, duas moscas andando e um pé de cadeira lascado. Era pouco, mas distraía-me da aflição. Quando tornei a olhar para Capitu, vi que não se mexia, e fiquei com tal medo que a sacudi brandamente. Capitu tornou cá para fora e pediu-me que outra vez lhe contasse o que se passara com minha mãe. Satisfi-la, atenuando o texto desta vez, para não amofiná-la. Não me chames dissimulado, chama-me compassivo; é certo que receava perder Capitu, se lhe morressem as esperanças todas, mas doía-me vê-la padecer. Agora, a verdade última, a verdade das verdades, é que já me arrependia de haver falado a minha mãe, antes de qualquer trabalho efetivo por parte de José Dias; examinando bem, não quisera ter ouvido um desengano que eu reputava certo, ainda que demorado. Capitu refletia, refletia, refletia…","It has been so long since this happened that I cannot say with certainty whether he really wept, or whether he merely wiped his eyes; I take care that you only dried them. Seeing her gesture, I took her hand to cheer her up, but I too needed to be cheered up. We fell down on the settee and stared into the air. I lie; she was looking at the floor. I did the same, as soon as I saw her like this… But I think Capitu was looking inside herself, while I was really looking at the floor, the gnawed crevices, two flies walking and a chipped chair leg. It was little, but it distracted me from the affliction. When I looked at Capitu again, I saw that she was not moving, and I was so afraid that I shook her gently. Capitu came back outside and asked me to tell him again what had happened with my mother. I satisfied her, softening the text this time, so as not to upset her. Call me not disingenuous, call me compassionate; It is true that I was afraid of losing Capitu if all her hopes died, but it pained me to see her suffer. Now, the ultimate truth, the truth of truths, is that I already regretted having told my mother, before any effective work on the part of José Dias; on closer inspection, I had not wanted to hear a disillusionment that I believed to be correct, even if it took a long time. Capitu reflected, reflected, reflected…","This took place so long ago that I cannot say with certainty whether she really cried or if she just wiped her eyes; I think she just wiped them. Seeing the gesture, I took her by the hand to cheer her up, but I, too, needed cheering. We slumped onto the sofa, and sat there staring into space. I’m lying: she was staring at the floor. I did the same thing, as soon as I saw her doing so … But I think that Capitu was looking inside herself, while I really was looking at the floor, the worm-eaten cracks, two flies crawling around, and a chipped chair-leg. It wasn’t much, but it took my mind off our troubles. When I looked at Capitu again, I saw that she was completely still, and became so frightened that I shook her gently. She came back to the surface and asked me to tell her again what had happened with my mother. I did as she asked, toning the story down this time, so as not to upset her. Don’t call me a dissembler, call me compassionate; it is true that I was afraid of losing Capitu, if all her hopes were ended, but it was painful to see her suffer. But the whole truth is that I already repented of having spoken to my mother, before any effective work on José Dias’ part; thinking about it, I wished I had not had the disappointment, even though I thought it inevitable: it might have been delayed. Capitu was reflecting, reflecting, reflecting…","This happened so long ago that I cannot say with certainty whether she actually cried or merely wiped her eyes; I think she just wiped them. On seeing her gesture I held her hand in order to cheer her up, but I, too, was in need of cheering up. We collapsed on to the sofa and stayed gazing into space. No, that’s a lie; she was gazing at the floor. When I saw what she was doing I did the same. But I think that Capitu was gazing within herself, whereas I was really looking at the floor, the worm-eaten cracks, two flies crawling about and a cracked chair leg. It was not much but enough to distract me from my misery. When I looked up again at Capitu I saw that she hadn’t moved, and I became so scared that I shook her gently. She came to herself and asked me to tell her once again all that had passed between my mother and myself. I did as she asked, this time moderating my account so as not to upset her. Do not accuse me of dissimulation, rather call me compassionate. It is true I was afraid of losing Capitu if all her hopes should be shattered, but it hurt me to see her suffering. However, the whole truth of the matter was that I already repented of having spoken to my mother before José Dias had had time to play his part. On further consideration, it was the fact of having met with a rebuff which, though I considered it certain, might have been delayed longer. Meanwhile Capitu sat there deep in thought."

"— Creio que sim; o mais acertado, porém, é dizer que foram os remédios indicados nos livros. Eles, sim, eles, abaixo de Deus.

They, yes, they, under God. I was a charlatan… Don't deny it; the motives for my course of action could and were worthy; homeopathy is the truth, and to serve the truth I lied; but it is time to restore everything.","“I believe so; it would be better however to say that I followed the remedies prescribed in the books. There, there lies the real truth, in the sight of God. I was a charlatan … No, don’t deny it; my motives may have been worthy—they were. Homeopathy is the truth, and I lied in the service of truth.

"Não consultes dicionários. Casmurro não está aqui no sentido que eles lhe dão, mas no que lhe pôs o vulgo de homem calado e metido consigo. Dom veio por ironia, para atribuir-me fumos de fidalgo.

Há livros que apenas terão isso dos seus autores; alguns nem tanto.","Do not consult dictionaries. Casmurro is not here in the sense they give it, but in what the alias of a quiet man put it to him. Dom came ironically, to give me a nobleman's smoke. All because you're dozing! I also couldn't find a better title for my narration; if you don't have another one by the end of the book, go for this one. My train poet will know that I don't hold a grudge against him. And with a little effort, as the title is yours, you can take care that the work is yours. There are books that will only have that from their authors; some not so much.","Don’t look it up in dictionaries. In this case, Casmurro doesn’t have the meaning they give, but the one the common people give it, of a quiet person who keeps himself to himself. The Dom was ironic, to accuse me of aristocratic pretensions. All because I nodded off! Still, I couldn’t find a better title for my narrative; if I can’t find another before I finish the book, I’ll keep this one. My poet on the train will find out that I bear him no ill will. And with a little effort, since the title is his, he can think the whole work is. There are books that only owe that to their authors: some not even that much.","Don’t bother to look it up in the dictionary. ‘Taciturn’ is used in the most usual sense of a man who says little and keeps to himself. ‘Lord’ is ironic, to endow me with aristocratic airs. All because I happened to doze off! Anyway I couldn’t find a better title for my story, and if I can’t think of one before the end of the book I’ll keep to this. My poet on the train will know that I bear him no ill will. And with a little imagination, since the title is his, he may come to think the book is his, too.

"Como vês, Capitu, aos catorze anos, tinha já ideias atrevidas, muito menos que outras que lhe vieram depois; mas eram só atrevidas em si, na prática faziam-se hábeis, sinuosas, surdas, e alcançavam o fim proposto, não de salto, mas aos saltinhos. Não sei se me explico bem. Suponde uma concepção grande executada por meios pequenos. Assim, para não sair do desejo vago e hipotético de me mandar para a Europa, Capitu, se pudesse cumpri-lo, não me faria embarcar no paquete e fugir; estenderia uma fila de canoas daqui até lá, por onde eu, parecendo ir à fortaleza da Laje em ponte movediça, iria realmente até Bordéus, deixando minha mãe na praia, à espera. Tal era a feição particular do caráter da minha amiga; pelo que, não admira que, combatendo os meus projetos de resistência franca, fosse antes pelos meios brandos, pela ação do empenho, da palavra, da persuasão lenta e diuturna, e examinasse antes as pessoas com quem podíamos contar. Rejeitou Tio Cosme; era um “boa-vida”; se não aprovava a minha ordenação, não era capaz de dar um passo para suspendê-la. Prima Justina era melhor que ele, e melhor que os dous seria o padre Cabral, pela autoridade, mas o padre não havia de trabalhar contra a Igreja; só se eu lhe confessasse que não tinha vocação…","As you can see, Capitu, at the age of fourteen, already had bold ideas, much less than others that came later; but they were only daring in themselves, in practice they became skillful, sinuous, deaf, and they reached the proposed end, not by jumping, but by jumping. I don't know if I explain myself well. It supposes a big conception executed by small means. So, in order not to leave the vague and hypothetical desire to send me to Europe, Capitu, if he could fulfill it, he would not make me board the steamer and flee; I would stretch a line of canoes from here to there, through which I, seeming to go to the Laje fortress on a shifting bridge, would actually go to Bordeaux, leaving my mother on the beach, waiting. Such was the particular feature of my friend's character; So it's no wonder that, in combating my projects of frank resistance, I went rather by soft means, by the action of commitment, of the word, of slow and daily persuasion, and rather examined the people on whom we could count. Rejected Uncle Cosme; it was a “good life”; if he did not approve of my ordination, he was not able to take a step to suspend it. Cousin Justina was better than him, and Father Cabral would be better than both, by authority, but the priest would not work against the Church; only if I confessed that I had no vocation...","As you see, Capitu, at the age of fourteen, already had some daring ideas, though much less daring than others she had later. But they were only daring in themselves: in practice they became clever, insinuating, stealthy, and reached the required end, not with a single bound, but with lots of little jumps. I don’t know if I make myself plain. Imagine a grand conception carried out with small means. Thus, staying with the vague, hypothetical desire to send me to Europe: Capitu, if it were in her power, would not have me embark on the steamer and flee; she would stretch a line of canoes from here to there, by means of which I, seeming to go to the Laje fortress * on a floating bridge, would actually go to Bordeaux, leaving my mother waiting for me on the beach. This was the peculiar nature of my friend’s character; so it is not surprising that, opposing my plans for open resistance, she went by milder means, persevering, with words, by slow, daily persuasion, and giving consideration first to the people we could count on. She rejected Uncle Cosme; he was all for an easy life, and even if he didn’t approve of my being ordained he would not stir himself to prevent it. Cousin, Justina was better than he, and better than either would be Father Cabral, who carried great authority. But the priest would do nothing against the interests of the Church; only if I confessed to him that I felt no vocation…","As can be seen, Capitu at fourteen already had extravagant ideas, though much fewer than in later days. But they only appeared to be extravagant; in practice they were clever, insinuating, secretive and achieved their purpose not in one fell swoop but little by little. I don’t know whether I am explaining myself very well. Without departing from her vague, hypothetical wish to send me to Europe, Capitu, if it were within her power, would not have me embark on a steamer and sail away; she would extend a line of canoes from here to there, over which floating bridge I would proceed apparently to the Laje Fortress but really to Bordeaux, leaving my mother waiting on the beach. Such was this particular feature of my friend’s character. So it is not surprising that she overcame my projected resistance by subtle means, by persistence, arguments and long-drawn-out persuasion, examining first of all those upon whom we could count. She rejected Uncle Cosme as too ‘easy-going’; if he didn’t approve of my ordination he wouldn’t lift a finger to prevent it. Cousin Justina was better than him, but better than both of them would be Father Cabral, who carried considerable authority. But the priest would do nothing against the Church; only if in confession I told him I had no vocation …"

"Nem por isso deixei de contar a Capitu a aprovação de Escobar. Ela sorriu e respondeu que os braços de Sanchinha eram malfeitos, mas cedeu depressa, e não foi ao baile; a outros foi, mas levou-os meio vestidos de escumilha ou não sei quê, que nem cobria nem descobria inteiramente, como o cendal de Camões.","That didn't stop me from telling Capitu of Escobar's approval. She smiled and replied that Sanchinha's arms were badly made, but she gave in quickly, and did not go to the dance; to others he went, but he took them half dressed in scum or I don't know what, which he neither completely covered nor uncovered, like Camões's cendal.","That didn’t stop me telling Capitu about Escobar’s agreement. She smiled and answered that Sanchinha’s arms were not shapely, but she soon gave way, and didn’t go to the ball. She went to others, but she went with them half-dressed in chiffon, or some such cloth, which neither covered nor uncovered them entirely, like Camōes’ veil. *","Nevertheless I couldn’t refrain from telling Capitu of Escobar’s approval.

"Já não tinha voz, mas teimava em dizer que a tinha. “O desuso é que me faz mal”, acrescentava. Sempre que uma companhia nova chegava da Europa, ia ao empresário e expunha-lhe todas as injustiças da terra e do céu; o empresário cometia mais uma, e ele saía a bradar contra a iniquidade. Trazia ainda os bigodes dos seus papéis. Quando andava, apesar de velho, parecia cortejar uma princesa de Babilônia. Às vezes, cantarolava, sem abrir a boca, algum trecho ainda mais idoso que ele ou tanto; vozes assim abafadas são sempre possíveis. Vinha aqui jantar comigo algumas vezes. Uma noite, depois de muito Chianti, repetiu-me a definição do costume, e como eu lhe dissesse que a vida tanto podia ser uma ópera, como uma viagem de mar ou uma batalha, abanou a cabeça e replicou:","He no longer had a voice, but he insisted on saying he had one. “Disuse is what makes me sick,” he added. Whenever a new company arrived from Europe, it went to the entrepreneur and exposed him to all the injustices of earth and heaven; the businessman would commit one more, and he would come out crying against iniquity. He still wore the mustaches of his papers. When he walked, in spite of his old age, he seemed to be courting a princess of Babylon. Sometimes he would hum, without opening his mouth, some passage even older than himself or so; such muffled voices are always possible. He used to come here for dinner with me a few times. One night, after a lot of Chianti, he repeated the customary definition to me, and when I told him that life could be an opera, a sea voyage or a battle, he shook his head and replied:","His voice had gone, but he insisted that it had not. “I’m out of practice, that’s the trouble,” he would add. Whenever a new company arrived from Europe, he went to the impresario and revealed all the injustices under the sun; whereupon the impresario perpetrated another, and out he came railing against such iniquity. He still sported the moustaches of his stage roles. His gait, even though he was old, made it look as if he was paying court to a Babylonian princess. Sometimes, he hummed, without opening his mouth, a passage as old as himself or older: if you sing that way, you can still delude yourself you have a voice. He used to come here to dine with me sometimes. One night, after a lot of Chianti, he repeated the usual definition, and when I said to him that life might just as well be a sea voyage or a battle as an opera, he shook his head and replied:","His voice had already gone, but he insisted that he had once had one. ‘ It’s lack of practice that’s bad for me,’ he used to add. Whenever a new company arrived from Europe he would go to the impresario and complain of all the injustices under the sun, whereupon the impresario would commit a further one, and he would storm out railing against unjust practices. He could remember snatches of his parts, and even when an old man he would sometimes appear to be courting a Babylonian princess. Occasionally, without opening his mouth, he would murmur some passage as old as, or even older than, himself. Sometimes he came here to dine with me. One night, after a generous helping of Chianti, he repeated his customary assertion, and when I said that life might just as well be a sea voyage or a battle as an opera, he shook his head and replied, ‘Life is an opera: a grand opera."
"Expliquei-lhe o motivo das férias. Contei-lhe também que o padre Cabral falara da minha entrada no seminário, apoiando a resolução de minha mãe, e disse dele cousas feias e duras. Capitu refletiu algum tempo, e acabou perguntando-me se podia ir cumprimentar o padre, à tarde, em minha casa.","I explained the reason for the vacation. I also told him that Father Cabral had talked about my entry into the seminary, supporting my mother's resolution, and said ugly and harsh things about him. Capitu reflected for a while, and ended up asking me if he could go and greet the priest at my house in the afternoon.","I explained the reason for the holiday. I also told her that Father Cabral had spoken of my going to the seminary, backing up my mother’s resolve, and I said some nasty, harsh things about him. Capitu thought for some time, and ended up asking me if she could go and pay her compliments to the priest that evening, at our house.","He gave me a holiday.’ I explained the reason for the holiday. I also told her that Father Cabral had spoken about my going to the seminary in support of my mother’s plans and said some bitter, rude things about him.

"Os amigos do maestro querem que dificilmente se possa achar obra tão bem-acabada. Um ou outro admite certas rudezas e tais ou quais lacunas, mas com o andar da ópera é provável que estas sejam preenchidas ou explicadas, e aquelas desapareçam inteiramente, não se negando o maestro a emendar a obra onde achar que não responde de todo ao pensamento sublime do poeta. Já não dizem o mesmo os amigos deste. Juram que o libreto foi sacrificado, que a partitura corrompeu o sentido da letra, e, posto seja bonita em alguns lugares, e trabalhada com arte em outros, é absolutamente diversa e até contrária ao drama. O grotesco, por exemplo, não está no texto do poeta; é uma excrescência para imitar as Mulheres patuscas de Windsor. Este ponto é contestado pelos satanistas com alguma aparência de razão. Dizem eles que, ao tempo em que o jovem Satanás compôs a grande ópera, nem essa farsa nem Shakespeare eram nascidos. Chegam a afirmar que o poeta inglês não teve outro gênio senão transcrever a letra da ópera, com tal arte e fidelidade, que parece ele próprio o autor da composição; mas, evidentemente, é um plagiário.","The maestro's friends want it to be difficult to find such a well-finished work. One or the other admits certain rudeness and such and such gaps, but as the opera progresses, it is likely that these will be filled in or explained, and those disappear entirely, the conductor not refusing to amend the work where he thinks it does not respond at all to the thought. sublime of the poet. His friends don't say the same anymore. They swear that the libretto was sacrificed, that the score corrupted the meaning of the lyrics, and, although it is beautiful in some places and artfully crafted in others, it is absolutely diverse and even contrary to drama. The grotesque, for example, is not in the poet's text; it's an outgrowth to imitate Windsor's Goofy Women. This point is disputed by Satanists with some semblance of reason. They say that at the time the young Satan composed the grand opera, neither this farce nor Shakespeare was born. They even say that the English poet had no other genius than to transcribe the lyrics of the opera, with such art and fidelity, that he himself seems to be the author of the composition; but evidently he is a plagiarist.","The composer’s friends assert that such a perfect work is not easily to be found. Some admit to a few blemishes and the odd thing missing, but it is probable that, as the opera proceeds, these latter will be filled in or explained, and the blemishes will disappear altogether: the composer has not discarded the idea of amending the work wherever he finds that it does not correspond completely to the poet’s sublime conception. But the poet’s friends do not agree. They maintain that the libretto has been sacrificed, that the music has distorted the meaning of the words, and though it may be beautiful in parts, and skilfully put together in others, it is completely different from the drama, even at variance with it. The element of the grotesque, for example, is not to be found in the poet’s text: it is an excrescence, put there to imitate The Merry Wives of Windsor. This point is contested by the satanists, with every appearance of reason. They say that, at the time when the young Satan composed his opera, neither Shakespeare nor his farce had been born. They go as far as to affirm that the English poet’s only genius was to transcribe the words of the opera, with such skill and so faithfully that he seems to be the author of the composition; but of course he is a plagiarist.","‘Friends of the composer declare that it would be difficult to find such perfection in any other work. One or other admits there are a few blemishes, a fault here or there, but claims that these will be put right or justified in time and will disappear altogether, the composer having the right to amend his work wherever he considers it does not correspond to the sublime inspiration of the poet. Apologists of the latter, however, do not agree. They maintain that the libretto has been unduly sacrificed, that the music has distorted the meaning of the words, and though it is attractive in some parts, and worked with art in others, it is utterly different from and even at variance with the drama itself. In the poet’s text there is no reference to the grotesque; this is an addition made in imitation of The Merry Wives of Windsor. This point is contested by the Satanists with every appearance of reason. They claim that at the time when Satan composed his grand opera neither this farce nor Shakespeare had been born. They even affirm that the English poet can claim no more than to have transcribed the libretto of the opera with such art and so faithfully that it seems he himself is the author; obviously though, it is plagiarized."

"O retrato de Escobar, que eu tinha ali, ao pé do de minha mãe, falou-me como se fosse a própria pessoa.

Sancha e Capitu eram tão amigas que seria um prazer mais para elas irem juntas. Quando houvesse alguma intenção sexual, quem me provaria que não era mais que uma sensação fulgurante, destinada a morrer com a noite e o sono?

"Mocetona é vulgar; José Dias achou melhor. Foi a única pessoa cá de baixo que nos visitou na Tijuca, levando abraços dos nossos e palavras suas, mas palavras que eram músicas verdadeiras; não as ponho aqui para ir poupando papel, mas foram deliciosas. Um dia, comparou-nos a aves criadas em dous vãos de telhado contíguos. Imagina o resto, as aves emplumando as asas e subindo ao céu, e o céu agora mais largo para poder contê-las também. Nenhum de nós riu; ambos escutávamos comovidos e convencidos, esquecendo tudo, desde a tarde de 1858… A felicidade tem boa alma.","Mocetone is common; José Dias thought it better. He was the only person from down here who visited us in Tijuca, taking hugs from us and his words, but words that were true songs; I don't put them here to save paper, but they were delicious.

"Rezei ainda, persignei-me, fechei o livro de missa e caminhei para a porta. A gente não era muita, mas a igreja também não é grande, e não pude sair logo, logo, mas devagar. Havia homens e mulheres, velhos e moços, sedas e chitas, e provavelmente olhos feios e belos, mas eu não vi uns nem outros. Ia na direção da porta, com a onda, ouvindo as saudações e os cochichos. No adro, onde se fez claro, parei e olhei para todos. Vi então uma moça e um homem, que saíam da igreja e pararam; e a moça olhava para mim falando ao homem, e o homem olhava para mim, ouvindo a moça. E chegaram-me estas palavras:","I still prayed, crossed myself, closed the Mass book and walked towards the door. There weren't many of us, but the church isn't big either, and I couldn't leave right away, but slowly. There were men and women, old and young, silks and calico, and probably ugly and beautiful eyes, but I didn't see either of them. She was heading for the door with the wave, hearing the greetings and the whispers. In the churchyard, where it became clear, I stopped and looked at everyone. Then I saw a girl and a man, who were leaving the church and stopped; and the girl looked at me talking to the man, and the man looked at me, listening to the girl. And these words came to me:","I prayed some more, crossed myself, shut my missal and went towards the door. There were not many people, but the church is not large either, so that I had to move slowly, and could not go straight out. There were men and women, old and young, silks and cheap cotton, and probably pretty eyes and ugly ones, but I saw neither one nor the other. I was going in the direction of the door, carried by the current, hearing the greetings and whispers of conversation. In the square in front of the church, where it was light, I stopped and looked at everyone. Then I saw a girl and a man, who were coming out and then stopped; the girl was looking at me and speaking to the man, and the man was looking at me, listening to the girl. I heard these words:","I concluded my prayers, crossed myself, closed my missal and walked towards the door. There were not many people, but the church itself was not large, so I was held up and could not get out right away. There were men and women, old and young, silks and cottons, and most likely pretty eyes and ugly ones, but I saw neither one nor the other. I was moving towards the door with the crowd, listening to greetings and whispers. In the churchyard, where it was brighter, I stopped and looked round. I saw a girl and a man who came out of the church and paused. The girl looked at me and spoke to the man, who glanced at me while listening to the girl. I managed to catch these words:"

"Querido opúsculo, tu não prestavas para nada, mas que mais presta um velho par de chinelas? Entretanto, há muita vez no casal de chinelas um como aroma e calor de dous pés. Gastas e rotas, não deixam de lembrar que uma pessoa as calçava de manhã, ao erguer da cama, ou as descalçava à noite, ao entrar nela. E se a comparação não vale, porque as chinelas são ainda uma parte da pessoa e tiveram o contato dos pés, aqui estão outras lembranças, como a pedra da rua, a porta da casa, um assobio particular, um pregão de quitanda, como aquele das cocadas que contei no capítulo XVIII. Justamente, quando contei o pregão das cocadas, fiquei tão curtido de saudades que me lembrou fazê-lo escrever por um amigo, mestre de música, e grudá-lo às pernas do capítulo. Se depois jarretei o capítulo, foi porque outro músico, a quem o mostrei, me confessou ingenuamente não achar no trecho escrito nada que lhe acordasse saudades. Para que não aconteça o mesmo aos outros profissionais que porventura me lerem, melhor é poupar ao editor do livro o trabalho e a despesa da gravura. Vês que não pus nada, nem ponho. Já agora creio que não basta que os pregões de rua, como os opúsculos de seminário, encerrem casos, pessoas e sensações; é preciso que a gente os tenha conhecido e padecido no tempo, sem o que tudo é calado e incolor.","Dear pamphlet, you were no good, but what good is an old pair of flip-flops? However, there is often in the pair of flip-flops an aroma and warmth from two feet. Worn and torn, they do not fail to remember that a person put them on in the morning, when getting out of bed, or took them off at night, when entering it. And if the comparison is not valid, because the flip-flops are still a part of the person and they had the contact of the feet, here are other memories, like the stone on the street, the door of the house, a private whistle, a street market, like that one of the cocadas I recounted in chapter XVIII. Precisely, when I told the preaching of the cocadas, I was so overcome with homesickness that I remembered having it written for a friend, a music master, and sticking it to the legs of the chapter. If I later scrambled the chapter, it was because another musician, to whom I showed it, naively confessed to me that he didn't find anything in the written passage that made him miss it. So that the same does not happen to other professionals who may read me, it is better to spare the book editor the work and expense of engraving. You can see that I didn't put anything, and I don't. By the way, I believe that it is not enough for street auctions, like seminary pamphlets, to contain cases, people and sensations; it is necessary that people have known and suffered them in time, without which everything is silent and colorless.","Dear little book, you were of no use at all, but then what use is an old pair of slippers? However, often in such slippers there is, as it were, the aroma and the warmth of two feet. Worn out and tattered, nonetheless they still remind us that someone put them on in the morning, when they got up, or took them off at night, when they went to bed again. And if this is not an apt comparison, because slippers are a part of the person, and had contact with the feet, here are other memories, like the stone in the street, the door to the house, a particular whistle, a street-seller’s refrain, like the one for coconut sweets that I told you of in Chapter XVIII. In fact, at the moment when I reproduced that cry, I was so overcome with nostalgia that I had the idea of having it written out by a friend of mine, a music teacher, and stuck on at the bottom of the chapter. If afterwards I deprived the chapter of this privilege, it was because another musician I showed it to naively confessed to me that he could find nothing in the transcription that made him feel nostalgic. So that the same thing doesn’t happen to other professionals who might read me, it’s best to save the book’s publisher the work and expense of the illustration. You’ve seen that I didn’t put anything in, nor will I. Now I believe that it is not enough for street cries, or pamphlets written in seminaries, to contain within them circumstances, people, and sensations; people must have known them and suffered them in reality: without that everything is silent and colorless.","Dear opusculum, you were intrinsically worth nothing, but then what is an old pair of slippers worth? Often there is in a pair of slippers an aroma and, as it were, warmth of two feet. Worn out and tattered, they still remind us that someone put them on in the morning as they got out bed or took them off at night getting into it. And if the comparison is not apt, since slippers are part of a person and have felt the contact of the feet, there are other remembrances, such as the stone from a street, the door of a house, a particular whistle, a pedlar’s cry, for instance, that of the cocada-seller I mentioned in Chapter 18. When I wrote of the cocadas song I was so overcome with nostalgia that I had it transposed by a friend who is a music teacher and thought of appending it to the end of the chapter. If later I changed my mind, it was because another musician to whom I showed it confessed that, frankly, he found nothing in the passage to awaken nostalgia. That the same thing may not happen again, it is best to spare this book’s publisher the expense of the engraving. You see that I have not appended anything, nor will I. I am convinced that it is not enough that street cries, like seminary opuscula, hold within them incidents, persons and sensations: it is necessary to have known them and experienced them at first hand – without that all is mute and colourless."

Escobar confessou esse acordo do interno com o externo, por palavras tão finas e altas que me comoveram; depois, a propósito da beleza moral que se ajusta à física, tornou a falar de minha mãe, “um anjo dobrado”, disse ele.","We walked to the bottom. We passed the washroom; he paused there for a moment, looking at the washing stone and reflecting on cleanliness; then we continue. What were the reflections I don't remember now; I just remember that I found them ingenious, and I laughed, he laughed too. My joy awakened his, and the sky was so blue, and the air so clear, that nature seemed to laugh with us too. Such are the good hours of this world. Escobar confessed this agreement between the internal and the external, in words so fine and loud that they moved me; then, on the subject of moral beauty that fits in with physics, he spoke again of my mother, “a bent angel,” he said.","We went towards the bottom of the garden. We went past the washing place; he stopped for a moment, looking at the stones for beating the clothes and making some reflections on cleanliness; then we went on. What reflections he made I cannot remember; I can only remember that I thought they were clever, I laughed, and so did he. My happiness brought his out, and the sky was so blue, the air so clear, that nature itself seemed to laugh with us. Happy times are like that. Escobar confessed to this harmony of the inner and outer worlds, in words so lofty and subtle that I was moved; then, concerning the accord between moral and physical beauty, he talked of my mother again: “a double angel,” he said.","We walked to the end of the grounds. We passed by the wash-house, and he paused a moment there to inspect the stone used for beating clothes and made some observations on hygiene before resuming our stroll. I don’t remember now what his observations were, only that they were ingenious and made me laugh, and he laughed, too. My own happiness awakened his; the sky was so blue, the air so clear, that nature seemed to laugh with us. Such are our happy hours in this world. Escobar explained this coincidence of the internal and external worlds in such exalted terms that I was deeply moved. Then, discussing the relationship of moral with physical beauty, he returned to my mother, calling her ‘twice an angel’."

"Fiquei pasmado. Considera que eram não menos de nove casas, e que os aluguéis variavam de uma para outra, indo de 70$000 a 180$000. Pois tudo isto em que eu gastaria três ou quatro minutos, — e havia de ser no papel, — fê-lo Escobar de cor, brincando. Olhando-me triunfalmente, e perguntava se não era exato. Eu, só por lhe mostrar que sim, tirei do bolso o papelinho que levava com a soma total, e mostrei-lho; era aquilo mesmo, nem um erro: 1:070$000.","I was amazed. It considers that there were no less than nine houses, and that the rents varied from one to another, ranging from 70$000 to 180$000. For all this, in which I would spend three or four minutes — and it would have to be on paper — made Escobar play by heart. Looking at me triumphantly, and wondering if it wasn't accurate. I, just to show him that I did, took out of my pocket the little piece of paper that I carried with the total sum, and showed it to him; it was just that, not a mistake: 1:070$000.","* I was astounded. Just think that there were no less than nine houses, and that the rents varied from 70 to 180 milreis. Well, all this that I would have spent three or four minutes doing—and on paper—Escobar did in his head, with no trouble at all. He looked at me in triumph, and asked if it wasn’t right. Just to prove the point, I took the piece of paper with the total sum out of my pocket, and showed it to him: exactly right, not the smallest mistake: 1,070.","I was thunderstruck. You must remember that there were no less than nine houses, and the rents varied from 70,000 réis to 180,000 réis. To do it would have taken me three or four minutes – and it would have had to be on paper – yet Escobar had done it in his head with no trouble. With a triumphant look he asked me whether that wasn’t right. Just to prove it so, I took from my pocket the scrap of paper on which I had written the total and showed it to him.

"Enxuguei os olhos e o nariz. Ela afagou-me, depois quis repreender-me, mas creio que a voz lhe tremia, e pareceu-me que tinha os olhos úmidos. Disse-lhe que também sentia a nossa separação. Negou que fosse separação; era só alguma ausência, por causa dos estudos; só os primeiros dias. Em pouco tempo eu me acostumaria aos companheiros e aos mestres, e acabaria gostando de viver com eles.","I wiped my eyes and nose. She patted me, then wanted to scold me, but I think her voice was trembling, and her eyes seemed to be wet. I told him that I felt our separation too.

In a short time I would get used to companions and masters, and I would come to enjoy living with them.","I wiped my eyes and nose. She caressed me, then tried to reproach me, but I think her voice was trembling, and her eyes looked moist. Then I said that I, too, was sad about our separation.

After the first few days, I would be fine: in no time I would get used to my classmates and teachers, and I would come to love my life with them.","I wiped my eyes and my nose. She caressed me and attempted a mild reproof, but I think her voice was unsteady and her eyes seemed wet. I told her that I, too, would feel our separation.

"Aproveitei o gesto para beijar-lhe a mão; estava ainda no seminário. Quando fui para São Paulo, querendo um dia relembrar a toada, vi que a ia perdendo inteiramente; consegui recordá-la e corri ao professor, que me fez o obséquio de a escrever no pedacinho de papel. Foi para não faltar ao juramento que fiz isto. Mas hás de crer que, quando corri aos papéis velhos, naquela noite da Glória, também me não lembrava já da toada nem do texto?

Capitu e prima Justina, que iam adiante, detiveram-se numa das voltas da praia, e fomos conversando os quatro; mas eu conversava mal. Não havia meio de esquecer inteiramente a mão de Sancha nem os olhos que trocamos. Agora achava-lhes isto, agora aquilo. Os instantes do diabo intercalavam-se nos minutos de Deus, e o relógio foi assim marcando alternativamente a minha perdição e a minha salvação. José Dias despediu-se de nós à porta. Prima Justina dormiu em nossa casa; iria embora, no dia seguinte, depois do almoço e da missa. Eu recolhi-me ao meu gabinete, onde me demorei mais que de costume.","You could hear the strong sea — as you could already hear from home — the undertow was big, and, in the distance, you could see the waves growing.

There was no way to entirely forget Sancha's hand or the eyes we exchanged. Now I found them this, now that. The devil's moments were interspersed with God's minutes, and the clock thus alternately marked my doom and my salvation. José Dias said goodbye to us at the door. Cousin Justina slept at our house; he would leave the next day, after lunch and mass. I retired to my office, where I lingered longer than usual.","We could hear the roaring sea—as one could hear it from the house too—there was a violent swell, and in the distance one could see the billowing waves.

There was no way of completely forgetting Sancha’s hand, nor the look we exchanged. First I thought of them in one way, then in another. God’s minutes were interrupted by the devil’s moments, and so the pendulum swung between my perdition and my salvation. José Dias said goodbye to us at our door.

I said little; I could not entirely forget Sancha’s hand, nor the looks we had exchanged. First I interpreted them one way, then another.

A distinção que tirou em todas as matérias é prova disso; já lhe contei que ouvi da boca dos lentes, em particular, os maiores elogios. Demais, a felicidade não é só a glória, é também outra cousa… Ah! Você não confiou tudo ao velho José Dias!

"A alegria com que pôs o seu chapéu de casada, e o ar de casada com que me deu a mão para entrar e sair do carro, e o braço para andar na rua, tudo me mostrou que a causa da impaciência de Capitu eram os sinais exteriores do novo estado. Não lhe bastava ser casada entre quatro paredes e algumas árvores; precisava do resto do mundo também. E quando eu me vi embaixo, pisando as ruas com ela, parando, olhando, falando, senti a mesma cousa. Inventava passeios para que me vissem, me confirmassem e me invejassem. Na rua, muitos voltavam a cabeça curiosos, outros paravam, alguns perguntavam: “Quem são?” e um sabido explicava: “Este é o dr. Santiago, que casou há dias com aquela moça, dona Capitolina, depois de uma longa paixão de crianças; moram na Glória, as famílias residem em Matacavalos”. E ambos os dous: “É uma mocetona!”.","The joy with which she put on her married hat, and the married look with which she gave me her hand to get in and out of the car, and her arm to walk down the street, all showed me that the cause of Capitu's impatience was the signs outside the new state. It wasn't enough for her to be married between four walls and a few trees; I needed the rest of the world too. And when I saw myself below, treading the streets with her, stopping, looking, talking, I felt the same thing. I invented tours so that they would see me, confirm me and envy me. On the street, many turned their heads curiously, others stopped, some asked: “Who are they?” and an acquaintance explained: “This is Dr. Santiago, who a few days ago married that girl, Dona Capitolina, after a long childhood passion; live in Glória, the families live in Matacavalos”. And both of them: ""It's a mocetona!"".","The contentment with which she put her married woman’s hat on, and the married woman’s air with which she gave me her hand when she got into or out of the carriage, or her arm to walk in the street, all showed me that the cause of Capitu’s impatience were the external signs of her new state. It was not enough for her to be married between four walls and a few trees: she needed the rest of the world, too. And when I found myself down in town again, walking the streets with her, stopping, looking, talking, I felt the same thing. I invented walks so that I could be seen, recognized, and envied. In the street, many turned their heads around in curiosity, others stopped, and some asked: “Who are they?”. Some knowing person would reply: “That’s Dr. Santiago, who married that young lady there a few days ago: she’s Dona Capitolina. They married after a long childhood romance; they live in Glória, and their families reside on Matacavalos.” Then both would say: “She’s a fine figure of a woman!”","The pleasure with which she put on her married woman’s hat, and the matrimonial air with which she gave me her hand to step in or out of the carriage or her arm for walking in the street, all this convinced me that the reason for Capitu’s impatience was the outward display of her new condition. It wasn’t enough to be married between four walls and one or two trees; she needed the rest of the world, too. And when I found myself back home, walking the streets with her, pausing, gazing, talking, I felt the same thing. I suggested outings so that I should be seen, recognized and envied. In the street many would look back at us with curiosity, others would stop, and some would ask, ‘Who are they?’ And one more knowledgeable would answer, ‘That’s Dr Santiago and Dona Capitolina. They were married a few days ago after being in love since they were children. They live in Glória and their families in Matacavalos.’ Then they would add, ‘She’s a strapping lass.’"
"Um cochilo da fé teria resolvido a questão a meu favor, mas a fé velava com os seus grandes olhos ingênuos. Minha mãe faria, se pudesse, uma troca de promessa, dando parte dos seus anos para conservar-me consigo, fora do clero, casado e pai; é o que presumo, assim como suponho que rejeitou tal ideia, por lhe parecer uma deslealdade. Assim a senti sempre na corrente da vida ordinária.","A nap of faith would have settled the matter in my favor, but faith watched over with its big naive eyes. My mother would, if she could, make an exchange of promises, giving part of her years to keep me with her, outside the clergy, married and father; that's what I assume, just as I suppose you rejected the idea, as it seemed to you to be disloyal. So I always felt it in the current of ordinary life.","If faith had nodded for a moment, that might have resolved the matter in my favor, but faith kept watch with her wide, naive eyes. My mother, had she been able, would have exchanged her original promise for another, giving part of her own life to keep me with her, out of the clergy, married, and a father; that’s what I presume, just as I suppose that she rejected the idea as disloyal. That is how I understood her in her daily life.","The tiniest lapse in her steadfastness might have resolved the issue in my favour, but faith was there on guard with its wide, ingenuous eyes. Had she been able, my mother would have changed her promise, sacrificing a portion of her years to keep me with her, out of the Church, married and a father. That at least is what I presume, as I also presume she rejected the idea as being disloyal. This was my constant impression during our day-to-day life."

"Velha é a casa, mas não lhe alteraram nada. Não sei até se ainda tem o mesmo número. Não digo que número é para não irem indagar e cavar a história. Não é que Escobar ainda lá more nem sequer viva; morreu pouco depois, por um modo que hei de contar. Enquanto viveu, uma vez que estávamos tão próximos, tínhamos por assim dizer uma só casa, eu vivia na dele, ele na minha, e o pedaço de praia entre a Glória e o Flamengo era como um caminho de uso próprio e particular. Fazia-me pensar nas duas casas de Matacavalos, com o seu muro de permeio.","The house is old, but nothing has been changed. I don't even know if it still has the same number. I don't say what number it is so they won't go and dig into the story. It's not that Escobar still lives there or even lives there; died shortly afterwards, by a way that I will tell. While he lived, since we were so close, we had only one house, so to speak, I lived in his, he in mine, and the stretch of beach between Glória and Flamengo was like a path for his own and private use. It made me think of the two houses in Matacavalos, with their wall in between.","The house is old, but it hasn’t been altered at all. I don’t know if it still has the old number. I won’t reveal it, so that no one can go and dig out the story. Not that Escobar lives there still, or is even alive; he died a little later, as I will recount. While he was alive, since we were so close, we had, so to speak, only one house; I lived in his house, he in mine, and the stretch of beach between Glória and Flamengo was like a private right of way, for our use alone. It made me think of the two houses on Matacavalos, with the wall between them.","It is an old house, but nothing has been changed. I don’t even know whether it still has the same number, and I shan’t say what it is so that people won’t go there to dig up the story. Not that Escobar still lives there or is even still alive; he died shortly afterwards in a manner I shall describe. While he was alive, being so close, it was as though we had a single house: I lived in his, he in mine, and the stretch of beach between Glória and Flamengo was like a private footpath for our own exclusive use. It reminded me of the two houses in Matacavalos and their dividing wall."
"— Em todo caso, vai sendo tempo, interrompeu minha mãe; vou tratar de metê-lo no seminário quanto antes.","— In any case, it's time, interrupted my mother; I'll try to get him into the seminary as soon as possible.","“In any case, time’s getting on,” interrupted my mother, “I’ll go about putting him into the seminary straight away.”","‘In any case, it’s time he went,’ interrupted my mother. ‘I’ll see about sending him to the seminary right away.’"
"— Não sabe? São contos, naturalmente; mas enfim, o dr. João da Costa enviuvou há poucos meses, e dizem (não sei, o protonotário é que me contou) dizem que os dous andam meio inclinados a acabar com a viuvez, entre si, casando-se. Há de ver que não há nada, mas não é fora de propósito, conquanto ela sempre achasse que o doutor era um feixe de ossos… Só se ela é um cemitério, comentou rindo; e logo sério: Digo isto por gracejo…","- Do not know? They are tales, of course; but anyway, dr. João da Costa became a widow a few months ago, and they say (I don't know, the protonotary told me) they say that the two are half inclined to end their widowhood, among themselves, by getting married. You can see that there's nothing, but it's not out of the question, although she always thought the doctor was a bundle of bones… Only if she's a cemetery, he commented, laughing; and then seriously: I say this as a joke…","“Don’t you know? It’s only gossip, of course; but anyway, Dr. João da Costa lost his wife a few months ago, and they say—I don’t know, the protonotary told me—they say that the two of them are half inclined to leave widowhood behind and get married again. It might turn out to be nothing, but it might suit, even though she always thought the doctor was a bag of bones … Only if she’s a cemetery,” he commented laughing; then seriously: “I only say that in fun …”","‘Didn’t you know? Of course it’s only gossip, but Dr João da Costa’s wife died some months ago, and they say – I can’t be sure , it was the Protonotary told me – they say that the two of them are half inclined to end each other’s widowhood by getting married. I suppose it will all come to nothing, but you never know. She always used to say that the doctor was a bag of bones. If so, then she’s a cemetery,’ he added, with a laugh. Then, more seriously, he said, ‘I was only joking.’"
— Também não.,- Neither.,“Yes.”,‘Yes.’
"— Não, Bentinho, não é preciso isso. Há melhor, — não digo melhor, porque o Santo Padre vale sempre mais que tudo, — mas há cousa que produz o mesmo efeito.","— No, Bentinho, that's not necessary. There are better — I don't say better, because the Holy Father is always worth more than anything — but there are things that have the same effect.","“No, Bentinho, that’s not necessary. There’s a better way—not better, because the Holy Father is always better than anything—but there’s something that will produce the same effect.”","Suddenly I saw his face light up as an idea sprang to mind, and he said quickly, ‘No, Bentinho, that won’t be necessary. There is a better way – no, I won’t say better, because the Holy Father is always the best of all, but there is something else which will produce the same effect.’"
— Eu bem. José Dias ainda não falou?,- I well. Hasn't José Dias spoken yet?,“Fine. Has José Dias not spoken yet?”,‘All right. Hasn’t José Dias spoken yet?’
"Na sala de visitas, Tio Cosme e José Dias conversavam, um sentado, outro andando e parando. A vista de José Dias lembrou-me o que ele me dissera no seminário: “Aquilo enquanto não pegar algum peralta da vizinhança que case com ela…”. Era certamente alusão ao cavaleiro. Tal recordação agravou a impressão que eu trazia da rua; mas não seria essa palavra, inconscientemente guardada, que me dispôs a crer na malícia dos seus olhares? A vontade que tive foi pegar em José Dias pela gola, levá-lo ao corredor e perguntar-lhe se falara de verdade ou por hipótese; mas José Dias, que parara ao ver-me entrar, continuou a andar e a falar. Eu, impaciente, queria ir à casa ao pé, imaginava que Capitu saísse da janela assustada e não tardasse a aparecer, para indagar e explicar… E os dous falavam, até que Tio Cosme ergueu-se para ir ver a doente, e José Dias veio ter comigo, ao vão da outra janela.","In the living room, Tio Cosme and José Dias were talking, one sitting, the other walking and stopping. The sight of José Dias reminded me of what he had said to me at the seminar: “As long as you don't get some crook in the neighborhood to marry her…”. It was certainly an allusion to the knight. This recollection aggravated the impression I had of the street; but wouldn't it be that word, unconsciously guarded, that made me believe in the malice of her eyes? The urge I had was to take José Dias by the collar, take him to the hallway and ask him if he had really spoken or by chance; but José Dias, who had stopped when he saw me enter, continued walking and talking. I, impatient, wanted to go to the house close by, I imagined that Capitu would leave the window, scared and would not take long to appear, to inquire and explain... And the two talked, until Tio Cosme got up to go see the patient, and José Dias came to me at the other window.","In the living room Uncle Cosme and José Dias were talking, the one seated, the other walking up and down and stopping from time to time. Seeing José Dias reminded me of what he had said to me at the seminary: “Just waiting to find some local beau to marry her …” Of course it was an allusion to the man on horseback. This recollection worsened the impression I’d had in the street; or was it rather those words, stored in the unconscious, that made me see the cunning in their eyes? I had the desire to grab José Dias by the collar, take him into the corridor and ask him if he had spoken of a reality or only a hypothesis; but José Dias, who had stopped when he saw me come in, went on walking and talking. I was impatient, and wanted to go next door; I imagined that Capitu would come away from the window alarmed and would not be long in appearing, to ask what had happened and explain … And the two went on talking, until Uncle Cosme got up to go and see the invalid, and José Dias came over to me, in the other window recess.","In the living-room Uncle Cosme and José Dias were talking, the one sitting down, the other walking up and down and halting. Seeing José Dias reminded me of what he had said at the seminary: ‘That girl, if she doesn’t get some young buck in the neighbourhood to marry her …’ It was obviously an allusion to the horseman. This memory exacerbated the impression I had brought with me from the street; could it not have been those words, retained in my subconscious, that had made me see wantonness in her looks? I felt like seizing José Dias by his lapels, dragging him into the corridor and demanding to know whether what he had spoken had been the truth or mere supposition. But José Dias, who had halted on seeing me come in, continued to walk up and down while talking. In my impatience I wanted to go next door, imagining that Capitu, alarmed, would leave the window and soon make an appearance to enquire and explain … The two went on talking until finally Uncle Cosme got up to go and see the invalid, and José Dias came over to me by the window."
"— Se eu quiser? Mas que outra cousa quero eu, senão servi-lo? Que desejo, senão que seja feliz, como merece?","- If I want? But what else do I want but to serve him? What do I want but to be happy, as you deserve?","“If I want? But what else do I want, but to be of service to you? What can I desire but for you to be happy, as you deserve?”","‘If I am willing? What else could I want but to be of service to you? What do I seek if not to see you happy, as you deserve?’"
"A sege ia tanto com a vida recôndita de minha mãe, que quando já não havia nenhuma outra, continuamos a andar nela, e era conhecida na rua e no bairro pela “sege antiga”. Afinal minha mãe consentiu em deixá-la, sem a vender logo; só abriu mão dela porque as despesas de cocheira a obrigaram a isso. A razão de a guardar inútil foi exclusivamente sentimental; era a lembrança do marido. Tudo o que vinha de meu pai era conservado como um pedaço dele, um resto da pessoa, a mesma alma integral e pura. Mas o uso, esse era filho também do carrancismo que ela confessava aos amigos. Minha mãe exprimia bem a fidelidade aos velhos hábitos, velhas maneiras, velhas ideias, velhas modas. Tinha o seu museu de relíquias, pentes desusados, um trecho de mantilha, umas moedas de cobre datadas de 1824 e 1825, e, para que tudo fosse antigo, a si mesma se queria fazer velha; mas já deixei dito que, neste ponto, não alcançava tudo o que queria.","The sege was so close to my mother's hidden life that when there was no other, we continued to walk in it, and it was known on the street and in the neighborhood as the “old sege”. At last my mother consented to leave her, without selling her right away; she only gave it up because the stable expenses forced her to do so. The reason for keeping it useless was purely sentimental; it was her husband's memory. Everything that came from my father was kept as a piece of him, a remnant of the person, the same whole and pure soul. But the use, that was also the son of the frown that she confessed to her friends. My mother was a good expression of fidelity to old habits, old ways, old ideas, old fashions. It had its museum of relics, out-of-date combs, a piece of a mantilla, some copper coins dating from 1824 and 1825, and, in order for everything to be old, it wanted to make itself old; but I've already said that, at this point, I didn't achieve everything I wanted.","The chaise went so well with my mother’s secluded life, that when there were no others left in Rio, we continued to go about in it, and it was known in the street and the neighborhood as the “old chaise.” In the end my mother consented to us abandoning it, though it was not sold at once; she only let it go because the stabling costs forced her to it. The reason for keeping it when it was of no use was purely sentimental: her husband’s memory. Everything that had belonged to my father was kept as if it were part of him, a remnant of him, the unsullied, pure soul of the man. But these habits were also the fruit of a conservatism which she admitted to her friends. My mother well expressed this faithfulness to old habits, old ways, old ideas, old fashions. She had her museum of relics, disused combs, a piece of a mantilla, some copper coins dated 1824 and 1825, and, so that everything should be ancient, she tried to make herself old; but I have already said that, in this respect, she did not achieve all she wanted.","The tilbury suited my mother’s withdrawn habits so well that when we had no other carriage we continued to use this one, which became known in our street and in the neighbourhood as ‘the old tilbury’. Finally my mother agreed to get rid of it, but she only did so when the expense of its upkeep forced her to sell it. Her reason for keeping it on unused was purely sentimental: it was a memento of her husband. Everything that had been my father’s was kept as if it were a piece of himself, a remnant of him, imbued with his own virtue and integrity. But its use was also determined by her excessive conservatism, as she freely admitted to her friends. My mother openly displayed her fondness for old habits, old customs, old manners, old ideas, old fashions. She had her own museum of relics – disused combs, a piece of lace, some copper coins dated 1824 and 1825 – and so that everything should be equally antiquated she attempted to make herself look old, but, as I have said, in this respect the result was not entirely to her satisfaction."

"Tais são os principais rasgos da infância: mais um e acabo o capítulo. Um dia, na chácara de Escobar, deu com um gato que tinha um rato atravessado na boca. O gato nem deixava a presa, nem via por onde fugisse. Ezequiel não disse nada, deteve-se, acocorou-se, e ficou olhando. Ao vê-lo assim atento, perguntamos-lhe de longe o que era; fez-nos sinal que nos calássemos. Escobar concluiu:","Such are the main features of childhood: one more and the chapter is over.

"A nossa vida era mais ou menos plácida. Quando não estávamos com a família ou com amigos, ou se não íamos a algum espetáculo ou serão particular (e estes eram raros) passávamos as noites à nossa janela da Glória, mirando o mar e o céu, a sombra das montanhas e dos navios, ou a gente que passava na praia. Às vezes, eu contava a Capitu a história da cidade, outras dava-lhe notícias de astronomia; notícias de amador que ela escutava atenta e curiosa, nem sempre tanto que não cochilasse um pouco. Não sabendo piano, aprendeu depois de casada, e depressa, e daí a pouco tocava nas casas de amizade. Na Glória era uma das nossas recreações; também cantava, mas pouco e raro, por não ter voz; um dia chegou a entender que era melhor não cantar nada e cumpriu o alvitre. De dançar gostava, e enfeitava-se com amor quando ia a um baile; os braços é que… Os braços merecem um período.","Our life was more or less placid. When we weren't with family or friends, or if we weren't going to a show or a private evening (and these were rare) we spent the nights at our Gloria window, looking at the sea and the sky, the shadows of the mountains and the ships, or people passing by on the beach. Sometimes I would tell Capitu the history of the city, other times I would give her astronomy news; amateur news that she listened attentively and curiously, not always so much that she didn't take a nap. Not knowing piano, she learned it after she was married, and quickly, and soon she played in the houses of friendship. In Gloria it was one of our recreations; he also sang, but little and rarely, as he had no voice; one day he came to understand that it was better not to sing at all and he fulfilled his advice. He liked to dance, and he adorned himself with love when he went to a ball; it's arms that... Arms deserve a spell.","Our life was more or less placid.

Sometimes, I would recount the history of the city to Capitu, or tell her about astronomy; an amateur’s gleanings, which she listened to attentively, not that she didn’t nod off a little sometimes. Since she couldn’t play the piano, she learned after our marriage, so fast that quite soon she would play in friends’ houses. In Glória it was one of our amusements; she sang, too, but not much and not often, because she hadn’t a good voice; one day, she realized that it was better to give up, and kept her resolution. She enjoyed dancing, and adorned herself with loving care when she was going to a ball. Her arms … Her arms are worth a sentence or two.","But this didn’t last long. We lived a quiet life.

Sometimes I would tell Capitu the history of the city, at others I’d talk about astronomy – amateurish facts which she listened to with eagerness and curiosity, though not so much as to prevent her dozing off occasionally. As she couldn’t play the piano she decided to learn after her marriage, and she did this so quickly that soon she was playing in the houses of our friends. It was one of our pastimes in Glória. She sang, too, but very little and not often, having no voice for it. One day she realized that it would be better not to sing at all and gave it up.

"Capitu ia agora entrando na alma de minha mãe. Viviam o mais do tempo juntas, falando de mim, a propósito do sol e da chuva, ou de nada; Capitu ia lá coser, às manhãs; alguma vez ficava para jantar.","Capitu was now entering my mother's soul. They lived together most of the time, talking about me, about sun and rain, or nothing; Capitu used to go there to sew in the mornings; would ever stay for dinner.","Capitu was finding her way into my mother’s heart. They spent most of the time together, talking about me apropos of the sun and the rain, or apropos of nothing at all; Capitu went there to sew in the mornings; sometimes she stayed for dinner.","Capitu was now winning my mother’s heart. They spent most of their time together, talking about me or the sun and the rain or about nothing at all. In the morning Capitu went there to sew and sometimes stayed for dinner."
"— Fique aqui um bocadinho, disse-lhe ele; e voltando-se para mim: É a enfermeira de Sancha, que não quer outra; eu já volto.","—Stay here a little, he told her; and turning to me: It's Sancha's nurse, who doesn't want another one; I'll be right back.","“Stay here for a while,” he said to her, and turning to me: “She’s Sancha’s nurse, and she’ll have no other; I’ll be back in a moment.”","‘Stay here a moment,’ he said, turning to me. ‘This is Sancha’s nurse. She won’t have any other. I’ll be back soon.’"

— Oh! Bentinho! interrompeu o agregado. Pensar em quê? Você o que quer… Digo? Não se amofina com o seu velho? Você o que quer é consultar a uma pessoa.,— Oh! Bentinho! interrupted the aggregate. Think about what? What do you want… I mean? Don't you fret over your old man? What you want is to consult a person.,"“Better say something next Sunday; let me think it over first …” “Oh, Bentinho!” the dependent interrupted. “Think what over? What you really want … Should I say it? You won’t be upset with your old friend? What you want to do is consult a certain person.”","Let me think about it first …’ ‘Oh, Bentinho!’ he interrupted. ‘What is there to think about? What you mean is … Shall I say it? You won’t be cross with your old friend? What you mean is that you want to ask someone’s advice.’"
"Não gostei da convicção. Assim lho disse, na manhã seguinte, no quintal dela, recordando as palavras da véspera, e lançando-lhe em rosto, pela primeira vez, a alegria que ela mostrara desde a minha entrada no seminário, quando eu vivia curtido de saudades. Capitu fez-se muito séria, e perguntou-me como é que queria que se portasse, uma vez que suspeitavam de nós; também tivera noites desconsoladas, e os dias, em casa dela, foram tão tristes como os meus; podia indagá-lo do pai e da mãe. A mãe chegou a dizer-lhe, por palavras encobertas, que não pensasse mais em mim.","I didn't like the conviction. So I told her the following morning, in her backyard, remembering the words of the day before, and throwing in her face, for the first time, the joy she had shown since my entry into the seminary, when I was always feeling homesick. Capitu became very serious, and asked me how I wanted her to behave, since they suspected us; I had also had disconsolate nights, and the days at her house were as sad as mine; I could ask him about his father and mother. His mother even told him, in covert words, not to think about me anymore.","I did not approve of her conviction. I told her so, the next morning, in her yard, reminding her of the words of the previous day, and confronting her for the first time with the happiness she had shown since my going to the seminary, while I was tormented with longing. Capitu became very serious, and asked how I would have her act, seeing they suspected us; she too had had disconsolate nights, and the days in her house were as sad as mine; I could go and ask her father and mother. Her mother had gone as far as to tell her, indirectly, that she should give up all thought of me.","I didn’t like that conviction. I told her so the following morning in the yard, reminding her of what she had said the day before and for the first time taxing her with the cheerfulness she had displayed ever since I had gone to the seminary, while I was miserable and homesick. Looking very serious, Capitu asked me how I thought she ought to behave since they were all suspicious of us. She also passed miserable nights, and the days she spent at home were as miserable as mine – I could ask her father and mother. Her mother had gone so far as to hint that she should give up thinking of me."
"Era o discurso. Queriam o discurso. Tinham jus ao discurso anunciado. Maquinalmente, meti a mão no bolso, saquei o papel e li-o aos trambolhões, não todo, nem seguido, nem claro; a voz parecia-me entrar em vez de sair, as mãos tremiam-me. Não era só a emoção nova que me fazia assim, era o próprio texto, as memórias do amigo, as saudades confessadas, os louvores à pessoa e aos seus méritos; tudo isto que eu era obrigado a dizer e dizia mal. Ao mesmo tempo, temendo que me adivinhassem a verdade, forcejava por escondê-la bem. Creio que poucos me ouviram, mas o gesto geral foi de compreensão e de aprovação. As mãos que me deram a apertar eram de solidariedade; alguns diziam: “Muito bonito! Muito bem! Magnífico!”. José Dias achou que a eloquência estivera na altura da piedade. Um homem, que me pareceu jornalista, pediu-me licença para levar o manuscrito e imprimi-lo. Só a minha grande turvação recusaria um obséquio tão simples.","It was the speech. They wanted the speech. They were entitled to the announced speech. Mechanically, I put my hand in my pocket, took out the paper and read it in a tumble, not all of it, not straight, not clear; the voice seemed to go in instead of out, my hands were shaking. It wasn't just the new emotion that made me like this, it was the text itself, the friend's memories, the confessed nostalgia, the praise of the person and his merits; all this that I was forced to say and said wrongly. At the same time, fearing that the truth would be guessed at me, I tried hard to hide it well. I believe that few listened to me, but the general gesture was one of understanding and approval. The hands I was given to shake were of solidarity; some said, “Very beautiful! Very well! Magnificent!"". José Dias thought that eloquence was at the height of piety. A man, who seemed to me a journalist, asked if he could take the manuscript and print it. Only my great confusion would refuse such a simple gift.","It was the speech. They wanted the speech. They had a right to the advertized speech. Mechanically, I put my hand in my pocket, took out the paper and read it stumblingly, not all of it, not in order and not clearly; my voice seemed to be going back into my mouth instead of coming out of it, and my hands were trembling. Nor was it only the new emotion that affected me in this way, it was the text itself, the memories of my friend, my affection for him, my praise of the man and his merits; all these things I was obliged to say and said badly. At the same time, fearing that they might suspect the truth, I was struggling to hide it. I think that few heard me, but the general reaction was of understanding and approval. The hands that stretched out to shake mine expressed fellow feeling; some said: “Very fine! well said! magnificent!” José Dias thought that my eloquence had been in keeping with the emotion of the occasion. A man, who seemed to be a journalist, asked my permission to take the manuscript and publish it. Only my great inner turmoil can explain my refusing such a simple request.","They wanted the speech. They had a right to hear the speech, which had been announced. Automatically I put my hand in my pocket, took out the paper and read it in fits and starts, not all of it, nor in the right order, nor clearly. I seemed to swallow my voice instead of speaking, and my hands were trembling. It was not just newly awakened emotion that caused this; it was the text itself, the references to my friend, my memories of him, my tribute to his person and his merits. This is what I had to say, and I said it badly. At the same time, fearful that they might guess the truth, I did my best to keep it well concealed. I think only a few heard what I said, but the general reaction was of understanding and approval. The handshakes I received were congratulatory. Some said, ‘Fine! Very good! Magnificent!’ José Dias thought that my words were suited to the sadness of the occasion. A man, who seemed to be a journalist, asked permission to take the manuscript and have it printed. Only my extreme agitation could explain my refusal of so simple a request."
"Tudo isto me era agora apresentado pela boca de José Dias, que me denunciara a mim mesmo, e a quem eu perdoava tudo, o mal que dissera, o mal que fizera, e o que pudesse vir de um e de outro. Naquele instante, a eterna Verdade não valeria mais que ele, nem a eterna Bondade, nem as demais Virtudes eternas. Eu amava Capitu! Capitu amava-me! E as minhas pernas andavam, desandavam, estacavam, trêmulas e crentes de abarcar o mundo. Esse primeiro palpitar da seiva, essa revelação da consciência a si própria, nunca mais me esqueceu, nem achei que lhe fosse comparável qualquer outra sensação da mesma espécie. Naturalmente por ser minha. Naturalmente também por ser a primeira.","All this was now presented to me through the mouth of José Dias, who had denounced me to myself, and to whom I forgave everything, the evil I had said, the evil I had done, and whatever could come from one or the other. At that moment, the eternal Truth would not be worth more than he, nor the eternal Goodness, nor the other eternal Virtues. I loved Capitu! Capitu loved me! And my legs walked, walked, stopped, trembling and believing in embracing the world. That first throb of the sap, that revelation of consciousness to itself, I never forgot, nor did I think any other sensation of the same kind was comparable to it. Of course because it's mine. Of course also for being the first.","All of this had now been revealed to me by the mouth of José Dias, who had denounced me to myself, and whom I forgave everything, the evil he had spoken, the evil he had done, and anything that might come of these things. At that moment, eternal Truth itself, eternal Goodness, and all the other eternal Virtues were worth less to me than he was. I loved Capitu! Capitu loved me! And my legs strode back and forth, stopped still, tremulous, certain that they bestrode the whole world. That first throbbing of the sap, that revelation of consciousness to itself, is something I have never forgotten, nor have I ever had a comparable sensation. Naturally because it was mine. Naturally, too, because it was the first.","All this was now made clear through the mouth of José Dias, who had denounced me to myself and whom I forgave everything, the evil he had spoken, the evil he had done and whatever might arise from one or the other. At that moment I valued Eternal Truth no more than I did him or Eternal Goodness or all the other Eternal Virtues. I loved Capitu! Capitu loved me! My legs strode back and forth and halted, trembling, confident of bestriding the whole world. This first pulsing of the blood, this revelation of my own self, was something never to be forgotten, nor did I ever experience any comparable sensation. Naturally because it happened to me. Naturally because it was the first time."
"— Um favor? Mande, ordene, que é?","- A favor? Command, order, what is it?","“A favor? Ask me, order me. What is it?”","‘A favour? Speak up. Tell me, what is it?’"
"Capitu não achava outra ideia, nem acabava de adotar esta. De caminho, pediu-me que, se acaso fosse a Roma, jurasse que no fim de seis meses estaria de volta.","Capitu didn't think of another idea, nor had she just adopted this one. On the way, he asked me, if I ever went to Rome, to swear that at the end of six months I would be back.","Capitu could think of no other way, but neither could she persuade herself to adopt this one. In any case, she asked me, if I did go to Rome, to swear that I would be back in six months.","Capitu could think of no other plan, but neither did she adopt this one. She asked me, if by chance I should go to Rome, to swear to be back inside six months."
"No intervalo, evocara as palavras do finado Gurgel, quando me mostrou em casa dele o retrato da mulher, parecido com Capitu. Hás de lembrar-te delas; se não, relê o capítulo, cujo número não ponho aqui, por não me lembrar já qual seja, mas não fica longe. Reduzem-se a dizer que há tais semelhanças inexplicáveis… Pelo dia adiante, e nos outros dias, Ezequiel ia ter comigo ao gabinete, e as feições do pequeno davam ideia clara das do outro, ou eu ia atentando mais nelas. De envolta, lembravam-me episódios vagos e remotos, palavras, encontros e incidentes, tudo em que a minha cegueira não pôs malícia, e a que faltou o meu velho ciúme. Uma vez em que os fui achar sozinhos e calados, um segredo que me fez rir, uma palavra dela sonhando, todas essas reminiscências vieram vindo agora, em tal atropelo que me atordoaram… E por que os não enganei um dia, quando desviei os olhos da rua onde estavam duas andorinhas trepadas no fio telegráfico? Dentro, as minhas outras andorinhas estavam trepadas no ar, os olhos enfiados nos olhos, mas tão cautelosos que se desenfiaram logo, dizendo-me uma palavra amiga e alegre. Contei-lhes o namoro das andorinhas de fora, e acharam-lhe graça; Escobar declarou que, para ele, seria melhor se as andorinhas, em vez de trepadas no fio de arame, estivessem à mesa do jantar cozidas. “Nunca comi os ninhos delas, continuou, mas devem ser bons, se os chins os inventaram.” E ficamos a tratar dos chins e dos clássicos que falaram deles, enquanto Capitu, confessando que a aborrecíamos, foi a outros cuidados. Agora lembrava-me tudo o que então me pareceu nada.","During the break, I had evoked the words of the late Gurgel, when he showed me at his house the portrait of his wife, resembling Capitu. You will remember them; if not, reread the chapter, whose number I don't put here, because I don't remember what it is, but it's not far. They can be reduced to saying that there are such inexplicable similarities… For the next day, and the other days, Ezequiel would meet me in the study, and the little one's features gave a clear idea of the other's, or I paid more attention to them. All around, I remembered vague and remote episodes, words, encounters and incidents, all of which my blindness did not bring malice, and which my old jealousy lacked. Once I went to find them alone and silent, a secret that made me laugh, a word from her dreaming, all these reminiscences came coming now, in such a rush that they stunned me... And why didn't I deceive them one day, when I averted my eyes from the street where two swallows were perched on the telegraph wire? Inside, my other swallows were perched in the air, their eyes locked into each other's eyes, but so cautious that they quickly untied themselves, saying a friendly, cheerful word to me. I told them about the courtship of the swallows outside, and they found it amusing; Escobar declared that, for him, it would be better if the swallows, instead of climbing on the wire, were cooked at the dinner table. ""I've never eaten their nests,"" he continued, but they must be good, if the Chinese invented them."" And we left to deal with the Chinese and the classics who spoke about them, while Capitu, confessing that we annoyed her, went to other cares. Now I remembered everything that then seemed like nothing.","While I was waiting, I had recalled the words of the late Gurgel, when at his house he showed me his wife’s portrait, similar to Capitu’s. You must remember them; if not, reread the chapter, whose number I’ll not give you here, since I can’t remember it, but it’s not far back. They come down to saying that there are these inexplicable resemblances … Later on in the day, and on other days, Ezequiel came with me to my study, and the lad’s features gave a clear idea of those of the other; either that or I paid more attention to them. At the same time, I remembered vague, remote episodes, words, encounters, and incidents, things in which my blindness saw no cunning, and when my old jealousy was not operative. One time when I came across them alone and silent, a secret that made me laugh, a word she spoke when dreaming, all these reminiscences came back now, in such a tumult that they made me dizzy … And why didn’t I strangle them one day, when I turned my eyes away from the street where two swallows were sitting on a telegraph wire? Inside the house, my two other swallows were floating on air, their eyes deep in each other’s eyes, but so cautious that they broke off straight away, saying something cheerful and friendly to me. I recounted the loves of the swallows outside, and they thought it amusing; Escobar said that, for him, it would be better if the swallows, instead of sitting on the wires, were on the dinner table, stewed. “I’ve never eaten their nests,” he went on, “but they must be good, if the Chinese have discovered them.” And we started talking about the Chinese and the classic works that speak of them, while Capitu, confessing that we bored her, went to do other things. Now I remembered everything that at the time had seemed to be nothing.","In the meantime I recalled the words of the late Senhor Gurgel that day in his house when he showed me the portrait of his wife, with its likeness to Capitu. You must remember them; if not you should reread the chapter – I won’t put the number here because I don’t remember it, but it’s not too far back. They amount simply to his saying that there are resemblances that are inexplicable. From that day on, whenever the boy came to my study I noticed a growing similarity to the features of the other, or perhaps it was that I was looking for it. At the same time I remembered strange occurrences long ago, words, meetings, incidents, that in my blindness I did not find suspicious and to which my customary jealousy failed to alert me. Times when I found them together, a secret told to make me laugh, a careless word of hers, all these recollections came flooding back so forcefully as to leave me stupefied. How was it that I did not strangle them one day when I glanced back from watching two swallows perched together on the telephone wires? In the house my two other swallows were floating in the air, gazing into each other’s eyes, but cautiously enough to break off and disarm me with cheerful, friendly conversation. I told them of the two love-birds outside, and they found it amusing; for his part, Escobar said that better than having the swallows on the telephone wires would be to have them on the table, cooked. ‘I’ve never eaten their nests,’ he said, ‘but they should be good if it was the Chinese who first discovered them.’ And we talked about the Chinese and the references to them in the classics, until Capitu said she was bored and went to attend to something else. Now I remember everything, which at the time seemed to me nothing."

"Mas é tempo de tornar àquela tarde de novembro, uma tarde clara e fresca, sossegada como a nossa casa e o trecho da rua em que morávamos. Verdadeiramente foi o princípio da minha vida; tudo o que sucedera antes foi como o pintar e vestir das pessoas que tinham de entrar em cena, o acender das luzes, o preparo das rabecas, a sinfonia… Agora é que eu ia começar a minha ópera. “A vida é uma ópera”, dizia-me um velho tenor italiano que aqui viveu e morreu… E explicou-me um dia a definição, em tal maneira que me fez crer nela. Talvez valha a pena dá-la; é só um capítulo.","But it's time to return to that November afternoon, a clear and cool afternoon, as quiet as our house and the stretch of street where we lived. Truly it was the beginning of my life; everything that had happened before was like the painting and dressing of the people who had to enter the scene, the lighting of the lights, the preparation of the fiddles, the symphony… Now I was going to start my opera. “Life is an opera”, an old Italian tenor who lived and died here told me… And one day he explained the definition to me in such a way that he made me believe in it. Perhaps it is worth giving it away; it's just a chapter.","But it’s time to return to that November afternoon, a clear, fresh afternoon, quiet as our house and the part of the street where we lived. Really, that was when my life began; everything that had happened before was like the putting-on of make-up and costumes by those who are about to go on stage, the lighting, the tuning of the fiddles, starting up the orchestra … Now I was about to begin my opera. “Life is an opera,” as an old Italian tenor who lived and died here used to say to me … And he explained the definition to me one day, so convincingly that I ended up believing him. It might be worthwhile giving it here; it will only take a chapter.","But it is time to return to that November afternoon, a clear, fresh afternoon, as peaceful as our house and the stretch of road where we lived.

And he gave me such a convincing explanation that I ended up believing him. It’s maybe worth while giving it; it will only take a chapter."
"A todas as perguntas, Capitu ia respondendo prontamente e bem. Trazia um vestidinho melhor e os sapatos de sair. Não entrou com a familiaridade do costume, deteve-se um instante à porta da sala, antes de ir beijar a mão a minha mãe e ao padre. Como desse a este, duas vezes em cinco minutos, o título de protonotário, José Dias, para se desforrar da concorrência, fez um pequeno discurso em honra “ao coração paternal e augustíssimo de Pio IX”.","To all the questions, Capitu responded promptly and well. She was wearing a nicer dress and shoes to go out. He didn't enter with the usual familiarity, he stopped for a moment at the door of the room, before going to kiss the hand of my mother and the priest. As he gave the latter, twice in five minutes, the title of protonotary, José Dias, to get even with the competition, made a short speech in honor of “the paternal and most august heart of Pius IX”.","To all these questions, Capitu had ready, appropriate answers. She had a better dress on, and her most formal shoes. She did not come in with her usual familiarity, but stopped at the living-room door, before going to kiss my mother’s hand, then the priest’s. As she gave him the title of protonotary twice in five minutes, José Dias, to get even with the competition, made a little speech in honor of the “paternal heart of the most august Pius IX.”","Capitu answered all his questions easily and without hesitation. She was wearing a better frock and her walking-out shoes. When she entered she did so not in her usual informal way but paused for a moment at the door before coming in to kiss the hands of my mother and the priest. Within five minutes she had treated the latter twice to the title of protonotary, which spurred José Dias to retaliate by making a short speech in honour of ‘the most august and paternal heart of Pius IX’."

"Pois, francamente, só agora entendia a emoção que me davam essas e outras confidências. A emoção era doce e nova, mas a causa dela fugia-me, sem que eu a buscasse nem suspeitasse. Os silêncios dos últimos dias, que me não descobriam nada, agora os sentia como sinais de alguma cousa, e assim as meias palavras, as perguntas curiosas, as respostas vagas, os cuidados, o gosto de recordar a infância. Também adverti que era fenômeno recente acordar com o pensamento em Capitu, e escutá-la de memória, e estremecer quando lhe ouvia os passos. Se se falava nela, em minha casa, prestava mais atenção que dantes, e, segundo era louvor ou crítica, assim me trazia gosto ou desgosto mais intensos que outrora, quando éramos somente companheiros de travessuras. Cheguei a pensar nela durante as missas daquele mês, com intervalos, é verdade, mas com exclusivismo também.","Well, frankly, only now did I understand the emotion that these and other confidences gave me. The emotion was sweet and new, but the cause of it eluded me, without my looking for it or suspecting it. The silences of the last few days, which had revealed nothing to me, I now felt as signs of something, and so were the half-words, the curious questions, the vague answers, the cares, the pleasure of remembering childhood. I also noticed that it was a recent phenomenon to wake up with the thought of Capitu, and hear her from memory, and shudder when I heard her footsteps. If she was talked about, in my house, I paid more attention than before, and, depending on whether it was praise or criticism, it brought me more intense likes or dislikes than before, when we were only companions in mischief. I even thought of her during the Masses that month, with breaks, it's true, but with exclusivity too.","Well, quite frankly, only now did I understand the emotion that these confessions, and others like them, stirred in me. It was a novel emotion, and a delightful one, but its origin was a mystery to me—one I didn’t even suspect the existence of. Her more recent silences, which had meant nothing to me, I now felt to be signs of something: the same was true of her half-spoken words, curious questions, vague replies, her thoughtful moments, the pleasure she took in remembering our childhood. I also noticed that it was a récent phenomenon for me to wake up thinking about Capitu, to remember her words, and tremble when I heard her steps. If they talked about her at home, I paid more attention than before, and depending on whether it was praise or criticism, the pleasure and pain this brought me were more intense than before, when we were only two mischievous children. I even thought of her during mass that month: not all the time, it is true, but at times I thought of her exclusively.","To be honest, only now did I understand the emotion that these and other tête-à-têtes stirred in me. It was a novel and delightful emotion whose origin, unsought and unsuspected, remained unknown. The periods of silence in recent days, which had signified nothing to me, I now felt revealed something, just as did the hints, the anxious questions, the vague replies, the precautions, the pleasure in recalling childhood days. I also realized that it was a recent phenomenon to wake up thinking of Capitu, to remember her voice and tremble when I heard her footsteps. If her name was mentioned at home I paid more attention than I had before and experienced more joy or pain according to whether she was praised or criticized than I had done before, when we were just playmates. I even thought about her during mass that month, not all the time, of course, but of no one else but her."
"— Pois então? Temos falado sobre isso, e ela fez-me o favor de pedir a minha opinião. Pergunte-lhe o que é que eu lhe disse em termos claros e positivos; pergunte-lhe. Disse-lhe que não podia desejar melhor nora para si, boa, discreta, prendada, amiga da gente… e uma dona de casa, que não lhe digo nada. Depois da morte da mãe, tomou conta de tudo. Pádua, agora que se aposentou, não faz mais que receber o ordenado e entregá-lo à filha.

After her mother died, she took care of everything. Padua, now that he has retired, does nothing more than collect his salary and hand it over to his daughter.

"Não havendo remédio senão ficar com ele, fiz-me pai deveras. A ideia de que pudesse ter visto alguma fotografia de Escobar, que Capitu por descuido levasse consigo, não me acudiu, nem, se acudisse, persistiria. Ezequiel cria em mim, como na mãe. Se fosse vivo José Dias, acharia nele a minha própria pessoa. Prima Justina quis vê-lo, mas estando enferma, pediu-me que o levasse lá. Conhecia aquela parenta. Creio que o desejo de ver Ezequiel era para o fim de verificar no moço o debuxo que porventura houvesse achado no menino. Seria um regalo último; atalhei-o a tempo.","With no choice but to stay with him, I became a real father. The idea that he might have seen a photograph of Escobar, which Capitu had carelessly taken with him, did not come to me, nor, if he had, would it persist. Ezequiel believed in me, as in his mother. If José Dias were alive, I would find my own person in him. Cousin Justina wanted to see him, but being sick, asked me to take him there. I knew that relative. I believe that the desire to see Ezequiel was for the purpose of verifying in the young man the sketch that he might have found in the boy. It would be an ultimate treat; I cut it in time.","Since there was nothing for it but for him to stay with me, I made myself into a real father. The idea that he might have seen some photograph of Escobar that Capitu might have incautiously carried round with her, did not occur to me, nor, if it had, would the thought have lasted. Ezequiel believed in me, as he believed in his mother. If José Dias had been alive, he would have thought him the image of me. Cousin Justina wanted to see him, but since she was ill, she asked me to take him there. But I knew my relative. I think that the desire to see Ezequiel was so that she could see rounded out the sketch that in all likelihood she had seen in the boy. It would be a final treat; I prevented it in time.","Since there was no alternative but to accept him, I became a true father. The idea that he might have seen some photograph of Escobar that Capitu had thoughtlessly taken with her never occurred to me, and if it had done it wouldn’t have worried me. Ezequiel believed in me as firmly as in his mother. If he had been alive José Dias would have found him the image of myself. Cousin Justina wanted to see him, but as she was ill she asked me to take him there. He knew of her. I think her wish to see Ezequiel was to verify whether the young man’s appearance vindicated suspicions she might earlier have entertained concerning the boy. It would be a final gratification, but I forestalled her."
"Era isto mesmo; devíamos dissimular para matar qualquer suspeita, e ao mesmo tempo gozar toda a liberdade anterior, e construir tranquilos o nosso futuro. Mas o exemplo completa-se com o que ouvi no dia seguinte, ao almoço; minha mãe, dizendo Tio Cosme que ainda queria ver com que mão havia eu de abençoar o povo à missa, contou que, dias antes, estando a falar de moças que se casam cedo, Capitu lhe dissera: “Pois a mim quem me há de casar há de ser o padre Bentinho; eu espero que ele se ordene!”. Tio Cosme riu da graça, José Dias não dessorriu, só prima Justina é que franziu a testa, e olhou para mim interrogativamente. Eu, que havia olhado para todos, não pude resistir ao gesto da prima, e tratei de comer. Mas comi mal; estava tão contente com aquela grande dissimulação de Capitu que não vi mais nada, e, logo que almocei, corri a referir-lhe a conversa e a louvar-lhe a astúcia. Capitu sorriu de agradecida.","That was it; we should hide to kill any suspicion, and at the same time enjoy all the previous freedom, and build our future in peace. But the example is completed by what I heard the next day at lunch; My mother, telling Uncle Cosme that he still wanted to see with what hand I would bless the people at Mass, said that, days before, when talking about young women who marry early, Capitu had said to her: “For who will marry will be Father Bentinho; I hope he orders himself!”. Uncle Cosme laughed at the joke, José Dias didn't smile, only cousin Justina frowned and looked at me questioningly. I, who had looked at everyone, couldn't resist the cousin's gesture, and tried to eat. But I ate badly; I was so happy with that great dissimulation of Capitu's that I didn't see anything else, and as soon as I had lunch I ran to tell him about the conversation and to praise his astuteness. Capitu smiled gratefully.","That was it; we had to dissemble, so as to kill off any suspicions, and at the same time enjoy all our former liberty, to build our future with confidence. But the example is completed by what I heard the next day, at lunch; my mother, when Uncle Cosme said that he wanted to see what kind of figure I would make blessing the people at mass, recounted that some days before, speaking about girls marrying young, Capitu had said to her: “Well, the one who’ll marry me will be Father Bentinho; I’ll wait till he’s ordained!” Uncle Cosme laughed, José Dias consented to smile, and only cousin Justina raised her eyebrows, and looked at me questioningly. Though I had looked at them all, I could not withstand cousin Justina’s look, and tried to eat. But I could hardly swallow; I was so contented with Capitu’s great deceit that I could think of nothing else, and as soon as I had eaten, ran to tell her about the conversation and praise her guile. Capitu smiled gratefully.","That’s how it was: we had to dissimulate in order to quell any suspicions, while at the same time enjoying all our former liberty and tranquilly planning our future together. But let me complete the example by recounting what I heard one day at lunch. Uncle Cosme was saying that he would like to see how I gave my blessing to the congregation at mass, when my mother mentioned that, some days earlier, talking about girls who get married young, Capitu had said to her, ‘Well, I insist on being married by Father Bentinho. I hope he will be ordained.’ Uncle Cosme burst out laughing. José Dias never changed countenance, and only Cousin Justina wrinkled her brow and gave me a quizzical look. Having gazed round at them all I could not face Cousin Justina’s stare and gave my attention to my food. But I ate badly. I was so delighted with Capitu’s dissimulation that I could think of nothing else, and after lunch I ran to discuss the conversation and praise her for her cunning. She gave a smile of pleasure."
"Com que então eu amava Capitu, e Capitu a mim? Realmente, andava cosido às saias dela, mas não me ocorria nada entre nós que fosse deveras secreto. Antes dela ir para o colégio, eram tudo travessuras de criança; depois que saiu do colégio, é certo que não restabelecemos logo a antiga intimidade, mas esta voltou pouco a pouco, e no último ano era completa. Entretanto, a matéria das nossas conversações era a de sempre. Capitu chamava-me às vezes bonito, mocetão, uma flor; outras pegava-me nas mãos para contar-me os dedos. E comecei a recordar esses e outros gestos e palavras, o prazer que sentia quando ela me passava a mão pelos cabelos, dizendo que os achava lindíssimos. Eu, sem fazer o mesmo aos dela, dizia que os dela eram muito mais lindos que os meus. Então Capitu abanava a cabeça com uma grande expressão de desengano e melancolia, tanto mais de espantar quanto que tinha os cabelos realmente admiráveis; mas eu retorquia chamando-lhe maluca. Quando me perguntava se sonhara com ela na véspera, e eu dizia que não, ouvia-lhe contar que sonhara comigo, e eram aventuras extraordinárias, que subíamos ao Corcovado pelo ar, que dançávamos na lua, ou então que os anjos vinham perguntar-nos pelos nomes, a fim de os dar a outros anjos que acabavam de nascer. Em todos esses sonhos andávamos unidinhos. Os que eu tinha com ela não eram assim, apenas reproduziam a nossa familiaridade, e muita vez não passavam da simples repetição do dia, alguma frase, algum gesto. Também eu os contava. Capitu um dia notou a diferença, dizendo que os dela eram mais bonitos que os meus; eu, depois de certa hesitação, disse-lhe que eram como a pessoa que sonhava… Fez-se cor de pitanga.","How then did I love Capitu, and Capitu me? Indeed, I was sewn into her skirts, but I could not think of anything between us that was really secret. Before she went to school, it was all childish pranks; After he left school, it's true that we didn't re-establish the old intimacy right away, but it came back little by little, and in the last year it was complete. However, the subject of our conversations was the same as usual. Capitu sometimes called me handsome, young man, a flower; others would take my hands to count my fingers. And I began to remember these and other gestures and words, the pleasure I felt when she ran her hand through my hair, saying that she thought it was so beautiful. I, without doing the same to hers, said that hers were much more beautiful than mine. Then Capitu would shake her head with a great expression of disillusionment and melancholy, all the more surprising since she had really admirable hair; but I retorted calling her crazy. When she asked me if I had dreamed about her the day before, and I said no, I would hear her say that she had dreamed of me, and they were extraordinary adventures, that we climbed Corcovado through the air, that we danced on the moon, or that the angels came to ask us by names, in order to give them to other angels who had just been born. In all these dreams we walked together. The ones I had with her weren't like that, they just reproduced our familiarity, and often they were just a simple repetition of the day, some phrase, some gesture. I also counted them. One day Capitu noticed the difference, saying that hers were prettier than mine; I, after some hesitation, told him that they were like the person he dreamed of… He turned cherry-colored.","So I loved Capitu, and she me? It was true that I did hang around her a great deal, but I could not think of anything between us that was really secret. Before she went to school, it was all just childish mischief; after she left school, it is true that we did not immediately return to the old intimacy, but little by little it came back, and in the last year had been complete again. Nevertheless, the subject of our conversations remained the same. Capitu at times called me handsome, a fine fellow, a real angel; at others, she took my hands to count my fingers. I began to remember these and other gestures and words, the pleasure I felt when she ran her hand through my hair, saying she thought it was very beautiful. Though I did not do the same thing to her, I said that hers was much more beautiful than mine. Then Capitu shook her head with a disappointed, melancholy look, the more astonishing in that she had really wonderful hair; I retorted by saying she was crazy. When she asked if I had dreamed of her the previous night, and I said no, she would tell me that she had dreamed of me. There were extraordinary adventures, in which we flew up to the Corcovado,* danced in the moonbeams, or the angels came to ask us our names, so that they could give them to other angels that had just been born. In all these dreams we were always together. The ones I had of her were not like this: they only reproduced incidents of our daily life together, and often they were no more than a simple repetition of the day, a phrase here, a gesture there. I also recounted mine. One day Capitu pointed out the difference, saying that hers were prettier than mine; I, after some hesitation, told her they were like the dreamer … She blushed bright red.","What did it signify, then, that I should love Capitu and Capitu should love me? True enough I was forever tied to her skirts, but I could think of nothing between us that could be described as secret. Before she went to school it was all just childish pranks. When she left school it took some time to re-establish our former intimacy, but it returned little by little and in the last year had been complete. Nevertheless, the subject of our conversations remained the same. Capitu would call me handsome, a fine lad, a beau, or she would take hold of my hands to count the fingers. And I began to remember these and other gestures and words and the pleasure I felt when she ran her fingers through my hair, saying she thought it was beautiful. Then I, without doing the same to hers, would say that hers was much more beautiful than mine, whereupon Capitu would shake her head in a dire expression of sadness and disbelief, all the more surprising since her hair really was magnificent, and I would reply calling her crazy. When she asked me whether I had dreamed about her the night before, and I answered no, she declared that she had dreamed of me – extraordinary adventures in which we flew up in the air to the Corcovado or danced on the moon or in which angels came to ask us our names so that they could be given to other angels that had just been born. In these dreams we were always together. Those that I had about her were not like that but merely reproduced our everyday life, often being no more than a simple repetition of the events of the day, a phrase or a gesture. I recounted mine, too. One day Capitu commented on the difference, saying that hers were much more beautiful than mine. After a moment’s hesitation I replied that they were like the person who dreamed them … She blushed as red as a beetroot."
"Afinal disse comigo que as palavras podiam servir, tudo era dizê-las em tom que não ofendesse. E a prova é que, repetindo-as novamente, saíram-me quase súplices. Bastava não carregar tanto, nem adoçar muito, um meio-termo. “E Capitu tem razão, pensei, a casa é minha, ele é um simples agregado… Jeitoso é, pode muito bem trabalhar por mim, e desfazer o plano de mamãe.”","In the end, I told myself that words could do, everything was to say them in a tone that didn't offend. And the proof is that, repeating them again, they came out almost pleading. It was enough not to carry too much, nor to sweeten too much, a compromise. “And Capitu is right, I thought, it's my house, he's a simple addition… Handsome he is, he might as well work for me and undo Mom's plan.”","In the end I said to myself that the words would do: the essential thing was to say them in a tone that would not give offence. The proof is that when I repeated them over again, they came out as almost pleading. All I had to do was not be too assertive, nor too amiable, but somewhere between the two. “ And Capitu’s right , I thought, the house is mine, and he’s no more than a dependent … But he’s clever , he can quite well work for me, and upset Mamma’s plan.”","Finally I told myself that those words would do, the important thing being to speak them in a tone that would give no offence. This was proved when, on repeating them again, they sounded almost pleading. I needed to find the happy medium between being too firm and too condescending. Capitu is right, I thought. It’s my house, and he’s no more than a hanger-on. He knows his way about, so he might just as well work for me and upset my mother’s plan."

"Ficamos sós na sala; Capitu confirmou a narração da mãe, acrescentando que passara mal por causa do que ouvira em minha casa. Também eu lhe contei o que se dera comigo, a entrevista com minha mãe, as minhas súplicas, as lágrimas dela, e por fim as últimas respostas decisivas: dentro de dous ou três meses iria para o seminário. Que faríamos agora? Capitu ouvia-me com atenção sôfrega, depois sombria; quando acabei, respirava a custo, como prestes a estalar de cólera, mas conteve-se.","We were alone in the room; Capitu confirmed her mother's narration, adding that she had felt sick because of what she had heard at my house. I too told him what had happened to me, the interview with my mother, my pleas, her tears, and finally the last decisive answers: in two or three months I would go to the seminary. What would we do now? Capitu listened to me with eager attention, then somberly; when I was done, he was breathing hard, as if he were about to burst into anger, but he held back.","We remained alone in the living room; Capitu confirmed her mother’s story, adding that she had had a bad night because of what she had heard at our house. I also told her what had happened to me, the talk with my mother, my entreaties, her tears, and in the end the final decisive answer: in two or three months I would go to the seminary. What could we do now? Capitu listened to me with eager attention, then gloomily; when I finished, she could hardly breathe, as if about to burst with anger, but she controlled herself.","We were left on our own in the room. Capitu confirmed what her mother had told me but added that she had felt unwell because of what she had heard in my house. For my part I told her what had happened to me, of my conversation with my mother, how I had pleaded with her, the tears she had shed, and finally the firm decision she had come to, that within two or three months I must go to the seminary. Capitu listened to me eagerly, then more gloomily. By the time I had finished she was barely breathing, as if about to explode with rage, but she controlled herself."

"Pádua, ao contrário, ia mais humilhado. Apesar de substituído por mim, não acabava de se consolar da tocha, da miserável tocha. E contudo havia outros que também traziam tocha, e apenas mostravam a compostura do ato; não iam garridos, mas também não iam tristes. Via-se que caminhavam com honra.","Padua, on the other hand, was more humiliated. Despite being replaced by me, he hadn't finished taking comfort from the torch, from the miserable torch. And yet there were others who also carried a torch, and only showed the composure of the act; They weren't gaudy, but they weren't sad either. It was seen that they walked with honor.","Pádua, on the other hand, looked even more humiliated. Although it was I who had taken his place, he could not console himself with that candle, that miserable candle. All the same, there were others who were also carrying candles, and whose demeanor suited their position; they were not delighted, but neither were they sad. One could see that they walked with honor.","Pàdua, on the other hand, looked ever more mortified. Though it was I who had taken his place, he found no consolation in his torch, his wretched torch. Yet there were others who also carried torches and were perfectly satisfied; if they did not demonstrate excessive joy, neither did they appear dispirited. They walked with dignity."
"Agora que expliquei o título, passo a escrever o livro. Antes disso, porém, digamos os motivos que me põem a pena na mão.","Now that I've explained the title, I move on to writing the book.

Before that, however, let me explain the motives that put the pen in my hand.","Now that I have explained the title I will pass on to writing the book. First, however, let me outline the motives that led me to take up my pen."
"Que voltamos ao assunto, não é preciso dizê-lo. Voltamos uma e muitas vezes; eu louvava as qualidades morais de Capitu, matéria adequada à admiração de um seminarista, a simpleza, a modéstia, o amor do trabalho e os costumes religiosos. Não lhe tocava nas graças físicas, nem ele me perguntava por elas; apenas insinuei a conveniência de a conhecer de vista.","That we're back on the subject, needless to say. We came back again and again; I praised Capitu's moral qualities, a subject suitable for the admiration of a seminarian, her simplicity, modesty, love of work and religious customs. I didn't touch his physical graces, nor did he ask me about them; I only hinted at the convenience of seeing her by sight.","Needless to say, we returned to the subject. We came back to it many times; I praised Capitu’s moral qualities, a subject appropriate for a seminarist’s admiration: her simplicity, her modesty, her industry, and her religious habits. I didn’t touch on her physical charms, nor did he ask about them; I only hinted that he should get to know her by sight.","Needless to say, we returned to the subject many times. I was loud in my praise of Capitu’s virtues, which gave ample material for the admiration of a young seminarist: her simplicity, her modesty, her industry and her religious habits. I did not mention her outward graces, nor did he enquire about them; I merely insinuated that I should like him to meet her."
"José Dias ia tão contente que trocou o homem dos momentos graves, como era na rua, pelo homem dobradiço e inquieto. Mexia-se todo, falava de tudo, fazia-me parar a cada passo diante de um mostrador ou de um cartaz de teatro. Contava-me o enredo de algumas peças, recitava monólogos em verso. Fez os recados todos, pagou contas, recebeu aluguéis de casa; para si comprou um vigésimo de loteria. Afinal, o homem teso rendeu o flexível, e passou a falar pausado, com superlativos. Não vi que a mudança era natural; temi que houvesse mudado a resolução assentada, e entrei a tratá-lo com palavras e gestos carinhosos, até entrarmos no ônibus.","José Dias was so happy that he exchanged the man of serious moments, as he was on the street, for the folded and restless man. He moved all over, talked about everything, made me stop at every step in front of a counter or a theater poster. He told me the plot of some plays, recited monologues in verse. He did all the errands, paid bills, received house rent; bought himself a twentieth of the lottery. After all, the tense man surrendered to the flexible, and began to speak slowly, with superlatives. I didn't see that the change was natural; I feared that I had changed the settled resolution, and I began to treat him with affectionate words and gestures, until we got on the bus.","José Dias was so happy that the gravity which was his usual manner in the street gave way to his elastic, restless demeanor. Gesticulating and talking a great deal, he made me stop over and over again at shop windows or theater bills. He recounted the plot of some of the plays and recited monologues in verse. He did all his errands, paid bills, collected rents; for himself he bought a cheap lottery ticket. Then finally, formality carried the day over flexibility, and he began to talk with deliberation again, using his usual superlatives. I didn’t see that this was a natural change; I was afraid that he might have changed his mind, and began to treat him with affectionate words and gestures, until we got back in the bus.","José Dias was so pleased with himself that his manner changed completely: normally composed in the street, he was now nervous and preoccupied. Restless and talkative, he made me stop in front of every noticeboard or theatre bill. He told me the plot of various plays, reciting some of the monologues in verse. He attended to all his business, paid bills and collected the rent from the tenants; for himself he bought a twentieth share of a lottery ticket. Finally his natural gravity vanquished his present levity, and he began to speak with greater deliberation, using the customary superlatives. Not realizing that this was a natural transformation, I was afraid he had gone back on our agreement and addressed him with ingratiating words and gestures until we got into the bus."
"Da cama ouvi a voz dela, que viera passar o resto da tarde com minha mãe, e naturalmente comigo, como das outras vezes; mas, por maior que fosse o abalo que me deu, não me fez sair do quarto. Capitu ria alto, falava alto, como se me avisasse; eu continuava surdo, a sós comigo e o meu desprezo. A vontade que me dava era cravar-lhe as unhas no pescoço, enterrá-las bem, até ver-lhe sair a vida com o sangue…","From the bed I heard her voice, who had come to spend the rest of the afternoon with my mother, and naturally with me, as before; but no matter how great the shock it gave me, it didn't make me leave the room. Capitu laughed out loud, spoke loudly, as if warning me; I was still deaf, alone with myself and my contempt. The desire I felt was to dig my nails into his neck, bury them well, until I saw his life come out with his blood...","From my bed I heard her voice: she had come to spend the rest of the afternoon with my mother, and no doubt with me too, as she had before; but, however shaken I was, she couldn’t make me come out of my room. Capitu laughed aloud, spoke loudly, as if she was telling me she was there; I remained deaf, alone with myself and my contempt. It made me want to sink my nails into her neck, bury them deep, and watch the life drain out of her with her blood…","From my bed I heard her voice. She had come to spend the remainder of the afternoon with my mother, and so of course with me, as on other occasions; but no matter how much I suffered it did not persuade me to leave my room. Capitu laughed out loud and spoke in a loud voice as if signalling to me, but I remained deaf, alone with myself and my contempt. My only wish was to dig my nails into her throat, thrusting them deep, and watch her life ebb away with her blood …"

"Os olhos de Escobar, claros como já disse, eram dulcíssimos; assim os definiu José Dias, depois que ele saiu, e mantenho esta palavra, apesar dos quarenta anos que traz em cima de si. Nisto não houve exageração do agregado. A cara rapada mostrava uma pele alva e lisa. A testa é que era um pouco baixa, vindo a risca do cabelo quase em cima da sobrancelha esquerda; mas tinha sempre a altura necessária para não afrontar as outras feições, nem diminuir a graça delas. Realmente, era interessante de rosto, a boca fina e chocarreira, o nariz curvo e delgado. Tinha o sestro de sacudir o ombro direito, de quando em quando, e veio a perdê-lo, desde que um de nós lho notou um dia no seminário; primeiro exemplo que vi de que um homem pode corrigir-se muito bem dos defeitos miúdos.","Escobar's eyes, clear as I said, were very sweet; That's how José Dias defined them, after he left, and I keep that word, despite the forty years he's been carrying around. In this there was no exaggeration of the aggregate. His shaven face showed white, smooth skin. The forehead was a little low, with the hairline coming almost above the left eyebrow; but he always had the necessary height so as not to confront the other features, nor to diminish their grace. Indeed, he was interesting on the face, the thin, brooding mouth, the slender, curved nose. He had the knack of shaking his right shoulder from time to time, and he lost it, ever since one of us noticed it one day at the seminary; first example I have seen of a man being able to correct himself very well from minor defects.","Escobar’s eyes, which were pale as I have already said, were of the softest; that was how José Dias defined them, after he had gone, and I will not change the word, in spite of the forty years that have passed. The dependent was not exaggerating. His clean-shaven face had white, smooth skin. His forehead, though, was a little low, so that his parting almost came down to the left eyebrow; but it was still high enough not to clash with his other features, or diminish their charm. Truly, it was an interesting face, with an delicate mouth always ready for a laugh, and a thin, curved nose. He had the habit of twitching his right shoulder from time to time, but rid himself of it when one of us pointed it out to him one day in the seminary; the first example I’ve seen that a person can perfectly well cure himself of small defects.","Escobar’s eyes, which were light in colour, as I have said, had the most gentle expression, as José Dias put it when he left, and I retain the adjective even after a lapse of forty years. In this he was not exaggerating. The lad’s clean-shaven face was white and smooth. His forehead was somewhat narrow, the parting of his hair beginning immediately over his left eyebrow, but it was sufficiently broad not to contrast with his other features or render them less attractive. He had the habit of twitching his right shoulder from time to time but lost it when one of us commented on it one day at the seminary. It was the first example I had seen of a man curing himself of a minor disability."

"Agora, por que é que nenhuma dessas caprichosas me fez esquecer a primeira amada do meu coração? Talvez porque nenhuma tinha os olhos de ressaca, nem os de cigana oblíqua e dissimulada. Mas não é este propriamente o resto do livro. O resto é saber se a Capitu da praia da Glória já estava dentro da de Matacavalos, ou se esta foi mudada naquela por efeito de algum caso incidente. Jesus, filho de Sirac, se soubesse dos meus primeiros ciúmes, dir-me-ia, como no seu capítulo IX, versículo 1: “Não tenhas ciúmes de tua mulher para que ela não se meta a enganar-te com a malícia que aprender de ti”. Mas eu creio que não, e tu concordarás comigo; se te lembras bem da Capitu menina, hás de reconhecer que uma estava dentro da outra, como a fruta dentro da casca.","Now, why did none of these capricious ones make me forget the first love of my heart?

"Cheguei a casa, abri a porta devagarinho, subi pé ante pé, e meti-me no gabinete; iam dar seis horas. Tirei o veneno do bolso, fiquei em mangas de camisa, e escrevi ainda uma carta, a última, dirigida a Capitu. Nenhuma das outras era para ela; senti necessidade de lhe dizer uma palavra em que lhe ficasse o remorso da minha morte. Escrevi dous textos. O primeiro queimei-o por ser longo e difuso. O segundo continha só o necessário, claro e breve.

"Como e por que me saiu este verso da cabeça, não sei; saiu assim, estando eu na cama, como uma exclamação solta, e, ao notar que tinha a medida de verso, pensei em compor com ele alguma cousa, um soneto. A insônia, musa de olhos arregalados, não me deixou dormir uma longa hora ou duas; as cócegas pediam-me unhas, e eu coçava-me com alma. Não escolhi logo, logo o soneto; a princípio cuidei de outra forma, e tanto de rima como de verso solto, mas afinal ative-me ao soneto. Era um poema breve e prestadio. Quanto à ideia, o primeiro verso não era ainda uma ideia, era uma exclamação; a ideia viria depois. Assim na cama, envolvido no lençol, tratei de poetar. Tinha o alvoroço da mãe que sente o filho, e o primeiro filho. Ia ser poeta, ia competir com aquele monge da Bahia, pouco antes revelado, e então na moda; eu, seminarista, diria em verso as minhas tristezas, como ele dissera as suas no claustro. Decorei bem o verso, e repetia-o em voz baixa, aos lençóis; francamente, achava-o bonito, e ainda agora não me parece mau:","How and why this line came out of my head, I don't know; he left like that, while I was in bed, with a loose exclamation, and, noticing that he had the verse measure, I thought of composing something with him, a sonnet. Insomnia, wide-eyed muse, wouldn't let me sleep a long hour or two; tickling asked for nails, and I scratched my soul. I didn't choose the sonnet right away; at first I took care of another way, and as much of rhyme as of loose verse, but in the end I stuck to the sonnet. It was a short and helpful poem. As for the idea, the first line was not yet an idea, it was an exclamation; the idea would come later. So in bed, wrapped in the sheet, I tried to poet. There was the excitement of the mother who feels the child, and the first child. He was going to be a poet, he was going to compete with that monk from Bahia, shortly before revealed, and then in fashion; I, a seminarian, would say my sorrows in verse, as he had said his in the cloister. I memorized the verse well, and repeated it in a low voice, to the sheets; frankly, I thought it was pretty, and even now it doesn't look bad to me:","How and why this line came into my head , I do not know; it came just like that, as I lay in bed, like an isolated exclamation, and, when I realized that it scanned like a line of poetry, it occurred to me to compose something with it, a sonnet. Insomnia, that muse with staring eyes, stopped me sleeping for an hour or two; it was an itch that needed scratching, and I scratched enthusiastically. I didn’t make up my mind on a sonnet right away; at first I thought of other forms, whether in blank verse or rhyme, but in the end I stuck to the sonnet. It was a short, serviceable poem. As for the idea to be expressed, this first line wasn’t yet an idea, merely an exclamation; the idea would come later. So in my bed, wrapped in my sheets, I tried to compose a poem. I was as excited as a mother who feels her child, her first child about to be born. I was going to be a poet, and compete with that monk from Bahia who had only recently been discovered, and was then in fashion; I, a seminarist, would tell of my woes in verse, as he had spoken of his sufferings in the cloister. I got the line by heart, and repeated it to the sheets, under my breath; frankly, I thought it was beautiful, and still now I don’t think it’s bad:","How and why this line came into my head I do not know. It came as I lay in bed – an isolated exclamation. And when I noted that it scanned like poetry I thought of composing something to go with it: to turn it into a sonnet. Insomnia, the muse with staring eyes, did not let me sleep for a long hour or two. It seemed an itch asking for scratching, and I scratched wholeheartedly. I did not decide on the sonnet form right away. At first I considered other forms in rhymed as well as blank verse, but finally I settled on the sonnet: a poem both brief and serviceable. As for the theme, the first line was not yet an idea, it was just an exclamation; the theme would come later. Thus, lying in bed, wrapped in my sheets, I tried to compose a poem. I was as excited as a mother who feels within her the stirrings of her first child. I was going to be a poet and compete with that monk of Bahia who had just been discovered and was all the rage. I, a seminarist, would recount my woes in verse as he had written of his sufferings from the cloister. I memorized the line and repeated it in a soft voice to the sheets. Frankly I thought it beautiful, and even now it does not seem bad to me."

"Contrário a isso foi um seminarista que não seguiu a carreira. Chamava-se… Não é preciso dizer o nome; baste o caso. Tinha composto um Panegírico de Santa Mônica, elogiado por algumas pessoas e então lido entre os seminaristas. Alcançou licença de imprimi-lo, e dedicou-o a Santo Agostinho. Tudo isso é história velha; o que é mais moço é que um dia, em 1882, indo ver certo negócio em repartição da Marinha, ali dei com este meu colega, feito chefe de uma seção administrativa. Deixara seminário, deixara letras, casara e esquecera tudo, menos o Panegírico de Santa Mônica, umas vinte e nove páginas, que veio distribuindo pela vida fora. Como eu precisasse de algumas informações, fui pedir-lhas, e seria impossível achar melhor nem mais pronta vontade; deu-me tudo, claro, certo, copioso. Naturalmente conversamos do passado, memórias pessoais, casos de estudo, incidentes de nada, um livro, um verbo, um mote, toda a velha palhada saiu cá fora, e rimos juntos, e suspiramos de companhia. Vivemos algum tempo do nosso velho seminário. Ou porque eram dele, ou porque éramos então moços, as recordações traziam tal poder de felicidade que, se alguma sombra contrária houve então, não apareceu agora. Ele confessou-me que perdera de vista todos os companheiros do seminário.","Contrary to this was a seminarian who did not follow a career. It was called… No need to say the name; enough the case. He had composed a Saint Monica Panegyric, praised by some people, and then read it among the seminarians. He obtained permission to print it, and dedicated it to St. Augustine. All this is old history; what is younger is that one day, in 1882, while going to see a certain business in the navy division, I came across this colleague of mine, made head of an administrative section. He had left the seminary, he had left letters, he had married and he had forgotten everything except the Panegyric of Santa Monica, some twenty-nine pages, which he had been distributing throughout his life. As I needed some information, I went to ask them, and it would be impossible to find better or more readily available; gave me everything, clear, right, copious. Naturally, we talked about the past, personal memories, case studies, incidents of nothing, a book, a verb, a motto, all the old bullshit came out, and we laughed together, and sighed together. We live some time from our old seminary. Either because they were his, or because we were young then, the memories brought such a power of happiness that, if any contrary shadow existed then, it does not appear now. He confessed to me that he had lost sight of all his fellow seminarians.","The opposite of this was a seminarist who did not enter the Church.

He had left the seminary, abandoned letters, married, and forgotten everything except the Panegyric of Saint Monica, some twenty-nine pages, which he went on handing out in later life. As I needed some information, I went to ask him for it, and one couldn’t have asked for more courtesy and efficiency; he gave me everything, clearly, correctly, and copiously. Naturally we talked of the past, personal memories, things that happened in class, trivial incidents, a book, a word, a saying, all the old rubbish spilled out, and we laughed and sighed together. We spent a while recalling our memories of the seminary. Whether because of their associations with the place, or because we were young then, the memories had such power to bring happiness that if there had been any shadow over it in the past, it did not appear now. He confessed that he had lost contact with all his friends from the seminary.","The opposite of this was a seminarist who had not entered the Church.

We spent a while reliving some of our memories of the old seminary.

"Padre Cabral estava naquela primeira hora das honras em que as mínimas congratulações valem por odes. Tempo chega em que os dignificados recebem os louvores como um tributo usual, cara morta, sem agradecimentos. O alvoroço da primeira hora é melhor; esse estado da alma que vê na inclinação do arbusto, tocado do vento, um parabém da flora universal, traz sensações mais íntimas e finas que qualquer outro. Cabral ouviu as palavras de Capitu com infinito prazer.","Father Cabral was in that first hour of honors in which the smallest congratulations are worth odes. Time comes when the dignified receive the praises as a usual tribute, dead face, without thanks. The bustle of the first hour is better; that state of the soul that sees in the slope of the bush, touched by the wind, a congratulations of the universal flora, brings sensations more intimate and fine than any other. Cabral listened to Capitu's words with infinite pleasure.","Father Cabral was in the first flush of glory, when the slightest congratulations seem like laudatory odes. The time comes when those who have been honored take this praise for granted, and accept it without acknowledgement, blankfaced. The excitement of the first moment is the best; that state of mind which sees the bending of a tree in the wind as a personal homage from the world’s flora brings more delicate, more intimate sensations than any other. Cabral listened to Capitu’s words with infinite pleasure.","Father Cabral was at that initial stage of freshly received honours when even the humblest congratulations are worth laudatory odes. Later these dignitaries regard such praise as a natural tribute, receiving it with neither emotion nor thanks.

"Penso que ameacei puxá-la a mim. Não juro, começava a estar tão alvoroçado, que não pude ter toda a consciência dos meus atos; mas concluo que sim, porque ela recuou e quis tirar as mãos das minhas; depois, talvez por não poder recuar mais, colocou um dos pés adiante e o outro atrás, e fugiu com o busto. Foi este gesto que me obrigou a reter-lhe as mãos com força. O busto afinal cansou e cedeu, mas a cabeça não quis ceder também, e, caída para trás, inutilizava todos os meus esforços, porque eu já fazia esforços, leitor amigo. Não conhecendo a lição do Cântico, não me acudiu estender a mão esquerda por baixo da cabeça dela; demais, este gesto supõe um acordo de vontades, e Capitu, que me resistia agora, aproveitaria o gesto para arrancar-se à outra mão e fugir-me inteiramente. Ficamos naquela luta, sem estrépito, porque apesar do ataque e da defesa, não perdíamos a cautela necessária para não sermos ouvidos lá de dentro; a alma é cheia de mistérios. Agora sei que a puxava; a cabeça continuou a recuar, até que cansou; mas então foi a vez da boca. A boca de Capitu iniciou um movimento inverso, relativamente à minha, indo para um lado, quando eu a buscava do lado oposto. Naquele desencontro estivemos, sem que ousasse um pouco mais, e bastaria um pouco mais…","I think I threatened to pull her to me. I swear, I was getting so excited that I couldn't be fully aware of my actions; but I conclude that it is, because she recoiled and wanted to take her hands off mine; then, perhaps because he couldn't go back any further, he put one foot forward and the other back, and fled with the bust. It was this gesture that forced me to hold her hands tightly. The bust finally got tired and gave way, but the head didn't want to give in either, and, falling back, it made all my efforts useless, because I was already making efforts, dear reader. Not knowing the lesson of the Song, it did not help me to extend my left hand under her head; Furthermore, this gesture presupposes an agreement of wills, and Capitu, who was resisting me now, would take advantage of the gesture to snatch the other hand and escape me entirely. We stayed in that fight, without a fuss, because despite the attack and the defense, we didn't lose the necessary caution so as not to be heard from within; the soul is full of mysteries. Now I know I was pulling her; the head continued to recede, until it got tired; but then it was the turn of the mouth. Capitu's mouth started an inverse movement, relative to mine, going to one side, when I was looking for her on the opposite side. In that mismatch we were, without daring a little more, and a little more would be enough...","I think I went as if to pull her towards me. I don’t swear to it, for I was so excited that I could not be completely conscious of my acts; but I must have done, for she drew back and tried to free her hands from mine; then, perhaps because she could not go any further back, she put one of her feet forward and the other back, and turned her chest away from me. It was this gesture that made me hold onto her hands tightly. Her chest finally tired of this and gave in, but her head would not do so too, and, hanging back, rendered all my efforts useless—because, dear reader, I was now making a considerable effort. Not being acquainted with the Song of Songs, it never occured to me to place my left hand under her head; in any case, such a gesture presupposes a meeting of wills, and Capitu, who was now resisting me, would take advantage of it to remove the other hand and get away from me completely. We continued to struggle in this way, noiselessly, because in spite of the movements of attack and defense, we were cautious enough to be sure that no one in the house could hear us; the soul is full of mysteries. Now I know I was pulling her: her head was still drawn back, until it got tired; but then it was the turn of the mouth. Capitu’s mouth began a inverse movement in relation to mine, going to one side while I went to the other. And we were at this point of stalemate , I not daring to go any further, when a little was all that was needed …","I think I began to pull her towards me. I can’t swear to it, as by then I was becoming so excited that I was not conscious of all my actions. But I think I did because she drew back and tried to free her hands from mine. Then, perhaps because she was unable to retreat any further, she put one foot in front of the other and leaned away from me. It was this which obliged me to grip her hands tightly. Her body finally tired and gave way, but not her head, which by hanging back defied all my efforts; for by now, dear reader, I was making strong efforts. Unaware of the lessons of the Song of Solomon, it never occurred to me to place my left hand under her head. In any case this presupposes a mutual agreement, and Capitu, who was resisting me now, would have seized the opportunity to free her other hand and escape from me altogether. We were locked in a noiseless struggle, for despite the motions of attack and defence we were not forgetful of the need for caution lest we be overheard. The human soul is an enigma. Now I am sure that I was pulling her; still she kept her head back until it, too, tired, and then it was the turn of her mouth. Capitu’s mouth began to move in a direction contrary to mine, twisting to one side when my mouth was seeking hers at the other. One little effort more, just a very little one …"

"Tijolos que pisei e repisei naquela tarde, colunas amareladas que me passastes à direita ou à esquerda, segundo eu ia ou vinha, em vós me ficou a melhor parte da crise, a sensação de um gozo novo, que me envolvia em mim mesmo, e logo me dispersava, e me trazia arrepios, e me derramava não sei que bálsamo interior. Às vezes dava por mim, sorrindo, um ar de riso de satisfação, que desmentia a abominação do meu pecado. E as vozes repetiam-se confusas:","Bricks that I stepped on and walked over that afternoon, yellowed columns that you passed to the right or to the left, depending on whether I came or went, the best part of the crisis remained in me, the sensation of a new joy, which enveloped me in myself, and then it dispersed me, and it gave me goosebumps, and it poured out on me I don't know what inner balm. Sometimes I found myself, smiling, an air of contented laughter, which belied the abomination of my sin. And the voices repeated themselves confused:","Brick paving that I paced back and forth over that afternoon, yellowed columns that passed by to right and left as I came and went, you were imprinted with the better part of that crisis, the sensation of a new joy, which wrapped me up in myself, then dissolved, made me shudder, and poured out some unknown inner balsam. Sometimes I became aware of myself smiling, with a look of satisfied laughter about me which belied the abomination of my sin. And the jumbled voices went on repeating:","The tiles that I trod and retrod, the yellowing pillars that I passed by to left and right, all are stamped with the marks of the crisis I underwent, the sensation of some new joy that took possession of me, then departed, that both excited me and soothed me with some mysterious balsam. At times I found myself smiling with self-satisfaction in denial of the horror of my sin. And the jumbled voices repeated insistently, ‘Secretly …’"

"Foi talvez um mal esta recusa; dela resultaram alguns desconcertos que a audiência prévia e a colaboração amiga teriam evitado. Com efeito, há lugares em que o verso vai para a direita e a música para a esquerda. Não falta quem diga que nisso mesmo está a beleza da composição, fugindo à monotonia, e assim explicam o terceto do Éden, a ária de Abel, os coros da guilhotina e da escravidão. Não é raro que os mesmos lances se reproduzam, sem razão suficiente. Certos motivos cansam à força de repetição. Também há obscuridades; o maestro abusa das massas corais, encobrindo muita vez o sentido por um modo confuso. As partes orquestrais são aliás tratadas com grande perícia. Tal é a opinião dos imparciais.","Perhaps this refusal was an evil; it resulted in some discomfiture that the prior hearing and friendly collaboration would have avoided. Indeed, there are places where the verse goes to the right and the music to the left. There is no shortage of people who say that the beauty of the composition lies in this, escaping the monotony, and that is how they explain the Eden triplet, Abel's aria, the choirs of the guillotine and slavery. It is not uncommon for the same bids to be reproduced, without sufficient reason. Certain motifs tire by force of repetition. There are also obscurities; the conductor abuses the choral masses, often covering up the meaning in a confused way. The orchestral parts are, moreover, handled with great skill. Such is the opinion of the impartial.","This refusal was perhaps unfortunate; the result was some awkward passages which a previous run-through and friendly collaboration might have avoided. And indeed, there are places where the words go one way, and the music another. There are people who maintain that that is precisely where the beauty of the composition lies, in its avoidance of monotony: such is the explanation of the Eden trio, Abel’s aria, and the choruses of the guillotine and slavery. Not infrequently, the same situations occur more than once, without sufficient justification. Certain motifs, indeed, weary the listener by overmuch repetition. Also, there are passages that are obscure; the composer uses the massed choruses too much, causing confusion and concealing the true meaning. The orchestral parts, however, are treated with great skill.

"Caminhou para a porta, saímos ambos. Antes de sair, voltou-se para mim, e quase a vi saltar-me ao colo e dizer-me que não seria padre.

"Antes de concluir este capítulo, fui à janela indagar da noite por que razão os sonhos hão de ser assim tão tênues que se esgarçam ao menor abrir de olhos ou voltar de corpo, e não continuam mais. A noite não me respondeu logo. Estava deliciosamente bela, os morros palejavam de luar e o espaço morria de silêncio. Como eu insistisse, declarou-me que os sonhos já não pertencem à sua jurisdição. Quando eles moravam na ilha que Luciano lhes deu, onde ela tinha o seu palácio, e donde os fazia sair com suas caras de vária feição, dar-me-ia explicações possíveis. Mas os tempos mudaram tudo. Os sonhos antigos foram aposentados, e os modernos moram no cérebro da pessoa. Estes, ainda que quisessem imitar os outros, não poderiam fazê-lo; a ilha dos sonhos, como a dos amores, como todas as ilhas de todos os mares, são agora objeto da ambição e da rivalidade da Europa e dos Estados Unidos.","Before concluding this chapter, I went to the window to inquire about the night why dreams must be so tenuous that they fray at the slightest opening of eyes or return of body, and do not continue any longer. The night didn't answer me right away. It was deliciously beautiful, the hills paled with moonlight and the space died of silence. As I insisted, he declared that dreams no longer belong to his jurisdiction. When they lived on the island Luciano gave them, where she had her palace, and where she made them go out with their different faces, she would give me possible explanations. But times have changed everything. The old dreams have been retired, and the modern ones live in the person's brain. These, even if they wanted to imitate others, could not do so; the island of dreams, like that of loves, like all islands of all seas, are now objects of ambition and rivalry in Europe and the United States.","Before finishing this chapter, I went to the window to inquire of Night why dreams should be so tenuous that they dissolve at the slightest opening of an eye or turn of the body, and do not continue.

"Se a intenção do meu mestre de latim era ir acostumando ao uso do título com o nome, não sei bem; o que sei é que quando ouvi o meu nome ligado a tal título, deu-me vontade de dizer um desaforo. Mas a vontade aqui foi antes uma ideia, uma ideia sem língua, que se deixou ficar quieta e muda, tal como daí a pouco outras ideias… Mas essas pedem um capítulo especial. Rematemos este dizendo que o mestre de latim falou algum tempo da minha ordenação eclesiástica, ainda que sem grande interesse. Ele buscava um assunto alheio para se mostrar esquecido da própria glória, mas era esta que o deslumbrava na ocasião. Era um velho magro, sereno, dotado de qualidades boas. Alguns defeitos tinha; o mais excelso deles era ser guloso, não propriamente glutão; comia pouco, mas estimava o fino e o raro, e a nossa cozinha, se era simples, era menos pobre que a dele. Assim, quando minha mãe lhe disse que viesse jantar, a fim de se lhe fazer uma saúde, os olhos com que aceitou seriam de protonotário, mas não eram apostólicos. E para agradar a minha mãe novamente pegou em mim, descrevendo o meu futuro eclesiástico, e queria saber se ia para o seminário agora, no ano próximo, e oferecia-se a falar ao “senhor bispo”, tudo marchetado do “protonotário Santiago”.","Whether my Latin master's intention was to get used to the use of the title with the name, I'm not sure; what I do know is that when I heard my name linked to such a title, it made me want to say an insult. But the will here was rather an idea, an idea without a language, which was left to remain silent and mute, just like other ideas soon afterward… But these ask for a special chapter. Let us finish this off by saying that the Latin master spoke for some time about my ecclesiastical ordination, albeit without great interest. He was looking for someone else's subject to show that he was oblivious to his own glory, but it was this that dazzled him at the time. He was a thin, serene old man, endowed with good qualities. It had some flaws; the most exalted of them was to be greedy, not exactly glutton; he ate little, but he loved the fine and the rare, and our kitchen, if it was simple, was less poor than his. So when my mother told him to come over for dinner to heal him, the eyes with which he accepted would have been protonotary, but not apostolic. And to please my mother, she took me again, describing my ecclesiastical future, and wanted to know if I was going to the seminary now, next year, and offered to speak to “Mister Bishop”, all inlaid with the “Protonotary Santiago” .","I don’t know if my Latin master merely intended to get used to joining the title with someone’s name; what I do know is that when I heard my name tied to that title, I had an urge to say something rude. But this urge was just an idea, an idea without expression, which kept itself to itself, just like some other ideas a little later … But they demand a chapter to themselves. Let us complete this one by saying that the Latin master spoke for a time about my ordination as a priest, though without showing much interest. He was looking for a different subject to pretend he had forgotten his own glory, but it was this that dazzled him. He was a thin old man, serene, and with good qualities. He had some defects; the most notable being that he liked his food, without being exactly gluttonous; he ate little, but was fond of good quality, choice dishes, and our cuisine, while simple, was less monotonous than his. So, when my mother asked him to stay to dinner so that we could drink his health, the eyes he accepted with might have been protonotarian, but they were not apostolic. And to thank my mother he again used me, describing my ecclesiastical future, and wanted to know if I was going to the seminary soon, in the following year, and offered himself to speak to “my Lord Bishop,” peppering everything he said with “Protonotary Santiago.”","I am not sure whether my Latin teacher’s intention was to accustom us to using the title with the name, but what I do know is that when I heard my own name linked with that title I had the urge to say something rude. But the urge was little more than an idea, one without words, which allowed itself to remain silent, dumb, just as later other ideas … But these require a chapter to themselves. Let us conclude this one by saying that my Latin teacher spoke at length about my future ordination, though without any particular enthusiasm. He was trying to change the subject so as to demonstrate his own indifference to his new glory, though it was this that now dazzled him. He was a thin, placid old man, with many good qualities. He had some bad ones, too, the most notable being that he was greedy, if not exactly a glutton. He ate little, but he appreciated the finest, choicest dishes, and our table, though simple, was less austere than his own. So when my mother invited him to dine with us by way of celebration the expression in his eyes when he accepted may well have been that of a protonotary, but it was certainly not apostolic. And to please my mother he returned to me, discussing my future in the Church and wanting to know whether I was going to the seminary the following year. He offered to speak himself to ‘my Lord Bishop’, all this punctuated by references to Protonotary Santiago."

"Por falar nisto, é natural que me perguntes se, sendo antes tão cioso dela, não continuei a sê-lo apesar do filho e dos anos. Sim, senhor, continuei. Continuei, a tal ponto que o menor gesto me afligia, a mais ínfima palavra, uma insistência qualquer; muita vez só a indiferença bastava. Cheguei a ter ciúmes de tudo e de todos. Um vizinho, um par de valsa, qualquer homem, moço ou maduro, me enchia de terror ou desconfiança.

I became jealous of everything and everyone. A neighbour, a waltz couple, any man, young or old, filled me with terror or distrust.

I came to be jealous of everything and everyone. A neighbor, a waltz partner, any man, young or old, filled me with terror or mistrust. It is true that Capitu liked to be seen, and the most appropriate means to that end (a lady said to me one day) is to see in one’s own right, and one cannot see without showing that one is seeing.","Speaking of this, it is natural that you should ask me whether, despite our having had a child and the passage of the years, I was not as jealous of her as before.

"Ao certo, ninguém sabe se há de manter ou não um juramento. Cousas futuras! Portanto, a nossa constituição política, transferindo o juramento à afirmação simples, é profundamente moral.

Não confundam purgatório com inferno, que é o eterno naufrágio. Purgatório é uma casa de penhores, que empresta sobre todas as virtudes, a juro alto e prazo curto.

Who knows what the future holds? Therefore, our political constitution, which has substituted a simple affirmation for an oath, is profoundly moral. * It did away with a terrible sin. To break one’s word is always disloyal, but for someone who is more fearful of God than men it will not matter if he lies once in a while, so long as he does not put his soul in purgatory. Don’t confuse purgatory with hell, which is eternal shipwreck. Purgatory is a pawn shop, which loans money against all the virtues, short term and at high interest. But the periods can be renewed, until one day one or two middling virtues pay off all the sins, great and small.","No one knows for sure whether vows should be kept or not. Things of the future! However, our political constitution, by replacing an oath with a simple affirmation, has shown profound moral sense. It did away with a mortal sin. To go back on one’s word is always dishonest, but the man who fears God more than he does his fellow men will have no qualms about lying once or twice provided he does not condemn his soul to purgatory. Purgatory is not to be confused with hell, which is an eternal shipwreck. Purgatory is a pawnshop which lends out against all virtues on short terms and at high interest. However, the terms can be renewed till, one day, one or two medium-sized virtues can pay off all our sins, both great and small."

"Ora, como tudo cansa, esta monotonia acabou por exaurir-me também. Quis variar, e lembrou-me escrever um livro. Jurisprudência, filosofia e política acudiram-me, mas não me acudiram as forças necessárias. Depois, pensei em fazer uma História dos subúrbios, menos seca que as memórias do padre Luiz Gonçalves dos Santos, relativas à cidade; era obra modesta, mas exigia documentos e datas, como preliminares, tudo árido e longo. Foi então que os bustos pintados nas paredes entraram a falar-me e a dizer-me que, uma vez que eles não alcançavam reconstituir-me os tempos idos, pegasse da pena e contasse alguns. Talvez a narração me desse a ilusão, e as sombras viessem perpassar ligeiras, como ao poeta, não o do trem, mas o do Fausto: “Aí vindes outra vez, inquietas sombras…?”.","Now, as everything tires, this monotony ended up exhausting me too. I wanted a change, and it reminded me to write a book. Jurisprudence, philosophy and politics have come to my aid, but they have not given me the necessary strength. Afterwards, I thought about doing a History of the Suburbs, less dry than Father Luiz Gonçalves dos Santos' memoirs concerning the city; it was a modest work, but it required documents and dates, as preliminaries, all dry and long. It was then that the busts painted on the walls began to speak to me and to tell me that, since they were not able to reconstruct the times gone by, I should take my pen and tell some. Perhaps the narration would give me the illusion, and the shadows would come across lightly, as with the poet, not that of the train, but that of Faust: “Here you come again, restless shadows…?”.","But everything palls in the long run, and this monotony ended up wearying me, too. I wanted a little variety, and had the idea of writing a book. Jurisprudence, philosophy and politics occurred to me; but I didn’t have the necessary energy for such projects. Then I thought I might write a History of the Suburbs, less dry than the memoir Father Luís Gonçalves dos Santos wrote about the city of Rio itself;* a modest undertaking, but it required documents and dates as preliminaries, all of which would be boring and time-consuming. Then it was that the busts painted on the walls started to talk to me, and to tell me that, since they couldn’t bring back times past, I should take a pen and recount some of them. Perhaps the narration would beguile me, and the old shades would pass lightly over me, as they passed over the poet:—not the one on the train, but the author of Faust. “Ah, come ye back once more, ye restless shades?”†","But everything palls after a while, and this monotony ended up by wearying me. I needed variety and thought of writing a book. Jurisprudence, philosophy and politics came to mind but were not sufficiently appealing. Then I thought of writing History of the Suburbs, less dull than Father Luis Gonçalves dos Santos’s memoirs of the city. But, though an unassuming work, it would require research into documents and dates, a lengthy and boring process. At that point the busts on the walls spoke up saying that if they hadn’t been able to re-create times past for me I should take up my pen and do so in writing. Perhaps the narration would evoke the illusion, summoning forth those shades, as once happened to the poet, not him of the train, but of Faust: ‘Come ye again, restless shades?’"

Ventava, o céu estava coberto. Capitu falou novamente da nossa separação, como de um fato certo e definitivo, por mais que eu, receoso disso mesmo, buscasse agora razões para animá-la. Capitu, quando não falava, riscava no chão, com um pedaço de taquara, narizes e perfis. Desde que se metera a desenhar, era uma das suas diversões; tudo lhe servia de papel e lápis.

Capitu spoke again of our separation, as if it were a certain and definitive fact, even though I, fearful of it, now looked for reasons to cheer her up. Capitu, when not speaking, scratched on the floor, with a piece of bamboo, noses and profiles. Ever since he had taken up drawing, it had been one of his diversions; everything was like paper and pencil.

Capitu, when she was not talking, was sketching noses and profiles on the ground with a bamboo stick. Since she had begun to draw, this was one of her amusements: anything could serve as paper and pencil.

"— Um moço sem gosto nenhum à vida eclesiástica pode acabar por ser muito bom padre; tudo é que Deus o determine. Não me quero dar por modelo, mas aqui estou eu que nasci com a vocação da medicina; meu padrinho, que era coadjutor de Santa Rita, teimou com meu pai para que eu me metesse no seminário; meu pai cedeu. Pois, senhor, tomei tal gosto aos estudos e à companhia dos padres, que acabei ordenando-me. Mas, suponha que não acontecia assim, e que eu não mudava de vocação, o que é que acontecia? Tinha estudado no seminário algumas matérias que é bom saber, e são sempre melhor ensinadas naquelas casas.","— A young man with no taste for ecclesiastical life can end up being a very good priest; everything is for God to determine. I don't want to use myself as a model, but here I am who was born with the vocation of medicine; my godfather, who was a coadjutor of Santa Rita, insisted with my father for me to enter the seminary; my father gave in. Well, sir, I took such a liking to studies and the company of priests that I ended up being ordained. But suppose it didn't happen that way, and I didn't change my vocation, what would happen? I had studied in the seminary some subjects that are good to know, and they are always better taught in those houses.","“A boy with no taste for the life of the church may well end up by being a very good priest; all is as God determines. I don’t want to set myself up as an example, but look at me : I was born with a vocation for medicine; my godfather, who was curate at the church of Santa Rita, kept on at my father to send me to the seminary, and my father gave way. Well, sir, I enjoyed the lessons and the company of the priests so much that I ended up taking orders. But suppose things had not happened that way, and that I had not changed my vocation, what would have happened? I would have studied some subjects it is useful to know, and which are always better taught in such places.”","‘A young man with no inclination for the Church can turn out to be a very good priest; all is as God determines. I don’t wish to set myself up as an example, but it happens that I was born with a vocation for medicine.

Well, senhor, I found so much pleasure in my studies and the company of the priests that I ended up being ordained.

"Os olhos com que me disse isto eram embuçados, como espreitando um gesto de recusa ou de espera. Contava com a minha debilidade ou com a própria incerteza em que eu podia estar da paternidade do outro, mas falhou tudo. Acaso haveria em mim um homem novo, um que aparecia agora, desde que impressões novas e fortes o descobriam? Nesse caso era um homem apenas encoberto. Respondi-lhe que ia pensar, e faríamos o que eu pensasse. Em verdade vos digo que tudo estava pensado e feito.","The eyes with which he said this to me were hooded, as if watching for a gesture of refusal or waiting. I was counting on my weakness or on the very uncertainty that I could be in the paternity of the other, but everything failed. Was there a new man in me, one who appeared now, since new and strong impressions discovered him? In this case it was just a covert man. I replied that I would think about it, and we would do what I thought. Truly I say to you that everything was thought and done.","The eyes with which she said this were veiled, as if looking out for a gesture of refusal or postponement. She was counting on my weakness or even on any uncertainty I might have as to the paternity of the boy, but everything failed. Perhaps there was a new man inside me, who came to the surface now, now that new and strong feelings had flushed him out? In that case the new man had merely been hidden. I replied that I was going to think, and we would do whatever I decided. In truth, I can tell you that everything had been thought out and concluded on.","Her eyes, as she said this, were hesitant, as if expecting a refusal or a plea for delay. She was counting on my weakness or possible uncertainty regarding the paternity of the child, but she failed completely. Was there now within me a different man, one who was only revealed after the impact of new, powerful emotions? If so it was a shadowy figure. I replied that I would think about it, and we would do whatever I decided was best. To be frank with you, my mind was already made up."

Ergueu-se, foi ao quarto e voltou com dez libras esterlinas, na mão; eram as sobras do dinheiro que eu lhe dava mensalmente para as despesas.","Capitu looked at me laughing, and replied that it was my fault for breaking the secret.

"— Que há de ser? Quem é que não sabe tudo?… Aquela intimidade de vizinhos tinha de acabar nisto, que é verdadeiramente uma benção do céu, porque ela é um anjo, é um anjíssimo… Perdoe a cincada, Bentinho, foi um modo de acentuar a perfeição daquela moça. Cuidei o contrário, outrora; confundi os modos de criança com expressões de caráter, e não vi que essa menina travessa e já de olhos pensativos era a flor caprichosa de um fruto sadio e doce… Por que é que não me contou também o que outros sabem, e cá em casa está mais que adivinhado e aprovado?","— What is it to be? Who doesn't know everything?... That intimacy between neighbors had to end with this, which is truly a blessing from heaven, because she's an angel, she's an angel...

Who doesn’t know all about it? … That neighborly intimacy was bound to end in this, and it is truly a blessing from heaven, for she is an angel, the angelest … Pardon the solecism, Bentinho, it’s a way of underlining the young lady’s perfection. Years ago, I thought differently; I confused her childish ways with expressions of character, and didn’t see that that mischievous girl, already with her thoughtful eyes, was the capricious bloom which would produce such a sweet, wholesome fruit … Why didn’t you tell me what others know, and is well known and approved of here at home?”","‘What could be the matter? Who is there who doesn’t know all about it? Being such close neighbours it could only end up like this, which is really a blessing from heaven since she is an angel, the most blessed of angels … Forgive the exaggeration, Bentinho, it was just a way of emphasizing the girl’s perfections.

"A voz da mãe era agora mais perto, como se viesse já da porta dos fundos. Quis passar ao quintal, mas as pernas, há pouco tão andarilhas, pareciam agora presas ao chão.

"Concluo que não se devem abolir as loterias. Nenhum premiado as acusou ainda de imorais, como ninguém tachou de má a boceta de Pandora, por lhe ter ficado a esperança no fundo; em alguma parte há de ela ficar. Aqui os tenho aos dous bem casados de outrora, os bem-amados, os bem-aventurados, que se foram desta para a outra vida, continuar um sonho provavelmente. Quando a loteria e Pandora me aborrecem, ergo os olhos para eles, e esqueço os bilhetes brancos e a boceta fatídica. São retratos que valem por originais. O de minha mãe, estendendo a flor ao marido, parece dizer: “Sou toda sua, meu guapo cavalheiro!”. O de meu pai, olhando para a gente, faz este comentário: “Vejam como esta moça me quer…”. Se padeceram moléstias, não sei, como não sei se tiveram desgostos: era criança e comecei por não ser nascido. Depois da morte dele, lembra-me que ela chorou muito; mas aqui estão os retratos de ambos, sem que o encardido do tempo lhes tirasse a primeira expressão. São como fotografias instantâneas da felicidade.","I conclude that lotteries should not be abolished. No prizewinner has yet accused them of being immoral, just as no one has called Pandora's pussy bad, because her hope was left at the bottom; somewhere she has to stay. Here I have them, the two of them happily married in the past, the beloved, the blessed, who left this life for the next, probably continuing a dream. When the lottery and Pandora bore me, I look up at them and forget about the white tickets and the fateful pussy. These are portraits that are worthy of being originals. My mother's, handing the flower to her husband, seems to say: ""I'm all yours, my handsome gentleman!"" My father's, looking at us, makes this comment: “See how this girl loves me…”. If they suffered from illness, I don't know, just as I don't know if they had heartache: I was a child and I started out because I wasn't born. After his death, I remember that she cried a lot; but here are the portraits of both, without the dirt of time taking away their first expression. They are like snapshots of happiness.","My conclusion is that lotteries ought not to be abolished. No winner has ever yet accused them of immorality, as no one has ever called Pandora’s box evil, since hope was left inside; it has to be left somewhere. Here I have them, then, the happily married couple of olden days, the contented lovers, the lucky ones, who have gone from this life to a better one, no doubt to continue the dream. When I grow weary of the lottery and Pandora, I lift my eyes to them, and forget unsuccessful tickets and the fateful box. The portraits are as good as the originals. My mother’s, holding out the flower to her husband, seems to say: “I’m all yours, my handsome gentleman!” My father, looking at us, makes this comment: “See how the girl loves me….” I don’t know if they suffered from illnesses, just as I don’t know if they had disappointments: I was a child, and at first I hadn’t been born. After his death, I remember she wept a great deal. But here are the portraits of both, and the grime accumulated over time has not destroyed their original expressions. They are like snapshots of happiness.","My conclusion is that lotteries ought not to be abolished. No winner has ever accused them of being immoral, just as no one has condemned Pandora’s box because hope was left inside; it has to be left somewhere. So there I have them – the happily married couple of long ago, the blissful, fortunate lovers who left this life for the next, no doubt there to continue their dream. Whenever I am bored with lotteries and Pandora I gaze up at them and forget those white tickets and that fateful box. The portraits are worthy of the originals. That of my mother offering the flower to her husband seems to be saying, ‘I am all yours, my handsome gentleman.’ That of my father, looking at us, says, ‘See how this girl loves me …’ I do not know whether they suffered from ill health or any other afflictions; I was a child, and much happened before I was born. After he died I remember that she cried a lot. But here are their portraits, with their expressions undimmed by the passage of time. They are like instant photographs of happiness."

We reached a decision and travelled to Europe, not on holiday or to see anything either new or old. Finally we came to a halt in Switzerland.

"Todos ficaram gostando dele. Eu estava tão contente como se Escobar fosse invenção minha.

"O administrador da repartição em que Pádua trabalhava teve de ir ao Norte, em comissão. Pádua, ou por ordem regulamentar, ou por especial designação, ficou substituindo o administrador com os respectivos honorários. Esta mudança de fortuna trouxe-lhe certa vertigem; era antes dos dez contos. Não se contentou de reformar a roupa e a copa, atirou-se às despesas supérfluas, deu joias à mulher, nos dias de festa matava um leitão, era visto em teatros, chegou aos sapatos de verniz. Viveu assim vinte e dous meses na suposição de uma eterna interinidade. Uma tarde entrou em nossa casa, aflito e desvairado, ia perder o lugar, porque chegara o efetivo naquela manhã. Pediu a minha mãe que velasse pelas infelizes que deixava; não podia sofrer a desgraça, matava-se. Minha mãe falou-lhe com bondade, mas ele não atendia a cousa nenhuma.","The administrator of the office where Padua worked had to go to the North, on commission. Padua, either by regulatory order, or by special designation, replaced the administrator with the respective fees. This change of fortune brought him a certain vertigo; it was before ten contos. He was not content to change his clothes and pantry, he threw himself into superfluous expenses, he gave his wife jewelry, on feast days he would kill a piglet, he was seen in theaters, he came to patent shoes. He lived like that for twenty-two months in the assumption of an eternal interim. One afternoon he entered our house, distressed and frantic, he was going to lose his place, because the staff had arrived that morning. He asked my mother to watch over the unhappy ones she left; he could not suffer misfortune, he would kill himself. My mother spoke kindly to him, but he would not attend to anything.","The director of the department where Pádua worked had to go to the North of the country, on a special commission. Either because of normal regulations, or by special appointment, Pádua took the director’s position, and with the appropriate honararia. The change of fortune went to his head somewhat; it was before the ten contos. He didn’t stop at buying new clothes and improving the kitchen, he also spent money extravagantly, gave jewels to his wife, killed a sucking pig on feast days, was seen at the theater, even went as far as patent-leather shoes. And so he spent the twenty-two months supposing that the temporary directorship was eternal. One day he came to our house, distressed and half crazed; he was going to lose his position, for the permanent director had come back that morning. He asked my mother to look after his hapless wife and daughter; he could not bear the disgrace, and was going to kill himself. My mother spoke kindly to him, but he paid no attention.","The director of the department where Pádua worked was sent away to the north on business. Pádua, either through normal seniority or special appointment, stood in for the director, being paid the equivalent salary. This change in his fortune went to his head; it was before the ten contos. Not content with renewing his wardrobe and renovating the kitchen, he went on a spending spree, gave jewels to his wife, killed a sucking-pig at festival time, was seen in the theatres and even took to wearing patent-leather shoes. Assuming his temporary directorship to be eternal, he lived like that for twenty-two months. Then one evening he came to our house wild-eyed and in deep distress: he was going to lose his position because the director had arrived back that morning. He begged my mother to look after the poor wretches he was leaving behind, as, unable to bear the disgrace, he intended to kill himself. My mother comforted him with soothing words, but he paid no attention to her."

"Escobar vinha assim surgindo da sepultura, do seminário e do Flamengo para se sentar comigo à mesa, receber-me na escada, beijar-me no gabinete de manhã, ou pedir-me à noite a benção do costume. Todas essas ações eram repulsivas; eu tolerava-as e praticava-as, para me não descobrir a mim mesmo e ao mundo. Mas o que pudesse dissimular ao mundo, não podia fazê-lo a mim, que vivia mais perto de mim que ninguém. Quando nem mãe nem filho estavam comigo o meu desespero era grande, e eu jurava matá-los a ambos, ora de golpe, ora devagar, para dividir pelo tempo da morte todos os minutos da vida embaçada e agoniada. Quando, porém, tornava a casa e via no alto da escada a criaturinha que me queria e esperava, ficava desarmado e diferia o castigo de um dia para outro.","Escobar was thus emerging from the grave, from the seminary and from Flamengo to sit with me at the table, receive me on the stairs, kiss me in the study in the morning, or ask me for the usual blessing at night. All these actions were repulsive; I tolerated them and practiced them, so as not to discover myself and the world. But what I could hide from the world, I couldn't hide from me, who lived closer to me than anyone else. When neither mother nor son were with me, my despair was great, and I swore to kill them both, sometimes with a blow, sometimes slowly, to divide by the time of death every minute of my blurred and agonized life. When, however, I returned home and saw at the top of the stairs the little creature who wanted and waited for me, I was unarmed and deferred the punishment from one day to the next.","So Escobar began to arise from his tomb, from the seminary and from Flamengo to sit beside me at table, greet me on the stairs, kiss me in my study in the morning, or ask for my customary blessing at night. All these actions were repulsive; I put up with them or carried them out, so as not to reveal myself to myself and to the world. But what I could hide from the world, I could not hide from myself, since I lived closer to myself than anyone. When neither mother nor son were with me, my despair grew, and I swore to kill them both, either at a single blow, or slowly, to divide all the moments of my deluded and anguished life by the time it took them to die. When, however, I came back home, and saw at the top of the stairs the little creature who loved me and was waiting for me, I was disarmed, and put the punishment off from one day to another.","In this way Escobar emerged from the grave, from the seminary, from Flamengo, to sit with me at the table, to greet me on the stairs, to kiss me in the morning in my study or ask the customary blessing at night. All this was repulsive to me, but I bore with it so as not to reveal myself to myself and to the world. But what I could conceal from the world I could not conceal from myself, detached as I was from all else. When neither mother nor son was present my despair was unbearable, and I swore to kill them both, either at a blow or else slowly, dragging out their death to compensate for all my hours of anguish and suffering. But when I arrived home and found that loving little creature waiting for me at the top of the stairs my resolve weakened, and I deferred his punishment until another day."
"A imagem de Capitu ia comigo, e a minha imaginação, assim como lhe atribuíra lágrimas, há pouco, assim lhe encheu a boca de riso agora; vi-a escrever no muro, falar-me, andar à volta, com os braços no ar; ouvi distintamente o meu nome, de uma doçura que me embriagou, e a voz era dela. As tochas acesas, tão lúgubres na ocasião, tinham-me ares de um lustre nupcial… Que era lustre nupcial? Não sei; era alguma cousa contrária à morte, e não vejo outra mais que bodas. Esta nova sensação me dominou tanto que José Dias veio a mim, e me disse ao ouvido, em voz baixa:","Capitu's image went with me, and my imagination, just as I had attributed tears to her a little while ago, filled her mouth with laughter now; I saw her writing on the wall, talking to me, walking around with her arms in the air; I distinctly heard my name, with a sweetness that intoxicated me, and the voice was hers. The lit torches, so dismal at the time, looked to me like a bridal chandelier… What was a bridal chandelier? I don't know; it was something contrary to death, and I don't see anything other than a wedding. This new sensation dominated me so much that José Dias came to me and said in a low voice in my ear:","The image of Capitu was in my mind, and just as I had imagined her crying a little before, now I saw her brimful of laughter; I saw her write on the wall, speak to me, turn around with her arms in the air; I distinctly heard my name, with an intoxicating sweetness, and it was her voice that uttered it. The burning candles, which before had seemed so gloomy, now had the look of nuptial lustre … What was nuptial lustre? I don’t know; it was the opposite of death, and nothing fits that description better than weddings. This new feeling so took hold of me that José Dias came over to me, and whispered in my ear:","The vision of Capitu stayed with me, and just as my imagination had then pictured her in tears, so now it showed me her laughing face. I saw her writing on the wall, talking to me, walking about with her arms in the air; I distinctly heard her voice saying my name with a sweetness that left me dizzy with joy. The burning candles, so lugubrious on that occasion, now took on the appearance of a nuptial torch … What was a nuptial torch? I had no idea, except that it was something the very opposite of death, and now I could think of nothing but weddings. So absorbed was I by this new idea that José Dias came up to me and whispered in my ear, ‘Don’t laugh like that.’"

"Eis aqui outro seminarista. Chamava-se Ezequiel de Souza Escobar. Era um rapaz esbelto, olhos claros, um pouco fugitivos, como as mãos, como os pés, como a fala, como tudo. Quem não estivesse acostumado com ele podia acaso sentir-se mal, não sabendo por onde lhe pegasse. Não fitava de rosto, não falava claro nem seguido; as mãos não apertavam as outras, nem se deixavam apertar delas, porque os dedos, sendo delgados e curtos, quando a gente cuidava tê-los entre os seus, já não tinha nada. O mesmo digo dos pés, que tão depressa estavam aqui como lá. Esta dificuldade em pousar foi o maior obstáculo que achou para tomar os costumes do seminário. O sorriso era instantâneo, mas também ria folgado e largo. Uma cousa não seria tão fugitiva, como o resto, a reflexão; íamos dar com ele, muita vez, olhos enfiados em si, cogitando. Respondia-nos sempre que meditava algum ponto espiritual, ou então que recordava a lição da véspera. Quando ele entrou na minha intimidade pedia-me frequentemente explicações e repetições miúdas, e tinha memória para guardá-las todas, até as palavras. Talvez esta faculdade prejudicasse alguma outra.","Here is another seminarian. His name was Ezequiel de Souza Escobar. He was a slender boy, with clear eyes, a little fugitive, like his hands, like his feet, like his speech, like everything. Anyone who wasn't used to it might feel bad, not knowing where to get it. He didn't look straight in the eye, he didn't speak clearly or in a straight line; the hands did not squeeze the others, nor were they allowed to be squeezed by them, because the fingers, being slender and short, when you took care to have them between yours, there was nothing left. I say the same about the feet, which were as quickly here as there. This difficulty in landing was the biggest obstacle he found in taking the seminary customs. The smile was instantaneous, but it also laughed loosely and wide. One thing would not be so elusive as the rest, reflection; we would find him, many times, eyes fixed on each other, thinking. He always replied that he was meditating on some spiritual point, or that he remembered the lesson of the day before. When he entered my intimacy, he often asked me for explanations and small repetitions, and I had the memory to keep them all, even the words. Perhaps this faculty harmed some other.","Here is another seminarist. His name was Ezequiel de Sousa Escobar. He was a slim youth, with pale eyes, a little elusive, like his hands, like his feet, like his speech, like everything about him. If you weren’t used to him, he could make you feel dizzy, not knowing where to take a hold on him. He didn’t look you in the eye, and didn’t speak clearly and continuously; his hand didn’t grip yours, nor let itself be gripped, because, when you thought you had hold of his fingers, they were so slender and short you found there was nothing there. The same can be said of the feet, here one moment, gone the next. This difficulty in settling was the greatest obstacle he found in adapting to seminary ways. He had a instant smile, but also a hearty, relaxed laugh. One thing, perhaps, was not elusive as the rest, and that was his habit of reflecting; often we would find him, with his eyes turned inwards, thinking. He always told us he was meditating on some spiritual matter, either that or committing yesterday’s lesson to memory. When he became an intimate of mine, he frequently asked me for explanations and detailed repetitions, and had the capacity to memorize them all, every last word. It may be that this faculty got in the way of some other.","Here was another seminarist. His name was Ezequiel de Sousa Escobar. He was a slim lad, with clear, light-coloured eyes that were somewhat restless, like his hands, his feet, his speech, everything about him. Those who were not used to him sometimes felt uncomfortable, not knowing how to take him. He did not look you in the face and spoke haltingly and evasively. His hands never gripped those of others, nor allowed themselves to be gripped: his fingers were so thin and short that when you felt you were holding them they had already slipped away. The same could be said of his feet, which were here one moment and there the next. Perhaps it was this difficulty in keeping still that prevented him from adapting himself easily to life at the seminary. He was quick to smile and had a loud, ready laugh. But one thing about him was not so volatile as the rest: his habit of meditation. We would often come upon him, his eyes pensive, lost in thought, and he would tell us that he was meditating on some spiritual matter or else remembering yesterday’s lesson. As our friendship developed he would often ask me for detailed and repeated explanations, and he had such a good memory that he was able to remember everything word for word. Perhaps this faculty was in some way prejudicial."

"Um coqueiro, vendo-me inquieto e adivinhando a causa, murmurou de cima de si que não era feio que os meninos de quinze anos andassem nos cantos com as meninas de catorze; ao contrário, os adolescentes daquela idade não tinham outro ofício, nem os cantos outra utilidade. Era um coqueiro velho, e eu cria nos coqueiros velhos, mais ainda que nos velhos livros. Pássaros, borboletas, uma cigarra que ensaiava o estio, toda a gente viva do ar era da mesma opinião.","A coconut tree, seeing me restless and guessing the cause, muttered above himself that it was not bad for fifteen-year-old boys to hang around in corners with fourteen-year-old girls; on the contrary, teenagers of that age had no other occupation, nor the songs any other use.

"A pergunta era imprudente, na ocasião em que eu cuidava de transferir o embarque. Equivalia a confessar que o motivo principal ou único da minha repulsa ao seminário era Capitu, e fazer crer improvável a viagem. Compreendi isto depois que falei; quis emendar-me, mas nem soube como, nem ele me deu tempo.","The question was imprudent, at the time when I was taking care of transferring the boarding. It was equivalent to confessing that the main or only reason for my repulsion to the seminary was Capitu, and making the trip seem unlikely. I understood this after I spoke; I wanted to make amends, but I didn't know how, nor did he give me time.","It was a tactless question to ask, at the very moment when I was attempting to put the journey off. It amounted to a confession that the principal or only motive for my aversion of the seminary was Capitu, and it would make him think that the journey was unlikely. I realized this as soon as I had spoken; I wanted to correct myself, but I didn’t know how, nor did he give me time.","This was an imprudent question to ask just as I was attempting to postpone our journey. It was tantamount to admitting that my principal or sole objection to the seminary was Capitu and the journey therefore unlikely. I realized this after I had spoken and wanted to correct myself but didn’t know how. However, he gave me no time."
"Capitu deu-me as costas, voltando-se para o espelhinho. Peguei-lhe dos cabelos, colhi-os todos e entrei a alisá-los com o pente, desde a testa até às últimas pontas, que lhe desciam à cintura. Em pé não dava jeito: não esquecestes que ela era um nadinha mais alta que eu, mas ainda que fosse da mesma altura. Pedi-lhe que se sentasse.","Capitu turned away from me, turning to the little mirror. I took her hair, gathered it all and started to smooth it with the comb, from her forehead to the last ends, which went down to her waist. Standing up didn't help: you didn't forget that she was a little taller than me, but even if she was the same height. I asked him to sit down.","Capitu turned her back to me and faced the mirror. I took hold of her hair, gathered it all together, and began to smooth it out with the comb, from her forehead to the tips: it stretched down to her waist. It was no good with her standing up; you won’t have forgotten that she was a shade taller than I was, but even if we have been the same height it would have been impossible. I asked her to sit down.","Capitu turned her back to me and faced the mirror again. I took hold of her hair, gathered it together and began passing the comb through it from her forehead down to the very tips, which hung at her waist. But with her standing up it was no use. Don’t forget that she was a trifle taller than I, though I would have had the same problem had we been the same height. I asked her to sit down."

"Dei duas voltas e sussurrei a primeira palavra da minha confidência, tão escassa e surda, que não a ouvi eu mesmo; sei porém que disse “uma pessoa…” com reticência. Uma pessoa…? Não foi preciso mais para que ele entendesse. Uma pessoa devia ser uma moça. Nem cuides que pasmou de me ver namorado; achou até natural e espetou-me outra vez os olhos. Então contei-lhe por alto o que podia, mas demoradamente para ter o gosto de repisar o assunto. Escobar escutava com interesse; no fim da nossa conversação, declarou-me que era segredo enterrado em cemitério. Deu-me de conselho que não me fizesse padre. Não podia levar para a Igreja um coração que não era do céu, mas da terra; seria um mau padre, nem seria padre. Ao contrário, Deus protegia os sinceros; uma vez que eu só podia servi-lo no mundo, aí me cumpria ficar.","I turned around twice and whispered the first word of my confidence, so scanty and deaf that I did not hear it myself; I know, however, that I said “a person…” with reticence. A person…? It didn't take more for him to understand. A person must be a girl. Don't even think that he was amazed to see me as a boyfriend; he even found it natural and stabbed me in the eye again. So I told him roughly what I could, but at length so that I would have the pleasure of revisiting the subject. Escobar listened with interest; at the end of our conversation, he told me that it was a secret buried in a cemetery. He advised me not to make me a priest. He could not bring to the Church a heart that was not of heaven, but of earth; would be a bad priest, nor would he be a priest. On the contrary, God protected the sincere; since I could only serve him in the world, there I had to stay.","I gave two turns around the room, and whispered the first words of my secret, in such a faint, low voice that I didn’t hear it myself; I know, however, that I said “a person” hesitantly. A person? There was no need to say anything more for him to understand. A person must be a girl. And don’t think that he was astonished to find me in love; he even found it natural and his eyes fixed me again. Then I told him sketchily what I could, but slowly so as to have the pleasure of dwelling on the subject. Escobar listened with interest; at the end of our conversation, he declared that it was as if my secret were buried in a cemetery. He advised me not to become a priest. I could not offer the Church a heart that did not belong to heaven, but to earth; I would be a bad priest—no priest at all, in fact. On the contrary, God protects those who are sincere; since I could only serve Him in the wider world, that was where I should stay.","I took a couple of turns and then began to whisper my confession but in so timid and low a voice that I barely heard it myself, though I know that I stumbled out the words ‘a person’. A person … ? He understood right away. A person must be a girl. And you mustn’t imagine that he was shocked to learn that I was in love; he found it quite natural and gazed at me intently once more. Then I briefly explained as much as I could, taking my time over it so as to have the pleasure of dwelling on the events. Escobar listened with interest and at the end of our conversation declared that my secret was as if buried in a cemetery. He advised me not to become a priest. I could not bring to the Church a heart that was dedicated to earth, not heaven. I would be a bad priest; I wouldn’t even be a priest. On the other hand, God loved those who were honest, and if I could only serve Him outside the Church that was where I should stay."

"Não foi despedido, como pedia então; meu pai já não podia dispensá-lo. Tinha o dom de se fazer aceito e necessário; dava-se por falta dele, como de pessoa de família. Quando meu pai morreu, a dor que o pungiu foi enorme, disseram-me, não me lembra. Minha mãe ficou-lhe muito grata, e não consentiu que ele deixasse o quarto da chácara; ao sétimo dia, depois da missa, ele foi despedir-se dela.","He was not fired, as he asked then; my father could no longer do without him. He had the gift of making himself accepted and necessary; it was due to the lack of him, as a family member. When my father died, the pain that stabbed him was enormous, I was told, I don't remember. My mother was very grateful to him, and did not allow him to leave the room at the country house; on the seventh day, after mass, he went to say goodbye to her.","He was not dismissed, as he requested at the time: my father could no longer do without him. He had the gift of making himself amenable and indispensable; when we wasn’t there, it was almost as if a member of the family were missing. When my father died, he was terribly distressed, so they told me: I don’t myself remember. My mother was very grateful to him, and didn’t allow him to leave his room in the garden. After the seventh-day mass, he went to take his leave of her.","He was not dismissed, as he requested at the time; my father could not do without him. He had the knack of ingratiating himself and becoming indispensable; to lose him would be like losing one of the family.

"— Não imagina como ele anda agora, depois que o senhor lhe escreve aqueles papéis, dizia-me o dono da loja, uma vez, à porta da rua. Fala e ri muito. Logo que eu mando o caixeiro levar-lhe os papéis dele, entra a indagar da resposta, e se demorará muito, e que pergunte ao moleque, quando passar. Enquanto espera, relê jornais e toma notas. Mas também, apenas recebe os seus papéis, atira-se a lê-los, e começa logo a escrever a resposta. Há ocasiões em que não come ou come mal; tanto que eu queria pedir-lhe uma cousa, é que não os mande à hora do almoço ou de jantar…","— You can't imagine how he is now, after you wrote him those papers, the store owner once told me at the front door. Talk and laugh a lot. As soon as I order the clerk to bring him his papers, he comes in to ask for the answer, and how long will it take, and let him ask the boy when he passes by. While he waits, he reads newspapers and takes notes. But also, he just receives his papers, starts to read them, and immediately starts writing the answer. There are times when he doesn't eat or eats badly; so much that I wanted to ask you something, is that you don't send them at lunch or dinner time...","“You’ve no idea how he’s been lately, since you’ve been writing those papers to him,” the shopkeeper said to me one day, at the street door, “He talks and laughs a lot. As soon as I send the shop assistant to take you his papers, he’s thinking about the reply, and if it will take a long time, and to be sure to ask the messenger boy when he passes. While he’s waiting, he rereads newspapers and takes notes. Then, as soon as he gets your papers, he plunges into reading them, and soon begins to write the reply. There are times when he doesn’t eat, or hardly; so much so, that I want to ask you something: if you wouldn’t mind not sending them at lunch or dinner time …”","‘You can’t imagine the difference in him since you started writing those letters,’ said the shopkeeper one day at the front door. ‘Now he talks and laughs a lot. No sooner have I sent the errand boy to deliver his letters than he starts asking about your answer, whether it will take long, and to be sure to ask the boy when he comes by. While he’s waiting he rereads the newspapers and takes notes. Then as soon as he receives your letter he reads it anxiously and immediately starts to write his answer. There are times when he won’t eat or eats very little, so there is something I wanted to ask you, which is not to send your letter at lunch or dinner time …’"

"Capitu, que estava na alcova, gostou de ver a minha entrada, os meus gestos, palavras e lágrimas, segundo me disse depois; mas não suspeitou naturalmente todas as causas da minha aflição. Entrando no meu quarto, pensei em dizer tudo a minha mãe, logo que ela ficasse boa, mas esta ideia não me mordia, era uma veleidade pura, uma ação que eu não faria nunca, por mais que o pecado me doesse. Então, levado do remorso, usei ainda uma vez do meu velho meio das promessas espirituais, e pedi a Deus que me perdoasse e salvasse a vida de minha mãe, e eu lhe rezaria dous mil padre-nossos. Padre que me lês, perdoa este recurso; foi a última vez que o empreguei. A crise em que me achava, não menos que o costume e a fé, explica tudo. Eram mais dous mil; onde iam os antigos? Não paguei uns nem outros, mas saindo de almas cândidas e verdadeiras tais promessas são como a moeda fiduciária, — ainda que o devedor as não pague, valem a soma que dizem.","Capitu, who was in the alcove, liked to see my entrance, my gestures, words and tears, as she told me later; but he did not naturally suspect all the causes of my distress. Entering my room, I thought about telling my mother everything as soon as she got better, but this idea didn't bite me, it was pure whim, an action I would never do, no matter how much the sin hurt me. Then, driven by remorse, I used once more my old means of spiritual promises, and asked God to forgive me and save my mother's life, and I would pray to her two thousand Our Fathers. Father who reads me, forgive this resource; it was the last time I used it. The crisis in which I found myself, no less than custom and faith, explains everything. There were more than two thousand; where did the old ones go? I didn't pay one or the other, but coming from candid and true souls such promises are like fiat currency, — even if the debtor doesn't pay them, they are worth the sum they say.","Capitu, who was in the bedroom, approved of my entrance, my gestures, words, and tears, as she told me afterwards; but naturally she did not suspect all the reasons for my distress. Going to my room, I thought of telling my mother everything, as soon as she was better, but this idea soon lost its hold over me. It was nothing more than a whim, an action I would never carry out, however much the sin weighed on me. So, moved by remorse, once more I used the old expedient of spiritual promises, and asked God to pardon me and save my mother’s life, and I would say two thousand paternosters. If any priest is reading me, may he forgive this device; it was the last time I had recourse to it. The crisis I found myself in, no less than my habits and my faith, explains everything. It was two thousand more; and where had the old ones gone? I paid neither the latter-nor the former, but if such promises come from pure, true souls, they are like fiduciary money—even though the debtor does not redeem them, they are worth their face value.","Capitu, who was in the room, was pleased by my arrival and also by my manner, my words and my tears, as she told me afterwards, though naturally she didn’t suspect the cause of my distress. Back in my bedroom I thought of confessing everything to my mother as soon as she was well, but it was just an idea, a passing fancy, for it was something I could never bring myself to do, no matter how much pain my sin caused me. So, prompted by remorse, I returned to my old habit of making promises, asking God to forgive me and save my mother’s life and I would say two thousand paternosters. If any priest should read this I ask pardon for resorting to this stratagem; it was the last time I employed it. The critical moment at which I found myself, no less than my habit and my faith, explains everything. They were two thousand more. What happened to the earlier ones? I paid neither those nor the others, but coming from pure honest hearts such promises are like fiduciary currency – even though the debtor never pays, they are still worth their face value."

"Capitu quis que lhe repetisse as respostas todas do agregado, as alterações do gesto e até a pirueta, que apenas lhe contara. Pedia o som das palavras. Era minuciosa e atenta; a narração e o diálogo, tudo parecia remoer consigo. Também se pode dizer que conferia, rotulava e pregava na memória a minha exposição. Esta imagem é porventura melhor que a outra, mas a ótima delas é nenhuma. Capitu era Capitu, isto é, uma criatura mui particular, mais mulher do que eu era homem. Se ainda o não disse, aí fica. Se disse, fica também. Há conceitos que se devem incutir na alma do leitor, à força de repetição.","Capitu wanted him to repeat all the responses of the group, the changes in the gesture and even the pirouette, which he had just told him. I asked for the sound of words. She was thorough and attentive; the narration and the dialogue, everything seemed to brood with itself. It can also be said that I checked, labeled and committed my exposition to memory. This image is perhaps better than the other, but the best of them is none. Capitu was Capitu, that is, a very particular creature, more female than I was male. If I haven't said it yet, here it is. If said, stay too. There are concepts that must be instilled in the reader's soul, by dint of repetition.","Capitu asked me to repeat all the dependent’s replies, the alterations in his gestures and even the pirouette, which I had hardly mentioned. She asked for the tone of all his words. She gave it all her minute attention. She seemed to ruminate on everything, the story itself and the dialogue. Or you could say that she was comparing, labelling and, as it were, pinning my account up in her memory. Perhaps this image is better than the preceding one, but best of all would be none. Capitu was Capitu, that is, a very particular person, more of a woman than I was a man. If I’ve not said it already, there you have it. And if I have, there you have it anyway. There are things which must be impressed on the reader’s mind by dint of repetition.","Capitu required me to repeat every one of his answers and to describe the changes in his manner and even his pirouette, which I had done no more than mention to her. She wanted to know the tone of his voice. Attentive to the most minute detail, she mentally sifted my account of the events and the conversation. One might say that everything I told her was checked, indexed and recorded in her memory. This picture of her is perhaps better than the other one, but a perfect one does not exist. Capitu was Capitu, in other words a unique person, more of a woman than I was a man. If I haven’t already said so, I do so now. And if I have, the observation can remain. There are some concepts which need to be instilled into the mind of the reader by dint of repetition."

"A mentira espantou-me, não menos que a franqueza da notícia.

My mother had her to live with us as a favor, and also for her own ends: she wanted to have a companion in the house, and preferred a relative to an outsider.","I was surprised no less by the lie than by the openness with which she admitted it. Not that Cousin Justina was in any way timid; she was outspoken enough to tell Peter frankly what she thought about Paul, and Paul what she thought of Peter – but to confess to telling a lie, that was something new. She was in her forties, pale and thin with a small mouth and inquisitive eyes. She lived with us by favour of my mother, whom it suited to have a confidante in the house – and better a relative than a stranger."

"Era José Dias que me convidava a fechar o ataúde. Fechamo-lo, e eu peguei numa das argolas; rompeu o alarido final. Palavra que, quando cheguei à porta, vi o sol claro, tudo gente e carros, as cabeças descobertas, tive um daqueles meus impulsos que nunca chegavam à execução: foi atirar à rua caixão, defunto e tudo. No carro disse a José Dias que se calasse. No cemitério tive de repetir a cerimônia da casa, desatar as correias, e ajudar a levar o féretro à cova. O que isto me custou imagina.

"Vou esgarçando isto com reticências, para dar uma ideia das minhas ideias, que eram assim difusas e confusas; com certeza não dou nada. A cabeça ia-me quente, e o andar não era seguro. No seminário, a primeira hora foi insuportável. As batinas traziam ar de saias, e lembravam-me a queda da senhora. Já não era uma só que eu via cair; todas as que eu encontrara na rua, mostravam-me agora de relance as ligas azuis; eram azuis. De noite, sonhei com elas. Uma multidão de abomináveis criaturas veio andar à roda de mim, tique-tique… Eram belas, umas finas, outras grossas, todas ágeis como o diabo. Acordei, busquei afugentá-las com esconjuros e outros métodos, mas tão depressa dormi como tornaram, e, com as mãos presas em volta de mim, faziam um vasto círculo de saias, ou, trepadas no ar, choviam pés e pernas sobre a minha cabeça. Assim fui até madrugada. Não dormi mais; rezei padre-nossos, ave-marias, e credos, e sendo este livro a verdade pura, é força confessar que tive de interromper mais de uma vez as minhas orações para acompanhar no escuro uma figura ao longe, tique-tique, tique-tique… Pegava depressa na oração, sempre no meio para concertá-la bem, como se não tivesse havido interrupção, mas certamente não unia a frase nova à antiga.","I am going to unravel this with reticence, to give an idea of my ideas, which were so diffuse and confused; I sure as hell don't.

Until then, not having completely forgotten my Roman history, he reminded me that Cato, before killing himself, read and reread a book by Plato. I didn't have Plato with me; but a truncated volume of Plutarch, in which the life of the famous Roman was narrated, was enough for me to occupy that little time, and, in order to imitate him in everything, I stretched out on the sofa. Nor was it just imitating him in this; I needed to instill his courage in me, just as he needed the philosopher's feelings, to die fearlessly. One of the evils of ignorance is not having this remedy at the last minute. There are many people who kill themselves without it, and nobly expire; but I think many more people would put an end to their days if they could find that kind of moral cocaine from good books. However, wanting to avoid any suspicion of imitation, I remember well that, in order not to find Plutarch's book next to me, nor to be given the news in the gazettes with the color of the pants I was then wearing, I nodded. it again in its place, before drinking the poison.","My plan was to wait for my coffee, dissolve the drug in it and swallow it.

É bom que te sintas na alma do outro, como se recebesses em ti mesmo a sagração.","— Go on, sort yourself for the year, replied Uncle Cosme.

"Um dos aforismos de Franklin é que, para quem tem de pagar na Páscoa, a quaresma é curta. A nossa quaresma não foi mais longa que as outras, e minha mãe, posto me mandasse ensinar latim e doutrina, começou a adiar a minha entrada no seminário. É o que se chama, comercialmente falando, reformar uma letra.

Um dia, porém, um dos familiares que serviam de endossantes da letra, falou da necessidade de entregar o preço ajustado; está num dos capítulos primeiros. Minha mãe concordou e recolhi-me a São José.","One of Franklin's aphorisms is that for those who have to pay at Easter, Lent is short.

The creditor was an arch-millionaire, did not depend on that sum for food, and consented to the payment transfers without even raising the interest rate. One day, however, one of the family members who served as endorsers of the bill, spoke of the need to deliver the adjusted price; It's in one of the first chapters. My mother agreed and I retired to São José.","One of Franklin’s maxims is that, if you have to pay at Easter, Lent is short.

"— Isso não, atalhou prontamente; prima Glória tem este negócio firme na cabeça, e não há nada no mundo que a faça mudar de resolução; só o tempo. Você ainda era pequenino, já ela contava isto a todas as pessoas da nossa amizade, ou só conhecidas. Lá avivar-lhe a memória, não, que eu não trabalho para a desgraça dos outros; mas também, pedir outra cousa, não peço. Se ela me consultasse, bem; se ela me dissesse: “Prima Justina, você que acha?”, a minha resposta era: “Prima Glória, eu penso que, se ele gosta de ser padre, pode ir; mas, se não gosta, o melhor é ficar”. É o que eu diria e direi se ela me consultar algum dia. Agora, ir falar-lhe sem ser chamada, não faço.","— Not that, he quickly cut in; Cousin Gloria has this business firmly in her head, and there's nothing in the world to make her change her mind; just the time. You were still a little girl, she already told this to all the people we were friends with, or just acquaintances with. There to revive your memory, no, that I do not work for the misfortune of others; but also, to ask for something else, I do not ask. If she consulted me, well; if she said to me: “Prima Justina, what do you think?”, my answer would be: “Prima Gloria, I think that if he likes to be a priest, he can go; but if you don't like it, the best thing is to stay”. That's what I would and will say if she consults with me someday. Now, going to talk to him without being called, I don't.","“Certainly not,” she quickly cut in, “Cousin Glória is fixed on this business, and nothing in the world will make her change her mind—only time. When you were still small, she told this story to all our friends, and even our acquaintances. I certainly won’t refresh her memory: I’m not one to do anyone a bad turn; but ask her to do something else—that I can’t do. If she should consult me, very well; if she said to me: “Cousin Justina, what do you think?,” my reply would be: “ Cousin Glória, I think that, if he wants to be a priest, he can go to the seminary; but, if he doesn’t, it would be better if he stayed here.” That’s what I would say, and will say if some day she asks my opinion. But go and speak to her without being asked—that I won’t do.”","‘No, not that,’ she replied immediately. ‘ Your mother has this idea firmly fixed in her head, and there’s nothing in the world will make her change her mind – only time. She told all our friends and acquaintances when you were still very young. I won’t keep reminding her of it because I don’t wish anyone any harm, but to advise her against it, that I won’t do either. If she asked me, that would be different. If she said, “What do you think, Cousin Justina?” I would answer, “Cousin Glória, it’s my opinion that if he wants to be a priest he should go, but if he doesn’t want to he should stay.” That’s what I would say, and I will do if the day comes that she asks me. But I shan’t speak up unless I’m asked to.’"
"Quanto ao sonho foi isto. Como estivesse a espiar os peraltas da vizinhança, vi um destes que conversava com a minha amiga ao pé da janela. Corri ao lugar, ele fugiu; avancei para Capitu, mas não estava só, tinha o pai ao pé de si, enxugando os olhos e mirando um triste bilhete de loteria. Não me parecendo isto claro, ia pedir a explicação, quando ele de si mesmo a deu; o peralta fora levar-lhe a lista dos prêmios da loteria, e o bilhete saíra branco. Tinha o número 4004. Disse-me que esta simetria de algarismos era misteriosa e bela, e provavelmente a roda andara mal; era impossível que não devesse ter a sorte grande. Enquanto ele falava, Capitu dava-me com os olhos todas as sortes grandes e pequenas. A maior destas devia ser dada com a boca. E aqui entra a segunda parte do sonho. Pádua desapareceu, como as suas esperanças do bilhete. Capitu inclinou-se para fora, eu relancei os olhos pela rua, estava deserta. Peguei-lhe nas mãos, resmunguei não sei que palavras, e acordei sozinho no dormitório.","As for the dream, that was it. As I was spying on the crooks in the neighborhood, I saw one of them talking to my friend by the window. I ran to the place, he ran away; I advanced towards Capitu, but I wasn't alone, I had my father next to me, wiping my eyes and looking at a sad lottery ticket. This not seeming clear to me, I was about to ask for an explanation, when he himself gave it; the mischievous man had brought him the list of lottery prizes, and the ticket had come out white. It had the number 4004. He told me that this symmetry of figures was mysterious and beautiful, and probably the wheel had gone wrong; it was impossible that he shouldn't be lucky. As he spoke, Capitu gave me all sorts of luck, big and small, with her eyes. Most of these were to be given by mouth. And here comes the second part of the dream. Padua disappeared, like their ticket hopes. Capitu leaned out, I glanced at the street, it was deserted. I took his hands, mumbled I don't know what words, and woke up alone in the dormitory.","As for the dream, it was this.

"Tão depressa vi desaparecer o agregado no corredor, deixei o esconderijo, e corri à varanda do fundo. Não quis saber de lágrimas nem da causa que as fazia verter a minha mãe.

"— A separação é cousa decidida, redargui pegando-lhe na proposta. Era melhor que a fizéssemos por meias palavras ou em silêncio; cada um iria com a sua ferida. Uma vez, porém, que a senhora insiste, aqui vai o que lhe posso dizer, e é tudo.","—The separation is decided, I replied, taking the proposal. It was better that we did it in half words or in silence; each one would go with his wound. But since you insist, here's what I can tell you, and that's all.","“The separation is already decided on,” I replied taking up her suggestion. “It would have been better to have done it by means of hints, or in complete silence; each of us would have gone his way, with his own wound. Since you insist, however, here is what I can say, and it’s all.”","‘Our separation is something already decided on,’ I retorted, seizing upon her proposal. ‘It would have been better to have arranged it without recriminations, in silence, each one bearing his own wounds. However, since you insist, this is what I have to say, and it is all I have to say.’"
"— Tem razão, Capitu, concordou o agregado. Você não imagina como a Bíblia é cheia de expressões cruas e grosseiras. Eu falava assim para variar… Tu como vais, meu anjo? Meu anjo, como é que eu ando na rua?","— You're right, Capitu, agreed the aggregate. You can't imagine how the Bible is full of crude and gross expressions. I used to say that for a change… How are you, my angel? My angel, how do I walk down the street?","“You’re right, Capitu,” agreed the dependent. “You can’t imagine how many crude, coarse expressions there are in the Bible. I put it that way for a change. How are you, my angel? My angel, how do I walk down the street?”","‘You’re right, Capitu,’ replied José Dias. ‘You’d never believe how many coarse, indecent expressions there are in the Bible. I spoke like that just for a change … And how are you, my little angel? My angel, show me how I walk.’"
"E porventura era certo que me obrigava à carreira eclesiástica? Aqui chego a um ponto, que esperei viesse depois, tanto que já pesquisava em que altura lhe daria um capítulo. Realmente, não cabia dizer agora o que só mais tarde presumi descobrir; mas, uma vez que toquei no ponto, melhor é acabar com ele. É grave e complexo, delicado e subtil, um destes em que o autor tem de atender ao filho, e o filho há de ouvir o autor, para que um e outro digam a verdade, só a verdade, mas toda a verdade. Cabe ainda notar que esse ponto é que torna justamente a santa mais adorável, sem prejuízo (ao contrário!) da parte humana e terrestre que havia nela. Basta de prefácio ao capítulo; vamos ao capítulo.","And was it true that I was forced to pursue an ecclesiastical career? Here I come to a point, which I hoped would come later, so much so that I was already researching at what point I would give it a chapter. Indeed, it was not possible to say now what I assumed I would discover only later; but once I've touched the point, it's best to get rid of it. It is serious and complex, delicate and subtle, one of those in which the author has to attend to his son, and the son has to listen to the author, so that both of them tell the truth, only the truth, but the whole truth. It is also worth noting that this point is precisely what makes the saint more adorable, without prejudice (on the contrary!) to the human and terrestrial part that was in her. Enough of the preface to the chapter; let's go to the chapter.","In any case, was it really true that she was forcing me into an ecclesiastical career? Here I come to a point that I hoped would come later, so much so that I was already considering at what point I should dedicate a chapter to it. Really, I should not have said now what I only thought I discovered later; but since I have touched on the matter, it’s better to be finished with it. It is grave and complex, delicate and subtle, one of those chapters in which the author has to take heed of his child, and the child should listen to the author, so that they each tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It should also be noted that it is exactly this point which makes the saint more adorable, with no disrespect (quite the contrary!) for the human and earthly part in her. Enough of writing the preface: on to the chapter itself.","And was she perhaps right to oblige me to enter the Church? Here I arrive at a point that I had hoped would arise later, so much so that I had already considered whereabouts I should devote a chapter to it. Really there is little to be gained by stating now what I had intended to introduce later, but since I have touched on the matter it is better to finish with it. It is serious and complex, delicate and subtle, one of those things in which the author must pay heed to his child and the child listen to the author so that both will state the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And here it is worth noting that it is exactly this factor that makes the saint more adorable, without prejudice (just the contrary) to her human and worldly qualities. But this preface is long enough; we come to the chapter itself."
"Há um instante tinha eu desejo de lhe perguntar o que havia entre Capitu e os peraltas do bairro; agora, imaginando que vinha justamente dizer-mo, fiquei com medo de ouvi-lo. Quis tapar-lhe a boca. José Dias viu no meu rosto algum sinal diferente da expressão habitual, e perguntou-me com interesse:","Just a moment ago I wanted to ask him what was between Capitu and the crooks of the neighborhood; now, imagining that he had just come to tell me, I was afraid to hear him. I wanted to cover his mouth. José Dias saw on my face some sign different from the usual expression, and asked me with interest:","A minute ago I had had the desire to ask him what was going on between Capitu and the local beaux; now, imagining that he might be coming over to tell me just that, I was afraid of what he would say. I wanted to stop his mouth. José Dias saw something different from my habitual expression, and asked me with concern:","A moment before I had been tempted to ask him what there was between Capitu and the young bucks from the neighbourhood, and now, imagining that he was about to tell me just that, I was afraid to hear it. I wanted to prevent him from speaking. José Dias noticed the strange expression on my face and asked me in a serious voice, ‘What’s the matter, Bentinho?’"
"Não alcancei mais nada, e para o fim arrependi-me do pedido: devia ter seguido o conselho de Capitu. Então, como eu quisesse ir para dentro, prima Justina reteve-me alguns minutos, falando do calor e da próxima festa da Conceição, dos meus velhos oratórios, e finalmente de Capitu. Não disse mal dela; ao contrário insinuou-me que podia vir a ser uma moça bonita. Eu, que já a achava lindíssima, bradaria que era a mais bela criatura do mundo, se o receio me não fizesse discreto. Entretanto, como prima Justina se metesse a elogiar-lhe os modos, a gravidade, os costumes, o trabalhar para os seus, o amor que tinha a minha mãe, tudo isto me acendeu a ponto de elogiá-la também. Quando não era com palavras, era com gesto de aprovação que dava a cada uma das asserções da outra, e certamente com a felicidade que devia iluminar-me a cara. Não adverti que assim confirmava a denúncia de José Dias, ouvida por ela, à tarde, na sala de visitas, se é que também ela não desconfiava já. Só pensei nisso na cama. Só então senti que os olhos de prima Justina, quando eu falava, pareciam apalpar-me, ouvir-me, cheirar-me, gostar-me, fazer o ofício de todos os sentidos. Ciúmes não podiam ser; entre um pirralho da minha idade e uma viúva quarentona não havia lugar para ciúmes. É certo que, após algum tempo, modificou os elogios a Capitu, e até lhe fez algumas críticas, disse-me que era um pouco trêfega e olhava por baixo; mas ainda assim, não creio que fossem ciúmes. Creio antes… sim… sim, creio isto. Creio que prima Justina achou no espetáculo das sensações alheias uma ressurreição vaga das próprias. Também se goza por influição dos lábios que narram.","I didn't achieve anything else, and towards the end I regretted the request: I should have followed Capitu's advice. Then, as I wanted to go inside, cousin Justina held me back for a few minutes, talking about the heat and about the upcoming party at Conceição, about my old oratories, and finally about Capitu. I didn't say anything bad about her; on the contrary, he insinuated to me that he could become a pretty girl. I, who already thought she was beautiful, would cry out that she was the most beautiful creature in the world, if fear didn't make me discreet. However, as cousin Justina started praising her manners, gravity, customs, working for her own people, the love she had for my mother, all this excited me to the point of praising her too. When it wasn't with words, it was with a gesture of approval that I gave each of the other's assertions, and certainly with the happiness that must have lit my face. I didn't notice that this confirmed José Dias' complaint, which she heard in the living room in the afternoon, if she hadn't already suspected it too. I just thought about it in bed. Only then did I feel that cousin Justina's eyes, when I spoke, seemed to touch me, hear me, smell me, like me, do the work of all the senses. Jealousy couldn't be; between a brat my age and a widow in her forties there was no room for jealousy. It is true that, after some time, he changed his praise for Capitu, and even made some criticisms of her, he told me that he was a little shady and looked down on him; but still, I don't think they were jealousy. I believe rather… yes… yes, I believe this. I believe that cousin Justina found in the spectacle of other people's sensations a vague resurrection of her own. It is also enjoyed by the influence of the lips that narrate.","I found out nothing more, and later regretted that I had asked; I should have followed Capitu’s advice. Then, as I was going inside, cousin Justina held me back for a few minutes, talking of the heat and the forthcoming festival of the Conception, of my old oratories, and finally of Capitu. She spoke no ill of her; on the contrary, she hinted that she might grow into a pretty girl. I, who already thought her very beautiful, would have proclaimed that she was the loveliest creature in the world, if caution had not given me a measure of discretion. Even so, as cousin Justina began to praise her manner, her seriousness, her habits, the way she helped in the home, the affection she had for my mother, all this aroused me to praise her, too. Even when I didn’t do it directly in words, I did so in the gestures of approval with which I accompanied her every assertion, and certainly in the happiness that must have lit up my face. I did not see that I was confirming José Dias’ accusations, which she had heard that afternoon in the living room: that is, if she didn’t already suspect something. I only thought of that later in bed. Only then did I feel that, as I was speaking, cousin Justina’s eyes seemed to. touch me, hear me, smell me, taste me: they seemed to stand in for all the other senses. It couldn’t have been jealousy; there was no place for jealousy for a youngster of my age in a forty-year-old widow. It is true that, after some time, she modified her praise, and even made a few critical remarks about Capitu, telling me that she was mischievous and always looking at the ground; but even then, I don’t think it was jealousy. Rather I think … yes … this is what I think: cousin Justina found a vague reawakening of her own sensations from watching those of others. Lips can give pleasure merely by narrating.","I could get nothing more from Cousin Justina, and by the end I repented of having tried. I should have followed Capitu’s advice. Then, as I was wanting to go in, she held me back for a few minutes, talking of the heat, the forthcoming feast of the Conception, my old play altars and finally of Capitu. She did not run her down; on the contrary she implied that she would turn out to be a very pretty girl. I, who already considered her extraordinarily beautiful, would have retorted that she was the loveliest creature in the world had not caution made me more discreet. However, as Cousin Justina seemed intent on praising her manners, her serious disposition, her habits, her work in the house, her love for my mother, all this encouraged me to praise her, too. When it wasn’t with words it was with the gestures of approval that I gave to her assertions and, above all, with the happiness that must have lit up my face. I did not realize that by so doing I confirmed José Dias’s accusation, which she had heard that afternoon in the living-room, that is if she didn’t already have her own suspicions. This idea came to me in bed. It was only then that I remembered that, as I was speaking, Cousin Justina’s eyes seemed to be touching me, hearing me, smelling me, caressing me, doing the work of all the senses. It couldn’t be jealousy; between a brat of my age and a woman in her forties there was no place for jealousy. It is true that after a while her praise of Capitu was interrupted and she allowed herself some criticism, telling me that she was mischievous and wouldn’t look you in the face, but even so I don’t think it was jealousy. I think it was more … yes … that’s what it was. I think that Cousin Justina found in her contemplation of the feelings of others a vague reawakening of feelings she herself had once known. One can fall in love through the medium of a narrator’s lips."
"Ouvimos passos no corredor; era dona Fortunata. Capitu compôs-se depressa, tão depressa que, quando a mãe apontou à porta, ela abanava a cabeça e ria. Nenhum laivo amarelo, nenhuma contração de acanhamento, um riso espontâneo e claro, que ela explicou por estas palavras alegres:","We hear footsteps in the hallway; it was lady Fortunata. Capitu composed herself quickly, so quickly that when her mother pointed to the door, she shook her head and laughed. Not a hint of yellow, not a twitch of shyness, a clear, spontaneous laugh, which she explained in these happy words:","We heard footsteps in the corridor; it was Dona Fortunata. Capitu quickly composed herself, so quickly that when her mother put her head round the door she was shaking her head and laughing. There was not a trace of embarrassment, nor was she in the least discomfited: it was a clear, spontaneous laugh, which she explained with these cheery words:","We heard footsteps in the corridor; it was Dona Fortunata. Capitu pulled herself together quickly, so quickly that when her mother reached the door she was shaking her head and laughing. With no guilty look or trace of embarrassment her laughter was frank and spontaneous, and she justified it by saying gaily, ‘Mamma, look what this fine gentleman hairdresser has done to my hair."
"— Em que lhe posso valer, anjo do céu? Não hei de dissuadir sua mãe de um projeto que é, além de promessa, a ambição e o sonho de longos anos. Quando pudesse, é tarde.

"Sinhazinha Sancha, voltada para o pai, ouvia e esperava. Não era feia; só se lhe podia notar a semelhança do nariz, que também acabava grosso, mas há feições que tiram a graça de uns para dá-la a outros. Vestia simples. Gurgel era viúvo e morria pela filha. Como eu recusasse o almoço, quis que descansasse alguns minutos. Não pude recusar e subi. Quis saber a minha idade, os meus estudos, a minha fé, e dava-me conselhos para o caso de vir a ser padre; disse-me o número do armazém, rua da Quitanda. Enfim, despedi-me, veio ao patamar da escada; a filha deu-me recomendações para Capitu e para minha mãe. Da rua olhei para cima; o pai estava à janela e fez-me um gesto largo de despedida.","Sinhazinha Sancha, turned to her father, listened and waited. It wasn't ugly; you could only notice the resemblance of the nose, which also ended up thick, but there are features that take away the grace of some to give it to others. Dressed simple. Gurgel was a widower and died for his daughter. As I refused lunch, I wanted him to rest for a few minutes. I couldn't refuse and went up. He wanted to know my age, my studies, my faith, and he gave me advice in case I became a priest; he told me the number of the store, Rua da Quitanda. Finally, I said goodbye, came to the landing of the stairs; the daughter gave me recommendations for Capitu and my mother. From the street I looked up; the father was at the window and gave me a big wave of farewell.","Miss Sancha, looking at her father, listened and waited. She was not bad looking; you could only notice the resemblance in the nose, which also had a plump end, but there are features that detract from the beauty of one person while enhancing it in another. She was simply dressed. Gurgel was a widower and worshipped his daughter. As I refused lunch, he insisted that I rest for a few minutes. I couldn’t refuse and went up. He wanted to know how old I was, about my studies and my faith, and gave me advice should I become a priest; he told me the number of his store, on the Rua da Quitanda. * Finally, I said goodbye, and he came to the top of the steps; his daughter sent her regards to Capitu and my mother. From the street I looked up; the father was at the window, waving me goodbye with an expansive gesture.","Sancha, who was facing her father, listened and waited. She wasn’t bad-looking; the only feature they had in common was a blunt nose, but there are traits which, while they lessen the attractions of one, enhance those of another. She was simply dressed. Gurgel was a widower, and his daughter was his whole life. As I declined his offer of lunch he suggested that I rest there for a few minutes. I couldn’t very well refuse, so I went in. He wanted to know how old I was, asked about my studies and my faith and gave me some advice in the event of my becoming a priest. He also gave me the number of his store in the Rua da Quitanda. Finally, when I took my leave, he came to the top of the steps. His daughter sent her best wishes to Capitu and my mother. In the street I glanced up. The father was at the window vigorously waving me goodbye."

"Assim, apanhados pela mãe, éramos dous e contrários, ela encobrindo com a palavra o que eu publicava pelo silêncio. Dona Fortunata tirou-me daquela hesitação, dizendo que minha mãe me mandara chamar para a lição de latim; o padre Cabral estava à minha espera. Era uma saída; despedi-me e enfiei pelo corredor. Andando, ouvi que a mãe censurava as maneiras da filha, mas a filha não dizia nada.","So, caught by the mother, we were two and against, she covering up with her words what I was publishing by silence.

Walking along, I heard the mother scolding her daughter's manners, but the daughter said nothing.","So, surprised by her mother, we were opposites, she hiding with words what I betrayed by my silence. Dona Fortunata relieved me of my hesitation by saying that my mother had sent for me for my Latin lesson: Father Cabral was waiting for me.

As I went, I heard the mother scolding her daughter’s manners, but the daughter said nothing.","And so, caught red-handed by her mother, we were two utterly different people – she concealing with her words what I cried aloud by my silence.

"José Dias, que entrou pouco depois de mim, aplaudiu a distinção, e recordou, a propósito, os primeiros atos políticos de Pio IX, grandes esperanças da Itália; mas ninguém pegou do assunto; o principal da hora e do lugar era o meu velho mestre de latim. Eu, voltando a mim do receio, entendi que devia cumprimentá-lo também, e este aplauso não lhe foi menos ao coração que os outros. Bateu-me na bochecha paternalmente, e acabou dando-me férias. Era muita felicidade para uma só hora. Um beijo e férias! Creio que o meu rosto disse isto mesmo, porque Tio Cosme, sacudindo a barriga, chamou-me peralta; mas José Dias corrigiu a alegria:","José Dias, who joined shortly after me, applauded the distinction, and recalled, by the way, the first political acts of Pius IX, great hopes of Italy; but no one took up the matter; the principal of the time and place was my old Latin master.

He patted me on the cheek paternally, and ended up giving me a vacation. It was a lot of happiness for one hour. A kiss and vacation! I think my face said the same thing, because Uncle Cosme, shaking his belly, called me naughty; but José Dias corrected the joy:","José Dias, who came in a little after me, applauded the distinction, and recalled, apropos, the first political acts of Pius IX, which had given such great hopes to Italy; but no one took the subject up. * The man of the hour and the place was my old Latin teacher.

He gave me a fatherly pat on the cheek, and ended up by giving me a holiday. It was almost too much happiness for me to take in. A kiss and a holiday! I think my face must have shown just that, because Uncle Cosme, his belly shaking with laughter, called me a scoundrel; but José Dias put a check on my happiness:","José Dias, who had come in shortly after I did, was loud in his praises and called to mind the first political decrees of Pius IX, which Italy had set so much store by.

"O interesse do que acabas de ler não está na matéria do sonho, mas nos esforços que fiz para ver se dormia novamente e pegava nele outra vez. Nunca dos nuncas poderás saber a energia e obstinação que empreguei em fechar os olhos, apertá-los bem, esquecer tudo para dormir, mas não dormia. Esse mesmo trabalho fez-me perder o sono até à madrugada.

The very effort of doing so made me unable to sleep until dawn.

"Como eu quisesse falar também para disfarçar o meu estado, chamei algumas palavras cá de dentro, e elas acudiram de pronto, mas de atropelo, e encheram-me a boca sem poder sair nenhuma. O beijo de Capitu fechava-me os lábios. Uma exclamação, um simples artigo, por mais que investissem com força, não logravam romper de dentro. E todas as palavras recolheram-se ao coração, murmurando: “Eis aqui um que não fará grande carreira no mundo, por menos que as emoções o dominem…”.","As I also wanted to speak in order to disguise my condition, I called out some words from within, and they came right away, but in a rush, and they filled my mouth without being able to get any out. Capitu's kiss closed my lips. An exclamation, a simple article, no matter how hard they invested, could not break through from within. And all the words were collected in the heart, murmuring: ""Here is one who will not make a great career in the world, no matter how little emotions dominate him..."".","I, too, wanted to speak to cover up my emotions, so I called some words up from here inside, and they promptly appeared, but tumbling over one another, and filling my mouth up in such a way that none of them could get out.

So they all went back to the heart whence they had come, mumbling: “ Here’s someone who’ll never make his mark in the world, if his emotions rule him like that …”","Since I, too, was anxious to say something to disguise my confusion, I summoned up a few words; they came all right but in such a rush that they filled my mouth, not one being able to escape. Capitu’s kiss had sealed my lips. No matter how hard I tried I was unable to utter so much as an exclamation, not a single syllable. All my words flowed back to my heart with the message: Here’s a fellow who won’t get very far in the world as long as he is dominated by his emotions …"

Batiam oito horas numa padaria.","When I reached this final conclusion, I also reached the door of the house, but I turned back and went up Catete Street again. Was it the doubts that afflicted me or the need to afflict Capitu with my long delay? Let us say that they were the two causes; I walked a wide space, until I felt myself settle down, and straightened toward home. It was eight o'clock in a bakery.","When I arrived at this final conclusion, I was also getting to the door of my house, but I turned back, and went back up the Rua do Catete. Was it the doubts upsetting me, or the need to upset Capitu with my long delay? Let’s say it was both things; I walked for a long while, until I felt myself calm down, and turned howewards. The clock in a bakery was striking eight.","I arrived at this last conclusion at the same time as I arrived at the front door of my house, but I retraced my steps and went up the Rua do Catete again. Was it my doubts that distressed me or the need to distress Capitu by my long absence? Perhaps the two together. I wandered about for a long time until I felt calmer and then headed for home. In a baker’s shop it was striking eight o’clock."
