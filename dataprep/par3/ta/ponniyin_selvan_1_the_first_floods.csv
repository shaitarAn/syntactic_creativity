He realized that he was close to Senthan Amuthan’s gardens now. As he neared the gardens, he was appalled to see many uprooted plants, grass and flowers everywhere.

His hope that Sendhan Amudhan’s house was nearby had been proved right. They soon arrived at the garden. But how different it was today from what he had seen yesterday. It was like the Ashoka Vanam destroyed by [30]Hanuman and the Madhuvanam destroyed by the monkeys.

This seemed to be the cue for the original Kamsan to tear the rest of his disguise and stomp away, disgusted and furious. “Who cares about that idiot?' Vandhiyathevan shrugged, superbly. “I'm here now—and I shall play Kamsan, if you wish.” The theatre troupe did so wish, and bore him off promptly, delirious with joy at having found a true actor.",They agreed he was more suited to the role.

Farmers worked these lands from dawn to dusk, tilling the soil; women bent towards the earth, engaged in planting, even as they raised their voice in glorious folk songs. Lush, fully grown sugarcanes from the previous year were cut in the fields and transported to mills nearby, where they were promptly pressed for their sweet juice; jaggery was boiled in their vicinity as well, and the scents mingled, assaulting the senses in tantalizing fashion.","The profusion of lotuses and lilies in the ponds were a delight.

The excitement that lurked inside was palpable. His instincts told him that the time was near for him to reach miraculous experiences that no one else in life had ever seen. Is there such a blissful commotion as you approach the Chola country? What will be the water and land resources of that country after crossing the Kolli? What will the people and people living in that country look like? How many rivers? How many pools? How many streams? What is the scene of the Ponni River sung by poets and epics? What a beautiful view of the flowering Punna trees, Konnai trees and Kadamba trees on its shores. What a wonderful way to screw people over and get their mugs on display. How beautiful are the magnificent temples on both the banks of the Kaveri built by the Chola dynasty of Shiva devotees?","Riding along the banks of the lake, Vandiya Devan turned his horse towards the South. As he rode, he wondered about his mission. He intuitively felt that he was bound on an adventure that was destined to change his life forever. As he traveled towards the Chola Empire, he couldn’t help but be amazed by the scenic beauty of the fertile lands and the gurgling tributaries of the River Kaveri. He had heard about the numerous temples that the Chola Kings had built along the banks of the river Ponni [14] and was excited about the fact that he would be visiting famous cities like Thanjavur [15]","Vandhiyathevan spurred his horse down from the banks, towards a path that went south. His heart, at the moment, was as light as a feather, almost tumbling cartwheels in delight—much like the boats that had skimmed forward so effortlessly, on the lake's surface. His had always been an optimistic nature, willing to anticipate pleasure rather than pain. Sheer exhilaration bubbled up from deep within, coursing through his veins. Something whispered to him that he was about to embark on a strange and wonderful journey; that adventures and experiences such as had never happened to anyone, were about to befall him. Ah, if he could feel such delight just by stepping into Chozha dominions, how much more enjoyable would it be, as he journeyed beyond Kollidam? How alluring would he find those lands, overflowing with natural beauty? What would the people, especially the women, be like? Such rivers, streams and delightful, clear ponds! What a magnificent sight would the River Ponni present, enshrined in countless poems and epics? The river's lush banks, crowded with Punnai, Konnai and Kadhamba trees, weighed down with their fragrant blossoms would gladden anyone's heart! Doubtless, he would be treated to the sight of lotuses and lilies in ponds, enticing him as they unfurled their delicate petals, their subtle scents wafting towards him in welcome. Richly carved temples, built by Chozha kings renowned for their piety would greet him on either side of the river's banks, affording opportunity for quiet devotion.","Vandiyathevan's heart danced as he rode southward from the banks of the lake. The excitement that had lain hidden exploded. His innermost self told him that the time had come when he was going to have an extraordinary experience that no one had ever had before. As he approached the Chozha country, he saw that a joyful exuberance pervaded it. How fertile, how abundant would the countryside be beyond the Kollidam? What would the men and women there be like? The rivers! The ponds! How many crystal clear rivulets there would be! How beautiful the Ponni river would look! Praised in poetry and epic! How pleasant the sight of all the flowering trees on its banks, the punnai, the konnai and the kadambam, would be! The kuvalai flowers beckoning seductively from the river, the kumudam flowers and the red lotuses, what a lovely sight they would be! The beautifully sculpted temples built by the Chozha devotees on the banks of the Kaveri would be wonderful to look at!"

It was probably a palace wall.,"Vandhiyathevan craned his neck and peered above, to gaze at the wall towering above him in the patchy moonlight.

Maybe in this old age we just like female mania? For a woman who was captured somewhere in the jungle, shouldn't we have to rebuke our half-brother, the one who fought alongside us in a hundred battlefields, the one who repeatedly prevented the danger that came to us regardless of his life? So what did she highlight? We do not know her ancestry. Her actions and speech are sometimes questionable. Cheesy! Brother's word has caused such confusion in our hearts! What injustice? How does she have a lifelong love for us? How respectful is she? How enthusiastic is she about all of our things? Do you sometimes help us by telling us even ideas?","But could it be true?

She takes so much interest in the affairs of the kingdom and helps me with it. More than anything else, she has dared to get married to a 60-year-old man when she could have got all the kings and princes in this world begging her to grant them a look.","And yet—could there possibly be an atom of truth to his claims? Had he, after all, fallen for a pretty young woman at this ripe old age? After all, hadn't he just addressed the harshest words to one who had fought by his side, shoulder to shoulder, in a hundred battles; shrugged off mortal danger to fly to his side, his own younger brother—and all in defense of a girl he had dragged out from a forest! Was she indeed worthy of such loyalty? He knew nothing of her origins, after all; her speech and behaviour, it must be admitted, were peculiar at times. Chee, how can I let my brother's heedless words influence me so? Unjust indeed, to suspect Nandhini's motives. Her deep and abiding love for me is evident in everything she does—witness her mellow speech, and the utmost respect with which she treats me! As for her wifely duties—was there ever a woman who showed as much interest in her husband's office as Nandhini? Why, she even troubles herself enough to offer suggestions and comments, aiding me in every way possible!","Still, could there be a grain of truth in what he had said? Perhaps, thought Periya Pazhuvettarayar, I have grown besotted with women in my old age. Didn't I admonish my own dear brother, who has fought beside me in a hundred battles, who has protected me from countless dangers, caring little for his own life — all for the sake of a girl I brought back from the jungle? Why was she so special? We know nothing of her past. Sometimes, the way she behaves and talks does give room for suspicion. Chi chi! His brother’s words had created such confusion in his mind. How unfair! She loved him so dearly! How respectful she was to him. What enthusiasm she displayed for all his activities. Sometimes she even helped him with ideas."

But not many people know that there is a river flowing there at all because of the thick grove of trees that grow on the banks. Some compare Arisalaru to a princess who is too shy to leave the anthapuram. But no one can compare her beauty with anything else in this world.,"One of the slender golden limbs that Ponni spread out to welcome her consort, was the Arisilaaru. Tucked away to the south of the vast river, she flowed silently, concealed by a lush avenue of shady trees. Hers was a sweet, shy presence; a princess, leading a sheltered life in her anthapuram, never to appear before strangers. Indeed, outsiders rarely knew of her, unless they were informed of it. There is nothing on this earth that can compare to the exquisite loveliness of this young maiden.","The River Arisilar is one of the golden arms the Ponni stretches out to embrace her husband. This beautiful river is very near the Kaveri, to its south. It has to be pointed out to those who come from other places. A dense clump of trees hides the river well. It is said that the Arisilar can be compared to a royal princess who has never once left the anthappuram since she was born. This virgin river is incomparable in its beauty."

The spider's web stimulated his thinking.","It couldn’t possibly be. They must be there somewhere.

On one of his endless circuits around it, he almost ran into a heap of gold coins.

Probably each was a short-lived monarch; Or those who earned the honor of the petty monarch by their heroic deeds. The king or king was Maruvi at that time offering half.,"Vandiya Devan was aware that these noblemen were the most influential officials of the Chola court. It wouldn’t be wrong to call them as petty kings and powerful chieftains. In those days, one could not be a king just by birth.","None of these men could be termed ordinary in any sense of the word; it was no easy task to gather them all under one roof, either. All were rulers of their own dominions, large or small as the case may be—or had earned the status of kingship through their valorous deeds and service to the country. The word “Raja” or “Arasar” had, by continuous usage, morphed into “Araiyar;” it was the norm in those days, to refer to the chiefs of important clans, or those equal to such chiefs in stature, by that prestigious title—a nod to their ruling capabilities; sometimes, “Araiyar” was added to their respective seats, as well.","These were not ordinary persons, nor were they usually seen together.

But just when he was just about to step out, somebody caught his wrist in an iron grip and placed a hand on his shoulder. Vandiya Devan was by no means a puny man. He was quite healthy and vigorous, but he had never come across anybody who could hold him in such a vice grip!","He was doomed to disappointment, however. As he neared the entrance, a strong hand crept out and clutched his wrist in an iron grip. Now, Vandhiyathevan was a courageous young man, in the normal way—but that grip shook him, right from the top of his head to the tips of his toes, and paralyzed him into standing still.","But he failed to get away.

Not even his famed Vajrayudham, his signature weapon could control such a mount!","‘I need an elephant that is Airavatham’s equal,” he said. Sundara Chozhar replied, ‘I don’t have one equal to Airavatham, but I have elephants which are better than it.” He took Indra to the elephant shed. When Devendran saw thousands of elephants standing there like hillocks, he was taken aback. * Which one should I take?” he asked, unable to decide."

That’s why I am hesitating.” “Who are these enemies?","They pursue me even now, in all four directions. How may I carry out any task you may set me, under such circumstances?

"இவ்விதம் தமிழ் நாட்டில் நம் கதை நடந்த காலத்தில் அதாவது சுமார் 980 வருஷங்களுக்கு முன்பு, (1950ல் எழுதியது) பெரியதொரு சமயக் கொந்தளிப்பு ஏற்பட்டிருந்தது. இந்தக் கொந்தளிப்பிலிருந்து தீங்கு தரும் அம்சங்கள் சிலவும் தோன்றிப் பரவின. வீர வைஷ்ணவர்களும் வீர சைவர்களும் ஆங்காங்கு முளைத்தார்கள். இவர்கள் கண்ட கண்ட இடங்களில் எல்லாம் சண்டையில் இறங்கினார்கள். இந்த வாதப் போர்களில் அத்வைதிகளும் கலந்து கொண்டார்கள். சமய வாதப் போர்கள் சில சமயம் அடிதடி சண்டையாகப் பரிணமித்தன.","Thus there was a great religious upheaval in Tamil Nadu at the time of our story, about 980 years ago (written in 1950). Some detrimental features emerged from this turmoil. Veera Vaishnavas and Veera Saivars sprouted in Aanganku. They went to war everywhere they could. Advaitas also took part in these debates. Religious wars sometimes escalated into violent battles.","During the time of our story, there was an enormous religious movement happening in South India. On one side, there appeared Veera Saivars and on the other Veera Vaishnavas. Both parties tried to establish the supremacy of Vishnu over Shiva (or vice versa) by debating endlessly. And sometimes, the Advaita Sanyasis also joined these debates. If you remember, we saw one such debate in Veeranarayanapuram and, not unlike that scenario, most of these discussions ended in fistfights also.","Approximately 980 years ago, around the time this story was set in Thamizhagam, religious fervour had peoples' imaginations in a feverish grip. As much as this was advantageous in some ways, it cannot be denied that a good many adverse elements also found a way to spread their poisonous tendrils around the population. Fierce Vaishnavaites and Saivites rose up everywhere, with their thorny arguments; Advaitha philosophers pitched in to add their mite. Religious debates often turned into ugly fist-fights.","At the time of our story in Tamilnadu, that is, about nine hundred and eighty years ago, there was a great religious ferment in the country which had harmful aspects. Veerasaivites and Veera Vaishnavites made their appearance everywhere and constantly fought with each other. Sometimes Advaitins joined the fray. The religious arguments often led to fist fights."

The light also began to fade. Vandiyadeva thought for a moment whether he could follow them and changed it immediately.,"While he was thinking thus, they had climbed the stairs and had gone in a different direction.","By this time, the secret trio had climbed up the stairs and vanished out of sight; the light dimmed steadily, as well. Vandhiyathevan considered following them for a brief moment, and swiftly changed his mind.","By this time, all three had climbed the steps and the light had grown dim. For a second, Vandiyathevan thought of following them but he changed his mind."

Did they have any fear that someone was going to incense and incense Madurantakan? They built the title of prince and conferred the title of Parakesari and gave me the right to make an inscription in my own name. My dear father, Mandara, Vayarak, said, ""It is now your responsibility to rule this Chola kingdom."" It was acknowledged and applauded by the people, the city, the ministers and the generals. In this commotion I had completely forgotten about Nandini. But shortly after the consecration ceremony, she had an unforgettable event.","My grandmother, Sembiyanmadevi, and my father wanted to declare my right to the throne without any delay. She was afraid that someone might instigate Madhuranthakan to stake a claim to the throne. I became the heir apparent, and they gave me the title of ‘Parakesari’ and along with it the right to engrave my royal titles in stone. My father said to me, ‘from this day on, this kingdom is yours.' All the ruling lords, chieftains, commanders and the people, accepted this. I had forgotten my sorrow about Nandini in all this but not for long. Something happened there that has remained etched in my heart, ever since.”","My Yuvaraja coronation occurred a few days later; my father, Grandmother and others of influence didn't want any ambiguity about the succession—perhaps they suspected that someone might instigate Madhuranthakan to ascend the throne himself? Whatever the reason, I was made not only the heir, but also awarded the Parakesari title; I could now authorize stone inscriptions in my own name. “This vast Chozha Nadu is now yours and yours only, by right,” announced my beloved father; his heartfelt words were echoed by his ministers, courtiers, commanders and his subjects, with full force. Their resounding chants of victory pierced the very skies. Nandhini had completely faded away from my memory, during these times of joy and celebration—but something happened soon after the Pattabishekam, that ensured that she would never, ever leave my heart.","My father, my grandmother and the other elders organised this so that there would be no doubts about the succession. Perhaps they were afraid that someone would exercise an evil influence over Maduranthakan. Besides making me the Crown Prince, they gave me the title, ‘Parakesari’ and the right to have my edicts carved in stone. My father blessed me wholeheartedly: ‘Henceforth the responsibility of ruling the kingdom is yours.” All the citizens of the country, the ministers and the commanders accepted me and raised slogans of victory. In the midst of these festivities, I had completely forgotten Nandini. However, an incident occurred soon after the ceremony which I will never forget.”"

Truly, you are a Chanakya among us!” “There is more, my friends.

Reflect, if you please, on the methods of waging war: on our own experiences thus far, and on traditions that have been in place for a hundred years. Should we ever march into an enemy's lands, our armies seize what food they can from the surrounding areas; our rewards are the loot plundered from their treasuries—and they are the chief source of payment, to our soldiers. The surplus must be transferred to the royal treasury, in the capital.","Prince Arulmozhivarmar, who is fighting in Eezham, has been behaving even more strangely. You know what Our customary practices and rights are during a war, the practices our forefathers have followed for centuries. When our troops invade another country, they have to fend for themselves with what they can capture there. They have to subsist on local produce and their salaries have to be paid from the booty collected from the conquered region, any excess being sent to the central treasury."

இத்தகைய பாழடைந்த பள்ளிப்படைக் கோயிலுக்கு இருட்டுகிற நேரத்தில் ஆழ்வார்க்கடியான் வந்து சேர்ந்தான். அக்கோயிலின் மேல் மண்டப விளிம்பில் அமைந்த காவல் பூதகணங்கள் அவனைப் பயமுறுத்தப் பார்த்தன. ஆனால் அந்த வீர வைஷ்ணவ சிகாமணியா பயப்படுகிறவன்? பள்ளிப்படைக் கோயில் மண்டபத்தின் மீது தாவி ஏறினான். மண்டபத்தின் மீது கவிந்திருந்த மரக்கிளையின் மறைவில் உட்கார்ந்து கொண்டான். நாலாபுறமும் கவனமாகப் பார்த்துக் கொண்டிருந்தான். அவனுடைய கண்கள் அடர்த்தியான இருளைக் கிழித்துக் கொண்டு பார்க்கும் சக்தியைப் பெற்றிருந்தன. அவனுடைய செவிகளும் அவ்வாறே மிக மெல்லிய இசையையும் கேட்கக்கூடிய கூர்மை பெற்றிருந்தன.,Alvarkadiyan arrived at such a ruined schoolhouse temple in the dark. The police monsters on the edge of the upper hall of the temple looked at him in horror. But is that heroic Vaishnava Sikamaniya afraid? The schoolboy jumped on the temple hall. He sat down in the shade of a tree that hung over the hall. All four were watching intently. His eyes had the power to see through the dense darkness. His ears were sharp enough to hear very soft music as well.,"Finding the route through the thick forest he had made his way laboriously to the Pallipadai. Looking around everywhere, he climbed to the roof of the Pallipadai with the help of the tree next to it. After settling himself comfortably there, he waited. One hour passed by, and then two, three? But there was no sign of the men, whom he had seen near Kollidam. Azhwarkadiyan looked around sharply in the darkness while his ears were straining to hear any strange sound.","It was here that Azhwarkkadiyaan arrived, at dusk. Terrifying demons, carved in glorious detail guarded the crumbling ruins and glared balefully at Nambi, from atop the edges of the temple's mandapam. Their stony stares bounced off the rotund man harmlessly—he was hardly the type to be nervous at their presence. Azhwarkkadiyaan sprang as nimbly as he could onto the roof of the monument's mandapam, and scrambled to hide himself among a few tree branches. His sharp eyes were capable of cutting across the dense gloom; his ears perked, ready to catch the slightest sound.","It is to this ruined temple that Azhwarkadiyan came at around sunset. The gargoyles at the borders of the mandapam tried to frighten him. But the brave Vaishnavite was not easily frightened, was he? He clambered on top of the mandapam and hid on the branch of a tree that covered it. He could keep watch from there in all four directions. His eyes had the capacity to pierce the darkness. And his ears were sharp enough to detect the faintest sound."

Vandhiyathevan could even see the gates, at one point.","Therefore, Vandiyathevan allowed the palanquin and its entourage to go ahead and followed it at a safe distance.

He was certainly capable of such cavalier treatment. If so, that would explain Azhwarkkadiyaan's preoccupation with the lady; possibly, he was seeking an opportunity to speak with her.

Neither, famed Emperors in their right, would concede victory; they clashed again and again on the battlefield—which, as it turned, out, was always on Chozha soil. This was, naturally, a distressing circumstance; Chozha Nadu was strangled, like a rooster caught in a clash between mammoths; its people struggled to survive. Even here, though, Vijayalaya found a way to turn the clash of titans to his favour. He would gather his meager forces and join either the Pandiya or Pallava forces, during each altercation. Victory and defeat came to him alternately—but it could not be denied that Chozha men were rapidly becoming infected by a fierce, warrior spirit.","When he grew old, Vijayalaya Chozhar abdicated the throne in favour of his son. The war between the Pandyas and the Pallavas was at its height at that time and there were continuous battles. Varagunavarman was the Pandyan king and Aparajitha Varman the Pallava king. Most of the battles between these two kings were fought on Chozha territory. The Chozha kingdom and its people suffered, caught as they were like a chicken between two warring elephants. Vijayalaya Chozhan, however, used these battles to his own advantage. With his small army, he fought on one side or the other. Although he alternated between defeat and victory, his army continued to be in fine fettle."

The massive gates of the fort were closed. The gatekeepers were pushing the crowds to both sides of the road.

He gazed down at this important document for a while. He looked keenly into Vanathi's face. Then, he went back to gazing at the horoscope, and again, at the young woman.

At once, Vandhiyathevan sprang forward with his sword, fully intending to rip it apart, once and for all.","Although Vandiyathevan was confused, his courage did not desert him. He wasted no time in deciding what to do. He aimed and hurled his spear at the crocodile, where it pierced its back and lodged at right angles to the animal’s body.

Is that so? ” Alvarkadiyan murmured. Stood there for a while. Later, he visited the Achchivanar temple two or three times, including the Samanar temples. He deliberately came around to the left so that if he went to the right he would become the Prime Minister. Samanar saw that all the gates were well sealed in the circular ridges.","“Oho! So that is your plan is it?” murmured Azhwarkadiyan and waited outside for a while. When the temple doors, did not open, he circumambulated the temple three times and deliberately chose the left-hand direction (as the right-hand direction would count as a holy circumambulation of Lord Shiva). The artificial caves that the Jain monks had once built were all barred now.","“So that's how it is, is it?” Azhwarkkadiyaan loitered in front of the temple for a while, mumbling to himself. Then, he circled the whole precinct, Jain caves and all, two or three times, taking care to start from left to right—to do so the other way around might end in a proper pradhakshinam, or a salutary circumambulation to the much-hated Sivan within—which the fierce Vaishnavite could not countenance, at any cost. His painstaking observation did reveal something to him: every one of the manmade caves was closed.","“Oho! So that’s how it is!” mumbled Azhwarkadiyan to himself. He stood there for a while. Then he went round the temple and the catacombs two or three times. Had he gone round in a clockwise direction, it would have meant that he acknowledged the deity and was performing a pradakshinam, a ritual circumambulation. But he deliberately took an anti-clockwise direction. He found all the catacombs closed."

A good many of the homes displayed vibrant kaavi paintings upon their thinnai walls; for the most part, these seemed to be the many adventures of Muruga Peruman, or Chozha Emperors themselves—and even so, war and battle dominated the scene: Muruga Peruman chopped away head after countless head of Soora Padmasuran in one panel, while Durga's execution of evil Mahishasuran was illustrated in full and terrifying detail in another.","Pictures of different kinds had been drawn on the walls.

The evil demon tried his best to swallow Surya in one gulp, but the god's brilliant beams almost blinded him, and he couldn't. His terrible venom, Kaalakodi did, however, kill all seven horses that drove the Sun God's chariot, and Surya Bhagavan stood bewildered—for how was he to shower his rays upon the world every day, without his chariot and trusty steeds? And then, Emperor Sundara Chozha, the very epitome of compassion approached him with seven of his best stallions and requested him to nurture the world, with his life-giving light. Surya Bhagavan duly appreciated this signal service from one who was his own regal descendent.","Sundara Chozhar chose one himself and gave it to Indra. Noticing that even with his Vajrayutham, the divine thunderbolt, Indra had to exert himself doubly hard to control the elephant, Sundara Chozhar gave him an ankusam that was more powerful than the Vajrayutham.” “Later, there was a great fight between Surya, the Sun God, whose red rays give light to the whole world, and the serpent Rahu. Rahu tried to devour Dinakaran, the Sun, but could not because Dinakaran's light burned Rahu. But Rahu’s poison struck all the seven horses yoked to Surya's chariot and killed them. Surya did not know how to start out on his daily journey. Pitying his helplessness Sundara Chozhar gave him seven horses and said, ‘Yoke them to your chariot and go and wake up the world.’ The sun god praised the king who belonged to his clan for his timely help.”"

Lost, forever, would be the opportunity to meet the Chozha dynasty's most beautiful, world-renowned princess—and he would have failed in carrying out one half of Aditha Karikalar's commission.

How did she get into that palace? How does she stand there as the mediating empress among queens with such stunning costumes? What slowness was on her face? How can her beauty be ten times greater than before? Within a few moments my heart had built many sky castles! Is the day I was crowned as belonging to the Chola Empire really going to be the luckiest day of my life? Am I going to achieve the queen who captivated my soul as my title makishi? Is it going to happen by some miraculous magic, by some magical power? At the same time, something unexpected happened.

Her exquisite features seemed enhanced a thousand times, from what I remembered. Her beauty almost blinded me. My heart raced; within moments, my besotted mind had built several improbable castles in the air: Was this day, the day I'd been crowned Yuvaraja to the Chozha empire, truly about to become the happiest, of my whole life? Was she who ruled my heart and dreams, finally about to be my queen in real life as well, my pattamagishi? Had the gods bent their compassionate gaze on me finally, and wrought some sort of miracle—Indrajaalam, perhaps, or some fabulous magic trick that made all my dreams come true? “And then, my mother, Vaanamaadevi, took a couple of steps forward. “My child,” she whispered, and embraced me warmly, bestowing her blessings.

I began to build castles in the air. Was the day I was made the Crown Prince going to be the luckiest day of my life? Was the one who had stolen my heart going to be my consort?

What does that mean? Fish! Fish! What does the fish symbol represent? Cow! Is not the fish fried on the flag of Pandian? Maybe, ahaha! .. and still be! Bye! Let's look at it with a little patience.

What could be the meaning of the sign that he did with his hands? Fish! What does fish symbolize? Could it be…? Why not? It is entirely possible. I just have to wait patiently.”","So I was right, after all, mused Thirumalai, who sat well concealed in the arasu tree's thick foliage. He isn't returning to Kadambur, after all—he has a few tricks up his sleeve, this one. And I shall watch to see which way he goes. After all, didn't I see him make the sign of the fish with my own eyes? What would that mean? A fish—what does a fish represent, now—ah, could it possibly—surely not? But what else could it be? A fish is the much-vaunted symbol of the Pandiya flag—why not, then? Ah, it certainly could be! In which case, I must be just a little more patient. After all, patience rules the earth; while impatience begets a forest—but then, these days, it's far better to rule over trees and animals than a country. Still, I may as well wait and watch.","By this time Thirumalai, well-ensconced among the thick branches, began to talk to the vedalam. “It’s just as I thought. He didn’t go in the boat, so he's sure to return. When he comes back, I’ll have to find out which way he’s going. I distinctly saw his hand making the sign of the fish. Ah! Fish! Fish! What does it signify? Isn’t it the emblem on the Pandyan flag? Perhaps! Aha! Could it be? Let's wait and see. The patient will rule the earth. The impatient can rule only the forest. Let’s be patient even though it seems better these days to rule a forest than to rule the earth. Anyway, let me wait patiently and watch."

It was not without reason, then, that the Pazhuvettarayar brothers wielded such enormous power today in the Chozha country. It was not surprising that the Emperor did nothing without consulting them."

தான் உடுத்தியிருந்த பழைய ஆடைகள் என்ன ஆயின என்ற சந்தேகம் திடீரென்று வந்தியத்தேவன் மனத்தில் உதயமாயிற்று. தன்னுடைய உடைகளைப் பரிசீலனை செய்து பார்ப்பதற்காகவே தனக்கு இவ்வளவு உபசாரம் செய்து புது ஆடைகளும் கொடுத்திருக்கிறார்கள்! குந்தவை தேவியின் ஓலை தளபதியிடம் அகப்பட்டிருக்க வேண்டும்; சந்தேகமில்லை. தான் புலவர்களுடன் திரும்பிப் போய்விடா வண்ணம் தன் கையை இரும்புப் பிடியாக அவர் பிடித்ததின் காரணமும் இப்போது தெரிந்தது. ஒரு ஆளுக்கு மூன்று ஆளாய்த் தன்னுடன் அனுப்பிய காரணமும் தெரிந்தது. ஆகா! ஒரு யுக்தி! உடனே ஒரு யுக்தி கண்டுபிடிக்க வேண்டும்! — இதோ தோன்றிவிட்டது ஒரு யுக்தி! பார்க்க வேண்டியதுதான் ஒரு கை! வீரவேல்! வெற்றிவேல்!,Suddenly Vandiyadhevan wondered what had become of the old clothes he was wearing. They have given her so many compliments and new clothes just to check out her outfits! Kundavai must have been caught by the olay commander of the goddess; No doubt.

Need to find a trick right away! - Here is a trick that has appeared! A hand to see! வீரவேல்! Success!,"Suddenly he wondered what had happened to his clothes that he had taken off before having his bath. Did Chinna Pazhuvetarayar’s servants take them for inspection? Was that why he had been given new clothes? He was dead sure that the other olai was in Chinna Pazhuvetarayar’s possession. That was why Chinna Pazhuvetarayar had caught hold of his hand roughly, while in the king’s presence. And that was the reason why he had sent three soldiers to take care of him. Aha! Got it!","Abruptly, he remembered something: what on earth had become of his old clothes? There could only be one reason for why they had confiscated those tattered garments, given him rich new attire, wined and dined him—check his robes! Of course, it was all obvious now: the olai meant for Kundhavai Devi must have fallen into the Commander's hands; no doubt about it. Now he knew why he had grabbed Vandhiyathevan and held his hand so hard, preventing the young man from slipping away with the poets. The reason for the three-man strong escort was now clear as well. What he needed now was a ruse—any ruse, to get away from this terrible toil—something, anything, before Pazhuvettarayar returned—think, think—ah, yes! Here was a ruse! No time to waste; to think was to act. He would give it all he had. On guard—Vetrivel! Veeravel!","Suddenly, Vandiyathevan wondered what had happened to his old clothes. He was sure he had been honoured with a gift of new clothes only because they wanted to inspect his old ones. The commandant must have got hold of Kundavai Devi's scroll.

A plan! He had to find a plan immediately, before Pazhuvettarayar returned! He thought of a plan. Let's give it a try, he told himself. Veera vel! Vetri Vel!"

"நான் வந்த காரியம் முடிவதற்குள் அவர்களிடம் பிடிபட விரும்பவில்லை. குடமுருட்டி ஆறு வந்ததும் அச்சிறுவனிடம், ‘நான் இங்கே இறங்கிக் கொள்கிறேன், தம்பி! நீ பாட்டுக்குக் குதிரையை விட்டுக் கொண்டு போ! உன்னை நான்தான் என்று அவர்கள் தொடர்ந்து துரத்தி வருவார்கள். உன்னைப் பிடித்த பிறகு ஏமாறுவார்கள்! நான் எங்கே என்று அவர்கள் கேட்டால் ஆற்றில் விழுந்து முழுகிப் போய் விட்டதாகச் சொல்!” என்றேன். அந்தப் பையனோ அரிச்சந்திரனுடைய சந்ததியில் வந்தவன் போலிருக்கிறது. ‘நீங்கள் முழுகாத போது எப்படி முழுகி விட்டதாகப் பொய் சொல்லுவேன்?’ என்றான். அந்தப் பிள்ளை பொய் சொல்ல வேண்டிய அவசியம் ஏற்படாமலிருக்கும் பொருட்டு, அவனைக் குதிரையில் சேர்த்துக் கட்டி விட்டு, நான் நதியில் குதித்து முழுகி விட்டேன்.","I didn’t want to catch up with them until the thing I came for was over. When the torrent came, he said to the boy, ‘I am going down here, brother! You leave the horse for the song! They will continue to chase you saying I am you. They will be fooled after catching you! If they ask me where I am, tell them I fell into the river and drowned! ” என்றேன். The boy looks like a descendant of Arichandran. ‘How can I lie that you are full when you are not full?’ He said. In order not to need to lie to the child, I tied him to the horse and I jumped into the river and drowned.","“I took Senthan Amudan along with me on the horse, as I was not sure of the route to Pazhaiarai. Chinna Pazhuvetarayar’s soldiers were hot in pursuit behind me. When we reached Kudamurattu River, I dismounted from the horse. I told him to go ahead for a while, pretending to be me, and when the soldiers come closer, I asked him to tell them that I had drowned in the river. I thought that it would give me time enough to escape. But the youth seemed to be a scion of Harish Chandra Maharaja’s [157]noble lineage, because he asked, ‘How can I say that you have drowned, when you have not?’ So, I had to drown, to spare him the sin of lying.","As I mentioned, I had no wish to go to their prisons before I could accomplish my task; when we arrived at the Kudamurutti, I instructed the young boy to carry on, upon the horse, while I stepped down at this point. They will believe me to be the rider and go after you in pursuit, I said to him. Once they have you, they will realize their mistake. Should they question you about my whereabouts, tell them I fell into the river and drowned! But that dratted boy appeared to have been a direct descendent of King Harichandra himself. How may I lie that you drowned, when you're no such thing?' he asked. And so, my lady, I had to turn my lie into the truth—all for the sake of his testimony. I tied him up to the horse well and good, and jumped headfirst into the river.","I didn’t want to be caught before I finished my work, so as soon as we reached the Kudamurutti, I said to the boy, “Thambi! I'll get down here. You go on with the horse. They’ll think it's me on the horse and chase you, and realize their mistake only when they catch you. If they ask you, tell them I fell into the river and drowned.” But the boy couldn’t tell a lie, he seems to be a descendant of [31]Harichandra! ‘ How can I say that when you haven’t drowned?” he asked. To make sure he didn’t have to tell a lie, I tied him to the horse and jumped into the river."

பின்னால் யாரும் தொடர்ந்து வரவில்லையென்று நிச்சயமான பிறகுதான் நின்றான். அந்த இரவு அனுபவத்தை நினைத்ததும் வந்தியத்தேவனுடைய உடம்பெல்லாம் இப்போதுகூட கிடுகிடுவென்று நடுங்கியது.,He stood only after making sure no one was following behind. Vandiyadeva's body was still trembling at the thought of that night's experience.,He ran away from there without looking back and rested only after he was sure that he was not followed. “Ayya!,"Only when he was sure of no pursuit did he stop, finally, catching his breath. His legs shook, and body trembled even now, when he recalled that night.","Vandiyathevan had followed it and had not stopped or turned back until he had covered some distance and was sure no one was following him. Even now, he trembled whenever he thought of that night's experience."
"பல்லக்கு தஞ்சாவூர் இருந்த தென்திசை நோக்கித் திரும்பியது. அவ்வளவுதான், வந்தியத்தேவன் திருவையாற்றில் தங்கும் எண்ணத்தை விட்டு விட்டான். அந்தப் பல்லக்கைப் பின் தொடர்ந்து செல்லத் தீர்மானித்தான். என்ன நோக்கத்துடன் அப்படித் தீர்மானித்தான் என்றால், அது அச்சமயம் அவனுக்கே தெரிந்திருக்கவில்லை. பல்லக்கில் வீற்றிருப்பது மதுராந்தகத் தேவர் என்று மட்டும் அவனுக்கு நிச்சயமாய்த் தெரிந்தது. அவர் மேல் ஏற்பட்டிருந்த அருவருப்பு மேலும் சிறிது வளர்ந்தது. ஆனாலும் பல்லக்கைத் தொடர்ந்து கொஞ்சம் போனால், ஏதாவது ஒரு நல்ல சந்தர்ப்பம் ஏற்படலாம்.","The tooth turned towards Tendisai which was Thanjavur. That is all, Vandiyadhevan gave up the idea of staying in Thiruvaiyar. He decided to go after the university. If he had made such a decision, it was not known to him at that time. All he knew for sure was that there was a Madurantaka deity in Pallak. The disgust he had experienced over and over grew a little more. But with good credit, you might find exactly what you need.","The palanquin was proceeding towards Thanjavur. Vandiya Devan immediately changed his mind about staying at Thiruvaiyaru. He started following the palanquin. Maybe for some reason, Prince Madhuranthakan might come out of the palanquin.","The palanquin turned south, towards the road to Thanjavur—and Vandhiyathevan changed his mind in an instant. Thiruvaiyaaru could wait; he would follow this palanquin. As to why he made that split-second decision, he did not quite know. All he was sure of, at that moment, was that the palanquin bore Madhuranthaka Devar—and his scorn for that man grew. Still—that was not important, now. Perhaps he would gain an opportunity to meet the prince, later on.","The palanquin turned south towards Thanjavur. So that was it. Vandiyathevan abandoned his plan to halt at Thiruvaiyaru and decided to follow the palanquin. At that point, he did not know why he took this decision. All he knew for certain was that it was Madurantaka Thevar seated inside. His dislike for him increased. But he thought he might get lucky if he followed the palanquin for a while."

But in front of this seductress, he felt that his sword might slip from his hand; his mind refused to think; he found himself wanting to agree with whatever she said.","His wits did not desert him in the presence of those warrior-lords; his shoulders set to combat with a whim; his hands never strayed far from the dagger at his hip. Wits or war; he was prepared for both.

வந்தியத்தேவன் மனமின்றித் தயக்கத்துடன் குதிரையைத் திருப்பினான். இன்னும் ஒரு முறை ஆவல் ததும்பிய கண்களுடன் இளவரசியைத் திரும்பிப் பார்த்தான். பிறகு குதிரையின் பேரில் கோபங்கொண்டவன் போல் சுளீர் என்று ஓர் அடி கொடுத்தான். ரோஸம் மிகுந்த அந்தக் குதிரை நாலு கால் பாய்ச்சலில் பிய்த்துக் கொண்டு பறந்து சென்றது. அவனைத் தொடர்ந்து போவதற்கு வைத்தியரின் புதல்வன் திணற வேண்டியிருந்தது.,Vandiyadeva reluctantly turned the horse.

Far better to take that wretched guard's course and throw the body into the river—no, no, Kandamaran was still alive; his chest rose and fell with heaving breaths; a tumultuous pulse thudded in his wrist. So far, so good—but now what? Pulling out the dagger was out of the question; blood would gush out of the wound, and kill him. No, what Kandamaran needed at once was medicine; his wounds had to be dressed with skill—but these were hardly tasks that could be done by him alone, were they?","He also wanted to make sure that Kandan Maran was still alive. What was the point of carrying a corpse? It would be better to abandon it in the river as the guard had intended. But no! He was alive! He sighed! His pulse raced! His chest heaved!

There Vadavaru, who had separated from North Kaveri, saw the scene coming into the lake. The interior of the lake was flat, some distance from the shore. They planted oak trees and shrubs in the bed to prevent damage to the shore during the floods. The reed along the shore was densely grown. From a distance, the view of the floodwaters coming from the north-west with a row of trees on both sides and mixing with the lake was like putting up a beautiful colorful sphere.","Wondering about his future, Vandiya Devan thanked his lucky stars that had brought him close to the scion of Chola Kingdom. He came to the southern end of the dam, where he noticed people picnicking with their families. Many lovely maidens were frolicking happily in the company of children and other young men.","By the time Vandhiyathevan reached this point in his ruminations, he had arrived at the southern end of the lake, and saw the magnificent sight of Vadavaaru emptying itself into it. The lake bed extended for a small stretch between the banks and the water's surface; thorny karuvela and vila trees had been planted in it to prevent damages to the shore from floods. Sturdy naanal bushes clustered thickly at the edges. In all, the sight of the Vadavaaru, with water rushing between tree-laden banks and emptying with a roar into the Veera Narayana Lake made a very pretty, colourful picture indeed, from afar.","Full of these thoughts, Vandiyathevan reached the southern corner of the lake. He saw the Vadavaru branch of the Kollidam flowing into the lake. For a short distance from the embankment the lake was dry. Karuvelu and woodapple trees had been planted on the embankment to strengthen it and prevent it from being damaged by floods. Hemp grew densely near the river. The fresh flood waters of the Vadavaru flowing from the southwest and the trees lining its banks, together with the Veeranam Lake itself, was like a beautiful painting."

Their efforts to bring their faiths to the masses proved to be extraordinarily powerful; sculpture and music played a great part in their work, and many chose to sing the Azhwars' beautiful pasurams, and the work of three celebrated saints of Saivism, compiled as Thevaram verses, set to charming music, almost celestial in their beauty.","Arts, painting, sculpture, music and poetry were at their zenith.

Struggling to breathe, crushed as they were by these mighty giants, the Chozhas were forced to do the unthinkable : leave Uraiyur, their capital for centuries, behind. Eventually, they travelled in the direction of Kudandhai and settled upon Pazhaiyarai, in its vicinity and soon established themselves in this capital city—but never, for a moment, did they forget that it was Uraiyur that had possessed this distinction in the first place.

Of great height as well—the river must have scoured its roots and weakened them; it lay almost to half the river's breadth. Vandhiyathevan climbed onto it and staggered along its length, trying to keep his balance on a trunk that wove a little from one side to another, in the waters; its branches and leaves thrashed helplessly amidst the swirling currents. The wind howled around him as well. Vandhiyathevan made his way to the end of the tree and stuck his spear into the waters again—thank Lord Murugan!","Aha! What was this! A tree had fallen across the river. It must have been a tall tree, it lay over half the width of the river. Perhaps the floods had uprooted it. He stepped onto it and stumbled across. The tree shook with the speed at which the water flowed around it. The wind blew fiercely. When he had walked to the end, he tested the depth of the water with the lance."

I tried—believe, me I tried to weed out her memories—but I couldn't. I know I speak as though she's the one to blame—but the truth is … well, no one knows the truth except God. If anything, He's the one to be blamed for every ill. Or, perhaps, fate itself, that made us meet, and then part in such cruel fashion!”","“No, Parthiba! No! I shouldn't!

So radically did the river's route change that dry beds often transformed into nansei, or rich, fertile lands, while depressions were altered into lakes, their waves lapping greedily at the shores.","During this period, since there was no one left to guard the embankments, the Kaveri often breached its banks. When big breaches occurred, the course of the river changed drastically. The old Kaveri would become a new river and the new river would run along the old course.

Disguises like Kannan, Baladevan, Kamsan etc. came. Of them, only Cummins wore a wooden face. Vandiyadeva had an idea. He spoke to the theater troupe. Cummins said the disguise was not good enough for the game. The Kamsa impostor came to fight with him. Will the Almighty let go of the fight that came easily? “I play better than you.

Among the artists, only the man who was playing ‘Kamsa’ wore a large mask that covered his face. He deliberately picked a fight with that actor by commenting about his lack of acting prowess. Incensed by Vandiya Devan’s comments, the actor asked him to mind his own business, which ended in a fistfight. Vandiya Devan forcibly took the mask from his face and put it on and acted as Kamsa.

Of these, the last-mentioned was the only one to wear a curiously fashioned mask, as part of his disguise. A fascinating idea began to take shape in Vandhiyathevan's fertile brain. Sauntering over to the troupe, he engaged them in random conversation. “Your precious actor, the one who's playing Kamsan—not very talented, is he?” Unsurprisingly, “Kamsan” took instant exception to his flippant comments, and engaged Vandhiyathevan in a lively quarrel—and since when has our warrior ever walked away from one?

They might be stirred into protests, I admit, were Arulmozhi Varman here, but fortunately, the boy is in Ilankai and unlikely to wreck our plans.","“Aha! Who's going to ask the people? Are the people consulted before decisions are taken on affairs of state? If they dare to object, they should be prevented from involving themselves in such matters.

If he were here, the people might have tried to demonstrate their blind affection for him."

His eldest wife passed away before he could graduate. For a long time afterwards the unseen did not understand the smell. But his brother Arinjayan was the best son in beauty, knowledge and energy. He was referring to his grandfather's Paranthakan and the popular name Sundara Chola. Therefore, Kandarathithar decided that his brother Arinjayan and his son Sundara Chola should succeed him after Arinjayan.","There was a crucial reason behind this decision. King Gandaradithan’s first wife had died even before he became the King and they were childless. King Gandaradithan was uninterested in getting married again just to sire an heir. Of the three brothers, only Prince Aringhza Chola had a son, named after his grandfather as Paranthakan whom people lovingly called ‘Sundara Chola’ because of his handsome looks. King Gandaradithan had decided that after his reign, the throne would pass on to his brother Aringhza Chola and later to his nephew, Sundara Chola.","Yet another reason did exist for his decision: Kandaradithyar had been married earlier, but his wife had passed away long before he was crowned Emperor; the thought of re-marriage had never entered his heart for many years, after. Brother Arinjaya, however, had a son who excelled in not just learning and martial arts, but beauty as well: in addition to being named after his grandfather Paranthakan, he enjoyed the title of Sundara, one that had been granted lovingly, by the people themselves. It seemed only natural to Kandaradithyar that such an excellent young man should succeed Arinjaya, after his time.","There was another important reason for this decision. Kandaradithar’s wife had died before he ascended the throne and he did not remarry for a long time. His brother Arinjayan had a handsome and intelligent son. Kandaradithar wanted his brother Arinjayan to succeed him, and to be, in turn succeeded by his son."

What question is this? Will the sea not catch the moon? If not, why stretch out a thousand waves and try to jump to the full moon? Who would have thought that the blue sky did not catch Bhumadevi? If not, why is the earth staring at the earth with thousands of star eyes every night? Does the cloud not catch lightning? If he does not like it, why does he split himself and embrace the lightning with his chest so tightly? Does the beetle not catch the flower? If so, why not circle around the flower relentlessly and fall into a trance? Would anyone believe it if the wasp did not catch the bulb? If so, why fall into the light of that lamp and die? Goddess! Good question you asked! If I do not like them, then why is their shoplifting so astonishing to me? Why does the bachelor playing on the edge of their magazines make me so paranoid?. So many thoughts appeared in the heart of Vandiyadeva. But not by the tongue.","Devi! What a question to ask? It would have been more appropriate if the sea were asked if it liked the beautiful moon. If he did not like the moon, then why would it try to reach for it through the waves? Does the sky love the earth? Is that why it watches the beautiful Bhoomi Devi with countless stars all through the night? Does the cloud love the lightening? Is that why it tries to envelop it in a moment of passion and longing? Does the bee love the flower? Is that why it buzzes around hoping to drink the honey that the flower offers so sweetly? Why do you ask this question, Devi? How can I not like you? Why does my heart beat so furiously when you glance at me? Why do I become transfixed when I see that beautiful smile of yours? While these thoughts raced through his mind, he stood speechless, unable to reply to Kundavai’s question.","Well, really. What sort of a question was this? Would the ocean ever nourish a hatred for the brilliant chandran, hanging low in the night sky? And if it should, why on earth would it ever try to reach for it with a thousand of its limbs, the sea-waves? Who could ever claim that the blue sky loathed beauteous Bhooma Devi, the Earth? Why else would it gaze down at her every night, hope and longing mingling in its thousand sparkling eyes, the stars upon the velvet sky? Could it ever be that dark clouds held the dazzling lightning in revulsion? Why else did they wish so desperately to clutch hold of a power that cleaved them in half, and hold it in a close embrace? Did the bee ever loathe the flower? If so, why would it hover endlessly around blooms? Would anyone ever believe it if the vittil insect was said to abhor the gentle glow of a lamp? Else why would it fall into the light and sacrifice itself? What a question indeed, Devi. Dislike you? Why would your eyes, as they throw little glances in my direction, paralyze me into a state of ecstasy, if I truly did? Why do you think that tantalizing smile, at the edge of your lips, drives me to such madness, a sweet, sweet torture I can barely have enough of …? Such were the chaotic thoughts that chased themselves through Vandhiyathevan's heart—thoughts that he could not, however, give voice to.","Aha! What a question! Does the sea dislike the moon? Ifit does, why does it leap, trying to catch the moon, its waves a thousand arms? Who can say that the blue sky does not like Bhooma Devi, the Goddess of Earth? If it doesn’t, why does it gaze all night at the earth, its eyes a thousand stars? Can the cloud not like lightning? If it doesn’t, why does it embrace the lightning, which tries to tear itself away and flee? Can the bee not like the flower? If it doesn’t, why does it buzz around the flower ceaselessly until it loses its mind and swoons? Who would believe that the moth does not like the lamp? If it doesn’t, why does it fall into the light of the lamp and lose its life? Good question! If I don’t like you, why does your sidelong glance make me gasp? Why does the faint smile at the corner of your lips mesmerise me? All these thoughts arose in Vandiyathevan’s mind. But his tongue did not give them expression."

Did we think that from time to time even the native kingdom of the ape tribe could be reclaimed? Does it seem like any tool we used as a tool for all this will break? With such thoughts Vandiyadhevan slept for a long time after his second visit. Finally, at four o'clock in the morning, at dawn, he fell asleep.","“But who has more rights to the throne? Prince Aditya Karikalan or Prince Madhuranthakan? It seems that they both have equal rights and claims over the throne. But what is my duty now?

If they did decide to contest each other's rights—who would win? And what would his own position be, if it came down to a pitched battle? Ah, the dreams Vandhiyathevan had cherished, when he first set out from Kanchi! The fantasies he had built up, hoping to ascend to a great position in the Empire under the aegis of the Crown Prince—why, at one point, he had even nurtured hopes of winning back the Vaanar's ancient kingdom, and restoring them to their former glory! And now—now the very branch he had chosen, to clamber onto a magnificent tree, seemed about to splinter. Vandhiyathevan tossed and turned in his bed for a long time, plagued by doubts and conjectures. The fourth jaamam had arrived and with it, dawn, when he finally succumbed to sleep a second time.","Where did justice lie? Who really had the right to the throne? Aditha Karikalar? Or Maduranthakar? The more he thought about it, the more he felt that both sides were justified in their claim. Who would eventually succeed? He asked himself, what his duty was.

I thought I might even be able to retrieve what the Vana clan had once owned. But everything he had depended upon for help and support now looked as though it would disintegrate. When he returned to bed, all these thoughts crowded into Vandiyathevan’s mind, keeping him awake. Finally, just before sunrise, he drifted into sleep."

Was this a manly thing to do? Must he earn a kingdom this way? And how would he protect a kingdom obtained this way? Would he not have to depend on Pazhuvettarayar and the others? Would he not have to conform to their wishes while he reigned? In this matter, not even what the Emperor Sundara Chozhar was doing was commendable. He should not have entrusted so much power or given such importance to people like Pazhuvettarayar especially when he had two such sterling sons and when he had a daughter whose intelligence was admired the world over."

No one went there if they could help it and soon, the forest began to creep over the land. Slowly but surely, the jungle reclaimed the battlefield, and with it, the monument. Jackals made their home among thick bushes; owls and other night-birds roosted in the dark, gloomy trees. In course of time, the monument lost the few visitors who had braved forest and wild animals for worship; the temple began to fall apart. At the time of our story, it was practically in ruins.","The scene of this terrible battle lay for a long time like a wasteland, empty of vegetation. No one went near it.

As days went by, people stopped visiting the pallipadai. The temple began to crumble and was in ruins at the time of our story."

How vast is this lake? How long? How wide? Doesn't it seem that all the lakes built during the time of the Pallava emperors in Thondai Nadu were small puddles in front of this lake? Did Prince Rajadith, the son of Paranthakar of Madurai, intend to build this sea-like lake to use the wasted water in the North Kaveri? Did you count and execute it in action? What kind of genius should he have been? Who else is his equal in heroism? Didn't he climb on the elephant and fight in the lead in the battle of Takkolam? Didn't he survive by carrying the work of the fighting enemy on his chest? Didn't he reach the heroic paradise by becoming known as the 'Tunjiya Thevar on the Elephant'?","This seems bigger than any other lake that I have seen so far. He tried to remember who built it. Ah yes! Prince Rajadithan[8], the eldest son of the Great Chola King Paranthaka I. He was a wise prince if ever there was one! He built this long dam on River Kaveri to help people with farming. Building a dam was not his sole claim to greatness. He was the bravest prince seen in the recent times. Didn’t he battle his enemies, atop an elephant in Thakkolam[9] and die with a spear piercing his heart?","It was then that the true magnitude, the sheer vastness of the lake burst upon him, in all its glory. Ha—such length, and breadth! How enormous it was, seemingly endless— why, even the so-called large lakes, dug by the Pallava Emperors were nothing but tiny ponds, in comparison! And then, consider the incredible foresight of Prince Rajadithya, son of Madurai's conqueror, the illustrious Paranthaka, who had conceived the plan of diverting the Vada Kaveri's vast waters into a lake of such proportions! Indeed, who could claim to be his equal, when it came to sheer foresight, and execution of plans? For that matter, there was no one who could match his courage and valour, either. Wasn't he the warrior who had chosen to lead his armies in person, in the battle at Thakkolam? Hadn't he borne an enemy's spear in his chest as he rode his war-elephant, and ascended to heaven as a valiant soldier? Didn't he fully deserve the title “He Who Embraced Death on His Elephant,” as a result of his great deeds?","Aha! What a huge lake! How long it was! And how broad! The lakes the Pallava kings had dug in Thondai Mandalam were mere puddles in comparison to this. Instead of allowing the waters of the Kollidam to flow wastefully into the sea, Prince Rajadhithar, the son of Paranthakar, the conqueror of Madurai, had thought of this idea. He had not only conceived the plan, he was responsible for having constructed the lake as well. What a brilliant man he must have been! Who could be compared with him in valour? Seated on an elephant, had he not led his army in the Battle of Thakkolam? Did he not die and attain immortality clutching his enemy’s spear, for which he was given the prestigious title, “The Lord Who Slept on the Elephant?”"

Obviously, he had arrived in the midst of revelry and this was not, he felt, a circumstance in his favour. And yet, he felt a keen desire to know the cause for the festivities. The entrance gates did stand open, but they were guarded by armoured soldiers who held swords and spears in readiness.

His father chose the second option, with the result that Markandeyan was everything a parent could wish for: intelligent, loving, and a staunch devotee of Lord Siva. When he turned 16, however, Yama, the Lord of Death came to claim him—but Markandeyan won over him by appealing to Lord Siva, and cheated death and infirmity. He is thus held as an example for anyone who appears to have defeated old age, and retains youthful good looks. The Muraippenn Custom: From ancient times, a man's elder sister's daughter, or even his aunt/uncle's daughter—i.e., his cousin, has been considered a perfect matrimonial match, in Thamizh Nadu. The girl is referred to as his muraippenn—literally, one on whom he has a claim. This custom is the stuff of legends and folklore; stories abound of young men or heroes who carried off girls in the teeth of opposition, because she happened to be his muraippenn; sometimes, it also gave way to intense strife and conflict, between entire generations of families. In the west, marriage between cousins is considered almost incestuous now, but the practice is still widespread, and approved by families, in Thamizh Nadu. There are many who firmly believe that the muraimaaman, or thaimaaman, the girl's cousin is the only one with the right to wed her; marriage outside the family was and is severely discouraged.","Pazhuvettarayar!

It is well known that even during his time the Pallava kingdom flourished and flourished and Mamallapuram became a prosperous port through the following verse:","Within the city, King Parameshwaran Pallavan, who patronized both Saivaites and Vaishnavaites, built a huge temple for Maha Vishnu.

Thalasayana Perumal, who graces his devotes here, was visited by Thirumangaiyazhwar himself, who prostrated himself at the lord's feet and sang hymns, overcome by a veritable deluge of devotion. We may deduce from his songs, in fact, that the Pallava samrajyam was a thriving, flourishing empire even in his times, judging by the many riches and splendours mentioned in them:","In the centre of the town there was a Vinnagaram of the reclining Lord who measured the three worlds. It had been built by Parameswara Pallavan, who cherished Saivism and Vaishnavism as dearly as his eyes.

She'd sworn, she said, never to marry another human being, after our separation; that Kannan, the deity would be her husband, just as he was for Andal herself.

"இந்த ஏற்பாடுகள் எல்லாம் நடந்து முடிந்த பிறகு கண்டராதித்தரின் வாழ்க்கையில் ஓர் அதிசய சம்பவம் நிகழ்ந்தது. மழவரையன் என்னும் சிற்றரசன் திருமகளை அவர் சந்திக்கும்படி நேர்ந்தது. அந்த மங்கையர் திலகத்தின் அழகும் அடக்கமும் சீலமும் சிவபக்தியும் அவர் உள்ளத்தைக் கவர்ந்தன. முதிர்ந்த பிராயத்தில் அந்தப் பெண்மணியை மணந்து கொண்டார். இந்தத் திருமணத்தின் விளைவாக உரிய காலத்தில் ஒரு குழந்தையும் உதித்தது. அதற்கு மதுராந்தகன் என்று பெயரிட்டுப் பாராட்டிச் சீராட்டி வளர்த்தார்கள். ஆனால் அரசர், அரசி இருவருமே இராஜ்யம் சம்பந்தமாக முன்னம் செய்திருந்த ஏற்பாட்டை மாற்ற விரும்பவில்லை. தம்பதிகள் இருவரும் சிவபக்தியிலும், விரக்தி மார்க்கத்திலும் ஈடுபட்டவர்களாதலால் தங்கள் அருமைப் புதல்வனையும் அந்த மார்க்கத்திலேயே வளர்க்க விரும்பினார்கள். கேவலம் இந்த உலக சாம்ராஜ்யத்தைக் காட்டிலும் சிவலோக சாம்ராஜ்யம் எவ்வளவோ மேலானது என்று நம்பியவர்களாதலால், அந்தச் சிவலோக சாம்ராஜ்யத்துக்கு உரியவனாக மதுராந்தகனை வளர்க்க ஆசைப்பட்டார்கள்.","After all these arrangements were made, a miraculous event took place in the life of Kandaratidar. He had to meet the Chitrarasan lady named Malavarayan. He was captivated by the beauty, humility, chastity and devotion of the Mangaiyar Tilak. He married the woman in adulthood. As a result of this marriage a child was born in due course. They named it Madurantakan and developed a complimenting sergeant. But neither the king nor the queen wanted to change the arrangement that had been made before regarding the kingdom. The couple were both devout and frustrated and wanted to raise their son in that religion. Those who believed that the Shivaloka kingdom was superior to this world empire were desperate and wanted to develop Madurantakana as belonging to that Shivaloka kingdom.","Ironically after settling the issue of succession, a significant incident happened in his life - he fell in love! He met the daughter of Mazhvareyan, a petty king under the Chola reign and fell in love with her at first sight. This girl was not only beautiful but also an ardent devotee of Shiva - just like himself. This made him give up his resolution of not getting married again. Despite his advanced age, Sembiyanmadevi [129] agreed to marry him as she too had fallen in love with him! Soon, a son was born to the couple, and they named him Madhuranthakan. But Gandaradithar did not wish to change the arrangement that he already made for the kingdom. Therefore, they decided to bring up their son as an ardent Shiva devotee away from the affairs of the kingdom.","And yet—fate played its hand, once he had carried out his momentous decision; a rather strange event occurred in Kandaradithyar's life. He chanced to meet, at this late date, the young princess of the Mazhavarayar clan; her beauty, grace, virtue and deep devotion to Siva Peruman impressed him and despite his rather advanced years, he married her. A son was born to them in due course and the happy couple named him Madhuranthakan, showering him with love and affection. Neither Emperor not his consort, however, had any mind to change arrangements already made, with regard to the Chozha succession. Both were immersed in devotion to Siva Peruman and had no desire for a life full of pleasure; they wished to raise their son the same way. Firm in the belief that ascension to the magnificent Siva Peruman's eternal celestial empire was of far more merit than to the throne of puny kingdoms, they strove to ensure that Madhuranthakan was deserving of a place in a heavenly abode, rather than train him to be king of a small part of the earth.","After all this, however, something strange happened in Kandaradithar’s life. He met the daughter of Mazhavarayan, a petty king, and was attracted by her beauty, modesty and devotion to Siva. Old as he was, he married her. A son was born to them. They named him Maduranthakan, and brought him up with care and tenderness. Neither the king nor his queen wanted to alter the arrangements that had already been made for the succession to the kingdom. Since they had themselves renounced everything and spent their time in matters spiritual, they wished to bring up their beloved son in the same manner. They wanted Maduranthakan to inherit the kingdom of Siva, which they believed was greater than a kingdom on earth."

What is this? ”,“ Whose palace is it? ”,“ Whose palace is this? ”,“ What building is this? ”,“ What tower is that? ” All the while his mouth was listening.","While Vandiya Devan was thinking about all kinds of possibilities, he was not silent. He kept asking the soldiers who were with him, “Whose palace is this?”, “What temple is this?”","Seemingly immersed he might have been in the city's sights, but for all that, Vandhiyathevan had not failed to make use of his eyes and mouth; questions poured out of his lips in an unending stream. “What's that?”—“And this?—“Whose palace is that?”—“What's this building?”—“Is that a gopuram?”—“What about this mansion?” His ears pricked up every time, wondering if he would get “This is Periya Pazhuvettarayar's palace,” or “This is the young queen of Pazhuvoor's mansion,” for a reply.","He did not let his eyes and mouth stay idle while he was thinking. He kept asking the guards, “What’s this?” “Whose palace is this?” “Whose mansion is that?” “What's this building?” “What's that spire?” All the while, he waited for their replies: “This is the Periya Pazhuvettarayar's palace,” or “The Pazhuvoor Rani’s.”"

Maybe I should just go back or else maybe I should show them Karikalar’s signet ring to gain entrance,” thought Vandiya Devan.","Was there even a point in braving these men and entering the palace? Wouldn't a better purpose be served if he just turned away, at this point? Perhaps he ought to just pull out Prince Aditha Karikalar's royal insignia and display it to these idiots. That would certainly shut them up.","Why get into trouble? Should he just go back quietly? Or show them the seal with Aditha Karikalar’s insignia on it, and go in?

ஆயினும் அதனால் அவனுடைய பயம் சிறிது அகன்றது. முழுதும் அகலவில்லை. காது கொடுத்துக் கேட்டபோது அந்தக் காலடிச் சத்தம் மேலும் மேலும் கேட்டது. ஒரு சமயம் எட்டிப் போவது போல இருந்தது! இன்னொரு சமயம் நெருங்கி வருவது போல் இருந்தது! வந்தியத்தேவன் நின்ற இடத்திலேயே நின்று உற்றுக் கேட்டான். அதே சமயத்தில் ஓசை வந்த திசையை நோக்கி அவனுடைய கண்களும் உற்றுப் பார்த்தன.,Yet so did his fear a little wider. Not fully widened. The sound of footsteps could be heard more and more as I listened. Once upon a time it was like reaching out! It was as if another time was approaching! Vandiyadeva stood where he was and stared. At the same time his eyes stared in the direction of the sound.,"Ironically this made him more confident and dispelled the mad panic that had seized him earlier. He could still hear the echoes of footsteps. At times, it was loud and sometimes faint. Vandiya Devan stopped still and listened intently and at the same time he looked at the direction from which the sound appeared to be coming.","His fears might have receded a little, but he was not free of them completely. For he could still hear those terrible footfalls—sometimes they sounded far off; at others, as though they were coming straight for him. Vandhiyathevan stood rooted to the ground, listening for all he worth; his eyes swung around to the direction of the footsteps, and stared hard.","His fear subsided but did not leave him completely. He listened intently and heard more and more footsteps. Sometimes they seemed near, sometimes they seemed to go away. Vandiyathevan stood still, listening, peering in the direction of the sound."
"இதையெல்லாம் பார்த்துக் கொண்டிருந்தான் வல்லவரையன். அந்த ஒரு கணத்தில் அவன் மனத்திற்குள் தீர்மானத்துக்கு வந்து விட்டான். தீர்மானிப்பதும் தீர்மானத்தைக் காரியத்தில் நிறைவேற்றுவதும் வந்தியத்தேவனுக்கு ஒன்றுதான் என்பதை நாம் ஏற்கெனவே பல முறை பார்த்திருக்கிறோம். தீர்மானித்த பிறகு தயங்குவதென்பது அவனுடைய இயற்கைக்கு விரோதமானது. எனவே, “ஓடு! ஓடு!”, “பிடி!பிடி!” என்று கூவிக் கொண்டே வந்தியத்தேவனும், தயிர்க்காரப் பெண்ணைத் துரத்திக் கொண்டு ஓடியவர்களைத் தொடர்ந்து தானும் ஓடினான். அந்தப் பெண் சற்றுத் தூரம் ஓடி, ஒரு குறுகிய சந்தில் திரும்பினாள். பின் தொடந்து ஓடியவர்கள் அங்கே போய்ப் பார்த்தபோது தயிர்க்காரப் பெண்ணைக் காணவில்லை. மாயமாய் மறைந்து விட்டாள்! துரத்தி வந்த வீரர்களும் அவளைப் பற்றி அப்புறம் கவலைப்படவில்லை; திரும்பிவிட்டார்கள்.","Vallavarayan was watching all this. In that one moment he came to the conclusion in his mind. We have already seen many times that it is one thing for Vandiyadeva to decide and execute a resolution. It is unnatural for him to hesitate after making a decision. So, “Run! Run! ”,“ Hold! Hold! ” Vandiyadhevan shouted and ran after those who chased the yoghurt woman. The woman ran a short distance and returned to a narrow alley. Those who ran after him went there and saw that the yoghurt woman was missing. She has magically disappeared! The soldiers who chased her did not even care about her then; Have returned.","For Vandiya Devan, this was a golden opportunity. He quickly ran screaming after them. The entire scene was very chaotic with the soldiers shouting, one after the other. The Velkarar soldiers pursued the woman for some time and then gave up when they couldn’t find her anywhere.","Vandhiyathevan, watching all this, came to a sudden decision. As we have seen quite a few times before, to think was to act for our young man; the word hesitation had no place in his adventurous life. And once he had come to conclusion, to pause and reflect was alien to his very nature. Accordingly, he acted. “Run! Run!” he shrieked, and took off after the soldiers in pursuit of the young curd-seller. “Catch her! Get her!” The lass ran for a while, and into a narrow alley—but when her pursuers entered it, panting, they could see nothing of her. She had vanished! The soldiers, however, seemed to have decided that enough was enough; they gave up their sport and returned to their own.","Vandiyathevan, who had seen what happened, came to a quick decision. We already know that once Vandiyathevan decided on something, he translated thought into action very rapidly. It was not in his nature to hesitate. Shouting, “Run! Catch her, catch her,” he ran behind the girl’s pursuers. The girl ran some distance, then turned into a narrow lane. When the pursuers reached the turning, there was no sign of the girl. The soldiers thought no more about it and went back."
