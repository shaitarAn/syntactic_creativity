"Io stavo a guardarlo, stupito. O che poteva importare a quell'uomo in quello stato, a due passi ormai dalla tomba (morì difatti quattro mesi dopo la mia nomina a bibliotecario), che poteva importargli che Birnbaum Giovanni Abramo avesse fatto stampare a Lipsia nel 1738 un opuscolo in-8°? E non gli fosse almeno costata tutto quello stento la lettura! Bisognava proprio riconoscere che non potesse farne a meno di quelle date lì e di quelle notizie di musicisti (lui, così sordo!) e artisti e amatori, morti e viventi fino al 1758. O credeva forse che un bibliotecario, essendo la biblioteca fatta per leggervi, fosse obbligato a legger lui, posto che non aveva veduto mai apparirvi anima viva; e aveva preso quel libro, come avrebbe potuto prenderne un altro? Era tanto imbecillito, che anche questa supposizione è possibile, e anzi molto più probabile della prima.","I was looking at him, amazed. Or that it might have mattered to that man in that state, just a stone's throw from the grave (in fact he died four months after my appointment as librarian), that it might have mattered to him that Birnbaum Giovanni Abramo had had an in-8 pamphlet printed in Leipzig in 1738 °? And at least it hadn't cost him all that hard reading! It was really necessary to recognize that he could not do without those given there and those news of musicians (he, so deaf!) And artists and amateurs, dead and living until 1758. Or perhaps he believed that a librarian, being the library made for to read it, he was obliged to read it, since he had never seen a living soul appear there; and he had taken that book, how could he have taken another? He was so stupid that even this supposition is possible, and indeed much more probable than the first.","I would go on watching him, astonished. What could it matter to a man reduced to that state, with one foot in the grave (in fact he died four months after I was appointed librarian) , what could it matter to him that Birnbaum (John Abraham) had a pamphlet printed in octavo in Leipzig in 1738? And besides, it cost him so much effort to read. He must have decided that he needed those dates and details about musicians (deaf as he was), artists and amateurs, alive and dead, up to 1758. Or perhaps he thought that as a library is created for reading in, he, as librarian, was obliged to read, since he had never seen another living soul in there. He had selected that book and now was unable to pick another. He was so senile that this supposition is possible and actually more probable than the first.","I used to watch him in amazement. Why should a man in his condition, on the brink of the grave (in fact he died four months after my appointment as librarian), care what Birnbaum Giovanni Abramo had had printed in Leipzig in 1738 in octavo? If only this reading hadn't cost him such an effort! Apparently he was unable to do without those dates and those pieces of information about musicians (and he himself, so deaf!) and artists and amateurs, living and dead before the year 1758. Or did he perhaps think that, since a library is made for reading, and since no other living soul ever turned up there, the librarian himself was obliged to read? Perhaps he had just picked that book up at random, and he might as easily have chosen another. He was so senile that this supposition is possible, indeed much more probable than the first."

Romilda, col busto slacciato, la poppante al seno, tutta in disordine, come se - alle grida - si fosse levata di letto in fretta e in furia, si fece innanzi, m'intravide:","But too late.

"Per qual misterioso suggerimento seguivo così infallibilmente la variabilità imprevedibile nei numeri e nei colori? Era solo prodigiosa divinazione nell'incoscienza, la mia? E come si spiegano allora certe ostinazioni pazze, addirittura pazze, il cui ricordo mi desta i brividi ancora, considerando ch'io cimentavo tutto, tutto, la vita fors'anche, in quei colpi ch'eran vere e proprie sfide alla sorte? No, no: io ebbi proprio il sentimento di una forza quasi diabolica in me, in quei momenti, per cui domavo, affascinavo la fortuna, legavo al mio il suo capriccio. E non era soltanto in me questa convinzione; s'era anche propagata negli altri, rapidamente; e ormai quasi tutti seguivano il mio giuoco rischiosissimo. Non so per quante volte passò il rosso, su cui mi ostinavo a puntare: puntavo su lo zero, e sortiva lo zero. Finanche quel giovinetto, che tirava i luigi dalla tasca dei calzoni, s'era scosso e infervorato; quel grosso signore bruno arrangolava più che mai. L'agitazione cresceva di momento in momento attorno al tavoliere; eran fremiti d'impazienza, scatti di brevi gesti nervosi, un furor contenuto a stento, angoscioso e terribile. Gli stessi croupiers avevano perduto la loro rigida impassibilità.","For what mysterious suggestion did I so infallibly follow the unpredictable variability in numbers and colors? Was mine only prodigious divination in unconsciousness? And how can we explain then certain crazy obstinations, even crazy ones, the memory of which still awakens me shivers, considering that I tried everything, everything, even my life, in those blows that were real challenges to fate? No, no: I really had the feeling of an almost diabolical strength in me, in those moments, for which I tamed, fascinated luck, tied his whim to mine. And this conviction was not only in me; it had also spread rapidly to others; and by now almost everyone was following my very risky game. I don't know how many times the red passed, on which I insisted on betting: I aimed at zero, and zero came out. Even that young man, who pulled the louis from the pocket of his trousers, was shaken and fervent; that big brown gentleman was struggling more than ever. Agitation grew from moment to moment around the board; they were quivers of impatience, bursts of short nervous gestures, a fury barely contained, anguished and terrible. The croupiers themselves had lost their rigid impassivity.","I do not know what mysterious force guided me to follow so infallibly the unpredictable variability of the numbers and colours. Was I merely subconsciously guessing prodigiously successfully? How then, can certain wild fixations be explained, the memory of which still make me tremble, when I sealed my fate, staked everything I had on those bets which were really challenges to fate? No, I really felt that I had an almost diabolic power in me at those moments, by means of which I tamed and charmed Fortune and harnessed her whims to mine. I was not the only one convinced of this: it rapidly spread to others and now almost everyone was following my very risky game. Red came up an incredible number of times and I had determined to keep betting on it. I betted on zero and zero came up. Even the young man pulling money out of his trouser-pocket was startled and impressed. The large, dark gentleman gasped more than ever. The tension grew by the minute around the table. There were tremors of impatience, sudden, brief nervous gestures, a painful, and terrible passion, contained only with difficulty. Even the croupiers had lost their rigid air of impassivity.","What was the mysterious prompting that guided me infallibly through the unpredictable shifts of the numbers and colors? Was this simply a miracle of unconscious guesswork? If so, how can you explain certain mad, yes mad, fits of obstinacy which, when I think about them, still make me shiver, since I was staking everything, my whole life perhaps, on those spins which were outright challenges to fate? No, no, I felt profoundly an almost diabolical force within me, and thanks to it, I could charm and master Chance, bind it to my whim. I wasn't the only one who felt this, the same conviction spread rapidly to the others, and by now nearly all of them were following my extremely risky play. I don't know how many times red came up, as I kept obstinately betting on it. If I put my money on zero, zero came up. Even the young man who pulled the louises out of his trouser pocket was stirred and excited; the dark heavy-set man was coughing louder than ever. The excitement around the table increased from moment to moment: everyone was trembling with impatience, making brief nervous gestures, in a barely controlled hysteria, anguished and terrible. The croupiers themselves had lost their rigid impassivity."

C'era tanta gente là che buttava a manate oro e argento, come fossero rena, senza alcun timore, e dovevo temere io per la mia miseriola?","Approaching another board, where they played hard, I first spent a good while looking at the people around it: they were mostly gentlemen in tailcoats; there were several ladies; more than one seemed to me equivocal; the sight of a certain little blond little man, with big, cerulean eyes, streaked with blood and surrounded by long, almost white eyelashes, did not entrust me much, at first; he too was in tailcoat, but it was evident that he was not used to wearing it: I wanted to see him tested: he bet hard: he lost; he did not get upset: he also hit again strongly, with the next blow: go! it wouldn't go after my money. Although, at first glance, I had had that sunburn, I was ashamed of my suspicion. There were so many people there who threw gold and silver handfuls, as if they were sand, without any fear, and was I to fear for my miserable one?","I approached another table where the gambling was in full swing and stayed there a long while, scrutinising the people sitting round it. For the most part, they were men in evening dress, but there were several ladies and quite a few struck me as somewhat dubious. There was one very blond little man, with large, blue, bloodshot eyes, fringed with long, almost white lashes. At first, he did not inspire much confidence. He was in evening clothes too, but it was obvious he was not used to wearing them. I decided to watch him in action. He gambled heavily; lost; was unruffled; gambled heavily again at the next round: fine, he would not covet my few coins. Although I really had been rooked at that first sitting, I was nevertheless ashamed of being so suspicious. There were so many people there throwing down gold and silver in fistfuls, fearlessly, as if it were sand, so why should I worry about my pittance?","I went over to another table, where the stakes were high, and stood there for a long while examining the people around me. Most of them were gentlemen in tail coats, but there were a number of ladies, more than one of whom looked dubious to me. There was a very blond little man, with large, blue, bloodshot eyes with almost white lashes; at first his appearance aroused my suspicions. He was also wearing a tail coat, but it was obvious that he wasn't used to evening dress. I wanted to see him put to the test. He placed a large bet. He lost. He remained calm. He bet again, heavily this time. Now here was a man who wouldn't try to steal my poor stake. Even though I had been stung at my first attempt, I was ashamed of my own suspicion. With all these people boldly throwing away gold and silver by the handful as if it were sand, should I then fear for my own pittance?"
"Debbo confessare che quel «toccamento» inatteso mi fece pure, lì per li, una strana impressione. Ero sicuro che, se avessi levato a tempo la mano avrei ghermito quella di Papiano, e tuttavia… La delicata leggerezza del tocco e la precisione erano state, a ogni modo, meravigliose. Poi, ripeto, non me l'aspettavo. Ma perché intanto Papiano aveva scelto me per manifestar la sua remissione? Aveva voluto con quel segno tranquillarmi, o era esso all'incontro una sfida e significava: «Adesso vedrai se son contento»?","I must confess that that unexpected ""touch"" also made me, on the spot, a strange impression. I was sure that if I had raised my hand in time I would have grabbed Papiano's, and yet… The delicate lightness of the touch and the precision had been, in any case, wonderful.

Per lo meno mezza la sua pensione doveva andarsene nell'acquisto di quei libri. Già se n'era fatta una piccola biblioteca. La dottrina teosofica però non doveva soddisfarlo interamente. Certo il tarlo della critica lo rodeva, perché, accanto a quei libri di teosofia, aveva anche una ricca collezione di saggi e di studii filosofici antichi e moderni e libri d'indagine scientifica.

At least half his pension had to go into buying those books. A small library had already been built. The theosophical doctrine, however, was not to satisfy him entirely.

At least half his pension must have gone on the purchase of those books. He had already built up a small library. Theosophic doctrine however, could not satisfy him entirely.

Lo avrei gridato forte a tutti, ora: «Io, io, Mattia Pascal! Sono io! Non sono morto! Eccomi qua!». E non dover più mentire, non dover più temere d'essere scoperto! Ancora no, veramente: finché non arrivavo a Miragno… Là, prima, dovevo dichiararmi, farmi riconoscer vivo, rinnestarmi alle mie radici sepolte… Folle! Come mi ero illuso che potesse vivere un tronco reciso dalle sue radici? Eppure, eppure, ecco, ricordavo l'altro viaggio, quello da Alenga a Torino: m'ero stimato felice, allo stesso modo, allora. Folle! La liberazione! dicevo… M'era parsa quella la liberazione! Sì, con la cappa di piombo della menzogna addosso! Una cappa di piombo addosso a un'ombra… Ora avrei avuto di nuovo la moglie addosso, è vero, e quella suocera… Ma non le avevo forse avute addosso anche da morto? Ora almeno ero vivo, e agguerrito. Ah, ce la saremmo veduta!","Finally the convoy shook. Luckily I was left alone in the compartment.

I leapt to my feet, lifted my arms and heaved an interminable sigh of relief, as if a stone slab had been lifted off my chest. At last! I was coming back to life! I would be me, Mattia Pascal.

Yes, but with the lead cover of deceit placed on top.

"- Ah, bene… Ma poiché lei ha l'occhio offeso, non ci addentriamo troppo nella filosofia, eh? e cerchiamo piuttosto d'inseguire per ispasso le lucciole sperdute, che sarebbero i nostri lanternini, nel bujo della sorte umana. Io direi innanzi tutto che son di tanti colori; che ne dice lei? secondo il vetro che ci fornisce l'illusione, gran mercantessa, gran mercantessa di vetri colorati. A me sembra però, signor Meis, che in certe età della storia, come in certe stagioni della vita individuale, si potrebbe determinare il predominio d'un dato colore, eh? In ogni età, infatti, si suole stabilire tra gli uomini un certo accordo di sentimenti che dà lume e colore a quei lanternoni che sono i termini astratti: Verità, Virtù, Bellezza, Onore, e che so io… E non le pare che fosse rosso, ad esempio, il lanternone della Virtù pagana? Di color violetto, color deprimente, quello della Virtù cristiana. Il lume d'una idea comune è alimentato dal sentimento collettivo; se questo sentimento però si scinde, rimane sì in piedi la lanterna del termine astratto, ma la fiamma dell'idea vi crepita dentro e vi guizza e vi singhiozza, come suole avvenire in tutti i periodi che son detti di transizione. Non sono poi rare nella storia certe fiere ventate che spengono d'un tratto tutti quei lanternoni. Che piacere! Nell'improvviso bujo, allora è indescrivibile lo scompiglio delle singole lanternine: chi va di qua, chi di là, chi torna indietro, chi si raggira; nessuna più trova la via: si urtano, s'aggregano per un momento in dieci, in venti; ma non possono mettersi d'accordo, e tornano a sparpagliarsi in gran confusione, in furia angosciosa: come le formiche che non trovino più la bocca del formicajo, otturata per ispasso da un bambino crudele. Mi pare, signor Meis, che noi ci troviamo adesso in uno di questi momenti. Gran bujo e gran confusione! Tutti i lanternoni, spenti. A chi dobbiamo rivolgerci? Indietro, forse? Alle lucernette superstiti, a quelle che i grandi morti lasciarono accese su le loro tombe? Ricordo una bella poesia di Niccolò Tommaseo:","- Ah, well ... But since you have an offended eye, we don't go too far into philosophy, eh? and let us rather try to chase the lost fireflies, which would be our lanterns, in the darkness of human fate. I would say first of all that they are of many colors; what do you say? according to the glass that gives us the illusion, a great merchant, a great merchant of colored glass. It seems to me, however, Mr. Meis, that in certain ages of history, as in certain seasons of individual life, the dominance of a given color could be determined, eh? In every age, in fact, it is customary to establish between men a certain agreement of feelings that gives light and color to those lanterns that are the abstract terms: Truth, Virtue, Beauty, Honor, and what do I know ... And it does not seem that it was red, for example, the lantern of pagan Virtue? Violet, depressing color, that of Christian Virtue. The light of a common idea is fed by collective sentiment; if this feeling is split up, however, the lantern of the abstract term remains standing, but the flame of the idea crackles inside it and flickers and sobs, as it usually happens in all the periods that are called transitional periods. Certain fiery gusts that suddenly turn off all those lanterns are not rare in history. What a pleasure! In the sudden darkness, then the confusion of the single lanterns is indescribable: who goes this way, who goes there, who goes back, who deceives himself; no one finds the way anymore: they collide, they aggregate for a moment in ten, in twenty; but they cannot come to an agreement, and they scatter again in great confusion, in anguished fury: like ants who no longer find the ant's mouth, blocked by a cruel child. It seems to me, Mr. Meis, that we are now in one of these moments. Great darkness and great confusion! All the lanterns, turned off. Who should we turn to? Back, perhaps? To the surviving little lamps, to those that the great dead left lit on their graves? I remember a beautiful poem by Niccolò Tommaseo:","“Good. Well, since you are having trouble with your eyes, we won’t go into the philosophy too much. Indeed, just for fun, let’s try to follow the scattered fireflies, that’s our lanterns, amid the darkness of human fate. I should say first of all that they must be multicoloured; what’s your opinion? They will have the colour of the glass supplied for us by illusion, illusion, that great merchant of coloured glass. However, I do think, Signor Meis, that in certain periods of history, as at certain stages of an individual’s life, one colour tends to take precedence. In each period in fact, a certain agreement about feelings tends to establish itself amongst men, which gives light and colour to those lanterns which are represented by the abstract terms: Truth, Virtue, Beauty, Honour and so on …. Don’t you think, for example, that the lantern of pagan Virtue must have been red? Christian Virtue must have been violet, a depressing colour. The light of a common idea is fed by collective feeling; if, however, this feeling stops being general, the lantern of the abstract term stays standing, but the flame of the idea within crackles, flickers and dips, as usually happens in all periods of so-called transition. Then there are periods in history, not altogether rare, when proud gusts of wind suddenly extinguish all the lanterns. Wonderful! In the unexpected darkness there is an indescribable sense of disorientation amongst the smaller lanterns: some go hither some thither, some turn back, some falter; no-one knows the way any longer: they bump into one another, perhaps make groups for a while often or twenty, but they cannot come to any agreement and go back to being scattered about in a state of confusion and anguish and fury, like ants that can’t find the entrance to the anthill when some cruel child has blocked it up just for fun. I think, Signor Meis, that we are at one such time at this very moment. It is very dark and very confused. All the great lanterns have gone out. Who should we turn to? Should we turn back perhaps? Should we go back to the surviving lanterns which great men now dead have left burning on their tombs? I recall a lovely poem by Niccolò Tommaseo:","“Ah, good . . . But since your eye offendeth, let's not go too deeply into philosophy, eh? Just for fun, we'll try to follow those confused fireflies, our lanterns, into the darkness of man's lot. First of all, I'd say that the lanterns are of many different colors. What do you think? According to the glass that is given us by Illusion, a great merchant she is, peddling colored glass. But I also feel, Signor Meis, that in certain periods of history, as in certain seasons of the individual's life, one color predominates, rather than another. Don't you think so? In every age, men usually come to some agreement on the opinions that give light and color to those big lanterns, our opinions on abstract terms like Truth, Virtue, Beauty, Honor, and what have you . . . For example, don't you think of the big lantern of pagan Virtue as being red? Whereas Christian virtue would be violet, a depressing color. The light of a common idea is fed by collective feeling; but if this feeling splits into factions, the lantern of the abstract terms still remains, of course, but the flame inside splutters and flickers and dies down, as in all the so-called transitional periods. And history is also full of fierce gusts of wind which suddenly blow out those big lamps altogether. How wonderful! In the sudden darkness, there is an indescribable scuffle of tiny individual lanterns; some go this way, some that, some try to move backwards, others in circles. Nobody can find the path; they bump into one another or cluster together in groups of ten or twenty, but they can't agree on anything, and they scatter again in great confusion, in fury and anguish, like ants who can't find the entrance to their anthill, trampled by the whims of some cruel child. To my mind, Signor Meis, we are in one of these moments now. Darkness and confusion! All the big lanterns have been blown out. Which way are we to turn? Should we retrace our steps perhaps? Towards the surviving lamps, the lights that the great dead left burning on their tombs? I remember a lovely poem of Niccolò Tommaseo:"

But who was paying attention to it? It was, moreover, natural, since every time, in order to have greater freedom, I proposed trips to the countryside, which are more willingly done in the morning. Then I too fell in love with Romilda, even though I always continued to talk to her about Pomino's love; madly in love with those beautiful eyes, that little nose, that mouth, everything, even a little leek that she had on the back of her neck, but even with an almost invisible scar in her hand, which I kissed and I kissed and kissed them… on behalf of Pomino, madly.","It is true, I should have noticed that Malagna was never there any more, and that it might not have been insignificant that I was only received in the mornings. But who notices that sort of thing? It was, in any case, quite natural, since, in order to have more privacy, I would always propose an outing into the countryside, and these are more agreeable in the morning. Furthermore, I had fallen in love with Romilda, though I went on talking about Pomino’s love. I was madly in love with those beautiful eyes, that pretty nose, that mouth, everything, even a little mole she had on the back of her neck, even an almost invisible scar on her hand, which I kissed and kissed and kissed … on Pomino’s behalf of course, but passionately.","I admit, I should have suspected the fact that I never encountered Malagna again in her house and that, for some reason, she received me only in the morning. But who would have paid any attention to such things then? For that matter, it was only natural, because every day—to enjoy greater freedom of action—I suggested excursions into the country, and these are more pleasant in the morning. And also I had fallen in love with Romilda, though I continued to talk to her about Pomino's devotion. I was mad with love for those sweet eyes, that delicate nose, that mouth, everything, even a little wart that she had on the nape of her neck, and an almost invisible scar on her hand, which I kissed again and again and again . . . on Pomino's account . . . desperately."

"Non avvenne nulla. E pur non di meno la paura non mi passò, neppure la sera di quello stesso giorno, allorché Papiano, spiegandomi il mistero per me insolubile e terribile di quella visita, mi dimostrò ch'egli non era affatto su la traccia del mio passato, e che solo il caso, di cui da un pezzo godevo i favori, aveva voluto farmene un altro, rimettendomi tra i piedi quello Spagnuolo, che forse non si ricordava più di me né punto né poco.","Nothing happened. And yet the fear did not pass me, not even on the evening of that same day, when Papiano, explaining to me the insoluble and terrible mystery of that visit, showed me that he was not at all on the track of my past, and that only chance, which for a long time I had enjoyed favors, had wanted to give me another one, putting that Spagnuolo man back on my feet, who perhaps no longer remembered me, neither point nor little.","Nothing happened. Yet my fear remained as strong as ever and still had not left me by the evening of the same day, when Papiano explained the insoluble and terrifying mystery of that vision and proved that he was in no way on the track of my past. It was mere chance, whose favours I had been enjoying for some time, that had wanted to play another trick on me, by depositing the Spaniard at my feet, though he probably had no recolleciton of me at all.","Nothing happened. And yet, my fear wouldn't go away, not even that same evening, when Papiano explained the mystery, to me so inexplicable and terrible, of that visit, and proved he was far from being on the trail of my past.

No one had thought of introducing myself to that Signora Candida: now, to make the chain, we had to hold hands; and she sighed. It didn't seem well done, that's it. God, what a cold hand!","For the time being, I found myself next to a kind of spectre of a woman, with a sort of hummock on her head (what was it? a hat? a bonnet? a wig? what on earth was it?)

No-one had thought to introduce me to this Signorina Candida: now in order to make the chain we had to hold hands and she was sighing. She did not really approve, that was it.

Now, in order to form the chain, we had to hold hands, and she was sighing. It didn't seem proper to her, after all! My God, what a cold hand she had!"

"Una di esse, non avendo potuto metter nulla da parte, perché aveva dovuto mantenere una figlia rimasta vedova con tre bambini, s'era subito allogata altrove a servire; ma l'altra, Margherita, sola al mondo, più fortunata, poteva ora riposar la sua vecchiaja, col gruzzoletto raccolto in tanti anni di servizio in casa nostra. Ora pare che con queste due buone donne, già fidate compagne di tanti anni, la mamma si fosse pian piano rammaricata di quel suo misero e amarissimo stato. Subito allora Margherita, la buona vecchierella che già l'aveva sospettato e non osava dirglielo, le aveva profferto d'andar via con lei, a casa sua: aveva due camerette pulite, con un terrazzino che guardava il mare, pieno di fiori: sarebbero state insieme, in pace: oh, ella sarebbe stata felice di poterla ancora servire, di poterle dimostrare ancora l'affetto e la devozione che sentiva per lei.","One of them, having been unable to put anything aside, because she had had to support a widowed daughter with three children, immediately went elsewhere to serve; but the other, Margherita, alone in the world, more fortunate, could now rest her old age, with the nest egg collected in so many years of service in our house. Now it seems that with these two good women, already trusted companions for many years, the mother had slowly regretted her miserable and very bitter state. Immediately then Margherita, the good old lady who had already suspected him and did not dare to tell him, had offered her to go away with her, to her house: she had two clean bedrooms, with a small terrace overlooking the sea, full of flowers. stay together, in peace: oh, she would have been happy to still be able to serve her, to still be able to show her the affection and devotion she felt for her.","One of them had not been able to save any money, as she had been obliged to support a daughter, a widow with three children, and she had immediately found a post elsewhere. The other, Margherita, was more fortunate, and, alone in the world, was now able to retire in her old age, living off the pittance she saved up over so many years in service in our house. It would seem that my mother gently complained to these good women, trusted friends of many years’ standing, of her bitterly reduced circumstances. Margherita was a good old soul and had already suspected that mother might be unhappy but dared not say so. She immediately offered mother a home with her: she had two clean rooms and a flower-bedecked terrace that overlooked the sea. They would be together, in peace, and she would be pleased to serve her again, to show her the affection and devotion she still felt for her.","One of them, who had been unable to save any of her earnings since she had to keep a widowed daughter with three children, had easily found a place elsewhere on leaving us. But the other, Margherita, alone in the world, was more fortunate and could look forward to a comfortable old age thanks to the little nest egg saved up during her years of service in our house. Now it seems that talking with these two good-hearted old women, Mamma little by little began to complain about her wretched condition. Then Margherita, who had suspected the situation but hadn't dared say anything about it, promptly invited Mamma to come and stay with her. She had two neat little rooms with a tiny flower-filled terrace overlooking the sea; the two of them could live there together in peace. Margherita would be happy to be able to wait on Mamma again, to show the affection and devotion she felt towards her former mistress."

"Ma se il valore e il senso universalmente umano di certe mie favole e di certi miei personaggi, nel contrasto com'egli dice, tra realtà e illusione, tra volto individuale ed immagine sociale di esso, consistesse innanzi tutto nel senso e nel valore da dare a quel primo contrasto, il quale per una beffa costante della vita, ci si scopre sempre inconsistente, in quanto che, necessariamente purtroppo, ogni realtà d'oggi è destinata a scoprircisi illusione domani, ma illusione necessaria, se purtroppo fuori di essa non c'è per noi altra realtà? Se consistesse appunto in questo, che un uomo o una donna, messi da altri o da se stessi in una penosa situazione, socialmente anormale, assurda per quanto si voglia, vi durano, la sopportano, la rappresentano davanti agli altri, finché non la vedono, sia pure per la loro cecità o incredibile buonafede; perché appena la vedono come a uno specchio che sia posto loro davanti, non la sopportano più, ne provan tutto l'orrore e la infrangono o, se non possono infrangerla, se ne senton morire? Se consistesse appunto in questo, che una situazione, socialmente anormale, si accetta, anche vedendola a uno specchio, che in questo caso ci para davanti la nostra stessa illusione; e allora la si rappresenta, soffrendone tutto il martirio, finché la rappresentazione di essa sia possibile dentro la maschera soffocante che da noi stessi ci siamo imposta o che da altri o da una crudele necessità ci sia stata imposta, cioè fintanto che sotto questa maschera un sentimento nostro, troppo vivo, non sia ferito così addentro, che la ribellione alla fine prorompa e quella maschera si stracci e si calpesti?","But if the value and the universally human sense of some of my fables and of some of my characters, in the contrast as he says, between reality and illusion, between individual face and social image of it, consisted first of all in the sense and value to be given to that first contrast, which for a constant mockery of life, we always find ourselves inconsistent, since, necessarily unfortunately, every reality of today is destined to discover itself an illusion tomorrow, but a necessary illusion, if unfortunately there is no is it another reality for us? If it consisted precisely in this, that a man or a woman, placed by others or by themselves in a painful situation, socially abnormal, absurd as much as one would like, last there, endure it, represent it in front of others, until they see it , albeit for their blindness or incredible good faith; because as soon as they see it as if in a mirror placed in front of them, they no longer bear it, they feel all the horror of it and break it or, if they cannot break it, they feel it dying? If it consisted precisely in this, that a socially abnormal situation is accepted, even when looking at it in a mirror, that in this case our own illusion appears before us; and then it is represented, suffering all the martyrdom, until the representation of it is possible within the suffocating mask that we have imposed on ourselves or that by others or by a cruel necessity has been imposed on us, that is, as long as under this mask a our feeling, too alive, is it not so deeply wounded, that the rebellion finally breaks out and that mask tears and is trampled on?","But what if the universal, human meaning of certain of my stories and characters lay in the contrast, as he puts it, between reality and illusion, between the individual man’s face and the social image he presents, and consisted above all in the meaning ascribed to that primary contrast, which, thanks to one of life’s most consistent jokes, always reveals us as inconsistent beings, since, of necessity, unfortunately, everything that strikes us as a reality today is destined to be revealed as an illusion tomorrow, but a necessary illusion, since unfortunately, beyond that illusion there exists no other reality for us. What if that meaning consisted in precisely this: a man or a woman, either through their own or other people’s fault, find themselves in a difficult situation, a socially abnormal situation, as absurd as you like. This person puts up with the situation, lasts out, puts up a front for other people, until he hardly sees the problem himself, either out of blindness or an incredible degree of goodwill; but as soon as he sees his position, as if in a mirror set in front of him, he cannot bear it any longer, he is horrified and changes everything, or if he cannot change it, he is as good as dead. What if the meaning lay in this: that a situation that is socially abnormal can be accepted, even if we do see ourselves in a mirror, as long as we protect ourselves with our own particular illusion; in this case, the problem will be reflected and we will suffer all the appropriate pain whilst its reflection can be accommodated beneath the suffocating mask which we have imposed on ourselves or has been imposed by some cruel necessity, until the point when some feeling of ours, some vital passion has been too painfully violated and finally bursts out and rips up the mask and tramples it down.","But what if the universally human significance and value of some of my fables and my characters set in the contrast, as he points out between reality and illusion, between the individual’s countenance and society’s view of it, consisted first of all in the significance and value to be assigned that first contrast that, thanks to one of life’s constant jests is always revealed as non-existent? Alas, today’s every reality is necessarily destined to prove an illusion tomorrow, but a necessary illusion, since outside of it, unfortunately, there is no other reality for us. What if the significance consisted precisely in this, that a man or woman placed, by himself or by others, in a painful situation, socially abnormal, absurd if you like, remains in it, bears it, plays it out in front of others as long as he himself doesn't see it, whether through blindness or through incredible good faith? As soon as he sees it, as if a mirror had been set in front of him, he can no longer bear it, he feels all its horrors, and he breaks it, or if he can’t break it, he feels that it will kill him. Or if the significance consisted in this: that a socially abnormal situation is accepted, even when seen in a mirror, which in this case holds our own illusion up to us; and then we play it out, suffering all its pain, as long as the performance is possible behind the stifling mask that we have put on ourselves or that others, or cruel necessity, have forced on us; in other words, as long as beneath this mask some keenly felt feeling of ours isn't hurt there? Then the rebellion finally breaks out, and that mask is torn off and trampled underfoot."
"La facilità però con cui accolsi questa scusa per la indelicatezza che commettevo spiando e origliando così nascosto, mi fece sentire, intravedere ch'io ponevo innanzi il mio proprio interesse per impedirmi di assumer coscienza di quello ben più vivo che un'altra mi destava in quel momento.","However, the ease with which I accepted this excuse for the indelicacy I committed by spying and eavesdropping so hidden, made me feel, glimpse that I was putting my own interest in front of me to prevent myself from becoming aware of the much more alive one that another awakened me in that moment.","The facility however, with which I welcomed this excuse for the indelicacy I committed in spying and eavesdropping like that, made me half recognise that I consciously placed my own interests first in order to stop myself realising how much stronger was the interest aroused in me regarding one other person at that moment.","I was obliged to listen, to discover the man’s feelings on the subject of myself.

"- Non è vero. L'uomo non lo sapeva, e dunque era come se non girasse. Per tanti, anche adesso non gira. L'ho detto l'altro giorno a un vecchio contadino, e sapete come m'ha risposto? ch'era una buona scusa per gli ubriachi. Del resto, anche voi scusate, non potete mettere in dubbio che Giosuè fermò il Sole. Ma lasciamo star questo. Io dico che quando la Terra non girava, e l'uomo, vestito da greco o da romano, vi faceva così bella figura e così altamente sentiva di sé e tanto si compiaceva della propria dignità, credo bene che potesse riuscire accetta una narrazione minuta e piena d'oziosi particolari. Si legge o non si legge in Quintiliano, come voi m'avete insegnato, che la storia doveva esser fatta per raccontare e non per provare?","- It is not true. The man did not know, and therefore it was as if he did not turn. For many, even now it does not turn. I told an old farmer the other day, and you know how he answered me? which was a good excuse for drunks. Besides, you too are sorry, you cannot doubt that Joshua stopped the sun. But let's leave this alone. I say that when the Earth did not turn, and the man, dressed as a Greek or a Roman, made such a good impression and felt so highly of himself and was so pleased with his own dignity, I think well that he could succeed accepts a minute narrative and full of idle details. Do we read or do we not read in Quintilian, as you have taught me, that history had to be made to tell and not to prove?","“That’s not true. Man didn’t know about it, and so it was as if it didn’t go round. As far as lots of people are concerned, even now it doesn’t go round. I mentioned it the other day to an old farmer, and do you know what he replied? That it was a good excuse for drunks. In any case, even you must admit that Josuah stopped the sun. But enough of this, I say that in the days when the earth didn’t go round, and men looked so good in their Greek or Roman togas, felt so much at ease and were so sure of their own dignity, then perhaps they might have accepted a careful narrative, full of superfluous detail. Isn’t it true, as you yourself told me, that we read in Quintilian that history was created for the telling, not to be proven?”","“No, that's not true. Man didn't know it, and therefore it was as if it didn't turn. For many people it doesn't turn even today. I told this scientific fact the other day to an old peasant, and you know what he answered? He said it was only a good excuse for drunkards. For that matter, you can't deny that Joshua stopped the sun. But we'll skip this. What I say is that when the earth didn't turn and man was dressed in Greek or Roman clothes and looked so elegant in them and was so aware of his own dignity, I can imagine that a detailed narration, full of tiny incidents, was agreeable. Doesn't Quintilian say—as you taught me yourself—that history should be made to be told and not to be experienced?”"

"Mi guardai attorno. Sospettai che di là, sul Lungotevere, ci potesse essere qualcuno, qualche guardia, che - vedendomi da un pezzo sul ponte - si fosse fermata a spiarmi.

"Sorridevo tra me, così pensando; ma poi, vedendola andar via dal terrazzino, riflettevo che quel mio giudizio poteva anche essere errato, frutto del dispetto istintivo che ciascuno prova nel vedersi non curato; e: «Perché, del resto,» mi domandavo, «dovrebbe ella curarsi di me, rivolgermi, senza bisogno, la parola? Io qui rappresento la disgrazia della sua vita, la follia di suo padre; rappresento forse un'umiliazione per lei.

Here I represent the misfortune of his life, the folly of his father; perhaps I represent a humiliation for her. Perhaps she still regrets the time her father was on duty and did not need to rent rooms and have strangers around the house. And then a stranger like me! Perhaps I frighten her, poor child, with this eye and with these glasses… ».","I smiled to myself at this idea, but then, as I watched her leave the terrace, I reflected that I could have judged her wrongly, reacting with the spite that everyone feels when ignored. In any case, I asked myself, why should she bother about me, address me needlessly? I represented an aspect of the unfortunate side of her life, the foolishness of her father; perhaps I represented humiliation for her. Maybe she missed the times when her father was still working and did not need to rent rooms and have strangers in the house. Particularly strangers like me! Perhaps the poor child was afraid of me, with that eye of mine and those glasses.","I smiled to myself at this thought; but then, seeing her leave the terrace, I thought that my opinion might also be wrong, the fruit of the instinctive annoyance that anyone feels when he sees others ignoring him.

Here I represent the tragedy of her life, her father’s madness; perhaps I represent a humiliation for her. Perhaps she still yearns for the days when her father was working and there was no need to rent out rooms and have strangers in the house. And a stranger like me, especially!

It was so close, in fact, to his squat little legs, that his tailor—to cover those legs—had to cut his trousers very liberally, and when you saw Batta from a distance, it looked as if he were wearing a low dress, his paunch dragging."

Era, però, in carcere ancora dal 21 febbraio dell'anno precedente per un reato contro la proprietà e da tempo viveva diviso, sebbene non legalmente, dalla moglie. Dopo sette mesi di gramaglie, la Tedeschi passava a nuove nozze col Majoli, senza urtare contro nessuno scoglio burocratico.

"Se non che, giunto a Nizza, m'ero sentito cader l'animo. Gl'impeti miei giovanili erano abbattuti da un pezzo: troppo ormai la noja mi aveva tarlato dentro, e svigorito il cordoglio. L'avvilimento maggiore m'era venuto dalla scarsezza del denaro con cui avrei dovuto avventurarmi nel bujo della sorte, così lontano, incontro a una vita affatto ignota, e senz'alcuna preparazione.","Except that, when I arrived in Nice, I felt my heart drop. My youthful impetus had long since been overthrown: too much boredom had wormed me inside, and weakened my grief. The greatest disheartenment came to me from the scarcity of money with which I would have had to venture into the dark of fate, so far away, towards a completely unknown life, and without any preparation.","The problem was that when I arrived in Nice I lost heart. My youthful impetuousness had died down long ago: by now, boredom had gnawed away too long inside me, and had even blunted my sorrow. I was discouraged mainly by the paucity of the sum of money which would accompany me on my voyage into the dark night of my destiny. I could not face going so far, to a completely unknown life, without any preparation.","But then, by the time I reached Nice, I felt my spirits fail. My youthful impetuousness had long since been destroyed: ennui had sapped my strength, and my mourning had unmanned me. What discouraged me most was my scarcity of funds. With such a little sum, I would have to venture forth into the darkness of fate, travel so far, to a life of which I knew nothing, for which I was completely unprepared."

"A proposito di questo biglietto da visita, per poco non mi feci anche un motivo d'infelicità della cattiva figura che mi pareva d'aver fatta, non potendo ricambiarglielo. Non avevo ancora biglietti da visita: provavo un certo ritegno a farmeli stampare col mio nuovo nome. Miserie! Non si può forse fare a meno de' biglietti da visita? Si dà a voce il proprio nome, e via.","Speaking of this business card, I almost gave myself a reason for the unhappiness of the bad impression that I seemed to have made, not being able to reciprocate it. I didn't have business cards yet: I felt a certain restraint in having them printed with my new name. Miseries! Can't you do without business cards? You give your name out loud, and off you go.","I almost made this visiting-card another excuse for uneasiness: I felt I had made a bad impression because I was unable to give him mine in exchange. I did not yet have any cards; I felt somewhat reluctant to have them printed in my new name. In any case, surely one can do without visiting-cards; it ought to be enough just to say one’s name and have done with it.","While we're on the subject of calling cards, I almost made myself unhappy because of the poor figure I cut, unable to give him one of my own. I still hadn't had any cards made; I was somehow reluctant to have my new name printed. What pettiness! We can live without calling cards, can't we? You just speak your name aloud, and that's that."
"Così, a poco a poco, ho fatto il gusto a siffatte letture.

Don Eligio says that my book should be modelled on the ones he has dug out in the library, that is, have the same flavour. I shrug my shoulders and reply that it is not my sort of work and I have other interests.","So, little by little, I have developed a taste for this kind of reading.

"Leggendo ad alta voce questo documento, il vecchio s'accese e si commosse tanto, che, sebbene ciò ch'ei leggeva fosse affatto contrario al mio sentimento, pure mi destò ammirazione. Era stato anch'egli, dal canto suo, un eroe. N'ebbi un'altra prova, quando egli stesso mi volle narrar la storia di un certo giglio di legno dorato, ch'era pur lì, nel salone. La mattina del 5 settembre 1860 il Re usciva dalla Reggia di Napoli in un legnetto scoperto insieme con la Regina e due gentiluomini di corte: arrivato il legnetto in via di Chiaja dovette fermarsi per un intoppo di carri e di vetture innanzi a una farmacia che aveva su l'insegna i gigli d'oro. Una scala, appoggiata all'insegna, impediva il transito. Alcuni operaj, saliti su quella scala, staccavano dall'insegna i gigli. Il Re se n'accorse e additò con la mano alla Regina quell'atto di vile prudenza del farmacista, che pure in altri tempi aveva sollecitato l'onore di fregiar la sua bottega di quel simbolo regale. Egli, il marchese d'Auletta, si trovava in quel momento a passare di là: indignato, furente, s'era precipitato entro la farmacia, aveva afferrato per il bavero della giacca quel vile, gli aveva mostrato il Re ll fuori, gli aveva poi sputato in faccia e, brandendo uno di quei gigli staccati, s'era messo a gridare tra la ressa: «Viva il Re!».","Reading this document aloud, the old man became so excited and moved that, although what he was reading was quite contrary to my feeling, it nevertheless aroused admiration. For his part, he too had been a hero. I had another proof of this when he himself wanted to tell me the story of a certain lily of gilded wood, which was still there in the hall. On the morning of 5 September 1860 the King left the Royal Palace of Naples in a stick discovered together with the Queen and two gentlemen of the court: when the stick arrived in via di Chiaja he had to stop due to a hitch of carts and cars in front of a pharmacy that had on the banner the golden lilies. A ladder, leaning against the sign, prevented the passage. Some workers, having climbed that ladder, detached the lilies from the sign. The King noticed this and pointed with his hand to the Queen that act of cowardly prudence of the pharmacist, who in other times had also solicited the honor of embellishing his shop with that royal symbol. He, the Marquis d'Auletta, was at that moment passing by: indignant, furious, he had rushed into the pharmacy, had grabbed the coward by the collar of his jacket, had shown him the King outside, had then he spat in his face and, brandishing one of those detached lilies, he started shouting in the crowd: ""Long live the King!""","As he read this document out loud, the old man grew fiery and so emotional that, although what he was reading was quite contrary to my own sentiments, he nevertheless kindled my admiration. He had been a hero too, in his own way. I had further proof of this when he told me the story of a lily made of gilded wood which was there in the salon too. On the morning of September 5th 1860, the King was coming out of the Palace in Naples in a light, open carriage, with his queen and two courtiers. When the carriage arrived in the via di Chiaia, it had to stop because there was a jam of carriages and vehicles in front of a shop which had a sign bearing the golden lilies. A ladder against the sign was obstructing the roadway. Some workmen were on the ladder removing the lilies from the sign. The King realised what was happening and pointed out to the queen this act of cowardice and commonsense on the part of the pharmacist who, in different times, must have begged the honour of adorning his shop with the royal symbol. The Marchese was passing just at that moment: indignant and furious, he rushed into the pharmacy, grabbed the cowardly shopkeeper by the lapels, showed him the King outside, spat in his face and, brandishing one of the lilies that had been detached, set up the cry amid the crowd: “God save the King!”","Reading this document aloud, the old nobleman became so heated and moved that, even though what he read was quite contrary to my sentiments, he nevertheless aroused my admiration. He, too, in his way, had been a hero. I had another proof of his heroism in a story he chose to tell me: the story concerned a lily of gilded wood, also displayed there in the drawing room. On the morning of September 5, 1860, the King rode out of his palace in Naples in a little open landau with the Queen and two gentlemen of the court. When the carriage reached Via Chiaia, it had to stop because a number of wagons and carts were blocking the way, held up in front of a pharmacy which had these golden lilies on its sign. A ladder, propped up against the sign, was preventing the traffic from going on. Some workmen had climbed up the ladder and were removing the royal lilies. The King noticed this, and pointed out to the Queen this pharmacist's act of cowardly caution, this from a man who had once begged for the honor of putting the royal symbol on the front of his shop. The Marchese d’Auletta also happened to be passing by; furious, outraged, he rushed to the pharmacist, seized the coward by his coat collar and showed him the King, there in the carriage. Then the Marchese spat in the man’s face and, brandishing one of the lilies that had been removed, he shouted at the crowd: “Long live the King!”"

Si vedeva in fondo in fondo Monte Mario, Ponte Margherita e tutto il nuovo quartiere dei Prati fino a Castel Sant'Angelo; si dominava il vecchio ponte di Ripetta e il nuovo che vi si costruiva accanto; più là il ponte Umberto e tutte le vecchie case di Tordinona che seguivan la voluta ampia del fiume; in fondo, da quest'altra parte, si scorgevano le verdi alture del Gianicolo, col fontanone di San Pietro in Montorio e la statua equestre di Garibaldi.","Speaking very quietly and avoiding looking at myself (who knows what first impression I made on her!), She led me, through a dark corridor, into the room I was to rent.

"Il rumore di qualche vettura sul prossimo ponte di legno mi scoteva da quelle riflessioni; sbuffavo, mi ritraevo dalla finestra; guardavo il letto, guardavo i libri, restavo un po' perplesso tra questi e quello, scrollavo infine le spalle, davo di piglio al cappellaccio e uscivo, sperando di liberarmi, fuori, da quella noja smaniosa.","The noise of some car on the next wooden deck shook me from those reflections; I snorted, I drew back from the window; I looked at the bed, I looked at the books, I was a little perplexed between these and that, I finally shrugged my shoulders, gave a look to the hat and went out, hoping to free myself, outside, from that frenzied boredom.","The rumble of a vehicle passing over the wooden bridge nearby would shake me from my reverie. I would snort, withdraw from the window, look at the bed, the books and, undecided between the two, would eventually shrug my shoulders, grab my hat and go out, hoping to free myself of my gnawing boredom out of doors.","The sound of a carriage on the nearby wooden bridge roused me from these reflections. I sighed impatiently, and withdrew from the window. I looked at the bed, at my books, and hesitated briefly at the choice.

"Non pareva affatto in mala fede; pareva piuttosto uno sciagurato che avesse affogato la propria anima nel vino, per non sentir troppo il peso della noja e della miseria. Chinava il capo, con gli occhi chiusi, approvando tutto ciò ch'io dicevo per pigliarmelo a godere; son sicuro che se gli avessi detto che da bambini noi eravamo cresciuti insieme e che parecchie volte io gli avevo strappato i capelli, egli avrebbe approvato allo stesso modo. Non dovevo mettere in dubbio soltanto una cosa, che noi cioè fossimo cugini: su questo non poteva transigere: era ormai stabilito, ci s'era fissato, e dunque basta.","He did not appear to be in bad faith at all; he seemed rather a wretch who had drowned his soul in wine, so as not to feel too much the weight of boredom and misery. He bowed his head, with his eyes closed, approving of everything I said to take it for me to enjoy; I am sure that if I had told him that as children we had grown up together and that I had pulled his hair out several times, he would have approved the same way. I didn't have to question just one thing, that we were cousins: he could not compromise on this: it was already established, he was fixed on it, and therefore enough.","He did not seem at all insincere; he was just some poor wretch who drowned his sorrows in wine so as not to feel the full weight of his boredom and poverty. He nodded his head, eyes closed, agreeing with everything I said, just to please me. I am sure that if I had said that we had grown up together and pulled each other’s hair as children, he would have agreed in just the same way. There was just one thing he did not want placed in doubt, that we really were cousins; he was quite intransigent on this: it was an established fact, it was fixed in his head and that was that.","He seemed to be in good faith; apparently he was a poor wretch who had drowned his soul in drink, to lighten the burden of his poverty and boredom. He nodded his head, with closed eyes, agreeing to everything I said. I began to enjoy the situation. I'm sure that if I had said we were children together, had grown up together, and that I had pulled his hair time and again, he would have nodded his agreement in that same way. There was only one thing I had to accept: we were cousins. He was firm on that score; it was established, and that was that."

"- Felicissimo! Fortunatissimo! - esclamò quegli, scoprendosi, strisciando una riverenza, e stringendomi calorosamente la mano. - Mi dispiace ch'io sia stato tutto questo tempo assente da Roma; ma son sicuro che la mia cognatina avrà saputo provvedere a tutto, è vero? Se le mancasse qualche cosa, dica, dica tutto, sa! Se le bisognasse, per esempio, una scrivania più ampia… o qualche altro oggetto, dica senza cerimonie… A noi piace accontentare gli ospiti che ci onorano.","- Delighted! Very lucky! he exclaimed, uncovering himself, swiping a curtsy, and warmly shaking my hand. - I am sorry that I have been absent from Rome all this time; but I'm sure my little sister-in-law will have been able to provide for everything, is it true? If you are missing something, say, say everything, you know! If you need, for example, a larger desk ... or some other object, say without ceremony ... We like to please the guests who honor us.","“Delighted! Thrilled!’he exclaimed, doffing his cap with a flourish, bowing swiftly and warmly shaking my hand. “I am sorry I have been absent from Rome all this time, but I am sure my little sister-in-law will have looked after everything well. Am I right? If you need anything, just say, please do. For instance, if you need a larger desk … or some other item of furniture, just say, without embarrassment. We like to satisfy the guests who honour us with their presence.”","“Charmed! Delighted!” the man exclaimed, taking off his hat, bowing low, and shaking my hand warmly. “I'm sorry I've had to be away from Rome all this time, but I'm sure that my little sister-in-law here has taken good care of you. Hasn't she? If you need anything, don't hesitate to say so. For instance, if you want a larger writing desk ... or something else, speak right up . . .

"Non giovavano a nulla le vendette che di questi suoi tradimenti noi ci prendevamo. Eppure ricordo che non eran da burla. Una sera, per esempio, io e Berto, sapendo che egli soleva dormire, seduto su la cassapanca, nella saletta d'ingresso, in attesa della cena, saltammo furtivamente dal letto, in cui ci avevano messo per castigo prima dell'ora solita, riuscimmo a scovare una canna di stagno, da serviziale, lunga due palmi, la riempimmo d'acqua saponata nella vaschetta del bucato; e, così armati, andammo cautamente a lui, gli accostammo la canna alle nari - e zifff! -. Lo vedemmo balzare fin sotto al soffitto.","The revenge that we took for these betrayals of his was of no avail. Yet I remember that they were no joke. One evening, for example, Berto and I, knowing that he used to sleep, sitting on the chest, in the entrance hall, waiting for dinner, we sneaked out of bed, in which they had put us as punishment before the usual time, we managed to find a tin pipe, for service, two palms long, we filled it with soapy water in the laundry tub; and, thus armed, we went cautiously to him, we put the barrel near the nostrils - and zifff! -. We saw him leap under the ceiling.","The reprisals we took as a result of these betrayals did no good, even though I remember they were often no joke. For instance, Pinzone used to sit and sleep on the wooden chest in the entrance hall, whilst waiting for supper, so one evening, Berto and I crept surreptitiously out of bed, where we had been sent earlier than usual as a punishment. We managed to get hold of a tin tube, meant for enemas and about eight inches long, filled it with soapy water from the washing copper, and thus armed, sneaked up to him, positioned the end of the tube right under his nostrils and – whoosh! – we watched him hit the ceiling.","We took our revenge on him for these acts of treachery, but it was of no avail. Still I remember that our tricks were nothing to joke about. One evening, remembering how Tweezer used to enjoy a doze on a seat in the entrance hall while he waited for supper, Berto and I furtively crept from our beds, where we had been sent early as a punishment, and found a narrow lead pipe a few inches long. We filled it with soapy water from the laundry tub and, with this weapon, cautiously approached him, put the pipe to his nostrils and— whoosh! He jumped almost to the ceiling."

"Sì, forse anch'ella istintivamente obbediva al bisogno mio stesso, al bisogno di farsi l'illusione d'una nuova vita, senza voler sapere né quale né come. Un desiderio vago, come un'aura dell'anima, aveva schiuso pian piano per lei, come per me, una finestra nell'avvenire, donde un raggio dal tepore inebriante veniva a noi, che non sapevamo intanto appressarci a quella finestra né per richiuderla né per vedere che cosa ci fosse di là.","Yes, perhaps she too instinctively obeyed my own need, the need to have the illusion of a new life, without wanting to know which one or how.

Approfittarmi di quel furto, come se con quel denaro rubato volessi pagarla, compensarla delle speranze deluse? Ah, era vile questo mio modo d'agire! Avrebbe certo gridato di rabbia, ella, di là, e mi avrebbe disprezzato… senza comprendere che il suo dolore era anche il mio. Ebbene, cosi doveva essere! Ella doveva odiarmi, disprezzarmi, com'io mi odiavo e mi disprezzavo. E anzi per inferocire di più contro me stesso, per far crescere il suo disprezzo, mi sarei mostrato ora tenerissimo verso Papiano, verso il suo nemico, come per compensarlo a gli occhi di lei del sospetto concepito a suo carico. Sì, sì, e avrei stordito così anche il mio ladro, sì, fino a far credere a tutti ch'io fossi pazzo… E ancora più, ancora più: non dovevamo or ora andare in casa del marchese Giglio? ebbene, mi sarei messo, quel giorno stesso, a far la corte alla signorina Pantogada.","When Signorina Caporale went away, to tell Adriana my words, I wrung my hands and bit into them. Should I have regulated myself like this? Take advantage of that theft, as if with that stolen money I wanted to pay her, make up for her disappointed hopes? Ah, my way of acting was vile! She would certainly have screamed in anger, she, from there, and would have despised me ... without realizing that her pain was mine too. Well, so it had to be! She had to hate me, despise me, as I hated and despised myself. And indeed, in order to become more angry with myself, to increase his contempt, I would now have shown myself most tender towards Papiano, towards his enemy, as if to compensate him in her eyes for the suspicion conceived against him. Yes, yes, and in this way I would have stunned my thief too, yes, to the point of making everyone believe that I was crazy ... And even more, even more: shouldn't we just now go to the house of the Marquis Giglio? well, I would have started, that same day, to make court to Miss Pantogada.","When Miss Caporale left to convey my words to Adriana, I wrung my hands and bit my knuckles. Did I really have to behave like this? Did I have to take advantage of the theft like this, as if I wanted to pay her off with the stolen money, compensate her for her dashed hopes? I was behaving like a cad. She would be screaming with anger by now and despising me …. without realising that I shared her pain. Well, that was the way it had to be. She had to hate and despise me as I hated and despised myself. Now, so as to punish myself even more and feed her disdain, I would be very kind to Papiano, to her enemy, so as to seem to be compensating him for the slight on his character. This would also puzzle the thief himself, yes, everyone would assume I was going mad. There could be more …. were we not going to visit the Marchese Giglio today? Well, I would start flirting with Signorina Pepita straightaway.","When Signorina Caporale went off to report my words to Adriana, I wrung my hands and even bit them. Did I really have to behave like this? Make use of that robbery, as if with that money I wanted to pay her, compensate her for her disappointed hopes? Ah, how base my actions were! She would surely cry out with anger, there in the other room, and despise me . . . not knowing that her grief and mine were one. Well, so it had to be. She had to hate me and despise me, as I hated and despised myself. And to make her still angrier with me, to increase her contempt, I would now be very tender towards Papiano, her enemy, as if to make amends to him, before her very eyes, for the suspicion that had been cast on him. Yes, and in this way I would confound even my thief; at the end, everyone would think me mad . . . And I'd go even further : Weren't we about to visit the home of Marchese Giglio? Well, that very day I would set myself to court Señorita Pantogada."
"A un certo punto vennero a parlare della Veronica e di due statue della città di Paneade, credute immagini di Cristo e della emorroissa.","At one point they came to speak of Veronica and two statues of the city of Paneade, believed to be images of Christ and the hemorrhoid.","At one stage they started talking about Veronica and two statues in the town of Paneades, thought to be images of Christ with the woman having an issue of blood.",At a certain point they began to talk about Veronica and about the two statues in the city of Paneas that were believed to be images of Christ curing the woman with an issue of blood.
"- Il denaro? Ritrovato? Davvero? Ah, Dio sia lodato! - esclamò, levando le braccia; e corse, seguìta da me, ad annunziare esultante nel salotto da pranzo, dove Papiano e il Paleari gridavano e Adriana piangeva: - Ritrovato! ritrovato! Ecco il signor Meis! Ha ritrovato il denaro!","- Money? Found again? Really? Ah, God be praised! he exclaimed, raising his arms; and she ran, followed by me, to announce exultantly into the dining room, where Papiano and Paleari were shouting and Adriana was crying: - Found again! found! Here is Mr. Meis! He found the money!","“The money? Found? Really? Oh, thank God!” she cried, lifting up her hands and she ran, followed by me, to announce the news exultantly in the dining-room, where Papiano and Paleari were still shouting and Adriana was crying. “Found! Found! Here’s Signor Meis! He’s found the money!”","""The money? Found it again? Really? Ah, God be thanked!” she exclaimed, raising her arms in the air. And, with me following her, she ran into, the dining room where Papiano and Paleari were shouting and Adriana, weeping. Triumphant, the piano teacher announced: ""Found! It's been found! Here's Signor Meis! He's found the money again!”"
"- Ne affittiamo un'altra, - disse allora ella, alzando gli occhi con aria d'indifferenza forzata. - Di là, posta sul davanti… su la via.

It is occupied by a young lady who has been with us for two years now: she gives piano lessons… not at home.","“We do let another,” she said, raising her eyes, but with an air of deliberate indifference, “on that side, at the front of the house, overlooking the street.

"Minerva, intanto, la vecchia cagnetta, co' suoi sforzati rochi abbajamenti, non lasciava fare i convenevoli. La povera bestiola però non abbajava a noi; abbajava al cavalletto, abbajava alla poltrona bianca, che dovevano esser per lei arnesi di tortura: protesta e sfogo d'anima esasperata. Quel maledetto ordegno dalle tre lunghe zampe avrebbe voluto farlo fuggire dal salone; ma poiché esso rimaneva lì, immobile e minaccioso, si ritraeva lei, abbajando, e poi gli saltava contro, digrignando i denti, e tornava a ritrarsi, furibonda.","Meanwhile, Minerva, the old dog, with her strained, raspy barking, would not allow her to do the pleasantries. The poor animal, however, did not bark at us; she barked at the easel, she barked at the white armchair, which must have been tools of torture for her: protest and outburst of exasperated soul. That accursed three-legged device would have liked to make him flee the hall; but as it remained there, motionless and threatening, she would draw back, barking, and then leap at it, gnashing her teeth, and retreat back, furious.","Minerva meanwhile, the elderly dog, barked sharply and hoarsely and would not let us get on with normal greetings. The poor creature however was not barking at us, she was barking at the easel and at the white sofa, which must have been instruments of torture for her. Her barking was a protest and a release of irritation. She tried to chase that accursed object with its three long legs from the room, but since it remained there, motionless and menacing, she retreated barking and then leapt at it. snapping her teeth, then she would retreat again, furious.","Minerva, the old dog, with her loud, hoarse barking, prevented us from exchanging the proper greetings. The poor animal wasn't barking at us, however; she barked at the easel, at the white armchair, which for her must have represented instruments of torture. Hers was the protest, the unburdening of an exasperated spirit. She wanted to drive that cursed apparatus with its three long legs out of the drawing room; but since it stayed there, immobile and menacing, she withdrew herself, still barking, only to jump back at it again with bared teeth, then dart away furiously."

"Ragioniamo un po', arrivati a questo punto. Io n'ho viste di tutti i colori. Passare anche per imbecille o per… peggio, non sarebbe, in fondo, per me, un gran guajo. Già - ripeto - son come fuori della vita, e non m'importa più di nulla. Se dunque, arrivato a questo punto, voglio ragionare, è soltanto per la logica.","Let's think a bit, at this point.

If, therefore, having reached this point, I want to reason, it is only for logic.","Let us pause for thought, having reached this point. I have lived a little. To be thought a fool, or …. worse, would not really have been too great a misfortune for me. As I have said, I am beyond normal life, and nothing has much importance for me any more.

"Io allora gli domandai che intenzioni avesse: la madre, sì, aveva tutta l'aria d'essere una strega; ma la figliuola, ci avrei giurato, era onesta. Nessun dubbio su le mire infami del Malagna; bisognava dunque, a ogni costo, al più presto, salvare la ragazza.","I then asked him what his intentions were: his mother, yes, had all the air of being a witch; but the daughter, I could have sworn, was honest. No doubt about the infamous aims of Malagna; it was therefore necessary, at any cost, as soon as possible, to save the girl.","I then asked him what his intentions were; the mother, of course, was clearly a witch, but the daugher was honest, of this I was sure. There was no doubt about Malagna’s infamous designs, so it was imperative to rescue the girl as soon as possible.","I asked him what his intentions were. The mother, indeed, seemed a witch, but the daughter was an honest girl; I would have taken my oath on that.

"Restai al bujo, là, nella sala d'ingresso, con quella gracile bimbetta in braccio, che vagiva con la vocina agra di latte. Costernato, sconvolto, sentivo ancora negli orecchi il grido della donna ch'era stata mia, e che ora, ecco, era madre di questa bimba non mia, non mia! mentre la mia, ah, non la aveva amata, lei, allora! E dunque, no, io ora, no, perdio! non dovevo aver pietà di questa, né di loro. S'era rimaritata? E io ora… Ma seguitava a vagire quella piccina, a vagire; e allora… che fare? per quietarla, me l'adagiai sul petto e cominciai a batterle pian pianino una mano su le spallucce e a dondolarla passeggiando. L'odio mi sbollì, l'impeto cedette. E a poco a poco la bimba si tacque.","I remained in the dark, there, in the entrance hall, with that frail little girl in her arms, wailing with her sour milk voice. Dismayed, shocked, I still heard in my ears the cry of the woman who had been mine, and who now, behold, was the mother of this child not mine, not mine! while mine, ah, hadn't loved her, then! So, no, I now, no, by God! I was not to have pity on this one, nor on them. Had she remarried? And I now ... But the little one kept wailing, wailing; so ... what to do? to calm her down, I placed her on my chest and began to gently beat my hand on her shoulders and swing her while walking. The hatred subsided, the impetus yielded. And little by little the child fell silent.","I stayed there in the dark in the entrance-hall, with the pretty child in my arms, and she wailed in that piercing little voice that newborn children have. In consternation and distress, I still heard ringing in my ears the voice of the woman who had been mine and was now the mother of this child, but not my child, not mine. Mine had … but did she not love mine then? In that case, I should have no pity now on this one nor on them. So she had married again and now I … But the baby started wailing again and so what could I do? To soothe her I settled her on my chest and started to pat her little back gently and rock her as I walked. My hatred cooled, its strength died down and gradually the child fell silent.","I stayed there in the dark vestibule with that fragile little girl in my arms; she cried, her voice still bitter with milk. Upset, dismayed, I heard again in my ears the scream of that woman who had been mine and who now was the mother of this child which was not mine. Not mine! Whereas mine, my child—her mother had not loved her then! And therefore, no . . . not now, by God! I was not to have pity bn this child, nor on them. She had a new husband, hadn't she? And now I. . .

"- Ma a me, no, sa: non piace! - protestò Papiano. - Mio suocero, che è molto addentro in questi studii, ci crede. Io, fra l'altro, veda, non ho neanche il tempo di pensarci… se pure ne avessi voglia. Ho tanto da fare, tanto, con quei maledetti Borboni del marchese che mi tengono lì a chiodo! Perdo qui qualche serata. Dal canto mio, son d'avviso, che noi, finché per grazia di Dio siamo vivi, non potremo saper nulla della morte; e dunque, non le pare inutile pensarci? Ingegnamoci di vivere alla meglio, piuttosto, santo Dio! Ecco come io la penso, signor Meis. A rivederla, eh? Ora scappo a prendere in via dei Pontefici la signorina Pantogada.","- But I, no, you know: I don't like it! Papiano protested. - My father-in-law, who is well versed in these studies, believes it. I, among other things, you see, I don't even have time to think about it ... even if I wanted to. I have so much to do, so much, with those accursed Bourbons of the Marquis who keep me there a nail! I miss a few evenings here. For my part, I am of the opinion that we, as long as we are alive by the grace of God, will not be able to know anything about death; and therefore, doesn't it seem useless to think about it? Let's try to live at our best, rather, for God's sake! This is how I think, Mr. Meis. To see you again, huh? Now I run away to take Signorina Pantogada from via dei Pontefici.","“But not me, I’m not keen on it!” protested Papiano. “My father-in-law is very engrossed in these studies and he believes. I, apart from anything else, have not really had time to think about it …. even if I wanted to. I have so much to do with that damned Marchese , he keeps me so busy. I occasionally spend an evening here. My own view is that whilst we are still alive, by the grace of God, we cannot really know anything about death; and so it’s useless to even think about it, do you not agree? Surely we should use our brains to live better, for God’s sake. That’s what I think Signor Meis. Goodbye then. I’m off now to via dei Pontefici to collect Signorina Pantogada.”","“But I don't, you know. I don't enjoy it!"" Papiano protested. ""My father-in-law, who's made quite a profound study of all this—he believes in it. But, for that matter, I don't have the time to think about it . . . even if I wanted to. I'm kept so busy now with those damned Bourbons; the Marchese never gives me a moment's peace. I just pass an evening or so here, like this. For my part, I believe that as long as, by the grace of God, we're alive, we can't learn anything about death, so I see no point in worrying about it. Don't you agree? Instead, we should try to go on living as best we can. That's the way I look at it, Signor Meis. Well, see you later. Now I've got to run over to Via dei Pontefici and pick up Signorina Pantogada."""

Ma troppo recente era allora la mia triste scoperta, avevo ancor bisogno d'approfondirla bene, e l'amore e la pietà mi toglievano il coraggio d'infrangere così d'un tratto le speranze di lei e la mia vita stessa, cioè quell'ombra d'illusione che di essa, finché tacevo, poteva ancora restarmi.

Potevo mai pensare, allora, che neanche morto mi sarei liberato della moglie? lei, sì, di me, e io no di lei? e che la vita che m'ero veduta dinanzi libera libera libera, non fosse in fondo che una illusione, la quale non poteva ridursi in realtà, se non superficialissimamente, e più schiava che mai, schiava delle finzioni, delle menzogne che con tanto disgusto m'ero veduto costretto a usare, schiava del timore d'essere scoperto, pur senza aver commesso alcun delitto?","I had done it! By immediately causing her that one, severe pain, I would have spared her others, and I would not have gotten into new and more bitter entanglements.

Revealing to her that I was not Adriano Meis, I went back to being Mattia Pascal, DEAD AND STILL AMOLED! How can such things be said? This was the height of the persecution that a wife could exercise on her husband: to free herself from him, recognizing him dead in the corpse of a poor drowned man, and to weigh again, after death. on him, on him, like this. It is true that I could have rebelled, declare myself alive, then ... But who, in my place, would not have acted like me? Everyone, everyone, like me, at that point, in my shoes, would certainly have estimated a fortune to be able to free themselves in such an unexpected, unexpected, unexpected way, of his wife, his mother-in-law, of his debts, of a poor and miserable existence as my one. Could I ever think, then, that not even dead I would get rid of his wife? she, yes, of me, and I don't of her? and that the life that I had seen before me free free free, was basically only an illusion, which could not be reduced to reality, if not very superficially, and more slave than ever, slave to fictions, to lies that with so much disgust Had I been forced to use, a slave to the fear of being discovered, even without having committed any crime?","If only I had done it! If I had caused her that moment of sudden, powerful suffering, I might have spared her other suffering, and I would not have got involved in new and even more bitter entanglements. But I had made my sad discovery too recently and I needed more time to consider it carefully, and love and pity took away the courage to destroy so suddenly her hopes and my own life, that is, that shadow of an illusion that so long as I was silent she would seem to belong to me. I also realised how hateful the declaration I would have to make to her would be, that is, that I was already married; because of course, by revealing to her that I was not Adrian Meis, I would go back to being Mattia Pascal, dead and still married. There are certain things that cannot be said. This was the limit, the worst form of persecution a wife could inflict on a husband: rid herself of him, by identifying the corpse of some poor fellow as him, but continue to weigh on him like this after his death. It is true, I could have rebelled and declared myself still alive at the time …. But who would not have acted like me in my position? Anyone, anyone, in my shoes, at that stage, would, like me, have considered it a stroke of luck to be able, in such an unexpected, unhoped-for, unimaginably easy way, to get rid of wife, mother-in-law, debts and a sour, miserable existence such as I was leading. How could I have imagined then that I would never be free of my wife, even as a dead man? She free of me, but not I of her? And that the life I saw before me, one of glorious freedom, was nothing more than an illusion, which could never acquire reality, except in very superficial terms, and I would be more enslaved than ever, enslaved to fictions, to lies which I had been forced to resort to with such self-disgust, slave to the fear of being found out, without having committed any crime?","If only I had! Giving her promptly that one, abrupt sorrow, I would have spared her others, and I wouldn't have forced myself into new, worse complications. But my sad discovery was then too recent, I still had to ponder it; and love and pity deprived me of the courage to shatter in a single moment her hopes and my very life, or rather that illusion of life I could still retain, as long as I was silent. And also I felt how hateful was the declaration I would have to make to her, that I still had a wife. Yes, if I revealed to her that I wasn't Adriano Meis, I became Mattia Pascal again: dead but still married! How can a man say such things? This was the peak of a wife's persecution of her husband: freeing herself, by identifying him in the body of a poor drowned man, and yet, after his death, still weighing on him, burdening him like this. I could have rebelled, I know, by saying I was alive, but then . . . Who wouldn't have done what I did, in my place? Anyone in my shoes at that moment would have considered himself lucky to be freed, in such an unexpected, unhoped for, inconceivable way, from his wife, his mother-in-law, his debts, and a wretched, languishing existence like mine. Could I then have imagined that, even after my death, I wouldn't be free of my wife? That she would be freed from me, but not I from her? And that the life which seemed to stretch ahead of me, free, free, free, was only a mirage, which could never become reality except superficially, and that I was more than ever enslaved, bound by the fictions and lies I was forced to employ with such disgust, bound by the fear of being discovered, though I had committed no crime?"

"Molti libri curiosi e piacevolissimi don Eligio Pellegrinotto, arrampicato tutto il giorno su una scala da lampionajo, ha pescato negli scaffali della biblioteca, Ogni qual volta ne trova uno, lo lancia dall'alto, con garbo, sul tavolone che sta in mezzo; la chiesetta ne rintrona; un nugolo di polvere si leva, da cui due o tre ragni scappano via spaventati: io accorro dall'abside, scavalcando la cancellata; do prima col libro stesso la caccia ai ragni su pe'l tavolone polveroso; poi apro il libro e mi metto a leggiucchiarlo.","Many curious and very pleasant books Don Eligio Pellegrinotto, climbed all day on a lampionajo's ladder, has fished in the shelves of the library.

"- Mah, dice che va lì a piangere la sua sciagura di non aver figliuoli. La vecchia, dura, arcigna, gli risponde che gli sta bene. Pare che essa, alla morte della prima moglie del Malagna, si fosse messo in capo di fargli sposare la propria figliuola e si fosse adoperata in tutti i modi per riuscirvi; che poi, disillusa, n'abbia detto di tutti i colori all'indirizzo di quel bestione, nemico dei parenti, traditore del proprio sangue, ecc., ecc., e che se la sia presa anche con la figliuola che non aveva saputo attirare a sé lo zio.

The harsh, gruff old woman replies that it suits him. It seems that, on the death of Malagna's first wife, she had taken it upon herself to have him marry her own daughter and had made every effort to succeed; who then, disillusioned, told all sorts of things at the address of that beast, enemy of relatives, traitor of his own blood, etc., etc. to himself the uncle. Now, finally, that the old man proves to be so sorry for not making his niece happy, who knows what other wicked idea that witch may have conceived.","“Well, she says he goes there to whine about his bad luck at not having any children. The old woman, who’s hard and surly, tells him it serves him right. Apparently, when Malagna’s first wife died, this old woman took it into her head that he should marry her daughter, and tried everything to make it happen. When she was thwarted, she had plenty to say about him: he was an animal, an enemy of the family, traitor to his own blood, etc. , etc. and she even blamed her own daughter for not being able to entice her uncle. Now that the old man is so clearly . sorry not to have made his niece the happiest woman in the world, that old witch might have cooked up any number of deceits.”","“Oh, he's always going there to moan about his hard luck, about how he doesn't have any children.

Then, when she was balked, she said all kinds of things about the old monster, how he was an enemy of his own kin, betraying his own flesh and blood, etc., etc., and she even took it out on her daughter for not being smart enough to trap her uncle. Now the old man keeps saying how he regrets not having made his niece content . . . so who knows what treachery the mother may have thought up.”"

"Ne diede il pretesto Minerva. Non tenuta quel giorno in soggezione dallo sguardo della padroncina, essa, appena il pittore staccava gli occhi da lei per rivolgerli alla tela, zitta zitta, si levava dalla positura voluta, cacciava le zampine e il musetto nell'insenatura tra la spalliera e il piano della poltrona, come se volesse ficcarsi e nascondersi lì, e presentava al pittore il di dietro, bello scoperto, come un o, scotendo quasi a dileggio la coda ritta. Già parecchie volte la signora Candida la aveva rimessa a posto. Aspettando, il Bernaldez sbuffava, coglieva a volo qualche mia parola rivolta a Pepita e la commentava borbottando sotto sotto fra sé. Più d'una volta, essendomene accorto, fui sul punto d'intimargli: «Parli forte!». Ma egli alla fine non ne poté più, e gridò a Pepita:","Minerva gave the pretext. Not held that day in awe by the gaze of the mistress, she, as soon as the painter took his eyes off her to turn them to the canvas, quietly rose from the desired posture, thrust her paws and nose into the inlet between the back and the top of the armchair, as if he wanted to slip in and hide himself there, and presented to the painter the back, beautifully uncovered, like an o, shaking his upright tail almost in mockery. Several times Signora Candida had put it back in place. While waiting, Bernaldez snorted, caught a few words of mine addressed to Pepita and commented on it muttering under his breath. More than once, having noticed it, I was on the point of telling him: ""Speak out loud!"" But in the end he could take no more, and shouted to Pepita:","Minerva provided the excuse. That day she was not cowed by her mistress’s glare.

She thus presented the painter with her behind, completely exposed in a perfect ‘O’, wagging her stiff tail almost derisively. Signora Candida had already put her back in position several times.

More than once I heard him and was on the point of saying: “Louder!” but finally he could not bear it any more and shouted at Pepita:","Minerva gave the pretext. Since her mistress's gaze wasn't there to make her behave that day, as soon as the painter looked from his subject to his canvas, the dog would quietly rise from the pose, and dig her front paws and nose into the crevice between the back and the seat of the chair, as if she wanted to make a hole there and hide.

"Aveva commesso l'errore di scegliersi la moglie d'un paraggio superiore al suo, ch'era molto basso.

"A poco a poco, guardando, la febbre del giuoco prese anche me. I primi colpi mi andarono male. Poi cominciai a sentirmi come in uno stato d'ebbrezza estrosa curiosissima: agivo quasi automaticamente, per improvvise, incoscienti ispirazioni; puntavo, ogni volta, dopo gli altri, all'ultimo, là! e subito acquistavo la coscienza, la certezza che avrei vinto; e vincevo. Puntavo dapprima poco; poi, man mano, di più, di più, senza contare. Quella specie di lucida ebbrezza cresceva intanto in me, né s'intorbidava per qualche colpo fallito, perché mi pareva d'averlo quasi preveduto; anzi, qualche volta, dicevo tra me: «Ecco, questo lo perderò; debbo perderlo». Ero come elettrizzato. A un certo punto, ebbi l'ispirazione di arrischiar tutto, là e addio; e vinsi. Gli orecchi mi ronzavano; ero tutto in sudore, e gelato. Mi parve che uno dei croupiers come sorpreso di quella mia tenace fortuna, mi osservasse. Nell'esagitazione in cui mi trovavo, sentii nello sguardo di quell'uomo come una sfida, e arrischiai tutto di nuovo, quel che avevo di mio e quel che avevo vinto, senza pensarci due volte: la mano mi andò su lo stesso numero di prima, il 35; fui per ritrarla; ma no, lì, lì di nuovo, come se qualcuno me l'avesse comandato.","Little by little, as I watched, the game fever took me too. The first few shots went wrong. Then I began to feel as if in a state of very curious whimsical intoxication: I acted almost automatically, for sudden, unconscious inspirations; I aimed, every time, after the others, at the last one, there! and immediately I acquired the conscience, the certainty that I would win; and I won. At first I was aiming a little; then, little by little, more, more, without counting. Meanwhile that kind of lucid intoxication was growing in me, nor was it clouded by some failed blow, because I seemed to have almost foreseen it; indeed, sometimes, I said to myself: «Here, I will lose this; I must lose it ». I was kind of thrilled. At a certain point, I was inspired to risk everything, there and goodbye; and I won. My ears buzzed; I was all in sweat, and frozen. It seemed to me that one of the croupiers, as if surprised by my tenacious luck, was watching me. In the excitement in which I was, I felt a challenge in that man's eyes, and I risked everything again, what I had of mine and what I had won, without thinking twice: my hand went up to the same number of first, 35; I was about to portray her; but no, there, there again, as if someone had commanded me.","As I watched, the fever of the game gripped me too.

Unfortunately, at first the amounts were very small, then gradually my winnings increased and I stopped counting.

"In preda a un'ansia smaniosa, attesi, curvo, stringendomi forte con le mani i ginocchi, che Adriana si facesse al terrazzino. La lunga attesa non mi stancò affatto, anzi mi sollevò man mano, mi procurò una viva e crescente soddisfazione: supposi che Adriana, di là, non volesse arrendersi alla prepotenza di quel villano. Forse la Caporale la pregava a mani giunte. Ed ecco, intanto, colui, là nel terrazzino, si rodeva dal dispetto. Sperai, a un certo punto, che la maestra venisse a dire che Adriana non aveva voluto levarsi. Ma no: eccola!","In the throes of a frenzied anxiety, I waited, hunched over, gripping my knees tightly with my hands, for Adriana to come to the terrace. The long wait did not tire me at all, on the contrary it raised me little by little, it gave me a lively and growing satisfaction: I assumed that Adriana, from there, did not want to surrender to the arrogance of that villain. Perhaps the corporal was praying to her with folded hands. And behold, meanwhile, he, there on the terrace, was gnawed by spite. I hoped, at a certain point, that the teacher would come to say that Adriana had not wanted to get up. But no: here it is!","Anxious and restless, I waited, seated hunched up, my arms wrapped round my knees, watching for Adriana to appear on the terrace. The long wait did not tire me out in the least, indeed it gradually brought a feeling of relief and then definite growing satisfaction. I supposed that Adriana on the other side of the house had decided not to give in to the bullying of that ignoramus. Perhaps Miss Caporale was begging her on her knees. Meanwhile, there he was on the terrace, eating his heart out in annoyance. I hoped that eventually the teacher would come and say that Adriana had not wanted to get up. But no: there she was.","Filled with furious anxiety, bending over, clasping my knees, I waited for Adriana to appear on the terrace. The long wait didn’t tire me; on the contrary, it gradually calmed me and gave me an increasing sense of satisfaction. I supposed that, in her room, Adriana had refused to give in to the bullying of that villain. Perhaps the Signorina was pleading with her. And meanwhile, there on the terrace, the man was consumed with annoyance. I hoped the piano teacher would soon come back to say that Adriana chose not to get up. But no: there she was!"
"Ma il gran Terenzio non rinunziò al suo disegno. Disponendo intorno al tavolino la catena medianica, si fece sedere accanto Adriana e pose accanto a me la Pantogada.","But the great Terentius did not renounce his design. Placing the mediumistic chain around the table, she sat down next to Adriana and placed the Pantogada next to me.","But the great Terenzio did not give his plan up for lost. He arranged the medianic chain around the table, put himself next to Adriana and Pepita next to me.","But the great Terenzio wouldn't give up his plan. As he arranged us around the table in the mystical circle, he placed himself next to Adriana and put Pepita beside me."

"Per il signor Anselmo, forse, sì: ma - a dir vero - non ce ne fu molta di più per noi nelle sere successive, rispetto allo spiritismo, s'intende.","For Mr. Anselmo, perhaps, yes: but - to tell the truth - there was not much more for us in the following evenings, compared to spiritism, of course.","Perhaps that was so for Signor Anselmo, but as far as we were concerned, in truth we were no more serious in the successive evenings as far as spiritualism was concerned, at any rate.","People may not have seemed serious to Signor Anselmo that evening perhaps, but they were even less so on the evenings that followed—at least, as far as spiritualism was concerned."

"Il Paleari intanto, che - solo - non aveva provato né meraviglia né sgomento, non riusciva ancora a capacitarsi come un fenomeno così semplice e comune, quale la levitazione del tavolino, ci avesse tanto impressionato, dopo quel po' po' di meraviglie a cui avevamo precedentemente assistito.

"- Ecco, - dissi io, - pensavo alla conseguenza che lei ha tratto dal mio vezzo di stropicciarmi il dito. Conseguenza arbitraria, cara signorina. Perché i vedovi, ch'io mi sappia, non sogliono levarsi l'anellino di fede. Pesa, se mai, la moglie, non l'anellino, quando la moglie non c'è più. Anzi, come ai veterani piace fregiarsi delle loro medaglie, così al vedovo, credo, portar l'anellino.","'Well,' I said, 'I was thinking of the consequence you drew from my habit of rubbing my finger. Arbitrary consequence, dear young lady. Because widowers, as far as I know, don't usually take off the ring of faith. It weighs, if anything, the wife, not the ring, when the wife is gone. Indeed, as veterans like to wear their medals, so the widower, I think, wears the ring.","“I was just thinking,” I said, “of the conclusion you drew from my habit of rubbing my wedding-finger. Your conclusions are quite arbitrary, my dear lady, because as far as I know, widowers do not usually remove their wedding rings. If anything, it is his wife that weighs heavy on a man, not his ring when the wife is gone. Indeed, just as old soldiers like to show off their medals, so I think the widower likes to bear his wedding ring proudly.”","'There ...” I said, ""I was thinking of the conclusion that you drew from my habit of rubbing my finger. An arbitrary conclusion, my dear lady. Because, to my knowledge, widowers don't remove their wedding rings.

Indeed, just as veterans like to display their medals, so I believe widowers like to wear their wedding ring.”"
"- Ma la così detta luce, scusi, - ribatté pronto il signor Anselmo, - può servire per farci vedere ingannevolmente qua, nella così detta vita; per farci vedere di là da questa, non serve affatto, creda, anzi nuoce. Sono stupide pretensioni di certi scienziati di cuor meschino e di più meschino intelletto, i quali vogliono credere per loro comodità che con questi esperimenti si faccia oltraggio alla scienza o alla natura. Ma nossignore! Noi vogliamo scoprire altre leggi, altre forse, altra vita nella natura, sempre nella natura, perbacco! oltre la scarsissima esperienza normale; noi vogliamo sforzare l'angusta comprensione, che i nostri sensi limitati ce ne dànno abitualmente. Ora, scusi, non pretendono gli scienziati per i primi ambiente e condizioni adatti per la buona riuscita dei loro esperimenti? Si può fare a meno della camera oscura nella fotografia? E dunque? Ci sono poi tanti mezzi di controllo!","'But the so-called light, excuse me,' replied Signor Anselmo promptly, 'can be used to make us see deceptively here, in the so-called life; to let us see beyond this, it is of no use, believe me, indeed it harms. These are stupid pretensions of certain scientists with a mean heart and more petty intellect, who want to believe for their convenience that with these experiments an outrage is made to science or to nature. But no sir! We want to discover other laws, others perhaps, other life in nature, always in nature, by golly! beyond the very little normal experience; we want to strain the narrow understanding that our limited senses habitually give us. Now, sorry, don't scientists expect the first suitable environment and conditions for the success of their experiments? Can we do without the dark room in photography? And so? Then there are so many means of control!","“Well, this so-called light, begging your pardon,” responded promptly Signor Anselmo, “can only be of use to help us see dimly here in our so-called life; to help us see beyond this life it is absolutely no use at all, believe me, in fact, it is harmful. There exist certain scientists of mean spirit and even meaner intellect who are given to stupid assertions, wishing to believe for their own comfort that these experiments are an outrage to science or nature. No sir! We want to discover other laws, other forces, other life in nature, but always in nature for heaven’s sake, besides our very limited normal experience. We wish to extend the boundaries of the narrow comprehension which our limited senses allow us normally. But, excuse my saying so, scientists are the first to demand the ideal environment and conditions for the successful conclusion of their experiments. Can you do without a darkroom in photography? Well? There are after all many ways of exercising suitable control.”","“If you'll forgive me for insisting,” Signor Anselmo promptly replied, “the so-called light can also serve to make us see things mistakenly here, in our so-called life. To make us see beyond this, believe me, electric light is no help. In fact, it is harmful. You're quoting the silly opinions of certain scientists with narrow minds and even narrower hearts, who want to persuade people that experiments like ours in some way outrage science or nature. No, no! We want to discover other laws, other forces, other life in nature, but always in nature, outside our restricted normal experience. We want to break out beyond the narrow scope of our habitually limited senses. Now, I ask you, aren't scientists the first to say that environment and atmospheric conditions must be right if their experiments are to succeed? Can the photographer do without his darkroom? Well then? Besides there are all kinds of ways to check.”"

I can see the reasoning behind both reactions.","Among the few who didn’t come to see me, outside of my creditors, was Batta Malagna, even though—I was told—he had displayed great sorrow at my tragic suicide two years earlier.

"- La coscienza? Ma la coscienza non serve, caro signore! La coscienza, come guida, non può bastare. Basterebbe forse, ma se essa fosse castello e non piazza, per così dire; se noi cioè potessimo riuscire a concepirci isolatamente, ed essa non fosse per sua natura aperta agli altri. Nella coscienza, secondo me, insomma, esiste una relazione essenziale… sicuro, essenziale, tra me che penso e gli altri esseri che io penso. E dunque non è un assoluto che basti a se stesso, mi spiego? Quando i sentimenti, le inclinazioni, i gusti di questi altri che io penso o che lei pensa non si riflettono in me o in lei, noi non possiamo essere né paghi, né tranquilli, né lieti; tanto vero che tutti lottiamo perché i nostri sentimenti, i nostri pensieri, le nostre inclinazioni, i nostri gusti si riflettano nella coscienza degli altri. E se questo non avviene, perché… diciamo cosi, l'aria del momento non si presta a trasportare e a far fiorire, caro signore, i germi… i germi della sua idea nella mente altrui, lei non può dire che la sua coscienza le basta. A che le basta? Le basta per viver solo? per isterilire nell'ombra? Eh via! Eh via! Senta; io odio la retorica, vecchia bugiarda fanfarona, civetta con gli occhiali. La retorica, sicuro, ha foggiato questa bella frase con tanto di petto in fuori: «Ho la mia coscienza e mi basta». Già! Cicerone prima aveva detto: Mea mihi conscientia pluris est quam hominum sermo. Cicerone però, diciamo la verità, eloquenza, eloquenza, ma… Dio ne scampi e liberi, caro signore! Nojoso più d'un principiante di violino!","- Conscience? But conscience is useless, dear sir! Conscience, as a guide, cannot be enough. Perhaps it would be enough, but if it were a castle and not a square, so to speak; that is, if we could succeed in conceiving ourselves in isolation, and it was not by its nature open to others. In my conscience, in short, in my opinion, there is an essential relationship… safe, essential, between myself who think and the other beings who think. And therefore it is not an absolute that is sufficient in itself, let me explain? When the feelings, the inclinations, the tastes of these others that I think or that you think are not reflected in me or in you, we can neither be satisfied, nor calm, nor happy; so much so that we all struggle so that our feelings, our thoughts, our inclinations, our tastes are reflected in the conscience of others. And if this does not happen, because ... let's put it this way, the air of the moment does not lend itself to transporting and making the germs flourish, dear sir ... the germs of your idea in the minds of others, you cannot say that your conscience is enough for you . What is enough for you? Is it enough for you to live alone? to sterilize in the shadows? Eh away! Eh away! Listen; I hate rhetoric, old braggart liar, flirt with glasses. The rhetoric, of course, has fashioned this beautiful phrase with a lot of chest out: ""I have my conscience and that's enough for me."" Already! Cicero had previously said: Mea mihi conscientia pluris est quam hominum sermo. Cicero however, let's tell the truth, eloquence, eloquence, but… God forbid and free, dear sir! Nojoso more than a violin beginner!","“Conscience? No, conscience is no use, my dear fellow. Conscience is not enough as a guide. It might be enough if it were the fortress rather than the square in front, so to speak; in other words, if we could conceive of ourselves in isolation, rather than always being open to others by our very nature. Within our consciences, I think anyway, there exists one essential relationship … yes, it is the basis for everything, and it is the relationship between what I think and what I think of others. And so it is simply not sufficient as an absolute scale; am I making myself clear? When the emotions, desires, tastes of these others that I have formed a view of, or you have formed a view of, do not coincide with our own feelings , we feel dissatisfied, agitated and miserable; so much so that we are constantly battling for our own emotions, desires and tastes to be reflected in other people’s consciences. And if this does not happen because … well, the climate is not right for the seeds to germinate … the seeds of your ideas planted in the minds of others, well you cannot say that your conscience is sufficient for you. Sufficient for what? For living alone? For withering away in shadow? No no no. Listen: I hate rhetoric, rhetoric is a lying old gasbag, a bespectacled flirt. Naturally, rhetoric had produced this fine statement, to be declared with head held high: “I have my own conscience and it is enough for me.” Cicero also said; “Mea mihi conscientia pluris est quam hominum sermo.” Mind you, let’s be honest about Cicero, he’s certainly eloquent, but … God save and preserve us, he is a prize bore, worse than a learner violinist!”","“Conscience? Why, the conscience is of no use, my dear sir! It can never suffice, as a guide. That might be possible, but only if the conscience were a lofty castle, so to speak, and not the village square. That is to say, if we could imagine ourselves in isolation, and if our conscience weren't by nature open to others. In the conscience, as I see it, there is an essential—oh yes, essential—relationship between myself, who am thinking, and the other beings, of whom I think. And therefore the conscience isn't a self-sufficient absolute—do I make myself clear? When the sentiments, the tendencies, the tastes of these others, of whom I think and you think, are not reflected in me or in you, we can never be content or calm or happy. And therefore all of us struggle to have our sentiments, our thoughts, our inclinations reflected in the conscience of others. And if this process doesn’t take place because, as it were, the air at that moment refuses to carry the seeds and make them flower . . . the seeds of your idea into the mind of another, why then, my dear sir, you cannot say that your own conscience is sufficient. Sufficient for what? To allow you to live alone? To become sterile in the shadows? Ah, come, come. Mind you , I hate bombast , I hate rhetoric, that gossipy old liar, that flirt with spectacles on. Rhetoric throws out her chest and declares this fine sentence: ' I have my conscience and that’s enough for me.’ Indeed! Cicero had already said: Mea mihi conscientia pluris est quam hominum sermo’ But Cicero —let's be quite frank—eloquence, oh yes, eloquence, but . . . God save us, my dear sir! More boring than a child learning the violin!”"

"Non dirò che, alla lettura, mi tranquillassi: non potevo. La costernazione che mi teneva, fu però presto ovviata dal vedere che alla notizia del mio suicidio i giornali avevano dato le proporzioni d'uno dei soliti fatti di cronaca. Dicevano tutti, sù per giù, la stessa cosa: del cappello, del bastone trovati sul Ponte Margherita, col laconico bigliettino; ch'ero torinese, uomo alquanto singolare, e che s'ignoravano le ragioni che mi avevano spinto al triste passo. Uno però avanzava la supposizione che ci fosse di mezzo una «ragione intima», fondandosi sul «diverbio con un giovane pittore spagnuolo, in casa di un notissimo personaggio del mondo clericale».","I will not say that, when reading, I calmed down: I could not. The consternation that held me, however, was soon obviated by seeing that the news of my suicide had been given the proportions of one of the usual news stories. They all said, up and down, the same thing: about the hat, about the cane found on the Margaret Bridge, with the laconic note; that I was from Turin, a rather unusual man, and that the reasons that had pushed me to the sad step were ignorant. One, however, put forward the supposition that there was an ""intimate reason"", based on the ""quarrel with a young Spanish painter, in the house of a well-known figure of the clerical world"".","I cannot say that reading them calmed me down: that would have been impossible. The consternation that gripped me was however lessened when I saw that the papers had given my suicide the same space as any of the local petty scandals and tragedies. They all said more or less the same thing: the hat and stick found on the Ponte Margherita and the laconic note; that I was from Turin and a very odd man, and that no-one knew the reasons which had driven me to take this sad step. One, however, put forward the theory that there might be some “personal reason” based on a “disagreement with a young, Spanish painter in the house of a very well-known public figure in the clerical world.”","I won’t say that, on reading them, I was any calmer; I couldn’t be. But my suspense was at least dispelled when I saw that the newspapers had given my suicide only the space of a routine event. All of them said more or less the same thing: the hat and the cane found on the Ponte Margherita, with the brief note. I was from Turin, a rather strange man, and no one knew the motive that had driven me to take the tragic step. One paper ventured the supposition that it was a “personal matter,” basing this on the “quarrel with a young Spanish painter in the home of a figure prominent in clerical circles.”"

"Misteriosi capricci della fantasia! Per quale inesplicabile bisogno e donde mi veniva d'immaginare in quel momento mio padre, quel Paolo Meis, come uno scavezzacollo?

What inexplicable necessity caused me, at that moment, to imagine that my father, Paolo Meis, had been a wastrel? Ah yes, he had caused poor grandfather so much suffering; he had married against the old man's will and had run off to America. Perhaps he too insisted that Christ was ugly. Everything must have seemed ugly to him there in America, with his wife about to have a baby. So when he received money from grandfather, he came away at once, even with my mother in that condition."

I had to overcome my reservations and come to some decision.","No, no, my behavior wasn’t logical. I couldn’t go on like this any longer.

"Gli parvero troppi, forse perché avendo già Roberto, com'ho detto, contratto un matrimonio vantaggioso, stimò che non lo avesse danneggiato tanto, da dover rendere anche per lui.","They seemed too many to him, perhaps because having already contracted an advantageous marriage, as I have said, he estimated that it had not damaged him so much that he had to pay for him too.","It seemed too generous for him, perhaps because, as I said, since Roberto had already made a rich marriage, he thought he had not done him that much harm as to be obliged to give back his share too.","Two children were one too many, from his point of view. Because, since Roberto—as I've already said—had made a good marriage, Malagna felt that the harm he had done wasn't so great that he should make amends doubly."

"Già nella trattoria che frequentavo in quei giorni, un signore, mio vicino di tavola, s'era mostrato inchinevole a far amicizia con me. Poteva avere da quarant'anni: calvo sì e no, bruno, con occhiali d'oro, che non gli si reggevano bene sul naso, forse per il peso de la catenella pur d'oro. Ah, per questo un ometto tanto carino! Figurarsi che, quando si levava da sedere e si poneva il cappello in capo, pareva subito un altro: un ragazzino pareva. Il difetto era nelle gambe, così piccole, che non gli arrivavano neanche a terra, se stava seduto: egli non si alzava propriamente da sedere, ma scendeva piuttosto dalla sedia. Cercava di rimediare a questo difetto, portando i tacchi alti. Che c'è di male? Sì, facevan troppo rumore quei tacchi; ma gli rendevano intanto così graziosamente imperiosi i passettini da pernice.","Already in the restaurant I frequented in those days, a gentleman, my neighbor at the table, had shown his bow to make friends with me. He could have been for forty years: bald yes and no, dark, with gold glasses, which did not fit well on his nose, perhaps because of the weight of the chain, even in gold. Ah, that's such a cute little man! Imagine that, when he sat up and put his hat on his head, he immediately looked like someone else: he looked like a little boy. The defect was in his legs, so small that they didn't even reach the ground if he was sitting: he didn't really get up from sitting, but rather got off his chair. She tried to remedy this defect by wearing high heels. What's wrong with that? Yes, those heels made too much noise; but meanwhile the partridge steps made him so graciously imperious.","There was already someone, in the restaurant I frequented at that time, a man who sat at the next table, who seemed inclined to be friends with me. He was probably about forty, balding, dark, with goldrimmed glasses which kept slipping off his nose, possibly owing to the weight of the chain they were attached to, also made of gold. He was quite handsome, in fact. The surprise was that when he got up from his chair and put his hat on, he looked quite different, he looked like a small child. The problem was his legs, which were so short that they did not even touch the ground when he was sitting down. He did not exactly get up from his chair, but rather got down from it. He tried to make up for this defect by wearing high heels. And what is wrong with that? True, they made rather a lot of noise, but they did give him a delightfully dainty and imperious walk, rather like a partridge.","In the restaurant where I ate at that time, a man who sat next to me had already indicated his readiness to strike up a friendship with me. He was about forty: rather bald, dark, with gold spectacles which refused to stay on his nose, perhaps because of their heavy golden chain. Ah, he was such a nice little man! Just think: when he stood up and put his hat on his head, he immediately seemed a different person: he looked like a boy. His physical defect was his legs; they were too short; they didn't even reach the floor when he was seated. It would be incorrect to say that he rose from his chair, he climbed down from it really. He tried to compensate for this failing by wearing high heels. What's wrong with that? Yes, those heels did make too much noise; but they made his little birdlike steps so charmingly imperious."
"Il signor Anselmo però, come potei vedere poche sere dopo, non ne usava alcuno. Ma erano esperimenti in famiglia! Poteva mai sospettare che la signorina Caporale e Papiano si prendessero il gusto d'ingannarlo? e perché, poi? che gusto? Egli era più che convinto e non aveva affatto bisogno di quegli esperimenti per rafforzar la sua fede. Come uomo dabbenissimo che era, non arrivava a supporre che potessero ingannarlo per altro fine. Quanto alla meschinità affliggente e puerile dei resultati, la teosofia s'incaricava di dargliene una spiegazione plausibilissima. Gli esseri superiori del Piano Mentale, o di più sù, non potevano discendere a comunicare con noi per mezzo di un medium bisognava dunque contentarsi delle manifestazioni grossolane di anime di trapassati inferiori, del Piano Astrale, cioè del più prossimo al nostro: ecco.","Mr. Anselmo, however, as I was able to see a few evenings later, did not use any. But they were family experiments! Could he ever suspect that Signorina Caporale and Papiano were having the pleasure of deceiving him? and why, then? What taste? He was more than convinced and didn't need those experiments at all to strengthen his faith. As a very noble man that he was, he did not come to suppose that they could deceive him for any other purpose. As for the afflicting and puerile meanness of the results, theosophy took it upon itself to give him a very plausible explanation. The higher beings of the Mental Plane, or higher, could not descend to communicate with us by means of a medium, so it was necessary to be content with the gross manifestations of the souls of the lower past, of the Astral Plane, that is, of the closest to ours: here it is.","Signor Anselmo, however, as I was able to note a few evenings later, did not use any of these. They were family experiments, he claimed. How could he even suspect that Miss Caporale and Papiano might take pleasure in tricking him? Why? What pleasure could they get? He was thoroughly convinced and had no need of experimental proof to strengthen his faith. Respectable man as he was, he could not even suspect that they might have any ulterior motive for tricking him. As far as the embarrassingly pathetic puerility of the results was concerned, theosophy managed to supply him with a very plausible explanation for them. The superior beings from the Mental Plane, or higher, could not descend to communicate with us by means of a medium: we therefore had to be content with the rather crude manifestations of souls from lower zones, the Astral Plane, the one closest to us, so there you are.","But as I could see for myself a few evenings later, Signor Anselmo used none of these. The experiments were all in the family! Could he ever suspect that Signorina Caporale and Papiano might enjoy deceiving him? Why should they? Where was the amusement in that? He was completely convinced, and he didn't need these experiments to strengthen his own faith. Perfect gentleman that he was, he never supposed that they might deceive him for some other end. As to the melancholy wretchedness and childishness of the results, theosophy itself was ready to give a plausible explanation. The superior beings on the Mental Plane, or those still higher, couldn't come down and communicate with us through a medium; so we had to be content with the coarser manifestations of the spirits of inferior beings on the Astral Plane, the plane nearest us."

At last I understood myself, looking at Adriana's half-mourning dressing gown, and argued that Terenzio Papiano, the brother-in-law who was still in Naples, must not have looked like a witty widower, and that, consequently, this according to Miss Caporale, I had the air.","A further person, some invisible presence had clearly come and sat amongst us. Eventually, I also understood, noting the half-mourning of Adriana’s housedress and working out that Terenzio Papiano, the brother-in-law who was still in Naples, clearly could not look like a grieving widower, whereas, according to Miss Caporale, I did look like one.","A fourth person, invisible, had forced himself on us.

"Perché mostravo tanta smania di maritar Romilda? - Per niente. Ripeto: per il gusto di stordire Pomino. Parlavo e parlavo, e tutte le difficoltà sparivano. Ero impetuoso, e prendevo tutto alla leggera. Forse per questo, allora, le donne mi amavano, non ostante quel mio occhio un po' sbalestrato e il mio corpo da pezzo da catasta. Questa volta, però, - debbo dirlo - la mia foga proveniva anche dal desiderio di sfondare la trista ragna ordita da quel laido vecchio, e farlo restare con un palmo di naso; dal pensiero della povera Oliva; e anche - perché no? - dalla speranza di fare un bene a quella ragazza che veramente mi aveva fatto una grande impressione.","Why was I so eager to marry Romilda? - For nothing. I repeat: for the sake of stunning Pomino. I talked and talked, and all the difficulties disappeared. I was impetuous, and I took everything lightly. Perhaps for this reason, then, women loved me, despite my slightly bewildered eye and my body from a stack. This time, however, - I must say - my enthusiasm also came from the desire to break through the sad web hatched by that ugly old man, and make him stay with an inch of his nose; from the thought of poor Oliva; and also - why not? - from the hope of doing good to that girl who really made a great impression on me.","Why was I so eager to get Romilda wed? For no reason, just, as I said earlier, for the sheer pleasure of impressing Pomino. As I talked, all the difficulties melted away. I was impetuous and took nothing seriously. Perhaps this was the reason women liked me, in spite of my slightly wayward eye and my body like a piece of firewood. This time, however, I must admit, my zeal derived in part from a desire to destroy the squalid web woven by the hideous old man and cock a snook at him into the bargain. This zeal was fed by thoughts of the unfortunate Oliva and also, quite naturally, by the desire to help a girl who really had made a profound impression on me.","Why was I displaying such eagerness to marry off Romilda? For no reason. As I said: it was for the fun of dazzling Pomino. I went on talking, talking, and all the difficulties vanished. I was impetuous, I made light of everything. Perhaps this was why women loved me, despite my slightly off-center eye and a body like a log. This time, however—I must confess—my enthusiasm also came from the desire to outdo that loathesome Malagna and destroy the trap he was setting.

"Un singolare caso di bigamia, dovuto all'affermata ma non sussistente morte di un marito, si è rivelato in questi giorni. Risaliamo brevemente all'antefatto. Nel reparto Calvairate il 26 dicembre 1916 alcuni contadini pescavano dalle acque del canale delle «Cinque chiuse» il cadavere di un uomo rivestito di maglia e pantaloni color marrone. Del rinvenimento fu dato avviso ai carabinieri che iniziarono le investigazioni. Poco dopo il cadavere veniva identificato da tale Maria Tedeschi, ancor piacente donna sulla quarantina, e da certi Luigi Longoni e Luigi Majoli, per quello dell'elettricista Ambrogio Casati di Luigi, nato nel 1869 marito della Tedeschi.

The police were informed and investigations opened. Soon after, the body was identified by one Maria Tedeschi, an attractive woman of around forty years old, and by Luigi Longoni and Luigi Maioli, as that of an electrician, Ambrogio Casati di Luigi, born 1869 and married to Maria Tedeschi.

In fact, the drowned man bore a striking resemblance to Casati."

"Ma io ora, per ripicco, non voglio descrivere quel che seguì alla farmacia del Brìsigo prima, poi al Caffè dell'Unione, quando don Eligio, ancor tutto esultante, mi presentò redivivo. Si sparse in un baleno la notizia, e tutti accorsero a vedermi e a tempestarmi di domande. Volevano sapere da me chi fosse allora colui che s'era annegato alla Stìa, come se non mi avessero riconosciuto loro: tutti, a uno a uno. E dunque ero io, proprio io: donde tornavo? dall'altro mondo! che avevo fatto? il morto! Presi il partito di non rimuovermi da queste due risposte e lasciar tutti stizziti nell'orgasmo della curiosità, che durò parecchi e parecchi giorni. Né più fortunato degli altri fu l'amico Lodoletta che venne a «intervistarmi» per il Foglietto. Invano, per commuovermi, per tirarmi a parlare mi portò una copia del suo giornale di due anni avanti, con la mia necrologia. Gli dissi che la sapevo a memoria, perché all'Inferno il Foglietto era molto diffuso.","But now, out of spite, I do not want to describe what followed first at the pharmacy in Brìsigo, then at the Café Unione, when Don Eligio, still all exultant, introduced me to my revival. The news spread in a flash, and everyone rushed to see me and bombarded me with questions. They wanted to know from me who the drowning man at the Stia was then, as if they had not recognized me: all, one by one. And so it was me, just me: whence was I returning? from the other world! what had I done? the dead! I took the initiative not to remove myself from these two answers and to leave everyone angry in the orgasm of curiosity, which lasted several and several days. Nor was my friend Lodoletta luckier than the others, who came to ""interview me"" for the Foglietto. In vain, to move me, to get me to speak, he brought me a copy of his two-year-old newspaper, with my obituary. I told him I knew it by heart, because the Foglietto was very popular in Hell.","However, now, out of pique, I will not describe what followed, at the Brisigo pharmacy first, then at the Union Café, where don Eligio, still exultant, announced me as returned to life.

They all wanted me to tell them who then was the man who drowned at La Stia, as if they had not all identified me themselves, one by one. So it was me, it really was me. Where had I come from? The other world! What had I been doing? Playing dead! I decided not to shift from these two replies and left them all in a fever of curiosity which lasted several days. My friend Skylark was no more fortunate than the others when he came to ‘interview’ me for his paper. In vain, trying to move me, make me speak, he brought me a copy of the paper from two years ago, with my obituary. I told him I knew it off by heart because The Herald had a very high circulation in hell.","But, out of pique now, I won't describe what followed, first at Brisigo's pharmacy, then at the Caffè dell'Unione when Don Eligio, still exultant, presented me, back from the dead.

What was I to do with it?","But then, at one point, my gaze lighted on the little wedding band that encircled the ring finger of my left hand. This gave me a violent shock.

"E che seguiva da questa riflessione? Ahimè, che io, condannato inevitabilmente a mentire dalla mia condizione, non avrei potuto avere mai più un amico, un vero amico.

I could only have superficial relationships and allow myself to exchange occasionally a few, brief, distant words with other people of my ilk.","And what was the logical conclusion of this line of thought? Alas, that since my situation inevitably sentenced me to lie, I could never have another friend, a real friend. No house then, and no friends . . .

"- C'è logica? - mi domandò egli un giorno, dopo avermi letto un passo di un libro del Finot, pieno d'una filosofia così sentimentalmente macabra, che pareva il sogno d'un becchino morfinomane, su la vita nientemeno dei vermi nati dalla decomposizione del corpo umano. - C'è logica? Materia, sì materia: ammettiamo che tutto sia materia. Ma c'è forma e forma, modo e modo, qualità e qualità: c'è il sasso e l'etere imponderabile, perdio! Nel mio stesso corpo, c'è l'unghia, il dente, il pelo, e c'è perbacco il finissimo tessuto oculare. Ora, sissignore, chi vi dice di no? quella che chiamiamo anima sarà materia anch'essa; ma vorrete ammettermi che non sarà materia come l'unghia, come il dente, come il pelo: sarà materia come l'etere, o che so io. L'etere, sì, l'ammettete come ipotesi, e l'anima no? C'è logica? Materia, sissignore. Segua il mio ragionamento, e veda un po' dove arrivo, concedendo tutto. Veniamo alla Natura. Noi consideriamo adesso l'uomo come l'erede di una serie innumerevole di generazioni, è vero? come il prodotto di una elaborazione ben lenta della Natura. Lei, caro signor Meis, ritiene che sia una bestia anch'esso, crudelissima bestia e, nel suo insieme, ben poco pregevole? Concedo anche questo, e dico: sta bene, l'uomo rappresenta nella scala degli esseri un gradino non molto elevato; dal verme all'uomo poniamo otto, poniamo sette, poniamo cinque gradini. Ma, perdiana!, la Natura ha faticato migliaja, migliaja e migliaja di secoli per salire questi cinque gradini, dal verme all'uomo; s'è dovuta evolvere, è vero? questa materia per raggiungere come forma e come sostanza questo quinto gradino, per diventare questa bestia che ruba, questa bestia che uccide, questa bestia bugiarda, ma che pure è capace di scrivere la Divina Commedia, signor Meis, e di sacrificarsi come ha fatto sua madre e mia madre; e tutt'a un tratto, pàffete, torna zero? C'è logica? Ma diventerà verme il mio naso, il mio piede, non l'anima mia, per bacco! materia anch'essa, sissignore, chi vi dice di no? ma non come il mio naso o come il mio piede. C'è logica?","- Is there logic? he asked me one day, after reading me a passage from a book of Finot, full of a philosophy so sentimentally macabre, that it seemed the dream of a morphine addict, about the life of none other than the worms born from the decomposition of the human body. - Is there logic? Matter, yes matter: let's admit that everything is matter. But there is form and form, way and way, quality and quality: there is the stone and the imponderable ether, by God! In my own body, there is the nail, the tooth, the hair, and, by God, the very fine ocular tissue. Now, yes sir, who tells you no? what we call soul will also be matter; but you will want to admit that it will not be matter like the nail, like the tooth, like the hair: it will be matter like the ether, or whatever. The ether, yes, you admit it as a hypothesis, and the soul no? Is there logic? Matter, yes sir. Follow my reasoning, and see a little bit where I arrive, conceding everything. We come to Nature. We now regard man as the heir to an innumerable series of generations, is that true? as the product of a very slow elaboration of Nature. Do you, dear Mr. Meis, think that this too is a beast, a very cruel beast and, on the whole, very little valuable? I also concede this, and I say: he is well, man represents a not very high step in the scale of beings; from worm to man let us set eight, let us set seven, let us set five steps. But, by God! Nature has labored thousands, thousands and thousands of centuries to climb these five steps, from worm to man; has had to evolve, is it true? this material to reach this fifth step as form and substance, to become this beast that steals, this beast that kills, this lying beast, but which is also capable of writing the Divine Comedy, Mr. Meis, and of sacrificing himself as he did his mother and my mother; and all of a sudden, pàffete, back to zero? Is there logic? But my nose will become a worm, my foot, not my soul, for goodness sake! matter too, yes sir, who tells you no? but not like my nose or like my foot. Is there logic?","“Is there any logic in this?” he asked me one day, having read me a passage from a book by Finot, full of such a macabre yet sentimental philosophy that it read like the morphine-induced dream of an undertaker, on the life, no less, of the maggots born from the decomposition of human flesh. “Is there any logic in it? All right, matter exists, yes : let’s say that everything’s matter, but there are various forms, modes and qualities. There’s rock and the imponderable ether, for heaven’s sake. In my body alone, there are nails, teeth, hair and even the superlatively fine tissues of the eye. Now, who’s to say that what we call the soul isn’t matter too? You will agree, it can’t be matter like the nails, teeth or hair, it’ll be matter like ether or something. Let’s suppose that the soul is like ether, right? Is there any logic in what he says? Matter. Follow my reasoning and see where it leads me, taking everything into account. We have to arrive at Nature. Nowadays, we consider man to be the product of an incalculable series of generations, don’t we? the result of a very slow process of development on the part of Nature. Do you, my dear Signor Meis, agree that man is still a beast, a very cruel beast, and all in all, rather unworthy? Of course you do. I would concede this, and say: all right, man represents a not particularly high point on the scale of beings; between maggot and man, let’s say there are what, eight, seven, five stages? But Lord! Nature struggled for thousands and thousands of centuries to climb those five steps from maggot to man. There had to be a process of evolution, didn’t there, for this matter to get to the fifth stage, in terms of form and substance, to become the creature that steals, kills, lies and yet is capable of creating The Divine Comedy, Signor Meis, or of supreme self- sacrifice, like your mother and my mother; and then, suddenly, wham! back to zero? Is that supposed to be logical? My nose, my foot will become maggot again, I can believe that, but not my soul, by heavens. It’s made of matter, yes, but not the same as my nose or my foot. Now where would be the logic in that?”","""Is it logical or isn't it?"" he asked me one day, after reading aloud a passage from a book by Finot, filled with a philosophy so sentimentally macabre that it was like the dream of a drug-addicted gravedigger; it concerned, of all things, the life of the worms born from the decay of the human body. ""Is it logical, or isn't it? Matter, yes, let's admit that everything is matter. But there are all sorts of forms, types, qualities. There is stone and there is the intangible air, for heaven's sake! In my body alone, there is the fingernail, the tooth, the hair; there's even the delicate eye tissue, after all. Now, my dear sir, who can contradict that? But what we call the soul may also be matter. You'll agree, I hope, that it isn't matter like the fingernail or the tooth or the hair; it may be matter like air, or what have you. You admit the existence of air, don't you? Well, why not the soul then? Is this logical or isn't it? Matter, matter, my dear sir. Follow my line of reasoning, and just see where it leads you if you admit my premises. Let's take Nature. We now consider man as the heir of a countless series of generations, don't we? The product of a slow natural process. But you, my dear Signor Meis, believe that man is also an animal, a cruel animal and, all things considered, a far from praiseworthy one. I concede this. But then I say: all right, man—in the scale of living creatures—doesn't represent a very high stage. From the worms to the human being let's say there are eight—no, seven—no, five steps. But, good heavens! Nature has toiled thousands and thousands and thousands of centuries to climb up those five steps, from the worm to man; Nature has had to evolve—am I right?—this matter to reach the form and the substance of that fifth step, to create this animal that steals and kills and lies, but is also capable of writing the Divine Comedy or of making sacrifices, Signor Meis, as my mother and your mother did. Does it then, all of a sudden, return to zero? Is that logical? My nose, my foot may become worms, but my soul, mind you, even though it's also matter— who's saying it isn't?—my soul isn't the same as my nose or my foot. Isn't that logical?''"

"Mi ritirai in camera. Il mio pensiero corse subito ad Adriana, che se n'era scappata singhiozzando, dopo quella mia smentita. E se ora fosse venuta a domandarmi una spiegazione? Certo non poteva credere neanche lei, ch'io avessi davvero ritrovato il denaro. Che doveva ella dunque supporre? Ch'io, negando a quel modo il furto, avevo voluto punirla del mancato giuramento. Ma perché? Evidentemente perché dall'avvocato, a cui le avevo detto di voler ricorrere per consiglio prima di denunziare il furto, avevo saputo che anche lei e tutti di casa sarebbero stati chiamati responsabili di esso. Ebbene, e non mi aveva ella detto che volentieri avrebbe affrontato lo scandalo? Sì: ma io - era chiaro - io non avevo voluto: avevo preferito di sacrificar così dodici mila lire… E dunque, doveva ella credere che fosse generosità da parte mia, sacrifizio per amor di lei? Ecco a quale altra menzogna mi costringeva la mia condizione: stomachevole menzogna, che mi faceva bello di una squisita, delicatissima prova d'amore, attribuendomi una generosità tanto più grande, quanto meno da lei richiesta e desiderata.","I retired to my room. My thoughts immediately went to Adriana, who had run away sobbing, after my denial. What if now she came to ask me for an explanation? Certainly she couldn't believe that I had really found the money again. What, then, was she supposed to suppose? That I, in denying the theft in that way, had wanted to punish her for not taking an oath. But why? Obviously because from the lawyer, to whom I had told her I wanted to seek advice before reporting the theft, I had learned that she and everyone in the house would also be called responsible for it. Well, hadn't she told me that she would gladly face the scandal? Yes: but I - it was clear - I had not wanted to: I had preferred to sacrifice twelve thousand lire in this way ... And then, should she have believed that it was generosity on my part, a sacrifice for her love? Here is what other lie my condition forced me to: disgusting lie, which made me beautiful with an exquisite, most delicate proof of love, attributing to me a generosity all the greater, the less requested and desired by her.","I went back to my room. My thoughts flew instantly to Adriana, who had run off sobbing after my denial of the theft. What if she came and asked for an explanation? Of course, she could not possibly believe that I really had found the money. What must she think then? Perhaps that I wanted to punish her lack of faith? Why? Clearly, it would have to be because the lawyer, whom I told her I would consult before reporting the theft, had told me that she and the whole household would be under suspicion. But had she not told me herself that she would have gladly faced up to the scandal? Yes, but I — obviously— preferred not, I was prepared rather to sacrifice twelve thousand lire. So, was she supposed to believe that it was all generosity on my part, a sacrifice for love of her? Here was another fine fabrication my situation obliged me to create: an attractive fabrication, which credited me with an exquisite, most delicate proof of love, and a generosity all the more impressive since unsolicited and unwanted by her.","I retired to my room. My thoughts flew at once to Adriana, who had run off sobbing, after I had contradicted her like that. What if she came to me now for an explanation? Naturally she couldn't believe I had really found the money. What would she imagine then? That, in denying the theft, I had meant to punish her for failing to keep her oath. But why? Obviously because the lawyer, whom I told her I was going to consult before reporting the theft, had warned me that she and everyone else in the house would be held responsible. Yes, but hadn't she told me herself that she would willingly face a scandal? True, but I didn't want that, of course; I had preferred to sacrifice my twelve thousand lire . . .

Goodbye, huh! Good luck! I said, greeting, with my eyes fixed on Romilda, who did not want to look at me. But her hand trembled as she greeted me back. - Goodbye! Goodbye!","“That’s that then.

"Intanto le angustie crescevano; e io non trovavo da porvi riparo. Furon venduti gli ori della mamma, cari ricordi. La vedova Pescatore, temendo che io e mia madre fra poco dovessimo anche vivere sulla sua rendituccia dotale di quarantadue lire mensili, diventava di giorno in giorno più cupa e di più fosche maniere. Prevedevo da un momento all'altro un prorompimento del suo furore, contenuto ormai da troppo tempo, forse per la presenza e per il contegno della mamma. Nel vedermi aggirar per casa come una mosca senza capo, quella bufera di femmina mi lanciava certe occhiatacce, lampi forieri di tempesta. Uscivo per levar la corrente e impedire la scarica. Ma poi temevo per la mamma, e rincasavo.","Meanwhile the anguish increased; and I could not find shelter there. Mother's gold was sold, dear memories. The widow Pescatore, fearing that my mother and I would soon also have to live on her dowry annuity of forty-two lire a month, became more somber and more somber manners day by day. At any moment I expected an outbreak of his fury, contained for too long now, perhaps due to the presence and demeanor of his mother. Seeing me wandering around the house like a headless fly, that female storm threw me certain dirty looks, lightning heralds of a storm. I went out to turn off the current and prevent the discharge. But then I was afraid for Mom, and I went home.","Meanwhile, we became poorer and poorer, and I was unable to do anything about it. My mother’s gold, of great sentimental value, had to be sold. The widow Pescatore, fearing that my mother and I might shortly have to live on the tiny income from Romilda’s dowry, became gloomier and more unpleasant as the days went by. I expected at any moment an outbreak of the fury that, perhaps out of respect for my mother, had been contained for too long. Seeing me drifting aimlessly about the house, she tossed me hostile glances, stormy portents of the impending tempest. I would go out, to try to cut off the current and prevent the charge earthing; but then I would fear for my mother and come back home.","Meanwhile our hardships were increasing, and I couldn't find any solution to them. Mamma's jewelry, precious keepsakes, were sold. Afraid that my mother and I would soon be forced to live on her dowry interest of forty-two lire per month, the widow Pescatore became grimmer and nastier every day. I could tell that her fury might break out at any moment; it had now been repressed for too long, perhaps because of Mamma's presence and manner. As that tempest of a woman saw me darting around the house like a fly without a head, she hurled looks at me that were flashes of lightning, announcing the coming storm. I would leave the house for a while to remove the electricity and prevent the explosion, but then I would begin to fear for Mamma and I would go home again."
"Si sa che certe specie di pazzia sono contagiose. Quella del Paleari, per quanto in prima mi ribellassi, alla fine mi s'attaccò. Non che credessi veramente di esser morto: non sarebbe stato un gran male, giacché il forte è morire, e, appena morti, non credo che si possa avere il tristo desiderio di ritornare in vita. Mi accorsi tutt'a un tratto che dovevo proprio morire ancora: ecco il male! Chi se ne ricordava più? Dopo il mio suicidio alla Stìa, io naturalmente non avevo veduto più altro, innanzi a me, che la vita.

All of a sudden I realized that I really had to die again: that's the evil! Who remembered it anymore? After my suicide at La Stia, I naturally had seen nothing more before me than life. And here it is, now: Signor Anselmo Paleari continually put the shadow of death before me.","Certain kinds of madness are catching. Paleari’s brand eventually got through to me, however strenuously I rebelled at first. Not that I really believed I was dead, that would be no great evil, given that the problem is dying, and once dead, I doubt if we have any melancholy desire to return to this life. No, I realised all of a sudden that I would still one day have to die and I had forgotten this. After my suicide at La Stia, I had imagined nothing else before me but eternal life. Now, here was Anselmo Paleari, constantly presenting me with the shadow of death.","It's well known that certain kinds of madness are contagious. Paleari's, though I rebelled against it at first, ended up by infecting me.

No, I suddenly realized that I would have to die again: that was the trouble! I'd completely forgotten. After my suicide in the millrace, I naturally had seen nothing but life ahead of me.

"Avevo veduto l'una e l'altra nella semioscurità della mia camera: ora, alla luce, la signorina Pantogada mi parve un'altra; non in tutto veramente, ma nel naso… Possibile che avesse quel naso in casa mia? Me l'ero figurata con un nasetto all'insù, ardito, e invece aquilino lo aveva, e robusto. Ma era pur bella così: bruna, sfavillante negli occhi, coi capelli lucidi, nerissimi e ondulati; le labbra fine taglienti, accese. L'abito scuro, punteggiato di bianco, le stava dipinto sul corpo svelto e formoso. La mite bellezza bionda d'Adriana, accanto a lei, impallidiva.","I had seen both in the semi-darkness of my room: now, in the light, Miss Pantogada seemed to me another; not in everything really, but in the nose ...

But she was still so beautiful: brunette, sparkling in the eyes, with shiny, very black and wavy hair; her lips sharp, lit up. The dark dress, dotted with white, was painted on her sleek, curvy body. Adriana's mild blonde beauty, next to her, was turning pale.","I had seen both of them in the semidarkness of my room. Now, in daylight, Pepita looked quite different; not in all her features really, but her nose was certainly different. Could she really have had that nose in my room? I had imagined she had a small, turned-up nose , instead she had a bold, aquiline, substantial one. She was still beautiful however: dark, with flashing eyes, glossy, black, wavy hair, fine, chiselled, ardent hps. Her dress, dark with white spots, looked as if it had been painted onto her slim, shapely body. Adriana’s mild, fairhaired beauty paled in comparison.","I had seen both of them only in the semidarkness of my room.

"Ma volendo parlare così astrattamente come codesti critici fanno, non è forse vero che mai l'uomo tanto appassionatamente ragiona (o sragiona, che è lo stesso), come quando soffre, perché appunto delle sue sofferenze vuol veder la radice, e chi gliele ha date, e se e quanto sia stato giusto il dargliele; mentre, quando gode, si piglia il godimento e non ragiona, come se il godere fosse suo diritto?","But wanting to speak as abstractly as these critics do, it is perhaps not true that man never thinks so passionately (or sragiona, which is the same), as when he suffers, because precisely he wants to see the root of his sufferings, and who give, and if and how right it was to give them; while, when he enjoys, he takes jouissance and does not reason, as if jouissance were his right?","But, if we are going to discuss this in such abstract terms, as these critics like to do, could it not be said that man never reasons so closely (or so badly, which is often the same thing) as when he is suffering, since he tries to locate the source of his suffering, what has caused it and whether and to what extent he can be said to have deserved it. On the other hand, when he is enjoying life, he seizes his pleasure and does not think about it, as if pleasure is his right.","Still, to speak abstractly like these critics, isn't it perhaps true that man never reasons so passionately (or so wrongly— not that that changes anything) as when he is suffering? He wants to arrive at the root of his sufferings, he wants to discover who causes them, and whether they are deserved. But when man is happy, doesn't he accept his happiness without reasoning about it, as if it were his right?"
"Ogni oggetto in noi suol trasformarsi secondo le immagini ch'esso evoca e aggruppa, per cosi dire, attorno a sé. Certo un oggetto può piacere anche per se stesso, per la diversità delle sensazioni gradevoli che ci suscita in una percezione armoniosa; ma ben più spesso il piacere che un oggetto ci procura non si trova nell'oggetto per se medesimo. La fantasia lo abbellisce cingendolo e quasi irraggiandolo d'immagini care. Né noi lo percepiamo più qual esso è, ma così, quasi animato dalle immagini che suscita in noi o che le nostre abitudini vi associano. Nell'oggetto, insomma, noi amiamo quel che vi mettiamo di noi, l'accordo, l'armonia che stabiliamo tra esso e noi, l'anima che esso acquista per noi soltanto e che è formata dai nostri ricordi.","Every object in us can transform itself according to the images it evokes and groups, so to speak, around itself. Of course, an object can also please itself, due to the diversity of pleasant sensations it arouses in a harmonious perception; but far more often the pleasure that an object gives us is not found in the object itself. Fantasy embellishes it by encircling it and almost radiating it with cherished images. Nor do we perceive it any longer as it is, but so, almost animated by the images it arouses in us or that our habits associate with it. In short, we love what we put into the object, the agreement, the harmony that we establish between it and us, the soul that it acquires for us alone and which is formed by our memories.","All objects are transformed in our minds by the images that they evoke. Of course, an object might be attractive in itself, through the sheer harmony of its lines; but far more often, the pleasure we gain from an object is nothing to do with its intrinsic qualities. Fantasy embellishes it, surrounding it, almost infusing it with fond associations. We can no longer see it as it is, but only imbued with the atmosphere we imagine, or are used to associating with it. In short, we love what we have put into the object ourselves, an accord, a sense of harmony which we establish between it and ourselves, the soul which it acquires for us alone and which is shaped by our memories.","Every object is transformed within us according to the images it evokes, the sensations that cluster around it. To be sure, an object may please us for itself alone, for the pleasant feelings that a harmonious sight inspires in us; but far more often the pleasure that an object affords us does not derive from the object in itself. Our fantasy embellishes it, surrounding it, making it resplendent with images dear to us. Then we no longer see it for what it is, but animated by the images it arouses in us or by the things we associate with it. In short, what we love about the object is what we put in it of ourselves, the harmony established between it and us, the soul that it acquires only through us, a soul composed of our memories."

"Seguitai ancora per qualche tempo a viaggiare. Volli spingermi oltre l'Italia; visitai le belle contrade del Reno, fino a Colonia, seguendo il fiume a bordo d'un piroscafo; mi trattenni nelle città principali: a Mannheim, a Worms, a Magonza, a Bingen, a Coblenza… Avrei voluto andar più sù di Colonia, più sù della Germania, almeno in Norvegia; ma poi pensai che io dovevo imporre un certo freno alla mia libertà. Il denaro che avevo meco doveva servirmi per tutta la vita, e non era molto. Avrei potuto vivere ancora una trentina d'anni; e così fuori d'ogni legge, senza alcun documento tra le mani che comprovasse, non dico altro, la mia esistenza reale, ero nell'impossibilità di procacciarmi un qualche impiego; se non volevo dunque ridurmi a mal partito, bisognava che mi restringessi a vivere con poco. Fatti i conti, non avrei dovuto spendere più di duecento lire al mese: pochine; ma già per ben due anni avevo anche vissuto con meno, e non io solo. Mi sarei dunque adattato.","I continued to travel for some time. I wanted to push myself beyond Italy; I visited the beautiful districts of the Rhine, as far as Cologne, following the river aboard a steamer; I stayed in the main cities: Mannheim, Worms, Mainz, Bingen, Koblenz… I would have liked to go higher than Cologne, higher than Germany, at least in Norway; but then I thought that I had to impose a certain restraint on my freedom. The money I had with me was to be of use to me all my life, and it wasn't much. I could have lived another thirty years; and so out of any law, without any document in my hands that would prove, I do not say anything else, my real existence, I was unable to find any employment; if I did not want to reduce myself to a bad start, I had to restrict myself to living with little. After all, I shouldn't have spent more than two hundred lire a month: a few; but for two years I had also lived with less, and not just me. I would therefore have adapted.","I continued on my travels for a while. I decided to venture beyond Italy. I visited the lovely Rhinelands, right up as far as Cologne, following the course of the river in a steamship. I stopped off in the major cities: Mannheim, Worms, Mainz, Bingen, Koblenz. I would have liked to have gone further north, beyond Cologne and beyond Germany, at least as far as Norway, but then I realised that I ought to impose some restraints on my freedom. The money I possessed had to last me for the rest of my life and it was not all that much. I might go on for another thirty years and, outside the law as I was, without any document to confirm my existence (for want of a better term), it would be impossible for me to seek any kind of work. So, if I was to avoid ending up in that sorry plight, I had to restrict myself to living on a limited amount. I made a few calculations and worked out that I should not spend more than two hundred lire a month: it was not much, but I had lived on a great deal less than that for a good two years and then I had others besides myself to support. I was therefore prepared to adapt myself accordingly.","For some time I went on traveling.

I would have liked to go farther north than Cologne, beyond Germany, to Norway; but then I decided that I had to limit my freedom. My money had to last the rest of my life, and it wasn't a large sum. I might live for another thirty years and always in this same situation, outside laws, with no documents to prove, in the first place, my actual existence. So it was impossible for me to find any kind of employment. And if I didn't want to get myself into a mess, I would have to live on a small, fixed amount.

C'era poi, davanti al divanuccio sgangherato, un tavolinetto con le quattro zampe dorate e il piano di porcellana dipinto di vivacissimi colori; poi uno stipetto a muro, di lacca giapponese, ecc., ecc., e su questi oggetti nuovi gli occhi di Malagna si fermavano con evidente compiacenza, come già su la rosoliera recata in trionfo dalla cugina vedova Pescatore.","The house was modest; but already among the old furniture several newcomers could be noticed, pretentious and clumsy in the ostentation of their too flashy novelty: two large majolica lamps, for example, still intact, with frosted glass globes, of strange shape, on a very humble shelf with a yellowed marble top, holding a gloomy mirror in a round frame, peeling here and there, which seemed to open into the room like a hungry yawn.

The revolver was near this hand; further on, the hat. At first it seemed to me that the ball had come out of his left eye, whence so much blood, now congealed, had poured onto his face.

A dozen wasps buzzed around it; some even came to rest there, voracious, on the eye. Among the many who watched, no one had thought of chasing them away.

Ma che logica era questa? delle due l'una: o io avevo patito il furto, e allora per qual ragione, conoscendo il ladro, non lo denunziavo, e ritraevo invece da lei il mio amore, come se anch'ella ne fosse colpevole? o io avevo realmente ritrovato il denaro, e allora perché non seguitavo ad amarla?","But no! But no! But no! What was I fantasizing about? I had to arrive at quite other conclusions, following the logic of my necessary and inevitable lie. What generosity! what a sacrifice! what proof of love! Could I perhaps have flattered that poor girl further? I had to suffocate it, suffocate it, my passion; do not turn a glance or a word of love to Adriana anymore. So? How could she have reconciled my apparent generosity with the attitude that from now on I had to impose myself in front of her. I was therefore forced to take advantage of that theft which she had revealed against my will and which I had denied, in order to sever all relations with her. But what was this logic? one of two: or I had suffered the theft, and then for what reason, knowing the thief, did I not report him, and instead portrayed my love from her, as if she too were guilty? or I had really found the money, so why didn't I continue to love her?","No, no no! What was I thinking of? I had to find some other solution whilst following the logic of my necessary and inevitable deceit. No talk of generosity, sacrifices, proof of love: I could not lead the poor child 011 any further. I had to stifle my passion and direct neither a glance nor a word of love at Adriana ever again. So, how was she to reconcile my apparent generosity with the restraint I was now going to be obliged to display towards her? I was going to be forced to exploit the fact that she had revealed the theft against my wishes and that I had denied it, and use all this to break off relations with her. But there was no logic in this since only one of the following could be true: either I had been robbed, in which case, as I knew who was the thief, why did I not denounce him, but instead withdrew my love from her as if she were guilty too? Or else, if I really had found the money, why did I not continue to love her?","Ah, but no! No! What was I dreaming of? Following the logic of that obligatory, inevitable lie of mine, she would come to quite different conclusions! Generosity indeed! Sacrifice? Proof of love? Ha! Could I continue to deceive that poor girl? No, I had to stifle my passion, never address another glance at Adriana or a single word of love. Then what? How could she reconcile my presumed generosity with the way I was forced to behave towards her from now on? I was therefore obliged to exploit the theft that, against my wish, she had revealed and I had denied. I would use it to break off all relations with her. But where was the logic in this? I had either been robbed or I hadn’t; and if I knew the thief, then why didn’t I denounce him? Why instead did I stop loving her, as if she were the guilty one? Or if I had really found the money, why shouldn’t my love for her continue?"
"A un tratto, la vista mi s'annebbiò, sembrandomi di scorgere nel rigo seguente il nome del mio podere; e, siccome stentavo a leggere, con un occhio solo, quella stampa minuscola, m'alzai in piedi, per essere più vicino al lume.","Suddenly, my vision clouded over, as I seemed to see the name of my farm in the next line; and, as I found it hard to read, with only one eye, that tiny print, I stood up to be closer to the lamp.","Suddenly my eyes began to play tricks on me, for I imagined I glimpsed the name of my own holding in the following line; and since it was difficult for me to read such tiny print with one eye only, I got up and moved closer to the lamp.","Suddenly my eyes clouded over, as I thought I glimpsed in the next line the name of my farm.

"Recisa di netto ogni memoria in me della vita precedente, fermato l'animo alla deliberazione di ricominciare da quel punto una nuova vita, io era invaso e sollevato come da una fresca letizia infantile; mi sentivo come rifatta vergine e trasparente la coscienza, e lo spirito vigile e pronto a trar profitto di tutto per la costruzione del mio nuovo io. Intanto l'anima mi tumultuava nella gioja di quella nuova libertà. Non avevo mai veduto così uomini e cose; l'aria tra essi e me s'era d'un tratto quasi snebbiata; e mi si presentavan facili e lievi le nuove relazioni che dovevano stabilirsi tra noi, poiché ben poco ormai io avrei avuto bisogno di chieder loro per il mio intimo compiacimento. Oh levità deliziosa dell'anima; serena, ineffabile ebbrezza! La Fortuna mi aveva sciolto di ogni intrico, all'improvviso, mi aveva sceverato dalla vita comune, reso spettatore estraneo della briga in cui gli altri si dibattevano ancora, e mi ammoniva dentro:","Having neatly cut off every memory in me of the previous life, my soul stopped to decide to start a new life from that point, I was invaded and relieved as by a fresh infantile joy; I felt my conscience as a virgin and transparent again, and my spirit alert and ready to take advantage of everything for the construction of my new self. Meanwhile my soul was tumultuous in the joy of that new freedom. I had never seen men and things like this; the air between them and me was suddenly almost clear; and the new relations which were to be established between us presented themselves to me easily and lightly, since very little by now I would have needed to ask them for my inner pleasure. O delightful lightness of the soul; serene, ineffable intoxication! Fortune had suddenly loosened me of all entanglements, had suddenly separated me from ordinary life, made a stranger spectator of the trouble in which others were still struggling, and admonished me inside:","Having cut my self off cleanly from any memory of my previous life, and restricting my thoughts to the consideration of starting a new life from that point, it was as it I were invaded and uplifted by a fresh, childlike sense of good cheer. I felt my conscience was transparent and clean and my spirit watchful, ready to make good use of anything in the construction of my new me. Meanwhile, my soul rejoiced in the pleasure of my new freedom. I had never viewed people or objects in quite this way: a veil had been removed from between us; suddenly, new relationships seemed easy and lighthearted, since now, of necessity I would demand very little from them for my inner satisfaction. I was deliciously lightheaded, serene, but somehow intoxicated. Fate had released me from all entanglements, had suddenly cut me off from ordinary life, made me a spectator of the intrigues amid which other people still struggled, and warned me in my heart:","Now that I had cut off any memory of my previous existence, now that my spirit was firmly determined to begin a new life from this point, I was filled and uplifted by a fresh, infantile happiness. My consciousness seemed to have become virgin, transparent again, and my spirit was alert, ready to use everything to the best advantage in the construction of my new self. At the same time my soul was running riot, in the joy of this new freedom. I had never looked at mankind or at the world in this way; the air between them and me seemed suddenly free of mist; and the new relations that had to be established between us now seemed easy, light, since I now had to ask little of them to achieve my personal satisfaction. Oh, that delicious lightheartedness! Serene, indescribable bliss! Fortune had suddenly cut me free from all tangles, had severed me from ordinary life, had turned me into a bystander, looking on at the struggles of the others, and warned me secretly:"

"Che fossero però le quattro e meccio non aveva certamente dovuto farle piacere: lo argomentai da quel «Bene! bene!» a denti stretti e dal volubile e quasi aggressivo discorso in cui subito dopo si lanciò contro l'Italia e più contro Roma così gonfia di sé per il suo passato.

Certainly that wretch did not deserve much respect for the disorder of her life, but not even to be treated like that by a man who had neither kinship nor affinity with her.","I had not yet clarified what exactly I had been about to discover that evening, hidden behind the shutters. It would appear that the bad impression Papiano had gained of me through what he heard from Miss Caporale had been instantly erased when he met me. He tormented me, true, but as if he could not help it, not with any apparent intention to make me leave; indeed, it was quite the opposite. What was he planning? Adriana had become sad and bashful since his return, just as she had “been when I first came to the house. Signorina Silvia Caporale was very formal with Papiano, at least when other people were about, but that braggart was openly familiar with her; he even nicknamed her ‘Rea Silvia’ and I did not know how to interpret his shows of buffoonery and intimacy. Certainly, the wretched woman did not merit much respect for the mess she had made of her life, but nor did she deserve to be treated like that by a man who was neither related to her nor connected with her in any way.","The plotting I had overheard that evening from behind my blinds had never become any clearer to me. It was as if Pa-piano's bad first impression, based on information received about me from Signorina Caporale, had been erased the moment I was introduced to him. He was tormenting me, of course, but he seemed to do it automatically. He certainly had no secret plan to make me go away. On the contrary! What was afoot then? Adriana, after his return, had become sad and elusive as in the early days. Signorina Silvia Caporale no longer called Papiano tu in the presence of others; but he, with his swaggering manner, addressed her in the familiar form quite openly. He even went so far as to call her Rhea Silvia; I couldn’t really interpret these joking ways of his, these liberties. True enough, the poor woman’s disorderly life didn’t entitle her to any great respect, but neither did she deserve to be treated like that by a man who was not related to her in any way."
"Poco dopo, rientrando nella sala da giuoco, la vidi che conversava con un signore bassotto, bruno, barbuto, con gli occhi un po' loschi, spagnuolo all'aspetto.

E allora, verosimili, non sono più assurdità.","The absurdities of life do not need to be credible, because they are true. Contrary to those of art which, in order to be true, need to be plausible. And then, likely, they are no longer nonsense.","This is because life, with all its brazen absurdities, small and large, has the invaluable privilege of being able to do without this ridiculous realism that art seems duty-bound to adhere to. Any real event can be absurd; a work of art, if it is a work of art, cannot.","Life’s absurdities don’t have to seem believable, because they are real As opposed to art’s absurdities which, to seem real, have to be believable.

"E questo sentimento della vita per il signor Anselmo era appunto come un lanternino che ciascuno di noi porta in sé acceso; un lanternino che ci fa vedere sperduti su la terra, e ci fa vedere il male e il bene; un lanternino che projetta tutt'intorno a noi un cerchio più o meno ampio di luce, di là dal quale è l'ombra nera, l'ombra paurosa che non esisterebbe, se il lanternino non fosse acceso in noi, ma che noi dobbiamo pur troppo creder vera, fintanto ch'esso si mantiene vivo in noi. Spento alla fine a un soffio, ci accoglierà la notte perpetua dopo il giorno fumoso della nostra illusione, o non rimarremo noi piuttosto alla mercé dell'Essere, che avrà soltanto rotto le vane forme della nostra ragione?","And this feeling of life for Signor Anselmo was precisely like a lantern that each of us carries on in him; a lantern that makes us see lost on the earth, and makes us see evil and good; a lantern that projects a more or less wide circle of light all around us, beyond which is the black shadow, the fearful shadow that would not exist, if the lantern were not lit in us, but which we must also too much to believe true, as long as it is kept alive in us. Finally extinguished by a breath, will the perpetual night welcome us after the smoky day of our illusion, or will we not rather remain at the mercy of the Being, who will have only broken the vain forms of our reason?","This feeling about life, for Signor Anselmo, was exactly like a lantern which makes us see ourselves scattered over the earth, and makes us perceive good and evil; a lantern which projects all around us a more or less extensive circle of light, beyond which lies the blank shadow, a fearful shadow, which would not exist if the lantern was not lit in us, but which we must unfortunately believe to be real, as long as the lantern is alight within us.

"Circa vent'anni addietro, il marchese Giglio d'Auletta, di cui Papiano era il segretario, aveva sposato l'unica sua figliuola a don Antonio Pantogada, addetto all'Ambasciata di Spagna presso la Santa Sede. Poco dopo il matrimonio, il Pantogada, scoperto una notte dalla polizia in una bisca insieme con altri dell'aristocrazia romana, era stato richiamato a Madrid. Là aveva fatto il resto, e forse qualcos'altro di peggio, per cui era stato costretto a lasciar la diplomazia. D'allora in poi, il marchese d'Auletta non aveva avuto più pace, forzato continuamente a mandar danaro per pagare i debiti di giuoco del genero incorreggibile. Quattr'anni fa, la moglie del Pantogada era morta, lasciando una giovinetta di circa sedici anni, che il marchese aveva voluto prendere con sé, conoscendo pur troppo in quali mani altrimenti sarebbe rimasta. Il Pantogada non avrebbe voluto lasciarsela scappare; ma poi, costretto da una impellente necessità di denaro, aveva ceduto. Ora egli minacciava senza requie il suocero di riprendersi la figlia, e quel giorno appunto era venuto a Roma con questo intento, per scroccare cioè altro danaro al povero marchese, sapendo bene che questi non avrebbe mai e poi mai abbandonato nelle mani di lui la sua cara nipote Pepita.","About twenty years ago, the Marquis Giglio d'Auletta, of whom Papiano was the secretary, had married his only daughter to Don Antonio Pantogada, attached to the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See. Shortly after the wedding, the Pantogada, discovered one night by the police in a gambling den along with others of the Roman aristocracy, was recalled to Madrid. There he had done the rest, and perhaps something else worse, for which he had been forced to leave diplomacy. From then on, the Marquis d'Auletta had no more peace, constantly forced to send money to pay the gambling debts of his incorrigible son-in-law. Four years ago, Pantogada's wife had died, leaving behind a young girl of about sixteen, whom the Marquis had wanted to take with him, knowing too much in which hands she would otherwise have remained. The Pantogada would not have wanted to let it slip away; but then, forced by an urgent need for money, he gave in. Now he was relentlessly threatening his father-in-law to take back his daughter, and that day he had come to Rome with this intent, that is, to scrounge more money from the poor marquis, knowing full well that he would never, ever abandon his dear niece Pepita.","About twenty years earlier, the Marchese Giglio d’Auletta, whose secretary Papiano was, had married his only daughter to don Antonio Pantogada, who was attached to the Spanish Embassy near the Vatican.

"Certo egli se ne accorse fin dai primi giorni, o - per lo meno - me la intravide. Cominciò un assedio fitto fitto di cerimonie, ch'eran tutte uncini per tirarmi a parlare. Mi pareva che ogni sua parola, ogni sua domanda, fosse pur la più ovvia, nascondesse un'insidia. Non avrei voluto intanto mostrar diffidenza per non accrescere i suoi sospetti; ma l'irritazione ch'egli mi cagionava con quel suo tratto da vessatore servizievole m'impediva di dissimularla bene.","Certainly he noticed it from the first days, or - at least - he glimpsed it to me. A dense siege of ceremonies began, all of which were hooks to make me speak. It seemed to me that his every word, his every question, even the most obvious, hid a pitfall. In the meantime I would not have wanted to show distrust so as not to increase his suspicions; but the irritation he caused me by his trait of a helpful oppressor prevented me from disguising it well.","He certainly realised the existence of this right from the beginning, or rather perceived its signs in me.

"Berto mi rispose che non poteva; non poteva perché la sua condizione di fronte alla famiglia della moglie e alla moglie stessa era penosissima, dopo il nostro rovescio: egli viveva ormai su la dote della moglie, e non avrebbe dunque potuto imporre a questa anche il peso della suocera. Del resto, la mamma - diceva - si sarebbe forse trovata male allo stesso modo in casa sua, perché anche egli conviveva con la madre della moglie, buona donna, sì, ma che poteva diventar cattiva per le inevitabili gelosie e gli attriti che nascono tra suocere. Era dunque meglio che la mamma rimanesse a casa mia; se non altro, non si sarebbe così allontanata negli ultimi anni dal suo paese e non sarebbe stata costretta a cangiar vita e abitudini. Si dichiarava infine dolentissimo di non potere, per tutte le considerazioni esposte più sù, prestarmi un anche menomo soccorso pecuniario, come con tutto il cuore avrebbe voluto.","Berto replied that he could not; he could not because his condition vis-à-vis his wife's family and his wife herself was very painful, after our reverse: he was now living on his wife's dowry, and therefore could not have imposed on her the weight of his mother-in-law. After all, his mother - he said - would perhaps have found himself ill in the same way in his house, because he too lived with his wife's mother, a good woman, yes, but who could become bad because of the inevitable jealousies and frictions that arise between mother-in-law. It was therefore better for my mother to stay at my house; if nothing else, she would not have moved so far from her country in recent years and would not have been forced to change her life and habits. Finally, he declared himself very sad that he could not, for all the considerations set out above, lend me even the least financial aid, as he would have liked with all his heart.","Berto replied that he could not take her in: he could not because his situation with regard to his wife’s family and his wife herself was extremely delicate after our family’s decline. Now he was living on his wife’s dowry and so he could not burden her with his mother too. Besides, he said, she would probably be just as badly off in his house, because he too lived with his wife’s mother, a fine woman of course, but who might become unpleasant if provoked by the inevitable jealousies and friction that arise between mothers-in-law. It was therefore better that mother should stay with me, if nothing else, she would not be exiled from her village in her autumn years, or be obliged to change her habits and her way of life. Finally, he declared himself desolate at not being able, for all the reasons outlined above, to lend me even minimal financial support, as he would dearly have loved to have done.","Berto answered that he couldn't. He couldn't because his position with regard to his wife's family and even to his wife herself was very painful now, after our financial downfall. He was living on his wife's dowry and therefore couldn't also impose her mother-in-law on her. For that matter—he added —Mamma would perhaps have been in an equally awkward position in his home, because he too lived with his mother-in-law, an excellent woman, but one who might turn jealous in the inevitable friction between two rival mothers. So it was best for Mamma to stay at my house; there she would at least spend her last years in her own town and she wouldn't be forced to change her habits and her way of life. Berto also said how sorry he was that, for the reasons mentioned above, he couldn't offer me even a token financial assistance, though he would have liked to, with all his heart."

"Ma, con questa scoperta, nessun pensiero men che puro entrò in me per Adriana: quella sua candida bontà soffusa di mestizia non poteva ispirarne; provavo però tanta letizia di quella prima confidenza quale e quanta la delicata timidezza poteva consentirgliene. Era un fuggevole sguardo, come il lampo d una grazia dolcissima; era un sorriso di commiserazione per la ridicola lusinga di quella povera donna; era qualche benevolo richiamo ch'ella mi accennava con gli occhi e con un lieve movimento del capo, se io eccedevo un po', per il nostro spasso segreto, nel dar filo di speranza all'aquilone di colei che or si librava nei cieli della beatitudine, ora svariava per qualche mia stratta improvvisa e violenta.","But, with this discovery, no thought less than pure entered me for Adriana: her candid goodness suffused with sadness could not inspire any; However, I felt as much joy in that first confidence as and how much the delicate shyness could allow it.

However, I did feel happy about our first intimacy, such as it was, since her delicate shyness permitted little. This intimacy consisted in a fleeting glance, like a graceful dart of the softest light; it was a smile of commiseration for the poor lady’s foolish self-delusion; it was the occasional, kindly reproof which she indicated with her eyes and a slight movement of her head, if I overstepped the mark a little, as we continued our secret diversion in giving wings of hope to that poor woman, who one moment would be soaring high in the skies of felicity and the next was jerked back to earth by some unexpected, violent narration of mine.","Still, even with this surprise, no thought less than pure ever entered my mind concerning Adriana; her innocent goodness, suffused with melancholy, couldn’t inspire anything of the kind.

"Ora, in tempo che le nostre mani facevano questo discorso fitto fitto, io cominciai ad avvertire come uno strofinio alla traversa, tra le due gambe posteriori della seggiola; e mi turbai. Papiano non poteva col piede arrivare fin là; e, quand'anche, la traversa fra le gambe anteriori gliel'avrebbe impedito. Che si fosse alzato dal tavolino e fosse venuto dietro alla mia seggiola? Ma, in questo caso, la signora Candida, se non era proprio scema, avrebbe dovuto avvertirlo. Prima di comunicare a gli altri il fenomeno, avrei voluto in qualche modo spiegarmelo; ma poi pensai che, avendo ottenuto ciò che mi premeva, ora, quasi per obbligo, mi conveniva secondar la frode, senz'altro indugio, per non irritare maggiormente Papiano.

But, in this case, Signora Candida, if she wasn't exactly stupid, should have warned him. Before communicating the phenomenon to others, I would have wanted to explain it to myself in some way; but then I thought that, having obtained what I wanted, now, almost out of obligation, it would be better for me to second the fraud, certainly delay, so as not to irritate Papiano more. And I started to say what I felt.","Now, whilst our hands were engaged in this intimate communications, I started to notice a kind of friction against my chair, between the two back legs, and I was worried. Papiano’s foot could not reach right over to there and in any case, the stretcher between the two back legs would have blocked him. Could he have got up from his place at the table and stood behind my chair? But in that case, unless she really was an imbecile, Signora Candida would have noticed him doing it. Before telling the others about the phenomenon, I wanted to explain it to myself; but then I reasoned that having got what I wanted, now I was almost obliged to go along with the deception, without keeping anyone waiting, so as not to anger Papiano. I hastened to describe what I could feel.","Now, as our hands indulged in this deep conversation, I began to notice a kind of rubbing, or scratching, between the two rear legs of my chair.

But, in this case, Signora Candida—unless she was downright simple-minded —should have glimpsed him.

Oh, gli sarebbe stato facile, libero com'era e senz'obblighi di sorta!","I had enjoyed myself enough, running here and there: Adriano Meis had had his carefree youth in that year; now it was necessary for him to become a man, to gather himself in himself, to form a habit of quiet and modest life.

"«(Bravo, sì! Che fitta di scapaccioni ti darei!)»","""(Bravo, yes! What a pang of scapaccioni I would give you!)""","“Well done, Max!” exclaimed Signor Anselmo, and I said to myself, “Yes, well done, you deserve a jolly good hiding.” ’ “Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like you to give us a sign of your good will towards us,” went on the master of the house.",And I said to myself:—Bravo indeed!

"Mi è avvenuto più volte, svegliandomi nel cuor della notte (la notte, in questo caso, non dimostra veramente d'aver cuore), mi è avvenuto di provare al bujo, nel silenzio, una strana meraviglia, uno strano impaccio al ricordo di qualche cosa fatta durante il giorno, alla luce, senz'abbadarci; e ho domandato allora a me stesso se, a determinar le nostre azioni, non concorrano anche i colori, la vista delle cose circostanti, il vario frastuono della vita. Ma sì, senza dubbio; e chi sa quant'altre cose! Non viviamo noi, secondo il signor Anselmo, in relazione con l'universo? Ora sta a vedere quante sciocchezze questo maledetto universo ci fa commettere, di cui poi chiamiamo responsabile la misera coscienza nostra, tirata da forze esterne, abbagliata da una luce che è fuor di lei. E, all'incontro, quante deliberazioni prese, quanti disegni architettati, quanti espedienti macchinati durante la notte non appajono poi vani e non crollano e non sfumano alla luce del giorno? Com'altro è il giorno, altro la notte, così forse una cosa siamo noi di giorno, altra di notte: miserabilissima cosa, ahimè, così di notte come di giorno.","It has happened to me several times, waking up in the middle of the night (the night, in this case, does not really show that I have a heart), it has happened to me to feel in the dark, in the silence, a strange wonder, a strange embarrassment at the memory of some thing done during the day, in the light, without letting go; and then I asked myself if, in determining our actions, the colors, the sight of the surrounding things, the various noise of life do not contribute. But yes, without a doubt; and who knows how many other things! Do we not live, according to Mr. Anselmo, in relation to the universe? Now see how much nonsense this cursed universe makes us commit, for which we then call our miserable conscience responsible, pulled by external forces, dazzled by a light that is outside of it. And, at the meeting, how many deliberations did you take, how many architectural designs, how many expedients planned during the night do not appear in vain and do not collapse and do not fade in the light of day? As the day is different, the night is different, so perhaps we are one thing during the day, another at night: most miserable thing, alas, both at night and during the day.","I have often woken in the heart of the night (and in such cases the night appears to be quite heartless) and as I lie in the dark, and the silence, I feel a strange wonder, a kind of embarrassment at what I did during the day, in daylight, without really thinking. At these moments, I wonder whether our actions are not determined by colours, the sight of things about us, the various sounds of daily life. Of course, this must be so; and many other things must influence us too. According to Signor Anselmo, we live in close relationship with the universe. So, we merely have to wait and see how much foolishness this universe makes us commit, for which we then hold responsible our miserable consciences, which have been led astray by external forces and dazzled by lights outside themselves. On the other hand, how many decisions taken, plans constructed, expedients machinated during the night, merely crumble, appear vain and dissolve in day light? Just as day is one thing and night another, so perhaps we are one thing in the day and another by night: we are however the most miserable of creatures by day and by night.","More than once, waking in the heart of the night (which, on these occasions, proves it has no heart), I have felt in the silence and darkness a strange wonder, a strange embarrassment at the memory of something I had done during the preceding day, in broad daylight, paying no attention to it. And Fve then asked myself whether our actions are also determined by the colors, the appearance of the things around us, the various hubbub of life. Naturally, there’s no doubt about it— and who knows how many other things also contribute to the process? Don’t we live, as Signor Anselmo says, in relation to the universe? Now apparently this cursed universe makes us commit no end of folly, for which we hold our wretched conscience responsible, though it is impelled by external forces, by a light outside itself. And, at the same time, don’t many of our decisions, the plans we lay, the expedients we think up during the night seem futile, collapse, and vanish in the light of day? As day is different from night, so perhaps we are one thing during the daytime, and another after dark: though poor enough material at any hour."

"Ci accolse con molta cordialità, parlando con spiccato accento napoletano; pregò quindi il suo segretario di seguitare a mostrarmi i ricordi di cui era pieno il salone e che attestavano la sua fedeltà alla dinastia dei Borboni. Quando fummo innanzi a un quadretto coperto da un mantino verde, su cui era ricamata in oro questa leggenda: «Non nascondo; riparo; alzami e leggi» egli pregò Papiano di staccar dalla parete il quadretto e di recarglielo. C'era sotto, riparata dal vetro e incorniciata, una lettera di Pietro Ulloa che, nel settembre del 1860, cioè agli ultimi aneliti del regno, invitava il marchese Giglio d'Auletta a far parte del Ministero che non si poté poi costituire: accanto c'era la minuta della lettera d'accettazione del marchese: fiera lettera che bollava tutti coloro che s'erano rifiutati di assumere la responsabilità del potere in quel momento di supremo pericolo e d'angoscioso scompiglio, di fronte al nemico, al filibustiere Garibaldi già quasi alle porte di Napoli.","He welcomed us very cordially, speaking with a strong Neapolitan accent; he then begged his secretary to continue to show me the memories of which the hall was full and which attested his fidelity to the Bourbon dynasty. When we were in front of a small picture covered by a green mantle, on which this legend was embroidered in gold: «I do not hide; shelter; get me up and read »he begged Papiano to take the picture off the wall and bring it to him. Underneath, sheltered by the glass and framed, was a letter from Pietro Ulloa who, in September 1860, that is, in the last yearnings of the kingdom, invited the Marquis Giglio d'Auletta to be part of the Ministry which could not then be constituted: next there was the detail of the letter of acceptance from the Marquis: a proud letter that stamped all those who had refused to assume the responsibility of power in that moment of supreme danger and anguish in front of the enemy, the filibuster Garibaldi already almost at the gates of Naples.","He greeted us with great cordiality, speaking with a marked Neapolitan accent. He then asked his secretary to show me all the relics which the room contained, and which attested to his fidelity to the Bourbon dynasty. When we were in front of a little picture covered by a green cloth, on which were these words, embroidered in gold: “ I hide nothing; I merely serve as a screen; raise me and read,” he asked Papiano to take the picture off the wall and bring it to him. Underneath, framed and protected by glass, was a letter from Pietro Ulloa who, in September 1860, in other words, in the last dying days of the Kingdom, invited the Marchese Giglio d’Auletta to be part of the Ministry which in the event he was never going to be able to set up. Next to it was a draft of the Marchese’s letter of acceptance, a proud letter, which berated all those who had refused to take the responsibility of power at that time of great danger and painful upheaval when faced with the enemy, the freebooter Garibaldi, already virtually at the gates of Naples.","He received us most cordially, speaking with a marked Neapolitan accent; then he begged his secretary to continue to show us the various mementos that filled the room, attesting his loyalty to the Bourbon dynasty. At the end we were standing in front of a little square frame covered by a green cloth with the gold-embroidered legend: I do not hide; I protect. Lift me and read. The Marchese asked Papiano to remove the object from the wall and bring it to him. Beneath the cloth there wasn't a picture, but instead, framed under glass, a letter from the Royal Minister Pietro Ulloa who, in 1860, that is to say during the death throes of the realm, invited the Marchese Giglio d’Auletta to be a member of the Cabinet which was never to be formed. Along with this invitation there was the draft of the Marchese’s letter of acceptance: a proud letter that castigated those who refused to accept the responsibility of power in this moment of supreme danger and anxiety with the enemy, the bandit Garibaldi, almost at the gates of Naples."

"Già, quella vendita non giovò a nulla. Il Malagna, con quel figlio nascituro, che lo abilitava ormai a non aver più né ritegno né scrupolo, fece l'ultima: si mise d'accordo con gli strozzini, e comprò lui, senza figurare, le case, per pochi bajocchi. I debiti che gravavano su la Stìa restarono così per la maggior parte scoperti e il podere insieme col molino fu messo dai creditori sotto amministrazione giudiziaria. E fummo liquidati.","Yep, that sale didn't do any good. Malagna, with that unborn son, who by now enabled him to no longer have neither restraint nor scruple, made the last one: he made an agreement with the loan sharks, and he bought the houses, without mentioning, for a few bajocchi. The debts that weighed on the Stìa thus remained for the most part uncovered and the farm together with the mill was placed under judicial administration by the creditors. And we were liquidated.","In any case the sale did no good. Malagna, made confident by his impending fatherhood, felt no more restraint or scruple, and did the ultimate: he came to an agreement with the creditors and bought the houses himself, anonymously, for a pathetic sum. Because of this, the debts we had on La Stia were, for the most part, not covered, and the holding and the mill were placed by our creditors in the hands of the official receiver and we were declared bankrupt.","Of course, the sale did no good at all. Malagna, with his heir on the way, now felt no restraint or scruple, and he achieved his final treachery. He made an agreement with the moneylenders, and without revealing his name, he bought in all our houses for a few pennies. So the debts that burdened the farm and the mill remained more or less as they were, and both were put into the hands of receivers by our debtors. We were out of it."
"Feci in tempo a trattenerla ancora una volta. Non ci mancava altro, che ora, per giunta, Adriana mi costringesse a denunziare il furto! Non bastava che mi avessero rubato, come niente, dodici mila lire? Dovevo anche temere che il furto si conoscesse; pregare, scongiurare Adriana che non lo gridasse forte, non lo dicesse a nessuno, per carità? Ma che! Adriana - e ora lo intendo bene - non poteva assolutamente permettere che io tacessi e obbligassi anche lei al silenzio, non poteva in verun modo accettare quella che pareva una mia generosità, per tante ragioni: prima per il suo amore, poi per l'onorabilità della sua casa, e anche per me e per l'odio ch'ella portava al cognato.","I had time to hold her back once more. All we needed was that now, in addition, Adriana would force me to report the theft! Wasn't it enough that they had stolen, like nothing, twelve thousand lire? I also had to fear that the theft was known; to pray, to prevent Adriana from shouting it out loud, not telling anyone, for heaven's sake? What! Adriana - and now I understand it well - absolutely could not allow me to keep silent and force her to be silent too, she could not in any way accept what seemed to be my generosity, for many reasons: first for her love, then for her honor. of her house, and also for me and for the hatred she brought to her brother-in-law.","I was just in time to prevent her once again. It would be the last straw if, to cap everything, Adriana made me report the theft. Was it not sufficient that he had taken twelve thousand lire as if it were nothing? Did I also have to fear that the theft would be known; to beg Adriana, make her vow not to tell anyone for pity’s sake? But no, I can see that Adriana would never have allowed me to keep quiet about it and oblige her to silence too. She could not possibly accept what appeared to her to be generosity on my part. There were many reasons for this: first, her love for me, then her family’s honour and mine too, and finally the hatred she felt for her brother-in-law.","Again I was just in time to restrain her. All I needed now was for Adriana to force me to report the theft! Wasn't it bad enough that they'd stolen twelve thousand lire from me, as if it were nothing? Did I also have to fear that the theft might become known, did I have to pray and beg Adriana not to shout so loud, not to tell anyone about it, for heaven's sake? Ha! Adriana—as I now am well aware—absolutely couldn't permit me to remain silent and force her to be silent too. She couldn't accept what to her seemed my generosity, and for many reasons: first because of her love, then because of the honor of her family, and also because of me and the hatred she bore her brother-in-law."
"Dall'esasperazione con cui proferì queste parole mi parve d'intendere a un tratto la vera ragione per cui Pomino era così addogliato. Ecco qua: non tanto Romilda egli forse rimpiangeva, quanto la compagnia che gli era venuta a mancare; Berto non c'era più; con me non poteva più praticare, perché c'era Romilda di mezzo, e che restava più dunque da fare al povero Pomino?","From the exasperation with which he uttered these words it seemed to me that I suddenly understood the real reason why Pomino was so sorry. Here it is: not so much Romilda perhaps he regretted, as much as the company that had failed him; Berto was gone; he could no longer practice with me, because Romilda was involved, and what was left then for poor Pomino to do?","The exasperation with which he uttered these words suddenly made me understand the real reason why Pomino was so distressed. Perhaps he did not regret the loss of Romilda in particular, so much as the company he now lacked. Berto was gone; he could not mix with me because of Romilda, so what was there left for him to do?","From the exasperation with which he uttered these words I all of a sudden began to understand the real reason for Pomino's sadness. He didn't so much regret the loss of Romilda as he did the companionship he now missed. Berto had gone off. Pomino couldn't hang around with me because Romilda was between us, so what could the poor fellow do?"

"Se però erano ragionevoli e naturali in me l'avvilimento e la stizza, mi accorsi, riflettendoci bene, che sarebbe stata per lo meno sciocca quella domanda. Infatti, se il caro ometto imbizzarriva cosi a farmi credere a quelle sue avventure, la ragione era appunto nel non aver egli alcun bisogno di mentire; mentre io… io vi ero obbligato dalla necessità. Ciò che per lui, insomma, poteva essere uno spasso e quasi l'esercizio d'un diritto, era per me, all'incontro, obbligo increscioso, condanna.","But if the humiliation and anger were reasonable and natural in me, I realized, on reflection, that that question would at least be foolish. In fact, if the dear little man thus raged to make me believe in those adventures of his, the reason was precisely that he did not have any need to lie; while I ... I was forced to you by necessity. In short, what for him could have been fun and almost the exercise of a right, was for me, at the encounter, an unfortunate obligation, a condemnation.","But though these reactions of mine were reasonable and natural, I realised, on reflection, that my question was pointless. If the dear little man found it so exciting to have me believe the stories of his adventures, this could only be because he had no need to lie like that; whilst I …. I had no choice. In short, what for him was an amusement, the exercising of an option, was a crushing obligation for me, a life sentence.","If, however, my depression and irritation were natural enough, I realized, on sober reflection, that such a question would have been foolish, to say the least. In fact, if that little man so bestirred himself to make me believe in these adventures of his, the reason was precisely that he had no need to lie. But I . . . I was forced to by necessity. What for him could be an amusement, almost the exercise of a privilege, was for me the opposite, a painful duty, a punishment."

"Ogni minimo che - sospeso come già da un pezzo mi sentivo in un vuoto strano - mi faceva ora cadere in lunghe riflessioni. Questo dell'acquasantiera m'indusse a pensare che, fin da ragazzo, io non avevo più atteso a pratiche religiose, né ero più entrato in alcuna chiesa per pregare, andato via Pinzone che mi vi conduceva insieme con Berto, per ordine della mamma. Non avevo mai sentito alcun bisogno di domandare a me stesso se avessi veramente una fede. E Mattia Pascal era morto di mala morte senza conforti religiosi.","Every little thing that - suspended as I had for some time already felt in a strange emptiness - now made me fall into long reflections. This holy water stoup led me to think that, since I was a boy, I had no longer attended to religious practices, nor had I entered any church to pray, left Pinzone who took me there together with Berto, by order of my mother. I had never felt any need to ask myself if I really had faith. And Mattia Pascal had died a bad death without religious comfort.","Suspended as I was in the strange void of my existence, the slightest stimulus plunged me into lengthy reflections. The episode of the holywater stoup led me to think that not since I was a boy had I bothered with religious practices, and I had never entered a church to pray once since Pinzone, who used to take me and Berto on mother’s orders, had gone away. I had never felt the need to ask myself whether I really had a faith; and Mattia Pascal had died in mortal sin without the comforts of religion.","Thanks to the curious emptiness in which I had been suspended for such a long time, the slightest event now made me sink into long meditations. The matter of the holy water stoup reminded me that since my boyhood days I hadn't observed any religious practices, nor had I entered any church to pray, after the departure of Tweezer, who used to take me to church with Berto, on Mamma's orders. I had never felt the necessity to ask myself if I really had any faith. And Mat-tia Pascal had died a sinful death without the comforts of religion."

"Tuttavia, per quanto facessi, appena sceso a Nizza, non mi riuscì di liberarmene: dovetti andar con lui a cena.

The little woman had had to win well that evening, following my game, since, at the exit, she had never been seen again.","However, regardless of my efforts to get rid of him when we reached Nice, I was stuck with him. I had to dine with him. He then confessed to me that it was he who had sent the cheerful little woman to me in the vestibule. For three days he had been trying to attach wings to her and make her fly, just a little, even if she remained very close to the ground.

"Innanzi all'uscio della mia camera Adriana mi strinse forte la mano, come finora non aveva mai fatto. Rimasto solo, io tenni a lungo il pugno stretto, come per serbar la pressione della mano di lei. Tutta quella notte rimasi a pensare, dibattendomi tra continue smanie. La cerimoniosa ipocrisia, la servilità insinuante e loquace, il malanimo di quell'uomo mi avrebbero certamente reso intollerabile la permanenza in quella casa, su cui egli - non c'era dubbio - voleva tiranneggiare, approfittando della dabbenaggine del suocero. Chi sa a quali arti sarebbe ricorso! Già me n'aveva dato un saggio, cangiando di punto in bianco, al mio apparire. Ma perché vedeva così di malocchio ch'io alloggiassi in quella casa? perché non ero io per lui un inquilino come un altro? Che gli aveva detto di me la Caporale? poteva egli sul serio esser geloso di costei? o era geloso di un'altra? Quel suo fare arrogante e sospettoso; l'aver cacciato via la Caporale per restar solo con Adriana, alla quale aveva preso a parlare con tanta violenza; la ribellione di Adriana; il non aver ella permesso ch'egli chiudesse le imposte; il turbamento ond'era presa ogni qualvolta s'accennava al cognato assente, tutto, tutto ribadiva in me il sospetto odioso ch'egli avesse qualche mira su lei.","At the door of my room Adriana squeezed my hand tightly, as she had never done before. Left alone, I kept my fist clenched for a long time, as if to keep the pressure of her hand. All that night I was thinking, struggling with constant desires. The ceremonious hypocrisy, the insinuating and talkative servility, the malice of that man would certainly have made my stay in that house intolerable, over which he - there was no doubt - wanted to tyrannize, taking advantage of the gullibility of his father-in-law. Who knows what arts he would have resorted to! He had already given me an essay, changing point blank when I appeared. But why did he see so badly that I was staying in that house? why wasn't I a tenant like any other for him? What had the corporal told him about me? could he really be jealous of her? or was he jealous of someone else? His arrogant and suspicious behavior; having chased the corporal away to be alone with Adriana, to whom he had begun to speak with such violence; the rebellion of Adriana; not having allowed him to close the shutters; the disturbance which she had taken every time she mentioned the absent brother-in-law, everything, everything reaffirmed in me the hateful suspicion that he had some aim on her.","Outside my door, Adriana squeezed my hand, hard, harder than she had ever done before. When I was alone, I kept my hand closed for a long while, as if to preserve the pressure of her hand. At night I thought about it, torn by continuous doubts. The ceremonious hypocrisy, insidious and loquacious servility, the malevolence of that man were bound to make it intolerable for me to stay in that house, which he, doubtless, wanted to tyrannise, profiting from the malleability of his father-in-law. He might have recourse to any number of tricks. He had already given me a sample, changing from one moment to the next, when I appeared. But why did he object so much to me being in the house? Why was I not just a lodger to him, like any other? What had Miss Caporale told him about me? Could he really be jealous of her? Or was it of some other woman? His arrogant, suspicious manner, his getting rid of Miss Caporale so as to be alone with Adriana to whom he had started speaking with such violence, Adriana’s rebellion, her refusal to let him close the doors, the unease that gripped her every time her absent brother-in-law was mentioned, everything pointed to the awful suspicion that he had his sights set on her.","At the door of my room, Adriana clasped my hand warmly, as she had never done before. When I was alone, for a long time I kept my hand clenched, as if to hold on to her hand's pressure. All that night I lay awake, thinking, in the grip of mad longings. The ceremonious hypocrisy, the insinuating, garrulous servility, the malevolence of the man would certainly have made it unbearable for me to stay in the house where he undoubtedly wanted to act as tyrant, exploiting the kindliness of his father-in-law. Who knows what wiles he would adopt? He had already given me a sample, changing his manner abruptly when I appeared. But why did he so disapprove of my staying in the house? Why wasn't I simply a lodger like anyone else? What had Signorina Caporale said to him about me? Could he really be jealous of her? Or was he jealous of someone else? That suspicious, arrogant manner of his, the way he sent the piano teacher off so that he could be alone with Adriana, to whom he had then spoken so violently; her rebellion; her refusal to let him close the blinds; the agitation that had always seized her in the past at any mention of her absent brother-in-law—all these things confirmed my hateful suspicions that the man was planning something that involved her."
"L'altro, ch'era un vecchietto magro magro, tranquillo nel suo ascetico squallore, ma pur con una piega a gli angoli della bocca che tradiva la sottile ironia, seduto quasi su la schiena, col collo lungo proteso come sotto un giogo, sosteneva invece che non c'era da fidarsi delle più antiche testimonianze.","The other, who was a thin old man, quiet in his ascetic squalor, but even with a crease at the corners of his mouth that betrayed the subtle irony, sat almost on his back, with his long neck stretched out as if under a yoke, supported instead of trusting the most ancient testimonies.","The other, a skinny little old man, unmoved in his dingy ascetism, but with a twist at the corners of his mouth which betrayed a subtle hint of irony, was leaning right back, his long neck stretched out forwards as it under a yoke and was maintaining that one could not trust even the most ancient of testimonies.","His companion was a dreadfully thin old man, quite serene in his ascetic squalor, and yet with a wrinkle at the corners of his mouth that revealed a subtle irony.

I bought the beautifully made dress in a shop and left it on me; with the new suitcase, I went down to the Hotel Nettuno.","So as not to have to go into a hotel empty-handed, I bought a suitcase.

I bought a suit off the peg from a tailor and kept it on. Carrying my new suitcase, I arrived at the Hotel Neptune.","I didn't want to go into a hotel empty-handed, so I bought a suitcase.

"- Subito, - diss'io; ma un'improvvisa tenerezza mi prese,- comprendendo ch'ella era venuta con la scusa di quella nota per aver da me una parola che la raffermasse nelle sue speranze; un'angosciosa, profonda pietà mi vinse, pietà di lei e di me, pietà crudele, che mi spingeva irresistibilmente a carezzarla, a carezzare in lei il mio dolore, il quale soltanto in lei, che pur ne era la causa, poteva trovar conforto. E pur sapendo che mi sarei compromesso ancor più, non seppi resistere: le porsi ambo le mani. Ella, fiduciosa, ma col volto in fiamme, alzò pian piano sue e le pose sulle mie. Mi attirai allora la sua testina bionda sul petto e le passai una mano su i capelli.","""Right away,"" I said; but a sudden tenderness took me, - realizing that she had come with the excuse of that note to have a word from me that would confirm her hopes; an anguished, deep pity overcame me, pity on her and me, cruel pity, which compelled me irresistibly to caress her, to caress my pain in her, which only in her, which was the cause, could find comfort . And even knowing that I would compromise myself even more, I could not resist: I held out both hands to her. She, confident, but with her face on fire, slowly raised hers and placed them on mine. I then pulled her little blonde head to my chest and ran a hand over her hair.","“I’ll deal with it straightaway,” I said, but an unexpected tenderness gripped me, as I realised that she had come with the excuse of that bill in order to exchange a few words with me which might confirm her hopes. A deep, painful pity came over me, pity for her and for me, a cruel pity which drove me inexorably to caress her, to caress in her my own pain, which could only find comfort in her, even though she was its cause. Knowing that I would be compromised even further, I could not resist nevertheless, and stretched out both my hands to her. Trusting, but her face in flames, she slowly raised her hands and placed them in mine. I drew her little fair head towards me, rested it on my chest and stroked her hair.","“I'll settle it at once,"" I said. But a sudden tenderness gripped me, as I realized that she had come with that bill as an excuse, seeking a word from me that could confirm her hopes.

And though I knew I was only compromising myself further, I couldn't resist. I held out both hands to her. Trustingly, but with her face aflame, she slowly raised her hands and placed them in mine. Then I drew her little blond head to my breast and ran my hand over her hair."
"Accenno a quest'avventura, non per farmi bello d'un atto di coraggio, ma per dire anzi della paura che provai per le conseguenze di esso. Erano quattro quei mascalzoni, ma avevo anch'io un buon bastone ferrato. E vero che due di essi mi s'avventarono contro anche coi coltelli. Mi difesi alla meglio, facendo il mulinello e saltando a tempo in qua e in là per non farmi prendere in mezzo; riuscii alla fine ad appoggiar sul capo al più accanito un colpo bene assestato, col pomo di ferro: lo vidi vacillare, poi prender la corsa; gli altri tre allora, forse temendo che qualcuno stesse ormai per accorrere agli strilli della donna, lo seguirono. Non so come, mi trovai ferito alla fronte. Gridai alla donna, che non smetteva ancora di chiamare ajuto, che si stesse zitta; ma ella, vedendomi con la faccia rigata di sangue, non seppe frenarsi e, piangendo, tutta scarmigliata, voleva soccorrermi, fasciarmi col fazzoletto di seta che portava sul seno, stracciato nella rissa.","I mention this adventure, not to make myself beautiful with an act of courage, but rather to speak of the fear I felt for the consequences of it. There were four rascals, but I too had a good shod stick. It is true that two of them also rushed at me with knives. I defended myself as best I could, whirling around and jumping in time here and there so as not to get caught in the middle; in the end I was able to place a well-aimed blow on the head on the head, with an iron knob: I saw him waver, then take the run; the other three then, perhaps fearing that someone was about to rush to the screams of the woman, followed him. I don't know how, I found myself wounded in the forehead. I shouted to the woman, who still hadn't stopped calling for help, to shut up; but she, seeing me with my face streaked with blood, could not restrain herself and, crying, all disheveled, she wanted to help me, bind me with the silk handkerchief which she wore on her breast, torn in the fight.","I mention this adventure, not to show myself in a good light because of my own courageousness, but rather to describe the fear I suffered as a consequence of that courage. There were four of these hooligans, but I was armed too, with a good, strong, metal-tipped walking stick. Two of them did in fact set on me with knives. I defended myself as best I could twirling round and leaping here and there so as not to let myself get surrounded. Eventually I managed to land a well-aimed blow on the most ferocious one and got him right on the head with the metal tip. He tottered a little, then turned and fled. The other three, perhaps afraid that someone else by now had heard the woman’s cries and would come to her aid, followed him. Somehow, my forehead seemed to have been injured. I shouted at the woman to be quiet, as she still had not ceased her cries for help. But when she saw my face streaming with blood, she tried to tend me and dress my wound with the silk square which she wore over her breast and which had been ripped in the struggle.","I mention this adventure not to glorify my courage, but to tell instead of my fear as a result of what happened. There were four of those rogues, but I had a sound cane with an iron tip. It's true that a pair of them came at me with knives, but I defended myself as best I could, swinging my cane in a circle, and ducking this way and that so as not to be caught in the middle. In the end I managed to bring the iron tip of the cane squarely down on the head of the most insistent of the four; I saw him stagger, then run off. The other three, fearing that the woman's screams would bring people to the scene, followed the first. I discovered that I had been somehow wounded on the forehead. I shouted at the woman, who hadn't stopped calling for help, and told her to be quiet. But seeing my face streaked with blood, she couldn't control herself and, all disheveled and weeping, she wanted to help me, and bandage me, taking from around her neck a silk scarf that had been tom in the fighting."

"Secondo le notizie che Papiano mi diede di lui, io, andando a Montecarlo, non potevo non incontrarvelo, poich'egli era un giocatore di professione. Strano era che lo incontrassi ora a Roma, o piuttosto, che io, venendo a Roma, mi fossi intoppato in una casa, ove anch'egli poteva entrare. Certo, s'io non avessi avuto da temere, questo caso non mi sarebbe parso tanto strano: quante volte infatti non ci avviene d'imbatterci inaspettatamente in qualcuno che abbiamo conosciuto altrove per combinazione? Del resto, egli aveva o credeva d'avere le sue buone ragioni per venire a Roma e in casa di Papiano. Il torto era mio, o del caso che mi aveva fatto radere la barba e cangiare il nome.","According to the news that Papiano gave me about him, on my way to Monte Carlo, I could not fail to meet him, since he was a professional player. It was strange that I now met him in Rome, or rather, that I, coming to Rome, had stumbled upon a house where he too could enter. Of course, if I hadn't had anything to fear, this case would not have seemed so strange to me: how many times in fact do we not unexpectedly run into someone we have known elsewhere by coincidence? Moreover, he had or believed he had good reasons for coming to Rome and to Papiano's house. The wrong was mine, or of the case that had made me shave my beard and change my name.","According to what Papiano told me of him, there was no way I could not have met him by going to Montecarlo, since he was a professional gambler. The odd thing was that I should meet him now in Rome, or rather that having come to Rome, I had ended up in a house where he was likely to be a guest. Of course, if I had had nothing to hide, this coincidence would not have seemed all that odd: in fact, it is commonplace to bump into someone unexpectedly that by chance we have met elsewhere. Besides, he had good reason, or thought he had, for coming to Rome and to Papiano’s house. The fault was mine, or rather fate’s which had made me shave off my beard and change my name.","According to what Papiano told me about the man, I could hardly have avoided meeting him in Monte Carlo, because he was a professional gambler. The strange thing was that I should meet him now in Rome, or rather, that on coming to Rome, I should stumble into a house where he could also enter. Certainly, if I had had nothing to fear, this coincidence wouldn't have seemed so odd to me; don't we often unexpectedly run into people we've met elsewhere by chance? For that matter, the Spaniard had—or thought he had—good reason for coming to Rome and to Papiano's house.

Ma ritorsi subito a me stesso la domanda:,But I immediately asked myself the question:,But then I turned the question on myself:,But I immediately asked myself the same question:
"- Ma io mi annojo, caro signore! m'annojo! - scattò l'ometto. - Per me, la solitudine… eh si, infine, mi sono stancato. Ho tanti amici; ma, creda pure, non è una bella cosa, a una certa età, andare a casa e non trovar nessuno. Mah! C'è chi comprende e chi non comprende, caro signore. Sta molto peggio chi comprende, perché alla fine si ritrova senza energia e senza volontà. Chi comprende, infatti, dice: «Io non devo far questo, non devo far quest'altro, per non commettere questa o quella bestialità». Benissimo! Ma a un certo punto s'accorge che la vita è tutta una bestialità, e allora dica un po' lei che cosa significa il non averne commessa nessuna: significa per lo meno non aver vissuto, caro signore.","- But I'm bored, dear sir! I'm bored! snapped the little man. - For me, loneliness ... oh yes, finally, I got tired. I have many friends; but, believe me, it is not a good thing, at a certain age, to go home and not find anyone. Mah! There are those who understand and those who do not understand, dear sir. Those who understand are much worse off, because in the end they find themselves without energy and without will. Those who understand, in fact, say: ""I must not do this, I must not do this other, in order not to commit this or that bestiality"". Very well! But at a certain point you realize that life is all a bestiality, and then tell yourself what it means not to have committed any: it means at least not having lived, dear sir.","“But I get bored, my dear fellow, I get bored!” he burst out. “For me, solitude … well, I’m tired of it. I have plenty of friends, but believe me, it is no good thing at my age to get home and find the house empty. There are those who understand and those who don’t. The man who understands his situation is worse off, because eventually he has no more energy and no more willpower left. The man who understands in fact, says to himself, ‘I mustn’t do this or that, to avoid falling into this or that foolishness.’ Fine, but then he suddenly realises that all of life is mere foolishness, and so you tell me what’s the point of never having been foolish: it means in fact you’ve never lived.”","“But I'm bored, my dear sir! Bored!” the man snapped. “For me, solitude ... ah yes, I'm tired of it. I've many friends, but believe me, when you've reached a certain age, it isn't so enjoyable to go home and find no one there. Hm! There are those who understand, my friend, and those who don't. Those who understand, in fact, say: 'I mustn't do this,I mustn't do that,' so as not to commit some stupidity or other! Splendid! But at a certain point we realize that all life is stupidity; so tell me yourself what it means never to have done anything foolish. At the very least it means you have never lived.”"
"- Come no! Quello che sta laggiù, alla biblioteca Boccamazza. E' sordo, quasi cieco, rimbecillito, e non si regge più sulle gambe.

"Nei primi mesi fu un divertimento, con quel Romitelli, a cui non ci fu verso di fare intendere che era stato giubilato dal Comune e che per ciò non doveva più venire alla biblioteca. Ogni mattina, alla stess'ora, né un minuto prima né un minuto dopo, me lo vedevo spuntare a quattro piedi (compresi i due bastoni, uno per mano, che gli servivano meglio dei piedi). Appena arrivato, si toglieva dal taschino del panciotto un vecchio cipollone di rame, e lo appendeva a muro con tutta la formidabile catena; sedeva, coi due bastoni fra le gambe, traeva di tasca la papalina, la tabacchiera e un pezzolone a dadi rossi e neri; s'infrociava una grossa presa di tabacco, si puliva, poi apriva il cassetto del tavolino e ne traeva un libraccio che apparteneva alla biblioteca: Dizionario storico dei musicisti, artisti e amatori morti e viventi, stampato a Venezia nel 1758.","In the first months it was fun, with that Romitelli, to whom there was no way of making it clear that he had been rejoiced by the Municipality and that for this he no longer had to come to the library. Every morning, at the same time, neither a minute before nor a minute later, I saw him appear on all fours (including the two sticks, one in each hand, which served him better than his feet). As soon as he arrived, he took an old copper onion from his waistcoat pocket and hung it on the wall with all the formidable chain; he sat, with two sticks between his legs, took out of his pocket the skullcap, the snuffbox, and a large piece of red and black dice; he grabbed a large pinch of tobacco, cleaned himself, then opened the drawer of the table and took out a book that belonged to the library: Historical Dictionary of dead and living musicians, artists and amateurs, printed in Venice in 1758.","The first few months were almost entertaining, working with Romitelli, to whom there was no means of conveying the information that he had been pensioned off by the council and no longer needed to come in to work. Every morning, at the same time, neither a minute early or late, he would appear, on all fours (by this I mean to include the two sticks he had, one in each hand, which were more useful than his own legs). As soon as he arrived, he took from his waistcoat pocket a large, antique watch, made of brass, which he hung on the wall, attached by its redoubtable chain. He would sit, his two sticks between his legs, take his smoking-cap out of his pocket, along with his tobacco pouch and a red and black chequered handkerchief. He then took a large sniff of tobacco, wiped his nose, then opened the desk drawer and took out a library book, entitled Historical dictionary of musicians, artists and amateurs, living and dead, printed in 1758.","For the first months it was almost fun with old Romitelli who couldn't be made to understand that City Hall had put him out to grass and therefore he shouldn't come to the library any more. Every morning at the same hour, not a moment earlier nor a moment later, I saw him appear on his four legs (counting the two canes, one in each hand, which served him better than his feet did). As soon as he arrived, he took an old copper turnip from his pocket and hung it on the wall with its impressive length of chain. Then he would sit down, the canes between his legs, take his nightcap from another pocket, his snuffbox, and a big handkerchief with red and black checks. He would thrust a generous pinch of snuff into his nostrils, wipe his nose, then open the drawer of the table and take out one of the library's books: Historical Dictionary of Musicians, Artists and Amateurs, Living and Dead, printed in Venice in 1758."
"Rimasi, non so per quanto tempo, li su quella poltrona, a pensare, ora con gli occhi sbarrati, ora restringendomi tutto in me, rabbiosamente, come per schermirmi da un fitto spasimo interno.

"Ma come, signor Meis, se alla lampa nostra manca l'olio sacro che alimentava quella del Poeta? Molti ancora vanno nelle chiese per provvedere dell'alimento necessario le loro lanternucce. Sono, per lo più, poveri vecchi, povere donne, a cui mentì la vita, e che vanno innanzi, nel bujo dell'esistenza, con quel loro sentimento acceso come una lampadina votiva, cui con trepida cura riparano dal gelido soffio degli ultimi disinganni, ché duri almeno accesa fin là, fino all'orlo fatale, al quale s'affrettano, tenendo gli occhi intenti alla fiamma e pensando di continuo: «Dio mi vede!» per non udire i clamori della vita intorno, che suonano ai loro orecchi come tante bestemmie. «Dio mi vede…» perché lo vedono loro, non solamente in sé, ma in tutto, anche nella loro miseria, nelle loro sofferenze, che avranno un premio, alla fine. Il fioco, ma placido lume di queste lanternucce desta certo invidia angosciosa in molti di noi; a certi altri, invece, che si credono armati, come tanti Giove, del fulmine domato dalla scienza, e, in luogo di quelle lanternucce, recano in trionfo le lampadine elettriche, ispira una sdegnosa commiserazione. Ma domando io ora, signor Meis: E se tutto questo bujo, quest'enorme mistero, nel quale indarno i filosofi dapprima specularono, e che ora, pur rinunziando all'indagine di esso, la scienza non esclude, non fosse in fondo che un inganno come un altro, un inganno della nostra mente, una fantasia che non si colora? Se noi finalmente ci persuadessimo che tutto questo mistero non esiste fuori di noi, ma soltanto in noi, e necessariamente, per il famoso privilegio del sentimento che noi abbiamo della vita, del lanternino cioè, di cui le ho finora parlato? Se la morte, insomma, che ci fa tanta paura, non esistesse e fosse soltanto, non l'estinzione della vita, ma il soffio che spegne in noi questo lanternino, lo sciagurato sentimento che noi abbiamo di essa, penoso, pauroso, perché limitato, definito da questo cerchio d'ombra fittizia, oltre il breve àmbito dello scarso lume, che noi, povere lucciole sperdute, ci projettiamo attorno, e in cui la vita nostra rimane come imprigionata, come esclusa per alcun tempo dalla vita universale, eterna, nella quale ci sembra che dovremo un giorno rientrare, mentre già ci siamo e sempre vi rimarremo, ma senza più questo sentimento d'esilio che ci angoscia? Il limite è illusorio, è relativo al poco lume nostro, della nostra individualità: nella realtà della natura non esiste. Noi, - non so se questo possa farle piacere - noi abbiamo sempre vissuto e sempre vivremo con l'universo; anche ora, in questa forma nostra, partecipiamo a tutte le manifestazioni dell'universo, ma non lo sappiamo, non lo vediamo, perché purtroppo questo maledetto lumicino piagnucoloso ci fa vedere soltanto quel poco a cui esso arriva; e ce lo facesse vedere almeno com'esso è in realtà! Ma nossignore: ce lo colora a modo suo, e ci fa vedere certe cose, che noi dobbiamo veramente lamentare, perbacco, che forse in un'altra forma d'esistenza non avremo più una bocca per poterne fare le matte risate. Risate, signor Meis, di tutte le vane, stupide afflizioni che esso ci ha procurate, di tutte le ombre, di tutti i fantasmi ambiziosi e strani che ci fece sorgere innanzi e intorno, della paura che c'ispirò!","But how, Monsieur Meis, if our lamp lacks the sacred oil that fed the Poet's? Many still go to churches to provide food for their lanterns. They are, for the most part, poor old men, poor women, to whom life lied, and who go forward, in the darkness of existence, with that feeling of theirs lit like a votive light bulb, which with anxious care they shelter from the icy breath of the latest disappointments. , that it lasts at least lit up there, to the fatal edge, to which they hurry, keeping their eyes intent on the flame and constantly thinking: ""God sees me!"" so as not to hear the clamors of life around them, which ring in their ears like so many blasphemies. ""God sees me ..."" because they see him, not only in themselves, but in everything, even in their misery, in their sufferings, which will have a reward in the end. The dim but placid light of these lanterns certainly arouses anguished envy in many of us; to certain others, on the other hand, who believe themselves armed, like so many Jupiter, with the lightning bolt tamed by science, and, in place of those lanterns, carry electric bulbs in triumph, inspires a disdainful commiseration. But now I ask, Mr.Meis: And if all this darkness, this enormous mystery, in which the philosophers at first speculated in vain, and which now, while renouncing the investigation of it, science does not exclude, were basically only a deception like any other, a deception of our mind, a fantasy that doesn't color? What if we finally persuaded ourselves that all this mystery does not exist outside of us, but only within us, and necessarily, due to the famous privilege of the feeling we have of life, that is, of the lantern, of which I have so far spoken to you? If death, in short, which scares us so much, did not exist and was only, not the extinction of life, but the breath that extinguishes this lantern in us, the unfortunate feeling we have of it, painful, fearful, because it is limited. , defined by this circle of fictitious shadow, beyond the short range of the scarce light, which we, poor lost fireflies, project around us, and in which our life remains as if imprisoned, as excluded for some time from universal, eternal life, in which it seems to us that one day we will have to return, while we are already there and will always remain there, but without this feeling of exile that anguishes us anymore? The limit is illusory, it is relative to our little light, of our individuality: in the reality of nature it does not exist. We - I don't know if this would please her - we have always lived and always will live with the universe; even now, in this form of ours, we participate in all the manifestations of the universe, but we do not know it, we do not see it, because unfortunately this accursed weeping light makes us see only what little it reaches; and let us see it at least as it really is! But no sir: he colors it in his own way, and shows us certain things, which we really have to complain about, by God, that perhaps in another form of existence we will no longer have a mouth to be able to laugh at it. Laughter, Mr. Meis, of all the vain, stupid afflictions that it has caused us, of all the shadows, of all the ambitious and strange ghosts that it raised before and around us, of the fear that it inspired us!","But Signor Meis, what if our lamp does not contain the holy oil which fed the poet’s lamp? Many people still go to church to get the necessary nourishment for their internal lanterns. On the whole they are poor old men and women let down by life who go forward in the darkness of life with their sentiments lit up like a votive lamp, which they shelter with fearful care from the chill draught of the final disillusionment, so that they stay alight at least thus far, to the fatal brink, towards which they hasten, their eyes intent on the flame and constantly thinking, ‘God sees me!’ so as not to hear the clamour of the world around them, which sounds to them like so much blasphemy: ‘God sees me,’ because they see him, not only in themselves, but in everything, even in their poverty, their suffering, which will be rewarded at the end. The weak, but constant light of these little lanterns of course awakens a painful envy in many of us; whilst certain others, who think they are armed, like so many Jupiters, with the tame thunderbolt of science and who, in place of the little lanterns, carry triumphantly electric torches, feel disdain and pity. But I ask you, Signor Meis, what if all this darkness, this great mystery, about which the philosphers speculated in vain and which now science cannot exclude but nevertheless refuses to investigate, turned out to be basically a trick like any other, a trick of our own minds, a fantasy which cannot be shaded in different colours? What if we at last convinced ourselves that all this mystery does not exist outside ourselves, but only within us, and of necessity, by virtue of the famous privilege, that feeling we have for life, the little lantern I mean, which I have been talking to you about? If death, in short, which we are so afraid of, did not exist, and was only not the extinction of life but the draught which extinguishes the lantern in us, the wretched awareness of life that we have, painful, fearful, because so limited, defined by the fictitious circle of shadow, beyond the brief scope of the scant light, that we, poor scattered fireflies, project about ourselves and in which our lives are as if imprisoned, as if excluded for a while from universal, eternal life, to which it seems that one day we will return, whilst we are already there and will always stay there, but without this feeling of exile any longer, that causes us so much pain? The boundary is an illusion and relative to the sparseness of our light, of our individuality: in nature’s reality it does not exist. We — and I don’t know if you will like this idea — we have always and will always live with the universe; even now, in the form we have, we take part in all the manifestations of the universe, but we don’t know it , we don’t see it, because unfortunately, this accursed, snivelling little light only lets us see that small distance it reaches: if only at least it let us see what things are like in reality! But no, it colours it in its own way, it makes us see certain things which really will make us maybe regret that in another form of existence we won’t have a mouth to be able to really laugh about it. Laugh, yes, Signor Meis, laugh at all the vain, stupid suffering it has caused us, all the shadows, all the ambitious, strange ghosts it makes rise up around us and in front of us, laugh at the fear it inspired in us!”","“But then, Signor Meis, what if our lamp were lacking the holy oil that fed the poet's? Many people still go to the churches to find the proper fuel for their little lanterns. Most of them are poor old people, poor women to whom life has lied, and they go forward in the darkness of our existence with their feelings glowing like votive lights, which they carefully protect against the cold breath of the last disillusionments, so that the flame will keep burning at least so far, at least to the fatal brink. They hurry towards it, their eyes on the flame, thinking always: ‘God sees me!' so as not to hear the din of life around them, which rings in their ears like a string of blasphemous curses. ‘God sees me . . .' Because they see him, not only in himself, but in everything, even in their poverty, in their sufferings, which will be rewarded at the end. “The faint, but steady light of those lanterns makes some of us envious and upset. But others feel that, Jove-like, they are armed with thunderbolts tamed by science, and they carry electric light bulbs triumphantly, instead of those little lanterns, which inspire only contemptuous pity. Now I ask you this, Signor Meis: All this darkness, this enormous mystery about which philosophers at first speculated in vain and which even science doesn’t deny, though now it rejects investigation of it—suppose this darkness were simply a deceit like another, a trick of our mind, a fantasy which isn’t colored? Suppose we finally convinced ourselves that all this mystery doesn’t exist outside us, but only within us? That it’s a necessity, since we have our famous privilege of feeling life, our lantern in other words, as I’ve been saying? What if death, in short, which frightens us so much, didn’t exist and were only —not the extinction of life—but the gust of air that blows out our lantern, our unhappy sense of living, a fearsome, painful sentiment, because it is limited, defined by that fictitious shadow beyond the brief circle of weak light that we poor, lost fireflies cast around us, where our life is trapped, as if excluded for a while from the universal, eternal life to which we think we should one day return, though in reality we are already there and will stay there forever, but without the sense of exile that torments us? The boundary is an illusion, relative only to our poor light, our individuality: in the reality of nature it doesn’t exist. I don’t know if you’ll like the idea or not, but we have always lived and always will live with the universe. Even now, in our present form, we share in all the manifestations of the universe, but we don’t know it, we don’t see it, because, alas, this miserable light shows us only the little zone that it can reach . . . And even then, if it only showed us things as they are. But no, my dear sir! It colors things in its own way, and it shows us things that make us lament, though perhaps in another form of existence, we would laugh heartily over them, if we had mouths. Yes, Signor Meis, we would laugh at all the vain, stupid afflictions our lantern has caused us, at all the shadows, the strange, ambitious phantoms it cast before us, and at how we feared them!”"

"Non so che cosa borbottasse tra sé la vecchia per le scale.

"Le anime hanno un loro particolar modo d'intendersi, d'entrare in intimità, fino a darsi del tu, mentre le nostre persone sono tuttavia impacciate nel commercio delle parole comuni, nella schiavitù delle esigenze sociali. Han bisogni lor proprii e loro proprie aspirazioni le anime, di cui il corpo non si dà per inteso, quando veda l'impossibilità di soddisfarli e di tradurle in atto. E ogni qualvolta due che comunichino fra loro così, con le anime soltanto, si trovano soli in qualche luogo, provano un turbamento angoscioso e quasi una repulsione violenta d'ogni minimo contatto materiale, una sofferenza che li allontana, e che cessa subito, non appena un terzo intervenga. Allora, passata l'angoscia, le due anime sollevate si ricercano e tornano a sorridersi da lontano.","Souls have their own particular way of understanding each other, of entering into intimacy, to the point of calling themselves you, while our people are nevertheless embarrassed in the trade of common words, in the slavery of social needs. Souls have their own needs and their own aspirations, of which the body does not take it for granted, when it sees the impossibility of satisfying them and translating them into action. And whenever two who communicate with each other in this way, with souls alone, find themselves alone in some place, they feel an agonizing disturbance and almost a violent repulsion of every slightest material contact, a suffering which distances them, and which ceases immediately, does not just a third intervene. Then, once the anguish has passed, the two relieved souls search for each other and return to smile at each other from afar.","Our souls can communicate in their own particular way, enter into a kind of familiarity, indeed intimacy, whilst our outward persons remain entangled in the business of everyday exchanges, enslaved by social requirements. Our souls have their own needs and their own aspirations, but these are not necessarily taken into account by the body when it recognises that it is impossible to satisfy them and express them in action. Every time two people whose souls communicate in this way find themselves alone together somewhere, they suffer anguish and unease, almost a violent sense of rejection of every kind of material contact, a pain which distances the one from the other, but which ceases as soon as a third person intervenes. Then, when the suffering is past, the two souls, relieved, seek each other out again and smile at one another from afar as before.","Our spirits have their own private way of understanding one another, of becoming intimate, while our external persons are still trapped in the commerce of ordinary words, in the slavery of social rules. Souls have their own needs and their own ambitions, which the body ignores when it sees that it's impossible to satisfy them or achieve them. And every now and then when two people communicate only with their souls, if they are suddenly alone somewhere, they are full of anguish and feel almost a violent repulsion at the thought of the slightest physical contact, an uneasiness that drives them apart, but ceases immediately when a third person appears. Then, the anguish past, the two souls seek each other again with relief and again exchange smiles at a distance."

"Ricominciò allora per Minerva il supplizio. Ma a un supplizio ben più crudele fu sottoposto il suo carnefice: Pepita, per punirlo del ritardo, prese a sfoggiar con me tanta civetteria, che mi parve anche troppa per lo scopo a cui tendevo. Volgendo di sfuggita qualche sguardo ad Adriana, m'accorgevo di quant'ella soffrisse. Il supplizio non era dunque soltanto per il Bernaldez e per Minerva; era anche per lei e per me. Mi sentivo il volto in fiamme, come se man mano mi ubriacasse il dispetto che sapevo di cagionare a quel povero giovane, il quale tuttavia non m'ispirava pietà: pietà, lì dentro, m'ispirava soltanto Adriana; e, poiché io dovevo farla soffrire, non m'importava che soffrisse anche lui della stessa pena: anzi quanto più lui ne soffriva, tanto meno mi pareva che dovesse soffrirne Adriana. A poco a poco, la violenza che ciascuno di noi faceva a se stesso crebbe e si tese fino a tal punto, che per forza doveva in qualche modo scoppiare.","Then the torture began again for Minerva. But his executioner was subjected to a much more cruel torture: Pepita, to punish him for being late, began to show off so much coquetry with me, which seemed to me even too much for the purpose I was aiming for. Turning a few glances at Adriana, I realized how much she was suffering. The torture was therefore not only for Bernaldez and Minerva; it was also for her and for me. My face was on fire, as if the spite I knew I was causing to that poor young man was gradually getting drunk, who nevertheless inspired me no pity: pity, in there, inspired me only Adriana; and, since I had to make her suffer, I didn't care that he too suffered the same pain: on the contrary, the more he suffered from it, the less it seemed to me that Adriana should suffer. Gradually, the violence that each of us did to ourselves grew and stretched to such an extent that it had to break out somehow.","Minerva’s torture started all over again. But her torturer was subjected to an even crueller torment: in order to punish him for his late arrival. Pepita started to flirt with me, rather more than even I had intended. When I occasionally glanced at Adriana, I realised how much she was suffering. The torture was therefore being suffered by Bernaldez and Minerva, but was also agony for me and Adriana. I felt my face burning as if I were gradually being intoxicated by the pain I was causing that poor young man, who barely inspired my pity, actually. Only Adriana inspired my pity. Since I had to make her suffer, it did not matter to me that he suffered the same pain; indeed I felt the more he suffered, the less Adriana would suffer. Gradually, the violence each of us was doing to ourselves reached such a peak of tension that there had to be some kind of explosion.","For Minerva, the torture began again. But her torturer himself was subjected to worse torment: Pepita, to punish him for his lateness, took to flirting with me so openly that she was going too far even for my own purposes. Glancing secretly at Adriana from time to time, I saw how much she was suffering. So not only Bernaldez and Minerva were being tortured; so were Adriana and I. I felt my face aflame, as if I were gradually becoming drunk with the knowledge of the displeasure I caused that poor young man, though he inspired no pity in me. My pity, in that room, was all for Adriana. And since I had to make her suffer, I didn't care whether he, too, suffered with the same pain. In fact, the more he suffered, the less it seemed to me that Adriana should suffer. Little by little, the violence that each of us was doing to himself increased and became so taut that it had to explode somehow."

Ma non mi bastavano più, quelle cure; m'irritavano anzi, come se mi fossero usate per dispetto. Sicuro! Perché indovinavo da chi mi venivano. Adriana mi dimostrava per mezzo di esse, ch'ella era col pensiero quasi tutto il giorno Lì con me, in camera mia; e grazie della consolazione! Che mi valeva, se io intanto, col mio, la inseguivo di qua e di là per casa, tutto il giorno, smaniando?

What good was it to me if my thoughts meanwhile followed her here and there about the house, all day, languishing.

"Santa donna, mia madre! D'indole schiva e placidissima, aveva così scarsa esperienza della vita e degli uomini! A sentirla parlare, pareva una bambina.

Gracilissima di complessione, fu, dopo la morte di mio padre, sempre malferma in salute; ma non si lagnò mai de' suoi mali, né credo se ne infastidisse neppure con se stessa, accettandoli, rassegnata, come una conseguenza naturale della sua sciagura.

She spoke with a nasal accent and she even laughed through her nose, because she pursed her lips when she laughed, as if she were ashamed. Frail by nature, after my father's death she was always in poor health, but she never complained of her suffering and I believe that she never thought about it, accepting it with resignation as a natural consequence of her loss. Perhaps she had expected to die of grief, and therefore she had to thank God for keeping her alive, even in pain, for the sake of her children."

After retiring to my room, I had idly begun to read one of Signor Anselmo's favorite books, Reincarnation. At a certain point I thought I heard voices on the terrace; I listened more carefully, in case it was Adriana. No. Two people were talking in low, tense voices; I heard a man, but it wasn't Signor Paleari. Still he and I were the only men in the house. My curiosity aroused, I went to the window to look through the blinds. In the darkness I thought I could make out Signorina Caporale. But who was the man talking with her? Had Te-renzio Papiano arrived unexpectedly from Naples?"
Ecco quanto si leggeva nel Corriere della Sera del 27 marzo 1920:,Here is what was read in the Corriere della Sera of 27 March 1920:,"Here is an article from the Corriere della Sera of the 27th March, 1920:","The following article was to be read in the Corriere della Sera on March 27, 1920:"
"Vivevo, per altro, con me e di me, quasi esclusivamente. Scambiavo appena qualche parola con gli albergatori, coi camerieri, coi vicini di tavola, ma non mai per voglia d'attaccar discorso. Dal ritegno anzi che ne provavo, mi accorsi ch'io non avevo affatto il gusto della menzogna. Del resto, anche gli altri mostravan poca voglia di parlare con me: forse a causa del mio aspetto, mi prendevano per uno straniero. Ricordo che, visitando Venezia, non ci fu verso di levar dal capo a un vecchio gondoliere ch'io fossi tedesco, austriaco. Ero nato, sì, nell'Argentina ma da genitori italiani. La mia vera, diciamo così «estraneità» era ben altra e la conoscevo io solo: non ero più niente io; nessuno stato civile mi registrava, tranne quello di Miragno, ma come morto, con l'altro nome.","On the other hand, I lived with me and with me, almost exclusively. I barely exchanged a few words with the hoteliers, with the waiters, with the neighbors at the table, but never out of desire to talk. Indeed, from the restraint I felt about it, I realized that I had no taste for lies. Moreover, the others also showed little desire to talk to me: perhaps because of my appearance, they took me for a foreigner. I remember that, while visiting Venice, there was no way of raising an old gondolier from the head that I was German, Austrian. I was born, yes, in Argentina but of Italian parents. My true, let's say ""extraneousness"" was quite different and I only knew it: I was no longer anything; no marital status registered me, except that of Miragno, but as dead, with the other name.","I lived by myself and almost exclusively for myself. I occasionally exchanged the odd word with hotelkeepers, waiters and people at neighbouring tables, but never with the intention of starting a conversation. In fact, I felt so reluctant to do so, that I realised I really did not have a taste for lying. In any case, other people showed precious little inclination to speak to me: perhaps my looks made them think I was a foreigner. I remember when I visited Venice, there was no way I could convince the gondolier that I was not German or Austrian. I was born in Argentina, true, but my parents were Italian. My real “foreignness” lay in something quite different, whose secret only I knew. I was nothing now. No official state recognised me, except Miragno, where they had registered me as dead under another name.","For that matter, I was living with myself and by myself almost exclusively. I occasionally exchanged a few words with hotel clerks, with waiters or fellow guests, but never out of any desire to strike up a conversation. Indeed, my reluctance made me realize that I had no taste for lying. In any case, the others also showed little or no desire to talk to me, perhaps because of my appearance: they took me for a foreigner. I remember when I was visiting Venice I couldn't convince an old gondolier that I wasn't a German or an Austrian. I had been born, true enough, in Argentina, but of Italian parents. My real “foreign-ness”, if you want to call it that, was of another kind, and I was the only one who knew it. I was no longer anything; no official records registered me, except the one in Miragno, but then as a dead man and under another name."
