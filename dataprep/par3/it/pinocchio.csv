Its population was composed entirely of children. The oldest were fourteen years of age; the youngest were barely eight. In the streets, such joy, such racket, such screeching as might take the top of your head off! Hordes of rascals everywhere. Some were playing ball, some marbles, some bowls; some were riding bicycles, others wooden horses; some were playing blindman’s buff, some tag; some, dressed as clowns, were eating fire; some were acting, some singing, some doing flips; some amused themselves by walking with their hands on the ground and their feet in the air; some rolled hoops; some strolled about dressed as generals, with newspaper helmets and papier-mâché swords; some laughed, some yelled, some called to friends; some clapped and some whistled and some clucked like hens that had just laid eggs—such a pandemonium, in other words, such a din, such an infernal hullabaloo, that you’d have to stuff your ears with cotton to keep from going deaf. Every square hosted little canvas theaters that were packed with kids from dawn till dusk, and the walls of every house bore phrases scrawled in charcoal that said splendid things like: Toys are grate! (instead of great), No more skools! (instead of schools), Down with Ritt Matick! (instead of arithmetic), and other such gems.","It was a country unlike any other country in the world. The population was composed entirely of boys. The oldest were fourteen, and the youngest scarcely eight years old. In the streets there was such merriment, noise, and shouting, that it was enough to turn anybody's head. There were troops of boys everywhere. Some were playing with nuts, some with battledores, some with balls. Some rode velocipedes, others wooden horses. A party were playing at hide and seek, a few were chasing each other. Boys dressed in straw were eating lighted tow; some were reciting, some singing, some leaping. Some were amusing themselves with walking on their hands with their feet in the air; others were trundling hoops, or strutting about dressed as generals, wearing leaf helmets and commanding a squadron of cardboard soldiers. Some were laughing, some shouting, some were calling out; others clapped their hands, or whistled, or clucked like a hen who has just laid an egg. To sum it all up, it was such a pandemonium, such a bedlam, such an uproar, that not to be deafened it would have been necessary to stuff one's ears with cotton wool. In every square, canvas theatres had been erected, and they were crowded with boys from morning till evening. On the walls of the houses there were inscriptions written in charcoal: "" Long live playthings, we will have no more schools: down with arithmetic:"" and similar other fine sentiments all in bad spelling."
