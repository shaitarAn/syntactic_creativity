Ｋに対する私の良心が復活したのは、私が宅の格子こうしを開けて、玄関から坐敷ざしきへ通る時、すなわち例のごとく彼の室へやを抜けようとした瞬間でした。彼はいつもの通り机に向って書見をしていました。彼はいつもの通り書物から眼を放して、私を見ました。しかし彼はいつもの通り今帰ったのかとはいいませんでした。彼は「病気はもう癒いいのか、医者へでも行ったのか」と聞きました。私はその刹那せつなに、彼の前に手を突いて、詫あやまりたくなったのです。しかも私の受けたその時の衝動は決して弱いものではなかったのです。もしＫと私がたった二人曠野こうやの真中にでも立っていたならば、私はきっと良心の命令に従って、その場で彼に謝罪したろうと思います。しかし奥には人がいます。私の自然はすぐそこで食い留められてしまったのです。そうして悲しい事に永久に復活しなかったのです。,"My conscience for K was revived when I opened the grid of my house and passed from the front door to Zashiki-warashi, as usual, when I tried to get out of his room. He was writing at his desk as usual. He took his eyes off the book as usual and looked at me. But he didn't say he was back now as usual. He asked, ""Is the illness healed or did I go to the doctor?"" In that moment, I poke my hand in front of him and wanted to apologize. Moreover, the urge I received at that time was not weak at all. If K and I were standing in the middle of only two people, Koya Hishino, I would probably apologize to him on the spot, following the orders of our conscience. However, there is a person in the back. My nature was stopped right there. And sadly, it didn't come back forever.","My conscience sprang to life again the moment I opened the lattice door at the entrance and stepped into the house, to follow my usual course through K’s room into mine. He was, as always, seated at his desk reading. As always, he raised his eyes from the book and looked at me. But he did not say the habitual words, “Just back, are you?” Instead he said, “Are you better now? Have you been to the doctor?” In that instant I had the urge to kneel before him and ask his pardon. Nor was this some mere feeble impulse. I believe that if K and I had been standing in the wilderness together just then, I would have followed the dictates of my conscience and begged his forgiveness. But there were others in the house. My natural instinct was quickly curbed. And to my sorrow, it never returned.","I returned to the house. As usual, I went into K’s room in order to get to mine. It was then that I felt guilty for the first time. He was of course at his desk, reading. And as always, he looked up at me. But this time, he did not give me his customary greeting—“Did you just get back?” Instead, he said: “Are you feeling better now? Have you seen the doctor?” Suddenly, I wanted to kneel before him and beg his forgiveness. It was a violent emotion that I felt then. I think that had K and I been alone in some wilderness , I would have listened to the cry of my conscience. But there were others in the house. I soon overcame the impulse of my natural self to be true to K. I only wish I had been given another such opportunity to ask K’s forgiveness."
先生は少し風邪かぜの気味で、座敷へ出るのが臆劫おっくうだといって、私をその書斎に通した。書斎の硝子戸ガラスどから冬に入いって稀まれに見るような懐かしい和やわらかな日光が机掛つくえかけの上に射さしていた。先生はこの日あたりの好いい室へやの中へ大きな火鉢を置いて、五徳ごとくの上に懸けた金盥かなだらいから立ち上あがる湯気ゆげで、呼吸いきの苦しくなるのを防いでいた。,"The teacher had a slight cold and said that going out to the tatami room was awkward, so he sent me to the study. From the glass doors of the study, the nostalgic and soft sunlight that you rarely see in winter was shining on the desk. The teacher placed a large brazier in a nice room on this day, and the steam rising from the gold basin hanging on the trivet prevented him from having difficulty breathing. ..","Sensei was suffering from a slight cold. He did not feel inclined to come to the living room, so he asked me into his study. Soft sunlight, of a kind rarely seen in winter, was shining through the study’s glass door onto the cloth draped over his desk. In this sunny room Sensei had set a metal basin containing water over the coals of a brazier, so that by inhaling the steam, he could soothe his lungs.","Sensei was suffering from a cold. As he did not wish to come out into the sitting room, I was asked to see him in his study. Soft sunlight, such as we had rarely seen that winter, filled the study. Into this sunny room, Sensei had brought a large brazier. A metal basin, filled with water, had been placed on it, so that the steam rising from it might ease Sensei’s breathing."
「それっ切りしかいえないのよ。けれどもその事があってから後のちなんです。先生の性質が段々変って来たのは。なぜその方が死んだのか、私には解らないの。先生にもおそらく解っていないでしょう。けれどもそれから先生が変って来たと思えば、そう思われない事もないのよ」,"""I can only say that. But after that happened. The nature of the teacher changed gradually. I don't understand why he died. Teacher. You probably don't know, but if you think the teacher has changed since then, it doesn't seem like that. ""","“This is as much as I can say. But that’s when it began. After that Sensei’s personality slowly changed. I don’t know why his friend died, and I don’t think Sensei does either. But seeing how he began to change afterward, somehow I can’t help feeling that perhaps he may have known something after all.”","“I can’t tell you any more about it. At any rate, it was after this friend’s death that Sensei began to change gradually. I don’t know why he died. I doubt that Sensei does either. On the other hand, when one remembers that the change came after the death, one wonders if Sensei really doesn’t know.”"
私は一言いちごんもなかった。詫あやまる以上に恐縮して俯向うつむいていた。父は平気なうちに自分の死を覚悟していたものとみえる。しかも私の卒業する前に死ぬだろうと思い定めていたとみえる。その卒業が父の心にどのくらい響くかも考えずにいた私は全く愚おろかものであった。私は鞄かばんの中から卒業証書を取り出して、それを大事そうに父と母に見せた。証書は何かに圧おし潰つぶされて、元の形を失っていた。父はそれを鄭寧ていねいに伸のした。,"I didn't have a word. I was more afraid than I apologized, and I was looking down. It seems that my father was prepared for his death while he was calm. Moreover, it seems that he had decided that he would die before I graduated. I was totally stupid without thinking about how much the graduation would affect my father's heart. I took the diploma out of my bag and showed it to my father and mother with great care. The certificate was crushed by something and lost its original shape. My father carefully extended it.","Speechless, I hung my head, overwhelmed by shame that no apology could express. I saw that my father had calmly been preparing to die and had decided it would probably happen before my graduation. I had been a complete fool not to think of how my graduation would make him feel. I took the diploma from my bag and spread it out carefully for my parents to see. Something had crushed it, and it was no longer quite the shape it had been. My father smoothed it tenderly.","I said nothing. No word of apology would have expressed how I felt. I hung my head in deep shame. Calmly, he had been waiting for his death, believing that he would die before my graduation. And I had been too stupid to realize how much it meant to my father to be alive when I graduated. I brought out my diploma from my bag, and carefully showed it to my father and mother. I had not packed it well, and it was badly creased. “You should have rolled it, and carried it in your hand,” said my father."
「よくころりと死ぬ人があるじゃありませんか。自然に。それからあっと思う間まに死ぬ人もあるでしょう。不自然な暴力で」,"""Some people die often. Naturally. Then, some people die in a blink of an eye. With unnatural violence.""","“You often hear of people keeling over and dying, don’t you? Of natural causes. And then other people die suddenly, from some unnatural act of violence.” “What’s an unnatural act of violence?”","“Surely, there are many men who die suddenly, yet quietly, from natural causes. And then there are those whose sudden, shocking deaths are brought about by unnatural violence.” “What do you mean by unnatural violence?”"
私はこの前帰った時、無理に床とこを上げさして、髭ひげを剃そった父の様子と態度とを思い出した。「もう大丈夫、お母さんがあんまり仰山ぎょうさん過ぎるからいけないんだ」といったその時の言葉を考えてみると、満更まんざら母ばかり責める気にもなれなかった。「しかし傍はたでも少しは注意しなくっちゃ」といおうとした私は、とうとう遠慮して何にも口へ出さなかった。ただ父の病やまいの性質について、私の知る限りを教えるように話して聞かせた。しかしその大部分は先生と先生の奥さんから得た材料に過ぎなかった。母は別に感動した様子も見せなかった。ただ「へえ、やっぱり同おんなじ病気でね。お気の毒だね。いくつでお亡くなりかえ、その方かたは」などと聞いた。,"When I got home the other day, I forcibly raised the floor and remembered the appearance and attitude of my father who shaved his beard. When I thought about the words at that time, such as ""It's okay, my mother is too much for me,"" I didn't feel like blaming my mother. ""But I have to be a little careful by my side,"" I finally refrained from saying anything. I just told him to teach me as far as I know about the nature of my father's illness and illness. But most of it was just the material I got from the teacher and his wife. My mother didn't seem to be impressed. However, I heard, ""Hey, I'm still sick. I'm sorry. How many people have died?""","I recalled the way my father had looked and acted on my previous visit, when he had made such an effort to be out of bed and shaved. Your mother shouldn’t go exaggerating things, he had said, but I couldn’t entirely blame her. I was about to suggest that she should at least keep an eye on him but thought better of it. I just told her everything I knew about his disease, although most of it was only what I had learned from Sensei and his wife. My mother did not seem particularly affected as she listened. She merely remarked, “Well, well, the same illness, eh? Poor thing. What age was she when she died?”","I remembered how, the last time I had come home, my father had insisted on leaving his bed. “I am all right now,” he had said, after a shave. “Your mother fusses too much.” And remembering that occasion, I thought that my mother was not entirely to blame. I had been on the verge of saying, “But you should take his illness more seriously, even if he doesn’t,” but decided to say nothing after all. It would be unjust, I thought, to chide her. Instead, I told her all I knew about my father’s disease. Of course, I knew little more than what Sensei and his wife had told me. My mother seemed not particularly impressed or interested. She made only such remarks as: “Is that so? The lady died of the same disease? That’s too bad. And how old was she, when she died?”"
「ありがとう。脂やにがこびり着いてやしませんか」,"""Thank you. Would you like to get fat and greasy?""",“Thank you. Is any resin stuck there?”,"“Thank you. You don’t see any resin marks, do you?”"
「古本屋に売るさ」,"""Sell to second-hand bookstores""",“Sell them to a secondhand dealer.”,“You can sell them to some secondhand bookshop.”
父は病気の性質として、運動を慎まなければならないので、床を上げてからも、ほとんど戸外そとへは出なかった。一度天気のごく穏やかな日の午後庭へ下りた事があるが、その時は万一を気遣きづかって、私が引き添うように傍そばに付いていた。私が心配して自分の肩へ手を掛けさせようとしても、父は笑って応じなかった。,"Due to the nature of his illness, he had to refrain from exercising, so even after raising the floor, he hardly went out to the open air. I once went down to the garden in the afternoon on a very calm day, but at that time I was careful and I was by my side to accompany me. When I was worried and tried to put my hand on my shoulder, my dad laughed and refused.","My father’s illness prevented him from being very active, even once he was up and about, and he seldom went outdoors. One unusually balmy day when he did venture out into the garden, I accompanied him just as a precaution. I offered my shoulder for him to lean on, but he brushed it off with a laugh.","My father, not being allowed to be very active, hardly ever left the house after he got up. Once, on a rather sunny day, he stepped out into the garden. I was worried, and kept close to his side. And when I tried to persuade him to lean on my shoulder, he laughed, and would not listen to me."
「先生はなぜ元のように書物に興味をもち得ないんですか」,"""Why can't the teacher be as interested in books as he was?""","My thesis momentarily forgotten, I spontaneously asked, “Why aren’t you as interested in books as you used to be, Sensei?”","“Why is it, Sensei, that you are not as interested in books as you once were?”"
兄は私の弁解を黙って聞いていた。やがて、「よく解わかるのかな」といった。兄は父の理解力が病気のために、平生よりはよっぽど鈍にぶっているように観察したらしい。,"My brother was silently listening to my excuse. Eventually, he said, ""I wonder if you can understand it well."" My brother seems to have observed that his father's comprehension was much slower than normal because of his illness.","My brother listened in silence to my justifications, then asked, “How well does he understand it, I wonder?” He had apparently concluded that my father’s illness had affected his grasp of things.",He insists on being allowed to see it” My brother listened to my excuses in silence. Then he said: “I wonder if he understands what he is reading?” He seemed to have decided that my father’s mind had been considerably dulled by his illness.
「私は私自身さえ信用していないのです。つまり自分で自分が信用できないから、人も信用できないようになっているのです。自分を呪のろうより外ほかに仕方がないのです」,"""I don't even trust myself, that is, I can't trust myself because I can't trust myself. I can't help but curse myself.""",“I don’t even trust myself. It’s because I can’t trust myself that I can’t trust others. I can only curse myself for it.”,"“I don’t even trust myself. And not trusting myself, I can hardly trust others. There is nothing that I can do, except curse my own soul.”"
「Ｋの生返事なまへんじは翌日よくじつになっても、その翌日になっても、彼の態度によく現われていました。彼は自分から進んで例の問題に触れようとする気色けしきを決して見せませんでした。もっとも機会もなかったのです。奥さんとお嬢さんが揃そろって一日宅うちを空あけでもしなければ、二人はゆっくり落ち付いて、そういう事を話し合う訳にも行かないのですから。私わたくしはそれをよく心得ていました。心得ていながら、変にいらいらし出すのです。その結果始めは向うから来るのを待つつもりで、暗あんに用意をしていた私が、折があったらこっちで口を切ろうと決心するようになったのです。,"""K's live reply, Nittaku, was often reflected in his attitude, whether it was the next day or the next day. He was willing to touch on the problem. I never showed it. I didn't have the chance. If my wife and daughter didn't open the house for a day, they would calm down slowly and wouldn't be able to discuss such things. That's why. I knew it well. I knew it, but it was weirdly annoying. As a result, I was preparing for it in the dark, waiting for it to come from the other side. I decided to cut my mouth here when there was a break.","K’s evasive response was unmistakably echoed in his attitude the next day and the day after. He showed not the least inclination to broach the subject at issue between us. Granted, he had no opportunity to do so. We could not take our time and discuss things calmly unless both Okusan and Ojōsan had left the house for the day. I knew this perfectly well. Yet it still riled me. I had prepared myself in wait for K to make the next move, but now I changed my mind and decided that I would be the one to speak first if a chance presented itself.","K’s attitude remained noncommittal all through the following day, and the day after that. He showed absolutely no sign of wanting to talk to me again about Ojosan. True, we were given no opportunity to have such a talk. So long as Okusan and Ojosan were in the house, we could not very well have a long conversation of so involved and private a nature without interruption. I was quite aware of this. Nevertheless, I was irritated. Having prepared myself for another talk with K, I was in no mood for protracted silence. I decided finally to bring up the subject myself, rather than wait for him to do so, at the earliest opportunity."
眼鏡めがねを掛けて新聞を見ていた父はこういった。父は黙って自分の病気の事も考えているらしかった。私はついこの間の卒業式に例年の通り大学へ行幸ぎょうこうになった陛下を憶おもい出したりした。,"My father, who was looking at the newspaper with his glasses on, said this. My father seemed to be silently thinking about his illness. At the graduation ceremony the other day, I remembered His Majesty who was going to college as usual.","So said my father as he sat, bespectacled, reading the newspaper. He seemed to be silently thinking also of his own illness. For my part, I recalled the sight of the emperor when he had so recently come to the university, as was the custom, for our graduation ceremony.","“I think that we had better cancel the dinner,” said my father when he read the news, looking at me over the top of his spectacles. He then became silent, and it seemed to me that he was thinking of his own illness. I sat quietly too, thinking of the Emperor who had so recently attended the graduation ceremony at the university, as he was wont to do every year."
たしか十月の中頃と思います。私は寝坊ねぼうをした結果、日本服にほんふくのまま急いで学校へ出た事があります。穿物はきものも編上あみあげなどを結んでいる時間が惜しいので、草履ぞうりを突っかけたなり飛び出したのです。その日は時間割からいうと、Ｋよりも私の方が先へ帰るはずになっていました。私は戻って来ると、そのつもりで玄関の格子こうしをがらりと開けたのです。するといないと思っていたＫの声がひょいと聞こえました。同時にお嬢さんの笑い声が私の耳に響きました。私はいつものように手数てかずのかかる靴を穿はいていないから、すぐ玄関に上がって仕切しきりの襖ふすまを開けました。私は例の通り机の前に坐すわっているＫを見ました。しかしお嬢さんはもうそこにはいなかったのです。私はあたかもＫの室へやから逃のがれ出るように去るその後姿うしろすがたをちらりと認めただけでした。私はＫにどうして早く帰ったのかと問いました。Ｋは心持が悪いから休んだのだと答えました。私が自分の室にはいってそのまま坐っていると、間もなくお嬢さんが茶を持って来てくれました。その時お嬢さんは始めてお帰りといって私に挨拶あいさつをしました。私は笑いながらさっきはなぜ逃げたんですと聞けるような捌さばけた男ではありません。それでいて腹の中では何だかその事が気にかかるような人間だったのです。お嬢さんはすぐ座を立って縁側伝えんがわづたいに向うへ行ってしまいました。しかしＫの室の前に立ち留まって、二言ふたこと三言みこと内と外とで話をしていました。それは先刻さっきの続きらしかったのですが、前を聞かない私にはまるで解りませんでした。,"I think it's mid-October. As a result of oversleeping, I rushed to school with my Japanese clothes on. I didn't have much time to tie the kimono and the kimono, so I jumped out as soon as I struck the sandals. In terms of the timetable, I was supposed to go home earlier than K on that day. When I came back, I opened the grid of the front door with that intention. I could hear K's voice, which I thought wasn't there. At the same time, the laughter of the young lady echoed in my ears. I didn't wear the tedious shoes as usual, so I immediately went up to the front door and opened the fusuma bran. I saw K sitting in front of the desk as usual. But the lady wasn't there anymore. I just glanced at the back of my appearance after leaving as if to escape from K's room. I asked K why he returned early. K replied that he was absent because he felt unwell. As I entered my room and sat down, the young lady soon brought me some tea. At that time, the young lady said hello to me for the first time on her way home. I'm not the kind of man who laughs and asks why he ran away. Still, he was a person who was worried about that in his stomach. The young lady immediately stood up and went to the porch. However, I stayed in front of K's room and talked with two words and three words inside and outside. It seemed like a continuation of the previous one, but I couldn't understand it without asking.","It would have been the middle of October. I had overslept and rushed off to classes without changing out of the Japanese clothing I wore around the house; rather than waste time with laced shoes, I hastily slipped on a pair of straw sandals. Our schedules meant that I would get back home before K did. When I arrived, I flung open the lattice door, assuming he wouldn’t be there—and caught the sound of his voice within. I also heard Ojōsan’s laughter. Not needing to spend time unlacing my shoes at the door as usual, I stepped straight out of my sandals and into the house and opened the sliding doors to our rooms. My eyes took in the sight of K, seated as usual at his desk. Ojōsan, however, was no longer in the room. All I caught was a glimpse of her retreating form, obviously making a hasty exit. I asked K why he had returned early. He had stayed home that day because he felt unwell, he replied. No sooner was I back in my room and seated than Ojōsan appeared with tea, and now at last she greeted me. I was not the sort of person who could ask with an easy laugh why she had run away just then; instead, the matter nagged at my mind. She stood up and went off down the veranda, but she paused a moment before K’s room and exchanged a few words with him. They seemed to be a continuation of their previous talk, but as I had not heard what had gone before, I could make no sense of them.","It so happened that one morning—it was about the middle of October, I think—I overslept, and having no time to put on my uniform, I rushed off in Japanese dress. And instead of the usual lace-up boots, I wore my sandals. Normally, on that day of the week, my lectures ended earlier than K’s, and so I went home assuming that K would not yet be back. When I opened the front door, however, I heard K’s voice. And then the sound of Ojosan’s laughter reached my ears. Since I was wearing sandals that day, and not those boots which took so long to unlace, I was very soon in K’s room. I found K sitting at his desk as usual. But Ojosan was no longer there. I had opened the door just in time to catch a glimpse of her fleeing figure. I asked K why he was back so early. He had not been feeling very well, he said, and so had decided to stay at home. I went to my room and sat down. A few minutes later, Ojosan came in with a cup of tea. “Welcome home,” she said. I was too awkward a fellow to smile at her and make some such comment as, “Well, why did you run away from me just now?” And of course, I was not the sort to make light of such an incident. She stayed with me for only a moment or two. She then got up, and left my room by the verandah. She stopped outside K’s room, and exchanged a few words with him. They were, I gathered, continuing the conversation that my return had interrupted. Not having heard the earlier part of it, I could not guess what it was all about."
奥さんは火鉢の灰を搔かき馴ならした。それから水注みずさしの水を鉄瓶てつびんに注さした。鉄瓶は忽たちまち鳴りを沈めた。,His wife used the ashes of the brazier to get used to it. Then I poured the water from the water-dropper into the iron kettle. The iron kettle immediately sank.,"She took up the fire tongs and sat smoothing the ash in the brazier. Then she poured water from the jug into the iron kettle, immediately quieting its singing.","Believe you me, Sensei knows.” She leveled off the cinders in the brazier and poured more water from a jug into the iron kettle. The kettle stopped singing."
帰る時、奥さんは「どうもお気の毒さま」と会釈した。その調子は忙しいところを暇を潰つぶさせて気の毒だというよりも、せっかく来たのに泥棒がはいらなくって気の毒だという冗談のように聞こえた。奥さんはそういいながら、先刻さっき出した西洋菓子の残りを、紙に包んで私の手に持たせた。私はそれを袂たもとへ入れて、人通りの少ない夜寒よさむの小路こうじを曲折して賑にぎやかな町の方へ急いだ。,"On his way home, his wife said, ""I'm sorry."" It sounded more like a joke that I'm sorry that I didn't need a thief when I came here, rather than feeling sorry for killing my busy time. His wife said so, but he wrapped the rest of the Western confectionery that he had just put out in paper and held it in my hand. I put it in the jiuqu and hurried to the bustling town by turning around the low-traffic night cold Yosam no Koji.","“I do apologize,” his wife said to me as I was leaving. Her tone made me feel this was less an apology for taking up my precious time than an almost humorous regret for the fact that there had been no burglar. She wrapped the cakes she had brought out with the tea and handed them to me. Slipping the package into my kimono sleeve, I set off, winding hurriedly through the chilly, largely unpeopled lanes toward the bright and lively town.","“Sorry to have caused you so much inconvenience,” said Sensei’s wife, as I was about to leave. She seemed not to be apologizing for having taken up so much of a busy student’s time, but rather to be apologizing, in a joking fashion, for the fact that the burglar did not appear. She then gave me the rest of the cakes, wrapped in a piece of paper, to take home. I put them in my pocket, and went out into the cold night. I hurried along the winding and almost deserted alleys towards the busier streets."
学問をした結果兄は今遠国えんごくにいた。教育を受けた因果で、私わたくしはまた東京に住む覚悟を固くした。こういう子を育てた父の愚痴ぐちはもとより不合理ではなかった。永年住み古した田舎家いなかやの中に、たった一人取り残されそうな母を描えがき出す父の想像はもとより淋さびしいに違いなかった。,"As a result of my studies, my brother was now in a remote country. Due to the consequences of being educated, I was determined to live in Tokyo again. It wasn't unreasonable, let alone the bitterness of my father who raised such a child. It must have been lonely, not to mention the imagination of his father, who drew a picture of his mother who was likely to be left alone in the countryside where he lived for many years.","Thanks to my brother’s education, he was living far away, and my own education had resulted in my decision to live in Tokyo. My father’s grumblings were perfectly understandable. He must certainly have been feeling forlorn at the thought of my mother left all alone in this big old country house they’d lived in so long together.","Indeed, it was because my elder brother had received a university education that he had gone away to a distant province. I too, because of my education, had resolved to live in Tokyo. It was not unreasonable, then, that my father should complain about his children. No doubt, it was very sad for him to imagine my mother left all alone in the country house where he had lived for so many years."
十,Ten,CHAPTER 10,"How he suffered, my imagination then could not conceive."
私は一層いっそ思い切って、ありのままを妻に打ち明けようとした事が何度もあります。しかしいざという間際になると自分以外のある力が不意に来て私を抑おさえ付けるのです。私を理解してくれるあなたの事だから、説明する必要もあるまいと思いますが、話すべき筋だから話しておきます。その時分の私は妻に対して己おのれを飾る気はまるでなかったのです。もし私が亡友に対すると同じような善良な心で、妻の前に懺悔ざんげの言葉を並べたなら、妻は嬉うれし涙をこぼしても私の罪を許してくれたに違いないのです。それをあえてしない私に利害の打算があるはずはありません。私はただ妻の記憶に暗黒な一点を印いんするに忍びなかったから打ち明けなかったのです。純白なものに一雫ひとしずくの印気インキでも容赦ようしゃなく振り掛けるのは、私にとって大変な苦痛だったのだと解釈して下さい。,"I have taken the plunge and tried to reveal myself to my wife many times. However, when it comes to an emergency, a certain force other than myself suddenly comes and suppresses me. I don't think it's necessary to explain because it's you who understands me, but I'll tell you because it's a source to talk about. At that time, I didn't feel like decorating my wife. If I had the same good heart as my dead friend and had confessed words in front of my wife, she must have forgiven my sins with joy and tears. .. If I don't dare to do that, there can be no calculation of interests. I just couldn't confess because I couldn't stand to mark a dark point in my wife's memory. Please interpret that it was a great pain for me to sprinkle a drop of ink on a pure white one without mercy.","Again and again I would decide to summon my courage and confess everything to her. But at the last minute some power not my own would always press me back. You know me well enough to need no explanation, I believe, but I will write here what must be said. I had not the slightest urge in those days to present myself to her in a false light. If I had confessed to her with the same sincerity and humility of heart with which I confessed to my dead friend, I know she would have wept tears of joy and forgiven all. So it was not sheer self-interest that kept me mute. No, I failed to confess for the simple reason that I could not bring myself to contaminate her memory of the past with the tiniest hint of darkness. It was agony for me to contemplate this pure creature sullied in any way, you understand.","Often, I was on the verge of telling her everything: but each time, at the crucial moment, I would be stopped by something that was beyond my conscious control. You know me well, and I suppose there is no need for me to explain what this was that prevented me from confessing to my wife. Nevertheless, I feel that I owe you an explanation. Please understand that I did not wish my wife to believe me better than I actually was. I am sure that if I had spoken to her with a truly repentant heart—as I did always to the spirit of my dead friend—she would have forgiven me. She would have cried, I know, from happiness. That I refused to tell her the truth was not due to selfish calculation on my part. I simply did not wish to taint her whole life with the memory of something that was ugly. I thought that it would be an unforgivable crime to let fall even the tiniest drop of ink on a pure, spotless thing."
「教えて上げるほどないからでしょう」,"""I don't think I can tell you.""",“That would be because we’re not well off enough to make it worth mentioning.”,“Perhaps he is reluctant to tell you because he hasn’t very much.”
「これでも元は財産家なんですよ、君」といい直した先生は、次に私の顔を見て微笑した。私はそれでも何とも答えなかった。むしろ不調法で答えられなかったのである。すると先生がまた問題を他よそへ移した。,"The teacher, who said, ""I'm still a wealthy man, you,"" then smiled at my face. I still didn't answer. Rather, he couldn't answer because of the illegality. Then the teacher moved the problem to another place.","“I used to be wealthy, you know,” he said again, now addressing me, then he looked at me and smiled. I continued to make no reply. In fact, I did not have the wit to know how to respond. Sensei then changed the subject.","“I was once a rich man, you know,” he said again. This time, he looked at me and smiled. Still, I remained silent. I felt awkward and I could not think of anything to say. Sensei then changed the subject."
奥さんとお嬢さんと私の関係がこうなっている所へ、もう一人男が入いり込まなければならない事になりました。その男がこの家庭の一員となった結果は、私の運命に非常な変化を来きたしています。もしその男が私の生活の行路こうろを横切らなかったならば、おそらくこういう長いものをあなたに書き残す必要も起らなかったでしょう。私は手もなく、魔の通る前に立って、その瞬間の影に一生を薄暗くされて気が付かずにいたのと同じ事です。自白すると、私は自分でその男を宅うちへ引張ひっぱって来たのです。無論奥さんの許諾きょだくも必要ですから、私は最初何もかも隠さず打ち明けて、奥さんに頼んだのです。ところが奥さんは止よせといいました。私には連れて来なければ済まない事情が充分あるのに、止せという奥さんの方には、筋の立った理屈はまるでなかったのです。だから私は私の善いいと思うところを強しいて断行してしまいました。,"Another man had to enter the place where my relationship with my wife and daughter was like this. The result of the man becoming a member of this family has brought about a great change in my destiny. If the man didn't cross the path of my life, I probably wouldn't have had to write down these long things to you. It's the same as I stood in front of the devil without my hands and was dimly lit by the shadow of that moment and went unnoticed. When I confessed, I pulled the man home by myself. Of course, my wife's permission is also required, so I first confided everything without hiding it and asked my wife. However, his wife told me to stop. There were plenty of circumstances that I had to bring, but for my wife, who wanted to stop, there was no sensible reason. That's why I forced myself to do what I thought was good.","It was at this point in the relationship among the three of us that another man entered the picture, one whose arrival in the household crucially affected my fate. If he had not crossed my path, I doubt that I would need to write this long letter to you now. It was as if I stood there oblivious as the devil brushed by me, unaware that he cast a shadow upon me that would darken my whole life. It was I who brought this man into the house, I must confess. Naturally, I needed Okusan’s consent, so I told her his story and asked if he could move in with me. She advised against it but had no convincing argument to offer. For my part, I could see every reason why I must bring him into the household, and so I persisted in following my own judgment and did what I believed was right.","The relationship between the three of us had developed thus far when another man appeared on the scene. He became a member of the household, and by doing so, changed the course of my destiny. If this man had never crossed my path, I don’t suppose there would ever have arisen the necessity for me to write this long letter to you. The devil had passed before me, so to speak, casting his shadow over me for a moment. And I did not know that his passing had darkened my life for ever. I must tell you that it was I who dragged this man into the house to live with us. Needless to say, I had first to get Okusan’s permission to do so. I told her everything about the man, and asked her if he might come and stay with me. At first she said no. But while I felt myself absolutely obliged to invite him, she seemed to have no reasonable basis for her objection. Finally, I had my way. I was able to do what I thought was right."
私はできるだけ父を慰めて、自分の机を置いてある所へ帰った。私は取り散らした書物の間に坐すわって、心細そうな父の態度と言葉とを、幾度いくたびか繰り返し眺めた。私はその時また蟬せみの声を聞いた。その声はこの間中あいだじゅう聞いたのと違って、つくつく法師ぼうしの声であった。私は夏郷里に帰って、煮え付くような蟬の声の中に凝じっと坐っていると、変に悲しい心持になる事がしばしばあった。私の哀愁はいつもこの虫の烈はげしい音ねと共に、心の底に沁しみ込むように感ぜられた。私はそんな時にはいつも動かずに、一人で一人を見詰めていた。,"I comforted my father as much as possible and went back to where my desk was. I sat between the scattered books and looked at my lonely father's attitude and words over and over again. I heard the voice of a cicada again at that time. The voice was the voice of Meimuna opalifera, unlike what I heard all the time. When I returned to Natsugosato and sat still in the simmering voice of a cicada, I often felt strangely sad. My melancholy was always felt to sank into the bottom of my heart, with the terrifying sound of this insect. At that time, I was always staring at myself without moving.","I did my best to console him and returned to my desk. Sitting among my jumble of books, I thoughtfully turned over in my mind my father’s unhappy words and what lay behind them. As I did so, I heard again the cicada’s song. This time it wasn’t a continuous shrill but the intermittent call of the cicada known as tsutsukubōshi, which sings toward the end of summer. In past summers when I had been home, I had often tasted a strange sadness as I sat quietly in the midst of the seething cicada song. This sorrow seemed to pierce deep into my heart along with the piercing insect cry. Always at such times I would sit alone and still, gazing into myself.","I comforted my father as well as I could, and then went back to my desk. I sat down amongst my books, which were scattered all over the floor, and for a long time, I thought about my father’s plaintive words and the sadness in his eyes as he said them. I could hear the cicadas singing outside. These were different from those that I had heard in the early part of the summer. These were the little ones, the tsuku-tsuku-boshi.1 Every summer, when I was home for the holidays, I would often sit and listen to the piercing song of the cicadas and find myself falling into a strangely sorrowful mood. It was as if sorrow crept into my heart with the cry of these insects. And I would stay absolutely still, thinking of my own loneliness."

父は医者から安臥あんがを命ぜられて以来、両便とも寝たまま他ひとの手で始末してもらっていた。潔癖な父は、最初の間こそ甚はなはだしくそれを忌いみ嫌ったが、身体からだが利きかないので、やむを得ずいやいや床とこの上で用を足した。それが病気の加減で頭がだんだん鈍くなるのか何だか、日を経ふるに従って、無精な排泄はいせつを意としないようになった。たまには蒲団ふとんや敷布を汚して、傍はたのものが眉まゆを寄せるのに、当人はかえって平気でいたりした。もっとも尿の量は病気の性質として、極めて少なくなった。医者はそれを苦にした。食欲も次第に衰えた。たまに何か欲しがっても、舌が欲しがるだけで、咽喉のどから下へはごく僅わずかしか通らなかった。好きな新聞も手に取る気力がなくなった。枕まくらの傍そばにある老眼鏡ろうがんきょうは、いつまでも黒い鞘さやに納められたままであった。子供の時分から仲の好かった作さくさんという今では一里りばかり隔たった所に住んでいる人が見舞に来た時、父は「ああ作さんか」といって、どんよりした眼を作さんの方に向けた。,"Since my father ordered me to lie down, both stools have been taken care of by another person while lying down. The innocent father hated it very much for the first time, but he had no choice but to use it on the floor because he couldn't do it from his body. I wondered if it was getting dull due to the illness, and as the days went by, lazy excretion became unintentional. Occasionally, the futon and mattresses were soiled, and the ones on the side brought eyebrows, but the person was rather calm. However, the amount of urine was extremely low due to the nature of the disease. The doctor made it painful. My appetite gradually diminished. Occasionally, I wanted something, but I only wanted the tongue, and I could only pass from the throat to the bottom. I lost the energy to pick up my favorite newspaper. The reading glasses wax cancer near the pillow pillow remained in the black sheath pod forever. When a person named Sakusaku-san, who had been close to him since he was a child, came to visit him, he said, ""Oh, Saku-san?"" I turned to.","Ever since the doctor had ordered total rest, my father had needed help to urinate and defecate. Fastidious man that he was, at first he loathed the process, but his physical incapacity meant he had no option but to resort to a bedpan. Then perhaps his illness slowly dulled his reactions, for he gradually ceased to be concerned by excretion difficulties. Occasionally he would soil the bedclothes, but although this distressed those around him, he seemed unperturbed by it. The nature of his illness, of course, meant that the amount of urine lessened dramatically. This worried the doctor. His appetite too was gradually fading. If he occasionally wanted to eat something, it was only to taste it—he actually ate very little. He even lost the strength to take up his accustomed newspaper. The glasses by his bedside lay untouched in their black case. When he received a visit from Saku-san, a friend since childhood who now lived about two miles distant, my father merely turned glazed eyes in his direction. “Ah, Saku-san, is it?” he said.","For the first few days after the doctor had ordered him to stay in bed, my father had found it particularly galling not to be able to go to the bathroom. But gradually, he seemed to lose his habitual sense of propriety. As his condition grew worse, he became more uninhibited. At times, it seemed that he had lost all sense of shame in the matter of bodily functions. His appetite slowly decreased. Even when he desired food, he found that he could only swallow a small amount. His strength went too, and he could no longer hold the newspaper that he loved so much. His spectacles, which still lay beside his pillow, now remained always in their black case. When a childhood friend of his whom we all called Saku-san, and who lived about three miles away from us, came to see him, he turned his lackluster eyes towards his friend and said, “Oh, it is you, Sakusan.” “It was good of you to come, Saku-san."

三度目の夏はちょうど私が永久に父母の墳墓の地を去ろうと決心した年です。私はその時Ｋに帰国を勧めましたが、Ｋは応じませんでした。そう毎年まいとし家うちへ帰って何をするのだというのです。彼はまた踏み留とどまって勉強するつもりらしかったのです。私は仕方なしに一人で東京を立つ事にしました。私の郷里で暮らしたその二カ月間が、私の運命にとって、いかに波瀾はらんに富んだものかは、前に書いた通りですから繰り返しません。私は不平と幽欝ゆううつと孤独の淋さびしさとを一つ胸に抱いだいて、九月に入いってまたＫに逢あいました。すると彼の運命もまた私と同様に変調を示していました。彼は私の知らないうちに、養家先ようかさきへ手紙を出して、こっちから自分の詐いつわりを白状してしまったのです。彼は最初からその覚悟でいたのだそうです。今更いまさら仕方がないから、お前の好きなものをやるより外ほかに途みちはあるまいと、向うにいわせるつもりもあったのでしょうか。とにかく大学へ入ってまでも養父母を欺あざむき通す気はなかったらしいのです。また欺こうとしても、そう長く続くものではないと見抜いたのかも知れません。,"The third summer is just the year I decided to leave the burial ground of my parents forever. I advised K to return home at that time, but K did not respond. That's right, what do you do every year when you go home? He was supposed to stay and study again. I had no choice but to leave Tokyo alone. As I wrote before, I won't repeat how the two months I lived in my hometown were so turbulent for my destiny. I had a complaint, depression, and loneliness in my heart, and in September I met K again. Then his fate was as volatile as I was. Without my knowledge, he wrote a letter to his foster home, Yokasaki, and confessed his fraud from here. He was prepared for that from the beginning. Since there is no other way to do it now, did you intend to tell the other side that there is no other way than doing what you like? Anyway, it seems that he didn't want to deceive his adoptive parents even when he entered the university. Even if you try to deceive, you may have found that it will not last so long.","Our third summer vacation was the time when I decided to leave forever the land that held my parents’ graves. I urged K to go home that summer, but he resisted. He said he saw no point in going back every year. He clearly planned to spend the summer in Tokyo studying again, so I resignedly set off for home without him. I have already written of the deep turmoil into which my life was thrown by those two months at home. When I met K again in September, I was in the grip of anger, misery, and loneliness. In fact, his life had undergone an upheaval rather like my own. Unknown to me, he had written a letter to his adoptive parents confessing his deceit. He had intended all along to do so, he said. Perhaps he was hoping that they would react by grudgingly accepting the change, and decide it was too late to argue, so he could have his way. At any rate, it seemed he was not prepared to continue deceiving them once he entered university; no doubt he realized that he would not get away with it much longer.","At the beginning of the third summer vacation—it was at the end of this that I decided to leave forever the birthplace of my parents—I urged K to go home; but he would not listen. Indeed, he asked me why it was that I went home every year. Evidently he wished to remain in Tokyo, and study. With reluctance I left him in Tokyo, and went home alone. Concerning the two months that I spent at home, which so affected my future life, I shall not write again, since I have already done so. With my heart filled with dissatisfaction, melancholy, and loneliness, I saw K again in September. And I found that circumstances had changed for the worse for him too. Without my knowing, he had written to his foster parents, confessing that he had been deceiving them. Apparently, he had from the start intended to write such a confession eventually. Perhaps he hoped they would say that it was too late to change his plans, and permit him, no matter how grudgingly, to pursue his studies as he wished. At any rate, it seems K had no desire to deceive his foster parents once he was ready to enter the university. He may have perceived that he could not possibly go on with the deception indefinitely, even if he wanted to do so."
飯めしになった時、奥さんは傍そばに坐すわっている下女げじょを次へ立たせて、自分で給仕きゅうじの役をつとめた。これが表立たない客に対する先生の家の仕来しきたりらしかった。始めの一、二回は私わたくしも窮屈を感じたが、度数の重なるにつけ、茶碗ちゃわんを奥さんの前へ出すのが、何でもなくなった。,"When it became a meal, his wife made her younger daughter, Gejo, sitting beside her stand next to her, and acted as a waiter herself. This seemed to be the result of the teacher's house for the invisible customers. The first one or two times I felt cramped, but as the frequency overlapped, I couldn't put the bowl in front of my wife.","In Sensei’s house, when a meal with informal guests had progressed to the point where the rice was served, his wife dismissed the maid and served us herself. This was the custom. The first few times I dined there, it made me feel rather awkward, but once I grew more used to it, I had no difficulty handing her my empty bowl for refilling.","When it was time for the main course to be served, Sensei’s wife sent away the maid who was sitting by her side and waited on us herself. This was their customary procedure, I believe, when they had friends, rather than formal guests, to dinner. The first two or three times I had dinner there, I felt somewhat ill at ease, but eventually, I learned to ask Sensei’s wife to refill my bowl without the slightest hesitation or embarrassment."

Ｋは小さなナイフで頸動脈けいどうみゃくを切って一息ひといきに死んでしまったのです。外ほかに創きずらしいものは何にもありませんでした。私が夢のような薄暗い灯ひで見た唐紙の血潮は、彼の頸筋くびすじから一度に迸ほとばしったものと知れました。私は日中にっちゅうの光で明らかにその迹あとを再び眺ながめました。そうして人間の血の勢いきおいというものの劇はげしいのに驚きました。,"K cut the carotid artery with a small knife and died in a breath. There was nothing else that was unusual to create. The blood of Karagami, which I saw in a dreamy dim lantern, was known to have burst from his neckline at once. I clearly looked back at the trail with the light of the day. Then, I was surprised at the drama of the vigor of human blood.","K had slit his carotid artery with a small knife and died immediately. It was his only wound. The blood on the paper doors, which I had glimpsed by the dreamlike half-light of his lamp, had spurted from his neck. Now I gazed at it again, in the clarity of daylight. I was stunned at the violent force that pulses the blood through us.","K had cut open a carotid artery with a small knife, and had died instantly. He had no other wound. I learned that the blood which I had seen on the wall in the semi-darkness—as though in a dream—had gushed out in one tremendous spurt. I looked at the stains again, this time in daylight; and I marveled at the power of human blood."
今いった通り先生は始終静かであった。落ち付いていた。けれども時として変な曇りがその顔を横切る事があった。窓に黒い鳥影が射さすように。射すかと思うと、すぐ消えるには消えたが。私が始めてその曇りを先生の眉間みけんに認めたのは、雑司ヶ谷ぞうしがやの墓地で、不意に先生を呼び掛けた時であった。私はその異様の瞬間に、今まで快く流れていた心臓の潮流をちょっと鈍らせた。しかしそれは単に一時の結滞けったいに過ぎなかった。私の心は五分と経たたないうちに平素の弾力を回復した。私はそれぎり暗そうなこの雲の影を忘れてしまった。ゆくりなくまたそれを思い出させられたのは、小春こはるの尽きるに間まのない或ある晩の事であった。,"As I said, the teacher was quiet all the time. I was calm. But sometimes weird cloudiness crossed the face. Like a black bird shadow shining on the window. When I thought about shooting it, it disappeared to disappear immediately. The first time I recognized the cloudiness in my teacher's eyebrows was when I suddenly called on my teacher at Zoshigaya Zoshigaya's graveyard. At that strange moment, I slowed down the flow of my heart, which had been flowing comfortably until now. But it was just a temporary stagnation. My heart recovered its normal elasticity in less than five minutes. I forgot the shadow of this cloud, which seems to be dark. It was one night when Koharu Koharu was exhausted that reminded me of it.","He was, as I have said, always quiet and composed, even serene. Yet from time to time an odd shadow would cross his face, like the sudden dark passage of a bird across a window, although it was no sooner there than gone again. The first time I noticed it was when I called out to him in the graveyard at Zōshigaya. For a strange instant the warm pulse of my blood faltered a little. It was only a momentary miss of a beat, however, and in no time my heart recovered its usual resilient pulse, and I proceeded to forget what I had seen. One evening just at the end of autumn’s warm weather, I was unexpectedly reminded of it again. As I was talking to Sensei, I was for some reason suddenly reminded of the great ginkgo tree that he had pointed out to me.","As I have already said, Sensei was always quiet. Moreover, he seemed to be at peace with himself. But sometimes, I would notice a shadow cross his face. True, like the shadow of a bird outside the window, it would quickly disappear. The first time I noticed it was at the cemetery at Zoshigaya, when I suddenly spoke to him. I remember that I felt then, though only for a passing moment, a strange weight on my heart. Soon after, the memory of that moment faded away. One evening, however, towards the end of the Indian summer, it was unexpectedly brought back to my mind."
始め私わたくしは理解のある女性にょしょうとして奥さんに対していた。私がその気で話しているうちに、奥さんの様子が次第に変って来た。奥さんは私の頭脳に訴える代りに、私の心臓ハートを動かし始めた。自分と夫の間には何の蟠わだかまりもない、またないはずであるのに、やはり何かある。それだのに眼を開あけて見極みきわめようとすると、やはり何なんにもない。奥さんの苦にする要点はここにあった。,"At the beginning, I was dealing with my wife as an understanding woman. As I was talking with that feeling, my wife's appearance gradually changed. Instead of appealing to my brain, my wife started to move my heart. There's nothing wrong with me and my husband, and there shouldn't be any, but there's still something. However, when I open my eyes and try to find out, there is nothing. Here was the point that made his wife suffer.","At first I had thought of Sensei’s wife as a perspicacious woman. But as we talked, she gradually changed before my eyes; then my heart, rather than my mind, began to respond to her. Nothing, it seemed, troubled her relationship with her husband—indeed, what could?—and yet something was wrong. But try as she might to learn what the problem might be, she could find nothing. Precisely this made her suffer.","At first, I thought of Sensei’s wife as a woman of understanding. But in the course of our conversation her manner began gradually to change, and I found that she had ceased to appeal to my mind, and that she had begun to move my heart. There was no ill-feeling between her and Sensei. Indeed, there was no reason why there should be. Yet, there was something that separated her from Sensei. But no matter how hard she tried, she could not find what this thing was that separated them. This, in short, was her predicament."
三,three,CHAPTER 39,"Wondering whether she thought her ideas to be logically irrefutable or statistically demonstrable, I listened to my mother’s platitudes in silence."
「何だい」といって、私の封を開くのを傍そばに立って待っていた。,"I said ""what's up"" and waited by my side to open my seal.","“What is it?” she said, standing expectantly beside me as I opened the envelope.","“What is it?” she said, standing by while I opened it."
私は仕方なしに言葉の上で、好いい加減にうろつき廻まわった末、Ｋが近頃ちかごろ何かいいはしなかったかと奥さんに聞いてみました。奥さんは思いも寄らないという風をして、「何を？」とまた反問して来ました。そうして私の答える前に、「あなたには何かおっしゃったんですか」とかえって向うで聞くのです。,"I had no choice but to wander around in words and asked my wife if K had done something good these days. His wife said that he didn't think about it, and asked again, ""What?"" Then, before I answer, I ask, ""Did you say something?""","After beating about the bush for a while, I finally asked whether K had recently said anything to her. “What about?” she asked, startled. Then, before I could answer, she said, “Did he say something to you?”","Finally, after a minute or two of beating about the bush, I said: “Has K said anything to you lately?” Okusan seemed taken aback by my question. “What do you mean?” she asked. Before I could answer her she said, “Did he say something to you?”"

But can humans change so much just by losing one of their best friends? I'm dying to know that, so one of you I want you to judge. ""","“I’m not to speak of that either. But tell me, can someone change so much with the loss of a single friend? That’s what I so long to know.",“That again I’m not allowed to say. But can a man change so because of the death of one friend? I should very much like to know.
私は食後Ｋを散歩に連れ出しました。二人は伝通院でんずういんの裏手から植物園の通りをぐるりと廻まわってまた富坂とみざかの下へ出ました。散歩としては短い方ではありませんでしたが、その間あいだに話した事は極きわめて少なかったのです。性質からいうと、Ｋは私よりも無口な男でした。私も多弁な方ではなかったのです。しかし私は歩きながら、できるだけ話を彼に仕掛しかけてみました。私の問題はおもに二人の下宿している家族についてでした。私は奥さんやお嬢さんを彼がどう見ているか知りたかったのです。ところが彼は海のものとも山のものとも見分みわけの付かないような返事ばかりするのです。しかもその返事は要領を得ないくせに、極めて簡単でした。彼は二人の女に関してよりも、専攻の学科の方に多くの注意を払っているように見えました。もっともそれは二学年目の試験が目の前に逼せまっている頃ころでしたから、普通の人間の立場から見て、彼の方が学生らしい学生だったのでしょう。その上彼はシュエデンボルグがどうだとかこうだとかいって、無学な私を驚かせました。,"I took K out for a walk after eating. From the back of Denzuin, they went around the streets of the botanical garden and went out to Tomisaka and Mizaka again. It wasn't a short walk, but I talked very little during that time. By nature, K was a quieter man than I was. I wasn't a verbose person either. But as I walked, I tried to talk to him as much as possible. My problem was mainly about the two boarding families. I wanted to know how he sees his wife and daughter. However, he always replies indistinguishable from the sea and the mountains. Moreover, the reply was extremely easy, even though it didn't make sense. He seemed to pay more attention to his department than to the two women. However, it was around the time when the exam for the second grade was in front of me, so from the standpoint of a normal human being, he was probably a student. What's more, he surprised me illiterate by saying what Schedenburg was like.","After dinner K and I went for a walk. We went behind Denzūin Temple and around the botanical gardens, emerging below Tomizaka. It was a long walk, but we spoke very little. K was temperamentally a man of even fewer words than I. I was not a great talker, but as we walked, I did my best to engage him in conversation. My main focus of concern was the family in whose house we were lodging. I asked him what he thought of Okusan and Ojōsan. He was quite impossible to pin down on the subject, however. He not only avoided the point, but his responses were extremely brief. He seemed far more interested in the topic of his studies than in the two ladies. Our second-year exams were almost upon us, I admit, so from any normal point of view he was behaving much more typically than I. He launched into a disquisition on Swedenborg1 that made my uneducated mind reel.","After dinner, I persuaded K to go for a walk with me. From the back of Denzuin Temple, we went around the botanical garden, and returned to the bottom of the slope at Tomizaka. It was a fairly long walk, but we said very little during it. K was by nature less talkative than I. I was not a very talkative person myself. But on this occasion, I tried to carry on a conversation with him. I wanted mostly to discuss the family with whom we were staying. I wanted to know how K regarded Okusan and Ojosan. But to my questions he gave replies so vague that one could not tell whether they came from the mountains or the sea. Despite their vagueness, however, they were rather simple answers. The subject of his special study seemed to interest him more than the two ladies. True, our second-year examinations were drawing near, and I suppose that from the point of view of a normal person, K was behaving more like a student than I was. I remember that he amazed me —I was not very scholarly—with references to Swedenborg and so on."
「誰もいなかったよ」,"""There was no one""",“No one.”,"“No, there was no one.”"
私はただＫの健康について云々うんぬんしました。一人で置くとますます人間が偏屈へんくつになるばかりだからといいました。それに付け足して、Ｋが養家ようかと折合おりあいの悪かった事や、実家と離れてしまった事や、色々話して聞かせました。私は溺おぼれかかった人を抱いて、自分の熱を向うに移してやる覚悟で、Ｋを引き取るのだと告げました。そのつもりであたたかい面倒を見てやってくれと、奥さんにもお嬢さんにも頼みました。私はここまで来て漸々ようよう奥さんを説き伏せたのです。しかし私から何にも聞かないＫは、この顚末てんまつをまるで知らずにいました。私もかえってそれを満足に思って、のっそり引き移って来たＫを、知らん顔で迎えました。,"I just swear about K's health. He said that if you put it alone, it will only make humans more and more biased. In addition to that, I talked about various things such as the fact that K had a bad relationship with him and that he was away from his parents' house. I embraced the drowning man and told him that he would take over K, ready to shift his fever away. I asked my wife and daughter to take care of me with that intention. I came here and persuaded my wife to gradually. However, K, who didn't ask me anything, didn't know this story. On the contrary, I was satisfied with it, and welcomed K, who had moved in quietly, with an unfamiliar face.","I did, however, talk about his precarious state of health. If left to himself, I told her, he would only grow more perverse and eccentric. I went on to describe his strained relations with his adoptive parents and his severance from his original family. By attempting to help him, I said, I was grasping a drowning man, desperate to infuse in him my own living heat. I begged Okusan and Ojōsan to help by warmly accepting him. Okusan finally relented. K knew nothing of this discussion, and I was satisfied that he remain ignorant. When he came stolidly into the house with his bags, I greeted him with an innocent air.","I did, however, say that I was worried about K’s health. I said that if allowed to keep on living in solitude, he was sure to become more eccentric than ever. I told her also of the troubles he had had with his foster parents, and of his later expulsion from his original family. It was, I said, in the hope of lending warmth to his cold and lonely life that I wanted him to come and stay with me. Would not Okusan and Ojosan , I asked, look after him with the warm kindness that he so much needed? Okusan raised no more objections. I said nothing about this conversation to K. I was glad that he had no inkling of what had been said with regard to his entering our household."
「あなたのお父さんが亡くなられるのを、今から予想してかかるような言葉遣ことばづかいをするのが気に触さわったら許してくれたまえ。しかし人間は死ぬものだからね。どんなに達者なものでも、いつ死ぬか分らないものだからね」,"""Please forgive me for your dad's death if you feel like using the wording that you would expect from now on, but humans die. No matter how proficient you are. I don't know when I'll die. ""","“Please forgive me if my anticipating your father’s death like this has offended you. But it’s in the nature of things for people to die, you know. There’s no knowing when even the healthiest of us will die.”","“If I have annoyed you by seeming to anticipate your father’s death, please forgive me. But we all have to die some time, you know. Even the healthy ones—how do we know when they will die?”"

「その信念が先生の心に好よく映るはずだと私は思いますが」,"""I think that belief should look good in the teacher's mind.""","“Well, I think that conviction would reveal itself in Sensei’s heart as well.”",“Such a conviction must surely be known to Sensei.”
私は時々父の病気を忘れた。いっそ早く東京へ出てしまおうかと思ったりした。その父自身もおのれの病気を忘れる事があった。未来を心配しながら、未来に対する所置は一向取らなかった。私はついに先生の忠告通り財産分配の事を父にいい出す機会を得ずに過ぎた。,"I sometimes forgot my father's illness. I thought I should go to Tokyo sooner. The father himself sometimes forgot about his illness. I was worried about the future, but I didn't take any position for the future. I finally didn't get the chance to tell my dad about property distribution, as my teacher advised.","From time to time I forgot my father’s illness and felt inclined to escape back to Tokyo early. My father himself forgot that he was ill, in fact. Anxious though he was about the future, he made no moves to deal with the problem. Time passed, and I found no opportunity to bring up the matter of the division of property with him as Sensei had advised.","Sometimes I would forget my father’s illness, and toy with the idea of leaving immediately for Tokyo. My father too seemed occasionally to forget that he was ill, and though he was not unaware of the need to set his affairs in order before his death, he did nothing about it. No opportunity ever arose for me to approach him about my share of the estate as Sensei had advised."
奥さんは急に薄赤い顔をした。,The wife suddenly made a pale red face.,She blushed slightly.,Sensei’s wife blushed a little.
「亡くなられた日がですか」,"""What day did you die?""",“They died on the same day?”,“On the same day?”
「私はちっとも淋さむしくはありません」,"""I'm not lonely at all.""",“I’m not at all lonely.”,“But I am not at all lonely.”
七,Seven,CHAPTER 61,"The following summer, I went home for the third time."
十四,fourteen,CHAPTER 50,"I made a vague remark, so vague that I myself did not know its meaning, and abruptly left the room."
「私は殉死という言葉をほとんど忘れていました。平生へいぜい使う必要のない字だから、記憶の底に沈んだまま、腐れかけていたものと見えます。妻の笑談じょうだんを聞いて始めてそれを思い出した時、私は妻に向ってもし自分が殉死するならば、明治の精神に殉死するつもりだと答えました。私の答えも無論笑談に過ぎなかったのですが、私はその時何だか古い不要な言葉に新しい意義を盛り得たような心持がしたのです。,"""I almost forgot the word murder. It's a character that I don't need to use at all in Hirao, so it looks like it's sunk into the bottom of my memory and it's rotten. When I remembered that, I told my wife that if I was to die, I would die in the spirit of the Meiji era. My answer was, of course, just a laugh, but at that time I felt like I had a new meaning in old unnecessary words.","I had almost forgotten the expression “to die with your lord.” It’s not a phrase that is used in normal life these days. It must have lain there deep in my memory all these years, decaying slowly. Reminded of it by my wife’s jest, I replied that if I were to die a loyal follower’s death, the lord I was following to the grave would be the spirit of the Meiji era itself. I was joking too, of course, but as I spoke it seemed to me that this old, disused expression had somehow gained a new meaning.","I had almost forgotten that there was such a word as “junshi.” It is not a word that one uses normally, and I suppose it had been banished to some remote corner of my memory. I turned to my wife, who had reminded me of its existence, and said: “I will commit junshi if you like; but in my case, it will be through loyalty to the spirit of the Meiji era.” My remark was meant as a joke; but I did feel that the antiquated word had come to hold a new meaning for me."
やがて若葉に鎖とざされたように蓊欝こんもりした小高い一構ひとかまえの下に細い路みちが開ひらけた。門の柱に打ち付けた標札に何々園とあるので、その個人の邸宅でない事がすぐ知れた。先生はだらだら上のぼりになっている入口を眺ながめて、「はいってみようか」といった。私はすぐ「植木屋ですね」と答えた。,"Eventually, a narrow road opened under a small, tall structure that looked like a chain of young leaves. It was immediately known that it was not the mansion of the individual because there were many gardens on the nameplate struck on the pillar of the gate. The teacher looked at the sloppy entrance and said, ""Let's go."" I immediately answered, ""It's a gardener.""","At length the little path opened out at a point below a large house shrouded by the fresh young leaves of an overgrown garden. We quickly realized that this was no private dwelling—the sign attached to the front gate bore the name of a plant nursery. Gazing at the gently sloping path, Sensei suggested we go in for a look. “Yes,” I agreed, “it’s a nurseryman’s plantation, isn’t it?”","After a while, we came to a little path which seemed to lead up to a house on a small hill. The hill was covered with a mass of green foliage. At the foot of the path was a gate, and on one of the columns was a sign telling us that we were at the entrance to a tree nursery. We knew then that the path did not lead to a private estate. Looking up at the gate, Sensei said, “Shall we go in?” I answered quickly, “Yes. They sell trees here, don’t they?”"
「地面は他ひとのものだから仕方がない。その代りおれの持ってるものは皆みんなお前にやるよ」,"""It can't be helped because the ground belongs to someone else. Instead, I'll do everything I have.""","“The earth belongs to someone else, so we can’t do much about that. But I’ll give you everything I own.”","“I can’t give you the land, since it doesn’t belong to me. But everything I own is yours.”"
私は小石川こいしかわへ引き移ってからも、当分この緊張した気分に寛くつろぎを与える事ができませんでした。私は自分で自分が恥ずかしいほど、きょときょと周囲を見廻みまわしていました。不思議にもよく働くのは頭と眼だけで、口の方はそれと反対に、段々動かなくなって来ました。私は家うちのものの様子を猫のようによく観察しながら、黙って机の前に坐すわっていました。時々は彼らに対して気の毒だと思うほど、私は油断のない注意を彼らの上に注そそいでいたのです。おれは物を偸ぬすまない巾着切きんちゃくきりみたようなものだ、私はこう考えて、自分が厭いやになる事さえあったのです。,"Even after I moved to Koishikawa Koishikawa, I couldn't relax and relax in this tense mood for the time being. I was embarrassed to look around myself. Mysteriously, only the head and eyes work well, and on the contrary, the mouth gradually becomes immobile. I sat silently at the desk, observing things in my house like a cat. I was so alert on them that I sometimes felt sorry for them. I'm like a purse-cutting purse that doesn't swear, I even thought that I was reluctant.","For some time after my move to Koishikawa, I continued in a highly strung state. I kept glancing furtively about, so much so that I unnerved even myself. Although my mind and eyes were abnormally active, however, my tongue grew less and less inclined to speak. I sat silently at my desk, observing those around me like a cat. Sometimes my keen awareness of them was so intense it shamed me to think of it. All that distinguished me from a thief","For quite a while after I had moved to Koishikawa, I could not relax. I looked at everything around me with such obvious shiftiness that I became ashamed of myself. Strangely enough, I became less and less inclined to talk, while my mind and eyes increased their activity enormously. I sat silently at my desk, and like a cat, watched the movements of others in the house. I was so much on my guard that sometimes I had the grace enough to feel guilty towards them. “I am behaving like a pickpocket who doesn’t steal,” I would tell myself disgustedly."
「これは宅うちで拵こしらえたのよ」,"""I made this at home.""","“I made it myself,” she explained.","“I made this myself, you know.”"
十五,Fifteen,CHAPTER 69,"Shortly thereafter, when I had observed Okusan’s behavior towards me in a different light, I came to the conclusion that she put considerable trust in me."
そのうちお嬢さんの態度がだんだん平気になって来ました。Ｋと私がいっしょに宅うちにいる時でも、よくＫの室へやの縁側へ来て彼の名を呼びました。そうしてそこへ入って、ゆっくりしていました。無論郵便を持って来る事もあるし、洗濯物を置いてゆく事もあるのですから、そのくらいの交通は同じ宅にいる二人の関係上、当然と見なければならないのでしょうが、ぜひお嬢さんを専有したいという強烈な一念に動かされている私には、どうしてもそれが当然以上に見えたのです。ある時はお嬢さんがわざわざ私の室へ来るのを回避して、Ｋの方ばかりへ行くように思われる事さえあったくらいです。それならなぜＫに宅を出てもらわないのかとあなたは聞くでしょう。しかしそうすれば私がＫを無理に引張ひっぱって来た主意が立たなくなるだけです。私にはそれができないのです。,"Eventually, the attitude of the young lady became more and more calm. Even when K and I were at home together, I often came to the porch of K's room and called his name. Then I entered there and was slow. Of course, I sometimes bring mail and sometimes leave laundry, so I think that traffic like that should be taken for granted because of the relationship between the two people in the same house, but by all means, please take a look at the young lady. It seemed more than natural to me, who was driven by a strong desire to own it. At one point, it even seemed that the young lady avoided coming to my room and went only to K. Then you will ask why K doesn't leave your house. However, doing so only makes me unwilling to pull K forcibly. I can't do that.","Over time Ojōsan grew increasingly nonchalant. Even when we were both at home, she would go to K’s room via the veranda and call his name. Then she would go in and make herself at home. Sometimes, of course, she was bringing him mail or delivering his washing, the kind of interaction that could only be considered normal for those living under the same roof, but my fierce and single-minded desire to have her all to myself drove me to read more into it. At times I felt she was going out of her way to avoid my room and visit only his. So why, you may ask, did I not ask K to leave the house? But that would have defeated the very purpose for bringing him there in the first place. It was beyond me to do it.","As time passed, Ojosan’s manner became more nonchalant, and I noted that she was becoming more openly friendly with K. Even when I was at home, she would call K’s name from the verandah, and then go into his room for a long chat. But, you would say, how else could two people living under the same roof behave? And I will admit that she could hardly avoid going into his room; there were, after all, such things as his letters and his laundry that she had to take to him. But to me, who was so intent on monopolizing her company, it seemed that she was seeing him far more than was necessary. Sometimes, indeed, I could not help the impression that she was purposely avoiding my company in order to be with K. You may ask, “Why then did you not ask him to leave the house?” But it was I that had forced K to come and live with me for his own good."
「それもそうね。けれどもあなたは必竟ひっきょう財産があるからそんな呑気のんきな事をいっていられるのよ。これが困る人でご覧なさい。なかなかあなたのように落ち付いちゃいられないから」,"""That's right. But you have a must-have fortune, so you can say such a carefree thing. Look at this for those who are in trouble. It's hard to calm down like you.""","“That’s true enough,” she responded. “But after all, you’ll inherit property, so it’s natural that you’d feel relaxed about the question. Just take a look at others who aren’t so fortunate. They’re far from able to be so blithe.”","“That may be,” she said. “But it is because your people have money that you can afford to be so unconcerned about your future. You would not be so easygoing, if you were in less fortunate circumstances.” I knew of course that she was right."
「ええ。もしそれが源因だとすれば、私の責任だけはなくなるんだから、それだけでも私大変楽になれるんですが、……」,"""Yeah. If that's the cause, I'm not the only one, so that alone makes me very comfortable, but ...""","“Yes. If it really is the cause, then I can cease to feel responsible, and that in itself would be such a relief .","“Yes. If it was indeed the cause, then I was not responsible. There would be at least a little consolation in knowing that much, if I could be sure . . .”"
私がこういった時、背せいの高い彼は自然と私の前に萎縮いしゅくして小さくなるような感じがしました。彼はいつも話す通り頗すこぶる強情ごうじょうな男でしたけれども、一方ではまた人一倍の正直者でしたから、自分の矛盾などをひどく非難される場合には、決して平気でいられない質たちだったのです。私は彼の様子を見てようやく安心しました。すると彼は卒然そつぜん「覚悟？」と聞きました。そうして私がまだ何とも答えない先に「覚悟、――覚悟ならない事もない」と付け加えました。彼の調子は独言ひとりごとのようでした。また夢の中の言葉のようでした。,"When I was like this, he was tall and naturally felt atrophied and small in front of me. As he always speaks, he was a very stubborn man, but on the other hand he was more honest than anyone else, so if he is badly criticized for his contradictions, he can never be calm. That's how it was. I was finally relieved to see him. Then he suddenly asked, ""Are you ready?"" Then, before I answered anything yet, I added, ""Be prepared, there is nothing you can't do."" His tone was like a soliloquy. It was like a word in a dream again.","At these words, his tall frame seemed to shrink and dwindle before my eyes. He was, as I have said, incredibly obstinate and headstrong, yet he was also far too honest to be able to shrug it off if his own inconsistency was forcefully brought home to him. Seeing him cowed, I at last breathed a sigh of relief. Then he said suddenly, “Resolve?” Before I could respond, he went on, “Resolve— well, I’m not without resolve.” He spoke as if to himself, or as if in a trance.","K seemed to shrivel before my eyes. He seemed not half as tall as he once was. As I have said before, he was a very stubborn fellow; but he was also too honest to ignore his own inconsistency when it was bluntly pointed out to him by another. I saw the effect my words had had on him, and I was satisfied. Then he said suddenly: “Am I prepared . . . ?” Before I could say anything, he added: “Why not? I can will myself . . .” He seemed to be talking to himself. And the words sounded as though they were spoken in a dream."
「そりゃ、お前、口でこそそうおいいだけれどもね。お腹なかのなかではまだ大丈夫だと思ってお出いでのだよ」,"""Well, you're good with your mouth, but you're still ok in your stomach.""","“Well, he’s just saying that, you know. In his heart of hearts he’s convinced he’s still fine.”","“Secretly, he thinks that he has recovered.”"
父は時々囈語うわことをいうようになった。,My dad started to say idiots from time to time.,In his delirium my father sometimes spoke aloud.,My father began to talk deliriously.
「何かいうとまた議論を仕掛けるなんて、叱しかり付けられそうですから」と私は答えた。,"""I'm likely to be scolded for having a discussion again,"" I replied.","“That’s because I feel as if whatever I might say, you’d accuse me of being argumentative,” I replied.","“Well, I don’t want to be scolded for being argumentative,” I answered."
私は暗い人世の影を遠慮なくあなたの頭の上に投げかけて上げます。しかし恐れてはいけません。暗いものを凝じっと見詰めて、その中からあなたの参考になるものをお攫つかみなさい。私の暗いというのは、固もとより倫理的に暗いのです。私は倫理的に生れた男です。また倫理的に育てられた男です。その倫理上の考えは、今の若い人と大分だいぶ違ったところがあるかも知れません。しかしどう間違っても、私自身のものです。間に合せに借りた損料着そんりょうぎではありません。だからこれから発達しようというあなたには幾分か参考になるだろうと思うのです。,"I feel free to cast the shadow of the dark world on your head. But don't be afraid. Gaze at the dark ones and grab your reference. My darkness is ethically darker than solid. I am an ethically born man. He is also an ethically raised man. That ethical idea may be quite different from today's young people. But no matter what I make a mistake, it's my own. It is not a loss fee that I borrowed in time. So I think it will be a little helpful for you who are about to develop.","I will not hesitate to cast upon you the shadow thrown by the darkness of human life. But do not be afraid. Gaze steadfastly into this darkness, and find there the things that will be of use to you. The darkness of which I speak is a moral darkness. I was born a moral man and raised as one. My morality is probably very different from that of young people today. But different though it may be, it is my own. It is not some rented clothing I have borrowed to suit the moment. This is why I believe it will be of some use to you, a young man just starting out in life.","Without hesitation, I am about to force you into the shadows of this dark world of ours. But you must not fear. Gaze steadily into the shadows, and then take whatever will be of use to you in your own life. When I speak of darkness, I mean moral darkness. For I was born an ethical creature, and I was brought up to be an ethical man. True, my ethics may be different from those of the young men of today. But they are at least my own. I did not borrow them for the sake of convenience as a man might a dress suit. It is for this reason that I think you, who wish to grow, may learn something from my experience."
Ｋの神経衰弱はこの時もう大分だいぶよくなっていたらしいのです。それと反比例に、私の方は段々過敏になって来ていたのです。私は自分より落ち付いているＫを見て、羨うらやましがりました。また憎らしがりました。彼はどうしても私に取り合う気色けしきを見せなかったからです。私にはそれが一種の自信のごとく映りました。しかしその自信を彼に認めたところで、私は決して満足できなかったのです。私の疑いはもう一歩前へ出て、その性質を明あきらめたがりました。彼は学問なり事業なりについて、これから自分の進んで行くべき前途の光明こうみょうを再び取り返した心持になったのだろうか。単にそれだけならば、Ｋと私との利害に何の衝突の起る訳はないのです。私はかえって世話のし甲斐がいがあったのを嬉うれしく思うくらいなものです。けれども彼の安心がもしお嬢さんに対してであるとすれば、私は決して彼を許す事ができなくなるのです。不思議にも彼は私のお嬢さんを愛している素振そぶりに全く気が付いていないように見えました。無論私もそれがＫの眼に付くようにわざとらしくは振舞いませんでしたけれども。Ｋは元来そういう点にかけると鈍にぶい人なのです。私には最初からＫなら大丈夫という安心があったので、彼をわざわざ宅うちへ連れて来たのです。,"It seems that K's memory weakness had improved a lot at this time. In inverse proportion to that, I was becoming more and more sensitive. I was jealous when I saw K, who was more calm than me. I hated it again. Because he just didn't show me the humor. It seemed to me a kind of self-confidence. But when I admitted that confidence to him, I was never satisfied. My suspicions went one step further and wanted to give up on their nature. Did he feel that he had regained the light of his future, whether it was academics or business? If that were the only thing, there would be no conflict in the interests of K and me. On the contrary, I am glad that it was worth taking care of. But if his reassurance is for the young lady, I can never forgive him. Curiously, he seemed completely unaware of the pretense that he loved my daughter. Of course, I didn't act intentionally so that it would catch K's eyes. Originally, K is a dull person when it comes to such points. From the beginning, I was relieved that K would be okay, so I took the trouble to bring him home.","The state of his nerves by now seemed to have considerably improved, while my own peace of mind had disintegrated. I observed his calm demeanor with envy, and with loathing, interpreting it as indifference to me. His serenity smacked of self-confidence, and not of a kind that it pleased me to see in him. My growing suspicions now demanded clarification of just what lay behind his self-assurance. Had his optimism about his chosen goals in life suddenly revived? If so, then we had no collision of interests— indeed, it would have pleased me to think I had helped him on his way. But if his calm originated in his feelings for Ojōsan, this I could not countenance. Strangely, he seemed oblivious to the signs that I myself loved her—though needless to say, I was anything but eager to alert him to my feelings. Quite simply, he was constitutionally insensitive to such things; indeed, it had been in the faith that no such problems would arise that I had brought him into the house in the first place.","It would seem that by then, K’s nervous condition had improved considerably. My nerves, on the other hand, had become increasingly high-strung. I envied K who was so much calmer than I. I hated him. What annoyed me was that he took no notice of me, no matter what I did. I took this as a sign of K’s self-confidence. But that K had grown more confident of late gave me little satisfaction. I wanted to discover the real cause of the change in him. Had he simply become optimistic about his studies and his future career once more? If so, there was no reason why there should be any rivalry between us. Indeed, I would find satisfaction in the fact that my efforts to help him had not been in vain. But if his new serenity had come as a result of his contact with Ojosan, then I would find it impossible to forgive him. K seemed totally unaware of my love for Ojosan. Of course, I had been careful not to be too obvious about it. But there is no denying that in such matters, K was quite insensitive. And I must confess that it was because I was aware of this insensitivity in him that I was less reluctant than I might have been to invite him to live with us."
何事も知らない私たちはこの突然な言葉に驚かされた。,We who know nothing were surprised by this sudden word.,"he exclaimed. We, of course, knew nothing of what had prompted these words, and they gave us quite a shock.","We, who had not yet read the news, were startled by these exclamations."
私もそう思っていた。懐中かいちゅうした手紙はそのままにしてまた病室へ帰った。父は眼を開けて、そこに並んでいる人の名前を母に尋ねた。母があれは誰、これは誰と一々説明してやると、父はそのたびに首肯うなずいた。首肯かない時は、母が声を張りあげて、何々さんです、分りましたかと念を押した。,"I thought so too. I left the letter in my pocket and went back to the hospital room. My father opened his eyes and asked my mother the names of the people in line. Whenever my mother explained to whom and who this was, my father nodded. When I didn't agree, my mother raised her voice and reminded me of what she was.","I thought so too and returned to the sickroom without touching the letter I had tucked away. My father opened his eyes and asked my mother to tell him who was present. She carefully named us one by one, and at each name he nodded. If he failed to nod, she raised her voice and repeated the name, asking if he understood.","My brother was quite right. Leaving the letter unopened in my pocket, I went back to the sickroom. My father opened his eyes, and asked my mother for the names of all those sitting around him. At the mention of each name, my father nodded, and when he seemed not to hear, my mother repeated the name loudly, saying, “Did you hear?” My father said, “You have all been very kind."
「吐気さえ来なければまだ大丈夫ですよ」と奥さんがいった。,"""If you don't get nausea, you're still okay,"" said his wife.","“If he’s not nauseous, then things are still all right,” said Sensei’s wife.","“He is all right,” said Sensei’s wife, “so long as there is no nausea.”"
父はその夜よまた気を更かえて、客を呼ぶなら何日いつにするかと私の都合を聞いた。都合の好いいも悪いもなしにただぶらぶら古い家の中に寝起ねおきしている私に、こんな問いを掛けるのは、父の方が折れて出たのと同じ事であった。私はこの穏やかな父の前に拘泥こだわらない頭を下げた。私は父と相談の上招待しょうだいの日取りを極きめた。,"My dad changed his mind that night and asked me what day and when to call a guest. Asking this question to me, who was just hanging out in an old house for good or bad, was the same as my father's breaking out. I bowed in front of this gentle father. After consulting with my father, I decided to invite him.","His mood improved that evening, and he asked me when it would suit me to invite the guests. No time was more suitable than any other for me, since I was just hanging around the old house doing nothing but sleeping and waking, so I took this as an indication that my father was being conciliatory. Seeing him so mild and gentle, I could only bow my head in acquiescence. We discussed the question and came up with a date for the invitations.","That evening, there was a change in my father’s mood. He asked me when it would be convenient to hold the dinner party. He knew perfectly well that I was then spending my time in complete idleness. His asking the question was therefore his way of trying to bring about a reconciliation. I could not but be touched by my father’s gentleness, and I became more obedient. After a short discussion, we agreed upon the date."
三十二,Thirty-two,CHAPTER 32,I returned to my lodgings with an oppressive feeling—like a sense of doom—inside me.
単純な私は従妹との結婚問題について、さほど頭を痛める必要がないと思っていました。厭なものは断る、断ってさえしまえば後あとには何も残らない、私はこう信じていたのです。だから叔父の希望通りに意志を曲げなかったにもかかわらず、私はむしろ平気でした。過去一年の間いまだかつてそんな事に屈托くったくした覚えもなく、相変らずの元気で国へ帰ったのです。,"Simple, I thought I didn't have to worry too much about the marriage issue with my cousin. I believed that I refused the unpleasant things, and if I refused, nothing would be left behind. So even though I didn't bend my mind as my uncle wanted, I was rather okay. For the past year, I never felt like giving in to such a thing, and I returned to the country with the same energy.","My innocent and uncomplicated mind felt no need to bother itself much over the problem of the proposed marriage to my cousin. If you didn’t want to do something, you simply said no, I believed, and there would be no further repercussions. So although I had not submitted to my uncle’s will, I remained unperturbed. I returned home in my usual high spirits, after a year spent unworried by the question.","I was so simple as to think that the question of marriage between my cousin and myself had been settled, and that there was no more need for me to worry about it. I believed that in life, so long as one rejected openly what one did not want, one would be left alone. And so the fact that I had not yielded to my uncle’s persuasion worried me very little. After having spent a year without giving it much thought, I went home in my usual cheerful mood."
二人はそれを緒口いとくちにまた話を始めた。そうしてまた二人に共通な興味のある先生を問題にした。,"The two started talking about it again with Oguchi and Kuchi. Then again, I made a problem with the teacher who has a common interest in them.","This remark provided us with a way back into the conversation. Once more its subject was the one interest we had in common, Sensei.",We began to talk again. The conversation naturally wandered back to the subject of Sensei.
父は口ではこういった。こういったばかりでなく、今まで敷いていた床とこを上げさせて、いつものような元気を示した。,"My father said this in his mouth. Not only this, but by raising the floor and the floor that I had been laying down until now, I showed my usual energy.","This bravado was not confined to words, for there he was, with his sickbed folded away, behaving as if his health were back to normal. “Don’t be too rash, or you’ll have a relapse,” I warned him, but he treated this with happy disregard.","He seemed to have recovered his normal health. “You will be ill again,” I said, “unless you take better care of yourself.”"
「若い時はあんな人じゃなかったんですよ。若い時はまるで違っていました。それが全く変ってしまったんです」,"""I wasn't that kind of person when I was young. It was totally different when I was young.

That's the kind of stubbornness that doctors have taken care of until now. Moms are worried at first. I thought I shouldn't move it as much as possible. That's the temperament. I'm not cured, but I'm not stubborn. It doesn't do that either. ""","“Well, it seems to me there’s no knowing what the human body’s capable of. The doctor sounded very grim, and yet look at your father today, still so hale and hearty. I was worried for a while and tried all I could to stop him from doing things.

先生が私の家いえの経済について、問いらしい問いを掛けたのはこれが始めてであった。私の方はまだ先生の暮し向きに関して、何も聞いた事がなかった。先生と知り合いになった始め、私は先生がどうして遊んでいられるかを疑うたぐった。その後もこの疑いは絶えず私の胸を去らなかった。しかし私はそんな露骨あらわな問題を先生の前に持ち出すのをぶしつけとばかり思っていつでも控えていた。若葉の色で疲れた眼を休ませていた私の心は、偶然またその疑いに触れた。,"This was the first time the teacher asked a questionable question about the economy of my house. I haven't heard anything about the teacher's lifestyle yet. When I started getting acquainted with my teacher, I wondered why he was playing. After that, this suspicion never left my heart. However, I always refrained from bringing up such a blatant problem in front of the teacher. The color of the young leaves rested my tired eyes, and my heart happened to touch the suspicion again.","It was the first time Sensei had directly asked me about my family’s financial situation. I, in turn, had never inquired about his circumstances. When I first met him, I had wondered how he could spend his days without having to work, and the question had remained with me ever since. I had kept it to myself, however, believing it would be discourteous to ask outright. As I sat here now, my weary eyes steeping in the balm of the fresh spring leaves, the question naturally occurred to me again.","This was the first time that Sensei questioned me directly about my family’s finances. And I had never asked Sensei about his source of income. Of course, I did wonder how Sensei managed to live in idleness. But I had thus far restrained myself from asking Sensei about his means of support, thinking that it would be crude to do so. Sensei’s questions made me forget the trees that I had been peacefully contemplating, and I suddenly found myself asking:"
私が帰った時は、Ｋの枕元まくらもとにもう線香が立てられていました。室へはいるとすぐ仏臭ほとけくさい烟けむりで鼻を撲うたれた私は、その烟の中に坐すわっている女二人を認めました。私がお嬢さんの顔を見たのは、昨夜来さくやらいこの時が始めてでした。お嬢さんは泣いていました。奥さんも眼を赤くしていました。事件が起ってからそれまで泣く事を忘れていた私は、その時ようやく悲しい気分に誘われる事ができたのです。私の胸はその悲しさのために、どのくらい寛くつろいだか知れません。苦痛と恐怖でぐいと握り締められた私の心に、一滴いってきの潤うるおいを与えてくれたものは、その時の悲しさでした。,"By the time I returned, incense sticks had already been erected on K's bedside pillow. As soon as I entered the room, I was struck by the smell of Buddha and my nose, and I admitted two women sitting in the smoke. It was the first time I saw her face last night. The young lady was crying. His wife also had red eyes. I had forgotten to cry since the incident happened, and at that time I was finally able to feel sad. I don't know how relaxed my chest was because of that sadness. It was the sadness at that time that gave me a drop of moisturizing in my heart, which was clenched by pain and fear.","When I returned, incense was burning beside the pillow. As I entered the room, that funereal scent assailed my nose, and I discovered mother and daughter sitting there wreathed in its smoke. This was the first time I had seen Ojōsan since the night before. She was weeping. Okusan’s eyes too were red. I had had no thought of tears until that moment, but now at last I was able to let a sensation of sorrow pervade me. Words cannot express what a comfort that was. Thanks to this grief, a touch of balm momentarily soothed my poor heart, which had been clenched tight around its fear and pain.","When I returned, I found incense sticks already burning by his pillow. Their scent, so reminiscent of death, filled the air. The two ladies were sitting in the haze. I had not seen Ojosan since the previous evening. She was crying. Okusan must have been crying too, for her eyes were red-rimmed. I, who had not remembered to shed one tear since K’s death, was able to feel sorrow then for the first time. You have no idea what comfort this gave me. My heart, which until then had felt tight with pain and fear, seemed to find relief in sorrow."
「そりゃ噓うそです」と私がいった。「奥さん自身噓と知りながらそうおっしゃるんでしょう」,"""That's a lie,"" I said. ""You say so while knowing that your wife is a lie.""","“That’s not true,” I declared. “You must know perfectly well","“That is not true,” I said. “And you know very well that that is not true.”"
「君はどう思います」と先生が聞いた。,"""What do you think?"" Asked the teacher.","“What do you think?” I was in no position to judge whether Sensei or his wife would be first to die, so I simply smiled and remarked, “Who can foretell allotted life spans?”",“What do you think?” Sensei asked me.
「私は淋さびしい人間です」と先生がいった。「だからあなたの来て下さる事を喜んでいます。だからなぜそうたびたび来るのかといって聞いたのです」,"""I'm a lonely person,"" said the teacher. ""That's why I'm glad you came. That's why I asked him why he came so often.""","“I’m a lonely man,” Sensei said, “so I’m happy that you come to visit. That ’s why I asked why you come so often.”","“I am a lonely man,” Sensei said. “And so I am glad that you come to see me. But I am also a melancholy man, and so I asked you why you should wish to visit me so often.”"
私には先生の返事があまりに平凡過ぎて詰つまらなかった。先生が調子に乗らないごとく、私も拍子抜けの気味であった。私は澄ましてさっさと歩き出した。いきおい先生は少し後おくれがちになった。先生はあとから「おいおい」と声を掛けた。,"The teacher's reply was too mediocre to me and was boring. As if the teacher wasn't feeling well, I felt like I was out of tune. I was clear and started walking quickly. Ikioi-sensei tended to be a little late. The teacher later called out, ""Hey!""","This reply struck me as tiresomely obvious. If Sensei was unwilling to take the conversation seriously, I too lost interest. I strode coolly onward, feigning indifference. The result was that Sensei dropped somewhat behind. “Hey there!” he called.","Sensei’s trite answer disappointed me. Sensei refused to be serious, and my pride was hurt. With a nonchalant air, I began to walk more quickly, leaving Sensei behind. “Hey!” he called to me."
ところが帰って見ると叔父の態度が違っています。元のように好いい顔をして私を自分の懐ふところに抱だこうとしません。それでも鷹揚おうように育った私は、帰って四、五日の間は気が付かずにいました。ただ何かの機会にふと変に思い出したのです。すると妙なのは、叔父ばかりではないのです。叔母おばも妙なのです。従妹も妙なのです。中学校を出て、これから東京の高等商業へはいるつもりだといって、手紙でその様子を聞き合せたりした叔父の男の子まで妙なのです。,"However, when I returned home, my uncle's attitude was different. I don't try to hold me in my pocket with a nice face like the original. Even so, I grew up like a falcon, and I didn't notice it for four or five days after returning. I just suddenly remembered it on some occasion. Then, it's not just my uncle that is strange. My aunt is also strange. My sister is also strange. Even my uncle's boy, who said he was going to go to higher commerce in Tokyo after leaving junior high school and heard about it by letter, is strange.","But when I got home, I discovered that my uncle’s attitude had changed. He did not embrace me with a welcoming smile as he had before. For the first four or five days I remained unaware of the change—my loving upbringing had not prepared me even to recognize coldness. Finally, however, some chance event finally brought it to my notice. I then realized in bewilderment that it was not only my uncle who had changed, but also my aunt. My cousin was also odd, and so was my uncle’s son, who had earlier written a friendly letter asking me to investigate the Industrial College he intended to enter in Tokyo once he had graduated from middle school.","My uncle’s attitude towards me, however, had changed. He did not receive me with open arms as he had done before. But being a rather easygoing sort of fellow, I did not notice this until I had been home for four or five days. Some incident or other brought it to my notice; and when I looked about me, I saw that not only had my uncle become strange, but my aunt and my cousin also. Even my uncle’s eldest son, who had not long before written to me for advice, saying that he was intending to go to a commercial college in Tokyo after his graduation from high school, seemed to behave strangely."
実際父は大丈夫らしかった。家の中を自由に往来して、息も切れなければ、眩暈めまいも感じなかった。ただ顔色だけは普通の人よりも大変悪かったが、これはまた今始まった症状でもないので、私たちは格別それを気に留めなかった。,"In fact, my father seemed okay. I could freely come and go in the house, and if I couldn't breathe, I didn't feel dizzy. Only the complexion was much worse than the average person, but this is not a symptom that has just begun, so we didn't really care about it.","And he appeared to be fine. He came and went around the house without becoming breathless or feeling dizzy. True, his color was awful, but this symptom was nothing new, so we paid it little attention.","Indeed, my father seemed well enough. He wandered about the house with no sign of strain whatsoever. He looked very pale, it is true, but since this was not a new symptom, we paid little attention to it."
私が今おる家へ引ひっ越こしたのはそれから間もなくでした。奥さんもお嬢さんも前の所にいるのを厭いやがりますし、私もその夜よの記憶を毎晩繰り返すのが苦痛だったので、相談の上移る事に極きめたのです。,"It wasn't long before I moved to my house. My wife and daughter are reluctant to be in front of me, and I had a hard time repeating the memories of that night every night, so I decided to move on after consultation.","Soon after this I moved into the house where I still live. Both Okusan and Ojōsan disliked the thought of staying in their old house, while every evening I found myself reliving the memory of that night. After some discussion, therefore, we decided to find somewhere else.","It was not long after the funeral that the three of us moved into the house where I now live. Both Okusan and Ojosan disliked the idea of staying in the old house, and I could not bear to be constantly reminded of that night."
「ああ。叔父さん、今日こんちはって、断ってはいって来ると好よかったのに」,"""Oh, uncle, I wish I had come here today and declined.""","I see.” “Yeah. You should’ve said hello and come on in, sir.”",You should have called out ‘Good-afternoon’ and then come in.”
「そう極きまった訳でもないわ。けれども男の方ほうはどうしても、そら年が上でしょう」,"""It's not that extreme, but the man is definitely older.""","“That’s not always so, by any means. But the husband is generally the older one, isn’t he?”","“Perhaps, but how can one be sure? Of course, husbands are usually older than their wives.”"
「いいえ。泥棒が来るかと思って緊張しているから退屈でもありません」,"""No. I'm not bored because I'm nervous about a thief coming.""","“No, I’m too tense at the thought of burglars to feel bored.”","I am all tense, waiting for the burglar, and so I am not at all bored.”"
私が父の枕元まくらもとを離れて、独り取り乱した書物の中に腕組みをしているところへ母が顔を出した。,My mother came out to the place where I left my father's bedside pillow and folded his arms in a distraught book.,"Once when I left my father’s bedside and went back to my room, my mother looked in and found me sitting alone, arms folded, amid my jumble of books.","My mother looked in around the door of my room, and found me sitting amongst my scattered books with my arms folded. I had not long before left my father’s bedside."
「あなたは私に責任があるんだと思ってやしませんか」と突然奥さんが聞いた。,"""Why don't you think you're responsible for me,"" suddenly asked his wife.",“Perhaps you think it’s my fault?”,"“You don’t think that I am to blame, do you?” she asked me suddenly."
先生はその上に私の家族の人数にんずを聞いたり、親類の有無を尋ねたり、叔父おじや叔母おばの様子を問いなどした。そうして最後にこういった。,"On top of that, the teacher asked about the number of people in my family, asked if they had relatives, and asked what their uncle and aunt were like. And finally, like this.","He then inquired about the number of people in the family, what relatives I had, and details of my aunts and uncles.","He went on to ask me about my other relatives, such as my uncles and aunts."
「私はそのまま二、三日過ごしました。その二、三日の間Ｋに対する絶えざる不安が私の胸を重くしていたのはいうまでもありません。私はただでさえ何とかしなければ、彼に済まないと思ったのです。その上奥さんの調子や、お嬢さんの態度が、始終私を突ッつくように刺戟しげきするのですから、私はなお辛つらかったのです。どこか男らしい気性を具そなえた奥さんは、いつ私の事を食卓でＫに素すっぱ抜かないとも限りません。それ以来ことに目立つように思えた私に対するお嬢さんの挙止動作きょしどうさも、Ｋの心を曇らす不審の種とならないとは断言できません。私は何とかして、私とこの家族との間に成り立った新しい関係を、Ｋに知らせなければならない位置に立ちました。しかし倫理的に弱点をもっていると、自分で自分を認めている私には、それがまた至難の事のように感ぜられたのです。,"""I spent a couple of days, not to mention the constant anxiety about K for those few days. I had to do something about it. I thought I couldn't do it for him. Besides, my wife's condition and the attitude of my daughter struck me from beginning to end, so I was still painful. The wife who prepared it doesn't have to pull me out at the table at the table. I can't say that it won't be a source of suspicion. I've managed to put myself in a position to inform K of the new relationship that has been established between me and this family, but with ethical weaknesses. To me, who admits myself, it felt like a difficult thing to do again.","Two or three days passed, and still I said nothing. All that time, needless to say, constant anxiety about K weighed me down. I must at least make some sort of move just to ease my conscience, I told myself. Okusan’s high spirits and Ojōsan’s manner with me were a further painful goad to action. In her forthright and unreserved way, Okusan might all too easily let something slip at the dinner table at any moment. I could never be sure, either, that K’s heart would not find cause for suspicion in the way Ojōsan had begun to behave toward me, which seemed to me worryingly obvious. All told, it was imperative to let K know how matters now stood between me and the family. Yet making such a move felt next to impossible—I was all too aware what shaky moral ground I stood on.","Needless to say, I remained very apprehensive. What made matters worse was the changed attitude of Okusan and Ojosan towards me. It acted as a constant and painful reminder of the fact that the least I could do was tell K the truth. It added to my feeling of guilt. Moreover, I was fearful lest Okusan, who had a directness of manner rarely found in women, should one evening decide to tell K the happy news when we were all gathered round the dinner table. And I could not be sure that K would not begin to brood on Ojosan’s manner, which seemed to me to have conspicuously altered. I was compelled to admit that K had to be informed of the new relationship between myself and the family. Knowing the weakness of my own position, I thought it a terrible hardship to have to face K and tell him myself."
「それのみならず私わたくしはお嬢さんの態度の少し前と変っているのに気が付きました。久しぶりで旅から帰った私たちが平生へいぜいの通り落ち付くまでには、万事について女の手が必要だったのですが、その世話をしてくれる奥さんはとにかく、お嬢さんがすべて私の方を先にして、Ｋを後廻あとまわしにするように見えたのです。それを露骨にやられては、私も迷惑したかもしれません。場合によってはかえって不快の念さえ起しかねなかったろうと思うのですが、お嬢さんの所作しょさはその点で甚だ要領を得ていたから、私は嬉うれしかったのです。つまりお嬢さんは私だけに解わかるように、持前もちまえの親切を余分に私の方へ割り宛あててくれたのです。だからＫは別に厭いやな顔もせずに平気でいました。私は心の中うちでひそかに彼に対する愷歌がいかを奏しました。,"""Not only that, I noticed that my attitude had changed a little before my daughter's attitude. By the time we returned from the trip after a long absence, by the time we settled down to Hirao, everything was a woman's hand. However, the wife who took care of it seemed that all the young ladies would put me first and leave K behind. May have bothered me too. I think it could have even caused discomfort in some cases, but I was happy because the young lady's behavior was extremely sensible in that respect. In other words, the young lady gave me an extra kindness to me so that only I could understand it. I secretly played a song about him in my heart.","Something had changed in Ojōsan’s attitude, I noticed. Both Okusan and Ojōsan set about providing us with the female care and attention that we needed to regain normalcy after our journey, but it seemed to me that Ojōsan was far more attentive to me than to K. If it had been blatant, it might have made me uncomfortable, even irritated. But I was delighted at how decorously she behaved. She devoted the greater part of her innate kindness to me in a way that only I would notice. K therefore remained oblivious and unconcerned. A gleeful song of victory sang in my heart.","Moreover, I soon noticed that Ojosan’s manner towards me had changed. After such a long absence, there was much that had to be done before we could settle down once more to our normal routine. The two ladies came to our aid. Okusan, of course, was very helpful. But what pleased me particularly was that Ojosan seemed to pay greater attention to my needs than she did to K’s. Now, if she had done so at all crudely, I should have been embarrassed. Indeed, I might even have been annoyed. But she showed great sense here, and there was only a delicate suggestion of favoritism, which made me very happy. She was kind to us both, but she simply gave me the greater share of her natural kindness, in such a way that only I noticed it. K had no reason to be annoyed therefore, and as far as he was concerned, nothing out of the ordinary had happened. I had scored a victory over K, and my heart was filled with a sense of triumph."
私は急に驚かされた。何とも返事をしなかった。,I was suddenly surprised. I didn't reply at all.,"Astonished, I made no reply.","I was surprised, and said nothing."
先生と私は通りへ出ようとして墓の間を抜けた。依撒伯拉何々イサベラなになにの墓だの、神僕しんぼくロギンの墓だのという傍かたわらに、一切衆生悉有仏生いっさいしゅじょうしつうぶっしょうと書いた塔婆とうばなどが建ててあった。全権公使何々というのもあった。私は安得烈と彫ほり付けた小さい墓の前で、「これは何と読むんでしょう」と先生に聞いた。「アンドレとでも読ませるつもりでしょうね」といって先生は苦笑した。,"The teacher and I went through the tombs trying to get out on the street. Aside from the fact that it is the grave of what isabella, the grave of the god servant Shinboku Login, there is also a stupa that says that all sentient beings are sentient beings. rice field. There were also envoys of plenipotentiary. I asked the teacher, ""How do you read this?"" In front of a small tomb that was carved with ease. The teacher laughed bitterly, saying, ""I'm sure you'll read it with Andre.""","Sensei and I walked together among the graves to the exit. One of the tombstones was inscribed with a foreign name, “Isabella So-and-so.” Another, evidently belonging to a Christian, read “Rogin, Servant of God.” Next to it stood a stupa with a quotation from the sutras: “Buddhahood is innate to all beings.” Another gravestone bore the title “Minister Plenipotentiary.” I paused at one small grave whose name I could make no sense of and asked Sensei about it. “I think that’s intended to spell the name Andrei,” he replied with a wry little smile.","We walked between tombstones on our way out. Next to those with inscriptions such as “Isabella So-and-so . . .” and “Login, Servant of God,” were those with Buddhist inscriptions such as “All living things bear within themselves the essence of Buddha.” There was one tombstone, I remember, on which was written, “Minister Plenipotentiary So-and-so.” I stopped before one that was particularly small, and pointing at the three Chinese characters on it, I asked Sensei, “How does one read that?” “I presume they are meant to be read as ‘Andrew’,” said Sensei, smiling stiffly."
無遠慮な私は、ある時ついにそれを先生の前に打ち明けた。先生は笑っていた。私はこういった。,"Reluctant, I finally confided it to my teacher. The teacher was laughing. I like this.",One day I frankly confessed as much to Sensei’s face. He was smiling as he listened.,"Being a blunt and discourteous young man, I told Sensei one day that I had often found our conversation rather inconclusive. Sensei laughed, and I said: “I would not mind so much, if I thought that you were too dull a person to realize that your remarks are often not very clear to me."
「Ｋはあまり旅へ出ない男でした。私わたくしにも房州ぼうしゅうは始めてでした。二人は何にも知らないで、船が一番先へ着いた所から上陸したのです。たしか保田ほたとかいいました。今ではどんなに変っているか知りませんが、その頃ころはひどい漁村でした。第一だいちどこもかしこも腥なまぐさいのです。それから海へ入ると、波に押し倒されて、すぐ手だの足だのを擦すり剝むくのです。拳こぶしのような大きな石が打ち寄せる波に揉もまれて、始終ごろごろしているのです。,"""K was a man who didn't travel much. I was new to Boshu. They didn't know anything and landed from where the ship arrived first. I said Hota Yasuda. I don't know how it has changed now, but it was a terrible fishing village at that time. Immediately, I rub my hands and feet and rub them off. I'm being rubbed by the waves of big stones like fists, and I'm rushing all the time.","K seldom took trips, and I had never been to Bōshū, so we both disembarked at the boat’s first port of call in complete ignorance of the place. Its name was Hota, I remember. I don’t know what it might be like today, but in those days it was a dreadful little fishing village. For one thing, the whole place stank of fish. For another, when we tried sea bathing the waves knocked us off our feet, and our arms and legs were soon covered in scratches and grazes from the fist-size rocks that were forever tumbling around in the water with us.","K had not traveled very much, and it was my first trip to Boshu. Knowing nothing about that part of the country, therefore, we got off the boat as soon as we could. We found ourselves—I remember quite clearly—in a place called Hota. It may be quite different now, but in those days it was a very unpleasant fishing village. There was the smell of fish everywhere, and whenever we tried to bathe, we were beaten down by the waves and knocked about among huge pebbles until we emerged with our hands and feet quite raw."

私の心はこの多量の紙と印気インキが、私に何事を語るのだろうかと思って驚いた。私は同時に病室の事が気にかかった。私がこのかきものを読み始めて、読み終らない前に、父はきっとどうかなる、少なくとも、私は兄からか母からか、それでなければ伯父おじからか、呼ばれるに極きまっているという予覚よかくがあった。私は落ち付いて先生の書いたものを読む気になれなかった。私はそわそわしながらただ最初の一頁ページを読んだ。その頁は下しものように綴つづられていた。,"My heart was surprised at what this large amount of paper and ink ink would tell me.

I was calm and didn't feel like reading what the teacher wrote. I was fidgeting and just read the first page. The page was spelled out like the one below.","My astonished heart wondered what this great bulk of pages and its inked writing might tell me. Simultaneously, I was anxious about what was happening in the sickroom. I was in no state of mind to settle down calmly and read Sensei’s letter —I had a strong foreboding that if I began it, something would have happened to my father before I finished, or at the least someone would call me to his bedside. Nervously, I ran my eye over the first page. This is what it said:","I was, however, too much on edge to read the whole letter properly. My mind kept wandering back to the sickroom. I had the feeling that something would happen to my father before I could finish reading the letter. At least, I was sure that I would soon be called away by my brother, or my mother, or my uncle.

先生は手に持った団扇うちわをわざとばたばたいわせた。そうしてまた奥さんを顧みた。,The teacher deliberately fluttered the fan in his hand. Then I looked back on my wife again.,"He gave his fan a few boisterous flaps, then turned to his wife.",Sensei made as much noise as he could with his fan. He then turned to his wife again.

Ｋと私は何でも話し合える中でした。偶たまには愛とか恋とかいう問題も、口に上のぼらないではありませんでしたが、いつでも抽象的な理論に落ちてしまうだけでした。それも滅多めったには話題にならなかったのです。大抵は書物の話と学問の話と、未来の事業と、抱負と、修養の話ぐらいで持ち切っていたのです。いくら親しくってもこう堅くなった日には、突然調子を崩くずせるものではありません。二人はただ堅いなりに親しくなるだけです。私はお嬢さんの事をＫに打ち明けようと思い立ってから、何遍なんべん歯がゆい不快に悩まされたか知れません。私はＫの頭のどこか一カ所を突き破って、そこから柔らかい空気を吹き込んでやりたい気がしました。,"K and I were in the middle of discussing anything. Occasionally, the issue of love or love wasn't unheard of, but it always fell into an abstract theory. It was rarely talked about. Most of the time, I was talking about books, scholarship, future projects, aspirations, and training. No matter how close you are, on a day when it gets harder, you can't suddenly get sick. The two just get close to each other. I don't know how many times I've been suffering from sickness and discomfort since I thought about telling K about my daughter. I felt like breaking through somewhere in K's head and blowing soft air from there.","On the face of it, K and I could say anything to each other. Questions of love and romance did occasionally come up, but our discussions around them always descended into abstract theory, and were in any case rare. For the most part, our conversations were confined to the subject of books and study, our future work, our aspirations, and self-improvement. As close as we were, it was difficult to break into these rigid, impersonal discussions with a personal confession. High-minded gravity was integral to our intimacy. I do not know how often I squirmed with impotent frustration at my inability to speak my heart as I had resolved to do. I longed to crack open some part of K’s mind and soften him with a breath of gentler air.","K and I were close friends, and there was little that we did not feel free to discuss with each other. On rare occasions, we would talk about love, but never was the subject allowed to go beyond abstract theorizing. And as I said, it was very seldom discussed. We hardly ever talked of matters other than our future careers, our ambitions, means of disciplining our minds, our scholarly interests, books, and so on. Though we were good friends, there was a stiff formality about our friendship, and it was difficult for me to break through this wall of formality. The character of our friendship had already been formed, and we could come closer only in a very limited way. Many times, I was on the verge of telling him about Ojosan, but always, I was checked by the insurmountable wall that stood between us. Often, in exasperation, I would feel like hammering a hole somewhere in his head, so that a gentle, warm breeze might blow into it."
「そう理屈をいわれると困る」,"""I'm in trouble if I'm told that reason""","“You’re making things difficult with that argument,” my father said unhappily.","“You embarrass me with your argumentative talk,” said my father sourly."

五、六日経たった後のち、奥さんは突然私に向って、Ｋにあの事を話したかと聞くのです。私はまだ話さないと答えました。するとなぜ話さないのかと、奥さんが私を詰なじるのです。私はこの問いの前に固くなりました。その時奥さんが私を驚かした言葉を、私は今でも忘れずに覚えています。,"After five or six days, his wife suddenly asked me if he had told K about it. I said I wouldn't talk yet. Then my wife messed with me as to why I didn't talk. I got hard before this question. I still remember the words that my wife surprised me at that time.","Five or six days later, Okusan suddenly inquired whether I had told K about it. Not yet, I replied. Why not? she asked reproachfully. I froze. The shock of her next words has seared them into my memory.","It was five or six days later that Okusan suddenly asked me: “Have you told K about the engagement?” “Not yet,” I answered. “Why not?” she demanded. I felt my whole body stiffen. I said nothing. “No wonder he looked so odd when I told him,” she said. Her words shocked me."
私のこの注意を父は愉快そうにしかし極きわめて軽く受けた。,My dad received this attention happily but very lightly.,All I have to do is take the usual care.”,"He brushed aside my admonition, and said cheerfully:"
三,three,CHAPTER 57,"And I shall be satisfied if, when my heart stops beating, a new life lodges itself in your breast."
父の元気は次第に衰えて行った。私わたくしを驚かせたハンケチ付きの古い麦藁帽子むぎわらぼうしが自然と閑却かんきゃくされるようになった。私は黒い煤すすけた棚の上に載のっているその帽子を眺ながめるたびに、父に対して気の毒な思いをした。父が以前のように、軽々と動く間は、もう少し慎つつしんでくれたらと心配した。父が凝じっと坐すわり込むようになると、やはり元の方が達者だったのだという気が起った。私は父の健康についてよく母と話し合った。,"My father's energy gradually declined. The old straw hat with a handkerchief that surprised me was naturally dismissed. Every time I looked at the hat on the black soot shelf, I felt sorry for my father. I was worried that my dad would be a little more modest while he was moving lightly, as he used to. When my father began to sit down, I realized that he was a master. I often talked with my mother about my father's health.","Slowly my father’s health and spirits declined. His big straw hat with its handkerchief, the one that had taken me by surprise when I first arrived, now lay neglected. Whenever I caught sight of it on the soot-blackened shelf I was filled with pity for him. While he still managed to be up and about with ease, I anxiously cautioned him to take things more carefully. Now, seeing him sitting pensive and silent, I realized he had indeed been relatively well before. My mother and I had many discussions about it.","My father’s health grew steadily worse. The old straw hat with the handkerchief attached to it, which had so amazed me when I first saw it on my father, now was laid aside. And every time I saw it lying on the smoke-blackened shelf, I felt pity for him. Before, when he had been active, I had wished that he would not move about so much. But I hated to see him lose his old vigor, and to find him sitting about the house so quietly. My mother and I talked often of my father’s health."
母はまた母で先生の返事の来るのを苦にしていた。,My mother was also annoyed by the teacher's reply.,"But as far as actual money goes, it won’t amount to much, I’m sure.”","As for my mother, she waited anxiously for the arrival of Sensei’s reply."
父が変な黄色いものも嘔はいた時、私はかつて先生と奥さんから聞かされた危険を思い出した。「ああして長く寝ているんだから胃も悪くなるはずだね」といった母の顔を見て、何も知らないその人の前に涙ぐんだ。,"When my dad was vomiting strange yellow things, I remembered the danger that my teacher and wife once told me. When I saw my mother's face saying, ""Oh, I've been sleeping for a long time, my stomach should be sick,"" and I cried in front of the person who didn't know anything.","Not long afterward my father vomited a strange yellow substance, and I recalled the danger that Sensei and his wife had spoken of. “His stomach must be upset from being bedridden for so long,” my mother concluded. Tears came to my eyes to see how little she understood.","When my father vomited some strange, yellow matter, I remembered Sensei’s and his wife’s warnings. “He has been lying in his bed for so long, no wonder his stomach is upset,” said my mother. I could not help the tears in my eyes as I looked at her."
「つまり、おれが結構という事になるのさ。おれはお前の知ってる通りの病気だろう。去年の冬お前に会った時、ことによるともう三月みつきか四月よつきぐらいなものだろうと思っていたのさ。それがどういう仕合しあわせか、今日までこうしている。起居たちいに不自由なくこうしている。そこへお前が卒業してくれた。だから嬉うれしいのさ。せっかく丹精たんせいした息子が、自分のいなくなった後あとで卒業してくれるよりも、丈夫なうちに学校を出てくれる方が親の身になれば嬉うれしいだろうじゃないか。大きな考えをもっているお前から見たら、高たかが大学を卒業したぐらいで、結構だ結構だといわれるのは余り面白くもないだろう。しかしおれの方から見てご覧、立場が少し違っているよ。つまり卒業はお前に取ってより、このおれに取って結構なんだ。解ったかい」,"""That means I'm fine. I'm sick as you know. When I met you last winter, maybe it's about March or April. I was thinking about it. I've been doing this until today to see what it's like. I'm doing this without any inconvenience to the people who lived there. You graduated there. So I'm glad. It would be nice if my son could be a parent if he could leave school while he was strong, rather than graduating after he was gone. From the perspective of you who have a big idea. It wouldn't be very interesting to say that I was graduated from college and that it was fine, but from my point of view, my position is a little different. In other words, graduation is for you. It's fine for me. Did you understand? ""","it’s fine for me personally. You know about this illness of mine. When I saw you in the winter, at the end of last year, I had a feeling I might not last more than three or four more months. And here I am, still doing so well. It’s wonderful. I can still get around without any trouble. And now you’ve graduated as well. That’s why I’m happy, see? “You must realize how it pleases me that this son of mine, whom I raised with such love and care, should graduate while I’m still alive and well to witness it. Having someone make such a fuss about a mere graduation must seem boring to you, with all your aspirations—I can see that. But stand in my shoes, and you’ll see it a bit differently. What I’m saying is, it’s a fine thing for me, if not for you, don’t you see?”","“You see, I am glad for my own sake. As you know, I am a sick man. When you were home last winter, I was convinced that I had no more than three or four months left to live. Providentially, I am still alive, and am able to potter about comfortably. And now, you have graduated. I am happy because you, who have worked so hard at your studies, managed to graduate before I died, and while I was in good health. Surely, I, as your father, have reason to be happy. Of course, you have bigger ideas than I, and it must annoy you to see me fuss over such an insignificant thing as your graduation. But try to look at it from my point of view. I am glad, not so much for your sake, as for my own. Do you understand?”"
四,four,CHAPTER 40,"I brought out the books from my suitcase, and in the silent, old house, too large for the three of us, I began to read them."
私はその手紙を出す時に決して先生の返事を予期していなかった。出した後で父や母と先生の噂うわさなどをしながら、遥はるかに先生の書斎を想像した。,"I never expected the teacher's reply when I wrote the letter. After putting it out, I imagined the teacher's study far away while making rumors about my father, mother and teacher.","I wrote this letter without any expectation that Sensei would reply. Then I told my parents about him, and as I spoke, the image of Sensei’s distant study hovered before me.","I wrote the letter with no expectation of receiving a reply from Sensei. After I had posted it, I told my parents about him. And as I did so, I found myself thinking of Sensei in his study."
先生の態度はむしろ落ち付いていた。声はむしろ沈んでいた。けれどもその表情の中うちには判然はっきりいえないような一種の曇りがあった。,"The teacher's attitude was rather calm. The voice was rather sunk. However, there was a kind of cloudiness in the expression that could not be clearly stated.",He seemed quite calm. His voice was quiet. But a shadow seemed to cloud his face.,"He seemed quite relaxed as he stood there, and his voice was calm. But there was on his face a strangely clouded expression."

先生は奥さんを呼んで、必要の金額を私の前に並べさせてくれた。それを奥の茶簞笥ちゃだんすか何かの抽出ひきだしから出して来た奥さんは、白い半紙の上へ鄭寧ていねいに重ねて、「そりゃご心配ですね」といった。,"The teacher called his wife to arrange the required amount in front of me. The wife, who came out of it from the tea chest of drawers in the back or some extraction drawer, carefully layered it on a white calligraphy and said, ""That's worrisome.""","He called his wife and asked her to bring the money. She produced it from the drawer of some cupboard in the far room and presented it to me, placed formally on a sheet of white paper. “This must be very worrying for you,” she said.","Sensei called his wife, and asked her to bring the money. She returned, and politely placing the money on a sheet of white paper, said, “You must be worried.”"
私は二人の間にできたたった一人の男の子でした。宅うちには相当の財産があったので、むしろ鷹揚おうように育てられました。私は自分の過去を顧みて、あの時両親が死なずにいてくれたなら、少なくとも父か母かどっちか、片方で好いいから生きていてくれたなら、私はあの鷹揚な気分を今まで持ち続ける事ができたろうにと思います。,"I was the only boy between them. I had a lot of fortune in my house, so I was raised to fly. I look back on my past, and if my parents didn't die at that time, at least if my father or mother lived because I liked one of them, I've always felt that uplifting mood. I think I could have kept it.","I was their only son. The family was quite wealthy, so I was brought up in considerable comfort. Looking back, I now think that if my parents had not died when they did—if one of them, it does not matter which, had continued to be there to support me—I would have remained as generous and easygoing as I was in those days.","I was their only son.

奥さんは眼の中うちに涙をいっぱい溜ためた。,His wife had a lot of tears in her eyes.,Tears brimmed in her eyes.,"As Sensei’s wife said this, I noticed that there were tears in her eyes."

This was a long-standing promise that if I graduated, the supper of the day wouldn't have to eat outside, but at the teacher's table.","That evening I was to dine at Sensei’s house. We had agreed beforehand that if I managed to graduate, I would keep the evening free for a celebratory dinner at his home.","That evening, I went to Sensei’s house for dinner.

Ｋと私とはそれぎり寝てしまいました。そうしてその翌あくる日からまた普通の行商ぎょうしょうの態度に返って、うんうん汗を流しながら歩き出したのです。しかし私は路々みちみちその晩の事をひょいひょいと思い出しました。私にはこの上もない好いい機会が与えられたのに、知らない振ふりをしてなぜそれをやり過ごしたのだろうという悔恨の念が燃えたのです。私は人間らしいという抽象的な言葉を用いる代りに、もっと直截ちょくせつで簡単な話をＫに打ち明けてしまえば好かったと思い出したのです。実をいうと、私がそんな言葉を創造したのも、お嬢さんに対する私の感情が土台になっていたのですから、事実を蒸溜じょうりゅうして拵こしらえた理論などをＫの耳に吹き込むよりも、原もとの形かたちそのままを彼の眼の前に露出した方が、私にはたしかに利益だったでしょう。私にそれができなかったのは、学問の交際が基調を構成している二人の親しみに、自おのずから一種の惰性があったため、思い切ってそれを突き破るだけの勇気が私に欠けていたのだという事をここに自白します。気取り過ぎたといっても、虚栄心が祟たたったといっても同じでしょうが、私のいう気取るとか虚栄とかいう意味は、普通のとは少し違います。それがあなたに通じさえすれば、私は満足なのです。,"K and I fell asleep. Then, from the next day, I returned to the normal attitude of a business person and started walking while sweating. However, I remembered the night on the road. I was given the best opportunity, but I regretted why I pretended I didn't know and overcame it. Instead of using the abstract word human, I remembered that I should have confided to K a more straightforward and simple story. To tell the truth, the reason why I coined such a word was because my feelings toward the young lady were the foundation, so rather than injecting the theory of distilling the facts into K's ears. It would certainly have been beneficial to me to expose the original shape in front of his eyes. What I couldn't do was that I didn't have the courage to take the plunge because the friendship between the two, whose academic dating was the keynote, had a kind of inertia on their own. I confess that it is here. It's the same as being overly pretentious or vanity, but my meaning of pretending or vanity is a little different from normal. As long as it leads to you, I'm happy.","With this, we both went to sleep. The following morning we returned to business as usual and set off again to plod on our sweaty way. But my mind kept going back over the previous night’s events. I burned with regret—why had I passed up the perfect opportunity to say at last what was on my mind? Rather than employ an abstraction such as human, I should have made a clean and direct confession to K. And truly it was my feelings for Ojōsan that had prompted me to start using this word in the first place, so it would have been more to the point to reveal to K the facts that lay behind my argument rather than belabor him with its theoretical distillation. Our relationship was so firmly defined by lofty scholarly exchange , I must admit, that I lacked the courage to break through it. I could explain this failing as that of affectation, or as the result of vanity, although what I mean by these words is not quite their normal interpretation. I only hope you will understand what I am saying here.","K and I went to bed. The next day, we resumed our sweaty and tortuous walk. Once more, our relationship became like that of two peddlers on the road. During the walk, however, I thought now and then of the argument of the night before, and cursed myself for having missed such a good opportunity to confide in him. I should have been more honest, I said to myself, and instead of criticizing him for not being human and so on, I should have admitted to him openly the true cause of my grievance. After all, it was Ojosan that was at the bottom of my troubles, and, for my own good, I should not have tried to hide this fact under half-true generalities. But, I must confess, the tone of our friendship had become intellectualized, and I did not have the courage to rebel openly against the established pattern of our relationship. You may attribute this weakness on my part to affectation or vanity. So long as you try to understand that it was not the ordinary kind of affectation or vanity, I shall not mind."

I'm happy even if I think I'm crazy.","I will be leaving my wife behind, but fortunately she will not want for the necessities of life. I do not want her to witness any horror. I intend to die in such a way that she will not have to see blood. I will leave the world quietly, without her knowing. I would like to have her believe that I died instantaneously.

父はこの前の冬に帰って来た時ほど将棋しょうぎを差したがらなくなった。将棋盤はほこりの溜たまったまま、床とこの間まの隅に片寄せられてあった。ことに陛下のご病気以後父は凝じっと考え込んでいるように見えた。毎日新聞の来るのを待ち受けて、自分が一番先へ読んだ。それからその読よみがらをわざわざ私のいる所へ持って来てくれた。,"My dad was less reluctant to play shogi than when he came back last winter.

Then he took the trouble to bring the reading to where I was.","My father was not as keen on playing shōgi as he had been the previous winter.

二人は別に行く所もなかったので、竜岡町たつおかちょうから池いけの端はたへ出て、上野うえのの公園の中へ入りました。その時彼は例の事件について、突然向うから口を切りました。前後の様子を綜合そうごうして考えると、Ｋはそのために私をわざわざ散歩に引ひっ張ぱり出だしたらしいのです。けれども彼の態度はまだ実際的の方面へ向ってちっとも進んでいませんでした。彼は私に向って、ただ漠然と、どう思うというのです。どう思うというのは、そうした恋愛の淵ふちに陥おちいった彼を、どんな眼で私が眺ながめるかという質問なのです。一言いちごんでいうと、彼は現在の自分について、私の批判を求めたいようなのです。そこに私は彼の平生へいぜいと異なる点を確かに認める事ができたと思いました。たびたび繰り返すようですが、彼の天性は他ひとの思わくを憚はばかるほど弱くでき上ってはいなかったのです。こうと信じたら一人でどんどん進んで行くだけの度胸もあり勇気もある男なのです。養家ようか事件でその特色を強く胸の裏うちに彫ほり付けられた私が、これは様子が違うと明らかに意識したのは当然の結果なのです。,"The two of us had nowhere to go, so we went out from Tatsuokacho Tatsuokacho to the end of the pond and entered the park in Ueno, Ueno. At that time, he suddenly turned away about the incident. Thinking about the situation before and after, it seems that K took the trouble to take a walk for that reason. But his attitude hasn't made any progress towards the practical. He just vaguely thinks about me. What I think is the question of how I look at him who has fallen into the edge of such a love affair. In a nutshell, he wants to seek my criticism of what he is today. I thought that I could certainly admit that he was different from his normal life. It seems to repeat often, but his innateness was not ridiculously weak in the minds of others. He is a man who has the courage and courage to go on alone if he believes in this. It is only natural that I, who was strongly engraved in the back of my chest in the case of the foster family, clearly realized that this was a different situation.","We had no particular destination in mind, so we walked through Tatsuoka-chō to Ikenohata and on into Ueno Park. There K suddenly broached the subject that lay between us. All things considered, it seemed obvious that he had invited me out for a walk for this purpose. But he still showed no evidence of moving toward a plan of action. “What do you think?” he asked. What he wanted to know was how I saw him, knowing the depths of love to which he had succumbed. He was, in other words, seeking a critical evaluation of his present state. I could tell from this how unlike his usual self he was. Let me remind you that he had none of that weakness of character that makes most people concerned with what others are thinking. He had the kind of daring and courage that would simply press ahead once he’d decided something. I had all too vivid memories of this characteristic from the time of his family troubles, so the difference in his present behavior was quite clear to me.","We had no particular destination in mind. We walked through Tatsuokacho towards Ikenohata, and then went into Ueno Park. He suddenly began to talk about the affair. Judging by the way he introduced the subject, it would seem that he had asked me out specifically for the purpose of talking to me about it. I learned that the situation had remained unchanged for all practical purposes since the time of his confession to me. “What do you think?” he asked vaguely. What he wished to know was how I regarded him, who had fallen so deeply in love. He wanted my opinion of him as he was then. I felt that this desire of his to find out what I thought of him was a sure indication that he was not altogether his usual self. I want to emphasize here—though you may think me rather repetitious—that K was normally an independent-minded fellow, and what others thought of him worried him very little. He had the courage and strength to do anything if he thought he was right. I saw this trait in him only too clearly in his dealings with his foster parents. No wonder, then, that I thought his question in the park rather out of character."
「どこへ」,"""where""",“Where to?”,“Walk? Where?”
待ち合わせるために振り向いて立たち留どまった私の顔を見て、先生はこういった。,"Looking at my face, who turned around to meet and stayed, the teacher said:",He was looking me in the eye.,"I had turned around to wait for Sensei, and as he spoke, he looked straight into my eyes."
「こんな風ふうにして歩いていると、暑さと疲労とで自然身体からだの調子が狂って来るものです。もっとも病気とは違います。急に他ひとの身体の中へ、自分の霊魂が宿替やどがえをしたような気分になるのです。私わたくしは平生へいぜいの通りＫと口を利ききながら、どこかで平生の心持と離れるようになりました。彼に対する親しみも憎しみも、旅中りょちゅう限かぎりという特別な性質を帯おびる風になったのです。つまり二人は暑さのため、潮しおのため、また歩行のため、在来と異なった新しい関係に入る事ができたのでしょう。その時の我々はあたかも道づれになった行商ぎょうしょうのようなものでした。いくら話をしてもいつもと違って、頭を使う込み入った問題には触れませんでした。,"""If you walk like this, the heat and fatigue will make your body go crazy. It's not the same as illness. Suddenly, your soul dwells in another person's body. It makes me feel like I've been replaced or sick. I've been talking to him as K at best, but somewhere I've become separated from his feelings. I hate his friendship. However, during the trip, the wind became a special property that was limited to the limit. In other words, because of the heat, because of the tide, and because of walking, a new relationship different from the conventional one. We could have entered. At that time, we were like a wandering business. No matter how much we talked, we wouldn't touch the complicated problems of using our heads. It was.","With all this walking, the heat and weariness inevitably took their toll on us. It’s not that we were actually ill; rather it was the disturbing feeling that one’s soul had suddenly moved on to inhabit someone else. Though I continued to talk to K as normal, I felt anything but normal. Both our intimacy and the antagonism I felt toward him took on a special quality that was peculiar to this journey. I suppose what I am saying is that, what with the heat, the sea, and the walking, we entered a different kind of relationship. We became for the moment like nothing so much as a couple of wandering peddlers who had fallen in with each other on the road. For all our talk, we never once broached the complex intellectual topics that we usually discussed.","Such strenuous walking in the heat cannot but affect one’s body. It is not like being ill. Rather, one feels as though one’s soul has found for itself a strange home. I talked to K as usual, but my feelings had somehow changed. My affection and my hatred for K acquired a character peculiar to that journey on foot. What I mean is that perhaps because of the heat, the swimming, and the walking, our relationship shifted temporarily to a different plane. We were like two far-traveling peddlers who had met by chance on the road. We talked to each other, but we said nothing that was of serious concern to us. In this way, we finally reached Choshi."
七,Seven,CHAPTER 7,I thought his behavior very strange.
「でもどのくらいあったら先生のようにしていられるか、宅うちへ帰って一つ父に談判する時の参考にしますから聞かして下さい」,"""But please tell me how long you can be like a teacher, because I will use it as a reference when I go home and talk to my father.""","“I’d like to know, so that when I go home and talk to my father, I’ll have some idea of how much I’d need to live as Sensei does.”","“But I want to know what sum will be sufficient to enable me to live as Sensei does, so that when I speak to my father about my inheritance, I shall have some idea of what I want.”"
父は傍はたのものを辛つらくするほどの苦痛をどこにも感じていなかった。その点になると看病はむしろ楽であった。要心のために、誰か一人ぐらいずつ代る代る起きてはいたが、あとのものは相当の時間に各自めいめいの寝床へ引き取って差支さしつかえなかった。何かの拍子で眠れなかった時、病人の唸うなるような声を微かすかに聞いたと思い誤った私わたくしは、一遍ぺん半夜よなかに床を抜け出して、念のため父の枕元まくらもとまで行ってみた事があった。その夜よは母が起きている番に当っていた。しかしその母は父の横に肱ひじを曲げて枕としたなり寝入っていた。父も深い眠りの裏うちにそっと置かれた人のように静かにしていた。私は忍び足でまた自分の寝床へ帰った。,"My dad didn't feel any pain near him to the point of making things painful. At that point, nursing was rather easy. For the sake of my heart, I was waking up one by one, but the rest could be taken to my bed for a considerable amount of time. When I couldn't sleep because of some rhythm, I misunderstood that I heard the roaring voice of the sick person faintly. I've been to. That night it was my mother's turn to wake up. However, the mother bent her elbows next to her father to make a pillow and fell asleep. My father was as quiet as a man who was quietly placed behind a deep sleep. I sneaked back to my bed again.","He was completely free of the kind of pain that is a torture for others to witness—in this way at least, he was easy to nurse. We took care to ensure that someone was always taking his turn by the bedside, but the rest of us could usually settle down to sleep at a reasonable hour. Once when I couldn’t get to sleep for some reason, I mistakenly thought I heard my father faintly groaning. I slipped out of bed in the middle of the night and went to check on him. That evening it was my mother’s turn to stay up with him. I found her asleep beside him, her head resting on her crooked arm. My father lay peacefully at her side, like one laid gently down inside a deep sleep. I tiptoed back to bed again.","He was not in great pain, and we were thus spared the strain of having to watch him suffer. From this point of view, nursing him was a relatively easy task. True, each one of us in turn stayed up at night to keep watch over him, but the rest of us were free to go to bed at a reasonable hour. One night, it so happened that I found difficulty in going to sleep. As I lay in my bed, I thought that I heard the faint sound of my father groaning. To make sure that there was nothing amiss, I got up and went to his room. It was my mother’s turn to stay up that night. I found her asleep on the floor by his bedside, with her head resting on her bent arm. My father was absolutely still, as though someone had gently lowered him into a world of deep sleep. Softly, I went back to my bed."
国元からＫの父と兄が出て来た時、私はＫの遺骨をどこへ埋うめるかについて自分の意見を述べました。私は彼の生前に雑司ヶ谷ぞうしがや近辺をよくいっしょに散歩した事があります。Ｋにはそこが大変気に入っていたのです。それで私は笑談じょうだん半分はんぶんに、そんなに好きなら死んだらここへ埋めてやろうと約束した覚えがあるのです。私も今その約束通りＫを雑司ヶ谷へ葬ほうむったところで、どのくらいの功徳くどくになるものかとは思いました。けれども私は私の生きている限り、Ｋの墓の前に跪ひざまずいて月々私の懺悔ざんげを新たにしたかったのです。今まで構い付けなかったＫを、私が万事世話をして来たという義理もあったのでしょう、Ｋの父も兄も私のいう事を聞いてくれました。,"When K's father and brother came out of Kunimoto, I gave my opinion on where to bury K's remains. I used to take a walk with Zoshigaya Zoshigaya in the vicinity before he was alive. I really liked that for K. So I remember half-laughing and promising to bury it here if I like it so much. I also wondered how much merit would be if I buried K in Zoshigaya as promised. But as long as I was alive, I wanted to kneel in front of K's tomb and renew my confession every month. Maybe there was a step that I took care of everything about K, which I hadn't taken care of until now, and K's father and brother listened to me.","When K’s father and brother arrived, I told them my own views on where I thought he should be buried. K and I had often walked around the Zōshigaya cemetery together, and he was extremely fond of the place. I had once promised him half-jokingly that if he died, I would bury him there. I did ask myself what good it would do me to fulfill this pledge to him now. But I wanted him buried close by, for I was determined to return to his grave every month for the rest of my life and kneel before it in renewed penitence and shame. They let me have my way, no doubt acknowledging the important role I had played in the care of their estranged brother and son.","When K’s father and elder brother arrived, I gave my opinion as to where he should be buried. K and I had often walked to Zoshigaya. K was very fond of the place. I remembered saying to him jokingly: “All right, I’ll see to it that you’re buried here.” I thought to myself. “What good will it do now to remember my promise to K?” But I wanted K to be buried in Zoshigaya, so that I could visit his grave every month and ask his forgiveness. His father and brother raised no objections."
話は簡単でかつ明瞭めいりょうに片付いてしまいました。最初からしまいまでにおそらく十五分とは掛かからなかったでしょう。奥さんは何の条件も持ち出さなかったのです。親類に相談する必要もない、後から断ればそれで沢山だといいました。本人の意嚮いこうさえたしかめるに及ばないと明言しました。そんな点になると、学問をした私の方が、かえって形式に拘泥こうでいするくらいに思われたのです。親類はとにかく、当人にはあらかじめ話して承諾を得うるのが順序らしいと私が注意した時、奥さんは「大丈夫です。本人が不承知の所へ、私があの子をやるはずがありませんから」といいました。,"The story was simple and clear. It probably didn't take fifteen minutes from the beginning to the end. The wife didn't bring up any conditions. He said he didn't have to talk to his relatives, and if he refused later, that would be a lot. He stated that it was not enough to confirm his intention. When it came to that point, it seemed that I, who had studied, was rather obsessed with the format. Anyway, when I noticed that it was the order for relatives to talk to the person in advance and get consent, the wife said, ""It's okay. I can't give that child to a place he doesn't know. ""said.","And so the question was settled, straightforwardly and without fuss. It would have taken no more than fifteen minutes from beginning to end. Okusan demanded no conditions. It would not be necessary to consult the relatives, she maintained. All she had to do was inform them of the decision. She even stated that there was no need to consult the wishes of Ojōsan herself. Here I balked—educated man though I was , I was apparently the more conventional in such matters. As for the relatives, I said, I would leave that up to her, but surely the right thing to do next was to gain the girl’s consent. “Please don’t worry,” Okusan replied. “I wouldn’t make her marry anyone she didn’t want to.”","She is, as you know, a wretched, fatherless child.” I do not think that the entire conversation lasted more than fifteen minutes. It remained simple and direct throughout. Okusan made no stipulations. She said that there was no need to consult her relatives, though of course she would have to inform them of the decision. She seemed also to take it for granted that her daughter would raise no objections. I had some misgivings here. Despite my education, I must have been the more conventional of the two: I said, “I don’t care about the relatives, but don’t you think you should ask Ojosan first?” She assured me that there was no need for me to worry. She had no intentions, she said, of forcing her daughter to marry anyone she did not like."
「そりゃ慥たしかです。私わたしはさっき二十分ばかり枕元まくらもとに坐すわって色々話してみたが、調子の狂ったところは少しもないです。あの様子じゃことによるとまだなかなか持つかも知れませんよ」,"""That's a shame. I just sat down at the bedside pillow for about 20 minutes and talked a lot, but there's nothing wrong with it. Maybe I still have it. I don't. ""","“He understands just fine,” chimed in my sister’s husband, who had arrived at about the same time. “I spent twenty minutes or so at his bedside talking about this and that, and there was no sign of a problem. He may well last a while yet, to judge from how he seems.”","“Certainly,” I said. “He understands perfectly well. Why, only a short time ago, I talked to him about all sorts of things for about twenty minutes, and it was obvious then that he was in full possession of his faculties. At this rate, it is possible that he will be with us for quite a while yet.” My brother-in-law, who had arrived at about the same time as my brother, was more optimistic than any of us."
父は自分の眼の前に薄暗く映る死の影を眺めながら、まだ遺言ゆいごんらしいものを口に出さなかった。,"While looking at the dim shadow of death in front of his eyes, my father hadn't said anything like a will.","Though the dark shadow of death hovered before his eyes, my father still did not speak of how he wished his estate to be managed after death.","Even when death was casting its dark-grey shadow over my father’s eyes, he said nothing about a will."
「私が書物ばかり買うのを見て、奥さんは少し着物を拵こしらえろといいました。私は実際田舎いなかで織った木綿もめんものしかもっていなかったのです。その頃ころの学生は絹いとの入はいった着物を肌に着けませんでした。私の友達に横浜よこはまの商人あきんどか何なにかで、宅うちはなかなか派出はでに暮しているものがありましたが、そこへある時羽二重はぶたえの胴着どうぎが配達で届いた事があります。すると皆みんながそれを見て笑いました。その男は恥ずかしがって色々弁解しましたが、折角せっかくの胴着を行李こうりの底へ放ほうり込んで利用しないのです。それをまた大勢が寄ってたかって、わざと着せました。すると運悪くその胴着に蝨しらみがたかりました。友達はちょうど幸さいわいとでも思ったのでしょう、評判の胴着をぐるぐると丸めて、散歩に出たついでに、根津ねづの大きな泥溝どぶの中へ棄すててしまいました。その時いっしょに歩いていた私は、橋の上に立って笑いながら友達の所作しょさを眺ながめていましたが、私の胸のどこにも勿体もったいないという気は少しも起りませんでした。,"""When I saw that I bought only books, my wife told me to make a little kimono. I actually only had cotton woven in the countryside. At that time, the students were silk. I couldn't put on the kimono that I got in. One of my friends was a merchant of Yokohama yokohama, Akindo, and some of them lived in the countryside, but when I was there, Habutai. Shige had received a habutai bodice on delivery. Then everyone laughed at it. The man was shy and made various excuses, but he put on his bodice at the bottom of the silk. I don't throw it in and don't use it. I put it on purpose because a lot of people wanted to come in again. Then, unfortunately, I was glaring at the bodice. I rolled up my kimono and threw it into the big mud ditch of Nezu Nezu while I went out for a walk. I was walking with him at that time, standing on the bridge and laughing. I was looking at my friend's behavior, but I didn't feel like it was a waste anywhere in my heart.","I spent my money on nothing but books. Okusan told me I should get some clothes, and it was true, all I had were the country-woven cotton robes that had been made for me back home. Students in those days never wore anything with silk in it. One of my friends, who came from a wealthy family of Yokohama merchants who did things extravagantly, was once sent an underrobe of fine silk. We all laughed at it. He produced all sorts of shamefaced excuses and tossed it unworn into his trunk, till we gathered around one day and bullied him into wearing it. Unfortunately, the thing became infested with lice. This was a lucky break for my friend, who bundled it up and carried it off on one of his walks, where he threw it into the large ditch in Nezu. I was with him, and I remember standing on the bridge laughing as I watched him. It never crossed my mind that this was a wasteful thing to do.","Seeing me buy nothing but books, Okusan said that I should buy myself some new clothes. Indeed, all the clothes that I possessed had been made at home, of cotton woven locally. It was not the custom for students to wear silk in those days. I remember that a friend of mine once received a heavy silk garment from home. His father, incidentally, was a Yokohama merchant whose tastes were rather ostentatious. When the garment arrived, we all laughed at the fellow. He was quite embarrassed, and made all sorts of excuses. He tossed it into his trunk, and would not put it on. We finally bullied him into wearing it. Unfortunately, it caught fleas from somewhere. My friend must have been pleased, for he wasted no time in getting rid of the famous garment. He rolled it up into a bundle, and taking it with him on one of his walks, threw it into the large ditch in Nezu. I was with him at the time. I remember standing on the bridge and watching my friend with amusement. It never occurred to me then to think that he was being wasteful."

伯父おじが見舞に来たとき、父はいつまでも引き留めて帰さなかった。淋さむしいからもっといてくれというのが重おもな理由であったが、母や私が、食べたいだけ物を食べさせないという不平を訴えるのも、その目的の一つであったらしい。,"When my uncle came to visit me, my father kept him indefinitely. The main reason was that he was lonely, so he asked me to stay longer, but it seems that one of the purposes was for my mother and I to complain that we wouldn't let them eat as much as we wanted.","My uncle paid my father a visit, and as he rose to leave, my father held him back, loath to let him go home. He said it was because he was lonely, but he also seemed to want to complain to someone about how my mother and I weren’t giving him enough to eat.","When my uncle called, my father would not let him go. He wished him to stay mostly because he was lonely, of course, but I suspected also that he wanted someone to complain to about our reluctance to give him the kind of food he craved."
私はＫと同じような返事を彼の義兄宛あてで出しました。その中うちに、万一の場合には私がどうでもするから、安心するようにという意味を強い言葉で書き現わしました。これは固もとより私の一存いちぞんでした。Ｋの行先ゆくさきを心配するこの姉に安心を与えようという好意は無論含まれていましたが、私を軽蔑けいべつしたとより外ほかに取りようのない彼の実家や養家ようかに対する意地もあったのです。,"I sent a reply similar to K to his brother-in-law. In the meantime, I wrote in strong words the meaning of being relieved because I wouldn't care in the unlikely event. This was my life from the beginning. Of course, there was a favor to give peace of mind to this older sister who was worried about K's destination, but there was also a willingness to despise me and to take his parents' home and foster home. There was.","I replied to her husband along similar lines and assured him firmly that if problems arose, I would help in any way I could. This was something I had long since decided. My words were intended partly as a friendly reassurance to the sister who was so worried about him, but also as a gesture of defiance toward the two families whom I felt had snubbed me. K’s adoption was annulled in his first year of university studies.","I wrote a reply to the brother-in-law, repeating more or less what K had already said in his letters. I did add, however, a strongly worded assurance that K could always count on my assistance whenever it was necessary. I was, of course, sincere in my assurance. I felt too that I should try to comfort K’s sister as best I could. But there is no doubt that in insisting so strongly that I would and could assist K, I was also being indirectly spiteful to his father and to his foster parents, who had , it seemed, treated me with contempt."
私はそれを封じて出す前に母に向かっていった。,I went to my mother before I sealed it out.,"Before I sealed it, I said to my mother, “I’ve written to Sensei, just as you wanted.","Before I sealed the letter, I went up to my mother and said:"
父の病気は同じような状態で一週間以上つづいた。私わたくしはその間に長い手紙を九州にいる兄宛あてで出した。妹いもとへは母から出させた。私は腹の中で、おそらくこれが父の健康に関して二人へやる最後の音信たよりだろうと思った。それで両方へいよいよという場合には電報を打つから出て来いという意味を書き込めた。,"My father's illness continued for more than a week in a similar condition. In the meantime, I wrote a long letter to my brother in Kyushu. I let my sister take it out from my mother. In my stomach, I thought this was probably the last message I gave them about my father's health. So when I finally said to both, I could write the meaning of coming out from sending a telegram.","My father’s condition remained unchanged for over a week. During that time I sent a long letter to my brother in Kyushu and asked my mother to write to my sister. I had a strong feeling that these would probably be the last letters detailing to them my father’s state of health.

I opened the partition of the room, and my brazier had only white cold ash left, and even the konjac folds were exhausted. I suddenly became unpleasant.","It was a cold, rainy day in November. Sodden in my overcoat, I made my way as usual past the fierce Enma image that stands in Genkaku Temple1 and up the hill to the house. K’s room was deserted, but his charcoal brazier was newly lit.

My mood quickly shifted to one of displeasure.","On a cold, rainy day in November, I walked home as usual through the grounds of the temple of Konnyaku-Emma and up the narrow lane that led to the house.

私は下宿へ帰ってからも一種の圧迫を感じた。,I felt a kind of oppression even after returning to the boarding house.,"Even after I returned to my lodgings that evening, my memory of this conversation continued to oppress me.",I returned to my lodgings with an oppressive feeling—like a sense of doom—inside me.
同時に私はＫの死因を繰り返し繰り返し考えたのです。その当座は頭がただ恋の一字で支配されていたせいでもありましょうが、私の観察はむしろ簡単でしかも直線的でした。Ｋは正まさしく失恋のために死んだものとすぐ極きめてしまったのです。しかし段々落ち付いた気分で、同じ現象に向ってみると、そう容易たやすくは解決が着かないように思われて来ました。現実と理想の衝突、――それでもまだ不充分でした。私はしまいにＫが私のようにたった一人で淋さむしくって仕方がなくなった結果、急に所決しょけつしたのではなかろうかと疑い出しました。そうしてまた慄ぞっとしたのです。私もＫの歩いた路みちを、Ｋと同じように辿たどっているのだという予覚よかくが、折々風のように私の胸を横過よこぎり始めたからです。,"At the same time, I repeatedly thought about the cause of death of K. For the time being, maybe because my head was dominated by just one letter of love, my observations were rather simple and straightforward. K was immediately determined to have died just because of a broken heart. However, when I turned to the same phenomenon with a feeling of calmness, it seemed that the solution could not be reached easily. The clash between reality and ideals-still not enough. In the end, I suspected that K might have suddenly made a decision as a result of being lonely and lonely like me. Then I was horrified again. I had the feeling that I was following the path that K walked in the same way as K, but I started to cross my chest like a wind from time to time.","All this time the cause of K’s death continued to obsess me. At the time it happened, the single thought of love had engrossed me, and no doubt this preoccupation influenced my simplistic understanding of the event. I had immediately concluded that K killed himself because of a broken heart. But once I could look back on it in a calmer frame of mind, it struck me that his motive was surely not so simple and straightforward. Had it resulted from a fatal collision between reality and ideals? Perhaps—but this was still not quite it. Eventually, I began to wonder whether it was not the same unbearable loneliness that I now felt that had brought K to his decision. I shuddered. Like a chill wind, the presentiment that I might be treading the same path as K had walked began from time to time to send shivers through me.","Time and again, I wondered what had caused K to commit suicide. At first, I was inclined to think that it was disappointment in love. I could think of nothing but love then, and quite naturally, I accepted without question the first simple and straightforward explanation that came to my mind. Later, however, when I could think more objectively, I began to wonder whether my explanation had not been too simple. I asked myself, “Was it perhaps because his ideals clashed with reality that he killed himself?” But I could not convince myself that K had chosen death for such a reason. Finally, I became aware of the possibility that K had experienced loneliness as terrible as mine, and wishing to escape quickly from it, had killed himself. Once more, fear gripped my heart. From then on, like a gust of winter wind, the premonition that I was treading the same path as K had done would rush at me from time to time, and chill me to the bone."

あなたは定さだめて変に思うでしょう。その私がそこのお嬢じょうさんをどうして好すく余裕をもっているか。そのお嬢さんの下手な活花いけばなを、どうして嬉うれしがって眺ながめる余裕があるか。同じく下手なその人の琴をどうして喜んで聞く余裕があるか。そう質問された時、私はただ両方とも事実であったのだから、事実としてあなたに教えて上げるというより外ほかに仕方がないのです。解釈は頭のあるあなたに任せるとして、私はただ一言いちごん付け足しておきましょう。私は金に対して人類を疑うたぐったけれども、愛に対しては、まだ人類を疑わなかったのです。だから他ひとから見ると変なものでも、また自分で考えてみて、矛盾したものでも、私の胸のなかでは平気で両立していたのです。,"You'll be confused and weird. Why can I afford to like the lady there? Why can't you afford to gladly look at the young lady's poor flower arrangement? Why can you afford to listen to that person's koto, which is also bad? When I was asked that, I was just a fact, so I had no choice but to tell you the facts. I'll just add a few words, leaving the interpretation to you, who is smart. I suspected mankind for money, but not yet for love. That's why, even if it's strange from the perspective of others, or if it's inconsistent when I think about it myself, it's calm and compatible in my heart.","was that I was stealing nothing, I thought in self-disgust. You must find all this most peculiar—how on earth did I have energy to spare to feel attracted to Ojōsan, to delight in gazing at her clumsy flower arrangements or listen with joy to her inept playing? I can only answer that these were the facts, and as such I must lay them before you. I will leave it up to your clever mind to analyze them, and simply add one thing. I distrusted the human race where money was concerned, but not yet in the realm of love. So despite the obvious contradiction, both states of mind happily coexisted inside me.","“I am behaving like a pickpocket who doesn’t steal,” I would tell myself disgustedly. You are probably asking yourself: “If he was indeed in such a state, how is it that he was able to feel affection for Ojosan? How could he have enjoyed her bad flower arrangement and her koto-playing?” I can only answer that I truly did experience these conflicting emotions at the time, and that I can do no more than describe them to you as faithfully as I can. I am sure that you are quite capable of finding a satisfactory explanation yourself. But let me say this: I had come to distrust people in money matters, but I had not yet learned to doubt love. And so, strange as it may seem to another person and inconsistent as it may seem even to me when I think about it, I was quite unaware of any conflict between the two states of mind."

妻はそれを今日こんにちに困らないから心に弛たるみが出るのだと観察していたようでした。妻の家にも親子二人ぐらいは坐すわっていてどうかこうか暮して行ける財産がある上に、私も職業を求めないで差支さしつかえのない境遇にいたのですから、そう思われるのももっともです。私も幾分かスポイルされた気味がありましょう。しかし私の動かなくなった原因の主なものは、全くそこにはなかったのです。叔父おじに欺あざむかれた当時の私は、他ひとの頼みにならない事をつくづくと感じたには相違ありませんが、他ひとを悪く取るだけあって、自分はまだ確かな気がしていました。世間はどうあろうともこの己おれは立派な人間だという信念がどこかにあったのです。それがＫのために美事みごとに破壊されてしまって、自分もあの叔父と同じ人間だと意識した時、私は急にふらふらしました。他ひとに愛想あいそを尽かした私は、自分にも愛想を尽かして動けなくなったのです。,"My wife seemed to observe it as a slack in her heart because she wasn't in trouble today. At my wife's house, about two parents and children are sitting and have the property to live, and I was in a situation where I couldn't ask for a job, so it's reasonable to think so. .. I'll be a little spoiled too. But the main reason why I got stuck wasn't there at all. At the time when my uncle deceived me, I must have felt that I would do something that others couldn't rely on, but I still felt certain because I was taking bad things about others. .. No matter what the world, there was a belief that I was a good person. When it was brilliantly destroyed by K and I realized that I was the same person as my uncle, I suddenly shook. I was so sympathetic to others that I couldn't move because I was sympathetic to myself.","My wife apparently interpreted my state of mind as a kind of ennui, a slackness of spirit that came from not having to worry about day-to-day survival. This was understandable. Her mother had enough money to allow them both to make do, and my own financial situation meant I had no need to work. I had always taken money for granted, I admit. But the main reason for my immobility lay quite elsewhere. True enough, my uncle’s betrayal had made me fiercely determined never to be beholden to anyone again—but back then my distrust of others had only reinforced my sense of self. The world might be rotten, I felt, but I at least am a man of integrity. But this faith in myself had been shattered on account of K. I suddenly understood that I was no different from my uncle, and the knowledge made me reel. What could I do? Others were already repulsive to me, and now I was repulsive even to myself.","It would seem that my wife attributed my ennui to the fact that I had no material worries. This was understandable, since not only did my mother-in-law have enough money to support herself and her daughter, but there was enough on my side to enable me to live without working. Besides, there is no doubt that I had learned to take my easy circumstances for granted. But material comfort was by no means responsible for my inaction. When I was cheated by my uncle, I felt very strongly the unreliableness of men. I learned to judge others harshly, but not myself. I thought that in the midst of a corrupt world, I had managed to remain virtuous. Because of K, however, my self-confidence was shattered. With a shock, I realized that I was no better than my uncle. I became as disgusted with myself as I had been with the rest of the world."

父は時々眼を開けて、誰だれはどうしたなどと突然聞いた。その誰はつい先刻さっきまでそこに坐すわっていた人の名に限られていた。父の意識には暗い所と明るい所とできて、その明るい所だけが、闇やみを縫う白い糸のように、ある距離を置いて連続するようにみえた。母が昏睡こんすい状態を普通の眠りと取り違えたのも無理はなかった。,"My dad opened his eyes from time to time and suddenly asked who was what. Who was limited to the name of the person who was sitting there just before. In my father's consciousness, there were dark and bright places, and only those bright places seemed to be continuous at a certain distance, like the white thread that sews the darkness. It was no wonder that my mother mistaken her coma for normal sleep.","Occasionally my father would suddenly open his eyes and ask after one or another of us, always someone who had only just left his bedside. He seemed to have dark and light areas of consciousness, and the light part wove its way through the darkness like a discontinuous white thread, now there, now gone again. It was natural enough that my mother should confuse his comatose state for sleep.","My father would open his eyes from time to time, and would suddenly ask what had happened to so-and-so, referring always to someone who had been by his bedside in his last lucid period. It seemed that my father’s understanding, like a white thread running through black material, was continuous though broken at intervals by patches of total darkness. It was not surprising that my mother should mistake his coma for natural sleep."

I’ve almost never seen you excited before.”","“You became a little excited, didn’t you, Sensei, when we were resting in the tree nursery?

中　両親と私,Middle parents and me,MY PARENTS AND I,2
私は暇乞いとまごいをする時先生夫婦に述べた通り、それから三日目の汽車で東京を立って国へ帰った。この冬以来父の病気について先生から色々の注意を受けた私は、一番心配しなければならない地位にありながら、どういうものか、それが大して苦にならなかった。私はむしろ父がいなくなったあとの母を想像して気の毒に思った。そのくらいだから私は心のどこかで、父はすでに亡くなるべきものと覚悟していたに違いなかった。九州にいる兄へやった手紙のなかにも、私は父の到底とても故もとのような健康体になる見込みのない事を述べた。一度などは職務の都合もあろうが、できるなら繰り合せてこの夏ぐらい一度顔だけでも見に帰ったらどうだとまで書いた。その上年寄が二人ぎりで田舎にいるのは定さだめて心細いだろう、我々も子として遺憾いかんの至いたりであるというような感傷的な文句さえ使った。私は実際心に浮ぶままを書いた。けれども書いたあとの気分は書いた時とは違っていた。,"As I told my teacher and his wife when I was begging for free time, I left Tokyo by train on the third day and returned to the country. Having received a lot of attention from my teacher about my father's illness since this winter, I was in the position I had to worry about most, but it didn't bother me much. I was rather sorry to imagine my mother after my father was gone. That's why I must have been prepared somewhere in my heart that my father should have already died. In a letter I sent to my brother in Kyushu, I mentioned that my father was unlikely to be as healthy as he was. It may be due to my job, but I even wrote that if possible, I would like to go back to see my face once this summer. Moreover, it would be regrettable that the elderly were alone in the countryside, and we even used sentimental complaints that we were regrettable as children. I actually wrote what came to my mind. However, the mood after writing was different from when I wrote it.","Three days later I set off on the train for home, as I had told Sensei and his wife I would on the night when I said my farewells. Sensei had been warning me about my father’s illness since winter, and I had every reason to be concerned about it, but for some reason the question did not much bother me. I was more disturbed by the problem of how my poor mother would fare after his death. Clearly, something in me had already accepted the fact that he must die. In a letter to my elder brother in Kyushu I had admitted as much, writing that our father could not possibly recover his health. Although no doubt he was tied up with work, I added, perhaps my brother should try to get back and see him over the summer. I rounded it off with an emotional plea that our two aged parents living together alone in the country must surely be lonely, which should lie heavily on the consciences of us children. I wrote those words simply as they occurred to me, but once they were out, I found myself feeling rather different.","I left Tokyo three days later, as had been my intention when I took leave of Sensei and his wife. I was not overly worried about my father, in spite of the warnings that Sensei had given me since winter concerning his illness. Rather, I felt sorry for my mother, whose life after my father’s death would, I knew, be very lonely. No doubt, I had come to regard it as inevitable that my father should die soon. In a letter to my elder brother in Kyushu, I had said that there was no hope of my father’s regaining his former health. In another letter, I had advised him to return home that summer if possible, to see my father before he died. I had even gone so far as to add, in a somewhat emotional strain, that we, their children, should feel pity for the old couple that led such lonely lives in the country. When writing such letters, I was quite sincere. But after writing them, my mood would change."
「お前の卒業祝いは已やめになって結構だ。おれの時には弱ったからね」と兄は私の記憶を突ッついた。私はアルコールに煽あおられたその時の乱雑な有様を想おもい出して苦笑した。飲むものや食うものを強しいて廻まわる父の態度も、にがにがしく私の眼に映った。,"""It's okay to stop celebrating your graduation, because I was weak at the time,"" my brother poked at my memory. I remembered the messy state of the time when I was agitated by alcohol and smiled bitterly. The attitude of my father, who was forced to drink and eat, was also reflected in my eyes.","“It’s a good thing your celebration party was canceled, you know,” my brother remarked to me. “Mine was dreadful, remember?” His words prodded my memory, and I smiled wryly, thinking of that event’s alcohol-inflamed disorder. I had painful memories of the way my father had gone around forcing food and drink on everyone.","“It’s just as well that the party was cancelled,” said my brother, reminding me of his own unfortunate experience. “You’re a very lucky fellow. As for me, I had a terrible time of it.” I smiled sourly to myself as I remembered how disorderly and drunken the evening had been. And I remembered, with bitterness, how my father had gone around forcing food and drink on his guests."
「じゃ奥さんは先生をどのくらい愛していらっしゃるんですか。これは先生に聞くよりむしろ奥さんに伺っていい質問ですから、あなたに伺います」,"""Then, how much do you love your wife? This is a question you can ask your wife rather than ask your teacher, so I'll ask you.""","“Well, then, how much do you love Sensei? This is something to ask you rather than him, surely.”","“Then let me ask you a question that you, rather than Sensei, will be in a position to answer. You are very fond of Sensei, aren’t you?” “Surely, there’s no need to ask a question like that."
二十三,twenty three,CHAPTER 23,"And when I tried to persuade him to lean on my shoulder, he laughed, and would not listen to me."
先生はようやく得心とくしんしたらしい様子であった。しかし私にはその意味がまるで解わからなかった。,The teacher seemed to be confident at last. But I didn't quite understand the meaning.,"There’d be no need to tell you anything.” He seemed finally satisfied, but I was puzzled by what he had said.","At last, he appeared satisfied. But I could not understand the reason for his remarks."
先生と話していた私は、ふと先生がわざわざ注意してくれた銀杏いちょうの大樹たいじゅを眼めの前に想おもい浮かべた。勘定してみると、先生が毎月例まいげつれいとして墓参に行く日が、それからちょうど三日目に当っていた。その三日目は私の課業が午ひるで終おえる楽な日であった。私は先生に向かってこういった。,"When I was talking to the teacher, I suddenly remembered the ginkgo ginkgo Taiki Taiju in front of me. When I counted it, the day when the teacher went to the grave every month as a mess was just the third day. The third day was an easy day when my work ended in the afternoon. I said this to my teacher.","As I was talking to Sensei, I was for some reason suddenly reminded of the great ginkgo tree that he had pointed out to me. A mental calculation told me that his next visit to the grave was three days away. My classes would finish at noon that day, so I would have the afternoon free. I turned to Sensei.","As I was talking to Sensei, I happened for some reason to think of the great gingko tree that he had pointed out to me. And I remembered that his monthly visit to the grave was only three days away. Thinking that it would fall on the day when my lectures ended at noon, and that I should be relatively free, I turned to Sensei and said:"
「今年の夏はお前も詰つまらなかろう。せっかく卒業したのに、お祝いもして上げる事ができず、お父さんの身体からだもあの通りだし。それに天子様のご病気で。――いっその事、帰るすぐにお客でも呼ぶ方が好かったんだよ」,"""You won't be boring this summer either. Even though I graduated, I couldn't celebrate, and my dad's body is the same. And because of Amako's illness. It was better for customers to call me as soon as I got home. ""","“You’re having a very boring summer, aren’t you?” my mother remarked. “We can’t celebrate this fine graduation of yours, and your father so unwell. And then there’s His Majesty’s illness—we really should have had that party as soon as you got home.”","“You can’t be enjoying yourself very much this summer,” my mother said. “We haven’t even celebrated your graduation. Your father hasn’t been well, and now, His Majesty . . . We should have had a dinner party immediately after your return.”"
「私は」と先生がいった。「私はあなたに話す事のできないある理由があって、他ひとといっしょにあすこへ墓参りには行きたくないのです。自分の妻さいさえまだ伴れて行った事がないのです」,"""I am,"" said the teacher. ""I don't want to go to the grave with others for some reason I can't talk to you. Even my wife hasn't been with me yet.""","“I have,” Sensei began. “I have a particular reason that I cannot explain to you for wanting to visit that grave alone. I never even take my wife.”","“I cannot tell you why,” Sensei said to me, “but for a very good reason I wish to go to that grave alone. Even my wife, you see, has never come with me.”"
「金に不自由のない私わたくしは、騒々そうぞうしい下宿を出て、新しく一戸を構えてみようかという気になったのです。しかしそれには世帯道具を買う面倒もありますし、世話をしてくれる婆ばあさんの必要も起りますし、その婆さんがまた正直でなければ困るし、宅うちを留守にしても大丈夫なものでなければ心配だし、といった訳で、ちょくらちょいと実行する事は覚束おぼつかなく見えたのです。ある日私はまあ宅うちだけでも探してみようかというそぞろ心ごころから、散歩がてらに本郷台ほんごうだいを西へ下りて小石川こいしかわの坂を真直まっすぐに伝通院でんずういんの方へ上がりました。電車の通路になってから、あそこいらの様子がまるで違ってしまいましたが、その頃ころは左手が砲兵工廠ほうへいこうしょうの土塀どべいで、右は原とも丘ともつかない空地くうちに草が一面に生えていたものです。私はその草の中に立って、何心なにごころなく向うの崖がけを眺ながめました。今でも悪い景色ではありませんが、その頃はまたずっとあの西側の趣おもむきが違っていました。見渡す限り緑が一面に深く茂っているだけでも、神経が休まります。私はふとここいらに適当な宅うちはないだろうかと思いました。それで直すぐ草原くさはらを横切って、細い通りを北の方へ進んで行きました。いまだに好いい町になり切れないで、がたぴししているあの辺へんの家並いえなみは、その時分の事ですからずいぶん汚ならしいものでした。私は露次ろじを抜けたり、横丁よこちょうを曲まがったり、ぐるぐる歩き廻まわりました。しまいに駄菓子屋だがしやの上かみさんに、ここいらに小ぢんまりした貸家かしやはないかと尋ねてみました。上さんは「そうですね」といって、少時しばらく首をかしげていましたが、「かし家やはちょいと……」と全く思い当らない風ふうでした。私は望のぞみのないものと諦あきらめて帰り掛けました。すると上さんがまた、「素人下宿しろうとげしゅくじゃいけませんか」と聞くのです。私はちょっと気が変りました。静かな素人屋しろうとやに一人で下宿しているのは、かえって家うちを持つ面倒がなくって結構だろうと考え出したのです。それからその駄菓子屋の店に腰を掛けて、上さんに詳しい事を教えてもらいました。,"""I have no financial inconvenience, and I was motivated to leave the noisy boarding house and set up a new house. However, it is troublesome to buy household equipment and take care of it. There will be a need for an old lady who will help me, and if she isn't honest again, I'm worried, and if it's not okay to be away from home, I'm worried. One day, I was wondering if I should look for it at home alone, so I went down the Hongodai Hongodai to the west for a walk and went straight to the Koishikawa Koishikawa slope. I went up to the Denzuin. After the train passage, the situation there was totally different, but at that time, my left hand was the earthen wall of the artillery arsenal. On the right is a vacant lot with no hills in the field. Grass was growing all over. I stood in the grass and gazed at the cliffs on the other side. It's not a bad view, but at that time, the taste of the west side was different. As far as the eye can see, the deep green all over the place makes me feel at ease. I wondered if that was the case. So I immediately crossed the grassland Kusahara and headed north on a narrow street. By the way, it seemed to be quite dirty at that time. I went through the roaring house, turned around the side streets, and walked around. I asked Kami-san if there was a small rental house here. Mr. Ue said, ""That's right,"" and he was angry for a while, but he said, ""Kashiya and a little ... It was a wind that I couldn't think of at all. I gave up and went home because I had no hope. Then, Mr. Ue asks, ""Isn't it an amateur boarding house?"" I changed my mind a little. I figured that it would be okay if I stayed alone in a quiet amateur shop without the hassle of having a house. Then I sat down at the candy store and asked Mr. Ue to tell me more about it.","With my new financial freedom, I began to play with the idea of quitting my noisy boardinghouse and finding myself a house to live in. I soon realized, however, that this would entail the bother of buying the necessary furniture, and employing a servant to run the household, one who was honest, so that I could leave the house unattended without worrying. One way or another, I could see that it would be no easy matter to achieve my plan. At any rate I should look around for a suitable house, I thought, and with this aim at the back of my mind one day I happened to go west down the slope of Hongō Hill, and climb Koishikawa toward Denzūin Temple.1 That area has changed completely since the streetcar line went in; back then the earthen wall of the Arsenal was on the left, and on the right was a large expanse of grassy vacant land, something between a hillside and an open field. I stood in the grass and gazed absentmindedly at the bluff before me. The scenery there is still quite good, but in those days that western side was far lovelier. Just to see the deep, rich green of all that foliage soothed the heart. It suddenly occurred to me to wonder if there might not be a suitable house somewhere nearby. I immediately crossed the grassy expanse and set off north along a narrow lane. Today it is not a particularly good area, and even back then the houses were fairly ramshackle and run-down. I wandered around, ducking down lanes and into side alleys. Finally I asked a cake-seller if she knew of any little house for rent in the area. “Hmm,” she said, and cocked her head for a moment or two. “I can’t think of anything offhand . . .” Seeing that she apparently had nothing to suggest, I gave up hope and was just turning for home when she asked, “Would you lodge with a family?” That set me thinking. Taking private lodgings in someone’s home would save me a lot of the trouble involved in owning my own house. I sat down at her stall and asked her to tell me the details.","As there was no more need for me to live as economically as I had done before, I began to toy with the idea of leaving the noisy boarding house and settling in a house of my own. I was, however, somewhat hesitant at first to put the idea into practice. I did not relish the thought of having to buy the necessary household goods, and of having to find an old housekeeper who was honest and whom I could depend upon to look after the house properly while I was away. At any rate, I decided one day to go for a walk and at the same time see if there were any vacant houses that I might find particularly attractive. I walked down the west side of Hongodai Hill and then up the slope of Koishikawa towards Denzuin Temple. The whole area has changed in appearance since the trams started going through there, but in those days, there was merely the mud wall of the Arsenal on the left as one walked up the slope, and on the right, there were only open fields. I stopped for a moment, and thinking of nothing in particular, looked towards the hill on the other side of the valley. The view is not bad even now, but it was much more pleasant then. All was green as far as I could see: it was a soothing sight. I then began to wonder whether a suitable house could not be found in the neighborhood. I walked across the fields until I came to a narrow lane, and then followed it northward. Even today, that neighborhood has a higgledy-piggledy look. You can imagine what it was like in those days. I walked around in circles through innumerable little alleys until I came upon a small confectioner’s. I went in and asked the woman who kept the shop whether she knew of a small but neat house that I could rent. “Well, let me see now . . .” she said, and for a while appeared to be in deep thought. She then said, “I am afraid I can’t think of one at the moment.” I decided there was no hope, and was about to leave the shop when she said: “Would you mind living with a family?” I became interested. After all, I thought to myself, living as the only paying guest in a quiet household would probably be more convenient than having a house of one’s own. I sat down, and the woman began to tell me about a family she knew of that might take me in."
私は挨拶あいさつをして格子こうしの外へ足を踏み出した。玄関と門の間にあるこんもりした木犀もくせいの一株ひとかぶが、私の行手ゆくてを塞ふさぐように、夜陰やいんのうちに枝を張っていた。私は二、三歩動き出しながら、黒ずんだ葉に被おおわれているその梢こずえを見て、来たるべき秋の花と香を想おもい浮べた。私は先生の宅うちとこの木犀とを、以前から心のうちで、離す事のできないもののように、いっしょに記憶していた。私が偶然その樹きの前に立って、再びこの宅の玄関を跨またぐべき次の秋に思いを馳はせた時、今まで格子の間から射さしていた玄関の電燈がふっと消えた。先生夫婦はそれぎり奥へはいったらしかった。私は一人暗い表へ出た。,"I greeted him and stepped out of the grid. A single turnip of sweet osmanthus, which is located between the entrance and the gate, had branches in the shade and in the shade so as to block my way. As I started to move a few steps, I saw the treetops covered with dark leaves and thought of the coming autumn flowers and incense. I remembered the teacher's house and this sweet osmanthus together, as if they were something that I couldn't separate from my heart. When I happened to stand in front of the tree and think about the next autumn when I should straddle the front door of this house again, the lamp on the front door that had been shining through the grid went out. The teacher and his wife seemed to go all the way to the back. I went out to the dark table alone.","I said my farewells and stepped out past the lattice gate. The bushy osmanthus between the entrance and the front gate spread its branches wide in the darkness as if to block my way. As I pushed the few steps past it, I imagined the scented flowers of the autumn to come, on those twigs where dark leaves now flourished. My mental image of Sensei’s house had always been inseparable from this osmanthus bush. As I paused there and turned back to look at the house, imagining the autumn day when I would cross that threshold again, the hall light that had been shining through the lattice front was suddenly extinguished. Sensei and his wife had evidently gone back inside. I made my way on alone through the darkness.","I said goodbye and stepped out of the house. Between the house and the outer gate, there was a bushy osmanthus tree. It spread its branches into the night, as if to block my way. I looked at the dark outline of the leaves, and thought of the fragrant flowers that would be out in the autumn. I said to myself, I have come to know this tree well, and it has become, in my mind, an inseparable part of Sensei’s house. As I stood in front of the tree, thinking of the coming autumn when I would be walking up the path once more, the porch light suddenly went out. Sensei and his wife had apparently gone into their bedroom. I stepped out alone into the dark street."
Ｋはやがて開けた襖をぴたりと立て切りました。私の室はすぐ元の暗闇くらやみに帰りました。私はその暗闇より静かな夢を見るべくまた眼を閉じました。私はそれぎり何も知りません。しかし翌朝よくあさになって、昨夕ゆうべの事を考えてみると、何だか不思議でした。私はことによると、すべてが夢ではないかと思いました。それで飯めしを食う時、Ｋに聞きました。Ｋはたしかに襖を開けて私の名を呼んだといいます。なぜそんな事をしたのかと尋ねると、別に判然はっきりした返事もしません。調子の抜けた頃になって、近頃は熟睡ができるのかとかえって向うから私に問うのです。私は何だか変に感じました。,"K cut off the fusuma that had opened before long. My room soon returned to the original darkness. I closed my eyes again to dream a quieter dream than the darkness. I don't know anything about it. However, when I often got up the next morning and thought about last night, it was strange. I thought maybe everything was a dream. So when I ate rice, I asked K. It is said that K surely opened the sliding door and called my name. When I ask why I did that, I don't get a clear answer. When I'm out of tune, I'm going to ask if I can sleep well these days. I felt something strange.","After a moment he slid the doors carefully closed. Darkness instantly returned to my room. I closed my eyes again, to shut out the blackness and dream in peace. I remember nothing more. But the next morning when I recalled the incident, it struck me as somehow strange. Had I perhaps dreamed it? I wondered. Over breakfast I asked him about it. Yes, he said, he had opened the doors and called my name. “Why did you do that?” I asked, but he gave only a vague reply. We lapsed into silence. Then he abruptly asked if I was sleeping well lately. The question struck me as rather odd.","K stepped back into his room and closed the door. The room became dark once more. I closed my eyes in the darkness, to return to my peaceful dreaming. I fell asleep immediately. The next morning, I thought about the incident, and began to wonder why K had behaved so strangely. I was half-inclined to believe that it was all a dream. At breakfast, I asked K if he had indeed opened the door in the middle of the night and called me. “Yes, I did,” he replied. “Why?” I asked. He would not answer my question. Then after a brief silence he asked unexpectedly: “Have you been sleeping well lately?” His question gave me an odd sensation."
私は食卓に着いた初めから、奥さんの顔付かおつきで、事の成行なりゆきをほぼ推察していました。しかしＫに説明を与えるために、私のいる前で、それを悉ことごとく話されては堪たまらないと考えました。奥さんはまたそのくらいの事を平気でする女なのですから、私はひやひやしたのです。幸いにＫはまた元の沈黙に帰りました。平生へいぜいより多少機嫌のよかった奥さんも、とうとう私の恐れを抱いだいている点までは話を進めずにしまいました。私はほっと一息ひといきして室へ帰りました。しかし私がこれから先Ｋに対して取るべき態度は、どうしたものだろうか、私はそれを考えずにはいられませんでした。私は色々の弁護を自分の胸で拵こしらえてみました。けれどもどの弁護もＫに対して面と向うには足りませんでした、卑怯ひきょうな私はついに自分で自分をＫに説明するのが厭いやになったのです。,"From the very beginning when I arrived at the table, I was almost guessing what was going on with my wife's face. However, in order to give an explanation to K, I thought it would be unbearable to talk about it in front of me. My wife is a woman who doesn't care about that much again, so I was sick. Fortunately, K has returned to his original silence. His wife, who was in a slightly better mood than Hirao, couldn't move on to the point where he was finally afraid of me. I took a rest and went back to my room. However, I couldn't help thinking about what kind of attitude I should take toward K in the future. I tried various defenses with my own chest. But none of the defenses were enough to face K, and the cowardly I was finally reluctant to explain myself to K.","As soon as I came to the table, I had been able to guess from Okusan’s face more or less what had transpired. But the thought of sitting there while everything was explained to K was intolerable. Okusan was the kind of person who could all too easily do this without a second thought, and I was cold with trepidation. Luckily, however, K sank back into silence, and Okusan, though more jovial than usual, did not after all move the conversation in the direction I dreaded. With a sigh of relief, I returned to my room. But I was haunted with worry over how to deal with K. I prepared an arsenal of justifications for my defense, but none would hold up when I was face-to-face with him. Coward that I was , I had no stomach for the explanation I would have to give.","I had guessed, immediately upon sitting down at the table, the reason for Okusan’s pleased look. The last thing I wanted her to do was explain the whole situation to K in my presence. The thought that Okusan was wont to show little reserve in such matters gave me acute discomfort. Fortunately, K became silent again. And Okusan, despite her unusually cheerful mood, did not reveal the secret after all. Sighing with relief, I returned to my room. But I could not help worrying about my future relations with K. “What am I going to say to him?” I asked myself. I thought of one excuse after another, but none satisfied me. Eventually, the mere thought of having to explain my conduct to K became distasteful to me. I was a cowardly soul."
兄は忙しい職にいた。妹は妊娠中であった。だから父の危険が眼の前に逼せまらないうちに呼び寄せる自由は利きかなかった。といって、折角都合して来たには来たが、間まに合わなかったといわれるのも辛つらかった。私は電報を掛ける時機について、人の知らない責任を感じた。,"My brother was in a busy job. My sister was pregnant. Therefore, I couldn't have the freedom to summon my father's danger before he could see it in front of me. That said, I came here for the sake of convenience, but it was hard to say that I couldn't make it in time. I felt an unknown responsibility about the time to send a telegram.","My brother was in a busy line of work. My sister was pregnant. Neither was in a position to be called until my father was in evident danger. On the other hand, it would be awful if they were asked to make the journey only to arrive too late. I felt a private weight of responsibility about exactly when the telegrams should be sent.","My brother was a busy man. My sister was with child. We could therefore not expect them to come home unless my father’s condition became really serious. On the other hand, we did not want them to go to all the trouble of coming to see him only to find that they were too late. No one knew how much I worried over the problem of when to send the telegrams."
先生の言葉はちょっとそこで途切とぎれたが、別に私の返事を期待する様子もなく、すぐその続きへ移って行った。,"The teacher's words were a little interrupted there, but I didn't seem to expect my reply, so I immediately moved on to the continuation.","He paused, and then seeming to expect no response from me, he went on.",He seemed not to expect a reply from me. He then continued:
その晩私はいつもより早く床とこへ入りました。私が食事の時気分が悪いといったのを気にして、奥さんは十時頃蕎麦湯そばゆを持って来てくれました。しかし私の室へやはもう真暗まっくらでした。奥さんはおやおやといって、仕切りの襖ふすまを細目に開けました。洋燈ランプの光がＫの机から斜ななめにぼんやりと私の室に差し込みました。Ｋはまだ起きていたものとみえます。奥さんは枕元まくらもとに坐って、大方おおかた風邪かぜを引いたのだろうから身体からだを暖あっためるがいいといって、湯呑ゆのみを顔の傍そばへ突き付けるのです。私はやむをえず、どろどろした蕎麦湯を奥さんの見ている前で飲みました。,"That night I went to the floor earlier than usual. My wife brought me soba soba noodles around 10 o'clock because I felt sick when I was eating. However, it was already dark in my room. His wife said, ""Oh my god,"" and opened the fusuma bran of the partition in detail. The light of the lump dimly inserted into my room from K's desk. It seems that K was still awake. His wife sat down at the bedside pillow and said that he should warm up his body because he probably had a cold, and he thrusts only Yunomi to the side of his face. I had no choice but to drink the muddy soba hot water in front of my wife's eyes.","That evening I went to bed earlier than usual. Concerned at my statement that I was feeling unwell, Okusan arrived around ten with some buckwheat soup. My room was already dark, however. She slid the door open a fraction and peered in, in consternation. As she did so, the lamplight from K’s desk cast a soft diagonal beam into my room. It seemed he was still up. Okusan came in and sat at my pillow, setting the bowl down beside me. “Do have this,” she said. “It will warm you up. You must have caught cold.” Grudgingly I drank the glutinous liquid, while she sat watching.","I went to bed earlier than usual that night. At about ten o’clock, Okusan, remembering that I had said I was not feeling well, kindly brought me some buckwheat gruel. She found my room in darkness when she opened the door. “Well!” she said, looking in. Through the other door, which was closed, a shaft of light from the lamp on K’s desk sneaked in. He was apparently still up. Okusan sat down by my bed, and holding out the cup of gruel, said: “Here, drink this. It will warm you up. You have probably caught a cold.” I dared not refuse, and drank the thick liquid while she watched."
「でも、あれでお父さんは自分でちゃんと覚悟だけはしているんですよ。今度私が卒業して帰ったのを大変喜んでいるのも、全くそのためなんです。生きてるうちに卒業はできまいと思ったのが、達者なうちに免状を持って来たから、それが嬉うれしいんだって、お父さんは自分でそういっていましたぜ」,"""But that's why my dad is just prepared for himself. That's why I'm so happy that I graduated and returned. I can't graduate while I'm alive. I thought, because I brought my diploma while I was a master, I was happy that it was, my dad said so by himself. ""","“But he’s thoroughly aware of the problem. That’s exactly why he was so overjoyed to see me after I graduated. He told me so. He said he’d thought before that he might not be alive, so he was happy he’d survived in good health till I could bring back the diploma for him to see.”","“But,” I said to her, “in spite of what he says, he is preparing to die, you know. That is why he was so glad when I came back with the diploma from the university. He himself was saying to me how fortunate he was that I should have graduated while he was still healthy, and not after his death as he had feared.” “What he says, and what he thinks are quite different things,” my mother said."
その後ご私はあなたに電報を打ちました。有体ありていにいえば、あの時私はちょっとあなたに会いたかったのです。それからあなたの希望通り私の過去をあなたのために物語りたかったのです。あなたは返電を掛かけて、今東京へは出られないと断って来ましたが、私は失望して永らくあの電報を眺ながめていました。あなたも電報だけでは気が済まなかったとみえて、また後から長い手紙を寄こしてくれたので、あなたの出京しゅっきょうできない事情がよく解わかりました。私はあなたを失礼な男だとも何とも思う訳がありません。あなたの大事なお父さんの病気をそっち退のけにして、何であなたが宅うちを空あけられるものですか。そのお父さんの生死しょうしを忘れているような私の態度こそ不都合です。――私は実際あの電報を打つ時に、あなたのお父さんの事を忘れていたのです。そのくせあなたが東京にいる頃ころには、難症なんしょうだからよく注意しなくってはいけないと、あれほど忠告したのは私ですのに。私はこういう矛盾な人間なのです。あるいは私の脳髄のうずいよりも、私の過去が私を圧迫する結果こんな矛盾な人間に私を変化させるのかも知れません。私はこの点においても充分私の我がを認めています。あなたに許してもらわなくてはなりません。,"Then I sent you a telegram. To be tangible, I just wanted to see you at that time. Then I wanted to tell my past for you as you wished. You called back and refused to go to Tokyo now, but I was disappointed and stared at the telegram for a long time. It seemed that you weren't satisfied with the telegram alone, and he sent me a long letter later, so I could understand the circumstances that you couldn't leave Tokyo. I can't think of you as a rude man. Why can you get rid of your precious dad's illness and leave your house open? My attitude of forgetting the life and death of the father is inconvenient. ――I actually forgot about your father when I sent that telegram. By the time you were in Tokyo, I was the one who advised you that you should be careful because you have an intractable disease. I am such a contradictory person. Or maybe my past squeezes me, rather than the tingling of my brain, transforming me into such a paradoxical person. I fully acknowledge my self in this regard as well. I have to ask you to forgive me.","Afterward I sent you a telegram. In truth I rather wanted to see you just then. I wanted to tell you the story of my past, as you had asked. When you replied that you could not come to Tokyo, I sat for a long time gazing at the telegram in disappointment. You must have felt that your brief response was not enough, for you then wrote me that long letter, from which I understood the circumstances that held you at home. I have no cause to consider you rude. How could you have left your dear sick father back at home and come? Indeed, it was wrong of me to have summoned you so high-handedly, ignoring the problem of your father’s health—I had forgotten about him when I sent that telegram, I must admit. This despite the fact that I was the one who so earnestly advised you to take good care of him and emphasized how dangerous his illness was. I am an inconsistent creature. Perhaps it is the pressure of my past, and not my own perverse mind, that has made me into this contradictory being. I am all too well aware of this fault in myself. You must forgive me.","Some time later, I sent you a telegram. To tell you the truth, I simply wanted to see you again. Also, I wanted to tell you the story of my past as you had once asked me to. When your telegram came, saying that you could not come to Tokyo, I was deeply disappointed. I remember I sat still for a while, staring at it. You too must have felt that a telegram was not enough, for you kindly wrote me a letter soon afterwards. The letter made it quite clear why you could not come to Tokyo. I had no reason to resent your not complying with my request. How could you have left home with your own father so ill? It was I who was at fault. I should have remembered your father’s condition. As a matter of fact, when I sent you that telegram, I had forgotten all about him. I, who had previously warned you of the seriousness of his illness, could not remember . . . You see, I am an inconsistent person. This inconsistency may not be so much a natural part of my character as the effect that the remembrance of my own past has had on me. At any rate, I am well aware of my failing. You must forgive me."
「私が夏休みを利用して始めて国へ帰った時、両親の死に断えた私の住居すまいには、新しい主人として、叔父夫婦が入れ代って住んでいました。これは私が東京へ出る前からの約束でした。たった一人取り残された私が家にいない以上、そうでもするより外ほかに仕方がなかったのです。,"""When I first returned to the country during the summer vacation, my uncle and his wife were replaced by my new husband in my house, where my parents had died. This is where I go to Tokyo. It was a promise from before. Since I was left alone at home, I had no choice but to do so.","The first time I returned from Tokyo for the summer holidays, my uncle and aunt had moved into the house where I had suffered through the death of my parents, and were now ensconced there. This had been decided on before I left for Tokyo. It was the only thing to be done, since I was the only remaining person in our family, and no longer living there myself.","When I went home the following summer, my uncle had already moved into our house with his family, and was now its new master. This had been arranged between us before I left for Tokyo. So long as I was not going to be in the house all the time, some such arrangement was necessary."
「そうでしょうか」,"""What so""",“You really think so?”,"“I wonder if you are right,” I said."
「奥さんはその間あいだ始終先生といっしょにいらしったんでしょう」,"""My wife would have been with the teacher all the time during that time.""",“And you were with him all the time it was happening?”,“And you were with him all the time that this change was taking place?”
「一人貰もらってやろうか」と先生がいった。,"""Let's get one,"" said the teacher.","“Shall I adopt one for you?” said Sensei. “Oh dear me, an adopted child . . .",“Would you like it if we adopted a child?”
「先生はなぜああやって、宅で考えたり勉強したりなさるだけで、世の中へ出て仕事をなさらないんでしょう」,"""Why does the teacher just think and study at home and not go out and work?""","“Why is it that Sensei always sits at home, studying and thinking, instead of finding a worthy position in the world?”","“Why does Sensei,” I asked, “not go out into the world and find himself some position that is worthy of his talents, instead of spending all his time studying and thinking at home?”"
私がのつそつし出すと前後して、父や母の眼にも今まで珍しかった私が段々陳腐ちんぷになって来た。これは夏休みなどに国へ帰る誰でもが一様に経験する心持だろうと思うが、当座の一週間ぐらいは下にも置かないように、ちやほや歓待もてなされるのに、その峠を定規通ていきどおり通り越すと、あとはそろそろ家族の熱が冷めて来て、しまいには有っても無くっても構わないもののように粗末に取り扱われがちになるものである。私も滞在中にその峠を通り越した。その上私は国へ帰るたびに、父にも母にも解わからない変なところを東京から持って帰った。昔でいうと、儒者じゅしゃの家へ切支丹キリシタンの臭においを持ち込むように、私の持って帰るものは父とも母とも調和しなかった。無論私はそれを隠していた。けれども元々身に着いているものだから、出すまいと思っても、いつかそれが父や母の眼に留とまった。私はつい面白くなくなった。早く東京へ帰りたくなった。,"Around the time when I started to rush, I gradually became obsolete, which was rare in my father's and mother's eyes. I think that everyone who returns to the country during the summer vacation will experience it uniformly, but even though they are treated with hospitality so that they will not be placed underneath for the next week or so, they will follow the ruler as they go through the pass. After passing by, the fever of the family is about to cool down, and in the end it tends to be treated poorly as if it were with or without it. I also passed the pass during my stay. Besides, every time I returned to the country, I brought back from Tokyo something strange that neither my father nor my mother could understand. In the olden days, what I brought back was not in harmony with my father or mother, just as I brought the smell of Kirishitan to the Confucian Jusha's house. Of course I was hiding it. However, since it was originally worn, it caught my father's and mother's eyes even if I thought I wouldn't put it out. I just became uninteresting. I wanted to go back to Tokyo early.","As tedium settled over me, my parents’ initial delight in me as some rare and precious creature was also fading, and they began to take my presence for granted. I suppose everyone experiences this shift when they return home for a vacation—for the first week or so you are fussed over and treated as honored guest, then the family’s enthusiasm wanes, and finally you are treated quite offhandedly, as if they don’t really care whether you are there or not. This second phase now inevitably set in. These days, furthermore, each time I came home from the city, I brought a new aspect of myself that was strange and incomprehensible to my parents. It was an element that was fundamentally out of harmony with both of them—rather as if, to make a historical analogy, I had introduced into a traditional Confucian household the disturbing aura of forbidden Christianity. Of course I did my best to hide it. But it was part of me, and try as I might to keep it to myself, they sooner or later noticed. Thus I grew bored and disillusioned with home life, and longed to go back to Tokyo as soon as possible.","At about the time that I began to feel restless at home, my father and mother also began to tire of me. The novelty of having me was wearing off. This kind of situation is probably experienced by most people who return home after a long absence. For the first week or so, there is a great deal of fuss, but when the initial excitement is over, one begins to lose one’s popularity. My stay at home had passed the initial stage. Moreover, each time I returned, I brought back with me a little more of Tokyo. This, my father and mother neither liked nor understood. As someone in days gone by might have put it, it was like introducing the smell of a Christian into the home of a Confucianist. I tried, of course, to hide whatever changes Tokyo might have wrought in me. But Tokyo had become a part of me, and my parents could not but notice that I had changed. I ceased to enjoy being at home. I wanted to hurry back to Tokyo."
私は顫ふるえる手で、手紙を巻き収めて、再び封の中へ入れました。私はわざとそれを皆みんなの眼に着くように、元の通り机の上に置きました。そうして振り返って、襖ふすまに迸ほとばしっている血潮を始めて見たのです。,"With my shaking hands, I rolled up the letter and put it back in the seal. I deliberately put it back on my desk so that everyone could see it. Then, looking back, I saw for the first time the blood that was spilling over the fusuma bran.",I folded the letter with trembling hands and slid it back into its envelope. I replaced it carefully on the desk so that it would be clearly visible to the others. Then I turned and at last I saw the blood that had spurted over the sliding doors.,"With trembling hands I folded up the letter, and returned it to the envelope. I deliberately put it back on the desk, where everybody could see it. Then I looked around, and for the first time, I saw the blood on the wall."
「こんど東京へ行くときには椎茸しいたけでも持って行ってお上げ」,"""When I go to Tokyo this time, I'll bring some shiitake mushrooms with me.""",“Why not take some of our dried mushrooms to him when you go back?” my mother suggested. “Fine.,"“When you go back to Tokyo, why don’t you take him some dried mushrooms?” “Thank you."
奥さんの様子は満足とも不満足とも極きめようがなかった。私はそれほど近く奥さんに接触する機会がなかったから。それから奥さんは私に会うたびに尋常であったから。最後に先生のいる席でなければ私と奥さんとは滅多めったに顔を合せなかったから。,His wife's appearance was neither satisfied nor unsatisfied. I didn't have a chance to contact my wife so close. Then my wife was normal every time I met me. I rarely met my wife unless I had a teacher at the end.,"On the face of it, I could not tell whether she was content. I was not in close enough contact with her to judge. Besides, when we met, she always appeared perfectly normal, and I almost never saw her without Sensei.","But I could discern neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction in her manner. Of course, I was not close enough to her to know what her real feelings were. I rarely saw her away from Sensei: besides, in my presence, her behavior was always that of the conventional hostess."
奥さんはいい渋って膝ひざの上に置いた自分の手を眺めていた。,The wife was reluctantly looking at her hand on her lap.,"She hesitated, fixing her gaze on the hands in her lap.","She hesitated, and gazed at her hands which lay folded on her lap."
年の若い私わたくしはややともすると一図いちずになりやすかった。少なくとも先生の眼にはそう映っていたらしい。私には学校の講義よりも先生の談話の方が有益なのであった。教授の意見よりも先生の思想の方が有難いのであった。とどの詰まりをいえば、教壇に立って私を指導してくれる偉い人々よりもただ独ひとりを守って多くを語らない先生の方が偉く見えたのであった。,"As a young man, I was a little apt to lose sight of myself. At least it seems to have been reflected in the teacher's eyes. The teacher's discourse was more useful to me than the school lecture. The professor's thoughts were more thankful than the professor's opinions. In other words, the teacher who just protected himself and didn't speak much seemed to be greater than the great people who stood on the podium and guided me.","Being young, I was prone to blind enthusiasms—or so Sensei apparently saw me. But conversing with him seemed to me more beneficial than attending classes. His ideas inspired me more than the opinions of my professors. All in all Sensei, who spoke little and kept to himself, seemed a greater man than those great men who sought to guide me from behind the lectern.","Being young, I was rather inclined to become blindly devoted to a single cause. At least, so I must have appeared to Sensei. I considered conversation with Sensei more profitable than lectures at the university. I valued Sensei’s opinions more than I did those of my professors. Sensei, who went his solitary way without saying very much, seemed to me to be a greater man than those famous professors who lectured to me from their platforms."
三十五,Thirty-five,CHAPTER 35,"She deliberately looked at me, when she said this."
「先生雑司ヶ谷ぞうしがやの銀杏はもう散ってしまったでしょうか」,"""Is the ginkgo of the teacher Zoshigaya Zoshigaya already scattered?""",“I wonder if that ginkgo tree at Zōshigaya has lost its leaves by now.”,"“Sensei, I wonder if the gingko tree at Zoshigaya has lost all its leaves by now?”"
「じゃ先生がそう変って行かれる源因げんいんがちゃんと解わかるべきはずですがね」,"""Then you should understand the cause of the change in the sensei.""",“Then surely you must have a good idea of what brought about the change.”,"“Surely, then, you must know the cause of the change.”"
奥さんの語気には非常に同情があった。それでも口元だけには微笑が見えた。外側からいえば、私の方がむしろ真面目まじめだった。私はむずかしい顔をして黙っていた。すると奥さんが急に思い出したようにまた口を開いた。,"I was very sympathetic to his wife's words. Still, I could see a smile only in my mouth. From the outside, I was rather serious. I was silent with a difficult face. Then, as his wife suddenly remembered, she opened her mouth again.","As it is, all I can do is feel sorry for him.” Her tone was deeply sympathetic, yet a little smile played at the corners of her mouth. To an observer, I would have appeared to be more concerned than she. I sat silently, my face troubled. Then she spoke again, as if suddenly recalling something.","Her tone of voice held a great deal of sympathy. Her lips, however, were smiling slightly. As far as our outward manner was concerned, I must have seemed the more anxious of the two. I sat there, silent and serious. She looked up, as though she suddenly remembered something, and said:"
私わたくしの知る限り先生と奥さんとは、仲の好いい夫婦の一対いっついであった。家庭の一員として暮した事のない私のことだから、深い消息は無論解わからなかったけれども、座敷で私と対坐たいざしている時、先生は何かのついでに、下女げじょを呼ばないで、奥さんを呼ぶ事があった。（奥さんの名は静しずといった）。先生は「おい静」といつでも襖ふすまの方を振り向いた。その呼びかたが私には優やさしく聞こえた。返事をして出て来る奥さんの様子も甚はなはだ素直であった。ときたまご馳走ちそうになって、奥さんが席へ現われる場合などには、この関係が一層明らかに二人の間あいだに描えがき出されるようであった。,"As far as I know, the teacher and his wife were a pair of good couples. Of course I couldn't understand the deep news because I had never lived as a member of the family, but when I was trying to sit face to face with me in the tatami room, the teacher called my maiden Gejo in the meantime. I sometimes called my wife. (My wife's name is not quiet). The teacher always turned to the fusuma bran, saying ""Oi Shizuka"". That call sounded kind to me. The appearance of the wife who came out after replying was also very straightforward. Occasionally, when he was about to feast and his wife appeared in his seat, this relationship seemed to be more clearly depicted between the two.","Sensei and his wife had a good relationship, as far as I could tell. I was not really in a position to judge, of course, since I had never lived under the same roof with them. Still, if he happened to need something while we were in the living room together, it was often his wife rather than the maid whom he asked to fetch it. “ Hey, Shizu!” he would call, turning toward the door and calling her by name. The words had a gentle ring, I thought. And on those occasions when I stayed for a meal and she joined us, I gained a clearer picture of their relationship.","Sensei and his wife seemed to me to be a fond enough couple. Not being a member of the family, I could not of course know how they truly felt towards each other. But whenever I was with Sensei, and if he happened to want anything, instead of the maid, he would call his wife. (The lady’s name was Shizu.) “Shizu,” Sensei would call, turning towards the door. The tone of his voice, when he did so, always sounded gentle to me. And her manner, when she appeared, seemed always willing and obedient. And whenever they kindly invited me to dinner, and I had occasion to see them together at the table, my pleasant impression of their feelings towards each other would be confirmed."
私は父の病気について正月以後何にも知らなかった。月々国から送ってくれる為替かわせと共に来る簡単な手紙は、例の通り父の手蹟しゅせきであったが、病気の訴えはそのうちにほとんど見当らなかった。その上書体も確かであった。この種の病人に見る顫ふるえが少しも筆の運はこびを乱していなかった。,"I knew nothing about my father's illness after the New Year. As usual, the simple letter that came with the exchange money sent from the country every month was my father's hand, but I could hardly find any complaints of illness. Besides, the typeface was also certain. The tremor seen in this kind of sick person did not disturb the luck of the brush at all.","I had heard nothing of my father’s illness since the New Year. The simple letter that arrived each month with my allowance was written in his hand as usual, but he made almost no mention of how he was feeling. His handwriting, moreover, was firm; the brushstrokes gave no hint of the tremors that affect those with his disease.","I had received no news of my father’s illness since January. My father had continued to write me a short letter every month when he sent me my money order, but he had said very little about his illness. Also, his handwriting had remained firm, and showed none of the hesitancy which one might have expected. “He never tells me how he is."
その中に動かずにいる父の病気は、ただ面白くない方へ移って行くばかりであった。私は母や伯父おじと相談して、とうとう兄と妹いもとに電報を打った。兄からはすぐ行くという返事が来た。妹の夫からも立つという報知しらせがあった。妹はこの前懐妊かいにんした時に流産したので、今度こそは癖にならないように大事を取らせるつもりだと、かねていい越したその夫は、妹の代りに自分で出て来るかも知れなかった。,"My father's illness, which was stuck in it, just moved to the uninteresting one. I consulted with my mother and uncle and finally sent a telegram to my brother and sister. I got a reply from my brother saying that he would go soon. There was a notice from my sister's husband that she would stand. My sister had a miscarriage when she was pregnant the other day, so this time she said she was going to take care of her so that she wouldn't become a habit. rice field.","My father’s illness was the one thing that stood still in the midst of all this coming and going, and it was slowly growing worse. After consulting with my mother and uncle, I finally sent off the telegrams I had prepared. My brother replied that he would soon be there, and my sister’s husband replied similarly—her previous pregnancy had ended in a miscarriage, and her husband had already intimated that they were taking particular care that it wouldn’t become the pattern, so he would probably come in her place. CHAPTER 47","And my father, the only immobile figure in the growing commotion, became steadily worse. After consulting my mother and my uncle, I decided to send the telegrams. A reply came from my brother, saying that he would leave for home at once. There was a telegram from my brother-in-law, saying that he would be coming. My sister had had a miscarriage in her previous pregnancy, and he had sworn that the next time, he would do everything possible to help prevent another such occurrence. We had thought it probable, therefore, that he would come alone."
「とにかく私の手紙はまだ向うへ着いていないはずだから、この電報はその前に出したものに違いないですね」,"""Anyway, my letter shouldn't have arrived yet, so this telegram must have been issued before that.""","“That’s true,” said my mother solemnly, appearing to ponder the matter, although the mere fact that he had sent the telegram before he read the letter could have given her no fresh information.",So he sent this without having read the letter.”
訐くという言葉が、突然恐ろしい響ひびきをもって、私の耳を打った。私は今私の前に坐すわっているのが、一人の罪人ざいにんであって、不断から尊敬している先生でないような気がした。先生の顔は蒼あおかった。,"The word humor suddenly hit my ears with a terrifying sound. I felt that the one sitting in front of me was a sinner, not a teacher I always respected. The teacher's face was blue.",The word disclose had a frightening ring. Suddenly the man seated before me was not the Sensei I loved and respected but a criminal. His face was pale.,"Suddenly, I was afraid. I felt as though the man sitting opposite me were some kind of criminal, instead of the Sensei that I had come to respect. Sensei’s face was pale."
私が疲れて宅うちへ帰った時、彼の室は依然として人気ひとけのないように静かでした。,"When I got tired and went home, his room was still quiet and unpopular.","When at length I came home, exhausted, there was still no sound of life from K’s room.","When I reached home, exhausted, I noticed that his room was as quiet as ever."

要するに私は正直な路みちを歩くつもりで、つい足を滑らした馬鹿ものでした。もしくは狡猾こうかつな男でした。そうしてそこに気のついているものは、今のところただ天と私の心だけだったのです。しかし立ち直って、もう一歩前へ踏み出そうとするには、今滑った事をぜひとも周囲の人に知られなければならない窮境きゅうきょうに陥おちいったのです。私はあくまで滑った事を隠したがりました。同時に、どうしても前へ出ずにはいられなかったのです。私はこの間に挟はさまってまた立たち竦すくみました。,"In short, I was an idiot who slipped on the road with the intention of walking honestly. Or he was a cunning man. So far, the only things I have noticed there are heaven and my heart. However, in order to recover and take a step forward, I fell into a predicament where people around me had to know what I had just slipped. I just wanted to hide the fact that I slipped.

Or perhaps I was really just cunning. For now, only heaven and my own heart understood the truth. But I was cornered; in the very act of regaining my integrity, I would have to reveal to those around me that I had lost it. I was desperate to cover my deceitfulness, yet it was imperative that I act. I was paralyzed, transfixed by my dilemma.","And so, despite my sincere desire to follow the path of honesty, I strayed away from it. I was a fool; or, if you like, a scheming rogue. Apart from myself, only heaven knew me for what I was. Having once done a dishonest thing, I found that I could not redeem myself without telling everyone of my dishonesty.

我々が首尾よく試験を済ましました時、二人とももう後あと一年だといって奥さんは喜んでくれました。そういう奥さんの唯一ゆいいつの誇ほこりとも見られるお嬢さんの卒業も、間もなく来る順になっていたのです。Ｋは私に向って、女というものは何にも知らないで学校を出るのだといいました。Ｋはお嬢さんが学問以外に稽古けいこしている縫針ぬいはりだの琴だの活花いけばなだのを、まるで眼中に置いていないようでした。私は彼の迂闊うかつを笑ってやりました。そうして女の価値はそんな所にあるものでないという昔の議論をまた彼の前で繰り返しました。彼は別段反駁はんばくもしませんでした。その代りなるほどという様子も見せませんでした。私にはそこが愉快でした。彼のふんといったような調子が、依然として女を軽蔑けいべつしているように見えたからです。女の代表者として私の知っているお嬢さんを、物の数かずとも思っていないらしかったからです。今から回顧すると、私のＫに対する嫉妬しっとは、その時にもう充分萌きざしていたのです。,"When we successfully completed the exam, the wife was pleased that they were both one year away. The graduation of the young lady, who can be seen as the only proud dust of such a wife, was coming soon. K told me that a woman would leave school without knowing anything. K didn't seem to have in his eyes the sewn needles, kins, kins, and ikebana ikebana that the young lady was practicing outside of academics. I laughed at his detour. Then I repeated the old argument in front of him that the value of a woman was not there. He didn't even refute. Instead, I didn't show any signs of it. That was fun for me. His poop-like tone still seemed to despise the woman. It seemed that I didn't think of the young lady I knew as a representative of a woman, even if there were only a few things. Looking back from now on, my jealousy for K was already full at that time.","We both passed our exams successfully, and Okusan congratulated us on entering our final year. Her own daughter, her sole pride and joy, was soon to graduate as well. K remarked to me that girls emerged from their schooling knowing nothing. Clearly he chose to completely overlook Ojōsan’s extracurricular study of sewing, koto playing, and flower arranging. Laughing, I countered with my old argument that a woman’s value did not lie in scholarly accomplishment. While he did not refute this statement outright, he did not seem willing to accept it either. That pleased me —I interpreted this casual dismissal of my ideas as an indication that his former scorn of women had not changed. Ojōsan, whom I thought the embodiment of womanly excellence, was evidently still beneath his notice. In retrospect, I see that my jealousy of K was already showing its horns.","When we had successfully completed our examinations, Okusan was very pleased for our sake, and said: “Well, you now have only one year to go.” Ojosan too, who was Okusan’s one real pride, was due to graduate soon. K remarked to me that women seemed to graduate without having learned a thing. He attached no importance whatsoever to those things which Ojosan was studying outside of school, such as the koto, flower arrangement, and sewing. I laughed at his stupidity. Once more, I told him that his was not the proper way to judge the worth of a woman. He did not argue with me. On the other hand, he did not appear to be convinced. This pleased me. His attitude, which seemed to suggest that the subject did not merit serious discussion, I took to be an indication of the contempt with which he still regarded women. I decided that Ojosan, whom I looked upon as the embodiment of womanly qualities, was of little significance to K. It is obvious to me now that I was already more than a little jealous of him."
十八,XVIII,CHAPTER 54,I was prepared to learn that the end had come for my father.
「君の気分だって、私の返事一つですぐ変るじゃないか」,"""Your mood will change immediately with just one reply from me.""","I turned and waited for him. “All I had to do was say what I just said, and your mood changed.”","“One simple remark, and your whole attitude towards me, you see, has changed.”"
私が進もうか止よそうかと考えて、ともかくも翌日あくるひまで待とうと決心したのは土曜の晩でした。ところがその晩に、Ｋは自殺して死んでしまったのです。私は今でもその光景を思い出すと慄然ぞっとします。いつも東枕ひがしまくらで寝る私が、その晩に限って、偶然西枕に床とこを敷いたのも、何かの因縁いんねんかも知れません。私は枕元から吹き込む寒い風でふと眼を覚ましたのです。見ると、いつも立て切ってあるＫと私の室へやとの仕切しきりの襖ふすまが、この間の晩と同じくらい開あいています。けれどもこの間のように、Ｋの黒い姿はそこには立っていません。私は暗示を受けた人のように、床の上に肱ひじを突いて起き上がりながら、屹きっとＫの室を覗のぞきました。洋燈ランプが暗く点ともっているのです。それで床も敷いてあるのです。しかし掛蒲団かけぶとんは跳返はねかえされたように裾すその方に重なり合っているのです。そうしてＫ自身は向うむきに突つッ伏ぷしているのです。,"It was Saturday night that I decided to wait until the next day, thinking whether I could move forward or not. However, that night, K committed suicide and died. I'm still horrified when I remember the scene. It may be because I, who always sleeps in the east pillow Higashimakura, accidentally laid the floor on the west pillow only that night. I suddenly woke up with the cold wind blowing from my bedside. When I look at it, the fusuma bran that is the partition between K and my room, which is always standing up, is as open as the night before. But like this time, K's black figure does not stand there. Like the person who received the suggestion, I poke my elbows on the floor and got up, and I'm sure I looked into K's room. The lump is a dark spot. That's why the floor is also laid. However, the Kakefuton Kakebuton overlaps with the hem as if it was bounced off. Then K himself is lying down on the other side.","Floundering in indecision, I finally put off the question of what to do until the next day. This was Saturday evening. That night, however, K killed himself. I still shudder at the memory of finding him there. I usually slept with my head facing east, but for some reason—fate, perhaps—that evening I had laid out my bedding to face the opposite direction.1 I was awakened in the night by a chill draft blowing in on my face. Opening my eyes, I saw that the sliding doors between our two rooms, which were normally closed, stood slightly ajar, just as they had when he appeared there some nights earlier. This time, however, K’s dark figure was not standing in the doorway. As if with a sudden presentiment, I propped myself on one elbow and peered tensely into his room. The lamp had burned low. The bedding was laid out. But the edge of the quilt was thrown back. And there was K, slumped forward with his back to me.","I finally tired of my own inability to decide whether I would speak to K or remain silent. It was, I remember, on a Saturday night that I told myself: “Tomorrow, I will make up my mind one way or the other.” But that night, K killed himself. Even now, I cannot recall the scene without horror. I do not know what strange forces were at work that night; for I, who had always slept with my feet pointing towards the west, decided that evening to arrange my bedding so that my feet would point towards the east.12 Some time in the night , I was awakened by a cold draught on my head. As I opened my eyes, I saw that the door between K’s room and mine was ajar. This time, however, I did not see K’s shadowy figure standing in the doorway. Like a man who has been suddenly warned of some approaching disaster, I sat up and peered into K’s room. In the dim lamplight, I could see his bed. The counterpane had been flung back. K sat with his back turned towards me. The upper part of his body was bent forward."
「私の父おやじもそんなになるでしょうか。ならんともいえないですね」,"""Will my dad be like that? I can't say that.""",“I wonder if that’s what will happen to my dad. There’s no saying it won’t.”,"“Do you think the same thing will happen to my father? One can’t say that it won’t happen, can one?”"
父はしばらくそれを眺ながめた後あと、起たって床とこの間の所へ行って、誰だれの目にもすぐはいるような正面へ証書を置いた。いつもの私ならすぐ何とかいうはずであったが、その時の私はまるで平生へいぜいと違っていた。父や母に対して少しも逆らう気が起らなかった。私はだまって父の為なすがままに任せておいた。一旦いったん癖のついた鳥とりの子紙こがみの証書は、なかなか父の自由にならなかった。適当な位置に置かれるや否いなや、すぐ己おのれに自然な勢いきおいを得て倒れようとした。,"After looking at it for a while, my dad got up and went to the floor and in between, and put the certificate in front of everyone's eyes. As usual, I should have managed to do something right away, but at that time I was totally different from normal life. I didn't feel like going against my father or mother at all. I fooled myself and left it to my father's will. Once I had a habit, the certificate of Totori no Kogami Kogami wasn't free for my father. As soon as I was placed in the right position, I immediately gained a natural force and tried to collapse.","After gazing at it for a while, my father rose to his feet and carried it over to the alcove, where he arranged it so that anyone who entered would immediately catch sight of it. Normally I would have made some remonstrance, but just now I was a very different person than usual. I felt not the slightest inclination to contradict my parents. I sat silently and let my father do as he would. The warp in the thick, elegant paper refused to respond to his attempts to straighten it. No sooner had he managed to smooth it flat and stand it where he wanted than it would spring back of its own accord and threaten to tip over.","My father looked at it for a while, then got up and went to the ornamental alcove of the room, and placed it where everyone could see it. Ordinarily, I would have said something, but at that moment, I was not my usual self. I had no desire to argue with my parents. I kept quiet and let my father do as he wished. The diploma was made of stiff paper, and having become misshapen in the packing, it refused to stay still, and collapsed each time my father tried to stand it up."
十四,fourteen,CHAPTER 14,But I never heard him mention the word “love” again.
奥さんのいうところを綜合そうごうして考えてみると、Ｋはこの最後の打撃を、最も落ち付いた驚きをもって迎えたらしいのです。Ｋはお嬢さんと私との間に結ばれた新しい関係について、最初はそうですかとただ一口ひとくちいっただけだったそうです。しかし奥さんが、「あなたも喜んで下さい」と述べた時、彼ははじめて奥さんの顔を見て微笑を洩もらしながら、「おめでとうございます」といったまま席を立ったそうです。そうして茶の間の障子しょうじを開ける前に、また奥さんを振り返って、「結婚はいつですか」と聞いたそうです。それから「何かお祝いを上げたいが、私は金がないから上げる事ができません」といったそうです。奥さんの前に坐すわっていた私は、その話を聞いて胸が塞ふさがるような苦しさを覚えました。,"Thinking about what his wife said, K seems to have received this last blow with the most calm surprise. At first, K said that he just took a sip about the new relationship between his daughter and me. However, when his wife said, ""Please please you too,"" he said, ""Congratulations,"" while he saw his face for the first time and smiled. Before opening the shoji screen in the living room, he looked back at his wife and asked, ""When will you get married?"" Then he said, ""I want to celebrate something, but I can't because I don't have the money."" I was sitting in front of my wife, and when I heard the story, I felt a pain in my chest.","All in all, I saw that K had taken this final blow extremely calmly. His first reaction to the news of my new relationship with Ojōsan had been simply to say “Is that so?” “I hope you’ll rejoice with us,” Okusan had said, and at this he looked her in the eye for the first time. “Congratulations,” he said with a little smile, and stood up. Before he opened the door to leave the sitting room, he turned to her again and asked when the wedding would be. “I wish I could give them a wedding gift,” he apparently said, “but I’m afraid I haven’t the money.” As I sat before her hearing these words, my heart clenched tight with pain.","It would seem that K received his final blow with great composure. He must have been surprised, of course. “Is that so?” he had said simply when told of the engagement of Ojosan and myself. Okusan had then said: “Do say that you are pleased.” This time, apparently, he had looked at her and smiled: “Congratulations.” Just as he was leaving the morning room he had turned around and said: “When is the wedding? I would like to give a present, but since I have no money, I am afraid I can’t.” As I sat before Okusan, listening to her words, I felt a stifling pain welling up in my heart."
先生はいくらともいわなかった。けれども先生の話は、容易に自分の死という遠い問題を離れなかった。そうしてその死は必ず奥さんの前に起るものと仮定されていた。奥さんも最初のうちは、わざとたわいのない受け答えをしているらしく見えた。それがいつの間にか、感傷的な女の心を重苦しくした。,"The teacher didn't say anything. But the teacher's story did not easily leave the distant problem of his own death. It was then assumed that the death would always occur before his wife. At first, his wife seemed to be deliberately giving an answer without any worries. Before I knew it, it made the sentimental woman's heart heavy.","Instead of replying, Sensei continued to talk hypothetically about his own death. He was firmly assuming he would die before his wife. Although she had initially treated the conversation lightly, it finally began to oppress her sensitive woman’s heart.","Sensei did not answer. He continued to talk, however, on the subject of his own death. And all the while, he seemed to have taken it for granted that he was going to die before his wife. At first, she seemed determined to treat the subject in a frivolous spirit. But eventually, the conversation began to oppress her sensitive woman’s heart."
「両方ともいわれる事はいわれますが、この場合は私の方が正しいのです」,"""It is said that both are said, but in this case I am right.""","“You could say both, true, but in this case I’m the one who’s right.”","But in this case, I am right.”"
先生のいう事は、ここで切れる様子もなかった。私はまたここで何かいおうとした。すると後うしろの方で犬が急に吠ほえ出した。先生も私も驚いて後ろを振り返った。,What the teacher said didn't seem to cut off here. I tried to do something here again. Then the dog suddenly barked behind me. Both the teacher and I were surprised and looked back.,Sensei was in full flow. I was about to interrupt him when a dog suddenly barked behind us. We both turned in surprise.,"Sensei looked as if he wanted to continue. And I wanted to say something at this point. But suddenly a dog began to bark behind us. Surprised, we turned around."
私は妻の望み通り二人連れ立って雑司ヶ谷ぞうしがやへ行きました。私は新しいＫの墓へ水をかけて洗ってやりました。妻はその前へ線香と花を立てました。二人は頭を下げて、合掌しました。妻は定めて私といっしょになった顚末てんまつを述べてＫに喜んでもらうつもりでしたろう。私は腹の中で、ただ自分が悪かったと繰り返すだけでした。,I went to Zoshigaya Zoshigaya with my wife as she wanted. I sprinkled water on the new K's grave and washed it. My wife put incense sticks and flowers in front of it. The two bowed their heads and joined hands. My wife would have decided to make K happy by stating the end of the story with me. I just repeated in my stomach that I was wrong.,"I agreed to her request, and together we went to Zōshigaya. I poured water over K’s fresh grave and washed it. My wife placed incense and flowers before it. We both bowed our heads and placed our hands together in prayer. No doubt she wished to receive K’s blessing from beyond the grave by conveying to him the news of our marriage. As for me, the words I was to blame, I was to blame were going around and around in my head.","I complied with my wife’s request, and we went to Zoshigaya. I washed the dust off the tombstone with water. My wife put some flowers and incense sticks before it. We then bowed our heads in silent prayer. My wife was probably telling K of her new happiness. All I could think of to say was: “I was wrong . . . I was wrong . . .”"
先生は何とも答えなかった。しばらくしてから、「私のは本当の墓参りだけなんだから」といって、どこまでも墓参ぼさんと散歩を切り離そうとする風ふうに見えた。私と行きたくない口実だか何だか、私にはその時の先生が、いかにも子供らしくて変に思われた。私はなおと先へ出る気になった。,"The teacher didn't answer at all. After a while, he said, ""I'm just a real visitor to the grave,"" and it seemed like I was trying to separate the walk from the grave visitor. For some reason I didn't want to go with me, the teacher at that time seemed strange to me as a child. I was still motivated to go ahead.","Sensei did not reply at first, then said finally, “My sole purpose in going is to visit the grave.” Clearly, he wanted to impress on me the distinction between a grave visit and a mere walk. It occurred to me that he might be making an excuse not to have me along. His tone seemed oddly petulant. I felt an urge to press my case.","Sensei was silent for a while, then said, “Believe me, visiting the grave is for me a truly serious matter.” He seemed quite determined to distinguish between his pilgrimage to the grave and an ordinary walk. I began to wonder whether he was making this excuse because he did not wish me to accompany him. I remember that I thought him oddly childish at the time. I became more forward."
「中に心しんでも入れると好よかったのに」と母も傍かたわらから注意した。,"""I wish I could put it in my heart,"" my mother warned from the side.","“You’d have done better to wrap it around something solid,” my mother chipped in from beside him.","“You should have protected it with something stiff,” added my mother from his side."
「そうかい、それじゃ早くお出し。そんな事は他ひとが気を付けないでも、自分で早くやるものだよ」,"""Well, then I'll put it out soon. I'll do it myself quickly, even if others don't care about it.""","“Have you? Well, then, be quick and send it off. You should have done this long ago, without having to be told.”","“Is that so?” she said. “In that case, you had better post it at once. You should have written it much sooner. One shouldn’t have to be prodded to do these things.”"
私の答えは誰に対しても同じでした。私はただ彼の私宛あてで書き残した手紙を繰り返すだけで、外ほかに一口ひとくちも附け加える事はしませんでした。葬式の帰りに同じ問いを掛けて、同じ答えを得たＫの友人は、懐ふところから一枚の新聞を出して私に見せました。私は歩きながらその友人によって指し示された箇所を読みました。それにはＫが父兄から勘当された結果厭世的えんせいてきな考えを起して自殺したと書いてあるのです。私は何にもいわずに、その新聞を畳たたんで友人の手に帰しました。友人はこの外ほかにもＫが気が狂って自殺したと書いた新聞があるといって教えてくれました。忙しいので、ほとんど新聞を読む暇がなかった私は、まるでそうした方面の知識を欠いていましたが、腹の中では始終気にかかっていたところでした。私は何よりも宅うちのものの迷惑になるような記事の出るのを恐れたのです。ことに名前だけにせよお嬢さんが引合いに出たら堪たまらないと思っていたのです。私はその友人に外ほかに何とか書いたのはないかと聞きました。友人は自分の眼に着いたのは、ただその二種ぎりだと答えました。,"My answer was the same for everyone. I just repeated the letter he left behind to me, and didn't add a bite to the outside. K's friend, who asked the same question on the way home from the funeral and got the same answer, took out a newspaper from his pocket and showed it to me. As I walked, I read the passage pointed to by the friend. It says that K committed suicide as a result of being disowned by his parents, causing a misanthropic and misanthropic idea. Without saying anything, I folded the newspaper and put it back in my friend's hands. A friend told me that there was another newspaper that wrote that K went crazy and committed suicide. I was so busy that I didn't have much time to read the newspaper, so I lacked the knowledge of that direction, but I was sick of it all the time. Above all, I was afraid of annoying articles at home. In particular, I thought it would be unbearable if the young lady was referred to, even if it was just her name. I asked the friend if he had written anything else. A friend replied that it was only those two species that caught his eye.","My answer to everyone was the same. I simply repeated the words of his final letter to me and made no further statement. The fellow who had asked me on our way back from the funeral, and received the same answer, now took from his pocket a newspaper cutting and handed it to me. I read the piece he indicated as we walked on. It said that K had killed himself from despair at being disinherited. I folded the page and returned it to him without comment. He told me that another paper had reported that K had gone mad and killed himself. I had been too preoccupied to look at newspapers and so was quite ignorant of all this, although I had all along been concerned about what they might write. Above all, I feared that something unpleasant or disturbing for Okusan and Ojōsan might appear there. It particularly tortured me to think that Ojōsan might be so much as mentioned in passing. I asked this friend if anything else had been written in the papers. These two references were all he had seen, he told me.","My answer was always the same. I merely repeated what K had said in his last letter to me. My friend, who had asked me the question after the funeral, produced a newspaper from his pocket when I had given him the usual answer. He pointed to the report of K’s death. It explained that he had been disowned by his family, and in a fit of depression had killed himself. I folded the paper and handed it back to my friend. He then told me that in another newspaper, K’s suicide had been attributed to insanity. All this I did not know , for I had been too busy to read the papers. I had nevertheless been wondering what they were saying about K’s death. I was afraid that they might say something that would embarrass the two ladies. The mere thought of Ojosan’s name being mentioned in connection with the affair upset me. “What else did you see in the papers?” I asked. “Oh, nothing else,” he answered."
こんな話をすると、自然その裏に若い女の影があなたの頭を掠かすめて通るでしょう。移った私にも、移らない初めからそういう好奇心がすでに動いていたのです。こうした邪気じゃきが予備的に私の自然を損なったためか、または私がまだ人慣ひとなれなかったためか、私は始めてそこのお嬢じょうさんに会った時、へどもどした挨拶あいさつをしました。その代りお嬢さんの方でも赤い顔をしました。,"When you talk about this, the shadow of a young woman will naturally grab your head behind it. Even for me who moved, that kind of curiosity was already moving from the beginning. Perhaps because these wickedness preliminarily damaged my nature, or because I wasn't accustomed to it yet, when I first met the lady there, I gave a screaming greeting. bottom. Instead, the young lady also had a red face.","From this description you will no doubt have sensed the presence of a young girl somewhere in the story. I must admit, I myself had been curious about the daughter ever since I first heard of her. Perhaps because these guilty thoughts had robbed me of a natural response, or perhaps because I was still awkward with people, when I first met her I managed only a flustered greeting. She, in turn, blushed.","I think it likely that the shadow of a young woman has already begun to pass before your mind’s eye. I must admit that I began to be curious about the young lady even before I moved in. Perhaps this vulgar curiosity on my part made me self-conscious, or perhaps I had not yet overcome my youthful shyness; but whatever the reason may have been, I behaved very awkwardly when I was introduced to Ojosan.3 She, on her part, blushed."
私は肝心かんじんの自分というものを問題の中から引き抜いてしまいました。そうしてお嬢さんの結婚について、奥さんの意中を探ったのです。奥さんは二、三そういう話のないでもないような事を、明らかに私に告げました。しかしまだ学校へ出ているくらいで年が若いから、こちらではさほど急がないのだと説明しました。奥さんは口へは出さないけれども、お嬢さんの容色に大分だいぶ重きを置いているらしく見えました。極きめようと思えばいつでも極められるんだからというような事さえ口外しました。それからお嬢さんより外ほかに子供がないのも、容易に手離したがらない源因げんいんになっていました。嫁にやるか、聟むこを取るか、それにさえ迷っているのではなかろうかと思われるところもありました。,"I have pulled myself out of the problem. Then I searched for my wife's intentions about her marriage. The wife clearly told me that it wasn't without a few stories. However, he explained that he was not in a hurry here because he was young enough to go to school. Although his wife didn't say anything about it, she seemed to put a lot of weight on her daughter's color. I even said that I could do it whenever I wanted to. Also, the fact that I had no other children than my daughter was a source of reason why I didn't want to let go. There was also a place where I was wondering whether to marry my wife, to get rid of my voice, or even that.","Carefully avoiding the crucial subject of my own feelings, I probed Okusan on her intentions for her daughter’s marriage. She told me frankly that there had already been two or three proposals, but as her daughter was still a young schoolgirl, there was no hurry. Though she did not say as much, she clearly set great store by her daughter’s good looks. She even remarked in passing that a suitable husband could be found anytime they wished. But as her daughter was an only child, she said, she was not inclined to send her off with just anyone. I got the impression that she was of two minds about whether to adopt a son-in-law as a member of their own household, or let her daughter marry out as a bride.1","I restrained my impulse to tell her the truth, and deliberately steered the conversation away from myself to the subject of Ojosan’s marriage. I tried to find out what Okusan’s plans were for her daughter. She clearly implied that Ojosan had already received some offers of marriage. She explained that since her daughter was still at school, she felt that there was no need to hurry. Though she did not say so outright, it was obvious that she set great store by her daughter’s good looks, and hinted that she could marry her off any time she wished. Ojosan was her only child, and of course she was reluctant to part from her. I suspected that she was in a quandary as to whether she ought to allow her daughter to marry into another family, or whether she should arrange to adopt a son-in-law who would become a member of her own household."
私には旨いものという父の言葉が滑稽こっけいにも悲酸ひさんにも聞こえた。父は旨いものを口に入れられる都には住んでいなかったのである。夜よに入いってかき餅もちなどを焼いてもらってぼりぼり嚙かんだ。,"I heard my father's words, humorous and humorous, as delicious. My father didn't live in a city where he could eat delicious food. I went in at night and had the rice cakes baked, and I squeezed them.","These words struck me as both comic and tragic. After all, he was not in the city, where really tasty food was actually to be had. In the evening he asked for strips of persimmon-flavored rice cake, which he munched on with relish.","My father’s idea of a “delicacy” struck me as being at once comic and pathetic. He was not a townsman, and so did not know what real delicacies were. Often, late at night, he would ask my mother for grilled rice cake, and eat it with gusto."
実際兄のいう通りに見えるところもないではなかった。近所のものが見舞にくると、父は必ず会うといって承知しなかった。会えばきっと、私の卒業祝いに呼ぶ事ができなかったのを残念がった。その代り自分の病気が治ったらというような事も時々付け加えた。,"In fact, it didn't look like my brother said. Whenever something in my neighborhood came to visit me, my dad didn't know he would meet. I'm afraid I couldn't call for my graduation celebration if I met. Instead, I sometimes added things like if my illness was cured.","my brother remarked. This idea was not entirely unjustified. When neighbors came to visit him, my father always insisted on seeing them. He would then proceed to apologize that he hadn’t been able to invite them to my graduation celebration, sometimes adding that he’d make amends once he was better.","My brother’s opinion was not entirely unfounded. Whenever a neighbor came to our house, my father would invariably insist on seeing him. And then he would be sure to express his regret to the visitor that he had been unable to hold the graduation party in my honor as planned. Sometimes, he would add that when he got better, the visitor would certainly receive another invitation from him."
私は今日こんにちに至るまですでに二、三度運命の導いて行く最も楽な方向へ進もうとした事があります。しかし私はいつでも妻に心を惹ひかされました。そうしてその妻をいっしょに連れて行く勇気は無論ないのです。妻にすべてを打ち明ける事のできないくらいな私ですから、自分の運命の犠牲ぎせいとして、妻の天寿てんじゅを奪うなどという手荒てあらな所作しょさは、考えてさえ恐ろしかったのです。私に私の宿命がある通り、妻には妻の廻まわり合せがあります、二人を一束ひとたばにして火に燻くべるのは、無理という点から見ても、痛ましい極端としか私には思えませんでした。,"I have already tried to go in the easiest direction to lead my destiny a couple of times to this day. But I was always fascinated by my wife. Of course, I have the courage to take the wife with me. I can't tell my wife everything, so I was scared even to think of the rough and rough behavior of robbing my wife Tenju Tenju as a sacrifice of my destiny. As I have my destiny, my wife has a wife's turn around, and it's only a painful extreme, even from the point of view that it's impossible to smoke them in a bundle. I didn't think.","Two or three times before now I have been poised to set off along the road to death that my destiny has laid before me so beguilingly. But each time my wife held my heart back. Needless to say, I have not had the courage to take her with me —I have been too cowardly even to confess my story to her, heaven knows, and the merest thought of inflicting double suicide on her and making her a cruel sacrifice to my own fate filled me with horror. My karma is my own, after all, and hers is hers. To cast our two lives into the flames together would not only be against nature, it would break the heart.","I tried two or three times to follow this only course which destiny had left open to me. But each time, I was restrained by my feelings for my wife. Needless to say, I lacked the courage to take her with me. As you know, I could not even bring myself to confess everything to her: how could I, then, rob her of her allotted life and force her to share my own destiny? The mere thought of doing such a cruel thing was terrible to me. Her fate had been pre-ordained no less than mine had been."
私わたくしは次の日も同じ時刻に浜へ行って先生の顔を見た。その次の日にもまた同じ事を繰り返した。けれども物をいい掛ける機会も、挨拶あいさつをする場合も、二人の間には起らなかった。その上先生の態度はむしろ非社交的であった。一定の時刻に超然として来て、また超然と帰って行った。周囲がいくら賑にぎやかでも、それにはほとんど注意を払う様子が見えなかった。最初いっしょに来た西洋人はその後ごまるで姿を見せなかった。先生はいつでも一人であった。,"I went to the beach at the same time the next day and saw the teacher's face. The same thing was repeated the next day. But neither the opportunity to hang out nor the greetings did not occur between the two. Moreover, the teacher's attitude was rather unsociable. I came abruptly at a certain time and went back abruptly again. No matter how busy the surroundings were, I could hardly see any attention to it. The Westerners who came with me first didn't show up after that. The teacher was always alone.","The next day I went to the beach at the same hour yet again, and again I saw Sensei there. I did the same the day after, but never found an opportunity to speak to him or even to greet him. Besides, Sensei’s demeanor was rather forbidding. He would arrive at the same time each day, with an unapproachable air, and depart just as punctually and aloofly. He seemed quite indifferent to the noisy throng that surrounded him. The Westerner who had been with him that first day never reappeared. Sensei was always alone.","I saw Sensei again the next day, when I went to the beach at the same hour; and again on the following day. But no opportunity arose for a conversation, or even a casual greeting, between us. His attitude, besides, seemed somewhat unsociable. He would arrive punctually at the usual hour, and depart as punctually after his swim. He was always aloof, and no matter how gay the crowd around him might be, he seemed totally indifferent to his surroundings. The Westerner, with whom he had first come, never showed himself again. Sensei was always alone."
「そうさね。私が代られれば代ってあげても好いいが。――嘔気はきけはあるんですか」,"""That's right. If I can be replaced, it's okay to replace it.-Is there any nausea?""",“Indeed not. I wish I could offer myself in his place. Does he feel any nausea?”,“I would take his place if I could. . . . Does he suffer from nausea?”
「お前は嫌きらいだからさ。しかし稀たまには飲むといいよ。好いい心持になるよ」,"""I don't like you, but you should drink it once in a while. It will give you a good feeling.""","“That’s because you don’t enjoy it. But it’s good to have the occasional drink, you know. It puts you in good spirits.”",“That’s because you don’t like saké. But it does you good to drink occasionally. This will cheer you up.”
私はまた警戒を加えました。けれども娘に対して前いったくらいの強い愛をもっている私が、その母に対していくら警戒を加えたって何になるでしょう。私は一人で自分を嘲笑ちょうしょうしました。馬鹿だなといって、自分を罵ののしった事もあります。しかしそれだけの矛盾ならいくら馬鹿でも私は大した苦痛も感ぜずに済んだのです。私の煩悶はんもんは、奥さんと同じようにお嬢さんも策略家ではなかろうかという疑問に会って始めて起るのです。二人が私の背後で打ち合せをした上、万事をやっているのだろうと思うと、私は急に苦しくって堪たまらなくなるのです。不愉快なのではありません。絶体絶命のような行き詰まった心持になるのです。それでいて私は、一方にお嬢さんを固く信じて疑わなかったのです。だから私は信念と迷いの途中に立って、少しも動く事ができなくなってしまいました。私にはどっちも想像であり、またどっちも真実であったのです。,"I also added vigilance. But what if I, who had the same strong love for my daughter as before, would be wary of her mother? I ridiculed myself by myself. I've even cursed myself for being stupid. But no matter how stupid it was, I didn't feel much pain. My anguish comes only when I meet the question of whether my daughter, like her wife, is a tactician. When I think that they are doing everything after having a meeting behind me, I suddenly feel painful and unbearable. It's not unpleasant. You will feel like a dead end. Yet, on the other hand, I firmly believed in the young lady and did not doubt it. So I stood in the middle of my beliefs and hesitations and couldn't move at all. Both were imaginations to me, and both were true.","And so I grew wary again. Still, at times I scoffed at my own foolishness. What use was all my caution about her mother, when I still loved Ojōsan as deeply as ever? But no matter how foolish I recognized myself to be, this contradiction was hardly a source of much pain. My real anguish began when it occurred to me that Ojōsan might be as devious as her mother. The instant it occurred to me that everything was a result of plotting behind my back, I was racked with agony. This was not mere unhappiness—I was in the grip of utter despair. And yet, at the same time I continued to have unwavering faith in Ojōsan. Thus I found myself paralyzed, suspended between conviction and doubt. Both seemed to me at once the product of my imagination and the truth.","Once more, I found myself on the defensive. Of course, I stood to gain nothing from such an attitude, since I remained very much in love with Ojosan. I laughed at myself in scorn. I told myself that I was an idiot. If my suspicions had gone no further, I should not have suffered very much, and I should simply have laughed at myself for being such an inconsistent fool. But I began to be really miserable when the thought occurred to me that perhaps Ojosan was no less of a schemer than her mother. It was unbearably painful to imagine the two of them plotting behind my back. I was not merely unhappy: I was desperate. But there was another part of me that trusted Ojosan absolutely. I stood still, unable to move away from the half-way point between conviction and doubt. To me, both seemed like figments of my imagination, and yet both seemed real."

It's really painful when you say so, but I can't think of it no matter what I think. I don't know if you asked me to see it. ""","“But that’s just the problem. It’s painful to hear you say this, because I’ve racked my brains, but I just don’t know. I don’t know how many times I’ve begged him to talk about it.”","“Unfortunately, no.

私わたくしは立て掛けた腰をまたおろして、話の区切りの付くまで二人の相手になっていた。,"I sat down again, and I was two people until the story was separated.","I had been about to leave, but once this conversation was under way, I settled back into my seat again. Sensei turned to me.","I had been on the point of leaving when the conversation started, but I decided to stay a little while longer and keep the two company."
「悪い事をした。私はあなたに真実まことを話している気でいた。ところが実際は、あなたを焦慮じらしていたのだ。私は悪い事をした」,"""I did something wrong. I felt like I was telling you the truth. But in reality, I was anxious about you. I did something wrong.""","“I apologize. I was trying to speak truthfully, but I’ve only succeeded in irritating you. It was wrong of me.”","“It was wrong of me.

I'm sure I'm excited when it comes to property. I don't know what you look like, but I'm a very obsessive man. I will never forget the humiliation and damage I received from you, even after 10 or 20 years. ""","“I don’t mind you seeing me in a bad light. I do get excited, it’s true. I get excited whenever I talk about the question of property. I don’t know how I seem to you, but let me tell you, I’m a most vindictive man. When someone insults or harms me, I’ll bear the grudge for ten years, twenty years.”","“Not very; perhaps a little . . .” “I don’t mind at all your saying that I was very excited. You see, I really do become excited when I start speaking of inheritances, and so on. It may not seem so to you, but I have a very vindictive nature. The indignities and injuries I suffered ten years ago—even twenty years ago—I have not yet forgotten.”"
「そりゃ先生もそう認めていられるんだから、大丈夫です。ご安心なさい、私が保証します」,"""That's okay because the teacher admits that. Rest assured, I guarantee.""",Sensei knows that. Believe me. I give you my word.”,"“I am sure that Sensei knows that,” I said. “Please don’t worry."
先生が先へ死ぬか、奥さんが早く亡くなるか、固もとより私に判断のつくべき問題ではなかった。私はただ笑っていた。,"Whether the teacher died first or the wife died early, it was not a matter for me to judge. I was just laughing.","I was in no position to judge whether Sensei or his wife would be first to die, so I simply smiled and remarked, “Who can foretell allotted life spans?”","Which of the two would die first was obviously not a question that I could answer intelligently, so I smiled and said:"
私は時々妻に詫あやまりました。それは多く酒に酔って遅く帰った翌日あくるひの朝でした。妻は笑いました。あるいは黙っていました。たまにぽろぽろと涙を落す事もありました。私はどっちにしても自分が不愉快で堪たまらなかったのです。だから私の妻に詫まるのは、自分に詫まるのとつまり同じ事になるのです。私はしまいに酒を止やめました。妻の忠告で止めたというより、自分で厭いやになったから止めたといった方が適当でしょう。,"I sometimes apologized to my wife. It was the morning of the next day when I got drunk a lot and returned late. My wife laughed. Or I was silent. Occasionally I shed tears. Either way, I was uncomfortable and unbearable. So apologizing to my wife is the same as apologizing to myself. I finally stopped drinking. Rather than stopping with my wife's advice, it would be more appropriate to stop because I didn't like it myself.","Sometimes I apologized to her, the morning after I had come home late and drunk. She would laugh, or else fall silent, and occasionally she wept. Whatever her reaction, I hated myself. In apologizing to her, I was actually apologizing to myself. Finally I gave up drinking, less because of my wife’s admonishments than because of self-disgust.","Sometimes—usually the morning after I had come home late in a very drunken state—I would apologize to her. She would listen to my apology, and then laugh; or she would remain silent; or she would begin to cry. Whatever she did, I was invariably disgusted with myself at such times. I suppose that, in a sense, I was apologizing as much to myself as to her. Finally, I gave up drinking: one might say that it was self-disgust, rather than my wife’s reproaches, that made me stop. I did not touch saké any more, it is true, but I was at a loss as to what I should do instead."
「気の毒だが信用されないとおっしゃるんですか」,"""I'm sorry, but do you say you can't be trusted?""","“You can have sympathy for me but not trust, is that it?”","“I deserve your sympathy, but not your trust. Is that what you mean, Sensei?”"
私はとくの昔から先生の何もしていないという事を父にも母にも告げたつもりでいた。そうして父はたしかにそれを記憶しているはずであった。,I intended to tell my father and mother that I hadn't done anything for the teacher since long ago. Then my father must have remembered it.,I thought I had told them this long ago. Surely my father remembered.,"It was my impression that I had already told both my father and my mother that Sensei did nothing; and if I was not mistaken in thinking so, then my father should have remembered this."
私はその人から鄭寧ていねいに先生の出先を教えられた。先生は例月その日になると雑司ヶ谷ぞうしがやの墓地にある或ある仏へ花を手向たむけに行く習慣なのだそうである。「たった今出たばかりで、十分になるか、ならないかでございます」と奥さんは気の毒そうにいってくれた。私は会釈えしゃくして外へ出た。賑にぎやかな町の方へ一丁ちょうほど歩くと、私も散歩がてら雑司ヶ谷へ行ってみる気になった。先生に会えるか会えないかという好奇心も動いた。それですぐ踵きびすを回めぐらした。,"I was carefully taught by the person where the teacher was going. It seems that the teacher has a habit of going to a certain Buddha in the graveyard of Zoshigaya Zoshigaya every month on that day to look for flowers. ""It's just out, and it's going to be enough or not,"" said his wife, sorry. I went out with a bow. When I walked for a while toward the bustling town, I was motivated to go to Zoshigaya for a walk. The curiosity of seeing or not seeing the teacher also moved. So I immediately turned around my heels.","She courteously explained where Sensei had gone. On this day every month, she told me, his habit was to visit the cemetery at Zōshigaya and offer flowers at one of the graves. “He only went out a bare ten minutes or so ago,” she added sympathetically. I thanked her and left. I walked a hundred yards or so toward the bustling town, then felt a sudden urge to take a detour by way of Zōshigaya myself. I might even come across Sensei there, I thought. I swung around and set off.","Very courteously, she told me of Sensei’s whereabouts. I learned that every month, on the same day, it was Sensei’s custom to take flowers to a certain grave in the cemetery at Zoshigaya. “He left here,” said the lady regretfully, “hardly more than ten minutes ago.” I thanked her and left. Before I had gone very far towards the busier part of town, I decided that it would be a pleasant walk to Zoshigaya. Besides, I might meet Sensei, I thought. I turned around and started to walk in the direction of Zoshigaya."
それはある軍人の家族、というよりもむしろ遺族、の住んでいる家でした。主人は何でも日清にっしん戦争の時か何かに死んだのだと上さんがいいました。一年ばかり前までは、市ヶ谷いちがやの士官しかん学校の傍そばとかに住んでいたのだが、厩うまやなどがあって、邸やしきが広過ぎるので、そこを売り払って、ここへ引っ越して来たけれども、無人ぶにんで淋さむしくって困るから相当の人があったら世話をしてくれと頼まれていたのだそうです。私は上さんから、その家には未亡人びぼうじんと一人娘と下女げじょより外ほかにいないのだという事を確かめました。私は閑静で至極しごく好かろうと心の中うちに思いました。けれどもそんな家族のうちに、私のようなものが、突然行ったところで、素性すじょうの知れない書生さんという名称のもとに、すぐ拒絶されはしまいかという掛念けねんもありました。私は止よそうかとも考えました。しかし私は書生としてそんなに見苦しい服装なりはしていませんでした。それから大学の制帽を被かぶっていました。あなたは笑うでしょう、大学の制帽がどうしたんだといって。けれどもその頃の大学生は今と違って、大分だいぶ世間に信用のあったものです。私はその場合この四角な帽子に一種の自信を見出みいだしたくらいです。そうして駄菓子屋の上さんに教わった通り、紹介も何もなしにその軍人の遺族の家うちを訪ねました。,"It was the home of a military family, rather than a bereaved family. Mr. Ue said that his husband died at the time of the Nissin War or something. Until about a year ago, I lived near Ichigaya Ichigaya's officer school, but there are stables and the house is too large, so I sold it and moved here. He came, but he was asked to take care of him if there were a considerable number of people because he was unmanned and lonely. I confirmed from Mr. Ue that there was no other place in the house than the widow Bibojin, his only daughter, and his younger daughter Gejo. I thought in my heart that I would like it quietly and extremely. However, in such a family, when something like me suddenly went, I was wondering if it would be rejected immediately under the name of Shosei-san, whose identity is unknown. I also thought about stopping. However, as a shosei, I wasn't dressed so unsightly. Then I wore a college cap. You will laugh, saying what happened to the college cap. However, the university students at that time were different from what they are now, and they were quite credible to the world. In that case, I found a kind of self-confidence in this square hat. Then, as taught by the candy store's top, I visited the house of the soldier's bereaved family without any introduction.","It was the house of a military man, or rather of his surviving family. The cake-seller thought he had probably died in the Sino-Japanese War.2 Until about a year before, the family had been living near the Officers’ Academy in Ichigaya, but the place was too grand, with stables and outbuildings, and too big for the family, so they had sold it and moved to this area. Apparently, however, they felt lonely here, just the two of them, and had asked her if she knew of a suitable lodger. She told me the household consisted solely of the widow, her daughter, and a maid. It sounded perfect for me, being so quiet and secluded, but I feared that if I were to turn up suddenly and offer myself, an unknown student, the widow might turn me down. Perhaps I should give up the idea then and there, I thought. But I was dressed quite respectably for a student and besides, I was wearing my school cap. You will probably scoff at the idea that this was important. But in those days, unlike today, students had quite a good reputation, and my square cap invested me with a certain confidence. And so I followed the cake-seller’s directions and called in at the house unannounced.","It was an army family; or, to be more accurate, a family that had once been connected with the army. The head of it had been killed, the woman believed, in the Sino-Japanese War. The bereaved family had lived in their old house near the Officers’ School at Ichigaya until the previous year, but had found it too large—it was the sort of house with stables attached to it—and so had sold it and moved into a smaller one. There were only three people living in the house, the woman told me: the widow, her daughter, and one maid. The widow had apparently said to the woman that it was rather lonely in the new house, and that she would like a boarder, if someone suitable could be found. I thought that the house would be very quiet and that it would suit me very well. But I was afraid that such a family would not wish to take in a student about whom they knew nothing. I was tempted to give up the idea of going to the house. I reminded myself, however, that for a student I looked quite respectable. Besides, I was wearing my university cap. Of course, you will laugh, and say, “What is so impressive about a university cap?” But in those days, university students were regarded with more respect than they are now. My square cap, then, gave me the confidence I needed. Following the directions given me by the woman in the confectioner’s, and without proper introduction of any kind, I made my way to the house."
それで私はなるべく、自分が中心になって、女二人とＫとの連絡をはかるように力つとめました。Ｋと私が話している所へ家うちの人を呼ぶとか、または家の人と私が一つ室へやに落ち合った所へ、Ｋを引っ張り出すとか、どっちでもその場合に応じた方法をとって、彼らを接近させようとしたのです。もちろんＫはそれをあまり好みませんでした。ある時はふいと起たって室の外へ出ました。またある時はいくら呼んでもなかなか出て来ませんでした。Ｋはあんな無駄話むだばなしをしてどこが面白いというのです。私はただ笑っていました。しかし心の中うちでは、Ｋがそのために私を軽蔑けいべつしていることがよく解わかりました。,"So, as much as possible, I tried to take the lead and try to keep in touch with the two women and K. Call the housekeeper to the place where K and I are talking, or pull K out to the place where the housekeeper and I meet in one room, either way. , I tried to get them closer. Of course K didn't like it very much. At one point I suddenly got up and went out of the room. At one point, no matter how much I called, it didn't come out easily. What is interesting about K doing such a wasteful talk. I was just laughing. But in my heart, I knew well that K was despising me for that.","I then did my best to use myself as a catalyst to bring them together. At every opportunity I encouraged K to spend time in the company of all three of us. When I was talking with him, I would call them in, or when I met up with them in one of the rooms, I’d invite him to join us. Naturally, K did not much care for this. Sometimes he would abruptly rise to his feet and walk out. At other times he ignored my calls. “What’s the point of all that idle chatter?” he asked me. I just laughed, but I was well aware that he despised me for indulging in such frivolities.","I tried very hard, in the role of perpetual go-between, to establish a harmonious relationship between K and the two ladies. If I happened to be conversing with K, I would ask the ladies to join us. If I happened to be with the ladies, then I would try to get K to come out of his room and be with us. Suiting my tactics to the occasion, I did everything I could to bring them together. K did not like this, of course. Sometimes, he would suddenly get up and leave our company without a word. Sometimes, he would refuse to come out of his room when I called him. “Why is it,” he once asked me, “that you take so much pleasure in useless small talk?” I merely laughed—though I knew in my heart that I was being despised."
Ｋはぴたりとそこへ立ち留どまったまま動きません。彼は地面の上を見詰めています。私は思わずぎょっとしました。私にはＫがその刹那せつなに居直いなおり強盗のごとく感ぜられたのです。しかしそれにしては彼の声がいかにも力に乏しいという事に気が付きました。私は彼の眼遣めづかいを参考にしたかったのですが、彼は最後まで私の顔を見ないのです。そうして、徐々そろそろとまた歩き出しました。,"K stays there and does not move. He is staring at the ground. I was scared. To me, K felt like a robbery because he was in a hurry. However, I realized that his voice was very weak. I wanted to refer to his eyesight, but he didn't look at my face until the end. Then, gradually, I started walking again.","He came to an instantaneous halt and stood rooted to the spot, staring at the ground. This startled me. He seemed to me like a cornered thief who will suddenly turn threatening. Then I realized that he presented no danger; all the power had left his voice. I longed to read his eyes, but they remained averted. Then, slowly, he set off walking once more.","He stood still as he spoke, and stared at his feet. I was suddenly frightened that in desperation, K had decided to accept the fact that he was an idiot. I was as demoralized as a man who finds that his opponent, whom he has just knocked down, is about to spring up with a new weapon m his hand. A moment later, however, I realized that K had indeed spoken in a hopeless tone of voice. I wanted to see his eyes, but he would not look my way. Slowly, we began to walk again. I walked by K’s side, waiting for him to speak again."
その頃ころの新聞は実際田舎いなかものには日ごとに待ち受けられるような記事ばかりあった。私は父の枕元に坐って鄭寧ていねいにそれを読んだ。読む時間のない時は、そっと自分の室へやへ持って来て、残らず眼を通した。私の眼は長い間、軍服を着た乃木大将と、それから官女かんじょみたような服装なりをしたその夫人の姿を忘れる事ができなかった。,"Newspapers around that time were actually full of articles that could be awaited day by day in the countryside. I sat at my father's bedside and read it carefully. When I didn't have time to read, I gently brought it to my room and looked through it. For a long time, my eyes couldn't forget the appearance of General Nogi in military uniform and his wife, dressed like a lady-in-waiting.","Just then the paper was filled daily with news that made us country folk eager to read every issue. I would sit beside my father going carefully through its pages, and if I didn’t have enough time, I quietly carried it off to my room, where I read it cover to cover. The photograph of General Nogi in his military uniform, and his wife, who had died with him, dressed in what looked like the clothing of an imperial lady-in-waiting, stayed with me vividly for a long time.","About that time, the papers were so full of unusual news that we in the country waited impatiently for their arrival. I would read the news by my father’s bedside, taking care not to disturb him, or, if I could not do this, I would quietly retire into my own room, and there read the paper from beginning to end. For a long time, the image of General Nogi in his uniform, and that of his wife dressed like a court lady, stayed with me."
Ｋは自分の望むような口をほどなく探し出しました。しかし時間を惜おしむ彼にとって、この仕事がどのくらい辛つらかったかは想像するまでもない事です。彼は今まで通り勉強の手をちっとも緩ゆるめずに、新しい荷を背負しょって猛進したのです。私は彼の健康を気遣きづかいました。しかし剛気ごうきな彼は笑うだけで、少しも私の注意に取り合いませんでした。,"K soon found the mouth he wanted. But for him, who spares time, it's hard to imagine how hard this job was. He continued to carry a new load on his back without loosening his studies. I was concerned about his health. But he was stubborn and just laughed and didn't get my attention at all.","K soon found the kind of job he hoped for, but as you can well imagine for someone with his temperament, he chafed at the amount of precious time it consumed. Still, he pushed fiercely on with his studies, never slackening under the added burden. I worried about his health; iron-willed, he laughed me off and paid no heed to my warnings.","Shortly after, K found the kind of work he wanted. You can well imagine how painful it was for K, who valued his time so much, to have to do such work. And with this new burden on his shoulders, he drove himself harder than ever, so that he might study as he had done before. I began to worry about his health. But he was a stouthearted fellow, and took no notice of my anxious warnings."
尿毒症という言葉も意味も私には解わからなかった。この前の冬休みに国で医者と会見した時に、私はそんな術語をまるで聞かなかった。,"I didn't understand the word or meaning of uremia. When I met a doctor in the country last winter vacation, I didn't hear such a word at all.",I had never heard the term uremia and did not know what it meant. Such technical terms had not come up in my discussion with the local doctor back during the winter vacation.,"I had no idea what uraemia poisoning was. The doctor, whom I saw during the winter vacation, had certainly said nothing about it."
「つまり私のためなら、止よして下さいというだけなんです。陰で何かいわれるのが厭いやだからというご主意しゅいなら、そりゃまた別です。あなたがたに不利益な事を私が強いて主張したって仕方がありません」,"""In other words, if it's for me, I'm just telling you to stop. If you're willing to say something behind the scenes, that's another thing. I'm forcing you to do something disadvantageous. It can't be helped to insist. ""","“I was just asking you not to do it for my sake. If you feel there’d be unpleasant talk behind your back, that’s a different matter. There’s no point in insisting on having my way if it’s going to cause problems for you.”","“I was merely saying that you need not do it for my sake. But if you are afraid of gossip, then of course it’s a different matter. Who am I to insist on something that may do you harm?”"
そうこうしているうちに、私はまた奥さんと差し向いで話をしなければならない時機が来た。その頃ころは日の詰つまって行くせわしない秋に、誰も注意を惹ひかれる肌寒はださむの季節であった。先生の附近ふきんで盗難に罹かかったものが三、四日続いて出た。盗難はいずれも宵の口であった。大したものを持って行かれた家うちはほとんどなかったけれども、はいられた所では必ず何か取られた。奥さんは気味をわるくした。そこへ先生がある晩家を空あけなければならない事情ができてきた。先生と同郷の友人で地方の病院に奉職しているものが上京したため、先生は外ほかの二、三名と共に、ある所でその友人に飯めしを食わせなければならなくなった。先生は訳を話して、私に帰ってくる間までの留守番を頼んだ。私はすぐ引き受けた。,"Meanwhile, it was time for me to talk to my wife again. At that time, it was a busy autumn when the sun was crammed, and it was a season of chills that attracted everyone's attention. The ones that were stolen by the teacher's neighborhood came out for three or four days in a row. All the thefts were the mouth of the evening. Few homes were taken with big things, but something was always taken wherever they were. His wife was sick. There was a situation where the teacher had to open a house at night. A friend of the same town as the teacher who was working at a local hospital came to Tokyo, and the teacher had to feed the friend at a certain place with a few other people. The teacher spoke a translation and asked for an answering machine until he came back to me. I took over immediately.","My mind was mulling all this over when I found another chance to talk to Sensei’s wife. It was during that chilly time of autumn, when you are suddenly aware of everyone hurrying against the shortening days. In the past week there had been a series of burglaries in Sensei’s neighborhood, all in the early evening. Nothing really valuable had been stolen, but something had been taken from each house, and Sensei’s wife was uneasy. One day, she was facing an evening alone in the house. Sensei was obliged to go off to a restaurant with two or three others, to attend a dinner for a friend from his hometown who had a post in a provincial hospital and had come up to Tokyo. He explained the situation to me and asked me to stay in the house with his wife until he returned. I immediately agreed.","Meanwhile, it so happened that I had another occasion to have a conversation with Sensei’s wife. It was at the time of the year when the days grow shorter and there is everywhere a feeling of restless activity. There was already a chill in the air. During the previous week, there had been a series of burglaries in Sensei’s neighborhood. They had all taken place in the early hours of the evening. Nothing of great value had been stolen. The houses had been broken into nevertheless, and Sensei’s wife was uneasy. Unfortunately, Sensei was obliged to be away from the house one evening. A friend of his from the same part of the country as himself, and who was a doctor in some provincial hospital, had come up to Tokyo. Sensei and two or three others were taking him out to dinner that evening. Explaining the situation, Sensei asked me to stay with his wife until he returned. I agreed to do so willingly."
ある日私は神田かんだに用があって、帰りがいつもよりずっと後おくれました。私は急ぎ足に門前まで来て、格子こうしをがらりと開けました。それと同時に、私はお嬢さんの声を聞いたのです。声は慥たしかにＫの室へやから出たと思いました。玄関から真直まっすぐに行けば、茶の間、お嬢さんの部屋と二つ続いていて、それを左へ折れると、Ｋの室、私の室、という間取まどりなのですから、どこで誰の声がしたくらいは、久しく厄介やっかいになっている私にはよく分るのです。私はすぐ格子を締めました。するとお嬢さんの声もすぐ已やみました。私が靴を脱いでいるうち、――私はその時分からハイカラで手数てかずのかかる編上あみあげを穿はいていたのですが、――私がこごんでその靴紐くつひもを解いているうち、Ｋの部屋では誰の声もしませんでした。私は変に思いました。ことによると、私の疳違かんちがいかも知れないと考えたのです。しかし私がいつもの通りＫの室を抜けようとして、襖を開けると、そこに二人はちゃんと坐すわっていました。Ｋは例の通り今帰ったかといいました。お嬢さんも「お帰り」と坐ったままで挨拶しました。私には気のせいかその簡単な挨拶が少し硬かたいように聞こえました。どこかで自然を踏み外はずしているような調子として、私の鼓膜こまくに響いたのです。私はお嬢さんに、奥さんはと尋ねました。私の質問には何の意味もありませんでした。家のうちが平常より何だかひっそりしていたから聞いて見ただけの事です。,"One day I had something to do with Kanda Kanda, and my return was much later than usual. I hurriedly came to the front of the gate and opened the grid. At the same time, I heard the voice of the young lady. I thought that the voice certainly came out of K's room. If you go straight from the entrance, there are two rooms, a living room and a young lady's room, and if you turn left, you will see K's room and my room. I understand that it has been a nuisance for a long time. I immediately tightened the grid. Then the voice of the young lady stopped immediately. While I was taking off my shoes-I had been wearing a high-collar, labor-intensive knitting lace-up from that time on-I was messed up and untied the shoelaces. While I was there, I didn't hear anyone in K's room. I thought weird. Possibly, I thought it might be my mistake. However, as usual, when I tried to get out of K's room and opened the sliding doors, they were sitting properly there. As usual, K said he was back now. The young lady also greeted her while sitting, saying ""Welcome back."" Perhaps because of my mind, the simple greeting sounded a little stiff. It resonated with my eardrums as if I was out of nature somewhere. I asked my daughter, wife. My question didn't mean anything. I just heard it because the house was a little quieter than usual.","One day on my way home I had reason to stop in at Kanda, so I returned much later than usual. I hurried to the front gate and the lattice door clattered as I thrust it open. At that moment I heard Ojōsan’s voice. I was sure it came from K’s room. The sitting room and Ojōsan’s room lay straight ahead through the entrance hall, while our two rooms were off to the left, and by now I had become attuned to deciphering the location of voices. Just as I hastened to close the lattice door, her voice ceased. While I was removing my shoes—I now wore fashionable Western lace-ups—not a sound emerged from K’s room. This struck me as odd. Had I been mistaken? But when I opened the sliding doors as usual to pass through K’s room, I found the two of them sitting there. “Just back, are you?” said K, as always. “Welcome home,” Ojōsan said, remaining seated. For some reason, her straightforward greeting struck me as slightly stiff and formal. The tone had a somehow unnatural ring to my ears. “Where’s Okusan?” I asked her. The question had no real significance—it was just that the house seemed unusually hushed.","One day, it so happened that I had to go to Kanda on my way home, and I returned much later than usual. With hurried steps I walked up to the front door, and slid it open, not without some noise. Just as I did so, I heard Ojosan’s voice. I was certain that it came from K’s room. Facing the front hall was the morning room, and behind it, Ojosan’s room. To the left of the front hall was K’s room, and then mine. I had lived in the house too long not to be able to tell where the voice was coming from. Quickly, I closed the door behind me. Then Ojosan stopped talking. While I was taking off my boots—I had just begun wearing those cumbersome lace-up boots which were then fashionable—there was not a sound in K’s room. I thought this strange. I began to think that perhaps I had been mistaken. But when I opened the door to K’s room as usual, I found the two of them seated comfortably, facing each other. “Did you just get back?” said K. Ojosan remained seated, and said: “Welcome home.” It may have been my imagination, but I thought I detected a little stiffness in her simple greeting. Her tone struck me as being somehow unnatural. I said to Ojosan, “Where’s Okusan?” My question contained no subtle meaning. I asked it simply because the house seemed unusually quiet."
私が奥さんを疑うたぐり始めたのは、ごく些細ささいな事からでした。しかしその些細な事を重ねて行くうちに、疑惑は段々と根を張って来ます。私はどういう拍子かふと奥さんが、叔父おじと同じような意味で、お嬢さんを私に接近させようと力つとめるのではないかと考え出したのです。すると今まで親切に見えた人が、急に狡猾こうかつな策略家として私の眼に映じて来たのです。私は苦々にがにがしい唇を嚙かみました。,"It was a trivial matter that I started to doubt my wife. However, the suspicions gradually take root as the trivial matters are repeated. I figured out what kind of beat my wife might be trying to get her closer to me in the same sense as my uncle. Then, the person who looked kind until now suddenly appeared in my eyes as a cunning tactician. I bitterly bit my lips.","It was a tiny thing that sparked my suspicion, but as one insignificant incident was added to another, distrust gradually took root. I began to suspect that Okusan was trying to bring her daughter and me together from the same motives as my uncle. And with this thought what had appeared to be kindness suddenly seemed the actions of a cunning strategist. I brooded on this bitter conviction.","It was only something very petty that put me in a suspicious frame of mind. But this did not prevent me from becoming more and more suspicious as time went by. Some small incident —I forget what—put the idea into my head that Okusan was forcing her daughter onto me from the same motives as those which prompted my uncle when he wished me to marry his daughter. Okusan, whom I had taken for a kindly person, quickly became a cunning schemer in my eyes. I was filled with disgust."
この試みは次第に成功しました。初めのうち融合しにくいように見えたものが、段々一つに纏まとまって来出きだしました。彼は自分以外に世界のある事を少しずつ悟ってゆくようでした。彼はある日私に向って、女はそう軽蔑けいべつすべきものでないというような事をいいました。Ｋははじめ女からも、私同様の知識と学問を要求していたらしいのです。そうしてそれが見付からないと、すぐ軽蔑の念を生じたものと思われます。今までの彼は、性によって立場を変える事を知らずに、同じ視線ですべての男女なんにょを一様に観察していたのです。私は彼に、もし我ら二人だけが男同志で永久に話を交換しているならば、二人はただ直線的に先へ延びて行くに過ぎないだろうといいました。彼はもっともだと答えました。私はその時お嬢さんの事で、多少夢中になっている頃ころでしたから、自然そんな言葉も使うようになったのでしょう。しかし裏面の消息は彼には一口ひとくちも打ち明けませんでした。,"This attempt was gradually successful. Things that seemed difficult to fuse at the beginning began to come together in stages. He seemed to gradually realize that there was something else in the world besides himself. He told me one day that a woman shouldn't be so despised. It seems that K initially requested the same knowledge and scholarship from a woman as I did. If it wasn't found, it would soon have caused contempt. Until now, he had been observing all men and women uniformly with the same line of sight, without knowing that he would change his position depending on his gender. I told him that if only two of us were talking to each other forever, they would just go straight ahead. He replied that it was justified. At that time, I was a little crazy about the young lady, so I think I naturally started to use such words. However, the news on the back side could not be confessed to him.","This approach gradually succeeded. The two elements, which had seemed at first so unlikely to merge, slowly came together until they were one. K apparently grew to realize that there were others in the world besides himself. One day he remarked to me that women were not after all such despicable creatures. He had at first assumed, he told me, that women had the same level of knowledge and academic ability as I had, and when he discovered that they didn’t, he had been quick to despise them. He had always viewed men and women without any distinction, he said, without understanding that one could see the sexes differently. I pointed out that if we two men were to go on talking exclusively to each other forever, we would simply continue in the same straight line. Naturally, he replied. I spoke as I did because I was by then quite in love with Ojōsan. But I did not breathe a word to him of my inner state.","My experiment seemed gradually to succeed. What had at first seemed difficult of accomplishment became more and more easy. K, I thought, was learning to acknowledge the existence of a world other than his own. He said to me one day that women were, after all, not as contemptible as one might think. K had always expected the same kind of knowledge and education from women as he did from men. And in his disappointment, he had come to regard them with contempt. He had not known that there was a way to judge women and a way to judge men. “If you and I,” I said to him, “were to spend the rest of our lives as bachelors, forever talking to each other, we would advance merely in straight parallel lines.” “Of course,” he said. My mind was full of Ojosan at the time, and my opinions were naturally influenced by this fact. But I said not a word to K about the underlying cause of my remark."
十六,Sixteen,CHAPTER 52,"And so, while their father was still alive, the two brothers talked of what they would do after his death."
私は田舎いなかの客が嫌いだった。飲んだり食ったりするのを、最後の目的としてやって来る彼らは、何か事があれば好いいといった風ふうの人ばかり揃そろっていた。私は子供の時から彼らの席に侍じするのを心苦しく感じていた。まして自分のために彼らが来るとなると、私の苦痛はいっそう甚はなはだしいように想像された。しかし私は父や母の手前、あんな野鄙やひな人を集めて騒ぐのは止せともいいかねた。それで私はただあまり仰山だからとばかり主張した。,"I hated customers in the countryside. They came all the way to drink and eat as their final goal, and they all liked it if something happened. Since I was a kid, I felt uncomfortable with samurai in their seats. When it came to them, even more so, my pain was imagined to be even greater. However, I couldn't stop gathering such wild people and chicks in front of my father and mother. So I just insisted that it was too much.","I disliked the kind of guests you got in the provinces. They came over with the sole intention of eating and drinking, happy for any excuse to get together. Since childhood I had suffered at having to be present at the table with these people—I could well imagine how much more painful it would be if I was the cause of the gathering. But I couldn’t very well tell my parents not to invite such vulgar people over for a noisy get-together, so I contented myself with stressing that I didn’t want all this fuss about nothing.","I hated the kind of guests that came to a country dinner party. They came with one end in view, which was to eat and drink, and they were the sort of people that waited eagerly for any event which might provide a break in the monotony of their lives. Since childhood, I had hated to see them at our house and to have to behave respectfully towards them. That they were now to be invited to dinner for my sake made me feel even less friendly towards them. But I could hardly say to my parents, “Don’t invite those rowdy boors here.” I pretended, then, that it was the elaborateness of such a party that I disliked."
私が夕飯ゆうめしに呼び出されたのは、それから三十分ばかり経たった後あとの事でしたが、まだ奥さんとお嬢さんの晴着はれぎが脱ぎ棄すてられたまま、次の室を乱雑に彩いろどっていました。二人は遅くなると私たちに済まないというので、飯の支度に間に合うように、急いで帰って来たのだそうです。しかし奥さんの親切はＫと私とに取ってほとんど無効も同じ事でした。私は食卓に坐りながら、言葉を惜しがる人のように、素気そっけない挨拶あいさつばかりしていました。Ｋは私よりもなお寡言かげんでした。たまに親子連おやこづれで外出した女二人の気分が、また平生へいぜいよりは勝すぐれて晴れやかだったので、我々の態度はなおの事眼に付きます。奥さんは私にどうかしたのかと聞きました。私は少し心持が悪いと答えました。実際私は心持が悪かったのです。すると今度はお嬢さんがＫに同じ問いを掛けました。Ｋは私のように心持が悪いとは答えません。ただ口が利ききたくないからだといいました。お嬢さんはなぜ口が利きたくないのかと追窮ついきゅうしました。私はその時ふと重たい瞼まぶたを上げてＫの顔を見ました。私にはＫが何と答えるだろうかという好奇心があったのです。Ｋの唇は例のように少し顫ふるえていました。それが知らない人から見ると、まるで返事に迷っているとしか思われないのです。お嬢さんは笑いながらまた何かむずかしい事を考えているのだろうといいました。Ｋの顔は心持薄赤くなりました。,"I was called to Supper Yumeshi about thirty minutes later, but the next room was messed up with my wife and daughter's sunny clothes stripped off. It was colorful. They said that it wouldn't be enough for us if they were late, so they came back in a hurry in time to prepare the meal. However, the kindness of his wife was almost the same for K and me. While sitting at the table, I was just like a person who was reluctant to say a word. K was even more humorous than I was. Our attitude is even more noticeable because the feelings of the two women who went out with their parents and children occasionally were better than Hirao and radiant. My wife asked me what was wrong. I answered that I was a little uncomfortable. In fact, I was sick. Then the young lady asked K the same question. K doesn't say he's as sick as I am. He said it was just because he didn't want to speak. The young lady wondered why she didn't want to speak. At that time, I suddenly raised my heavy eyelids and saw K's face. I was curious about what K would answer. K's lips were shaking a little as in the example. From the point of view of those who don't know it, it seems as if they are at a loss for a reply. The young lady laughed and said she was thinking about something difficult again. K's face turned pale red.","About thirty minutes later I was summoned for the evening meal. The room next door was still scattered with the bright disorder of the formal visiting kimonos that the two ladies had just taken off. They apologized to us for being late. They had hurried home, Okusan said, to be in time to prepare supper. This thoughtfulness, however, was quite lost on both K and me. At the table my responses were brief and curt, as if begrudging each word. K was even more taciturn. The two ladies were still in fine high spirits from their rare excursion together, so our black mood was starkly evident in contrast. Okusan asked me what had happened. I said I wasn’t feeling very well. This was no more than the truth. Then Ojōsan addressed the same question to K. He gave a different reply. He simply said he didn’t feel like talking. Why not? she demanded. On a sudden impulse, I raised my reluctant eyes to his face, curious to know how he would respond. K’s lips were trembling in that way he had. Anyone who did not know him would judge that he was lost for an answer. Ojōsan laughed and said he must be thinking those difficult thoughts of his again. He reddened slightly.","It was only about half an hour after this that we were called to dinner. As I passed Ojosan’s door on my way to the dining room , I saw the ladies’ going-out dresses lying in colorful disarray on the floor. They had apparently hurried home so that they might prepare our dinner. Okusan’s kindness, however, was wasted on us. During the meal, I behaved as though words were too precious a commodity to squander, and I was very brusque with the ladies. K was even more taciturn than I was. The ladies on the other hand, having returned from a rare outing, were unusually gay, which made our gloomy behavior all the more noticeable in contrast. Okusan asked me if anything was wrong. I told her that I was not feeling well. And I was being quite truthful, I assure you. Then Ojosan asked K the same question. K gave a different answer: he was simply not in a talkative mood, he said. “Why not?” she asked. I lifted my eyes, which felt dull and heavy, and looked at K. I was very curious as to what he would say. Once more, his lips were trembling slightly. To innocent eyes, it must have seemed that he was only having his usual difficulty with words. Ojosan laughed, and said that he must have been thinking about something very profound. K blushed slightly."
奥さんとお嬢さんは、親切に彼の荷物を片付ける世話や何なにかをしてくれました。すべてそれを私に対する好意から来たのだと解釈した私は、心のうちで喜びました。――Ｋが相変らずむっちりした様子をしているにもかかわらず。,"The wife and daughter kindly took care of his luggage and did something. I was delighted in my heart, interpreting it all as a favor to me. ――Even though K still looks plump.","Okusan and Ojōsan kindly helped him unpack and settle in. I was delighted, interpreting each generous gesture as an expression of their friendship for me. K, however, remained his usual dour self.","He arrived with a dignified and absent-minded air. In my normal manner, I received him. Okusan and Ojosan helped him unpack his bags, and were otherwise very kind to him. I was very happy—despite the fact that K remained his usual moody self—for I felt that their kindness to him arose out of their regard for me."
小言が一通り済んだと思った時、私は静かに席を立とうとした。父はいつ行くかと私に尋ねた。私には早いだけが好よかった。,"When I thought I had finished all the small words, I quietly tried to stand up. My dad asked me when to go. I just liked it early.","When his lecturing seemed to have run its course, I stood quietly to leave. He asked me when I was planning to go. The sooner the better, as far as I was concerned.","I listened quietly. At last, the lecture seemed to be over, and I was about to get up when my father asked me when I intended to leave. I said that I should go as soon as possible."
四十三,Fourty three,CHAPTER 97,"He gulped his food down and went back to his room, leaving us at the table."
「おれのような人間だって、月給こそ貰っちゃいないが、これでも遊んでばかりいるんじゃない」,"""Even a person like me doesn't get a monthly salary, but he's still playing.""","“Look at me, now. I don’t get a salary, but I’m far from idle, you know.”",No one can say that I do nothing.”
「大学ぐらい卒業したって、それほど結構でもありません。卒業するものは毎年何百人だってあります」,"""It's not so good to graduate from college. There are hundreds of people graduating every year.""","“There’s nothing particularly fine in graduating from the university,” I found myself responding testily. “Hundreds of people do it every year, you know.”","“You shouldn’t get so excited over such a trifling thing as a university degree,” I blurted out. “After all, several hundred students graduate every year.”"
先生は私の顔を見た。私は笑った。,The teacher looked at my face. I laughed.,Sensei looked at me. I smiled.,Sensei looked at me. I smiled.
「いいえ滅多めったに出た事はありません。近頃ちかごろは段々人の顔を見るのが嫌きらいになるようです」,"""No, I rarely see it. Nowadays, it seems that I don't like to see people's faces.""","I asked. “No, hardly ever. He seems less and less inclined to see people recently.”","I asked. “No, hardly ever. It seems that of late, he has become less inclined than ever to see people.”"
その晩私は先生といっしょに麦酒ビールを飲んだ。先生は元来酒量に乏しい人であった。ある程度まで飲んで、それで酔えなければ、酔うまで飲んでみるという冒険のできない人であった。,"That night I drank beer with my teacher. The teacher was originally a person with a poor amount of alcohol. He was a person who couldn't have the adventure of drinking to a certain extent and if he didn't get drunk, he would try drinking until he got drunk.","That evening we drank beer together. As a rule Sensei did not drink much. If a certain amount of alcohol failed to produce the desired effect, he was disinclined to experiment by drinking more.","That evening, Sensei and I drank beer together. Sensei was not a heavy drinker. He was not the sort of person to go on drinking if a reasonable amount did not have any cheering effect on him."
父は死病に罹かかっている事をとうから自覚していた。それでいて、眼前にせまりつつある死そのものには気が付かなかった。,"My father was aware that he was suffering from death and illness. Still, I didn't notice the death itself that was looming in front of me.","My father had long known that he was mortally ill. Nevertheless, he was unaware that death was now fast approaching.","My father had known for some time that his disease was fatal. But when at last death was very close, he seemed unable to recognize it."
「目的物がないから動くのです。あれば落ち付けるだろうと思って動きたくなるのです」,"""It works because there is no object. I want to move because I think it will calm me down.""","“Ah, but you’re restless precisely because there’s no object, you see? You’re driven by the feeling that if only you could find that object, you’d be at peace.”","“You are restless because your love has no object. If you could fall in love with some particular person, you wouldn’t be so restless.”"
「いえ、窮屈じゃありません」,"""No, it's not cramped.""","“I’m quite comfortable, thank you.”","“Oh, no, I am not at all uncomfortable.”"
席を立とうとした時、先生は急に私をつらまえて、「時にお父さんの病気はどうなんです」と聞いた。私は父の健康についてほとんど知るところがなかった。何ともいって来ない以上、悪くはないのだろうくらいに考えていた。,"When I was about to stand up, the teacher suddenly picked me up and asked, ""Sometimes my dad's illness."" I knew very little about my father's health. I was wondering if it wasn't bad as long as I didn't say anything.","As I rose to leave, Sensei held me back. “How is your father’s illness, by the way?” he asked. I had had very little news on the subject, I replied, so I could only assume that he was not seriously ill.","As I was about to rise, Sensei suddenly said, “By the way, how is your father?” I said that I did not know, but that I assumed that he was no worse, since the letters from home had said nothing about his health."
「じゃ奥さんも信用なさらないんですか」と先生に聞いた。,"I asked the teacher, ""Why don't you trust your wife?""",“Do you mean you don’t even trust your wife?”,“Then you have no trust in your wife either?”
「私は早速さっそくその家へ引き移りました。私は最初来た時に未亡人と話をした座敷を借りたのです。そこは宅中うちじゅうで一番好いい室へやでした。本郷辺ほんごうへんに高等下宿といった風ふうの家がぽつぽつ建てられた時分の事ですから、私は書生として占領し得る最も好い間まの様子を心得ていました。私の新しく主人となった室は、それらよりもずっと立派でした。移った当座は、学生としての私には過ぎるくらいに思われたのです。,"""I immediately moved to the house. I rented a tatami room where I talked to my widow when I first came. It was the best room in my house. Hongobe It was the time when a house like a high school boarding house was built in Hongo, so I knew what it was like to be the best time to occupy as a student. My new master's room was It was much better than those. The moment I moved, it seemed too much for me as a student.","I moved in immediately and was given the room where our initial interview had taken place. It was the best room in the house. At that time a few better-quality student boardinghouses were springing up in the Hongō area, and I had a fair idea of the top of the range in student accommodation. The room I was now master of was far finer than anything else available. When I moved in, it seemed almost too good for a simple student like me.","I moved immediately. I was given the room in which our interview had taken place. It was the finest room in the house. I had by no means been living in squalor before: by my time, there were already a few high-class boarding houses in existence in the Hongo area. I had become accustomed to living in rooms which, by student standards, were more than adequate. But my new room was far more impressive than any I had had before in Tokyo. When I first moved into it, I felt that it was perhaps a little too grand for a student."
「医者は何というのです」,"""What is a doctor?""",“What does the doctor say?”,“What does the doctor say?”
奥さんはことさらに私の方を見て笑談じょうだんらしくこういった。,The wife looked at me further and laughed like this.,"She spoke jokingly, but her eyes were fixed on me.","“I shall simply tell myself that ‘death comes to old and young alike,’ as the saying goes.”"
先生は平生からむしろ質素な服装なりをしていた。それに家内かないは小人数こにんずであった。したがって住宅も決して広くはなかった。けれどもその生活の物質的に豊かな事は、内輪にはいり込まない私の眼にさえ明らかであった。要するに先生の暮しは贅沢ぜいたくといえないまでも、あたじけなく切り詰めた無弾力性のものではなかった。,"The teacher was dressed rather plainly than Hirao. Besides, my wife was a small group of people. Therefore, the housing was never large. But the material richness of that life was even apparent to my eyes, who did not enter the inner circle. In short, the teacher's life wasn't inelastic, if not luxurious.","In fact, Sensei generally dressed quite frugally. The house was far from big, and he only had one maid. Nevertheless, even an outsider like myself could see that he led a fairly affluent life. Although his lifestyle could hardly be termed luxurious, there was no sense of pinched frugality or straitened circumstances.","Sensei was never expensively dressed. He had only one maid, and his house was by no means a large one. But even I, who was not of the family, could see clearly that he lived comfortably. One could hardly say that he lived in luxury, it is true, but on the other hand, there was obviously no necessity for him to stint himself."

先生の言葉は半分独ひとり言ごとのようであった。それですぐ後あとに尾ついて行き損なった私は、つい黙っていた。,"The teacher's words seemed to be half-selfish. So soon after I missed the tail, I was silent.","He seemed to be speaking half to himself. I missed my chance to come back with another question, and was reduced to silence.",Sensei seemed to be talking as much to himself as to me. I was at a loss as to what I should say. I kept quiet.

私の仮定ははたして誤らなかった。けれども私はただ恋の半面だけを想像に描えがき得たに過ぎなかった。先生は美しい恋愛の裏に、恐ろしい悲劇を持っていた。そうしてその悲劇のどんなに先生にとって見惨みじめなものであるかは相手の奥さんにまるで知れていなかった。奥さんは今でもそれを知らずにいる。先生はそれを奥さんに隠して死んだ。先生は奥さんの幸福を破壊する前に、まず自分の生命を破壊してしまった。,My assumption was not wrong. But I could only imagine one side of love. The teacher had a terrible tragedy behind a beautiful romance. The wife of the other party never knew how miserable the tragedy was for the teacher. His wife still doesn't know it. The teacher hid it in his wife and died. The teacher first destroyed his life before destroying his wife's happiness.,"This assumption was not far wrong, but I was able to imagine only part of the story of their love. I could not know that behind the beautiful romance lay a terrible tragedy. Moreover, Sensei’s wife had absolutely no way of understanding how devastating this tragedy had been for him. To this day she knows nothing of it. Sensei died without revealing anything to her. He chose to destroy his life before her happiness could be destroyed.","My assumption was not proved entirely wrong. But I was imagining only a small part of the truth that lay behind their love story. I could not know that there had been in Sensei’s life a frightening tragedy, inseparable from his love for his wife. Nor did his own wife know how wretched this tragedy had made him. To this day she does not know. Sensei died keeping his secret from her. Before he could destroy his wife’s happiness, he destroyed himself."
「ごろごろばかりしていやしないさ」,"""I don't just do it around""","“I don’t just laze around,” he protested.","“I do not live in complete idleness,” said Sensei, turning his head slightly in our direction."

I can't help it because I'm getting the perfect number of years when I was born. The teacher's father and mother are almost the same, you died.""","“Yes, that’s what it amounts to, isn’t it,” Sensei’s wife responded. “We each receive a given span of years, and there’s nothing we can do about it. That’s exactly what happened with Sensei’s mother and father, you know.”","“It certainly is a matter of predestination, if nothing else is,” Sensei’s wife said. “We are all given a certain number of years to live when we are born. Did you know that Sensei’s father and mother died almost simultaneously?”"
私は単に好奇心のために、並んで浜辺を下りて行く二人の後姿うしろすがたを見守っていた。すると彼らは真直まっすぐに波の中に足を踏み込んだ。そうして遠浅とおあさの磯近いそちかくにわいわい騒いでいる多人数たにんずの間あいだを通り抜けて、比較的広々した所へ来ると、二人とも泳ぎ出した。彼らの頭が小さく見えるまで沖の方へ向いて行った。それから引き返してまた一直線に浜辺まで戻って来た。掛茶屋へ帰ると、井戸の水も浴びずに、すぐ身体からだを拭ふいて着物を着て、さっさとどこへか行ってしまった。,"I was watching the backs of the two people walking side by side down the beach, just for curiosity. Then they stepped straight into the waves. Then, they passed through the space between the shallow and the rocky shore, which was so noisy, and came to a relatively spacious place, and they both started swimming. I headed offshore until their heads looked small. Then I turned back and came back straight to the beach. When I returned to Kakechaya, I immediately wiped my body and put on a kimono without bathing in the water from the well, and went somewhere quickly.","Out of nothing more than curiosity, my eyes followed the two figures as they walked side by side down to the water. Stepping straight into the waves, they made their way through the boisterous crowd gathered in the shallows close to shore, and when they reached a relatively open stretch of water, both began to swim. They swam on out to sea until their heads looked small in the distance. Then they turned around and swam straight back to the beach. Returning to the stall, they toweled themselves down without rinsing at the well, put on their clothes, and promptly headed off together for some unknown destination.","From sheer curiosity, I stood and watched the two men walk side by side towards the sea. They strode determinedly into the water, and making their way through the noisy crowd, finally reached a quieter and deeper part of the sea. Then they began to swim out, and did not stop until their heads had almost disappeared from my sight. They turned around, and swam straight back to the beach. At the tea house, they dried themselves without washing the salt off with fresh water from the well and, quickly donning their clothes, they walked away."

「私の座敷には控えの間まというような四畳が付属していました。玄関を上がって私のいる所へ通ろうとするには、ぜひこの四畳を横切らなければならないのだから、実用の点から見ると、至極しごく不便な室へやでした。私はここへＫを入れたのです。もっとも最初は同じ八畳に二つ机を並べて、次の間を共有にして置く考えだったのですが、Ｋは狭苦しくっても一人でいる方が好いいといって、自分でそっちのほうを択えらんだのです。,"""My tatami mat came with a tatami mat that looked like a ken. It's practical because you have to cross this tatami mat to go up the front door and go to where I am. From this point of view, it was a very inconvenient room. I put a K here. At first, I thought of putting two desks side by side on the same 8 tatami mats and sharing the next room. However, K said that it would be better to be alone even if he was cramped, so he chose that one himself.","From the entrance hall the only access to my room was through a little four-mat room that lay between. This anteroom, in effect a passageway, was virtually useless for practical purposes. This is where I put K. At first I re-created our previous arrangement, placing two desks side by side in my own larger room, with the idea that we would also share the small one. But K chose to make the small room exclusively his, declaring that he was happier alone no matter how cramped the space.","There was attached to my room a small anteroom of four mats. One had to go through it to get to my room from the front hall. It was not therefore very conveniently situated. I put K in there. It had been my intention to share my own room with K, and to leave the other room free for both of us to use as the occasion demanded. But K would not listen to my suggestion, saying that he would rather have a room of his own, however small it might be."
「どうせむずかしいんでしょう」と私がいった。,"""It's difficult anyway,"" I said.","“It’s not an easy illness,” I ventured.","“At any rate,” I said, “my father cannot be very well.” “I think not,” Sensei said."
「今に癒なおったらもう一返いっぺん東京へ遊びに行ってみよう。人間はいつ死ぬか分らないからな。何でもやりたい事は、生きてるうちにやっておくに限る」,"""If I'm healed now, let's go to Tokyo again. I don't know when humans will die. I want to do anything only while I'm alive.""","“When I’m well again, I might take another trip to Tokyo,” he remarked. “Who knows when you’ll die? You have to do all the things you want while you’re alive to do them.”","“When I am better,” he said, “I must go to Tokyo once more, and enjoy myself. Who knows when any of us will die? We should do all the things we want to do while we can.”"
その日取りのまだ来ないうちに、ある大きな事が起った。それは明治天皇めいじてんのうのご病気の報知であった。新聞紙ですぐ日本中へ知れ渡ったこの事件は、一軒の田舎家いなかやのうちに多少の曲折を経てようやく纏まとまろうとした私の卒業祝いを、塵ちりのごとくに吹き払った。,"A big thing happened before the day came. It was a notification of the illness of Emperor Meiji. The incident, which quickly became known throughout Japan in newspapers, blew away my graduation celebration, which was finally put together after some twists and turns in a rural house.","But before the day arrived, something important occurred: it was announced that Emperor Meiji was ill. The word spread quickly around Japan via the newspapers. The plans for the celebratory party had already upset our provincial household. Now, just when the matter seemed settled, this news came to scatter those plans like so much dust upon the wind.","Before the day of the dinner party arrived, however, an important event took place. Emperor Meiji was taken ill. This news, which was spread throughout the nation by the newspapers, reached us like a gust of wind, blowing away the plans for a graduation party which had been tentatively made, not without difficulty, in an insignificant country house."
父はその後あとをいわなかった。,My father didn't say anything after that.,He said no more.,My father then fell silent.
「大方おおかたどこかへ避暑にでも行っているんでしょう」,"""Most of the time, I'm probably going to somewhere to avoid the heat.""","“He must have gone off somewhere to escape the summer heat,” I told my mother, forced to defend him with some explanation.","“He has probably gone away on holiday,” I said to my mother, feeling that I should offer some sort of excuse for Sensei’s silence."
父はこういった。そうしてまた昏睡状態に陥った。枕辺まくらべを取り巻いている人は無言のまましばらく病人の様子を見詰めていた。やがてその中うちの一人が立って次の間まへ出た。するとまた一人立った。私も三人目にとうとう席を外はずして、自分の室へやへ来た。私には先刻さっき懐ふところへ入れた郵便物の中を開けて見ようという目的があった。それは病人の枕元でも容易にできる所作しょさには違いなかった。しかし書かれたものの分量があまりに多過ぎるので、一息ひといきにそこで読み通す訳には行かなかった。私は特別の時間を偸ぬすんでそれに充あてた。,"My father was like this. Then I fell into a coma again. The people surrounding the pillowside pillow were silently staring at the sick for a while. Eventually one of them stood up and went out to the next room. Then I stood alone again. I finally left my seat for the third person and came to my room. I had the purpose of opening the mail that I had put in my pocket earlier. It must have been an action that could be easily done even at the bedside of a sick person. However, the amount of what was written was so large that I couldn't read it all at once. I spent a special time on it.","“Thank you all very much,” my father said with careful formality, then sank back into unconsciousness. Everyone gathered around his bed watched him in silence for a while. Finally someone got up and went into the next room. Then another left. I was the third to leave at last and go off to my room. I intended to open the letter I had earlier slipped into my breast. I could, of course, easily have done this at the bedside, but the letter was evidently so long that I couldn’t have read it all then and there, so I stole some special time to myself to devote to the task.","Then again he fell into a coma. In silence, the people sitting around the dying man watched him for a while. Then one of the group got up, and went into the adjoining room. Shortly after, another got up and left. The third to go was myself. I went back to my room with the intention of opening the letter there. No doubt, I could quite easily have done so while sitting with my father. But the letter, judging by its weight, was obviously very long, and I could not have read it through in the sickroom without interruption. I had been waiting for such an opportunity as this to read it undisturbed in my own room."
Ｋはいつもに似合わない話を始めました。奥さんとお嬢さんは市ヶ谷のどこへ行ったのだろうというのです。私は大方叔母おばさんの所だろうと答えました。Ｋはその叔母さんは何だとまた聞きます。私はやはり軍人の細君さいくんだと教えてやりました。すると女の年始は大抵十五日過すぎだのに、なぜそんなに早く出掛けたのだろうと質問するのです。私はなぜだか知らないと挨拶するより外ほかに仕方がありませんでした。,"K started a story that didn't suit him all the time. Where did his wife and daughter go in Ichigaya? I replied that it was mostly my aunt's place. K asks again what the aunt is. I told him that he was a soldier, Hosono. Then she asks why she went out so early, even though she was usually over fifteen days old. I had no choice but to say hello if I didn't know why.","K began to talk in a way that was quite out of character. To which part of Ichigaya had Okusan and Ojōsan gone? he asked. I said I believed they went to the aunt’s house. Who is she? he asked. I told him she was the wife of a military officer. Why had they gone out so early in the year, when the round of New Year visits traditionally did not begin for women until after the fifteenth of January? I could only reply that I did not know.","K began to talk to me about Okusan and Ojosan. I was surprised, since he had never shown any inclination before to talk about them. “Whom are they visiting in Ichigaya?” I said that in all likelihood they had gone to see Ojosan’s aunt. “What does this aunt do?” he asked. I explained that she also was a soldier’s wife. “But is it not the custom,” he said, “for women to pay New Year visits after the middle of January? I wonder why they went so early?”"
幸さいわいにして先生の予言は実現されずに済んだ。経験のない当時の私わたくしは、この予言の中うちに含まれている明白な意義さえ了解し得なかった。私は依然として先生に会いに行った。その内うちいつの間にか先生の食卓で飯めしを食うようになった。自然の結果奥さんとも口を利きかなければならないようになった。,"Fortunately, the teacher's prophecy did not come true. At that time, inexperienced, I could not even understand the obvious significance contained in this prophecy. I still went to see my teacher. Before I knew it, I started eating rice at the teacher's table. As a result of nature, I have to speak with my wife.","Fortunately Sensei’s prophecy was not fulfilled. Inexperienced as I was, I could not grasp even the most obvious significance of his words, and continued to visit as usual. Before long I found myself occasionally dining there, which naturally put me in the position of talking to his wife.","Fortunately, Sensei was mistaken. Inexperienced as I was then, I could not even understand the obvious significance of Sensei’s remarks. I continued to see Sensei as before. And before long, I found myself dining at his house occasionally. As a result, I was obliged to speak to Sensei’s wife also."
「どうしてそう一度に死なれたんですか」,"""Why did you die all at once?""",“Why did they die so close together?”,“How was it that they died at the same time?”
「何もしていないというのは、またどういう訳かね。お前がそれほど尊敬するくらいな人なら何かやっていそうなものだがね」,"""I don't know why you're not doing anything again. If you're such a respected person, you're likely to do something.""","“So why doesn’t he do anything, eh? I’d have thought someone you respect so much would be in a profession.”","“Tell me,” said my father, not without sarcasm, “why is it that he does nothing? One would think that such a man as he, whom you seem to respect so highly, would find some kind of employment.”"
「何の口だかまだ分らないのか」と兄が聞いた。,"""I still don't know what you're talking about,"" my brother asked.",“Do you know yet what the position is?” asked my brother.,“But don’t you know yet what sort of a job it is?” asked my brother.
乃木大将のぎだいしょうの死んだ時も、父は一番さきに新聞でそれを知った。,"Even when General Nogi's Gidaisho died, my father first learned about it in the newspaper.","When General Nogi committed ritual suicide soon after the emperor’s funeral, stating that he was following his lord into death, my father was the first to learn of it from the newspaper.",My father was the first to see the news of General Nogi’s death4 in the paper.
「何にもいう事はない、何にも心配する事はない、おれはこういう性質になったんだからというだけで、取り合ってくれないんです」,"""I have nothing to say, I don't have to worry about anything, just because I have this kind of nature, I can't deal with it.""","“He says there’s nothing to talk about, and nothing to worry about, it’s simply that this is how he’s turned out.","“That there is nothing for him to tell, and that there is nothing for me to worry about. He says that it was simply in his nature to change so.”"
手紙の内容は簡単でした。そうしてむしろ抽象的でした。自分は薄志弱行はくしじゃっこうで到底行先ゆくさきの望みがないから、自殺するというだけなのです。それから今まで私に世話になった礼が、ごくあっさりとした文句でその後あとに付け加えてありました。世話ついでに死後の片付方かたづけかたも頼みたいという言葉もありました。奥さんに迷惑を掛けて済まんから宜よろしく詫わびをしてくれという句もありました。国元へは私から知らせてもらいたいという依頼もありました。必要な事はみんな一口ひとくちずつ書いてある中にお嬢さんの名前だけはどこにも見えません。私はしまいまで読んで、すぐＫがわざと回避したのだという事に気が付きました。しかし私のもっとも痛切に感じたのは、最後に墨すみの余りで書き添えたらしく見える、もっと早く死ぬべきだのになぜ今まで生きていたのだろうという意味の文句でした。,"The content of the letter was simple. Then it was rather abstract. I'm a weak man, and I have no hope of where I'm going, so I just commit suicide. Since then, the gratitude that has been taken care of by me has been added afterwards with a very simple phrase. In addition to taking care of him, there was also a word that he would like to ask how to clean up after death. There was also a phrase saying that I apologize for the inconvenience caused to my wife. There was also a request from me to let Kunimoto know. Everything you need is written bit by bit, but you can't see the name of the lady anywhere. I read it to the end and soon realized that K had deliberately avoided it. But what I felt most painful was the last word, which seemed to be added with the surplus of sumi ink, meaning why I should have died earlier and why I was alive.","The letter was simple and contained nothing specific. He was committing suicide, he wrote, because he was weak and infirm of purpose, and because the future held nothing for him. With a few brief words he thanked me for all I had done for him. As a final request, he asked me to see to his affairs after his death. He also asked me to apologize to Okusan for the trouble he was causing her and to inform his family. The letter was a series of simple statements of essential matters; the only thing missing was any mention of Ojōsan. I read it to the end and understood that K had deliberately avoided mentioning her. But it was the letter’s final words that pierced my heart most keenly. With the last of the brush’s ink, he had added that he should have died sooner and did not know why he had lived so long.","The letter was simply written. K explained his suicide only in a very general way. He had decided to die, he said, because there seemed no hope of his ever becoming the firm, resolute person that he had always wanted to be. He thanked me for my many kindnesses in the past: and as a last favor to him, would I, he asked, take care of everything after his death? He asked that I apologize to Okusan on his behalf for causing her so much trouble. And he wanted me to notify his relatives of his death. In this brief, businesslike letter, there was no mention of Ojosan. I soon realized that K had purposely avoided any reference to her. But what affected me most was his last sentence, which had perhaps been written as an afterthought: “ Why did I wait so long to die?”"
「いくら丈夫の私でも、満更まんざら考えない事もありません」,"""No matter how strong I am, I can't help thinking about it.""","“I’m in fine health, but yes, even I think this from time to time.”","I may be healthy, but that does not prevent me from thinking about death.”"
私は先生のいう事に格別注意を払わなかった。すぐ母の手紙の話をして、金の無心を申し出た。,I didn't pay particular attention to what the teacher said. Immediately I talked about my mother's letter and offered to be innocent of money.,I paid this remark no particular attention but instead proceeded to tell him about my mother’s letter and asked for a loan.,"I did not pay much attention to Sensei’s words. I brought out my mother’s letter, and I asked him for a loan."
「何もお前のためにするんじゃないとお父さんがおっしゃるんじゃないけれども、お前だって世間への義理ぐらいは知っているだろう」,"""My dad doesn't say that I'm not doing anything for you, but you know what you're doing to the world.""",“But surely you must be aware yourself of your social obligations.”,"“It isn’t that your father is saying that we are not having a party for your sake,” said my mother. “But even you must be aware of one’s duty to one’s neighbors.”"
わが家いえは動かす事のできないものと父は信じ切っていた。その中に住む母もまた命のある間は、動かす事のできないものと信じていた。自分が死んだ後あと、この孤独な母を、たった一人伽藍堂がらんどうのわが家に取り残すのもまた甚はなはだしい不安であった。それだのに、東京で好いい地位を求めろといって、私を強しいたがる父の頭には矛盾があった。私はその矛盾をおかしく思ったと同時に、そのお蔭かげでまた東京へ出られるのを喜んだ。,"My father believed that my house couldn't be moved. The mother who lived in it also believed that she could not move for the life of her life. It was also a great worry to leave this lonely mother in my house, which was the only one in the temple after I died. And yet, there was a contradiction in my father's mind, who wanted to strengthen me, asking me to seek a good position in Tokyo. I was crazy about the contradiction, and at the same time I was delighted to be back in Tokyo thanks to it.","My father was of the firm belief that there could be no change in the house, and that my mother would remain there until the day she died. The thought of leaving her to live out her lonely existence in this echoing shell of a place filled him with anxiety, and yet he was insisting I find a job in Tokyo. I found this contradiction rather funny, but it also pleased me, since it meant I could go back to live in the city.","For him, the house was the family home, and he would never have contemplated living anywhere else. He took it for granted, too, that my mother would remain there until she died. The thought, therefore, of my mother living in solitude in the big house gave him considerable anxiety. That he should, at the same time, insist on my going to Tokyo to find a decent position struck me as being inconsistent. This inconsistency on his part amused me. Also, I welcomed it, since I could go to Tokyo with his full approval."
私は父や母の手前、この地位をできるだけの努力で求めつつあるごとくに装おわなくてはならなかった。私は先生に手紙を書いて、家の事情を精くわしく述べた。もし自分の力でできる事があったら何でもするから周旋してくれと頼んだ。私は先生が私の依頼に取り合うまいと思いながらこの手紙を書いた。また取り合うつもりでも、世間の狭い先生としてはどうする事もできまいと思いながらこの手紙を書いた。しかし私は先生からこの手紙に対する返事がきっと来るだろうと思って書いた。,"Before my father and mother, I had to dress as if I was seeking this position with all my might. I wrote a letter to my teacher and elaborated on the circumstances of my house. If there was anything I could do on my own, I would do anything, so I asked him to go around. I wrote this letter thinking that the teacher wouldn't meet my request. I wrote this letter thinking that I could do anything as a small teacher, even if I was going to fight again. However, I thought that the teacher would reply to this letter.","In their company I was forced to pretend that I was doing my very best to look for a job. I wrote to Sensei, explaining the situation at home in great detail. I asked if he could recommend me for any position, and I assured him that I’d be happy to do whatever was in my power. As I wrote, I was aware that he was unlikely to take any notice of my request, and that even if he wished to help me, he lacked the contacts to be able to do so. But I did think that the letter would at least elicit a response from him.","I dared not allow my father and mother to think that I was not trying hard to find a post. I wrote to Sensei, and explained the situation at home. I said that I was willing to do any kind of work so long as I was qualified for it, and asked him to help me find an opening somewhere. I wrote the letter believing that Sensei would take no notice of my request. Besides, I thought to myself, even if he wished to help me, he could do very little, since he led such a secluded life. I was certain, however, that he would answer my letter."
私は彼に向って、余計な仕事をするのは止よせといいました。そうして当分身体からだを楽にして、遊ぶ方が大きな将来のために得策だと忠告しました。剛情ごうじょうなＫの事ですから、容易に私のいう事などは聞くまいと、かねて予期していたのですが、実際いい出して見ると、思ったよりも説き落すのに骨が折れたので弱りました。Ｋはただ学問が自分の目的ではないと主張するのです。意志の力を養って強い人になるのが自分の考えだというのです。それにはなるべく窮屈な境遇にいなくてはならないと結論するのです。普通の人から見れば、まるで酔興すいきょうです。その上窮屈な境遇にいる彼の意志は、ちっとも強くなっていないのです。彼はむしろ神経衰弱に罹かかっているくらいなのです。私は仕方がないから、彼に向って至極しごく同感であるような様子を見せました。自分もそういう点に向って、人生を進むつもりだったとついには明言しました。（もっともこれは私に取ってまんざら空虚な言葉でもなかったのです。Ｋの説を聞いていると、段々そういうところに釣り込まれて来るくらい、彼には力があったのですから）。最後に私はＫといっしょに住んで、いっしょに向上の路みちを辿たどって行きたいと発議ほつぎしました。私は彼の剛情を折り曲げるために、彼の前に跪ひざまずく事をあえてしたのです。そうして漸やっとの事で彼を私の家に連れて来ました。,"I told him to stop doing extra work. Then, for the time being, I advised that it is better to relax the body and play for a big future. I had expected that I wouldn't listen to what I said easily because it was a stubborn K, but when I actually put it out, it was harder to explain than I expected. I'm weakened. K just insists that scholarship is not his purpose. It is my idea to develop the power of will and become a strong person. We conclude that we must be in a cramped situation as much as possible. From an ordinary person's point of view, it's almost like getting drunk. Moreover, his will in a cramped situation has not strengthened at all. He is rather suffering from memory weakness. I couldn't help it, so I seemed to agree with him very much. I finally made it clear that I was going to move forward in my life toward that point. (But this wasn't a very empty word for me, because when I heard K's theory, he was so powerful that he was gradually caught in such a place). Finally, I lived with K and proposed that I would like to follow the path of improvement together. I dared to kneel in front of him in order to bend his stubbornness. Then I finally brought him to my house.","I advised him to give up all unnecessary work, and added that for the sake of that great future of his, he would be wise to relax and enjoy himself more. I knew it would be difficult to get this message through to my stubborn friend, but when the time came for me to say my piece, it took even more persuasion than I had anticipated, and I struggled to hold my ground. He countered me by asserting that scholarship was not his primary aim; his goal was to develop a toughness of will that would make him strong, and to this end his circumstances must remain as straitened as possible. From any normal point of view, this determination was wildly eccentric. Furthermore, the situation to which he chose to cling was doing nothing to strengthen his will—indeed, it was rapidly driving him to nervous collapse. All I could do was present myself as deeply sympathetic. I declared that I too intended to pursue a similar course in life. (In fact, these were no empty words—K’s power was such that I felt myself increasingly drawn by his views.) Finally, I proposed that he and I should live together and work to improve ourselves. In effect, I chose to give in to him in order to be able to bend his will. And with this, at last, I brought him to the house.","I said to him that he should do no more work than was necessary. I told him that for the good of his own great future, he should rest and enjoy himself. Knowing K’s stubbornness, I did not expect to find my task easy. But once begun, I found it far more difficult and exasperating than I had ever imagined. He held that scholarly knowledge was not his only objective. What was important, he said, was that he should become a strong person through the exercise of will-power. Apparently, this could be done only by living in straitened circumstances. Judged by the standards of a normal person, he was perhaps a little mad. Moreover, straitened circumstances seemed not at all to be strengthening his will-power. Indeed, they were making a neurotic out of him. In desperation, I pretended to be in wholehearted agreement with his views. It had always been my wish, I said, to lead a life such as his. (I was not being totally insincere. I had always found K persuasive in argument, and he could momentarily convince me of almost anything.) Finally, I suggested that he live with me, so that I might learn to lead his kind of life. Because of his stubbornness, I was forced to bow to him. At last, I succeeded in bringing him to the house."
私はついにこんな口の利ききようをした。すると父が変な顔をした。,I finally did something like this. Then my father made a strange face.,My father’s expression changed.,My father looked at me strangely.
四,four,CHAPTER 4,And I was filled with a new and deep sense of disappointment.
私が帰ったのは七月の五、六日で、父や母が私の卒業を祝うために客を呼ぼうといいだしたのは、それから一週間後ごであった。そうしていよいよと極きめた日はそれからまた一週間の余も先になっていた。時間に束縛を許さない悠長な田舎いなかに帰った私は、お蔭かげで好もしくない社交上の苦痛から救われたも同じ事であったが、私を理解しない母は少しもそこに気が付いていないらしかった。,"I returned on the 5th and 6th of July, and it was only a week later that my father and mother offered to invite guests to celebrate my graduation. The day when I decided to do so was more than a week ahead. Returning to a laid-back countryside that doesn't allow time constraints, I was saved from the unpleasant social pain that I didn't like, but my mother, who didn't understand me, noticed it a little. It didn't seem to be.","I had returned on the fifth or sixth of July, and my parents had begun to talk about the celebration a week later. The date that had finally been chosen was over a week after this. This leisurely country approach, free of any sense of urgency, had spared me the social occasion I so disliked. But my uncomprehending mother seemed unaware of my relief.","I had come home on the fifth or sixth of July, and it was about a week after that that my parents had started discussing plans for the dinner. They had then decided to hold it the following week. One might say that due to the easygoing ways of my parents who, like all country people, could do nothing in a hurry, I had been spared an unpleasant social obligation. But my mother, who did not understand me, could not see this."
「ありがとう」,"""Thank you""",“Thank you.”,“Thank you.”
「だから出やしません。癒なおるとも癒らないとも片付かないうちは、ちゃんとこうしているつもりです」,"""That's why I won't give it up. I'm going to do this properly until I can get rid of it, whether it's healed or not.""","“Exactly. And I’ll be staying here till we know what the story is, whether he gets better or not.”","“I do not intend to go to Tokyo. I intend to stay here, until we know what will become of him.”"
「君は私がなぜ毎月まいげつ雑司ヶ谷ぞうしがやの墓地に埋うまっている友人の墓へ参るのか知っていますか」,"""Do you know why I visit the grave of a friend buried in the graveyard of Zoshigaya Zoshigaya every month?""",“Do you know why I go every month to visit my friend’s grave in Zōshigaya?”,“Do you know why I go every month to my friend’s grave in Zoshigaya?”
学年の終りに、私はまた行李こうりを絡からげて、親の墓のある田舎いなかへ帰って来ました。そうして去年と同じように、父母ちちははのいたわが家いえの中で、また叔父おじ夫婦とその子供の変らない顔を見ました。私は再びそこで故郷ふるさとの匂においを嗅かぎました。その匂いは私に取って依然として懐かしいものでありました。一学年の単調を破る変化としても有難いものに違いなかったのです。,"At the end of the school year, I returned to the countryside where my parents' graves were, with Yukuri Kouri entwined again. Then, just like last year, I saw the unchanging faces of my uncle and his uncle and their children in my home. I smelled the scent of my hometown again there. The smell was still nostalgic for me. It must have been a thankful change to break the monotony of the first grade.","At the end of the school year I once more packed my trunk and returned to the home that held my parents’ graves. Once again I found my uncle and aunt and their children in the house where my parents used to live. Nothing had changed. I breathed again the familiar scent of my home, a scent still filled with nostalgic memories. Needless to say, I also welcomed being back there as a relief from the monotony of the year’s studies.","At the end of that academic year, I packed my bag once more and returned to my parents’ resting place. In my house, where once my father and mother had lived, I saw the cheerful faces of my uncle and his family. Again I was able to breathe the air of my native place, which was as dear to me then as it ever was before. It was good to be back after a year of student life. But I was not allowed to enjoy for long the familiar surroundings which had become almost a part of me."
三十四,thirty four,CHAPTER 34,"“I do not live in complete idleness,” said Sensei, turning his head slightly in our direction."
「しかし手紙じゃ用は足りませんよ。どうせ、九月にでもなって、私が東京へ出てからでなくっちゃ」,"""But letters aren't enough. Anyway, I have to go to Tokyo in September.""","“But a letter by itself isn’t enough,” I said. “Nothing will happen unless I’m there in person. I really ought to go back to Tokyo around September.”","“I should warn you, however,” I said, “that merely writing a letter won’t be enough. I must go up to Tokyo—perhaps in September.”"
三,three,CHAPTER 3,"I was further disappointed when I returned, dripping wet, to the tea house: he had already dressed, and was on his way out."
先生は苦笑さえしなかった。二人の男女を視線の外ほかに置くような方角へ足を向けた。それから私にこう聞いた。,The teacher didn't even smile. I turned my foot in a direction that puts the two men and women outside the line of sight. Then I asked me:,"Sensei’s face remained stony, and he set off walking away from the couple. When they were hidden from our view, he spoke.",There was not even a trace of a smile on Sensei’s face. He began deliberately to walk away from the couple. He then said to me:
「なぜでもない、ただ聞いてみるのさ。それとも己おれの方がお前より前に片付くかな。大抵世間じゃ旦那だんなが先で、細君さいくんが後へ残るのが当り前のようになってるね」,"""No, just ask. Or maybe I'll get rid of it before you. Most of the time, it's normal for my husband to come first and Hosono to stay behind. ""","“No particular reason, I’m just asking. Or will I move on before you do? The general rule is that the husband goes first, and the wife is left behind.”",“Why? I was just wondering. Or will I die first? It appears that women usually outlive their husbands.”
私は父からその後あとを聞こうとした。父は話したくなさそうであったが、とうとうこういった。,"I tried to hear from my father after that. My dad didn't want to talk, but he finally did.","I asked him what he meant. He seemed disinclined to talk about it at first but finally said, “What I mean is,","I asked him what he meant. He seemed reluctant to tell me, but finally he said:"
先生の談話は、この犬と小供のために、結末まで進行する事ができなくなったので、私はついにその要領を得ないでしまった。先生の気にする財産云々うんぬんの掛念けねんはその時の私わたくしには全くなかった。私の性質として、また私の境遇からいって、その時の私には、そんな利害の念に頭を悩ます余地がなかったのである。考えるとこれは私がまだ世間に出ないためでもあり、また実際その場に臨まないためでもあったろうが、とにかく若い私にはなぜか金の問題が遠くの方に見えた。,"The teacher's discourse couldn't progress to the end because of this dog and his servant, so I finally didn't get the point. At that time, I didn't have any thoughts about the property that the teacher cares about. By my nature and by my circumstances, I couldn't afford to worry about such interests at that time. I think this was because I wasn't out in the world yet, and maybe because I wasn't there, but for some reason the money problem seemed far away to me as a young man.","Owing to the interruption, my conversation with Sensei never reached its proper conclusion, so I failed to discover what he was driving at. In those days, though, I felt none of his concerns about property and inheritance and so on. Both by nature and by circumstance, I was not inclined to bother my head over profit and gain. In retrospect, I realize that the whole question of money was still distant for me—I had never had to earn my own living, let alone personally confront the situation Sensei spoke of.","Sensei would have made the purpose of his remarks clearer to me, had it not been for the sudden appearance of the dog and the boy. And I was left, for the moment, somewhat uncertain as to why Sensei should have spoken to me thus. Indeed, I did not share Sensei’s interest in such matters as money, inheritance, and so on, partly because of my relatively easy circumstances, and partly because of my nature. Now, when I think of myself at that time, I see how unworldly I was. If I had known the meaning of material hardship then, I would have listened to Sensei more carefully. At any rate, money seemed to me a very distant problem."
「その時私はしきりに人間らしいという言葉を使いました。Ｋはこの人間らしいという言葉のうちに、私が自分の弱点のすべてを隠しているというのです。なるほど後から考えれば、Ｋのいう通りでした。しかし人間らしくない意味をＫに納得させるためにその言葉を使い出した私には、出立点しゅったつてんがすでに反抗的でしたから、それを反省するような余裕はありません。私はなおの事自説を主張しました。するとＫが彼のどこをつらまえて人間らしくないというのかと私に聞くのです。私は彼に告げました。――君は人間らしいのだ。あるいは人間らし過ぎるかも知れないのだ。けれども口の先だけでは人間らしくないような事をいうのだ。また人間らしくないように振舞おうとするのだ。,"""At that time, I used the word human-like all the time. K says that I hide all my weaknesses in this human-like word. Well, when I think about it later, it was exactly what K said. But as I used the word to convince K of a non-human meaning, I couldn't afford to reflect on it because the starting point was already rebellious. I insisted on my theory, and then I asked me where K wasn't human-like. I told him-you're human-like, or maybe you're too human-like. However, it means something that is not human-like with just the tip of the mouth. It also tries to behave in a way that is not human-like.","In those days I was in the habit of using the adjective human. K maintained that this favorite expression of mine was actually a cover for all my personal weaknesses. Thinking back on it now, I can see his point. But I had originally begun to use the word out of resistance to K, in order to convince him of his lack of human feelings, so I was not in a position to consider the question objectively. I stuck to my guns and reiterated my argument. K then demanded to know just what it was in him that I believed lacked this quality. “You’re perfectly human, indeed you’re even too human” was my response. “It’s just that when you talk, the things you say lack humanity. And the same goes for your behavior.”","I remember that I used constantly the word “human” in defending my position and in attacking his. K insisted that I was trying to hide all my weaknesses behind this word. Now, I see that he was right. But in trying to point out his limitations I had become aggressive, and I was in no mood to be objective about myself. I became more dogmatic than ever. Finally, he asked me why it was that I considered him unhuman. I told him that he was indeed human—perhaps too much so; but that one would never guess this from his words. Moreover, I said, he was trying too hard to live and act in a way that was not natural to human beings."
私は兄に向かって、自分の使っているイゴイストという言葉の意味がよく解わかるかと聞き返してやりたかった。,"I wanted to ask my brother if he could understand the meaning of the word ""Igoist"" that he used.","I felt like retorting that my brother didn’t seem to understand the meaning of the word egoist, which he was bandying about.",I was tempted to ask my brother if he knew what he was talking about when he used the word “egoist.”
Ｋが理想と現実の間に彷徨ほうこうしてふらふらしているのを発見した私は、ただ一打ひとうちで彼を倒す事ができるだろうという点にばかり眼を着けました。そうしてすぐ彼の虚きょに付け込んだのです。私は彼に向って急に厳粛な改まった態度を示し出しました。無論策略からですが、その態度に相応するくらいな緊張した気分もあったのですから、自分に滑稽こっけいだの羞恥しゅうちだのを感ずる余裕はありませんでした。私はまず「精神的に向上心のないものは馬鹿ばかだ」といい放ちました。これは二人で房州ぼうしゅうを旅行している際、Ｋが私に向って使った言葉です。私は彼の使った通りを、彼と同じような口調で、再び彼に投げ返したのです。しかし決して復讐ふくしゅうではありません。私は復讐以上に残酷な意味をもっていたという事を自白します。私はその一言いちごんでＫの前に横たわる恋の行手ゆくてを塞ふさごうとしたのです。,"When I found K wandering between ideals and reality, I just noticed that I could beat him with just one stroke. Immediately after that, he took advantage of his emptiness. I suddenly showed a solemn and changed attitude towards him. Of course, it was a trick, but I felt nervous enough to match that attitude, so I couldn't afford to feel the shame of being humorous. First of all, I said, ""Things without mental aspirations are stupid."" This is the word K used for me when we were traveling together in Boshu. I threw the street he used back at him again, in a tone similar to him. But it's not revenge. I confess that it was more cruel than revenge. In one word, I tried to block the love affair lying in front of K.","Now I understood that he had lost his way in a labyrinth between his ideals and reality, I felt with conviction that I could knock him down with a single blow. My eyes fixed on this purpose, I stepped straight into the breach. I grew instantly solemn. It was part of my strategy, but in fact I was tense enough for it to feel perfectly natural, so I was in no position to notice that I was behaving shamefully, even comically. I began by tossing back at him the statement “anyone without spiritual aspirations is a fool,” the words he had used against me on our journey around Bōshū I threw them at him in precisely the tone he had used to me then. I didn’t do it vindictively, however. I confess that I had a crueler aim than mere revenge. I wanted with these words to block K’s way to love.","I could think of only one thing, and that was K’s defenselessness. He was hovering uncertainly between the world of reality and the world of his ideals. Now is the time, I thought, to destroy my opponent. I waited no longer to make my thrust. I turned to him with a solemn air. True, the solemnity was a part of my tactics, but it was certainly in keeping with the way I felt. And I was too tense to see anything comical or shameful in what I was doing. I said cruelly, “Anyone who has no spiritual aspirations is an idiot.” This was what K had said to me when we were traveling in Boshu. I threw back at him the very words that he had once used to humiliate me. Even my tone of voice was the same as his had been when he made the remark. But I insist that I was not being vindictive. I confess to you that what I was trying to do was far more cruel than mere revenge. I wanted to destroy whatever hope there might have been in his love for Ojosan."
私はそこに坐って、よく書物をひろげました。Ｋは何もせずに黙っている方が多かったのです。私にはそれが考えに耽ふけっているのか、景色に見惚みとれているのか、もしくは好きな想像を描えがいているのか、全く解わからなかったのです。私は時々眼を上げて、Ｋに何をしているのだと聞きました。Ｋは何もしていないと一口ひとくち答えるだけでした。私は自分の傍そばにこうじっとして坐っているものが、Ｋでなくって、お嬢さんだったらさぞ愉快だろうと思う事がよくありました。それだけならまだいいのですが、時にはＫの方でも私と同じような希望を抱いだいて岩の上に坐っているのではないかしらと忽然こつぜん疑い出すのです。すると落ち付いてそこに書物をひろげているのが急に厭になります。私は不意に立ち上あがります。そうして遠慮のない大きな声を出して怒鳴どなります。纏まとまった詩だの歌だのを面白そうに吟ぎんずるような手緩てぬるい事はできないのです。ただ野蛮人のごとくにわめくのです。ある時私は突然彼の襟頸えりくびを後ろからぐいと攫つかみました。こうして海の中へ突き落したらどうするといってＫに聞きました。Ｋは動きませんでした。後ろ向きのまま、ちょうど好いい、やってくれと答えました。私はすぐ首筋を抑おさえた手を放しました。,"I sat there and often spread the books. Many of K did nothing and kept silent. I had no idea if it was indulging in thought, fascinated by the scenery, or drawing a favorite imagination. I looked up from time to time and asked K what he was doing. K just slammed that he wasn't doing anything. I often thought that it would be fun if the one sitting by my side was not K but a young lady. That's fine, but sometimes K suddenly suspects that he's sitting on a rock with the same hope as I do. Then, it suddenly becomes unpleasant to calm down and spread the books there. I suddenly stand up. Then he yells out loud without hesitation. It is not possible to loosen and lukewarmly scrutinize a poem or song that is organized in a funny way. It just screams like a barbarian. At one point I suddenly grabbed his neck collar from behind. I asked K what to do if I pushed it into the sea like this. K didn't move. While facing backwards, I answered that it was just right and that I should do it. I immediately let go of the hand that held my neck down.","I frequently read while sitting on the rocks, while K spent most of his time sitting silently. Was he lost in thought, or gazing at the scene before him, or intent on some happy fantasy? I had no idea. Occasionally I glanced up and asked what he was doing. Nothing, he replied simply. I often thought how pleasant it would be if Ojōsan, rather than K, were sitting there beside me. This was all very well, but I sometimes felt a stab of suspicion that K might be thinking the same thing. Whenever this occurred to me, I found I could no longer sit calmly reading. I rose abruptly to my feet and let out a great unrestrained yell. I couldn’t dispel my pent-up feelings in a civilized manner, such as blandly declaiming some poem or song. All I could do was howl like a savage. Once, I grabbed K by the scruff of the neck and demanded to know what he would do if I tossed him into the sea. K remained motionless. “Good idea. Go right ahead,” he replied without turning. I quickly let go.","Often, I took books with me to the rocks, and read them there. K, on the other hand, usually did nothing, and sat near me in silence. I could not decide whether he was meditating, or drinking in the beauty around him, or simply daydreaming. I would occasionally look up and ask him what he was doing. “Nothing,” he would say. Often, I found myself thinking how nice it would be if the person sitting so quietly by my side was not K, but Ojosan. Unfortunately, this pleasant thought invariably led me further to the point where I would begin to wonder whether K was not sitting there indulging in exactly the same reverie. Then I would become restless, and cease to enjoy the book I happened to be reading; and I would begin to shout in a loud voice. I could find no satisfaction in such mild forms of emotional release as reciting a poem or singing a song. Instead, I shouted as an uncontrolled savage might have done. Once, I grabbed K’s neck from behind. “What would you do,” I said, “if I pushed you into the sea?” K did not move. Without looking back, he said: “That would be pleasant. Please do.” Quickly, I withdrew the hand that had been holding his neck."
私が何ともいわずに席を立ち掛けると、奥さんは急に改まった調子になって、私にどう思うかと聞くのです。その聞き方は何をどう思うのかと反問しなければ解わからないほど不意でした。それがお嬢さんを早く片付けた方が得策だろうかという意味だと判然はっきりした時、私はなるべく緩ゆっくらな方がいいだろうと答えました。奥さんは自分もそう思うといいました。,"When I stood up without saying anything, my wife suddenly got into a different tone and asked me what she thought. The way I heard it was so surprising that I couldn't understand it without asking what I thought. When it became clear that it was a good idea to get rid of the young lady early, I replied that it would be better to be as loose as possible. The wife said she thought so too.","As I was standing wordlessly to leave, Okusan suddenly grew serious. “What’s your opinion?” she asked. Confused by the unexpected question, I had to ask what she meant. She wanted to know, she explained, whether I thought an early marriage was a good idea. I said I thought it wise to take things slowly. “I think so too,” she replied.","I said no more, and I was about to stand up when Okusan suddenly said to me in a serious tone, “What do you think?” Her question was so sudden that for a moment, I wondered what she was talking about. Then I realized that she was asking me whether or not her daughter should get married soon. “Oh, I think that she should wait a while, don’t you?” I said. Okusan said that she thought so too."
「つまり下くだらない事だと悟っていらっしゃるんでしょうか」,"""In other words, do you realize that it's a silly thing?""",“You mean he realizes how trivial it is?” “Realizes . . .,“I suppose he sees that it would be a vain thing to do?”
先生は私のこの問いに答えようとはしなかった。,The teacher didn't try to answer this question for me.,Sensei made no attempt to respond to this.,Sensei did not answer my question. He said:
「手紙を書くのは訳はないですが、こういう事は郵便じゃとても埒らちは明きませんよ。どうしても自分で東京へ出て、じかに頼んで廻まわらなくっちゃ」,"""There is no reason to write a letter, but this kind of thing is not very clear by mail. I have to go to Tokyo by myself and ask for it directly.""","“It’s easy enough to write a letter,” I said, “but this isn’t the sort of matter that gets solved through the mail. I have to go to Tokyo and present myself in person.”","“It’s easy enough to write letters,” I said, “but really, one can’t arrange such things by mail. I must go to Tokyo and look around for myself.”"
或ある時はあまりＫの様子が強くて高いので、私はかえって安心した事もあります。そうして自分の疑いを腹の中で後悔すると共に、同じ腹の中で、Ｋに詫わびました。詫びながら自分が非常に下等な人間のように見えて、急に厭いやな心持になるのです。しかし少時しばらくすると、以前の疑いがまた逆戻りをして、強く打ち返して来ます。すべてが疑いから割り出されるのですから、すべてが私には不利益でした。容貌ようぼうもＫの方が女に好かれるように見えました。性質も私のようにこせこせしていないところが、異性には気に入るだろうと思われました。どこか間まが抜けていて、それでどこかに確しっかりした男らしいところのある点も、私よりは優勢に見えました。学力がくりきになれば専門こそ違いますが、私は無論Ｋの敵でないと自覚していました。――すべて向うの好いいところだけがこう一度に眼先めさきへ散らつき出すと、ちょっと安心した私はすぐ元の不安に立ち返るのです。,"At one point, the appearance of K was so strong and high that I was relieved. Then I regretted my doubt in my stomach and apologized to K in the same stomach. I apologize for the fact that I look like a very inferior person and suddenly feel uncomfortable. However, after a while, the previous suspicions revert and come back strongly. Everything was detrimental to me because everything was determined from doubt. It seemed that K was preferred by women. I thought that I would like the opposite sex, though the nature is not as sloppy as I am. The fact that there was something wrong with it, and that there was something solid and masculine, also seemed to be superior to me. If my academic ability becomes clear, my specialty will be different, but of course I knew that I was not an enemy of K. ――When all the good points are scattered all at once, I feel a little relieved and immediately return to my original anxiety.","Sometimes, though, I found K’s fiercely principled stance toward the world reassuring. Then I would regret ever doubting him and silently apologize for my suspicions. In this state of mind, I seemed a deeply inferior person and suddenly despised myself. But then the same old doubts would sweep back in and reassert themselves with renewed force. Since I deduced everything on the basis of suspicion, all my conclusions cast me in a disadvantageous light. It seemed to me that K was handsomer and more attractive to women than I, and that my fussiness made my personality less appealing to the opposite sex. His combination of firm manliness with something a little absurd, also struck me as superior. Nor did I feel myself a match for him in scholarly ability, although of course our fields differed. With all his advantages so constantly before my eyes, any momentary relief from my fears soon reverted to the old anxieties.","There were times, however, when I found some consolation in his apparent high-mindedness. And I would regret having suspected such a person, and inwardly apologize to him. I would then begin to hate myself for my baseness. I was never contrite for long, however. For very soon, I would be assailed by the same old doubts. At such times, I would compare myself with K—always unfavorably, of course, since the desire to compare originated in doubt. Surely, I would tell myself, he is better-looking than I; and his nature too, which seemed so much less fussy than my own, must be more appealing to the opposite sex. As for his absent-minded air, would not women say that that was a sign of manly strength? True, we were studying different subjects, but I knew only too well that in intellectual ability , I was not his equal either. All in all, I would decide, I was a rather unappealing fellow in comparison. And so my momentary relief would soon be replaced by my old fears."
話はとうとう愚図愚図ぐずぐずになってしまった。そのうちに昏睡こんすいが来た。例の通り何も知らない母は、それをただの眠りと思い違えてかえって喜んだ。「まあああして楽に寝られれば、傍はたにいるものも助かります」といった。,"The story has finally become a foolish figure. Then came a coma. As usual, my mother, who knew nothing, misunderstood it as just a sleep and was delighted. ""Well, if you can sleep comfortably, it will help those who are by your side.""","The question ended up bogged down in indecision. And then my father slipped into unconsciousness. My mother, as innocent as ever, mistook it for sleep, and was quite pleased. “It’s a relief for everyone around if he can sleep as well as this,” she said.","On the other hand, perhaps it would be wrong of us to bring up the subject.” Before we could reach a decision, my father fell into a coma. My mother, in her usual way, failed to see what had really happened. She was indeed very pleased, thinking that my father was sleeping peacefully. “Thank goodness he is still able to sleep like that,” she said. “We can now relax.”"
「死んだつもりで生きて行こうと決心した私の心は、時々外界の刺戟しげきで躍おどり上がりました。しかし私がどの方面かへ切って出ようと思い立つや否いなや、恐ろしい力がどこからか出て来て、私の心をぐいと握り締めて少しも動けないようにするのです。そうしてその力が私にお前は何をする資格もない男だと抑おさえ付けるようにいって聞かせます。すると私はその一言いちげんで直すぐぐたりと萎しおれてしまいます。しばらくしてまた立ち上がろうとすると、また締め付けられます。私は歯を食いしばって、何で他ひとの邪魔をするのかと怒鳴り付けます。不可思議な力は冷ひややかな声で笑います。自分でよく知っているくせにといいます。私はまたぐたりとなります。,"""My heart, which I decided to live with the intention of dying, was sometimes struck by the stimulus of the outside world, but as soon as I decided to cut out to which direction, the terrifying power Come out of somewhere and clench my heart so that I can't move at all, and that power tells me that you're a man who isn't qualified to do anything. Let me tell you, then I'll just swear, and I'll quickly wither. If I try to stand up again after a while, I'll be tightened again. I'm clenching my teeth and why do I get in the way of others? I yell at you. Mysterious powers laugh with a chilly voice. It's a habit I know well. I'm straddling.","Though I had resolved to live as if I were dead, some external stimulus would occasionally set my heart dancing. But the moment I felt the urge to break through my deathly impasse and act, a terrible force would rise up out of nowhere and press me fiercely back into immobility. A voice would bear down on me with the words You have no right, and I would instantly wilt and go limp. When a little later I tried to rise again, again this force would press me back. I ground my teeth in impotent rage. “Why do you stand in my way like this?” I would cry. The strange force would laugh coldly back at me and reply, You know very well why. And again my will would collapse.","But as soon as I tried to break my way through the cloud that surrounded me, a frighteningly powerful force would rush upon me from I know not where, and grip my heart tight, until I could not move. A voice would say to me: “You have no right to do anything. Stay where you are.” Whatever desire I might have had for action would suddenly leave me. After a moment, the desire would come back, and I would once more try to break through. Again, I would be restrained. In fury and grief, I would cry out: “Why do you stop me?” With a cruel laugh, the voice would answer: “You know very well why.” Then I would bow in hopeless surrender."
我々は真黒になって東京へ帰りました。帰った時は私の気分がまた変っていました。人間らしいとか、人間らしくないとかいう小理屈こりくつはほとんど頭の中に残っていませんでした。Ｋにも宗教家らしい様子が全く見えなくなりました。おそらく彼の心のどこにも霊がどうの肉がどうのという問題は、その時宿っていなかったでしょう。二人は異人種のような顔をして、忙しそうに見える東京をぐるぐる眺ながめました。それから両国りょうごくへ来て、暑いのに軍鶏しゃもを食いました。Ｋはその勢いきおいで小石川こいしかわまで歩いて帰ろうというのです。体力からいえばＫよりも私の方が強いのですから、私はすぐ応じました。,"We turned black and returned to Tokyo. When I got home, my mood changed again. There were almost no sneaky shoes left in my head that were human-like or non-human-like. K also no longer looks like a religionist. Perhaps nowhere in his heart was the question of what the spirit was and what the flesh was. The two looked like interracial faces and looked around Tokyo, which seemed to be busy. Then I came to Ryogoku and ate a game chicken shamo even though it was hot. K is going to walk back to Koishikawa Koishikawa with that momentum. In terms of physical strength, I am stronger than K, so I responded immediately.","We arrived back in Tokyo burned black by the sun. By this time I was in yet another frame of mind. Concepts such as “human” and other futile abstractions had all but vanished from my head. K, for his part, showed no more traces of the religious ascetic; he too, I am sure, was no longer troubling himself with the question of the spirit and the flesh. We gaped about us at the swirling life of Tokyo, like two visitors from another world. Then we set off for the Ryōkoku district,1 where we had a chicken dinner. So fortified, K suggested we walk back home to Koishikawa. I was physically the stronger, so I readily agreed.","Burnt almost black by the sun, we returned to Tokyo. My state of mind had changed greatly by then, and such petty considerations as K’s human qualities or his lack of them had ceased to worry me very much. K, too, had lost most of his piousness. I doubt that the problem of body and soul was worrying him at all then. Like two barbarians, we stared at the busy scene around us. We stopped at Ryogoku and, despite the heat, treated ourselves to a meal of game hen. This seemed to fortify K, and he suggested that we walk all the way to Koishikawa. I had a more robust constitution than K, and I assented readily enough."
私がこう聞き返した時、先生は何とも答えなかった。ただ私の顔を見て「あなたは幾歳いくつですか」といった。,"When I asked back, the teacher didn't answer at all. I just looked at my face and said, ""How old are you?""","I asked in return. Sensei did not reply. He just looked at me and said, “How old are you?”","Sensei did not answer me. Instead, he looked at me, and said, “How old are you?”"
先生は苦笑した。,The teacher smiled bitterly.,"What I’d like is for you to make sure,","Sensei smiled wryly, and said:"

同時に彼と養家との関係は、段々こん絡がらがって来ました。時間に余裕のなくなった彼は、前のように私と話す機会を奪われたので、私はついにその顚末てんまつを詳しく聞かずにしまいましたが、解決のますます困難になってゆく事だけは承知していました。人が仲に入って調停を試みた事も知っていました。その人は手紙でＫに帰国を促うながしたのですが、Ｋは到底駄目だめだといって、応じませんでした。この剛情ごうじょうなところが、――Ｋは学年中で帰れないのだから仕方がないといいましたけれども、向うから見れば剛情でしょう。そこが事態をますます険悪にしたようにも見えました。彼は養家の感情を害すると共に、実家の怒いかりも買うようになりました。私が心配して双方を融和するために手紙を書いた時は、もう何の効果ききめもありませんでした。私の手紙は一言ひとことの返事さえ受けずに葬られてしまったのです。私も腹が立ちました。今までも行掛ゆきがかり上、Ｋに同情していた私は、それ以後は理否を度外に置いてもＫの味方をする気になりました。,"At the same time, the relationship between him and his adoptive family became more and more entangled. Having run out of time, he was deprived of the opportunity to talk to me as before, so I finally didn't listen to the details, but it's getting harder and harder to solve. I knew only that. I also knew that a person got in touch and tried to mediate. The person urged K to return to Japan by letter, but he refused, saying that K was completely useless. This stubbornness is that-K said that it can't be helped because he can't go home during the school year, but from the other side, it's stubborn. It also seemed to make things worse. He became offended by his adoptive family and also began to buy the anger of his parents' home. When I was worried and wrote a letter to reconcile the two, it had no effect anymore. My letter was buried without even a single reply. I was angry too. I had been sympathetic to K because of my sympathy for going on, but after that, I became motivated to be on K's side even if I made a mistake.","Meanwhile his relations with his adoptive family were growing increasingly difficult. His lack of time meant that he no longer had a chance to talk with me as he used to, so I never learned the details, but I was aware that more and more stood in the way of a resolution. I also knew that someone had stepped in and attempted to mediate. This person wrote to K encouraging him to return, but he refused, having made up his mind that it was absolutely out of the question. This obstinacy—or so it would have struck the other party, although he claimed that it was impossible for him to leave during the school term—seemed to exacerbate the situation. Not only was K hurting the feelings of his adoptive family, he was fueling the ire of his real family as well. Worried, I wrote a letter that attempted to soothe the situation, but it was too late by now for it to have any effect. My letter sank without a word of response. I too grew angry. The situation had always encouraged my sympathy with K, but now I was inclined to take his side regardless of the rights and wrongs of the matter.","About this time, relations between him and his adopted family grew steadily worse and more complicated. As K had now no time to spare, we had little opportunity to talk as we had done before, and I did not hear all the particulars; but I knew how much more difficult of solution the whole problem had become. I knew also that one person had tried to act as mediator between the two parties. This person had actually tried by letter to persuade K to come home. But K refused, saying that it was absolutely impossible. This stubbornness on his part—or so it seemed to the people at home, though K had pointed out to them that he could not leave Tokyo during term-time— made the situation worse; not only did he hurt his foster parents’ feelings, but he angered his original family as well. In my anxiety, I wrote a conciliatory letter to soothe their feelings, but it seemed to have no effect whatsoever. My letter, it seems, did not merit even a word in reply. I also became angry. Circumstances had so far made me sympathize with K; but now I was determined to stand by K, whether he was right or wrong."
なるほど迷惑という様子は、先生のどこにも見えなかった。私は先生の交際の範囲の極きわめて狭い事を知っていた。先生の元の同級生などで、その頃ころ東京にいるものはほとんど二人か三人しかないという事も知っていた。先生と同郷の学生などには時たま座敷で同座する場合もあったが、彼らのいずれもは皆みんな私ほど先生に親しみをもっていないように見受けられた。,"I couldn't see any annoyance anywhere in the teacher. I knew that the range of dating of the teacher was extremely narrow. I also knew that there were only two or three of my teacher's former classmates in Tokyo at that time. Occasionally, I would sit in a tatami room with my teacher and students in my hometown, but none of them seemed to be as familiar to me as I was.","Indeed my visits didn’t seem to annoy him. I was aware that he had a very narrow range of social contacts. He had also mentioned that only two or three of his old school friends were living in Tokyo. Occasionally, a fellow student from his hometown would be there when I called, but none of them seemed to me as close to him as I.","Indeed, he never seemed to regard me as a nuisance. I was aware that the number of his acquaintances was rather limited. As for those who had been in the same class with him at the university, I knew there were no more than two or three in Tokyo. Sometimes, I would find at his house students who were from the same part of the country as Sensei, but it seemed to me that none of them were as close to him as I was."
「私は縁談の事をそれなり忘れてしまいました。私の周囲ぐるりを取り捲まいている青年の顔を見ると、世帯染しょたいじみたものは一人もいません。みんな自由です、そうして悉ことごとく単独らしく思われたのです。こういう気楽な人の中うちにも、裏面にはいり込んだら、あるいは家庭の事情に余儀なくされて、すでに妻を迎えていたものがあったかも知れませんが、子供らしい私はそこに気が付きませんでした。それからそういう特別の境遇に置かれた人の方でも、四辺あたりに気兼きがねをして、なるべくは書生に縁の遠いそんな内輪の話はしないように慎んでいたのでしょう。後あとから考えると、私自身がすでにその組だったのですが、私はそれさえ分らずに、ただ子供らしく愉快に修学の道を歩いて行きました。,"""I have forgotten about the marriage to some extent. Looking at the faces of the young men around me, there is no one who is sick of household dyeing. Everyone is free, and so on. Everything seemed to be alone. Some of these easy-going people may have already had their wives if they got into the back side or were forced by family circumstances. As a child, I didn't notice it. And even those who are in such a special situation don't talk about the inner circle, which is far from the student, as much as possible, even if they are in such a special situation. When I think about it later, I was already in that group, but I didn't even know it, and I just walked the path of study happily like a child.","I forgot all about this talk of marriage. None of the young fellows around me, after all, had the air of responsible householders—all seemed their own men, individual and free of constraints. If I had penetrated below the apparent happiness, I might have found some whom family circumstance had already forced to marry, but I was too young and innocent to be aware of such things then. Besides, anyone who found himself in that kind of situation would have kept it to himself as far as possible, considering it private and quite irrelevant to a student’s life. I now realize that I was already in this category myself, but in my innocence I continued to pursue my studies contentedly.","I forgot all about the subject of marriage. None of the young men in my group seemed to me to have that domesticated look. They all seemed to do as they liked, and, as far as I could tell, were all bachelors. It is possible that if one had examined their personal histories carefully, one might have discovered that despite their easygoing ways, some of them had already been forced into marriage; but I was too young to even suspect such a thing. Besides, even if there had been such men in our midst, it is doubtful that they would have wanted to talk about marriage, a subject far removed from the thoughts of young students. To think of it, I was myself in this position; but I was not worried, and managed to spend another year happily at the college."
私は黙って茶を飲んだ。飲んでしまっても黙っていた。,"I drank tea silently. Even if I drank it, I was silent.","I sipped my tea in silence, and remained mute once the tea was drunk.",I drank tea silently. I remained silent even when I had finished the cup.
「何でといって、そんな特別な意味はありません。――しかしお邪魔じゃまなんですか」,"""That doesn't mean anything special.-But it's a hindrance?""","“Well, no particular reason, really. Am I a nuisance, Sensei?”","“Why? I don’t think there’s any particular reason . . . Am I a nuisance, sir?”"
五十,Fifty,CHAPTER 104,"Despite her gentleness, however, I could see unmistakable signs of fear and shock in her eyes."
父は陛下のことを、つねに天子さまといっていた。,My father always referred to His Majesty as Tenshi-sama.,More details on His Majesty’s condition.” This was how he always referred to the emperor.,He always referred to the Emperor as “His Majesty.”
先生のこの問いは全く突然であった。しかも先生は私がこの問いに対して答えられないという事もよく承知していた。私はしばらく返事をしなかった。すると先生は始めて気が付いたようにこういった。,"The teacher's question was quite sudden. Moreover, the teacher was well aware that I could not answer this question. I didn't reply for a while. Then, as the teacher noticed for the first time, he said this.","Sensei’s question came out of the blue. He knew perfectly well, what’s more, that I did not. I made no reply. There was a pause, then something seemed to dawn on him.","Sensei’s question was totally unexpected. He should, of course, have known that I did not know. I remained silent. Then, as though realizing what he had just said, Sensei went on:"
「そう思い切りよく考えれば、それまでですけれども」,"""If you think so, it's up to that point.""","“If you can approach it so matter-of-factly, no more need be said, I suppose,” she replied, and looked down, subdued.","“If you can truly be so resigned about it,” she said quietly, “then there’s nothing more to be said.”"
「Ｋはなかなか奥さんとお嬢さんの話を已やめませんでした。しまいには私わたくしも答えられないような立ち入った事まで聞くのです。私は面倒よりも不思議の感に打たれました。以前私の方から二人を問題にして話しかけた時の彼を思い出すと、私はどうしても彼の調子の変っているところに気が付かずにはいられないのです。私はとうとうなぜ今日に限ってそんな事ばかりいうのかと彼に尋ねました。その時彼は突然黙りました。しかし私は彼の結んだ口元の肉が顫ふるえるように動いているのを注視しました。彼は元来無口な男でした。平生へいぜいから何かいおうとすると、いう前によく口のあたりをもぐもぐさせる癖くせがありました。彼の唇がわざと彼の意志に反抗するように容易たやすく開あかないところに、彼の言葉の重みも籠こもっていたのでしょう。一旦いったん声が口を破って出るとなると、その声には普通の人よりも倍の強い力がありました。,"""K didn't stop talking about his wife and daughter. In the end, I heard that I couldn't answer. I was more wondered than troublesome. Previously. When I remember him when I talked to them about the problem, I can't help but notice that he's out of tune. I'm finally wondering why only today. I asked him if he was just saying, then he suddenly shut up, but I watched the flesh of his tied mouth swaying. He was originally a reticent man. I had a habit of muffled my mouth before I tried to do anything to Hirao. Where his lips didn't open easily and easily to rebel against his will. Perhaps the weight of his words was also trapped. Once the voice broke through his mouth, it was twice as powerful as a normal person.","K persisted with his questions about Okusan and Ojōsan. Eventually he began to ask the kind of personal question that I had no way of answering. I was not so much annoyed as astonished. There was a glaring contrast between his indifference whenever I had brought up the subject of these two on previous occasions, and his very different attitude now. Finally I asked why he was suddenly so obsessed with the subject today. He instantly fell silent, but his closed mouth twitched tremulously. He never spoke much, and when he did, he had the habit of first working his mouth around. The weight of his utterances was no doubt evidenced in the way the lips resisted his will and opened only reluctantly. The voice that finally broke through was twice as strong as that of an average man.","K continued to question me about Okusan and Ojosan. Eventually, I found myself unable to answer his questions, which became increasingly complicated and personal. I thought his behavior not so much irritating as odd. Previously, it had always been I that had tried to introduce the subject of the two ladies into our conversation. I could not but take notice, therefore, of the sudden interest that K was showing in them. I asked him finally, “Why is it that today, in particular, you are asking me all these questions?” He became suddenly very quiet. I saw that his mouth was trembling. K was normally a man of few words. He also had the habit of opening and shutting his lips like a stutterer before he said anything, as though they were not altogether under the control of his will. Perhaps this difficulty was partly responsible for the impression of weightiness that his words conveyed to the listener. His voice, when it broke through the barrier, was twice as strong as that of the average man."
「議論はいやよ。よく男の方は議論だけなさるのね、面白そうに。空からの盃さかずきでよくああ飽きずに献酬けんしゅうができると思いますわ」,"""I don't want to argue. Often men only argue, it looks interesting. I think you can make a donation without getting tired of it with a cup from the sky.""","“I don’t like argumentation. You men do it a lot, don’t you? You seem to enjoy it.","“Let us not argue. You men certainly will argue about anything, and with such obvious pleasure too. I have often wondered how it is that you men can, without becoming bored, forever exchange empty saké cups with one another.”"
私はこういう覚悟をもっている先生に対して、いうべき言葉を知らなかった。,I didn't know what to say to a teacher who was prepared to do this.,"Sensei’s mind was made up, I could see, and I found no words to answer his conviction.",I could not think of anything to say.
「お母さんがここを動くか動かないかがすでに大きな疑問ですよ」,"""It's already a big question whether mom moves here or not.""",“The first big question is whether she’d be willing to leave here or not.”,"“That’s the problem,” I said. “Will she ever agree to leave this house?”"
「また九月に」と先生がいった。,"""See you in September,"" said the teacher.","“See you in September,” said Sensei.","“Till September, then,” he said."
父はこういって、私を諷ふうした。父の考えでは、役に立つものは世の中へ出てみんな相当の地位を得て働いている。必竟ひっきょうやくざだから遊んでいるのだと結論しているらしかった。,"My dad said this and shook me. In my father's opinion, useful things go out into the world and everyone is working with a considerable position. He seemed to conclude that he was playing because he was a gangster.","My father was gently taunting me. To his way of thinking, useful people must be out in the world, engaged in something suitably impressive. There you are, he was insinuating, the fellow’s worthless, that’s why he’s lazing about doing nothing.","What he really meant to say, it seemed to me, was that any man worth his salt would find some useful occupation, and that only a ne’er-do-well would be content to live in idleness. “True, I don’t earn a regular salary,” my father continued. “But you must admit that even a simple fellow like me finds something to do."
授業が始まって、一カ月ばかりすると私の心に、また一種の弛たるみができてきた。私は何だか不足な顔をして往来を歩き始めた。物欲しそうに自分の室へやの中を見廻みまわした。私の頭には再び先生の顔が浮いて出た。私はまた先生に会いたくなった。,"About a month after the class started, I felt a kind of slack in my heart. I started walking in and out with a somewhat lacking face. I looked around in my room in a greedy manner. The teacher's face came to my mind again. I wanted to see my teacher again.","Classes started, and a month or so later I slumped back into normalcy. I wandered the streets in vague discontentment, or cast my eyes around my room, aware of some indefinable lack. The thought of Sensei came into my mind once more. I wanted to see him again, I realized.","A month or so after the start of lectures, I became more relaxed. At the same time, I began to walk about the streets discontentedly, and to look around my room with a feeling that something was lacking in my life. I began to think of Sensei, and I found that I wanted to see him again."
「あの時はいよいよ頭が変になったのかと思って、ひやりとした」と後で兄が私にいった。「私わたしも実は驚きました」と妹の夫も同感らしい言葉つきであった。,"""I was chilling at that time, thinking that I was finally crazy,"" my brother later told me. ""I was actually surprised,"" said her sister's husband.","“I really thought he’d turned a bit odd,” my brother said later to me. “It sent a cold shiver down my spine.” My sister’s husband agreed that he’d been alarmed as well.","“I really did think he had finally gone mad,” said my brother later. “I must say I was surprised too,” agreed my brother-in-law."
「やっぱり駄目ですかね。でも当分は持ち合ってるんでしょう。何ともいって来ませんよ」,"""Isn't it useless? But I think I have it for the time being. I won't say anything.""","“Yes, I guess he won’t really recover. But he’ll stay as he is for a while yet, I think. There’s been no word about it.”","“I don’t suppose there is much hope for him, is there? I do believe however, that he will stay as well as he is for a while yet. At any rate, I have so far received no bad news.”"
「なにね、自分で死ぬ死ぬっていう人に死んだ試ためしはないんだから安心だよ。お父さんなんぞも、死ぬ死ぬっていいながら、これから先まだ何年生きなさるか分るまいよ。それよりか黙ってる丈夫の人の方が剣呑けんのんさ」,"""Well, I'm relieved that there's no dead trial for someone who dies on their own. I don't know how many years the dad will live, even though he's dying. Rather than that, a strong person who is silent is a swordsman. ""","“But there you are,” she continued. “People can carry on about dying and never show any sign of actually doing it, you know. That’s how your father is; he’ll talk of death like this, but who knows how long he’ll go on living? So don’t worry. There’s actually more cause to worry with someone who seems healthy and never talks like that.”","When did anyone die who kept on saying that he was going to die? Despite the fact that your father says he expects to die soon, he will probably be living many years from now. Rather, it is we, who are so certain of our good health, that are in real danger.”"
この問答は私にとってすこぶる不得要領ふとくようりょうのものであったが、私はその時底そこまで押さずに帰ってしまった。しかもそれから四日と経たたないうちにまた先生を訪問した。先生は座敷へ出るや否いなや笑い出した。,"This question and answer was a very bad idea for me, but I went home without pushing it to the bottom at that time. Moreover, less than four days later, I visited the teacher again. The teacher started laughing as soon as he went to the tatami room.","I could make no sense of this exchange and went home that day puzzled. Four days later, however, I was back at his house again. He burst out laughing as soon as he emerged and saw me.","The conversation seemed to me to be rather purposeless. Without pursuing it any further, I left. Four days later, I was back again at his house. As soon as Sensei appeared, he began to laugh."
「どんなだったんですか」,"""What was it like?""",“So what was he like?”,“Then what was he like?”
「え、きっと先よ」,"""Well, I'm sure it's ahead.""",“Definitely.”,"“Yes, of course.”"
九月始めになって、私わたくしはいよいよまた東京へ出ようとした。私は父に向かって当分今まで通り学資を送ってくれるようにと頼んだ。,"At the beginning of September, I finally tried to go to Tokyo again. I asked my dad to send me the money as usual for the time being.","When September arrived, I was impatient to return to Tokyo. I asked my father if he would continue to send money for a while, as he had for my studies.","Finally, at the beginning of September, I decided to go to Tokyo. I asked my father if he would continue sending me the allowance that I had received when I was at the university."
「そりゃ私から見れば分っています。（先生はそう思っていないかも知れませんが）。先生は私を離れれば不幸になるだけです。あるいは生きていられないかも知れませんよ。そういうと、己惚おのぼれになるようですが、私は今先生を人間としてできるだけ幸福にしているんだと信じていますわ。どんな人があっても私ほど先生を幸福にできるものはないとまで思い込んでいますわ。それだからこうして落ち付いていられるんです」,"""That's what I know. (The teacher may not think so). The teacher will only be unhappy if he leaves me, or he may not be able to live. It seems like I'm in love with myself, but I believe that I'm making my teacher as happy as possible now. I'm convinced that no one can make him as happy as I am. That's why I can calm down like this. ""","“I know the answer from my own point of view, though I’m not sure whether he would see it the same way. Put simply, if Sensei and I were separated, he’d be miserable. He might well be unable to go on living. This sounds conceited of me, I know, but I do my best to make him happy. I even dare to believe no one else could make him as happy as I can. This belief comforts me.”","“Actually, I know the answer. (Though Sensei might not think that I do.) Sensei would be far more unhappy without me. Why, he might not even want to go on living, without me. It may seem very conceited of me, but I do really believe that I am able to make him as happy as is humanly possible. I believe that no one else would be able to make him as happy as I can. Without this belief, I would not be as contented as I am.”"
「きっとお頼たのもうしておいた口の事だよ」と母が推断してくれた。,"""I'm sure it's the mouth I've asked for,"" my mother insisted.","“It’s bound to be about a position he’s found for you,” declared my mother, leaping to conclusions.","My mother offered an explanation. “I am sure he wants to see you about a job,” she said."
兄はこんな事をいいながら父と話をした。その賑にぎやか過ぎる調子が私にはかえって不調和に聞こえた。それでも父の前を外はずして私と差し向いになった時は、むしろ沈んでいた。,"My brother talked to his father while saying this. The overly lively tone sounded dissonant to me. Even so, when I took off my father and faced me, I was rather sunk.","His boisterous high spirits struck me as rather out of keeping with the situation. When he left my father’s side and came to talk to me, however, he was much more somber.","My brother seemed to me too cheerful, and his bright tone a little out of place. But later, when he had left my father and was alone with me, he seemed more depressed."
二十六,Twenty-six,CHAPTER 80,"Although K and I were students in the same faculty, we studied different subjects."
「本を読むだけなら、田舎いなかでも充分できるし、それに働く必要もなくなるし、ちょうど好いいだろう」,"""If you just read a book, you can do it well in the countryside, you don't have to work for it, and it's just right.""","“You can do all the reading you like in the country, and you wouldn’t have to work. It’d suit you down to the ground.”","“If all you want to do is read books, then you can do that well enough here. Besides, you won’t have to do any work. I should think the life would suit you very well.”"
「君もいよいよ卒業したが、これから何をする気ですか」と先生が聞いた。先生は半分縁側の方へ席をずらして、敷居際しきいぎわで背中を障子しょうじに靠もたせていた。,"""You have finally graduated, but what are you going to do now?"" Asked the teacher. The teacher shifted his seat halfway toward the porch, and he had his back rested on the shoji screen at the threshold.","“So now that you’ve graduated,” said Sensei, “what do you plan to do next?” He had half-turned his cushion toward the garden and was leaning back against the sliding doors at the edge of the veranda.","“Now that you have finally graduated, what do you intend to do?” Sensei asked. He had moved his cushion towards the verandah, and was leaning against the sliding door."
それから二、三日経たった後のちの事でしたろう、奥さんとお嬢さんは朝から市ヶ谷にいる親類の所へ行くといって宅うちを出ました。Ｋも私もまだ学校の始まらない頃ころでしたから、留守居同様あとに残っていました。私は書物を読むのも散歩に出るのも厭いやだったので、ただ漠然と火鉢の縁ふちに肱ひじを載せて凝じっと顋あごを支えたなり考えていました。隣となりの室へやにいるＫも一向いっこう音を立てませんでした。双方ともいるのだかいないのだか分らないくらい静かでした。もっともこういう事は、二人の間柄として別に珍しくも何ともなかったのですから、私は別段それを気にも留めませんでした。,"A few days later, my wife and daughter left home saying that they would go to their relatives in Ichigaya from the morning. Both K and I were around the time when school hadn't started yet, so they remained after the same as when I was away. I was reluctant to read books or go out for a walk, so I just vaguely thought that I would put my elbows on the edge of the brazier and firmly support my chin. K, who was in the next room, didn't make any noise. It was so quiet that I couldn't tell if both were there or not. However, this was not unusual for the relationship between the two, so I didn't even notice it.","It would have been two or three days later that Okusan and Ojōsan set off in the morning to visit some relatives in Ichigaya. Classes had not yet started, so K and I were in effect left to look after the house for the day. I felt no urge either to read or to take a walk and instead settled beside the brazier, chin propped on elbow, daydreaming. Next door K was equally quiet. Such silence reigned that for each of us, the other could as well not have been there. There was nothing unusual in this silence, of course, and I paid it no particular attention.","It was, I think, two or three days later that Okusan and Ojosan left the house early in the morning, saying that they were going to visit a relative of theirs in Ichigaya. K and I remained in the house, since we were still on holiday. I had no inclination to go outside. I sat down by the brazier, and resting my elbows on it, began to think in a vague and disconnected way. K, who was in his room, was also very quiet. Neither of us gave the other any indication that he was still in the house. The silence did not worry me, however: both K and I were accustomed to it."
二人はまた奥の方へ進んだ。しかしそこにも人影は見えなかった。躑躅つつじが燃えるように咲き乱れていた。先生はそのうちで樺色かばいろの丈たけの高いのを指して、「これは霧島きりしまでしょう」といった。,"The two went to the back again. However, I couldn't see a figure there either. The azaleas were in full bloom like burning. The teacher pointed to the tall birch-colored sword and said, ""This is Kirishima Kirishima.""","On through the garden we went, still seeing no sign of anyone. Azaleas bloomed all around us like flames. Sensei pointed to a tall bush of orange azaleas. “This one would be the sort they call kirishima.”","We walked on, and still we came across no one. All about us azaleas flamed in all their splendor. Sensei pointed to an azalea which grew taller than the others and was reddish-yellow in color. “That is what we call ‘Kirishima,’4 I think,” he said."
「私が家へはいると間もなく俥くるまの音が聞こえました。今のように護謨輪ゴムわのない時分でしたから、がらがらいう厭いやな響ひびきがかなりの距離でも耳に立つのです。車はやがて門前で留まりました。,"""Soon after I entered the house, I heard the sound of a rickshaw. It was a time when there was no rubber band like now, so I could hear the rattle and the unpleasant sound even at a considerable distance. The car eventually stayed in front of the gate.","Soon after I returned, I heard a rickshaw approaching. In those days the wheels were not yet lined with rubber, and you could hear the noisy clatter from quite a distance. The vehicle eventually pulled up in front of the gate.","Soon afterwards, I heard the wheels of rickshaws approaching the house. In those days, rickshaw wheels did not have rubber tires as they do now. They were therefore unpleasantly noisy, and one could hear them from quite a distance. A moment or two later, the rickshaws stopped in front of the house."
時たまお嬢さん一人で、用があって私の室へはいったついでに、そこに坐すわって話し込むような場合もその内うちに出て来ました。そういう時には、私の心が妙に不安に冒おかされて来るのです。そうして若い女とただ差向さしむかいで坐っているのが不安なのだとばかりは思えませんでした。私は何だかそわそわし出すのです。自分で自分を裏切るような不自然な態度が私を苦しめるのです。しかし相手の方はかえって平気でした。これが琴を浚さらうのに声さえ碌ろくに出せなかった［＃「出せなかった」は底本では「出せなかったの」］あの女かしらと疑われるくらい、恥ずかしがらないのです。あまり長くなるので、茶の間から母に呼ばれても、「はい」と返事をするだけで、容易に腰を上げない事さえありました。それでいてお嬢さんは決して子供ではなかったのです。私の眼にはよくそれが解わかっていました。よく解るように振舞って見せる痕迹こんせきさえ明らかでした。,"Occasionally, when I was alone, I went to my room for business, and then I sat there and talked to him. At such times, my heart is strangely anxious. I didn't think I was worried about sitting just facing the young woman. I'm kind of fidgeting. The unnatural attitude of betraying myself afflicts me. However, the other party was rather fine. I couldn't even make a loud voice even though this was a koto kidnapped [# ""I couldn't make it"" was ""I couldn't make it"" in the bottom line] I'm not ashamed to suspect that she was that woman. It's so long that even if my mother called me from the tea room, I just answered ""yes"" and sometimes I couldn't even sit up easily. Yet the young lady was never a child. I knew it well in my eyes. It was even clear that he behaved in a way that was easy to understand.","In time Ojōsan developed the occasional habit of coming to my room on some errand and then settling down to talk. Whenever this happened, a strange uneasiness beset my heart. It wasn’t simply a nervous response to finding myself alone face-to-face with a young woman. Her presence made me oddly fidgety and ill at ease, and this unnatural behavior distressed me as a self-betrayal. She, however, was entirely at her ease. It was difficult to believe that this unabashed girl and the girl who managed to produce only a timid whisper when practicing her koto singing could be the same person. On occasion she stayed so long that her mother called her from the sitting room. “Coming,” she would answer, but she continued to sit there. Yet she was far from a mere child—this much my eyes told me clearly. And I could see too that she was behaving in a way that let me know as much.","Occasionally, when Ojosan came to my room on some errand, she would sit down for a chat. At such times, I felt strangely uneasy. Afterwards, I would try, with little success, to convince myself that my uneasiness was no more than the natural embarrassment of a young man finding himself alone with a young woman. It was not so much embarrassment as a feeling of restlessness; and the cause of this restlessness was the unnatural feeling that I was somehow being a traitor to my true self. She, on her part, seemed perfectly at ease. She was, in fact, so self-possessed that I would ask myself, “Is this the same girl that is so self-conscious of her voice during her koto lessons?” Sometimes, when she stayed too long, her mother would call her. I remember that on more than one occasion she merely answered, “I’m coming,” and remained where she was. Ojosan was by no means a child, however. This was quite clear to me."
墓地の区切り目に、大きな銀杏いちょうが一本空を隠すように立っていた。その下へ来た時、先生は高い梢こずえを見上げて、「もう少しすると、綺麗きれいですよ。この木がすっかり黄葉こうようして、ここいらの地面は金色きんいろの落葉で埋うずまるようになります」といった。先生は月に一度ずつは必ずこの木の下を通るのであった。,"At the break of the graveyard, a big ginkgo stood to hide a sky. When I came under it, the teacher looked up at the tall treetops and said, ""A little more, it will be beautiful. This tree is completely yellow leaves, and the ground here is filled with golden fall foliage. Masu "". The teacher always passed under this tree once a month.","At the end of the cemetery a great ginkgo tree stood blocking the sky. “It will look lovely before long,” Sensei remarked, looking up at it. “This tree turns a beautiful color in autumn. The ground is buried deep in golden leaves when they fall.” Every month when he came here, I discovered, he made a point of passing under this tree.","Towards the end of the cemetery, there stood a gingko tree, so large that it almost hid the sky from view. Sensei looked up at the tree and said, “In a little while, it will be beautiful here. The tree will be a mass of yellow, and the ground will be buried beneath a golden carpet of fallen leaves.” Every month, I learned, Sensei made a point of walking by the tree at least once."
買物のうちで一番私を困らせたのは女の半襟はんえりであった。小僧にいうと、いくらでも出してはくれるが、さてどれを選んでいいのか、買う段になっては、ただ迷うだけであった。その上価あたいが極きわめて不定であった。安かろうと思って聞くと、非常に高かったり、高かろうと考えて、聞かずにいると、かえって大変安かったりした。あるいはいくら比べて見ても、どこから価格の差違が出るのか見当の付かないのもあった。私は全く弱らせられた。そうして心のうちで、なぜ先生の奥さんを煩わずらわさなかったかを悔いた。,"The most annoying thing about shopping was the woman's half-collar. As a kid, he would give me as much as I wanted, but when it came time to buy, I was just wondering which one to choose. Moreover, the price was extremely uncertain. When I asked if it was cheap, it was very expensive, and when I thought it was expensive and I didn't ask, it was rather cheap. Or, no matter how much I compared it, I had no idea where the price difference would come from. I was totally weakened. Then, in my heart, I regretted why I didn't bother the teacher's wife.","The most troublesome item on the shopping list was some ladies’ kimono collars. The shop assistant produced quite a few of them for me to look at, but when the time came for me to decide which ones to purchase, I could not. Another problem was that the prices seemed quite arbitrary. A collar that looked cheap turned out to be highly expensive, while others that I had passed over as expensive-looking actually cost very little. For the life of me I could not tell what made one more valuable than another. The whole mission defeated me, and I regretted not having troubled Sensei’s wife to come along and help me.","Of the items that I was asked to buy, the one that gave me most trouble was a chemisette. The apprentice at the shop was willing enough to bring out as many as I wished to see, but I found it very difficult to decide which I should buy. Also, prices varied greatly. Those that I thought would be cheap turned out to be very dear, and those that looked expensive to me turned out to be very cheap. Precisely what it was that made one chemisette better than another, I could not understand. I regretted not having asked Sensei’s wife to buy one for me."
同時に私は黙って家うちのものの様子を観察して見ました。しかし奥さんの態度にもお嬢さんの素振そぶりにも、別に平生へいぜいと変った点はありませんでした。Ｋの自白以前と自白以後とで、彼らの挙動にこれという差違が生じないならば、彼の自白は単に私だけに限られた自白で、肝心かんじんの本人にも、またその監督者たる奥さんにも、まだ通じていないのは慥たしかでした。そう考えた時私は少し安心しました。それで無理に機会を拵こしらえて、わざとらしく話を持ち出すよりは、自然の与えてくれるものを取り逃さないようにする方が好かろうと思って、例の問題にはしばらく手を着けずにそっとしておく事にしました。,"At the same time, I silently observed what was happening at home. However, there was nothing different about his wife's attitude or his daughter's pretense. If there is no difference in their behavior between before and after K's confession, his confession is a confession that is limited to me, and his wife, who is the main person, and his supervisor. However, it was a confession that I didn't understand yet. When I thought so, I was a little relieved. So I thought it would be better not to miss the things that nature gives me, rather than forcibly seizing the opportunity and deliberately bringing up the story, so I left the example problem untouched for a while. I decided to leave it.","I was also silently watchful of Okusan and Ojōsan. However, I detected nothing in either of them that was in the least different from usual. If their behavior had not visibly changed since K’s confession, I felt, then he’d clearly confessed himself to me alone. He had yet to broach it with either Ojōsan or her guardian. This thought brought me some small comfort. In that case, I decided, it was better to lie in wait for a moment when I could naturally bring up the subject rather than make it obvious that I was purposely creating one. I would lay the topic aside for the moment and let things be. Put this way, the decision sounds terribly simple.","Quietly, I watched the conduct of the two ladies. It showed no change, and I was satisfied that K had confided in me only : I was certain that neither Ojosan herself nor her strict and observant mother knew K’s secret. I was relieved. With the relief came the conviction that it would be better to wait for an opportunity to present itself naturally and be sure not to miss it, than to approach K impatiently and force him to discuss the affair with me. I may have given you the impression that my reaching the decision to be patient was a simple process. It was nothing of the sort."
私はＫが再び仕切しきりの襖ふすまを開あけて向うから突進してきてくれれば好いいと思いました。私にいわせれば、先刻はまるで不意撃ふいうちに会ったも同じでした。私にはＫに応ずる準備も何もなかったのです。私は午前に失ったものを、今度は取り戻そうという下心したごころを持っていました。それで時々眼を上げて、襖を眺ながめました。しかしその襖はいつまで経たっても開あきません。そうしてＫは永久に静かなのです。,"I thought it would be nice if K could open the fusuma bran that was completely partitioned again and rush towards it. If you ask me, it was the same as when I met him in a surprise attack. I wasn't prepared to respond to K. I had the urge to recover what I lost in the morning. So I raised my eyes from time to time and looked at the fusuma. However, the fusuma will never open. Then K is forever quiet.","If only he would open the sliding doors that separated us and charge into the room again, I thought. Earlier, he had caught me off guard, quite unprepared to cope with him. My underlying impulse now was to somehow regain the advantage I had lost that morning. From time to time I raised my eyes expectantly to the sliding doors. But the doors stayed closed. And beyond them K remained quiet.","I wished that K would once more open the door and stride into my room. That morning, K had taken me by surprise, and I had been totally unprepared. I wanted the same scene repeated, so that this time, I might receive K with the initiative on my side. Time and again I glanced at the door, but it did not open. The silence in K’s room seemed eternal."
父はこの言葉を何遍なんべんも繰り返した。私は心のうちでこの父の喜びと、卒業式のあった晩先生の家うちの食卓で、「お目出とう」といわれた時の先生の顔付かおつきとを比較した。私には口で祝ってくれながら、腹の底でけなしている先生の方が、それほどにもないものを珍しそうに嬉うれしがる父よりも、かえって高尚に見えた。私はしまいに父の無知から出る田舎臭いなかくさいところに不快を感じ出した。,"My father repeated this word all over the place. In my heart, I compared this father's joy with the teacher's face or face when he was told ""Let's meet"" at the table at the teacher's house where the graduation ceremony was held. To me, the teacher, who was celebrating with his mouth and screaming at the bottom of his stomach, seemed more noble than his father, who was so happy to find something that wasn't so rare. I finally felt uncomfortable with the rustic scent of my father's ignorance.","“A fine thing you’ve graduated”—he repeated these words again and again. In my heart, I compared my father’s joy with Sensei’s reaction at the dinner table after the graduation ceremony. He had said “Congratulations,” but his private disdain was evident in his face. Sensei, I thought, was more cultured and admirable than my father, with his unashamed delight. In the final analysis, what I felt was displeasure at the reek of country boorishness in my father’s innocence.","“I am glad that you were able to graduate,” he said repeatedly. Inwardly, I compared my father’s unaffected pleasure with the way Sensei had congratulated me that night at the dinner table. And I had greater admiration for Sensei with his secret contempt for such things as university degrees, than I had for my father, who seemed to me to value them more than they were worth. I began at last to dislike my father’s naïve provincialism."
さっきまで傍そばにいて、あんまりだわとか何とかいって笑ったお嬢さんは、いつの間にか向うの隅に行って、背中をこっちへ向けていました。私は立とうとして振り返った時、その後姿うしろすがたを見たのです。後姿だけで人間の心が読めるはずはありません。お嬢さんがこの問題についてどう考えているか、私には見当が付きませんでした。お嬢さんは戸棚を前にして坐すわっていました。その戸棚の一尺しゃくばかり開あいている隙間すきまから、お嬢さんは何か引き出して膝ひざの上へ置いて眺ながめているらしかったのです。私の眼はその隙間の端はじに、一昨日おととい買った反物たんものを見付け出しました。私の着物もお嬢さんのも同じ戸棚の隅に重ねてあったのです。,"The young lady, who had been by her side until a while ago and laughed so much, went to the other corner and turned her back to this side. When I turned around to stand up, I saw him behind him. The human mind cannot be read only by the rear view. I had no idea what the young lady was thinking about this issue. The young lady was sitting in front of the cupboard. It seemed that the young lady pulled out something and put it on her lap and looked at it from the gap that was just open in the cupboard. At the end of the gap, my eyes found the tanmono that I bought the day before yesterday. Both my kimono and my daughter were piled up in the corner of the same cupboard.","Ojōsan, who had been sitting with us laughing and protesting at my tale, by this time had retreated to a corner with her back turned. As I stood to leave, I turned and saw her there. It is impossible to read the heart of someone who is looking away, and I couldn’t guess what she might have been thinking as she listened. She was sitting beside the half-open closet and had taken something from it and laid it on her lap. She now appeared to be gazing intently down at it. In a corner of the open closet, I caught sight of the fabric I had bought her two days before. My own new robe, I saw, lay folded there with hers.","I was not aware that she had moved until I was about to get up and go. I saw her back when I turned around to look at her. It was of course impossible to read her thoughts without seeing her face. I could not even begin to guess how she felt about marriage. She sat near the closet. The door was open, and I decided that she had taken something out of it, placed it on her lap, and was looking at it. Through the open door of the closet, I caught a glimpse of the pieces of cloth that I had bought two days before. The cloth that I had bought for her, and the cloth that I had bought for myself, were lying one on top of the other."
私の宿は人出入ひとでいりの少ない家うちでした。親類も多くはないようでした。お嬢さんの学校友達がときたま遊びに来る事はありましたが、極きわめて小さな声で、いるのだかいないのだか分らないような話をして帰ってしまうのが常でした。それが私に対する遠慮からだとは、いかな私にも気が付きませんでした。私の所へ訪ねて来るものは、大した乱暴者でもありませんでしたけれども、宅うちの人に気兼きがねをするほどな男は一人もなかったのですから。そんなところになると、下宿人の私は主人あるじのようなもので、肝心かんじんのお嬢さんがかえって食客いそうろうの位地いちにいたと同じ事です。,"My inn was a house with few people coming and going. There didn't seem to be many relatives either. My daughter's school friends sometimes came to visit me, but I used to go home with a very quiet voice, telling me whether I was there or not. I didn't realize that it was because of my reluctance. The one who came to me wasn't a big violent man, but no man was enough to care for the people at home. When it comes to such a place, I'm a boarder, and I'm like my husband, and it's the same as when the important young lady was in the place where the eaters seemed to be.","Not many visitors came to the house. The family seemed to have few relatives. Once in a while Ojōsan’s friends stopped by, but generally they would spend the time talking in such low voices that one could scarcely tell they were in the house. For all my heightened sensitivity, I did not realize that they spoke quietly out of deference to my presence. My own friends who came calling, though hardly rowdy, were not inclined to feel constrained by the presence of others. Thus, where guests were concerned, our roles were essentially reversed—I seemed the master of the house, while Ojōsan behaved like a timorous guest.","There were not many visitors to the house. Okusan seemed to have a few relatives. Ojosan’s school friends visited her occasionally, but they were so quiet that one could hardly tell that they were in the house. They were being quiet for my sake; but I did not know this. My own friends who came to the house were none of them rowdy fellows, but they were not so demure as to start whispering for the sake of other people’s comfort. At such times, I seemed to enjoy all the rights due to the owner of the house, while Ojosan’s position was hardly better than that of an unwanted guest."
「丈夫ですとも。何にも持病はありません」,"""I'm strong. I don't have any chronic illness.""","“He’s fine, yes. There’s nothing the matter with him.”",“Certainly. He is perfectly well.”
父の様子は少しくつろいで来た。三十分ほど枕元まくらもとに坐すわっていた医者は、浣腸かんちょうの結果を認めた上、また来るといって、帰って行った。帰り際ぎわに、もしもの事があったらいつでも呼んでくれるようにわざわざ断っていた。,"My father's appearance was a little relaxing. The doctor, who was sitting at the bedside pillow for about 30 minutes, acknowledged the result of the enema and said he would come again and went home. On my way home, I refused to call me whenever something happened.","My father began to look a little more comfortable. The doctor stayed with him for about half an hour and checked the results of the enema, then left, saying he’d be back. As he was on his way out, he made a point of telling us we should call him at any time if something untoward occurred.","My father’s condition seemed to improve a little. The doctor remained for another half-hour or so, then satisfied as to the results of the enema, he stood up to go. He was careful to tell us before leaving that if anything did happen, we should not hesitate to call him."
その西洋人の優れて白い皮膚の色が、掛茶屋へ入るや否いなや、すぐ私の注意を惹ひいた。純粋の日本の浴衣ゆかたを着ていた彼は、それを床几しょうぎの上にすぽりと放ほうり出したまま、腕組みをして海の方を向いて立っていた。彼は我々の穿はく猿股さるまた一つの外ほか何物も肌に着けていなかった。私にはそれが第一不思議だった。私はその二日前に由井ゆいが浜はままで行って、砂の上にしゃがみながら、長い間西洋人の海へ入る様子を眺ながめていた。私の尻しりをおろした所は少し小高い丘の上で、そのすぐ傍わきがホテルの裏口になっていたので、私の凝じっとしている間あいだに、大分だいぶ多くの男が塩を浴びに出て来たが、いずれも胴と腕と股ももは出していなかった。女は殊更ことさら肉を隠しがちであった。大抵は頭に護謨製ゴムせいの頭巾ずきんを被かぶって、海老茶えびちゃや紺こんや藍あいの色を波間に浮かしていた。そういう有様を目撃したばかりの私の眼めには、猿股一つで済まして皆みんなの前に立っているこの西洋人がいかにも珍しく見えた。,"The excellent white skin color of the Westerner immediately caught my attention as soon as he entered the Kakechaya. Wearing a pure Japanese yukata, he stood facing the sea with his arms folded, with it thrown out on the floor. He wasn't wearing anything but one of our sarumatas. That was my first wonder to me. Two days before that, Yui Yui went to the beach and crouched down on the sand, watching the Westerners enter the sea for a long time. The place where I lowered my ass was on a small hill, and the back door of the hotel was right next to it, so while I was stiff, a lot of men were bathed in salt. They came out, but none of them had their torso, arms, and crotch. The woman was especially apt to hide the meat. Most of the time, I wore a hood made of rubber on my head, and the colors of shrimp brown shrimp, dark blue, and indigo were floating in the waves. To my eyes, who had just witnessed such a situation, this Westerner who was standing in front of everyone with only one sarumata looked very rare.","The Westerner’s marvelously white skin had struck me as soon as I came in. He had casually tossed his kimono robe onto the nearby bench and then, clad only in a pair of drawers such as we Japanese wear, stood gazing out toward the sea, arms folded. This intrigued me. Two days earlier I had gone up to Yuigahama beach and spent a long time watching the Westerners bathing. I had settled myself on a low dune very close to the rear entrance of a hotel frequented by foreigners, and seen a number of men emerge to bathe. Unlike this Westerner, however, they all wore clothing that covered their torso, arms, and legs. The women were even more modest. Most wore red or blue rubber caps that bobbed prettily about among the waves. Because I had so recently observed all that, the sight of this Westerner standing there in front of everyone wearing only a pair of trunks struck me as quite remarkable.","The Westerner, with his extremely pale skin, had already attracted my attention when I approached the tea house. He was standing with folded arms, facing the sea: carelessly thrown down on the stool by his side was a Japanese summer dress which he had been wearing. He had on him only a pair of drawers such as we were accustomed to wear. I found this particularly strange. Two days previously I had gone to Yuigahama, and sitting on top of a small dune close to the rear entrance of a Western-style hotel, I had whiled away the time watching the Westerners bathe. All of them had their torsos, arms, and thighs well-covered. The women especially seemed overly modest. Most of them were wearing brightly colored rubber caps which could be seen bobbing conspicuously amongst the waves. After having observed such a scene, it was natural that I should think this Westerner, who stood so lightly clad in our midst, quite extraordinary."
「勘定して見ると奥さんがＫに話をしてからもう二日余りになります。その間Ｋは私に対して少しも以前と異なった様子を見せなかったので、私は全くそれに気が付かずにいたのです。彼の超然とした態度はたとい外観だけにもせよ、敬服に値あたいすべきだと私は考えました。彼と私を頭の中で並べてみると、彼の方が遥はるかに立派に見えました。「おれは策略で勝っても人間としては負けたのだ」という感じが私の胸に渦巻いて起りました。私はその時さぞＫが軽蔑けいべつしている事だろうと思って、一人で顔を赧あからめました。しかし今更Ｋの前に出て、恥を搔かかせられるのは、私の自尊心にとって大いな苦痛でした。,"""It's been more than two days since my wife talked to K when I counted it. During that time, K didn't look any different to me, so I didn't notice it at all. I thought his absurd attitude should be worthy of admiration, even if it was just an appearance. When I put him and me side by side in my head, he was far better. The feeling that ""I won by tricks but lost as a human being"" swirled around my chest. At that time, I thought that K was looking down on me, so I looked up on my face alone. However, it was a great pain for my self-esteem to be in front of K and to be ashamed.","I realized that two days or more had passed since Okusan had told K about our engagement. Nothing in K’s manner toward me had hinted that he knew anything, so I had remained unaware of it. I was now filled with respect for his composure, even though it was no doubt only superficial. By any standard, he was by far the better man. Though I’ve won through cunning, the real victory is his was the thought that spun in my head. How he must despise me! I said to myself, and I blushed with shame. Yet it mortified me to imagine going to K after all this and submitting to the inevitable humiliation.","K, then, had known about it for over two days, though one would never have guessed this from his manner. I could not but admire his calm, however superficial it may have been. It seemed to me that he was much the worthier of the two of us. I said to myself: “Through cunning, I have won. But as a man, I have lost.” My sense of defeat then became so violent that it seemed to spin around in my head like a whirlpool. And when I imagined how contemptuous K must be of me, I blushed with shame. I wanted to go to K and apologize for what I had done, but my pride—my fear of humiliation—restrained me."
「なに大丈夫、これでいつものように要心ようじんさえしていれば」,"""What's okay, as long as you're doing what you need to do as usual?""",All I have to do is take the usual care.”,“Don’t you worry. I shall be all right so long as I look after myself as I always have done.”
私はすぐ厭いやになりました。しかしＫは好いいとも悪いともいいません。少なくとも顔付かおつきだけは平気なものでした。そのくせ彼は海へ入るたんびにどこかに怪我けがをしない事はなかったのです。私はとうとう彼を説き伏せて、そこから富浦とみうらに行きました。富浦からまた那古なこに移りました。すべてこの沿岸はその時分から重おもに学生の集まる所でしたから、どこでも我々にはちょうど手頃てごろの海水浴場だったのです。Ｋと私はよく海岸の岩の上に坐すわって、遠い海の色や、近い水の底を眺ながめました。岩の上から見下みおろす水は、また特別に綺麗きれいなものでした。赤い色だの藍あいの色だの、普通市場しじょうに上のぼらないような色をした小魚こうおが、透き通る波の中をあちらこちらと泳いでいるのが鮮やかに指さされました。,"I soon became reluctant. But K is neither good nor bad. At least the face and the face were fine. However, he never got hurt somewhere when he entered the sea. I finally persuaded him and went to Tomiura and Miura from there. I moved from Tomiura to Nago Nako again. Everything on this coast has been a heavy gathering place for students since that time, so everywhere it was just an affordable beach for us. K and I often sat on the rocks of the coast, looking at the colors of the distant sea and the bottom of the near water. The water looking down from the top of the rock was also exceptionally clean. It was vividly pointed out that the small fish Koo, which was red and indigo, and had a color that did not rise above the ordinary market, was swimming here and there in the clear waves.","I soon had enough of the place. K, however, said not a word either for or against it. Judging from his expression at least, he seemed quite unperturbed, although he never emerged from a swim without a bruise or a cut. I finally persuaded him to leave Hota and move on to Tomiura. From there we went to Nako. All that part of the coast was a popular vacation place for students in those days, and we found beaches to our liking wherever we went. K and I often sat on a rock gazing out at the sea’s colors, or at the underwater world at our feet. The water below us was beautifully crystal clear. In the transparent waves we could point out to each other the brilliant flashes of little fish, whose vivid reds and blues were more spectacular than anything to be seen in the fish markets.","I soon tired of the place. But K showed neither approval nor disapproval. Despite the fact that he never came out of the sea unwounded, he seemed, at least outwardly, quite indifferent to his surroundings. Finally, I managed to convince him of the unpleasantness of Hota, and we left for Tomiura. From there, we went to Nako. That part of the coast was by then very popular with students, and we found no difficulty in finding suitable places for bathing. K and I often sat on the rocks near the shore, and watched the sea stretching far beyond towards the horizon, or the sandy bottom visible through the water nearby. The scene below the rocks was especially beautiful. We could see brightly colored fish, some of them red and some of them deep blue, which one would never find in the fish markets, swimming about in the clear water."
私はＫを説くときに、ぜひそこを明らかにしてやりたかったのです。しかしいえばきっと反抗されるに極きまっていました。また昔の人の例などを、引合ひきあいに持って来るに違いないと思いました。そうなれば私だって、その人たちとＫと違っている点を明白に述べなければならなくなります。それを首肯うけがってくれるようなＫならいいのですけれども、彼の性質として、議論がそこまでゆくと容易に後あとへは返りません。なお先へ出ます。そうして、口で先へ出た通りを、行為で実現しに掛かかります。彼はこうなると恐るべき男でした。偉大でした。自分で自分を破壊しつつ進みます。結果から見れば、彼はただ自己の成功を打ち砕く意味において、偉大なのに過ぎないのですけれども、それでも決して平凡ではありませんでした。彼の気性きしょうをよく知った私はついに何ともいう事ができなかったのです。その上私から見ると、彼は前にも述べた通り、多少神経衰弱に罹かかっていたように思われたのです。よし私が彼を説き伏せたところで、彼は必ず激するに違いないのです。私は彼と喧嘩けんかをする事は恐れてはいませんでしたけれども、私が孤独の感に堪たえなかった自分の境遇を顧みると、親友の彼を、同じ孤独の境遇に置くのは、私に取って忍びない事でした。一歩進んで、より孤独な境遇に突き落すのはなお厭いやでした。それで私は彼が宅うちへ引き移ってからも、当分の間は批評がましい批評を彼の上に加えずにいました。ただ穏やかに周囲の彼に及ぼす結果を見る事にしたのです。,"When I preached K, I definitely wanted to clarify that. However, I'm sure it was rebellious. Also, I thought that I must bring the examples of old people to the inquiries. Then I would have to clearly state what makes K different from those people. It would be nice if K would be able to agree with that, but by his nature, once the discussion goes that far, it won't easily turn back. I will go ahead. Then, it will take action to realize the street that was mentioned earlier by mouth. He was a terrifying man when this happened. It was great. Proceed while destroying yourself. From the results, he was just great in the sense of crushing his own success, but it was never mediocre. Knowing his temperament, I couldn't say anything at last. What's more, from my point of view, he seemed to have some memory weakness, as I said before. Alright, wherever I persuade him, he must be fierce. I wasn't afraid to quarrel with him, but when I look back on my situation where I couldn't stand the feeling of loneliness, it's best to put him in the same loneliness situation. It was something I couldn't stand. I was still reluctant to go one step further and plunge into a more lonely situation. So I didn't add any criticism on him for the time being, even after he moved home. I just decided to gently look at the consequences for him around me.","In order to bring about a change of heart in K, it was this above all that I would have to clarify to him. But if I spelled it out, he would doubtless resist; he would bring up the example of those stoics and saints of old in his defense, I knew, and I would then have to point out the difference between them and him. That would be worthwhile if he were of a mind to listen to me, but by nature, once an argument reached that point, he would stick to his guns. He would simply assert his own position more vehemently, and having once spoken he would feel obliged to follow through with action. In this respect he was quite intimidating. He was grand in his convictions. He would stride forward to meet his own destruction. In retrospect, the only thing that had any kind of grandeur was the resultant ruin of any hope of success. But there was certainly nothing run-of-the-mill about the process, at any rate. Knowing his temperament as I did, therefore, I couldn’t utter a word. My sense that he was close to a nervous breakdown also made me hesitate. Even if I did manage to convince him, it would only agitate him further. I didn’t mind quarreling, but I remembered how poorly I had withstood my own sense of isolation, and I couldn’t bear to think of placing my friend in a similar situation, let alone exacerbating it. And so, even after bringing him into the house, I held back from voicing any real criticism. I decided simply to wait calmly to see what effect his new environment would have on him.","I wanted to say all this to K. But I knew that he would violently disagree with me. And no doubt, I thought to myself, he would in the course of his argument refer to those men of the past. Meek as I was in his presence, I would then be obliged to point out the difference between him and them. He would take this as a rebuke, and would advance to a position more extreme than ever before in order to prove his consistency. And having done this, he would later feel compelled to put into practice what he had maintained in his argument with me. In this respect, he was really quite frightening—and very impressive. He would wilfully proceed to his own destruction. But however one looked at him, he was certainly no ordinary fellow. At any rate, I knew his character too well to think that I could tell him what I honestly thought. Moreover, I was afraid that he had become a little neurotic of late; and supposing that I could have worsted him in an argument, he would still have become terribly agitated. I was not afraid of quarreling with him, but remembering what pain my own loneliness had given me, I did not have the heart to place K, who was my friend, in a state of lonely isolation such as mine had been—or, worse still, push him into far greater loneliness than I myself had ever experienced. And so I tried not to be openly critical of his ways even after he had moved in with me. I decided to wait quietly and see what the change of surroundings would do for him."
一週間の後のち私はとうとう堪え切れなくなって仮病けびょうを遣つかいました。奥さんからもお嬢さんからも、Ｋ自身からも、起きろという催促を受けた私は、生返事なまへんじをしただけで、十時頃ごろまで蒲団ふとんを被かぶって寝ていました。私はＫもお嬢さんもいなくなって、家の内なかがひっそり静まった頃を見計みはからって寝床を出ました。私の顔を見た奥さんは、すぐどこが悪いかと尋ねました。食物たべものは枕元まくらもとへ運んでやるから、もっと寝ていたらよかろうと忠告してもくれました。身体からだに異状のない私は、とても寝る気にはなれません。顔を洗っていつもの通り茶の間で飯めしを食いました。その時奥さんは長火鉢ながひばちの向側むこうがわから給仕をしてくれたのです。私は朝飯あさめしとも午飯ひるめしとも片付かない茶椀ちゃわんを手に持ったまま、どんな風に問題を切り出したものだろうかと、そればかりに屈托くったくしていたから、外観からは実際気分の好よくない病人らしく見えただろうと思います。,"After a week, I finally became unbearable and used a false illness. When I was urged by my wife, my daughter, and K to get up, I just gave a live reply and slept with a futon futon until around 10 o'clock. I left the bed in anticipation of the time when K and the young lady were gone and the inside of the house was quietly quiet. The wife who saw my face immediately asked what was wrong. He advised me that I should sleep more because I will carry food and food to the bedside pillow. I don't feel like sleeping because I have no physical problems. I washed my face and ate rice in the living room as usual. At that time, his wife served me from the other side of the long fire bowl Nagahibachi. I was wondering how the problem was cut out while holding a tea bowl that couldn't be cleaned up with breakfast and lunch, so I really felt good from the outside. I think it looked like a bad sick person.","A week later I could finally wait no longer, and I faked illness to attain my end. I lay in bed until around ten, grunting a vague response when Okusan, Ojōsan, and K himself told me it was time to get up. When K and Ojōsan had both left and a hush had fallen on the house, I finally left my bed. “What’s the matter?” Okusan asked when she saw me appear. She urged me to go back to bed and said she would bring me something to eat. But I was in no mood to sleep further, being in fact perfectly well. I washed my face and ate in the sitting room as usual, while Okusan served me from the other side of the brazier. As I sat there, bowl in hand, eating what could be either breakfast or lunch, I was agonizing over how to broach the subject of Ojōsan, so no doubt I looked every bit the part of a suffering invalid.","A week went by, and I decided I could not wait any longer. I could think of no better plan than to feign illness and stay at home all day. Okusan, then Ojosan, and finally K himself came into my room to get me out of bed: I gave noncommittal answers to their questions, and allowed them to go away with the impression that I was not feeling very well. It was about ten o’clock when I finally crawled out of bed. Both K and Ojosan had gone out. There was not a sound in the house. Okusan, when she saw me, said: “You can’t be feeling well. Why don’t you stay in bed? I’ll bring you something to eat,” I was feeling perfectly healthy of course, and I had no desire to go back to bed. I washed my face, and had my breakfast in the morning room as usual. Okusan sat on the other side of the long brazier, and waited on me. It was a strange meal, being neither breakfast nor lunch; and during it, I remained silent, wondering uneasily how I should word my proposition. I have no doubt that Okusan misconstrued my preoccupation as a sign of illness."
私はこういって、心のうちでまた遠くから相当の医者でも呼んで、一つ見せようかしらと思案した。,I wondered if I could call a doctor from a distance and show me one.,"As I spoke, I began to feel it would be wise to call in a good doctor from somewhere else to have a look at him.",I began then to consider seriously calling in a good specialist once more and have him examine my father.
兄弟はまだ父の死なない前から、父の死んだ後あとについて、こんな風に語り合った。,The brothers talked like this before and after his father's death.,"Even while our father still lived, we were talking at cross-purposes about what would happen after his death.","And so, while their father was still alive, the two brothers talked of what they would do after his death."
「いいたい事があるのに、いわないで死ぬのも残念だろうし、といって、こっちから催促するのも悪いかも知れず」,"""It's a shame to die without saying something you want to say, but it may be bad to urge you from here.""","“It would be a great pity if he died leaving things he wanted to say unsaid, but on the other hand, it doesn’t seem right to press things from our side.”","“Of course, if he did have anything on his mind, it would be a pity to let him die without telling us about it."
四十九,Forty-nine,CHAPTER 103,"Then I looked around, and for the first time, I saw the blood on the wall."
私たちはそれほど仲の好いい兄弟ではなかった。小ちさいうちは好よく喧嘩けんかをして、年の少ない私の方がいつでも泣かされた。学校へはいってからの専門の相違も、全く性格の相違から出ていた。大学にいる時分の私は、ことに先生に接触した私は、遠くから兄を眺ながめて、常に動物的だと思っていた。私は長く兄に会わなかったので、また懸け隔たった遠くにいたので、時からいっても距離からいっても、兄はいつでも私には近くなかったのである。それでも久しぶりにこう落ち合ってみると、兄弟の優やさしい心持がどこからか自然に湧わいて出た。場合が場合なのもその大きな源因げんいんになっていた。二人に共通な父、その父の死のうとしている枕元まくらもとで、兄と私は握手したのであった。,"We weren't very close brothers. The little ones had a good fight, and I, who was younger, always cried. The difference in specialty after entering school was also due to the difference in personality. When I was in college, especially when I came in contact with my teacher, I looked at my brother from a distance and always thought that he was animal. I hadn't seen my brother for a long time, and I was so far away that he wasn't always close to me, either from time to time or from a distance. Even so, when I met each other for the first time in a long time, the kind feelings of my brothers naturally springed up from somewhere. The case was also a major source of the case. My brother and I shook hands at the father, the father who was dying, at the bedside pillow.","We two brothers were not terribly close. When we were little, we had fought a lot, and being the younger, I was constantly reduced to tears. In school our different choices of field of study clearly reflected our different characters. While I was at the university, and especially once I had come in contact with Sensei, I came to look on my distant brother as rather an animal. We had not met for a long time and lived very far apart, so both time and distance separated us. But circumstances had at last brought us together again, and a brotherly affection sprang up naturally between us. The nature of the situation played a large part. There at the bedside of our dying father, my brother and I were reconciled.","There had never been much brotherly love between us. We had fought a great deal when we were children, and I, being the younger, had invariably left the fight in tears. Again, the fact that we had studied different subjects at the university was an indication of the difference in our characters. When I was at the university, and especially after my meeting with Sensei, I used to regard my brother from afar and pronounce him a kind of animal. He was then living far away from me, and we had not seen each other for some years. We had become alienated by both distance and time. Nevertheless, when we met again after so long a separation, we found ourselves being drawn together by a gentle, brotherly feeling which seemed to come naturally from I know not where. No doubt, the circumstances of our reunion had much to do with it. We had, so to speak, clasped each other by the hand over the dying body of one who was father to us both."
「また来ましたね」といった。,"""You've come again,"" he said.","“You’re here again, eh?”","“You’re back again,” he said."
その時の私は父の前に存外ぞんがいおとなしかった。私はなるべく父の機嫌に逆らわずに、田舎いなかを出ようとした。父はまた私を引ひき留とめた。,"At that time, I was unexpectedly quiet in front of my father. I tried to leave the countryside without going against my father's mood. My father also kept me.","I was extraordinarily meek with him. I hoped to be able to leave without having to stand up to him, but he held me back.",I was being unusually obedient. I did not want to anger my father before leaving home.
私は自分の極きめた出立しゅったつの日を動かさなかった。,I didn't move my very best day of departure.,But I held to my original plan.,But I did not change my mind.
身体からだを半分起してそれを受け取った先生は、起きるとも寝るとも片付かないその姿勢のままで、変な事を私に聞いた。,"The teacher, who raised half of his body and received it, asked me something strange, keeping his posture that he couldn't get rid of when he woke up or slept.","He half-raised himself to take it. Then, still propped there, he asked me something odd.",Sensei half rose to take his hat. Then remaining in that position—neither sitting nor lying down—he asked me a strange question.
「したくない事はないでしょう」,"""There is nothing you don't want to do""",“I don’t imagine that you wouldn’t.”,"“It isn’t that you don’t want to fall in love, is it?”"
「じゃ失礼ですがもっと真中へ出て来て頂戴ちょうだい。ご退屈たいくつだろうと思って、お茶を入れて持って来たんですが、茶の間で宜よろしければあちらで上げますから」,"""I'm sorry, but please come out to the center more. I thought it was boring, so I brought some tea, but if it's okay in the living room, I'll give it over there.""","“Well, then, do please come on into the parlor. I brought a cup of tea thinking you might be bored here, but you can have it there if you’d rather.”","“Well, in that case, come along to the morning room, if you wish. I brought you some tea, thinking you must be bored. You can have it there.”"
「貰もらいッ子じゃ、ねえあなた」と奥さんはまた私の方を向いた。,"""Hey, you're a kid,"" said his wife, who turned to me again.",",” she said, turning to me again.","“An adopted child? Oh, no,” she said, and looked at me."
「先生、罪悪という意味をもっと判然はっきりいって聞かして下さい。それでなければこの問題をここで切り上げて下さい。私自身に罪悪という意味が判然解るまで」,"""Teacher, please tell me the meaning of guilt more clearly. If not, round up this issue here. Until I understand the meaning of guilt.""","“Sensei, please explain more carefully what you mean by sin. Otherwise, I’d prefer not to pursue this conversation until I’ve discovered for myself what you really mean.”","“Sensei, please explain more clearly what you mean by ‘guilt.’ Otherwise, please let us not discuss this matter again, until I have myself found out what this ‘guilt’ is.”"
「気じゃない。本当に身体からだが悪かないんでしょうか。どうも気分より健康の方が悪くなって行くらしい」,"""I don't care. It's really from my body, but isn't it bad? It seems that my health is getting worse than my mood.""","But I felt it was not so simple. “I don’t think it’s just his state of mind; I think he’s actually gone downhill physically. It’s his health that’s the problem, not his mood.”","“I don’t think that it is simply his mood,” I said. “I think that he is feeling really ill.”"
私はＫがその時何かいいはしなかったかと奥さんに聞きました。奥さんは別段何にもいわないと答えました。しかし私は進んでもっと細こまかい事を尋ねずにはいられませんでした。奥さんは固もとより何も隠す訳がありません。大した話もないがといいながら、一々Ｋの様子を語って聞かせてくれました。,"I asked my wife if K did something good at that time. The wife replied that she didn't say anything. But I couldn't help but be willing to ask for more details. The wife has no reason to hide anything from the beginning. He told me about K one by one, saying that there wasn't much to talk about.","I asked if K had said anything in response. Not really, she replied. But I could not resist pressing her for more detailed information. Okusan, of course, had no reason to hide anything. “There really is nothing worth telling,” she said, then launched into a thorough description of how he had taken the news.","“What did K say?” I asked. “Oh, nothing of great interest,” she said. But I pressed her to tell me in detail what K had said. Okusan of course had no reason to hide anything from me. Saying that there was really nothing much to tell, she proceeded to describe K’s reaction to the news."
「もう少し様子を見てからにしましょうか」と私は母に相談した。,"""Let's wait a little longer,"" I consulted with my mother.","“Should I stay a bit longer, just to see how it goes?”","“I think I’ll stay until things are more certain,” I said to my mother."
先生がどんなに苦しんでいるか、これも私には想像の及ばない問題であった。,How much the teacher was suffering was also an unimaginable problem for me.,But I was unable to imagine how Sensei was suffering.,"How he suffered, my imagination then could not conceive."
梅が咲くにつけて寒い風は段々向むきを南へ更かえて行った。それが一仕切ひとしきり経たつと、桜の噂うわさがちらほら私の耳に聞こえ出した。それでも私は馬車馬のように正面ばかり見て、論文に鞭むちうたれた。私はついに四月の下旬が来て、やっと予定通りのものを書き上げるまで、先生の敷居を跨またがなかった。,"As the plum blossomed, the cold wind gradually turned away to the south. After a single partition, rumors of cherry blossoms were heard in my ears. Still, I looked straight ahead like a carriage horse and was struck by the dissertation. I didn't straddle the teacher's threshold until late April finally came and I finally wrote what I had planned.","The plum trees bloomed, and the cold winter wind shifted to the south. Sometime later came the first rumors of cherry blossoms. Still I plowed doggedly ahead, like a blinkered workhorse, flogged mercilessly on by my thesis. Not until late April, when at last I had completed the writing, did I cross the threshold of Sensei’s house once more.","First, the plum trees bloomed, and then the cold wind veered towards the south. After a while, I heard that the cherry trees were beginning to flower. But I thought of nothing but my thesis. I did not visit Sensei once before the latter part of April, by which time I had finally completed my thesis."
二十四,Twenty-four,CHAPTER 24,But I did not change my mind.
手紙にはその後Ｋがどうしているか知らせてくれと書いてありました。姉が心配しているから、なるべく早く返事を貰もらいたいという依頼も付け加えてありました。Ｋは寺を嗣ついだ兄よりも、他家たけへ縁づいたこの姉を好いていました。彼らはみんな一つ腹から生れた姉弟きょうだいですけれども、この姉とＫとの間には大分だいぶ年歯としの差があったのです。それでＫの小供こどもの時分には、継母ままははよりもこの姉の方が、かえって本当の母らしく見えたのでしょう。,"The letter then said to let me know what K was doing. I also added a request to get a reply as soon as possible because my sister is worried. K preferred this older sister, who had a connection with another family, to her older brother who had a temple. They are all siblings born from one belly, but there was a big difference between this sister and K as a year-old tooth. Therefore, at the time of K's small child, this older sister would have looked more like a true mother than her stepmother.","The letter asked me to let him know what had happened to K since relations were severed. I should reply as soon as possible, he added, as K’s sister was worrying. K was fonder of this sister, who had married out, than he was of the elder brother who had inherited the family temple. K and his sister shared the same mother, but there was a large age gap between them, and when he was little, she must have seemed to him more of a mother than his adoptive mother.","In the letter, the brother-in-law asked me to let him know if all was well with K. He said that K’s sister was worried, and that she would like to have news of him as soon as possible. K was fonder of his sister than he was of his elder brother, who had succeeded to his father’s rectory. They were born of the same mother, but there was a considerable difference in age between K and his sister. To K, she must have seemed more of a mother than his stepmother ever did."
酒は止めたけれども、何もする気にはなりません。仕方がないから書物を読みます。しかし読めば読んだなりで、打うち遣やって置きます。私は妻から何のために勉強するのかという質問をたびたび受けました。私はただ苦笑していました。しかし腹の底では、世の中で自分が最も信愛しているたった一人の人間すら、自分を理解していないのかと思うと、悲しかったのです。理解させる手段があるのに、理解させる勇気が出せないのだと思うとますます悲しかったのです。私は寂寞せきばくでした。どこからも切り離されて世の中にたった一人住んでいるような気のした事もよくありました。,"I stopped drinking, but I don't feel like doing anything. I have no choice but to read a book. However, if you read it, as soon as you read it, you will put it in place. I was often asked by my wife what I was studying for. I was just laughing. But at the bottom of my stomach, I was sad to think that even the only person I love most in the world doesn't understand me. I was even more sad to think that I couldn't have the courage to understand, even though I had the means to understand. I was lonely. I often felt like I was separated from anywhere and lived alone in the world.","I gave up drink, but I remained disinclined to do anything else. I resorted to books again, to pass the time. But my reading was aimless—I simply read each book and tossed it aside. Whenever my wife asked what the point of my study was, I responded with a bitter smile. In my heart, though, I was saddened that the person I loved and trusted most in the world could not understand me. But it’s within your power to help her understand, I thought, and yet you’re too cowardly to do so, and I grew still sadder. Desolation filled me. There were many times when I felt I lived utterly alone, remote and cut off from the world around me.","In desperation, I began to read again. I read with no object in view, however. I would finish a book, then cast it aside, and open another. My wife asked me, on more than one occasion, why it was that I studied so hard. I was saddened by the thought that she, whom I loved and trusted more than anyone else in the world, could not understand me. And the thought that I had not the courage to explain myself to her made me sadder still. I was very lonely. Indeed, there were times when I felt that I stood completely alone in this world, cut off from every other living person."

I couldn't see the shadow of a person in the shoji shoji that had just dawned. However, the goldfish kept in a large pot set in front of the eaves was moving.","Rounding a bend in the path, we came upon the house on our left. The sliding doors were all wide open, and there was no sign of life in the empty interior. The only movement was of the goldfish that swam about in a large tub that stood by the eave.","We followed the winding path through the grove until we reached the house, which was on our left.

奥さんは何とも答えなかった。しばらくしてからこういった。,"The wife didn't answer at all. After a while, it was like this.","She made no reply at first, then said, “Actually, I’ve thought of something . . .”","Sensei’s wife said nothing. After a while, she began to speak again."
「ある日私は久しぶりに学校の図書館に入りました。私は広い机の片隅で窓から射す光線を半身に受けながら、新着の外国雑誌を、あちらこちらと引ひっ繰くり返して見ていました。私は担任教師から専攻の学科に関して、次の週までにある事項を調べて来いと命ぜられたのです。しかし私に必要な事柄がなかなか見付からないので、私は二度も三度も雑誌を借り替えなければなりませんでした。最後に私はやっと自分に必要な論文を探し出して、一心にそれを読み出しました。すると突然幅の広い机の向う側から小さな声で私の名を呼ぶものがあります。私はふと眼を上げてそこに立っているＫを見ました。Ｋはその上半身を机の上に折り曲げるようにして、彼の顔を私に近付けました。ご承知の通り図書館では他ほかの人の邪魔になるような大きな声で話をする訳にゆかないのですから、Ｋのこの所作しょさは誰でもやる普通の事なのですが、私はその時に限って、一種変な心持がしました。,"""One day I entered the school library for the first time in a long time. I was looking at new foreign magazines from one corner of a large desk, shining through a window on my half body. I was told by my homeroom teacher to look up some things about my department by the next week, but I couldn't find what I needed, so I went to the magazine twice or three times. I had to refinance. Finally, I finally found the paper I needed and read it out with all my heart, and suddenly there was something calling my name from the other side of the wide desk with a small voice. Yes. I suddenly raised my eyes and saw K standing there. K bent his upper body on the desk and brought his face closer to me. As you know, in the library I can't speak in a loud voice that disturbs other people, so this behavior of K is a normal thing that anyone does, but only then, I'm kind of weird. I felt like it.","One day I paid a rare visit to the university library. My supervisor had instructed me to check on something related to my field of study for the following week. Settling myself at a corner of one of the large desks, where the sunlight from the nearby window fell across me, I flipped through recently arrived foreign journals. I could not find what I wanted, however, so I had to keep going back to the shelves. Finally I came across the article I was after and set about avidly reading. At this point someone on the other side of the desk softly called my name. Raising my eyes, I discovered K standing there. He leaned forward over the desk toward me, his face close to mine. It is library etiquette not to disturb nearby readers, so K’s action was perfectly reasonable, but on this occasion it strangely unnerved me. “Are you studying?”","Not many days later, I paid one of my rare visits to the university library. I had been told by my supervisor to acquaint myself, before the following week, with certain facts concerning my field of specialization. I had to get up from my seat in the reading room and return to the stacks two or three times before I could locate what I wanted. I sat down at the end of the large desk and began to read carefully the article in the newly arrived foreign journal. The sun shone through the window, warming the upper part of my body. Then suddenly, I heard someone whispering my name from the other side of the desk. I looked up, and saw K standing there. He leaned over the desk so that he could get closer to me. As you know, we were not permitted to disturb others in the library by talking too loudly. K was therefore doing what any other student would have done in a similar situation. Nevertheless, K’s behavior gave me an odd sensation."
十八,XVIII,CHAPTER 18,I began to understand Sensei’s wife better.
二人はそれぎり話を切り上げて、小石川こいしかわの宿の方に足を向けました。割合に風のない暖かな日でしたけれども、何しろ冬の事ですから、公園のなかは淋さびしいものでした。ことに霜に打たれて蒼味あおみを失った杉の木立こだちの茶褐色ちゃかっしょくが、薄黒い空の中に、梢こずえを並べて聳そびえているのを振り返って見た時は、寒さが背中へ嚙かじり付いたような心持がしました。我々は夕暮の本郷台ほんごうだいを急ぎ足でどしどし通り抜けて、また向うの岡おかへ上のぼるべく小石川の谷へ下りたのです。私はその頃ころになって、ようやく外套がいとうの下に体たいの温味あたたかみを感じ出したぐらいです。,"The two rounded up the story and turned to Koishikawa Koishikawa's inn. It was a warm day with no wind, but it was winter, so the park was lonely. Especially when I look back at the brown-brown Sugi grove Kodachi, which has lost its blue taste due to the frost, and the treetops towering side by side in the dark sky, it is cold. I felt like I was biting on my back. We hurriedly passed through Hongodai Hongodai in the evening, and went down to the valley of Koishikawa to climb up to Okaoka on the other side. Around that time, I finally felt the warmth and warmth of my body under my cloak.","Our conversation came to a halt, and we turned toward home. It was a fairly warm and windless day, but nevertheless it was winter, and the leafless park felt desolate. I turned once to look back at the russet shapes of the frost-burned cedars, their tips neatly aligned against the gloomy sky, and felt the cold sink its teeth into my back. We hurried on in the dusk over Hongō Hill and dipped into the valley below Koishikawa. Only now did I at last feel the beginnings of a glow of warmth inside my overcoat.","In silence, we started to walk towards the house in Koishikawa. It was not very cold that day, for there was little wind. It was winter nevertheless, and the park looked bleak. I turned my head once, and looked back at the row of cedars. They were brown, and looked as if the frost had eaten all the greenness out of them. Over them stretched the grey sky. The coldness of the scene seemed to bite into my spine. Hurriedly, in the twilight, we walked over Hongo Hill. It was only after we had reached the bottom of the valley and started walking up the hill in Koishikawa that I began to feel warm under my overcoat."
「しかし卒業した以上は、少なくとも独立してやって行ってくれなくっちゃこっちも困る。人からあなたの所のご二男じなんは、大学を卒業なすって何をしてお出いでですかと聞かれた時に返事ができないようじゃ、おれも肩身が狭いから」,"""But once I graduate, I'm at least in trouble if I have to go independently. When someone asks me what my second son is going to do after graduating from college? If I can't reply, I have a narrow shoulder. ""","“But you must at least get yourself some independent means now that you’re graduated, or it makes things awkward for us too,” my father said. “How do you think I’d feel if people asked, ‘What’s your son doing now that he’s through university? ’ and I couldn’t reply?”","You mustn’t think that I am in the same happy situation as he was when he graduated.” “But you are a university graduate all the same,” said my father a little sullenly. “You mustn’t blame us if we now expect you to be financially independent. It’s rather embarrassing, you know, not to have an answer when I am asked, ‘Now that your younger son has graduated, what is he going to do?’ ”"
「でも医者はあの時到底とてもむずかしいって宣告したじゃありませんか」,"""But the doctor declared it very difficult at that time, didn't he?""","“But back then the doctor’s diagnosis was that it was a very problematic illness, wasn’t it?”",“But the doctor warned us then that father’s illness was serious.”
Ｋは低い声で勉強かと聞きました。私はちょっと調べものがあるのだと答えました。それでもＫはまだその顔を私から放しません。同じ低い調子でいっしょに散歩をしないかというのです。私は少し待っていればしてもいいと答えました。彼は待っているといったまま、すぐ私の前の空席に腰をおろしました。すると私は気が散って急に雑誌が読めなくなりました。何だかＫの胸に一物いちもつがあって、談判でもしに来られたように思われて仕方がないのです。私はやむをえず読みかけた雑誌を伏せて、立ち上がろうとしました。Ｋは落ち付き払ってもう済んだのかと聞きます。私はどうでもいいのだと答えて、雑誌を返すと共に、Ｋと図書館を出ました。,"I asked K to study in a low voice. I answered that I had something to look up. Still, K still hasn't let go of that face. Why don't we take a walk together in the same low tone? I answered that I could wait for a while. He immediately sat down in a vacant seat in front of me, waiting. Then I was distracted and suddenly couldn't read the magazine. There is something in K's chest, and it seems like he came to talk with him. I had no choice but to turn down the magazine I was reading and try to stand up. K asks if he's done calmly. I answered that I didn't care, returned the magazine, and left K and the library.","he asked in a low voice. “I have to look something up,” I replied. His face still hovered close to mine. In the same low voice he asked if I would come out for a walk. Yes, I replied, if he would wait just a little. “I’ll wait,” he said, and sank down on the chair directly in front of me. This had the effect of distracting me so much that I found it impossible to concentrate anymore. The conviction seized me that he had something up his sleeve and had come to discuss things with me. I was driven to lay down my journal and rise. “Finished?” K serenely inquired, seeing me begin to get to my feet. “It’s not important,” I answered. I returned the journal, and we left the library together.","“Studying?” he asked, still whispering. “There was something I had to look up,” I said. K would not move. His face was only a few inches away from mine. “Come out for a walk,” he said. “I will,” I said, “but you will have to wait.” “All right,” he said, and sat down in the empty chair opposite me. I found that I could not concentrate on the article any more. I was disturbed by the idea that K had come to discuss something serious with me. I gave up trying to read, and closing the magazine, I made as if to get up. Calmly, K asked, “Finished?” “No,” I answered, “but it doesn’t matter.” I returned the magazine and left the library with K."
「事実で差支さしつかえありませんが、私の伺いたいのは、いざという間際という意味なんです。一体どんな場合を指すのですか」,"""It's okay with the facts, but what I'd like to ask is that it's about to happen. What kind of case do you mean?""","“Yes, that’s all very well. But what do you mean by ‘when it comes to the crunch’? What sort of situation are you talking about?”",I was merely stating an obvious fact.” “I do not wish to deny that it is a fact. What I want to know is exactly what kind of temptation you were referring to.”
「もう大丈夫」,"""It's all right now""","“I’m fine again,” he announced, repeating the words he had spoken to me the previous winter, after he had had the first fall.","“I’m all right now,” he would repeatedly say to me, as he had done the previous winter."
「誰だれの墓へ参りに行ったか、妻さいがその人の名をいいましたか」,"""Who went to visit the grave, did my wife say that person's name?""",“Did my wife tell you whose grave I’ve come to visit?”,“Did my wife tell you whose grave I was visiting?”
先生はこういってまた歩き出した。私はとうとう先生をやり込める事を断念した。私たちの通る道は段々賑にぎやかになった。今までちらほらと見えた広い畠はたけの斜面や平地ひらちが、全く眼に入いらないように左右の家並いえなみが揃そろってきた。それでも所々ところどころ宅地の隅などに、豌豆えんどうの蔓つるを竹にからませたり、金網かなあみで鶏にわとりを囲い飼いにしたりするのが閑静に眺ながめられた。市中から帰る駄馬だばが仕切りなく擦すれ違って行った。こんなものに始終気を奪とられがちな私は、さっきまで胸の中にあった問題をどこかへ振り落してしまった。先生が突然そこへ後戻あともどりをした時、私は実際それを忘れていた。,"The teacher said this and started walking again. I finally gave up trying to get the teacher. The road we took became more and more lively. The wide Hatake slopes and flat ground fluttering that I could see here and there have been lined up with the houses on the left and right so that I can't see them at all. Even so, in some places, in the corners of the residential land, the vines of pea pea were entwined with bamboo, and the chickens were surrounded by chicken wire and kept in a quiet view. Pack animals returning from the city rubbed each other without partitions. I tend to be deprived of all the time by such things, and I have shaken off the problem that I had in my heart a while ago. When the teacher suddenly turned back there, I actually forgot about it.","“Pardon me,” he said, and set off walking again. I had lost all hope of getting the better of him. The road slowly grew more populous; houses now lined both sides, and we encountered no further signs of the earlier occasional sloping fields or patches of vacant land. Nevertheless, here and there on the corner of some block we saw a patch of garden with tendrils of bean vines twining up bamboo stakes, or chickens in a wire coop, which lent a certain serenity to the scene. Packhorses constantly passed us, heading home from town. Always interested in such things, I set aside the problem that had been concerning me. By the time Sensei returned to our earlier conversation, I had forgotten about it.","“Pardon me,” he said, as we set off again. I gave up all thought of trying to humiliate him. Gradually, the road became busier. The open fields that had been visible to us before were now almost completely hidden by rows of houses. Even then, there were sights that reminded us of the quiet countryside, such as peas growing around bamboo stakes in private gardens, and hens being kept in enclosures of wire netting. We passed an endless procession of cart horses, returning from the city. I, who was inclined to become absorbed in all such details of the scene around me, soon ceased to worry about what Sensei had said. Indeed, I had totally forgotten my last words to him, when he suddenly said to me:"
私は今前後の行ゆき掛がかりを忘れてしまったから、先生が何のためにこんな自白を私にして聞かせたのか、判然はっきりいう事ができない。けれども先生の態度の真面目まじめであったのと、調子の沈んでいたのとは、いまだに記憶に残っている。その時ただ私の耳に異様に響いたのは、「最も幸福に生れた人間の一対であるべきはずです」という最後の一句であった。先生はなぜ幸福な人間といい切らないで、あるべきはずであると断わったのか。私にはそれだけが不審であった。ことにそこへ一種の力を入れた先生の語気が不審であった。先生は事実はたして幸福なのだろうか、また幸福であるべきはずでありながら、それほど幸福でないのだろうか。私は心の中うちで疑うたぐらざるを得なかった。けれどもその疑いは一時限りどこかへ葬ほうむられてしまった。,"I've forgotten the clues about what happened before and after, so I can't really tell why the teacher told me this confession. However, I still remember that the teacher's attitude was serious and that he was in a bad mood. The only strange thing that sounded to my ears at that time was the last phrase, ""It should be the happiest pair of human beings."" Why did the teacher refuse to say that he should be a happy person? Only that was suspicious to me. In particular, the teacher's morale was suspicious. Is the fact really happy, and is it supposed to be happy, but not so happy? I had no choice but to doubt in my heart. However, the suspicion was buried somewhere for a while.","I no longer remember the context in which he said this, so I cannot really explain why he should have made such a confession, and to me. But I do remember that he spoke earnestly and seemed calm. The only thing that struck me as strange was that final phrase, we should be the happiest of couples. Why did he say “should be”? Why not say simply that they were? This alone disturbed me. Even more puzzling was the somehow forceful tone in which he spoke the words. Sensei had every reason to be happy, but was he in fact? I wondered. I could not repress my doubt. But it lasted only a moment, then was buried.","I cannot remember clearly why it was that he took the trouble of telling me this. But I do remember that his manner at the time was serious, and that he was calm. What struck me then as being odd was his last remark: “. . . we should be the happiest of couples.” Why “should be”? Why did he not say, “We are the happiest of couples”? Was Sensei indeed happy? I could not but wonder. But very soon, I brushed aside my doubts concerning Sensei’s happiness."
Ｋの話が一通り済んだ時、私は何ともいう事ができませんでした。こっちも彼の前に同じ意味の自白をしたものだろうか、それとも打ち明けずにいる方が得策だろうか、私はそんな利害を考えて黙っていたのではありません。ただ何事もいえなかったのです。またいう気にもならなかったのです。,"When K's story was over, I couldn't say anything. I wasn't silent because of that interest, whether it was a confession of the same meaning before him, or whether it would be better not to confess. I just couldn't say anything. I didn't feel like saying it again.","When K finished, I could say nothing. I was not struck dumb by any internal debate about whether it would be wiser to make the same confession to him or to keep my secret to myself. It was simply that I could not speak. Nor did I wish to.","When finally K stopped talking, I found myself unable to say anything. I want you to understand that I was not silent because I was debating with myself whether I should make a similar confession to K, or whether it would be wiser policy to say nothing about my love for Ojosan. I was simply unable to speak. Besides, I had no desire to break the silence."
「どうぞ隠さずにいって下さい。そう思われるのは身を切られるより辛いんだから」と奥さんがまたいった。「これでも私は先生のためにできるだけの事はしているつもりなんです」,"""Please don't hide it. It's more painful than being cut off,"" said his wife. ""I'm still doing what I can for my teacher.""","“Don’t feel you have to hide anything, please. It would be like a knife in the heart to have such a thing thought of me,” she continued. “I’m doing all I can for him. I’m doing my very best.” “Please don’t worry.","“Please tell me what you really think. The thought that you might secretly think me responsible is unbearable,” she said. “You see, I like to tell myself that I do whatever I can to help Sensei.”"
子供らしい私は、故郷ふるさとを離れても、まだ心の眼で、懐かしげに故郷の家を望んでいました。固よりそこにはまだ自分の帰るべき家があるという旅人たびびとの心で望んでいたのです。休みが来れば帰らなくてはならないという気分は、いくら東京を恋しがって出て来た私にも、力強くあったのです。私は熱心に勉強し、愉快に遊んだ後あと、休みには帰れると思うその故郷の家をよく夢に見ました。,"As a child, even after I left my hometown, I still had my heart's eyes and nostalgicly wanted my hometown. I was hoping in the hearts of travelers that there was still a house to return to. The feeling that I had to go home when the holidays came was strong even for me, who came out in love with Tokyo. After studying hard and having fun, I often dreamed of my hometown, where I thought I could go home on vacation.","Child that I still was, I looked back with a warm nostalgia on the house I had now left. I felt about it as a traveler feels about the home to which he will one day return. For all that I had longed to leave it for Tokyo, I had a strong compulsion to go back there when the summer holidays came, and I often had dreams of the house I would return to after the hard study and fun of the term were over.","As a child will, I loved my home; and when parted from it, there was a yearning for it in my heart. I was like a traveler who, no matter where he goes, never doubts that he will some day return to his place of birth. I came to Tokyo of my own free will, but I had little doubt that I should return when the holidays came. And so I studied and played in the great city, dreaming often of my home."
父は庭へ出て何かしていたところであった。古い麦藁帽むぎわらぼうの後ろへ、日除ひよけのために括くくり付けた薄汚うすぎたないハンケチをひらひらさせながら、井戸のある裏手の方へ廻まわって行った。,"My father was going out to the garden and doing something. Behind the old straw hat Mugiwarabo, I went around to the back of the well, fluttering a dingy, not too dirty handkerchief tied up for a sunshade.","He had been engaged in some task out in the garden, and now he went around to the well at the back of the house. As he walked, the grubby handkerchief he had fixed to the back of his old straw hat to keep off the sun flapped behind him.","I had found him in the garden. He was wearing an old straw hat, with a slightly soiled handkerchief attached to the back to shield his neck from the sun. The handkerchief swayed in the breeze as he walked towards the well behind the house."
こういってくれる裏に、私は二人が私に対してもっている過分な希望を読んだ。迂闊うかつな父や母は、不相当な地位と収入とを卒業したての私から期待しているらしかったのである。,"Behind the scenes, I read the unreasonable hope they have for me. The devious father and mother seemed to expect from me, who had just graduated from a disproportionate position and income.","Behind these words I read their exaggerated expectations for my future. Unthinkingly, they seemed to assume I would be able to find a position and salary far above what I could hope for as someone freshly graduated.","I began to suspect then that my parents had rather high hopes for my future. And it soon became clear that in their ignorance, they were expecting their university-educated son to find an important position with a huge salary."
奥さんは笑い出した。,The wife started laughing.,She laughed.,Sensei’s wife laughed.
その内うち年が暮れて春になりました。ある日奥さんがＫに歌留多かるたをやるから誰だれか友達を連れて来ないかといった事があります。するとＫはすぐ友達なぞは一人もないと答えたので、奥さんは驚いてしまいました。なるほどＫに友達というほどの友達は一人もなかったのです。往来で会った時挨拶あいさつをするくらいのものは多少ありましたが、それらだって決して歌留多かるたなどを取る柄がらではなかったのです。奥さんはそれじゃ私の知ったものでも呼んで来たらどうかといい直しましたが、私も生憎あいにくそんな陽気な遊びをする心持になれないので、好いい加減な生返事なまへんじをしたなり、打ちやっておきました。ところが晩になってＫと私はとうとうお嬢さんに引っ張り出されてしまいました。客も誰も来ないのに、内々うちうちの小人数こにんずだけで取ろうという歌留多ですからすこぶる静かなものでした。その上こういう遊技をやり付けないＫは、まるで懐手ふところでをしている人と同様でした。私はＫに一体百人一首ひゃくにんいっしゅの歌を知っているのかと尋ねました。Ｋはよく知らないと答えました。私の言葉を聞いたお嬢さんは、大方おおかたＫを軽蔑けいべつするとでも取ったのでしょう。それから眼に立つようにＫの加勢をし出しました。しまいには二人がほとんど組になって私に当るという有様になって来ました。私は相手次第では喧嘩けんかを始めたかも知れなかったのです。幸いにＫの態度は少しも最初と変りませんでした。彼のどこにも得意らしい様子を認めなかった私は、無事にその場を切り上げる事ができました。,"Among them, the year has passed and spring has come. One day, my wife will play Karuta for K, so there is a question about who will bring her friends. Then K immediately answered that he had no friends, and his wife was surprised. I see, K didn't have any friends. There were a few things that I would say hello to when I met them in the traffic, but even those weren't the ones that took karuta cards. My wife asked me if I could call her even if I knew it, but unfortunately I couldn't feel like playing such a cheerful game, so I made a sloppy reply. I've beaten it up. However, in the evening, K and I were finally pulled out by the young lady. It was very quiet because Karuta was trying to get it with only a small number of karuta, even though no customers came. What's more, K, who doesn't play such games, was just like a person playing in a pocket. I asked K if he knew the song of Hyakunin Isshu Hyakunin Isshu. K replied that he was not familiar with it. The young lady who heard my words probably took K as a contempt. Then I started to help K to stand out. In the end, the two of us almost came together to hit me. I might have started a fight depending on the other party. Fortunately, K's attitude hasn't changed at all. I didn't admit that he was good at anything, so I was able to finish the scene safely.","The year ended, and spring came. One day Okusan suggested to K that he invite some friends over so we could play the New Year game of poem cards.1 She was astonished when K responded that he had no friends. Indeed it was true, no one in K’s life really fit the description. He had a number of acquaintances who would pass the time of day with him when they came across each other, but they were hardly the kind of people to ask over for a game of cards. Okusan then turned to me and asked if I knew of anyone to invite, but I was not in the mood for such jolly games, so I gave a noncommittal reply. When evening came, however, Ojōsan dragged us both off to play. With just the four of us, it was a very subdued game. Unused to such frivolities as he was, moreover, K remained reserved and standoffish. I demanded to know whether he even knew the Hyakunin isshū poems. “Not really,” he replied. Ojōsan apparently took my words to be contemptuous, for she then began to lend him her obvious support, and in the end the two of them were more or less aligned against me. With any encouragement the situation could easily have escalated into a quarrel as far as I was concerned, but luckily K steadfastly maintained his earlier aloof indifference. I could detect not the slightest hint of triumph in him, so I managed to finish the game without incident.","The old year came to an end. One day, during the New Year season, Okusan said that we all ought to play a game of cards, and asked K if he would like to invite a friend to join us. “But I have no friends,” he answered. Okusan was shocked. K indeed had no friends. There were, of course, a few students with whom he had a nodding acquaintance, but he knew none of them well enough to ask them to join him and the family in a game of cards. Okusan then turned to me and said, “Well, in that case, why don’t you bring someone along?” I gave a noncommittal reply, since I was in no mood for merry games. That evening, however, Ojosan dragged K and me out of our rooms, and forced us to play cards with them. Since there were no guests, the gathering was small, and we had a very quiet game.10 K, who was unused to such lighthearted pastimes, sat like a block of wood. I said to him, “Don’t you know the Hyakunin Isshu poems?” “Not very well,” he answered. Ojosan must have thought that I was being unkind to K. She began conspicuously to help him whenever she could, and very soon, the game developed into a contest between me and these two. I might have picked a quarrel with them but for K’s manner, which showed no elation when Ojosan started taking his side. We were able to finish the game peacefully."
病室にはいつの間にか医者が来ていた。なるべく病人を楽にするという主意からまた浣腸かんちょうを試みるところであった。看護婦は昨夜ゆうべの疲れを休めるために別室で寝ていた。慣れない兄は起たってまごまごしていた。私わたくしの顔を見ると、「ちょっと手をお貸かし」といったまま、自分は席に着いた。私は兄に代って、油紙あぶらがみを父の尻しりの下に宛あてがったりした。,"A doctor came to the hospital room before I knew it. I was about to try an enema again with the intention of making the sick as easy as possible. The nurse slept in a separate room last night to relieve her tiredness. My unfamiliar brother was confused when he got up. When I looked at my face, I took a seat, saying, ""Lend me a little."" On behalf of my brother, I put an oil paper oil under my father's ass.","The doctor had appeared in the sickroom and was giving my father another enema in an attempt to ease his discomfort. The nurse, who had stayed up with him all night, was asleep in another room. Unused to such scenes, my brother was standing there looking unnerved. “Lend us a hand here,” he said when he saw me, and sat down again. I took his place by the bedside, helping out by holding the piece of oiled paper under my father’s buttocks.","During my absence from the room, the doctor had arrived. In an attempt to make my father more comfortable, he was about to give him an enema. The nurse, tired from the previous night’s vigil, had gone to the next room to sleep. My brother, who was not used to helping on such occasions, seemed at a loss. When he saw me enter, he said, “Here, give us a hand,” and promptly sat down. I took his place, and helped the doctor."
彼の口元をちょっと眺ながめた時、私はまた何か出て来るなとすぐ疳付かんづいたのですが、それがはたして何なんの準備なのか、私の予覚はまるでなかったのです。だから驚いたのです。彼の重々しい口から、彼のお嬢さんに対する切ない恋を打ち明けられた時の私を想像してみて下さい。私は彼の魔法棒のために一度に化石されたようなものです。口をもぐもぐさせる働きさえ、私にはなくなってしまったのです。,"When I glanced at his mouth for a moment, I immediately knew that something wouldn't come out again, but I had no idea what the preparation was. .. That's why I was surprised. Imagine me when you confess your sad love for his daughter from his heavy mouth. I'm like fossilized at once for his magic stick. I didn't even have the ability to muffle my mouth.","Seeing his mouth working now, I knew that something was coming, but I had no clue what was in store. You can imagine my amazement when K launched into a ponderous confession of his agonized love for Ojōsan. I froze, as if his words were a magic wand that turned me instantly to stone. My mouth failed to so much as twitch in an effort to respond.","Seeing the trembling of his lips, I knew that he was about to say something. But, of course, I had no inkling of what he was going to say. And so I was shocked. Imagine my reaction when K, in his heavy way, confessed to me his agonized love for Ojosan. I felt as if I had been turned into stone by a magician’s wand. I could not even move my lips as K had done. Exactly what the emotion was that I felt then , I am not sure."
室の広さは八畳でした。床とこの横に違ちがい棚だながあって、縁えんと反対の側には一間いっけんの押入おしいれが付いていました。窓は一つもなかったのですが、その代り南向みなみむきの縁に明るい日がよく差しました。,"The size of the room was 8 tatami mats. There was a different shelf next to the floor, and on the opposite side of the rim, there was a closet for a ken. I didn't have any windows, but instead, the bright sun often shined on the edge of the south facing Minamimuki.","It was a large room of eight tatami mats. The alcove had a pair of staggered shelves set into one side, and the wall opposite the veranda contained a long built-in cupboard. There were no windows, but the sun streamed in from the south-facing veranda.","It was an eight-mat room. There was an alcove, and beside it, some ornamental shelves. On the side opposite the verandah, there was a closet six feet wide. There were no windows, but the room opened onto a sunny verandah, facing the south."
私はそれから時々先生を訪問するようになった。行くたびに先生は在宅であった。先生に会う度数どすうが重なるにつれて、私はますます繁しげく先生の玄関へ足を運んだ。,"I then started visiting my teacher from time to time. Every time I went, the teacher was at home. As the number of times I met the teacher overlapped, I went to the teacher's entrance more and more prosperously.","I visited Sensei quite often thereafter. He was always at home when I called. And the more I saw of him, the sooner I wanted to visit him again.","After that day, I began to visit Sensei at regular intervals. I found him always at home. And the more I visited Sensei, the more eager I became to see him again."
それでも臆面おくめんなく色々の花が私の床を飾ってくれました。もっとも活方いけかたはいつ見ても同じ事でした。それから花瓶かへいもついぞ変った例ためしがありませんでした。しかし片方の音楽になると花よりももっと変でした。ぽつんぽつん糸を鳴らすだけで、一向いっこう肉声を聞かせないのです。唄うたわないのではありませんが、まるで内所話ないしょばなしでもするように小さな声しか出さないのです。しかも叱しかられると全く出なくなるのです。,"Even so, various flowers adorned my floor without hesitation. The best way to live was always the same. Then there was no strange example of vases or potatoes. But when it came to one piece of music, it was even more weird than a flower. You can't hear your voice at all just by ringing the thread. It's not that I don't sing, but it makes only a small voice, as if I were talking inside or not. Moreover, if you are scolded, it will not come out at all.","Yet day after day flowers were unashamedly arrayed in my alcove, although the arrangement always took the same form, and the receptacle never changed. As for the music, it was odder than the flowers. She simply plucked dully away at the instrument. I never heard her really sing the accompanying songs. She did murmur the words, it’s true, but in such a tiny voice that she might have been whispering secrets. And whenever the teacher scolded her, the voice ceased altogether.","Unblushingly, however, she persisted in decorating my alcove with flowers of all kinds. They were arranged always in the same way and always in the same vase. Stranger still was the music. All that one heard was a series of hesitant, disconnected plucking sounds, and one could hardly hear the singing that these sounds were meant to accompany. I do not say that she did not sing. But her singing was rather timid, and had what one might call a confidential tone. When scolded, she became even less audible."
奥さんは私の耳に私語ささやくような小さな声で、「実は変死したんです」といった。それは「どうして」と聞き返さずにはいられないようないい方であった。,"His wife whispered in my ears, saying, ""In fact, I died."" It was such a good person that I couldn't help but ask ""why"".","She lowered her voice to a whisper. “Actually, it wasn’t from natural causes.” Her tone provoked me to ask how he had died.","Then almost in a whisper, she added, “Actually, his death was not natural.” She said this in such a way that I could not help asking immediately, “How?”"
先生は庭の方を向いて笑った。しかしそれぎり奥さんの厭いやがる事をいわなくなった。私もあまり長くなるので、すぐ席を立った。先生と奥さんは玄関まで送って出た。,"The teacher turned to the garden and laughed. However, I didn't say that my wife was reluctant. I also got too long, so I left my seat right away. The teacher and his wife sent them to the front door.","Sensei looked out at the garden and smiled. But to avoid upsetting her further, he said no more on the subject. I was overstaying my visit, so I hastily rose again to leave. Sensei and his wife saw me to the entrance hall.","Sensei turned towards the garden, and laughed. But to please her, he dropped the subject. It was getting late, and so I stood up to go. Sensei and his wife came to the front hall with me."
「でも退屈でしょう」,"""But it's boring.""","“But you must be bored, surely.”","“Then you must be bored.” “Oh, no."
父は去年の暮倒れた時に私に向かっていったと同じ言葉をまた繰り返した。その時ははたして口でいった通りまあ大丈夫であった。私は今度もあるいはそうなるかも知れないと思った。しかし医者はただ用心が肝要だと注意するだけで、念を押しても判然はっきりした事を話してくれなかった。私は不安のために、出立しゅったつの日が来てもついに東京へ立つ気が起らなかった。,"My dad repeated the same words he went to me when he fell down last year. At that time, as I said, it was all right. I thought it might or might not happen again. However, the doctor just cautioned that caution was essential, and even if he was reminded, he did not tell us anything clearly. Because of my anxiety, I didn't feel like going to Tokyo at last when the day I left was coming.","“I’m fine again,” he announced, repeating the words he had spoken to me the previous winter, after he had had the first fall. At that time he had indeed been more or less fine, and I hoped that the same would prove to be the case this time. But the doctor just cautioned us to be careful, and even when we pressed him, he would say nothing more definite. Because of this fresh anxiety, when the day of my departure arrived, I no longer felt inclined to go.","“I’m all right now,” he would repeatedly say to me, as he had done the previous winter. Then, he had been more or less all right as he had claimed. I thought hopefully that he might be proved right once more. Despite persistent questioning, however, the doctor would tell me nothing, except that constant care was necessary. The day which had been fixed for my departure arrived, but through anxiety for my father, I decided to postpone my trip to Tokyo."
二十六,Twenty-six,CHAPTER 26,"I was free at last, when the double cherry blossoms had all fallen and in their place misty green leaves had begun to grow."
奥さんと私はできるだけの手際てぎわと工夫を用いて、Ｋの室へやを掃除しました。彼の血潮の大部分は、幸い彼の蒲団ふとんに吸収されてしまったので、畳はそれほど汚れないで済みましたから、後始末は［＃「後始末は」は底本では「後始未は」］まだ楽でした。二人は彼の死骸しがいを私の室に入れて、不断の通り寝ている体ていに横にしました。私はそれから彼の実家へ電報を打ちに出たのです。,"My wife and I cleaned K's room with all the dexterity and ingenuity we could. Fortunately, most of his blood was absorbed by his futon futon, so the tatami mats weren't so dirty. ] It was still easy. They put his corpse in my room and laid it down on his sleeping body all the time. I then sent a telegram to his parents' house.","The two of us set to work and cleaned up his room with all the skill and efficiency we could muster. Luckily, most of his blood had been absorbed by the bedding and the floor matting was not much harmed, so our task was relatively easy. Together we carried his corpse into my room and laid it out on its side in a natural sleeping position. I then went off and sent a telegram to his family.","Okusan and I cleaned up the room as well as we could. Fortunately, most of the blood had been absorbed by the quilted bedding, and very little had touched the floor mats. We moved K’s body to my room, and laid it out in a sleeping position. I then went out to send a telegram to his family."
話しているうちに、私は色々の知識を奥さんから得たような気がしました。しかしそれがために、私は機会を逸いっしたと同様の結果に陥おちいってしまいました。私は自分について、ついに一言いちごんも口を開く事ができませんでした。私は好いい加減なところで話を切り上げて、自分の室へやへ帰ろうとしました。,"While talking, I felt like I got a lot of knowledge from my wife. But because of that, I fell into the same result as I missed the opportunity. I couldn't even say a word about myself at last. I rounded up the story in a sloppy way and tried to go back to my room.","I felt I was gaining quite a lot of information as I listened. Effectively, however, I had forfeited my own chance to speak. I couldn’t say a word on my own behalf now. At an appropriate point I broke off the conversation and returned to my room.","As the conversation progressed, I felt that I was learning much that was of interest to me from Okusan. But I had lost the opportunity of talking about myself. Thinking that I could not, at this late stage in the conversation, put in a word on my own behalf, I decided to leave as soon as I could do so without seeming rude. Ojosan was sitting near me when I told them what my friend had said that morning: she even said merrily, “That’s going too far!”; but she had quietly withdrawn to the corner of the room in the course of the conversation, and was now sitting with her back turned towards me."
先生はあきれたといった風ふうに、私の顔を見た。巻烟草まきタバコを持っていたその手が少し顫ふるえた。,The teacher looked at my face as if he was disappointed. The hand holding the cigarette was shaken a little.,Sensei stared at me in astonishment. The hand that held his cigarette trembled a little.,"Sensei stared at me in astonishment. I saw that his hand, which held a cigarette, was shaking a little."
二十五,twenty five,CHAPTER 79,I decided to wait quietly and see what the change of surroundings would do for him.
「Ｋと私わたくしは同じ科におりながら、専攻の学問が違っていましたから、自然出る時や帰る時に遅速がありました。私の方が早ければ、ただ彼の空室くうしつを通り抜けるだけですが、遅いと簡単な挨拶あいさつをして自分の部屋へはいるのを例にしていました。Ｋはいつもの眼を書物からはなして、襖ふすまを開ける私をちょっと見ます。そうしてきっと今帰ったのかといいます。私は何も答えないで点頭うなずく事もありますし、あるいはただ「うん」と答えて行き過ぎる場合もあります。,"""K and I are in the same department, but the academics of the majors are different, so there was a delay when leaving and returning naturally. If I was faster, I would just go through his vacant room. However, when I was late, I used to give a simple greeting and enter my room as an example. K took his usual eyes off the book and looked at me opening the fusuma bran for a moment. I'm sure I'm back now. Sometimes I don't answer anything and nod, or I just say ""yes"" and go too far.","Although K and I were in the same faculty, our fields of study were different, which meant that we came and went at different times. If I returned home early, I could simply pass through his empty room to reach my own. If he got home before I did, I always acknowledged him briefly before going on into my room. As I came through the door, K would glance up from his book and invariably say: “Just back, are you?” Sometimes I’d nod, and sometimes I’d simply give a grunt of assent.","We would therefore leave the house and return to it at different times. If I was the first to get back, I would simply walk through his room to get to my own; but if I happened to return after him, then I would say a word or two to him in passing. K would look up from whatever he was reading when he heard me opening the door, and say, in answer to my greeting: “Did you just get back?” I would nod silently, or say “Yes,” as I walked past his desk."
私は想像で知っていた。しかし事実としては知らなかった。いずれにしても先生のいう罪悪という意味は朦朧もうろうとしてよく解わからなかった。その上私は少し不愉快になった。,"I knew by imagination. But I didn't know it as a fact. In any case, I couldn't understand the meaning of guilt that the teacher said. Besides, I became a little uncomfortable.","I knew it well enough in my fantasies, but not from reality. But my mind was on another matter. Sensei’s use of the word sin made no sense to me. And I was feeling a little upset.","I could imagine what Sensei meant, but inexperienced as I was, his words held no reality for me. Also, I had no notion of what Sensei meant by “guilt.” I felt a little discontented."
私わたくしの行ったのはまだ灯ひの点つくか点かない暮れ方であったが、几帳面きちょうめんな先生はもう宅うちにいなかった。「時間に後おくれると悪いって、つい今しがた出掛けました」といった奥さんは、私を先生の書斎へ案内した。,"What I went to was the way the lights were lit or not, but the meticulous teacher was no longer at home. The wife, who said, ""I just went out because it was bad to be late,"" guided me to the teacher's study.","I arrived at dusk, about the time the lights are beginning to be lit. Sensei, ever punctilious, had already left. “He didn’t want to be late, so he set out just a moment ago,” his wife told me as she led me to the study.","Sensei, who was a punctilious man, had already left. “My husband did not want to be late. He left only a minute ago,” said Sensei’s wife, as she led me to her husband’s study."
八,Eight,CHAPTER 62,"And I began to feel that unless I did something, I might be lost."
「その内妻さいの母が病気になりました。医者に見せると到底とうてい癒なおらないという診断でした。私は力の及ぶかぎり懇切に看護をしてやりました。これは病人自身のためでもありますし、また愛する妻のためでもありましたが、もっと大きな意味からいうと、ついに人間のためでした。私はそれまでにも何かしたくって堪たまらなかったのだけれども、何もする事ができないのでやむをえず懐手ふところでをしていたに違いありません。世間と切り離された私が、始めて自分から手を出して、幾分でも善いい事をしたという自覚を得たのはこの時でした。私は罪滅つみほろぼしとでも名づけなければならない、一種の気分に支配されていたのです。,"""My wife's mother got sick. It was a diagnosis that she would never heal when I showed her to the doctor. I took care of her as much as I could. This is also for the sick person herself. And it was for my beloved wife, but in a bigger sense, it was finally for humans. I couldn't do anything, even though I was dying to do something before. So I must have been unavoidably doing it in my pocket. It was at this time that I, who was separated from the world, realized that I had done something good for the first time. I was dominated by a kind of mood that I had to call the sinful mischief.","Time passed, and my wife’s mother became ill. The doctor who examined her told us it was incurable. I nursed her devotedly, both for her own sake and for the sake of the wife I loved. In larger terms, however, I did so also for the sake of humanity itself. I had long felt an urgent need to act in some way, but I remained at an impasse, sitting idle as the years passed. Isolated as I was from the human world, I felt for the first time that I was doing something of real worth. I was sustained by what I can only describe as a sense of atonement for past sin.","Then my mother-in-law fell ill. The doctor told us she would not recover. I devoted all my energy to caring for her. I did so for the invalid’s sake, and for my dear wife’s too; but I felt also that I was in some way helping the whole of mankind. There is no doubt that in a sense, I had been waiting for such a chance to prove to myself that I was not totally useless. For the first time since my retirement from the world, I was able to feel that I could still be of some use to others. There is no way to explain my state of mind, except to say that I was seeking a means of atoning for the wrong I had done."
「私は相変らず学校へ出席していました。しかし教壇に立つ人の講義が、遠くの方で聞こえるような心持がしました。勉強もその通りでした。眼の中へはいる活字は心の底まで浸しみ渡らないうちに烟けむのごとく消えて行くのです。私はその上無口になりました。それを二、三の友達が誤解して、冥想めいそうに耽ふけってでもいるかのように、他たの友達に伝えました。私はこの誤解を解こうとはしませんでした。都合の好いい仮面を人が貸してくれたのを、かえって仕合しあわせとして喜びました。それでも時々は気が済まなかったのでしょう、発作的に焦燥はしゃぎ廻まわって彼らを驚かした事もあります。,"""I was still attending school, but I felt like I could hear the lectures of the teachers in the distance. I was studying, too. The type in my eyes was It disappears like a smoke before it soaks into the bottom of my heart. I'm also silent. A few friends misunderstand it and indulge in meditation. I told my other friends, I didn't try to get rid of this misunderstanding. I was happy to see someone lend me a mask that was convenient for me. Sometimes I wasn't satisfied, and I was surprised at the frustration of the sickness.","I kept up my attendance at college, but the professors’ lectures sounded distant in my ears. It was the same with my own study. My eyes took in the print on the page, yet its meaning vanished like a wisp of smoke before it really penetrated. I grew taciturn. Several friends, misinterpreting this, reported to others that I seemed as if deep in meditation. I made no attempt to correct them; in fact, I was delighted to be provided with this convenient mask. But at times some inner dissatisfaction would produce an outburst of high-spirited romping, astonishing my friends.","But the professors who stood on the platforms seemed very far away, and their voices faint. I could not study either. The printed characters that my eyes saw disappeared like rising smoke before they reached my mind. Also, I became silent. Two or three of my friends misconstrued my silence, and reported to the others that I seemed to be deep in some kind of philosophic meditation. I did not try to undeceive them. Indeed, I was happy to hide behind the mask that they had unwittingly put on me. I cannot have been entirely satisfied with the role, however. I would sometimes throw fits of riotous merrymaking that would shock them considerably."

先生は同じ言葉を二遍へん繰り返した。その言葉は森閑しんかんとした昼の中うちに異様な調子をもって繰り返された。私は急に何とも応こたえられなくなった。,The teacher repeated the same words twice. The words were repeated in a strange tone during the quiet daytime. Suddenly I couldn't respond to anything.,The repeated word hung strangely in the hushed midday air. I found myself suddenly unable to reply.,". . ?” he said. Then again, “How in the world . . . ?” His words, repeated, seemed to have a strange echo-like effect in the stillness of the afternoon. I did not know what to say."
私は黙って二人の傍そばに坐っていました。奥さんは私にも線香を上げてやれといいます。私は線香を上げてまた黙って坐っていました。お嬢さんは私には何ともいいません。たまに奥さんと一口ひとくち二口ふたくち言葉を換かわす事がありましたが、それは当座の用事についてのみでした。お嬢さんにはＫの生前について語るほどの余裕がまだ出て来なかったのです。私はそれでも昨夜ゆうべの物凄ものすごい有様を見せずに済んでまだよかったと心のうちで思いました。若い美しい人に恐ろしいものを見せると、折角せっかくの美しさが、そのために破壊されてしまいそうで私は怖こわかったのです。私の恐ろしさが私の髪の毛の末端まで来た時ですら、私はその考えを度外に置いて行動する事はできませんでした。私には綺麗きれいな花を罪もないのに妄みだりに鞭むちうつと同じような不快がそのうちに籠こもっていたのです。,"I was silently sitting beside them. My wife tells me to raise incense sticks as well. I raised the incense stick and sat silently again. The young lady doesn't say anything to me. Occasionally, I exchanged words with my wife, but it was only for the time being. The young lady hadn't had enough time to talk about K's life. Even so, I was glad I didn't have to show the terrible appearance of last night. When I showed a terrifying thing to a young beautiful person, I was afraid that the beauty would be destroyed because of it. Even when my horror came to the end of my hair, I couldn't act out of that idea. Even though I was innocent of a beautiful flower, I had the same discomfort as a whip whip in a delusion.","Wordlessly, I seated myself beside them. Okusan urged me to offer incense before the corpse. I did so , then returned to sit quietly again. Ojōsan did not speak to me. Occasionally she exchanged a few words with her mother, but they concerned only the immediate situation. She did not yet have the where-withal to speak of K as he had been in life. I was glad at least that she had been spared the horrible scene of the night before. I trembled to imagine how such a terrible sight could destroy the loveliness of one so young and beautiful. This thought haunted me, even when my own fear raised the very hairs on my head. It brought the kind of shudder one would feel in setting mercilessly upon a beautiful, innocent flower with a whip.","Silently, I sat down beside the two ladies. “Offer an incense stick,” said Okusan. I obeyed her in silence. Ojosan did not speak to me. She exchanged a few words with her mother, but only concerning pressing business. She could not bring herself to talk of K as she remembered him. I was glad that she had not witnessed the terrible scene immediately after his death. I was afraid that a beautiful person such as she could not behold anything ugly and frightful without somehow losing her beauty. Even when the fear within me became so strong that it seemed to touch the very roots of my hair, I refused to move, not daring to expose her beauty to ugliness. I thought that to help destroy such beauty would be no less cruel and meaningless than to beat down a pretty, innocent flower."
「何にもしていないんです」と私が答えた。,"""I'm not doing anything,"" I replied.",“He doesn’t do anything.”,"“He does nothing,” I replied."
私は二度同じ言葉を繰り返しました。そうして、その言葉がＫの上にどう影響するかを見詰めていました。,I repeated the same words twice. Then I was watching how the word would affect K.,"“Anyone without spiritual aspirations is a fool,” I repeated, watching to see what effect these words would have on K.",I said again: “Anyone who has no spiritual aspirations is an idiot.” I watched K closely. I wanted to see how my words were affecting him.
「先生に手紙を書きましたよ。あなたのおっしゃった通り。ちょっと読んでご覧なさい」,"""I wrote a letter to my teacher. As you said. Please read a little.""","Before I sealed it, I said to my mother, “I’ve written to Sensei, just as you wanted. Here, have a look.”","“See, I’ve written a letter to Sensei as you suggested. Won’t you read it?”"
私は私の過去を善悪ともに他ひとの参考に供するつもりです。しかし妻だけはたった一人の例外だと承知して下さい。私は妻には何にも知らせたくないのです。妻が己おのれの過去に対してもつ記憶を、なるべく純白に保存しておいてやりたいのが私の唯一ゆいいつの希望なのですから、私が死んだ後あとでも、妻が生きている以上は、あなた限りに打ち明けられた私の秘密として、すべてを腹の中にしまっておいて下さい。,"I will use my past as a reference for others, both good and evil. But be aware that my wife is the only exception. I don't want my wife to know anything. My only hope is to keep my wife's memory of her past in pure white as much as possible, so even after I die, as long as my wife is alive, you Keep everything in your stomach as my secret, which has been revealed to the limit.","My aim has been to present both the good and bad in my life, for others to learn from. I must make clear to you, however, that my wife is the sole exception. I want her told nothing. My one request is that her memory of my life be preserved as untarnished as possible. While she remains alive, I therefore ask that you keep all this to yourself, a secret intended for your eyes alone.","I want both the good and bad things in my past to serve as an example to others. But my wife is the one exception —I do not want her to know about any of this. My first wish is that her memory of me should be kept as unsullied as possible. So long as my wife is alive, I want you to keep everything I have told you a secret—even after I myself am dead."
私はそのうち先生の留守に行って、奥さんと二人差向さしむかいで話をする機会に出合った。先生はその日横浜よこはまを出帆しゅっぱんする汽船に乗って外国へ行くべき友人を新橋しんばしへ送りに行って留守であった。横浜から船に乗る人が、朝八時半の汽車で新橋を立つのはその頃ころの習慣であった。私はある書物について先生に話してもらう必要があったので、あらかじめ先生の承諾を得た通り、約束の九時に訪問した。先生の新橋行きは前日わざわざ告別に来た友人に対する礼義れいぎとしてその日突然起った出来事であった。先生はすぐ帰るから留守でも私に待っているようにといい残して行った。それで私は座敷へ上がって、先生を待つ間、奥さんと話をした。,"Eventually, I went to the teacher's absence and met the opportunity to talk with my wife in a face-to-face manner. The teacher was away on the steamer that set sail from Yokohama Yokohama that day, sending a friend who should go abroad to Shinbashi Shinbashi. It was customary at that time for people boarding a ship from Yokohama to stand at Shimbashi by train at 8:30 in the morning. I had to ask the teacher to talk about a book, so I visited at the promised 9 o'clock, as I had obtained the teacher's consent in advance. The teacher's trip to Shimbashi was an event that suddenly happened that day as a decency to a friend who came all the way to Shimbashi the day before. The teacher will be back soon, so I told him to wait for me even when I was away. So I went up to the tatami room and talked to my wife while I was waiting for the teacher.","Sometime later I stopped by when Sensei happened to be out, and I had a chance to talk directly with his wife. Sensei had gone to Shinbashi station to see off a friend who was sailing abroad that day from Yokohama. Customarily, those taking a ship from Yokohama would set off on the boat-train from Shinbashi at eight-thirty in the morning. I had arranged with Sensei to stop by that morning at nine, as I wanted his opinion on a certain book. Once there, I learned of his last-minute decision to see off his friend, as a gesture of thanks for the trouble he had taken to pay Sensei a special farewell visit the day before. Sensei had left instructions that he would soon be back, so I was to stay there and await his return. And so it came about that, as I waited in the living room, his wife and I talked.","One day, for the first time since I met her, I had a good talk with Sensei’s wife. I had previously asked Sensei to discuss a book with me, and he had kindly invited me to visit him that day for that purpose. I arrived at nine o’clock in the morning, as arranged. I found Sensei out. A friend of his, I learned, was sailing from Yokohama, and Sensei had gone to see him off at Shimbashi. In those days, the boat train to Yokohama customarily left Shimbashi at eight-thirty in the morning. Sensei had left a message for me, however, saying that he would be back soon and that I should wait. While waiting for Sensei, therefore, I talked to his wife."
宅うちへ着いた時、奥さんは二人の姿を見て驚きました。二人はただ色が黒くなったばかりでなく、むやみに歩いていたうちに大変瘠やせてしまったのです。奥さんはそれでも丈夫そうになったといって賞ほめてくれるのです。お嬢さんは奥さんの矛盾がおかしいといってまた笑い出しました。旅行前時々腹の立った私も、その時だけは愉快な心持がしました。場合が場合なのと、久しぶりに聞いたせいでしょう。,"When I got home, my wife was surprised to see them. Not only did they turn black, but they also became very thin while walking unnecessarily. His wife praises him for being strong. The young lady started laughing again, saying that her wife's contradiction was strange. Even though I was sometimes angry before the trip, I had a pleasant feeling only at that time. It's probably because I heard it for the first time in a long time.","Okusan was taken aback at our appearance when we arrived. Not only were we black from the sun, we were gaunt from the long, exhausting walk. She nevertheless congratulated us on looking so much stronger, and Ojōsan laughed at her inconsistency. No doubt it was the combination of the circumstance and the pleasure of hearing her laughter again, but in that moment I was happy, freed of the anger that had plagued me before the trip. CHAPTER 86","Okusan, when she saw us, was shocked by our appearance. Not only were we black, but the walking had made us terribly thin. She soon recovered from her shock, however, and was good enough to say that we looked very healthy. “But you are so inconsistent,” said Ojosan, and laughed at her mother. I felt cheerful, forgetting that I had left Tokyo not without resentful feelings toward her. After all, I had not seen her for some time, and the occasion was, I suppose, a happy one."
移って二カ月ほどしてから私は無事に大学を卒業しました。卒業して半年も経たたないうちに、私はとうとうお嬢さんと結婚しました。外側から見れば、万事が予期通りに運んだのですから、目出度めでたいといわなければなりません。奥さんもお嬢さんもいかにも幸福らしく見えました。私も幸福だったのです。けれども私の幸福には黒い影が随ついていました。私はこの幸福が最後に私を悲しい運命に連れて行く導火線ではなかろうかと思いました。,"About two months after I moved, I graduated from college safely. Less than half a year after graduating, I finally got married to my daughter. Seen from the outside, everything went as expected, so I have to say that it's a good idea. Both the wife and the young lady looked very happy. I was happy too. But my happiness was accompanied by a black shadow. I wondered if this happiness was the last fuse that would take me to a sad fate.","After two months I graduated from the university. Six months later Ojōsan and I finally married. On the face of things I could congratulate myself on all having gone according to plan. Both Okusan and Ojōsan seemed wonderfully happy, and so indeed was I. But a black shadow hovered behind my happiness. This very happiness, it seemed to me, could well be a fuse that drew the flame of my life toward a bitter fate.","About two months later, I was able to graduate from the university. Half a year after that, Ojosan and I were married at last. On the surface at least, I suppose it was a happy occasion. After all, my hopes had been realized. Okusan and Ojosan both appeared happy. I will admit that I was too. But over my happiness, there loomed a black shadow. It seemed that my momentary contentment led nowhere, except to a sorrowful future."
私の論文は自分が評価していたほどに、教授の眼にはよく見えなかったらしい。それでも私は予定通り及第した。卒業式の日、私は黴臭かびくさくなった古い冬服を行李こうりの中から出して着た。式場にならぶと、どれもこれもみな暑そうな顔ばかりであった。私は風の通らない厚羅紗あつラシャの下に密封された自分の身体からだを持て余した。しばらく立っているうちに手に持ったハンケチがぐしょぐしょになった。,"It seems that my dissertation did not look as good to the professor's eyes as I had evaluated. Still, I went as planned. On the day of the graduation ceremony, I put on my old winter clothes, which had become moldy and moldy, out of my luggage. When I lined up at the ceremonial hall, all of them looked hot. I left my body sealed under the windless Atsurasha. While I was standing for a while, the handkerchief I had in my hand became messy.","Apparently my teachers did not find my thesis quite as good as I thought it was. Nevertheless, I managed to pass. On the day of graduation I retrieved from the trunk my musty old formal winter wear and put it on. Up and down the rows of graduating students in the ceremony hall, every face looked heat-oppressed, and my own body, sealed tightly in thick wool impenetrable to any breeze, sweltered uncomfortably. I had been standing only a short time when the handkerchief I held was sodden with sweat.","My professors apparently did not have as high an opinion of my thesis as I did. I was, however, allowed to graduate that year. On the day of the graduation ceremony, I brought out my old and musty winter uniform from my suitcase, and put it on. Everyone around me in the graduation hall looked hot. My body felt as if it had been sealed in an airtight envelope of thick wool. Very quickly, the handkerchief that I was holding in my hand became soaking wet."
その日の談話もついにこれぎりで発展せずにしまった。私わたくしはむしろ先生の態度に畏縮いしゅくして、先へ進む気が起らなかったのである。,The discourse of the day has finally stopped developing. I was rather afraid of the teacher's attitude and didn't feel like moving forward.,"Our conversation that day went no further. Indeed, I had no desire to pursue the subject. I quailed to hear Sensei speak like that.","We talked no more about the subject that day. I was somewhat awed by his manner, and I did not want to ask him any more questions."
「ええ別に寄る所もありませんから」,"""Yes, there is no place to stop by.""","“Yes, there’s nowhere else I need to go.”",“Yes. There is nothing else I particularly want to do now.”
先生はこれ以外に何も答えなかった。私もその話はそれぎりにして切り上げた。すると一町ちょうほど歩いた後あとで、先生が不意にそこへ戻って来た。,"The teacher didn't answer anything else. I also rounded up the story. Then, after walking about a town, the teacher suddenly came back there.","Sensei said no more, and I decided not to pursue the conversation. About a hundred yards on, however, he abruptly broke the silence.","Sensei would say no more about it. I decided to mention the matter no further. But after he had walked a hundred yards or so, Sensei suddenly reopened the conversation."
「大方おおかた手紙で何とかいってきて下さるつもりだろうよ」,"""Most of the time, I'm sure you'll get me a letter.""","“He must plan on sending a letter about it,” she said, still insisting on interpreting things in terms of the position that Sensei was helping me procure.","“I think that he will soon be writing to you about it,” she said."
「そんな弱い事をおっしゃっちゃいけませんよ。今に癒なおったら東京へ遊びにいらっしゃるはずじゃありませんか。お母さんといっしょに。今度いらっしゃるときっと吃驚びっくりしますよ、変っているんで。電車の新しい線路だけでも大変増ふえていますからね。電車が通るようになれば自然町並まちなみも変るし、その上に市区改正もあるし、東京が凝じっとしている時は、まあ二六時中にろくじちゅう一分もないといっていいくらいです」,"""Don't say such a weak thing. Shouldn't you come to Tokyo if you're healed now? With your mom. I'm sure you'll be surprised when you come next time. It's changed. The new train. The number of railroad tracks alone is increasing significantly. If trains pass, the natural townscape will change, and there will be a revision of the city ward, and when Tokyo is stiff, it will be 26 o'clock. It can be said that there is less than a minute inside. ""","“Let’s hear you talking a bit more optimistically. Didn’t you say you’d take a trip to Tokyo when you were well again?” I asked. “With Mother. You’ll be amazed when you see it next, at how it’s changed. The streetcars, for instance—there are all sorts of new routes now. And once streetcars go into a neighborhood, of course, the whole look of the area changes. And the city divisions were recently revised—there’s not a moment day or night when Tokyo stands still.”","“Please don’t talk like that. Remember, you are coming to Tokyo to enjoy yourself when you are better. And mother is coming with you. You will really be amazed to see how much Tokyo has changed since your last visit. For example, the tram lines have become numerous, and you know how they affect the appearance of streets. There’s been a rearrangement of the boroughs too. Why, one can say that in Tokyo today, there’s not a moment of quiet, day or night.”"
「何ですか」,"""what is it""",“What is it?”,"“Yes, what is it?”"
三人は日本橋にほんばしへ行って買いたいものを買いました。買う間にも色々気が変るので、思ったより暇ひまがかかりました。奥さんはわざわざ私の名を呼んでどうだろうと相談をするのです。時々反物たんものをお嬢さんの肩から胸へ竪たてに宛あてておいて、私に二、三歩遠退とおのいて見てくれろというのです。私はそのたびごとに、それは駄目だめだとか、それはよく似合うとか、とにかく一人前の口を聞きました。,"The three went to Nihonbashi and bought what they wanted to buy. I changed my mind while I bought it, so it took me more time than I expected. My wife bothered to call my name and talk to me about it. From time to time, I asked her to put a piece of cloth from her shoulders to her chest and ask me to take a few steps away. Every time I heard that it wasn't good, that it looked good, and that it was a full-fledged person.","We went to Nihonbashi and bought all we wanted. The process involved a lot of dithering over choices, so it took longer than anticipated. Okusan made a point of constantly calling me over to ask my opinion. From time to time she hung a piece of fabric over Ojōsan’s shoulder and asked me to step back a few paces and see what I thought. I always managed to respond convincingly, declaring that this worked or that did not.","The three of us went to a shop in Nihonbashi and bought what we wanted. It was difficult to decide what to buy, and we spent more time there than I had expected. Okusan insisted on my giving an opinion on everything that was shown to us. She would drape a piece of cloth on Ojosan’s shoulder, then ask me to step back a few paces, and say: “Well, how do you like it?” I tried to play my part properly, and never failed to give some kind of opinion. “I don’t think that looks very good,” I would say; or “Yes, that would suit her very well.”"
「碁ごだと盤が高過ぎる上に、足が着いているから、炬燵の上では打てないが、そこへ来ると将碁盤は好いいね、こうして楽に差せるから。無精者には持って来いだ。もう一番やろう」,"""If you go to Go, the board is too high and your feet are on it, so you can't hit it on the kotatsu, but when you come there, the Go board is nice, so you can easily insert it. Come on. Let's do the best. ""","“A go board is too high,” my father remarked, “and it has those legs, so you can’t put it on the table and play in comfort around the kotatsu the way you can with shōgi. This is a fine game for the indolent. How about another round, eh?”","“One good thing about chess is that we can play it in this comfortable position,” my father once said. “It’s an ideal game for lazy people like us. The trouble with go3 is that the board is too high—and it has legs too—and we couldn’t very well put it between us on the foot warmer and play on it . . . How about another game of chess?”"
先生は笑い出した。あたかも時機じきの過ぎた今、もう熱心に説明する張合いがないといった風ふうに。,The teacher started laughing. It's as if the time has passed and there is no more enthusiastic explanation.,"Sensei burst into laughter. Now that his original impulse had flagged, he seemed to have no interest in providing me with a serious explanation.","Sensei began to laugh, as if he no longer wished to discuss the matter seriously."
「お前ここへ帰って来て、宅うちの事を監理する気がないか」と兄が私を顧みた。私は何とも答えなかった。,"""Are you willing to come back here and supervise your house?"" My brother looked back at me. I didn't answer anything.",My brother looked at me over his shoulder. “Would you like to come back home and manage the place?” I could make no reply.,"“Do you think you can settle down here, and take over the house?” he said. I said nothing."
三十一,31,CHAPTER 85,I remember that I used constantly the word “human” in defending my position and in attacking his.
「Ｋの手紙を見た養父は大変怒りました。親を騙だますような不埒ふらちなものに学資を送る事はできないという厳しい返事をすぐ寄こしたのです。Ｋはそれを私わたくしに見せました。Ｋはまたそれと前後して実家から受け取った書翰しょかんも見せました。これにも前に劣らないほど厳しい詰責きっせきの言葉がありました。養家先ようかさきへ対して済まないという義理が加わっているからでもありましょうが、こっちでも一切いっさい構わないと書いてありました。Ｋがこの事件のために復籍してしまうか、それとも他たに妥協の道を講じて、依然養家に留とどまるか、そこはこれから起る問題として、差し当りどうかしなければならないのは、月々に必要な学資でした。,"""The adoptive father was very angry when he saw K's letter. He immediately sent me a harsh reply that he couldn't send school money to something that was deceptive to his parents. Around that time, K also showed the letter he received from his parents' house. There were words of blame that were as harsh as before. It may be because of the added in-law that I'm sorry, but it was written that I don't mind at all here. Whether to stay in Japan or not, as a problem that will arise in the future, what we have to deal with for the time being is the necessary academic resources every month.","His adoptive father was enraged when he read K’s letter and immediately sent off a forceful reply to the effect that he could not finance the education of a scoundrel who had so deceived his parents. K showed me the letter. He then showed me the one he had received from his own family, which condemned him in equally strong terms. No doubt an added sense of failed obligation to the other family reinforced their decision to refuse to support him. K was faced with the dilemma of whether to return to his own family or consent to compromise with his adoptive parents to stay on their family register. His immediate problem, however, was how to come up with the money he needed to stay at college.","K’s foster father was furious when he read K’s letter. He sent back a severe reply, in which he said that he could not possibly finance the education of one so unprincipled as to cheat his parents. K showed the letter to me. He also showed me another letter that arrived about the same time as the first. It was from his original family. It was a letter of reprimand as severe in tone as the other. Perhaps the severity was due to his family’s sense of obligation to those that had adopted K. At any rate, K was told that for anyone to worry about him would be a waste of time. Whether he should return to his original family because of the unhappy incident, or whether he should consider some way of compromise and remain with his adopted family, was a problem for the future, but what required his immediate attention was the question of how he was to pay for his education. I asked K whether he had any definite ideas about the matter."

私は兄といっしょの蚊帳かやの中に寝た。妹いもとの夫だけは、客扱いを受けているせいか、独り離れた座敷に入いって休んだ。,"I slept in a mosquito net with my brother. Only my younger sister, my husband, took a rest in a separate tatami room, probably because he was treated as a guest.","I shared a bed under a mosquito net with my brother, while my sister’s husband, who was treated more as a guest, slept alone in a separate room.","My brother and I slept under the same mosquito net.

私は筆を執とって友達のだれかれに短い端書はがきまたは長い手紙を書いた。その友達のあるものは東京に残っていた。あるものは遠い故郷に帰っていた。返事の来るのも、音信たよりの届かないのもあった。私は固もとより先生を忘れなかった。原稿紙へ細字さいじで三枚ばかり国へ帰ってから以後の自分というようなものを題目にして書き綴つづったのを送る事にした。私はそれを封じる時、先生ははたしてまだ東京にいるだろうかと疑うたぐった。先生が奥さんといっしょに宅うちを空あける場合には、五十恰好がっこうの切下きりさげの女の人がどこからか来て、留守番をするのが例になっていた。私がかつて先生にあの人は何ですかと尋ねたら、先生は何と見えますかと聞き返した。私はその人を先生の親類と思い違えていた。先生は「私には親類はありませんよ」と答えた。先生の郷里にいる続きあいの人々と、先生は一向いっこう音信の取とり遣やりをしていなかった。私の疑問にしたその留守番の女の人は、先生とは縁のない奥さんの方の親戚しんせきであった。私は先生に郵便を出す時、ふと幅の細い帯を楽に後ろで結んでいるその人の姿を思い出した。もし先生夫婦がどこかへ避暑にでも行ったあとへこの郵便が届いたら、あの切下のお婆ばあさんは、それをすぐ転地先へ送ってくれるだけの気転と親切があるだろうかなどと考えた。そのくせその手紙のうちにはこれというほどの必要の事も書いてないのを、私は能よく承知していた。ただ私は淋さびしかった。そうして先生から返事の来るのを予期してかかった。しかしその返事はついに来なかった。,"I took the brush and wrote a short postcard or a long letter to any of my friends. Some of the friends remained in Tokyo. Some have returned to their distant hometowns. There were times when I received a reply, and there were times when I didn't receive the message. I never forgot my teacher. After returning to the country with only three small prints on the manuscript paper, I decided to send the spelling and spelling on the subject of something like myself. When I sealed it, I wondered if the teacher was still in Tokyo. When the teacher vacated the house with his wife, it was an example that a woman with a 50-year-old cuckoo came from somewhere and took an answering machine. When I once asked the teacher what he was, he asked me what he looked like. I misunderstood the person as a relative of the teacher. The teacher replied, ""I have no relatives."" The teacher did not exchange messages with the people in his hometown. The woman in the answering machine that I wondered was a relative of her wife who had nothing to do with the teacher. When I sent the mail to the teacher, I suddenly remembered the person who was comfortably tying a narrow belt behind him. If this mail arrives after the teacher and his wife have gone to somewhere to avoid the heat, I wondered if the old lady under the sword would have the temper and kindness to send it to the destination immediately. rice field. I knew well that the letter didn't say anything so necessary. But I was lonely. Then I expected a reply from the teacher. But the reply didn't come at last.","Abandoning reading for my writing brush, I wrote brief post-cards or long letters to various friends. Some had stayed on in Tokyo, while others had returned to distant homes. Some replied; from others I heard nothing. Needless to say , I did not neglect Sensei—I sent him three closely written pages describing all that had happened since my return. As I sealed the envelope, I wondered whether he was still in Tokyo. Customarily, whenever Sensei and his wife went away, a woman in her fifties with a plain widow’s haircut came and looked after the house. I once asked him what relation she was to them, to which he replied, “What do you think?” I had had the mistaken impression that she was a relative of his. “I have no relatives,” he responded, when I told him this. He had absolutely no communication with anyone related to him back in his hometown. The woman who looked after the house turned out to be someone from his wife’s family. As I slipped my letter into the post, an image of this woman, her narrow obi informally knotted at her back, rose unbidden in my mind. If this letter arrived after Sensei and his wife had left for their summer retreat, would she have the good sense and kindness to send it straight on to him? I wondered. I was well aware that the letter did not contain anything of real importance; it was just that I was lonely and anticipating his reply. But nothing came.","I wrote to various friends. Sometimes, I sent short notes written on postcards, and sometimes, long letters. Some of my friends were still in Tokyo, and some had gone home to distant provinces. Some wrote back, and some did not. I did not, of course, forget Sensei. I wrote him a long letter, covering three double pages of foolscap paper with small handwriting, and told him all that had happened to me since my return. As I sealed the envelope, I wondered if Sensei would still be in Tokyo. It was the custom, whenever Sensei and his wife went away, for a lady of about fifty, with her hair cut and let down in the style affected by gentlewomen of her age, to come and look after the house. Once, when I asked Sensei who the lady was, he asked me in turn, “Who do you think she is?” When I said that I took her for some relation of his, he replied, “ But I have no relations.” Indeed, Sensei had come to ignore completely the existence of his family in his home province. The lady, it turned out, was related to Sensei’s wife. I thought of this lady, then, as I went out to post my letter, and I wondered whether she would have the sense and the kindness to forward it, should Sensei and his wife have left by the time it reached Tokyo. I knew, of course, that I had said nothing of importance in the letter. It was simply that I was lonely. I hoped for a reply from him, but it never came."
翌日よくじつになると父は思ったより元気が好よかった。留とめるのも聞かずに歩いて便所へ行ったりした。,My dad was more energetic than I expected the next day. I walked to the toilet without even asking to stop.,"The next day my father was in better shape than expected and insisted on getting up to go to the toilet himself, despite our protests.","The next day he seemed better than we had expected. Taking no notice of our remonstrances, he walked to the bathroom alone."
「どっちが先へ死ぬだろう」,"""Which will die first?""",I pondered the question that had arisen between them then: Which will die first?,"I remembered Sensei saying, “Which of us will die first?”"

私はその間に自分の室の洋燈ランプを点つけました。それから時計を折々見ました。その時の時計ほど埒らちの明あかない遅いものはありませんでした。私の起きた時間は、正確に分らないのですけれども、もう夜明よあけに間まもなかった事だけは明らかです。ぐるぐる廻まわりながら、その夜明を待ち焦こがれた私は、永久に暗い夜が続くのではなかろうかという思いに悩まされました。,"In the meantime, I turned on the lump in my room. Then I looked at the clock from time to time. Nothing was as slow as the clock at that time. I don't know exactly when I woke up, but it's only clear that it wasn't long before dawn. As I circulated around, I longed for the dawn, and I was worried that the dark night would last forever.","At some point I lit my lamp, and from time to time I glanced at the clock. Nothing was more tediously slow than that clock. I had no idea exactly when I had woken, but it was definitely sometime close to daybreak. As I turned and turned in the room, waiting desperately for dawn to come, I was tortured by the sensation that this black night might never end.","I lit the lamp in my room. Time and again, I looked at my watch. How slowly its hands seemed to move that night! I could not be sure exactly when it was that I had been awakened by the draught, but I knew that it had been close to dawn. And so I paced up and down, waiting impatiently for the sun to rise. Sometimes, I almost believed that night had fallen for ever."

私は停車場の壁へ紙片かみぎれを宛あてがって、その上から鉛筆で母と兄あてで手紙を書いた。手紙はごく簡単なものであったが、断らないで走るよりまだ増しだろうと思って、それを急いで宅うちへ届けるように車夫しゃふに頼んだ。そうして思い切った勢いきおいで東京行きの汽車に飛び乗ってしまった。私はごうごう鳴る三等列車の中で、また袂たもとから先生の手紙を出して、ようやく始めからしまいまで眼を通した。,"I addressed a piece of paper to the wall of the stop and wrote a letter from above to my mother and brother with a pencil. The letter was very simple, but I thought it would be more than running without refusing, so I asked the car owner Shafu to hurry and deliver it to my house. Then I jumped on the train bound for Tokyo with a drastic momentum. On the roaring third-class train, I wrote the teacher's letter from the beginning and finally read it from the beginning to the end.","Once there, I penciled a letter to my mother and brother, holding the page against the station wall. It was very brief, but I judged it was better than simply running off without apology or explanation, so I gave it to the rickshaw man and asked him to hurry and deliver it. Then, with the vigor of decision, I leaped onto the Tokyo-bound train. Seated in the thundering third-class carriage, I retrieved Sensei’s letter from my sleeve and at last read it from beginning to end. PART III","At the station, I scribbled a hurried note to my mother and brother, and asked the rickshaw man to take it quickly to the house. I thought that it would be better to write even such a note than to leave without any word at all. Thus, in a desperate desire to act, I boarded the Tokyo-bound train. The noise of the engine filled my ears as I sat down in a third-class carriage. At last, I was able to read Sensei’s letter from beginning to end. * * * 1"

役に立たない手紙を何通書こうと、それが母の慰安になるなら、手数を厭いとうような私ではなかった。けれどもこういう用件で先生にせまるのは私の苦痛であった。私は父に叱しかられたり、母の機嫌を損じたりするよりも、先生から見下げられるのを遥はるかに恐れていた。あの依頼に対して今まで返事の貰もらえないのも、あるいはそうした訳からじゃないかしらという邪推もあった。,"No matter how many useless letters I wrote, if it was my mother's comfort, I wasn't willing to take the trouble. However, it was my pain to blame the teacher for such a matter. I was far more afraid of being looked down upon by my teacher than being scolded by my father or upset by my mother. There was also a misconception that I couldn't get a reply to that request, or maybe it was because of that.","I was not inclined to begrudge the effort of writing any number of useless letters if it would comfort my mother, but having to press Sensei on this matter was painful. I dreaded earning his scorn far more than being scolded by my father or hurting my mother. I already suspected that his lack of response to my previous letter bespoke precisely that reaction from him.","I was not the sort to begrudge my mother the little comfort that the writing of useless letters, no matter how many, might give her. It was nevertheless painful for me to write to Sensei about such a matter. I feared Sensei’s contempt far more than my father’s anger or my mother’s displeasure. I was indeed inclined to suspect that Sensei’s silence was due to his contempt for my request."
午食ひるめしの時、Ｋと私は向い合せに席を占めました。下女げじょに給仕をしてもらって、私はいつにない不味まずい飯めしを済ませました。二人は食事中もほとんど口を利ききませんでした。奥さんとお嬢さんはいつ帰るのだか分りませんでした。,"At lunchtime, K and I occupied the seats facing each other. Having my maiden serve me, I finished the unprecedented unpleasant meal. The two were barely talkative during the meal. The wife and daughter didn't know when they would be back.","At lunch K and I faced each other across the table. Served by the maid, we ate what seemed to me an unusually tasteless meal. We spoke barely a word during the meal. We had no idea when Okusan and Ojōsan would return.",At lunch we faced each other across the table. The maid waited on us. It seemed to me that the food was unusually tasteless. K and I hardly spoke to each other all through the meal. We had no idea when Okusan and Ojosan would return.
「その頃ころは覚醒かくせいとか新しい生活とかいう文字もんじのまだない時分でした。しかしＫが古い自分をさらりと投げ出して、一意いちいに新しい方角へ走り出さなかったのは、現代人の考えが彼に欠けていたからではないのです。彼には投げ出す事のできないほど尊たっとい過去があったからです。彼はそのために今日こんにちまで生きて来たといってもいいくらいなのです。だからＫが一直線に愛の目的物に向って猛進しないといって、決してその愛の生温なまぬるい事を証拠立てる訳にはゆきません。いくら熾烈しれつな感情が燃えていても、彼はむやみに動けないのです。前後を忘れるほどの衝動が起る機会を彼に与えない以上、Ｋはどうしてもちょっと踏み留とどまって自分の過去を振り返らなければならなかったのです。そうすると過去が指し示す路みちを今まで通り歩かなければならなくなるのです。その上彼には現代人のもたない強情ごうじょうと我慢がありました。私はこの双方の点においてよく彼の心を見抜いていたつもりなのです。,"""At that time, it was a time when there was no such thing as awakening or a new life. However, it is the idea of modern people that K threw away his old self and did not run in a unique new direction. Not because he was lacking, but because he had a worthy past that he couldn't throw out. That's why he's lived to this day today, so K Just because he doesn't rush towards the object of love in a straight line, he can never prove the warm lukewarmness of that love. No. As long as he didn't give him the opportunity to forget about the front and back, K had to stay a little and look back on his past. Besides, he had the stubbornness and patience of modern people. I would have seen his heart well in both respects.","These were the days before “the new awakening” or “the new way of life,” as modern slogans have it. But if K failed to toss away his old self and throw himself into becoming a new man, it was not for want of such concepts. Rather, it was because he could not bear to reject a self and a past that had been so noble and exalted. One might even say that it had been his reason for living. So his failure to rush headlong in pursuit of love must not be read as proof that his love was lukewarm. No matter how fierce was the passion that gripped him, the fact is he was paralyzed, transfixed by the contemplation of his own past. Only something so momentous as to drive from his consciousness all thoughts of before and after could have propelled him forward. And with his eyes fixed on the past, he had no choice but to continue along its trajectory. Also, there was in K a kind of obduracy and power of endurance lacking in modern men. In this respect I was confident that I knew him well.","In those days, such phrases as “the age of awakening” and “the new life” had not yet come into fashion. But you must not think that K’s inability to discard his old ways and begin his life anew was due to his lack of modern concepts. You must understand that to K, his own past seemed too sacred a thing to be thrown away like an old suit of clothes. One might say that his past was his life, and to deny it would have meant that his life thus far had been without purpose. That K was hesitant in love does not mean that his love was in any sense lukewarm. He was unable to move, despite the violence of his emotion. And since the impact of his new emotion was not so great as to allow him to forget himself, he was forced to look back, and remind himself of what his past had meant. And in doing so, he could not but continue along the path that he had so far followed. Moreover, he had the kind of stubbornness and forbearance that is unknown these days. I think that thus far, I understood K’s reaction to his own predicament well enough."
私は看護婦を相手に、父の水枕みずまくらを取り更かえて、それから新しい氷を入れた氷囊ひょうのうを頭の上へ載のせた。がさがさに割られて尖とがり切った氷の破片が、囊ふくろの中で落ちつく間、私は父の禿はげ上った額の外はずれでそれを柔らかに抑おさえていた。その時兄が廊下伝ろうかづたいにはいって来て、一通の郵便を無言のまま私の手に渡した。空あいた方の左手を出して、その郵便を受け取った私はすぐ不審を起した。,"I replaced my father's water pillow, Mizumakura, with the nurse, and then put an ice cube with fresh ice on my head. I softly suppressed it with the outskirts of my father's bald forehead, while the shards of ice that had been cracked and sharpened by the sword settled in the baldness. At that time, my brother came into the hallway and handed me a mail silently. I put out my left hand and received the mail, and immediately raised a suspicion.","The nurse and I changed his water pillow, then laid a fresh ice pack on his head, pressing it gently to the bald area above his forehead, until the sharp little fragments of chopped ice inside the bag settled with a harsh rustle. Just then my brother came in from the corridor and silently handed me a postal item. My right hand on the ice pack, I took it with my left, and as my hand received the weight, I registered puzzled surprise.","With the help of the nurse, I renewed the water in the rubber pillow, and placed a bag of newly crushed ice on his forehead. I placed it gently, so that the sharp points of the ice would not hurt him. At that moment, my brother came into the room from the corridor, and without saying a word, handed me a letter. Much intrigued, I took the letter with my free hand."

ある時私は先生の宅うちで酒を飲まされた。その時奥さんが出て来て傍そばで酌しゃくをしてくれた。先生はいつもより愉快そうに見えた。奥さんに「お前も一つお上がり」といって、自分の呑のみ干した盃さかずきを差した。奥さんは「私は……」と辞退しかけた後あと、迷惑そうにそれを受け取った。奥さんは綺麗きれいな眉まゆを寄せて、私の半分ばかり注ついで上げた盃を、唇の先へ持って行った。奥さんと先生の間に下しものような会話が始まった。,"At one point I was drunk at the teacher's house. At that time, my wife came out and gave me a drink by my side. The teacher looked more entertaining than usual. He said to his wife, ""You're up one too,"" and put in a sake cup that was dried only for his own drink. After declining ""I am ..."", his wife received it annoyingly. His wife brought a beautiful eyebrow eyebrow and brought the cup that I poured half of me to the tip of my lips. A conversation has begun between his wife and the teacher.","One day when I visited, I was given sake. His wife emerged to serve it to me. Sensei was more jovial than usual. “You must have a cup too,” he pressed her, offering the little sake cup from which he had drunk. “Oh no, I . . . ,” she began, then rather unwillingly accepted the cup. I half-filled it for her, and she lifted it to her lips, a pretty frown creasing her forehead. The following conversation then took place between them.","One evening, I was invited by Sensei to join him in a cup of saké. Sensei’s wife came to serve us. Sensei seemed more cheerful than usual. Offering his empty cup, he said to his wife, “You have some too.” “No, I don’t really . . . ,” she began to say, then accepted the cup somewhat unwillingly. Frowning slightly, she raised to her lips the cup that I had half-filled for her. A conversation then followed between her and Sensei."

それから中なか二日おいてちょうど三日目の午後だったと思う。先生と掛茶屋かけぢゃやで出会った時、先生は突然私に向かって、「君はまだ大分だいぶ長くここにいるつもりですか」と聞いた。考えのない私はこういう問いに答えるだけの用意を頭の中に蓄えていなかった。それで「どうだか分りません」と答えた。しかしにやにや笑っている先生の顔を見た時、私は急に極きまりが悪くなった。「先生は？」と聞き返さずにはいられなかった。これが私の口を出た先生という言葉の始まりである。,"I think it was just the afternoon of the third day, two days later. When I met my teacher at Kakechaya Kakejaya, he suddenly asked me, ""Are you still going to stay here for a long time?"" Without thinking, I wasn't prepared to answer these questions in my head. So I answered, ""I don't know."" But when I saw the teacher's grinning face, I suddenly got sick. I couldn't help but ask, ""What about the teacher?"" This is the beginning of the word teacher who came out of my mouth.","On the afternoon of the third day since our swim, he suddenly turned to me when we met at the stall. “Are you planning to stay here a while longer?” he asked.

But the grin on Sensei’s face made me suddenly awkward, and I found myself asking, “What about you, Sensei?” This was when I first began to call him by that name.","It was, I think, on the afternoon of the third day following our swim together that Sensei, when we met at the tea house, suddenly asked me, “Do you intend to stay in Kamakura long?” I had really no idea how much longer I would be in Kamakura, so I said, “I don’t know.” I then saw that Sensei was grinning, and I suddenly became embarrassed. I could not help blurting out, “And you, Sensei?” It was then that I began to call him “Sensei.”"
私はたった一人山へ行って、父母の墓の前に跪ひざまずきました。半なかばは哀悼あいとうの意味、半は感謝の心持で跪いたのです。そうして私の未来の幸福が、この冷たい石の下に横たわる彼らの手にまだ握られてでもいるような気分で、私の運命を守るべく彼らに祈りました。あなたは笑うかもしれない。私も笑われても仕方がないと思います。しかし私はそうした人間だったのです。,"I went to the mountain alone and knelt in front of my parents' grave.

先生の宅うちへ帰るには私の下宿のつい傍そばを通るのが順路であった。私はそこまで来て、曲り角で分れるのが先生に済まないような気がした。「ついでにお宅たくの前までお伴ともしましょうか」といった。先生は忽たちまち手で私を遮さえぎった。,"The route to get back to my teacher's house was to pass by the side of my boarding house. I came to that point and felt like the teacher wasn't satisfied with the corners. ""Would you like to accompany me before you go home?""

十五,Fifteen,CHAPTER 51,"“Who is this ‘Sensei,’ that I keep hearing about?” asked my brother."
私の疑惑はまだその上にもあった。先生の人間に対するこの覚悟はどこから来るのだろうか。ただ冷たい眼で自分を内省したり現代を観察したりした結果なのだろうか。先生は坐すわって考える質たちの人であった。先生の頭さえあれば、こういう態度は坐って世の中を考えていても自然と出て来るものだろうか。私にはそうばかりとは思えなかった。先生の覚悟は生きた覚悟らしかった。火に焼けて冷却し切った石造せきぞう家屋の輪廓りんかくとは違っていた。私の眼に映ずる先生はたしかに思想家であった。けれどもその思想家の纏まとめ上げた主義の裏には、強い事実が織り込まれているらしかった。自分と切り離された他人の事実でなくって、自分自身が痛切に味わった事実、血が熱くなったり脈が止まったりするほどの事実が、畳み込まれているらしかった。,"My suspicions were still on top of that. Where does the teacher's determination for humans come from? Is it just the result of introspecting myself or observing the present age with cold eyes? The teacher was a person of quality who sat down and thought. With the teacher's head, does this kind of attitude come out naturally even if you sit down and think about the world? I didn't think so. The teacher's resolution was alive. It was different from the stone elephant house, which was burnt to the fire and cooled down. The teacher in my eyes was certainly a thinker. However, it seemed that strong facts were woven into the back of the principle that the thinker put together. It seemed that the facts that he had tasted painfully, the facts that his blood became hot and his pulse stopped, were convoluted, not the facts of others who were separated from himself.","Another question disturbed me too. What, I wondered, lay behind Sensei’s deep distrust of humanity? Had he arrived at it simply by observing his own heart and the contemporary world around him with a cool, dispassionate eye? He was by nature inclined to sit and ponder things, and a mind such as his perhaps naturally reached such conclusions. But I did not think that that was all there was to it. His conviction struck me as more than just a lifeless theory, or the cold ruins from some long-dead fire. Sensei was indeed a philosopher, it seemed to me, but a potent reality seemed woven into the fabric of his philosophy. Nor was his thinking grounded in anything remote from himself, observed only in others. No, behind his convictions lay some keenly felt personal experience, something great enough to heat his blood, and to halt his heart.","I rarely saw her away from Sensei: besides, in my presence, her behavior was always that of the conventional hostess. I wondered also why Sensei felt the way he did towards mankind. Was it, I would ask myself, the result of a coldly impartial scrutiny of his own inner self and the contemporary world around him? And if one were as naturally reflective, intelligent, and as removed from the world as Sensei, would one inevitably reach the same conclusions? Such tentative explanations, however, which suggested themselves to my mind, did not completely satisfy me. Sensei’s opinions, it seemed to me, were not merely the result of cloistered reflection. They were not, as it were, like the skeleton of a stone house, which has been gutted by fire. They were more alive than that. True, Sensei, as I saw him, was primarily a thinker. But his thoughts, I felt, were based firmly on a strong sense of reality. And this sense of reality did not come so much from observation of the experience of others removed from himself, as from his own experience."
お嬢さんの部屋へやは茶の間と続いた六畳でした。奥さんはその茶の間にいる事もあるし、またお嬢さんの部屋にいる事もありました。つまりこの二つの部屋は仕切しきりがあっても、ないと同じ事で、親子二人が往いったり来たりして、どっち付かずに占領していたのです。私が外から声を掛けると、「おはいんなさい」と答えるのはきっと奥さんでした。お嬢さんはそこにいても滅多めったに返事をした事がありませんでした。,"The room of the young lady was a six tatami mat that continued to the living room. Sometimes my wife was in the living room, and sometimes she was in her daughter's room.

When I called out from the outside, it was probably my wife who answered ""Good morning"". The young lady rarely replied even when she was there.","Ojōsan occupied a six-mat room beyond the sitting room. Okusan was sometimes in the sitting room, sometimes in her daughter’s. Neither had a room she considered exclusively her own. Despite the partition between them, the two rooms formed a single space, with mother and daughter moving freely between them. When I stood outside and called, it was always Okusan who answered, “Come on in.” Even if Ojōsan happened to be there as well, she rarely responded herself.","Ojosan’s was a six-mat room next to the morning room.

私がＫに向って新しい住居すまいの心持はどうだと聞いた時に、彼はただ一言いちげん悪くないといっただけでした。私からいわせれば悪くないどころではないのです。彼の今までいた所は北向きの湿っぽい臭においのする汚い室へやでした。食物くいものも室相応そうおうに粗末でした。私の家へ引き移った彼は、幽谷ゆうこくから喬木きょうぼくに移った趣があったくらいです。それをさほどに思う気色けしきを見せないのは、一つは彼の強情から来ているのですが、一つは彼の主張からも出ているのです。仏教の教義で養われた彼は、衣食住についてとかくの贅沢ぜいたくをいうのをあたかも不道徳のように考えていました。なまじい昔の高僧だとか聖徒セーントだとかの伝でんを読んだ彼には、ややともすると精神と肉体とを切り離したがる癖がありました。肉を鞭撻べんたつすれば霊の光輝が増すように感ずる場合さえあったのかも知れません。,"When I asked K how he felt about his new home, he just said it wasn't bad. From my point of view, it's not bad. Where he used to be was a dirty room with a damp, north-facing odor. The food was poor as it was in the room. He moved to my house and had the taste of moving from Yukoku Yukiya to Kyoko Takagi. One of the reasons why he doesn't seem to think so much is his stubbornness, but one is also his claim. Fostered by Buddhist doctrine, he thought of the luxury of clothing, food and shelter as if it were immoral. He had a habit of wanting to separate his mind and body from his old high priests and saints Saints. You might even feel that the brilliance of the spirits would increase if you whipped the flesh.","When I asked what he thought of his new home, he replied with a simple “Not bad.” This brief response was a wild understatement, I felt. Until then he had been living in a dank, grimy little north-facing room, where the food was of a piece with the lodging. The move to my place was, as the old saying goes, “from deep ravine to treetop high.” It was partly sheer obstinacy that caused him to make light of the new place, but partly principle as well. His Buddhist upbringing had led him to think that paying attention to comfort in the basic needs of life was immoral. Brought up on tales of worthy monks and saints, he tended to consider flesh and spirit as separate entities; in fact, he may well have felt that to mortify the flesh was to exalt the soul.","When I asked K what he thought of his new home, all he said was: “Not bad.” His answer struck me as being somewhat incongruous, considering that he had been living, until then, in a squalid, damp room which faced the north. His food had been in keeping with his room. As far as I was concerned, he had been raised from the bottom of a dark valley to the top of a sunlit mountain. No doubt his stubbornness was partly responsible for his apparent indifference towards the change; but I am sure also that he was being indifferent on principle. Having grown up under the influence of Buddhist doctrines, he seemed to regard respect for material comfort as some kind of immorality. Also, having read stories of great priests and Christian saints who were long since dead, he was wont to regard the body and the soul as entities which had to be forced asunder. Indeed, he seemed at times to think that mistreatment of the body was necessary for the glorification of the soul."

If you're a property owner, you can build a bigger house.""","“Well, I have a certain amount of money. But I’m far from wealthy. If I were, I’d build a larger house.”","“I have some money, of course. But I am by no means rich. If if I were, I would build myself a larger house for one thing.”"
九,Nine,CHAPTER 63,"In short, my uncle cheated me of my inheritance."
私はただ人間の罪というものを深く感じたのです。その感じが私をＫの墓へ毎月まいげつ行かせます。その感じが私に妻の母の看護をさせます。そうしてその感じが妻に優しくしてやれと私に命じます。私はその感じのために、知らない路傍ろぼうの人から鞭むちうたれたいとまで思った事もあります、こうした階段を段々経過して行くうちに、人に鞭うたれるよりも、自分で自分を鞭うつべきだという気になります。自分で自分を鞭うつよりも、自分で自分を殺すべきだという考えが起ります。私は仕方がないから、死んだ気で生きて行こうと決心しました。,"I just felt deeply about human sin. That feeling makes me go to K's grave every month. That feeling makes me care for my wife's mother. Then that feeling tells me to be kind to my wife. Because of that feeling, I've even wanted to be whipped by strangers by the side of the road, rather than being whipped by someone as I walked through these stairs. I feel like I should whip. The idea arises that you should kill yourself rather than whip yourself. I couldn't help it, so I decided to live with a feeling of death.","What this feeling produced was, quite simply, a keen awareness of the nature of human sin. That is what sent me back each month to K’s grave. It is also what lay behind the nursing of my dying mother-in-law, and what bade me treat my wife so tenderly. There were even times when I longed for some stranger to come along and flog me as I deserved. At some stage this feeling transformed into a conviction that it should be I who hurt myself. And then the thought struck me that I should not just hurt myself but kill myself. At all events, I resolved that I must live my life as if I were already dead.","I felt very strongly the sinfulness of man. It was this feeling that sent me to K’s grave every month, that made me take care of my mother-in-law in her illness and behave gently towards my wife. It was this sense of sin that led me to feel sometimes that I would welcome a flogging even at the hands of strangers. When this desire for punishment became particularly strong, I would begin to feel that it should come from myself and not others. Then I would think of death. Killing myself seemed a just punishment for my sins. Finally, I decided to go on living as if I were dead."
「私は先刻さっきそんなに昂奮したように見えたんですか」,"""Did I look so excited a while ago?""",“Did I really seem so very excited back there?”,“Did I seem so excited to you back there in the nursery?”
「また悪い事をいった。焦慮じらせるのが悪いと思って、説明しようとすると、その説明がまたあなたを焦慮せるような結果になる。どうも仕方がない。この問題はこれで止やめましょう。とにかく恋は罪悪ですよ、よござんすか。そうして神聖なものですよ」,"""I said something bad again. If you think it's bad to be guilty and try to explain it, the explanation will be guilty again. It can't be helped. This problem is stopped. Let's do it. Love is guilty anyway, isn't it? It's sacred. ""","“I’ve said something wrong again,” he said contritely. “I planned to explain, because it was wrong of me to upset you like that, but my attempt at explanation has only irritated you further. It’s no use. Let’s drop the subject. Just remember that love is a sin. And it is also sacred.”","“I have said the wrong thing again. I was trying to explain my earlier remarks because I thought they had irritated you. But in trying to explain, I find that I have upset you once more. Let us forget the whole matter. But remember, there is guilt in loving. And remember too, that in loving, there is something sacred.”"
「どんな事ですか」,"""What is it?""",. .” “What is it?”,“Won’t you tell me?”
妻の母は時々気拙きまずい事を妻にいうようでした。それを妻は私に隠していました。しかし自分は自分で、単独に私を責めなければ気が済まなかったらしいのです。責めるといっても、決して強い言葉ではありません。妻から何かいわれたために、私が激した例ためしはほとんどなかったくらいですから。妻はたびたびどこが気に入らないのか遠慮なくいってくれと頼みました。それから私の未来のために酒を止やめろと忠告しました。ある時は泣いて「あなたはこの頃ごろ人間が違った」といいました。それだけならまだいいのですけれども、「Ｋさんが生きていたら、あなたもそんなにはならなかったでしょう」というのです。私はそうかも知れないと答えた事がありましたが、私の答えた意味と、妻の了解した意味とは全く違っていたのですから、私は心のうちで悲しかったのです。それでも私は妻に何事も説明する気にはなれませんでした。,"My wife's mother sometimes seemed to tell her that she was awkward. My wife hid it from me. However, it seems that he had to blame me alone for himself. Blame is not a strong word. Because my wife told me something, I rarely tried it. My wife often asked me to feel free to tell me what I didn't like. Then I advised him to stop drinking for my future. At one point I cried and said, ""You are different these days."" That's fine, but he said, ""If Mr. K was alive, you wouldn't have been that way either."" I once replied that it might be, but I was sad in my heart because the meaning I answered was completely different from what my wife understood. Still, I didn't feel like explaining anything to my wife.","I gathered that my wife’s mother sometimes said some rather unpleasant things about me to her, although she never passed them on to me. My wife could not resist being critical herself, however. She never spoke strongly, of course, and I very rarely became provoked to the point where I lost my temper. She would simply ask me from time to time to tell her honestly if there was something about her that bothered me. “Stop drinking,” she would say, “you’ll ruin yourself.” Sometimes she wept and declared, “You’ve become a changed person.” But worst of all was when she added, “You wouldn’t have changed like this if K were still alive.” I agreed that that might well be true, but I was filled with sorrow at the gulf that lay between our separate understandings of this remark. And yet I still felt no urge to explain everything to her.","It would seem that my mother-in-law sometimes complained about me to my wife. My wife never told me what her mother had said. But she reproached me on her own account. I suppose she could not bear to watch me live as I did without saying something. I say that she “reproached” me, but I assure you that she never used strong words. She hardly ever gave me cause to be angry with her. She asked me more than once if she was not in some way responsible for my behavior; she wanted to be told what her faults were. Sometimes, she begged me to stop drinking for the sake of my own future. Once, she cried and said: “You have changed.” The words that followed hurt much more: “You would not have changed so, had K-san been alive.” “Perhaps you are right,” I answered. Secretly, I grieved for my wife, who did not know how right she had been."
十時頃になって、Ｋは不意に仕切りの襖ふすまを開けて私と顔を見合みあわせました。彼は敷居の上に立ったまま、私に何を考えていると聞きました。私はもとより何も考えていなかったのです。もし考えていたとすれば、いつもの通りお嬢さんが問題だったかも知れません。そのお嬢さんには無論奥さんも食っ付いていますが、近頃ではＫ自身が切り離すべからざる人のように、私の頭の中をぐるぐる回めぐって、この問題を複雑にしているのです。Ｋと顔を見合せた私は、今まで朧気おぼろげに彼を一種の邪魔ものの如く意識していながら、明らかにそうと答える訳にいかなかったのです。私は依然として彼の顔を見て黙っていました。するとＫの方からつかつかと私の座敷へ入って来て、私のあたっている火鉢の前に坐すわりました。私はすぐ両肱りょうひじを火鉢の縁から取り除のけて、心持それをＫの方へ押しやるようにしました。,"Around 10 o'clock, K suddenly opened the fusuma bran of the partition and saw me face to face. He stood on the threshold and asked me what he was thinking. I wasn't thinking about anything. If you were thinking, your daughter might have been the problem as usual. Of course, the young lady also has a wife, but these days, like K himself, who is inseparable, he circulates around in my head, complicating this problem. When I saw K face to face, I couldn't answer clearly, even though I was vaguely conscious of him as a kind of obstacle. I was still silent looking at his face. Then K came into my tatami room and sat down in front of my brazier. Immediately I removed both elbows from the edge of the brazier and pushed it towards K.","Around ten o’clock K suddenly opened the doors between our rooms and stood in the doorway. What was I thinking? he asked. I had not really been thinking anything, or if I had, then I was probably mulling over the usual problem of Ojōsan. Okusan was a necessary part of my conundrum, of course, but lately K’s inseparable involvement had complicated it further. He had been vaguely present in my mind as a kind of obstacle, but now that I was face-to-face with him, I couldn’t come out and say so. I simply looked at him silently. K then strode into my room and sat down in front of my brazier. I took my elbows off the edge and pushed the brazier slightly toward him.","At about ten o’clock, the door between our rooms was suddenly opened, and I saw K looking at me from the doorway. “What are you thinking about?” he said. I could not in all honesty say that I was thinking about anything at all. If the confusion in my mind then could have been called “thought,” then I suppose I might have answered: “Ojosan.” And I might have added: “I have been thinking about Okusan too; and, as a matter of fact, about you, who seem recently to have made matters far more complicated than ever for me. Yes, you are a haunting, albeit vague, figure that refuses to leave me alone. I have been thinking of you as a confounded nuisance.” But I could hardly say all this to his face. I continued to look at him in silence. K then strode into the room, and sat down opposite me. I moved my elbows away from the edge of the brazier, and pushed it just a little nearer to him."
私はすぐ下宿へは戻らなかった。国へ帰る前に調ととのえる買物もあったし、ご馳走ちそうを詰めた胃袋にくつろぎを与える必要もあったので、ただ賑にぎやかな町の方へ歩いて行った。町はまだ宵の口であった。用事もなさそうな男女なんにょがぞろぞろ動く中に、私は今日私といっしょに卒業したなにがしに会った。彼は私を無理やりにある酒場バーへ連れ込んだ。私はそこで麦酒ビールの泡のような彼の気燄きえんを聞かされた。私の下宿へ帰ったのは十二時過ぎであった。,"I didn't return to the boarding house right away. Before I returned to the country, I had some shopping, and I needed to give some relaxation to my stomach filled with feasts, so I just walked toward the bustling town. The town was still the mouth of the evening. I met what I graduated with me today while the men and women who seemed to have no business were moving around. He forced me to a bar bar. I was there to hear his burning flames like the froth of beer. It was past twelve o'clock when I returned to my boarding house.","I did not go straight back to my lodgings. There were things I needed to buy before my journey, and besides, I had to ease my belly, which was crammed with fine food, so I set off to walk toward the bustling town. It was still full of the activity of early evening. Men and women were casually thronging the streets. I ran into a friend who had just graduated with me, and he pulled me off to a bar, where I listened to his high-spirited chatter, frothy as the beer we drank. It was past midnight when I finally got home.","I did not return to my lodgings immediately. There were a few things I wanted to buy before going home, and I felt also that I needed a walk after the big dinner I had eaten. I walked towards the busy part of the town. There, the night had only just begun. The streets were crowded with men and women who seemed to have come out for no particular purpose. I ran into a university acquaintance who had also graduated that day. He forced me to go into a bar with him. There, I had to sit and listen to my fellow graduate, whose talk was as frothy as the beer. It was past midnight when I returned to my room."

母はその時の私の言葉を信じていた。その時の私は先生からきっと返事があると母に保証した。しかし父や母の希望するような返事が来るとは、その時の私もまるで期待しなかった。私は心得があって母を欺あざむいたと同じ結果に陥った。,"My mother believed in my words at that time. At that time, I assured my mother that I would get a reply from the teacher. However, at that time, I didn't expect to receive the reply that my father and mother wanted. I had the same result as I knew and deceived my mother.","She had believed me when I assured her there would be a reply. But even when I was writing to him, I had had no expectation that he would send the kind of reply they were hoping for. In effect, I had knowingly deceived her.","she asked. Before sending my letter to Sensei, I had assured her that he would definitely write back, and she had believed me. But even then, I did not think that Sensei would write the kind of reply that my father and mother were expecting. In effect, I had knowingly lied to them."
「あなたは本当に真面目なんですか」と先生が念を押した。「私は過去の因果いんがで、人を疑うたぐりつけている。だから実はあなたも疑っている。しかしどうもあなただけは疑りたくない。あなたは疑るにはあまりに単純すぎるようだ。私は死ぬ前にたった一人で好いいから、他ひとを信用して死にたいと思っている。あなたはそのたった一人になれますか。なってくれますか。あなたははらの底から真面目ですか」,"""Are you really serious?"" Reminded the teacher. ""I'm suspicious of people because of the cause and effect of the past. So you're also suspicious. But you just don't want to be suspicious. You seem too simple to doubt. I die. I want to trust another person and die because I like it alone before. Can you be that one person? Can you be? Are you serious from the bottom of your heart? ""","“Are you truly in earnest?” Sensei asked. “My past experiences have made me suspicious of people, so I must admit I mistrust you too. But you are the sole exception; I have no desire to suspect you. You seem too straightforward and open for that. I want to have trusted even just one person before I die, you know. Can you be that person? Would you do that for me? Are you sincerely in earnest, from your heart?”","“I wonder if you are being really sincere,” he said. “Because of what happened to me, I have come to doubt everybody. In truth, I doubt you too. But for some reason, I do not want to doubt you. It may be because you seem so simple. Before I die, I should like to have one friend that I can truly trust. I wonder if you can be that friend. Are you really sincere?”"
縁台の横から後部へ掛けて植え付けてある杉苗の傍そばに、熊笹くまざさが三坪みつぼほど地を隠すように茂って生えていた。犬はその顔と背を熊笹の上に現わして、盛んに吠え立てた。そこへ十とおぐらいの小供こどもが馳かけて来て犬を叱しかり付けた。小供は徽章きしょうの着いた黒い帽子を被かぶったまま先生の前へ廻まわって礼をした。,"By the side of the cedar seedlings that were planted from the side of the pedestal to the rear, Kuma bamboo grass was growing as thick as Mitsubo Mitsubo, hiding the ground. The dog showed its face and back on the bamboo bamboo and barked vigorously. About ten small children came over and scolded the dog. Kosuke went around in front of the teacher and thanked him, wearing a black hat with an emblem.","Our bench stood at the front corner of a bed of cedar seedlings; to one side of it, a wide stand of thick dwarf bamboo stretched back, hiding the ground. In its midst we could make out the back and furiously barking head of a dog. As we stared, a child of about ten came running over and set about scolding the animal. He then came over to where we sat and bowed to Sensei, without removing his black school cap.","Behind the bench, and next to the cedar saplings, dwarf bamboos grew thickly over a small patch of ground. The dog was looking at us over the bamboos, barking furiously. Then a boy of about ten appeared on the scene. He ran to the dog and scolded it. He then turned around towards Sensei, and without taking off his black schoolboy’s cap, bowed."
肝心かんじんのお嬢さんに、直接この私というものを打ち明ける機会も、長くいっしょにいるうちには時々出て来たのですが、私はわざとそれを避けました。日本の習慣として、そういう事は許されていないのだという自覚が、その頃の私には強くありました。しかし決してそればかりが私を束縛したとはいえません。日本人、ことに日本の若い女は、そんな場合に、相手に気兼きがねなく自分の思った通りを遠慮せずに口にするだけの勇気に乏しいものと私は見込んでいたのです。,"I sometimes had the opportunity to confess this to my daughter, who is important to me, while I was with her for a long time, but I intentionally avoided it. At that time, I was strongly aware that such a thing was not allowed as a Japanese custom. But that's not the only thing that bound me. I expected that Japanese people, especially young Japanese women, wouldn't have the courage to say what they wanted without hesitation. ..","Naturally, during all our long time together there had been occasions when I could have confessed myself directly to Ojōsan and asked for her hand, but I had purposely chosen not to. I was very conscious of the fact that Japanese convention forbade such things, but it was not really this alone that restrained me. I assumed that in such a situation Japanese, and particularly Japanese girls, lacked the courage to be frank and honest, so I could not hope for a candid response from her.","In other words, I was far from lacking high-minded convictions about love; but when I discovered that it necessarily involved some decisive action on my part, I became hesitant, timid, and rather devious. During the long period of time that we lived in the same house, there were of course many opportunities for me to tell Ojosan directly how I felt towards her, but I purposely ignored them. I was then very conscious of the fact—perhaps too much so—that to speak to Ojosan about marriage before I had spoken to Okusan would be a flagrant breach of Japanese custom. On the other hand, it was not this alone that prevented me from confessing my love to Ojosan. I was also afraid that if she did not by any chance want me for a husband, she would not say so outright."
二,two,CHAPTER 2,Sensei had just taken his clothes off and was about to go for a swim when I first laid eyes on him in the tea house.
その日はそれで帰った。帰ってからも父の病気はそれほど苦にならなかった。先生のいった自然に死ぬとか、不自然の暴力で死ぬとかいう言葉も、その場限りの浅い印象を与えただけで、後あとは何らのこだわりを私の頭に残さなかった。私は今まで幾度いくたびか手を着けようとしては手を引っ込めた卒業論文を、いよいよ本式に書き始めなければならないと思い出した。,"That day I went home. Even after I got home, my father's illness didn't bother me so much. The words that the teacher said, such as dying naturally or dying from unnatural violence, gave me a shallow impression, and I didn't leave any particular feelings in my mind. I remembered that I had to finally start writing my graduation thesis, which I had withdrawn from trying to get my hands on several times.","So the conversation ended that day. Even later, after I returned home, my father’s illness did not worry me unduly. Nor did Sensei’s talk of natural and unnatural deaths leave more than a passing, vague impression on my mind. I was preoccupied with another matter, for I finally had to set to and write the graduation thesis that I had tried, so many times, to come to grips with before.","Shortly afterwards, I left Sensei and went home. I did not worry very much about my father’s illness that night, nor did I spend much time thinking back over what Sensei had said about death. I was more concerned with the problem of my graduation thesis, which I had tried to begin many times before but unsuccessfully. I should"
しかし我々は真面目まじめでした。我々は実際偉くなるつもりでいたのです。ことにＫは強かったのです。寺に生れた彼は、常に精進しょうじんという言葉を使いました。そうして彼の行為動作は悉ことごとくこの精進の一語で形容されるように、私には見えたのです。私は心のうちで常にＫを畏敬いけいしていました。,"But we were serious. We were actually going to be great. Especially K was strong. Born in a temple, he always used the word devoted shojin. Then it seemed to me that his actions and actions were all described in one word of this devotion. I was always in awe of K in my heart.","But we were in earnest, and determined one day to become great. K’s willpower was particularly strong. Son of a temple family that he was, he was in the habit of talking in terms of the Buddhist concept of dedicated self-discipline, and his behavior certainly seemed to me to epitomize this ideal. In my heart, I stood in awe of him.","But we were in earnest, and seriously intended to become great men one day. Indeed, K was very earnest. Having been born in a temple, he often spoke of “concentration of mind.” And to me, it seemed that this phrase described completely his daily life. My heart was filled with reverence for K."
「Ｋから聞かされた打ち明け話を、奥さんに伝える気のなかった私は、「いいえ」といってしまった後で、すぐ自分の噓うそを快こころよからず感じました。仕方がないから、別段何も頼まれた覚えはないのだから、Ｋに関する用件ではないのだといい直しました。奥さんは「そうですか」といって、後あとを待っています。私はどうしても切り出さなければならなくなりました。私は突然「奥さん、お嬢さんを私に下さい」といいました。奥さんは私の予期してかかったほど驚いた様子も見せませんでしたが、それでも少時しばらく返事ができなかったものと見えて、黙って私の顔を眺ながめていました。一度いい出した私は、いくら顔を見られても、それに頓着とんじゃくなどはしていられません。「下さい、ぜひ下さい」といいました。「私の妻としてぜひ下さい」といいました。奥さんは年を取っているだけに、私よりもずっと落ち付いていました。「上げてもいいが、あんまり急じゃありませんか」と聞くのです。私が「急に貰もらいたいのだ」とすぐ答えたら笑い出しました。そうして「よく考えたのですか」と念を押すのです。私はいい出したのは突然でも、考えたのは突然でないという訳を強い言葉で説明しました。,"""I wasn't willing to tell my wife the confession I heard from K, and after saying"" no, ""I immediately felt my lie. Since it can't be helped, I don't remember being asked for anything, so I reiterated that it wasn't a matter related to K. His wife said, ""Is that so?"" And is waiting for the rest. I had to cut it out. I suddenly said, ""Please give me your wife and daughter."" The wife didn't look as surprised as I expected, but she still seemed to have been unable to reply for a while and silently stared at my face. Once I got a good start, no matter how much I could see my face, I couldn't care about it. I said, ""Please, please."" ""Please be my wife,"" he said. My wife was much calmer than I was because she was old. He asks, ""It's okay to raise it, but isn't it too steep?"" I laughed as soon as I answered, ""I want you to get it suddenly."" Then, he reminds us, ""Did you think about it?"" I explained in strong words that it was sudden, but not sudden, that I thought about it.","“No,” I replied, having no intention of telling Okusan what K had confessed to me. But the lie immediately made me unhappy. I awkwardly backed away from it by saying that K hadn’t asked me to say anything on his behalf that I could recall, and my present business had nothing to do with him. “I see,” she said, and waited for more. There was nothing for it but to broach the subject at last. “Okusan,” I said abruptly, “I wish to marry Ojōsan.” She took this more calmly than I had anticipated, although she stared at me in silence, apparently at a loss how to respond. But I had gone too far now to let her gaze disconcert me. “Please, Okusan. Please let me marry her,” I said. “Let me make her my wife.” Okusan’s mature years lent her far greater calm than I could muster. “That’s all very well,” she replied, “but isn’t this rather hasty?” “It’s now I want to marry her,” I said, which made her laugh. “Have you thought this through properly?” she went on. I earnestly assured her that although the request was sudden, the impulse behind it was anything but.","I was immediately ashamed of the lie. To ease my conscience, I added: “What I want to say has nothing to do with K. He has not asked me to say anything to you on his behalf.” “Is that so?” she said, and waited. There was nothing left for me to do but come to the point. “Okusan,” I blurted out, “I want to marry Ojosan.” She was not half as surprised as I had expected. She seemed at a loss for an answer, nevertheless, and gazed at me in silence. I had gone too far now to be intimidated by mere silence. “Please,” I said, “let me marry her. I want Ojosan very much.” Okusan, being older, was much calmer than I. “Mind you,” she said, “I am not saying no. But this is all so sudden . . .” “I want to marry her soon,” I said quickly, and she began to laugh. Then she said seriously, “Have you thought about it carefully? Are you sure?” I assured her in no uncertain terms that though my manner of proposing might have seemed hasty, I had had Ojosan in mind for a very long time."
「あなたは私に会ってもおそらくまだ淋さびしい気がどこかでしているでしょう。私にはあなたのためにその淋しさを根元ねもとから引き抜いて上げるだけの力がないんだから。あなたは外ほかの方を向いて今に手を広げなければならなくなります。今に私の宅の方へは足が向かなくなります」,"""You're probably still lonely when you meet me, because I don't have the power to pull that loneliness out of the roots for you. You have to look out and reach out now. Now you can't go to my house. ""","“But even when you’re with me,” he went on, “you probably still feel somehow lonely. I don’t have the strength, you see, to really take on your loneliness and eradicate it for you. In time, you’ll need to reach out toward someone else. Sooner or later your feet will no longer feel inclined to take you here.”","I have not it in me to help you forget it. You will have to look elsewhere for the consolation you seek. And soon, you will find that you no longer want to visit me.”"
私はこの「おれが死んだら」という言葉に一種の記憶をもっていた。東京を立つ時、先生が奥さんに向かって何遍なんべんもそれを繰り返したのは、私が卒業した日の晩の事であった。私は笑わらいを帯びた先生の顔と、縁喜えんぎでもないと耳を塞ふさいだ奥さんの様子とを憶おもい出した。あの時の「おれが死んだら」は単純な仮定であった。今私が聞くのはいつ起るか分らない事実であった。私は先生に対する奥さんの態度を学ぶ事ができなかった。しかし口の先では何とか父を紛らさなければならなかった。,"I had a kind of memory in this word ""if I die"". When I left Tokyo, it was the evening of the day I graduated that the teacher repeated it all the time toward his wife. I remembered the laughing face of the teacher and the appearance of his wife, who closed her ears if she wasn't happy. ""If I die"" at that time was a simple assumption. What I hear now is the fact that I don't know when it will happen. I couldn't learn his wife's attitude towards the teacher. But at the tip of my mouth I had to somehow confuse my father.","His “when I die” evoked a certain memory. That evening after my graduation, when I was preparing to leave Tokyo, Sensei had used this same phrase several times in the conversation with his wife. I remembered Sensei’s smiling face as he spoke, and his wife blocking her ears against the inauspicious words. The words had been merely hypothetical then, but now they rang with the certainty that sometime soon they would be fulfilled. I could not emulate Sensei’s wife’s response, but I did need to find a way of distracting my father from his thoughts.","I was then reminded of that evening at Sensei’s house, just after I had graduated, when Sensei had repeatedly used the phrase “when I die” in his wife’s presence. And I remembered the smile on Sensei’s face as he said it, and how his wife had refused to listen any more, saying, “Please don’t say it again. It’s so unlucky.” Then, death had been simply a matter for speculation. But now, it was something that might soon become a reality. I could not very well imitate Sensei’s wife. But I had to say something to divert my father’s mind from the thought of death."
夕飯ゆうめしの時Ｋと私はまた顔を合せました。何にも知らないＫはただ沈んでいただけで、少しも疑い深い眼を私に向けません。何にも知らない奥さんはいつもより嬉うれしそうでした。私だけがすべてを知っていたのです。私は鉛のような飯を食いました。その時お嬢さんはいつものようにみんなと同じ食卓に並びませんでした。奥さんが催促すると、次の室で只今ただいまと答えるだけでした。それをＫは不思議そうに聞いていました。しまいにどうしたのかと奥さんに尋ねました。奥さんは大方おおかた極きまりが悪いのだろうといって、ちょっと私の顔を見ました。Ｋはなお不思議そうに、なんで極りが悪いのかと追窮ついきゅうしに掛かかりました。奥さんは微笑しながらまた私の顔を見るのです。,"At the time of dinner Yumeshi, K and I met again. K, who knows nothing, just sank and does not turn any suspicious eyes on me. The wife who didn't know anything seemed more happy than usual. Only I knew everything. I ate rice like lead. At that time, the young lady did not line up at the same table as everyone else as usual. When my wife urged me, I just answered that I was right now in the next room. K was listening to it mysteriously. I asked my wife what happened at the end. My wife looked at my face for a moment, saying that it was probably awkward. K still wondered why he was so bad. The wife smiles and looks at my face again.","We saw each other again over the evening meal. Innocent of what had happened, K was merely subdued. He cast no suspicious glance my way. Okusan, of course, understood nothing of how things stood and was markedly cheerful. Only I knew everything. The food was lead in my mouth. Ojōsan did not join us at the table as she usually did. “I won’t be long,” she called from the next room when Okusan urged her to join us. K looked surprised and finally asked Okusan what was wrong. “She’s probably feeling shy,” replied Okusan, sending a glance in my direction. “Why should she?” K persisted, increasingly puzzled. Okusan looked at me again, with a little smile.","I saw him again at dinner. He sat quietly, deep in some melancholy thought. There was not the slightest sign of suspicion in his eyes. How could there be, when he knew nothing of what had happened in his absence? Okusan, ignorant of the truth about us, seemed unusually happy. Only I knew everything. I found difficulty in swallowing my food. It was like lead. Ojosan, whose custom it was to eat with us, did not appear at the table that evening. When Okusan called her, she answered from the next room: “Yes, I’m coming!” K became curious. Finally, he asked Okusan: “What’s the matter with her?” Okusan threw a glance in my direction, and said: “She’s probably embarrassed.” This made K all the more curious. “Why is she embarrassed?” he wanted to know. Okusan merely smiled, and looked at me again."
「気の毒だね」といって、庭の方を向いた。,"He turned to the garden, saying, ""I'm sorry.""","But he must have read what was in my heart, for he said, “That’s a shame for you,” and turned away to face the garden.","“I am sorry,” he said, and turned towards the garden."
それからまだ二つ三つの問答がありましたが、私はそれを忘れてしまいました。男のように判然はきはきしたところのある奥さんは、普通の女と違ってこんな場合には大変心持よく話のできる人でした。「宜よござんす、差し上げましょう」といいました。「差し上げるなんて威張いばった口の利きける境遇ではありません。どうぞ貰って下さい。ご存じの通り父親のない憐あわれな子です」と後あとでは向うから頼みました。,"Then there were still a few questions and answers, but I forgot about them. Unlike a normal woman, her wife, who had a clear impression like a man, was a person who could talk very comfortably in such cases. ""I'm sorry, I'll give it to you,"" he said. ""It's not a dignified and talkative situation to give. Please give me. As you know, he is a merciful child without a father,"" he asked later.","A few more questions followed, which I have forgotten. Okusan had quite a masculine clarity and directness that made her far easier to talk to than the usual woman in this kind of situation. “Very good,” she finally said. “You may have her. Or rather,” she corrected herself, “since I’m not in a position to speak so patronizingly, let me say, ‘Please take her for your wife.’ As you know, the poor girl has no father to give her away.”","There were a few more questions and answers, but I forget what they were. Okusan was an easy person to talk to on such an occasion as this: there was nothing elusive about her. In this respect, she was more like a man than a woman. “All right,” she said finally. “You may have her.” Then she said in a more formal tone, “Of course, it is I who should be doing the asking. Who am I to say, ‘you may have her’? She is, as you know, a wretched, fatherless child.”"
私は折々亡くなった父や母の事を思い出す外ほかに、何の不愉快もなく、その一夏ひとなつを叔父の家族と共に過ごして、また東京へ帰ったのです。ただ一つその夏の出来事として、私の心にむしろ薄暗い影を投げたのは、叔父夫婦が口を揃そろえて、まだ高等学校へ入ったばかりの私に結婚を勧める事でした。それは前後で丁度三、四回も繰り返されたでしょう。私も始めはただその突然なのに驚いただけでした。二度目には判然はっきり断りました。三度目にはこっちからとうとうその理由を反問しなければならなくなりました。彼らの主意は単簡たんかんでした。早く嫁よめを貰もらってここの家へ帰って来て、亡くなった父の後を相続しろというだけなのです。家は休暇やすみになって帰りさえすれば、それでいいものと私は考えていました。父の後を相続する、それには嫁が必要だから貰もらう、両方とも理屈としては一通ひととおり聞こえます。ことに田舎の事情を知っている私には、よく解わかります。私も絶対にそれを嫌ってはいなかったのでしょう。しかし東京へ修業に出たばかりの私には、それが遠眼鏡とおめがねで物を見るように、遥はるか先の距離に望まれるだけでした。私は叔父の希望に承諾を与えないで、ついにまた私の家を去りました。,"Besides remembering my deceased father and mother from time to time, I spent the summer with my uncle's family and returned to Tokyo without any discomfort. The only thing that cast a rather dim shadow on my mind that summer was that my uncle and his wife all told me to marry me, who was just in high school. It would have been repeated exactly three or four times before and after. At first I was just surprised at the suddenness. The second time I clearly refused. The third time I finally had to question the reason. Their main idea was simple and easy. All you have to do is get a bride and come back to your house and inherit after your deceased father. I thought it would be okay if I could go home on vacation. Inheriting after my father, and getting a bride because I need a bride, both sound like a whole theory. Especially for me who knows the situation in the countryside, I can understand it well. I would never have hated it either. But for me, who had just started training in Tokyo, it was only desired at a distance far away, like looking at things with telescopes and glasses. I finally left my house again without giving consent to my uncle's wishes.","Recollections of my dead mother and father were all that disturbed the pleasure of the summer I spent with my uncle’s family before returning to Tokyo. But one event did cast a faint shadow across my heart. Although I had barely begun my college life, my uncle and aunt both urged me to consider marrying. They must have repeated it three or four times. The first time they brought up the subject, it was so unexpected that I was no more than taken aback. The second time I made my refusal clear. When they brought it up a third time, I was forced to ask their reasons for pressing marriage on me in this way. Their answer was brief and straightforward. They simply wanted me to make an early marriage so that I could come back to live in the house and become my father’s heir. Personally, all I wanted to do was to come back during vacations. I was familiar enough with country ways to understand this talk of succeeding my father and the consequent need for a wife, of course, and I was not even really against the idea. But I had only just gone to Tokyo to pursue my studies, and to me it was all in some distant future landscape, seen as it were through a telescope. I left the house without consenting to my uncle’s wish.","There were unhappy moments when I thought of my father and mother, but on the whole, I had an enjoyable summer with my uncle’s family. There was one thing, however, which cast a slight shadow on my memory of the summer: my uncle and aunt had more than once tried to persuade me, who had only just entered college, to marry. The first time they mentioned marriage to me, I was somewhat shocked, for the subject had been introduced suddenly; the second time, I positively refused to consider it; and the third time, I was forced to ask them why they wanted to discuss such a thing. The reason they gave was quite simple: I should, they said, get married as soon as possible and succeed my father. I myself had been under the happy impression that so long as I came home for the holidays, all would be well. Of course, I was too well acquainted with the ways of the country not to see the reasonableness of my uncle’s wish that I should get married and settle down properly as my father’s heir. Moreover, I do not think that I really disliked the prospect; but I had only recently begun my studies at college, and it was no more real to me than a distant scene observed from the wrong end of a telescope."
先生が最後に付け加えた「妻君のために」という言葉は妙にその時の私の心を暖かにした。私はその言葉のために、帰ってから安心して寝る事ができた。私はその後ごも長い間この「妻君のために」という言葉を忘れなかった。,"The word ""for my wife"" that the teacher added at the end strangely warmed my heart at that time. Because of that word, I was able to sleep with peace of mind after returning. I haven't forgotten this word ""for my wife"" for a long time after that.","“For my wife’s sake”—these words warmed my heart. Thanks to them, I slept in peace that night, and they stayed with me for a long time to come.","“For my wife’s sake . . .”: these last words of Sensei’s strangely warmed my heart. Because of them, I was able to enjoy an untroubled sleep that night. And for a long time after, those words stayed with me: “For my wife’s sake . . .”"
先生は庭の方を向いて、澄まして烟草タバコを吹かしていた。相手は自然奥さんでなければならなかった。,The teacher turned to the garden and was clear and smoking a cigarette. The other party had to be a natural wife.,"Sensei was facing the garden, calmly puffing on his cigarette, so I naturally addressed his wife.","Sensei was looking at the garden, calmly smoking a cigarette. His wife again had to do the answering:"
私は鞄かばんを買った。無論和製の下等な品に過ぎなかったが、それでも金具やなどがぴかぴかしているので、田舎ものを威嚇おどかすには充分であった。この鞄を買うという事は、私の母の注文であった。卒業したら新しい鞄を買って、そのなかに一切いっさいの土産みやげものを入れて帰るようにと、わざわざ手紙の中に書いてあった。私はその文句を読んだ時に笑い出した。私には母の料簡りょうけんが解わからないというよりも、その言葉が一種の滑稽こっけいとして訴えたのである。,"I bought a bag. Of course, it was nothing more than a low-grade item made in Japan, but the metal fittings and other items were still shiny, so it was enough to intimidate the countryside. Buying this bag was my mother's order. When I graduated, I was told in the letter that I should buy a new bag and put all the souvenirs in it. I started laughing when I read the phrase. Rather than not understanding my mother's hunting dog, I complained that the word was a kind of humorous humor.","I bought a travel bag. It was, of course, only an inferior, locally made one, but its shiny metal fittings would look impressive enough to dazzle country folk. My mother had asked me in a letter to buy a travel bag, to carry all the gifts home, and she had specifically said a new bag. I’d laughed aloud when I read that. I appreciated her kindly intention, but the words somehow struck me as funny.","I bought a suitcase also. Of course, it was a cheap one, made in Japan. But it had metal fittings that shone brilliantly, and it was impressive enough to stun country people. My mother had asked me in one of her letters to buy such a bag for myself if I graduated, so that I could come home with all the presents packed in it. I laughed when I read the request. I understood my mother’s motives, and I was not being unkind when I found it comical."
母は死にました。私と妻さいはたった二人ぎりになりました。妻は私に向って、これから世の中で頼りにするものは一人しかなくなったといいました。自分自身さえ頼りにする事のできない私は、妻の顔を見て思わず涙ぐみました。そうして妻を不幸な女だと思いました。また不幸な女だと口へ出してもいいました。妻はなぜだと聞きます。妻には私の意味が解わからないのです。私もそれを説明してやる事ができないのです。妻は泣きました。私が不断ふだんからひねくれた考えで彼女を観察しているために、そんな事もいうようになるのだと恨うらみました。,"My mother died. My wife and I are alone. My wife told me that there was only one thing in the world to count on. I couldn't even rely on myself, and when I saw my wife's face, I burst into tears. Then I thought my wife was an unhappy woman. He also said that he was an unhappy woman. I ask my wife why. My wife doesn't understand what I mean. I can't explain it either. My wife cried. I was reluctant to say that because I was observing her with a constant twist.","In due course my wife’s mother died, leaving my wife and me alone together. I was all she had left in life to trust and depend on, she said to me. At these words, tears filled my eyes to think that she had to trust someone who had forfeited all trust in himself. Poor thing, I thought, and I even said as much to her. “Why?” she asked, uncomprehending. But I could not explain. She cried then. “You’re always so cynical and watchful of me,” she said bitterly.","My mother-in-law died. There remained only my wife and myself. My wife said to me: “In all the world, I now have only you to turn to.” I looked at her, and my eyes suddenly filled with tears. How could I, who had no trust in myself, give her the comfort she needed? I thought her a very unfortunate woman. One day, I said so to her. “Why do you say that?” she asked. She could not understand what I meant. And I could not tell her. She began to cry. “It is because you have always looked at me in your twisted way,” she said reproachfully, “that you can say such things.”"
「君のうちに財産があるなら、今のうちによく始末をつけてもらっておかないといけないと思うがね、余計なお世話だけれども。君のお父さんが達者なうちに、貰もらうものはちゃんと貰っておくようにしたらどうですか。万一の事があったあとで、一番面倒の起るのは財産の問題だから」,"""If you have a fortune, I think you'll have to get rid of it now, but it's extra care. While your dad is a master, you'll get what you get. Why don't you keep it in mind? After something happens, the most troublesome thing is the problem of property. ""","“It’s none of my business, of course, but in my opinion, if there’s anything to inherit you should make sure the matter’s completely attended to before it’s too late. Why not arrange things with your father now, while he’s still well? When the worst happens, you know, it’s inheritance that causes the biggest problems.”","But don’t you think that while your father is alive, you should make sure that you will receive your proper share? When a man dies suddenly, his estate causes more trouble than anything else.”"
奥さんの嫌われているという意味がやっと私に呑のみ込めた。,The meaning that my wife hates me finally swallowed me.,At last I understood what she had been saying about his feelings for her.,I began to understand Sensei’s wife better.
私の腹の中には始終先刻さっきの事が引ひっ懸かかっていた。肴さかなの骨が咽喉のどに刺さった時のように、私は苦しんだ。打ち明けてみようかと考えたり、止よした方が好よかろうかと思い直したりする動揺が、妙に私の様子をそわそわさせた。,"Everything was stuck in my stomach from beginning to end. I suffered, like when the bones of a side dish stuck in my throat. The turmoil of thinking about confessing and wondering if it would be better to stop made me strangely annoyed.","I still felt disturbed by the argument I had heard. It produced a sharp pain in me, like a fishbone stuck in my throat. I couldn’t decide whether to confess to Sensei that I had overheard it, and my indecision made me unusually fidgety.","I could not forget what had happened earlier that day. It bothered me terribly, like a fish bone in my throat. I could not decide whether I should tell him about it or not."

Who on earth would leave someone as ill as he is and take off to Tokyo, after all?”","“I should say so! Who would ever think of going to Tokyo at a time like this, when he is so critically ill!”"
「学問をさせると人間がとかく理屈っぽくなっていけない」,"""If you let them learn, humans can't become rational anyway.""",It’s a shame that an education just gives people the means to chop logic.”,"“The trouble with education,” said my father, “is that it makes a man argumentative.”"

「あなたは特別よ」,"""You are special""",“You’re a special case.”,"“No, not at all. You are different.”"
私はそこまで読んで、始めてこの長いものが何のために書かれたのか、その理由を明らかに知る事ができた。私の衣食の口、そんなものについて先生が手紙を寄こす気遣きづかいはないと、私は初手から信じていた。しかし筆を執とることの嫌いな先生が、どうしてあの事件をこう長く書いて、私に見せる気になったのだろう。先生はなぜ私の上京するまで待っていられないだろう。,"I read that far and for the first time I could clearly see why this long one was written for. From the beginning, I believed that the teacher didn't care about my food and clothing, and that kind of thing. But why did the teacher, who hates writing, want to write the case so long and show it to me? Why can't the teacher wait until I come to Tokyo?","Only when I had read this far did I fully understand why he had written this long missive. I had believed all along that he would not bother sending a letter on the trivial question of my future employment. But why should Sensei, who disliked writing, have felt the urge to write about the past at such length? Why had it been impossible for him to wait until I returned?","I read thus far, and realized why it was that the letter was so long. That Sensei would not bother to write me about my future career, I had more or less known from the very beginning. What really worried me was that Sensei, who hated to write at all, had taken the trouble to write such a long epistle. Why had he not waited, I asked myself, until I was once more in Tokyo?"
「そうでしょう」と私がいった。,"""That's right,"" I said.","“Yes, you do,” I replied.","“You are rich, aren’t you?” I said."

私は始め心のなかで、何も知らない母を憐あわれんだ。しかし母がなぜこんな問題をこのざわざわした際に持ち出したのか理解できなかった。私が父の病気をよそに、静かに坐ったり書見したりする余裕のあるごとくに、母も眼の前の病人を忘れて、外ほかの事を考えるだけ、胸に空地すきまがあるのかしらと疑うたぐった。その時「実はね」と母がいい出した。,"At first, I had mercy on my mother who knew nothing in my heart. However, I couldn't understand why my mother brought up such a problem when she was in a hurry. Just as I can afford to sit quietly and write a book despite my father's illness, my mother also forgets the sick person in front of her and just thinks about other things, and there is a gap in her chest. I doubted it. At that time, my mother said, ""Actually.""","My first reaction was pity for my innocent mother. But I couldn’t understand why she would choose this hectic moment to bring up the problem. Was there something in her makeup that was equivalent to the oddly casual way I could forget my father’s illness and sit calmly reading, something that allowed her to temporarily forget the invalid in her care and concern herself like this with other matters? As this thought was crossing my mind, my mother spoke.","At first, I felt sorry for my mother who understood so little. And then, I began to wonder why it was that she had chosen such a time to reopen the question of my future. I had myself been able to forget my father’s illness for a moment or two, and read and think in the privacy of my room. But did my mother, I wondered, have the same capacity to detach her thoughts from the invalid for a brief while, and worry about other things? My mother began to speak again: “As a matter of fact . . .”"

「自分で病気に罹かかっていながら、気が付かないで平気でいるのがあの病の特色です。私の知ったある士官しかんは、とうとうそれでやられたが、全く噓うそのような死に方をしたんですよ。何しろ傍そばに寝ていた細君さいくんが看病をする暇もなんにもないくらいなんですからね。夜中にちょっと苦しいといって、細君を起したぎり、翌あくる朝はもう死んでいたんです。しかも細君は夫が寝ているとばかり思ってたんだっていうんだから」,"""It's a characteristic of the disease that I'm sick myself, but I don't notice it. One officer I knew was finally killed by it, but he died like that. After all, Hosono, who was sleeping beside him, didn't have time to take care of him. He said it was a little painful in the middle of the night, and he woke him up, and he was dead the next morning. Moreover, Hosono just thought that his husband was sleeping. ""","“It’s typical of that illness that the patient feels quite well and unaware of the disease. I knew a military officer who was killed by it—he simply died overnight, quite astonishing. His death was so sudden that his own wife hadn’t even realized he was ill. He just woke her in the night saying he felt bad, and the next morning he was dead. It happened so swiftly that she said she’d assumed he was sleeping.”","“The trouble with your father’s disease,” Sensei continued, “is that the person who has it is often not aware of it. An officer I used to know died of it quite suddenly in his sleep. His wife, who was sleeping next to him, had no time to do anything for him. He woke her up once during the night, saying that he was not feeling well. The next morning, he was dead. The unfortunate thing was that his wife had been under the impression that he had gone back to sleep.”"
「そりゃそうかも知れないけれども、またひょっとして、どんな好いい口がないとも限らないんだから、早く頼んでおくに越した事はないよ」,"""Maybe that's the case, but maybe I don't have any good mouth, so it's best to ask early.""","“That may well be true, but you never know what fine offer may come up in the meantime, so it’s best to put in an early request.”","“That may be so, but it never does any harm to write to one’s friends first.

私は今この悲劇について何事も語らない。その悲劇のためにむしろ生れ出たともいえる二人の恋愛については、先刻さっきいった通りであった。二人とも私にはほとんど何も話してくれなかった。奥さんは慎みのために、先生はまたそれ以上の深い理由のために。,"I don't say anything about this tragedy right now. The love affair between the two, who could be said to have been born because of the tragedy, was just as I mentioned earlier. Neither of them told me almost anything. The wife is for modesty, and the teacher is for deeper reasons.","I will say nothing of that tragedy yet. As for their romance, which was in a sense born of this dreadful thing, neither of them told me anything. In her case, it was simply discretion. Sensei had deeper reasons for his silence.","I shall not speak here of the tragedy in Sensei’s life. And, as I have said before, Sensei and his wife told me almost nothing of their courtship, which had come into being as though for the sake of the tragedy.

Ｋはしばらくして、私の名を呼んで私の方を見ました。今度は私の方で自然と足を留めました。するとＫも留まりました。私はその時やっとＫの眼を真向まむきに見る事ができたのです。Ｋは私より背せいの高い男でしたから、私は勢い彼の顔を見上げるようにしなければなりません。私はそうした態度で、狼おおかみのごとき心を罪のない羊に向けたのです。,"After a while, K called my name and looked at me. This time I naturally stopped. Then K stayed. At that time, I was finally able to look straight into K's eyes. K was a taller man than I was, so I have to try to look up at his face. With that attitude, I turned my heart like a wolf to an innocent sheep.","After a while K spoke my name and turned to look at me. This time it was I who stopped in my tracks. K halted too.

「私が三度目に帰国したのは、それからまた一年経たった夏の取付とっつきでした。私はいつでも学年試験の済むのを待ちかねて東京を逃げました。私には故郷ふるさとがそれほど懐かしかったからです。あなたにも覚えがあるでしょう、生れた所は空気の色が違います、土地の匂においも格別です、父や母の記憶も濃こまやかに漂ただよっています。一年のうちで、七、八の二月ふたつきをその中に包くるまれて、穴に入った蛇へびのように凝じっとしているのは、私に取って何よりも温かい好いい心持だったのです。,"""The third time I returned to Japan was the summer installation, a year later. I always fled Tokyo waiting for the grade exam to finish, because I missed my hometown so much. You will remember, the color of the air is different where you were born, the smell of the land is exceptional, and the memories of your father and mother are deeply drifting. Seven in a year, It was the warmest and most pleasant feeling for me that the February lid of August was wrapped in it and stiffened like a snake snake in a hole.","A year later, at the beginning of the following summer, I went back home for the third time. As always, I couldn’t wait to finish final exams and get out of Tokyo, which indicates how much I longed for my home. I am sure you know this well too—the very color of the air in the place I was born was different, the smell of the earth was special, redolent with memories of my parents. To spend July and August nestled back inside that world, motionless as a snake in its hole, filled me with warm pleasure.","The following summer, I went home for the third time. I had as usual awaited the end of the examinations impatiently, and then had hurried away from Tokyo as quickly as I could. Home was indeed very dear to me. You know of course that the very air of one’s native place seems different from that of anywhere else. The smell of the earth, even, seems to have a special quality of its own. Besides, I found there to comfort me the tender memory of my father and mother. I looked forward to the months of July and August, when I could live like a snake hibernating in its hole, secure and comfortable in familiar surroundings."
けれども先生の私に対する態度は初めて挨拶あいさつをした時も、懇意になったその後のちも、あまり変りはなかった。先生は何時いつも静かであった。ある時は静か過ぎて淋さびしいくらいであった。私は最初から先生には近づきがたい不思議があるように思っていた。それでいて、どうしても近づかなければいられないという感じが、どこかに強く働いた。こういう感じを先生に対してもっていたものは、多くの人のうちであるいは私だけかも知れない。しかしその私だけにはこの直感が後のちになって事実の上に証拠立てられたのだから、私は若々しいといわれても、馬鹿ばかげていると笑われても、それを見越した自分の直覚をとにかく頼もしくまた嬉うれしく思っている。人間を愛し得うる人、愛せずにはいられない人、それでいて自分の懐ふところに入いろうとするものを、手をひろげて抱き締める事のできない人、――これが先生であった。,"However, the teacher's attitude toward me did not change much when he first greeted me and after he became acquainted. The teacher was always quiet. At one point it was too quiet and lonely. From the beginning I thought the teacher had an inaccessible wonder. Still, the feeling that I had to get closer worked strongly somewhere. I may be the only one among many who had this feeling for the teacher. But only for me, this intuition was later proved on the facts, so even if I was said to be youthful or ridiculous, I foresaw it. Anyway, I'm glad that my intuition is reliable. A person who can love human beings, a person who cannot help but love, and a person who cannot open his hands and hug something that is trying to enter his pocket-this was the teacher.","Yet Sensei’s manner toward me never really changed, from the day we first exchanged words to the time when our friendship was well established. He was always quiet, sometimes almost forlorn. From the outset he seemed to me strangely unapproachable, yet I felt compelled to find a way to get close to him. Perhaps no one else would have had this response—others might have dismissed it as folly, an impulse of youth. Yet I feel a certain happy pride in the insight I showed, for later events served to justify my intuition. Sensei was a man who could, indeed must love, yet he was unable to open his arms and accept into his heart another who sought to enter.","Despite this, however, there was no great change in Sensei’s manner towards me. He was always quiet. At times, he seemed so quiet that I thought him rather lonely. I felt from the start his strangely unapproachable quality. Yet, at the same time, there was within me an irresistible desire to become close to Sensei. Perhaps I was the only one who felt thus towards him. Some might say that I was being foolish and naïve. But even now, I feel a certain pride and happiness in the fact that my intuitive fondness for Sensei was later shown to have not been in vain. A man capable of love, or I should say rather a man who was by nature incapable of not loving; but a man who could not wholeheartedly accept the love of another—such a one was Sensei."
私は今更それを否定する勇気を失った。自分にも何とも訳の分らない曖昧あいまいな返事をして、わざと席を立った。,I have lost the courage to deny it anymore. I intentionally left my seat with an ambiguous reply that I couldn't understand.,"Now things had gone so far, I lost the courage to deny the story. I prevaricated with some vague reply, incomprehensible even to myself, and left the room.","It was too late to tell the truth. I lacked the courage. I made a vague remark, so vague that I myself did not know its meaning, and abruptly left the room."
電報にはちょっと会いたいが来られるかという意味が簡単に書いてあった。私は首を傾けた。,The telegram simply said that I would like to meet you for a while. I tilted my head.,The telegram simply stated that he wanted to see me and asked if I could come. I cocked my head in puzzlement.,"It was a simple message, saying that he would like to see me if possible, and would I come up? I cocked my head in puzzlement."
「お父さんは？」と私が聞いた。,"""What about your dad?"" I asked.",“How’s Father?” I asked.,“How is father?” I asked.
父は死後の事を考えているらしかった。少なくとも自分がいなくなった後あとのわが家いえを想像して見るらしかった。,My father seemed to be thinking about the afterlife. At least it seemed like I imagined my home after I was gone.,"My father was apparently giving some thought to what would happen once he died, or at any rate he was imagining the posthumous household.",My father seemed to be thinking about what would happen after his death. It was apparent at least that he often tried to picture to himself life in the house with him gone.
先生と知り合いになってから先生の亡くなるまでに、私はずいぶん色々の問題で先生の思想や情操に触れてみたが、結婚当時の状況については、ほとんど何ものも聞き得なかった。私は時によると、それを善意に解釈してもみた。年輩の先生の事だから、艶なまめかしい回想などを若いものに聞かせるのはわざと慎つつしんでいるのだろうと思った。時によると、またそれを悪くも取った。先生に限らず、奥さんに限らず、二人とも私に比べると、一時代前の因襲のうちに成人したために、そういう艶つやっぽい問題になると、正直に自分を開放するだけの勇気がないのだろうと考えた。もっともどちらも推測に過ぎなかった。そうしてどちらの推測の裏にも、二人の結婚の奥に横たわる花やかなロマンスの存在を仮定していた。,"From the time I got acquainted with the teacher to the time he died, I tried to touch on the thoughts and feelings of the teacher on various problems, but I could hardly hear anything about the situation at the time of marriage. I sometimes tried to interpret it in good faith. Since it's an older teacher, I thought that I was deliberately refraining from letting young people hear the glamorous recollections. Occasionally, I took it badly again. Compared to me, not only the teacher but also the wife, both of them have grown up in the wake of an era ago, so when it comes to such a glossy problem, I honestly do not have the courage to open myself up. I thought it was. However, both were just speculations. Behind both speculations, he assumed the existence of a flowery romance lying in the depths of their marriage.","Between our first meeting and his death, I came to know Sensei’s ideas and feelings on all sorts of subjects, but I learned almost nothing about the circumstances surrounding his marriage. Sometimes I interpreted this reticence charitably, choosing to believe that Sensei, as an older man, would prefer to be discreet on a private matter of the heart. At other times, however, I saw the question in a less positive light, and felt that Sensei and his wife shared the older generation’s timorous aversion to open, honest discussion of these delicate subjects. Both of my interpretations were of course mere speculations, and both were premised on the assumption that a splendid romance lay behind their marriage.","In the years between my first meeting with Sensei and his death, I came to know much of what he thought and felt, but concerning the circumstances of his marriage, he told me almost nothing. I was inclined, sometimes, to regard this reserve on Sensei’s part in a favorable light. After all, I would tell myself, he quite naturally would consider it indiscreet and in bad taste to speak of his early courtship to a youth such as myself. But sometimes, I was inclined to regard his reserve unfavorably. I liked then to think that his reluctance to discuss such a matter was due to timidity born of the conventions of a generation ago. I thought myself more free, in this respect, and more open-minded, than either Sensei or his wife. Whatever my thoughts regarding Sensei ’s reserve might have been, they were, of course, only speculations. And there was always, at the back of my speculations, the assumption that their marriage had been the flowering of a beautiful romance."
「もうその話は止やめよう」と彼がいいました。彼の眼にも彼の言葉にも変に悲痛なところがありました。私はちょっと挨拶あいさつができなかったのです。するとＫは、「止やめてくれ」と今度は頼むようにいい直しました。私はその時彼に向って残酷な答を与えたのです。狼おおかみが隙すきを見て羊の咽喉笛のどぶえへ食くらい付くように。,"""Let's stop talking about it,"" he said. There was something strangely sad in his eyes and in his words. I couldn't say hello for a moment. Then K fixed it so that he would ask ""Stop it"" this time. I then gave him a cruel answer. Just as the wolf wolf sees the gap and eats into the throat of the sheep's throat.","“Let’s not talk about it anymore,” he said. There was a strange grief both in his voice and in the expression in his eyes. I could say nothing in reply. “Please stop,” he said again, pleading now. My answer was cruel. I leaped like a wolf upon the lamb’s throat.","“Let us not talk about it any more,” he said. I was strangely affected by the pain in his eyes and in his words. For a moment, I did not know what to say. Then, in a more pleading tone, he said again: “Please, don’t talk about it.” My answer was cruel. The wolf jumped at the lamb’s throat."
私はほどなく穏やかな眠りに落ちました。しかし突然私の名を呼ぶ声で眼を覚ましました。見ると、間の襖ふすまが二尺しゃくばかり開あいて、そこにＫの黒い影が立っています。そうして彼の室には宵よいの通りまだ燈火あかりが点ついているのです。急に世界の変った私は、少しの間あいだ口を利きく事もできずに、ぼうっとして、その光景を眺ながめていました。,"I soon fell asleep. But suddenly I woke up with a voice calling my name. When you look at it, the fusuma bran in between opens up just two shaku, and a black shadow of K stands there. And in his room, the lights are still on as good as the evening. Suddenly the world changed, I couldn't speak for a while, and I was drowsy and staring at the scene.","Soon I drifted into a calm sleep. But I was awakened by the sudden sound of my name. Turning to look, I saw that the sliding doors were partly open, and K’s dark shape was standing there. The desk lamp still glowed in the room beyond. Stunned by the sudden change in my world, for a long moment I could only lie there, speechless and staring.","I was soon fast asleep. Then suddenly, I was awakened by someone calling my name. The door was open, and I saw K’s shadowy figure standing in the door-way. The lamp was still burning in his room. The change from sleep to wakefulness had been too abrupt, and I lay for a moment or two in a daze, unable to speak."
私わたくしがその掛茶屋で先生を見た時は、先生がちょうど着物を脱いでこれから海へ入ろうとするところであった。私はその時反対に濡ぬれた身体からだを風に吹かして水から上がって来た。二人の間あいだには目を遮さえぎる幾多の黒い頭が動いていた。特別の事情のない限り、私はついに先生を見逃したかも知れなかった。それほど浜辺が混雑し、それほど私の頭が放漫ほうまんであったにもかかわらず、私がすぐ先生を見付け出したのは、先生が一人の西洋人を伴つれていたからである。,"When I saw the teacher at the Kakechaya, he was just about to take off his kimono and enter the sea. On the contrary, I blew my wet body in the wind and came out of the water. There were many black heads moving between them, blocking their eyes. Unless there were special circumstances, I might have finally missed the teacher. Even though the beach was so crowded and my head was so loose, I found the teacher right away because he was accompanied by a Westerner.","When I first set eyes on Sensei there, he had just taken off his clothes and was about to go in for a swim, while I had just emerged from the water and was drying off in the sea breeze. A number of black heads were moving around between us, obstructing my view of him, and under normal circumstances I probably would not have noticed him. But he instantly caught my attention, despite the crowd and my own distracted state of mind, because he was with a Westerner.","Sensei had just taken his clothes off and was about to go for a swim when I first laid eyes on him in the tea house. I had already had my swim, and was letting the wind blow gently on my wet body. Between us, there were numerous black heads moving about. I was in a relaxed frame of mind, and there was such a crowd on the beach that I should never have noticed him had he not been accompanied by a Westerner."
父は自分の達者な保証を自分で与えながら、今にも己おのれに落ちかかって来そうな危険を予感しているらしかった。,My father seemed to foresee the danger that he might fall on himself while giving himself a guarantee of his mastery.,"Even as he was congratulating himself on his state of health, he seemed to anticipate the danger that threatened to descend at any moment.","Despite his attempts at being optimistic, however, I suspected that he feared the worst for himself."
「かぶれても構わないから、その代りこの間いった通り、お父さんの生きてるうちに、相当の財産を分けてもらってお置きなさい。それでないと決して油断はならない」,"""I don't mind if I get a rash, but instead, as I said during this time, have my dad share a considerable amount of property while he is alive. Otherwise, I will never be alert.""","while your father is still alive, that you get a decent inheritance, as I said the other day. You mustn’t relax until that’s sorted out.”","“I don’t care if it’s my influence or not. But as I have already said, make sure that your father will leave you a reasonable amount of money. Otherwise, you cannot afford to be so easygoing.”"
「妻が私を誤解するのです。それを誤解だといって聞かせても承知しないのです。つい腹を立てたのです」,"""My wife misunderstands me. I don't know if I say it's a misunderstanding. I just got angry.""","“My wife misunderstands me. I tell her so, but she won’t believe me. I’m afraid I lost my temper with her.”","“You see, sometimes my wife misunderstands me. And when I tell her so, she refuses to listen. That is why today, for instance, I unwittingly lost my temper.”"
私は繊維の強い包み紙を引き搔くように裂さき破った。中から出たものは、縦横たてよこに引いた罫けいの中へ行儀よく書いた原稿様ようのものであった。そうして封じる便宜のために、四よつ折おりに畳たたまれてあった。私は癖のついた西洋紙を、逆に折り返して読みやすいように平たくした。,I tore the strong fiber wrapping paper like a tear. What came out from the inside was like a manuscript that was well-written in the vertical and horizontal ruled lines. It was folded in four folds for the convenience of sealing. I folded the quirky Western paper and flattened it for readability.,"I tore roughly at the strong, fibrous paper that wrapped it. When I got it open, what emerged was a document written in a clear hand on ruled manuscript paper that had been folded in quarters to post. I bent back the kinks of the folds to straighten the pages for ease of reading.","Almost violently, I tore open the tough paper which contained the letter. The letter had the appearance of a manuscript, with the characters neatly written between vertically ruled lines. I smoothed out the sheets which had been folded over twice for easier handling in the post. I could not but wonder what it was that Sensei had written at such great length."
先生は時々奥さんを伴つれて、音楽会だの芝居だのに行った。それから夫婦づれで一週間以内の旅行をした事も、私の記憶によると、二、三度以上あった。私は箱根はこねから貰った絵端書えはがきをまだ持っている。日光にっこうへ行った時は紅葉もみじの葉を一枚封じ込めた郵便も貰った。,"The teacher sometimes accompanied his wife to a concert or a play. After that, I remember traveling with my husband and wife within a week more than a couple of times. I still have the picture postcard that Hakone got from Kneading. When I went to Nikko, I received a mail containing a piece of autumn leaves and maple leaves.","Sensei would sometimes take her out to a concert or the theater. I also recall two or three occasions when they went off for a week’s vacation together. I still have a postcard they sent from the hot springs resort at Hakoné, and I received a letter from their visit to Nikko, with an autumn leaf enclosed.","Sometimes, Sensei would take his wife to a concert or to the theatre. Also, I remember that they went away together for a week’s holiday at least two or three times during the period I knew them. I still have with me a postcard that they sent me from Hakone.

「それが解わからないのよ、あなた。それが解るくらいなら私だって、こんなに心配しやしません。わからないから気の毒でたまらないんです」,"""I don't understand it, you. I don't worry so much if I understand it. I'm sorry I don't understand it.""","“I don’t understand it either. If I understood, I wouldn’t worry about him as I do.","“I wish I knew. Do you think that I would be worrying so much, if I did?

結婚した時お嬢さんが、――もうお嬢さんではありませんから、妻さいといいます。――妻が、何を思い出したのか、二人でＫの墓参はかまいりをしようといい出しました。私は意味もなくただぎょっとしました。どうしてそんな事を急に思い立ったのかと聞きました。妻は二人揃そろってお参りをしたら、Ｋがさぞ喜ぶだろうというのです。私は何事も知らない妻の顔をしけじけ眺ながめていましたが、妻からなぜそんな顔をするのかと問われて始めて気が付きました。,"When I got married, my daughter-I'm no longer a daughter, so I'm my wife. ――What did my wife remember, K's grave visitor said that they would try to get rid of it. I was just scared for no reason. I asked him why he suddenly came up with such a thing. It is said that K will be delighted if the two wives visit together. I was staring at my wife's face, which I didn't know anything about, but I realized it only when my wife asked me why she had such a face.","Once married, Ojōsan—but I should now begin to call her “my wife”—my wife for some reason suggested that we visit K’s grave together. This jolted me. Why had she suddenly come up with such an idea? I inquired. She replied that it would surely please K if we visited him together. I stared hard at her guileless face, until she asked why I was looking at her like that.","Soon after the wedding, Ojosan—“my wife,” I shall call her from now on—for some reason suggested that we visit K’s grave together. I should have known better, but I was at once suspicious. “Why this sudden desire to go there?” I asked. “I thought that K would be pleased,” she said. I gazed at her innocent face in silence. I pulled myself together when she said, “Why do you look at me like that?”"
その時の私わたくしはすでに大学生であった。始めて先生の宅うちへ来た頃ころから見るとずっと成人した気でいた。奥さんとも大分だいぶ懇意になった後のちであった。私は奥さんに対して何の窮屈も感じなかった。差向さしむかいで色々の話をした。しかしそれは特色のないただの談話だから、今ではまるで忘れてしまった。そのうちでたった一つ私の耳に留まったものがある。しかしそれを話す前に、ちょっと断っておきたい事がある。,"At that time, I was already a college student. When I first came to my teacher's house, I felt like I was an adult. It was after I became very friendly with my wife. I didn't feel any crampedness towards my wife. I talked about various things while facing him. But it's just a discourse with no special features, so I've forgotten it now. Only one of them caught my ear. But before I talk about it, I have something to say.","By this time I was a university student, and felt myself to be far more adult than when I had first begun to visit Sensei. I was also quite friendly with his wife and now chatted easily and unself-consciously with her about this and that. This conversation was light and incidental, containing nothing remarkable, and I have forgotten what we spoke of. Just one thing struck me, but before I proceed I should explain a little.","By then, I was already a university student.2 I felt that I had become more mature since my first visit to Sensei’s house. I had also become quite familiar with Sensei’s wife. Therefore, when I found myself alone with her, I did not feel at all ill at ease. We talked of this and that. I should not have remembered the conversation at all, had it not been for the fact that in the course of it, we talked of one matter which was of particular interest to me. Before I go on to say what this was, I should perhaps explain a few things about Sensei."
「急にじゃありません、段々ああなって来たのよ」,"""It's not sudden, it's getting more and more like that.""",“The change wasn’t sudden—it came over him gradually.”,It came gradually.”
こんな事で時間が掛かかって帰りは夕飯ゆうめしの時刻になりました。奥さんは私に対するお礼に何かご馳走ちそうするといって、木原店きはらだなという寄席よせのある狭い横丁よこちょうへ私を連れ込みました。横丁も狭いが、飯を食わせる家うちも狭いものでした。この辺へんの地理を一向いっこう心得ない私は、奥さんの知識に驚いたくらいです。,"It took a long time because of this, and it was time for dinner on my way home. My wife said that she was going to treat me as a thank-you, and brought me to a narrow side street called Kiharadana, which is a yose. The side streets are small, but the house where you can eat rice is also small. I didn't know much about the geography of this area, so I was surprised at his wife's knowledge.","It was dinnertime when we were finally through. Okusan offered to treat me to a meal by way of thanks, and she led us down a narrow side street where I remember there was a vaudeville theater called Kiharadana. Our restaurant was as tiny as the lane. I knew nothing of the local geography, and Okusan’s familiarity with it quite surprised me.","When we finally left the shop, it was time for dinner. Okusan said that to thank me for being so kind, she would like to take me out to dinner. She led us into a narrow side street called Kiharadana where there was, I noticed, a small old-fashioned theater. The restaurant we went into was as poky as the street. I was not at all familiar with the neighborhood, and I was amazed that Okusan should know it so well."
「子供はいつまで経たったってできっこないよ」と先生がいった。,"""Children can't be born no matter how long they pass,"" said the teacher.","“We’ll never have one, you know,” Sensei said.","“But we’ll never have one of our own, you know,” said Sensei."
私は黙っていた。奥さんも言葉を途切とぎらした。下女部屋げじょべやにいる下女はことりとも音をさせなかった。私はまるで泥棒の事を忘れてしまった。,I was silent. His wife also cut off his words. The maiden in the maiden room did not make any noise. I forgot about the thief.,That’s all he’ll say.” I did not speak. Sensei’s wife also fell silent. There was no sound from the maid’s room. All thoughts of burglars had vanished from my mind. Then she broke the silence.,I said nothing. Sensei’s wife also became silent. Not a sound came from the maid’s room. I forgot all about the burglar.
先生の宅うちは夫婦と下女げじょだけであった。行くたびに大抵たいていはひそりとしていた。高い笑い声などの聞こえる試しはまるでなかった。或ある時ときは宅の中にいるものは先生と私だけのような気がした。,"The teacher's house was only a couple and a maiden. Every time I went, I was usually sledding. There was no audible trial of high laughter. At one point, I felt like the only thing in my house was my teacher and I.","Then you won’t feel so melancholy.” The two of them lived there with only a maid for company, and I generally found the house hushed and silent when I arrived. I never heard loud laughter or raised voices. It sometimes felt as if Sensei and I were the only people in the house.","Apart from them, there was only the maid in the house. Every time I went there, the house seemed to be absolutely quiet. I never heard the sound of laughter there, and sometimes it seemed almost as if Sensei and I were the only people in it."
「私の過去を訐あばいてもですか」,"""Can I tell you about my past?""",“Even if it means disclosing my past?”,“Even to the extent of digging up my past?”
十五,Fifteen,CHAPTER 15,"After that day, I used to wonder each time I saw Sensei’s wife whether Sensei’s attitude towards her reflected his inner thoughts, and if so, whether she could be satisfied with her condition."
私は先生が私のうちの財産を聞いたり、私の父の病気を尋ねたりするのを、普通の談話――胸に浮かんだままをその通り口にする、普通の談話と思って聞いていた。ところが先生の言葉の底には両方を結び付ける大きな意味があった。先生自身の経験を持たない私は無論そこに気が付くはずがなかった。,"I hear the teacher listening to my fortune and asking about my father's illness as a normal discourse-a normal discourse that says exactly what's in my heart. rice field. However, at the bottom of the teacher's words, there was a big meaning to connect both. Of course I couldn't have noticed it because I didn't have the experience of the teacher himself.","I took his inquiries about my family’s wealth and my father’s illness at face value, as no more than an impulse of the moment. But behind his words loomed a large issue that connected the two topics. I had no way of realizing it, however, since I lacked the experiences that Sensei had been through.","I assumed then that Sensei’s questions about my family’s wealth and my father’s illness expressed no more than a normal interest in my affairs, and not knowing much about Sensei’s life history, I could not guess that they implied much more than appeared on the surface. “If there is any property in your family, then I do think you should see to it that your inheritance is properly settled now. I know that all this is none of my business."
「いいえ」と私は答えた。,"""No,"" I replied.","“No,” I replied.","“No,” I said."
今まで書物で城壁をきずいてその中に立て籠こもっていたようなＫの心が、段々打ち解けて来るのを見ているのは、私に取って何よりも愉快でした。私は最初からそうした目的で事をやり出したのですから、自分の成功に伴う喜悦を感ぜずにはいられなかったのです。私は本人にいわない代りに、奥さんとお嬢さんに自分の思った通りを話しました。二人も満足の様子でした。,"It was more fun for me to see K's heart, which had been scratched by books and stood in it, gradually unraveling. I started doing things for that purpose from the beginning, so I couldn't help but feel the joy of my success. Instead of telling him, I told my wife and daughter what I wanted. Both of them seemed satisfied.","This man who had constructed a defensive fortress of books to hide behind was now slowly opening up to the world, and the change in his heart delighted me. Opening him up had been my plan all along, and its success sent an irrepressible wave of joy through me. Though I said nothing of it to him, I shared my joy with Okusan and Ojōsan. They too seemed gratified.","It was very pleasing to me to see him gradually emerge from his fortress of books, and to see his heart beginning to thaw. Such had been my hope when I first brought him to the house, and it was natural that I should be happy to see my plan succeeding so well. I told Okusan and Ojosan—though not K himself —how happy I was to see the change in him. They seemed pleased too."
十二,twelve,CHAPTER 48,I did not write so much as a line to Sensei.
私はとうとう叔父おじと談判を開きました。談判というのは少し不穏当ふおんとうかも知れませんが、話の成行なりゆきからいうと、そんな言葉で形容するより外に途みちのないところへ、自然の調子が落ちて来たのです。叔父はどこまでも私を子供扱いにしようとします。私はまた始めから猜疑さいぎの眼で叔父に対しています。穏やかに解決のつくはずはなかったのです。,"I finally had a talk with my uncle. The discourse may seem a bit disturbing, but from the point of view of the story, the natural tone has fallen to a place where there is no end to what it describes in such words. .. My uncle tries to treat me as a child forever. From the beginning, I have been suspicious of my uncle. It couldn't have been solved gently.","I finally managed to open negotiations with my uncle. Perhaps the word negotiations is a little harsh, but as we talked, the tenor of our relations sank to such a low level that only this word can express what took place. My uncle persisted in treating me as a child, while I viewed him through the jaundiced eyes of suspicion. Under these circumstances, the chances of a peaceful resolution were nil.","At last, I had a conference with him. To say that “I had a conference” may sound odd, but that is about the only way I can describe our talk. My uncle persisted in treating me like a child, while I regarded him with suspicion from the beginning. There was certainly no chance of our talk ending amicably."

それから二、三日して、私はとうとう自殺する決心をしたのです。私に乃木さんの死んだ理由がよく解わからないように、あなたにも私の自殺する訳が明らかに呑のみ込めないかも知れませんが、もしそうだとすると、それは時勢の推移から来る人間の相違だから仕方がありません。あるいは箇人こじんのもって生れた性格の相違といった方が確たしかかも知れません。私は私のできる限りこの不可思議な私というものを、あなたに解らせるように、今までの叙述で己おのれを尽つくしたつもりです。,"A few days later, I finally decided to commit suicide. Just as I don't understand why Nogi died, you may obviously not be able to swallow my suicide, but if so, it's a human difference that comes from the changing times. it can't be helped. Or maybe it's more certain that the personality of the person was different. I will do my best in my previous narratives so that you can understand this mysterious me as much as I can.","Two or three days later I finally decided to kill myself. I would guess that my reasons will be as hard for you to fully grasp as I found General Nogi’s reasons to be. If so, it must simply be put down to the different eras we belong to, I think. Or perhaps, after all, our differences spring from the individual natures we were born with. At any rate, I have done my best in these pages to explain to you my own strange nature.","It was two or three days later that I decided at last to commit suicide. Perhaps you will not understand clearly why I am about to die, no more than I can fully understand why General Nogi killed himself. You and I belong to different eras, and so we think differently. There is nothing we can do to bridge the gap between us. Of course, it may be more correct to say that we are different simply because we are two separate human beings. At any rate, I have done my best in the above narrative to make you understand this strange person that is myself."
私は心のうちで、父と先生とを比較して見た。両方とも世間から見れば、生きているか死んでいるか分らないほど大人おとなしい男であった。他ひとに認められるという点からいえばどっちも零れいであった。それでいて、この将碁を差したがる父は、単なる娯楽の相手としても私には物足りなかった。かつて遊興のために往来ゆききをした覚おぼえのない先生は、歓楽の交際から出る親しみ以上に、いつか私の頭に影響を与えていた。ただ頭というのはあまりに冷ひややか過ぎるから、私は胸といい直したい。肉のなかに先生の力が喰くい込んでいるといっても、血のなかに先生の命が流れているといっても、その時の私には少しも誇張でないように思われた。私は父が私の本当の父であり、先生はまたいうまでもなく、あかの他人であるという明白な事実を、ことさらに眼の前に並べてみて、始めて大きな真理でも発見したかのごとくに驚いた。,"I compared my father and teacher in my heart. Both were adult and docile men who couldn't tell if they were alive or dead. Both were spilled in terms of being recognized by others. Still, my father, who wanted to play this Go, wasn't enough for me as a mere entertainment partner. The unconscious teacher, who once traveled for entertainment, had an impact on my mind someday more than the friendliness of the joyous dating. However, my head is too cold, so I want to call it my chest. Even though the teacher's power was digging into the flesh and the teacher's life flowing in the blood, it didn't seem to me at all to exaggerate. It's as if I've discovered the big truth for the first time by lining up the obvious fact that my father is my true father and, of course, the teacher is that stranger. surprised.","In my heart I experimentally compared the two men, my father and Sensei. Both were quiet, retiring people who, as far as the world at large was concerned, could just as well be dead. Neither received the slightest recognition. Yet playing partner to my shōgi-loving father and sharing his simple enjoyments gave me no satisfaction, while Sensei, to whom I had never gone for mere amusement, had influenced my mind far more deeply than would any idle entertainment. “My mind” sounds too cool and detached —let me rather say “my breast.” It would have felt no exaggeration to say that Sensei’s strength seemed to have entered my body, and my very blood flowed with his life force. When I pondered the fact that my father was my real father, whereas Sensei was quite unrelated to me, I felt as astonished as if I had come upon a new and important truth.","I compared my father with Sensei. Both were self-effacing men. Indeed, they were both so self-effacing that as far as the rest of the world was concerned, they might as well have been dead. They were, from the point of view of the public, complete nonentities. But while my chess-loving father failed even to entertain me, Sensei, whose acquaintance I had never sought for amusement’s sake, gave me far greater intellectual satisfaction as a companion. Perhaps I should not have used the word “intellectual,” for it has a cold and impersonal sound. I should perhaps have said “spiritual” instead. Indeed, it would not have seemed to me then an exaggeration to say that Sensei’s strength had entered my body, and that his very life was flowing in my veins. And when I discovered that such were my true feelings towards these two men, I was shocked. For was I not of my father’s flesh?"
「関せきさんも気の毒だね。ああ幾日も引っ張られて帰れなくっちゃあ」,"""I'm sorry for Mr. Seki. Oh, I have to be pulled for days and go home.""","“Poor Seki,” my brother said. Seki was our brother-in-law’s family name.","“It’s rather hard on poor Seki-san,” said my brother. “He has been kept away from home for days now.”"

「私は今まで叔父任まかせにしておいた家の財産について、詳しい知識を得なければ、死んだ父母ちちははに対して済まないという気を起したのです。叔父は忙しい身体からだだと自称するごとく、毎晩同じ所に寝泊ねとまりはしていませんでした。二日家うちへ帰ると三日は市しの方で暮らすといった風ふうに、両方の間を往来ゆききして、その日その日を落ち付きのない顔で過ごしていました。そうして忙しいという言葉を口癖くちくせのように使いました。何の疑いも起らない時は、私も実際に忙しいのだろうと思っていたのです。それから、忙しがらなくては当世流でないのだろうと、皮肉にも解釈していたのです。けれども財産の事について、時間の掛かかる話をしようという目的ができた眼で、この忙しがる様子を見ると、それが単に私を避ける口実としか受け取れなくなって来たのです。私は容易に叔父を捕つらまえる機会を得ませんでした。,"""I felt like I wouldn't be able to deal with my dead parents if I didn't know more about the property of the house I had left to my uncle. He claims to be from a busy body. As I did, I didn't stay in the same place every night. When I got home for two days, I lived in the city for three days, and I went back and forth between the two, and that day. I spent the day with a restless face, and I used the word busy as a habit. When I had no doubt, I was really busy. I was ironically interpreting that it wouldn't be modern if I had to be busy, but with the purpose of trying to talk about property in a time-consuming manner. Seeing how busy I was, I could only take it as an excuse to avoid me. I didn't have the opportunity to easily catch my uncle.","I decided that I owed it to my dead parents to obtain a detailed understanding of the house and property that I had until then left for my uncle to look after. My uncle presented himself as living a hectic life. He bustled endlessly between the town house and the country estate, spending perhaps one in three nights in town. Forever on the move, he made a great fuss about how busy he was. I had always taken him at his word, although I sometimes cynically suspected that he was following the modern fashion to appear busy. But now, with my newfound desire to find a time to talk through the question of property, I could only interpret this endless rush as an excuse to avoid me. I never had a chance to pin him down.","I thought that I owed it to my dead parents to find out from my uncle the details of the family fortune which I had left to his management. It seemed that he was as busy as he professed to be, for he never slept under the same roof for more than a few nights at a time. For every two days in our house, he would spend three in town. Whenever I saw him, I found him in a fidgety mood. “I am so busy, so busy . . .” he would automatically say, and then hurry away. Before I began to doubt him, I was inclined to believe that he was really busy, or, when in a cynical mood, I would tell myself that it was probably the latest fashion to appear busy. But after I had decided to have a long talk with him about my inheritance, I began to suspect that he was trying to avoid such a talk. At any rate, I did not find it easy to get hold of him."
私は慰藉いしゃの言葉さえ口へ出せなかった。,I couldn't even say the words of consolation.,"I was silent, unable to produce so much as a word of comfort.",Not even words of consolation came to my lips.
十四,fourteen,CHAPTER 68,What was also clear to me was that she wanted me to know she was no longer a child.
「先生は何とおっしゃるんですか」,"""What does the teacher say?""",“And what does he say?”,"“What does he say, when you ask him?”"
「お母さん一人じゃ、どうする事もできないだろう」と兄がまたいった。兄は私を土の臭においを嗅かいで朽ちて行っても惜しくないように見ていた。,"""I can't do anything with my mom alone,"" said her brother again. My brother looked at me as if he could smell the earth and decay.","“Mother won’t be able to cope with it on her own,” he went on. Apparently he was perfectly happy to let me rot here in the dank and dreary countryside.","My brother continued: “Mother can hardly manage things by herself, can she?” The prospect of my slowly crumbling away with the odor of earth clinging to me bothered him very little."
「だって丈夫なんですもの。ほとんど煩わずらった例ためしがないじゃありませんか。そりゃどうしたって私の方が先だわ」,"""Because it's tough. There's almost no annoying example. That's why I'm the first.""","You’re just fine. You’ve almost never had a day’s illness. No, it’s certainly going to be me first.”","“You are so healthy. You have hardly ever been ill. No doubt, I shall be the first to go.”"
奥さんは最初から、無人ぶにんで淋さむしいから、客を置いて世話をするのだと公言していました。私もそれを噓うそとは思いませんでした。懇意になって色々打ち明け話を聞いた後あとでも、そこに間違まちがいはなかったように思われます。しかし一般の経済状態は大して豊ゆたかだというほどではありませんでした。利害問題から考えてみて、私と特殊の関係をつけるのは、先方に取って決して損ではなかったのです。,"From the beginning, his wife professed to leave a guest and take care of him because he was unmanned and lonely. I didn't even think it was a lie. It seems that there was no mistake even after listening to various confessions in a friendly manner. However, the general economic situation was not so rich. In terms of interests, it was never a loss for the other party to have a special relationship with me.","Okusan had always stated that she had wanted a lodger to look after because the house was forlornly unpeopled. This did not seem a lie to me. Having grown close enough to become her confidant, I was now quite sure it was true. On the other hand, she was not particularly wealthy. From the point of view of her own interests, she certainly had nothing to lose by cultivating the relationship.","When Okusan first told me that loneliness was the reason why she had wanted a boarder, I believed her; and after I had come to know her well, I found no cause to change my mind. On the other hand, she was by no means a wealthy woman, and from the financial point of view, I was certainly not unattractive as a prospective son-in-law."
「私はその友達の名をここにＫと呼んでおきます。私はこのＫと小供こどもの時からの仲好なかよしでした。小供の時からといえば断らないでも解っているでしょう、二人には同郷の縁故があったのです。Ｋは真宗しんしゅうの坊さんの子でした。もっとも長男ではありません、次男でした。それである医者の所へ養子にやられたのです。私の生れた地方は大変本願寺派ほんがんじはの勢力の強い所でしたから、真宗の坊さんは他ほかのものに比べると、物質的に割が好かったようです。一例を挙げると、もし坊さんに女の子があって、その女の子が年頃としごろになったとすると、檀家だんかのものが相談して、どこか適当な所へ嫁にやってくれます。無論費用は坊さんの懐ふところから出るのではありません。そんな訳で真宗寺しんしゅうでらは大抵有福ゆうふくでした。,"""I'll call that friend K here. I've been good friends with this K since I was a child. , They had a relationship with their hometown. K was the son of Shinshu Shinshu's boy. He was not the eldest son, the second son. He was adopted by the doctor. The region where I was born was a very powerful place for the Honganji school, so it seems that Shinshu's boy was physically better than others. For example, if he was born. If there is a girl in the area and the girl is around the age, the Danya will consult and take her to a suitable place. Of course, the cost does not come from the boy's pocket. That's why Shinshu-ji was usually Yufuku Arifu.","I will call this friend of mine K. We had been friends since childhood. As you will no doubt realize from this, our native place was a bond between us. K was the son of a Pure Land Buddhist priest—but not the eldest son and heir, I should add, which is how he came to be adopted by a doctor’s family. The Hongan subsect had a very powerful presence in my home district, and its priests were better off than others. If the priest had a daughter of marriageable age, for instance, one of his parishioners would help to find her a suitable match, and the wedding expenses would of course not come out of his own pocket. Pure Land temple families were thus generally quite wealthy.","I shall here call my friend “K.” K and I were friends from the time we were children. Needless to say, then, we were from the same part of the country. K was the son of a priest of the Shinshu sect. He was the second son, and was sent as an adopted son to the house of a certain doctor. The Hongan church was very powerful in my native district, and so Shinshu priests were more affluent than the priests of other sects. For example, if a Shinshu priest happened to have a daughter of marrying age, he would have little trouble marrying her into a suitable family through the kind offices of a parishioner. Of course, wedding expenses would not come out of the priest’s pocket. For reasons such as this, Shinshu priests were generally quite prosperous."
十時頃ごろになって先生の靴の音が玄関に聞こえた時、奥さんは急に今までのすべてを忘れたように、前に坐すわっている私をそっちのけにして立ち上がった。そうして格子こうしを開ける先生をほとんど出合であい頭がしらに迎えた。私は取り残されながら、後あとから奥さんに尾ついて行った。下女げじょだけは仮寝うたたねでもしていたとみえて、ついに出て来なかった。,"Around ten o'clock, when I heard the sound of the teacher's shoes at the front door, my wife suddenly stood up, leaving me sitting in front of me, as if I had forgotten everything. Then, I almost met the teacher who opened the grid, and my head greeted me. I was left behind and followed my wife later. Only the maiden Gejo seemed to be taking a nap, so she didn't come out at last.","At around ten, when Sensei’s footsteps sounded in the entrance hall, she rose to her feet, all thoughts of me and our conversation seeming instantly forgotten. She was there to greet him as he slid open the lattice door, leaving me to follow her out. The maid, who must have been dozing in her room, failed to appear.","At about ten o’clock we heard Sensei’s footsteps approaching the front gate. Seeming to forget all that we had been talking about, Sensei’s wife quickly stood up and rushed out to meet him. I was left behind, as though my presence had been completely forgotten. I followed Sensei’s wife. The maid, who was probably dozing in her room, failed to appear in the front hall to greet her master."
私が着物を改めて席に着くか着かないうちに、奥さんも下女も帰って来ました。やがて晩食ばんめしの食卓でみんなが顔を合わせる時刻が来ました。下宿した当座は万事客扱いだったので、食事のたびに下女が膳ぜんを運んで来てくれたのですが、それがいつの間にか崩れて、飯時めしどきには向うへ呼ばれて行く習慣になっていたのです。Ｋが新しく引き移った時も、私が主張して彼を私と同じように取り扱わせる事に極きめました。その代り私は薄い板で造った足の畳たたみ込める華奢きゃしゃな食卓を奥さんに寄附きふしました。今ではどこの宅うちでも使っているようですが、その頃ころそんな卓の周囲に並んで飯を食う家族はほとんどなかったのです。私はわざわざ御茶おちゃの水みずの家具屋へ行って、私の工夫通りにそれを造り上あげさせたのです。,"Before I got back to my seat or not, my wife and maiden came back. Eventually, it was time for everyone to meet at the dinner table. The boarding house was treated as a guest for the time being, so my maiden brought me a set every time I had a meal, but it collapsed before I knew it, and I became a habit of being called away at mealtime. It was. When K moved in, I insisted that he be treated like me. Instead, I donated a delicate and delicate dining table made of thin plates to my wife. Nowadays, it seems to be used in every house, but at that time, few families lined up around such a table to eat. I took the trouble to go to the Ocha Ocha no Mizumizu furniture store and have them build it according to my ingenuity.","No sooner had I changed my clothes and settled down than Okusan and the maid returned. At length, the time came for us all to face one another over the evening meal. When I had first moved in as a lodger, they had treated me much like a guest, the maid serving dinner in my room, but this formality had broken down, and these days I was invited in to eat with the family. When K arrived, I insisted that he too be brought in for meals. In return I donated to the household a light and elegant dining table of thin wood, with foldable legs. These days one can find tables like this in any household, but back then there were almost no homes where everyone sat around such a thing to eat. I had gone especially to a furniture shop in Ochanomizu and ordered it made to my specifications.","I had hardly changed my clothes and settled down in my room when Okusan and the maid returned. Shortly thereafter, we sat down to dinner. Before I came to know the family well, it used to be the custom for the maid to bring all my meals to my room on a tray. But they soon ceased to treat me like a boarder, and I began to eat regularly with them. When K moved in, therefore, I asked them to invite him to join us at mealtimes. And to show my appreciation for doing as I asked, I bought them a light dining table made of thin wood, with folding legs. It would seem that such tables are to be found in all houses now, but in those days, there were very few families that owned them. I took the trouble of having one specially made by a furniture maker in Ochanomizu."
私は奥さんの態度をどっちかに片付かたづけてもらいたかったのです。頭の働きからいえば、それが明らかな矛盾に違いなかったのです。しかし叔父おじに欺あざむかれた記憶のまだ新しい私は、もう一歩踏み込んだ疑いを挟さしはさまずにはいられませんでした。私は奥さんのこの態度のどっちかが本当で、どっちかが偽いつわりだろうと推定しました。そうして判断に迷いました。ただ判断に迷うばかりでなく、何でそんな妙な事をするかその意味が私には呑のみ込めなかったのです。理由わけを考え出そうとしても、考え出せない私は、罪を女という一字に塗なすり付けて我慢した事もありました。必竟ひっきょう女だからああなのだ、女というものはどうせ愚ぐなものだ。私の考えは行き詰つまればいつでもここへ落ちて来ました。,"I wanted my wife's attitude to be cleared up somewhere. From the point of view of the work of the head, it must have been a clear contradiction. However, as a new memory of my uncle's deception, I couldn't help but wonder if I went one step further. I presumed that one of his wife's attitudes was true and one was false. Then I was at a loss. Not only did I get lost in my judgment, but I couldn't swallow the meaning of why I did such a strange thing. Even if I tried to come up with a reason, I couldn't come up with it. That's because it's a must-have woman, and a woman is stupid anyway. My thoughts have fallen here whenever I get stuck.","I needed Okusan to make her position clear. Rationally speaking, her attitudes were clearly contradictory. But with the memory of my uncle’s deceitfulness still so fresh , I could not repress another suspicion—that one of her two conflicting attitudes must be fake. I was at a loss to decide which was the real one, and I could make no sense of why she behaved so strangely. At times I chose simply to lay the fault entirely at the door of womanhood itself. When it comes down to it, I told myself, she’s acting this way because she’s a woman, and women are stupid. Whenever my cogitations arrived at a dead end, this answer was the one I reached for.","You see, I wanted to know precisely what her attitude was. From my point of view at least, her conduct was quite illogical. And having only recently been cheated by my uncle, I could not stop myself from suspecting Okusan of duplicity, and from assuming that one of her two attitudes was a deliberate deception. I could not understand the reason for her seemingly inconsistent behavior. “Why should she behave so strangely?” I would ask myself. And finding no answer to the question, I would angrily mutter to myself, “Women!” Then I would try to find comfort in the thought that Okusan behaved as she did because she was a woman, and women, after all, were idiots."
「兄さんが帰って来るのが順ですね」と私がいった。,"""It's the order that my brother comes back,"" I said.","“The elder son’s the one who ought to come back,” I said. “How could I do that?” he said, curtly dismissing the suggestion.","“It would be more proper if you, being the elder brother, came home,” I said. “How can I do a thing like that?” he said crossly."
こんな苦情をいう時ですら、奥さんは別に面倒めんどうくさいという顔をしなかった。,"Even when I made such a complaint, my wife didn't look like it was a hassle.","For all her complaints, however, she did not seem to resent the work.","But even when she complained thus, there seemed to be no real resentment in her voice."
私の留守の間、叔父はどんな風ふうに両方の間を往ゆき来していたか知りません。私の着いた時は、家族のものが、みんな一ひとつ家いえの内に集まっていました。学校へ出る子供などは平生へいぜいおそらく市の方にいたのでしょうが、これも休暇のために田舎いなかへ遊び半分といった格かくで引き取られていました。,"During my absence, my uncle doesn't know how he was going back and forth between the two. When I arrived, all the family members were gathered in the house. The children who went to school were probably in the city at most in Hirao, but they were also taken to the countryside for a vacation as if they were playful.","I do not know just how my uncle divided his time between the two places while I was away, but when I arrived in the summer, the whole family was gathered there under a single roof. I imagine that the children were there for the holidays, although they would have lived in town for most of the year to attend school.","I have no idea how my uncle divided his time between the two residences during my absence. At any rate, when I arrived, he and his whole family were living in my house. I suppose that those of his children who were still at school lived normally in the town house, but had been brought to our house in the country for the holidays."
「奥さんのこの態度が自然私の気分に影響して来ました。しばらくするうちに、私の眼はもとほどきょろ付かなくなりました。自分の心が自分の坐すわっている所に、ちゃんと落ち付いているような気にもなれました。要するに奥さん始め家うちのものが、僻ひがんだ私の眼や疑い深い私の様子に、てんから取り合わなかったのが、私に大きな幸福を与えたのでしょう。私の神経は相手から照り返して来る反射のないために段々静まりました。,"""This attitude of my wife has naturally influenced my mood. After a while, my eyes weren't as sloppy as I was. Where my heart was sitting. I felt like I was calm down. In short, my wife and my family didn't keep up with my distorted eyes and my suspicious appearance, which gave me great happiness. Maybe I gave it. My nerves gradually calmed down because there was no reflection from the other person.","Okusan’s warm perception of me inevitably started to influence my state of mind. After a while my glances became less mistrustful, and my heart felt more tranquil and settled within me. This new happiness I owed, in effect, to the way Okusan and the rest of the household turned a blind eye on all my wariness and shifty glances. No one reacted nervously to me, and so my own nerves grew steadily calmer.","It seems that Okusan, in the way that women have, was apt to assume that my attitude towards money was an indication of the generosity of my heart. Okusan’s manner towards me gradually changed my own state of mind. I became less shifty, and began to feel more relaxed. I suppose the fact that Okusan and the rest of the household took no notice of my suspicious and withdrawn manner gave me great comfort. Since there was nothing in my surroundings that seemed to justify watchfulness, I began to calm down."
上野うえのから帰った晩は、私に取って比較的安静な夜よでした。私はＫが室へやへ引き上げたあとを追い懸けて、彼の机の傍そばに坐すわり込みました。そうして取り留めもない世間話をわざと彼に仕向けました。彼は迷惑そうでした。私の眼には勝利の色が多少輝いていたでしょう、私の声にはたしかに得意の響きがあったのです。私はしばらくＫと一つ火鉢に手を翳かざした後あと、自分の室に帰りました。外ほかの事にかけては何をしても彼に及ばなかった私も、その時だけは恐るるに足りないという自覚を彼に対してもっていたのです。,"The night I returned from Ueno was a relatively quiet night for me. I ran after K pulled up into the room and sat down by his desk. Then he deliberately directed an unreserved small talk to him. He looked annoying. The color of victory would have shined a little in my eyes, and my voice certainly had a good sound. After holding my hand over K and one brazier for a while, I returned to my room. Even though I couldn't do anything else to him, I was aware that it was scary at that time.","For me, that evening was relatively peaceful. I followed K to his room, settled myself beside his desk, and deliberately chattered on for a while about nothing in particular. He looked annoyed. No doubt a light of victory glinted in my eye, and my voice held a note of triumph. After I’d spent some time warming my hands over his brazier, I returned to my room. Just for that moment I felt that, though K was in every way superior to me, for once I had nothing to fear from him.","That evening, after our walk to Ueno, I felt unusually relieved. I quickly got up from the table, and followed K into his room. I sat down by his desk, and began to chatter about some trivial matter. He looked pained. It is possible that my eyes betrayed the triumph that I was then feeling. I know that there was a note of self-congratulation in my voice. A few minutes later, I withdrew my hands from the brazier, and returned to my room. For the first time in my life, I felt that in one matter at least, I was more than a match for K."
「私は思い切って自分の心をＫに打ち明けようとしました。もっともこれはその時に始まった訳でもなかったのです。旅に出ない前から、私にはそうした腹ができていたのですけれども、打ち明ける機会をつらまえる事も、その機会を作り出す事も、私の手際てぎわでは旨うまくゆかなかったのです。今から思うと、その頃私の周囲にいた人間はみんな妙でした。女に関して立ち入った話などをするものは一人もありませんでした。中には話す種たねをもたないのも大分だいぶいたでしょうが、たといもっていても黙っているのが普通のようでした。比較的自由な空気を呼吸している今のあなたがたから見たら、定めし変に思われるでしょう。それが道学どうがくの余習よしゅうなのか、または一種のはにかみなのか、判断はあなたの理解に任せておきます。,"""I dared to confide my heart to K. But this didn't even start at that time. I was hungry before I went on a journey, Neither the opportunity to confide nor the creation of that opportunity went well with my dexterity. From now on, all the people around me at that time were strange. There was no one to talk about. It would have been pretty good to have no seeds to talk to, but it seemed normal to be silent. Relatively free. From the point of view of you breathing the air, it may seem strange to you. It's up to you to decide whether it's a scholarly lesson or a kind of humor. I will leave it.","Summoning up my courage, I decided to confess to K what was in my heart. It was not the first time I had reached this decision. It had been my plan since before our trip together, in fact, but so far I had had the skill neither to seize an appropriate moment nor to create one. It strikes me now that the people I knew back then were all a bit peculiar—no one around me ever spoke about private matters of the heart. No doubt quite a few had nothing to confide, but even those who did kept silent. This must seem most peculiar to you, in the relative freedom of your present age. I will leave it to you to judge whether it was a lingering effect from the Confucianism of an earlier time or simply a form of shyness.","I decided to confide my secret to K. Actually, I had been wanting to do so for some time. But I had found myself incapable, when talking to K, of seizing, or creating, the right moment to introduce the subject casually. When I think about it, my acquaintances in those days were all rather odd. There was not one among them that showed any inclination to discuss his own romantic problems without restraint. I suppose many of them really had nothing to talk about. At any rate, it would seem that it was the custom not to exchange confidences concerning women. You, who are used to a more liberal atmosphere, must think this strange. Whether we were still under the influence of Confucian teachings, or whether we were only being shy, I shall leave you to decide for yourself."
「なぜだか今に解ります。今にじゃない、もう解っているはずです。あなたの心はとっくの昔からすでに恋で動いているじゃありませんか」,"""I understand why now. It's not now, you should already know. Your heart has been in love for a long time, hasn't it?""","“You’ll understand soon enough. No, you must already understand it. Your heart is already restless with love, isn’t it?”","“You will soon find out. In fact, you ought to know already. Your heart has been made restless by love for quite some time now.”"
私は東京の事を考えた。そうして漲みなぎる心臓の血潮の奥に、活動活動と打ちつづける鼓動こどうを聞いた。不思議にもその鼓動の音が、ある微妙な意識状態から、先生の力で強められているように感じた。,"I thought about Tokyo. Then, in the depths of the heart's blood, I heard the heartbeat that continues to be active. Mysteriously, I felt that the sound of the heartbeat was strengthened by the power of the teacher from a certain subtle state of consciousness.","Whenever I thought about Tokyo, I felt the blood that pumped strongly through my heart pulsing to a rhythm that cried “Action! Action!” Strangely, through some subtle mechanism of the mind, this inner pulse seemed to be empowered by Sensei.","I thought of Tokyo. And it seemed that with each heartbeat, the yearning within me for action increased. In a strange way, I felt as if Sensei was by my side, encouraging me to get up and go."
「いいえ私も嫌われている一人なんです」,"""No, I'm one of those hated too.""","“Oh, no. He feels that way about me too.”",“Certainly not. I am like all the rest in his eyes.”
「君の兄弟きょうだいは何人でしたかね」と先生が聞いた。,"""How many of your siblings were you?"" Asked the teacher.",“How many brothers and sisters did you say you had?” he asked.,“How many brothers and sisters did you say you had?” asked Sensei.
八,Eight,CHAPTER 44,No opportunity ever arose for me to approach him about my share of the estate as Sensei had advised.
「どうも様子が少し変だからなるべく傍そばにいるようにしなくっちゃいけないよ」と注意した。,"""It looks a little weird, so I have to be as close as possible,"" he cautioned.","he asked sharply, challenging me almost like a watch guard. “We must try to be constantly with him. He seems in bad shape.”","he said, sounding rather like a sentry on duty. “He looks very bad, you know. You must try to stay with him as much as possible.”"
私はＫに手紙を見せました。Ｋは何ともいいませんでしたけれども、自分の所へこの姉から同じような意味の書状が二、三度来たという事を打ち明けました。Ｋはそのたびに心配するに及ばないと答えてやったのだそうです。運悪くこの姉は生活に余裕のない家に片付いたために、いくらＫに同情があっても、物質的に弟をどうしてやる訳にも行かなかったのです。,"I showed K a letter. K didn't say anything, but he confessed that he had received a letter of similar meaning from this sister a couple of times. K said that he didn't have to worry about it each time. Unfortunately, this older sister was tidied up in a house where she couldn't afford to live, so no matter how much she had sympathy for K, she couldn't physically do anything about her younger brother.","I showed the letter to K. He said nothing in direct response, but he did tell me that he had received two or three such letters from his sister herself, and that he had replied that she need not be concerned for him. She had married into a household that did not have much money, so unfortunately she was not in a position to offer financial help, much as she sympathized with him.","I showed the letter to K. He made no comment, except that he himself had received two or three letters similar in content from his sister, and that he had written back saying that there was no need to worry. Unfortunately, his sister had not married into a well-to-do family. Though she sympathized with K, she could give him no material assistance."
「なぜ」,"""why""",“Why?”,“Why?”
先生は一時非常の読書家であったが、その後ごどういう訳か、前ほどこの方面に興味が働かなくなったようだと、かつて奥さんから聞いた事があるのを、私はその時ふと思い出した。私は論文をよそにして、そぞろに口を開いた。,"The teacher was a very reader at one point, but then I suddenly remembered hearing from his wife that for some reason he wasn't as interested in this area as he used to be. I turned away from the dissertation and opened my mouth.","I recalled then that his wife had said that he had once been a great reader, but for some reason his interest had waned considerably. My thesis momentarily forgotten, I spontaneously asked, “Why aren’t you as interested in books as you used to be, Sensei?”","When Sensei said this, I remembered the remark his wife once made to me that though Sensei was once an avid reader, he had since lost his old interest in books. Forgetting my thesis for the moment, I said to Sensei:"
私は移った日に、その室の床とこに活いけられた花と、その横に立て懸かけられた琴ことを見ました。どっちも私の気に入りませんでした。私は詩や書や煎茶せんちゃを嗜たしなむ父の傍そばで育ったので、唐からめいた趣味を小供こどものうちからもっていました。そのためでもありましょうか、こういう艶なまめかしい装飾をいつの間にか軽蔑けいべつする癖が付いていたのです。,"On the day I moved, I saw the flowers on the floor of the room and the kins hanging beside them. Neither did I like it. I grew up near my father, who enjoyed poetry, calligraphy, and sencha sencha, so I had a hobby from the Tang dynasty among my small children. Perhaps because of that, I had a habit of despising such a lustrous decoration before I knew it.","On the day I arrived, I noted the flowers arranged in the alcove, and a koto propped beside them.1 I did not care for either. I had been brought up by a father who appreciated the Chinese style of poetry, calligraphy, and tea-making, and since childhood my own tastes had also tended toward the Chinese. Perhaps for this reason I despised this sort of merely charming decorativeness.","As soon as I moved into the room, I noticed a vase of flowers in the alcove. A koto2 stood against the wall of the alcove, next to the flowers. Neither the flowers nor the koto pleased me. Having been brought up by a father who was fond of such things as Chinese poetry, calligraphy, and the tea ceremony, I was from childhood inclined to severity in my taste. I had learned to be contemptuous of such obvious attempts at charm as I found in the alcove."
「恋に上のぼる楷段かいだんなんです。異性と抱き合う順序として、まず同性の私の所へ動いて来たのです」,"""It's a romance that goes up in love. As an order to hug the opposite sex, I first moved to my place of the same sex.""",But that isn’t love.” “It’s a step in the direction of love. You had the impulse to find someone of the same sex as the first step toward embracing someone of the opposite sex.”,But my going to you was not the same thing as wanting to fall in love.” “But it was a step in your life towards love. The friendship that you sought in me is in reality a preparation for the love that you will seek in a woman.”
「お前は今日東京へ行くはずじゃなかったか」と父が聞いた。,"""You should have been to Tokyo today,"" my father asked.",“Wasn’t this the day you were going back to Tokyo?” my father inquired.,“Were you not going to Tokyo today?” asked my father later that day.
先生と私とは博物館の裏から鶯渓うぐいすだにの方角に静かな歩調で歩いて行った。垣の隙間すきまから広い庭の一部に茂る熊笹くまざさが幽邃ゆうすいに見えた。,"The teacher and I walked from the back of the museum in the direction of Uguisuda in a quiet pace. From the gap between the fences, the bamboo strips that grow in a part of the large garden looked like Yuusui.","We walked on quietly past the back of the museum and headed toward Uguisudani. Through gaps in the hedge we caught glimpses of the spacious gardens, crowded thick with dwarf bamboo, secluded and mysterious.","Sensei and I walked slowly in the direction of Uguisudani, past the back of the museum. Through the gaps in the fencing, we could see dwarf bamboos growing thickly in one part of the garden. There was about the scene an air of deep, secluded peace."
急いだためでもありましょうが、我々は帰り路みちにはほとんど口を聞きませんでした。宅うちへ帰って食卓に向った時、奥さんはどうして遅くなったのかと尋ねました。私はＫに誘われて上野うえのへ行ったと答えました。奥さんはこの寒いのにといって驚いた様子を見せました。お嬢さんは上野に何があったのかと聞きたがります。私は何もないが、ただ散歩したのだという返事だけしておきました。平生へいぜいから無口なＫは、いつもよりなお黙っていました。奥さんが話しかけても、お嬢さんが笑っても、碌ろくな挨拶あいさつはしませんでした。それから飯めしを呑のみ込むように搔かき込んで、私がまだ席を立たないうちに、自分の室へやへ引き取りました。,"Perhaps because we were in a hurry, we barely heard on the way home. When I got home and headed to the table, my wife asked me why I was late. I answered that I was invited by K to go to Ueno Ueno. His wife looked surprised at the cold weather. The young lady wants to ask what happened to Ueno. I didn't have anything, but I just replied that I was taking a walk. K, who is silent at best in Hirao, was more silent than usual. Even if my wife talked to me or my daughter laughed, I didn't give a gorgeous greeting. Then I swallowed the rice and swallowed it, and before I left my seat, I took it to my room.","We barely spoke on our way home, though our haste might explain this silence. When we were back and seated at the dinner table, Okusan asked why we had been late. I replied that K had invited me out, and we had gone to Ueno. On such a cold day? said Okusan in surprise. Ojōsan wondered what had taken us there. Nothing, I replied simply, we had just gone for a walk. Always taciturn, K now spoke even less than usual. He failed to make the slightest response to Okusan’s cajolings and Ojōsan’s smiles. He gulped down his food, and retired to his room while I was still at the table.","We hardly spoke to each other on our way home. Perhaps this was because we were in such a hurry to get back. At dinner, Okusan asked us, “Why were you so late?” I said that K had asked me to walk with him to Ueno. Okusan seemed surprised, and said, “But it’s so cold!” Ojosan asked, “Why Ueno? Was there something in Ueno you wanted to see?” “No,” I said, “we were simply taking a walk.” K said even less that night than usual. Okusan spoke to him; Ojosan laughed at him; but he would not respond. He gulped his food down and went back to his room, leaving us at the table."
こういう父の顔には深い掛念けねんの曇くもりがかかっていた。こういわれる私の胸にはまた父がいつ斃たおれるか分らないという心配がひらめいた。,"There was a deep cloudy cloud on my father's face. In my heart, I was worried that I wouldn't know when my father would fall.","My father’s expression was clouded with apprehension. At his words, I felt a sudden flicker of anxiety that he might die at any time.","I could see deep anxiety on his face as he said this, and I thought to myself, “How long will it be before he faints again?” “But I am sure His Majesty will be all right,” my father said."
この知識は私にとって新しいものであった。私は不思議に思った。,This knowledge was new to me. I wondered.,I was struck by this new piece of information.,"This, I had not known. I thought it rather curious."
冬休みが来るにはまだ少し間まがあった。私は学期の終りまで待っていても差支さしつかえあるまいと思って一日二日そのままにしておいた。するとその一日二日の間に、父の寝ている様子だの、母の心配している顔だのが時々眼に浮かんだ。そのたびに一種の心苦しさを嘗なめた私は、とうとう帰る決心をした。国から旅費を送らせる手数てかずと時間を省くため、私は暇乞いとまごいかたがた先生の所へ行って、要いるだけの金を一時立て替えてもらう事にした。,"It was still a while before winter vacation came. I left it for a day or two, thinking it would be okay to wait until the end of the semester. Then, during the day and two, I sometimes saw my father's sleeping face and my mother's worried face. Every time I licked a kind of pain, I finally decided to go home. In order to save time and effort to send travel expenses from the country, I decided to go to the teacher who was begging for leisure and to have him temporarily reimburse as much money as he needed.","The winter vacation would soon begin, and feeling that I could safely wait out the term, I let the matter slide from one day to the next. But as the days passed, images of my bedridden father and my anxious mother kept rising before my eyes, provoking such an ache in my heart that finally I decided I must go home. To avoid having to wait while the money was sent from home, I went to visit Sensei to borrow the amount for my fare. Besides, I wanted to bid him farewell.","The winter vacation was not far off, and thinking that there was no need for me to return immediately, I decided to stay on till the end of term. A day or two after the arrival of my mother’s letter, however, I began to worry. I thought of my father lying in bed, and of my mother worrying, and I decided that I should return at once. I did not have enough money with me for the train fare and, in order to avoid the inconvenience of having to write home for it and wait for its arrival, I decided to go to Sensei for a loan. I wanted, in any case, to pay him a farewell visit."
先生と奥さんの間に起った波瀾はらんが、大したものでない事はこれでも解わかった。それがまた滅多めったに起る現象でなかった事も、その後絶えず出入でいりをして来た私にはほぼ推察ができた。それどころか先生はある時こんな感想すら私に洩もらした。,"I understood that the turbulence that occurred between the teacher and his wife was not a big deal. It was almost inferred to me, who has been constantly coming and going since then, that it was not a rare phenomenon. On the contrary, the teacher once leaked even such an impression to me.","They told me that the trouble between Sensei and his wife was nothing serious. And I felt it safe to conclude, from my subsequent constant comings and goings at the house, that such quarrels were actually rare. Indeed, Sensei once confided to me, “I have only ever known one woman in my life.","I knew then that the disagreement which had occurred between them was not very serious. I continued to visit them regularly, and I could see that it had been an exceptional occurrence. Moreover, he took me into his confidence one day and said:"
「叔父さん、はいって来る時、家うちに誰だれもいなかったかい」と聞いた。,"""Uncle, wasn't there anyone in the house when he came in?""","“There was no one in the house when you came in, sir?” he asked.","“Sir,” he said, “was there no one in the house when you came by?”"
奥さんは私に「結構ね。さぞお父とうさんやお母かあさんはお喜びでしょう」といってくれた。私は突然病気の父の事を考えた。早くあの卒業証書を持って行って見せてやろうと思った。,"My wife said to me, ""It's fine. My dad and mom would be happy."" I suddenly thought of my sick father. I thought I'd take that diploma and show it to me as soon as possible.","“Well done,” his wife said to me. “Your father and mother must be very happy.” Suddenly the image of my sick father rose in my mind. I had to hurry home and show him my diploma, I decided.","Sensei’s wife was good enough to say, “Well done. Your father and mother must be pleased.” I was suddenly reminded of my sick father by this remark, and thought, “I must hurry home and show my diploma to him.”"
私はなるべく彼に逆さからわない方針を取りました。私は氷を日向ひなたへ出して溶とかす工夫をしたのです。今に融とけて温かい水になれば、自分で自分に気が付く時機が来るに違いないと思ったのです。,I took the policy of not being upside down to him as much as possible. I devised a way to melt the ice by taking it out to Hinata Hinata. I thought it would be time for me to notice myself if the water melted and became warm.,"I decided to do my best not to argue, however. My aim was to apply a sunny warmth that would thaw his ice. Once the melted water began to trickle, I thought, he would sooner or later come to his senses.","I decided that the best thing for me to do was to avoid arguing with him at all costs. I decided to leave the piece of ice out in the sun, and wait until it had melted and turned into warm water."
奥さんは手に紅茶茶碗こうちゃぢゃわんを持ったまま、笑いながらそこに立っていた。,"His wife stood there with a laugh, holding a tea bowl and a bowl in her hand.","She laughed as she stood there, the teacup still in her hand.","She remained standing, with a European teacup in her hand, and laughed."
「イゴイストはいけないね。何もしないで生きていようというのは横着な了簡りょうけんだからね。人は自分のもっている才能をできるだけ働かせなくっちゃ噓うそだ」,"""Don't be an egoist. It's a lie to live without doing anything. People have to use their talents as much as possible.""",“Egoists are worthless types. It’s sheer brazen laziness to spend your life doing nothing. A man’s talent amounts to nothing if he won’t set it to work and do all he can with it.”,"“That’s the trouble with egoists,”5 he said. “They are brazen enough to think they have the right to live idly. It’s a crime not to make the best use of whatever ability one has.”"
時とするとまた非常に淋さみしがった。,Sometimes I was very lonely again.,But sometimes he grew deeply dejected.,"But sometimes, my father would become very sad, and say: “When I die, please look after your mother.”"
「妻が考えているような人間なら、私だってこんなに苦しんでいやしない」,"""If my wife thinks of a person, I wouldn't heal so much.""","“If I was the sort of person she thinks I am,” he said, “I wouldn’t be suffering like this.”","“If I were the sort of person she thinks I am, I would not suffer so.”"
二人とも父の病気について、色々掛念けねんの問いを繰り返してくれた中に、先生はこんな事をいった。,The teacher said something like this while both of them repeatedly asked various questions about their father's illness.,Both of them questioned me at length and with great concern about my father’s illness.,They were both kind enough to ask after my father.
奥さんの方でも思い切って遠慮のない事をいうことがあった。しかしその日は、時候が時候なので、そんなに調戯からかわれるほど食欲が進まなかった。,"Even my wife sometimes took the plunge and said something unreserved. However, on that day, the weather was the weather, so my appetite did not progress so much that I was teased by the play.","she would say teasingly, completely unabashed at her own directness. But that day, with the summer heat beginning, my normally large appetite deserted me.","That evening, however, I gave her no opportunity to tease me. It being summer, I did not have much of an appetite."
すると夏の暑い盛りに明治天皇めいじてんのうが崩御ほうぎょになりました。その時私は明治の精神が天皇に始まって天皇に終ったような気がしました。最も強く明治の影響を受けた私どもが、その後あとに生き残っているのは必竟ひっきょう時勢遅れだという感じが烈はげしく私の胸を打ちました。私は明白あからさまに妻にそういいました。妻は笑って取り合いませんでしたが、何を思ったものか、突然私に、では殉死じゅんしでもしたらよかろうと調戯からかいました。,"Then, in the hot summer months, Emperor Meiji's Meiji Tennou became a demise of the crown. At that time, I felt that the spirit of the Meiji era began with the emperor and ended with the emperor. The feeling that we, who were most strongly influenced by the Meiji era, were inevitably behind in time to survive after that, struck my heart violently. I obviously said so to my wife. My wife laughed and didn't fight, but suddenly I wondered what she thought, and then suddenly asked me if I should have died.","And then, at the height of the summer, Emperor Meiji passed away.1 I felt then that as the spirit of the Meiji era had begun with him, so it had ended with his death. I was struck with an overwhelming sense that my generation, we who had felt Meiji’s influence most deeply, were doomed to linger on simply as anachronisms as long as we remained alive. When I said this in so many words to my wife, she laughed it off. But then for some reason she added teasingly, “Well, then, you could follow the old style and die with your lord, couldn’t you.”","Then at the height of the summer, Emperor Meiji passed away. I felt as though the spirit of the Meiji era had begun with the Emperor, and had ended with him. I was overcome with the feeling that I and the others, who had been brought up in that era, were now left behind to live as anachronisms. I told my wife so. She laughed and refused to take me seriously."
「若いうちほど淋さむしいものはありません。そんならなぜあなたはそうたびたび私の宅うちへ来るのですか」,"""Nothing is as lonely as when you were young. Why do you come to my house so often?""",“No time is as lonely as youth. Why else should you visit me so often?”,“Youth is the loneliest time of all. Otherwise why should you come so often to my house?”
兄と前後して着いた妹いもとの夫の意見は、我々よりもよほど楽観的であった。父は彼に向かって妹の事をあれこれと尋ねていた。「身体からだが身体だからむやみに汽車になんぞ乗って揺ゆれない方が好い。無理をして見舞に来られたりすると、かえってこっちが心配だから」といっていた。「なに今に治ったら赤ん坊の顔でも見に、久しぶりにこっちから出掛けるから差支さしつかえない」ともいっていた。,"The opinion of my younger sister, Imoto's husband, who arrived before and after his brother, was much more optimistic than we were. My father asked him about his sister. ""It's from the body, but because it's the body, it's better not to get on the train unnecessarily and shake. If you force yourself to come to visit us, you're rather worried about this,"" he said. ""If I'm healed now, I'll go out from here for the first time in a while to see the baby's face, so I can't help it,"" he said.","He was far more optimistic than we were. My father had asked him a number of questions about my sister. “You mustn’t let her rock about in trains, in her condition,” he had told him. “It would only be a worry for me if she endangered herself by coming to see me.” And he added, “Don’t worry, I’ll be better in no time, and then I’ll take the trip up there myself for a change and meet the baby.”","My brother-in-law, who had arrived at about the same time as my brother, was more optimistic than any of us. My father asked him many questions about my sister, and then said: “In her condition, it is wise to avoid such discomforts as a train journey. I would have been worried, rather than pleased, had she gone to the trouble of coming to see me.” He then added: “After all, I can always visit her myself, when I am better, and have a good look at the baby.”"
私は飯を終しまって烟草タバコを吹かし出しました。私が立たないので奥さんも火鉢の傍そばを離れる訳にゆきません。下女げじょを呼んで膳ぜんを下げさせた上、鉄瓶てつびんに水を注さしたり、火鉢の縁ふちを拭ふいたりして、私に調子を合わせています。私は奥さんに特別な用事でもあるのかと問いました。奥さんはいいえと答えましたが、今度は向うでなぜですと聞き返して来ました。私は実は少し話したい事があるのだといいました。奥さんは何ですかといって、私の顔を見ました。奥さんの調子はまるで私の気分にはいり込めないような軽いものでしたから、私は次に出すべき文句も少し渋りました。,"I finished the rice and started smoking cigarettes. My wife can't leave the brazier because I can't stand. I called my maiden to lower the table, then poured water into the iron kettle and wiped the edge of the brazier to keep me in tune. I asked my wife if it was also a special occasion. The wife answered no, but this time she asked me why. I said that I actually have something to talk about. I asked what my wife was and looked at my face. My wife's condition was so light that I couldn't get into my mood, so I was a little reluctant to complain next.","I finished the meal and lit a cigarette. Okusan could not leave until I rose, so she sat on beside the brazier. The maid was called in to remove the dishes, while Okusan kept me company, busying herself with topping up the kettle or wiping the rim of the brazier as she sat there. “Is there something you ought to be doing?” I asked. “No,” she said, then inquired why I wanted to know. “Actually,” I replied, “I have something I’d like to discuss.” “What is it?” she said casually, her eyes on my face. She was treating the moment lightly, apparently unreceptive to my mood, and I faltered over how to proceed.","When the meal was over, I lit a cigarette. Okusan was obliged to remain seated by the brazier: she could hardly leave the room before I did. She called the maid, and had her take the tray. For lack of anything better to do, Okusan poured water into the iron kettle, and then began polishing the brazier. I said: “Okusan, are you busy?” “No,” she said; then, “Why do you ask?” “Well,” I said, “there’s something I should like to talk to you about.” “Yes?” she said, watching me. Okusan’s manner was so casual that I began to lose courage."

「あるというほどありゃしません」,"""There isn't much""","“Not particularly, no.”","“Well, I don’t suppose what we have could be described as a fortune.”"
奥さんの言葉は少し手痛てひどかった。しかしその言葉の耳障みみざわりからいうと、決して猛烈なものではなかった。自分に頭脳のある事を相手に認めさせて、そこに一種の誇りを見出みいだすほどに奥さんは現代的でなかった。奥さんはそれよりもっと底の方に沈んだ心を大事にしているらしく見えた。,"His wife's words were a little painful and terrible. However, in terms of the jarring feeling of the word, it was by no means ferocious. His wife wasn't modern enough to let the other person admit that he had a brain and find a kind of pride in it. His wife seemed to cherish the heart that sank to the bottom more than that.","I’m always amazed at how men can go on and on, happily passing around the empty cup of some futile discussion.” Her words struck me as rather severe, although not particularly offensive. She was not one of those modern women who takes a certain pride in calling attention to the fact that she is intelligent. She seemed to value far more the heart that lies deep within us.","Her words, I thought, were a little harsh. But they did not seem offensive to me. Sensei’s wife was not so modern a woman as to take pride and pleasure in being able to display her mental prowess. She valued far more that thing which lies buried in the bottom of one’s heart."
私はやや安心した。私の変化を凝じっと見ていた先生は、それからこう付け足した。,"I was a little relieved. The teacher, who was watching my changes, then added:","I felt somewhat comforted. Seeing this change in me, Sensei added, “But sick or well, humans are fragile creatures, you know.","I was somewhat comforted by Sensei’s last remarks.
