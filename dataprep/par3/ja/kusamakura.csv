障子をあけた時にはそんな事には気がつかなかった。あの声はと、耳の走る見当を見破ると――向うにいた。花ならば海棠かと思わるる幹を背に、よそよそしくも月の光りを忍んで朦朧たる影法師がいた。あれかと思う意識さえ、確とは心にうつらぬ間に、黒いものは花の影を踏み砕いて右へ切れた。わがいる部屋つづきの棟の角が、すらりと動く、背の高い女姿を、すぐに遮ってしまう。,"I didn't notice such a thing when I opened the shoji. That voice, when I saw the idea of running my ears-was over there. With a trunk that seems to be a sea basin if it is a flower, there was a shadow master who was dimly sneaking in the light of the moon. Even the consciousness that I thought was uncertain, the black one trampled the shadow of the flower and cut to the right. The corner of the ridge that continues to my room immediately blocks the slender figure of a tall woman.","When I first slide open the paper doors, I notice none of this. Where is that voice? My eyes seek the place where my eager ears have already guessed the answer lies—and there it stands, a vague shadowy shape withdrawn from the moonlight, its back to the trunk of what, judging from the blossoms, might be an aronia tree. Before I have even an instant to try to comprehend what it is, the black shape turns and moves off to the right, trampling the shadow of the blossoms as it goes. Then a tall woman’s form slides fluidly around the corner, and the edge of the building that my own room is part of hides her instantly from sight.","I did not of course notice such things as these immediately upon opening the shōji. I peered straight ahead of me in the direction from which my probing ear told me the voice was coming. There reclining against the trunk of what, judging by the blossoms, I took to be an aronia, was a dim shadow which appeared to shun all contact with the moonlight. I had my wits about me sufficiently to notice this, but before it could really register properly, the black shape moved sharply away to the right, crushing the shadows of blossom underfoot as it went. I had a fleeting glimpse of the tall smoothly gliding figure of a woman, before she was hidden from view by an angle of the overhanging roof."

ええの二字では少し物足らなかったが、その上掘って聞く必要もないから控えた。障子を見ると、蘭の影が少し位置を変えている。,"Yes, the two letters were a little unsatisfactory, but I didn't have to dig up and listen to them. Looking at the shoji, the shadow of the orchid has changed its position a little.","This monosyllable isn’t an entirely satisfactory response, but there seems no need to delve further, so I hold my tongue. Glancing at the papered window, I register that the shadow of the aspidistra has shifted.","Although I felt this monosyllable to be scarcely an adequate answer, I had no reason to pry into his affairs, so I let the matter rest.

放心と無邪気とは余裕を示す。余裕は画において、詩において、もしくは文章において、必須の条件である。今代芸術の一大弊竇は、いわゆる文明の潮流が、いたずらに芸術の士を駆って、拘々として随処に齷齪たらしむるにある。裸体画はその好例であろう。都会に芸妓と云うものがある。色を売りて、人に媚びるを商売にしている。彼らは嫖客に対する時、わが容姿のいかに相手の瞳子に映ずるかを顧慮するのほか、何らの表情をも発揮し得ぬ。年々に見るサロンの目録はこの芸妓に似たる裸体美人を以て充満している。彼らは一秒時も、わが裸体なるを忘るる能わざるのみならず、全身の筋肉をむずつかして、わが裸体なるを観者に示さんと力めている。,"Absent-mindedness and innocence show a margin. Margin is an essential condition in painting, poetry, or writing. One of the major mischiefs of modern art is that the so-called trend of civilization unnecessarily drives an art scholar and sneaks everywhere. Nude painting is a good example. There is something called a geisha in the city. It sells colors and makes it a business to flirt with people. In addition to paying attention to how my appearance is reflected in the other person's pupils, they cannot show any facial expressions when dealing with clients. The annual list of salons is filled with nude beauties that resemble this geisha. Not only are they able to forget about my nakedness for a second, but they also squeeze the muscles of their whole body to show their nakedness to the viewer.","Reverie and innocence signify composure of mind, which is a necessary condition for painting, poetry, and indeed literature in general. The greatest evil in our present age of art is that the tide of civilization has swept artists along on its crest, goading them to an incessant state of pettiness and fussiness. The nude in art is a good example. The city has what are known as geisha, who trade in the art of flirtation and the erotic. In their dealings with the client, their only expressions are those calculated to make themselves appear as attractive as possible to him. Year after year the catalogs of our galleries are filled with nude beauties who resemble these geisha. Never for an instant do they forget their nakedness; indeed, their flesh squirms with the effort to display it to the viewer.","From Perfection there is only one road—down.' Placidity and simplicity both indicate the presence of that underlying depth which is an indispensible ingredient of art and literature. The shortcomings of modern art may be attributed to the way in which the so-called tide of civilisation is indiscriminately sweeping aside the 'old guard' in its impatient haste to advance. Nude paintings provide a good example of this. In the cities we have Geisha, those women who trade on their physical charms, and to whom the art of flattery is a means of earning a living. When they are with a 'client', their sole expression is one of anxiously trying to impress him with their appearance. The nude beauties who fill the perennial salon catalogues to overflowing are similar to these Geisha. Not only are they unable to forget their own nakedness, but they use to the uttermost every muscle in their bodies to make the viewer aware of it."

どこへ腰を据えたものかと、草のなかを遠近と徘徊する。椽から見たときは画になると思った景色も、いざとなると存外纏まらない。色もしだいに変ってくる。草原をのそつくうちに、いつしか描く気がなくなった。描かぬとすれば、地位は構わん、どこへでも坐った所がわが住居である。染み込んだ春の日が、深く草の根に籠って、どっかと尻を卸すと、眼に入らぬ陽炎を踏み潰したような心持ちがする。,"I wander around in the grass, wondering where I settled down. The scenery that I thought would be a picture when viewed from the rafters does not come together unexpectedly when it comes to it. The color will gradually change. As I sank through the meadow, I didn't feel like drawing. If I don't draw it, I don't care about my position, and the place where I sit everywhere is my residence. When the soaked spring day goes deep into the grassroots and pulls out my hips, I feel like I've trampled the heat haze that I can't see.","I wander through the grass, looking for a place to settle myself down. The landscape that looked so suitable for painting when viewed from my balcony also seems suddenly to have lost its unity and coherence. Its color too is gradually fading. As I plod stupidly hither and yon in this fashion, all desire to paint deserts me. With the need to paint gone, the selection of a place no longer matters—wherever I choose to sit will become my home. The warmth of the spring sunlight has penetrated to the roots of the grass, and as I plump myself down, I sense that I am inadvertently crushing beneath me an invisible shimmer of heat haze.","I wandered here and there through the grass looking for a suitable place to sit. The scenery, which when seen from the verandah had seemed a good subject for a picture, now appeared to be disappointingly unsettled. The colours too were slowly changing. Suddenly, while I was tramping back and forth across the plateau, the desire to paint deserted me. Since I was no longer seeking a vantage point, where I sat ceased to be of any importance; I could make myself comfortable anywhere. The spring sunshine penetrated to the very roots of the grass, and as I walked about wondering where to sit, I had the feeling that I was trampling unseen summer-colts underfoot."

こんな所へ美しい女の浮いているところをかいたら、どうだろうと思いながら、元の所へ帰って、また煙草を呑んで、ぼんやり考え込む。温泉場の御那美さんが昨日冗談に云った言葉が、うねりを打って、記憶のうちに寄せてくる。心は大浪にのる一枚の板子のように揺れる。あの顔を種にして、あの椿の下に浮かせて、上から椿を幾輪も落とす。椿が長えに落ちて、女が長えに水に浮いている感じをあらわしたいが、それが画でかけるだろうか。かのラオコーンには――ラオコーンなどはどうでも構わない。原理に背いても、背かなくっても、そう云う心持ちさえ出ればいい。しかし人間を離れないで人間以上の永久と云う感じを出すのは容易な事ではない。第一顔に困る。あの顔を借りるにしても、あの表情では駄目だ。苦痛が勝ってはすべてを打ち壊わしてしまう。と云ってむやみに気楽ではなお困る。一層ほかの顔にしては、どうだろう。あれか、これかと指を折って見るが、どうも思しくない。やはり御那美さんの顔が一番似合うようだ。しかし何だか物足らない。物足らないとまでは気がつくが、どこが物足らないかが、吾ながら不明である。したがって自己の想像でいい加減に作り易える訳に行かない。あれに嫉妒を加えたら、どうだろう。嫉妒では不安の感が多過ぎる。憎悪はどうだろう。憎悪は烈げし過ぎる。怒？怒では全然調和を破る。恨？恨でも春恨とか云う、詩的のものならば格別、ただの恨では余り俗である。いろいろに考えた末、しまいにようやくこれだと気がついた。多くある情緒のうちで、憐れと云う字のあるのを忘れていた。憐れは神の知らぬ情で、しかも神にもっとも近き人間の情である。御那美さんの表情のうちにはこの憐れの念が少しもあらわれておらぬ。そこが物足らぬのである。ある咄嗟の衝動で、この情があの女の眉宇にひらめいた瞬時に、わが画は成就するであろう。しかし――いつそれが見られるか解らない。あの女の顔に普段充満しているものは、人を馬鹿にする微笑と、勝とう、勝とうと焦る八の字のみである。あれだけでは、とても物にならない。,"I wondered what it would be like to find a beautiful woman floating in such a place, but I went back to the original place, swallowed a cigarette again, and thought about it vaguely. The words that Mr. Onami of the hot springs joked yesterday swelled and came to my memory. My heart sways like a piece of board on a large wave. Using that face as a seed, float it under that camellia and drop many camellias from above. I want to show the feeling that the camellia has fallen for a long time and the woman has been floating in the water for a long time. For that Laocoon-I don't care about Laocoon. Whether you violate the principle or not, you just have to have that kind of mind. However, it is not easy to get the feeling of being more permanent than human beings without leaving human beings. I'm having trouble with my first face. Even if you borrow that face, that look is useless. If the pain wins, it will destroy everything. It's still a problem if you don't care about it. How about another face? I fold my finger to see this or that, but I don't think so. After all it seems that Mr. Onami's face looks best. But something isn't enough. I realize that it's not enough, but I'm not sure what's unsatisfactory. Therefore, I cannot easily make it by my own imagination. What if you add jealousy to that? Jealousy is too anxious. How about hatred? Hatred is too intense. Angry? Anger breaks harmony at all. Resentment? Even if it's a grudge, it's called a spring grudge, and if it's poetic, it's exceptional, and if it's just a grudge, it's too popular. After thinking a lot, I finally realized that this was the case. Of the many emotions, I forgot to have the word mercy. Mercy is the emotion that God does not know, and the emotion of human beings that is closest to God. This feeling of mercy does not appear in Minami's expression. That is unsatisfactory. My painting will be fulfilled at the moment when this feeling is inspired by the woman's eyebrows by the urge of a certain humor. But-I don't know when it will be seen. The only thing that usually fills her face is a smile that makes people foolish, and a figure of eight that is impatient to win or win. That alone is not very good.","I wander back and have another cigarette, thinking idly as I puff that this might be a scene for my painting of the beautiful floating woman. Nami’s joking words at the inn yesterday come snaking insidiously back into my memory. My heart rocks like a plank on a high sea. I will use that face, float it on the water beneath that camellia bush, and have the red flowers fall on it. I want to give a sense of the flowers falling eternally over the eternally floating woman—but can I achieve this in a picture? In Lessing’s Laocoön—but no, who cares what Lessing said? It doesn’t matter whether I choose to follow principles , what I’m after is the feeling. Still, remaining within the human realm, while seeking to express a sense of eternity that transcends the human, is no easy matter. The face is the first problem. Even if I borrow her face, that expression of hers won’t do. Suffering would dominate, and that would ruin everything. On the other hand, too great a sense of ease would also destroy the effect. Perhaps I should choose a different face altogether. I count off various possibilities, but none are suitable. Yes, Nami’s face does seem to be the right one. Yet something about it isn’t quite satisfactory. This much I know, but just where the problem lies is unclear to me, and consequently I can’t simply change that face on some fanciful whim. What would happen if I added a touch of jealousy to it? I wonder. No, jealousy has too much anxiety in it. What about hatred, then? No, too fierce. Rage? But that would wreck the harmony completely. Bitterness? No, too vulgar, unless it had a poetic air of romance to it. After pondering this and that possibility, I finally light on the answer: the one emotion that I’ve forgotten to include in my list is pity. Pity is an emotion unknown to the gods, yet of all the human emotions it is closest to them. In Nami’s expression there is not one jot of pity. This is its great lack. When on an instant’s impulse that emotion registers on her face, that will be the moment when my picture is complete. But when might I ever see this happen? The usual expression to be seen on that face is a hovering smile of derision and the intently furrowed brow of someone with a frantic desire to win. This is quite useless for my purpose.","Wondering how it would be to paint a beautiful woman floating in such a pond as this, I walked back down to the water's edge. Here I smoked another cigarette, and fell to musing once more. Suddenly the words which O-Nami at the hotel had said to me jokingly came flooding back into my mind, and I felt as though my heart were a raft that was being pitched and tossed by great waves. Suppose I painted her floating in the water beneath those camellias, with blossom after blossom dropping on her from above. I wanted to create the impression that the camellia blossoms would continue to fall, and the woman remain floating there throughout all eternity, but I was not sure that this would make a good picture. According to Laokoon—but who cares about that? Providing that a painting expresses the desired feeling, it makes not the slightest difference whether or not it conforms to any principles. I knew, however, that it was going to be no easy task to express so non-human a concept as eternity while using a human subject. First and foremost was the problem of the girl's face. I wanted to use O-Nami's face, but her expressions were all wrong. Her look of suffering would be so overpowering that it would destroy the whole effect, while her outbursts of immoderate gaiety would be even worse. Thinking that perhaps I ought to use someone else's face, I ran through all the women I knew counting them off on my fingers, but none of them was satisfactory. O -Nami was the most suitable after all, yet there was something lacking. That much I realised, but since I could not put my finger on the deficiency, it was impossible to make the appropriate alteration to her expression as I pictured it in my mind. If I added jealousy, the feeling of uneasiness would be too strong. What about hatred? No, that was too violent. Anger? No, that would completely shatter the harmony. I dismissed bitterness because, with the exception of the poetic bitterness of love, I consider it too vulgar. Having thought over various other possibilities, the answer suddenly dawned on me. I had forgotten that there exists among the many emotions one called compassion. It is unknown to the gods, and yet it is the very emotion that can elevate man to near-deity. There was not a trace of compassion in O-Nami's expression; that was what was missing. The instant I saw a flicker of this emotion pass across her features roused by some momentary impulse, I would be able to complete my picture; but when or even if that time would come I had no way of knowing. Her usual expression was only a faint mocking smile accompanied by a frown which showed a burning determination to win at all costs. This by itself was useless to me."

十三,Thirteen,CHAPTER 13,1 Fujimura was one of Sōseki's pupils who in 1903 at the age of eighteen committed suicide by drowning himself.
されど一事に即し、一物に化するのみが詩人の感興とは云わぬ。ある時は一弁の花に化し、あるときは一双の蝶に化し、あるはウォーヅウォースのごとく、一団の水仙に化して、心を沢風の裏に撩乱せしむる事もあろうが、何とも知れぬ四辺の風光にわが心を奪われて、わが心を奪えるは那物ぞとも明瞭に意識せぬ場合がある。ある人は天地の耿気に触るると云うだろう。ある人は無絃の琴を霊台に聴くと云うだろう。またある人は知りがたく、解しがたき故に無限の域に儃佪して、縹緲のちまたに彷徨すると形容するかも知れぬ。何と云うも皆その人の自由である。わが、唐木の机に憑りてぽかんとした心裡の状態は正にこれである。,"However, it is not the poet's excitement to just make one thing in line with one thing. Sometimes it turns into a petal flower, sometimes it turns into a pair of butterflies, and sometimes it turns into a group of daffodils, like Warsworth, which may disturb your heart behind the wind. There are times when my heart is fascinated by the unknown winds of the four sides, and I am not clearly aware of the fact that my heart is captivated. Some would say that it touches the heavens and the earth. Some would say that they listen to the unstringed koto on the sacred table. Others may describe it as wandering around infinitely after being slaughtered because it is difficult to know and understand. After all, everyone is free. This is exactly the state of my heart that was possessed by Karaki's desk.","Yet the joys of the poet do not lie simply in immersing oneself in some moment, and becoming one with some particular object. At times one may become the petal of a flower or a pair of butterflies, or again like Wordsworth one may let one’s heart be tossed in the blessed breeze as a crowd of daffodils. But there are also times when the ineffable beauty around one, some presence one can scarcely grasp, mysteriously masters the heart. One person will speak of being brushed by the shimmering winds of heaven and earth. Another will say he hears in his soul the harmonies of nature’s ethereal harp. Yet another may describe lingering in some incomprehensible and inexplicable realm without boundary or limit, or wandering in the misty far reaches of the world. People may describe it as they will. Into just such a state of mind have I fallen as I sit here at my desk, spellbound and with a vacant gaze.","I do not say that pleasure for the poet lies in devoting himself exclusively to one subject, or being transformed into just one thing. Sometimes he will become a solitary petal; sometimes a pair of butterflies. He may even, like Wordsworth, become a host of daffodils: his heart brushed and set dancing by a gently rustling breeze. There are times, however, when he finds himself absorbed into his natural surroundings, without being aware of precisely what it is that has captured his heart. One man might explain the way he felt by saying that he had been mesmerized by the brilliance of Nature; another that it was as if he could hear the notes of an ethereal harp coming from somewhere deep within his soul. Yet another might describe his condition by saying that he seemed to be wandering on and on through a vast expanse, but getting nowhere because he was unfamiliar with the ground and everything there was incomprehensible to him. Everyone is at liberty to describe this condition any way that seems best to him. I was in just such a state of mind as, with my elbows resting on the ebony desk, I sat there gazing vacantly into space."
余は、やはり女だなと思った。多少試験してやる気になる。,I thought I was a woman. I feel motivated to test a little.,"There speaks a woman, I think to myself. I decide to test her a little.","'Yes, she's a woman all right,' I thought, and decided to test her a little."
ただ、物は見様でどうでもなる。レオナルド・ダ・ヴィンチが弟子に告げた言に、あの鐘の音を聞け、鐘は一つだが、音はどうとも聞かれるとある。一人の男、一人の女も見様次第でいかようとも見立てがつく。どうせ非人情をしに出掛けた旅だから、そのつもりで人間を見たら、浮世小路の何軒目に狭苦しく暮した時とは違うだろう。よし全く人情を離れる事が出来んでも、せめて御能拝見の時くらいは淡い心持ちにはなれそうなものだ。能にも人情はある。七騎落でも、墨田川でも泣かぬとは保証が出来ん。しかしあれは情三分芸七分で見せるわざだ。我らが能から享けるありがた味は下界の人情に写す手際から出てくるのではない。の上へ芸術という着物を何枚も着せて、世の中にあるまじき悠長な振舞をするからである。,"However, things don't matter what they look like. Leonardo da Vinci told his disciples that he could hear the sound of that bell, one bell, but no sound. One man and one woman can be thought of as if they were different. Anyway, it's a trip to go out for inhumanity, so if you look at human beings with that intention, it will be different from when you lived cramped at what house in Ukiyokoji. Even if I can get away from humanity at all, it seems that I will be able to have a faint feeling at least when I see Noh. Noh also has humanity. There is no guarantee that you will not cry in the Seven Horses or in the Sumida River. However, that is a move to show in seven minutes of emotional art. The grateful taste that we can enjoy from Noh does not come from the skill of copying it to the humanity of the lower world. This is because he wears many kimonos called art on top of it and behaves in a relaxed manner in the world.","Nevertheless, how a thing looks depends on how you see it. “Listen to the bell,” Leonardo da Vinci told his pupils. “It is a single sound, but you all hear it variously.” A man or a woman too will appear very different depending on your point of view. Since I’ve come here to devote myself to the unhuman, this is the perspective on humans that I will take, and it is bound to be different from the view I would have from the midst of a life lived deep in the cramped little streets of the crowded world. Very well, granted that I can’t altogether escape the realm of human feelings ; at least I can probably maintain the light detachment experienced by the viewer of some classic Noh drama. The Noh drama, after all, has its human feelings. There is no guarantee you won’t weep at a play like Shichikiochi or Sumidagawa.5 But what we experience in these plays is the effect of three parts human feeling to seven parts art. The pleasure we gain from a Noh play springs not from any skill at presenting the raw human feelings of the everyday world but from clothing feeling “as it is” in layer upon layer of art, and in a kind of slowed serenity of deportment not to be found in the real world.","The same object may appear entirely different, just depending upon where you stand. Leonardo da Vinci once said to a pupil: 'Listen to that bell ringing. There is only one bell, but it may be heard in an infinite number of ways.' Since our judgment of people is purely subjective, opinions about the same person, man or woman, may differ vastly. Anyway, since my object on coming on this journey was to rise above emotions, and to view things dispassionately, I am sure that people appear different to me now than they did when I lived right on top of them, in a cramped back street of that unstable and wretched city— the world of men. Even if I cannot be completely objective, then at least my feelings should be no more intense than if I were watching a Noh1 play. At times even the Noh can be sentimental. Can anyone guarantee that he will not be moved to tears by Shichikiochi2 or Sumidagawa2? The Noh, however, is three-tenths real emotion, and seven-tenths technique. Its greatness and charm do not lie in a skilful representation of emotions and human relationships exactly as they actually are, but rather in the fact that it takes plain reality, and clothing it as it were with layer after layer of art, produces a leisurely, almost lethargic pattern of behaviour, which is to be found nowhere in real life."

暮れんとする春の色の、嬋媛として、しばらくは冥邈の戸口をまぼろしに彩どる中に、眼も醒むるほどの帯地は金襴か。あざやかなる織物は往きつ、戻りつ蒼然たる夕べのなかにつつまれて、幽闃のあなた、遼遠のかしこへ一分ごとに消えて去る。燦めき渡る春の星の、暁近くに、紫深き空の底に陥いる趣である。,"The brocade is a brocade that will awaken your eyes while the doorway of Meibu is dimly colored for a while as a brocade with the color of the dark spring.

昔から小説家は必ず主人公の容貌を極力描写することに相場がきまってる。古今東西の言語で、佳人の品評に使用せられたるものを列挙したならば、大蔵経とその量を争うかも知れぬ。この辟易すべき多量の形容詞中から、余と三歩の隔りに立つ、体を斜めに捩って、後目に余が驚愕と狼狽を心地よげに眺めている女を、もっとも適当に叙すべき用語を拾い来ったなら、どれほどの数になるか知れない。しかし生れて三十余年の今日に至るまで未だかつて、かかる表情を見た事がない。美術家の評によると、希臘ギリシャの彫刻の理想は、端粛の二字に帰するそうである。端粛とは人間の活力の動かんとして、未だ動かざる姿と思う。動けばどう変化するか、風雲か雷霆か、見わけのつかぬところに余韻が縹緲と存するから含蓄の趣を百世の後に伝うるのであろう。世上幾多の尊厳と威儀とはこの湛然たる可能力の裏面に伏在している。動けばあらわれる。あらわるれば一か二か三か必ず始末がつく。一も二も三も必ず特殊の能力には相違なかろうが、すでに一となり、二となり、三となった暁には、拖泥帯水の陋を遺憾なく示して、本来円満の相に戻る訳には行かぬ。この故に動と名のつくものは必ず卑しい。運慶の仁王も、北斎の漫画も全くこの動の一字で失敗している。動か静か。これがわれら画工の運命を支配する大問題である。古来美人の形容も大抵この二大範疇のいずれにか打ち込む事が出来べきはずだ。,"From ancient times, novelists have always been enthusiastic about portraying the appearance of the main character as much as possible. If you list the ones used in the reputation of Yoshito in the languages of ancient and modern east and west, you may contend with the Okura Kei. From this abundant adjectives that should be agitated, the woman who stands at the distance of three steps from me, twists her body diagonally, and looks at my astonishment and dismay in the back, should be described most appropriately. If you pick up the terms, you may know how many. However, I have never seen such an expression until today, which is more than 30 years old. According to the artist's comment, the ideal of Greek sculpture is attributed to the two characters of the end. I think that the sword is a movement of human vitality, and it still does not move. How it changes if it moves, whether it is Fengyun or Thunderstorm, there is a lingering lingering sound in an indistinguishable place, so it is possible to convey the taste of implications after the hundredth generation. The dignity and dignity of the world lies behind this tremendous potential. Appears if you move. If it appears, one, two, or three will surely be dealt with. One, two, and three will surely be different in their special abilities, but when they have already become one, two, and three, they will regretfully show the sword of the mud belt water and return to the original harmonious phase. I can't translate it. For this reason, things with the name ""movement"" are always lowly. Both Unkei's Nioh and Hokusai's manga have failed with this single character. It's quiet. This is a major problem that governs the fate of our painters. The description of an ancient beauty should usually be able to be devoted to either of these two categories.","The supreme effort that goes into describing the features of a hero or heroine has long been a determiner of a novel’s worth. Were one to enumerate all the words, in every language of East and West from classical times until today, that writers have devoted to evaluating the qualities of beautiful women, the list may well rival in length the complete canon of the Buddhist sutras. How many words would it take, I wonder, if I were to select from among this truly dismaying assemblage of adjectives those that might best describe the woman now standing three paces away, twisting her body diagonally to look at me out of the corner of her eye, comfortably taking in my astonishment and bewilderment? In my thirty-some years I have never until this moment seen such an expression as is on her face. The ideal of classical Greek sculpture, I understand, can be summed up in the phrase “poised containment,” which seems to signify the energy of the human form held poised for action. The resonance of such a figure subtly inheres in that moment before the figure moves and changes into unguessable energies, swirling cloud or echoing thunder, which is surely why the significance of that form still reaches us across the centuries. All the dignity and solemnity to be found in the world lies hidden beneath this quality of poised containment. Once the figure moves, what is implicit becomes revealed, and revelation inevitably brings some resolution into one thing or another. Any resolution, of course, will always contain its own particular power, but once the movement has begun, matters will soon degenerate into mere sludge and squalor, and there will be no going back to the harmonious serenity of the original form. For this reason, whatever has motion is always finally vulgar. The fierce sculptures of the temple guardians that Unkei created, or the lively cartoon figures of Hokusai, both ultimately fail for this simple reason.9 Should we depict motion or stillness?—this is the great problem that governs the fate of us artists. The majority of the words used down the centuries to describe beautiful women can surely also be placed in either one of these two great categories.","It has long been an established principle that the novelist must describe the looks of his hero or heroine in the most minute detail. If all the words and phrases which have been employed for this purpose by Western and Oriental writers from classical until modern times were collected together, they might well rival the great Buddhist Sutras in volume. Moreover, were I merely to pick out from this terrifyingly large number of epithets all those which adequately described the woman who was now standing there a little apart from me, they would make a list I know not how long. She held her body inclined at an angle, and was looking at me contemptuously as though enjoying my discomfort. Never in all my thirty years of life had I ever seen such an expression on anyone's face. According to artists, the ancient Greek ideal of sculpture was to produce a figure which embodied what may be summed up as 'energy in repose'. That is to say a figure in which vital energy is on the point of being, but has not quite been motivated. The attraction of such a figure never palls, but becomes greater the more you look at it, for you always wonder what this energy would become were it unleashed: a whirlwind perhaps, or thunder and lightning. Thus it is that Greek art has continued to hold a wealth of meaning for generation after generation down through the centuries. Were the figure to move, all the great dignity of mankind which is dormant in the enormous potential force would be expressed. In the course of expressing this, however, the figure would be forced to change to some .other position in which a different set of conditions prevailed. Admittedly every one of these new positions would have its own individual potentiality, but once having moved, the figure could never again return to its original state of harmony. Any new situation would be as ugly as that resulting were a beautiful river to subside suddenly, revealing a bed of mud. It is for this reason that I think that wherever you have motion, you must also have vulgarity. The reason for the failure of Hokusai's comic pictures, and Unkei's statues of the two Nio1 lies in this one word 'motion'. Motion or repose? That is the burning question which governs the fate of us artists. One ought, more or less, to be able to put the qualities of beautiful women through the ages into one or other of these categories."

強いて説明せよと云わるるならば、余が心はただ春と共に動いていると云いたい。あらゆる春の色、春の風、春の物、春の声を打って、固めて、仙丹に練り上げて、それを蓬萊の霊液に溶いて、桃源の日で蒸発せしめた精気が、知らぬ間に毛孔から染み込んで、心が知覚せぬうちに飽和されてしまったと云いたい。普通の同化には刺激がある。刺激があればこそ、愉快であろう。余の同化には、何と同化したか不分明であるから、毫も刺激がない。刺激がないから、窈然として名状しがたい楽がある。風に揉まれて上の空なる波を起す、軽薄で騒々しい趣とは違う。目に見えぬ幾尋の底を、大陸から大陸まで動いている潢洋たる蒼海の有様と形容する事が出来る。ただそれほどに活力がないばかりだ。しかしそこにかえって幸福がある。偉大なる活力の発現は、この活力がいつか尽き果てるだろうとの懸念が籠る。常の姿にはそう云う心配は伴わぬ。常よりは淡きわが心の、今の状態には、わが烈しき力の銷磨しはせぬかとの憂を離れたるのみならず、常の心の可もなく不可もなき凡境をも脱却している。淡しとは単に捕え難しと云う意味で、弱きに過ぎる虞を含んではおらぬ。冲融とか澹蕩とか云う詩人の語はもっともこの境を切実に言い了せたものだろう。,"If I force you to explain, I would say that my heart is just moving with spring. All the colors of spring, the breeze of spring, the things of spring, the voice of spring, hardened, kneaded into Chinese alchemy, dissolved in the spiritual juice of Penglai, and evaporated on the day of Togen, from the pores without knowing it. It's soaked in and saturated before my heart perceives it. Ordinary assimilation is stimulating. It will be fun if there is stimulation. Since it is unclear what the assimilation was, there is no stimulus to the assimilation. Since there is no stimulus, there is an unnamed comfort. It's different from the frivolous and noisy atmosphere of being rubbed by the wind and causing the sky waves above. The invisible bottom of Ikuhiro can be described as the state of the blue sea, which is a continent moving from continent to continent. It just doesn't have that much energy. However, there is happiness on the contrary. The manifestation of great vitality raises concerns that this vitality will eventually run out. There is no such worry in the usual appearance. In the present state of my heart, which is lighter than usual, not only do I get away from the worries that my fierce power will be honed, but I also escape from the ordinary world of my heart. is doing. Lightening simply means that it is difficult to catch, and does not include the risk of being too weak. The poet's words, such as ""Fusion"" and ""Burning"", are probably the most urgent words of this boundary.","If I were pressed to explain, I would want to say that my heart is moving with the spring. Or that some spirit—compounded of all the colors of spring, its breezes, its various elements, and its many voices, condensed, kneaded together into a magic potion that is then dissolved into an elixir in the realm of the immortals and condensed to a vapor in the warmth of Shangri-la’s sunlight—such a spirit has slipped in, unbeknownst to me, through my pores and has saturated my heart. Normally some stimulant provokes a sense of oneness, and this is why the experience is enjoyable. But in this experience of mine I can’t say what I’ve merged with, so it entirely lacks a specific stimulant. For this very reason, however, it produces a fathomless and inexpressible pleasure. I’m not speaking of some superficial and boisterous elation, waves tossed in the abstracted mind by a pummeling wind. No, rather my state is like a vast ocean that moves between one far continent and another above invisible depths of ocean floor. It lacks the vigor that this image suggests—but that is all to the good, for where great energy arises, a hidden fear of the time when that energy consumes itself and comes to an end is always present. In normal circumstances there is no such fear. And in my present, even more tenuous state, I am not only far removed from all such sorrow at the thought of a dwindling of sustaining energy, I am indeed quite freed from the everyday condition of man, in which the heart knows judgment of good and bad, right and wrong. I say that my state is “tenuous” only in the sense that it is ungraspable, not to suggest that it is unduly feeble. Poetic expressions such as “sated with tranquillity” or “sunk in a halcyon calm” perhaps most fully and finely express such a state of mind.","If pressed for an explanation, I would say that my soul was moving with the spring. Imagine all the colours, breezes, elements and voices of spring solidified, ground to powder and blended together to form an elixir of life, which had then been dissolved in dew gathered from the slopes of Olympus, and evaporated in the sun of fairyland. I felt now as though the vapour rising from just such a precious liquid had seeped through the pores of my skin and, without my being conscious of it, saturated my soul. The reason why the process of being assimilated into an object is pleasant is that it is usually accompanied by stimulation. In my case, however, this was not so, since it was impossible to say into what I had become assimilated. This absence of stimulation meant that I was filled with an indescribably profound and beautiful calm. Mine was no fleeting sense of wild elation like a wave raised momentarily by the wind only to subside again in an instant. No, the state I was in may best be likened to that of a vast ocean flowing across its unfathomable bed from continent to continent. The only difference is that I did not possess quite the same degree of vital energy as the ocean. This in fact was a good thing, for the manifestation of great vitality automatically gives rise to the anticipation of its exhaustion. Where it exists in a normal degree, however, there is no such worry. Not only had my soul become so faint that I seemed far removed from all anxiety as to whether or not my strength would some day drain from me, but it had also risen above its usual state of mediocrity. When I say that it had become faint, I do not mean to imply that it had grown weaker in any way, but simply that it had become more tenuous. I think the words 'nebulous' and 'limpid' which poets often use, describe this state admirably."

It is a mistake to try to make such an abstract hobby into a picture.

People are not so very different from one another after all, and no doubt someone else among them all has felt the touch of this same imaginative state and tried to express it in eternal form through one means or another. If this is the case, what means might he have used?","I schemed, and thought, and contrived, but it was no good : I could not give shape to my feelings. I realised that it had been a mistake ever to try and turn such an abstract condition into a painting, and I put my pencil down.

納屋の方でようやく返事がする。足音が襖の向でとまって、からりと、開くが早いか、白鞘の短刀が畳の上へ転がり出す。,"The barn finally replies. The footsteps stop in the direction of the fusuma, and the sword of the white sheath rolls on the tatami mat.","At last an answering voice is heard from the barn. The approaching steps pause behind the sliding door. It opens, and in an instant the dagger in its white wooden sheath is tumbling over the matting.","At length an answering call came from the outhouse, followed by the sound of footsteps which eventually stopped on the other side of the fusuma across the room. Just as the fusuma was slid back, a white-wood sheath went rolling towards it across the matted floor."

会話はこれで切れる。飯はようやく了る。膳を引くとき、小女郎が入口の襖を開たら、中庭の栽込みを隔てて、向う二階の欄干に銀杏返しが頰杖を突いて、開化した楊柳観音のように下を見詰めていた。今朝に引き替えて、はなはだ静かな姿である。俯向いて、瞳の働きが、こちらへ通わないから、相好にかほどな変化を来たしたものであろうか。昔の人は人に存するもの眸子より良きはなしと云ったそうだが、なるほど人焉んぞ廋さんや、人間のうちで眼ほど活きている道具はない。寂然と倚る亜字欄の下から、蝶々が二羽寄りつ離れつ舞い上がる。途端にわが部屋の襖はあいたのである。襖の音に、女は卒然と蝶から眼を余の方に転じた。視線は毒矢のごとく空を貫いて、会釈もなく余が眉間に落ちる。はっと思う間に、小女郎が、またはたと襖を立て切った。あとは至極呑気な春となる。,"The conversation is cut off with this. The rice is finally over. When pulling the set, when the little girl opened the sliding door at the entrance, the ginkgo balustrade pierced the balustrade on the second floor across the courtyard and stared at the bottom like the opened Yangyanagi Kannon. In exchange for this morning, it is a very quiet figure. I wonder if the work of the eyes has changed so much because it doesn't go down to this place. It is said that people in the old days said that there is nothing better than Mako, which exists in humans, but it is true that there is no human tool that is as active as the eyes. Two butterflies flutter away from each other under the lonely sub-character column. Immediately, the sliding doors in my room opened. At the sound of the sliding doors, the woman suddenly turned her eyes from the butterflies to the other side. The line of sight pierces the sky like a poison dart, and I fall between my eyebrows without a nod. In the meantime, the little girl broke the sliding door. The rest is a very sullen spring.","The conversation comes to a halt. I finish my meal, and the maid withdraws the tray table. When she slides open the door to leave, suddenly there beyond, on the second-floor balcony across the shrubs of the little inner garden, I see revealed the head of that same woman, under its ichogaeshi curves of hair. Her cheek rests elegantly upon a raised hand, and her gaze is directed downward like the enlightened figure of the “Willow Branch” Kannon bodhisattva. 4 In contrast to my earlier sight of her that morning, she now presents a deeply serene figure. Doubtless it’s because her face is lowered and her eyes do not so much as quiver in my direction that her features are transformed in this way. It used to be said that “the eye is the finest thing in the human form,”5 and certainly its incomparably vivid expressiveness will always shine through. Beneath the railing with its twisted patterning where she quietly leans, two butterflies flutter upward, now drawing together, now dancing apart. Because my door has been opened suddenly, the woman swiftly raises her eyes from the butterflies toward my room. Her gaze pierces the air between us like a poisoned dart and falls upon my brow without a flicker of recognition or greeting. Before I can recover from my astonishment, the maid has once more clapped the door shut, leaving behind her the easy-going indifference of spring.","This brought the conversation to an abrupt end. At length I finished my meal, and the girl took the table away. As she slid open the door, I caught sight of the woman with the 'butterfly' hairstyle across the top of the shrubbery in the inner court. She was standing on the first-floor verandah with her elbows resting on the rail, and her face cupped in her hands. This pose, added to the fact that she was gazing intently at something below, made her look for all the world like a statue of Kwannon the omniscient goddess of mercy. Her present air of serenity was in complete contrast to her appearance that morning. Since she was looking downwards, it was impossible from where I was sitting to see the expression in her eyes. I wondered whether, if I could have seen them, she would have presented a different picture. Someone long ago once said apparently, that nothing speaks for a man better than his pupils. This is quite true, for the eye is the most expressive and vital organ in the human body, and will mirror your feelings however much you may try to conceal them. From beneath the rail on which the 'butterfly' was leisurely leaning, two real butterflies came dancing erratically upward, now drawing together, now fluttering apart again. This then was the scene that confronted me as the door slid back. The noise of the door, however, disturbed her, and looking up sharply from the butterflies, she turned her attention towards me. Her unwavering gaze shot through the air like a poisoned arrow, and struck me between the eyes. Before I could recover from my surprise, the young girl slid the screen across again. Immediately the complete lassitude of spring returned."

襖をあけて、椽側へ出ると、向う二階の障子に身を倚たして、那美さんが立っている。顋を襟のなかへ埋めて、横顔だけしか見えぬ。余が挨拶をしようと思う途端に、女は、左の手を落としたまま、右の手を風のごとく動かした。閃くは稲妻か、二折れ三折れ胸のあたりを、するりと走るや否や、かちりと音がして、閃めきはすぐ消えた。女の左り手には九寸五分の白鞘がある。姿はたちまち障子の影に隠れた。余は朝っぱらから歌舞伎座を覗いた気で宿を出る。,"After opening the sliding doors and going out to the side of the sword, Nami stands on the shoji screen on the second floor. I bury the collar in the collar and can only see the profile. As soon as I wanted to say hello, the woman dropped her left hand and moved her right hand like a wind. The flash was a lightning bolt, or it broke in two or three, and as soon as I ran around my chest, I heard a click and the flash disappeared immediately. On the left hand of the woman, there is a white pod of nine inches and five minutes. The figure immediately disappeared in the shadow of the shoji. I leave the inn with the feeling of looking into Kabuki-za from the morning.","I open the door to leave, and there at the second-floor window, leaning against the sliding paper door, stands Nami. Her chin is buried in the collar of her kimono, and only her profile is visible. Just as I am on the point of greeting her, her right hand rises as if lifted on a breeze, while the left hand continues to hang at her side. Something—is it lightning?—flashes swiftly up and down at her breast, there is a sharp click, and the flash is gone again. In her left hand I now see she’s holding the unvarnished wooden scabbard of a dagger. The next instant she has hidden herself behind the screen door. I leave the inn with the illusion that I have stopped in briefly on a morning performance at the Kabuki theater.","Sliding back the fusuma, I stepped out on to the verandah, and found O-Nami leaning against the shōji of the first-floor room opposite. Her chin was buried in the neck band of her kimono, so that only one side of her face was visible. I was on the point of calling out to her, when her left hand dropped to her side, and in the same instant her right hand moved like the wind. A flash, which might almost have been lightening, shot two or three times across her chest. Then came a sharp click, the flash vanished and in her left hand she was holding a white-wood sheath about a foot long. The next moment she disappeared behind the shōji. I left the hotel feeling that I had been watching a very early morning performance of Kabuki.1"
「どこぞへ出ましたかな、久一、御前の方へ行きはせんかな」,"""Where did you go, Kuichi, I wonder if you should go to you?""","She’s all right, I hope?” “She must have gone out somewhere.

The scenery that is timid and the scenery that is hidden-of course, the scenery that is ashamed. This is just overtaken.","“You’re sleeping again, are you? I must have disturbed you last night. I do keep disturbing you, don’t I?” and she laughs. She shows not the least sign of shyness or concealment, let alone embarrassment. She has simply seized the initiative.","'Lying down again? It must have been very annoying for you to have been disturbed so many times last night. I'm afraid I was a terrible nuisance,' she said with a mischievous laugh. There was nothing at all timid or bashful about her, and of course no trace of embarrassment either. I felt that she was definitely ahead in the game."
「まあ一つ」と婆さんはいつの間にか刳り抜き盆の上に茶碗をのせて出す。茶の色の黒く焦げている底に、一筆がきの梅の花が三輪無雑作に焼き付けられている。,"""Well, one"" said the old lady, before she knew it, put a bowl on the tray. A single-stroke plum blossom is randomly printed on the bottom of the brown-colored black charcoal.","“Here you are,” says the old woman, reappearing in no time with a teacup on a tray made from a hollowed piece of wood. In the bottom of the cup, which is stained a blackish brown from years of tea, three plum blossoms have been casually sketched with a few quick brushstrokes.","'Here we are, a nice cup of tea.' In no time at all the old woman had returned carrying a cup of tea on a shallow tray. The tea had been stewed for so long that it was almost black, but I could just make out a cluster of three plum-bossoms painted roughly with one stroke of the brush on the bottom of the cup."

Some people don't even know what they were originally exposing to the world. Moreover, it is big only in that aspect. I know it as an honor because it has a large area that hits the wind of the Ukiyo. For five or ten years, I've put a detective on a person's buttocks, and I've been counting people's flatulence, and I think that's the human world. Then he comes out to the people and teaches you how many flatulences, how many, and how many you can't ask. If you go to the front, you can refer to that as well, but from the back, you say how many flatulences, how many, how many. It is even more noisy. Speaking of Yose. Even though I knew it, I said how many flatulences I had, and I had. Then it is said that it is the policy of the world. The policy is selfish. Don't just say it's slammed, just silently make a policy. It is polite to refrain from policies that get in the way of people. If you can't make a policy if it doesn't get in the way, it's just a matter of flatulence. If that happens, Japan will be out of luck.","The world is chock-full of unpleasant people—the pestering and spiteful, the pushy types, the fussers and nigglers. Some make you feel they’re simply a waste of precious space on this earth. And it’s always this sort who really throw their weight around. This fellow will consider the space he takes up to be a matter for tremendous pride. He feels his great purpose in life is to set a detective to work peering at your backside for years on end, counting your farts, and then he’ll step out and stand there in front of you and make a song and dance about how many times you farted in the last five or ten years. If he says all this to your face, you can at least take note of what he’s saying, but you’ll find him insinuating things behind your back. Complaining just makes him more insistent. If you tell him to drop it, he nags all the harder. “Okay, I understand!” you cry, but, no, he just goes on and on about the number of farts. And this he claims to be his highest ambition in life. Well, everyone has their ambitions, and all I can say is, this fellow would do far better to drop his harping on about farts and fix on some goal that will shut him up. It’s only common courtesy to put a hold on your ambition if it’s going to cause problems for others. And if you say that your goal can’t be fulfilled without bothering others, then I will say that mine requires me to fart—and there goes all hope for Japan.","The world is full of the most terrible people who are importunate, coarse, niggling and, to crown it all, brazen. Indeed, it is incomprehensible why some of them ever showed their faces on earth in the first place. They assume airs and graces, but in reality there is nothing great about them at all. Because of their expansive appearance, the fickle world frequently casts its spotlight on them, and they labour under the misapprenhension that this is fame. They will set a detective on your tail for five or ten years to reckon up how many times you break wind, and they think this is Life. Moreover, they will, on occasion, leap out in front of you and impart such unsolicited information as, 'You farted x number of times'. When they tell you this face to face, you may listen and make a note of it for future reference. But the refrain, 'You farted x number of times', often comes from behind. If you say they are a nuisance, they do it all the more. If you tell them to stop it, they redouble their efforts. Even if you say that you know, they will still repeat, 'You farted x number of times'. This is their idea of how to live with their fellow creatures. They are, of course, free to formulate their own principles for living, providing that these do not include telling people, 'You farted, you farted'. It is only common decency to desist from any course of action which is going to inconvenience others. If, however, they cannot find such a course of action, then I shall have no choice but to adopt farting as my policy; and if that should ever happen, it will be a sorry day for Japan."

Something that suddenly stops has a sudden feeling, but mercy is light. In the hearts of people who listen to a fluffy and daring voice, there is still a fluffy and daring feeling. For the phenomenon that should disappear naturally without any kugire, we also shorten the seconds, divide the minutes, and the fineness of the heart becomes smaller. Death is like a sick man who is about to die, and when it is extinguished, it is like an extinguishing light. I have a look.","fade and be gone from this brief world. At first the voice sounds quite close to the balcony, but it grows gradually fainter and more distant. When a thing finishes abruptly, you register the abruptness of its ending, and the loss is not deeply moving to you. A voice that breaks off decisively will produce a decisive feeling of completion in the listener. But when a phenomenon fades naturally away toward nothing with no real pause or break, the listening heart shrinks with each dwindling minute and each waning second to a thinner forlornness. Like the beloved dying husband who yet does not die, the guttering flame that still flickers on, this song racks my heart with anticipation of its end and holds within its melody all the bitter sorrows of the world’s transient springs. I have been listening from my bed, and as the song grows more distant, my ears ache to follow, though aware that they are being lured.","So too must I, to flee Love's stifling folds, Drop from the world. The voice had at first sounded near the verandah, but had now faded away into the distance. It is true that when something comes to an end suddenly it gives a feeling of suddenness, but you do not, however, feel the loss too keenly. When a voice ceases cleanly and decisively, it arouses a corresponding feeling in the listener. However, when faced with a phenomenon like this song, which can go on and on becoming fainter and fainter until eventually it disappears without your realising it, you find yourself breaking the minutes up into seconds and dividing the seconds into fractions, trying to pinpoint the exact time at which it will end; and all the time the pain caused by the anticipation of the loss grows more and more acute. It is like being with a sick man who appears ever on the verge of death but never dies, or watching a flame which gutters continually but never quite goes out. It throws your feelings into complete confusion, and drives out every thought save the one: Is this the end? Is this the end?"

ごろりと寝る。帽子が額をすべって、やけに阿弥陀となる。所々の草を一二尺抽いて、木瓜の小株が茂っている。余が顔はちょうどその一つの前に落ちた。木瓜は面白い花である。枝は頑固で、かつて曲った事がない。そんなら真直かと云うと、けっして真直でもない。ただ真直な短かい枝に、真直な短かい枝が、ある角度で衝突して、斜に構えつつ全体が出来上っている。そこへ、紅だか白だか要領を得ぬ花が安閑と咲く。柔かい葉さえちらちら着ける。評して見ると木瓜は花のうちで、愚かにして悟ったものであろう。世間には拙を守ると云う人がある。この人が来世に生れ変るときっと木瓜になる。余も木瓜になりたい。,"Sleep comfortably. The hat slips on the forehead and becomes Amitabha. A small stock of quince grows thickly by drawing 12 shaku of grass in some places. My face fell just in front of that one. Quince is an interesting flower. The branches are stubborn and never bent. If you say that it is straight, it is not straight at all. However, the straight short branch collides with the straight short branch at a certain angle, and the whole is completed while holding it at an angle. There, red or white flowers that do not get the point bloom quietly. Even soft leaves can be worn. If you look at it, the quince is probably one of the flowers that you stupidly realized. There are people in the world who say they protect me. When this person is born again in the afterlife, he will surely become a quince. I also want to be a quince.","I throw myself back onto the grass. My hat slips from my forehead and haloes my head. The grass is studded with little clumps of wild japonica bush one or two feet tall, and my face has come to rest just in front of one. Japonica is an interesting plant. Its branches obstinately refuse to bend, yet neither are they straight: each small straight twig collides with another small straight twig at an angle, so that the whole branch consists of a series of obliques, tranquilly ornamented with rather pointless scarlet or white flowers, and a casual scattering of soft leaves to top it off. You could characterize the japonica as belonging to the type of the enlightened fool. Some in this world doggedly retain an awkward and innocent honesty—they will be reborn as japonica. It’s the flower that I myself would like to become.","Flopping down on to the ground, I eased my hat up from my forehead so that it perched on the back of my head, and relaxed completely. Here and there the stunted forms of dwarf quince trees rose two or three feet out of the grass, and I now found myself face to face with one of them. The quince is an interesting tree. Its branches obstinately refuse to bend at all, and yet the overall effect is certainly not one of straightness. The whole lopsided framework of the tree is composed of short straight twigs and branches which collide with each other at an angle. The red or white blooms which appear in a rash over this framework look as though they do not know what they are doing there, and do not much care either. Even the soft leaves seem to have been stuck on at random. When you consider, the quince is the most foolish yet philosophical of all plants. There are people who are absolutely unconcerned with their inability to make any headway in the world, and make no effort to improve themselves. I am sure that they, in some future life, will be reborn as quince trees. I would very much like to be a quince myself."

今までは床の中に我慢して聞いていたが、聞く声の遠ざかるに連れて、わが耳は、釣り出さるると知りつつも、その声を追いかけたくなる。細くなればなるほど、耳だけになっても、あとを慕って飛んで行きたい気がする。もうどう焦慮ても鼓膜に応えはあるまいと思う一刹那の前、余はたまらなくなって、われ知らず布団をすり抜けると共にさらりと障子を開けた。途端に自分の膝から下が斜めに月の光りを浴びる。寝巻の上にも木の影が揺れながら落ちた。,"Until now, I had to put up with it in the floor and listen to it, but as the voice goes away, my ears want to chase after it, even though I know that it will start fishing. The thinner it gets, the more I feel like I want to fly after it, even if it's just my ears. In front of a moment when I thought that there would be no response to the eardrum no matter how hard I thought about it, I couldn't help but slipped through the futon and opened the shoji. Immediately below my knees, the moonlight shines diagonally. The shadow of the tree shook and fell on the nightwear.","I have been listening from my bed, and as the song grows more distant, my ears ache to follow, though aware that they are being lured. With the dwindling of that voice, these ears long to rise of their own accord and fly in yearning pursuit of it. A bare second before the last pulse of sound must surely no longer reach my straining hearing, I can bear it no longer, and in a moment I have slipped from the bed and opened the screen doors to the balcony. The lower part of my legs is instantly bathed in moonlight. The tree shadows fall wavering over my night robe.","There was something in this song which embodied all the regrets of mankind at the transience of spring in this ephemeral world. Until now I had resisted the temptation to get up, and had lain quietly in bed, but as the voice went farther and farther away it seemed to call to me more and more strongly. I knew it was luring me on, but nevertheless I wanted to follow. The fainter it grew the more I longed to rush headlong after it, so that even if I could not be where it was, at least my ear could keep track of it, and it would not be lost to me completely. Just then, it seemed that the next instant, however pleadingly I might listen, there would be no response, and unable to bear it any longer, I slipped out of. bed in spite of myself and slid back the shōji. As I did so the lower part of my body from the knees down was bathed in moonlight, and the wavering shadow of a tree fell slantwise across me."
しかし苦しみのないのはなぜだろう。ただこの景色を一幅の画として観、一巻の詩として読むからである。画であり詩である以上は地面を貰って、開拓する気にもならねば、鉄道をかけて一儲けする了見も起らぬ。ただこの景色が――腹の足しにもならぬ、月給の補いにもならぬこの景色が景色としてのみ、余が心を楽ませつつあるから苦労も心配も伴わぬのだろう。自然の力はここにおいて尊とい。吾人の性情を瞬刻に陶冶して醇乎として醇なる詩境に入らしむるのは自然である。,"But why is it painless? However, this is because I see this scenery as a wide picture and read it as a volume of poetry. As long as it is a picture and a poem, if you don't feel like getting the ground and cultivating it, you won't be able to make a profit by taking the railroad. However, this scenery-this scenery that does not add to my stomach and does not supplement my monthly salary is only as a scenery, and I am comforting my heart, so I think it will not be a pain or worry. The power of nature is precious here. It is natural to instantly cultivate my sexuality and enter into a poetic border that is graceful.","But why is there no suffering here? Simply because I see this scenery as a picture; I read it as a set of poems. Seeing it thus, as painting or poetry, I have no desire to acquire the land and cultivate it, or to put a railway through it and make a profit. This scenery—scenery that adds nothing to the belly or the pocket—fills the heart with pleasure simply as scenery, and this is surely why there is neither suffering nor anxiety in the experience. This is why the power of nature is precious to us. Nature instantly forges the spirit to a pristine purity and elevates it to the realm of pure poetry.","I wonder why this should be? I suppose the reason is that, looking at the landscape, it is as though you were looking at a picture unrolled before you, or reading a poem on a scroll. The whole area is yours, but since it is just like a painting or a poem, it never occurs to you to try and develop it, or make your fortune by running a railway line there from the city. You are free from any care or worry because you accept the fact that this scenery will help neither to fill your belly, nor add a penny to your salary, and are content to enjoy it just as scenery. This is the great charm of Nature, that it can in an instant, discipline men's hearts and minds, and removing all that is base, lead them into the pure unsullied world of poetry."

茶と聞いて少し辟易した。世間に茶人ほどもったいぶった風流人はない。広い詩界をわざとらしく窮屈に縄張りをして、極めて自尊的に、極めてことさらに、極めてせせこましく、必要もないのに鞠躬如として、あぶくを飲んで結構がるものはいわゆる茶人である。あんな煩瑣な規則のうちに雅味があるなら、麻布の聯隊のなかは雅味で鼻がつかえるだろう。廻れ右、前への連中はことごとく大茶人でなくてはならぬ。あれは商人とか町人とか、まるで趣味の教育のない連中が、どうするのが風流か見当がつかぬところから、器械的に利休以後の規則を鵜呑みにして、これでおおかた風流なんだろう、とかえって真の風流人を馬鹿にするための芸である。,"I was a little annoyed when I heard that it was tea. No one in the world is as savvy as a tea master. The so-called tea masters are the ones who deliberately and cramped the wide poetry world, are extremely self-respecting, extremely arrogant, and even though they are not necessary, they can bow and drink. If there is elegance in such a complicated rule, the Azabu regiment will be elegance and nose. All the people on the right and forward must be big tea masters. That was a merchant, a tradesman, or someone who had no hobby education, and had no idea what to do with it. On the contrary, it is a trick to make a fool of a true fashion person.","I shrink a little at the mention of tea. No one is more tediously pompous than a tea ceremony master, who will fancy himself the quintessence of elegant refinement. Your typical tea master is deeply conceited, not to mention affected and fastidious to a fault. He ostentatiously clings to the cramped little territory he’s marked out for himself within the wide world of sensibility, savoring his bowl of foam and bubbles with a quite ridiculous reverence. If that abominably complex set of rules and regulations that makes up the tea ceremony contains any refinement, then a crack army corps must positively reek of elegant sophistication! All those “right about turn! quick march!” fellows must to a man be the equivalent of the great tea masters. The art of the tea ceremony is something that the common merchant and townsman, lacking any education in the finer matters of taste, dreamed up through their ignorance of how refinement really works, by mindlessly swallowing whole and in mechanical fashion the rules that were invented after Rikyu’s day.7 Their pitiful conviction that it constitutes the height of refinement only makes a mockery of true sensibility.","When I heard the word 'tea', my enthusiasm waned a litte. There is nobody as ostentatious, or as persuaded of his own refinement of taste as the man who performs the tea-ceremony.1 He deliberately reduces the wide world of poetry to the most cramped and limiting proportions. He is self-opinionated, over-deliberate in his actions, and a fussy old woman about trifling niceties. Moreover he approaches the ceremony with unnecessary awe and respect, and goes into ecstasies as he drinks the frothy tea. If such a jumble of petty rules and regulations can be said to constitute elegance and good taste, then the boys in the regimental barracks at Azabu must be fairly wallowing in it. Oh yes, if this is true, then every mother's son of the 'right turn' and 'eyes front' brigade would make an exceptionally fine teaman. Those who take part in the tea-ceremony are really only tradesmen, merchants and the like who have not the first idea of what the words 'artistic taste' mean. They have swallowed whole the teachings of the great tea-ceremony master Rikyu, and without any sense of elegance, or indeed of purpose, merely go mechanicaly through the motions. By so doing, they convince themselves that they are men of refinement, but this is nonsense. All they are really doing is making fools of those who truly do have the ability to appreciate elegance."

The woman who had a mirror in her pocket would have flown from the top of that rock.","A blue-black rock towers ten feet or more into the air, straight up from the bottom of the pool; to the right of its sheer face, where the dark water lies in a curve at the jutting corner, dwarf bamboo crowds densely all the way down the steep mountainside to the very water’s edge.

しばらく人情界を離れたる余は、少なくともこの旅中に人情界に帰る必要はない。あってはせっかくの旅が無駄になる。人情世界から、じゃりじゃりする砂をふるって、底にあまる、うつくしい金のみを眺めて暮さなければならぬ。余自らも社会の一員をもって任じてはおらぬ。純粋なる専門画家として、己れさえ、纏綿たる利害の累索を絶って、優に画布裏に往来している。いわんや山をや水をや他人をや。那美さんの行為動作といえどもただそのままの姿と見るよりほかに致し方がない。,"If you leave the human world for a while, you don't have to return to the human world at least during this trip. That would be a waste of your trip. From the world of humanity, you have to shake the sand and look only at the beautiful gold that fills the bottom. I myself should not be appointed as a member of society. As a purely professional painter, even myself, I have cut off the accumulation of interests and go back and forth between the canvases. I mean, mountains, water, and others. Even if Nami-san's actions and actions are taken, there is no other way than just looking at them as they are.","Now, I have removed myself for a while from that sphere of human feelings, and during this journey I feel no necessity to rejoin it. Were I to do so, the whole point of the journey would be lost. I must sieve from the rough sands of human emotions the pure gold that lies within and fix my eyes on that alone. For now, I choose not to play my part as a member of society but to identify myself purely and simply as a professional painter, to cut myself loose from the entangling strictures of gross self-interest, and to dedicate myself fully to my relationship with the artist’s canvas—and of course my disinterested stance applies also to mountains and to water, not to mention to other people. Under the circumstances, then, I must observe Nami’s behavior in the same way, simply for what it is.","I had, for a while, been able to stand aside and view the complexity of human emotions and relationships objectively, and there was no reason for me to become involved again, at least for the duration of this trip. In fact, it was imperative that I should not become involved, for if that should happen it would mean that all my efforts had been wasted. I had to take human nature, sift out the sand and grit, and then spend my time gazing at the beautiful gold which remained in the bottom of the sieve. I was not at present a member of society, but a pure artist who, having succeeded in severing the bonds of self-interest, was leading his life peacefully in a painted world. It goes without saying, of course, that it was essential for me to view the mountains, the sea and the people around me as no more than pieces of scenery, and to accept O-Nami's behaviour just as it was without question."
家は随分広いが、向う二階の一間と、余が欄干に添うて、右へ折れた一間のほかは、居室台所は知らず、客間と名がつきそうなのは大抵立て切ってある。客は、余をのぞくのほかほとんど皆無なのだろう。〆た部屋は昼も雨戸をあけず、あけた以上は夜も閉てぬらしい。これでは表の戸締りさえ、するかしないか解らん。非人情の旅にはもって来いと云う屈強な場所だ。,"The house is quite large, but I don't know the kitchen in the living room, except for the one room on the second floor and the one that I turned to the right along the balustrade. There are almost no customers except me. It seems that the room that was closed does not open the shutters during the day and does not close at night after it is opened. With this, I don't even know whether or not to lock the front door. It's a tough place to take on an inhumane journey.","The building is a large one, but aside from the room opposite, and another that is level with my railing around to the right, almost every space that looks likely to be a guest room (I know nothing of the living area or kitchen) is closed up. There must be virtually no guests here apart from myself. The outer wooden shutters remain closed over the sealed rooms even during the day, but once opened, it seems they aren’t closed again even at night. Perhaps the front door is not locked at night either. It’s an ideal place for me to happen upon in my journey to savor artistic “nonemotion.”","The house was very large, but except for the room opposite, one room on the same floor as mine in the right wing of the house, and possibly also the family's rooms and the kitchen, everywhere was shut up. This seemed to suggest that, apart from myself, there were scarcely any guests. Even though it was broad daylight, nearly all the shutters were still closed, and should anybody ever go so far as to open them, I doubted very much if they would close them again at night. I was not even sure whether or not they locked the front door. This was an ideal place for someone like myself who was trying to get away from the world."
「観海寺と云うと、わしのいる所じゃ。いい所じゃ、海を一目に見下しての――まあ逗留中にちょっと来て御覧。なに、ここからはつい五六丁よ。あの廊下から、そら、寺の石段が見えるじゃろうが」,"""Kankai-ji is the place where I am.

そこで眼が醒めた。腋の下から汗が出ている。妙に雅俗混淆な夢を見たものだと思った。昔し宋の大慧禅師と云う人は、悟道の後、何事も意のごとくに出来ん事はないが、ただ夢の中では俗念が出て困ると、長い間これを苦にされたそうだが、なるほどもっともだ。文芸を性命にするものは今少しうつくしい夢を見なければ幅が利かない。こんな夢では大部分画にも詩にもならんと思いながら、寝返りを打つと、いつの間にか障子に月がさして、木の枝が二三本斜めに影をひたしている。冴えるほどの春の夜だ。,"Then my eyes awoke. I'm sweating from under my armpits. I thought it was a strangely mixed dream. Once upon a time, the Song dynasty Dahui Zongga had nothing to do after Godo, but he said he had suffered for a long time when he was in trouble because of the folklore in his dreams. But that's right. Those who make literary life a sexual life cannot be widespread unless they have a slightly beautiful dream. While thinking that such a dream would not be a poem or a poem, when I turned over, the moon struck the shoji and a few tree branches cast shadows diagonally. It's a clear spring night.","Then I awaken. My armpits are soaked with sweat. What an extraordinary jumble of the poetic and the vulgar that dream was! I think in bemusement. The early Zen priest Daie is said to have suffered greatly from the fact that even the enlightened mind, which has mastered the illusion of reality, is still troubled by dreams of the vulgar world. I can quite see his point. One whose calling in life is the arts surely doesn’t cut much of a figure if his dreams aren’t a bit more tasteful than the norm. I roll over, thinking to myself that most of my dream is quite useless from the point of view of a painting or a poem—and suddenly moonlight is pouring in through the paper screen doors onto the balcony, steeping them with the slanting shadows of several branches from the tree beyond. It is a brilliantly clear spring night.","Come back!' At this point I awoke to find that I was damp with perspiration under the arms. What a strange conglomeration of the poetic and commonplace that dream had been, I thought. Long ago during the Sung dynasty in China a Buddhist priest named Ta Hui said that having attained a state of supreme enlightenment, there was nothing he could not do if once he set his mind to it. Nevertheless, he was a victim of mundane thoughts in his dreams, and for a long time this caused him a great deal of suffering. I can quite imagine how he felt. It must have seemed to a man who had devoted his whole life to the arts, that not to be able to dream beautiful dreams was a sign of still being shackled by the world. I felt that most of my last dream was material for neither a picture nor a poem. Turning over in bed to try to get to sleep again, I saw that the moon was now shining on the shdji, casting on them oblique shadows of two or three branches of the tree outside.

個人の嗜好はどうする事も出来ん。しかし日本の山水を描くのが主意であるならば、吾々もまた日本固有の空気と色を出さなければならん。いくら仏蘭西フランスの絵がうまいと云って、その色をそのままに写して、これが日本の景色だとは云われない。やはり面のあたり自然に接して、朝な夕なに雲容煙態を研究したあげく、あの色こそと思ったとき、すぐ三脚几を担いで飛び出さなければならん。色は刹那に移る。一たび機を失すれば、同じ色は容易に眼には落ちぬ。余が今見上げた山の端には、滅多にこの辺で見る事の出来ないほどな好い色が充ちている。せっかく来て、あれを逃すのは惜しいものだ。ちょっと写してきよう。,"I can't do anything about my personal taste. However, if the main purpose is to draw the mountain water of Japan, we must also bring out the air and color peculiar to Japan. No matter how good the paintings of France, France, and West France are, the colors are copied as they are, and it cannot be said that this is the scenery of Japan. After all, I came into contact with nature around the surface and studied the cloud smoke condition in the morning and evening, and when I thought that color was the one, I had to carry a tripod and jump out immediately. The color shifts to the moment. Once lost, the same color is not easily visible to the eye. The edge of the mountain that I just looked up at is filled with such nice colors that I can rarely see around here. It is regrettable to come and miss it. Let's take a photo.","Nothing can be done about individual tastes, of course, but if our aim is to paint the Japanese landscape, we must depict the air and colors peculiar to it. No matter how fine you think the colors of French paintings, you cannot simply borrow them wholesale and claim that your painting depicts a Japanese landscape. You must immerse yourself in the natural world, study its multifarious forms, the shifting ways of cloud and mist, morning and evening, and only then, when you have at last lit on the very color you need, should you seize your tripod and rush outside to paint. Colors change from moment to moment. If you once lose the opportunity, you must wait a long time before your eyes fall on precisely this color again. The mountainside to which I now lift my gaze is flush with a marvelous hue rarely seen in these parts. It’s a great shame to have come all this way to be confronted by this moment, and to let it slip. Let me just try to paint it. . . .","Nothing can be done about the divergence of individual tastes, but we must at least bring out that quality of air and colour which is peculiar to Japan when we take a piece of Japanese scenery as our subject. You cannot say, 'Thiis is a Japanese landscape,' of a picture in which the artist has slavishly copied colour tones as they appear in French paintings, however much you admire French art. You must meet Nature face to face, studying her every shape and form from dawn to dusk, until such time as you feel that you have found just the right colours. You must then grab your tripod and immediately rush out to record them on canvas, for a particular shade lasts but a moment, and once gone will not easily be discovered again. The crest of the hill at which I was now looking was full of wonderful colours the like of which were rarely to be seen in this region of Japan. Having taken the trouble to come here, I felt it a pity to waste this opportunity, and so decided to go and try my hand at reproducing these colours in a picture."

余が今見た影法師も、ただそれきりの現象とすれば、誰れが見ても、誰に聞かしても饒に詩趣を帯びている。――孤村の温泉、――春宵の花影、――月前の低誦、――朧夜の姿――どれもこれも芸術家の好題目である。この好題目が眼前にありながら、余は入らざる詮義立てをして、余計な探ぐりを投げ込んでいる。せっかくの雅境に理窟の筋が立って、願ってもない風流を、気味の悪るさが踏みつけにしてしまった。こんな事なら、非人情も標榜する価値がない。もう少し修行をしなければ詩人とも画家とも人に向って吹聴する資格はつかぬ。昔し以太利亜イタリアの画家サルヴァトル・ロザは泥棒が研究して見たい一心から、おのれの危険を賭にして、山賊の群に這入り込んだと聞いた事がある。飄然と画帖を懐にして家を出でたからには、余にもそのくらいの覚悟がなくては恥ずかしい事だ。,"The shadow master I just saw has a poetic taste, no matter who sees it or asks it, if it is just a phenomenon. --The hot springs of a solitary village, --The flower shadow of spring evening, --The low revelation of the moon, --The appearance of Oboroya--These are all the favorite subjects of the artist. Even though this good subject is in front of me, I am throwing in extra quest by making a swearing that I can not enter. A line of cave stood in the elegance of the grace, and the creepy trampled on the undesired wind. In such a case, inhumanity is not worth advocating. Neither poets nor painters are qualified to listen to people without a little more training. Once upon a time, I heard that the Italian painter Salvator Rosa crawls into a group of bandits, betting on his danger, because the thief wants to study and see it. It's embarrassing if I don't have that much preparedness because I left the house with the picture book in my pocket.","The apparition I have just seen, if viewed simply as that, would certainly be rich with poetry for anyone, no matter who saw or spoke of it. A hot spring in some little village tucked away from the world, the shadow of blossoms on a spring evening, murmured song in moonlight, a dimly lit figure—every element is a perfect subject for the artist. And here I am, confronted with this perfect subject, engaging in useless debates and inquiries on it! Chill reason has intruded itself on this precious realm of refined beauty; tremulous distaste has trampled upon this unsought moment of artistic elegance. Under the circumstances, it’s meaningless to profess my vaunted “nonemotional” approach. I must put myself through a bit more training in the discipline before I’m qualified to boast to others that I am a poet or artist. I’ve heard that an Italian artist of times gone by, one Salvator Rosa, risked his life to join a gang of bandits through his single-minded desire to make a study of a robber.6 Having so jauntily set off on this journey, sketchbook tucked into my kimono, I would be ashamed to show any less resolve.","The shadow I had just seen, considered simply as a shadow and nothing more, was charged with poetry. So much so, that nobody who saw or heard it could possibly fail to appreciate the fact.—A hot-spring in a secluded village—the shadow of blossoms on a spring night—a voice singing softly in the moonlight—a figure flitting through the shadows—every one of them a subject to delight any artist. Yet for all that I had engaged in an investigation which was quite out of keeping with the situation, and probed about pointlessly trying to find reasons for everything. I had been privileged to see the world of pure poetry, and had tried to apply to it the yardstick of logic. Moreover, all because of an unpleasant sensation, I had ridden roughshod over the rarest delicacy and elegance crushing them into the ground. My claim to be able to rise above human emotions then, was obviously nothing more than idle boasting. I should still have to discipline myself more before I could say with any confidence that I was a poet or an artist. I remember hearing once that long ago an Italian painter named Salvador Rosa was so set on studying the ways of robbers that he risked his life by joining a band of mountain brigands. It was a shameful thing if I, having wandered off suddenly from home with just a sketchbook tucked inside my kimono, did not have the same amount of resolution."

巌角を鋭どく廻って、按摩なら真逆様に落つるところを、際どく右へ切れて、横に見下すと、菜の花が一面に見える。雲雀はあすこへ落ちるのかと思った。いいや、あの黄金の原から飛び上がってくるのかと思った。次には落ちる雲雀と、上る雲雀が十文字にすれ違うのかと思った。最後に、落ちる時も、上る時も、また十文字に擦れ違うときにも元気よく鳴きつづけるだろうと思った。,"If you turn sharply around the corner and look down at the place where it falls in the opposite direction if you massage it, cut it to the right and look down to the side, you can see the rape blossoms all over. I wondered if the skylark would fall to Asuko. No, I wondered if it would jump out of that golden field. Next, I wondered if the falling skylark and the rising skylark would pass each other. Finally, I thought that I would continue to scream vigorously when I fell, when I climbed, and when I rubbed against the cross.","I turn a sharp rocky corner, then execute a swift, perilous swerve to the right to avoid a sudden drop into which a blind man would have tumbled headlong. Looking down, I see far below a vast yellow swath of wild mustard in flower. Perhaps, I think, this is the place that skylark would fall to in alighting—or no, perhaps it would instead soar upward out of that golden field. Then I imagine the tumbling skylark crossing paths with another as it rises. My final thought is that, whether falling or rising or crossing midair, the wild, vigorous song of the skylark would never for an instant cease.","The path swung sharply round a protruding corner of rock. A blind man would have gone headlong over the edge, but I managed, at some risk, to get past and work my way round to the right. There below me, I could see the rape-blossoms spread out like a carpet over the valley. Would a lark, I wondered, go plummeting down there? — No. Perhaps, I thought, he might come soaring up from those golden fields. Then I imagined two larks, the one diving and the other climbing, crossing each other's path in flight. It finally occurred to me that, whether diving, climbing, or crossing in flight, the vitality of the song would, in all probability, continue unabated."
土をならすだけならさほど手間も入るまいが、土の中には大きな石がある。土は平らにしても石は平らにならぬ。石は切り砕いても、岩は始末がつかぬ。掘崩した土の上に悠然と峙って、吾らのために道を譲る景色はない。向うで聞かぬ上は乗り越すか、廻らなければならん。巌のない所でさえ歩るきよくはない。左右が高くって、中心が窪んで、まるで一間幅を三角に穿って、その頂点が真中を貫いていると評してもよい。路を行くと云わんより川底を渉ると云う方が適当だ。固より急ぐ旅でないから、ぶらぶらと七曲りへかかる。,"It doesn't take much effort just to smooth the soil, but there are big stones in the soil. Even if the soil is flat, the stones are not. Even if the stones are crushed, the rocks cannot be destroyed. There is no scenery to lie calmly on the excavated soil and give way for us. If you don't ask over there, you have to get over or go around. It's not easy to walk even in a place without a cliff. It can be said that the left and right sides are high, the center is dented, and the width of the ken is triangular, and the apex penetrates the center. It is more appropriate to cross the riverbed than to go down the road. It's not a rushing trip, so I'll hang around and take seven turns.","Of course the soil itself could quite easily be leveled; the trouble is that large rocks are embedded in it. Even were you to smooth the soil, there is no smoothing away these rocks, and even if the rocks were broken up, there would be no way to deal with the larger ones. They tower with serene indifference out of the broken earth of the track, innocent of any impulse to make way for the walker. Since they pay one no heed, there’s nothing for it but to climb over them or go around them. And even where there is no rock, the walking is far from easy. The sides of the path rise steeply, while the center forms a deep depression; you could describe the six-foot width as gouged into a triangular shape whose deep apex lies down the middle of the path. Making one’s way along it is more like fording a riverbed than walking a path. But it was never my intention to make this journey in haste, so I set off up the winding track, taking my time.","If it were only plain earth it would not take all that long, but imbedded in the ground are large stones. You can smooth the soil out flat, but the stones will stick up. You can break the stones into pieces, but not the rocks. There is nothing you can do about getting rid of the rocks. They sit atop the mound of broken earth unconquered, and with an almost contemptuous air of self assurance. There is nowhere here where Nature will yield us a road without a struggle. Thus since our opponent is so unaccommodating, and will not step aside, we must either climb over, or go round. This would be no easy place to walk even if there were no rocks. As it is, the banks rise up high to left and right, and a hollow has been formed in the middle of the path. This hollow may perhaps be best described in terms of geometry. It it a triangle of about six feet in width, whose sides shelve steeply down to meet in a sharp angle, which runs right along the centre of the track. This is more like walking along the bed of a river than along a path. Since from the very beginning, however, I never intended to hurry on this trip, I will take my time, and deal with the innumerable twists and turns as I come to them."

この長い振袖を着て、長い廊下を何度往き何度戻る気か、余には解からぬ。いつ頃からこの不思議な装をして、この不思議な歩行をつづけつつあるかも、余には解らぬ。その主意に至ってはもとより解らぬ。もとより解るべきはずならぬ事を、かくまでも端正に、かくまでも静粛に、かくまでも度を重ねて繰り返す人の姿の、入口にあらわれては消え、消えてはあらわるる時の余の感じは一種異様である。逝く春の恨を訴うる所作ならば何が故にかくは無頓着なる。無頓着なる所作ならば何が故にかくは綺羅を飾れる。,"I don't know how many times I'm going back and forth in the long corridor wearing this long kimono. I don't even know when I've been wearing this mysterious outfit and continuing this mysterious walk. I don't understand the main idea. The appearance of a person who repeats things that should not be understood from the beginning, neatly, quietly, and repeatedly, appears at the entrance and disappears, and disappears when it appears. The feeling is kind of strange. If it is an act that can appeal to the resentment of the dying spring, it will be indifferent for some reason. If it's a careless act, you can decorate it beautifully anyway.","I know not how many times this figure in her trailing kimono walks up and down the long balcony corridor nor how long she has performed this strange perambulation in her astonishing clothes. Nor have I the least idea what her intention might be. It’s a weird feeling, to watch her endlessly repeating her ritual, coming and going, appearing and disappearing in the frame of my doorway, so decorously and so silently, for reasons beyond my ken. If her action is some lament for the passing spring, why should it take such an insouciant form? And why should this nonchalant pose choose to clad itself in such finery?","I did not know why she had put on that gown with its long flowing sleeves, and was walking up and down the long passageway so persistently. Nor did I have any idea how long she had been at this unusual exercise dressed in such a totally unexpected way. Moreover, it was impossible to say in what, if anything, she was interested. However, it gave me a weird sensation to see this decorous and calm figure continually disappearing from view to reappear a moment later in the doorway, as she repeated her absolutely incomprehensible performance. She looked too unconcerned for this to be a lament at the passing of spring, and yet if she was unconcerned, why was she arrayed in such beautifully fine silk."

しばらくこの旅中に起る出来事と、旅中に出逢う人間を能の仕組と能役者の所作に見立てたらどうだろう。まるで人情を棄てる訳には行くまいが、根が詩的に出来た旅だから、非人情のやりついでに、なるべく節倹してそこまでは漕ぎつけたいものだ。南山や幽篁とは性の違ったものに相違ないし、また雲雀や菜の花といっしょにする事も出来まいが、なるべくこれに近づけて、近づけ得る限りは同じ観察点から人間を視てみたい。芭蕉と云う男は枕元へ馬が尿するのをさえ雅な事と見立てて発句にした。余もこれから逢う人物を――百姓も、町人も、村役場の書記も、爺さんも婆さんも――ことごとく大自然の点景として描き出されたものと仮定して取こなして見よう。もっとも画中の人物と違って、彼らはおのがじし勝手な真似をするだろう。しかし普通の小説家のようにその勝手な真似の根本を探ぐって、心理作用に立ち入ったり、人事葛藤の詮議立てをしては俗になる。動いても構わない。画中の人間が動くと見れば差し支ない。画中の人物はどう動いても平面以外に出られるものではない。平面以外に飛び出して、立方的に働くと思えばこそ、こっちと衝突したり、利害の交渉が起ったりして面倒になる。面倒になればなるほど美的に見ている訳に行かなくなる。これから逢う人間には超然と遠き上から見物する気で、人情の電気がむやみに双方で起らないようにする。そうすれば相手がいくら働いても、こちらの懐には容易に飛び込めない訳だから、つまりは画の前へ立って、画中の人物が画面の中をあちらこちらと騒ぎ廻るのを見るのと同じ訳になる。間三尺も隔てていれば落ちついて見られる。あぶな気なしに見られる。言を換えて云えば、利害に気を奪われないから、全力を挙げて彼らの動作を芸術の方面から観察する事が出来る。余念もなく美か美でないかと鑒識する事が出来る。,"Why don't you think of the events that occur during this trip for a while and the human beings you meet during the trip as the mechanism of Noh and the actions of Noh actors? I can't say that I'm abandoning humanity, but since it's a journey that has its roots poetic, I want to be as savvy as possible and row to that point in the face of inhumanity. It must be of a different sex from Nanzan and Yuka, and it cannot be combined with cloud sparrows and rape blossoms, but I would like to see humans from the same observation point as close as possible to this. A man named Basho made a haiku, thinking that even the horse urinating to the bedside was an elegant thing. Let's assume that the people I will meet-the peasants, the townspeople, the secretary of the village office, the old man and the old woman-are all depicted as a scenic view of nature. However, unlike the characters in the picture, they will imitate themselves. However, like an ordinary novelist, it becomes a profane to search for the root of the selfish imitation, to enter into the psychological action, and to argue for personnel conflicts. It doesn't matter if you move. It doesn't matter if you see the humans in the picture moving. No matter how the person in the picture moves, it cannot appear outside the plane. If you think that you will work cubicly by jumping out of the plane, it will be troublesome because of collisions and negotiations of interests. The more troublesome it is, the less aesthetically pleasing it is. I will look at the human beings I will meet from afar, so that the electricity of humanity does not occur unnecessarily on both sides. That way, no matter how much the other person works, you can't easily jump into your pocket, that is, you can stand in front of the picture and see the person in the picture roaming around the screen. It will be the same translation. It can be seen calmly if it is separated by 3 shaku. It can be seen without any rash. In other words, because you are not distracted by your interests, you can do your best to observe their movements from the artistic perspective. You can easily understand whether it is beauty or not.","How would it be if I chose to view as actions in a Noh drama the events and people I meet with in the course of this journey? Of course I can’t altogether do away with human feeling, but since this journey is essentially poetic in intent, it would be good to use the “unhuman” I seek to good effect and row its little boat as far upstream as possible. The southern hills and bamboo groves of those ancient poems are of a different nature, of course; nor can I treat humans quite as I do the skylark and mustard blossom; but my ideal is to approach that state as far as possible and do all I can to view humans from its vantage point. The poet Basho after all, found elegance even in the horse peeing by his pillow, and he composed a haiku about it.6 Let me emulate him, then, and deal with the people I meet on this journey—farmer, townsman, village clerk, old man, or old woman—on the assumption that each is a small component figure in a landscape scroll painting. Unlike figures in a painting, of course, they will all be conducting their lives with a willful independence, but to treat them as a normal novelist would—to pursue the reasons behind their individual actions, delve into their psychological workings, and go into all the ins and outs of their human entanglements—would be merely vulgar. Of course they may move about. One can view the figures in a painting as moving forms, after all. But however much they move, those figures remain confined to the flat surface. Once you conceive of them as leaping out of the painting, you’ll find them bumping up against you, and you’ll become ensnared in the troublesome business of self-interested interactions with them. And the more troublesome they become, the less able you are to view them aesthetically. No, I shall aim to observe the people I meet from a lofty and transcendent perspective, and do my best to prevent any spark of human feeling from springing up between us. Thus, however animatedly they may move hither and yon, they won’t find it easy to make the leap across to my heart; I will stand watching as before a picture, as they rush about inside it waving their arms. I can gaze with a calm and unflinching eye from the safe distance of three feet back. To express it another way: being free of self-interested motives, I will be able to devote all my energy to observing their actions from the point of view of Art. With no other thought in mind, I will be in a fine position to pass lofty judgment on the presence or absence of beauty in all I view.","I wonder how it would be if, while I am on this short journey, I were to regard events as though they were part of the action of a Noh play, and the people I meet merely as if they were actors. Since this trip is concerned fundamentally with poetry, I should like to take the opportunity of getting near to the Noh atmosphere, by curbing my emotions as much as possible, even though I know I cannot disregard them entirely. The 'Southern hills' and the 'bamboo grove', the skylark and the rape-blossom possess a character all their own, which is vastly different from that of humanity. Nevertheless, I should like, as nearly as possible, to view people from the same standpoint as I view the world of pure poetry. Bassho1 found even the sight of a horse urinating near his pillow elegant enough to write a Hokku2 about. I too from now on will regard everyone I meet, farmer, tradesman, village clerk, old man and old woman alike, as no more than a component feature of the overall canvas of Nature. I know they are different from figures in a painting, since each one I suppose will act and behave as he or she sees fit. However, I think it is just plain vulgar the way the average novelist probes the whys and wherefores of his characters' behaviour, tries to see into the workings of their minds, and pries into their daily troubles. Even if the people move it will not trouble me, for I shall just think of them as moving about in a picture; and figures in a picture, however much they may move, are confined within two dimensions. If of course you allow yourself to think that they are projected into the third dimension, then complications arise, for you will find them jostling you, and once again you will be forced to consider your clash of interests. It is clearly impossible for anyone in such a situation to view things aesthetically. From now on I am going to observe all those I meet objectively. In this way I shall avoid any undue emotional current being generated between us, and so, however animated the other person's actions may be, they will not easily affect me. In short, it will be just like standing in front of a picture, watching painted figures rush about excitedly. Three feet away from the canvas you can look at it calmly, for there is no danger of becoming involved. To put it another way, you are not robbed of your faculties by considerations of self interest, and are therefore able to devote all your energies to observing the movements of the figures from an artistic point of view. This means that you are able to give your undivided attention to judging what is, and what is not beautiful."

すでに髪結床である以上は、御客の権利として、余は鏡に向わなければならん。しかし余はさっきからこの権利を放棄したく考えている。鏡と云う道具は平らに出来て、なだらかに人の顔を写さなくては義理が立たぬ。もしこの性質が具わらない鏡を懸けて、これに向えと強いるならば、強いるものは下手な写真師と同じく、向うものの器量を故意に損害したと云わなければならぬ。虚栄心を挫くのは修養上一種の方便かも知れぬが、何も己れの真価以下の顔を見せて、これがあなたですよと、こちらを侮辱するには及ぶまい。今余が辛抱して向き合うべく余儀なくされている鏡はたしかに最前から余を侮辱している。右を向くと顔中鼻になる。左を出すと口が耳元まで裂ける。仰向くと蟇蛙を前から見たように真平に圧し潰され、少しこごむと福禄寿の祈誓児のように頭がせり出してくる。いやしくもこの鏡に対する間は一人でいろいろな化物を兼勤しなくてはならぬ。写るわが顔の美術的ならぬはまず我慢するとしても、鏡の構造やら、色合や、銀紙の剝げ落ちて、光線が通り抜ける模様などを総合して考えると、この道具その物からが醜体を極めている。小人から罵詈されるとき、罵詈それ自身は別に痛痒を感ぜぬが、その小人の面前に起臥しなければならぬとすれば、誰しも不愉快だろう。,"As long as you already have Kami-yui, you have to look in the mirror as a guest's right. However, I want to waive this right from a while ago. A tool called a mirror can be made flat, and if you don't take a gentle picture of a person's face, you can't stand in law. If you hang a mirror that doesn't have this property and force it towards it, you must say that the force, like a poor photographer, has deliberately damaged the dexterity of the other. It may be a kind of upaya for training to defeat vanity, but I can't insult you by showing a face that is less than your true value and saying that this is you. The mirror that I have been forced to face with patience is certainly insulting me from the very front. If you turn to the right, you will have a nose in your face. When you put out the left, your mouth tears to your ears. When I turned up, the frog was crushed flat as if I had seen it from the front, and when I squeezed a little, my head protruded like a prayer child of Fukurokuju. Unfortunately, I have to work alone for various things while working on this mirror. Even if I put up with the artistic appearance of my face, considering the structure of the mirror, the color, and the pattern of the silver paper falling off and the light rays passing through, this tool itself is ugly. Is extremely. When a dwarf is abusive, the abduction itself does not feel itchy, but if you had to lie down in front of the dwarf, it would be unpleasant for everyone.","My rights as a barbershop customer compel me to face a mirror. For some time now, however, I must admit I have felt the urge to forgo this privilege. A mirror fulfills its allotted purpose only if it has a flat surface that reflects the human face without distortion. If you set up a mirror that fails to meet these requirements and force a man to face it, you are committing willful damage to his features quite as much as does the bad photographer. The destruction of a man’s vanity is no doubt a valuable aid to the cultivation of character, but there’s no need to show a man a face that does less than justice to his own, then insult him by asserting that it is himself. The mirror that I’m at present compelled to gaze into has been thus insulting me for some considerable time. If I turn to the right, my face is all nose, while the left profile splits my face from mouth to ear. When I raise my head, my features are squashed flat, with an effect reminiscent of looking face-on at a toad. If I lower my face a little, my forehead suddenly towers like some freakish faery child of the long-headed god Fukurokuju.1 So long as I sit before this mirror, I am forced to double as all manner of ghoulish monster. Of course there’s no getting around the fact that my own face is far from a thing of beauty, but the glaring defects of this mirror—its poor color, and the mottled patches of light where the reflective backing has peeled off—surely make it a supremely ugly thing in its own right. Granted that only a fool will take to heart the abuses heaped on him by an obnoxious child, nevertheless no one enjoys spending any length of time in the presence of the insulting brat.","I was now required to exercise that privilege to which every customer in a barber's is entitled: namely that of inspecting himself in the mirror. This, however, is a right which since I had come into the shop I had thought I might well dispense with. A mirror is failing in its obligations unless it has an even surface, and presents a truthful image of one's face. The man who hangs a mirror which is not possessed of these qualities on the wall, and then urges you to look at yourself in it, is just as guilty of wilfully damaging your appearance as the man who says he is an expert photographer and then produces a bad picture of you. It may well be that snubbing vanity is one means of improving the character, but nevertheless, to show someone his face at less than its true value, and then to have the audacity to say, 'this is you', is unnecessarily insulting. The unavoidable mirror into which I was expected to gaze with tolerance, had most decidely been insulting me from the very outset. When I moved my head to the right my face became all nose, and when I moved it to the left my mouth became a slit which extended right up to my ears. If I lay back, I looked like the front view of a completely flattened toad; and if I leaned slightly forward, my body became foreshortened, and my head swelled up like a balloon. All the time I was in front of the mirror, I was continually changing from one monster into another. Admittedly the face which the mirror had to reflect was not very handsome, but I came to the conclusion that the monstrosity before me was produced by a combination of the mirror's faulty construction, and the fact that in places the silvering had peeled off at the back. I was not concerned by the visual abuse which was being hurled at me, but as I am sure anyone else would have done, I found it unpleasant to have to sit before my warped tormentor for any length of time."

見ていると、ぽたり赤い奴が水の上に落ちた。静かな春に動いたものはただこの一輪である。しばらくするとまたぽたり落ちた。あの花は決して散らない。崩れるよりも、かたまったまま枝を離れる。枝を離れるときは一度に離れるから、未練のないように見えるが、落ちてもかたまっているところは、何となく毒々しい。またぽたり落ちる。ああやって落ちているうちに、池の水が赤くなるだろうと考えた。花が静かに浮いている辺は今でも少々赤いような気がする。また落ちた。地の上へ落ちたのか、水の上へ落ちたのか、区別がつかぬくらい静かに浮く。また落ちる。あれが沈む事があるだろうかと思う。年々落ち尽す幾万輪の椿は、水につかって、色が溶け出して、腐って泥になって、ようやく底に沈むのかしらん。幾千年の後にはこの古池が、人の知らぬ間に、落ちた椿のために、埋もれて、元の平地に戻るかも知れぬ。また一つ大きいのが血を塗った、人魂のように落ちる。また落ちる。ぽたりぽたりと落ちる。際限なく落ちる。,"As I watched, a red guy fell on the water. It is only this one that moved in the quiet spring. After a while, it fell off again. That flower never scatters. Rather than crumble, leave the branch in a lump. When you leave a branch, you leave it all at once, so it looks like it's not undeveloped, but it's kind of poisonous where it's stuck even if it falls. It will fall again. I thought that the water in the pond would turn red while it was falling. The area where the flowers are floating quietly still feels a little red. It fell again. It floats so quietly that it is indistinguishable whether it has fallen on the ground or on the water. It will fall again. I wonder if that could sink. I wonder if the tens of thousands of camellias that fall out year by year will be soaked in water, their colors will melt, they will rot and become mud, and they will finally sink to the bottom. Thousands of years later, this old pond may be buried and returned to its original plains due to the fallen camellia without the knowledge of humans. Another big one is bloody, falling like a human soul. It will fall again. It falls off. It falls endlessly.","As I watch, one of these red creatures plops onto the water. In all the quietness of that spring moment, only this flower has motion. A little while later another drops. These flowers never scatter their petals when they fall. They part from the branch whole and unbroken. The parting is so clean that they may strike us as admirably resolute and unclinging, yet there’s something malignant in the sight of them lying whole where they have fallen. Another drops. If this continues, I think, the pool’s water will grow red with them; indeed, the area surrounding these quietly floating flowers seems already tinged with crimson. There goes another. It floats there so still that one can scarcely guess whether it has landed on solid earth or on water. Another falls. Do they ever sink? I wonder. Perhaps the million camellia blooms that fall through the years lie steeped in water till the color leaches from them, till they rot, and finally disintegrate to mud on the bottom. Perhaps thousands of years hence and unbeknownst to men, all the fallen camellias will eventually fill this ancient pool till it reverts to the flat plain it once was. And now yet another tumbles to bloody the water, like a human soul in death. And another. A little shower of them plops to the water. Endlessly, they fall.","As I stood watching, a red flower hit the water, providing the only movement in the stillness of spring. After a while it was followed by another. Camellia flowers never drift down petal by petal, but drop from the branch intact. Although this in itself is not particularity unpleasant since it merely suggests an indifference to parting, the way in which they remain whole even when they have landed is both gross and offensive to the eye. If they continue like this, I thought, they will stain the whole pond red. Already the water in the immediate vicinity of the peacefully floating blossoms seemed to have a reddish tint. Yet another flower dropped and remained as motionless as if it had come to rest on the bank. There goes another. I wondered whether this one would sink. Perhaps over the years millions of camellia blossoms would steep in the water and, having surrendered their colour, would rot and eventually turn to mud on the bottom. If that should happen, then they might imperceptibly build up the bed of this old stagnating pond until in thousands of years time the whole area would return to the plain it had been originally. Now a large bloom plunged downwards like a blood-smeared phantom. Another fell, and another, striking the water like a shower of pattering raindrops."

There is music and sculpture. In detail, you don't have to copy it. If you look around, poetry will live and songs will spring up there. Even if you don't put your ideas on paper, the sound of the sword will occur in the back of your chest. Even if Dancheong is smeared toward the easel, the gorgeousness of Gosai is reflected in his own eyes. It is enough if you can see the world in which you live and capture the world of ghosts in a ghostly camera. For this reason, there is no word for a silent poet, and for a colorless painter, there is no shaku, in terms of being able to see the human world, in terms of relieving the worldly desires, and in terms of being able to enter and leave the clean world. Also, in terms of being able to build this colorless and colorless soul, and in terms of clearing the bond of selfishness-more happiness than a child of a thousand gold, a prince of the world, and a darling of all the world. Is.","Yes, a poem, a painting, can draw the sting of troubles from a troubled world and lay in its place a blessed realm before our grateful eyes. Music and sculpture will do likewise. Yet strictly speaking, in fact, there is no need to present this world in art. You have only to conjure the world up before you, and there you will find a living poem, a fount of song. No need to commit your thoughts to paper—the heart will already sing with a sweet inner euphony. No need to stand before your easel and limn with brush and paint—the world’s vast array of forms and colors already sparkles within the inner eye. It is enough simply to be able thus to view the place we live, and to garner with the camera of the sentient heart these pure, limpid images from the midst of our sullied world. And so even if no verse ever emerges from the mute poet, even if the painter never sets brush to canvas, he is happier than the wealthiest of men, happier than any strong-armed emperor or pampered child of this vulgar world of ours—for he can view human life with an artist’s eye; he is released from the world’s illusory sufferings; he is able to come and go at ease in a realm of transcendent purity, to construct a unique universe of art, and thereby to destroy the binding fetters of self-interest and desire. When I had lived in this world for twenty years, I understood that it was a world worth living in.","Strip off from the world all those cares and worries which make it an unpleasant place in which to live, and picture before you instead a world of graciousness. You now have music, a painting, or poetry, or sculpture. I would go farther, and say that it is not even necessary to make this vision a reality. Merely conjure up the image before your eyes, and poetry will burst into life and songs pour forth. Before even committing your thoughts to paper, you will feel the crystal tinkling, as of a tiny bell, well up within you; and the whole range of colours will of their own accord, and in all their brilliance, imprint themselves on your mind's eye, though your canvas stands on its easel, as yet untouched by the brush. It is enough that you are able to take this view of life, and see this decadent, sullied and vulgar world purified and beautiful in the camera of your innermost soul. Even the poet whose thoughts have never found expression in a single verse, or the painter who possesses no colours, and has never painted so much as a single square foot of canvas, can obtain salvation, and be delivered from earthly desires and passions. They can enter at will a world of undefiled purity, and throwing off the yoke of avarice and self interest, are able to build up a peerless and unequalled universe. Thus in all this, they are happier than the rich and famous; than any lord or prince that ever lived; happier indeed than all those on whom this vulgar world lavishes her affections. After twenty years of life I realised that this is a world worth living in."

There would have been no applicants for the job of standing at Nihonbashi and waving a flag to direct the trams were it not for the fact that the people a man in such a position meets come as strangers, and as strangers they go on their way. Fortunately, the angler did not ask Kyuichi for an explanation as to why he looked as though at any moment he was going to cry. Looking back, I saw that he was staring at his float contentedly. I expect he would have liked to sit there staring at it until the Russo-Japanese war was over."

ああ出来た、出来た。これで出来た。寝ながら木瓜を観て、世の中を忘れている感じがよく出た。木瓜が出なくっても、海が出なくっても、感じさえ出ればそれで結構である。と唸りながら、喜んでいると、エヘンと云う人間の咳払が聞えた。こいつは驚いた。,"Oh, it's done, it's done. It's done.

Although the characters are sleeping, they are clearly read as Takekage-dori floor dust immovable. It seems that the seal of Daitetsu is also true. I'm a man who is completely unscrupulous in the book, but from Hirao, I love the writing of Obaku's Osho Takaizumi. Ingen, Sokuhi Nyoitsu, and Mu'an are all interesting, but Takaizumi's character is the most blue and elegant. Looking at these seven characters now, I can only think of Takaizumi as the way the hand is carried from around the brush. However, it is a different person because it is actually Daitetsu. Perhaps there was a shaven named Daitetsu in Obaku. The color of the paper is very new for that. I can only accept it as a recent one.","Lying there on my back, I happen to open my eyes and notice hanging above the sliding doors a piece of calligraphy framed in red lacquer. Even from where I lie, I can clearly read the words: “Bamboo shadows sweep the stair, but no dust moves. ”2 I can also make out that the signature seal gives the calligrapher’s name as Daitetsu. Now I am in no way a connoisseur of calligraphy, but I have always loved the style of the Obaku Zen priest Kosen. There’s a lot to be said for the calligraphy of Ingen, Sokuhi, and Mokuan as well,3 but Kosen’s writing is the most powerful and meticulous. Looking at these seven characters before me now, both the handling of the brush and the flow of the writing hand convince me that it must be the work of Kosen. But this cannot be so, as the signature is Daitetsu. I consider the possibility that there might also have been a priest named Daitetsu in the Obaku sect at that time, but the paper looks far too new. It can surely only be a recent work.","I was lying dozing in bed when, opening my eyes, I happened to see high up on the wall a scroll in a red-lacquered frame. Even lying on my back as I was, I could read clearly the Chinese characters written on it. They said: Bamboo sweeps across the stairs, But no dust rises For 'its but a shadow. It was signed 'Daitetsu'. I am by no means a connoisseur of art, but I have always loved the style of calligraphy of Takaizumi who was a priest of the Obaku sect.1 Ogen, Sokuhi and Mokuan all have their good points too, but Takaizumi's writing is the boldest and most elegant of all. Looking at these characters on the scroll, I was certain that they had been written by Takaizumi, because of the light and shade in the strokes, and because of the movement of the brush. But the signature 'Daitetsu' showed that in fact I was mistaken. Perhaps, I thought, Daitetsu had also been a priest of the Obaku sect. If this were so, however, I could not account for the fact that the paper looked so extraordinarily new. Yes, there was no doubt about it, this scroll had been written very recently."

The place where you can see the train is called the real world. Nothing is more representative of the civilization of the 20th century than a train. Hundreds of people are packed in the same box and go through. There is no mercy. All the crammed humans have to stay at the same stop at about the same speed and then bathe in the steaming benefits as well. People say they get on the train. It is said that I will be loaded. People say they go by train. I am said to be transported. Nothing despise personality as much as a train. Civilization uses every possible means to develop an individuality and then tries to trample this individuality in every possible way. It is the current civilization to give a few tsubo of ground for one person and to sleep or wake up on this ground. At the same time, it is the current civilization that an iron fence is set up around this tsubo and tsubo, and it threatens that we should not take a step further than this. It is a natural force that the one who made freedom out of the tsubo is wanting to make freedom outside this iron fence. The people of a merciful civilization are roaring at this iron fence day and night. Civilization is giving freedom to individuals and slamming them like tigers, then throwing them into cages to maintain peace in the world. This peace is not true peace. It's as peaceful as a zoo tiger glaring at a spectator and lying down. If even one iron bar in the cage comes off-the world will be messed up. The Second French-Lanxi Revolution France will occur at this time. The personal revolution is already happening day and night. The great Nordic Ibsen gave me a detailed illustration of the state of the revolution. Every time I see the train running fiercely, invisible, and knowing that everyone is as good as freight, I pay close attention to the individual who is trapped in the passenger car and the individuality of the individual. Compared to this iron car that doesn't pay, it's dangerous, it's dangerous. I think I have to be careful. Modern civilization is so full that it can be struck by the nose. The train, which is blind to the darkness, is one of the dangerous specimens.","We are being dragged yet deeper into the real world, which I define as the world that contains trains. Nothing can be more quintessentially representative of twentieth-century civilization than the steam train. It roars along, packed tight with hundreds of people in the one box, merciless in its progress, and all those hundreds crammed in there must travel at the same speed, stop at the same places, and submit to a baptismal submersion in the same swirling steam. Some say that people “ride” in a train, but I would say they are thrust into it; some speak of “going” by train, but it seems to me they are transported by it. Nothing is more disdainful of individuality. Having expended all its means to develop the individual, civilization then proceeds to crush it by all possible means. Present civilization gives each person his little patch of earth and tells him he may wake and sleep as he pleases on it—but then it throws up an iron railing around it, and threatens us with dire consequences if we should put a foot outside this barrier. Those who can act as they please in their own little patch naturally feel the urge to do the same beyond it, so the pitiful citizens of this world spend their days biting and raging at the boundary fence that hems them in. Civilization, having given individuals their freedom and turned them into wild beasts thereby, then maintains the peace by throwing these unfortunates behind bars. This isn’t real peace, it’s the peace of the zoo, where the tiger lies in his cage glaring out at the gaping sightseers. Should one bar of that cage come loose, the world would fall apart. Then we will have our second French Revolution. Indeed, the revolution is already under way night and day among individuals; the great European playwright Ibsen has provided us with detailed examples of the conditions necessary for it to occur. I must say, whenever I see one of those fierce trains hurtling along, treating all on board indiscriminately as so much freight, and mentally balance the individuals crammed in there against the train’s utter disregard for their individuality—I can only say, Watch out, this could be nasty if you’re not careful! Modern civilization in fact reeks of such dangers. The steam train hurtling blindly into the darkness ahead is simply one of them.","I was being dragged back more and more into the world of reality. Anywhere that you can find a railway train must be classed as the world of reality, for there is nothing more typical of twentieth-century civilization. It is an unsympathetic and heartless contraption which rumbles along carrying hundreds of people crammed together in one box. It takes them all at a uniform speed to the same station, and then proceeds to lavish the benefits of steam upon every one of them without exception. People are said to board and travel by train, but I call it being loaded and transported. Nothing shows a greater contempt for individuality than the train. Modern civilization uses every possible means to develop individuality, and having done so, tries everything in its power to stamp it out It allots a few square yards to each person, and tells him that he is free to lead his life as he pleases within that area. At the same time it erects railings around him, and threatens him with all sorts of dire consequences if he should dare to take but one step beyond their compass. It is only natural that the man who has freedom within the confines of his allocated plot, should desire to have freedom to do as he wishes outside it too. Civilization's pitiable subjects are forever snapping and snarling at imprisoning bars, for they have been made as fierce as tigers by the gift of liberty, but have been thrown into a cage to preserve universal peace. This, however, is not a true peace. It is the peace of the tiger in a menagerie who lies glowering at those who have come to look at him. If just one bar is ever taken out of the cage, the world will erupt into chaos, and a second French Revolution will ensue. Even now there are constant individual revolts. That great North-European writer, Ibsen, has cited in detail the circumstances which will lead to this outbreak. Whenever I see the violent way in which a train runs along, indiscriminately regarding all human beings as so much freight, I look at the individuals cooped up in the carriages, and at the iron monster itself which cares nothing at all for individuality, and I think, 'Look out, look out, or you'll find yourselves in trouble.' The railway train which blunders ahead blindly into the pitch darkness is one example of the very obvious dangers which abound in modern civilization."

生れてから、こんな経験はただ一度しかない。昔し房州を館山から向うへ突き抜けて、上総から銚子まで浜伝いに歩行た事がある。その時ある晩、ある所へ宿た。ある所と云うよりほかに言いようがない。今では土地の名も宿の名も、まるで忘れてしまった。第一宿屋へとまったのかが問題である。棟の高い大きな家に女がたった二人いた。余がとめるかと聞いたとき、年を取った方がはいと云って、若い方がこちらへと案内をするから、ついて行くと、荒れ果てた、広い間をいくつも通り越して一番奥の、中二階へ案内をした。三段登って廊下から部屋へ這入ろうとすると、板庇の下に傾きかけていた一叢の修竹が、そよりと夕風を受けて、余の肩から頭を撫でたので、すでにひやりとした。椽板はすでに朽ちかかっている。来年は筍が椽を突き抜いて座敷のなかは竹だらけになろうと云ったら、若い女が何にも云わずににやにやと笑って、出て行った。,"I have only had this experience once since I was born. Once upon a time, I pierced through Boshu from Tateyama and walked along the beach from Kazusa to Choshi. At that time, one night, I stayed at a certain place. There is no other way to say it than one place. Now I have forgotten the name of the land and the name of the inn. The problem is whether I stopped at the first inn. There were only two women in a large, tall house. When I asked if I would stop, the older one would be better, and the younger one would guide me to this place, so when I followed, I passed through a number of desolate, wide spaces, and the mezzanine floor at the back. I guided you to. When I climbed three steps and tried to crawl into the room from the corridor, a group of Shutake, who was leaning under the eaves, was struck by the evening breeze and stroked his head from my shoulder, so it was already cool. did. The rafters are already decaying. Next year, when the bamboo shoots pierced the rafters and the tatami room was full of bamboo, the young woman grinned and went out without saying anything.","I have had this experience only once before. It was the time I traveled across Boshu province1 from Tateyama and followed the coast around on foot between Kazusa and Choshi. One night I stayed at a certain place along the road —I can’t put it any more clearly, since both the name of the area and the name of the inn are now quite forgotten. In fact, I’m not even sure it was an inn where I stayed. It was a high-roofed house, containing only two women. I asked if they could put me up; the older woman said yes, and the younger invited me to follow her. We passed through a number of large, dilapidated rooms to the farthest room, on the mezzanine floor. Having mounted the three steps from the corridor, I was about to enter the room when a clump of bamboo leaning in under the eaves swayed in the evening breeze and brushed its leaves over me from shoulder to head, sending a chill down my spine. The balcony boards were rotting. I observed to the girl that in another year the bamboo shoots would penetrate the balcony and the room would become overwhelmed by bamboo, but her only response was to grin and leave.","Only once before had I ever had such an experience. A long time ago I went from Tateyama right across the province of Boshu to the Pacific coast, and then following the coastline I walked from Kazusa to Chosi. One evening during the trip I stopped somewhere and asked if I could put up there for the night. I say somewhere because I can no longer remember the name of the inn, or whereabouts it was. In fact I am not even sure that it was an inn at all. It was a large high house in which two women lived all alone. In reply to my request to stay the night, the elder of the two said,'Certainly,' and the younger one said,'This way, please.' She led me to the centre of the house past one spacious room after another, each of which was in a state of dilapidation and disrepair. The ground floor in this part of the house was built on a split level, and I had to go up three steps to get to my room. Just as I was about to go from the passageway into the room, a clump of bamboo growing slantwise under the eaves was caught by the evening breeze, and brushed first against my shoulders, and then up the back of my neck. A shiver of fear ran through me. The floor boards of the verandah were already badly decayed, and I remarked that next year the shoots would push their way through, and the room would be alive with bamboo. The young woman gave a broad grin, but went out without saying a word."
なるほど達磨の画が小さい床に掛っている。しかし画としてはすこぶるまずいものだ。ただ俗気がない。拙を蔽おうと力めているところが一つもない。無邪気な画だ。この先代もやはりこの画のような構わない人であったんだろう。,"Indeed, Daruma's painting hangs on a small floor. However, it is a very bad picture. It's just not profane. There is no place that is trying to cover me. It's an innocent picture. This predecessor must have been a person like this picture.","I look at the Bodhidharma painting on the scroll in the little alcove. As a painting, it’s dreadful. All you can say for it is that it’s not vulgarly ambitious. The painter has made not the slightest attempt to conceal its clumsiness. It is a naïve work. This predecessor must have been a similar type, someone who cared nothing for pretension.","Sure enough there was a scroll painting of Dharma Buddha hanging in a small alcove. As a picture it was, however, atrocious. All that could be said for it was that it was not vulgar or worldly, and the artist had made no attempt to cover up his lack of skill. It was an unsophisticated painting."
山が尽きて、岡となり、岡が尽きて、幅三丁ほどの平地となり、その平地が尽きて、海の底へもぐり込んで、十七里向うへ行ってまた隆然と起き上って、周囲六里の摩耶島となる。これが那古井の地勢である。温泉場は岡の麓を出来るだけ崖へさしかけて、岨の景色を半分庭へ囲い込んだ一構であるから、前面は二階でも、後ろは平屋になる。椽から足をぶらさげれば、すぐと踵は苔に着く。道理こそ昨夕は楷子段をむやみに上ったり、下ったり、異な仕掛の家と思ったはずだ。,"The mountains are exhausted, the hills are exhausted, the hills are exhausted, and the plains are about three widths wide. It becomes Maya Island in the surrounding Rokuri. This is the terrain of Nakoi. The hot spring resort is a structure where the foot of the oka is pushed to the cliff as much as possible and the view of the 岨 is half enclosed in the garden, so even if the front is on the second floor, the back is a one-story house. If you hang your feet from the rafters, your heels will soon reach the moss. You must have thought that it was a house with a different mechanism, such as going up and down the Yasukodan unnecessarily last evening.","Casting my eyes farther, I see that the mountain slopes down to a hill, which in turn sinks to an area of flat land about four hundred yards wide. This in turn dives below sea level, to emerge abruptly from the water about forty miles out, in the form of Mayajima, a small island that I guess to be less than fifteen miles in circumference. Such is the geography of the Nakoi area. The hot spring inn is tucked in against the mountainside, its garden half-embracing the cliff face. The building is a two-storied one, but here at the back, owing to the slope, it becomes a single floor. If I dangled my feet from this balcony, my heels would brush the moss. It makes perfect sense that the previous evening I thought the place to be strangely devised, as I clambered in perplexity up and down its steep staircases.","The mountain sloped down to become a hill, and the hill sloped down to a level strip of land about a quarter of a mile in width. This in its turn shelved down into the sea and rose again sharply forty miles away to form the island of Mayajima, which was about fifteen miles in circumference. Such then was the geography of Nakoi. The hot-spring hotel had been closely terraced against the foot of the hill, and its garden extended about half way up, making full use of the rugged scenery. This made it seem that house and hillside were but a single unit; the one complementing the other. There were two storeys at the front, but only one at the back, so sitting on the verandah and dangling my legs over the edge, I was easily able to touch the moss below. I could now see why I had had to go up and down all those flights of stairs, and why I had thought that the house was so strangely planned."

議論はどうでもよい。ラオコーンなどは大概忘れているのだから、よく調べたら、こっちが怪しくなるかも知れない。とにかく、画にしそくなったから、一つ詩にして見よう、と写生帖の上へ、鉛筆を押しつけて、前後に身をゆすぶって見た。しばらくは、筆の先の尖がった所を、どうにか運動させたいばかりで、毫も運動させる訳に行かなかった。急に朋友の名を失念して、咽喉まで出かかっているのに、出てくれないような気がする。そこで諦めると、出損なった名は、ついに腹の底へ収まってしまう。,"I don't care about the discussion. I usually forget about Laocoon, so if you look closely, you might be suspicious. Anyway, I got sick of the picture, so I pressed a pencil on the sketch book and shook myself back and forth to see it as a poem. For a while, I just wanted to somehow exercise the pointed part of the brush, so I couldn't even exercise the háo. Suddenly I forgot my friend's name, and even though I'm out to my throat, I feel like he won't come out. If you give up there, the name you missed will finally fit into the bottom of your stomach.","But what does theory matter? I have largely forgotten the contents of Lessing’s Laocoön, but if I were to look thoroughly into it, I imagine I’d only become confused. Since I have failed to produce a picture, I decide at any rate to try a poem, and pressing my pencil to the page of the sketchbook I rock myself to and fro, waiting for something to emerge. I continue in this way for some time, hoping somehow to be able to move the point of my pencil from where it rests on the page, but quite without success. The experience feels rather like suddenly forgetting the name of a friend, having it on the tip of your tongue but being unable to produce it. You know that if you give up trying, the elusive name is likely to sink forever beyond reach. Imagine you set out to mix a gruel of arrowroot.","Well that is enough of argument. I have forgotten most of Laokoon1 and it is quite possible that if I read it through carefully I might find that I was on rather uncertain ground. Anyway, I had decided to try my hand at poetry since I had failed to produce a picture, and I sat rocking my body backwards and forwards, my pencil pressed firmly to the page. I tried and tried to make the point of that pencil move, but for some time I had no success whatsoever. Imagine that all at once you forget a friend's name. You feel that it is on the tip of your tongue, yet somehow it just will not come out. You know, however, that unless you keep on trying to remember, the name will slip back into the recesses of your mind. This is exactly the feeling one has when attempting to compose poetry. Let me take a more concrete example to illustrate the point."

All the 56 Jalan Jalan that I met in the forefront would have gone down the mountain in the belly of this old woman, and climbed the mountain. Through the loneliness of the road and the spring of ancient and modern times, in a small village where there is no place to wear flowers if you don't mind the flowers, the old woman has been counting on Jalan for many years, and it seems that she has reached today's white head.","Since there is only one path across the mountains, all who come and go must pass her teahouse. Each of those five or six horses I’ve met would have come down the path, and climbed back up it again, to these same murmured words. Here in this tiny settlement, strewn blossom-deep wherever feet might tread, down the years she has counted the bells, through the changeless springs along the hushed and lonely road, till now her hair is white with the years of counting. Turning over a page, I write The driver’s song—","Since there was only the one road, everybody, both coming and going, passed close enough to the tea-house to be seen. Each one of those five or six horses I had met recently must, with the jingling of its bells, have made the old woman think, 'Ah, here comes someone else,' only to pass on its way up or down the mountain. In that tiny village, where if you did not like flowers there was nowhere to walk, she had lived with the loneliness of the track through one spring after another. I wondered for just how long she had been living there, counting the times she heard the bells day in day out, her hair growing whiter with each succeeding year.

会話はちょっと途切れる。帳面をあけて先刻の鶏を静かに写生していると、落ちついた耳の底へじゃらんじゃらんと云う馬の鈴が聴え出した。この声がおのずと、拍子をとって頭の中に一種の調子が出来る。眠りながら、夢に隣りの臼の音に誘われるような心持ちである。余は鶏の写生をやめて、同じページの端に、,"The conversation is a little interrupted. When I opened the notebook and quietly sketched the chicken, I heard a horse bell called Jalan to the bottom of my calm ears. This voice naturally takes a beat and creates a kind of tone in my head. While sleeping, I feel like I'm invited by the sound of the mortar next to me in my dreams. I stopped copying chickens, and at the end of the same page,","The conversation flags. I open up my sketchbook again and peacefully set about sketching the chickens. Then, deep in the quietness, the soft clang of a distant horse bell begins to penetrate my ears. It sets up a rhythm inside my head that grows into a kind of tune. It’s like the dreamy feeling of being half aware, as you doze, of the soft, insistent sound of a hand mill turning next door. I pause in my sketching to jot down on the side of the page","At this point we both lapsed into silence. I picked up my book again, and was quietly sketching the chickens, when the steady jingling of horse-bells reached my ears. Indeed it penetrated them to the very depths. This jingling had a rhythm all its own, and the monotonous regularity of it beat round and round in my head. I felt just as though the hand-mill which stood next to me were lulling me into a dream with its rhythmic grinding. I stopped sketching the chickens, and wrote on the same page:"

この境界を画にして見たらどうだろうと考えた。しかし普通の画にはならないにきまっている。われらが俗に画と称するものは、ただ眼前の人事風光をありのままなる姿として、もしくはこれをわが審美眼に漉過して、絵絹の上に移したものに過ぎぬ。花が花と見え、水が水と映り、人物が人物として活動すれば、画の能事は終ったものと考えられている。もしこの上に一頭地を抜けば、わが感じたる物象を、わが感じたるままの趣を添えて、画布の上に淋漓として生動させる。ある特別の感興を、己が捕えたる森羅の裡に寓するのがこの種の技術家の主意であるから、彼らの見たる物象観が明瞭に筆端に迸しっておらねば、画を製作したとは云わぬ。己れはしかじかの事を、しかじかに観、しかじかに感じたり、その観方も感じ方も、前人の籬下に立ちて、古来の伝説に支配せられたるにあらず、しかももっとも正しくして、もっとも美くしきものなりとの主張を示す作品にあらざれば、わが作と云うをあえてせぬ。,"I wondered if I could see this boundary as a picture. However, it has been decided that it will not be an ordinary picture. What we commonly call paintings is nothing more than the appearance of the human resources in front of us as they are, or the ones that have been passed through to my aesthetic eyes and transferred onto the silk. If the flower looks like a flower, the water is reflected as water, and the person acts as a person, it is thought that the Noh of the painting is over. If you pass through a single land on this, you can make the object that you feel as a lonely man on the painting cloth, adding the taste that you feel. It is the main intention of this kind of technician to put a certain special impression on the sword of Morira that he has captured. I don't say I made it. I see and feel the thing directly, and the way I see and feel it is not controlled by the ancient legends, standing under the hedge of the predecessor, and it is the most correct. And if it comes to a work that claims to be the most beautiful, I wouldn't dare to call it my work.","How might I go about expressing this state in terms of a picture? No ordinary picture could embody it, that’s quite certain. What we express with the word “picture” amounts to no more than the scene before our eyes, human figures or landscape, translated either just as it appears or through the filtering of aesthetic vision onto the surface we work on. If a flower looks like a flower, if water looks like water, and if human figures behave in the picture like humans, people consider the work of the picture done. A greater artist, however, will impart his own feelings as he depicts the phenomena and bring them to vivid life on the canvas. Such an artist endeavors to imbue the object he perceives with his own particular inspiration, and he does not feel he has created a picture unless his vision of the phenomenal world leaps from the brush as he paints. He will not venture to call a work his own if he does not feel that he has seen a certain thing in a certain way, felt in a certain way about it, and expressed that way of seeing and feeling with all due respect to the masters of his art, drawing sustenance from the old legends while nevertheless creating a work that is both utterly true and thoroughly beautiful.","I wondered how it would be if I tried to express this condition on canvas, although I realised of course that it was not at all suitable material for a conventional picture. What the majority of people call a picture is nothing more than a direct reprint on silk of what the painter has seen around him, possibly after it has been filtered through an aesthetically critical eye. For them a picture has fulfilled its purpose if a flower looks like a flower, water reflects the light like water, and people behave as they do in real life. The only way the artist can create a painting which is not just simply run of the mill, is to bring his subject to life by giving it his own interpretation. No artist who tries to do this would consider that he had succeeded in producing a picture, unless his own personal viewpoint were apparent in every single brush stroke, for he is concerned with trying to highlight exactly what it is about the corner of Creation he is embracing that has inspired him. Moreover, he would not make so bold as to claim that the picture were his own unless it clearly expressed his conviction, that although his opinions and perceptions owe nothing to those who have gone before, and are not governed by old traditions, yet nevertheless they are the most correct and the most beautiful."

少時、晁補之と云う人の記行文を読んで、いまだに暗誦している句がある。「時に九月天高く露清く、山空しく、月明かに、仰いで星斗を視れば皆光大、たまたま人の上にあるがごとし、窓間の竹数十竿、相摩戞して声切々やまず。竹間の梅棕森然として鬼魅の離立笑髩の状のごとし。二三子相顧み、魄動いて寝るを得ず。遅明皆去る」とまた口の内で繰り返して見て、思わず笑った。この覇王樹も時と場合によれば、余の魄を動かして、見るや否や山を追い下げたであろう。刺に手を触れて見ると、いらいらと指をさす。,"When I was little, I read the writings of a man named Pu-chih Ch'oh, and there is a phrase that I still recite.

I have to move and sleep with a few children. I laughed unintentionally. In some cases, this overlord tree would have moved my sword and, as soon as I saw it, chased down the mountain. When I touch the stab and look at it, I irritate and point my finger.","In my youth, I read a travel journal by one Chao Buzhi,3 and I can still recite some of it:It was in the ninth month—sky deep, dew pure and limpid, mountains empty, and the moon bright. When I looked up, all the stars were shining hugely, as if poised directly overhead. Outside the window a dozen bamboo stems, ceaselessly rustling as they brushed together. Beyond the bamboo, plum trees and palms crowded thick, like wild-haired witches. I and my companions looked at each other; we were all unnerved, and could not sleep. We departed as dawn was breaking. Here I pause in my mumbled recitation and suddenly laugh. With a small adjustment in time and place, these cactuses might have unnerved me in just such a way and sent me fleeing down the mountain at the sight of them. I touch a spine with my finger and feel its irritable stab.","When I was a boy, I read an account by the classical Chinese writer Ch'ao Pu-chih of a journey he once made, and there is one passage which I can still quote from memory. I repeated the words over to myself. It was the ninth month of the year. Not a cloud obscured the vault of heaven. The dew lay pure upon the ground and the mountains were deserted. The moon was bright, and the stars, which shone brilliantly, seemed to have been casually scattered across the sky. Cast on the shōji were the shadows of a thousand bamboo stems from which the passing wind drew a ceaseless rustling whisper. Between the bamboos could be seen a host of plum and palm trees like hobgoblins with hair in spiky disarray. My companions discussed this with each other, and it so disturbed them that they were unable to sleep. The next morning we departed. Suddenly I burst out laughing. Given the right combination of time and place I too might have been disturbed by these cactus plants, and gone scuttling down the mountainside as soon as I had caught sight of them.

日本の菫は眠っている感じである。「天来の奇想のように」、と形容した西人の句はとうていあてはまるまい。こう思う途端に余の足はとまった。足がとまれば、厭になるまでそこにいる。いられるのは、幸福な人である。東京でそんな事をすれば、すぐ電車に引き殺される。電車が殺さなければ巡査が追い立てる。都会は太平の民を乞食と間違えて、掏摸の親分たる探偵に高い月俸を払う所である。,"Japanese 菫 feels asleep.

Now once your feet have stopped moving, you can find yourself standing in one place for an inordinate length of time—and lucky is the man who can do so. If your feet suddenly halt on a Tokyo street, you will very soon be killed by a passing tram, or moved on by a policeman. Peaceful folk are treated like beggars in the city, while fine wages are paid to detectives, who are no better than petty criminals.","In Japan, violets always give the impression that they are dozing. By no stretch of the imagination could one call them 'a flash of divine inspiration* as did one Western poet. It was just as my thoughts reached this point that I realised I had stopped walking. I decided to remain where I was until I grew bored with the place, and considered myself very lucky to be able to do so.

轟と音がして山の樹がことごとく鳴る。思わず顔を見合わす途端に、机の上の一輪挿に活けた、椿がふらふらと揺れる。「地震！」と小声で叫んだ女は、膝を崩して余の机に靠りかかる。御互の身軀がすれすれに動く。キキーと鋭どい羽摶をして一羽の雉子が藪の中から飛び出す。,"There is a roaring sound and all the trees in the mountains ring. As soon as I met my face, the camellia that was used for the one-wheel insert on the desk shook. The woman who shouted, ""Earthquake!"" Each other's body moves smoothly. A pheasant jumps out of the bush with a sharp feather with a pheasant.","There is a sudden deep rumble, and all the trees on the nearby mountain moan and rustle. Our eyes turn to each other instinctively, and at this moment the camellia in the little vase on the desk trembles. “An earthquake!” she cries softly, shifting from her knees and leaning forward against the desk where I sit. Our bodies brush each other as they shake. With a high-pitched clatter of wings, a pheasant bursts out of the thicket close by. “Wasn’t that a pheasant?”","Suddenly there came a deep rumbling, followed by the creaking and groaning of every tree on the mountainside. As we turned instinctively towards each other, I noticed that the solitary camellia spray which was in a small vase on my desk was swinging to and fro. ' Earthquake!' gasped the woman in a frightened whisper, and relaxing her formal kneeling posture, she sank sideways into a sitting position and rested her arms on the desk. Slowly our two bodies moved closer together. At that moment with a staccato beating of wings a pheasant flew out of the nearby bamboo thicket."

たちまち足の下で雲雀の声がし出した。谷を見下したが、どこで鳴いてるか影も形も見えぬ。ただ声だけが明らかに聞える。せっせと忙しく、絶間なく鳴いている。方幾里の空気が一面に蚤に刺されていたたまれないような気がする。あの鳥の鳴く音には瞬時の余裕もない。のどかな春の日を鳴き尽くし、鳴きあかし、また鳴き暮らさなければ気が済まんと見える。その上どこまでも登って行く、いつまでも登って行く。雲雀はきっと雲の中で死ぬに相違ない。登り詰めた揚句は、流れて雲に入って、漂うているうちに形は消えてなくなって、ただ声だけが空の裡に残るのかも知れない。,"Immediately, a skylark's voice began to appear under my feet. I looked down at the valley, but I couldn't see the shadow or shape of where it was ringing. Only the voice can be heard clearly. He is busy and singing constantly. I feel like the air of Hokurari was stabbed by fleas all over and I couldn't get rid of it. The sound of that bird can't afford to be instant. If you don't squeal, squeal, and squeal on a peaceful spring day, you'll feel like you're done. Besides, I will climb forever, I will climb forever. The skylark must die in the clouds. The climbing phrase may flow into the clouds, disappear in shape while drifting, and only the voice may remain in the sky.","Suddenly a skylark bursts into song, directly beneath my feet. I gaze down into the valley but can see no sign of the creature. Only its voice rings out. The rapid notes pour busily forth, without pause. It’s as if the whole boundless air were being tormented by the thousand tiny bites of a swarm of fleas. Not for an instant does the bird’s outpouring of song falter; it seems it must sing this soft spring day right to its close, sing it into light and then sing it into darkness again. Up and up the skylark climbs, on and on—it will surely find its death deep in that sky. On and up it climbs, slipping at last into the clouds, and there perhaps its floating form dissolves, so that finally only that voice is left hanging in the far reaches of the heavens.","Immediately below me a lark burst suddenly into song. But gaze down into the valley as I would, I could see no sign of the bird; nor could I make out where he was singing. I could hear his voice clearly, but that was all. The ceaseless attack and vigour of his song made me feel that this vast limitless body of air was dashing backwards and forwards in a frantic effort to escape the unbearable irritation of a thousand flea-bites. That bird really did not stop even for an instant. It seemed that he would not be satisfied, unless he could sing his heart out incessantly day and night, throughout that idyllic springtime; not only sing, but go on climbing up and up for ever. There was no doubt, but that that was where the lark would die, up there among the clouds. Perhaps at the peak of his long climb, he would glide in among the drifting clouds, and there be lost for ever, with only his voice remaining, shrouded by the air."

ところがこの女の表情を見ると、余はいずれとも判断に迷った。口は一文字を結んで静である。眼は五分のすきさえ見出すべく動いている。顔は下膨の瓜実形で、豊かに落ちつきを見せているに引き易えて、額は狭苦しくも、こせついて、いわゆる富士額の俗臭を帯びている。のみならず眉は両方から逼って、中間に数滴の薄荷を点じたるごとく、ぴくぴく焦慮ている。鼻ばかりは軽薄に鋭どくもない、遅鈍に丸くもない。画にしたら美しかろう。かように別れ別れの道具が皆一癖あって、乱調にどやどやと余の双眼に飛び込んだのだから迷うのも無理はない。,"However, when I saw this woman's facial expression, I was at a loss. The mouth is quiet with one letter tied. The eyes are moving to find even a five-fifth plow. The face is a melon-like shape with a bulge, and it is easy to draw with a rich calmness, and although the forehead is cramped, it is cramped and has a so-called Fuji forehead scent. Not only that, the eyebrows are squeezed from both sides, and they are anxious, like a few drops of mint in the middle. The nose is neither frivolous nor sharp, nor slow and round. It would be beautiful if it was made into a picture. It's no wonder that all the farewell tools had a habit and jumped into my binoculars in a turbulent manner.","But when I look at the expression of the woman before me, I am at a loss to decide to which category it belongs. The mouth is still, a single line. The eyes, on the other hand, dart constantly about, as if intent on missing nothing. The face is the classic beauty’s pale oval, a little plump at the chin, replete with a calm serenity, yet the cramped and narrow forehead has a somehow vulgar “Mount Fuji” widow’s-peak hairline. The eyebrows tend inward, moreover, and the brow twitches with nervous irritability; but the nose has neither the sharpness of a frivolous nature nor the roundness of a dull one—it would be beautiful painted. All these various elements come pressing incoherently in upon my eyes, each one with its own idiosyncratic character. Who can wonder that I feel bewildered?","Looking at this woman's features, however, I felt at a loss, and was unable to decide. She stood there quietly, her mouth set in a thin line, and her eyes darting about restlessly, as though anxious not to miss even the smallest detail. In contrast to the fullness and composure of the lower part of her classically oval face, her forehead was narrow and formed a so-called widow's peak in the centre. Her eyebrows, moreover, almost met together, and twitched fretfully as though there were a drop of mint oil drying between them and causing a cold tingling sensation. Her nose was in perfect proportion, being neither too sharp and flippant, nor too round and dull. It would have made a beautiful picture. Considered separately, each one of her features had a distinct characteristic of its own, but all crowding in upon me in mad confusion as they were, it is no wonder that I felt bewildered."

舟はようやく町らしいなかへ這入る。腰障子に御肴と書いた居酒屋が見える。古風な縄暖簾が見える。材木の置場が見える。人力車の音さえ時々聞える。乙鳥がちちと腹を返して飛ぶ。家鴨ががあがあ鳴く。一行は舟を捨てて停車場ステーションに向う。,The boat finally crawls into the town. You can see an izakaya with a side dish written on the back shoji. You can see the old-fashioned rope curtain. You can see the lumber yard.

The party abandons the boat and heads for the stop station.,"At length, the boat enters a townscape. I notice a sign painted on the low paper window of a little bar, “Drinks and Snacks,” and farther on an old-fashioned tavern. We pass a lumberyard. Occasionally the sound of a rickshaw comes from the road beyond. Swallows twist and twitter in the air; geese honk. Now our little party leaves the boat, and we make our way to the station.","The countryside eventually gave way to more urban scenery, and our boat began to pass between houses. At one point a sign on the panel of a shōji announced that inside, savouries were served with the wine, and still farther on, we came to an old-fashioned tavern and a wood yard. Occasionally, we could even hear the sound of rickshaws. Above, swallows wheeled and twisted slowly in flight, and on the water ducks quacked.

こんな考をもつ余を、誤解してはならん。社会の公民として不適当だなどと評してはもっとも不届きである。善は行い難い、徳は施こしにくい、節操は守り安からぬ、義のために命を捨てるのは惜しい。これらをあえてするのは何人に取っても苦痛である。その苦痛を冒すためには、苦痛に打ち勝つだけの愉快がどこかに潜んでおらねばならん。画と云うも、詩と云うも、あるは芝居と云うも、この悲酸のうちに籠る快感の別号に過ぎん。この趣きを解し得て、始めて吾人の所作は壮烈にもなる、閑雅にもなる、すべての困苦に打ち勝って、胸中の一点の無上趣味を満足せしめたくなる。肉体の苦しみを度外に置いて、物質上の不便を物とも思わず、勇猛精進の心を駆って、人道のために、鼎鑊に烹らるるを面白く思う。もし人情なる狭き立脚地に立って、芸術の定義を下し得るとすれば、芸術は、われら教育ある士人の胸裏に潜んで、邪を避け正に就き、曲を斥け直にくみし、弱を扶け強を挫かねば、どうしても堪えられぬと云う一念の結晶して、燦として白日を射返すものである。,"Don't misunderstand the fact that you have such an idea. It is the most undeliverable to say that it is inappropriate as a citizen of society. Good is hard to do, virtue is hard to apply, moderation is unsafe, and it is regrettable to give up life for righteousness. It is painful for any person to dare to do these things. In order to suffer the pain, there must be some fun to overcome the pain. A picture, a poem, or a play is just another issue of the pleasure that lies in this sad acid. For the first time, I want to overcome all the hardships that make my work spectacular and quiet, and satisfy one of my hobbies. I think it's interesting to take the pain of the body out of the ordinary, not to think of the physical inconvenience as a thing, to drive the spirit of courageous devotion, and to wok for humanity. If it were possible to define art by standing on a narrow, humane standpoint, art would lie behind the hearts of our educated scholars, avoid evil and take on the right, and repel songs. If you don't squeeze your weaknesses and defeat your strengths, you will never be able to endure it.","Don’t misunderstand me. I maintain that it’s quite unreasonable to judge behavior such as hers simply as unbecoming in a citizen of our society. Yes, to do good, to be virtuous, to preserve chastity, to sacrifice oneself for the sake of duty are no easy matters. All who attempt these things must suffer to achieve them, and if we are to brave such suffering, somewhere must lurk the promise of a pleasure great enough to defeat the pain. Painting, poetry, drama—these are simply different names for the pleasure within this anguish. When we once grasp this truth, we will at last act with courage and grace ; we will overcome all adversity and be in a position to satisfy the supreme aesthetic urges of our heart. One must disregard physical suffering, set material inconvenience at naught, cultivate a dauntless spirit, and be prepared to submit to any torture for the sake of righteousness and humanity. Defined on the narrow basis of human sentiment, Art could be said to be a bright light hidden within the heart of us men of learning, a crystallization of that fierce dedication that cannot but repel evil and cleave to the good, shrink from the warped and align itself with the straight, aid the weak and crush the strong—a crystal that will shoot back the flashing arrows of the daylight world that would pierce it.","It would indeed be discourteous if people, misunderstanding these ideas, were to censure me as unfit to be a member of society. It is hard to follow the ways of virtue and righteousness, and the preservation of integrity is no easy task. Moreover, it requires courage to lay down one's life for honour's sake. Since suffering awaits all those who dare these paths, there must be joy in the conquest of pain if we are to muster the necessary courage to do so. Painting, poetry and drama are but different names for this joy which is couched in misery. Only when we are able to appreciate the existence of such joy can our actions become heroic, our lives purged of impurity, and can we desire to gratify that supreme spark of poetry which lies within our hearts, by overcoming all hardship and privation. Only then are we able to disregard physical pain and material discomfort, and gladly suffer death at the stake in the cause of humanity. If it is possible to define art solely in the narrow terms of human emotion, then it is that uncompromosing determination to forsake evil, and turn to virtue; to fight on the side of truth and justice in the war against iniquity; to help the weak and afflicted, and destroy the mighty, which has crystalized within the hearts of us men of culture, and which reflects the illuminating light of day."
「そうじゃろ。こないなのは支那でも珍らしかろうな、隠居さん」,"""That's right. It's rare even in China that it doesn't come, Mr. Retirement.""","“Yes, I can understand that.

余は画工である。画工であればこそ趣味専門の男として、たとい人情世界に堕在するも、東西両隣りの没風流漢よりも高尚である。社会の一員として優に他を教育すべき地位に立っている。詩なきもの、画なきもの、芸術のたしなみなきものよりは、美くしき所作が出来る。人情世界にあって、美くしき所作は正である、義である、直である。正と義と直を行為の上において示すものは天下の公民の模範である。,"I am a painter. As a man who specializes in hobbies, if he is a painter, he will fall into the world of humanity, but he is noble than the deceased Ryukan on both sides of the east and west. As a member of society, he is in a position to easily educate others. You can do more beautiful works than things without poetry, things without pictures, and things without art. In the world of humanity, beautiful works are positive, righteous, and straightforward. What shows righteousness, righteousness, and directness in the act is an example of the citizens of the world.","I’m a painter and, as such, a man whose professionally cultivated sensibility would automatically put me above my more uncouth neighbors, if I were to descend to dwelling in the common world of human emotions. As a member of society, my superior position allows me to instruct others. Furthermore, the artist is capable of a greater aesthetic behavior than those who have no sense of poetry or painting, no artistic skill. In the realm of human feelings, a beautiful action is one of truth, justice, and righteousness; and to express truth, justice, and righteousness through one’s behavior is to align oneself with the pattern of behavior deemed proper for civic life.","As an artist, my specialization in mood and sentiment raises me above my more prosaic neighbours, even though I am forced to share the same world with them. Furthermore, as a member of society, I occupy a position from which I may easily educate others, for I am more readily able to perform beautiful deeds than those who are strangers to poetry and painting, and have no artistic accomplishment. In our dealings with one another, a beautiful deed is virtue, justice and righteousness; and whoever manifests these in his daily life is a model to his fellow men."
老人は当人に代って、満洲の野に日ならず出征すべきこの青年の運命を余に語げた。この夢のような詩のような春の里に、啼くは鳥、落つるは花、湧くは温泉のみと思い詰めていたのは間違である。現実世界は山を越え、海を越えて、平家の後裔のみ住み古るしたる孤村にまで逼る。朔北の曠野を染むる血潮の何万分の一かは、この青年の動脈から迸る時が来るかも知れない。この青年の腰に吊る長き剣の先から煙りとなって吹くかも知れない。しかしてその青年は、夢みる事よりほかに、何らの価値を、人生に認め得ざる一画工の隣りに坐っている。耳をそばだつれば彼が胸に打つ心臓の鼓動さえ聞き得るほど近くに坐っている。その鼓動のうちには、百里の平野を捲く高き潮が今すでに響いているかも知れぬ。運命は卒然としてこの二人を一堂のうちに会したるのみにて、その他には何事をも語らぬ。,"The old man, on his behalf, talked too much about the fate of this young man who should go to the fields of Manchuria day after day. It is a mistake to think that in this dreamlike poetic spring village, only birds are screaming, flowers are falling, and hot springs are springing. In the real world, it crosses mountains, crosses the sea, and reaches an old isolated village where only the descendants of the Heike live. Tens of thousands of the blood that stains Sakuhoku's Sakuno may come from the arteries of this young man. It may blow from the tip of a long sword hanging on the waist of this young man as smoke. However, the young man sits next to a painter who cannot recognize any value in his life other than dreaming. He sits close enough to hear the heartbeat that hits his chest as long as he listens. In that heartbeat, the high tide that winds up the plains of Hyakuri may already be echoing. The fate is to meet these two people in one place, and nothing else is said.","And so from him I learn the fate of this young man, who is destined to leave for the Manchurian front in a matter of days. I’ve been mistaken to assume that in this little village in the spring, so like a dream or a poem, life is a matter only of the singing birds, the falling blossoms, and the bubbling springs. The real world has crossed mountains and seas and is bearing down even on this isolated village, whose inhabitants have doubtless lived here in peace down the long stretch of years ever since they fled as defeated warriors from the great clan wars of the twelfth century. Perhaps a millionth part of the blood that will dye the wide Manchurian plains will gush from this young man’s arteries, or seethe forth at the point of the long sword that hangs at his waist. Yet here this young man sits, beside an artist for whom the sole value of human life lies in dreaming. If I listen carefully, I can even hear the beating of his heart, so close are we. And perhaps even now, within that beat reverberates the beating of the great tide that is sweeping across the hundreds of miles of that far battlefield. Fate has for a brief and unexpected moment brought us together in this room, but beyond that it speaks no more.","The old man went on to explain to me that his nephew would have to leave very soon for the Manchurian plains. Since my arrival I had been under the impression that this was an idyllic dream-like mountain village where birds sang, petals fell to the earth and hot water gushed forth in streams, but where nothing else ever happened. How wrong I had been, for Reality had crossed the seas and mountains to this isolated old village to call again to battle the descendants of that once mighty clan, the Taira, the warriors of Mediaeval days. The time might now come when this young man's blood would trickle from his veins to be lost in a greater crimson tide that would stain the bleak and barren plains of Manchuria. Or possibly the time might come when from the point of the long sword he had buckled on, he himself would send another rivulet to join the tide, and another soul wafting upwards like a wisp of smoke. Yet here he sat now, next to a painter for whom dreaming was the only thing of value that life had to offer. He sat so close that had that painter listened carefully he could have even heard the beat of the young man's heart— a beat in which perhaps already were echoes of a rising tide rolling across a plain hundreds of miles away. Fate had brought these two together under the same roof, and then had left without a word. Footnotes"

太玄の閽おのずから開けて、この華やかなる姿を、幽冥の府に吸い込まんとするとき、余はこう感じた。金屛を背に、銀燭を前に、春の宵の一刻を千金と、さざめき暮らしてこそしかるべきこの装の、厭う景色もなく、争う様子も見えず、色相世界から薄れて行くのは、ある点において超自然の情景である。刻々と逼る黒き影を、すかして見ると女は粛然として、焦きもせず、狼狽もせず、同じほどの歩調をもって、同じ所を徘徊しているらしい。身に落ちかかる災を知らぬとすれば無邪気の極である。知って、災と思わぬならば物凄い。黒い所が本来の住居で、しばらくの幻影を、元のままなる冥漠の裏に収めればこそ、かように間靚の態度で、有と無の間に逍遥しているのだろう。女のつけた振袖に、紛たる模様の尽きて、是非もなき磨墨に流れ込むあたりに、おのが身の素性をほのめかしている。,"When I opened it from Taigen's self and tried to suck this gorgeous figure into the shadowy office, I felt like this. With a golden dragon in the back, in front of a silver candle, a moment of spring evening is a thousand dollars, and this outfit that is appropriate for living in a rustling manner In terms of points, it is a supernatural scene. Looking at the ever-growing black shadows, the woman seems to be wandering in the same place with the same pace, without being irritated or upset. It is an innocent pole if you do not know the disaster that falls on you. If you know it and don't think it's a disaster, it's amazing. The black place is the original dwelling, and if the illusion for a while is put behind the original vagueness, it will be a wandering attitude between Yuutomu and Yuutomu. The furisode worn by the woman is exhausted with confusing patterns, and as she flows into the inexhaustible ink, she hints at her true identity.","At last the heavens are on the verge of opening to swallow this bright shape into the realm of darkness. There is something supernatural about the scene, the figure dressed in clothing appropriate to a vibrant life surrounded by golden screens and silver candelabras, “each instant of spring’s evening worth a wealth of gold,” willingly fading without fear or resistance from the visible world. As I gaze at her through the swiftly gathering darkness, she seems to linger serenely in one place, then tread with the one measured step, without haste, without bewilderment. If she indeed has no knowledge of the impending peril of the darkness, she is the height of innocence. If she knows but does not feel it as a danger, she is uncanny. Loitering thus, so serene and poised, between the realms of being and nonbeing, her original dwelling must surely be that blackness, and this temporary phantom is now in the act of returning into the obscure darkness of its true home. The real nature of this figure is suggested by her kimono, whose bewildering pattern inexorably melts and disappears into inky black.","As I watched the gates of night swing wide open to swallow this bright and elegant figure into the lonely darkness, I felt that there was a touch of the supernatural about the way in which this woman, who, dressed as she was, should have been the centre of attraction in a setting the visible world without any apparent regret, and with no signs of trying to draw back. Peering into the rapidly approaching gloom, I could see that she was still calmly walking up and down the same stretch of verandah at the same unhurried, even pace. She would, I thought, have had to be extremely naive not to be aware of the evil that was overtaking her. But it was uncanny if she was aware of it and yet did not consider it an evil. If this were the case, it meant that black was her natural home, and the reason why she could stroll about so nonchalantly between existence and non-existence was that this phantom shape which she had temporarily assumed was now returning to the obscurity from whence it had come. The way in which the pattern adorning her gown merged with the unavoidable black surround seemed to point to her origin."

何だか考が理に落ちていっこうつまらなくなった。こんな中学程度の観想を練りにわざわざ、鏡が池まで来はせぬ。袂から煙草を出して、寸燐マッチをシュッと擦る。手応はあったが火は見えない。敷島のさきに付けて吸ってみると、鼻から煙が出た。なるほど、吸ったんだなとようやく気がついた。寸燐マッチは短かい草のなかで、しばらく雨竜のような細い煙りを吐いて、すぐ寂滅した。席をずらせてだんだん水際まで出て見る。余が茵は天然に池のなかに、ながれ込んで、足を浸せば生温い水につくかも知れぬと云う間際で、とまる。水を覗いて見る。,"Somehow my thoughts made sense and it became boring. The mirror doesn't come to the pond because of the idea of junior high school. Put out a cigarette from the skirt and rub the sword match. There was a response, but I couldn't see the fire. When I attached it to Shikishima and smoked it, smoke came out of my nose. I finally realized that I smoked. In the short grass, Cun Rin Match spewed a thin smoke like a rain dragon for a while and soon became lonely. Move your seat and gradually go out to the water's edge. I stop at the point where Aoi naturally flows into the pond and may get into warm water if you soak your feet. Look into the water.",". . . But my thoughts have degenerated into mere tiresome quibbles. I haven’t come to Mirror Pool to engage in these schoolboy ramblings! I take a cigarette from the packet of Shikishima tucked in my sleeve and strike a match. Though my hand registers the rasp, no flame is visible. I apply it to the tip of the cigarette and draw, and only now, as smoke issues from my nose, can I be certain I am smoking a lit cigarette. In the short grass the discarded match sends up a little dragon curl of smoke, then expires. I now shift my seat slowly down to the shore. My grassy cushion slopes smoothly right on into the pool; I pause just at the edge, where any farther advance must bring the tepid water over my feet, and peer in. The pool seems quite shallow for as far out as my gaze can reach.","I felt somehow that my thoughts had become too serious. After all, I had not come down to the Kagami pond merely to make adolescent observations on life. I took out a cigarette from the packet of Shikishima in my sleeve, and struck a match. I felt the match-head rasp against the box, but I could see no flame. Nevertheless I held the match to the end of my cigarette and inhaled. It was not until finally saw the smoke coming out of my nostrils, however, that I became aware that the cigarette really was alight. A tiny wisp of smoke rising from the matchstick in the short grass, formed a long-tailed dragon which went rapidly to join its ancestors in eternity. I slithered slowly down to the water's edge. The grassy bank which had served me as a cushion ran right on into the natural pond, but I managed to stop just in time to save my feet from a tepid soaking. Having come to a halt, I squatted there staring into the water."

取り上げて、障子の方へ向けて見る。障子には植木鉢の葉蘭の影が暖かそうに写っている。首を曲げて、覗き込むと、杢の字が小さく見える。銘は観賞の上において、さのみ大切のものとは思わないが、好事者はよほどこれが気にかかるそうだ。茶碗を下へ置かないで、そのまま口へつけた。濃く甘く、湯加減に出た、重い露を、舌の先へ一しずくずつ落して味って見るのは閑人適意の韻事である。普通の人は茶を飲むものと心得ているが、あれは間違だ。舌頭へぽたりと載せて、清いものが四方へ散れば咽喉へ下るべき液はほとんどない。ただ馥郁たる匂が食道から胃のなかへ沁み渡るのみである。歯を用いるは卑しい。水はあまりに軽い。玉露に至っては濃かなる事、淡水の境を脱して、顎を疲らすほどの硬さを知らず。結構な飲料である。眠られぬと訴うるものあらば、眠らぬも、茶を用いよと勧めたい。,"Take it up and look towards the shoji. The shadow of the leaf orchid in the flowerpot looks warm on the shoji. When you bend your neck and look into it, the figure of heather looks small. I don't think the inscription is so important in terms of viewing, but it seems that enthusiasts are very concerned about it. Instead of putting the bowl down, I just put it in my mouth. It is a melody that is suitable for a quiet person to taste the thick, sweet, heavy dew that has come out of the hot water by dropping it on the tip of the tongue one by one. The average person knows that he drinks tea, but that is a mistake. If you put it on the tip of your tongue and the clean things are scattered in all directions, there is almost no liquid to go down to your throat. The scent of sardines only spills from the esophagus into the stomach. Using teeth is lowly. The water is too light. Gyokuro is thick, and I don't know how hard it is to exhaust my chin, leaving the border of fresh water. It's a good drink. If you can't sleep, I recommend you to use tea.","I lift it up and turn it toward the paper-screened window to see. The warm shadow of a potted aspidistra falls across the screen. Sure enough, when I twist my head to look closely at the base, I see the single small character “Moku.” A signature is not really important in appreciating a work of art, but dilettantes apparently set great store by it. I bring the raised cup directly to my lips. A connoisseur with time on his hands will elegantly taste this rich, delicately sweet liquid, ripened in the precise temperature of the hot water, by letting it run one drop at a time onto the tip of the tongue. Most people believe that tea is to be drunk, but that is a mistake. If you drop it gently onto the tongue and let the pure liquid dissipate in your mouth, almost none of it remains for you to swallow. Rather, the exquisite fragrance travels down to permeate the regions of the stomach. Using the teeth on solid food is vulgar, while mere water is insipid. The best green tea, on the other hand, surpasses fresh water in its delicate, rich warmth, yet lacks the firmness of more solid substances that tire the jaw. Tea is, in fact, a marvelous drink. To those who spurn it on the grounds of insomnia, I say that it’s better to be deprived of sleep than of tea.","I picked it up, and in order to see better turned towards the shōji on which were thrown the warm elliptical shadows of the leaves of a 'haran' plant standing in a pot outside. Bending my head forward I peeped inside the cup, and there sure enough was the name 'Mokubei' in small letters. I do not think the name is particularity important as far as the appreciation of an object is concerned, and yet apparently it is something which collectors set great store by. Instead of putting the cup back down on the table, I raised it to my lips. For the man of leisure there is no more refined nor delightful pursuit than savouring this thick delicious nectar drop by drop on the tip of the tongue. The average person talks of 'drinking' tea, but this is a mistake. Once you have felt a little of the pure liquid spread slowly over your tongue, there is scarcely any need to swallow it. It is merely a question of letting the fragrance penetrate from your throat right down to your stomach. On no account should it be swilled round the mouth and over the teeth, for this is extremely coarse. ' Gyokuro' tea escapes the insipidness of pure water and yet is not so thick as to require any tiring jaw action. It is a wonderful beverage. Some complain that if they drink tea they cannot sleep, but to them I would say that it is better to go without sleep than without tea."

小供の時分、門前に万屋と云う酒屋があって、そこに御倉さんと云う娘がいた。この御倉さんが、静かな春の昼過ぎになると、必ず長唄の御浚いをする。御浚が始まると、余は庭へ出る。茶畠の十坪余りを前に控えて、三本の松が、客間の東側に並んでいる。この松は周り一尺もある大きな樹で、面白い事に、三本寄って、始めて趣のある恰好を形つくっていた。小供心にこの松を見ると好い心持になる。松の下に黒くさびた鉄灯籠が名の知れぬ赤石の上に、いつ見ても、わからず屋の頑固爺のようにかたく坐っている。余はこの灯籠を見詰めるのが大好きであった。灯籠の前後には、苔深き地を抽いて、名も知らぬ春の草が、浮世の風を知らぬ顔に、独り匂うて独り楽しんでいる。余はこの草のなかに、わずかに膝を容るるの席を見出して、じっと、しゃがむのがこの時分の癖であった。この三本の松の下に、この灯籠を睨めて、この草の香を臭いで、そうして御倉さんの長唄を遠くから聞くのが、当時の日課であった。,"At the time of Kosuke, there was a liquor store called Manya in front of the gate, and there was a daughter named Mikura-san. This Mr. Mikura always plays Nagauta in the quiet spring afternoon. When the grace begins, I go out to the garden. Three pine trees are lined up on the east side of the guest room, ahead of the tea plantation of about 10 tsubo. This pine tree is a large tree with a shaku around it, and interestingly, it was the first time that three pine trees had formed a quaint appearance. Looking at this pine with a small heart makes me feel good. A black rusty iron lantern under the pine sits on the unknown red stone, always like a stubborn grandfather of an unknown shop. I loved staring at this lantern. Before and after the lanterns, the moss-deep ground is drawn, and the unknown spring grass smells alone on the face that does not know the wind of the Ukiyo, and enjoys it alone. It was a habit of this time that I found a seat in this grass that could hold my knees slightly and crouched still. It was a daily routine at that time to stare at this lantern under these three pine trees, smell the scent of this grass, and listen to Mr. Mikura's Nagauta from a distance.","When I was a child, a sake shop by the name of Yorozuya stood outside our front gate. On quiet spring afternoons the daughter of the establishment, a girl called Okura, would always take up her shamisen and practice the old nagauta songs she was studying. Whenever Okura began to play, I would slip out into the garden to hear her. We owned a plot for growing tea, around forty square yards, in front of which, to the east of the guest room, stood a row of three pine trees. They were tall trees, about a foot in girth, and the interesting thing was that they were visually pleasing only as a group, not individually. The sight of them always made me happy as a child. Beneath the pines crouched a garden lantern of rusted black iron on a slab of some kind of red rock, grim and immovable, like an obstinate little old man. I used to love to gaze at it. Around this lantern the nameless grasses that had pushed up through the mossy earth tossed fancy-free in the world’s fickle winds, casting their scent and taking their pleasure in their own sweet way. I discovered a place to squat among these grasses, a space just big enough for my knees to fit, and my habit at this time of year was to go and sit there, absolutely still. Each day I settled down beneath those pines, glaring back at the grim little lantern and sniffing the scent of the grasses, as I listened to Okura’s distant shamisen.","When I was a boy there was a wine shop called Yoro-zuya just beyond the gate of our house, and on quiet spring afternoons the proprietor's young daughter, O-Kura, would always practise singing and playing long epic ballads. As soon as she began, I would go into the garden to listen to her. Just in front of our tea-garden, which was a little over forty square yards in size, three pine trees stood in a row along the eastern side of the guest rooms. They were tall trees with trunks about a foot in circumference, but the interesting thing was that they only looked elegant when viewed as a group. As a child, I remember, it gave me a great deal of pleasure to look at these trees. Beneath the three pines, there was a slab of some kind of reddish rock on which stood a metal lantern blackened and rusted with age. It was always there like some cantankerous and obstinate old man who refused to budge, and I used to love to sit and gaze at it. Around the lantern wild spring flowers and tall grasses whose names I did not know pushed through the thickly moss-covered ground. They appeared to pay no attention to the changing world about them, nor to fear the wind that might destroy them. Alone they gave off their fragrance, and alone they were happy. I used to seek out a small space where I could kneel among the flowers without crushing them, and there I would crouch quietly. To gaze at the lantern beneath the pine trees, to smell the perfume of the flowers and to listen to the sound of O-Kura playing and singing ballads in the distance became my daily routine."
と云う二句さえ、付け加えたかも知れぬ。幸い、普通ありふれた、恋とか愛とか云う境界はすでに通り越して、そんな苦しみは感じたくても感じられない。しかし今の刹那に起った出来事の詩趣はゆたかにこの五六行にあらわれている。余と銀杏返しの間柄にこんな切ない思はないとしても、二人の今の関係を、この詩の中に適用て見るのは面白い。あるいはこの詩の意味をわれらの身の上に引きつけて解釈しても愉快だ。二人の間には、ある因果の細い糸で、この詩にあらわれた境遇の一部分が、事実となって、括りつけられている。因果もこのくらい糸が細いと苦にはならぬ。その上、ただの糸ではない。空を横切る虹の糸、野辺に棚引く霞の糸、露にかがやく蜘蛛の糸。切ろうとすれば、すぐ切れて、見ているうちは勝れてうつくしい。万一この糸が見る間に太くなって井戸縄のようにかたくなったら？そんな危険はない。余は画工である。先はただの女とは違う。,"I may have added even the two phrases. Fortunately, the usual boundaries of love and love have already passed, and even if you want to feel that kind of suffering, you can't. However, the poetic taste of the events that happened in the present moment appears in these 56 lines. Even if there is no such sad feeling in the relationship between I and Ginkgo, it is interesting to apply the current relationship between the two in this poem. Or it would be fun to draw the meaning of this poem to ourselves and interpret it. A part of the circumstances that appeared in this poem is actually tied up between them with a thin thread of causality. The cause and effect is not painful if the thread is so thin. Besides, it's not just a thread. A rainbow thread that crosses the sky, a haze thread that is shelved in the field, and a spider thread that shines in the dew. If you try to cut it, it will cut immediately, and you can win and be beautiful while you are watching. What if this thread gets thicker and harder like a well rope while you look at it? There is no such danger. I am a painter. The destination is different from just a woman.","With bliss I would yield my breath. Happily, I am by now well past any susceptibility to the triteness of love and heartache, and I couldn’t become afflicted with such agonies even should I wish it. Yet these few lines are richly redolent with the poetry of the event that has just occurred. Though in fact no such painful longing binds me to the figure opposite, I find it amusing to project our relationship into the scene of this poem, and to apply the poem’s sentiments to our present situation. A thin karmic thread winds between us, linking us through something the poem holds that is true to this moment. But a karmic bond that consists of such a very tenuous thread is scarcely, after all, a burdensome matter. Nor is it any ordinary thread—it is like some rainbow arching in the sky, a mist that trails over the plain, a spider’s web glittering in the dew, a fragile thing that, though marvelously beautiful to the eye, must snap at the first touch. What if this thread were to swell before my eyes into the sturdy thickness of a rope? I wonder. But there’s no danger of this. I am an artist. And she is far from the common run of woman.","Fortunately I had already left the triteness of falling in love far behind me, and could not have felt such pangs even if I had wanted to. Nevertheless, I thought that those few lines captured the poetry of the situation admirably. It was both amusing and pleasant to think of the poem as applying to 'the butterfly' and myself, and to pretend that it described our relationship, even though I knew that such a state of affairs was impossible. We were, it is true, joined together by a thin thread, because fate had decreed that I should see her in circumstances similar to those in which the poem had been written, thus making it partly real. Fate or no fate, however, so slender a tie could not prove painful. Moreover, this was no ordinary thread. It was as delicate as the rainbow spanning the sky, and as flimsy as mist trailing across the moors, or gossamer sparkling with dew; and as such it was exceedingly beautiful to look at,but could be broken at will. Ah, but supposing that while I were looking at it, it should become as thick and strong as a hawser, what then? No, there is no fear of that happening. I am an artist, and she is not like the normal run of women."

なるほど見れば見るほどいい色だ。寒く潤沢を帯びたる肌の上に、はっと、一息懸けたなら、直ちに凝って、一朶の雲を起すだろうと思われる。ことに驚くべきは眼の色である。眼の色と云わんより、眼と地の相交わる所が、次第に色を取り替えて、いつ取り替えたか、ほとんど吾眼の欺かれたるを見出し得ぬ事である。形容して見ると紫色の蒸羊羹の奥に、隠元豆を、透いて見えるほどの深さに嵌め込んだようなものである。眼と云えば一個二個でも大変に珍重される。九個と云ったら、ほとんど類はあるまい。しかもその九個が整然と同距離に按排されて、あたかも人造のねりものと見違えらるるに至ってはもとより天下の逸品をもって許さざるを得ない。,"The more you look at it, the better the color. It seems that if you take a break on your cold and abundant skin, you will immediately stiffen and create a cloud of clouds. Especially amazing is the color of the eyes. Rather than the color of the eye, the intersection of the eye and the ground gradually changes the color, and when it is replaced, it is almost impossible to find out that the eye is deceived. If you look at it in a nutshell, it's like putting a hidden bean in the back of a purple steamed yokan to a depth that you can see through. Speaking of eyes, even one or two is very prized. If you say nine, there is almost no kind. Moreover, the nine pieces are neatly disposed of at the same distance, and it is necessary to forgive them with the gems of the world as well as the fact that they are mistaken for artificial shavings.","Indeed, the color’s beauty increases the more you gaze. If you breathed on that cold, lustrous surface, your warm breath might instantly freeze there, leaving a puff of cloudiness. The most astonishing thing is the color of the shrike spots. They are not so much spots as subtle shifts in color where the spot emerges from the surrounding stone, a transition so gradual that the eye finds it almost impossible to locate the point at which the deceptive moment of change occurs. Metaphorically, it’s like gazing into a translucent plum-colored bean cake, at a bean that lies embedded deep within. These shrike spots are so precious that the presence even of one or two is highly prized. There would be almost no examples of a stone with nine. What’s more, the nine are distributed equidistantly over the surface, so apparently systematically that the effect could well be mistaken for a human artifact—a masterpiece of nature indeed.","He was quite right. The more one looked, the more attractive the colours became. I could imagine breathing on the cold surface, and watching the breath absorbed and turned into a mist which would permeate the richness of the colour beneath. The most remarkable thing was the colour of the 'eyes', or rather the almost imperceptible way in which their colour gradually merged and blended with the surround, throwing one's vision out of focus. When I readjusted my gaze, the 'eyes' looked as though they were right down in the transparent depths, like black beans set in a mauve-coloured jelly. An ink-stone which has even one or two of these 'bird's-eyes' is rare, and there are scarcely any at all which have nine. Should all these markings be spread equidistantly, then to think that the stone has been artificially made, is to commit a gross and unpardonable slander against one of Nature's greatest rarities."

不思議に思ったのは、宿へ着いた時の取次も、晩食の給仕も、湯壺への案内も、床を敷く面倒も、ことごとくこの小女一人で弁じている。それで口は滅多にきかぬ。と云うて、田舎染みてもおらぬ。赤い帯を色気なく結んで、古風な紙燭をつけて、廊下のような、梯子段のような所をぐるぐる廻わらされた時、同じ帯の同じ紙燭で、同じ廊下とも階段ともつかぬ所を、何度も降りて、湯壺へ連れて行かれた時は、すでに自分ながら、カンヴァスの中を往来しているような気がした。,"What made me wonder is that this little girl alone speaks about the agency when she arrives at the inn, the waiter for dinner, the guidance to the hot water jar, and the trouble of laying the floor. That's why I rarely speak. That said, it doesn't stain the countryside. When the red belt is tied casually, an old-fashioned paper candle is attached, and it is circulated around a place like a corridor, a place like a ladder step, the same paper candle of the same belt, neither the same corridor nor the stairs When I got off many times and was taken to the hot water jar, I felt like I was already going back and forth in the canvas.","The strange thing is that it is this same maid who has done everything since I arrived—answering the door to me, serving the evening meal, showing me to the bathhouse, and now laying out my bed. What’s more, she has scarcely spoken a word, though she doesn’t seem particularly countrified in her ways. Earlier I followed behind this girl as she wound along the endless passageway-cum-staircase to my room, a chastely knotted red obi around her waist and an old-fashioned oil taper in her hand, and then I followed the same obi and oil taper down the same passageway-cum-staircase, on and on, as she led me to the bathhouse, feeling almost as if I was a figure coming and going in a painting.","What struck me as rather odd was that the girl who had ushered me in when I had arrived, the girl who had served supper and shown me the way to the bathroom, and the girl who was now taking the trouble to make my bed for me, were all one and the same. She had, moreover, scarcely said a word the whole time. I do not mean to imply by this, however, that she was just a solid country lass. She had tied the red obi1 which was around her waist with a simplicity which suggested a young girl's indifference as to whether or not it enhanced her charms. Carrying an old-fashioned taper in her hand, she had led me to the bathhouse now this way now that, around bend after bend along what appeared to be passageways, and down flights of stairs. In front of me all the time were that same red obi and that same taper, and it seemed as though we were going along the same passage and down the same staircase again and again. Already I had the feeling of being a painted figure moving about on a canvas."

三畳へ着物を脱いで、段々を、四つ下りると、八畳ほどな風呂場へ出る。石に不自由せぬ国と見えて、下は御影で敷き詰めた、真中を四尺ばかりの深さに掘り抜いて、豆腐屋ほどな湯槽を据える。槽とは云うもののやはり石で畳んである。鉱泉と名のつく以上は、色々な成分を含んでいるのだろうが、色が純透明だから、入り心地がよい。折々は口にさえふくんで見るが別段の味も臭もない。病気にも利くそうだが、聞いて見ぬから、どんな病に利くのか知らぬ。もとより別段の持病もないから、実用上の価値はかつて頭のなかに浮んだ事がない。ただ這入る度に考え出すのは、白楽天の温泉水滑洗凝脂と云う句だけである。温泉と云う名を聞けば必ずこの句にあらわれたような愉快な気持になる。またこの気持を出し得ぬ温泉は、温泉として全く価値がないと思ってる。この理想以外に温泉についての注文はまるでない。,"Take off your kimono to 3 tatami mats, go down 4 steps, and you will reach a bathroom about 8 tatami mats. It looks like a country that is not inconvenient for stones, and the bottom is covered with a shadow, and the center is dug to a depth of about 4 shaku, and a bathtub similar to a tofu shop is set up. Although it is called a tank, it is still folded with stones. As long as it is named as a mineral spring, it may contain various ingredients, but the color is purely transparent, so it is comfortable to enter. Occasionally I see it in my mouth, but it has no particular taste or odor. It seems to be good for illness, but I don't know what kind of illness it is because I haven't heard it. Of course, I don't have any particular illness, so the practical value has never come to my mind. However, every time I crawl in, I come up with only the phrase Bai Juyi's hot spring water-sliding coagulant. Whenever you hear the name ""onsen"", you will feel as if you were in this phrase. Also, I don't think this hot spring that doesn't feel like it has any value as a hot spring. There are no orders for hot springs other than this ideal.","After disrobing in the little changing room, I descend the four steps that bring me into the large bathroom. There seems to be no dearth of local stone. The bathroom floor is paved with granite; in the middle a bathtub the size of a substantial tofu seller’s vat has been sunk about four feet into the ground, and unlike a normal tub, it too is lined with stone. The place has a name as a hot spring, so presumably the water contains a variety of mineral elements, but it is perfectly clear and thus a pleasure to step into. Lying here in the tub, I even take an occasional experimental sip, but it has no particular taste or odor. The water is reputed to have medicinal qualities, but as I haven’t bothered to ask, I have no idea what ailments it cures. I suffer from no particular illness, so it hasn’t occurred to me to wonder what the water’s practical value might be. The only thing that comes into my head as I lower myself into the tub are the lines from Po Chu-i’s poem, “Softly the warm spring waters / bathed the white beauty’s skin.” Whenever I hear the words “hot spring,” I taste again the deep pleasure that these lines evoke, and indeed it seems to me that no hot spring is of the least value unless it can produce in me precisely the sensation summed up in these lines. My sole requirement for a hot spring, you might say, is that it fulfill this ideal.","I undressed in a small matted room, and then went down the four steps into the bathroom which was about twelve feet square. There appeared to be no shortage of stones in these parts, for both the floor, and the lining of the sunken bath tank in the centre were of pebbles set in cement. The tank was about the size of the vats they used to make bean-curd, being roughly four feet deep. This place was called a mineral spring, so there were presumably many mineral ingredients in the water. As, in spite of this, it was clear and transparent, I found it very pleasant to bathe in. From time to time some of the water found its way into my mouth, but it had no distinctive taste or odour. This spring was said to have medical properties, but I never took the trouble to find out what ailments it was supposed to cure. Since I myself was not suffering from any illness, the idea that the spring might have any practical value did not enter my head. As I stepped into the tank all I was thinking of was a poem by the Chinese poet Pai Le-tien that expresses the feeling of pleasure which the mere mention of the words 'hot spring' rouses in me.

彼は髪剃を揮うに当って、毫も文明の法則を解しておらん。頰にあたる時はがりりと音がした。揉み上の所ではぞきりと動脈が鳴った。顋のあたりに利刃がひらめく時分にはごりごり、ごりごりと霜柱を踏みつけるような怪しい声が出た。しかも本人は日本一の手腕を有する親方をもって自任している。,"He doesn't understand the law of civilization when he shave his hair.

Moreover, he is self-employed with a master who has the best skill in Japan.","During the time he is wielding the razor, this man becomes not barber but barbarian, quite beyond the accepted rules of civilization. Even while the razor is merely going over my cheeks, it rasps and grates; when it sets to work by my ear, the artery in my temple leaps in panic; and as the fearsome blade flashes at my chin, it produces an extraordinary crunching sound, like ice being crushed underfoot. And this is a barber who fancies himself the most consummate in the land!","The way in which he set about wielding the razor made it quite clear that he knew nothing at all of the laws of civilization. The razor scraped across my cheek, and as it worked up towards my ear, the artery in my temple started throbbing so wildly that I thought it would burst.

The terrible thing was that he considered himself the finest barber in the country."

「ほんに」と和尚さんは後ろを振り向く。床は平床を鏡のようにふき込んで、鏽気を吹いた古銅瓶には、木蘭を二尺の高さに、活けてある。軸は底光りのある古錦襴に、装幀の工夫を籠めた物徂徠の大幅である。絹地ではないが、多少の時代がついているから、字の巧拙に論なく、紙の色が周囲のきれ地とよく調和して見える。あの錦襴も織りたては、あれほどのゆかしさも無かったろうに、彩色が褪せて、金糸が沈んで、華麗なところが滅り込んで、渋いところがせり出して、あんないい調子になったのだと思う。焦茶の砂壁に、白い象牙の軸が際立って、両方に突張っている、手前に例の木蘭がふわりと浮き出されているほかは、床全体の趣は落ちつき過ぎてむしろ陰気である。,"""Really,"" Osho turned around. The floor is a flat floor that is wiped like a mirror, and the old bronze bottle that has been blown with rust is filled with wood orchids at a height of two shaku. The axis is a large troupe with a brilliant old brocade and a design of the binding. It's not silk, but it's a little old, so the color of the paper looks good in harmony with the surrounding shavings, regardless of the skill of the characters. The brocade wouldn't have been so mellow, but the coloring had faded, the gold thread had sunk, the splendid parts had disappeared, and the astringent parts had squeezed out. I think. The white ivory shaft stands out on the dark brown sand wall, and the tree orchid in the foreground is fluffy in the foreground, and the whole floor is too calm and rather gloomy.","“That so?” The abbot turns to look over his shoulder. The alcove is a simple recess in the wall. On its polished board stands an old Chinese copperware vase, its surface elegantly tarnished, with a two-foot-high branch of magnolia blossom arranged in it. The scroll hanging behind it is a large work by Sorai,6 on a backing of subtly glowing figured silk. The calligraphy is on paper rather than the more usual silk, but the scroll’s beauty lies not only in the indisputable skill of the writing itself but also in the delightful harmony between the backing and the paper, which has aged with the passage of time. The figured silk itself is not particularly wonderful, but it seems to me to achieve its fine quality through a combination of faded color and a softening of the effect of the gold thread, so that any original gaudiness has dimmed, allowing a certain austerity to assert itself. The two little ivory scroll ends protrude starkly white against the tea-brown background of the earth wall, while before the scroll softly floats the pale magnolia blossoms, yet the overall effect of the alcove is so calm as to be almost gloomy.","'Oh, have you?' said the abbot, turning round to look at the alcove behind him where the scroll usually hung. In the alcove was a low wooden dais which had been polished until it shone like a mirror. On this stood an old tarnished copper vase in which magnolia sprays about two feet high had been arranged. The present scroll was by the Chinese calligrapher Wu Tsu-lai, and around the edges was the dark lustre of gold brocade with which it had been carefully bound. The scroll itself was not of silk but paper. The passage of time, however, had matched the colour of the paper with that of the cloth on which it was mounted, giving to the whole a harmony which was independent of the writing it contained. I felt sure that the gold brocade too had not possessed its present dignity when it had first been .woven, for now the colours had faded, and the gold thread frayed. The more gorgeous parts had become obliterated, making the sober portions more prominent. The ivory rod from which the scroll was suspended could be seen protruding from both sides, its whiteness standing out in sharp relief against the dark red of the wall."
「ワハハハハ。そうよ、この蓋はあまり安っぽいようだな」と和尚はたちまち余に賛成した。,"""Wahahahaha.

I hear bush warblers at their song And in my eyes are drifting cherry blossoms. “At the road’s end a vast plain unfolds”— I write this line on an old temple’s door. The lone walker’s solitude fills the sky. A single wild goose wings homeward through the heavens. What subtleties lie within one small heart! Right and wrong—forgotten in this eternal moment. Poised at thirty on the edge of old age Yet now a soft spring light wraps me about. Wandering thus, at one with nature’s changes, I calmly breathe the fragrance all about.3","My head was crammed with thoughts when I left home, With spring's sweet breath playing around my skirts. The rutted path is overgrown with fragrance, And passes neglected into hazed obscurity. Leaning upon my staff, 1 view each detail Of bright Nature in her shining mande. A crystal cascade of nightingale's notes falls on the ear, While air is filled with sweetest floral rain. Beyond a wide and desolate plain I reach An ancient temple, on whose door a poem I inscribe. In uncompanioned loneliness I look towards the clouds Where one wild goose, unskeined, wings homeward 'cross the sky. How deep, how recondite this seeming petty heart, In whose recesses right and wrong lie dimmed by distance. Although yet thirty, my thoughts are those of age, But Spring retains her former glory.

借着の浴衣一枚で、障子へつらまったまま、しばらく茫然としていたが、やがて我に帰ると、山里の春はなかなか寒いものと悟った。ともかくもと抜け出でた布団の穴に、再び帰参して考え出した。括り枕のしたから、袂時計を出して見ると、一時十分過ぎである。再び枕の下へ押し込んで考え出した。よもや化物ではあるまい。化物でなければ人間で、人間とすれば女だ。あるいは此家の御嬢さんかも知れない。しかし出帰りの御嬢さんとしては夜なかに山つづきの庭へ出るのがちと不穏当だ。何にしてもなかなか寝られない。枕の下にある時計までがちくちく口をきく。今まで懐中時計の音の気になった事はないが、今夜に限って、さあ考えろ、さあ考えろと催促するごとく、寝るな寝るなと忠告するごとく口をきく。怪しからん。,"I was stunned for a while with a piece of yukata that I borrowed, but when I returned to myself, I realized that spring in Yamazato was quite cold. Anyway, I came back to the hole in the futon that had come out and came up with it. Since I had a pillow, when I took out the clock, it was more than enough for a while. I pushed it under the pillow again and figured it out. It's not a ghost. If it is not a monster, it is a human being, and if it is a human being, it is a female. Or it may be the young lady of this house. However, it is unreasonable for a young lady to go out to the garden that continues to the mountains in the middle of the night. I can't sleep anyway. Even the clock under the pillow squeaks. I've never been worried about the sound of a pocket watch, but only tonight, I urge you to think, think, and say, ""Don't sleep, don't sleep."" I'm not suspicious.","I stand entranced at the doors awhile longer, clad only in the single layer of the inn’s night robe, until I come to myself again and realize that the spring night in this mountain village is in fact extremely cold. Then I return to the hollow of bedclothes from which I earlier emerged, where I begin to ponder what I have just witnessed. I extract my pocket watch from beneath the pillow. It is ten minutes past one. Pushing it back under the pillow, I think some more. This can’t possibly have been an apparition. If it wasn’t an apparition, it must be a human, and if human, it was a woman. Perhaps it was the daughter of the household. But it’s surely rather unseemly for a woman separated from her husband to come out at night like this into a garden, and one that merges into the wild hill beyond. Well, be that as it may, the fact is I can’t sleep. Even the watch under my pillow intrudes on my thoughts with its ticking. I’ve never been bothered before by the sound of my pocket watch, but tonight it seems to be urging and berating me—Let’s think, let’s think, it instructs. Don’t sleep, don’t sleep. Damn the thing!","I stood there in a daze with my hand still on the shōji, clad only in the yukata1 that had been laid out for me. Presently, however, as I came to myself, it was born in upon me just how cold spring can be in the mountains. ' Well, that's that,' I thought, and climbing back in between the sheets, I fell to thinking. I pulled out my watch from under the pillow and looked at the time. Ten past one. I pushed it back under the pillow again and returned to my thoughts. What I had seen could not possibly have been an apparition. If not an apparition then, it must have been human; and if human it must have been a woman. Perhaps it was Shioda's daughter. If this were so, however, I did not consider it exactly the height of propriety that she, a woman divorced from her husband and now back living with her father, should, in the middle of the night, be out in the garden running as it did straight out on to the mountainside. It was no good, I just could not sleep. I lay there listening to the tick-tick-tick-tick of the watch under my pillow. I had never before been troubled by the ticking of a watch, but that night it sounded as though it were saying, 'Think-think-think-think, think-think-think-think,' and repeating the same piece of advice over and over again: ' Don't-sleep-don't-sleep, don't-sleep-don't-sleep.' Confound it!"

こんな時にどうすれば詩的な立脚地に帰れるかと云えば、おのれの感じ、そのものを、おのが前に据えつけて、その感じから一歩退いて有体に落ちついて、他人らしくこれを検査する余地さえ作ればいいのである。詩人とは自分の屍骸を、自分で解剖して、その病状を天下に発表する義務を有している。その方便は色々あるが一番手近なのは何でも蚊でも手当り次第十七字にまとめて見るのが一番いい。十七字は詩形としてもっとも軽便であるから、顔を洗う時にも、厠に上った時にも、電車に乗った時にも、容易に出来る。十七字が容易に出来ると云う意味は安直に詩人になれると云う意味であって、詩人になると云うのは一種の悟りであるから軽便だと云って侮蔑する必要はない。軽便であればあるほど功徳になるからかえって尊重すべきものと思う。まあちょっと腹が立つと仮定する。腹が立ったところをすぐ十七字にする。十七字にするときは自分の腹立ちがすでに他人に変じている。腹を立ったり、俳句を作ったり、そう一人が同時に働けるものではない。ちょっと涙をこぼす。この涙を十七字にする。するや否やうれしくなる。涙を十七字に纏めた時には、苦しみの涙は自分から遊離して、おれは泣く事の出来る男だと云う嬉しさだけの自分になる。,"The only way to get back to a poetic stand at such times is to set up your feelings in front of you, take a step back from that feeling, settle down, and even have room to inspect this like someone else. You just have to make it. A poet is obliged to dissect his own corpse and announce his condition to the world. There are various ways to do this, but the most convenient one is to see all the mosquitoes in 17 characters at random. The seventeen characters are the easiest poetry form, so you can easily wash your face, climb the toilet, or get on the train. The meaning of being able to easily make seventeen characters means being able to become a poet in a straightforward manner, and being a poet is a kind of enlightenment, so there is no need to despise it as being light. The lighter it is, the more merit it becomes, so I think it should be respected. Well suppose you get a little angry. Immediately turn the angry place into 17 characters. When I make 17 characters, my annoyance has already changed to another person. It's not something that one person can work at the same time, such as getting angry or writing haiku. I spill a little tears. Make these tears 17 characters. As soon as I do, I'm happy. When the tears are put together in 17 characters, the tears of suffering are released from me, and I am just the joy of being a man who can cry.","In order to regain the poetic point of view on this occasion, I have only to set up before myself my own feelings, then take a step back from them and calmly, dispassionately investigate their true nature. The poet has an obligation to dissect his own corpse and reveal the symptoms of its illness to the world. There are various ways to achieve this, but the most successful immediate one is to try jotting everything down in seventeen-syllable haiku form, with whatever words spring to mind. The haiku is the simplest and handiest form of poetry; you can compose one with ease while you’re washing your face, or on the toilet, or on a train. But that’s no reason to disparage the haiku. No one should try to claim that because the haiku is easily achieved, becoming a poet therefore costs one little, and since to be a poet is to be in some sense enlightened, enlightenment must therefore be easily achieved. I believe that the simpler a thing is, the greater is its virtue, and thus the haiku should rather be revered. Let’s imagine something has made you a little angry. Then and there you put your anger into seventeen syllables. No sooner do you do so than your anger is transformed into that of another. You cannot be angry and write a haiku at the same time. Or say you weep a little. Put those tears into seventeen syllables and there you are, you are immediately happy. Making a haiku of your tears frees you from their bitterness; now you are simply happy to be a man who is capable of weeping.","How, I wondered, could you regain a poetical frame of mind at times like this? I came to the conclusion that it could be done, if only you could take your feelings and place them in front of you, and then taking a pace back to give yourself the room to move that a bystander would have, examine them calmly and with complete honesty. The poet has an obligation to conduct a post-mortem on his own corpse and to make public his findings as to any disease he may encounter. There are many ways in which he may do this, but the best, and certainly the most convenient, is to try and compress every single incident which he comes across into the seventeen syllables of a Hokku. Since this is poetry in its handiest and most simple form, it may be readily composed while you are washing your face, or in the lavatory, or on a tram. When I say that it may be readily composed, I do not mean it in any derogatory sense. On the contrary, I think it is a very praiseworthy quality, for it makes it easy for one to become a poet; and to become a poet is one way to achieve supreme enlightenment. No, the simpler it is, the greater its virtue. Let us assume that you are angry: you write about what it is that has made you lose your temper, and immediately it seems that it is someone else's anger that you are considering. Nobody can be angry and write a Hokku at the same time. Likewise, if you are crying, express your tears in seventeen syllables and you feel happy. No sooner are your thoughts down on paper, than all connection between you and the pain which caused you to cry is severed, and your only feeling is one of happiness that you are a man capable of shedding tears."

That pose, as they stand facing each other, remains vividly before my eyes to this day. From where I was seated, the old woman’s face was more or less directly facing me. Ah, how beautiful! I thought, and in that moment her expression burned itself like a photograph into my heart. The face before me now and that face are so intimately alike that the same blood might flow in both.","Two or three years ago I went to see Takasago at the Hosho Noh theatre.

The old man in the play, carrying a broom over his shoulder, took five or six paces along the hashigakari1, and very slowly and sedately turning his back on the audience, came face to face with the old woman. To this day I can still see their postures as they stood there facing one another. From where I was sitting I was able to see the old woman almost full-face, and I thought how beautiful she looked. In that instant her features were indelibly imprinted on my mind. The likeness between the old woman in the tea-shop and that image in my mind was so striking that it quite took my breath away."
立ち上がる時に向うを見ると、路から左の方にバケツを伏せたような峰が聳えている。杉か檜か分からないが根元から頂きまでことごとく蒼黒い中に、山桜が薄赤くだんだらに棚引いて、続ぎ目が確と見えぬくらい靄が濃い。少し手前に禿山が一つ、群をぬきんでて眉に逼る。禿げた側面は巨人の斧で削り去ったか、鋭どき平面をやけに谷の底に埋めている。天辺に一本見えるのは赤松だろう。枝の間の空さえ判然している。行く手は二丁ほどで切れているが、高い所から赤い毛布が動いて来るのを見ると、登ればあすこへ出るのだろう。路はすこぶる難義だ。,"When I stood up, I saw a peak on the left side of the road, which looked like a bucket. I don't know if it's a cedar or a cypress, but it's all dark from the root to the top, and the wild cherry blossoms are shelved in the light red sardines, and the haze is so dark that the seams are not clearly visible. A little in front of you, there is one Bald Mountain, passing through the group and sneaking into your eyebrows. The bald sides have been scraped off with a giant ax, or a sharp plane has been burntly buried at the bottom of the valley. The one you can see on the top is Akamatsu. Even the sky between the branches is clear. The way is cut by about two, but when you see the red blanket moving from a high place, you will probably reach Asuko if you climb. The road is extremely difficult.","As I get back to my feet, my eyes take in the distant scene. To the left of the path soars a mountain peak, in shape rather like an inverted bucket. From foot to summit it is entirely covered in what could be either cypress or cedar, whose blue-black mass is striped and stippled with the pale pink of swaths of blossoming wild cherry. The distance is so hazy that all appears as a single wash of blurred shapes and colors. A little nearer, a single bald mountain rises above the others, lowering over me. Its naked flanks might have been slashed by the ax of some giant; they plunge with a ferocious steepness to bury themselves in the valley floor below. That solitary tree standing on the summit would be a red pine. The very sky between its branches is sharply defined. A few hundred yards ahead of me the path disappears, but the sight of a red-cloaked figure moving along in my direction far above suggests that a farther climb will bring me to that spot. The path is appallingly bad.","As I rose and looked around me, I noticed away off to the left of the track a towering peak shaped like an inverted bucket. It was completely covered from base to summit with dark-green foliage, but whether cryptomeria or cypress I was unable to tell. Here and there among the greenery trail pale red patches of wild cherry in bloom, and overall hangs a haze so thick that it causes the colours to swim and blend, and makes it impossible to make out the gaps between trees and branches clearly. A little nearer is one bare mountain. It stands out sharply from its surroundings, and appears to be almost close enough to touch. Its barren flank seems to have been sheered off by the axe of some colossus, and the angular, craggy rock-face plunges fantastically, straight down to the bottom of the valley far below. That one solitary tree that I can see there on the summit is a red pine I think. Even the patches of sky showing through the branches are clearly defined. About two hundred yards farther on, my path comes to an abrupt end, but looking up I see far above a figure wrapped in a red blanket moving down the mountain-side, and I wonder whether, if I climb, I will come out up there. This is a terrible road."
恍惚と云うのが、こんな場合に用いるべき形容詞かと思う。熟睡のうちには何人も我を認め得ぬ。明覚の際には誰あって外界を忘るるものはなかろう。ただ両域の間に縷のごとき幻境が横わる。醒めたりと云うには余り朧にて、眠ると評せんには少しく生気を剰す。起臥の二界を同瓶裏に盛りて、詩歌の彩管をもって、ひたすらに攪き雑ぜたるがごとき状態を云うのである。自然の色を夢の手前までぼかして、ありのままの宇宙を一段、霞の国へ押し流す。睡魔の妖腕をかりて、ありとある実相の角度を滑かにすると共に、かく和らげられたる乾坤に、われからと微かに鈍き脈を通わせる。地を這う煙の飛ばんとして飛び得ざるごとく、わが魂の、わが殻を離れんとして離るるに忍びざる態である。抜け出でんとして逡巡い、逡巡いては抜け出でんとし、果ては魂と云う個体を、もぎどうに保ちかねて、氤氳たる瞑氛が散るともなしに四肢五体に纏綿して、依々たり恋々たる心持ちである。,"I think ecstasy is an adjective that should be used in such cases. No one can admit me in a deep sleep. No one will forget the outside world when they are awake. However, an illusion like a sword lies between the two areas. It's too hazy to say that it's awake, and it's a little vital to sleep. The two worlds of erection are placed on the back of the bottle, and with the poetry's colored tube, it is said to be in a state of being enthusiastically mixed. Blur the colors of nature to the front of your dreams and push the universe as it is to the land of haze. With the magical arm of the sleeper, the angle of the actual situation is slid, and at the same time, the softened dry crab is made to pass a slightly dull pulse from us. It is a state of my soul that cannot stand away from my shell, just as it cannot fly as a smoke that crawls on the ground. I crawl around as an escape, I crawl as an escape, and I can't keep the individual called the soul in a moody manner. be.","Perhaps the word “entranced” is the most fitting to use here. No one can remain aware in deep sleep; when the mind is conscious and clear, on the other hand, no one can be completely oblivious to the outside world. But between these two states exists a fragile realm of phantasms and visions, too vague to be called waking, too alert to be termed sleep. It is as if the two worlds of sleep and waking were placed in a single pot and thoroughly mixed together with the brush of poetry. Nature’s real colors are spread thin to the very door of dream; the universe is drawn unaltered a little way inside that other misty realm. The magic hand of Morpheus smoothes from the real world’s surfaces all their sharp angles, while within this softened realm a tiny pulse of self still faintly beats. Like smoke that clings to the ground and cannot rise, your soul cannot quite bring itself to leave behind its physical shell. The spirit hovers, hesitant yet urging to find release, until finally you can no longer sustain it in this unfeeling realm, and now the invisible distillations of the universe pervade and wreathe themselves whole about the body, producing a sensation of clinging, of yearning love. I am wandering in this realm between sleep and waking, when the door from the corridor slides smoothly open, and suddenly in the doorway appears, like a phantom, the shape of a woman.","Perhaps spellbound is the best word to describe the condition I was in. Nobody can be conscious of himself when he is fast asleep, just as no one can ignore the world around him when he is wide awake. There lies, however, between these two states a strip of no-man's land in which you cannot be said to be awake, since everything is too obscure, yet on the other hand you are not asleep for a small spark of life still remains. It is as though 'awake' and 'asleep' had been poured into the same jar and stirred with the brush of poetry until thoroughly mixed. Imagine the bright colours of Nature shaded off until they almost, but not quite, fade into a dream; or this clear-cut world adrift in a sea of mist. Use the magic hand of sleep to smooth off all the sharp corners from reality, and then set it, thus tempered, gently pulsating. This is the state I mean. In such a condition your soul is just like smoke which, crawling along the ground, seems always on the point of rising into the air but never quite manages to do so. It tries to leave your body, but cannot bear the parting. Again and again it is on the verge of breaking out, but hesitates every time. Always at the last moment it fights to remain an entity, and twines itself about you lest its vast energy should be dissipated. Eventually, however, you feel its grip growing weaker and weaker."

普通の画は感じはなくても物さえあれば出来る。第二の画は物と感じと両立すればできる。第三に至っては存するものはただ心持ちだけであるから、画にするには是非共この心持ちに恰好なる対象を択ばなければならん。しかるにこの対象は容易に出て来ない。出て来ても容易に纏らない。纏っても自然界に存するものとは丸で趣を異にする場合がある。したがって普通の人から見れば画とは受け取れない。描いた当人も自然界の局部が再現したものとは認めておらん、ただ感興の上した刻下の心持ちを幾分でも伝えて、多少の生命を惝怳しがたきムードに与うれば大成功と心得ている。古来からこの難事業に全然の績を収め得たる画工があるかないか知らぬ。ある点までこの流派に指を染め得たるものを挙ぐれば、文与可の竹である。雲谷門下の山水である。下って大雅堂の景色である。蕪村の人物である。泰西の画家に至っては、多く眼を具象世界に馳せて、神往の気韻に傾倒せぬ者が大多数を占めているから、この種の筆墨に物外の神韻を伝え得るものははたして幾人あるか知らぬ。,"Even if you don't feel like a normal picture, you can do it as long as you have something. The second picture can be made if it is compatible with the thing and the feeling. In the third place, the only thing that exists is the mind, so in order to make a picture, we must select the object that suits this mind. However, this subject does not come out easily. Even if it comes out, it is not easy to put on. Even if you put it on, it may be completely different from what exists in the natural world. Therefore, from the point of view of ordinary people, it cannot be regarded as a picture. The person who drew it does not admit that it was reproduced locally in the natural world, but it would be a great success if it just conveys some of the emotional feelings of the inscription that was impressed and gives a little life to the mood. I know. I don't know if there is a painter who can make a great achievement in this difficult business from ancient times. If you mention the ones that could dye your fingers in this school to a certain point, it is bamboo that can be written. It is the mountain water under the gate of Moya. It is a view of Daigado down. It is a person of Buson. Most of the painters in the Far West have a lot of eyes on the concrete world and are not obsessed with the spirit of the gods, so there are only a few who can convey the gods of this kind to this kind of brush ink. I don't know if there is one.","In an ordinary picture, it’s sufficient to portray the object; feeling is not in question. In the second kind of picture, the object must be compatible with feeling. In the third, all that exists is the feeling, so one is forced to choose some objective phenomenon as its expressive correlative. Such an object, however, is difficult to discover and, once discovered, difficult to make coherent. And even when it is coherently conceived, it often manifests itself in a form radically different from anything found in the natural world. An ordinary person, therefore, would not perceive it as a picture. Indeed, the artist himself acknowledges that it is not a reproduction of some select part of the natural world; he deems it a success if the feeling evoked at the moment of inspiration in some way translates itself onto the canvas, imparting a certain life to the mood that lies outside the sensuous realm, which is the work’s true subject. I don’t know whether any master has ever completely succeeded in performing this difficult task. If I were to name a few works that have approached success in this way, I could point to Wen Tong’s bamboo, and the landscape painting of the Unkoku School. The scenes created by Taigado and the human figures of Buson also come to mind.1 As for Western artists, their eyes are mostly fixed on the external phenomenal world, and the vast majority have had no truck with the higher realms of noble refinement, so I have no idea how many may have been able to impart some spiritual resonance to their depiction of an object.","All that is required to produce the average picture is something to paint. With the second type that I mentioned, however, it is necessary that the artist's feelings should be compatible with his subject. There is yet a third case in which he has to choose a subject which fits his inspiration. This is easier said than done, for very often even if he succeeds in selecting the components of his picture, he cannot cast them into any definite form. Let us suppose, however, that he does manage to produce such a form; the chances are that it will not be anything recognizable, and thus in the eyes of the general public it cannot be considered a picture. Even the artist himself will acknowledge that it does not represent anything which exists in the natural world. He will consider it a great achievement if he can convey a fraction of what he felt at the time he received his inspiration, and if he can bring that same unshakable tranquillity to even a few lives. I do not know whether anyone in the past has ever achieved this tremendous feat completely, but there are works in which the artist has had some degree of success. There are for example the paintings of bamboo by Wen Tung, the landscapes of various types by the Unkoku school and by Ike Taiga, and the character sketches of Buson.1 Since the vast majority of Western painters only take a fleeting glance at the substantial world, and are not at all concerned with matters which lie on such a refined and non-material plane, I should imagine that very few of them would be able to express so ethereal a sense on canvas. It is unfortunate that the type of feeling which Sessyu2 and Buson strove so hard to convey tends to be over simple, and is lacking in variety."

怖いものもただ怖いものそのままの姿と見れば詩になる。凄い事も、己れを離れて、ただ単独に凄いのだと思えば画になる。失恋が芸術の題目となるのも全くその通りである。失恋の苦しみを忘れて、そのやさしいところやら、同情の宿るところやら、憂のこもるところやら、一歩進めて云えば失恋の苦しみそのものの溢るるところやらを、単に客観的に眼前に思い浮べるから文学美術の材料になる。世には有りもせぬ失恋を製造して、自から強いて煩悶して、愉快を貪ぼるものがある。常人はこれを評して愚だと云う、気違だと云う。しかし自から不幸の輪廓を描いて好んでその中に起臥するのは、自から烏有の山水を刻画して壺中の天地に歓喜すると、その芸術的の立脚地を得たる点において全く等しいと云わねばならぬ。この点において世上幾多の芸術家は（日常の人としてはいざ知らず）芸術家として常人よりも愚である、気違である。われわれは草鞋旅行をする間、朝から晩まで苦しい、苦しいと不平を鳴らしつづけているが、人に向って曾遊を説く時分には、不平らしい様子は少しも見せぬ。面白かった事、愉快であった事は無論、昔の不平をさえ得意に喋々して、したり顔である。これはあえて自ら欺くの、人を偽わるのと云う了見ではない。旅行をする間は常人の心持ちで、曾遊を語るときはすでに詩人の態度にあるから、こんな矛盾が起る。して見ると四角な世界から常識と名のつく、一角を磨滅して、三角のうちに住むのを芸術家と呼んでもよかろう。,"If you look at a scary thing as it is, it becomes a poem. A great thing becomes a picture if you leave yourself and think that it is just great alone. That's exactly what broken heart is the subject of art. Forgetting the suffering of a broken heart, the kindness, the place where sympathy dwells, the place where you feel melancholy, and the place where the suffering of a broken heart is overflowing, if you take it one step further, you can simply objectively think of it in front of you. It becomes a material for art. There is something that makes a broken heart that is unprecedented in the world, forcibly annoys itself, and devours pleasure. An ordinary person criticizes this and says that he is stupid, and that he is crazy. However, it is exactly the same in that if you draw a circle of unhappiness from yourself and lie down in it, you can engrave the mountain water of Karasuyu and rejoice in the heaven and earth in the jar, and you will get the artistic standpoint. I have to say. In this respect, many artists in the world are foolish and stupid as artists (unknown as everyday people). We continue to complain that it is painful and painful from morning till night during the strawberry trip, but when we preach to people, we do not show any complaints. Not to mention what was interesting and pleasant, he was good at talking even old complaints, and he was a face. This is not an understanding that he dares to deceive himself or to deceive a person. This contradiction arises because I am a regular person while traveling, and when I talk about excursions, I already have a poet's attitude. If you look at it, you may call it an artist who lives in a triangle by erasing one corner, which is known as common sense from the square world.","If you see something frightening simply as what it is, there’s poetry in it; if you step back from your reactions and view something uncanny on its own terms, simply as an uncanny thing, there’s a painting there. It’s precisely the same if you choose to take heartbreak as the subject for art. You must forget the pain of your own broken heart and simply visualize in objective terms the tender moments, the moments of empathy or unhappiness, even the moments most redolent with the pain of heartbreak. These will then become the stuff of literature and art. Some will manufacture an impossible heartbreak, put themselves through its agonies, and crave its pleasures. The average man considers this to be sheer folly and madness. But someone who willfully creates the lineaments of unhappiness and chooses to dwell in this construction has, it must be said, gained precisely the same vantage point as the artist who can produce from his own being some supernatural landscape and then proceed to delight in his self-created magical realm. In this respect the many artists of the world are madder and more foolish than the average man, at least insofar as they are artists. (I say nothing of how they may be in their everyday guise.) While we are on our journey, shod in our straw sandals as of yore, we may do nothing but grumble about its hardships from dawn to dusk, but when we come to tell the tale to others, we will never make a murmur of such complaints. No, we will speak smugly of its fascinations and pleasures and even proudly prattle on about all those things that annoyed us so much at the time. We do so not from any intention to deceive ourselves, or to lie to others. Rather, the contradiction arises because on the journey we are our everyday selves, while when we tell its tale we speak as poets. I suppose you could say that the artist is one who lives in a three-cornered world, in which the corner that the average person would call “common sense” has been sheared off from the ordinary four-square world that the normal inhabit.","Even something frightening may appear poetic if you stand back and regard it simply as a shape, and the eerie may make an excellent picture if you think of it as something which is completely independent of yourself. Exactly the same is true with disappointed love. Providing that you can divorce yourself from the pain of a broken heart and, conjuring up before you the tenderness, the sympathy, the despair and yes, even the very excess of pain itself, can view them objectively, then you have aesthetic, artistic material. There are those who purposely imagine their hearts to be broken, and crave for the pleasure they get from this form of emotional self-flagellation. The average person dismisses them as foolish, or even a little mad, but there is absolutely no difference, inasmuch as they both have an artistic standpoint, between the man who draws an outline of misery for himself and then leads his life within it, and him whose delight it is, to paint a landscape which never existed, and then to live in a potted universe of his own creation. This being the case then, there are many artists who, outside their everyday lives, in the role of artist are more foolish, more insane than the ordinary man. We tramp around the countryside in search of suitable material, continually complaining from morning till night of the hardships we have to undergo. When, however, we are describing our journey to someone else, we show not even the slightest hint of discontent. Not only do we tell of the interesting and pleasant things that happened to us, which is only natural, but we even babble on proudly about those hardships long ago of which at the time we complained so bitterly. This is not done with any conscious intent of deceiving or cheating the listener. The inconsistency arises because while actually on the journey our feelings are just the same as those of anyone else. It is only afterwards when we tell our experiences to others that we revert to being artists. Putting it as a formula, I suppose you could say that an artist is a person who lives in the triangle which remains after the angle which we may call common sense has been removed from this four-cornered world."

Horsetail seems to grow on the left and right banks. Many willows can be seen on the embankment. Sparsely, low houses have straw roofs in between. Put out the sooted window. Occasionally a white duck is served. The duck crows and comes out into the river.",It is delightful how gently the boat floats on. Those must be field horsetails covering either bank; farther up are stands of willows. Here and there among them a low farmhouse reveals a thatched roof and a glimpse of a sooty window; occasionally a few white geese spill forth and waddle cackling into the river.,"I found the boat's smooth progress delightful. On either hand down by the water's edge were plants which I took to be horsetails, and along the top of the raised embankments were many willow trees, from among which at irregular intervals a low cottage showed its thatched roof and grimy windows. From time to time white ducks from the cottages would come quaking down the bank, and swim out into the river."

やがて階段の上に何物かあらわれた。広い風呂場を照すものは、ただ一つの小さき釣り洋灯ランプのみであるから、この隔りでは澄切った空気を控えてさえ、確と物色はむずかしい。まして立ち上がる湯気の、濃かなる雨に抑えられて、逃場を失いたる今宵の風呂に、立つを誰とはもとより定めにくい。一段を下り、二段を踏んで、まともに、照らす灯影を浴びたる時でなくては、男とも女とも声は掛けられぬ。,"Eventually something appeared on the stairs. Only one small fishing lump lamp illuminates a large bathroom, so it is difficult to find a certain color even if you refrain from the clear air at this distance. In addition, it is difficult to decide who to stand in the bath tonight, where the steam that rises is suppressed by the heavy rain and the escape is lost. Neither a man nor a woman can be called out unless it is time to go down one step, step on two steps, and take a decent illuminating lantern.","A long moment later a form appears at the top of the steps. The large bathhouse is lit by a single small lamp hung from the ceiling, so even if the air were free of steam, it would be hard to make out anything clearly at this distance; now, with the thick steam held down by the evening’s fine rain and prevented from escaping, I cannot discern the identity of the standing figure. Unless it descends one step and its foot goes to the second, and the full light of the lamp bathes it, addressing this figure as either man or woman is impossible.","At length something appeared at the head of the steps. Although large, the room was lit only by one small hanging lantern, and so even had the air been completely clear, it would still have been difficult to distinguish anything accurately at this distance. To make matters worse, however, this evening the rising steam was unable to escape, being shut into the bathroom by the fine drizzle outside, and it became abolutely impossible to tell who was standing there. Whoever it was put one foot down on to the second step, but as at that moment the light was not falling directly on them, I could not make out whether it was a man or a woman, and was thus at a loss what to say."

あの女を役者にしたら、立派な女形が出来る。普通の役者は、舞台へ出ると、よそ行きの芸をする。あの女は家のなかで、常住芝居をしている。しかも芝居をしているとは気がつかん。自然天然に芝居をしている。あんなのを美的生活とでも云うのだろう。あの女の御蔭で画の修業がだいぶ出来た。,"If you make that woman an actor, you can make a good female onnagata. When an ordinary actor goes out to the stage, he performs a trick to go away. That woman is doing a permanent play in the house. Moreover, I don't feel like I'm playing. Playing naturally. That would be called an aesthetic life. Thanks to that woman, I was able to study painting a lot.","As an actor, she would make a marvelous female impersonator on the Kabuki stage. When most actors appear onstage, their performance is that of someone outside the home setting, but she spends her everyday life performing, and she doesn’t even recognize the fact. She’s a natural actor. Hers could truly be called “the artist’s life.” Thanks to Nami, I am well on the path to true painting.","O-Nami, I thought, would make a first class actress. When before the footlights, most actors and actresses have to assume a special manner for the occasion, but O-Nami was different : her home was her stage, and her life one continuous performance. She was, moreover, quite unaware that she was playing a part, for to act was second nature to her. Hers was what, I suppose, you might describe as an aesthetic life.

門を出て、左へ切れると、すぐ岨道つづきの、爪上りになる。鶯が所々で鳴く。左り手がなだらかな谷へ落ちて、蜜柑が一面に植えてある。右には高からぬ岡が二つほど並んで、ここにもあるは蜜柑のみと思われる。何年前か一度この地に来た。指を折るのも面倒だ。何でも寒い師走の頃であった。その時蜜柑山に蜜柑がべた生りに生る景色を始めて見た。蜜柑取りに一枝売ってくれと云ったら、幾顆でも上げますよ、持っていらっしゃいと答えて、樹の上で妙な節の唄をうたい出した。東京では蜜柑の皮でさえ薬種屋へ買いに行かねばならぬのにと思った。夜になると、しきりに銃の音がする。何だと聞いたら、猟師が鴨をとるんだと教えてくれた。その時は那美さんの、なの字も知らずに済んだ。,"As soon as you exit the gate and turn to the left, you will find yourself on the claws that continue on the road. The bush warbler crows here and there. The left hand has fallen into a gentle valley, and tangerines are planted all over. On the right, there are two not-high okas lined up, and it seems that there are only tangerines here. I came here once a few years ago. It's also troublesome to break your finger. Everything was in the cold December. At that time, I first saw the scenery of mandarin oranges growing on Mt. Mikan. When I asked him to sell a branch for mandarin oranges, I would raise any number of condyles. He answered that he should bring it, and sang a strange knot on the tree. In Tokyo, I thought I had to go to a drug store to buy even tangerine peels. At night, there is a constant sound of guns. When I asked him what, he told me that the hunter would take the duck. At that time, I didn't even know Nami-san's character.","Turning left directly outside the gate, I’m soon confronted with a steep path that sets off almost perpendicularly straight up the mountainside. Cries of bush warblers echo here and there among the trees. On my left the gentle slope that descends to the valley is planted with mandarin trees; two low hills stand to my right, apparently also devoted entirely to mandarin orchards. How many years ago was it that I visited here? I can’t be bothered counting. I remember it was a cold December, and it was the first time I’d come across a landscape of hills swathed everywhere with mandarin trees like this. I asked one of the mandarin pickers perched in a tree if I could purchase a branch of them, and he replied cheerily, “Take as many as you want,” and began to sing an odd song. Back in Tokyo, I remember reflecting wonderingly, you had to go to a herbalist to come by so much as the skin of a mandarin. I heard a frequent sound of gunshot, and when I asked what it was, I was told that hunters were out shooting ducks. On that visit I had not the faintest inkling of Nami’s existence.","I turned left out of the gate along a path which very soon began to slope gently upwards. Here and there I could hear the song of an uguisu. The ground to my right fell away into a peaceful valley which was one mass of mandarin orange trees, and to my left, two low hills stood side by side. Here too there seemed to be nothing but a profusion of orange trees. I had been to this area once some years before. I cannot be bothered to work out how many years ago that was, but anyway, it was in December, and it was cold. That was the first time I had ever witnessed the sight of a hillside completely covered with orange trees. I asked one of the pickers if she would sell me a few oranges, and she replied that I was welcome to as many as I wanted, free. Then, still perched at the top of a tree, she began to sing a strange melody. If this were Tokyo, I thought, I would even have to go and buy dried peel at a chemist's. In the evening, I heard guns being fired repeatedly, and when I asked what was happening, was told that it was the hunters out after wild duck. All this, of course, happened at a time when, as yet, I had been spared even so much as the sound of O-Nami's name."

輪廓は次第に白く浮きあがる。今一歩を踏み出せば、せっかくの嫦娥が、あわれ、俗界に堕落するよと思う刹那に、緑の髪は、波を切る霊亀の尾のごとくに風を起して、莽と靡いた。渦捲く煙りを劈いて、白い姿は階段を飛び上がる。ホホホホと鋭どく笑う女の声が、廊下に響いて、静かなる風呂場を次第に向へ遠退く。余はがぶりと湯を呑んだまま槽の中に突立つ。驚いた波が、胸へあたる。縁を越す湯泉の音がさあさあと鳴る。,"The ring gradually emerges white. If you take a step further, the long-awaited Chang'e will be merciless and fall into the world, and the green hair will make a breeze like the tail of a spirit turtle that cuts the waves, and it will flutter. .. The white figure jumps up the stairs with a swirling smoke. The voice of a woman who laughs sharply echoes in the corridor and gradually moves away from the quiet bathroom. I stand in the tank with my sprawl and hot water. A surprised wave hits my chest. The sound of the hot spring that crosses the edge is heard.","The white form grows increasingly distinct. Another step, and this delightful moon maiden may, alas, descend into the common world—but just as the thought crosses my mind, her jet-black hair swirls suddenly like the tail of the mythic turtle that cleaves the waves, starting a sinuous undulation rippling along its length, and up the stairs the white figure leaps, rending the swirling veils of steam as it goes. A woman’s clear peal of laughter echoes away down the corridor; in its wake, the bathroom falls quiet. I gulp in a mouthful of hot water and stand stock-still in the bathtub, while startled waves lap at my chest, spilling with a soft whoosh over the tub’s edge.","The whiteness of the woman's skin came floating towards me, and I feared that with one more step my maiden from the moon would degenerate into a being of this common world. Just then, however, her thick blue-black hair streamed around her with a swish like the tail of some gigantic legendary turtle cleaving through the waves. Next moment her white figure was flying up the steps tearing through the veils of mist. A clear peal of feminine laughter rang out in the corridor and gradually echoed away into the distance, leaving the bathroom quiet again. The water washed over my face, so I stood up. As I did so, startled waves lapped against my chest, and splashed noisily over the sides of the tank."

気のせいか、誰か小声で歌をうたってるような気がする。夢のなかの歌が、この世へ抜け出したのか、あるいはこの世の声が遠き夢の国へ、うつつながらに紛れ込んだのかと耳を峙てる。たしかに誰かうたっている。細くかつ低い声には相違ないが、眠らんとする春の夜に一縷の脈をかすかに搏たせつつある。不思議な事に、その調子はとにかく、文句をきくと――枕元でやってるのでないから、文句のわかりようはない。――その聞えぬはずのものが、よく聞える。あきづけば、をばなが上に、おく露の、けぬべくもわは、おもほゆるかもと長良の乙女の歌を、繰り返し繰り返すように思われる。,"Perhaps because of my mind, I feel like someone is singing a song in a whisper. I wonder if the song in the dream has escaped into the world, or if the voice of the world has slipped into the distant dreamland. Certainly someone is singing. It must be a thin and low voice, but it is faintly smashing a pulse on a sleepy spring night. Curiously, the tone is, anyway, when I complain-I can't understand the complain because I'm not doing it at the bedside. ――You can often hear what you shouldn't hear. It seems that the song of the maiden of Nagara is repeated repeatedly, with the dew on the top and the dew on the top.","Perhaps I am imagining it, but I think I can hear someone softly singing. I strain to catch the sound, wondering whether the song of my dream has somehow slipped out into the real world, or whether a voice from the real world has insinuated itself into the distant realm of my dream. Yes, someone is definitely singing. Small, low voice though it is, a thin thread of sound is pulsing faintly in the sleepy spring night. Strangely, it’s not only the melody that comes to me; when I concentrate, I can also make out the song’s words, though catching them from such distant singing would seem impossible. They are repeating over and over the song of the Nagara maiden: As the autumn’s dew that lies a moment on the tips of the seeding grass, so do I know that I too must","I thought that it was perhaps just my fancy, but I had the feeling that somebody was singing softly. I strained my ears to try and determine whether a song had broken out of my dreams into reality, or whether this was a real voice which, because of my drowsiness, seemed to have been drawn into the obscurity of some distant land of dreams. Yes, somebody was definitely singing. The voice was undeniably thin and low, but nevertheless there it was, a gentle pulse rippling through the spring night which was all but asleep. The strange thing is, however, not that I heard the tune, but that when I listened for the words they came to me clearly, although there was no reason why they should have done, since they were not being sung anywhere near where I was sleeping. They were the words of the maid of Nagara's song, and seemed to be repeated over and over again. From leaves of autumn flushed with love, A pearl of dew shakes free And falls to shatter on the earth beneath."
どうせ誰か出るだろうとは思っていた。竈に火は燃えている。菓子箱の上に銭が散らばっている。線香は呑気に燻っている。どうせ出るにはきまっている。しかし自分の見世を明け放しても苦にならないと見えるところが、少し都とは違っている。返事がないのに床几に腰をかけて、いつまでも待ってるのも少し二十世紀とは受け取れない。ここらが非人情で面白い。その上出て来た婆さんの顔が気に入った。,"I was wondering if anyone would come out anyway. The fire is burning on the pole. Money is scattered on the candy box. The incense stick is smoldering. It's decided to get out anyway. However, it is a little different from the capital in that it does not seem to be a pain even if you let go of your own appearance. It's hard to say that it's the 20th century to sit on the floor and wait forever without a reply. This is inhuman and interesting. Besides, I like the face of the old woman who came out.","I have been expecting someone to emerge sooner or later. The fire in the hearth is lit, after all; coins lie scattered about the cake boxes; the incense is left nonchalantly burning. Someone must eventually appear. But this casual way of leaving the shop open and unattended is rather different from the city ways I’m used to. And to simply go in and make myself at home like this, despite receiving no answer to my call, and to sit there patiently waiting, feels a little like stepping into an earlier century than the twentieth. All this is intriguingly otherworldly, that “nonemotional” realm I aspire to. What’s more, I take an immediate fancy to the face of the old woman who has emerged.","I had known all along that someone must eventually come. It was obvious with the fire alight, coins scattered around the cake boxes, and the incense smouldering leisurely. Nevertheless, this was certainly different from Tokyo if you could leave a shop wide open and unattended without any qualms. Somehow I could not quite believe that coming into a shop and sitting down on a bench uninvited, and then waiting and waiting for ages really belonged to the twentieth century. I was thoroughly enjoying this remoteness from the everyday world, but more than this, I found the old woman's face charming."
「ふん、そうか――さあ御茶が注げたから、一杯」と老人は茶碗を各自の前に置く。茶の量は三四滴に過ぎぬが、茶碗はすこぶる大きい。生壁色の地へ、焦げた丹と、薄い黄で、絵だか、模様だか、鬼の面の模様になりかかったところか、ちょっと見当のつかないものが、べたに描いてある。,"""Hmm, yeah-Come on, I've poured tea, so I have a cup,"" said the old man, putting a bowl in front of him. The amount of tea is only 34 drops, but the bowl is very large. On the ground of the color of the raw wall, the charred tan and the pale yellow, the painting, the pattern, the place where the pattern of the demon's face is about to appear, something that I have no idea is drawn solidly.","“Hm, is that so? . . . Well now, the tea is poured. Do have some,” the old man says, placing a cup before each of us. There are no more than three or four drops of tea in each, though the cups themselves are very large. The glaze is a light gray ground, daubed all over with burnt sienna and pale yellow brushstrokes that may have been intended as a painting or merely as a pattern, reminiscent of a half-formed devil’s face.","'Hm. Did he now?—Well, the tea's poured out, so please start.' So saying he placed a cup before each of us. Although the cup itself was large, there was only a very small amount of tea in the bottom. The dark grey exterior of the cup was covered with deep red and pale yellow brush strokes, but whether these were meant to form a picture, a pattern or a devil's mask motif I could not imagine."

横を向く。床にかかっている若冲の鶴の図が目につく。これは商売柄だけに、部屋に這入った時、すでに逸品と認めた。若冲の図は大抵精緻な彩色ものが多いが、この鶴は世間に気兼なしの一筆がきで、一本足ですらりと立った上に、卵形の胴がふわっと乗かっている様子は、はなはだ吾意を得て、飄逸の趣は、長い嘴のさきまで籠っている。床の隣りは違い棚を略して、普通の戸棚につづく。戸棚の中には何があるか分らない。,"Turn to the side. You can see the figure of Jakuchu's crane hanging on the floor. This is only for business, and when I entered the room, I already recognized it as a gem. Most of Jakuchu's drawings are delicately colored, but this crane is a one-stroke drawing without hesitation, and the appearance of an egg-shaped torso sitting on one leg is fluffy. With my will, the taste of Jakuchu is preserved even before the long beak. Next to the floor, the difference shelf is abbreviated and continues to the ordinary cupboard. I don't know what's in the cupboard.","I turn on my side. Now my eyes take in the painting of cranes by Jakucho that hangs in the alcove.4 Art being my line of work, I registered this as a superb piece when I first entered the room. Most of Jakuchu’s works have a quite delicate coloration, but this crane is executed with a single defiant brushstroke. The featherlight, egg-shaped body poised jauntily on its single leg has a wonderful rightness to it, and the sense of nonchalant ease continues right down to the tip of the beak. Beside the alcove is a single shelf with a cupboard beyond. What is in the cupboard I cannot tell.","Looking sideways, my eyes lighted on a picture of a crane by Jakuchu hanging in an alcove. When I had first entered the room my professional instinct had told me immediately that this was a masterpiece. Most of Jakuchu's pictures are full of the most delicate colours, but this crane had been painted with one stroke of the brush, making no concession to popular taste. The way in which the egg-shaped body perched lightly on the one slender leg on which the crane was standing, showed that the artist had painted this to suit himself. His light-heartedness and disregard for convention were expressed right down to the tip of the bird's beak. Next to the alcove was a simple arrangement of shelves, and then an ordinary cupboard. I wondered what was in there."

この二種の製作家に主客深浅の区別はあるかも知れぬが、明瞭なる外界の刺激を待って、始めて手を下すのは双方共同一である。されど今、わが描かんとする題目は、さほどに分明なものではない。あらん限りの感覚を鼓舞して、これを心外に物色したところで、方円の形、紅緑の色は無論、濃淡の陰、洪繊の線を見出しかねる。わが感じは外から来たのではない、たとい来たとしても、わが視界に横わる、一定の景物でないから、これが源因だと指を挙げて明らかに人に示す訳に行かぬ。あるものはただ心持ちである。この心持ちを、どうあらわしたら画になるだろう――否この心持ちをいかなる具体を藉りて、人の合点するように髣髴せしめ得るかが問題である。,"There may be a distinction between the two types of producers, the depth of the main customer, but it is the one who works together for the first time after waiting for a clear stimulus from the outside world. But now, the subject I am trying to draw is not so clear. Inspiring all the senses, I couldn't find the shape of the square, the color of red and green, of course, the shade of shades, and the line of hong fiber. My feeling does not come from the outside, even if it comes, it is not a constant sight lying in my field of vision, so I can not clearly show to people that this is the cause. Some are just mindful. How can this feeling be expressed as a picture? No, the question is what kind of concreteness this feeling can be made to remind people of their consensus.","These two kinds of artist may differ in their objective and subjective approach and in their depth, yet before either one touches brush to paper, he will wait for a clear stimulus from the outside world. But the subject I wish to depict is not so clear. Though I use all my powers of sensation in order to find an equivalent for it in the outer world, no form, no color, indeed no light shade or dark, no firm or delicate line, suggests itself. What I feel does not originate from outside; or if it does, it does not arise from any single scene present to my eye—I can point to no clearly visible cause for it. All that exists is a feeling. How might I express this feeling in terms of a picture? Or rather, what physical form might I borrow to embody it in a way that would make sense to others? This is the question.","However great the difference in depth of perception between these two types of artist may be, they have one thing in common: they both wait for some definite outside stimulus before putting brush to canvas. In my case, however, there was no such clearly defined subject. Although all my senses were on the alert, search as I might, I was unable to find in the objects around me any combination of shape, light and shade, strength and delicacy of line, and of course colour which was suitable for expressing how I felt. Since this feeling of mine had not come from without, or if it had, not from my visible surroundings, I could not point out any one thing as its source. Sometimes, as then, the feeling of inspiration exists by itself, independent of any material object, and my present problem was how I might express such a feeling as a picture. No, that is not strictly true : the real question was what object could I find which embodied it to such a degree that others looking at my painting would be able to feel as nearly as possible the way I was feeling at that moment."

After I had turned it round once more, carefully feeling the pleasant surface beneath my fingers, I handed it on politely to the abbot.

We can talk as you lie there,” she says airily. That’s true enough, I think, and for the time being I content myself with rolling over onto my stomach and lying chin in hands, elbows propped on the matting.","'Oh, don't bother to sit up.

今余が面前に娉婷と現われたる姿には、一塵もこの俗埃の眼に遮ぎるものを帯びておらぬ。常の人の纏える衣装を脱ぎ捨てたる様と云えばすでに人界に堕在する。始めより着るべき服も、振るべき袖も、あるものと知らざる神代の姿を雲のなかに呼び起したるがごとく自然である。,"The appearance of me now appearing as a 娉婷 in front of me does not carry anything that obstructs the eyes of this profane dust. Speaking of taking off the costumes that ordinary people wear, they have already fallen into the human world. The clothes that should be worn from the beginning and the sleeves that should be shaken are as natural as evoking the unfamiliar appearance of the gods in the clouds.","The graceful beauty before my eyes at this moment has about her not one jot of this crude worldliness. Normal people who divest themselves of their clothes thereby lower themselves to the baser realm of human existence, but she is as natural as a figure conjured from the cloudy realms of the age of the gods, innocent of any necessity for clothes and draperies.","There was, however, no trace of any such vulgarity about the exquisite form before me.

花曇りの空が、刻一刻に天から、ずり落ちて、今や降ると待たれたる夕暮の欄干に、しとやかに行き、しとやかに帰る振袖の影は、余が座敷から六間の中庭を隔てて、重き空気のなかに蕭寥と見えつ、隠れつする。,"The cloudy sky of flowers slides down from heaven every moment, and when it falls, it goes to the parapet of the evening twilight, and the shadow of the furisode that returns gracefully is the shadow of the furisode, which separates the courtyard from the tatami room to the six rooms. It looks like a balustrade in the heavy air and hides.","I stare across the twelve yards or so of courtyard garden, breath held, while the lone figure appears and disappears, parading gracefully to and fro at the balcony railing as the evening spring sky, already freighted with cloud, grows gradually heavier with the promise of rain.","As so often happens in blossom time, a cloudy haze had gradually descended to deepen the dusk, bringing warning that at any moment it would rain. But over there, twelve yards away across the inner courtyard, the woman in the bridal gown continued her same graceful walk back and forth along the verandah. She had about her an air of serenity as she moved through the heavy air, her figure playing hide-and-seek among the evening shadows."
秋の霧は冷やかに、たなびく靄は長閑に、夕餉炊く、人の煙は青く立って、大いなる空に、わがはかなき姿を托す。様々の憐れはあるが、春の夜の温泉の曇りばかりは、浴するものの肌を、柔らかにつつんで、古き世の男かと、われを疑わしむる。眼に写るものの見えぬほど、濃くまつわりはせぬが、薄絹を一重破れば、何の苦もなく、下界の人と、己れを見出すように、浅きものではない。一重破り、二重破り、幾重を破り尽すともこの煙りから出す事はならぬ顔に、四方よりわれ一人を、温かき虹の中に埋め去る。酒に酔うと云う言葉はあるが、煙りに酔うと云う語句を耳にした事がない。あるとすれば、霧には無論使えぬ、霞には少し強過ぎる。ただこの靄に、春宵の二字を冠したるとき、始めて妥当なるを覚える。,"The autumn fog is chilly, the fluttering mist is quiet, the supper is cooked, the smoke of people stands blue, and the great sky is filled with my own appearance. There are various mercy, but the cloudiness of the hot springs on spring nights softly wraps the skin of the bather, and I doubt that he is an old man. It's not so dark that you can't see what you see in your eyes, but if you break the thin silk, it's not so shallow that you can find yourself with people in the lower world without any pain. With a face that can't be emitted from this smoke even if it's broken single, double, or broken many times, one person from all sides is buried in a warm rainbow. There is a word to get drunk, but I have never heard the word to get drunk with smoke. If so, it can't be used for fog, of course, it's a little too strong for haze. However, when I put the two letters of spring evening on this mist, I remember that it was valid for the first time.","Chill autumn fog, a spring mist’s serenely trailing fingers, and the blue smoke that rises as the evening meal is cooked—all deliver up to the heavens the transient form of our ephemeral self. Each touches us in its different way. But only when I am wrapped, naked, by these soft spring clouds of evening steam, as now, do I feel I could well be someone from a past age. The steam envelops me but not so densely that the visible world is lost to view; neither is it a mere thin, silken swath that, were it to be whipped away, would reveal me as a normal naked mortal of this world. My face is hidden within voluminous layers of veiling steam that swirl all about me, burying me deep within its warm rainbows. I have heard the expression “drunk on wine” but never “drunk on vapors.” If such an expression existed, of course, it could not apply to mist and would be too heady to apply to haze. This phrase would seem truly applicable only to this fog of steam, with the necessary addition of the descriptive “spring evening.”","The cold mists of autumn; the tranquil haze which hangs over the world in spring; the blue smoke rising from cooking fires at evening; all these are capable of drawing my ephemeral form up with them into the limitless expanse of the heavens. Yes, there are many things which can charm me, and whose cry finds an answering echo within me; but only on a spring evening, with my body softly enveloped in clouds of steam from a hot bath, can I feel that I belong to a bygone age. The steam which draped itself around me was not so dense that I was unable to see. Nor yet was it as thin as a layer of sheer silk which may easily be torn aside to reveal the ordinary mortal figure beneath. I was isolated in a warm rainbow: shut in on all sides by steam from which I could never emerge however many layers I might pull aside. One can talk of becoming drunk on wine, but I have never heard the phrase 'to become drunk on vapour'. Even if there were such a phrase, it could not of course be used of mist, and is rather too strong to use of haze. Nevertheless it does become apt when used to describe the steam rising from a hot bath, but then only in the context of a spring evening."
「ありがとう」またありがとうが出た。菓子皿のなかを見ると、立派な羊羹が並んでいる。余はすべての菓子のうちでもっとも羊羹が好だ。別段食いたくはないが、あの肌合が滑らかに、緻密に、しかも半透明に光線を受ける具合は、どう見ても一個の美術品だ。ことに青味を帯びた煉上げ方は、玉と蠟石の雑種のようで、はなはだ見て心持ちがいい。のみならず青磁の皿に盛られた青い煉羊羹は、青磁のなかから今生れたようにつやつやして、思わず手を出して撫でて見たくなる。西洋の菓子で、これほど快感を与えるものは一つもない。クリームの色はちょっと柔かだが、少し重苦しい。ジェリは、一目宝石のように見えるが、ぶるぶる顫えて、羊羹ほどの重味がない。白砂糖と牛乳で五重の塔を作るに至っては、言語道断の沙汰である。,"""Thank you"" Thank you again.

Especially, the bluish method of raising is like a hybrid of ball and pyrophyllite, and it is nice to see it. Not only that, the blue yokan on the celadon plate is glossy as if it was born from the celadon, and you will want to put your hand out and stroke it. No Western confectionery is as pleasurable as it is. The color of the cream is a little soft, but a little heavy. Jeri looks like a jewel at first glance, but it's sloppy and not as heavy as yokan.

Not that I particularly want to eat it, but that velvety, dense texture, with its semitranslucent glow, makes it a work of art by any standards. I especially enjoy the sight of yokan that has a slightly blue-green sheen, like a mixture of gemstones and alabaster—and this bluish yokan piled on the plate glistens as if it has just this moment been born from within the celadon, so that my hand almost twitches with the urge to reach out and stroke it. No Western sweet gives this degree of pleasure. The color of cream is quite soft, I grant you, but it’s rather oppressive. Jelly looks at first sight like a jewel, but it trembles and lacks the weightiness of yokan. And as for those tiered pagodas of white sugar and milk, they’re simply execrable.","'Thank you. '—There it was again. Looking into the cake bowl which she had brought I saw that it contained some green 'yokan' made from bean jelly. I think that if all cakes, yokan are my favourite. It is not that I especially enjoy eating them, but I consider that their smooth fine texture, and the way in which they become semi-transparent when the light falls on them, makes them indisputably an objet dart. These yokan were particularly pleasant to look at, for their green-tinged lustre made them look as though they were precious stones, or as though they had been fashioned from alabaster. They so matched the bowl in colour and in glaze, that it seemed as though the very porcelain itself had just given birth to them. As I looked at them, I had an overwhelming desire to stretch out my hand, and gently run my fingers over the glistening surfaces. There is not a single Western cake which can give one so much pleasure. Cream, I admit, has a soft colour, but for all that there is something rather heavy about it. Jelly looks like a jewel, but its trembling and shaking deprive it of the solidity of a yokan; while that intricately shaped heap of sugar and milk which they call blancmange is an absurdity which is beyond the power of words to describe."

またこう感じた。うつくしき人が、うつくしき眠りについて、その眠りから、さめる暇もなく、幻覚のままで、この世の呼吸を引き取るときに、枕元に病を護るわれらの心はさぞつらいだろう。四苦八苦を百苦に重ねて死ぬならば、生甲斐のない本人はもとより、傍に見ている親しい人も殺すが慈悲と諦らめられるかも知れない。しかしすやすやと寝入る児に死ぬべき何の科があろう。眠りながら冥府に連れて行かれるのは、死ぬ覚悟をせぬうちに、だまし打ちに惜しき一命を果すと同様である。どうせ殺すものなら、とても逃れぬ定業と得心もさせ、断念もして、念仏を唱えたい。死ぬべき条件が具わらぬ先に、死ぬる事実のみが、ありありと、確かめらるるときに、南無阿弥陀仏と回向をする声が出るくらいなら、その声でおういおういと、半ばあの世へ足を踏み込んだものを、無理にも呼び返したくなる。仮りの眠りから、いつの間とも心づかぬうちに、永い眠りに移る本人には、呼び返される方が、切れかかった煩悩の綱をむやみに引かるるようで苦しいかも知れぬ。慈悲だから、呼んでくれるな、穏かに寝かしてくれと思うかも知れぬ。それでも、われわれは呼び返したくなる。余は今度女の姿が入口にあらわれたなら、呼びかけて、うつつの裡から救ってやろうかと思った。しかし夢のように、三尺の幅を、すうと抜ける影を見るや否や、何だか口が聴けなくなる。今度はと心を定めているうちに、すうと苦もなく通ってしまう。なぜ何とも云えぬかと考うる途端に、女はまた通る。こちらに窺う人があって、その人が自分のためにどれほどやきもき思うているか、微塵も気に掛からぬ有様で通る。面倒にも気の毒にも、初手から、余のごときものに、気をかねておらぬ有様で通る。今度は今度はと思うているうちに、こらえかねた、雲の層が、持ち切れぬ雨の糸を、しめやかに落し出して、女の影を、蕭々と封じ了る。,"I felt like this again. When a beautiful person takes a breath of the world from his sleep, with no time to wake up, and to take the breath of the world, our hearts to protect the illness at the bedside will be painful. If you die in a hundred pains and pains, you may kill not only the person who is not worth living, but also the close people who are looking at you, but you may be given up as mercy. But what kind of family should a child fall asleep easily? Being taken to the Netherworld while sleeping is like dying and dying. If it's something to kill anyway, I'd like to have a very unavoidable regular work and a strong spirit, give up, and recite the Nembutsu. If there is a voice that turns around with Namu Amida Butsu when confirming that there is only the fact that he will die before the conditions for dying are in place, he will go to the middle of the world with that voice. I want to forcibly recall what I have stepped into. For the person who goes from a tentative sleep to a long sleep without realizing it, it may be painful for the person to be recalled to pull the rope of anxiety that is about to break. You may think that you shouldn't call me because you're merciful, and let me sleep peacefully. Still, we want to call back. When I saw a woman at the entrance next time, I thought I would call her and save her from the hump. However, like a dream, as soon as I see the shadow passing through the width of 3 shaku, I can't hear it. This time, while I was determined, I passed through without difficulty. As soon as I can wonder why I can't say anything, the woman passes again. There is a person who looks at me, and I don't care how much the person thinks for me. Whether it's a hassle or a pity, from the beginning, you can pass through things like that without worrying about it. This time, while I was thinking this time, the layer of clouds, which I couldn't hold back, gracefully casts out the rain thread that I couldn't hold, and closed the shadow of the woman.","Another image: when a beautiful woman falls into lovely slumber and in the midst of this sleep draws her last breath in this world, we who watch by her pillow are stricken with grief. But if to the given pains of existence a thousand pains are added in dying, the woman herself, weary of pointless living, would feel with those who watch over her that relief from her suffering would be nothing but merciful. But how does a young child who dies easily in his sleep deserve his fate? A child drawn down to the realms of the dead in sleep has lived its precious life in a blind moment, with no preparation for death. If someone must be killed, let him first feel the absolute karmic inevitability of the fact, resign himself, and die with a prayer on his lips. If before your eyes is only the vivid fact of death, without the conditions that naturally lead to death, then you long not to chant the last rites over the dying but to cry out and summon back those feet that have already stepped halfway into the other world. Perhaps she who is slipping unaware from her mortal into her immortal sleep suffers by being called back like this, being dragged unwillingly by the chains of existence that she was in the act of severing. Be merciful, she may think, and do not call me, but let me quietly sleep. And yet we long to call. When the woman appears once more beyond the doorway, I have just such an urge, to call her back and save her from the depths of unreality—but when her dreamlike form glides across the three-foot-wide space before my eyes, I find myself speechless. The next time, I decide, but then once more she slips past. Why can’t I speak? I wonder, and as I wonder she passes again. She passes without the least show of awareness that someone might be watching, or might be gripped by anxiety for her. She passes in seeming indifference to the likes of me, neither burdened by my fears nor pitying me for them. As I watch, summoning myself again and again to call, the clouds at last began to spill the moisture they have so long withheld, and soft threads of rain close their melancholy curtain about that distant form.","At this point my thoughts turned on to another tack. Imagine a beautiful girl who is apparently sleeping peacefully, but who, without gaining consciousness at all, dies. How heartbreaking it would be for those sitting around the sickbed in such circumstances. If her pain had gradually become worse and worse until it had reached unbearable proportions, then not only would she herself have felt that life was not worth living, but her loved ones too might have reconciled themselves to the fact that death would be a merciful release. When, however, the child merely drifts into sleep and then dies, they wonder what they can possibly have done to deserve such a thing. To be carried off over the Styx like that without a chance to prepare oneself is, they think, tantamount to being tricked into a fatal ambush. If death must come, they would like to be forewarned so that they can resign themselves to the inevitable and pray for the soul of the dying girl. The chances are, however, that if they knew she were going to die before the actual event, they would not raise their voices to the Lord Buddha to ask him to receive this person who had already taken one step towards the next world, but would instead call out to the girl herself to make her return to them. To a person who is on the verge of slipping unawares from the sleep of this world into the sleep of eternity it may be painful to be called back, for it is merely adding one more strand to the rope of human passions which bound her to life, and which otherwise would soon have broken. She herself might say if she could, 'In the name of mercy, do not call me. Let me sleep in peace.' Nevertheless they would still want to call her. I thought that the next time I saw the woman through the doorway, I might call out to her to rouse her from the coma into which she had fallen. No sooner had the shadow glided like a dream back into view, however, than my tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of my mouth. I made up my mind that the next time I would call without fail, but again I could not. As I was trying to work out why it was that I was unable to say anything, the woman passed by yet again. It was obvious that she had not the slightest idea that there was somebody over here who kept watching for her, and who was worrying about her so anxiously. It irked me the way she seemed to consider it beneath her dignity to notice such a person as I. I was still saying, 'Next time, next time,' to myself, when the layer of clouds, as if unable to hold back any longer, let fall a melancholy screen of fine rain which completely hid the figure from sight.

茫々たる薄墨色の世界を、幾条の銀箭が斜めに走るなかを、ひたぶるに濡れて行くわれを、われならぬ人の姿と思えば、詩にもなる、句にも咏まれる。有体なる己れを忘れ尽して純客観に眼をつくる時、始めてわれは画中の人物として、自然の景物と美しき調和を保つ。ただ降る雨の心苦しくて、踏む足の疲れたるを気に掛ける瞬間に、われはすでに詩中の人にもあらず、画裡の人にもあらず。依然として市井の一豎子に過ぎぬ。雲煙飛動の趣も眼に入らぬ。落花啼鳥の情けも心に浮ばぬ。蕭々として独り春山を行く吾の、いかに美しきかはなおさらに解せぬ。初めは帽を傾けて歩行た。後にはただ足の甲のみを見詰めてあるいた。終りには肩をすぼめて、恐る恐る歩行た。雨は満目の樹梢を揺かして四方より孤客に逼る。非人情がちと強過ぎたようだ。,"If you think of me as a stranger, I'm scolded by the phrase, as I'm getting wet in the world of brilliant light ink, while the silver arrows run diagonally. .. For the first time, as a person in the painting, we maintain a beautiful harmony with the natural scenery when we forget our tangible self and create an eye for pure objectiveness. However, at the moment when the rain was painful and I was worried about the tiredness of my stepping feet, I was neither the person in the poetry nor the person in the painting. It's still just one of Ichinoi's children. I can't even see the taste of cloud smoke flying. The compassion of the deciduous bird does not come to my mind. I still can't understand how beautiful I am when I go to Haruyama alone. At first, I tilted my cap and walked. After that, I was just staring at the instep. At the end, I shrugged and walked terrifyingly. The rain shakes the full treetops and crawls into lonely guests from all sides. It seems that he was too inhumane.","If I picture myself, a sodden figure moving in this vast ink-wash world of cloud and rain shot through diagonally with a thousand silver arrows, not as myself but as some other person, there’s poetry in this moment. When I relinquish all thought of the self as is and cultivate the gaze of pure objectivity, then for the first time, as a figure in a painting, I attain a beautiful harmony with the natural phenomena around me. The instant I revert to thoughts of my distress at the falling rain and the weariness of my legs , I lose my place in the world of the poem or painting. I am as before, a mere callow townsman. The swirling brushstrokes of cloud and mist are a closed book to me; no poetic sentiment of falling blossom or calling bird stirs my breast; I have no way of understanding the beauty of my own self as it moves lonely as cloud and rain among the spring mountains. . . . To begin with, I tilt my hat and stride out. Later, I simply walk with eyes fixed on my feet. In the end, I am plodding unsteadily along, with shoulders hunched. The branches filling my vision sway in the blowing rain, which drives in relentlessly from every direction upon the solitary traveler. This is a bit too much of the unhuman for my taste!","When I think of it as happening to somebody else, it seems that the idea of me soaked to the skin, surrounded by countless driving streaks of silver, and moving through a vast grey expanse, would make an admirable poem. Only when I completely forget my material existence, and view myself from a purely objective standpoint, can I, as a figure in a painting, blend into the beautiful harmony of my natural surroundings. The moment, however, I feel annoyed because of the rain, or miserable because my legs are weary with walking, then I have already ceased to be a character in a poem, or a figure in a painting, and I revert to the uncomprehending, insensitive man in the street I was before. I am then even blind to the elegance of the fleeting clouds; unable even to feel any bond of sympathy with a falling petal or the cry of a bird, much less appreciate the great beauty in the image of myself, completely alone, walking through the mountains in spring. At first I had pulled my hat down over one eye and walked briskly. Later I gazed down fixedly at my feet Finally, very subdued, I hunched my shoulders and took one dejected step after another. On all sides the wind shook the tree-tops, hurrying a solitary figure on his way. I felt that I had been carried rather too far in the direction of detachment from humanity! Footnotes 1"

「いいや、今に食う」と云ったが実際食うのは惜しい気がした。ターナーがある晩餐の席で、皿に盛るサラドを見詰めながら、涼しい色だ、これがわしの用いる色だと傍の人に話したと云う逸事をある書物で読んだ事があるが、この海老と蕨の色をちょっとターナーに見せてやりたい。いったい西洋の食物で色のいいものは一つもない。あればサラドと赤大根ぐらいなものだ。滋養の点から云ったらどうか知らんが、画家から見るとすこぶる発達せん料理である。そこへ行くと日本の献立は、吸物でも、口取でも、刺身でも物奇麗に出来る。会席膳を前へ置いて、一箸も着けずに、眺めたまま帰っても、目の保養から云えば、御茶屋へ上がった甲斐は充分ある。,"I said, ""No, I'll eat now,"" but I felt sorry to actually eat it. At a dinner table with Turner, while staring at the salad on the plate, I read in a book that it was a cool color, telling a neighbor that this was the color I used, but with this shrimp. I want to show the color of the warabi to Turner. No Western food has a nice color. If there is, it's like salad and red radish. I don't know if it's from a nourishing point of view, but from the painter's point of view, it's a very developed dish. If you go there, you can make Japanese menus beautiful with soup, mouthpiece, and sashimi. Even if you put the kaiseki meal in front of you, don't wear a chopstick, and go home while looking at it, it's worth going to the teahouse in terms of eye candy.","“No, no, I’m just about to have it,” I reply, but in fact it looks too beautiful to eat. I once read somewhere an anecdote about the artist Turner at a banquet, remarking to his neighbor as he gazed at the salad piled on the plate before him that this cool fresh color was the sort he himself used. I would love to show Turner the color of these fern shoots and prawn. Not a single Western food has a color that could be called beautiful—the only exceptions I can think of are salad and radishes. I’m in no position to speak of its nutritional value, but to the artist’s eye it is a thoroughly uncivilized cuisine. On the other hand, artistically speaking, everything on a Japanese menu, from the soups to the hors d’oeuvres to the raw fish, is beautifully conceived. If you did no more than gaze at the banquet tray set before you at an elegant restaurant, without lifting a chopstick, and then go home again, the feast for the eyes would have been more than sufficient to make the visit worth your while.","'Oh yes, I like it. I'll eat it in a moment,' I replied; but to tell the truth I thought it a great pity to eat something which was so delightful to look at. I remember reading a story about Turner in an art book once. It seemed that one evening at a dinner he gazed for a long time at the salad on his plate, and then remarked to the person sitting next to him that he found its colour cool and refreshing, and that it was one which he often used. I just wished that I could have let Turner see the colour of those shrimps and ferns. There is not a single Western dish, with perhaps the possible exception of salad and radishes, which could be said to have an attractive colour. What the nutritional value is I am unable to say, but from the artistic point of view their food is extremly uncivilized. Japanese food on the other hand, whether it be soup, hors d'oeuvres or raw fish is always beautiful. It is so pleasant to see that it is worth going to a tea-house just to look at the dishes laid out before you, even if you come away without eating a single mouthful."
「めでたく、淵川へ身を投げんでも済んだ訳だね」,"""Congratulations, you've just thrown yourself into the Fuchi River.""","“Well, it’s a blessing she didn’t have to end up throwing herself in a pool, isn’t it.” “Ah, but . . .","'Well, at least she escaped having to throw herself in the river.'"
「はあい。まことに山の中で……旦那あ、峠で御降られなさって、さぞ御困りでござんしたろ」,"""Hello. Really in the mountains ... Husband, I'm sorry for the trouble that you didn't fall at the pass.""","“That’s true. It’s certainly deep in the hills here. But tell me, sir—you’d have had a good soaking coming over the pass after we met the other day, I should think.”","'Yes, it certainly is isolated . . . . You must have had a terrible time of it in all that rain up in the pass.' 'Eh? Oh, you're the packhorse driver I met there.'"
「我慢は先から、もうだいぶしたよ。御願だから、もう少し湯か石鹼をつけとくれ」,"""I've had a lot of patience from the beginning. I'm hoping for it, so please add a little more hot water or soap.""","You just put up with it a bit longer.” “I’ve been putting up with a lot for quite a while now. Come on, add a bit more hot water or soap, can’t you?”","Just bear it a bit longer, sir.' 'Bear it? That's exactly what I have been doing for a long time. Rub some soap on, or at least some warm water— please.'"
「うん」,"""Yes""",“Ah?”,'Go on.'
「何しに行くんですか。御金を拾いに行くんだか、死にに行くんだか、分りません」,"""What are you going to do? I don't know if you're going to pick up your money or die.""","“What will he do there? I don’t know, he may make some money, or he may die.”","'What for?' 'Who knows. To get some money maybe, or perhaps to die.'"
路は幾筋もあるが、合うては別れ、別れては合うから、どれが本筋とも認められぬ。どれも路である代りに、どれも路でない。草のなかに、黒赤い地が、見えたり隠れたりして、どの筋につながるか見分のつかぬところに変化があって面白い。,"There are many roads, but none of them can be recognized as the main line because they are separated and separated. Instead of being roads, none are roads. It's interesting that the black-red ground can be seen or hidden in the grass, and there is a change in the place where you can't tell which line it connects to.","The main path has become indistinguishable among the numerous tracks that meet and part and intersect. All are a path of some sort, and none is the path itself. A further interesting confusion is the intriguing patches of dark red earth that are visible here and there in the grass, not clearly connected to this or that track.","The path now split into many threads which converged and separated, crossed and recrossed in such a complex fashion that it was impossible to say that any of them was the main one. The result of this entanglement was that instead of every thread being a path, none of them was. The dark red earth of the tracks showed in irregular patches among the clumps of grass, and I found the unpredictability of its progress entertaining."
まだ十五丁かと、振り向いているうちに、馬子の姿は影画のように雨につつまれて、またふうと消えた。,"While I was still turning around, the figure of Mako was wrapped in rain like a shadow puppet and disappeared again.","Still a mile to go, I think, as the driver’s figure envelops itself in rain like some shadowy magic lantern form and becomes lost to sight once more.","Still another mile to go! I looked back, watching the pack-horse driver, like some figure on a flickering magic lantern screen, melting gradually away into the rain, until finally he disappeared completely."
十,Ten,CHAPTER 10,For a long time I just sat there gazing vacantly into space.
空しき家を、空しく抜ける春風の、抜けて行くは迎える人への義理でもない。拒むものへの面当でもない。自から来りて、自から去る、公平なる宇宙の意である。掌に顎を支えたる余の心も、わが住む部屋のごとく空しければ、春風は招かぬに、遠慮もなく行き抜けるであろう。,"The spring breeze that escapes through an empty house is not a duty to the person who welcomes it. It's not an allowance for what you refuse. It means a fair universe that comes from oneself and leaves oneself. If the extra heart that supports the chin on the palm is empty like the room in which I live, the spring breeze will not invite me, and I will pass through without hesitation.","The spring breeze that wafts emptily through the vacant house comes neither to gratify those who welcome it nor to spite those who would bar it. No, it is the spirit of the impartial universe, which comes of its own whim, and of its own whim departs again. Were my heart, as I sit here, chin cupped in propped palm, as empty as the room around me, the spring breeze would surely blow unbidden clean through it as well.","The spring breeze, which was passing drowsily through the empty house, came neither to gratify those who welcomed it, nor to spite those who wished to keep it out. It came and went quite naturally: an expression of the impartiality of the universe. I sat with my chin resting in my hands, thinking that if only my heart were as free and open as my room, the breeze would, unbidden, have found its way there too."
「大徹様の所へ行きます」,"""I'm going to Daitetsu-sama""",“She visits Mr. Daitetsu.”,"'She goes to see Daitetsu, sir.' Now I began to understand."
「番茶を一つ御上り。志保田の隠居さんのような甘い茶じゃない」,"""One bancha is served. It's not a sweet tea like Shibota's retired tea.""","“Have a cup of coarse-leaf tea. It’s not the delicious tea that Mr. Shioda makes, mind you.”","It's very poor quality, I'm afraid. Not nearly as good as old Mr Shioda's.'"
「じゃ非人情の続きを伺いましょう。それから？」,"""Let's hear the continuation of inhumanity. Then?""","“Well then, let’s hear the next bit of your nonemotional story. What happens now?”",'Let's get on with the next instalment of objectivity. What happens after that?'
