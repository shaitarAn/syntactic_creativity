わたしは男を片附けてしまうと、今度はまた女の所へ、男が急病を起したらしいから、見に来てくれと云いに行きました。これも図星に当ったのは、申し上げるまでもありますまい。女は市女笠を脱いだまま、わたしに手をとられながら、藪の奥へはいって来ました。ところがそこへ来て見ると、男は杉の根に縛られている、――女はそれを一目見るなり、いつのまに懐から出していたか、きらりと小刀を引き抜きました。わたしはまだ今までに、あのくらい気性の烈しい女は、一人も見た事がありません。もしその時でも油断していたらば、一突きに脾腹を突かれたでしょう。いや、それは身を躱したところが、無二無三に斬り立てられる内には、どんな怪我も仕兼ねなかったのです。が、わたしも多襄丸ですから、どうにかこうにか太刀も抜かずに、とうとう小刀を打ち落しました。いくら気の勝った女でも、得物がなければ仕方がありません。わたしはとうとう思い通り、男の命は取らずとも、女を手に入れる事は出来たのです。,"When I got rid of the man, I went to the woman again to see him because he seemed to have a sudden illness. Needless to say, this also hit the star. The woman, with her hat off the city, went into the bush while being taken by me. However, when he came there, the man was tied to the roots of the cedar, and the woman glanced at it and pulled out the knife, wondering when she had taken it out of her bosom. I have never seen a woman with such a strong temperament. If I had been alert at that time, I would have been stabbed in the spleen belly. No, it was hesitant, but he couldn't do any injuries while he was slashed. However, since I am also Tayomaru, I managed to shoot down the sword without pulling out the sword. No matter how good a woman is, if she doesn't have a good deal, it can't be helped. At last, as I expected, I was able to get a woman without taking the life of a man.","That’s all there was to it. Once I finished with the man, I went and told the woman that her husband had suddenly been taken ill and she should come and have a look at him. This was another bull’s-eye, of course. She took off her hat and let me lead her by the hand into the grove. As soon as she saw the man tied to the tree, though, she whipped a dagger out of her breast. I never saw a woman with such fire! If I’d been off my guard, she’d have stuck that thing in my gut. And the way she kept coming, she would have done me some damage eventually no matter how much I dodged. Still, I am Tajōmaru. One way or another, I managed to knock the knife out of her hand without drawing my sword. Even the most spirited woman is going to be helpless if she hasn’t got a weapon. And so I was able to make the woman mine without taking her husband’s life.","When I disposed of him, I went to his woman and asked her to come and see him, because he seemed to have been suddenly taken sick. It's needless to say that this plan also worked well. The woman, her sedge hat off, came into the depths of the grove, where I led her by the hand. The instant she caught sight of her husband, she drew a small sword. I've never seen a woman of such violent temper. If I'd been off guard, I'd have got a thrust in my side. I dodged, but she kept on slashing at me. She might have wounded me deeply or killed me. But I'm Tajomaru. I managed to strike down her small sword without drawing my own. The most spirited woman is defenseless without a weapon. At last I could satisfy my desire for her without taking her husband's life."
清水寺に来れる女の懺悔ざんげ,The confession of a woman who can come to Kiyomizuderani,Penitent Confession of a Woman in the Kiyomizu Temple,THE CONFESSION OF A WOMAN WHO HAS COME TO THE SHIMIZU TEMPLE
この多襄丸と云うやつは、洛中に徘徊する盗人の中でも、女好きのやつでございます。昨年の秋鳥部寺の賓頭盧の後の山に、物詣でに来たらしい女房が一人、女の童と一しょに殺されていたのは、こいつの仕業だとか申して居りました。その月毛に乗っていた女も、こいつがあの男を殺したとなれば、どこへどうしたかわかりません。差出がましゅうございますが、それも御詮議下さいまし。,"This Tayomaru is a woman-loving thief who roams in Rakuchu. It was said that it was his work that a wife who seemed to have come to visit the temple was killed together with a girl child in the mountain after the guesthouse Roh of Akitoribeji Temple last year. The woman on the palomino doesn't know where or what to do if he kills the man. We have a lot of submissions, but please understand that as well.","Of all the bandits prowling around Kyoto, this Tajōmaru is known as a fellow who likes the women. Last fall, people at Toribe Temple found a pair of worshippers murdered—a woman and a child—on the hill behind the statue of Binzuru.2 Everybody said Tajōmaru must have done it. If it turns out he killed the man, there’s no telling what he might have done to the woman who was on the horse. I don’t mean to meddle, Sir, but I do think you ought to question him about that.","Of all the robbers prowling around Kyoto, this Tajomaru has given the most grief to the women in town. Last autumn a wife who came to the mountain back of the Pindora of the Toribe Temple, presumably to pay a visit, was murdered, along with a girl. It has been suspected that it was his doing. If this criminal murdered the man, you cannot tell what he may have done with the man's wife. May it please your honor to look into this problem as well."
娘でございますか？娘の名は真砂、年は十九歳でございます。これは男にも劣らぬくらい、勝気の女でございますが、まだ一度も武弘のほかには、男を持った事はございません。顔は色の浅黒い、左の眼尻に黒子のある、小さい瓜実顔でございます。,"Are you a daughter? My daughter's name is Masago and she is nineteen years old. This is a woman who is as courageous as a man, but I have never had a man other than Takehiro. The face is dark in color, with a mole on the left corner of the eye, and is a small melon face.","My daughter, Sir? Her name is Masago, and she is nineteen years old. She’s as bold as any man, but the only man she has ever known is Takehiro. Her complexion is a little on the dark side, and she has a mole by the outside corner of her left eye, but her face is a tiny, perfect oval.","My daughter? Her name is Masago, and her age is nineteen. She is a spirited, fun-loving girl, but I am sure she has never known any man except Takehiko. She has a small, oval, dark-complected face with a mole at the corner of her left eye."
わたしは男が倒れると同時に、血に染まった刀を下げたなり、女の方を振り返りました。すると、――どうです、あの女はどこにもいないではありませんか？わたしは女がどちらへ逃げたか、杉むらの間を探して見ました。が、竹の落葉の上には、それらしい跡も残っていません。また耳を澄ませて見ても、聞えるのはただ男の喉に、断末魔の音がするだけです。,"As soon as the man fell, I lowered my blood-stained sword and looked back at the woman. Then-how about, isn't that woman nowhere? I looked for the space between Sugimura to see where the woman fled. However, there are no such marks left on the fallen leaves of bamboo. Also, even if you listen carefully, all you can hear is the sound of a dead end in the throat of a man.","As he went down, I lowered my bloody sword and turned toward the woman. But she was gone! I looked for her among the cedars, but the bamboo leaves on the ground showed no sign she’d ever been there. I cocked my ear for any sound of her, but all I could hear was the man’s death rattle.","When he fell, I turned toward her, lowering my blood-stained sword. But to my great astonishment she was gone. I wondered to where she had run away. I looked for her in the clump of cedars. I listened, but heard only a groaning sound from the throat of the dying man."

――その紺の水干を着た男は、わたしを手ごめにしてしまうと、縛られた夫を眺めながら、嘲るように笑いました。夫はどんなに無念だったでしょう。が、いくら身悶えをしても、体中にかかった縄目は、一層ひしひしと食い入るだけです。わたしは思わず夫の側へ、転ぶように走り寄りました。いえ、走り寄ろうとしたのです。しかし男は咄嗟の間に、わたしをそこへ蹴倒しました。ちょうどその途端です。わたしは夫の眼の中に、何とも云いようのない輝きが、宿っているのを覚りました。何とも云いようのない、――わたしはあの眼を思い出すと、今でも身震いが出ずにはいられません。口さえ一言も利けない夫は、その刹那の眼の中に、一切の心を伝えたのです。しかしそこに閃いていたのは、怒りでもなければ悲しみでもない、――ただわたしを蔑んだ、冷たい光だったではありませんか？わたしは男に蹴られたよりも、その眼の色に打たれたように、我知らず何か叫んだぎり、とうとう気を失ってしまいました。,"――The man wearing the dark blue suikan laughed as if he was ridiculing me, looking at my tied up husband. How regrettable my husband was! However, no matter how much you writhe, the ropes that hang all over your body will only bite into you. I instinctively ran to my husband's side like a fall. No, I tried to run up. But the man kicked me down there during the humor. Just as soon as that happens. I found an indescribable brilliance dwelling in my husband's eyes. I can't say anything-I can't help but tremble when I remember those eyes. The husband, who couldn't even speak a word, conveyed all his heart to the moment's eyes. But what was flashing there was neither anger nor sadness-just a cold light that looked down on me, wasn't it? Rather than being kicked by a man, I was struck by the color of his eyes, screaming something unknowingly, and finally fainted.","After the man in the dark blue robe had his way with me, he looked at my husband, all tied up, and taunted him with laughter. How humiliated my husband must have felt! He squirmed and twisted in the ropes that covered his body, but the knots ate all the deeper into his flesh. Stumbling, I ran to his side. No—I tried to run to him, but instantly the man kicked me down. And that was when it happened: that was when I saw the indescribable glint in my husband’s eyes. Truly, it was indescribable. It makes me shudder to recall it even now. My husband was unable to speak a word, and yet, in that moment, his eyes conveyed his whole heart to me. What I saw shining there was neither anger nor sorrow. It was the cold flash of contempt—contempt for me. This struck me more painfully than the bandit’s kick. I let out a cry and collapsed on the spot.","That man in the blue silk kimono, after forcing me to yield to him, laughed mockingly as he looked at my bound husband. How horrified my husband must have been! But no matter how hard he struggled in agony, the rope cut into him all the more tightly. In spite of myself I ran stumblingly toward his side. Or rather I tried to run toward him, but the man instantly knocked me down. Just at that moment I saw an indescribable light in my husband's eyes. Something beyond expression... his eyes make me shudder even now. That instantaneous look of my husband, who couldn't speak a word, told me all his heart. The flash in his eyes was neither anger nor sorrow... only a cold light, a look of loathing. More struck by the look in his eyes than by the blow of the thief, I called out in spite of myself and fell unconscious."
盗人は妻が逃げ去った後、太刀や弓矢を取り上げると、一箇所だけおれの縄を切った。「今度はおれの身の上だ。」――おれは盗人が藪の外へ、姿を隠してしまう時に、こう呟いたのを覚えている。その跡はどこも静かだった。いや、まだ誰かの泣く声がする。おれは縄を解きながら、じっと耳を澄ませて見た。が、その声も気がついて見れば、おれ自身の泣いている声だったではないか？（三度、長き沈黙）,"After his wife fled, the thief picked up his sword and bow and arrow and cut my rope in only one place. ""This time it's on my body.""-I remember muttering when the thief hid himself outside the bush. The traces were all quiet. No, I still hear someone crying. As I untied the rope, I listened carefully. However, when I noticed that voice, wasn't it my own crying voice? (Three times, long silence)","After my wife ran off, the bandit picked up my sword and bow and arrows, and he cut my ropes at one place. “Now it’s my turn to run,” I remember hearing him mutter as he disappeared from the thicket. Then the whole area was quiet. No—I could hear someone weeping. While I was untying myself, I listened to the sound, until I realized—I realized that I was the one crying. (Another long silence.)","After she ran away, he took up my sword, and my bow and arrows. With a single stroke he cut one of my bonds. I remember his mumbling, “My fate is next.” Then he disappeared from the grove. All was silent after that. No, I heard someone crying. Untying the rest of my bonds, I listened carefully, and I noticed that it was my own crying. (Long silence.)"
その内にやっと気がついて見ると、あの紺の水干の男は、もうどこかへ行っていました。跡にはただ杉の根がたに、夫が縛られているだけです。わたしは竹の落葉の上に、やっと体を起したなり、夫の顔を見守りました。が、夫の眼の色は、少しもさっきと変りません。やはり冷たい蔑みの底に、憎しみの色を見せているのです。恥しさ、悲しさ、腹立たしさ、――その時のわたしの心の中は、何と云えば好いかわかりません。わたしはよろよろ立ち上りながら、夫の側へ近寄りました。,"When I finally noticed it, the dark blue suikan man had already gone somewhere. My husband is just tied to the roots of the cedar in the trace. I finally got up on the fallen leaves of bamboo and watched over my husband's face. However, the color of my husband's eyes hasn't changed at all. After all, the color of hatred is shown at the bottom of the cold contempt. Shame, sadness, annoyance-I don't know what to say in my heart at that time. I stood up and approached my husband's side.","When I regained consciousness, the man in blue was gone. The only one there in the grove was my husband, still tied to the cedar tree. I just barely managed to raise myself on the carpet of dead bamboo leaves, and look into my husband’s face. His eyes were exactly as they had been before, with that same cold look of contempt and hatred. How can I describe the emotion that filled my heart then? Shame… sorrow… anger… I staggered over to him. “Oh, my husband!","In the course of time I came to, and found that the man in blue silk was gone. I saw only my husband still bound to the root of the cedar. I raised myself from the bamboo-blades with difficulty, and looked into his face; but the expression in his eyes was just the same as before. Beneath the cold contempt in his eyes, there was hatred. Shame, grief, and anger... I don't know how to express my heart at that time. Reeling to my feet, I went up to my husband."

藪の中,In the bush,IN A BAMBOO GROVE,IN A GROVE
妻はおれがためらう内に、何か一声叫ぶが早いか、たちまち藪の奥へ走り出した。盗人も咄嗟に飛びかかったが、これは袖さえ捉えなかったらしい。おれはただ幻のように、そう云う景色を眺めていた。,"While I hesitated, my wife immediately ran into the bush as soon as she shouted something. The thief also jumped at him, but it seems he didn't even catch his sleeve. I was just looking at the scenery like a phantom.","When I hesitated with my answer, my wife let out a scream and darted into the depths of the bamboo thicket. He sprang after her, but I don’t think he even managed to lay a hand on her sleeve. I watched the spectacle as if it were some kind of vision.","While I hesitated, she shrieked and ran into the depths of the grove. The robber instantly snatched at her, but he failed even to grasp her sleeve."
これも造作はありません。わたしはあの夫婦と途づれになると、向うの山には古塚がある、この古塚を発いて見たら、鏡や太刀が沢山出た、わたしは誰も知らないように、山の陰の藪の中へ、そう云う物を埋めてある、もし望み手があるならば、どれでも安い値に売り渡したい、――と云う話をしたのです。男はいつかわたしの話に、だんだん心を動かし始めました。それから、――どうです。欲と云うものは恐しいではありませんか？それから半時もたたない内に、あの夫婦はわたしと一しょに、山路へ馬を向けていたのです。,"This also has no features. When I got lost with that couple, there was an old mound on the other side of the mountain, and when I left this old mound, I saw a lot of mirrors and swords. He said that he had such a thing buried in the bush, and if he had a desire, he would like to sell it at a cheap price. One day the man began to move more and more to my story. Then-how is it? Isn't greed scary? Less than half an hour later, the couple turned their horses to the mountain road with me.","It was easy. I fell in with them on the road and made up a story. I told them I had found an old burial mound4 in the hills, and when I opened it it was full of swords and mirrors and things. I said I had buried the stuff in a bamboo grove on the other side of the mountain to keep anyone from finding out about it, and I’d sell it cheap to the right buyer. He started getting interested soon enough. It’s scary what greed can do to people, don’t you think? In less than an hour, I was leading that couple and their horse up a mountain trail.","It was quite easy. I became their traveling companion, and I told them there was an old mound in the mountain over there, and that I had dug it open and found many mirrors and swords. I went on to tell them I'd buried the things in a grove behind the mountain, and that I'd like to sell them at a low price to anyone who would care to have them. Then...you see, isn't greed terrible? He was beginning to be moved by my talk before he knew it. In less than half an hour they were driving their horse toward the mountain with me."
その時誰か忍び足に、おれの側へ来たものがある。おれはそちらを見ようとした。が、おれのまわりには、いつか薄闇が立ちこめている。誰か、――その誰かは見えない手に、そっと胸の小刀を抜いた。同時におれの口の中には、もう一度血潮が溢れて来る。おれはそれぎり永久に、中有の闇へ沈んでしまった。………,"At that time, someone sneaked up and came to my side. I tried to look there. However, someday there is darkness around me. Someone-that someone gently pulled out his chest knife in his invisible hand. At the same time, blood spills into my mouth again. I sank into the darkness of the bardo forever. ………","Then stealthy footsteps came up to me. I tried to see who it was, but the darkness had closed in all around me. Someone—that someone gently pulled the dagger from my chest with an invisible hand. Again a rush of blood filled my mouth, but then I sank once and for all into the darkness between lives.",Then someone crept up to me. I tried to see who it was. But darkness had already been gathering round me. Someone...that someone drew the small sword softly out of my breast in its invisible hand. At the same time once more blood flowed into my mouth. And once and for all I sank down into the darkness of space.
さようでございます。あの死骸を見つけたのは、わたしに違いございません。わたしは今朝いつもの通り、裏山の杉を伐りに参りました。すると山陰の藪の中に、あの死骸があったのでございます。あった処でございますか？それは山科の駅路からは、四五町ほど隔たって居りましょう。竹の中に瘦せ杉の交った、人気のない所でございます。,"Goodbye. I must have found that corpse. As usual this morning, I came to cut the cedar in the back mountain. Then, there was that corpse in the bush in the Sanin region. Where was it? It should be about 45 towns away from the Yamashina station road. It is an unpopular place with bamboo and sugi.","That is true, Your Honor. I am the one who found the body. I went out as usual this morning to cut cedar in the hills behind my place. The body was in a bamboo grove on the other side of the mountain. Its exact location? A few hundred yards off the Yamashina post road. A deserted place where a few scrub cedar trees are mixed in with the bamboo.","YES, SIR. Certainly, it was I who found the body. This morning, as usual, I went to cut my daily quota of cedars, when I found the body in a grove in a hollow in the mountains. The exact location? About 150 meters off the Yamashina stage road. It's an out-of-the-way grove of bamboo and cedars."
あの男を殺したのはわたしです。しかし女は殺しはしません。ではどこへ行ったのか？それはわたしにもわからないのです。まあ、お待ちなさい。いくら拷問にかけられても、知らない事は申されますまい。その上わたしもこうなれば、卑怯な隠し立てはしないつもりです。,"I was the one who killed that man. But the woman does not kill. Where did you go? I don't even know it. Well, please wait. No matter how much you are tortured, you will not be told what you do not know. Besides, if this happens, I will not hide it cowardly.","Sure, I killed the man. But I didn’t kill the woman. So, where did she go? I don’t know any better than you do. Now, wait just a minute—you can torture me all you want, but I can’t tell you what I don’t know. And besides, now that you’ve got me, I’m not going to hide anything. I’m no coward.","I killed him, but not her. Where's she gone? I can't tell. Oh, wait a minute. No torture can make me confess what I don't know. Now things have come to such a head, I won't keep anything from you."
はい、あの死骸は手前の娘が、片附いた男でございます。が、都のものではございません。若狭の国府の侍でございます。名は金沢の武弘、年は二十六歳でございました。いえ、優しい気立でございますから、遺恨なぞ受ける筈はございません。,"Yes, that corpse is a man whose daughter in the foreground has cleared up. However, it does not belong to the capital. I am a samurai of Kokufu in Wakasa. His name was Takehiro Kanazawa, and he was 26 years old. No, I have a gentle temper, so I shouldn't accept any grudges.","Yes, Your Honor, my daughter was married to the dead man. He is not from the capital, though. He was a samurai serving in the Wakasa provincial office. His name was Kanazawa no Takehiro, and he was twenty-six years old. No, Sir, he was a very kind man. I can’t believe anyone would have hated him enough to do this.","Yes, sir, that corpse is the man who married my daughter. He does not come from Kyoto. He was a samurai in the town of Kokufu in the province of Wakasa. His name was Kanazawa no Takehiko, and his age was twenty-six. He was of a gentle disposition, so I am sure he did nothing to provoke the anger of others."
盗人にこう云われると、妻はうっとりと顔を擡げた。おれはまだあの時ほど、美しい妻を見た事がない。しかしその美しい妻は、現在縛られたおれを前に、何と盗人に返事をしたか？おれは中有に迷っていても、妻の返事を思い出すごとに、嗔恚に燃えなかったためしはない。妻は確かにこう云った、――「ではどこへでもつれて行って下さい。」（長き沈黙）,"When the thief said this, my wife was fascinated by her face. I have never seen a beautiful wife like that time. But how did the beautiful wife reply to the thief in front of me, who is now tied up? Even if I was at a loss for the bardo, every time I remembered my wife's reply, I never burned. My wife did say, ""Where are you going to get tangled up?"" (Long silence)","The bandit had the gall to speak to her like that! When my wife raised her face in response to him, she seemed almost spellbound. I had never seen her look so beautiful as she did at that moment. And what do you think this beautiful wife of mine said to the bandit, in my presence—in the presence of her husband bound hand and foot? My spirit may be wandering now between one life and the next, but every time I recall her answer, I burn with indignation. “All right,” she told him, “take me anywhere you like.” (Long silence.)","While the criminal talked, my wife raised her face as if in a trance. She had never looked so beautiful as at that moment. What did my beautiful wife say in answer to him while I was sitting bound there? I am lost in space, but I have never thought of her answer without burning with anger and jealousy. Truly she said, ...”Then take me away with you wherever you go.”"
わたしが搦め取った男でございますか？これは確かに多襄丸と云う、名高い盗人でございます。もっともわたしが搦め取った時には、馬から落ちたのでございましょう、粟田口の石橋の上に、うんうん呻って居りました。時刻でございますか？時刻は昨夜の初更頃でございます。いつぞやわたしが捉え損じた時にも、やはりこの紺の水干に、打出しの太刀を佩いて居りました。ただ今はそのほかにも御覧の通り、弓矢の類さえ携えて居ります。さようでございますか？あの死骸の男が持っていたのも、――では人殺しを働いたのは、この多襄丸に違いございません。革を巻いた弓、黒塗りの箙、鷹の羽の征矢が十七本、――これは皆、あの男が持っていたものでございましょう。はい。馬もおっしゃる通り、法師髪の月毛でございます。その畜生に落されるとは、何かの因縁に違いございません。それは石橋の少し先に、長い端綱を引いたまま、路ばたの青芒を食って居りました。,"Am I the man I gave up? This is certainly a famous thief called Tayomaru. However, when I got rid of it, I think I had fallen from the horse, and I was groaning on the stone bridge at Awataguchi. Is it the time? The time is around the beginning of last night. Whenever I missed it, I still had a sword of launch in this dark blue suikan. Now, as you can see, I also carry bows and arrows. Goodbye? It must be this Tayomaru that the corpse man had, and that he worked as a murderer. A leather-wrapped bow, a black-painted quiver, and seventeen hawk-winged quivers-all of which must have been possessed by that man. Yes. As the horse says, it is a palomino with a lawyer's hair. There must be something to do with being dropped by the brute. It was just ahead of the stone bridge, eating the blue awns on the side of the road, with a long horse-return.","The man I captured, Your Honor? I am certain he is the famous bandit, Tajōmaru. True, when I caught him he had fallen off his horse, and he was moaning and groaning on the stone bridge at Awataguchi. The time, Sir? It was last night at the first watch.1 He was wearing the same dark blue robe and carrying the same long sword he used the time I almost captured him before. You can see he also has a bow and arrows now. Oh, is that so, Sir? The dead man, too? That settles it, then : I’m sure this Tajōmaru fellow is the murderer. A leather-wrapped bow, a quiver in black lacquer, seventeen hawk-feather arrows —they must have belonged to the victim. And yes, as you say, Sir, the horse is a dappled gray with a touch of red, and it has a clipped mane. It’s only a dumb animal, but it gave that bandit just what he deserved, throwing him like that. It was a short way beyond the bridge, trailing its reins on the ground and eating plume grass by the road.","The man that I arrested? He is a notorious brigand called Tajomaru. When I arrested him, he had fallen off his horse. He was groaning on the bridge at Awataguchi. The time? It was in the early hours of last night. For the record, I might say that the other day I tried to arrest him, but unfortunately he escaped. He was wearing a dark blue silk kimono and a large plain sword. And, as you see, he got a bow and arrows somewhere. You say that this bow and these arrows look like the ones owned by the dead man? Then Tajomaru must be the murderer. The bow wound with leather strips, the black lacquered quiver, the seventeen arrows with hawk feathers — these were all in his possession I believe. Yess sir, the horse is, as you say, a sorrel with a fine mane. A little beyond the stone bridge I found the horse grazing by the roadside, with his long rein dangling. Surely there is some providence in his having been thrown by the horse."
何、男を殺すなぞは、あなた方の思っているように、大した事ではありません。どうせ女を奪うとなれば、必ず、男は殺されるのです。ただわたしは殺す時に、腰の太刀を使うのですが、あなた方は太刀は使わない、ただ権力で殺す、金で殺す、どうかするとおためごかしの言葉だけでも殺すでしょう。なるほど血は流れない、男は立派に生きている、――しかしそれでも殺したのです。罪の深さを考えて見れば、あなた方が悪いか、わたしが悪いか、どちらが悪いかわかりません。（皮肉なる微笑）,"What, the mystery of killing a man is not a big deal, as you might think. Whenever a woman is robbed, a man is killed. But when I kill, I use a sword on my waist, but you don't use a sword, you just kill with power, you kill with money, and somehow you'll kill with just a sword. No blood, the man is alive, but he still killed. Given the depth of sin, I don't know if you are bad or I am bad. (Ironic smile)","Oh come on, killing a man is not as big a thing as people like you seem to think. If you’re going to take somebody ’s woman, a man has to die. When I kill a man, I do it with my sword, but people like you don’t use swords. You gentlemen kill with your power, with your money, and sometimes just with your words: you tell people you’re doing them a favor. True, no blood flows, the man is still alive, but you’ve killed him all the same. I don’t know whose sin is greater—yours or mine. (A sarcastic smile.)","To me killing isn't a matter of such great consequence as you might think. When a woman is captured, her man has to be killed anyway. In killing, I use the sword I wear at my side. Am I the only one who kills people? You, you don't use your swords. You kill people with your power, with your money. Sometimes you kill them on the pretext of working for their good. It's true they don't bleed. They are in the best of health, but all the same you've killed them. It's hard to say who is a greater sinner, you or me. (An ironical smile.)"

死骸は縹の水干に、都風のさび烏帽子をかぶったまま、仰向けに倒れて居りました。何しろ一刀とは申すものの、胸もとの突き傷でございますから、死骸のまわりの竹の落葉は、蘇芳に滲みたようでございます。いえ、血はもう流れては居りません。傷口も乾いて居ったようでございます。おまけにそこには、馬蠅が一匹、わたしの足音も聞えないように、べったり食いついて居りましたっけ。,"The corpse was lying on its back in the suikan of the hanada, wearing a city-style rust eboshi hat. Although it is said to be a sword, it is a puncture wound on the chest, so the fallen leaves of bamboo around the corpse seem to have smeared into Suho. No, blood isn't flowing anymore. It seems that the wound was also dry. What's more, there was a horse bot, and I was eating so that I couldn't even hear my footsteps.","The man was lying on his back in his pale blue robe with the sleeves tied up and one of those fancy Kyoto-style black hats with the sharp creases. He had only one stab wound, but it was right in the middle of his chest; the bamboo leaves around the body were soaked with dark red blood. No, the bleeding had stopped. The wound looked dry, and I remember it had a big horsefly sucking on it so hard the thing didn’t even notice my footsteps.","The body was lying flat on its back dressed in a bluish silk kimono and a wrinkled head-dress of the Kyoto style. A single sword-stroke had pierced the breast. The fallen bamboo-blades around it were stained with bloody blossoms. No, the blood was no longer running. The wound had dried up, I believe. And also, a gad-fly was stuck fast there, hardly noticing my footsteps."
しかし男を殺さずとも、女を奪う事が出来れば、別に不足はない訳です。いや、その時の心もちでは、出来るだけ男を殺さずに、女を奪おうと決心したのです。が、あの山科の駅路では、とてもそんな事は出来ません。そこでわたしは山の中へ、あの夫婦をつれこむ工夫をしました。,"However, if you can take a woman without killing a man, there is no shortage. No, at that time, I decided to take the woman without killing the man as much as possible. However, that is not possible at that Yamashina station road. So I devised a way to bring the couple into the mountains.","Of course, if you can take the woman without killing the man, all the better. Which is exactly what I was hoping to do yesterday. It would have been impossible on the Yamashina post road, of course, so I thought of a way to lure them into the hills.","But it would be good if I could capture a woman without killing her man. So, I made up my mind to capture her, and do my best not to kill him. But it's out of the question on the Yamashina stage road. So I managed to lure the couple into the mountains."
あの男がかようになろうとは、夢にも思わずに居りましたが、真に人間の命なぞは、如露亦如電に違いございません。やれやれ、何とも申しようのない、気の毒な事を致しました。,"I never dreamed that the man would be like that, but the true mystery of human life must be Nyoro-Yoden. Oh my god, I'm sorry to say nothing.","I would never have dreamt that a thing like this could happen to such a man. Ah, what is the life of a human being—a drop of dew, a flash of lightning? This is so sad, so sad. What can I say?",Little did I expect that he would meet such a fate. Truly human life is as evanescent as the morning dew or a flash of lightning. My words are inadequate to express my sympathy for him.
「ではお命を頂かせて下さい。わたしもすぐにお供します。」,"""Then give me your life. I will serve you soon.""","“This is the end, then. Please be so good as to allow me to take your life. I will quickly follow you in death.”","Raising it over head, once more I said, “Now give me your life. I'll follow you right away.”"
太刀か何かは見えなかったか？いえ、何もございません。ただその側の杉の根がたに、縄が一筋落ちて居りました。それから、――そうそう、縄のほかにも櫛が一つございました。死骸のまわりにあったものは、この二つぎりでございます。が、草や竹の落葉は、一面に踏み荒されて居りましたから、きっとあの男は殺される前に、よほど手痛い働きでも致したのに違いございません。何、馬はいなかったか？あそこは一体馬なぞには、はいれない所でございます。何しろ馬の通う路とは、藪一つ隔たって居りますから。,"Didn't you see a sword or something? No, there is nothing. However, a rope had fallen on the root of the cedar on that side. Then-yes, there was one comb besides the rope. It is these two things that were around the corpse. However, the fallen leaves of grass and bamboo had been trampled all over, so it must have been a very painful work before the man was killed. What was the horse? That is a place that cannot be put into a horse mystery. After all, it's one bush away from the road that horses take.","Did I see a sword or anything? No, Sir, not a thing. Just a length of rope by the cedar tree next to the body. And—oh yes, there was a comb there, too. Just the rope and the comb is all. But the weeds and the bamboo leaves on the ground were pretty trampled down: he must have put up a tremendous fight before they killed him. How’s that, Sir—a horse? No, a horse could never have gotten into that place. It’s all bamboo thicket between there and the road.","You ask me if I saw a sword or any such thing? No, nothing, sir. I found only a rope at the root of a cedar near by. And...well, in addition to a rope, I found a comb. That was all. Apparently he must have made a battle of it before he was murdered, because the grass and fallen bamboo-blades had been trampled down all around. “A horse was near by?” No, sir. It's hard enough for a man to enter, let alone a horse."
