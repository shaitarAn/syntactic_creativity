I knew clearly that I couldn't live.","I stood up , took out my wallet and opened it. Three copper coins. It was less shame than horror that assaulted me at that moment.

My only other possessions were the kimono and coat I was wearing. These were the hard facts. I perceived with clarity that I could not go on living.","I stood and, taking my coin purse from the sleeve of my kimono, I discovered that I had only three copper coins.

父は、桜木町の別荘では、来客やら外出やら、同じ家にいても、三日も四日も自分と顔を合せる事が無いほどでしたが、しかし、どうにも、父がけむったく、おそろしく、この家を出て、どこか下宿でも、と考えながらもそれを言い出せずにいた矢先に、父がその家を売払うつもりらしいという事を別荘番の老爺ろうやから聞きました。,"At the villa in Sakuragi-cho, my dad never met himself for three or four days, even if he was in the same house as a guest or going out.

自分はヒラメの家を出て、新宿まで歩き、懐中の本を売り、そうして、やっぱり途方にくれてしまいました。自分は、皆にあいそがいいかわりに、「友情」というものを、いちども実感した事が無く、堀木のような遊び友達は別として、いっさいの附き合いは、ただ苦痛を覚えるばかりで、その苦痛をもみほぐそうとして懸命にお道化を演じて、かえって、へとへとになり、わずかに知合っているひとの顔を、それに似た顔をさえ、往来などで見掛けても、ぎょっとして、一瞬、めまいするほどの不快な戦慄に襲われる有様で、人に好かれる事は知っていても、人を愛する能力に於おいては欠けているところがあるようでした。（もっとも、自分は、世の中の人間にだって、果して、「愛」の能力があるのかどうか、たいへん疑問に思っています）そのような自分に、所謂「親友」など出来る筈は無く、そのうえ自分には、「訪問ヴィジット」の能力さえ無かったのです。他人の家の門は、自分にとって、あの神曲の地獄の門以上に薄気味わるく、その門の奥には、おそろしい竜みたいな生臭い奇獣がうごめいている気配を、誇張でなしに、実感せられていたのです。,"I left the flounder's house, walked to Shinjuku, sold a book in my pocket, and I was at a loss. Instead of being dizzy with everyone, I have never realized ""friendship"", and apart from playmates like Horiki, all the relationships are just painful. He played a clown hard to relieve his pain, and instead became exhausted, and even if he saw the face of a person he knew slightly, even a face similar to it, in the traffic, he was scared. For a moment, he was struck by a dizzying and unpleasant horror, and although he knew that he was liked by people, he seemed to lack the ability to love people. (However, I am very wondering if even human beings in the world have the ability of ""love"".) There is no way I can be a so-called ""best friend"", and I am also myself. Did not even have the ability to ""visit visits"". For me, the gate of another person's house is more fragile than the gate of the hell of that divine song, and in the back of the gate, I can feel the sign that a terrifying dragon-like fishy beast is moving, without exaggeration. It was being done.","After leaving Flatfish's house I walked as far as Shinjuku, where I sold the books I had in my pockets. Then I stood there uncertainly, utterly at a loss what to do. Though I have always made it my practice to be pleasant to everybody, I have not once actually experienced friendship. I have only the most painful recollections of my various acquaintances with the exception of such companions in pleasure as Horiki. I have frantically played the clown in order to disentangle myself from these painful relationships, only to wear myself out as a result. Even now it comes as a shock if by chance I notice in the street a face resembling someone I know however slightly, and I am at once seized by a shivering violent enough to make me dizzy. I know that I am liked by other people, but I seem to be deficient in the faculty to love others. (I should add that I have very strong doubts as to whether even human beings really possess this faculty.) It was hardly to be expected that someone like myself could ever develop any close friendships—besides, I lacked even the ability to pay visits. The front door of another person's house terrified me more than the gate of Inferno in the Divine Comedy, and I am not exaggerating when I say that I really felt I could detect within the door the presence of a horrible dragon-like monster writhing there with a dank, raw smell. I had no friends.","so I scribbled it in the margins—there was nothing more to it than that. I walked a little ways to Shinjuku and sold the books I’d taken with me. That done, as you might suppose, I had absolutely no idea what to do next. I got along with almost everyone, but I’d never known true “friendship.” Drinking friends like Horiki aside, all my interactions with other people were nothing more than exercises in suffering. I played the clown in the hopes of mitigating that suffering, but the clowning itself left me exhausted. If I saw someone on the street with whom I had even the slightest acquaintance, or even someone who looked like an acquaintance, I gave a sudden start; a shudder of disgust rippled through me, leaving me dizzy. I was well liked by others, but it seems I lacked the ability to love them back. (Or rather, let’s say I have grave doubts as to whether or not anyone in this world possesses the ability to “love.”) It was only natural, then, that a person like me would not have any “close friends.” It was all but impossible for me to even “visit” people. The gates of another’s house were more disturbing to me than the gates of hell in The Divine Comedy. Somewhere, I knew, in those depths beyond the gate, a terrible beast lurked, a dragon writhed, filling the air with the stench of rotting meat. I had no friends."

Women, on the other hand, have no sense of moderation.

It seems that he is active in the case of giving up ownership and making money.) He rarely sits in the store, and usually starts in the morning with a difficult face and goes out in a hurry, and he is away. One of the eight little boys, this is my watchman, so even if I have a free time to catch a ball outside with the children in the neighborhood, it seems that I think that the presence on the second floor is stupid or mad, and it is an adult adult. I told myself about the preaching, and because I was a quality that I couldn't argue with, I was tired and impressed, listened to it, and obeyed it. This little boy is a hidden child of Shibata, but there are still strange circumstances, Shibata does not call himself a so-called parent and child, and Shibata is always single, it seems that there is a reason for that, and I myself before I feel like I've heard rumors about it from people in my house, but I'm not really interested in other people's bodies, so what's the deep thing? I don't even know. However, the kid's eyes also had a strange reminiscent of the fish's eyes, or they were really flatfish hidden children ... but then they were really lonely parents and children. Late at night, I used to order soba and other foods and eat them silently, without telling myself on the second floor.","Flatfish's house was near the Okubo Medical School. The signboard of his shop, which proclaimed in bold letters ""Garden of the Green Dragon, Art and Antiques,"" was the only impressive thing about the place. The shop itself was a long, narrow affair, the dusty interior of which contained nothing but shelf after shelf of useless junk. Needless to say, Flatfish did not depend for a living on the sale of this rubbish; he apparently made his money by performing such services as transferring possession of the secret property of one client to another—to avoid taxes. Flatfish almost never waited in the shop. Usually he set out early in the morning in a great hurry, his face set in a scowl, leaving a boy of seventeen to look after the shop in his absence. Whenever this boy had nothing better to do, he used to play catch in the street with the children of the neighborhood. He seemed to consider the parasite living on the second floor a simpleton if not an outright lunatic. He used even to address me lectures in the manner of an older and wiser head. Never having been able to argue with anybody, I submissively listened to his words, a weary though admiring expression on my face. I seemed to recall having heard long ago from the people at home gossip to the effect that this clerk was an illegitimate son of Flatfish, though the two of them never addressed each other as father and son. There must have been some reason for this and for Flatfish's having remained a bachelor, but I am congenitally unable to take much interest in other people, and I don't know anything beyond what I have stated. However, there was undoubtedly something strangely fish-like about the boy's eyes, leading me to wonder if the gossip might not be true. But if this were the case, this father and son led a remarkably cheerless existence. Sometimes, late at night, they would order noodles from a neighborhood shop—just for the two of them, without inviting me—and they ate in silence, not exchanging so much as a word.","Though his enthusiastically lettered sign boldly announced the presence of a purveyor of fine arts and antiques, the “Garden of the Green Dragon,” his business was in fact nothing but one of two shops in a tiny row house, with a cramped doorway and, inside, shelves lined with useless rubbish, all covered in a thick layer of dust. (Flounder did not rely on the rubbish in his shop to support himself but rather earned his crust as a go-between—facilitating the transfer of one gentleman’s treasures to another.) Flounder was hardly ever in the shop. He left early each morning with a scowl on his face, and, while he was gone, a shop boy of about seventeen or eighteen was responsible for keeping an eye on me. He spent every spare moment playing catch in the street with the other boys from the neighborhood. I was just a loafer on the second floor, an idiot or a madman, and he subjected me to any number of pompous lectures. Being averse to conflict, I meekly endured his pronouncements with an attitude that alternated between interest and exhaustion. It seemed he was Shibuta’s —Flounder’s—illegitimate son, but the situation was complicated and the connection not openly acknowledged. That Shibuta had never married may have been due in part to these complications. I seemed to recall hearing gossip to that effect when I was living at home but the affairs of others didn’t hold much interest for me, so I don’t know any of the details. Still, the set of the boy’s eyes did have something of the look of a fish about them, so perhaps he really was Flounder’s son. . . . If so, theirs was a cold and lonely relationship. Sometimes, they ordered soba noodles late at night and—without inviting me—ate in wordless silence."

自分は死ぬのは平気なんだけど、怪我をして出血してそうして不具者などになるのは、まっぴらごめんのほうですので、ヨシちゃんに腕の傷の手当をしてもらいながら、酒も、もういい加減によそうかしら、と思ったのです。,"I don't mind dying, but I'm sorry that I'm injured and bleeding and becoming a disabled person, so while having Yoshi-chan treat my arm wounds, I also drink alcohol. I wondered if it was a good idea.",I thought as I watched Yoshiko bandage my hand that I might cut down on my drinking.,"The thought of dying didn’t bother me in the slightest, but when it came to injuries, bleeding and the like, I wanted none of it. As she cleaned the cut on my arm I started to think that perhaps I really had better stop drinking."
そんな事では話にも何もならぬ、ちっとも気持がしっかりしていない、考えなさい、今夜一晩まじめに考えてみなさい、と言われ、自分は追われるように二階に上って、寝ても、別に何の考えも浮びませんでした。そうして、あけがたになり、ヒラメの家から逃げました。,"I was told that I couldn't talk about that, I wasn't feeling at all, think about it, think about it seriously tonight, and I went upstairs to be chased and slept. However, I didn't have any idea. Then, in the open, I ran away from the flatfish's house.","He said, ""There's no point in discussing such a thing. Your feelings are still all up in the air. Think it over. Please devote this evening to thinking it over seriously. "" I ran up to the second floor as though driven, but even when I lay in bed nothing of a particularly constructive nature occurred to me. The next morning at dawn I ran away from Flatfish's house. I left behind a note, scrawled in pencil in big letters on my writing pad.","No, no, no, that simply won’t do, you’re not showing the slightest determination, think it over, take the night, think it over carefully. Thus instructed I hurried back upstairs, as though chased. I lay awake in bed but nothing came to me. So, sometime around dawn, I ran away."
ヒラメの話方には、いや、世の中の全部の人の話方には、このようにややこしく、どこか朦朧もうろうとして、逃腰とでもいったみたいな微妙な複雑さがあり、そのほとんど無益と思われるくらいの厳重な警戒と、無数といっていいくらいの小うるさい駈引とには、いつも自分は当惑し、どうでもいいやという気分になって、お道化で茶化したり、または無言の首肯で一さいおまかせという、謂わば敗北の態度をとってしまうのでした。,"The way of speaking of flatfish, no, the way of speaking of all the people in the world is complicated like this, and there is a subtle complexity like trying to get rid of something, and it is almost useless. I was always embarrassed by the strict vigilance that seemed to me and the innumerable noisy flounders, and I felt like I didn't care about it. I took the so-called defeat attitude of leaving it to me.","Flatfish's manner of speech—no, not only his, but the manner of speech of everybody in the world—held strange, elusive complexities, intricately presented with overtones of vagueness: I have always been baffled by these precautions so strict as to be useless, and by the intensely irritating little maneuvers surrounding them. In the end I have felt past caring; I have laughed them away with my clowning, or surrendered to them abjectly with a silent nod of the head, in the attitude of defeat.","Flounder—but no, not just Flounder but everyone, or so it seemed to me—spoke with a vague, wary edge to his words and with an odd complexity, perhaps due to the liberal sprinkling of verbal loopholes. It seemed a pointless, excessive caution. His endless, petty, annoying rhetorical acrobatics never failed to confound me and I soon gave up trying to follow him, either using my clowning to treat it like a joke or just sitting there, nodding my head in a silent attitude of utter defeat and letting him have his way entirely."
「そう？　しかし、君には、わからないんだ。このままでは、僕は、逃げる事になるかも知れない」,"""Yes? But you don't know. At this rate, I may run away.""","""Is it? But you don't understand. I may run away if things go on at this rate.",". . .” “Is it, though? How can you tell? If things stay like this I might run off one of these days.”"
しかし、その時期のなつかしい思い出の中にも、たった一つ、冷汗三斗の、生涯わすれられぬ悲惨なしくじりがあったのです。自分は、検事局の薄暗い一室で、検事の簡単な取調べを受けました。検事は四十歳前後の物静かな、（もし自分が美貌だったとしても、それは謂いわば邪淫の美貌だったに違いありませんが、その検事の顔は、正しい美貌、とでも言いたいような、聡明な静謐せいひつの気配を持っていました）コセコセしない人柄のようでしたので、自分も全く警戒せず、ぼんやり陳述していたのですが、突然、れいの咳が出て来て、自分は袂からハンケチを出し、ふとその血を見て、この咳もまた何かの役に立つかも知れぬとあさましい駈引きの心を起し、ゴホン、ゴホンと二つばかり、おまけの贋にせの咳を大袈裟おおげさに附け加えて、ハンケチで口を覆ったまま検事の顔をちらと見た、間一髪、,"However, even in the nostalgic memories of that time, there was only one cold sweat, Santo, who had a miserable mischief that he would never forget. I was briefly interrogated by the prosecutor in a dimly lit room at the prosecutor's office. The prosecutor is quiet around the age of 40 (even if he is beautiful, it must have been a so-called wicked beauty, but the prosecutor's face is wise, as if he were right. I had a sign of tranquility.) I didn't seem to be sick, so I wasn't wary at all and made a vague statement, but suddenly a cough of Rei came out and I was out of my face. When I put out a handkerchief and suddenly saw the blood, I aroused a terrible prosecution that this cough might also be useful for something. In addition, I glanced at the prosecutor's face while covering my mouth with a handkerchief.","But among my otherwise nostalgic memories there is one harrowing disaster which I shall never be able to forget and which even now causes me to break out into a cold sweat. I was given a brief exanimation by the district attorney in his dimly lit office. He was a man of about forty, with an intelligent calm about him which I am tempted to call ""honest good looks"" (in contrast to my own alleged good looks which, even if true, certainly are tainted with lewdness). He seemed so simple and straightforward that I let down my guard completely. I was listlessly recounting my story when suddenly I was seized with another fit of coughing. I took out my handkerchief. The blood stains caught my eye, and with ignoble opportunism I thought that this cough might also prove useful. I added a couple of extra, exaggerated coughs for good measure and, my mouth still covered by the handkerchief, I glanced at the district attorney's face.","Yet, even among these fond recollections, there was one misstep. One mistake so mortifying that I broke out in a cold sweat, a blunder I will never forget so long as I live. I was brought to the prosecutor’s office—a dim, gloomy place—and underwent another, cursory interrogation. The prosecutor was a quiet man of about forty (if “beauty” had ever been ascribed to me, it was, I do not doubt, nothing more than a base, lascivious beauty. The prosecutor, however, had what can only be called a “virtuous beauty,” with its own aura of wisdom and tranquility). He didn’t seem the type to be bothered by trifles, and I let my guard down entirely. I was answering his questions with a distracted air when I had another fit of coughing. I pulled my handkerchief from my sleeve and, thinking that I might as well make use of the opportunity, devised a despicable scheme. I added two more exaggerated, wheezing coughs, glancing out of the corner of my eye as I pressed the handkerchief to my mouth."

学校は欠席するし、学科の勉強も、すこしもしなかったのに、それでも、妙に試験の答案に要領のいいところがあるようで、どうやらそれまでは、故郷の肉親をあざむき通して来たのですが、しかし、もうそろそろ、出席日数の不足など、学校のほうから内密に故郷の父へ報告が行っているらしく、父の代理として長兄が、いかめしい文章の長い手紙を、自分に寄こすようになっていたのでした。けれども、それよりも、自分の直接の苦痛は、金の無い事と、それから、れいの運動の用事が、とても遊び半分の気持では出来ないくらい、はげしく、いそがしくなって来た事でした。中央地区と言ったか、何地区と言ったか、とにかく本郷、小石川、下谷、神田、あの辺の学校全部の、マルクス学生の行動隊々長というものに、自分はなっていたのでした。武装蜂起ほうき、と聞き、小さいナイフを買い（いま思えば、それは鉛筆をけずるにも足りない、きゃしゃなナイフでした）それを、レンコオトのポケットにいれ、あちこち飛び廻って、所謂いわゆる「聯絡れんらく」をつけるのでした。お酒を飲んで、ぐっすり眠りたい、しかし、お金がありません。しかも、Ｐ（党の事を、そういう隠語で呼んでいたと記憶していますが、或いは、違っているかも知れません）のほうからは、次々と息をつくひまも無いくらい、用事の依頼がまいります。自分の病弱のからだでは、とても勤まりそうも無くなりました。もともと、非合法の興味だけから、そのグルウプの手伝いをしていたのですし、こんなに、それこそ冗談から駒が出たように、いやにいそがしくなって来ると、自分は、ひそかにＰのひとたちに、それはお門かどちがいでしょう、あなたたちの直系のものたちにやらせたらどうですか、というようないまいましい感を抱くのを禁ずる事が出来ず、逃げました。逃げて、さすがに、いい気持はせず、死ぬ事にしました。,"I was absent from school, and even though I didn't study in the department for a while, there still seemed to be a strange point in answering the exam, and apparently, until then, I had been sneering through my relatives in my hometown. However, it seems that the school is secretly reporting to his father in his hometown, such as the lack of attendance days, so that his elder brother should send a long letter with a stern sentence to himself on behalf of his father. It was. But more than that, my direct pain was that I had no money and that the errands of Rei's exercise became so intense and busy that I couldn't do it with a very playful feeling. Whatever district I called the central district, I was the leader of the Marx student action teams in Hongo, Koishikawa, Shitaya, Kanda, and all the schools in that area. When I heard that it was an armed uprising broom, I bought a small knife (I think it was a neat knife that wasn't enough to scratch a pencil), put it in Renkooto's pocket, and flew around, so-called ""unrelated entanglement"". ""Raku"" was added. I want to drink and sleep soundly, but I don't have the money. Moreover, P (I remember calling the party in such a jargon, or it may be different) asked for errands so much that I couldn't breathe one after another. Will come. With my sick body, I'm very unlikely to work. Originally, I was helping the group just because of my illegal interests, and when I became so busy, as if a piece came out of a joke, I secretly became a P person. I couldn't help but run away because I couldn't help but have a damn feeling, like, ""It's a joke, why don't you let your direct ones do it?"" I ran away, and as expected, I didn't feel good and decided to die.","I had stopped attending classes and no longer devoted a minute of study to my courses; amazingly enough I seemed nevertheless to be able to give sensible answers in the examinations, and I managed somehow to keep my family under the delusion that all was well. But my poor attendance finally caused the school to send my father a confidential report. My elder brother, acting on behalf of my father, thereupon addressed me a long, sternly phrased letter, warning me to change my ways. More pressing causes of grief to me were my lack of money and the jobs required of me by the movement, which had become so frequent and frenetic that I could no longer perform them half in the spirit of fun. I had been chosen leader of all the Marxist student action groups in the schools of central Tokyo. I raced about here and there ""maintaining liaison. "" In my raincoat pocket I carried a little knife I had bought for use in the event of an armed uprising. (I remember now that it had a delicate blade hardly strong enough to sharpen a pencil.) My fondest wish was to drink myself into a sound stupor, but I hadn't the money. Requests for my services came from the party so frequently that I scarcely had time to catch my breath. A sickly body like mine wasn't up to such frantic activity. My only reason all along for helping the group had been my fascination with its irrationality, and to become so horribly involved was a quite unforeseen consequence of my joke. I felt secretly like telling the group, ""This isn't my business. Why don't you get a regular party man to do it? "" Unable to suppress such reactions of annoyance, I escaped. I escaped, but it gave me no pleasure: I decided to kill myself.","I skipped all my classes and never studied for any of my subjects, but I seemed to have an odd knack for exams so, one way or another, I was able to maintain the deception with my parents. However, unbeknownst to me, the school had contacted my parents directly, telling them that I would soon surpass the limit for absenteeism. Soon, at Father’s direction, my eldest brother started sending me long letters full of stern warnings. Yet, what really troubled me—far more than school—was my lack of funds and the fact that my work for the movement had gotten so demanding I could no longer treat it as a joke. I’d been promoted to the head of the Marxist Student Corps for the Central District or something like that. In any case, I was in charge of Hongō, Koishikawa, Shitaya, Kanda, and all the surrounding areas. People started talking about an armed uprising, so I bought a small pocketknife (thinking back on it, it was such a flimsy thing I doubt it would’ve served to sharpen a pencil) and took to carrying it about in the pocket of my raincoat as I ran about town making “contacts.” All I wanted to do was get drunk and sleep like the dead, but I didn’t have any money. And the “P” (that was our code word for the party. Or at least I think it was— I may be mistaken) kept sending me out on mission after mission, never giving me enough time to catch my breath. Given my delicate health it was highly unlikely I’d be able to keep it up for much longer. I’d only started in the movement because I was attracted to the “illicit,” so I couldn’t help feeling annoyed when it began to occupy so much of my time. Privately, I came to the conclusion they’d picked the wrong person for the job and should give it to one of their true believers instead. So I ran away. As you might expect, that didn’t make me feel very good, and I resolved to die."

しかし、自分は、人間への恐怖からのがれ、幽かな一夜の休養を求めるために、そこへ行き、それこそ自分と「同類」の淫売婦たちと遊んでいるうちに、いつのまにやら無意識の、或るいまわしい雰囲気を身辺にいつもただよわせるようになった様子で、これは自分にも全く思い設けなかった所謂「おまけの附録」でしたが、次第にその「附録」が、鮮明に表面に浮き上って来て、堀木にそれを指摘せられ、愕然がくぜんとして、そうして、いやな気が致しました。はたから見て、俗な言い方をすれば、自分は、淫売婦に依って女の修行をして、しかも、最近めっきり腕をあげ、女の修行は、淫売婦に依るのが一ばん厳しく、またそれだけに効果のあがるものだそうで、既に自分には、あの、「女達者」という匂いがつきまとい、女性は、（淫売婦に限らず）本能に依ってそれを嗅ぎ当て寄り添って来る、そのような、卑猥ひわいで不名誉な雰囲気を、「おまけの附録」としてもらって、そうしてそのほうが、自分の休養などよりも、ひどく目立ってしまっているらしいのでした。,"However, I went there to escape from fear of humans and seek a mysterious night's rest, and while playing with myself and ""kind"" lewd women, I was unconscious. It seems that a certain damn atmosphere has always come to my mind, and this was a so-called ""extra appendix"" that I never thought of, but gradually that ""appendix"" clearly appeared on the surface. When I came up and was pointed out by Horiki, I was shocked and unpleasant. Seen from the outside, to put it in a profane way, I practiced a woman by a lewd woman, and recently I improved my skills, and the training of a woman is the most strict depending on a lewd woman. Also, it seems that it will be effective only for that, and I already have the smell of ""female"", and women (not limited to lewd women) sniff it by instinct and snuggle up, like that. It seems that the obscene and disgraceful atmosphere was given as a ""bonus appendix"", and that it was more noticeable than my own rest.","I went to them to escape from my dread of human beings, to seek a mere night of repose, but in the process of diverting myself with these ""kindred"" prostitutes, I seem to have acquired before I was aware of it a certain offensive atmosphere which clung inseparably to me. This was a quite unexpected by-product of my experience, but gradually it became more manifest, until Horiki pointed it out, to my amazement and consternation. I had, quite objectively speaking, passed through an apprenticeship in women at the hands of prostitutes, and I had of late become quite adept. The severest apprenticeship in women, they say, is with prostitutes, and that makes it the most effective. The odor of the ""lady-killer"" had come to permeate me, and women (not only prostitutes) instinctively detected it and flocked to me. This obscene and inglorious atmosphere was the ""bonus"" I received, and it was apparently far more noticeable than the recuperative effects of my apprenticeship.","It was, I suppose, a kind of “gift” that prostitutes bestowed on a favored customer, though not one I had expected to receive. The contours of this gift gradually became visible and grew increasingly distinct so that, when Horiki finally pointed it out to me, I was both astonished and, I must admit, disgusted. To put it in objective though somewhat vulgar terms, the whores had been training me. They had been teaching me how to interact with women. Worse still, being prostitutes, they were relentless when it came to the study of this particular field, and their training had already effected quite a change in me. I’d become quite the adept.

それっきり、一言も口をきかずに、自分はその薬屋から出て、よろめいてアパートに帰り、ヨシ子に塩水を作らせて飲み、黙って寝て、翌る日も、風邪気味だと噓をついて一日一ぱい寝て、夜、自分の秘密の喀血がどうにも不安でたまらず、起きて、あの薬屋に行き、こんどは笑いながら、奥さんに、実に素直に今迄のからだ具合いを告白し、相談しました。,"Without saying a word, I got out of the drugstore, staggered back to my apartment, had Yoshiko make salt water, drank it, slept silently, and the next day I had a cold.

I had Yoshiko make me a glass of salt water and, drinking it down, went to bed without a word. The next morning I lied and said that I felt a cold coming on so I could spend the day in bed. By the time night fell, I had grown so anxious I could endure it no longer and I went back to the pharmacy, this time smiling as I explained my condition in detail and asked the woman for advice."

自分は、金持ちの家に生れたという事よりも、俗にいう「できる」事に依って、学校中の尊敬を得そうになりました。自分は、子供の頃から病弱で、よく一つき二つき、また一学年ちかくも寝込んで学校を休んだ事さえあったのですが、それでも、病み上りのからだで人力車に乗って学校へ行き、学年末の試験を受けてみると、クラスの誰よりも所謂「できて」いるようでした。からだ具合いのよい時でも、自分は、さっぱり勉強せず、学校へ行っても授業時間に漫画などを書き、休憩時間にはそれをクラスの者たちに説明して聞かせて、笑わせてやりました。また、綴り方には、滑稽噺こっけいばなしばかり書き、先生から注意されても、しかし、自分は、やめませんでした。先生は、実はこっそり自分のその滑稽噺を楽しみにしている事を自分は、知っていたからでした。或る日、自分は、れいに依って、自分が母に連れられて上京の途中の汽車で、おしっこを客車の通路にある痰壺たんつぼにしてしまった失敗談（しかし、その上京の時に、自分は痰壺と知らずにしたのではありませんでした。子供の無邪気をてらって、わざと、そうしたのでした）を、ことさらに悲しそうな筆致で書いて提出し、先生は、きっと笑うという自信がありましたので、職員室に引き揚げて行く先生のあとを、そっとつけて行きましたら、先生は、教室を出るとすぐ、自分のその綴り方を、他のクラスの者たちの綴り方の中から選び出し、廊下を歩きながら読みはじめて、クスクス笑い、やがて職員室にはいって読み終えたのか、顔を真赤にして大声を挙げて笑い、他の先生に、さっそくそれを読ませているのを見とどけ、自分は、たいへん満足でした。,"I was more likely to gain the respect of the school because of what I could do, rather than being born in a rich family. I've been sick since I was a kid, and I often went to school one or two, and even fell asleep for the first grade and took a break from school. When I took the exam at the end of the school year, I seemed to be more so-called ""made"" than anyone else in the class. Even when I was feeling well, I didn't study at all, and even when I went to school, I wrote manga during class time, and during breaks I explained it to the classmates and made them laugh. .. Also, I wrote only humorous comic storytelling in the spelling method, and even though the teacher warned me, I did not stop. The teacher knew that he was actually secretly looking forward to that humorous story. One day, due to Rei, I was taken by my mother to a train on the way to Tokyo, and I made a spittoon in the passage of a passenger car. I didn't know it was a spittoon. I did it on purpose because of my child's innocence.) I wrote it in a more sad brushstroke and submitted it, and the teacher was confident that he would laugh. So, when I gently followed the teacher who was pulling up to the staff room, the teacher chose his spittoon from the spittoons of other class members as soon as he left the classroom. I started reading while walking in the corridor, laughing, laughing, and maybe I went into the staff room and finished reading, I turned my face red and laughed out loud, and I saw another teacher reading it at once. I was very happy.","I acquired my reputation at school less because I was the son of a rich family than because, in the vulgar parlance, I had ""brains."" Being a sickly child, I often missed school for a month or two or even a whole school year at a stretch. Nevertheless, when I returned to school, still convalescent and in a rickshaw, and took the examinations at the end of the year, I was always first in my class, thanks to my ""brains. "" I never studied, even when I was well. During recitation time at school I would draw cartoons and in the recess periods I made the other children in the class laugh with the explanations to my drawings. In the composition class I wrote nothing but funny stories. My teacher admonished me, but that didn't make me stop, for I knew that he secretly enjoyed my stories. One day I submitted a story written in a particularly doleful style recounting how when I was taken by my mother on the train to Tokyo, I had made water in a spittoon in the corridor. (But at the time I had not been ignorant that it was a spittoon; I deliberately made my blunder, pretending a childish innocence.) I was so sure that the teacher would laugh that I stealthily followed him to the staff room. As soon as he left the classroom the teacher pulled out my composition from the stack written by my classmates. He began to read as he walked down the hall, and was soon snickering. He went into the staff room and a minute or so later—was it when he finished it?—he burst into loud guffaws, his face scarlet with laughter. I watched him press my paper on the other teachers. I felt very pleased with myself.","I was in danger of being respected less because I came from a wealthy family than because I was, as they say, “brainy.” I was a sickly child, so it wasn’t unusual for me to miss a month or two of school at a time, confined to my bed. Once I missed nearly an entire year of classes. Yet, when the year came to an end I’d ride to school in a rickshaw and take my exams where, still weak from my illness, I’d score at the top of my class. Even when I wasn’t sick I never studied and spent all my time in class drawing cartoons. I showed them to my classmates during recess, narrating as I went and making everyone roar with laughter. When we had to write compositions I always wrote funny stories, even when the teachers told me not to. I knew they secretly looked forward to them. One day I handed in a story, written in a tragic vein, about how I took a train to Tokyo with Mother and, mistaking the spittoon in the corridor for a chamber pot, peed in it by mistake. (I knew it was a spittoon all along. I only did it to make a show of my “childlike innocence.”) Certain it would make the teacher laugh, I snuck out of the classroom as soon as he left and followed at a distance as he walked down the hallway. As soon as he was outside of the classroom he pulled my composition out from among my classmates’ and, reading as he walked, began to chuckle. He stepped into the teachers’ office and, no doubt having reached the end of the story, burst out laughing, tears streaming from his eyes. I saw him pass the story around to the other teachers. I could not have been more satisfied with the result."

(The shopping was really bad taste, and I usually did it right away to my sister's relatives, etc.) With a happy face and joking. Make me laugh, one summer night I can't leave, so in the dark of the city, I just wanted the person to go home, and if I kissed him, I was terribly excited like a frenzy, calling a car, and the people I took him to a small Western-style room like the office of a building that seems to have been secretly rented for exercise, and it was a fuss until the morning, and I secretly smiled that he was a ridiculous sister.","Wincing at the affectation I would answer, ""I do,"" and force a sad little smile. I was afraid of angering her, and my only thought was to temporize somehow and put her off. As a result, I spent more and more time dancing attendance on that ugly, disagreeable girl. I let her buy me presents (they were without exception in extraordinarily bad taste and I usually disposed of them immediately to the postman or the grocery boy). I tried to look happy when I was with her, and made her laugh with my jokes. One summer evening she simply wouldn't leave me. In the hope of persuading her to go I kissed her when we came to a dark place along the street. She became uncontrollably, shamefully excited. She hailed a taxi and took me to the little room the movement secretly rented in an office building. There we spent the whole night in a wild tumult.","I could only reply, “Of course I will,” forcing my face into a faint, melancholy smile. I mustn’t make her angry, I thought, frightened. I had to distract her somehow. I became so focused on placating this ugly, disagreeable woman that I soon found myself entertaining her. I tried to make her laugh with my jokes, and when she bought me presents (they were always in the worst possible taste, and I gave most of them away to people like the old man running the yakitori stall) I forced myself to feign delight. One summer night when she simply wouldn’t leave me alone, I led her into a dark alley and kissed her in the hope it would make her go home. Instead, she grew wild with excitement, and, overcome by a crude madness, hailed a taxi to take us to one of the tiny offices the movement rented secretly, where we raised quite the racket until dawn. I smiled wryly as I wondered just what kind of elder sister she thought herself to be."

堀木は、また、その見栄坊みえぼうのモダニティから、（堀木の場合、それ以外の理由は、自分には今もって考えられませんのですが）或る日、自分を共産主義の読書会とかいう（Ｒ・Ｓとかいっていたか、記憶がはっきり致しません）そんな、秘密の研究会に連れて行きました。堀木などという人物にとっては、共産主義の秘密会合も、れいの「東京案内」の一つくらいのものだったのかも知れません。自分は所謂「同志」に紹介せられ、パンフレットを一部買わされ、そうして上座のひどい醜い顔の青年から、マルクス経済学の講義を受けました。しかし、自分には、それはわかり切っている事のように思われました。それは、そうに違いないだろうけれども、人間の心には、もっとわけのわからない、おそろしいものがある。慾、と言っても、言いたりない、ヴァニティ、と言っても、言いたりない、色と慾、とこう二つ並べても、言いたりない、何だか自分にもわからぬが、人間の世の底に、経済だけでない、へんに怪談じみたものがあるような気がして、その怪談におびえ切っている自分には、所謂唯物論を、水の低きに流れるように自然に肯定しながらも、しかし、それに依って、人間に対する恐怖から解放せられ、青葉に向って眼をひらき、希望のよろこびを感ずるなどという事は出来ないのでした。けれども、自分は、いちども欠席せずに、そのＲ・Ｓ（と言ったかと思いますが、間違っているかも知れません）なるものに出席し、「同志」たちが、いやに一大事の如く、こわばった顔をして、一プラス一は二、というような、ほとんど初等の算術めいた理論の研究にふけっているのが滑稽に見えてたまらず、れいの自分のお道化で、会合をくつろがせる事に努め、そのためか、次第に研究会の窮屈な気配もほぐれ、自分はその会合に無くてかなわぬ人気者という形にさえなって来たようでした。この、単純そうな人たちは、自分の事を、やはりこの人たちと同じ様に単純で、そうして、楽天的なおどけ者の「同志」くらいに考えていたかも知れませんが、もし、そうだったら、自分は、この人たちを一から十まで、あざむいていたわけです。自分は、同志では無かったんです。けれども、その会合に、いつも欠かさず出席して、皆にお道化のサーヴィスをして来ました。,"Horiki also called himself a communist reading group one day (in the case of Horiki, I still can't think of any other reason) because of his modernity. (I don't remember if it was called RS) I took him to such a secret study group. For a person such as Horiki, the communist secret meeting may have been one of Rei's ""Tokyo Guide."" I was introduced to the so-called ""comrades"", bought some pamphlets, and then took a lecture on Marxian economics from a young man with a terrible ugly face in Kamiza. But to me, it seemed obvious. That must be the case, but there is something more incomprehensible and terrifying in the human mind. Even if I say 慾, I don't say it, I say vanity, I don't say it, I don't say it, I don't say it even if I put two of them side by side, I don't know what it is, but at the bottom of the human world I feel that there is something strange about the ghost story, not just the economy, and for myself who is scared of the ghost story, I naturally affirm the so-called materialism as if it flows to the low water. However, it was not possible to be released from the fear of human beings, to open the eyes toward Aoba, and to feel the joy of hope. However, I never absent and attended the RS (I think I said it, but it may be wrong), and the ""comrades"" seemed to be very important. It seemed ridiculous to be indulging in the study of almost elementary arithmetic theories, such as having a stiff face and one plus one being two, and meeting with Rei's own clown. Perhaps because of that, the cramped signs of the study group gradually eased, and it seemed that I was even becoming a popular person who could not be found at the meeting. These seemingly simple people might have thought of themselves as as simple as these people, and thus as the ""comrades"" of optimistic idiots, but if If so, I was mocking these people from one to ten. I wasn't a comrade. However, I have always attended the meeting and served clowns to everyone.","To show off his ""modernity"" (I can't think of any other reason) Horiki also took me one day to a secret Communist meeting. (I don't remember exactly what it was called—a ""Reading Society,"" I think.) A secret Communist meeting may have been for Horiki just one more of the sights of Tokyo. I was introduced to the ""comrades"" and obliged to buy a pamphlet. I then heard a lecture on Marxian economics delivered by an extraordinarily ugly young man, the guest of honor. Everything he said seemed exceedingly obvious, and undoubtedly true, but I felt sure that something more obscure, more frightening lurked in the hearts of human beings. Greed did not cover it, nor did vanity. Nor was it simply a combination of lust and greed. I wasn't sure what it was, but I felt that there was something inexplicable at the bottom of human society which was not reducible to economics. Terrified as I was by this weird element, I assented to materialism as naturally as water finding its own level. But materialism could not free me from my dread of human beings; I could not feel the joy of hope a man experiences when he opens his eyes on young leaves. Nevertheless I regularly attended the meetings of the Reading Society. I found it uproariously amusing to see my ""comrades,"" their faces tense as though they were discussing matters of life and death, absorbed in the study of theories so elementary they were on the order of ""one and one makes two. "" I tried to take some of the strain out of the meetings with my usual antics. That was why, I imagine, the oppressive atmosphere of the group gradually relaxed. I came to be so popular that I was considered indispensable at the meetings. These simple people perhaps fancied that I was just as simple as they—an optimistic, laughter-loving comrade—but if such was their view, I was deceiving them completely. I was not their comrade. Yet I attended every single meeting and performed for them my full repertory of farce.","One day, perhaps thinking to appear fashionably modern (being Horiki, it is difficult to imagine any other reason), Horiki took me to a secret gathering, a kind of communist reading group (I think they called it the “R-S” but my memory is vague). For Horiki, this kind of thing was no doubt nothing more than another stop on his “grand tour of Tokyo.” I was introduced to the “comrades,” forced to buy some pamphlets, and then subjected to a lecture on Marxist economics by the leader of the group, a young man with a profoundly ugly face. I couldn’t help but think that everything they said was nothing more than common sense. It was true enough, but there is more to the human soul than just that. There is also something incomprehensible, something terrifying. Desire is too weak a word for it, as is vanity. Even if we combine Eros and desire it’s still not quite enough. I’m not sure myself what it is, but I am certain that the foundation of human society is not economics. It’s something more, with the uncanny air of a strange and scary folk tale. Living in abject terror of that strange folk tale as I did, I was able to accept theories of materialism as easily as I accepted the fact that water runs downhill, but these theories did not liberate me from my dread of humans , they did not arouse in me a sense of joy or the hopefulness of a man whose eyes have been opened to the newly sprouted, green leaves of spring. Nevertheless, I attended every single meeting of the “R-S” (again, I think that was the name but I may be mistaken). It was all I could do not to burst out laughing at their debates. They were all so tense and grave as they became engrossed in their absurd, obvious attempts to demonstrate the theoretical equivalent of one and one making, in fact, two. I used my clowning to try to make the meetings a bit more relaxed, and, perhaps as a result, the atmosphere did grow a bit less stuffy. I was soon so popular I’d become an indispensable member of the group. These naive people must have taken me for one of their own, a naive youth like them. A happy-go-lucky, clowning “comrade.” If so, they were deceived from start to finish. I was not their comrade. Still, I attended every meeting without fail, entertaining all with my antics."

自分は、彼を手なずけるため、まず、顔に偽クリスチャンのような「優しい」媚笑びしょうを湛たたえ、首を三十度くらい左に曲げて、彼の小さい肩を軽く抱き、そうして猫撫ねこなで声に似た甘ったるい声で、彼を自分の寄宿している家に遊びに来るようしばしば誘いましたが、彼は、いつも、ぼんやりした眼つきをして、黙っていました。しかし、自分は、或る日の放課後、たしか初夏の頃の事でした、夕立ちが白く降って、生徒たちは帰宅に困っていたようでしたが、自分は家がすぐ近くなので平気で外へ飛び出そうとして、ふと下駄箱のかげに、竹一がしょんぼり立っているのを見つけ、行こう、傘を貸してあげる、と言い、臆する竹一の手を引っぱって、一緒に夕立ちの中を走り、家に着いて、二人の上衣を小母さんに乾かしてもらうようにたのみ、竹一を二階の自分の部屋に誘い込むのに成功しました。,"To tame him, he first put a fake Christian-like ""gentle"" laugh on his face, bent his neck about thirty degrees to the left, and lightly hugged his little shoulder. Then, with a sweet voice that resembled a cat-stroking voice, he often invited him to come to his boarding house, but he always had a vague look and kept silent. I was there. However, one day after school, it was probably early summer, when the evening sun fell white and the students seemed to have trouble returning home, but since I was close to my house, I was fine and went outside. As I was about to jump out, I suddenly found Takeichi standing behind the clogs box, and said, ""Let's go, I'll lend you an umbrella."" I got home and asked my mom to dry their coats, and I succeeded in inviting Takeichi to my room on the second floor.","In order to win over Takeichi I clothed my face in the gentle beguiling smile of the false Christian. I strolled everywhere with him, my arm lightly around his scrawny shoulders, my head tilted affectionately towards him. I frequently would invite him in honeyed, cajoling tones to come and play in the house where I was lodging. But instead of an answer he always gave me only blank stares in return. One day after school was let out—it must have been in the early summer—there was a sudden downpour. The other students were making a great fuss about getting back to their lodgings, but since I lived just around the corner, I decided to make a dash for it. Ju6t as I was about to rush outside, I noticed Takeichi hovering dejectedly in the entrance way. I said, ""Let's go. I'll lend you my umbrella. "" I grabbed Takeichi'a hand as he hesitated, and ran out with him into the rain. When we arrived home I nuked my aunt to dry our jackets. I had succeeded in luring Takeichi to my room.","In my quest to tame Takeichi I put on a “benevolent” grin, not unlike the smile of a fake Christian, and, head tilted to the left, I gently clasped his thin shoulder, inviting him to come to my house to play, my voice soothing, honeyed. He merely looked back at me in vacant silence. But then one day, near the start of summer I think, a sudden downpour turned the air white with rain just as classes ended, and everyone was milling about near the exit, wondering what to do. I lived just next door so the rain didn’t bother me, and, just as I was about to make a run for it , I noticed Takeichi standing disconsolately in the shadows by the shoe locker. Come on, I’ll lend you my umbrella, I grabbed his hand even as he flinched from me, pulling him out into the rain and running to my house. After asking my aunt to dry our jackets, I succeeded in getting Takeichi to visit my room on the second floor."

堀木は、大きい咳せきばらいをしました。自分は、ひとり逃げるようにまた屋上に駈け上り、寝ころび、雨を含んだ夏の夜空を仰ぎ、そのとき自分を襲った感情は、怒りでも無く、嫌悪でも無く、また、悲しみでも無く、もの凄すさまじい恐怖でした。それも、墓地の幽霊などに対する恐怖ではなく、神社の杉木立で白衣の御神体に逢った時に感ずるかも知れないような、四の五の言わさぬ古代の荒々しい恐怖感でした。自分の若白髪は、その夜からはじまり、いよいよ、すべてに自信を失い、いよいよ、ひとを底知れず疑い、この世の営みに対する一さいの期待、よろこび、共鳴などから永遠にはなれるようになりました。実に、それは自分の生涯に於いて、決定的な事件でした。自分は、まっこうから眉間みけんを割られ、そうしてそれ以来その傷は、どんな人間にでも接近する毎に痛むのでした。,"Horiki had a big cough. I ran up to the roof again to escape alone, lay down, and looked up at the summer night sky including rain, and the emotions that hit me at that time were neither anger nor disgust, nor sadness, and terrible. I was scared. It wasn't a fear of ghosts in the graveyard, but a violent and unspeakable ancient horror that you might feel when you met the god of white robe at the shrine's cemetery. My young white hair started from that night, and finally I lost confidence in everything, and finally I doubted people, and I became forever free from all the expectations, joys, resonances, etc. of the world's activities. .. Indeed, it was a decisive event in my life. I had my glabellar cracked from the bottom, and since then the wound has hurt every time I approach any human being.","Horiki noisily cleared his throat. I ran back up to the roof to escape and collapsed there. The feelings which assailed me as I looked up at the summer night sky heavy with rain were not of fury or hatred, nor even of sadness. They were of overpowering fear, not the terror the sight of ghosts in a graveyard might arouse, but rather a fierce ancestral dread that could not be expressed in four or five words, something perhaps like encountering in the sacred grove of a Shinto shrine the white-clothed body of the god. My hair turned prematurely grey from that night. I had now lost all confidence in myself, doubted all men immeasurably, and abandoned all hopes for the things of this world, all joy, all sympathy, eternally. This was truly the decisive incident of my life. I had been split through the forehead between the eyebrows, a wound that was to throb with pain whenever I came in contact with a human being.","Horiki cleared his throat loudly. I fled, springing up the stairs to the roof where I threw myself down, face to the drizzling summer night. What I felt then was not rage, hatred, or even sadness but rather an overpowering terror. It was not the terror of a ghost in a graveyard. It was the terror of encountering a spirit, clad all in white, amid the towering cedars of a Shintō shrine. A ferocious, ancient terror that robbed me of speech. My hair began to turn gray that night. I lost confidence in everything. I was suspicious of everyone. I was forever alienated from all notions of hope, sympathy, or joy in the workings of the world. This was truly a decisive moment in my life. It was as though my head had been split open and, from that moment on, any interaction whatsoever with human beings caused that wound to throb."

また一方、自分は、下男や下女たちを洋室に集めて、下男のひとりに滅茶苦茶めちゃくちゃにピアノのキイをたたかせ、（田舎ではありましたが、その家には、たいていのものが、そろっていました）自分はその出鱈目でたらめの曲に合せて、インデヤンの踊りを踊って見せて、皆を大笑いさせました。次兄は、フラッシュを焚たいて、自分のインデヤン踊りを撮影して、その写真が出来たのを見ると、自分の腰布（それは更紗さらさの風呂敷でした）の合せ目から、小さいおチンポが見えていたので、これがまた家中の大笑いでした。自分にとって、これまた意外の成功というべきものだったかも知れません。,"On the other hand, I gathered the younger men and the younger girls in a Western-style room and made one of the younger men mess up the piano key (although it was in the countryside, most of the things in the house). However, I made everyone laugh by dancing the Indeyan dance to the random song. My second brother fired a flash, took a picture of his Indeyan dance, and when he saw the picture, he saw a small cock from the seam of his waist cloth (it was a chintz furoshiki). I could see it, so this was another big laugh all over the house. It may have been a surprising success for me.","On another occasion I assembled all our men and women servants in the foreign-style room. I got one of the menservants to bang at random on the keys of the piano (our house was well equipped with most amenities even though we were in the country), and I made everyone roar with laughter by cavorting in a wild Indian dance to his hit and miss tune. My brother took a flashbulb photograph' of me performing my dance. When the picture was developed you could see my peepee through the opening between the two handkerchiefs which served for a loincloth, and this too occasioned much merriment. It was perhaps to be accounted a triumph which surpassed my own expectations.","Another time I gathered all the maids and servants into our Western-style room and had one of the servants pound away on the piano (we may have been out in the country but we possessed all the accoutrements of a respectable household) as I ran around in circles, whooping in an Indian dance and making everyone laugh. One of my older brothers got his camera out and took a photograph of me. When the photo was developed you could see my tiny weenie peeking out from between the folds of the loincloth (I’d worn a thin, calico cloth typically used for wrapping packages) and this only served to bring the whole household down in gales of laughter yet again. I suppose that this too qualifies as one of my surprising successes."
長兄は自分に対する約束を正確に実行してくれました。自分の生れて育った町から汽車で四、五時間、南下したところに、東北には珍らしいほど暖かい海辺の温泉地があって、その村はずれの、間数は五つもあるのですが、かなり古い家らしく壁は剝はげ落ち、柱は虫に食われ、ほとんど修理の仕様も無いほどの茅屋ぼうおくを買いとって自分に与え、六十に近いひどい赤毛の醜い女中をひとり附けてくれました。,"My elder brother fulfilled his promise to me exactly. Four or five hours by train south of the town where I was born and raised, there is an unusually warm seaside hot spring resort in Tohoku, and there are five on the outskirts of that village. Like a fairly old house, the walls were peeled off, the pillars were eaten by insects, and I bought a thatched roof that had almost no repair specifications and gave it to myself, with an ugly maid with a terrible redhead close to sixty. Gave me.","My brother scrupulously carried out his promise. He bought a house for me at a hot spring on the coast, about four or five hours journey by rail south of the town where I grew up , an unusually warm spot for that part of Japan. The house, a thatch-covered rather ancient-looking structure, stood on the outskirts of the village. It had five rooms. The walls were peeled and the woodwork was so worm-eaten as to seem almost beyond all possibility of repair. My brother also sent to look after me an ugly woman close to sixty with horrible rusty hair. * * *","My brother was true to his word and did all that he promised. Four or five hours south of my hometown by train there is a hot springs region near the sea that is unusually warm for northeast Japan. He bought me a house on the outskirts of a small village there.

He also provided me with a servant, an ugly woman of almost sixty years with horrible rust-colored hair. I’ve been here a little more than three years now and have been subjected to any number of odd violations by that old servant, Tetsu."

自分があの京橋のスタンド・バアのマダムの義俠心ぎきょうしんにすがり、（女のひとの義俠心なんて、言葉の奇妙な遣い方ですが、しかし、自分の経験に依ると、少くとも都会の男女の場合、男よりも女のほうが、その、義俠心とでもいうべきものをたっぷりと持っていました。男はたいてい、おっかなびっくりで、おていさいばかり飾り、そうして、ケチでした）あの煙草屋のヨシ子を内縁の妻にする事が出来て、そうして築地つきじ、隅田川の近く、木造の二階建ての小さいアパートの階下の一室を借り、ふたりで住み、酒は止めて、そろそろ自分の定った職業になりかけて来た漫画の仕事に精を出し、夕食後は二人で映画を見に出かけ、帰りには、喫茶店などにはいり、また、花の鉢を買ったりして、いや、それよりも自分をしんから信頼してくれているこの小さい花嫁の言葉を聞き、動作を見ているのが楽しく、これは自分もひょっとしたら、いまにだんだん人間らしいものになる事が出来て、悲惨な死に方などせずにすむのではなかろうかという甘い思いを幽かに胸にあたためはじめていた矢先に、堀木がまた自分の眼前に現われました。,"I cling to Madame's righteousness at Stand Baa in Kyobashi (a woman's righteousness is a strange way of using words, but according to my experience, at least in the city. In the case of men and women, women had more of that, what could be called a human spirit, than men. Men were usually surprised, gracefully decorated, and then stingy. ) I was able to make Yoshiko, the smoker, the wife of the inner rim, so I rented a room downstairs in a small wooden two-story apartment near Tsukiji Tsukiji, Sumida River, lived together, and stopped drinking. After dinner, we went out to watch a movie together, and on the way back, we went to a coffee shop and bought a pot of flowers. And, no, it's more fun to hear the words of this little bride who trusts herself and watch her movements, which is probably more and more human. Horiki reappeared in front of me at the point where I was beginning to feel the sweet feeling that I might not have to die miserably.","I threw myself on the chivalry of the madam of the bar in Kyobashi. (It is a strange use of the word to speak of a woman's chivalry, but in my experience, at least in the cities, the women possessed a greater abundance of what might be termed chivalry than the men. Most men concerned themselves, all fear and trembling, only with appearances, and were stingy to boot.) She enabled me to marry Yoshiko and to rent a room on the ground floor of an apartment building near the Sumida River which we made our home. I gave up drink and devoted my energies to drawing cartoons. After dinner we would go out together to see a movie, and on the way back we would stop at a milk bar or buy pots of flowers. But more than any of these things it gave me pleasure just to listen to the words or watch the movements of my little bride, who trusted in me with all her heart. Then, just when I had begun to entertain faintly in my breast the sweet notion that perhaps there was a chance I might turn one of these days into a human being and be spared the necessity of a horrible death, Horiki showed up again.","then Horiki and I were the epitome of “friends.” Thanks entirely to the chivalry of the Madam from Kyōbashi (it may sound odd to speak of chivalry in a woman but experience has taught me—at least in the city—that women possess the quality of what I can only call chivalry in far greater quantities than men. Men, as a rule, are cowardly, trembling creatures who care for nothing but appearances and are stingy to boot), I succeeded in making Yoshiko my common-law wife. We rented a small room in eastern Tokyo on the first floor of a tiny two-story apartment in Tsukiji, near the Sumida River. I quit drinking and dedicated myself to what was, it seemed, becoming my chosen path—cartoons. After dinner we went to the movies and on the way home stopped at a coffee shop or bought a flower pot and so on. More than anything, I loved to simply listen to her and to gaze at her, this woman who trusted me to the very core of her being. It was around then that I started to think that I might, just possibly, be turning into something that resembled a human being. I began to feel a faint, warm hope that I might avoid a miserable death after all, when Horiki reappeared at my doorstep."

I was very familiar with Dr. Monja and others, and I was also quite familiar with ghost stories, storytelling, rakugo, Edo Rakugo Kobanashi, etc. There was nothing short of making the people of the house laugh.","I used to subscribe regularly to a dozen or more children's magazines and for my private reading ordered books of all sorts from Tokyo.

I took it out and ran away, but my husband was in jail in Tokyo without doing a decent job and was accused of fraud. Although he was there, he said that he would stop tomorrow, but he wasn't interested in what it was like, the story of a woman's body, and that was how she talked. Maybe it's because I'm not good at it, that is, because I put the emphasis on the story wrongly, anyway, I always had a horse-eared easterly style.","As we lay there together, she told me that she was two years older than I, and that she came from Hiroshima.

She rambled on, but I have never been able to get interested when women talk about themselves. It may be because women are so inept at telling a story (that is, because they place the emphasis in the wrong places), or for some other reason.

それが、堀木に財布を渡して一緒に歩くと、堀木は大いに値切って、しかも遊び上手というのか、わずかなお金で最大の効果のあるような支払い振りを発揮し、また、高い円タクは敬遠して、電車、バス、ポンポン蒸気など、それぞれ利用し分けて、最短時間で目的地へ着くという手腕をも示し、淫売婦のところから朝帰る途中には、何々という料亭に立ち寄って朝風呂へはいり、湯豆腐で軽くお酒を飲むのが、安い割に、ぜいたくな気分になれるものだと実地教育をしてくれたり、その他、屋台の牛めし焼とりの安価にして滋養に富むものたる事を説き、酔いの早く発するのは、電気ブランの右に出るものはないと保証し、とにかくその勘定に就いては自分に、一つも不安、恐怖を覚えさせた事がありませんでした。,"However, when I handed my wallet to Horiki and walked with him, Horiki was a great bargain, and he was a good player. Then, he showed his skill to reach the destination in the shortest time by using each of the train, bus, pompon steam, etc., and on the way back from the lewd woman in the morning, he stopped by some restaurants and took a morning bath. Yes, drinking lightly with Yudofu is cheap, but it gives you practical education that you can feel luxurious, and other things that are cheap and nourishing for grilling beef meals at food stalls. I assured that there was nothing like Denki Bran to get sick early, and I never made myself feel anxious or scared about that account anyway.","So I turned my money over to Horiki and the two of us went out together. He was a great bargainer and—this perhaps earned him the ranking of expert in pleasure-seeking—he displayed unusual proficiency in spending minimal sums of money with maximum effect. His talents extended to getting wherever he wanted in the shortest possible time without ever having recourse to taxis: he used by turns, as seemed appropriate, the streetcar, the bus and even steam launches in the river. He gave me a practical education: thus, if we stopped in the morning at a certain restaurant on our way home from a prostitute's and had a bath with our meal, it was a cheap way of experiencing the sensation of living luxuriously. He also explained that beef with rice or skewered chicken —the sort of dishes you can get at a roadside stand— are cheap but nourishing. He guaranteed that nothing got you drunker quicker than brandy. At any rate, as far as the bill was concerned he never caused me to feel the least anxiety or fear.","When Horiki and I went out, I just handed him my wallet and let him do all of the haggling. He was quite adept at having fun. He could extract the greatest amount of pleasure from the smallest amount of money. We eschewed one-yen taxis, relying instead on his familiarity with the complex network of trains, buses, steamers, and every other cheap means of transport to get us to our destination in the shortest possible time. On the way home after a long night at the brothels he knew which inn to stop at for a bath, boiled tofu, and a quick drink—though cheap, it felt almost luxurious. He equipped me with a practical education. He extolled the virtues of yakitori and beef bowls as cheap and nutritious. He avowed that there was nothing better for getting drunk fast than an electric brandy cocktail. And when it came time to pay the reckoning, he never once gave me cause for anxiety."
一週間ほど、ぼんやり、自分はそこにいました。アパートの窓のすぐ近くの電線に、奴凧やっこだこが一つひっからまっていて、春のほこり風に吹かれ、破られ、それでもなかなか、しつっこく電線にからみついて離れず、何やら首肯うなずいたりなんかしているので、自分はそれを見る度毎に苦笑し、赤面し、夢にさえ見て、うなされました。,"I was there for about a week, vaguely. A kite and a dream was caught in the electric wire near the window of the apartment, and it was blown by the dusty wind of spring and torn, but it was still hard to get entangled with the electric wire and nodded. Every time I saw it, I smiled, blushed, even dreamed, and was struck.","For about a week I remained in a state of daze. Just outside the apartment window was a kite caught in the telegraph wires; blown about and ripped by the dusty spring wind, it nevertheless clung tenaciously to the wires, as if in affirmation of something. Every time I looked at the kite I had to smile with embarrassment and blush. It haunted me even in dreams.","I’d been there for a week or so, idly whiling the time away. Power lines ran near the window and a kite decorated with a colorful drawing of an old-fashioned houseboy had become entangled in them, tossing this way and that, torn in places by the strong, dusty spring winds. Still, it clung tenaciously to the wire, bouncing back and forth as though bobbing its head in agreement. I grimaced and reddened each time I saw it. It even appeared in my dreams, making me groan in my sleep."
自分の部屋の上の小窓があいていて、そこから部屋の中が見えます。電気がついたままで、二匹の動物がいました。,"There is a small window above my room, from which I can see the inside of the room. There were two animals with the lights on.","A small window opened over my room, through which I could see the interior. The light was lit and two animals were visible.","The small window above my room was open and we could see inside. The light was on, two animals were inside."

何でもいいから、笑わせておればいいのだ、そうすると、人間たちは、自分が彼等の所謂「生活」の外にいても、あまりそれを気にしないのではないかしら、とにかく、彼等人間たちの目障りになってはいけない、自分は無だ、風だ、空そらだ、というような思いばかりが募り、自分はお道化に依って家族を笑わせ、また、家族よりも、もっと不可解でおそろしい下男や下女にまで、必死のお道化のサーヴィスをしたのです。,"It doesn't matter what you do, just make them laugh, and maybe they don't really care if they're outside their so-called ""life"", anyway, they humans.

I had to avoid becoming an eyesore to those human beings. I am nothing, I am the wind, the sky. Such were my thoughts as I strove to entertain my family with my clowning. I played the clown—desperately— even for the maids and servants, as they seemed to me far more incomprehensible and terrifying than my own family."
哀れな童女の歌声が、幻聴のように、かすかに遠くから聞えます。不幸。この世には、さまざまの不幸な人が、いや、不幸な人ばかり、と言っても過言ではないでしょうが、しかし、その人たちの不幸は、所謂世間に対して堂々と抗議が出来、また「世間」もその人たちの抗議を容易に理解し同情します。しかし、自分の不幸は、すべて自分の罪悪からなので、誰にも抗議の仕様が無いし、また口ごもりながら一言でも抗議めいた事を言いかけると、ヒラメならずとも世間の人たち全部、よくもまあそんな口がきけたものだと呆あきれかえるに違いないし、自分はいったい俗にいう「わがままもの」なのか、またはその反対に、気が弱すぎるのか、自分でもわけがわからないけれども、とにかく罪悪のかたまりらしいので、どこまでも自おのずからどんどん不幸になるばかりで、防ぎ止める具体策など無いのです。,"The singing voice of a poor child can be heard from a distance, like a hallucination. Unhappiness. It is no exaggeration to say that there are various unhappy people in this world, no, only unhappy people, but their unhappiness can openly protest against the so-called world, and "" The public easily understands and sympathizes with their protests. However, since my misfortune is all due to my guilt, no one has a specification for protest, and when I say that I protested even with a single word, even if it is not flatfish, all the people in the world, well, that's right. I'm sure I'm afraid that I'm fluent, and I don't know if I'm a ""selfish thing"" or, on the contrary, I'm too weak, but it seems to be a mass of guilt anyway. Therefore, I'm just getting more and more unhappy by myself, and there is no concrete measure to prevent it.","I could hear indistinctly from the distance, like an auditory hallucination, the voice of a little girl singing. Unhappiness. There arc all kinds of unhappy people in this world. I suppose it would be no exaggeration to say that the world is composed entirely of unhappy people. But those people can fight their unhappiness with society fairly and squarely, and society for its part easily understands and sympathizes with such struggles. My unhappiness stemmed entirely from my own vices, and I had no way of fighting anybody. If I had ever attempted to voice anything in the nature of a protest, even a single mumbled word, the whole of society—and not only Flatfish— would undoubtedly have cried out flabbergasted, ""Imagine the audacity of him talking like that!"" Am I what they call an egoist? Or am I the opposite, a man of excessively weak spirit? I really don't know myself, but since I seem in either case to be a mass of vices, I drop steadily, inevitably, into unhappiness, and I have no specific plan to stave off my descent.","The forlorn voice of a young girl singing the nursery rhyme seemed to drift out from the darkness, so faint I thought my ears might be playing tricks on me. Misery. The world had all sorts of miserable people—I doubt it would be much of an exaggeration to say it was filled with miserable people. Yet their misery was of the sort where they could unabashedly protest their misery to “society.” “Society,” in turn, immediately understood their protest and was sympathetic to it. My misery, on the other hand, was entirely the product of my own guilt, so there was nobody I could turn to. Should I venture even the most tentative of objections it wouldn’t just be Flounder sneering at me, despairing at my nerve, but all of society as a whole. Was it simply that I, as the saying goes, thought “the whole world revolves around me”? Or was it the opposite? Was I too timid? I myself had no idea. I was nothing more than a lump of guilt, capable only of making myself ever more miserable, with absolutely no idea how to stop."

竹一が、自分に耳だれの膿の仕末をしてもらって、お前は惚れられるという馬鹿なお世辞を言い、自分はその時、ただ顔を赤らめて笑って、何も答えませんでしたけれども、しかし、実は、幽かすかに思い当るところもあったのでした。でも、「惚れられる」というような野卑な言葉に依って生じるやにさがった雰囲気ふんいきに対して、そう言われると、思い当るところもある、などと書くのは、ほとんど落語の若旦那のせりふにさえならぬくらい、おろかしい感懐を示すようなもので、まさか、自分は、そんなふざけた、やにさがった気持で、「思い当るところもあった」わけでは無いのです。,"Takeichi made a silly compliment that he would fall in love with his otorrhea pus, and at that time he just blushed and laughed and didn't answer anything, but Actually, there was a faint idea. However, it is almost a rakugo young husband's line to write that there are some things that come to mind when you say that to the sloppy atmosphere created by the vulgar words such as ""I fall in love"".

"" Takeichi uttered that idiotic compliment, that women would fall for me, because I had been kind enough to clean the discharge from his ears. My reaction at the time was merely to blush and smile, without saying a word in return but, to tell the truth, I already had a faint inkling of what his prophecy implied. No, to speak in those terms of the atmosphere engendered by so vulgar an expression as ""to fall for"" is to betray a precocity of sentiment not even worthy of the dialogue of the romantic lead in a musical comedy; I certainly was not moved by the farcical, self-satisfied emotions suggested by the phrase ""to have a faint inkling. ""","If we move away from such crude notions as how difficult it is to have girls falling for you and instead, to phrase it in literary terms, consider the anxiety of being loved, then those depressing temple walls remain intact. When Takeichi proffered this absurd flattery, saying that girls would fall for me, I just smiled and blushed as I cleaned his ears and did not say a word. Yet, in fact, I did have an inkling—if only faintly—that there might be something to what he said. Don’t misunderstand me. I don’t write “there might be something to what he said” in that absurd, self-satisfied, boastful sense that such uncouth expressions as “girls will fall for you” typically evoke. That would be too much, even coming from one of the dissolute young men who appear in rakugo stories. Clearly, I did not think, “there might be something to it” in this kind of ridiculous, smirking manner."

自分は起き上って、ひとりで焼酎を飲み、それから、おいおい声を放って泣きました。いくらでも、いくらでも泣けるのでした。,"I got up, drank shochu alone, and then cried with a loud voice.

そうして自分たちは、やがて結婚して、それに依って得た歓楽よろこびは、必ずしも大きくはありませんでしたが、その後に来た悲哀かなしみは、凄惨せいさんと言っても足りないくらい、実に想像を絶して、大きくやって来ました。自分にとって、「世の中」は、やはり底知れず、おそろしいところでした。決して、そんな一本勝負などで、何から何まできまってしまうような、なまやさしいところでも無かったのでした。,"The joy and joy they got from getting married wasn't necessarily great, but the sadness that came after that was so terrible that it wasn't enough to imagine it. It came out big. For me, the ""world"" was a horrifying place. By no means, there was no such thing as a simple game where you could end up with something like that.","Not long afterwards we were married. The joy I obtained as a result of this action was not necessarily great or savage, but the suffering which ensued was staggering—so far surpassing what I had imagined that even describing it as ""horrendous"" would not quite cover it. The ""world,"" after all, was still a place of bottomless horror. It was by no means a place of childlike simplicity where everything could be settled by a single then-and-there decision.","We married soon thereafter, and while the joy I gained was modest, the sadness—no, even the word misery falls short of the mark— that came after was terrible beyond all imagining. “The world,” it seems, really was an infinitely terrifying place after all. It is certainly not the amiable sort of place where everything is decided with a single throw of the dice."

しかし、こんなのは、ほんのささやかな一例に過ぎません。互いにあざむき合って、しかもいずれも不思議に何の傷もつかず、あざむき合っている事にさえ気がついていないみたいな、実にあざやかな、それこそ清く明るくほがらかな不信の例が、人間の生活に充満しているように思われます。けれども、自分には、あざむき合っているという事には、さして特別の興味もありません。自分だって、お道化に依って、朝から晩まで人間をあざむいているのです。自分は、修身教科書的な正義とか何とかいう道徳には、あまり関心を持てないのです。自分には、あざむき合っていながら、清く明るく朗らかに生きている、或いは生き得る自信を持っているみたいな人間が難解なのです。人間は、ついに自分にその妙諦みょうていを教えてはくれませんでした。それさえわかったら、自分は、人間をこんなに恐怖し、また、必死のサーヴィスなどしなくて、すんだのでしょう。人間の生活と対立してしまって、夜々の地獄のこれほどの苦しみを嘗なめずにすんだのでしょう。つまり、自分が下男下女たちの憎むべきあの犯罪をさえ、誰にも訴えなかったのは、人間への不信からではなく、また勿論クリスト主義のためでもなく、人間が、葉蔵という自分に対して信用の殻を固く閉じていたからだったと思います。父母でさえ、自分にとって難解なものを、時折、見せる事があったのですから。,"But this is just one small example. Human life is filled with examples of distrust that is so vivid, pure, bright, and glaring that they are ridiculing each other, and none of them mysteriously hurt them, and they do not even notice that they are ridiculing each other. Seems to be doing. However, I have no particular interest in being ridiculous. Even myself, depending on the clown, mock humans from morning till night. I'm not very interested in morals such as moral textbook justice. It is difficult for me to be a person who lives cleanly, brightly and cheerfully, or who is confident that he can live, while being ridiculous. Humans haven't finally taught themselves that mystery. If I knew that, I wouldn't have been so scared of humans and had to do desperate services. Perhaps it would have been in conflict with human life and would not have ridiculed the suffering of hell at night. In other words, it wasn't because of distrust of humans, and of course, because of Christism, that I didn't even appeal to anyone for that hateful crime of my younger men and women. I think it was because the shell of credit was tightly closed. Even my parents would occasionally show me something that was difficult for me.","This, however, is only a minor example. I am convinced that human life is filled with many pure, happy, serene examples of insincerity, truly splendid of their kind—of people deceiving one another without (strangely enough) any wounds being inflicted, of people who seem unaware even that they are deceiving one another. But I have no special interest in instances of mutual deception. I myself spent the whole day long deceiving human beings with my clowning. I have not been able to work up much concern over the morality prescribed in textbooks of ethics under such names as ""righteousness. "" I find it difficult to understand the kind of human being who lives, or who is sure he can live, purely, happily, serenely while engaged in deceit. Human beings never did teach me that abstruse secret. If I had only known that one thing I should never have had to dread human beings so, nor should I have opposed myself to human life, nor tasted such torments of hell every night. In short, I believe that the reason why I did not tell anyone about that loathesome crime perpetrated on me by the servants was not because of distrust for human beings, nor of course because of Christian leanings, but because the human beings around me had rigorously sealed me off from the world of trust or distrust. Even my parents at times displayed attitudes which were hard for me to understand.","This is but one example and an insignificant one at that. People spend their entire lives deceiving and lying to one another, yet, odder still, nobody seems especially offended by it. Human life is so full of pure, vivid, merry duplicity that I begin to think they don’t even realize they are deceiving one another. For my part, I’m not particularly troubled by the deceptions. After all, what is my clowning but a lie I tell the whole day through? Questions of morality and the notions of right and wrong you find in ethics textbooks have never interested me. What I find incomprehensible are the people who can lead such pure, vivid, merry lives even as they lie to one another. Where do they get the confidence? Nobody has shared this secret with me. Had they done so perhaps I wouldn’t have had to live in such terror of people, or to seek so desperately to please them. Perhaps I would’ve been able to avoid being excluded from the lives of human beings, perhaps I would’ve been able to live my life without tasting the hell of my nightly torments. In the end, it wasn’t because of my distrust of others or because of Christianity that I was unable to seek help even when the servants inflicted their hateful crimes upon me. It was because human beings had sealed their hard shell of trust against me, against this “I” known as Yōzō. Even Mother and Father sometimes did things that were incomprehensible to me."

自分の人間恐怖は、それは以前にまさるとも劣らぬくらい烈しく胸の底で蠕動ぜんどうしていましたが、しかし、演技は実にのびのびとして来て、教室にあっては、いつもクラスの者たちを笑わせ、教師も、このクラスは大庭さえいないと、とてもいいクラスなんだが、と言葉では嘆じながら、手で口を覆って笑っていました。自分は、あの雷の如き蛮声を張り上げる配属将校をさえ、実に容易に噴き出させる事が出来たのです。,"My human horror was as fierce as it used to be, peristaltic at the bottom of my chest, but the acting was so laid-back that in the classroom it always made the classmates laugh. The teacher also laughed, covering his mouth with his hands, lamenting that this class would be a very good class without even Oba. I was able to spew out even the assigned officer who raised that thunderous barbaric voice very easily.","The fear of human beings continued to writhe in my breast—I am not sure whether more or less intensely than before—but my acting talents had unquestionably matured. I could always convulse the classroom with laughter, and even as the teacher protested what a good class it would be if only I were not in it, he would be laughing behind his hand. At a word from me even the military drill instructor, whose more usual idiom was a barbarous, thunderous roar, would burst into helpless laughter.","My terror of people hadn’t receded in the slightest—it may have even grown—and though fear still writhed deep in my breast I became so adept in my performances that I was forever making my classmates laugh. Even my homeroom teacher, who often complained about how much better the class would be if only I weren’t in it, had to hide his grins behind his hand. I could even make the military drill instructor, with his barbaric shouting and voice like a thunderclap, collapse in laughter with the greatest of ease."

また、自分は子供の頃、絵本で地下鉄道というものを見て、これもやはり、実利的な必要から案出せられたものではなく、地上の車に乗るよりは、地下の車に乗ったほうが風がわりで面白い遊びだから、とばかり思っていました。,"Also, when I was a kid, I saw an underground railroad in a picture book, and this was also not conceived from a practical need, so it is better to ride an underground car than to ride a car on the ground. I just thought it was an interesting play because of the wind.","Again, when as a child I saw photographs of subway trains in picture books, it never occurred to me that they had been invented out of practical necessity; I could only suppose that riding underground instead of on the surface must be a novel and delightful pastime.","Another time, when I was a child, I saw an illustration of a subway.

それは誰でも、人から非難せられたり、怒られたりしていい気持がするものでは無いかも知れませんが、自分は怒っている人間の顔に、獅子ししよりも鰐わによりも竜よりも、もっとおそろしい動物の本性を見るのです。ふだんは、その本性をかくしているようですけれども、何かの機会に、たとえば、牛が草原でおっとりした形で寝ていて、突如、尻尾しっぽでピシッと腹の虻あぶを打ち殺すみたいに、不意に人間のおそろしい正体を、怒りに依って暴露する様子を見て、自分はいつも髪の逆立つほどの戦慄せんりつを覚え、この本性もまた人間の生きて行く資格の一つなのかも知れないと思えば、ほとんど自分に絶望を感じるのでした。,"It may not be a good feeling for anyone to be criticized or angry, but I'm on the face of an angry human, more than a lion, more than a dragon. But we also see the more terrifying nature of animals. Normally, it seems to hide its true nature, but on some occasion, for example, a cow is sleeping in a calm manner in the meadow, and suddenly it suddenly kills its belly with its tail tail. Seeing how angry exposes the terrifying identity of human beings, I always feel the horror of my hair, and if I think that this nature may also be one of the qualifications for human beings to live. I almost felt despair in myself.","It is true, I suppose, that nobody finds it exactly pleasant to be criticized or shouted at, but I see in the face of the human being raging at me a wild animal in its true colors, one more horrible than any lion, crocodile or dragon. People normally seem to be hiding this true nature, but an occasion will arise (as when an ox sedately ensconced in a grassy meadow suddenly lashes out with its tail to kill the horsefly on its flank) when anger makes them reveal in a flash human nature in all its horror. Seeing this happen has always induced in me a fear great enough to make my hair stand on end, and at the thought that this nature might be one of the prerequisites for survival as a human being, I have come close to despairing of myself.","Of course, nobody likes being criticized and yelled at, but, in my case, I thought I glimpsed a terrifying animal nature in those angry faces—far more frightening and dreadful than any lion, crocodile, or dragon. Though usually concealed, a fit of rage might suddenly tear away the veil, just as a cow dozing idly in a pasture suddenly cracks its tail, obliterating a horsefly with a single blow. My hair stood on end and a shiver ran down my spine when I thought that possessing this instinct might be a necessary condition for living among humans. I came close to despair."
自分は、ぐらぐら目まいしながら、これもまた人間の姿だ、これもまた人間の姿だ、おどろく事は無い、など劇はげしい呼吸と共に胸の中で呟つぶやき、ヨシ子を助ける事も忘れ、階段に立ちつくしていました。,"While dizzy, I muttered in my chest with a violent breath, forgetting to help Yoshiko, and on the stairs, this is also a human figure, this is also a human figure, there is nothing to be surprised. I was standing up.","My eyes swam, but I murmured to myself through my violent breathing, ""This is just another aspect of the behavior of human beings. There's nothing to be surprised at. "" I stood petrified on the staircase, not even thinking to help Yoshiko.","I felt dizzy, my vision blurred. It’s just what human beings do, that’s all. No cause for surprise, I whispered to myself, gasping for breath. I stood rooted to the spot, forgetting even to go to Yoshiko’s aid."

実に、珍らしい事でした。すすめられて、それを拒否したのは、自分のそれまでの生涯に於いて、その時ただ一度、といっても過言でないくらいなのです。自分の不幸は、拒否の能力の無い者の不幸でした。すすめられて拒否すると、相手の心にも自分の心にも、永遠に修繕し得ない白々しいひび割れが出来るような恐怖におびやかされているのでした。けれども、自分はその時、あれほど半狂乱になって求めていたモルヒネを、実に自然に拒否しました。ヨシ子の謂わば「神の如き無智」に撃たれたのでしょうか。自分は、あの瞬間、すでに中毒でなくなっていたのではないでしょうか。,"It was really unusual. It is no exaggeration to say that I was recommended and rejected it only once in my lifetime. My misfortune was the misfortune of those who were incapable of refusing. When I was encouraged to refuse, I was scared of the fear of creating white cracks that could not be repaired forever, both in the other person's heart and in my own heart. However, at that time, I naturally rejected the morphine I was looking for so frantically. Was it shot by Yoshiko's so-called ""God-like ignorance""? I think I wasn't addicted at that moment.","This was a really rare event. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that it was the one and only time in my life that I refused something offered to me. My unhappiness was the unhappiness of a person who could not say no. I had been intimidated by the fear that if I declined something offered me, a yawning crevice would open between the other person's heart and myself which could never be mended through all eternity. Yet I now refused in a perfectly natural manner the morphine which I had so desperately craved. Was it because I was struck by Yoshiko's divine ignorance? I wonder if I had not already ceased at that instant to be an addict.","This was truly remarkable. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this solitary instance was the only time in my entire life I rejected something offered me. Mine was the misery of one who cannot say no. I was terrified that, should I refuse, an irreparable, eternal crack would snake through the both of us. Yet, at that instant, though half-mad with cravings, I refused the morphine without a second thought. Perhaps I’d been moved by Yoshiko’s “divine ignorance.” I wonder if my addiction did not cease at that precise moment."

それこそ、冗談から駒が出た形でした。あの置手紙に、書いたとおりに、自分は浅草の堀木をたずねて行く事にしたのです。自分はこれまで、自分のほうから堀木の家をたずねて行った事は、いちども無く、たいてい電報で堀木を自分のほうに呼び寄せていたのですが、いまはその電報料さえ心細く、それに落ちぶれた身のひがみから、電報を打っただけでは、堀木は、来てくれぬかも知れぬと考えて、何よりも自分に苦手の「訪問」を決意し、溜息ためいきをついて市電に乗り、自分にとって、この世の中でたった一つの頼みの綱は、あの堀木なのか、と思い知ったら、何か脊筋せすじの寒くなるような凄すさまじい気配に襲われました。,"That was the form of the piece coming out of the joke. As I wrote in that letter, I decided to ask Horiki in Asakusa. I have never visited Horiki's house from myself, and I usually called Horiki to myself by telegram, but now even the telegram fee is lonely, and I am disappointed. Horiki thought that he might not come just by sending a telegram from his body, so he decided to ""visit"", which he was not good at, and took a sigh and took the streetcar for himself. When I realized that the only rope I could rely on in the world was that Horiki, I was struck by a terrible sign that the spine was cold.","Here was a real case of a true word having been said in jest: I decided to visit Horiki, exactly as I had stated in my farewell note to Flatfish. I had never before gone myself to Horiki's house. Usually I would invite him to my place by telegram when I wanted to see him. Now, however, I doubted whether I could manage the telegraph fee. I also wondered, with the jaundiced intelligence of a man in disgrace, whether Horiki might not refuse to come even if I telegraphed him. I decided on a visit, the most difficult thing in the world for me. Giving vent to a sigh, I boarded the streetcar. The thought that the only hope left me in the world was Horiki filled me with a foreboding dreadful enough to send chills up and down my spine.","I’d meant it as a joke but in the end I did just as I wrote in my letter. I went to see Horiki in Asakusa. This was the first time I’d actually gone to see him at home. Before I’d just sent telegrams, telling him to come and meet me, but now I begrudged even the telegram fee and, disgraced as I was , I wasn’t certain that a telegram would be sufficient to bring him out. So I resigned myself to doing what I disliked most and decided to pay Horiki a visit. With a heavy sigh I climbed aboard a streetcar, and, when it occurred to me that the sole ray of hope left to me in this world was none other than Horiki, a terrible wave of foreboding swept over me, sending shivers down my spine."

父は議会の無い時は、月に一週間か二週間しかその家に滞在していませんでしたので、父の留守の時は、かなり広いその家に、別荘番の老夫婦と自分と三人だけで、自分は、ちょいちょい学校を休んで、さりとて東京見物などをする気も起らず（自分はとうとう、明治神宮も、楠正成くすのきまさしげの銅像も、泉岳寺の四十七士の墓も見ずに終りそうです）家で一日中、本を読んだり、絵をかいたりしていました。父が上京して来ると、自分は、毎朝そそくさと登校するのでしたが、しかし、本郷千駄木町の洋画家、安田新太郎氏の画塾に行き、三時間も四時間も、デッサンの練習をしている事もあったのです。高等学校の寮から脱けたら、学校の授業に出ても、自分はまるで聴講生みたいな特別の位置にいるような、それは自分のひがみかも知れなかったのですが、何とも自分自身で白々しい気持がして来て、いっそう学校へ行くのが、おっくうになったのでした。自分には、小学校、中学校、高等学校を通じて、ついに愛校心というものが理解できずに終りました。校歌などというものも、いちども覚えようとした事がありません。,"My dad stayed in the house for only a week or two a month when there was no parliament, so when he was away, he was in a fairly large house with only three people, the old couple in the villa. So, I didn't feel like taking a break from school for a while to see Tokyo (I finally, Meiji Jingu, the statue of Masanari Kusunoki, and the tomb of the 47th priest at Sengakuji Temple. I'm going to finish without seeing it) I used to read books and draw pictures all day at home. When my father came to Tokyo, I went to school every morning, but I went to the art school of Shintaro Yasuda, a Western-style painter in Sendagi-cho, Hongo, and practiced drawing for three or four hours. There was also something that was done. When I got out of the high school dormitory, even if I went to school, I felt like I was in a special position like an auditor. It was hard for me to go to school even more. Through elementary school, junior high school, and high school, I finally couldn't understand the love of school. I have never tried to remember school songs.","When the Diet was not in session my father spent only a week or two of the month at the house. While he was away there would be just three of us in the rather imposing mansion—an elderly couple who looked after the premises and myself. I frequently cut classes, but not because I felt like sightseeing in Tokyo. (It looks as if I shall end my days without ever having seen the Meiji Shrine, the statue of Kusunoki Masashige or the tombs of the Forty-Seven Ronin.) Instead I would spend whole days in the house reading and painting. When my father was in town I set out for school promptly every morning, although sometimes I actually went to an art class given by a painter in Hongo, and practiced sketching for three or four hours at a time with him. Having been able to escape from the college dormitory I felt rather cynically—this may have been my own bias—that I was now in a rather special position. Even if I attended lectures it was more like an auditor than a regular student. Attending classes became all the more tedious. I had gone through elementary and high schools and was now in college without ever having been able to understand what was meant by school spirit. I never even tried to learn the school songs.","When the Diet wasn’t sitting Father only spent a week or two each month in Tokyo, and while he was away there were only three of us in the large house—me and the elderly couple who looked after the place—so I was able to skip classes now and then. Yet I never felt any desire to go out and see the sights of Tokyo (even now it seems I will end my days without ever having seen the Meiji Shrine or the bronze statue of Kusunoki Masahige or having visited the graves of the forty-seven samurai at Sengaku Temple) and instead spent the whole day at home reading and painting. When Father was in Tokyo I rushed off to class early each morning, but I sometimes stopped at Yasuda Shintarō’s Western-style painting studio in the Sendagi district of Hongō instead, spending three or four hours at a time practicing my sketching. Ever since I’d escaped from the dormitory, even when I did show up to class I felt strangely distant from my classmates, as though I were just an auditing student. Perhaps this was a result of my own biases, but it became painfully obvious to me, and I grew increasingly reluctant to attend classes. Throughout my entire time at elementary, middle, and higher schools I never managed to understand what they meant by “school spirit.” I never even bothered to learn any of my school songs."
シヅ子の取計らいで、ヒラメ、堀木、それにシヅ子、三人の会談が成立して、自分は、故郷から全く絶縁せられ、そうしてシヅ子と「天下晴れて」同棲どうせいという事になり、これまた、シヅ子の奔走のおかげで自分の漫画も案外お金になって、自分はそのお金で、お酒も、煙草も買いましたが、自分の心細さ、うっとうしさは、いよいよつのるばかりなのでした。それこそ「沈み」に「沈み」切って、シヅ子の雑誌の毎月の連載漫画「キンタさんとオタさんの冒険」を画いていると、ふいと故郷の家が思い出され、あまりの侘びしさに、ペンが動かなくなり、うつむいて涙をこぼした事もありました。,"With Shizuko's arrangement, a meeting between Hirame, Horiki, and Shizuko was established, and I was completely isolated from my hometown, so I was supposed to live together with Shizuko ""in the sun"". Also, thanks to Shizuko's strenuous efforts, my manga became unexpectedly money, and I bought alcohol and cigarettes with that money, but my delicateness and annoyance were just getting worse. That's what I cut into ""sinking"" and drawing the monthly serialized manga ""Kinta-san and Ota-san's Adventure"" in Shizuko's magazine. Sometimes the pen got stuck and I turned down and spilled tears.","At Shizuko's suggestion a conference took place attended by Flatfish, Horiki and herself at which it was concluded that all relations between me and my family were to be broken, and I was to live with Shizuko as man and wife. Thanks also to Shizuko's efforts, my cartoons began to produce a surprising amount of money. I bought liquor and cigarettes, as I had planned, with the proceeds, but my gloom and depression grew only the more intense. I had sunk to the bottom: sometimes when I was drawing ""The Adventures of Kinta and Ota,"" the monthly comic strip for Shizuko's magazine, I would suddenly think of home, and this made me feel so miserable that my pen would stop moving, and I looked down, through brimming tears.","She set up a meeting between herself, Flounder, and Horiki where it was decided that all remaining ties with my family would be severed and Shizuko and I would live openly as husband and wife. Furthermore, thanks to Shizuko’s deft maneuverings, my cartoons were bringing in surprisingly large amounts of money. Even as I spent that money on liquor and cigarettes, my feelings of loneliness and gloom only grew worse with each passing day. I’d sunk so low that there were times when, drawing “The Adventures of Kinta and Ota” for Shizuko’s magazine , I would suddenly find myself so overwhelmed by longing for my family back home that my pen ceased its scratching and, my head hanging, tears began to spill from my eyes."

I didn't feel like chasing the flounder and complaining about anything, and I was almost completely foolish.","Ever since coming to this house I had lacked all incentive even to play the clown; I had merely lain prostrate under the contemptuous glances of Flatfish and the boy. Flatfish himself seemed disinclined to indulge in long, heart-to-heart talks, and for my part no desire stirred within me to run after him with complaints. Flatfish pursued his discourse.","Since arriving at Flounder’s house I’d lost even the energy to play the clown and meekly surrendered myself to the scorn of Flounder and his boy. For his part, Flounder seemed keen to avoid long, frank talks with me, and I felt no desire to go chasing after him to plead my case.

じっさい、ヨシ子は、信頼の天才と言いたいくらい、京橋のバアのマダムとの間はもとより、自分が鎌倉で起した事件を知らせてやっても、ツネ子との間を疑わず、それは自分が噓がうまいからというわけでは無く、時には、あからさまな言い方をする事さえあったのに、ヨシ子には、それがみな冗談としか聞きとれぬ様子でした。,"In fact, Yoshiko is a genius of trust, and even if she informs her of the incident that happened in Kamakura, not to mention Madame of Baa in Kyobashi, she does not doubt that she is a joke. It wasn't because he was good at it, and sometimes he even said it outright, but Yoshiko seemed to hear it all as a joke.","As a matter of fact, Yoshiko was what I should like to call a genius at trusting people. She suspected nothing of my relations with the madam of the bar in Kyobashi, and even after I told her all about the incident which occurred at Kamakura, she was equally unsuspicious of my relations with Tsuneko. It was not because I was an accomplished liar— at times I spoke quite bluntly, but Yoshiko seemed to take everything I said as a joke.","Indeed, I think Yoshiko had a divine gift for trusting people. She never suspected anything about my relationship with the Madam from Kyōbashi, and even when I told her about the Kamakura incident she didn’t believe there had been anything between Tsuneko and me.

Then, tears burst out from his wife's big eyes.","I got up from the snowbank with the thought: I ought to get the proper kind of medicine without delay. I went into a pharmacy nearby. The proprietress and I exchanged looks as I entered; for that instant her eyes popped and she held her head lifted, as if caught in the light of a flash bulb. She stood ramrod stiff. But in her wide-open eyes there was no trace of alarm or dislike; her look spoke of longing, almost of the seeking for salvation. I thought, ""She must be unhappy too. Unhappy people are sensitive to the unhappiness of others. ""Not until then did I happen to notice that she stood with difficulty, supporting herself on crutches. I suppressed a desire to run up beside her, but I could not take my eyes from her face. I felt tears starting, and saw then the tears brimming from her big eyes. That was all.","I stood up and my first thought was to get some sort of medicine, so I went to the nearest pharmacy. My gaze met that of the lady of the shop. Instantly. She lifted her head, eyes widening as though bathed in a flash of light, standing rooted to the spot. Yet her eyes widened not in loathing or fear but rather in pleading, as though yearning for salvation. Ah, she is miserable too. I’m certain of it. Those who suffer misery can sense it in others. Just as this thought crossed my mind I saw her totter as she leaned heavily on a pair of crutches. I had to suppress my sudden urge to rush to her side. Tears spilled from my eyes as I gazed at her. Her large eyes began to overflow with tears as well. That’s all."
シヅ子に、そのほかさまざまの事を言われて、おだてられても、それが即すなわち男めかけのけがらわしい特質なのだ、と思えば、それこそいよいよ「沈む」ばかりで、一向に元気が出ず、女よりは金、とにかくシヅ子からのがれて自活したいとひそかに念じ、工夫しているものの、かえってだんだんシヅ子にたよらなければならぬ破目になって、家出の後仕末やら何やら、ほとんど全部、この男まさりの甲州女の世話を受け、いっそう自分は、シヅ子に対し、所謂「おどおど」しなければならぬ結果になったのでした。,"Even if Shizuko tells me various other things and is fooled, if I think that it is a characteristic that is immediately injured by a man, it is just ""sinking"", and I am not feeling well at all, a woman Rather than money, I secretly thought that I wanted to escape from Shizuko and support myself, but I gradually became a breach that I had to rely on Shizuko, and after leaving home, almost everything, Taking care of this man, the Koshu woman, I had to be more so-called ""frightened"" to Shizuko.","Shizuko flattered me with these and other comments which, with the special repulsive quality of the kept man, I calmly accepted. Whenever I thought of my situation I sank all the deeper in my depression, and I lost all my energy. It kept preying on my mind that I needed money more than a woman, that anyway I wanted to escape from Shizuko and make my own living. I made plans of every sort, but my struggles only enmeshed me the more in my dependence on her. This strong-minded woman herself dealt with the complications which developed from my running away, and took care of almost everything else for me. As a result I became more timid than ever before her.","Shizuko often said things like that, flattering and coaxing me. Yet, when it occurred to me that her remarks possessed the unwholesome quality specific to words addressed to a kept man they had the opposite effect and I found myself sinking even further, unable to rouse even a glimmer of spirit. I wanted money, not women. I secretly yearned and schemed for some means to support myself, enabling me to escape from Shizuko, but, in the end, these schemes only made me more reliant upon her.

もうひとりは、女子高等師範の文科生の所謂「同志」でした。このひととは、れいの運動の用事で、いやでも毎日、顔を合せなければならなかったのです。打ち合せがすんでからも、その女は、いつまでも自分について歩いて、そうして、やたらに自分に、ものを買ってくれるのでした。,"The other was the so-called ""comrade"" of a female high school teacher. This person was an errand for Rei's exercise, and I had to meet face to face every day. Even after the meeting was over, the woman would walk with her forever and then buy something for her.","The second girl interested in me was a ""comrade,"" a student in a teacher's training college.

Even after the arrangements for the day's job had been completed, she doggedly tagged along after me.","The second woman was one of my “comrades” who studied in the humanities at a women’s teacher’s college.

それから、ひとつき、自分は、その夜の恩人とは逢いませんでした。別れて、日が経つにつれて、よろこびは薄れ、かりそめの恩を受けた事がかえってそらおそろしく、自分勝手にひどい束縛を感じて来て、あのカフエのお勘定を、あの時、全部ツネ子の負担にさせてしまったという俗事さえ、次第に気になりはじめて、ツネ子もやはり、下宿の娘や、あの女子高等師範と同じく、自分を脅迫するだけの女のように思われ、遠く離れていながらも、絶えずツネ子におびえていて、その上に自分は、一緒に休んだ事のある女に、また逢うと、その時にいきなり何か烈火の如く怒られそうな気がしてたまらず、逢うのに頗すこぶるおっくうがる性質でしたので、いよいよ、銀座は敬遠の形でしたが、しかし、そのおっくうがるという性質は、決して自分の狡猾こうかつさではなく、女性というものは、休んでからの事と、朝、起きてからの事との間に、一つの、塵ちりほどの、つながりをも持たせず、完全の忘却の如く、見事に二つの世界を切断させて生きているという不思議な現象を、まだよく呑みこんでいなかったからなのでした。,"Then, one thing, I didn't meet the benefactor of the night. As the days went by, the joy diminished, and the benefit of Karisome was rather terrifying, and I felt a terrible bond on my own, and that Kafue's bill was all borne by Tsuneko at that time. Even the profane thing that made me cry is gradually becoming anxious, and Tsuneko, like the daughter of the boarding house and that female high school teacher, seems to be a woman who only threatens herself, even though she is far away. I was constantly frightened by Tsuneko, and when I met a woman who had rested with me again, I suddenly felt like I was getting angry like a fiery fire. Ginza was finally a form of shyness because it was a very humorous nature, but that humorous nature is by no means my own cunningness, and women are after resting. And, in the morning, between what happened after waking up, there was no connection like dust, and it was a mysterious life that cut off the two worlds like a complete oblivion. It was because I hadn't swallowed the phenomenon well yet.","I didn't meet my benefactor of that night again for a whole month. After leaving her my happiness grew fainter every day that went by. It frightened me even that I had accepted a moment's kindness: I felt I had imposed horrible bonds on myself. Gradually even the mundane fact that Tsuneko had paid the bill at the café began to weigh on me, and I felt as though she was just another threatening woman, like the girl at my lodging house, or the girl from the teacher's training college. Even at the distance which separated us, Tsuneko intimidated me constantly. Besides, I was intolerably afraid that if I met again a woman I had once slept with, I might suddenly burst into a flaming rage. It was my nature to be very timid about meeting people anyway, and so I finally chose the expedient of keeping a safe distance from the Ginza. This timidity of nature was no trickery on my part. Women do not bring to bear so much as a particle of connection between what they do after going to bed and what they do on rising in the morning; they go on living with their world successfully divided in two, as if total oblivion had intervened. My trouble was that I could not yet successfully cope with this extraordinary phenomenon.","A month or so went by before I saw my benefactor of that evening again. With each passing day the joy I had experienced faded and the fleeting kindness she’d shown filled me with a growing sense of dread. Even the most mundane things, such as when Tsuneko paid my bill at the café, aroused in me a terrible sense of obligation, and this came to distress me more and more. Before long I started thinking of Tsuneko much as I thought of the girl from my boarding house or the “comrade” from the women’s teacher’s college. I came to see her only as a threat and, though she was far away, I lived in constant terror of her. To make things worse I couldn’t help thinking that, should I run into a woman I’d once slept with, she would suddenly explode in a furious rage. The prospect of meeting my former lover was thus extremely disagreeable to me, and I kept a respectful distance from Ginza. Now, this attitude of mine was not born of cunning but from the simple fact that I had yet to come to terms with one of the stranger aspects of women. I could not comprehend how a woman could sleep with me and then wake up the next morning as though her memory had been wiped clean and, in the most splendid manner, go on with her life as if the world of night and the world of day were completely cut off from one another."

According to that one word, my feelings should have been decided, but I was just in the mist.","Why, I wonder, couldn’t he have mentioned the simple fact that the money would be forthcoming from home?

自分たちはその時、喜劇名詞、悲劇名詞の当てっこをはじめました。これは、自分の発明した遊戯で、名詞には、すべて男性名詞、女性名詞、中性名詞などの別があるけれども、それと同時に、喜劇名詞、悲劇名詞の区別があって然るべきだ、たとえば、汽船と汽車はいずれも悲劇名詞で、市電とバスは、いずれも喜劇名詞、なぜそうなのか、それのわからぬ者は芸術を談ずるに足らん、喜劇に一個でも悲劇名詞をさしはさんでいる劇作家は、既にそれだけで落第、悲劇の場合もまた然り、といったようなわけなのでした。,"At that time, we started to guess comedy nouns and tragic nouns. This is a game that I invented, and all nouns are masculine, feminine, neutral, etc., but at the same time, there should be a distinction between comedy nouns and tragic nouns, for example, Kisen. And trains are both tragic nouns, streetcars and buses are both comedy nouns, and those who do not understand why it is enough to talk about art, even one tragic noun in the comedy The dramatists who are already failing by themselves, and even in the case of tragedy, and so on.","We began a guessing game of tragic and comic nouns. This game, which I myself had invented, was based on the proposition that just as nouns could be divided into masculine, feminine and neuter, so there was a distinction between tragic and comic nouns. For example, this system decreed that steamship and steam engine were both tragic nouns, while streetcar and bus were comic. Persons who failed to see why this was true were obviously unqualified to discuss art, and a playwright who included even a single tragic noun in a comedy showed himself a failure if for no other reason. The same held equally true of comic nouns in tragedies. I began the questioning.","We played a game of my own invention that consisted of categorizing nouns as either “comic” or “tragic.” Just as nouns were divided into masculine, feminine, neutral, and so on, I thought it only proper that they should also be divided into the comic and the tragic. For example, steamer and steam locomotive are both tragic nouns whereas bus and streetcar are comic. Why? If you have to ask then clearly you are not qualified to discuss such weighty matters of art. Just as a playwright who allowed so much as a single tragic noun to find its way into a comedy would be scorned, so too would a tragedy that contained a comic noun."

After all, the remittance disappeared in a few days, and I became terrified and crazy because of my delicacy. All the circumstances in the letter were fictitious of clowns.

自分でも、ぎょっとしたほど、陰惨な絵が出来上りました。しかし、これこそ胸底にひた隠しに隠している自分の正体なのだ、おもては陽気に笑い、また人を笑わせているけれども、実は、こんな陰鬱な心を自分は持っているのだ、仕方が無い、とひそかに肯定し、けれどもその絵は、竹一以外の人には、さすがに誰にも見せませんでした。自分のお道化の底の陰惨を見破られ、急にケチくさく警戒せられるのもいやでしたし、また、これを自分の正体とも気づかず、やっぱり新趣向のお道化と見なされ、大笑いの種にせられるかも知れぬという懸念もあり、それは何よりもつらい事でしたので、その絵はすぐに押入れの奥深くしまい込みました。,"Even myself, I was able to create a horrifyingly gruesome picture. However, this is what I am hiding in the bottom of my chest, laughing cheerfully and making people laugh, but in fact, I have such a gloomy heart. I secretly affirmed that it wasn't there, but I didn't show the painting to anyone other than Takeichi. I didn't want to be warned suddenly because I was able to see the misery of the bottom of my clown, and I didn't even notice this as my true identity. There was also a concern that it might be used as a seed, and it was the most difficult thing to do, so the painting was immediately stowed deep in the closet.","The pictures I drew were so heart-rending as to stupefy even myself. Here was the true self I had so desperately hidden. I had smiled cheerfully; I had made others laugh; but this was the harrowing reality. I secretly affirmed this self, was sure that there was no escape from it, but naturally I did not show my pictures to anyone except Takeichi. I disliked the thought that I might suddenly be subjected to their suspicious vigilance, when once the nightmarish reality under the clowning was detected. On the other hand, I was equally afraid that they might not recognize my true self when they saw it, but imagine that it was just some new twist to my clowning—occasion for additional snickers. This would have been most painful of all. I therefore hid the pictures in the back of my cupboard.","So dark and gloomy were these paintings that even I shrank from them. Yet, I told myself encouragingly, this is my true self, the one I so assiduously conceal in the depths of my heart. I smile cheerfully on the surface and make others laugh, but in truth mine is a melancholy soul. There was no point in denying it. Even so, I never showed my paintings to anyone other than Takeichi. I was afraid that people might see through my clowning and glimpse the misery it concealed, and I didn’t want to be forced to be on my guard all the time. And I feared they might not realize that the paintings were an expression of my true self but rather see them as some new extension of my clowning and treat them as a hilarious joke. That would be far too much to bear, so I concealed my paintings in the deepest corner of my closet as soon as I finished them."

本所の大工さんの二階を、そのひとが借りていました。自分は、その二階で、日頃の自分の陰鬱な心を少しもかくさず、ひどい歯痛に襲われてでもいるように、片手で頰をおさえながら、お茶を飲みました。そうして、自分のそんな姿態が、かえって、そのひとには、気にいったようでした。そのひとも、身のまわりに冷たい木枯しが吹いて、落葉だけが舞い狂い、完全に孤立している感じの女でした。,"The person rented the second floor of the carpenter at the main office.

しかし、はじめは、この男を好人物、まれに見る好人物とばかり思い込み、さすが人間恐怖の自分も全く油断をして、東京のよい案内者が出来た、くらいに思っていました。自分は、実は、ひとりでは、電車に乗ると車掌がおそろしく、歌舞伎座へはいりたくても、あの正面玄関の緋ひの絨緞じゅうたんが敷かれてある階段の両側に並んで立っている案内嬢たちがおそろしく、レストランへはいると、自分の背後にひっそり立って、皿のあくのを待っている給仕のボーイがおそろしく、殊にも勘定を払う時、ああ、ぎごちない自分の手つき、自分は買い物をしてお金を手渡す時には、吝嗇りんしょくゆえでなく、あまりの緊張、あまりの恥ずかしさ、あまりの不安、恐怖に、くらくら目まいして、世界が真暗になり、ほとんど半狂乱の気持になってしまって、値切るどころか、お釣を受け取るのを忘れるばかりでなく、買った品物を持ち帰るのを忘れた事さえ、しばしばあったほどなので、とても、ひとりで東京のまちを歩けず、それで仕方なく、一日一ぱい家の中で、ごろごろしていたという内情もあったのでした。,"However, at first, I thought that this man was a good person, a good person who rarely sees it, and as expected, I was completely alert to human fear, and I thought that I was able to become a good guide in Tokyo. Actually, when I get on the train alone, the conductor is scary, and even if I want to go to Kabuki-za, the guide lady standing side by side on both sides of the staircase where the scarlet carpet of the front entrance is laid. When we enter the restaurant, the waiter boy who stands quietly behind him and waits for the dish to open is terrifying, especially when he pays the bill, oh, his awkward hand, himself When shopping and handing over money, not because of the ruggedness, but because of too much tension, too much embarrassment, too much anxiety, and fear, the world became dark and almost frenzied. Far from being discounted, I often forgot not only to receive the change, but also to bring back the items I bought, so I couldn't walk the city of Tokyo alone, so I couldn't help it. There was also the inside of the house that I was chilling out every day.","At first, however, I was convinced that Horiki was a nice fellow, an unusually nice fellow, and despite my habitual dread of human beings I relaxed my guard to the extent of thinking that I had found a fine guide to Tokyo. To tell the truth, when I first came to the city, I was afraid to board a streetcar because of the conductor; I was afraid to enter the Kabuki Theatre for fear of the usherettes standing along the sides of the red-carpeted staircase at the main entrance; I was afraid to go into a restaurant because I was intimidated by the waiters furtively hovering behind me waiting for my plate to be emptied. Most of all I dreaded paying a bill—my awkwardness when I handed over the money after buying something did not arise from any stinginess, but from excessive tension, excessive embarrassment, excessive uneasiness and apprehension. My eyes would swim in my head, and the whole world grow dark before me, so that I felt half out of my mind. There was no question of bargaining—not only did I often forget to pick up my change, but I quite frequently forgot to take home the things I had purchased. It was quite impossible for me to make my way around Tokyo by myself. I had no choice but to spend whole days at a time lolling about the house.","In the beginning, however, I thought him a fine fellow indeed. So fine a fellow one hardly saw his like, and, terrified of people though I was, even I was put off my guard as I found myself thinking I had discovered the perfect guide to Tokyo. To be honest, left to my own devices, I was even terrified of the conductors when I set foot on a train. I yearned to see a Kabuki play but was frightened of the young, female ushers who lined either side of the red carpet leading up the theater steps. At restaurants I was scared of the busboys, lurking silently behind me, waiting to clear my plate. And when it came time to pay the bill—oh, how I fumbled. I grew dizzy when it came time to hand over the money. My head spun, the world went dark, and I thought I was going half mad. Not out of parsimony, you see, but because I was so nervous, so embarrassed, so anxious and terrified. Far from trying to haggle the price down, not only would I often forget to take my change, it was so bad that I often even forgot to take the thing I had just purchased. It was utterly impossible for me to go walking about Tokyo on my own. That was the real reason I spent whole days lazing about at home."

自分には、人間の女性のほうが、男性よりもさらに数倍難解でした。自分の家族は、女性のほうが男性よりも数が多く、また親戚にも、女の子がたくさんあり、またれいの「犯罪」の女中などもいまして、自分は幼い時から、女とばかり遊んで育ったといっても過言ではないと思っていますが、それは、また、しかし、実に、薄氷を踏む思いで、その女のひとたちと附合って来たのです。ほとんど、まるで見当が、つかないのです。五里霧中で、そうして時たま、虎の尾を踏む失敗をして、ひどい痛手を負い、それがまた、男性から受ける笞むちとちがって、内出血みたいに極度に不快に内攻して、なかなか治癒ちゆし難い傷でした。,"For me, human females were several times more difficult than males. In my family, there are more females than males, there are many girls in my relatives, and there are also maids of Rei's ""crime"", so I grew up playing with females from an early age. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that, but again, with the thought of stepping on the thin ice, I came with the women. It's almost as if I have no idea. In the Gori fog, I sometimes made a mistake of stepping on the tiger's tail and suffered a terrible wound, which was also extremely unpleasant like internal bleeding, unlike the whip that I received from a man, and it was quite healed. It was a difficult wound.","I have always found the female of the human species many times more difficult to understand than the male. In my immediate family women outnumbered the men, and many of my cousins were girls. There was also the maidservant of the ""crime. "" I think it would be no exaggeration to say that my only playmates while I was growing up were girls. Nevertheless, it was with very much the sensation of treading on thin ice that I associated with these girls. I could almost never guess their motives. I was in the dark; at times I made indiscreet mistakes which brought me painful wounds. These wounds, unlike the scars from the lashing a man might give, cut inwards very deep, like an internal hemorrhage, bringing intense discomfort. Once inflicted it was extremely hard to recover from such wounds.","Women were a hundred times more difficult for me to understand than men. There were more women than men in my family and, even among my more distant relatives, there were many girls. There were also the maids who had “violated” me, and it is no exaggeration to say I grew up playing exclusively with girls. Yet, despite that, when I was with women I always behaved as though I were walking on thin ice. They seemed to me almost completely beyond understanding. I stumbled about blindly, sometimes accidentally treading on the tail of the tiger and suffering a terrible mauling as a result. Unlike the beatings I received at the hands of men, however, these wounds did not show. Like a kind of internal bleeding, they attacked me from the inside and in the most unpleasant manner imaginable. Such wounds were long and difficult to heal."

その家には、五十すぎの小母さんと、三十くらいの、眼鏡をかけて、病身らしい背の高い姉娘（この娘は、いちどよそへお嫁に行って、それからまた、家へ帰っているひとでした。自分は、このひとを、ここの家のひとたちにならって、アネサと呼んでいました）それと、最近女学校を卒業したばかりらしい、セッちゃんという姉に似ず背が低く丸顔の妹娘と、三人だけの家族で、下の店には、文房具やら運動用具を少々並べていましたが、主な収入は、なくなった主人が建てて残して行った五六棟の長屋の家賃のようでした。,"At that house, there was a little mother who was over fifty, and about thirty, tall sisters and daughters who seemed to be sick. I used to call this person Anesa, following the people in this house.) Also, he seems to have just graduated from a girls' school recently, and he is as tall as his sister, Setchan. A family of only three people, a low-faced sister and daughter, had a few stationery and exercise equipment lined up in the store below, but the main income was the 56 buildings that the lost husband built and left behind. It was like the rent of a row house.","The household consisted of my aunt, a woman in her fifties, and my two cousins, the older of whom was a tall, frail, bespectacled girl of about thirty (she had been married at one time but was later separated), and the younger a short, round-faced girl who looked fresh out of high school. The ground floor of the house was given over to a shop where small quantities of stationery supplies and sporting goods were offered for sale, but the principal source of income wag the rent from the five or six tenements built by my late uncle.","There were only three other people in the house. My aunt in her fifties, her elder daughter, about thirty, wearing glasses, tall and sickly looking (apparently she’d been married once but had since returned home. I followed the others’ example and called her Sis) and, lastly, the younger daughter called “Setchan,” who had only just graduated from a women’s college and who, unlike her sister, was short and round-faced. They ran a small shop on the first floor that sold stationery, balls, and bats and the like, but most of their money came from the rent on the five or six row houses that my aunt’s late husband had left them."

それから三年と少し経ち、自分はその間にそのテツという老女中に数度へんな犯され方をして、時たま夫婦喧嘩げんかみたいな事をはじめ、胸の病気のほうは一進一退、瘦せたりふとったり、血痰けったんが出たり、きのう、テツにカルモチンを買っておいで、と言って、村の薬屋にお使いにやったら、いつもの箱と違う形の箱のカルモチンを買って来て、べつに自分も気にとめず、寝る前に十錠のんでも一向に眠くならないので、おかしいなと思っているうちに、おなかの具合がへんになり急いで便所へ行ったら猛烈な下痢で、しかも、それから引続き三度も便所にかよったのでした。不審に堪えず、薬の箱をよく見ると、それはヘノモチンという下剤でした。,"A little over three years later, during that time, I was raped several times by an old woman named Tetsu, and sometimes I started to have a couple fighting, and my chest illness went on and off, and I got sick. I got bloody diarrhea, and yesterday, I bought carmotin for Tetsu, and when I went to the village drugstore to use it, I bought a carmotin in a box with a different shape from the usual box, and I was sick. I didn't mind, and even if I took 10 tablets before going to bed, I didn't get sleepy at all, so while I was thinking it was strange, I got sick and hurried to the toilet, and I had severe diarrhea, and then continued. I went to the toilet three times. I couldn't stand the suspicion, and when I looked closely at the medicine box, it was a laxative called henomotin.","Some three years have gone by since then. During this interval I have several times been violated in a curious manner by the old servant. Once in a while we quarrel like husband and wife. My chest ailment is sometimes better, sometimes worse; my weight fluctuates accordingly. Occasionally I cough blood. Yesterday I sent Tetsu (the old servant) off to the village drugstore to buy some sleeping pills. She came back with a box rather different in shape from the one I'm accustomed to, but I paid it no particular attention. I took ten pills before I went to bed but was surprised not to be able to sleep at all. Presently I was seized with a cramp in my stomach. I rushed to the toilet three times in succession with terrible diarrhoea. My suspicions were aroused. I examined the box of medicine carefully—it was a laxative.","Sometimes we argue like an old married couple. Sometimes my lung disease worsens, sometimes it improves. I grow thinner and I grow fatter. Sometimes I cough up blood. Yesterday I sent Tetsu to the pharmacy to buy me a box of Carmotine, my usual sedative. The box she brought back was different from the usual one, but I didn’t take particular note of it. Though I took ten tablets before going to bed I still didn’t feel at all sleepy. Just as I started to wonder at this, my stomach suddenly started rumbling, and, rushing to the toilet, I suffered a terrible attack of diarrhea. I had to run to the toilet three more times that night. Growing suspicious, I looked at the box more carefully and saw that it was actually Crapotine, a laxative."

Then I would have followed the instructions. However, because of the cautious way of saying the flounder, I was strangely twisted and my direction of life changed.","Only later did I learn that this in fact was the situation. If I had been told that, I should probably have done what Flatfish asked. But thanks to his intolerably prudent, circumlocutions manner of speech, I only felt irritable, and this caused the whole course of my life to be altered.","As I discovered much later, that is precisely how things stood. Had I known, I certainly would’ve done as I was told. It was Flounder’s wary, roundabout manner of speaking that made everything sound strangely complicated, and, as a result, the direction of my life changed completely."

自分の飲酒は、次第に量がふえて来ました。高円寺駅附近だけでなく、新宿、銀座のほうにまで出かけて飲み、外泊する事さえあり、ただもう「慣例しきたり」に従わぬよう、バアで無頼漢の振りをしたり、片端からキスしたり、つまり、また、あの情死以前の、いや、あの頃よりさらに荒すさんで野卑な酒飲みになり、金に窮して、シヅ子の衣類を持ち出すほどになりました。,"The amount of my drinking has gradually increased.

しかし、自分は、彼の言う事に一向に敬意を感じませんでした。馬鹿なひとだ、絵も下手にちがいない、しかし、遊ぶのには、いい相手かも知れないと考えました。つまり、自分はその時、生れてはじめて、ほんものの都会の与太者を見たのでした。それは、自分と形は違っていても、やはり、この世の人間の営みから完全に遊離してしまって、戸迷いしている点に於いてだけは、たしかに同類なのでした。そうして、彼はそのお道化を意識せずに行い、しかも、そのお道化の悲惨に全く気がついていないのが、自分と本質的に異色のところでした。,"But I didn't really respect what he said. He's a stupid person, he must be bad at drawing, but I thought he might be a good partner to play with. In other words, at that time, for the first time in my life, I saw a real urban tycoon. Even though it was different in shape from me, it was certainly the same kind only in that it was completely separated from the activities of human beings in this world and was at a loss. Then, he did it without being aware of the clown, and he was completely unaware of the misery of the clown, which was essentially different from himself.","I felt not the least respect for his opinions. I was thinking, ""He's a fool and his paintings are rubbish, but he might be a good person for me to go out with. "" For the first time in my life I had met a genuine city good-for-nothing. No less than myself, though in a different way, he was entirely removed from the activities of the human beings of the world. We were of one species if only in that we were both disoriented. At the same time there was a basic difference in us: he operated without being conscious of his farcicality or, for that matter, without giving any recognition to the misery of that farcicality.","I didn’t pay the slightest attention to his words. I thought he was a bit of an idiot, and no doubt his paintings would be terrible too. For all that, though, he might be a useful companion when it came to having fun. In short, for the very first time in my life, I’d met a real, live city scoundrel. Though we looked different—insofar as we were both cut off from the workings of this world of human beings, inasmuch as we were both confused— we were the same.

鎌倉の事件のために、高等学校からは追放せられ、自分は、ヒラメの家の二階の、三畳の部屋で寝起きして、故郷からは月々、極めて小額の金が、それも直接に自分宛ではなく、ヒラメのところにひそかに送られて来ている様子でしたが、（しかも、それは故郷の兄たちが、父にかくして送ってくれているという形式になっていたようでした）それっきり、あとは故郷とのつながりを全然、断ち切られてしまい、そうして、ヒラメはいつも不機嫌、自分があいそ笑いをしても、笑わず、人間というものはこんなにも簡単に、それこそ手のひらをかえすが如くに変化できるものかと、あさましく、いや、むしろ滑稽に思われるくらいの、ひどい変り様で、,"Exiled from high school due to the Kamakura incident, I woke up in a three-mat room on the second floor of the flounder's house, and a very small amount of money from my hometown every month, even directly myself. It seemed that it was secretly sent to the flounder, not to the address (and it seemed that the brothers in my hometown sent it to my father in this way). After that, the connection with my hometown was cut off at all, and the flounder was always in a bad mood, and even if I laughed, I wouldn't laugh, and human beings would return their palms so easily. I wondered if it could change like this, it was a terrible change that seemed ridiculous, no, rather humorous.","I was expelled from college on account of the incident at Kamakura, and I went to live in a tiny room on the second floor of Flatfish's house. I gathered that minute sums of money were remitted from home every month for my support, never directly to me, but secretly, to Flatfish. (They apparently were sent by my brothers without my father's knowledge.) That was all—every other connection with home was severed. Flatfish was invariably in a bad humor; even if I smiled to make myself agreeable, he would never return the smile.","I was expelled from school as a result of the Kamakura incident and spent my days in a tiny three-mat room on the second floor of Flounder’s house. Each month a meager allowance arrived from home, but even that didn’t reach my hands directly as it was sent in secret to Flounder (my brothers, it seemed, were sending it without my father’s knowledge). All other ties with my family had been completely severed. Though I did my best to ingratiate myself with Flounder, he was forever in a bad mood and never even smiled at me. That people should prove so fickle and change so utterly at the drop of a hat seemed to me more comical than despicable."
自分は、人妻の犯された物語の本を、いろいろ捜して読んでみました。けれども、ヨシ子ほど悲惨な犯され方をしている女は、ひとりも無いと思いました。どだい、これは、てんで物語にも何もなりません。あの小男の商人と、ヨシ子とのあいだに、少しでも恋に似た感情でもあったなら、自分の気持もかえってたすかるかも知れませんが、ただ、夏の一夜、ヨシ子が信頼して、そうして、それっきり、しかもそのために自分の眉間は、まっこうから割られ声が嗄れて若白髪がはじまり、ヨシ子は一生おろおろしなければならなくなったのです。たいていの物語は、その妻の「行為」を夫が許すかどうか、そこに重点を置いていたようでしたが、それは自分にとっては、そんなに苦しい大問題では無いように思われました。許す、許さぬ、そのような権利を留保している夫こそ幸いなる哉かな、とても許す事が出来ぬと思ったなら、何もそんなに大騒ぎせずとも、さっさと妻を離縁して、新しい妻を迎えたらどうだろう、それが出来なかったら、所謂いわゆる「許して」我慢するさ、いずれにしても夫の気持一つで四方八方がまるく収るだろうに、という気さえするのでした。つまり、そのような事件は、たしかに夫にとって大いなるショックであっても、しかし、それは「ショック」であって、いつまでも尽きること無く打ち返し打ち寄せる波と違い、権利のある夫の怒りでもってどうにでも処理できるトラブルのように自分には思われたのでした。けれども、自分たちの場合、夫に何の権利も無く、考えると何もかも自分がわるいような気がして来て、怒るどころか、おこごと一つも言えず、また、その妻は、その所有している稀まれな美質に依って犯されたのです。しかも、その美質は、夫のかねてあこがれの、無垢の信頼心というたまらなく可憐かれんなものなのでした。,"I searched and read various books about the story of a married woman's crime. However, I thought that no woman was as miserable as Yoshiko. After all, this is nothing to tell the story. If there was a feeling of love between that little boy's merchant and Yoshiko, I might have changed my feelings, but on a summer night, Yoshiko trusted me and did so. And that's why my eyebrows were cracked from the bottom, my voice started to scream, and young white hair started, and Yoshiko had to grate for the rest of her life. Most stories seemed to focus on whether the husband allowed the wife's ""acts"", but that didn't seem to be such a painful big issue for me. Forgive, not forgive, my husband who reserves such rights is a happy ya, if you think that you can not forgive very much, you can quickly divorce your wife and make a new wife without making so much noise What if I greeted him, and if I couldn't do that, I would put up with the so-called ""forgiveness"", and in any case, I even felt that my husband's feelings would fit in all directions. In other words, such an incident is certainly a great shock to her husband, but it is a ""shock"", and unlike the wave that rushes back and forth indefinitely, it is handled by the anger of the right husband. It seemed like a trouble I could do. However, in the case of themselves, the husband has no rights, and when he thinks about it, he feels that he is bad, and instead of getting angry, he cannot say anything, and his wife owns it. It was violated by the rare beauty of being. What's more, the beauty was irresistibly pretty, the innocent trust that my husband had longed for.","I looked up various novels in which married women are violated. I tried reading them, but I could not find a single instance of a woman violated in so lamentable a manner as Yoshiko. Her story obviously could never be made into a novel. I might actually have felt better if anything in the least resembling love existed between that runt of a shopkeeper and Yoshiko, but one summer night Yoshiko was trusting, and that was all there was to it . . . And on account of that incident I was cleft between the eyebrows, my voice became hoarse, my hair turned prematurely grey, and Yoshiko was condemned to a life of anxiety. In most of the novels I read emphasis was placed on whether or not the husband forgave the wife's ""act. "" It seemed to me, however, that any husband who still retains the right to forgive or not to forgive is a lucky man. If he thinks that he can't possibly forgive his wife, he ought, instead of making such a great fuss, to get divorced as quickly as possible and find a new wife. If he can't do that he should forgive and show forbearance. In either case the matter can be completely settled in whichever way the husband's feelings dictate. In other words, even though such an incident certainly comes as a great shock to the husband, it is a shock and not an endless series of waves which lash back at him over and over again. It seemed to me a problem which could be disposed of by the wrath of any husband with authority. But in our case the husband was without authority, and when I thought things over, I came to feel that everything was my fault. Far from becoming enraged, I could not utter a word of complaint; it was on account of that rare virtue she possessed that my wife was violated, a virtue I long had prized, the unbearably pitiful one called immaculate trustfulness.","I read every story I could find featuring wives who were violated. Yet, not one of them had been so cruelly violated as Yoshiko. There was nothing, not the slightest element of fiction about it. My suffering might have been eased somewhat had there been anything even faintly resembling love between Yoshiko and the shopkeeper, but, in the end, it came down to one summer night when Yoshiko trusted someone and that was all there was to it. And so my head seemed to shatter, my voice grew hoarse, my hair turned gray before its time, and Yoshiko trembled in fear the rest of her life. Most of the stories I read focused on whether or not the husband would forgive his wife’s “deeds,” but that wasn’t such a terribly important point for me. Happy indeed, I thought, is the husband who has the right to decide whether or not to forgive. If he deems the offense unforgivable there’s no need for a fuss , he simply divorces her out of hand and finds a new wife. Or, if he can’t do that, he “forgives” her and endures. In either case, everything is arranged to suit the husband’s feelings. That is, while it no doubt comes as quite a shock to the husband, in the end it is for all that nothing more than a “shock”—not something one returns to over and over again, endlessly, like the pounding of waves on the shore. It is, I thought, the kind of problem that, one way or the other, could be resolved by a husband’s righteous anger. Yet, in my case, I possessed none of the rights of the husband, and the more I considered it, the more it seemed to me that everything was my fault. Far from being angry with her, I dared not utter the slightest word of reproach. Indeed, it was because she possessed such rare virtue that she had been violated. It was that virtue, that pure and innocent trust, long admired, that her husband had found so unutterably endearing."
自分は仰向けに寝て、おなかに湯たんぽを載せながら、テツにこごとを言ってやろうと思いました。,"I thought I'd lie on my back, put a hot water bottle on my stomach, and tell Tetsu about it.","As I lay on my bed staring at the ceiling, a hot water bottle on my stomach, I wondered whether I ought to complain to Tetsu.

などと、これもまた久し振りで逢った者同志のおきまりの挨拶を交し、それから、二人に共通の知人のその後の消息をたずね合ったりして、そのうちに、ふとマダムは口調を改め、あなたは葉ちゃんを知っていたかしら、と言う。それは知らない、と答えると、マダムは、奥へ行って、三冊のノートブックと、三葉の写真を持って来て私に手渡し、,"And so on, we exchanged greetings from the comrades we met for the first time in a long time, and then asked for the subsequent fate of an acquaintance common to the two, and in the meantime, Madame suddenly changed his tone. I wonder if you knew Ha-chan. When he replied that he didn't know it, Madame went to the back and handed me three notebooks and a photo of Mitsuha.","We exchanged these and other greetings appropriate to long-separated friends and asked for news of mutual acquaintances. The madam suddenly broke off to ask, in a rather different tone, if by chance I had ever known Yozo. I answered that I never had, whereupon she went inside and brought out three notebooks and three photographs which she handed to me.","We continued in this vein for a little while, exchanging the sort of pleasantries you’d expect to hear from two companions meeting after a long absence.

などと、はげしい事を口走っては、また泣くのでした。けれども、自分には、女から、こんな態度を見せつけられるのは、これが最初ではありませんでしたので、アネサの過激な言葉にも、さして驚かず、かえってその陳腐、無内容に興が覚めた心地で、そっと蒲団から脱け出し、机の上の柿をむいて、その一きれをアネサに手渡してやりました。すると、アネサは、しゃくり上げながらその柿を食べ、,"I cried again when I said something terrible. However, this was not the first time that a woman could show such an attitude to me, so I wasn't surprised by the radical words of Anesa. I gently escaped from the futon, peeled the persimmon on the desk, and handed a piece of it to Anesa. Then Anesa ate the persimmon while sucking up,","She continued in this hysterical vein for a while only to burst into tears again. This was not the first time that a woman had put on such a scene before me, and Sister's excessively emotional words did not surprise me much. I felt instead a certain boredom at their banality and emptiness. I slipped out of bed, went to my desk and picked up a persimmon. I peeled it and offered Sister a section.","She went on and on like this, raving and weeping in turn. This wasn’t the first time I’d been exposed to a woman in such a state, so I wasn’t terribly surprised at the violence of her words. On the contrary, I found her trite, empty theatrics rather tedious, and, slipping out from under my blankets, I walked over to my desk, peeled a persimmon, and handed her a slice."
無心の声でしたが、これがまた、じんと骨身にこたえるほどに痛かったのです。はじめて自分が、恋したひとの声だけに、痛かったのです。それだけも、これだけもない、銅銭三枚は、どだいお金でありません。それは、自分が未いまだかつて味わった事の無い奇妙な屈辱でした。とても生きておられない屈辱でした。所詮しょせんその頃の自分は、まだお金持ちの坊ちゃんという種属から脱し切っていなかったのでしょう。その時、自分は、みずからすすんでも死のうと、実感として決意したのです。,"It was a heartless voice, but it was also painful enough to respond to my bones. For the first time, I was hurt only by the voice of the person I fell in love with. Three bronze coins, which are neither that nor this, are not money. It was a strange humiliation I had never experienced before. It was a humiliation that I couldn't live very much. After all, at that time, I probably hadn't completely escaped from the genus of rich boys. At that time, I decided to realize that I would die even if I was willing to die.","Her voice was innocent, but it cut me to the quick. It was painful as only the voice of the first woman I had ever loved could be painful. ""Is that all?""No, even that suggested more money than I had—three copper coins don't count as money at all. This was a humiliation more strange than any I had tasted before, a humiliation I could not live with. I suppose I had still not managed to extricate myself from the part of the rich man's son. It was then I myself determined, this time as a reality, to kill myself.","She spoke innocently enough, yet even so, pain pierced me to the bone. It was the first time that the mere voice of someone I loved caused me pain. Whether or not it was all I had didn’t matter. Those three coins weren’t money. They were a special kind of humiliation, one I’d never tasted before. An unendurable humiliation. I suppose that I hadn’t yet managed to get away from thinking of myself as a “rich boy.” At that moment, now fully aware of what it meant, I resolved to seek my own death."
しかし、自分は、所謂「将来の方針」を、堀木ごときに、相談に行こうなどと本気に思って、ヒラメの家を出たのでは無かったのでした。それは、ただ、わずかでも、つかのまでも、ヒラメに安心させて置きたくて、（その間に自分が、少しでも遠くへ逃げのびていたいという探偵小説的な策略から、そんな置手紙を書いた、というよりは、いや、そんな気持も幽かすかにあったに違いないのですが、それよりも、やはり自分は、いきなりヒラメにショックを与え、彼を混乱当惑させてしまうのが、おそろしかったばかりに、とでも言ったほうが、いくらか正確かも知れません。どうせ、ばれるにきまっているのに、そのとおりに言うのが、おそろしくて、必ず何かしら飾りをつけるのが、自分の哀しい性癖の一つで、それは世間の人が「噓つき」と呼んで卑しめている性格に似ていながら、しかし、自分は自分に利益をもたらそうとしてその飾りつけを行った事はほとんど無く、ただ雰囲気ふんいきの興覚めた一変が、窒息するくらいにおそろしくて、後で自分に不利益になるという事がわかっていても、れいの自分の「必死の奉仕」それはたといゆがめられ微弱で、馬鹿らしいものであろうと、その奉仕の気持から、つい一言の飾りつけをしてしまうという場合が多かったような気もするのですが、しかし、この習性もまた、世間の所謂「正直者」たちから、大いに乗ぜられるところとなりました）その時、ふっと、記憶の底から浮んで来たままに堀木の住所と姓名を、用箋の端にしたためたまでの事だったのです。,"However, I didn't leave the flatfish house because I was seriously thinking about going to consult with Horiki about the so-called ""future policy"". It is said that he wrote such a letter because he wanted to leave the flounder with peace of mind, even if only a little, (in the meantime, he wrote such a letter from a detective novel strategy that he wanted to escape as far as possible. Rather, no, I must have had such a feeling, but more than that, it was just scary that I suddenly shocked the flounder and confused him. But it may be a little more accurate to say. Anyway, it's scary to say exactly, and it's one of my sad habits to always decorate something, even though it's decided to be exposed. Although it resembles the character that people call ""suffocation"" and humbles it, I rarely decorated it in an attempt to benefit myself, and it was just a change in the atmosphere. But even if he knew that he was suffocating and would be detrimental to him later, Rei's own ""desperate service"", whether it was distorted, weak, or stupid, was that service. From my feelings, I feel that I often end up decorating with just one word, but this habit has also become a big part of the so-called ""honesty"" in the world. At that time, I suddenly suffocated the address and surname of Horiki at the end of the letter while floating from the bottom of my memory.","When I left Flatfish's house, however, I was certainly not seriously entertaining any idea of consulting the likes of Horiki about my future plans. I left the note hoping thereby to pacify Flatfish for a little while, if only for a split-second. (I didn't write the note so much out of a detective-story stratagem to gain a little more time for my escape—though, I must admit that the desire was at least faintly present—as to avoid causing Flatfish a sudden shock which would send him into a state of wild alarm and confusion. I think that might be a somewhat more accurate presentation of my motives. I knew that the facts were certain to be discovered, but I was afraid to state them as they were. One of my tragic flaws is the compulsion to add some sort of embellishment to every situation—a quality which has made people call me at times a liar—but I have almost never embellished in order to bring myself any advantage; it was rather that I had a strangulating fear of that cataclysmic change in the atmosphere the instant the flow of a conversation flagged, and even when I knew that it would later turn to my disadvantage , I frequently felt obliged to add, almost inadvertently, my word of embellishment, out of a desire to please born of my usual desperate mania for service. This may have been a twisted form of my weakness, an idiocy, but the habit it engendered was taken full advantage of by the so-called honest citizens of the world.) That was how I happened to jot down Horiki's name and address as they floated up from the distant recesses of my memory.","I wasn’t really intending to discuss my so-called “plans for the future” with the likes of Horiki. I only wrote that to put Flounder’s mind at ease, even if only for a little while (not in the hope of “throwing him off my scent” like you’d see in a detective novel— well no, I’m sure that must have been a consideration, though only a very slight one—rather, better to say I was terrified that Flounder, shocked by my sudden disappearance, would grow confused, violently agitated. It was a typical, pathetic tendency of mine. I know from the start I’ll be found out but I’m too timid to tell the truth so I always dress it up. I’m not unlike those creatures that society reviles as “liars,” but I hardly ever seek to conceal the truth out of a desire for personal gain. I almost always act out of desperation, on the spur of the moment, when a sudden chill descends on a room and I feel like I’m suffocating. I know I will pay for it later but when my desperate “need to please” rears its head I’m suddenly adding some strange, feeble, idiotic embellishment or other. I’ve been much criticized for this by the so-called “honest people” of the world), and Horiki’s name just popped into my head"

The non-honored prophecy of being in love was correct, but the blessing prophecy of being a great painting was missed.","One of Takeichi's predictions came true, the other went astray. The inglorious prophecy that women would fall for me turned out just as he said, but the happy one, that I should certainly become a great artist, failed to materialize.","One of Takeichi’s predictions came true, the other did not.

つまり自分には、人間の営みというものが未いまだに何もわかっていない、という事になりそうです。自分の幸福の観念と、世のすべての人たちの幸福の観念とが、まるで食いちがっているような不安、自分はその不安のために夜々、転輾てんてんし、呻吟しんぎんし、発狂しかけた事さえあります。自分は、いったい幸福なのでしょうか。自分は小さい時から、実にしばしば、仕合せ者だと人に言われて来ましたが、自分ではいつも地獄の思いで、かえって、自分を仕合せ者だと言ったひとたちのほうが、比較にも何もならぬくらいずっとずっと安楽なように自分には見えるのです。,"In other words, it seems that I still do not know anything about human activities. The anxiety that my idea of happiness and the idea of happiness of all the people in the world seem to be eating up, and because of that anxiety, I changed, groaned, and went mad at night. There are even things. Am I really happy? From a young age, people have often told me that I'm an assassin, but I'm always in hell, and the people who say I'm an assassin are better for comparison. It seems to me that it's so much easier than ever.","In other words, you might say that I still have no understanding of what makes human beings tick. My apprehension on discovering that my concept of happiness seemed to be completely at variance with that of everyone else was so great as to make me toss sleeplessly and groan night after night in my bed. It drove me indeed to the brink of lunacy. I wonder if I have actually been happy. People have told me, really more times than I can remember, ever since I was a small boy, how lucky I was, but I have always felt as if I were suffering in hell. It has seemed to me in fact that those who called me lucky were incomparably more fortunate than I.","Nothing seemed more impenetrable, incomprehensible, or menacing to me than this. It seems that I will end my days having never understood anything at all about the lives of human beings. I fear my idea of happiness is completely at odds with everyone else’s idea of happiness. This fear consumes me, sometimes making me twist and turn at night, groaning in agony, driving me to the brink of madness. Am I happy? Ever since I was a small child people have been telling me how fortunate I am, but, for my part, I felt like I was in hell, and the ones saying I was fortunate seemed incomparably and immeasurably happier than I was.

海の、波打際、といってもいいくらいに海にちかい岸辺に、真黒い樹肌の山桜の、かなり大きいのが二十本以上も立ちならび、新学年がはじまると、山桜は、褐色のねばっこいような嫩葉わかばと共に、青い海を背景にして、その絢爛けんらんたる花をひらき、やがて、花吹雪の時には、花びらがおびただしく海に散り込み、海面を鏤ちりばめて漂い、波に乗せられ再び波打際に打ちかえされる、その桜の砂浜が、そのまま校庭として使用せられている東北の或る中学校に、自分は受験勉強もろくにしなかったのに、どうやら無事に入学できました。そうして、その中学の制帽の徽章きしょうにも、制服のボタンにも、桜の花が図案化せられて咲いていました。,"On the shore near the sea, on the shore of the sea, there are more than 20 large black cherry trees, and when the new school year begins, the cherry blossoms are brown. Along with the sticky beach, the gorgeous flowers are opened against the background of the blue sea, and in the event of a snowstorm, the petals are scattered in the sea, drifting on the surface of the sea and riding on the waves. Apparently, I was able to enter a junior high school in Tohoku, where the sandy beach of the cherry blossoms, which was replaced by the beach again, was used as a school yard, even though I didn't make studying for the exam fragile. Then, the cherry blossoms were designed and bloomed on the emblem of the cap of the junior high school and on the buttons of the uniform.","On the shore, at a point so close to the ocean one might imagine it was there that the waves broke, stood a row of over twenty fairly tall cherry trees with coal-black trunks. Every April when the new school year was about to begin these trees would display their dazzling blossoms and their moist brown leaves against the blue of the sea. Soon a snowstorm of blossoms would scatter innumerable petals into the water, flecking the surface with points of white which the waves carried back to the shore. This beach strewn with cherry blossoms served as the playground of the high school I attended. Stylized cherry blossoms flowered even on the badge of the regulation school cap and on the buttons of our uniforms.","A score or more of towering, black-barked cherry trees lined the shore, so close to the water that the waves seemed to lap at their roots. At the start of the new school year their blossoms burst forth, a dazzling pink against the blue of the sea and the rust brown of sticky, newly sprouted leaves. The countless blossoms scattered in a blizzard of petals to form a heaving tapestry atop the surface of the sea, pulled away with each wave only to come crashing back to shore again. Despite neglecting my studies I had somehow managed to gain admittance to a middle school in Japan’s northeast, and this petal-strewn beach was part of its grounds. The figure of these flowers blossomed on the badge of our school caps and even on each button of our uniforms."

The photographs, however, fascinated me, and I decided after all to accept the notebooks. I promised to stop by again on the way back, and asked her if she happened to know where my friend lived. As a fellow newcomer, she knew him. Sometimes, in fact, he even patronized her shop. His house was just a few steps away.","Normally I find it impossible to write about material that someone else has foisted on me, and I was about to hand the journals back when the photos caught my eye (I describe these very peculiar photos in the preface), so I took the journals and told her I would stop by again on my way home. I asked if she knew the lecturer at the woman’s college at such and such an address and it turned out that she did, being a newly established resident herself. He lived just down the street and even stopped by the coffee shop from time to time."

Her younger sister, Setchan, would even bring friends to my room, and in my usual fashion I amused them all with perfect impartiality.","She wasn’t the only woman who confused me. All women did. Trying to figure out what was going through their minds as they led their lives was more complicated, more troublesome, and more unsettling than trying to discern the thoughts of an earthworm.

She’d start to feel better once she ate."

I think that the beauty of a virgin is just a sweet sentimental illusion of a stupid poet However, it is still alive in this world, and when we got married and it was spring, we decided to go to see Aoba Falls by bicycle on the spot, so-called ""one game"". , Did not hesitate to steal the flower.","Yoshiko's pale face was smiling as she sat there inside the dimly lit shop. What a holy thing uncorrupted virginity is, I thought. I had never slept with a virgin, a girl younger than myself. I'd marry her. I wanted once in my lifetime to know that great savage joy, no matter how immense the suffering that might ensue. I had always imagined that the beauty of virginity was nothing more than the sweet, sentimental illusion of stupid poets, but it really is alive and present in this world. We would get married. In the spring we'd go together on bicycles to see waterfalls framed in green leaves. I made up my mind on the spot: it was a then-and-there decision, and I did not hesitate to steal the flower.","I stood there gazing at her pale, smiling face, glowing in the dim light of the shop. How precious, I thought. This unsullied virginity. I’d never slept with a virgin younger than myself before. We should marry. Let whatever sadness comes, come, I don’t care how terrible it is. Just once in my life I want to feel a great, violent joy. I’d always thought that “beautiful virginity” was simply a sentimental conceit employed by feeble-minded poets, but now I could see that it really did exist. In that instant I decided we’d marry, and in the springtime we’d ride our bicycles to a waterfall deep in the forest. It was an all-or-nothing bet, so, without a moment’s hesitation, I stretched out my hand and snatched the flower."

I have already obtained various observations about females, such as those who may be alive in Japan, since I was a child, and although they seem to be the same human beings, they are completely different from males. It felt like a mere creature, and again, this mysterious and alert creature bite me strangely. The words ""loved"" and ""liked"" are not suitable for me at all, and it may be better to say ""bitten"" to explain the actual situation. ..","Women led me on only to throw me aside; they mocked and tortured me when others were around, only to embrace me with passion as soon as everyone had left. Women sleep so soundly they seem to be dead. Who knows? Women may live in order to sleep. These and various other generalizations were products of an observation of women since boyhood days, but my conclusion was that though women appear to belong to the same species as man, they are actually quite different creatures, and these incomprehensible, insidious beings have, fantastic as it seems, always looked after me. In my case such an expression as ""to be fallen for"" or even ""to be loved"" is not in the least appropriate; perhaps it describes the situation more accurately to say that I was ""looked after. ""","Women clasp me to them only to thrust me away. When others are around they scorn me and treat me cruelly, but the moment we are alone they cling to me. They sleep deeply, like the dead. I sometimes wonder if women live only to sleep. I’d made many observations about women, even when I was young. Though they were of the same species I could not help but think of women as altogether different from men, and, oddly, these enigmatic, mercurial creatures cared for me. To say that they “fell for me” or that they “loved me” would not, in my case, be accurate. It is more apt, I think, to say they “cared for me.”"
忘れも、しません。むし暑い夏の夜でした。堀木は日暮頃、よれよれの浴衣を着て築地の自分のアパートにやって来て、きょう或る必要があって夏服を質入したが、その質入が老母に知れるとまことに具合いが悪い、すぐ受け出したいから、とにかく金を貸してくれ、という事でした。あいにく自分のところにも、お金が無かったので、例に依って、ヨシ子に言いつけ、ヨシ子の衣類を質屋に持って行かせてお金を作り、堀木に貸しても、まだ少し余るのでその残金でヨシ子に焼酎しょうちゅうを買わせ、アパートの屋上に行き、隅田川から時たま幽かに吹いて来るどぶ臭い風を受けて、まことに薄汚い納涼の宴を張りました。,"I will never forget it. It was a hot summer night. Around Higurashi, Horiki came to his apartment in Tsukiji wearing a shabby yukata and pledged summer clothes for some reason today, but when the pledge was known to his old mother, he was really sick and immediately received it. I wanted to lend you some money anyway. Unfortunately, I didn't have any money, so as usual, I told Yoshiko, took Yoshiko's clothes to a pawn shop to make money, and lent it to Horiki, but there was still a little left over, so the balance. So I asked Yoshiko to buy shochu shochu, went to the rooftop of the apartment, and received the smoky breeze that occasionally blew from the Sumida River, and set up a really dingy cool party.","I shall never forget. It was a sticky hot summer's night. Horiki had come to my apartment about dusk wearing a tattered summer kimono. He told me that an emergency had come up and he had been obliged to pawn his summer suit. He asked me to lend him some money because he was anxious to redeem the suit before his aged mother found out. The matter apparently concerned him genuinely. As ill luck would have it, I hadn't any money at my place. As usual I sent Yoshiko oat to the pawnshop with some of her clothes. I lent Horiki what he needed from the money she received, but there was still a little left over, and I asked Yoshiko to buy some gin with it. We went up on the roof of the apartment house, where we celebrated the evening cool with a dismal little party. Faint miasmic gusts of wind blew in from the river every now and then.","I will never forget. It was a hot, muggy summer evening. Sometime around sunset Horiki showed up at our apartment wearing a threadbare yukata. Due to “various circumstances” he’d pawned his summer clothes, but there would be trouble if his mother found out so he needed to redeem them as soon as possible and would I lend him the money? Unfortunately, we didn’t have any money either, so, as was my usual practice, I sent Yoshiko off to pawn some of her clothes and, as the sum she received was slightly more than what Horiki required, I had her buy some shōchū liquor with the rest and we went up to the roof where we bathed in the feeble, muddy breeze that occasionally wafted in from the Sumida River and held a thoroughly squalid summer banquet."

I have no idea what the nature and extent of the suffering of my neighbor is. Practical suffering, just the suffering that can be solved by eating rice, but that is the strongest pain, and it may be a terrible madness hell that blows away the ten evils of my example. I don't know, but for that, I don't often commit suicide, I don't go mad, I discuss political parties, I don't despair, I don't give in, and I can continue to struggle with my life, isn't it painful? Becoming an egoist, and convinced that it was a matter of course, haven't you ever doubted yourself? Then it's easy, but I don't know if all human beings are like that, and I don't know ... I wonder if they sleep soundly at night and feel refreshed in the morning, what kind of dreams do they have? What are you thinking while walking down the road, money? I think I've heard the theory that human beings live to eat rice, but that's not the only thing, but the word that they live for money is heard. I've never done it, no, but depending on it ... no, I don't know ... the more I think about it, the more I don't understand it, and I feel anxiety and fear that I'm completely different. It's just being attacked. I can hardly talk to my neighbor. I don't know what to say or how to say it.","I simply don't understand. I have not the remotest clue what the nature or extent of my neighbor's woes can be. Practical troubles, griefs that can be assuaged if only there is enough to eat—these may be the most intense of all burning hells, horrible enough to blast to smithereens my ten misfortunes, but that is precisely what I don't understand: if my neighbors manage to survive without killing themselves, without going mad, maintaining an interest in political parties, not yielding to despair, resolutely pursuing the fight for existence, can their griefs really be genuine? Am I wrong in thinking that these people have become such complete egoists and are so convinced of the normality of their way of life that they have never once doubted themselves? If that is the case, their sufferings should be easy to bear: they are the common lot of human beings and perhaps the best one can hope for. I don't know . . . If you've slept soundly at night the morning is exhilarating, I suppose. What kind of dreams do they have? What do they think about when they walk along the street? Money? Hardly—it couldn't only be that. I seem to have heard the theory advanced that human beings live in order to cat, but I've never heard anyone say that they lived in order to make money. No. And yet, in some instances. . . . No, I don't even know that. . . . The more I think of it, the less I understand. All I feel are the assaults of apprehension and terror at the thought that I am the only one who is entirely unlike the rest. It is almost impossible for me to converse with other people. What should I talk about, how should I say it?—I don't know.","In the end, I just don’t understand. I cannot understand the kind or degree of suffering that other people experience. Perhaps their “practical” suffering, the kind relieved by eating, is in fact the most extreme form of suffering—perhaps it is a suffering so ghastly, like the tortures of the deepest circles of hell, that my “dozen curses” pale to insignificance beside it. I don’t know. Yet, if that were the case, how do they endure it? How do they make it through each day without succumbing, without despairing, without committing suicide, even as they go on arguing about politics? Could they be such thoroughgoing egotists, so certain that this is the way things are supposed to be, that they have never once doubted themselves? If so, I suppose it might be easier to bear. I wonder if that is simply the way human beings are and that that is what makes them happy. I just don’t know. . . . I wonder if they sleep soundly at night, if they awake refreshed in the morning. What do they dream about? What are they thinking about when they are walking down the street? Money? Surely that can’t be the only thing. I recall someone saying that people live to eat, but I’ve never heard anyone say that people live for money. Yet, in the right circumstances . . . But, no, I don’t understand that either. . . .

自分は世の中に対して、次第に用心しなくなりました。世の中というところは、そんなに、おそろしいところでは無い、と思うようになりました。つまり、これまでの自分の恐怖感は、春の風には百日咳ひゃくにちぜきの黴菌ばいきんが何十万、銭湯には、目のつぶれる黴菌が何十万、床屋には禿頭とくとう病の黴菌が何十万、省線の吊皮つりかわには疥癬かいせんの虫がうようよ、または、おさしみ、牛豚肉の生焼けには、さなだ虫の幼虫やら、ジストマやら、何やらの卵などが必ずひそんでいて、また、はだしで歩くと足の裏からガラスの小さい破片がはいって、その破片が体内を駈けめぐり眼玉を突いて失明させる事もあるとかいう謂わば「科学の迷信」におびやかされていたようなものなのでした。それは、たしかに何十万もの黴菌の浮び泳ぎうごめいているのは、「科学的」にも、正確な事でしょう。と同時に、その存在を完全に黙殺さえすれば、それは自分とみじんのつながりも無くなってたちまち消え失せる「科学の幽霊」に過ぎないのだという事をも、自分は知るようになったのです。お弁当箱に食べ残しのごはん三粒、千万人が一日に三粒ずつ食べ残しても既にそれは、米何俵をむだに捨てた事になる、とか、或いは、一日に鼻紙一枚の節約を千万人が行うならば、どれだけのパルプが浮くか、などという「科学的統計」に、自分は、どれだけおびやかされ、ごはんを一粒でも食べ残す度毎に、また鼻をかむ度毎に、山ほどの米、山ほどのパルプを空費するような錯覚に悩み、自分がいま重大な罪を犯しているみたいな暗い気持になったものですが、しかし、それこそ「科学の噓」「統計の噓」「数学の噓」で、三粒のごはんは集められるものでなく、掛算割算の応用問題としても、まことに原始的で低能なテーマで、電気のついてない暗いお便所の、あの穴に人は何度にいちど片脚を踏みはずして落下させるか、または、省線電車の出入口と、プラットホームの縁へりとのあの隙間に、乗客の何人中の何人が足を落とし込むか、そんなプロバビリティを計算するのと同じ程度にばからしく、それは如何いかにも有り得る事のようでもありながら、お便所の穴をまたぎそこねて怪我をしたという例は、少しも聞かないし、そんな仮説を「科学的事実」として教え込まれ、それを全く現実として受取り、恐怖していた昨日までの自分をいとおしく思い、笑いたく思ったくらいに、自分は、世の中というものの実体を少しずつ知って来たというわけなのでした。,"I gradually became less cautious about the world. I have come to think that the world is not so scary. In other words, my fears so far have been hundreds of thousands of whooping cough and larvae in the spring breeze, hundreds of thousands of blind-eyed scabies in public baths, and scabies in barbers. Hundreds of thousands of fungi, scabies scabies on the scabies of the provincial line, or scabies, larvae of scabies, dystomas, eggs, etc. However, when you walk with your bare feet, small pieces of glass may enter from the soles of your feet, and the pieces may scabies in your body and pierce your eyes, causing blindness. It was like being scared. It is certainly ""scientifically"" accurate that hundreds of thousands of fungi are floating and swimming. At the same time, I also learned that if I completely silenced its existence, it would be nothing more than a ""ghost of science"" that would lose its connection with me and disappear immediately. Three grains of leftover rice in the lunch box, even if 10 million people leave three grains a day, it means that they have already thrown away a bale of rice, or one piece of tissue paper a day. ""Scientific statistics"" such as how much pulp will float if 10 million people save money, I am scared of how much, every time I leave a grain of rice, I sniff again Every time I chewed, I was worried about the illusion of wasting a lot of rice and a lot of pulp, and I felt like I was guilty of a serious crime. In ""Science"", ""Statistics"", and ""Mathematics"", three grains of rice are not collected, and even as an application problem of multiplication and division, it is a very primitive and incompetent theme, and it is dark without electricity. How many times a person steps off one leg and drops it in that hole in the toilet, or how many of the passengers put their feet in the gap between the doorway of the provincial train and the edge of the platform. It's as ridiculous as dropping it or calculating such probabilities, and while it seems like it's possible, I've never heard of an example of being injured by missing a hole in a toilet, and that hypothesis. Was taught as a ""scientific fact"", and I took it as a reality, and I was so scared that I felt lonely and laughed at myself until yesterday. That's why.","I gradually came to relax my vigilance towards the world. I came to think that it was not such a dreadful place. My feelings of panic had been molded by the unholy fear aroused in me by such superstitions of science as the hundreds of thousands of whooping-cough germs borne by the spring breezes, the hundreds of thousands of eye-destroying bacteria which infest the public baths, the hundreds of thousands of microbes in a barber shop which will cause baldness, the swarms of scabious parasites infecting the leather straps in the subway cars; or the tapeworm, fluke and heaven knows what eggs that undoubtedly lurk in raw fish and in undercooked beef and pork; or the fact that if you walk barefoot a tiny sliver of glass may penetrate the sole of your foot and after circulating through your body reach the eye and cause blindness. There is no disputing the accurate, scientific fact that millions of germs are floating, swimming, wriggling everywhere. At the same time, however, if you ignore them completely they lose all possible connection with yourself, and at once become nothing more than vanishing ""ghosts of science. "" This too I came to understand. I had been so terrorized by scientific statistics (if ten million people each leave over three grains of rice from their lunch, how many sacks of rice are wasted in one day; if ten million people each economize one paper handkerchief a day, how much pulp will be saved?) that whenever I left over a single grain of rice, whenever I blew my nose, I imagined that I was wasting mountains of rice, tons of paper, and I fell prey to a mood dark as if I had committed some terrible crime. But these were the lies of science, the lies of statistics and mathematics: you can't collect three grains of rice from everybody. Even as an exercise in multiplication or division, it ranks as one of the most elementary and feeble-minded problems, about on a par with the computation of the percentage of times that people slip in dark, unlighted bathrooms and fall into the toilet, or the percentage of passengers who get their feet caught in the space between the door of a subway train and the edge of the platform, or other such footling exercises in probability. These events seem entirely within the bounds of possibility, but I have never heard a single instance of anyone hurting himself by falling into the toilet. I felt pity and contempt for the self which until yesterday had accepted such hypothetical situations as eminently factual scientific truths and was terrified by them. This shows the degree to which I had bit by bit arrived at a knowledge of the real nature of what is called the world.","The sense of caution I had maintained toward the world gradually began to fade. It might not be such a terrifying place after all. The terror that had so consumed me before seemed now more like superstition. Like the “scientific myths” that the spring winds carry millions of whooping cough germs, or that the public baths teem with bacteria that make you go blind, the millions of germs in a barbershop that cause baldness, handle straps in trains contaminated with scabies, undercooked pork and beef, sashimi infested with tapeworm, flatworm and so on, that if you stepped barefoot on a tiny shard of glass it would find its way into your bloodstream and put out your eye. “Scientifically,” I am sure there are millions of bacteria floating and swimming about wherever we go. I came to realize, however, that all we needed do was ignore these facts entirely and they lost their hold over us, vanishing entirely in the end, reduced to nothing more than “scientific ghosts.” Just as when people go on about how if you throw away three grains of rice with your lunch and ten million other people do the same then so many bushels of rice are wasted, or when they say that if ten million people conserved just one tissue each day then so many tons of pulp would be saved, and so on. How terrified I used to be of this kind of “scientific accounting.” Whenever I wasted so much as a single grain of rice, each time I blew my nose I was haunted by visions of a mountain of rice, of mountains of pulp going to waste. I grew despondent, as if I’d committed some terrible crime. Yet, in the end, these were but “scientific lies,” “statistical lies,” “mathematical lies.” Nobody was going to go around and collect each of those three grains of rice. Even purely as an intellectual exercise in mathematics it was a silly, primitive notion—no better those idiotic statistics exercises where one calculates the probability of a person tripping in the dark and falling into the toilet or the number of passengers who would get a leg stuck in the gap between train and platform. They sound plausible enough, but I’ve never heard of anyone getting hurt by falling into the toilet. I was gradually learning to see the world for what it was, and I wanted to laugh at myself for having lived in such terror of these hypotheticals, of these “scientific facts” that had been drilled into me and which I had taken as real."

It was because I felt irresistible.","I did not run away because I was mortified at having been lectured by Flatfish. I was, exactly as Flatfish described, a man whose feelings were up in the air, and I had absolutely no idea about future plans or anything else. Besides, I felt rather sorry for Flatfish that I should be a burden on him , and I found it quite intolerably painful to think that if by some remote chance I felt like bestirring myself to achieve a worthy purpose, I should have to depend on poor old Flatfish to dole out each month the capital needed for my rehabilitation.","I wasn’t running away because I felt humiliated by Flounder’s lecture.
