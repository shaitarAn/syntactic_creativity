好奇心もなく、軽けい蔑べつも含まない、彼らが旅芸人という種類の人間であることを忘れてしまったような、私の尋常な好意は、彼らの胸にも沁しみ込んで行くらしかった。私はいつのまにか大島の彼らの家へ行くことにきまってしまっていた。,"My extraordinary favor, with no curiosity, no contempt, and forgetting that they were the kind of traveling entertainer, seemed to sneak into their hearts. .. I had decided to go to their house on Oshima before I knew it.","My common goodwill—which neither was mere curiosity nor bore any trace of contempt for their status as itinerant entertainers—seemed to have touched their hearts. Before I knew it, they had decided that I should accompany them to their place on Oshima.","Indeed I was no longer conscious that they belonged to that low order, traveling performers. They seemed to know it and to be moved by it. Before long they decided that I must visit them on Oshima."

町は秋の朝風が冷たかった。栄吉は途中で敷しき島しま四箱と柿とカオールという口中清涼剤とを買ってくれた。,"The autumn morning breeze was cold in the town. Eikichi bought four boxes of Shimashima and a persimmon and Cahors, which are refreshing agents in the mouth.","The morning autumn breeze blew chill in the town. Along the way Eikichi bought four packs of Shikishima cigarettes, some persimmons, and a mouthwash called ""Kaoru"" for me.","An autumn wind blew cold through the town.

Isn't it.7 Isn't it the same?""","The child's come to a dangerous age,"" the older woman said, arching her eyebrows as she tossed over a cloth."
突っ立っている私を見た踊子がすぐに自分の座ざ蒲ぶ団とんをはずして、裏返しに傍そばへ置いた。,The dancer who saw me standing up immediately took off his sitting group and put it inside out by his side.,"As soon as the dancing girl noticed me standing there, she pulled out the cushion she had been kneeling on, turned it over, and placed it near her.",The little dancing girl turned over the cushion she had been sitting on and pushed it politely toward me.
踊子の髪が豊かすぎるので、十七、八に見えていたのだ。その上娘盛りのように装よそわせてあるので、私はとんでもない思い違いをしていたのだ。,"The dancer's hair was so rich that it looked like seventeen or eight. Besides, I was ridiculously misunderstood because I was dressed like a daughter.","The dancing girl's hair had been arranged too elaborately for her age. She had looked seventeen or eighteen. What's more, she had been dressed like a young woman in her prime. I had made a ridiculous mistake.","It was because of her too-rich hair that she had seemed older, and because she was dressed like a girl of fifteen or sixteen. I had made an extraordinary mistake indeed."
まもなく、料理屋の女中が踊子を迎えに来た。踊子は衣裳をつけて私に言った。,"Soon, the maid of the restaurant came to pick up the dancer. The dancer put on a costume and said to me.","A moment later, the maid from the inn came to call for the dancing girl. She put on her costume.","I had read only a few minutes when the maid from the restaurant across the street came for her. ""I'll be right back,"" she said as she smoothed out her clothes."
「まあ！　厭いやらしい。この子は色気づいたんだよ。あれあれ……」と四十女が呆あきれ果てたというふうに眉まゆをひそめて手て拭ぬぐいを投げた。踊子はそれを拾って、窮屈そうに畳を拭ふいた。,"""Well! I don't like it. This kid noticed the color. That ..."", the forty girl frowned at her eyebrows and threw a wipe. The dancer picked it up and wiped the tatami mats cramped.","""My goodness. She's started thinking about the opposite sex. How disgusting! Look at that!"" The older woman furrowed her brow in dismay and threw a hand towel at the girl, who picked it up and wiped the mat, looking ill at ease.","""Dear me. The child's come to a dangerous age,"" the older woman said, arching her eyebrows as she tossed over a cloth."
私の足もとの寝床で、踊子がまっ赤になりながら両の掌ではたと顔を抑えてしまった。彼女は中の娘と一つの床に寝ていた。昨夜の濃こい化粧が残っていた。唇と眦まなじりの紅が少しにじんでいた。この情緒的な寝姿が私の胸を染めた。彼女は眩まぶしそうにくるりと寝返りして、掌で顔を隠したまま蒲団を辷すべり出ると、廊下に坐り、,"On the bed at my feet, the dancer turned red and held my face down with both palms. She was sleeping on one floor with her daughter inside. The dark makeup left last night. The lips and the crimson color were slightly bleeding. This emotional sleeping figure dyed my chest. She turned around dazzlingly, slipped out of the futon with her face hidden in her palm, and sat down in the hallway.","Lying at my feet, the dancing girl blushed and quickly covered her face with her hands. She was sharing a futon with the middle girl. She still had on her heavy makeup from the night before. The rouge on her lips and the corners of her eyes was slightly smudged. Her emotional appearance as she lay there touched my heart. She turned away as if to avoid the light. Hiding her face with her hands, she slid out of the covers and knelt in the hall.","The dancing girl lay almost at my feet, beside the youngest of the women. She flushed deeply and pressed her hands to her face with a quick flutter. Traces of make-up were left from the evening before, rouge on her lips and dots of rouge at the corners of her eyes. A thoroughly appealing little figure. I felt a bright surge of happiness as I looked down at her. Abruptly, still hiding her face, she rolled over, slipped out of bed, and bowed low before me in the hall."
そこで私は出立を延ばすことにして階下へおりた。皆が起きて来るのを待ちながら、汚い帳場で宿の者と話していると、男が散歩に誘った。街道を少し南へ行くと綺麗な橋があった。橋の欄らん干かんによりかかって、彼はまた身の上話を始めた。東京である新派役者の群れにしばらく加わっていたとのことだった。今でも時々大島の港で芝居をするのだそうだ。彼らの荷物の風呂敷から刀の鞘さやが足のようにはみ出していたのだったが、お座敷でも芝居の真ま似ねをして見せるのだと言った。柳やなぎ行ごう李りの中はその衣い裳しようや鍋なべ茶ちや碗わんなぞの世帯道具なのである。,"So I decided to postpone my departure and went downstairs. Waiting for everyone to get up, I was talking to the barman in the dirty counter, and the man invited me for a walk. A little south on the highway, there was a beautiful bridge. He started talking again, leaning on the bridge's balustrade. He was said to have joined the group of Shinpa actors in Tokyo for a while. Even now, he sometimes plays at the port of Oshima. The scabbard of the sword was sticking out of the furoshiki of their luggage like a foot, but he said that he would imitate the play even in the tatami room. Yanagi Yanagi Gogo Lee Inside is a household tool for the costumes, pots, tea, and bowls.","I decided to delay my departure. I went downstairs and talked with the clerk in the dirty office of the lodging house while I waited for the entertainers. The man came down and invited me to go for a walk with him. Along the road to the south was a beautiful bridge. Leaning against the railing, the man began to tell me more about himself. He had acted in a new-style Kabuki troupe in Tokyo for a time and said he still performed occasionally at the port on Oshima. That explained the sword sheath that stuck out of their luggage like an appendage. He told me he also performed when they entertained at gatherings. The wicker trunk held the costumes they used, as well as pots, dishes, and other household effects.","I agreed to wait another day, and went back down to my inn. I sat in the dirty little office talking to the manager while I waited for them to dress. Presently the man came by and we walked out to a pleasant bridge not far from town. He leaned against the railing and talked about himself. He had for a long time belonged to a theater company in Tokyo. Even now he sometimes acted in plays on Oshima, while at parties on the road he could do imitations of actors if called upon to. The strange, leglike bulge in one of the bundles was a stage sword, he explained, and the wicker trunk held both household goods and costumes."

この意外な言葉で、私はふと自分を省みた。峠の婆さんにあおり立てられた空想がぽきんと折れるのを感じた。,"With this surprising word, I suddenly left myself. I felt that the fantasy that was set up by the old lady on the pass was broken.","Caught off guard by the woman's words, I reconsidered my feelings. The daydream that the old woman at the pass had sparked in me had been dashed.","The child's come to a dangerous age,"" the older woman said, arching her eyebrows as she tossed over a cloth."
下田の港は、伊豆相模さがみの温泉場なぞを流して歩く旅芸人が、旅の空での故郷として懐なつかしがるような空気の漂ただよった町なのである。,"The port of Shimoda is a town with an air that makes you feel nostalgic as a hometown in the sky of travel, where traveling entertainers who walk through the mystery of the hot springs of Izu Sagami Sagami.",The port of Shimoda—it had the air of a hometown that the itinerant entertainers who traveled around the hot springs in Izu and Sagami longed for when they were on the road.,Something about Shimoda seems to have made it a home along the road for performers who wander the region of the Izu and Sagami hot springs.
「肩は痛くないかい」と、おふくろは踊子に幾度も駄目を押していた。,"""Doesn't your shoulder hurt?""","""Do your shoulders hurt?""","""Your shoulder isn't stiff?"" The older woman was fussing over the girl."
雨足が細くなって、峰が明るんで来た。もう十分も待てば綺き麗れいに晴れ上がると、しきりに引き止められたけれども、じっと坐すわっていられなかった。,"The rainy feet became thinner and the peaks became brighter. After waiting for enough time, it cleared up beautifully, and although I was constantly held back, I couldn't sit still.","The rain abated and the mountain peak cleared. The old woman tried to detain me longer, telling me the sky would be completely cloudless if only I would wait ten more minutes. But I just could not remain sitting there.","The rain quieted to a sprinkle, the sky over the pass cleared. I felt I could wait no longer, though the woman assured me that the sun would be out in another ten minutes."
「今晩は」と廊下に手を突いて芸者のようにお辞じ儀ぎをした。碁盤の上では急に私の負け色が見え出した。,"""Tonight,"" he pokes his hand in the hallway and resigns like a geisha.

It suddenly became apparent that I had lost the go game.",I was playing chess with a traveling salesman that night when I heard the drum in the garden. I started to go out to the veranda.
小一時間経つと、旅芸人たちが出いで立たつらしい物音が聞こえて来た。私も落着いている場合ではないのだが、胸騒ぎするばかりで立ち上がる勇気が出なかった。旅たび馴なれたと言っても女の足だから、十町や二十町遅れたって一走りに追いつけると思いながら、炉の傍そばでいらいらしていた。しかし踊子たちが傍にいなくなると、かえって私の空想は解き放たれたように生き生きと踊り始めた。彼らを送り出して来た婆さんに聞いた。,"After an hour, I heard the noise of traveling entertainers coming out. It wasn't the case when I was calm, but I didn't have the courage to stand up because I was just upset. Even though I got used to it every time I traveled, I was irritated by the side of the furnace, thinking that I could catch up with the run even if I was late for Jitcho or 20 towns. But when the dancers were gone, my fantasies began to dance lively as if they were unleashed. I asked the old lady who sent them out.","About an hour later, I heard the entertainers preparing to leave. I had not settled in to stay either, but I was so anxious that I did not have the courage to stand up. Although they were seasoned travelers, they would be walking at a woman's pace, so I was certain I could catch up even if I left a mile or so behind them. Still, I grew impatient sitting by the hearth. Once the entertainers had left, my daydreams began a vivid, reckless dance. The old woman returned from seeing the entertainers off.","Perhaps an hour later I heard them getting ready to leave. My heart pounded and my chest was tight, and yet I could not find the courage to get up and go off with them. I fretted on beside the fire. But they were women, after all; granted that they were used to walking, I ought to have no trouble overtaking them even if I fell a half mile or a mile behind. My mind danced off after them as though their departure had given it license."
「太鼓がはいるとお座敷が浮き立ちますね」とおふくろも向こうを見た。,"""The taiko drums make the taiko stand out,"" he said.","""","""A party always picks up speed when the drum begins,"" the woman said."
水と聞いて私は走った。木こ蔭かげの岩の間から清し水みずが湧わいていた。泉のぐるりに女たちが立っていた。,I ran when I heard that it was water. Fresh water was springing from between the rocks behind the trees. Women stood around the fountain.,"When I heard they had found water, I ran. Fresh water sprang from between some large rocks in the shade of the trees.

「明日にしていただけませんか。おふくろが一日延ばすって承知しないもんですからね。道連れのある方がよろしいですよ。明日一緒に参りましょう」と男が言うと、四十女も付け加えた。,"""Can you do it tomorrow? I don't know that my mother will extend the day. It's better to have a companion.

それから、自分が栄吉、女房が千代子、妹が薫かおるということなぞを教えてくれた。もう一人の百ゆ合り子こという十七の娘だけが大島生まれで雇いだとのことだった。栄吉はひどく感傷的になって泣き出しそうな顔をしながら河瀬を見つめていた。,"Then he told me the mystery that he was Eikichi, his wife was Chiyoko, and his sister was Kaoru Kaoru.

He gazed down at the river, and for a time I thought he was about to weep."
男が帰りがけに、庭から私を見上げて挨あい拶さつをした。,"On his way home, the man looked up at me from the garden and gave a dusty greeting.","As the man made his way to the inn gate, he looked up at my window to say good-bye.",I had assumed that he had come along for the walk-perhaps like me to be near the dancer.
「回るんですが」と男は娘たちの方を見た。,"""I'm going around,"" the man looked at his daughters.",""" The man looked toward the girls.","""Do you have somewhere else to go tonight?"" I asked."

私は鳥打帽を脱ぬいで栄吉の頭にかぶせてやった。そしてカバンの中から学校の制帽を出して皺しわを伸しながら、二人で笑った。,"I took off my cap and put it on Eikichi's head.

「こんなことをなさっちゃいけません」とほうり上げた。それが藁屋根の上に落ちた。私がもう一度投げると、男は持って帰った。,"""You can't do this,"" he said. It fell on the straw roof.

夕暮からひどい雨になった。山々の姿が遠近を失って白く染まり、前の小川が見る見る黄色く濁にごって音を高めた。こんな雨では踊子たちが流して来ることもあるまいと思いながら、私はじっと坐すわっていられないので二度も三度も湯にはいってみたりしていた。部屋は薄暗かった。隣室との間の襖ふすまを四角く切り抜いたところに鴨かも居いから電燈が下がっていて、一つの明かりが二室兼用になっているのだった。,"It rained heavily from the evening. The appearance of the mountains lost their perspective and was dyed white, and the yellow turbidity seen by the stream in front raised the sound. I thought that the dancers wouldn't be washed away in such rain, but I couldn't sit still, so I went into the hot water twice or three times. The room was dim. The fusuma bran between the next room and the fusuma bran was cut out in a square, and the lamp was down from the duck, and one light was used for both rooms.","Rain started pouring around sunset. The mountains turned colorless and lost their depth. The small stream in front of the inn ran yellow as I watched it. The sound of rushing water grew louder. Thinking that the dancers would never come looking for customers in this torrent, I could not sit still, so I went to the bath two or three more times. My room was dismal.

私はそれまでにこの踊子たちを二度見ているのだった。最初は私が湯が島へ来る途中、修善寺へ行く彼女たちと湯川橋の近くで出会った。その時は若い女が三人だったが、踊子は太たい鼓こを提さげていた。私は振り返り振り返り眺めて、旅情が自分の身についたと思った。それから、湯が島の二日目の夜、宿屋へ流して来た。踊子が玄関の板敷で踊るのを、私は梯はし子ご段だんの中途に腰をおろして一心に見ていた。──あの日が修善寺で今夜が湯が島なら、明日は天城を南に越えて湯が野温泉へ行くのだろう。天城七里の山道できっと追いつけるだろう。そう空想して道を急いで来たのだったが、雨宿りの茶屋でぴったり落ち合ったものだから、私はどぎまぎしてしまったのだ。,"I had seen these dancers twice by then. At first, on the way to Yugashima, I met them near Shuzenji near Yugawa Bridge. At that time, there were three young women, but the dancer was holding a thick drum. I looked back and looked back and thought that I had learned the journey. Then, on the second night of the island, hot water flowed to the inn. I sat down in the middle of the ladder and watched the dancer dance on the board at the entrance. ──If that day is Shuzenji and tonight is Yugashima, tomorrow you will cross Amagi to the south and go to Yugano Onsen. I'm sure you can catch up on the mountain road of Amagi Nanari. I fantasized about it and came in a hurry, but I was confused because it was a perfect match at a teahouse in the rain.","I had seen this troupe twice previously. The first time I encountered them, near Yugawa Bridge, I was on my way to Yugashima Hot Springs while they were going to Shuzenji. There were three girls in the group. The dancing girl was carrying a drum. After we passed, I looked back at them again and again. I had finally experienced the romance of travel. Then, my second night at Yugashima, the entertainers had come to the inn to perform. Sitting halfway down the ladderlike stairs, I had gazed intently at the girl as she danced on the wooden floor of the entryway. ""If they were at Shuzenji the other day and Yugashima tonight, then they would probably go to Yugano Springs on the south side of Amagi Pass tomorrow. Surely I could catch up with them along the fifteen miles of mountain road over Amagi. "" Thus I had been daydreaming as I hastened along the road that day. Now we had ended up taking shelter from the rain at the same teahouse. My heart was pounding.","I had seen the little dancer twice before. Once I passed her and the other two young women on a long bridge half way down the peninsula. She was carrying a big drum. I looked back and looked back again, congratulating myself that here finally I had the flavor of travel. And then my third night at the inn I saw her dance. She danced just inside the entrance, and I sat on the stairs enraptured. On the bridge then, here tonight, I had said to myself: tomorrow over the pass to Yugano, and surely somewhere along those fifteen miles I will meet them —that was the hope that had sent me hurrying up the mountain road. But the meeting at the tea-house was too sudden. I was taken quite off balance."
湯が野にいる時から私は、この前髪に挿さした櫛を貰もらって行くつもりだったので、犬の毛を梳くのはいけないと思った。,"From the time Yugano was in the field, I was going to get a comb in my bangs, so I thought I shouldn't comb my dog's hair.","Ever since our stay in Yugano, I had been hoping to be given the comb she wore in the front of her hair as a memento, so I did not want her using it on the dog, either.","It was the comb she wore in her hair, and even back in Yugano I had planned to ask for it when we got to Shimoda."

「それは、それは。旅は道連れ、世は情け。私たちのようなつまらない者でも、ご退屈しのぎにはなりますよ。まあ、上がってお休みなさいまし」と無む造ぞう作さに答えた。娘たちは一いち時どきに私を見たが、しごくなんでもないという顔で黙って、少し恥はずかしそうに私を眺めていた。,"""That's it. Travel is a companion, the world is compassionate. Even a trivial person like us can be bored. Well, get up and rest."" .. The girls looked at me from time to time, but they looked at me a little embarrassed, silently with a face that was nothing.","""Well, well. As the old saying goes, 'On the road, a traveling companion; and in the world, kindness.' Even boring people like us will help you pass the time. Come on in and take a rest."" She spoke without formality. The girls all glanced at me at the same time. They stopped talking, their faces seemingly indifferent. Then their gaze turned to embarrassment.","""Oh, would he?"" she answered with simple warmth. "" 'On the road a companion, in life sympathy,' they say. I suppose even poor things like us can liven up a trip. Do come in-we'll have a cup of tea and rest ourselves."" We went up to the second floor and laid down our baggage."
そこの内うち湯ゆ〔＊５〕につかっていると、後から男がはいって来た。自分が二十四になることや、女房が二度とも流産と早産とで子供を死なせたことなぞを話した。彼は長岡温泉の印しるし半ばん纏てんを着ているので、長岡の人間だと私は思っていたのだった。また顔つきも話ぶりも相当知識的なところから、物好きか芸人の娘に惚ほれたかで、荷物を持ってやりながらついて来ているのだと想像していた。,"When I was using Yuyu [* 5], a man came in later. He told me that he was twenty-four and that his wife had killed her child due to miscarriage and premature birth. He wore a half-dressed sign of Nagaoka Onsen, so I thought he was a human being in Nagaoka. Also, from the fact that his face and speech are quite knowledgeable, I imagined that he was following me with his luggage, whether he was a lover or a gein's daughter.","I stepped into the bath and the man got in after me. He told me he was twenty-four. His wife had lost two children, one by miscarriage and one that was born prematurely. I assumed he was from Nagaoka, since his jacket bore a Nagaoka Hot Springs emblem. His intellectual manner of speaking and his facial expressions made me wonder if he had been following the entertainers and carrying their luggage simply out of curiosity, or perhaps because he had fallen in love with one of them.","We went together for a bath. He was twenty-three, he told me, and his wife had had two miscarriages. He seemed not unintelligent. I had assumed that he had come along for the walk-perhaps like me to be near the dancer."
「どうしよう。今夜はもうよしにして遊ばせていただくか」,"""What should I do? Let's play tonight.""","""What do you think? Shall we just forget about it and have a good time instead?""","""Do you have somewhere else to go tonight?"" I asked."
「こら。この子に触さわっておくれでないよ。生き娘むすめなんだからね」,"""Hey, don't let this child touch you. You're a living daughter.""","""Hey, don't touch her. She's an innocent virgin.""","You can never guess what he'll do next."""
「あんなに大きく見えるんですもの、いらっしゃいましね」と踊子が言った。,"""You're here for something that looks so big,"" said the dancer.","See how big it looks. Please do come,"" the dancing girl said.","""So big! You really will come, won't you?"" the dancer said."
すると踊子はとうとつに女の名前を二つ三つあげて、私に見当のつかない話を始めた。大島ではなくて甲府の話らしかった。尋常二年まで通った小学校の友達のことらしかった。それを思い出すままに話すのだった。,"Then the dancer finally gave a couple of women's names and started a story that I had no idea. It was like Kofu, not Oshima. It was like a friend of an elementary school who attended until the second year of ordinary life. I spoke as I remembered it.","The dancing girl mentioned two or three girl's names and began talking about something I could not follow. She seemed to be describing Kofu, not Oshima. Apparently the names were her friends at the elementary school she had attended until second grade. The dancing girl just rambled on.","She mentioned two or three girls' names that meant nothing to me, and rambled on with a string of reminiscences. She was talking not of Oshima but of Kofu, apparently, of a grammar school she had been in for the first and second grades. She talked artlessly on as the memories of her friends came back to her."
芸人たちはそれぞれに天城を越えた時と同じ荷物を持った。おふくろの腕の輪に小犬が前足を載せて旅馴なれた顔をしていた。湯が野を出ではずれると、また山にはいった。海の上の朝日が山の腹を温ぬくめていた。私たちは朝日の方を眺めた。河津川の行く手に河津の浜が明るく開けていた。,"The entertainers each carried the same luggage as when they crossed Amagi. A puppy put his forefoot on the ring of his arm and had a familiar face. When the hot water left the field, I entered the mountain again. The morning sun on the sea warmed the hillside. We looked towards the morning sun. The beach of Kawazu was brightly open on the way of the Kawazu River.","The entertainers were carrying the same luggage they had hauled through Amagi Pass. The puppy rested his paws on the woman's arm, looking like a seasoned traveler. Just outside Yugano we found ourselves again in the mountains. The sun hanging over the sea warmed the slopes. We gazed toward the morning sun. Kawazu Beach spread wide in the sunlight out where the Kawazu River flowed.","THE baggage was distributed as on the day we came over Amagi Pass. The puppy, cool as a seasoned traveler, lay with its forepaws on the older woman's arms. From Yagano we entered the mountains again. We looked out over the sea at the morning sun, warming our mountain valley. At the mouth of the river a beach opened wide and white."
男と一緒に私の部屋に帰っていると、まもなく上の娘が宿の庭へ来て菊畑を見ていた。踊子が橋を半分ほど渡っていた。四十女が共同湯を出て二人の方を見た。踊子はきゅっと肩をつぼめながら、叱しかられるから帰ります、というふうに笑って見せて急ぎ足に引き返した。四十女が橋まで来て声をかけた。,"When I returned to my room with the man, my older daughter soon came to the garden of the inn and looked at Kikuhata. The dancer crossed the bridge about halfway. The forty girls left the communal bath and looked at them. The dancer squeezed his shoulders and laughed and turned back in a hurry, saying that he would return because he was scolded. The forty girl came to the bridge and called out.","After I returned to my room with the man, the oldest girl came to the garden at my inn and stood looking at the chrysanthemum bed. The dancing girl had stopped halfway across the bridge. The older woman came out of the public bath and glanced over at the two of them. The dancing girl smiled and shrugged her shoulders at me as if to indicate that she would be scolded if she didn't go back. She hurried away. The older woman walked out as far as the bridge and called to me.","We were back in my room when the older of the two young women came to look at the flowers in the garden. The little dancer followed her halfway across the bridge. The old woman came out of the bath frowning. The dancer shrugged her shoulders and ran back, laughing as if to say that she would be scolded if she came any nearer. The older young woman came up to the bridge."
踊子は暑そうだった。私が指でべんべんと太鼓を叩くと小鳥が飛び立った。,"The dancer looked hot. When I hit the drum with my finger, the little bird took off.",She looked flushed. I thumped the drum with my fingers and the birds flew away.,"I tapped the drum a couple of times with my finger, and the birds started up in alarm."
「どうもありがとう。お爺さんが一人だから帰ってあげてください」と私が言うと、婆さんはやっとのことでカバンを離した。,"""Thank you very much. I have only one old man, so please go home,"" I said, and the old woman finally let go of her bag.","""Thank you very much,"" I said. ""You'd better go back now. Your husband is there all alone. "" The old woman finally released my bag.",When we came to the tunnel I finally shook her off.
三,three,3,III
私はほっとして男と並んで歩き始めた。男は次々にいろんなことを私に聞いた。二人が話し出したのを見て、うしろから女たちがばたばた走り寄って来た。,"I was relieved to start walking alongside the man. The man asked me many things one after another. Seeing the two speak, the women fluttered from behind.","Relieved, I fell into step with the man. He asked me all kinds of questions. Seeing the two of us talking, the women scurried to join us.","Rescued, I walked on beside him. He began asking questions, and the women, seeing that we had struck up a conversation, came tripping up behind us."
「私はあなたが長岡温泉の人だとばかり思っていましたよ」,"""I just thought you were from Nagaoka Onsen.""","""All along I thought you were from Nagaoka Hot Springs.""","""I thought you came from the inn at Nagaoka."""
「この方はお連れになりたいとおっしゃるんだよ」,"""This person wants to be with you.""","But the man spoke for me: ""This young gentleman has kindly offered to accompany us.""","But this gentleman would like to go on with us,"" the man said."
「なあに、それに歩いたってどうせお客がないんです」,"""Well, there are no customers even if I walk on it.""","We wouldn't find any customers anyway, even if we did make the rounds.""","""We couldn't find any customers if we tried."""
「お爺さん、お大事になさいよ。寒くなりますからね」と、私は心から言って立ち上がった。爺さんは黄色い眼を重そうに動かして微かすかにうなずいた。,"""Grandfather, please take good care of yourself. It will be cold,"" I said from the bottom of my heart and stood up. The old man moved his yellow eyes heavy and nodded slightly.","""Please take care of yourself,"" I said to the old man. ""It's going to get colder. "" I spoke from my heart as I stood up. His yellow eyes lolled in his head, and he gave a slight nod.","I felt I could wait no longer, though the woman assured me that the sun would be out in another ten minutes. ""Young man, young man."""
「私は身を誤った果てに落ちぶれてしまいましたが、兄が甲府で立派に家の後あと目めを立てていてくれます。だから私はまあいらない体なんです」,"""I fell into the wrong end, but my brother is brilliantly looking after my house in Kofu. That's why I'm a disappointing body.""","""It's wretched, the mess I've made of my life. But my older brother in Kofu is doing fine as family heir, keeping up the reputation of the family. So, I would be of no use anyway.""","""I made a mistake and ruined myself. My brother has taken over for the family in Kofu and I'm really not much use there."""
四,four,4,We were to leave Yugano at eight the next morning.
「どうするんだ」と栄吉が聞くと、ちょっとまごつきながら私に竹を突きつけた。,"When Eikichi asked, ""What are you going to do?""","""What are you going to do with it?"" Eikichi asked.","""But all he would have to do would be to get a gold tooth."
汽船が下田の海を出て伊豆半島の南端がうしろに消えて行くまで、私は欄らん干かんに凭もたれて沖の大島を一心に眺めていた。踊子に別れたのは遠い昔であるような気持だった。婆さんはどうしたかと船室を覗のぞいてみると、もう人々が車座に取とり囲かこんで、いろいろと慰めているらしかった。私は安心して、その隣の船室にはいった。相模さがみ灘なだは波が高かった。坐すわっていると、時々左右に倒れた。船員が小さい金だらいを配くばって回った。私はカバンを枕にして横たわった。頭が空からっぽで時間というものを感じなかった。涙がぽろぽろカバンに流れた。頰ほおが冷たいのでカバンを裏返しにしたほどだった。私の横に少年が寝ていた。河津の工場主の息子で入学準備に東京へ行くのだったから、一高の制帽をかぶっている私に好意を感じたらしかった。少し話してから彼は言った。,"Until the steamer left the sea of Shimoda and the southern tip of the Izu Peninsula disappeared behind me, I was leaning against the sword and staring at Oshima off the coast. I felt like it was a long time ago that I broke up with a dancer. When she looked into the cabin to see what happened, it seemed that people were already surrounded by the seats and comforted in various ways. I was relieved and entered the cabin next to it. The waves were high in Sagami Sagami Nada. When I was sitting, I sometimes fell to the left and right. The sailors handed out small gold coins around. I lay down with my bag as a pillow. My head was empty and I didn't feel the time. Tears ran down my bag. The bag was so cold that I turned the bag over. A boy was sleeping next to me. The son of the factory owner in Kawazu was going to Tokyo to prepare for admission, so I thought he liked me wearing a high-ranking cap. After talking a little, he said.","The steamship left Shimoda. I leaned against the railing and gazed at Oshima in the offing until the southern tip of the Izu Peninsula vanished behind me. It already seemed long ago that I parted from the dancing girl. When I glanced into the cabin to check on the old woman, I saw a group of people gathered around her in a circle, consoling her. I felt relieved. I entered the cabin next door. The waves were choppy on Sagami Bay. I was tossed left and right as I sat. A crewman passed out small metal bowls. I lay down, using my bag as a pillow. My head felt empty, and I had no sense of time. My tears spilled onto my bag. My cheeks were so cold I turned my bag over. There was a boy lying next to me. He was the son of a factory owner in Kawazu and was on his way to Tokyo to prepare to enter school. The sight of me in my First Upper School cap seemed to elicit his goodwill. After we talked for a while, he asked, ""Have you had a death in your family?""","I leaned against the railing and gazed out at Oshima until the southern tip of the Izu Peninsula was out of sight. It seemed a long while before that I had said good-by to the little dancer. I went inside and on to my stateroom. The sea was so rough that it was hard even to sit up. A crewman came around to pass out metal basins for the seasick. I lay down with my book sack for a pillow, my mind clear and empty. I was no longer conscious of the passage of time. I wept silently, and when my cheek began to feel chilly I turned my book sack over. A young boy lay beside me. He was the son of an Izu factory owner, he explained, and he was going to Tokyo to get ready for highschool entrance examinations. My school cap had attracted him."
「だから兄さんと」,"""So with my brother""","""So, come with your brother.""","""Bring your brother."""
「お遊びにいらっしゃいまし」,"""Come to play""","""Please come visit us,"" the oldest girl repeated.","""Come on over,"" she called to me."
踊子はやはり連れの女を見て笑った。,The dancer laughed when she saw her companion.,The dancing girl simply looked at her companion and giggled.,She looked at the other woman and laughed uncertainly.
そして私のカバンを抱きかかえて渡そうとせずに、いくら断わってもその辺まで送ると言って承知しなかった。一町ばかりもちょこちょこついて来て、同じことを繰り返していた。,"And I didn't know that I would send my bag to that area no matter how much I refused, without trying to hold it and hand it over. Only one town came along and repeated the same thing.","She picked up my bag in both hands and refused to give it to me. She would not listen, no matter how much I tried to dissuade her. The old woman told me she would accompany me up the road a bit. She repeated the same words as she tottered along behind me for a hundred yards.","She clutched at my book sack and held me back, trying to return the money I had given her, and when I refused it she hobbled along after me. She must at least see me off up the road, she insisted."
トンネルの出口から白塗りの柵さくに片側を縫われた峠道が稲妻のように流れていた。この模型のような展望の裾すその方に芸人達の姿が見えた。六町と行かないうちに私は彼らの一行に追いついた。しかし急に歩調を緩ゆるめることもできないので、私は冷淡なふうに女たちを追い越してしまった。十間ほど先に一人歩いていた男が私を見ると立ち止まった。,"From the exit of the tunnel, a pass road sewn on one side of a white fence was flowing like lightning. I could see the entertainers at the hem of this model-like outlook. Before I went to Rokucho, I caught up with their party. But I couldn't slow down suddenly, so I overtook the women in a cold manner. A man who was walking alone about ten minutes ago stopped when he saw me.","The mountain road, stitched on one side with whitewashed pickets, coursed down from the mouth of the tunnel like a jagged lightning bolt. The scene resembled a landscape in miniature. I could make out the itinerant entertainers down at the bottom. Before I had walked half a mile, I overtook them. It would be too obvious were I to slacken my pace too abruptly, so I nonchalantly passed the women. When the man, who was walking about twenty yards ahead of the others, noticed me, he paused.","LINED on one side by a white fence, the road twisted down from the mouth of the tunnel like a streak of lightning. Near the bottom of the jagged figure were the dancer and her companions. Another half mile and I had overtaken them. Since it hardly seemed graceful to slow down at once to their pace, however, I moved on past the women with a show of coolness. The man, walking some ten yards ahead of them, turned as he heard me come up."
紙屋は芸人の方を見向きもせずに、碁盤の目を一つ一つ数えてから、ますます注意深く打って行った。女たちは太鼓や三味線を部屋の隅に片づけると、将しよう棋ぎ盤の上で五目並べを始めた。そのうちに私は勝っていた碁を負けてしまったのだが、紙屋は、,"The paper shop did not look at the entertainer, but counted the grids one by one and then hit them more and more carefully. The women put away the drums and shamisen in the corner of the room, and started arranging Gomoku on the shogunate board. In the meantime, I lost the winning Go, but the paper shop said","The paper dealer kept playing, studying the board and counting points without even a glance at the entertainers. The girls placed their drums and samisen in the corner of the room, then started playing a game of ""five-in-a-row"" on a Chinese chess board. Meanwhile, I indeed lost the go game that I had previously been winning.","""How about another?"" asked the salesman."
雨戸を閉じて床にはいっても胸が苦しかった。また湯にはいった。湯を荒々しくかき回した。雨が上がって、月が出た。雨に洗われた秋の夜が冴さえ冴ざえと明るんだ。はだしで湯ゆ殿どのを抜け出して行ったって、どうともできないのだと思った。二時を過ぎていた。,"Even if I closed the shutters and went to the floor, my chest was painful. I went to the hot water again. I stirred the hot water roughly. It rained and the moon rose. The rain-washed autumn night was bright and bright. I thought I couldn't do anything about getting out of Yuyuden with bare feet. It was past two o'clock.","I closed the shutters and crawled into bed, but my chest felt heavy. I went down again for a bath. I thrashed the water. The rain stopped and the moon came out. The autumn night was bright, washed clean by the rain. I slipped out of the bathhouse barefoot, but I could not do anything. It was past two o'clock.","I closed the shutters and got into bed. My chest was painfully tight. I went down to the bath again and splashed about violently. The rain stopped, the moon came out; the autumn sky, washed by the rain, shone crystalline into the distance. I thought for a moment of running out barefoot to look for her. It was after two."
湯が野までは河かわ津づ川がわの渓谷に沿うて三里余りのくだりだった。峠を越えてからは、山や空の色までが南国らしく感じられた。私と男とは絶えず話し続けて、すっかり親しくなった。荻おぎ乗のりや梨なし本もとなぞの小さい村里を過ぎて、湯が野の藁わら屋や根ねが麓ふもとに見えるようになった頃、私は下田まで一緒に旅をしたいと思い切って言った。彼はたいへん喜んだ。,"Up to Yugano, the river Kawatsuzu River was about three miles along the valley. After crossing the pass, the colors of the mountains and the sky felt like a tropical country. I kept talking to the guy and I got to know him completely. After passing the small village village of Ogi Ogi Nori and Pearless Book and Mystery, when Yugano's straw shop and roots became visible at the foot of the mountain, I decided to travel to Shimoda together. Said. He was very pleased.","The road to Yugano ran about eight miles down through the valley of the Kawazu River. On this side of the pass, even the mountains and the color of the sky began to look more southern. As the man and I continued our conversation, we took a liking to each other. We passed tiny villages with names like Oginori and Nashimoto. About the time the thatched roofs of Yugano came into view at the foot of the mountain, I ventured to tell the man that I wanted to travel with them to Shimoda. He seemed delighted.","From six or seven miles above Yugano the road followed a river. The mountains had taken on the look of the South from the moment we descended the pass. The man and I became firm friends, and as the thatched roofs of Yugano came in sight below us I announced that I would like to go on to Shimoda with them. He seemed delighted."
そして五目並べなぞをしながら、十二時過ぎまで遊んで行った。,"Then, while playing Gomoku, I played until after 12 o'clock.","We played ""five-in-a-row"" and enjoyed ourselves until past midnight.","They stayed on till past midnight, playing away at checkers."
「決して歌うんじゃないよ」とおふくろが言うと、彼女は太鼓を提げて軽くうなずいた。おふくろは私を振り向いた。,"""Never sing,"" she said, holding a drum and nodding lightly. My mother turned around to me.","""Don't sing,"" the woman said. The dancing girl picked up her drum and nodded slightly. The woman turned back to me.","""Don't go away. I want to hear the rest."""
六,Six,6,The Koshuya was a cheap inn at the northern edge of Shimoda.
暗いトンネルに入ると、冷たい雫しずくがぽたぽた落ちていた。南伊豆への出口が前方に小さく明るんでいた。,"When I entered the dark tunnel, cold drops were dripping. The exit to Minamiizu was small and bright ahead.","Cold drops of water plopped inside the dark tunnel. Up ahead, the tiny portal to southern Izu grew brighter.",When we came to the tunnel I finally shook her off. II
「たいへんすみませんのですよ。今日立つつもりでしたけれど、今晩お座敷がありそうでございますから、私たちは一日延ばしてみることにいたしました。どうしても今日お立ちになるなら、また下田でお目にかかりますわ。私たちは甲州屋という宿屋にきめておりますから、すぐおわかりになります」と四十女が寝床から半ば起き上がって言った。私は突っ放されたように感じた。,"""I'm very sorry. I was planning to stand today, but there seems to be a tatami room tonight, so we decided to postpone it for a day. If you really want to stand today, I'll see you again in Shimoda. Wow, we're in an inn called Koshuya, so you'll know right away, ""said the forty-girl, who got up halfway from her bed. I felt like I was thrown away.","""Oh, I'm sorry. "" The older woman spoke, sitting up halfway. ""I know we had planned to leave today, but we were told there's to be a big party this evening where we can perform, so we decided to stay one more night. If you have to move on today, we could meet in Shimoda. We've already decided to stay at an inn there called Koshuya. It's easy to find. "" I felt as though I had been dismissed.","""You will have to forgive us,"" the older woman said, sitting up in bed. ""We mean to leave today, but it seems there is to be a party tonight, and we thought we'd see what could be done with it. If you really must go, perhaps you can meet us in Shimoda. We always stay at the Koshuya Inn-you should have no trouble finding it."" I felt deserted."
乗船場に近づくと、海際にうずくまっている踊子の姿が私の胸に飛び込んだ。傍そばに行くまで彼女はじっとしていた。黙って頭を下げた。昨夜のままの化粧が私をいっそう感情的にした。眦まなじりの紅が怒っているかのような顔に幼い凜り々りしさを与えていた。栄吉が言った。,"As I approached the boarding area, the figure of a dancer crouching by the sea jumped into my chest. She stayed still until she went by her side. I silently bowed my head. The makeup as it was last night made me even more emotional. He gave a young dignity to his face as if he was angry. Eikichi said.","As we approached the dock, I was struck by the sight of the dancing girl crouching near the water. She remained motionless until I reached her. Silently, she lowered her head. Her makeup, the same this morning as it was the previous night, made me feel even more sentimental. The rouge at the corners of her eyes bestowed a youthful strength, as though she might even be angry.","As we came to the pier I saw with a quick jump of the heart that the little dancer was sitting at the water's edge. She did not move as we came up, only nodded a silent greeting. On her face were the traces of make-up I found so engaging, and the rather angry red at the corners of her eyes seemed to give her a fresh young dignity."
一行は大島の波は浮ぶの港の人たちだった。春に島を出てから旅を続けているのだが、寒くなるし、冬の用意はして来ないので、下田に十日ほどいて伊東温泉から島へ帰るのだと言った。大島と聞くと私はいっそう詩を感じて、また踊子の美しい髪を眺めた。大島のことをいろいろ訊たずねた。,"The party was the people of the port where the waves of Oshima floated. I've been traveling since I left the island in the spring, but it's getting cold and I'm not ready for the winter, so I said that I would stay in Shimoda for about 10 days and return to the island from Ito Onsen. When I heard Oshima, I felt more poetry and looked at the beautiful hair of the dancer again. I asked him a lot about Oshima.","They were from the harbor town of Habu on Oshima, the largest island off the southern tip of the Izu Peninsula. They had been on the road since leaving the island in the spring, but it was turning cold and they had not yet made preparations for winter. They said they were planning to stay in Shimoda for just ten days, then cross over to the island from Ito Hot Springs. At the mention of Oshima, I felt even more the poetry of the situation. Again I glanced at the dancing girl's lovely hair. I asked questions about Oshima.","They were from Oshima in the leu Islands, the man told me. In the spring they left to wander over the peninsula, but now it was getting cold and they had no winter clothes with them. After ten days or so at Shimoda in the south they would sail back to the islands. I glanced again at those rich mounds of hair, at the little figure all the more romantic now for being from Oshima. I questioned them about the islands."
「東京のどこに家があります」,"""Where is my house in Tokyo?""","""Where is your house in Tokyo?"" ""My home isn't Tokyo.","""Where do you live in Tokyo?"""
「お遊びにいらっしゃいまし」,"""Come to play""","""Please come visit us.""","""Come on over,"" she called to me."
はなはだしい軽けい蔑べつを含んだ婆さんの言葉が、それならば、踊子を今夜は私の部屋に泊らせるのだ、と思ったほど私をあおり立てた。,"The words of the old woman, including a terrible and light contempt, made me wonder if that would make the dancer stay in my room tonight.","The scorn that lurked in the woman's words so stirred me, I thought to myself: If that is true, then I'll have the dancing girl stay in my room tonight.","Her open contempt excited me. If she is right, I said to myself, then the dancing girl will stay in my room tonight."
「ああ水が飲みたい」,"""Oh I want to drink water""","""I'm thirsty,"" I said.","""I'm thirsty."""
「お足が早いですね。──いいあんばいに晴れました」,"""Your legs are fast. ── It was sunny and sunny.""","""You walk fast. . . . We're lucky the weather cleared up,"" he said.","""You're quite a walker. . . . Isn't it lucky the rain has stopped."""
私は婆さんに答える言葉もなく、囲い炉ろ裏りの上にうつむいていた。山を越える自動車が家を揺ゆすぶった。秋でもこんなに寒い、そしてまもなく雪に染まる峠を、なぜこの爺さんはおりないのだろうと考えていた。私の着物から湯気が立って、頭が痛むほど火が強かった。婆さんは店に出て旅芸人の女と話していた。,"I had no words to answer to my grandmother, and I was lying on the back of the enclosure. A car over the mountains shook the house. I was wondering why this old man didn't have a pass that was so cold even in autumn and soon dyed in snow. The steam was rising from my kimono and the fire was so strong that it hurt my head. The old woman went out to the store and talked to a traveling entertainer woman.","Without a word to the old woman, I bent over the hearth. An automobile navigating the pass rattled the house. I wondered why the old man did not move down to a lower elevation, with the autumn already this cold and snow soon to cover the pass. Steam rose from my kimono. The fire was hot enough to scorch my face. The old woman went back out to the shop, commenting to one of the female entertainers.","The old woman went out to talk to the dancers. """
「甲府の学校へ行ってるんでございますよ。長く大島におりますけれど、国は甲か斐いの甲府でございましてね」,"""I'm going to a school in Kofu. I've been in Oshima for a long time, but the country is Kofu, which is worth it.""","""His school is not on Oshima. It's in Kofu. We've been on Oshima for a long time, but Kofu is our original home.""",The remark somehow startled me. I felt the excitement aroused by the old woman at the tea-house begin to mount.
その山をおりて下田街道に出ると、炭焼きの煙が幾つも見えた。路傍の材木に腰をおろして休んだ。踊子は道にしゃがみながら、桃色の櫛くしで犬のむく毛を梳すいてやっていた。,"When I went down the mountain and went out to the Shimoda Highway, I saw a lot of charcoal-burning smoke. I sat down on the timber by the road and took a rest. The dancer was crouching down the road, combing the dog's hair with a pink comb.","When we rejoined the Shimoda highway at the foot of the mountain, we saw several threads of smoke from charcoal-burning huts. We sat down to rest on some timber stacked by the roadside. The dancing girl crouched on the road, combing the puppy's shaggy fur with her pink comb.","At the foot of the slope we came out on the Shimoda highway. Down the highway, sending up columns of smoke here and there, were the fires of the charcoal-makers. We stopped to rest on a pile of wood. The dancing girl began to curry the puppy's shaggy coat with a pinkish comb."
湯から上がると私はすぐに昼飯を食べた。湯が島を朝の八時に出たのだったが、その時はまだ三時前だった。,"As soon as I got out of the hot water, I ate lunch. The hot water left the island at 8 o'clock in the morning, but it was still 3 o'clock before that time.","I ate lunch as soon as I got out of the bath. I had left Yugashima at eight o'clock in the morning, but it was not yet three o'clock now.",I had assumed that he had come along for the walk-perhaps like me to be near the dancer.
甲州屋という木き賃ちん宿やどは下田の北口をはいるとすぐだった。私は芸人たちの後から屋根裏のような二階へ通った。天井がなく、街道に向かった窓際に坐すわると、屋根裏が頭につかえるのだった。,"Koshuya, a wooden inn, was just after entering the north exit of Shimoda. I went upstairs like an attic after the entertainers. There was no ceiling, and when I sat by the window facing the highway, the attic was stuck in my head.","Koshuya, a cheap lodging house, was located just within Shimoda on the north side. I followed the entertainers into a second-floor room that had all the appearances of an attic. There was no ceiling, and when I sat near the windowsill, facing the road, my head almost touched the roof.","The Koshuya was a cheap inn at the northern edge of Shimoda. I went up behind the rest to an attic-like room on the second floor. There was no ceiling, and the roof sloped down so sharply that at the window overlooking the street one could not sit comfortably upright."

「駄目だよ。太いのは盗んだとすぐにわかって、見られると悪いじゃないか。返して来い」,"""It's no good. It's bad to see the thick one as soon as you know it's stolen. Please return it.""","""You can't do that. If someone sees him with the thickest one, they'll know we stole it. We don't want to get caught. Put it back,"" Eikichi said.","Then you'd never notice,"" the dancer's voice came to me suddenly."
「あいつですよ。妹にだけはこんなことをさせたくないと思いつめていますが、そこにはまたいろんな事情がありましてね」,"""It's him. I don't want my sister to do this, but there are various circumstances.""","""She's the one. Actually, it bothers me; I didn't want my sister to have to live like this, but it's a long story.""","""That's the one. I've tried to think of ways of keeping her out of this business, but there were all sorts of reasons why it couldn't be helped."""
一時間ほど遊んで芸人たちはこの宿の内湯へ行った。一緒にはいろうとしきりに誘われたが、若い女が三人もいるので、私は後から行くとごまかしてしまった。すると踊子が一人すぐに上がって来た。,"After playing for about an hour, the entertainers went to the indoor bath at this inn. I was always invited to join him, but there were three young women, so I cheated when I went later. Then one dancer came up immediately.","The entertainers stayed about an hour, then went down to the inn bath. They begged me to come along, but I put them off. I said I would go later since there would be three girls in the bath. Shortly, the dancing girl came back upstairs alone to relay a message from Chiyoko.","An hour or so later they all went down for a bath. I must come along, they insisted; but the idea of a bath with three young women was somewhat overwhelming, and I said I would go in later. In a moment the little dancer came back upstairs."
踊子は頭を振った。,The dancer shook his head.,Eikichi asked. She shook her head.,Eikichi asked. She shook her head.
「昨晩はありがとうございました」と綺麗なお辞儀をして、立ったままの私をまごつかせた。,"""Thank you for last night,"" he bowed beautifully and confused me while standing.","""Thank you for last night."" She gave a pretty bow. I felt awkward standing over her.",I stood dumbly wondering what to do.
「船の中で蜜み柑かんはよくありませんが、柿は船酔いにいいくらいですから食べられます」,"""Tangerine is not good on the boat, but persimmons are good for seasickness, so you can eat them.""","Mandarin oranges aren't the best thing to eat on a boat, but persimmons are good for seasickness, so you can have these.""","""Oranges are bad on a ship, but persimmons you can eat. They help seasickness."""
「これは私の部屋よ。さあどうぞご遠慮なしにお通りください」,"""This is my room. Please do not hesitate to go through.""","""This is my room. Don't be so formal. Come on in,"" I said.","""Please, please,"" she called gaily to the others. ""You needn't stand on formality in my room."""
踊子はおじさんおじさんと言いながら、鳥屋に「水み戸と黄こう門もん漫まん遊ゆう記き」を読んでくれと頼んだ。しかし鳥屋はすぐに立って行った。続きを読んでくれと私に直接言えないので、おふくろから頼んで欲しいようなことを、踊子がしきりに言った。私は一つの期待を持って講談本を取り上げた。はたして踊子がするすると近寄って来た。私が読み出すと、彼女は私の肩に触さわるほどに顔を寄せて真剣な表情をしながら、眼をきらきらと輝かせて一心に私の額をみつめ、瞬またたき一つしなかった。これは彼女が本を読んで貰もらう時の癖らしかった。さっきも鳥屋とほとんど顔を重ねていた。私はそれを見ていたのだった。この美しく光る黒眼がちの大きい眼は踊子のいちばん美しい持ちものだった。二ふた重え瞼まぶたの線が言いようなく綺き麗れいだった。それから彼女は花のように笑うのだった。花のように笑うと言う言葉が彼女にはほんとうだった。,"The dancer said that he was an uncle, and asked Toriya to read ""Mimidoto and Huangkoumon Monmanman Yuuki"". But Toriya stood up immediately. I couldn't tell me to read the rest directly, so the dancer constantly said that I would like my mother to ask me. I picked up the storybook with one expectation. When the dancer did, he approached me. When I read it, she gazed at my forehead with her eyes shining, with a serious expression, touching my shoulders, and didn't blink. This was a habit when she read a book. I almost overlapped with Toriya a while ago. I was watching it. This beautifully shining black-eyed big eye was the dancer's most beautiful possession. The line of the eyelids with two lids was indescribably beautiful. Then she laughed like a flower. The word to laugh like a flower was true to her.","The dancing girl addressed the man as ""uncle"" and asked him to read ""The Story of the Lord of Mito"" to her, but he left immediately. She did not want to ask me directly, so she told the woman that she would like me to read the rest of ""The Story of the Lord of Mito"" for her. I picked up the book, with a certain expectation in my heart. Just as I hoped, the dancing girl scooted over beside me. Once I began reading, she brought her face close enough to touch my shoulder, her expression serious. Her eyes sparkled as she gazed at my forehead without blinking. It seemed to be her habit when she was being read to. Earlier, I had noticed that she had held her face right beside the poulterer. The dancing girl's most beautiful feature was her sparkling big dark eyes. The curve of her double eyelids was unspeakably lovely. Next was her flowerlike smile. In her case, the word ""flowerlike"" was absolutely accurate.","The girl shyly asked me to read her a piece from a storyteller's collection. I took up the book happily, a certain hope in my mind. Her head was almost at my shoulder as I started to read, and she looked up at me with a serious, intent expression, her eyes bright and unblinking. Her large eyes, almost black, were easily her best feature. The lines of the heavy lids were indescribably graceful. And her laugh was like a flower's laugh. A flower's laugh—the expression does not seem strained when I think of her."
踊子と間近に向かい合ったので、私はあわてて袂たもとから煙草たばこを取り出した。踊子がまた連れの女の前の煙草盆を引き寄せて私に近くしてくれた。やっぱり私は黙っていた。,"Facing the dancer up close, I hurriedly took out a cigarette from the source. The dancer also pulled the cigarette tray in front of her companion and brought me closer. After all I was silent.","Sitting so close, facing the dancing girl, I fumbled to pull a cigarette from my kimono sleeve. The girl took the ashtray sitting in front of her female companion and placed it near me. Naturally, I did not speak.","She sat near me, we were facing each other. I fumbled for tobacco and she handed me the ash tray in front of one of the other women. Still I said nothing."
私もまた非常に好戦的な気持だった。,I also felt very warlike.,"Now I, too, felt ready for a good battle.",""" I felt invincible."
そう断わってから、婆さんが話したところによると、爺さんは長年中ちゆう風ぶうを患わずらって、全身が不随になってしまっているのだそうだ。紙の山は、諸国から中風の養生を教えて来た手紙や、諸国から取り寄せた中風の薬の袋なのである。爺さんは峠を越える旅人から聞いたり、新聞の広告を見たりすると、その一つをも洩もらさずに、全国から中風の療法を聞き、売薬を求めたのだそうだ。そして、それらの手紙や紙袋を一つも捨てずに身の周りに置いて眺めながら暮らして来たのだそうだ。長年の間にそれが古ぼけた反ほ古ごの山を築いたのだそうだ。,"After refusing to do so, the old woman said that she had been suffering from the wind for many years and her whole body had become paralyzed. The pile of paper is a letter from each country teaching the cure of the middle wind, and a bag of medicine for the middle wind ordered from each country. When the old man heard from a traveler who crossed the pass or saw an advertisement in a newspaper, he heard the therapy of the middle wind from all over the country and asked for the drug to be sold without missing one of them. And he said that he lived by putting those letters and paper bags around him without throwing them away and looking at them. Over the years, it has built an old mountain of anti-old gods.","After thus apologizing, the old woman explained that her husband had suffered from palsy for many years and now his whole body was almost paralyzed. The mountains of papers were actually correspondence from every possible source describing treatments for palsy and packets of medicine the old man had ordered from throughout the country. Whenever he heard of a treatment from travelers who came over the pass or saw an advertisement in the newspaper, he never failed to send for it. He kept the papers around him in heaps, staring at them, never disposing of a single one. Through the years he had accumulated mountains of aging scraps of paper.","The old woman went out to talk to the dancers. """
「こんなにいただいてはもったいのうございます。申し訳ございません」,"""I'm very grateful to have this. I'm sorry.""","""This is far too much money. I just can't accept it.""","This is too much. I really can't take it."""
私は非常に素直に言った。泣いているのを見られても平気だった。私は何も考えていなかった。ただすがすがしい満足の中に静かに眠っているようだった。,I said very honestly. It was okay to see him crying. I wasn't thinking about anything. It seemed to sleep quietly in a refreshing satisfaction.,"I spoke meekly. I did not mind that he had seen me crying. I was not thinking about anything. I simply felt as though I were sleeping quietly, soothed and contented.",""" I saw no need to disguise the truth, and I was quite unashamed of my tears. I thought of nothing. It was as though I were slumbering in a sort of quiet fulfillment."
彼らの旅心は、最初私が考えていたほどせちがらいものでなく、野の匂においを失わないのんきなものであることも、私にわかって来た。親子兄弟であるだけに、それぞれ肉親らしい愛情で繫つながり合っていることも感じられた。雇やとい女おんなの百合子だけは、はにかみ盛りだからであるが、いつも私の前でむっつりしていた。,"It has also become clear to me that their travel spirit is not as sloppy as I initially thought, and that it is a carefree one that does not lose the scent of the field. As they are parents and children, I also felt that they were connected with each other with the affection of their relatives. Only Yuriko, a hired woman, was always sullen in front of me, though she was shy.","I realized that their sense of the road was not so hardened as I had first supposed. Rather, it was more of a lighthearted attitude that had not lost the scent of the fields. They were bound together by the familial affection you would expect between parent and child or brother and sister. The hired girl, Yuriko, was the only one who was sullen around me. Perhaps she was at the age when a girl is most bashful.","I came to see that the life of the traveling performer was not the forbidding one I had imagined. Rather it was easy-going, relaxed, carrying with it the scent of meadows and mountains. Then too this troupe was held together by close family affection. Only Yuriko, the hired girl—perhaps she was at a shy age—seemed uncomfortable before me."
「書生さんの紺こん飛白がすりはほんとにいいねえ」と言って、しげしげ私を眺めた。,"He looked at me sternly, saying, ""Shosei-san's dark blue flying white is really nice.""","""","The child's come to a dangerous age,"" the older woman said, arching her eyebrows as she tossed over a cloth."
私は二十歳、高等学校の制帽をかぶり、紺こん飛白がすりの着物に袴はかまをはき、学生カバンを肩にかけていた。一人伊豆の旅に出てから四日目のことだった。修しゆ善ぜん寺じ温泉に一夜泊り、湯が島温泉に二夜泊り、そして朴ほお歯ば〔＊２〕の高たか下げ駄たで天城を登って来たのだった。重なり合った山々や原生林や深い渓谷の秋に見み惚とれながらも、私は一つの期待に胸をときめかして道を急いでいるのだった。そのうちに大粒の雨が私を打ち始めた。折れ曲った急な坂道を駆かけ登った。ようやく峠の北口の茶屋に辿たどりついてほっとすると同時に、私はその入口で立ちすくんでしまった。あまりに期待がみごとに的中したからである。そこで旅芸人の一行が休んでいたのだ。,"At the age of 20, I wore a high school cap, a dark blue flying white kimono, a hakama, and a student bag on my shoulder. It was the fourth day since I went on a trip to Izu alone. I stayed overnight at Shuzenzenji Onsen, stayed at Yugashima Onsen for two nights, and climbed Amagi with the high or low price of Park Hootoba [* 2]. I was fascinated by the fall of the overlapping mountains, virgin forests and deep valleys, but I was rushing to the road with one expectation. Then a heavy rain began to hit me. I ran up a steep, bent slope. I was relieved to finally reach the teahouse at the north exit of the pass, and at the same time I stood at the entrance. This is because the expectations were so good. There, a group of traveling entertainers were resting.","I was twenty years old. I wore my school cap, hakama over my indigo-dyed kimono, and carried a student's bag over my shoulder. It was the fourth day of my solitary journey down the Izu Peninsula. I had stayed at Shuzenji Hot Spring one night, then two nights at Yugashima. And now, wearing high clogs, I was climbing Amagi. Although I had been enchanted by the layers upon layers of mountains, the virgin forests, and the shades of autumn in the deep valleys, I was hurrying along this road, my chest pounding with a certain expectation. Before long, great drops of rain began to pelt me, and I bolted up the steep, twisted road. I was relieved to reach the teahouse on the north side of the pass at last, but stopped short in the doorway. My expectation had been realized all too splendidly. The troupe of itinerant performers was inside, taking a rest..","My clothes were of the sort students wear, dark kimono, high wooden sandals, a school cap, a book sack over my shoulder. I had spent three nights at hot springs near the center of the peninsula, and now, my fourth day out of Tokyo, I was climbing toward Amagi Pass and South Izu. The autumn scenery was pleasant enough, mountains rising one on another, open forests, deep valleys, but I was excited less by the scenery than by a certain hope. Large drops of rain began to fall. I ran on up the road, now steep and winding, and at the mouth of the pass I came to a teahouse. I stopped short in the doorway. It was almost too lucky: the dancers were resting inside."
踊子が帰った後は、とても眠れそうもなく頭が冴さえ冴ざえしているので、私は廊下に出て呼んでみた。,"After the dancer returned, I couldn't sleep very much and my head was clear, so I went out to the corridor and called.","After the entertainers left, I could not get to sleep. My mind was so keen.","I felt clear-headed and alive when they had gone. I would not be able to sleep, I knew. From the hall I called in to the salesman."
引き返して来ると、白おし粉ろいを洗い落した踊子が路みちばたにうずくまって犬の頭を撫なでていた。私は自分の宿に帰ろうとして言った。,"When I turned back, the dancer who had washed off the white powder was crouching on the side of the road and stroking the dog's head. I said I was going back to my inn.","As we walked back, we found the dancing girl, her face washed clean of the white makeup, crouching by the road, petting the puppy on the head. I spoke to her as I started back to my room alone.","IV ON the way back, just off the road, we saw the little dancer petting a dog. She had washed away her makeup."
「体が悪いんですもの、あんなに歩くと弱ってしまって」と蒼あおい顔でぐったりしていた。百合子はかたくなってうつむいてしまった。踊子は階下で宿の子供と遊んでいた。私を見るとおふくろに縋すがりついて活動に行かせてくれとせがんでいたが、顔を失ったようにぼんやり私のところに戻って下駄を直してくれた。,"""I'm sick, but when I walk like that, I'm weakened,"" he said with a blue face. Yuriko became stiff and turned down. The dancer was playing downstairs with the children at the inn. When I saw me, I was clinging to my mother and begging me to go to the activity, but as if I had lost my face, I vaguely returned to me and fixed my clogs.","I'm too weak to walk that far."" She slumped down, her face pale. Yuriko stiffened and hung her head. The dancing girl was playing with the innkeeper's children on the stairs. When she heard me, she clung to the woman, begging for permission to go to a movie with me. She returned crestfallen. She set out my clogs.","""I couldn't, thank you. I'm simply not up to so much walking."" Yuriko stared stiffly at the floor. The little dancer was downstairs playing with the inn children. When she saw me come down she ran off and began wheedling the older woman for permission to go to the movies. She came back looking distant and crestfallen. ""I don't see anything wrong."
「ああ、踊子はまだ宴席に坐っていたのだ。坐って太鼓を打っているのだ」,"""Oh, the dancer was still sitting at the banquet. He was sitting and playing the drums.""","""Oh, the dancing girl is still at the party. She's sitting, playing the drum.""",""" Ah, she's still there. Still there and playing the drum."
下りは私と栄吉とがわざと遅れてゆっくり話しながら出発した。二町ばかり歩くと、下から踊子が走って来た。,"On the descent, I and Eikichi deliberately delayed and started talking slowly. When I walked only in two towns, a dancer ran from below.","On the way down, Eikichi and I purposely hung back, talking at leisure. When we had walked about two hundred yards, the dancing girl came back up from below.","On the way down I purposely stayed behind talking to Eikichi, but after two hundred yards or so the little dancer came running back up."
「いいや、学校の寄宿舎にいるんです」,"""No, I'm in the school dormitory.""","I live in the school dormitory there.""",""" In a dormitory."
千代子も百合子も同じ座敷へ行った。,Chiyoko and Yuriko went to the same tatami room.,The woman was also looking across the way. Chiyoko and Yuriko went to the same gathering.,"Chiyoko and Yuriko went over to the restaurant a little later, and in an hour or so the four of them came back."

「それは、抜いて金歯を入れさえすればなんでもないわ」と踊子の声がふと私の耳にはいったので振り返ってみると、踊子は千代子と並んで歩き、おふくろと百合子とがそれに少し遅れていた。私の振り返ったのを気づかないらしく千代子が言った。,"""It's nothing if you pull it out and put in gold teeth,"" the dancer's voice suddenly came into my ears, so when I looked back, the dancer walked alongside Chiyoko, and my mother and Yuriko were a little behind it. rice field. Chiyoko said that she didn't seem to notice me looking back.","""It wouldn't be hard to pull them and replace them with gold teeth."" I turned around when I overheard the dancing girl's voice. She was walking with Chiyoko. The older woman and Yuriko were a short distance behind them. The dancing girl did not appear to notice me looking back. I heard Chiyoko reply.","Then you'd never notice,"" the dancer's voice came to me suddenly. I looked back."
