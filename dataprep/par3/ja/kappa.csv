それからかれこれ一週間の後、僕はふと医者のチャックに珍しい話を聞きました。というのはあのトックの家に幽霊の出るという話なのです。そのころにはもう雌の河童はどこかほかへ行ってしまい、僕らの友だちの詩人の家も写真師のステュディオに変わっていました。なんでもチャックの話によれば、このステュディオでは写真をとると、トックの姿もいつの間にか必ず朦朧と客の後ろに映っているとかいうことです。もっともチャックは物質主義者ですから、死後の生命などを信じていません。現にその話をした時にも悪意のある微笑を浮かべながら、「やはり霊魂というものも物質的存在とみえますね」などと註釈めいたことをつけ加えていました。僕も幽霊を信じないことはチャックとあまり変わりません。けれども詩人のトックには親しみを感じていましたから、さっそく本屋の店へ駆けつけ、トックの幽霊に関する記事やトックの幽霊の写真の出ている新聞や雑誌を買ってきました。なるほどそれらの写真を見ると、どこかトックらしい河童が一匹、老若男女の河童の後ろにぼんやりと姿を現わしていました。しかし僕を驚かせたのはトックの幽霊の写真よりもトックの幽霊に関する記事、――ことにトックの幽霊に関する心霊学協会の報告です。僕はかなり逐語的にその報告を訳しておきましたから、下に大略を掲げることにしましょう。ただし括弧の中にあるのは僕自身の加えた註釈なのです。――,"A week later, I suddenly heard a rare story from doctor Chuck. That's the story of a ghost appearing in that Tok's house. By that time, the female kappa had gone somewhere else, and our friend's poet's house had changed to a photographer's studio. According to Chuck, when you take a picture of this studio, Tok's appearance is always reflected behind the haze and the customer. However, since Chuck is a materialist, he does not believe in life after death. In fact, when I talked about it, he added that he smiled maliciously and commented, ""The soul also seems to be a material existence."" Not believing in ghosts is not much different from Chuck. However, I felt familiar with the poet Tok, so I rushed to the bookstore and bought newspapers and magazines with articles about Tok's ghosts and pictures of Tok's ghosts. Indeed, when I looked at those pictures, I found a kappa that seemed to be a tok, vaguely appearing behind the kappa of all ages. But what surprised me was the article about Tok's ghosts rather than the pictures of Tok's ghosts-especially the report of the Spiritual Society on Tok's ghosts. I've translated the report fairly verbatim, so let's outline it below. However, what is in parentheses is a comment I added. ――","About a week later, Doctor Chack told me of a strange rumour that the house where Tock the poet had lived was haunted. By that time the she-kappa had moved out, and the house was now a photographer's studio. Chack told me that in every photograph taken in that studio, a dim image of the dead poet could be seen behind the picture. But the doctor was a materialist, and did not believe in the immortality of the soul. Even when he himself told me that the house was haunted, he added with a malignant smile on his face: ""The soul seems to be a material being just as the body is."" I don't believe in ghosts either. But as I had a friendly feeling towards Tock the poet, I ran to a book-seller's at once and bought some newspapers and magazines containing the accounts and photographs of the ghost. There were lots of pictures—he-kappas and she-kappas, young and old—and behind each of them I certainly did see, though indistinctly, the image of a kappa who looked somewhat like Tock. But what was more remarkable was the articles, especially the report of the Society for Psychical Research. I translated it word for word into Japanese, as correctly as I could, the outline of which will be given below. The notes in brackets are mine.... REPORT ON THE GHOST OF","A week or so afterwards, I happened to hear a rather weird story from Dr Chak. Apparently, there had been talk of a ghost appearing in Tok’s house. By now, Tok’s woman had taken herself off somewhere else and the house of our poet friend had been turned into a photographer’s studio. The story as I heard it from Chak was that, on every photograph taken in this studio, the image of Tok was somehow or other always reflected mistily behind the picture of the actual subject. Of course, being a materialist, Chak did not put any faith in things such as a life after death. In fact, while he was giving me an account of the story, he added, almost by way of commentary and with a smile that had a good deal of malice in it: ‘It would seem, after all, that the soul does have a material existence, wouldn’t it?’ My attitude of disbelief in ghosts was not very different from Chak’s. However, out of friendship for Tok the poet, I rushed straight off to a bookstall and bought every newspaper and magazine that carried a report or photograph of Tok’s ghost. There was evidently something in the rumours, for when I examined the photographs, behind each subject—young or old, male or female—there did appear, though very indistinctly, the image of a Kappa which resembled Tok. (One couldn’t quite pinpoint this resemblance, but, nevertheless, it was there.) But, in my case, far more disturbing than these photographs were the reports about Tok’s ghost and in particular a report on the affair from the Society for Psychic Studies. I worked out a fairly close and literal version of this Report, of which I think it might be as well to give you the broad outlines. (Please note that those parts in brackets are my own comments.)

大寺院の内部もまた広大です。そのコリント風の円柱の立った中には参詣人が何人も歩いていました。しかしそれらは僕らのように非常に小さく見えたものです。そのうちに僕らは腰の曲がった一匹の河童に出合いました。するとラップはこの河童にちょっと頭を下げた上、丁寧にこう話しかけました。,"The interior of the great temple is also vast.

Among its Corinthian columns moved herds of worshippers; but even they, in spite of their numbers, seemed just as small and insignificant as we, in face of the vastness of the edifice.

He leads the Quorax Party as I said just now, but behind him is another kappa who is pulling the wires. It is Quiqui, President of the Pou-Fou."" 'Pou-Fou,' which is the name of a newspaper, also is a meaningless interjection, and the only Japanese equivalent I can think of is 'Ah.' ""But,"" Gael went on, “even Quiqui hasn't the right to call himself his own master, because he is under my control. "" ""Under your control?","‘Oh! Oh! Wait a minute! Listen to what I have to say first, before you butt in like this. Those speeches— surely you realize they’re all a pack of lies.

It’s only you Japanese with your prejudices, you know, who would use this term “lies” in such a wholesale way. Instead, we Kappas would. . . . Oh, but let’s leave that be, shall we? It’s Loppe I want to talk about, not his speeches or his lies. Now, Loppe—he’s in control of the Quorax Party. But there’s someone behind Loppe, and in control of him—and that’s Qui Qui, the president of the Pou Fou newspaper.’ (This word ‘Pou Fou’ is, again, an interjection. It has no real meaning, and if I were obliged to offer a translation, I suppose something on the lines of ‘Ah’ is about the nearest you could get.) ‘But don’t run away with the idea,’ went on Gael, ‘that this Qui Qui is his own boss. Not a bit of it—there’s yet one more person above and beyond him, none other than the Gael you see in front of you.’"

Indeed, it is a large building that is ten times as large as Nikolai-do. Not only is it a large building that combines all architectural styles into one.

To be sure, Lap had not exaggerated, for the edifice was a good ten times larger than the Nikolai Hall. Nor was mere size the only thing about it. The other striking feature was that this one building combined within itself just about every style of architecture you could name. Standing in front of the Great Tabernacle and looking up at its tall pagodas and dome-like roof, even I felt a sense of something uncanny and forbidding. In fact, these pagodas and so on looked like so many tentacles pointing to and clutching at heaven.

As soon as Mrs. Hop entered the studio, she already felt a psychic air and vomited several times, causing convulsions throughout her body. According to his wife, this is because he loves the poet Tok's intense cigarettes, and as a result, his spiritual air also contains nicotine.","We seventeen members of the Society for Psychical Research, headed by Mr. Peck, President, and accompanied by Mrs. Hop, our most trusted medium, met in a room of the above-mentioned studio at 10: 30 a.m., September 17th. As soon as she entered the studio Mrs. Hop felt a spiritual atmosphere, and, with convulsions all over her body, vomited several times. She said that this was because the spiritual atmosphere of Mr. Tock contained nicotine as the result of his indulgence in strong tobacco.","We, the seventeen members of the Society for Psychic Studies whose names are recorded above, together with the President of the Society, Mr Pek, assembled at 10.30 in the forenoon of September 17th in a room at the above-mentioned studio. We were accompanied by our most reliable medium, Madame Hop. From the moment of entering the said studio, Madame Hop discerned a spiritual atmosphere. She suffered convulsions in her whole body and even vomited a number of times. Madame Hop herself imputed this reaction on her part to the fact of Tok’s being addicted to full-strength tobacco and the resultant high nicotine content in his spiritual atmosphere."

こういう間にも大騒ぎはいよいよ盛んになるばかりです。クラバックはピアノに向かったまま、傲然と我々をふり返っていました。が、いくら傲然としていても、いろいろのものの飛んでくるのはよけないわけにゆきません。従ってつまり二三秒置きにせっかくの態度も変わったわけです。しかしとにかくだいたいとしては大音楽家の威厳を保ちながら、細い目をすさまじくかがやかせていました。僕は――僕ももちろん危険を避けるためにトックを小楯にとっていたものです。が、やはり好奇心に駆られ、熱心にマッグと話しつづけました。,"In the meantime, the fuss is just getting more and more popular. Clavak looked back at us in a hurry, heading for the piano. However, no matter how arrogant it may be, it is inevitable that various things will fly. Therefore, in other words, the attitude changed every few seconds. However, as a matter of fact, while maintaining the dignity of a great musician, his narrow eyes were tremendously shining.

As for me—well, I was hiding myself behind Tock to avoid the missiles, but I was curious and talked on with Mag.","In the meanwhile, the uproar had grown and the scene was even more confused. Still sitting at the piano, Krabach was surveying us haughtily. But haughtiness alone was not good enough to help him take evading action against the variety of objects that were hurled in his direction from all over the concert hall. So, every two or three seconds, this carefully assumed posture had to be abandoned. Yet even so he did somehow manage, on the whole, to maintain the dignity and the presence of the grand musician as his narrow eyes flashed fiercely. I, too, fully conscious of the danger I was in, took great pains to manoeuvre myself so that Tok would act as a shield against all the flying objects. However, in spite of recognizing the dangers, I found it hard to restrain my curiosity, and couldn’t stop myself from continuing, in deadly earnest, my discussion with Mag."

Suddenly, the voice that echoed in the hall like a god was ""No performance"". I was surprised at this voice and looked back unintentionally. The main voice is undeniably the tallest police officer in the back seat. When I turned around, the policeman sat down calmly and yelled ""No performance"" again than before. I did. then,--","Full of passion, Craback continued his performance on the piano as if he were fighting, when all of a sudden the hall rang with a thunderous voice: ""Stop!” I was surprised, and looked back, and saw an extraordinarily big police-kappa sitting entirely at ease on a back seat.

It was obviously from the quite distinguished looking policeman who was sitting in the very back row.

I had no choice, so I repeated ""Criminal Code Article 1,285"" in my mouth and hurried to Mag's house. The philosopher Mag is a guest lover. In fact, in the dimly lit room today, Judge Pep, Doctor Chuck, and Glass Glass Company President Geel gathered to raise cigarette smoke under the seven-colored glass Lantaan. Judge Pep was there, which I like most of all. I asked Pep if it was too early to put it on the chair, instead of checking Article 1,285 of the Criminal Code.","With these words the officer walked quickly away. I did not know what to do, so I hurried to Mag's house, repeating between my teeth 'Article 1,285 of the Penal Code.' Mag the philosopher likes to have company. That day I found in his dusky room Judge Pep and Doctor Chack and Gael the president of the glass manufacturing company, smoking freely under the seven-color glass lantern. I was glad to meet Judge Pep, for I thought that he could save me the trouble of looking into Article 1,285 of the Penal Code, and as soon as I sat down on a chair I asked:","Having flung this parting remark at me, the policeman promptly brought our conversation to an end and took himself off. I decided that, under the circumstances, the only thing left for me to do was to get to Mag’s house as quickly as I could; so, muttering away to myself the policeman’s last words— Penal Code, Clause 1,285’—I set off there. Mag the philosopher loved entertaining. In fact, he had visitors that very day in his dimly-lit room: among them were Pep the judge, Chak the doctor, and Gael the glass corporation magnate. Between them, they had collected a thick tobacco haze which lay heavy under the seven-coloured stained-glass lantern. Of course, it couldn’t have turned out more fortunate for me that Pep the judge was among the visitors. I made a bee-line for Pep, sat down next to him and started questioning him at once. This was just as good as, if not better than, checking on the Penal Code, Clause 1,285!"

僕はこのラップという河童にバッグにも劣らぬ世話になりました。が、その中でも忘れられないのはトックという河童に紹介されたことです。トックは河童仲間の詩人です。詩人が髪を長くしていることは我々人間と変わりません。僕は時々トックの家へ退屈しのぎに遊びにゆきました。トックはいつも狭い部屋に高山植物の鉢植えを並べ、詩を書いたり煙草をのんだり、いかにも気楽そうに暮らしていました。そのまた部屋の隅には雌の河童が一匹、（トックは自由恋愛家ですから、細君というものは持たないのです。）編み物か何かしていました。トックは僕の顔を見ると、いつも微笑してこう言うのです。（もっとも河童の微笑するのはあまりいいものではありません。少なくとも僕は最初のうちはむしろ無気味に感じたものです。）,"I was taken care of by this kappa, a kappa, as much as a bag. However, one of the most unforgettable things is that it was introduced to a kappa called Tok. Tok is a fellow kappa poet. The fact that poets have long hair is no different from us humans. I sometimes went to Tok's house to get bored and play. Tok always lined up potted alpine plants in a small room, writing poetry and smoking, and lived comfortably. Also, in the corner of the room, there was a female kappa (I don't have a kid because Tok is a free love lover), knitting or something. When Tok looks at my face, he always smiles and says: (The kappa's smile isn't very good, though. At least I felt rather eerie at first.)","I am as much indebted to Lap as to Bag the fisher-kappa. They both helped me in many ways. But it was Lap who introduced me to another kappa named Tock. Tock was a kappa poet. Of course he had long hair, for kappa poets wear their hair long just as our poets do. I often went to see him by way of killing the time. He looked as free of care as could be, smoking and writing poems in his little room decorated with alpine plants in pots. He was a free lover and had no wife, but I used to find a she-kappa in a corner of the room, knitting or something. He always welcomed me with a smile, though it was not very pleasant to see a smiling kappa—at first it made me feel rather uneasy—but he would greet me with a smile and say: ""Hello!","Lap did any number of things to help me. In fact, he was just as considerate to me as Bag. It was Lap who introduced me to a Kappa called Tok—and this was the most unforgettable of his many kindnesses. Tok was one of the poets in a circle of Kappa artists. He grew his hair long, just like our Japanese poets. Now and again, to help a dull day along, I would go to Tok’s house. He always seemed the picture of contentment, writing a poem, smoking a cigarette in his cosy room festooned with potted alpine plants. In a corner of this room, there was always a she-Kappa, busy with her knitting or something of the sort. (Tok believed in free love, so he had not gone in for a wife.) As soon as he saw that it was me, Tok would greet me with a smile. (I must say, I never found anything at all attractive about the Kappa smile: indeed, during the first few months, I found it hard not to feel there was something forbidding about it.)"

僕はあの音楽会以来、クラバックにも友だちになっていましたから、とにかくこの大音楽家の家へラップをつれ出すことにしました。クラバックはトックに比べれば、はるかに贅沢に暮らしています。というのは資本家のゲエルのように暮らしているという意味ではありません。ただいろいろの骨董を、――タナグラの人形やペルシアの陶器を部屋いっぱいに並べた中にトルコ風の長椅子を据え、クラバック自身の肖像画の下にいつも子どもたちと遊んでいるのです。が、きょうはどうしたのか両腕を胸へ組んだまま、苦い顔をしてすわっていました。のみならずそのまた足もとには紙屑が一面に散らばっていました。ラップも詩人トックといっしょにたびたびクラバックには会っているはずです。しかしこの容子に恐れたとみえ、きょうは丁寧にお時宜をしたなり、黙って部屋の隅に腰をおろしました。,"I've been friends with Krabak since that concert, so I decided to take the rap to this big musician's house anyway. Krabak lives much more luxuriously than Tok. That doesn't mean that you live like the capitalist Geel. Just a variety of antiques-a Turkish-style chaise lounge in a room full of Tanagra dolls and Persian pottery, always playing with the children under the portrait of Krabak himself. However, I was sitting with a bitter face with my arms folded around my chest. Not only that, but also paper scraps were scattered all over at my feet. Rap should have met Krabak often with the poet Tok. However, he seemed afraid of this Yoko, and today he was polite and timely, and silently sat down in the corner of the room.","As I had been on friendly terms with Craback since that concert, I decided to take Lap to that great musician. Craback was living in greater luxury than Tock, though not at all like Gael the capitalist. His room was full of Tanagra figurines, Persian crockeries and other curios, and on a divan under his portrait he was often seen playing with his children. That day, however, we found him sitting there sullenly by himself with folded arms, lots of torn pieces of paper scattered at his feet. Lap was evidently intimidated by the sight, although he had doubtless seen the kappa on many occasions before in company with Tock the poet. He made a courteous bow and sat down in a corner.","After that memorable concert I had made a great friend of Krabach, so I decided that it would be a good thing if I could somehow get Lap to the house of this redoubtable musician. By comparison with Tok, Krabach lived a pretty extravagant life. I wouldn’t like it to be thought from this, of course, that he lived on the same scale as a capitalist like Gael. But he did have the means that had enabled him to collect a good deal of bric-à-brac: there were Tanagra puppets and pieces of Persian pottery cluttering up the whole room; in the middle of it all stood a Turkish style chaise-longue. And usually Krabach himself would be sporting with his children underneath his own portrait. However, today, something seemed to have gone amiss, for Krabach was sitting stolidly, his face glum and his arms clasped solemnly and tightly to his chest. And round his feet, the floor was littered with crumpled pieces of paper. Lap, in the natural course of events, was bound to have come across Krabach from time to time—in company with Tok the poet. But on this particular day, he seemed to be unnerved by the sight of Krabach in this condition and, as soon as he decently could after he had made his bow, he quietly crept away and sat down in a corner of the room."
「お前の名は？」,"""What's your name?""","""Your name?""",‘Name?’
僕はいつも日暮れがたになると、この部屋にチャックやバッグを迎え、河童の言葉を習いました。いや、彼らばかりではありません。特別保護住民だった僕にだれも皆好奇心を持っていましたから、毎日血圧を調べてもらいに、わざわざチャックを呼び寄せるゲエルという硝子ガラス会社の社長などもやはりこの部屋へ顔を出したものです。しかし最初の半月ほどの間に一番僕と親しくしたのはやはりあのバッグという漁夫だったのです。,"Whenever it was dark, I welcomed a zipper and a bag in this room and learned the words of a kappa. No, they are not the only ones. Everyone was curious about me as a special shelter, so the president of a glass glass company called Geel, who bothered to call Chuck to check his blood pressure every day, also came to this room. However, it was the fisherman named Bag that was the closest to me during the first half month.","Every evening I saw Chack and Bag in this room, that is, in the drawing-room, and learned the kappa language from them. Of course I had many other visitors. I was a ""specially protected inhabitant"" as I said before, and naturally every kappa desired to have a look at me. Gael, for example, often came to see me. He was the president of a glass manufacturing company, and used to send for Chack every day to have his blood pressure examined. But my best friend during the first two weeks or so was Bag the fisher-kappa.","This room was the place where, every evening, Chak or Bag or another of my Kappa acquaintances joined me in a Kappanese lesson. And, of course, I had many other visitors, for my status as a ‘specially protected person’ invited curiosity. Gael, the director of a glass corporation, was one of those who dropped in regularly. He had an arrangement with Chak for a daily blood pressure check. But, for the first fortnight or so, it was Bag the fisher Kappa who befriended me most of all."

するとクラバックは立ち上がるが早いか、タナグラの人形をひっつかみ、いきなり床の上にたたきつけました。ラップはよほど驚いたとみえ、何か声をあげて逃げようとしました。が、クラバックはラップや僕にはちょっと「驚くな」という手真似をした上、今度は冷やかにこう言うのです。,"Then, as soon as Kurabak stood up, he grabbed the Tanagra doll and suddenly slammed it on the floor. Rap seemed very surprised and tried to escape with a loud voice. However, Kurabak imitated rap and a little ""surprise"" to me, and this time he said coldly.","Craback suddenly stood up, arid as quick as thought grasped a Tanagra figurine and dashed it to the floor. Lap .was so frightened that he gave a cry and was about to run away, when Craback made a sign to him and me not to be scared.","At this, Krabach jumped up from his chair, grabbed hold of the Tanagra puppet and flung it violently at the floor. Lap, looking quite horrified, let out a scream as he made tc escape from the room However, Krabach, after making a gesture to us (Lap and me) that I took to mean ‘Don’t be afraid’, said:"

しかし硝子ガラス会社の社長のゲエルは人なつこい河童だったのに違いません。僕はたびたびゲエルといっしょにゲエルの属している俱楽部クラブへ行き、愉快に一晩を暮らしました。これは一つにはその俱楽部はトックの属している超人俱楽部よりもはるかに居心のよかったためです。のみならずまたゲエルの話は哲学者のマッグの話のように深みを持っていなかったにせよ、僕には全然新しい世界を、――広い世界をのぞかせました。ゲエルは、いつも純金の匙に珈琲カッフェの茶碗をかきまわしながら、快活にいろいろの話をしたものです。,"However, Geel, the president of the glass glass company, must have been a friendly kappa. I often went with Geel to the club that Geel belongs to and lived happily overnight. This is partly because the club was far more welcoming than the superhuman club to which Tok belongs. Not only that, but also Geel's story wasn't as deep as the philosopher Mag's, but it gave me a whole new world-a wide world. Geel always talked about various things cheerfully while swirling a cup of coffee caffe in a spoon of pure gold.","But Gael, president of the glass manufacturing company, was certainly an amiable kappa. I often went with him to the club of which he was a member and spent a pleasant evening. I felt much more at home there than at the Super-kappas' Club to which Tock belonged. Gael was not much of a thinker as Mag the philosopher was, but he opened my eyes to a world entirely unknown to me—a world wide and strange. He always chatted in good spirits, stirring his coffee with a gold spoon.","In spite of it all, there was no doubting that this Gael, managing director of a huge glass corporation as he was, was an extremely good mixer. From time to time, I went with Gael to his club and spent an extremely delightful evening with him there. One reason for the pleasant atmosphere was that it was far more cosy than the superKappa club to which Tok belonged; for another thing, while it did not contain the depth of Mag the philosopher’s conversation, Gael’s talk still allowed me to look in on an entirely new world—and a wide world at that. For Gael was one who would talk in a gay and lively way about everything under the sun; and, as he talked, he was always stirring his coffee with his solid gold spoon."
僕は実際疲れていましたから、ラップといっしょに長老に従い、香の匂いのする廊下伝いにある部屋へはいりました。そのまた小さい部屋の隅には黒いヴェヌスの像の下に山葡萄が一ふさ献じてあるのです。僕はなんの装飾もない僧房を想像していただけにちょっと意外に感じました。すると長老は僕の容子にこういう気もちを感じたとみえ、僕らに椅子を薦める前に半ば気の毒そうに説明しました。,"I was actually tired, so I followed the elder with the rap and went into the room along the scented corridor. In the corner of the small room, a mountain grape is dedicated under the black statue of Venus. I was a little surprised just to imagine a monastery without any decoration. Then the elder seemed to feel this kind of feeling for my Yoko, and before recommending us a chair, he explained half-sorry.","I was very tired. We followed the old kappa along a corridor that reeked faintly of burned incense into a little room. In a corner of that room I saw a black statue of Venus, at the foot of which was placed a bunch of wild grapes. To one who had expected a plain, unadorned monastic chamber, the whole atmosphere of the room was rather baffling. The old kappa saw how I felt, and before offering me a chair explained half regretfully:","In fact, I was indeed weary. So, with Lap, I followed the elder along a gallery filled with a strong smell of incense. We entered a room which was quite small and in the corner of which stood a black figure of Venus; underneath the statue, as an offering, lay a bunch of wild grapes. I had been expecting something of the order of an austere chamber with no decoration of this kind, and the room caused me some surprise which the elder must have noticed from my expression, for before he offered me a chair he embarked on an explanation, half regretfully and half apologetically."

それから先は大混乱です。「警官横暴！」「クラバック、弾け！弾け！」「莫迦！」「畜生！」「ひっこめ！」「負けるな！」――こういう声のわき上がった中に椅子は倒れる、プログラムは飛ぶ、おまけにだれが投げるのか、サイダアの空罎や石ころやかじりかけの胡瓜さえ降ってくるのです。僕は呆っ気にとられましたから、トックにその理由を尋ねようとしました。が、トックも興奮したとみえ、椅子の上に突っ立ちながら、「クラバック、弾け！弾け！」とわめきつづけています。のみならずトックの雌の河童もいつの間に敵意を忘れたのか、「警官横暴」と叫んでいることは少しもトックに変わりません。僕はやむを得ずマッグに向かい、「どうしたのです？」と尋ねてみました。,"After that, it's a big mess. ""Policeman domineering!"" ""Cucumber, pop! Pop!"" ""Huge!"" ""Burning!"" ""Hidden!"" ""Don't lose!"" Who throws it, the sky of Sidaa, the stones, and even the cucumbers that are about to bite. I was so disappointed that I tried to ask Tok why. However, Tok seemed excited, and while standing on the chair, he continued to scream, ""Kurabak, pop! Pop!"". Not only that, but the female Kappa of Tok also forgot his hostility, and screaming ""Policeman domineering"" is no different from Tok. I had no choice but to go to Mag and ask, ""What's wrong?""","""Tyranny!” ""Down with police tyranny!” ""Play, Craback, play on!” ""Idiot!"" ""Beast!” ""Get out!” ""Don't give in!” And amid these tumultuous cries, chairs were overturned, programmes flew, stones and empty bottles of cider and half-bitten cucumbers came down like rain. I was amazed, and asked Tock what on earth all that was. But he was too excited to pay attention to me. Standing upon his seat, he was shouting at the top of his voice: “Play, Craback, play on” Even his she-kappa, who seemed to have lost her animosity towards the musician, was screaming out, “Police! Tyranny! “So I turned to Mag and asked,” What's all this?""","Shouts and screams echoed and re-echoed across the body of the hall. ‘Down with police tyranny!’ ‘Play on, Krabach! Play on!’ ‘You bloody foul!’ ‘You filthy bastard! ’ ‘Get out! Go on, get out of here! ’ ‘Don’t let yourself be browbeaten, Krabach. Play on!’ And while these shouts were being bandied about, chairs were up-ended, programmes flew and fluttered in all directions and, whoever threw them I’ve no idea, empty cider bottles, pebbles and half-chewed cucumbers rained down. Absolutely dumbfounded, I turned to ask Tok what it was all about. But Tok, apparently quite carried away, had climbed on to his seat and kept on shrieking, ‘Krabach, Krabach! Play on! Keep on playing!’ His excitement seemed to have infected his woman, for she, no less worked up now than he, kept screaming away: ‘Police tyranny! ’ At some point along the line, she had obviously quite forgotten her antipathy to Krabach. There was no point in trying to get anything out of either of them. So the best I could do was to put my question to Mag."

お産の話をしたついでですから、僕がこの国へ来た三月目に偶然ある街の角で見かけた、大きいポスタアの話をしましょう。その大きいポスタアの下には喇叭を吹いている河童だの剣を持っている河童だのが十二三匹描いてありました。それからまた上には河童の使う、ちょうど時計のゼンマイに似た螺旋文字が一面に並べてありました。この螺旋文字を翻訳すると、だいたいこういう意味になるのです。これもあるいは細かいところは間違っているかもしれません。が、とにかく僕としては僕といっしょに歩いていた、ラップという河童の学生が大声に読み上げてくれる言葉をいちいちノオトにとっておいたのです。,"Now that I've talked about childbirth, let's talk about the big poster that I happened to see on the corner of a city in the third month of my arrival in this country. Under the big poster, there were twelve kappa with a sword and a kappa blowing a whisper. Then, on the top again, the spiral letters used by Kappa, just like the royal fern of the clock, were lined up all over. When you translate this spiral character, it means something like this. This or the details may be wrong. But anyway, for me, I took the word Rap, a kappa student who was walking with me, to read aloud to Nooto.","By the way, when I had stayed in that country for a month or two, I saw a big poster at a street corner. On the lower part of it were painted about a dozen kappas, some blowing trumpets, some armed with swords. The upper part was covered with spiral kappa characters that looked like watch-springs. A student kappa called Lap, who was walking with me then, read them to me in a loud voice, and I noted down every word very carefully. I am afraid that here again I may have made some minor mistakes in my translation, but this is about what those spirals said:","While we are on the topic of childbirth, let me tell you about something that I chanced on when I’d only been in Kappaland for just over a couple of months There was a huge poster at a street corner. The lower half of the poster showed figures of a dozen or so Kappas, some of these figures were blowing trumpets, others brandished swords. The whole of the rest of the surface of the poster was taken up by writing in Kappa script; it is not an attractive form of script—it is spiral and looks for all the world like so many watch-springs. I think I’ve got the broad gist of what these spiral characters said, though here again there could well be mistakes of detail, I’m airaid. At any rate, I did my best under the circumstances; I had a Kappa student called Lap with me and he was kind enough to read the writing off to me. As he read in a loud voice, I took the slogan down in my notebook, word for word."

I’d suddenly realized, you see, that while I’d been absorbed in watching what was going on, he’d robbed me of my fountain pen. But the clammy and slimy skin of a Kappa makes it no easy task for us human beings to lay hands on one. This chap squirmed like an eel and wriggled out of my grip and made off like a flash.

僕はこの先を話す前にちょっと河童というものを説明しておかなければなりません。河童はいまだに実在するかどうかも疑問になっている動物です。が、それは僕自身が彼らの間に住んでいた以上、少しも疑う余地はないはずです。ではまたどういう動物かと言えば、頭に短い毛のあるのはもちろん、手足に水搔きのついていることも「水虎考略」などに出ているのと著しい違いはありません。身長もざっと一メエトルを越えるか越えぬくらいでしょう。体重は医者のチャックによれば、二十ポンドから三十ポンドまで、――まれには五十何ポンドぐらいの大河童もいると言っていました。それから頭のまん中には楕円形の皿があり、そのまた皿は年齢により、だんだん固さを加えるようです。現に年をとったバッグの皿は若いチャックの皿などとは全然手ざわりも違うのです。しかし一番不思議なのは河童の皮膚の色のことでしょう。河童は我々人間のように一定の皮膚の色を持っていません。なんでもその周囲の色と同じ色に変わってしまう、――たとえば草の中にいる時には草のように緑色に変わり、岩の上にいる時には岩のように灰色に変わるのです。これはもちろん河童に限らず、カメレオンにもあることです。あるいは河童は皮膚組織の上に何かカメレオンに近いところを持っているのかもしれません。僕はこの事実を発見した時、西国の河童は緑色であり、東北の河童は赤いという民俗学上の記録を思い出しました。のみならずバッグを追いかける時、突然どこへ行ったのか、見えなくなったことを思い出しました。しかも河童は皮膚の下によほど厚い脂肪を持っているとみえ、この地下の国の温度は比較的低いのにもかかわらず、（平均華氏五十度前後です。）着物というものを知らず［＃「知らず」は底本では「知らす」］にいるのです。もちろんどの河童も目金をかけたり、巻煙草の箱を携えたり、金入れを持ったりはしているでしょう。しかし河童はカンガルウのように腹に袋を持っていますから、それらのものをしまう時にも格別不便はしないのです。ただ僕におかしかったのは腰のまわりさえおおわないことです。僕はある時この習慣をなぜかとバッグに尋ねてみました。すると［＃「すると」は底本では「ずると」］バッグはのけぞったまま、いつまでもげらげら笑っていました。おまけに「わたしはお前さんの隠しているのがおかしい」と返事をしました。,"Before I talk about the future, I have to explain a little about kappa. Kappa are animals that are still questionable as to whether they actually exist. But that's no doubt as long as I lived between them. Then, when it comes to what kind of animal it is, not only does it have short hair on its head, but it also has water on its limbs, which is not significantly different from what is mentioned in ""Shuihu"". The height will roughly exceed or not exceed one meter. According to doctor Chuck, he weighs between 20 and 30 pounds-rarely, some fifty-odd pounds of kappa. Then there is an oval plate in the middle of the head, which also seems to add more hardness with age. In fact, the plate of an old bag is completely different from the plate of a young zipper. But the most mysterious thing is the color of the kappa's skin. Kappa do not have a constant skin color like we humans do. Everything turns to the same color as its surroundings-for example, when you're in the grass, it turns green like grass, and when you're on a rock, it turns gray like rock. This is, of course, not only for kappa, but also for chameleons. Or the kappa may have something close to the chameleon on the skin tissue. When I discovered this fact, I remembered the folklore record that the western kappa were green and the northeastern kappa were red. Not only that, when I was chasing the bag, I suddenly remembered where I went and disappeared. Moreover, kappa seem to have thicker fat under the skin, and despite the relatively low temperature of this underground country (average around 50 degrees Fahrenheit), they do not know what a kimono is [# "" ""I don't know"" is in ""I know""] in the basement. Of course, every kappa will have a gold eye, a box of cigarettes, and a gold case. However, since kappa have bags on their bellies like kangaruu, there is no particular inconvenience when storing them. The only thing that was funny to me was that it didn't even cover the waist. I once asked the bag why this habit. Then, [# ""to"" is ""sliding"" in the bottom] The bag was sacked and laughed forever. In addition, he replied, ""It's strange that you're hiding.""","Before proceeding further, I think I must give you some idea of the animals called kappas. People still doubt whether they exist at all. But they do. There can be no doubt about it since I myself actually lived among them. They have a short-haired head and webbed hands and feet, like those pictures in the Suiko Kōryaku (A Study of the Water-tiger) and other books. Their average height is about three feet four inches. Their weight ranges from twenty to thirty pounds, according to Doctor Chack, though he says that there are some extraordinarily big ones who weigh more than fifty. The top of their heads is concave, forming an oval, dish-like hollow, and this dish seems to grow harder with years. For instance, old Bag's dish was quite different to the touch from young Chack's. But what is most remarkable about kappas is that unlike human beings they change color according to their surroundings. For instance, when they are in the grass they are just as green as the grass, and when they are on a rock they are just as grey as the rock. I think they have something in their skin tissue that chameleons have in theirs, for chameleons, you know, have the power of changing color. The discovery of this strange fact reminded me of a book of folklore which says that the kappas of western Japan are green and those of north-eastern districts red. It also brought back to my mind how Bag had disappeared in that foggy valley when I had tried to catch him. It seems that kappas have a very rich deposit of fat beneath their skin. They never clothe themselves in spite of the comparatively low temperature—about fifty degrees F. — of their underground country. Of course they wear spectacles, and carry cigarette cases and pocket-books and other things with them. But they get along very well without clothes or pockets, because, like kangaroos, they have a nice pouch on their bellies. One thing that struck me as being very funny was that they did not even wear a loin-cloth. I once asked Bag why they didn't. He went off into a fit of laughter, and, with his body bent back, cackled and cackled away until he said: ""I should like to know what makes you cover yourself. ""","Before I go any further with my story, I think I ought perhaps to give you a brief description of the Kappa. The Kappa is a creature about whose existence there is still considerable dispute. But surely there can no longer be the slightest room for such doubt now that I have personally lived among them. So, let me lay aside any question about whether or not the Kappa exists and tell you about this animal. I found no conspicuous difference from the Kappa as it appears from the description in a book called An Enquiry into the Water Tiger’, there is the same short hair on the head, the same webbed hands and feet. The average height of a Kappa is just over three feet, and, according to Dr Chak, its average weight varies between twenty and thirty pounds. Dr Chak did also mention that one comes across the occasional well-built Kappa who might weigh up to fifty-odd pounds. The distinctive feature of the Kappa is the ovalshaped saucer to be found on top of its head. As the Kappa’s age increases, this saucer gradually hardens; there: was quite a difference to the touch between the young Chak’s saucer and that of the old man Bag. But I dare say that it is the colouring of the Kappa’s skin that is its most remarkable feature. The Kappa’s skin does not retain a uniform colour as is the case with us humans; it always changes colour so as to blend with that of the environment. If a Kappa is in grass, for example, its skin will change to a green colour, and when it is on a rock its skin will change to a matching grey. This phenomenon is not distinctive to the Kappa; as you Know, of course, it occurs also in the chameleon. It could well be, I suppose, that there is some property in the skin structure of the Kappa which it shares with or is analogous to that of the chameleon. When I discovered this fact, I recalled that I had once seen some folklore record which stated that the Kappa is green in western Japan and red in the area of the north-east. And I was reminded of the time when I was chasing Bag—his sudden and complete disappearance was no doubt linked with this chameleon-like quality in the skin of the Kappa. The Kappa seems to have a fairly thick deposit of fatty tissue beneath his skin; this would account for his never clothing himself even in the comparatively low temperature of this underground kingdom, where the average temperature is about ten degrees Centigrade. The Kappa, as you no doubt expect, wears spectacles, uses a cigarette case and carries a purse or pocket book. Even without clothes, he has no real trouble in disposing such possessions about his person, for he is endowed with a pouch in his belly, rather like a kangaroo’s. The one thing that struck me as really amusing was the fact that the Kappa does not even wear any form of loin covering. On one occasion, I tried asking Bag about this practice. He threw his head back and guffawed so loudly and so long that I thought he’d never be able to stop. His reply—once he’d managed to restrain himself enough to be able to talk—didn’t make matters any better. ‘I get just as much amusement from the way you cover yourself,’ he said."
「プウ・フウ新聞の記者たちはもちろん労働者の味かたです。しかし記者たちを支配するものはクイクイのほかはありますまい。しかもクイクイはこのゲエルの後援を受けずにはいられないのです。」,"""The reporters of the Puu Fu newspaper are, of course, the taste of the workers, but there is nothing else to dominate the reporters other than Kikui, and Kikui cannot help but be sponsored by this Geel.

""","‘The Pou Fou reporters, naturally, are all for the working man, as you’d expect. But, well, you’ll agree that they are influenced and controlled by their boss, Qui Qui— and Qui Qui, of course, couldn’t survive without support from me.’"

河童もまた足の早いことは決して猿などに劣りません。僕は夢中になって追いかける間に何度もその姿を見失おうとしました。のみならず足をすべらして転がったこともたびたびです。が、大きい橡の木が一本、太ぶとと枝を張った下へ来ると、幸いにも放牧の牛が一匹、河童の往く先へ立ちふさがりました。しかもそれは角の太い、目を血走らせた牡牛なのです。河童はこの牡牛を見ると、何か悲鳴をあげながら、ひときわ高い熊笹の中へもんどりを打つように飛び込みました。僕は、――僕も「しめた」と思いましたから、いきなりそのあとへ追いすがりました。するとそこには僕の知らない穴でもあいていたのでしょう。僕は滑らかな河童の背中にやっと指先がさわったと思うと、たちまち深い闇の中へまっさかさまに転げ落ちました。が、我々人間の心はこういう危機一髪の際にも途方もないことを考えるものです。僕は「あっ」と思う拍子にあの上高地の温泉宿のそばに「河童橋」という橋があるのを思い出しました。それから、――それから先のことは覚えていません。僕はただ目の前に稲妻に似たものを感じたぎり、いつの間にか正気を失っていました。,"Kappa are no less fast than monkeys. I was absorbed in chasing and tried to lose sight of it many times. Not only that, I often slipped and rolled. However, when a large tree came under the thick branches, fortunately a grazing cow stood in the way of the kappa. Moreover, it is a bull with thick horns and bloody eyes. When the kappa saw this bull, he screamed and jumped into the exceptionally high bamboo bamboo. I-I thought I'd done it too, so I suddenly wanted to chase after that. Then there must have been a hole I didn't know. When I thought that my fingertips finally touched the smooth back of the kappa, I immediately fell straight into the deep darkness. However, we human minds think that it is tremendous even in such a close call. I remembered that there was a bridge called ""Kappa Bridge"" near the hot spring inn in Kamikochi, which I thought was ""Ah"". Then-I don't remember the future. I just felt something similar to lightning in front of me, and before I knew it, I was insane.","The kappa was a very good runner, by no means slower than a monkey. Many a time, while running after it like one in a delirium, I was on the point of losing sight of it. Many a time I slipped and fell. But when the kappa came to a place where a huge horse-chestnut tree spread its boughs, a fierce-looking ox with powerful horns and blood-shot eyes blocked its way. The kappa gave a strange scream, and jumped head over heels into an unusually tall growth of bamboo-grass. “Now I've got it,"" I said to myself, and—and in no time jumped in after it. But there was a pit or something, I suppose, which I did not see. For hardly had I touched the smooth back of the kappa when I fell head forward into deep darkness. Now even at such a moment of crisis the human mind indulges in the most unimportant thoughts. The moment I was off my feet I thought of the Kappa-bashi, a bridge near the inn at Kamikōchi hot spring. And then—well, I do not remember what happened after that. I only saw something like a flash of lightning before my eyes, and lost all consciousness.","The Kappa had a really nimble pair of legs—he was no less nippy than a monkey. By now, I was almost in a daze as I chased him. Any number of times I seemed to be on the point of losing sight of him. More than once, I missed my footing and tumbled headlong. However, it seemed as though my luck might have turned when the Kappa found his way blocked by a bull, grazing just underneath the thick boughs of a huge horsechestnut tree. The bull sported a powerful pair of horns and there was a savage glare in his bloodshot eyes. The Kappa caught sight of the bull and, with a shriek, somersaulted right into the middle of a clump of particularly tall bamboo grass ‘Got you! Got you at last!’ I shouted as I plunged straight after him into the bamboo grass. But I was not to know that there was some sort of hole just there. I was just getting the tips of my fingers on his glassy, slippery back when I suddenly found myself toppling headlong, deep into a pitch black abyss. Isn’t it strange how, even at a moment of such extreme crisis, our human mind indulges in the most preposterous thoughts? One moment, my mind was taken up with the danger I’d got myself into; the next, I found myself remembering that there is a bridge called Kappa bridge just by the hot-spring inn where I’d stayed at Kamikōchi. Then ... I’m afraid I can’t remember anything of what happened afterwards. All I know is that I felt something like a flash of lightning pass in front of my eyes; that’s the last thing I can recall and it must have been soon after that that I lost consciousness."

僕はだんだん河童の使う日常の言葉を覚えてきました。従って河童の風俗や習慣ものみこめるようになってきました。その中でも一番不思議だったのは河童は我々人間の真面目に思うことをおかしがる、同時に我々人間のおかしがることを真面目に思う――こういうとんちんかんな習慣です。たとえば我々人間は正義とか人道とかいうことを真面目に思う、しかし河童はそんなことを聞くと、腹をかかえて笑い出すのです。つまり彼らの滑稽という観念は我々の滑稽という観念と全然標準を異にしているのでしょう。僕はある時医者のチャックと産児制限の話をしていました。するとチャックは大口をあいて、鼻目金の落ちるほど笑い出しました。僕はもちろん腹が立ちましたから、何がおかしいかと詰問しました。なんでもチャックの返答はだいたいこうだったように覚えています。もっとも多少細かいところは間違っているかもしれません。なにしろまだそのころは僕も河童の使う言葉をすっかり理解していなかったのですから。,"I gradually learned the everyday words used by kappa. Therefore, the customs and customs of kappa have come to be swallowed. The most mysterious of all is that kappa are crazy about what we humans are serious about, and at the same time we are serious about what we humans are doing-this is a strange habit. For example, we humans take justice and humanity seriously, but when a kappa hears such a thing, he gets angry and starts laughing. In other words, their idea of humor is completely different from our idea of humor. At one point I was talking to doctor Chuck about birth control. Then Chuck screamed and laughed as much as his nose fell. Of course I was angry, so I asked what was wrong. I remember Chuck's reply was almost like this. The slightest details may be wrong. After all, at that time, I didn't fully understand the words used by kappa.","Little by little I learned the everyday language of kappas, as well as their manners and customs. What puzzled me most was their topsy-turvy way of making fun of what we take seriously, and vice versa. Take for example "" justice "" and "" humanity. "" They are very serious matters to us. But if you mention these things before kappas, they are sure to shake their sides with laughter. Perhaps it is because their idea of what is funny is entirely different from ours. I was once talking with Doctor Chack about birth control, when suddenly he burst out laughing, his mouth wide open, shaking himself so violently that he nearly dropped his pince-nez. I was naturally offended, and questioned harshly what made him laugh. Chack's answer was something like this—I am not quite sure about the details, because at that time I was not very familiar with the kappa language—but the gist of what he said was something like this:","I gradually came to be able to follow everyday Kappanese. This meant that I was able to understand something of their customs and practices. The most puzzling of all was the confusing Kappa way of getting everything upside down: where we humans take a thing seriously, the Kappa will tend to be amused; and, similarly, what we humans find amusing the Kappa will take in deadly earnest. A few instances might make my meaning clearer. You will agree that righteousness and humanity, for example, are treated in deadly earnest by us humans; but when he hears these words, any Kappa will burst into the most raucous laugh. It seems as if their sense of humour is based on canons quite different from ours. I was once discussing birth control with Dr Chak. In the middle of the conversation, he suddenly opened his mouth wide and burst into violent laughter, fit to shake his pince-nez from his nose. As you would expect, this angered me and I was a bit short with him when I asked him what he found so funny. As I remember it, the gist of Ghak’s answer was something like this—though I may well have got some of the details slightly wrong, because at the time I had still not thoroughly mastered Kappanese."

チャックは一日に二三度は必ず僕を診察にきました。また三日に一度ぐらいは僕の最初に見かけた河童、――バッグという漁夫も尋ねてきました。河童は我々人間が河童のことを知っているよりもはるかに人間のことを知っています。それは我々人間が河童を捕獲することよりもずっと河童が人間を捕獲することが多いためでしょう。捕獲というのは当たらないまでも、我々人間は僕の前にもたびたび河童の国へ来ているのです。のみならず一生河童の国に住んでいたものも多かったのです。なぜと言ってごらんなさい。僕らはただ河童ではない、人間であるという特権のために働かずに食っていられるのです。現にバッグの話によれば、ある若い道路工夫などはやはり偶然この国へ来た後、雌の河童を妻にめとり、死ぬまで住んでいたということです。もっともそのまた雌の河童はこの国第一の美人だった上、夫の道路工夫をごまかすのにも妙をきわめていたということです。,"Chuck always came to see me a couple of times a day. Also, about once every three days, I asked a fisherman named Bag, the first kappa I saw. Kappa know much more about humans than we humans know about kappa. That is probably because kappa capture humans much more often than we humans capture them. We humans often come to the country of kappa before me, even if it is not a capture. Not only that, many of them lived in the country of Kappa for the rest of their lives. Look at why. We can eat without working because of the privilege of being human, not just kappa. In fact, according to Bag, a young road maker happened to come to this country and then took a female kappa as his wife and lived until his death. However, the female kappa was the most beautiful woman in the country, and she was also very strange to cheat her husband's road ideas.","Chack came to see me two or three times every day. And Bag the fisher-kappa—I mean that kappa I had met in that foggy valley —he also called on me at least once in three days. Kappas know much more about human beings than we know about them. Perhaps it is because they capture us more often than we capture them, though, strictly speaking, I am not sure that they exactly capture us. Anyway, quite a number of people had visited the land of kappas before me, and many of them had stayed there till the end of their lives. For in that country we enjoy the privilege of living without working, simply because we are not kappas but human beings. Bag once told me of a young navvy who had come by chance upon the land and married a she-kappa and lived with her until he breathed his last. The she-kappa, Bag said, was not only the prettiest in that country, but was remarkably clever at deceiving her husband.","Chak came to examine me two or three times a day without fail. And another visitor, who used to come in every three days or so, was the Kappa I’d encountered up in the world of human beings; this one’s name was Bag and he was a fisherman. The average Kappa knows far more about us humans than we do about him. This may have something to do with the fact that the Kappas manage to lay hands on far more human beings than we do Kappas. I’m not so sure that ‘lay hands on’ is quite the proper term; but, be that as it may, there had been any number of human beings who found themselves in Kappaland long before it became my turn, and not a few of these had ended up spending the rest of their lives there. One of the main attractions, obviously, consists in the fact that we humans can manage to live quite a good life, without lifting a finger to do any work, purely by virtue of the special circumstance of our being human beings and not Kappas. Apropos of this, Bag did once tell me the story of a young labourer (he had been working on the roads) who found himself in Kappaland. He had married a she-Kappa who, for one thing, was just about the prettiest you could ever hope to see and, for another, was highly successful in pulling the wool over his eyes."
ゲエルは驚いて立ち上がりました。僕も立ち上がったのはもちろんです。が、給仕は落ち着き払って次の言葉をつけ加えました。,"Geel stood up in amazement. Of course I also stood up. However, the waiter calmed down and added the following words.","Gael jumped up from his seat, and so did I, when the boy added calmly:","Gael leapt up, dumbfounded. And, of course, I too jumped to my feet. However, the steward, in a tone of complete composure, carried on:"
"ある生暖かい日の暮れです。僕はこの部屋のテエブルを中に漁夫のバッグと向かい合っていました。するとバッグはどう思ったか、急に黙ってしまった上、大きい目をいっそう大きくしてじっと僕を見つめました。僕はもちろん妙に思いましたから、「Quax,Bag,quoquel,quan?」と言いました。これは日本語に翻訳すれば、「おい、バッグ、どうしたんだ」ということです。が、バッグは返事をしません。のみならずいきなり立ち上がると、べろりと舌を出したなり、ちょうど蛙の跳ねるように飛びかかる気色さえ示しました。僕はいよいよ無気味になり、そっと椅子から立ち上がると、一足飛びに戸口へ飛び出そうとしました。ちょうどそこへ顔を出したのは幸いにも医者のチャックです。","It's a warm nightfall. I was facing the fisherman's bag inside the table in this room. Then I suddenly shut up what I thought of the bag, and stared at me with my big eyes bigger. Of course I thought it strange, so I said ""Quax, Bag, quoquel, quan?"". Translated into Japanese, this means ""Hey, bag, what's wrong?"" But the bag doesn't reply. Not only that, when he suddenly stood up, he sticked out his tongue and even showed the feeling of jumping just like a frog bouncing. I was finally eerie, and when I gently got up from my chair, I jumped out and tried to jump out into the doorway. Fortunately, it was the doctor Chuck who just came out there.","But my best friend during the first two weeks or so was Bag the fisher-kappa. One late afternoon—I remember the air was moist and warmish—we were talking in my drawing-room with a table between us, when suddenly he fell into silence, and, with his large eyes wide open, began staring at me. I did not see what he meant, so I asked in the kappa language:""Quax, Bag, quo quel quan?"" (I say, Bag, what's the matter?) Bag said nothing, but kept staring at me. Then he jumped to his feet, stuck out his tongue, and showed signs of springing upon me like a frog. I was frightened and rose stealthily from my seat and was just about to dash out of the room when, to my great joy, Doctor Chack came in.","§ It was a warm, muggy evening. I was in my sittingroom with Bag the fisher Kappa at the other side of the table. We’d been chatting away happily and then, for some unaccountable reason, Bag suddenly went silent and began to stare hard at me, his big eyes distended so that they appeared even bigger than usual. It all seemed pretty odd to me and, in an attempt to get to the bottom of it, I tried speaking to Bag in Kappanese. ‘Quax, Bag, quo quel quan?’ (In translation, this would go something like, ‘Come on, Bag! Whatever’s the matter?’) But I got no reply. Instead, Bag leapt violently to his feet and stood over me, his tongue lolling limply from his mouth. He looked for all the world as if he were steadying himself for a frog-leap that would land him right on top of me. By this time, I was feeling very uneasy and suspicious. I managed to ease myself up from my chair stealthily enough not to disturb him and was on the point of making a headlong dash for the door just as Dr Chak showed his face round the self-same door. He couldn’t have chosen a more welcome moment."

トックは昂然と言い放ちました。こういうトックは芸術の上にも独特な考えを持っています。トックの信ずるところによれば、芸術は何ものの支配をも受けない、芸術のための芸術である、従って芸術家たるものは何よりも先に善悪を絶した超人でなければならぬというのです。もっともこれは必ずしもトック一匹の意見ではありません。トックの仲間の詩人たちはたいてい同意見を持っているようです。現に僕はトックといっしょにたびたび超人俱楽部クラブへ遊びにゆきました。超人俱楽部に集まってくるのは詩人、小説家、戯曲家、批評家、画家、音楽家、彫刻家、芸術上の素人等です。しかしいずれも超人です。彼らは電燈の明るいサロンにいつも快活に話し合っていました。のみならず時には得々と彼らの超人ぶりを示し合っていました。たとえばある彫刻家などは大きい鬼羊歯の鉢植えの間に年の若い河童をつかまえながら、しきりに男色をもてあそんでいました。またある雌の小説家などはテエブルの上に立ち上がったなり、アブサントを六十本飲んで見せました。もっともこれは六十本目にテエブルの下へ転げ落ちるが早いか、たちまち往生してしまいましたが。,"Tok was stunned. These tocks also have a unique idea in terms of art. Tok believes that art is uncontrolled, art for art's sake, and therefore an artist must be a superhuman who has lost good and evil before anything else. However, this is not necessarily the opinion of a single Tok. Tok's fellow poets usually seem to have the same opinion. In fact, I often went to the superhuman club club with Tok. Poets, novelists, dramaists, critics, painters, musicians, sculptors, artistic amateurs, etc. gather in the superhuman music club. However, both are superhuman. They were always talking lively in the bright salon of the lamps. Not only that, but sometimes they were showing off their superhumanity. For example, a sculptor was constantly playing with a male color while catching a young kappa during a potted plant of ferns. Another female novelist stood up on the table and drank 60 absinthes. However, this was the 60th one that fell under the table, but it was too early to get stuck.","""No, I'm a superman,"" declared Tock defiantly, though, literally, he said he was a super-kappa. He had his own view of art. He maintained that art should be unfettered by any rules of life, that it should be art for art's sake, and that therefore an artist should first of all be a super-kappa and be above good and evil. But Tock was not the only kappa that held this view. All his poet friends seemed to be more or less of the same opinion. Tack often took me to the Super-kappas' Club, where I found all sorts of super-kappas—poets, novelists, dramatists, critics, painters, musicians, sculptors, and amateur lovers of art. They were always talking merrily in the salon under bright electric lamps. Or sometimes they were proudly showing one another how superkappas should act. For instance, I once saw a sculptor among the tall ferns planted in pots, holding a young kappa in his arms and playing eagerly with his. ... At another time a she-kappa, who was a novelist, stood on the table before us and drank sixty bottles of absinthe at a stretch, though, unfortunately, when she had done with the sixtieth bottle she fell down to the floor and expired on the spot.","There was a triumphant tone about this reply. As you would expect, Tok holds pretty original ideas about the arts. His view is that the arts should not be controlled by anvthing or anyone: it’s a case of art for art’s sake, and so the artist’s primary concern should be to make himself into a super-Kappa transcending all notions of good and evil. Of course, Tok wasn’t by any means the only Kappa to hold such views about art and the artist; I remember that they were to be found quite generally among the group of poets he associated with, and among the members of the super-Kappa club where he entertained me now and again. Nearly all the members of the super-Kappa club appeared to be connected in some way with the arts—there were poets, novelists, playwrights, critics, painters, composers, sculptors, as well as a fair number of amateur dabblers. But, whatever their branch of art or their status in it, they were every one of them superKappas. If you were looking for a stimulating discussion, your best bet was always the brightly-lit salon in the super-Kappa club. It would be hard to find better entertainment than, as often happened, the members proudly displaying to each other their own particular brand of super-Kappahood. Let me give you the odd example: I remember once watching one of the sculptors (I think it was) standing in the middle of a group of potted giant ferns; he had his arms round a young Kappa, and was engaged intently in the finest public act of consenting homosexual adults you could ever hope to see. And on another occasion a woman Kappa novelist was standing on a table showing us how to drink bottles of absinth. She got as far as sixty—but I expect I don’t need to tell you that after she’d downed the sixtieth bottle, she slumped from the table to the floor. In a second or two she was dead."

巡査は右手の棒をあげ、（この国の巡査は剣の代わりに水松の棒を持っているのです。）「おい、君」とその河童へ声をかけました。僕はあるいはその河童は逃げ出しはしないかと思っていました。が、存外落ち着き払って巡査の前へ歩み寄りました。のみならず腕を組んだまま、いかにも傲然と僕の顔や巡査の顔をじろじろ見ているのです。しかし巡査は怒りもせず、腹の袋から手帳を出してさっそく尋問にとりかかりました。,"The policeman raised the stick on his right hand (the policeman in this country has a stick of water pine instead of a sword) and called out to ""Hey, you"" and his kappa.

ある割合に寒い午後です。僕は「阿呆の言葉」を読み飽きましたから、哲学者のマッグを尋ねに出かけました。するとある寂しい町の角に蚊のようにやせた河童が一匹、ぼんやり壁によりかかっていました。しかもそれは紛れもない、いつか僕の万年筆を盗んでいった河童なのです。僕はしめたと思いましたから、ちょうどそこへ通りかかった、たくましい巡査を呼びとめました。,"It's a relatively cold afternoon.

But only that philosopher, Mag, is vaguely thinking about something while looking at Tok's corpse. I tapped Mag on the shoulder and asked, ""What are you thinking?""","""Hey there, don't peep in!” shouted Judge Pep, and he pushed the curious kappas out like a police-man and shut the door upon them.

I tapped him on the shoulder and asked what he was thinking about.","Pep the judge, acting as policeman now, pushed the crowd of Kappas back from the doorway and closed Tok’s door.
