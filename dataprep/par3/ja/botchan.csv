You can't run away.""","“Say, fellows, we’ve got bastards. Make them drink. Get them loaded. You gents got to stay here.”","‘Look here, gen’lmen! Weasel just pulled these two back in!

ここいらがいいだろうと船頭は船をとめて、錨を卸した。幾尋あるかねと赤シャツが聞くと、六尋ぐらいだと云う。六尋ぐらいじゃ鯛はむずかしいなと、赤シャツは糸を海へなげ込んだ。大将鯛を釣る気と見える、豪胆なものだ。野だは、なに教頭のお手際じゃかかりますよ。それになぎですからとお世辞を云いながら、これも糸を繰り出して投げ入れる。何だか先に錘のような鉛がぶら下がってるだけだ。浮がない。浮がなくって釣をするのは寒暖計なしで熱度をはかるようなものだ。おれには到底出来ないと見ていると、さあ君もやりたまえ糸はありますかと聞く。糸はあまるほどあるが、浮がありませんと云ったら、浮がなくっちゃ釣が出来ないのは素人ですよ。こうしてね、糸が水底へついた時分に、船縁の所で人指しゆびで呼吸をはかるんです、食うとすぐ手に答える。――そらきた、と先生急に糸をたぐり始めるから、何かかかったと思ったら何にもかからない、餌がなくなってたばかりだ。いい気味だ。教頭、残念な事をしましたね、今のはたしかに大ものに違いなかったんですが、どうも教頭のお手際でさえ逃げられちゃ、今日は油断ができませんよ。しかし逃げられても何ですね。浮と睨めくらをしている連中よりはましですね。ちょうど歯どめがなくっちゃ自転車へ乗れないのと同程度ですからねと野だは妙な事ばかり喋舌る。よっぽど撲りつけてやろうかと思った。おれだって人間だ、教頭ひとりで借り切った海じゃあるまいし。広い所だ。鰹の一匹ぐらい義理にだって、かかってくれるだろうと、どぼんと錘と糸を抛り込んでいい加減に指の先であやつっていた。,"The boatman stopped the ship and wholesaled the anchor, thinking that it would be nice to be here. When I asked how many red shirts there were, he said it was about Rokuhiro. The red shirt squeezed the thread into the sea, saying that it would be difficult for the sea bream to be around Rokuhiro. It's a bold thing that looks like you're fishing for a sea bream. In the field, what is the vice-principal's skill? While complimenting it because it's just like that, it also pulls out the thread and throws it in. Somehow, lead like a weight is just hanging first. There is no float. Fishing without floating is like measuring heat without a thermometer. When I see that I can't do it at all, I ask if you have any thread to do. There are a lot of threads, but if you say that there is no floating, it is an amateur who can not fish without floating. In this way, when the thread reaches the bottom of the water, I breathe by pointing at the edge of the ship. ――The teacher suddenly started to squeeze the thread, so when I thought something had happened, nothing happened, and I just ran out of food. It feels good. The vice-principal did something unfortunate, it must have been a big one now, but I can't let my guard down today because even the vice-principal's dexterity escaped. But what if you can escape? It's better than those who are floating and glaring. Noda talks about strange things because it's about the same as not being able to ride a bicycle without teething. I thought I'd try to beat him. I'm a human being, it's not the sea that the vice-principal rented out by himself. It's a large place. I thought that even one bonito in law would take it, so I squeezed a weight and a thread and squeezed it with my fingertips.","“This will be about the best place.” So saying the boatman stopped rowing the boat and dropped an anchor. “How deep is it?” asked Red Shirt, and was told about six fathoms. “Hard to fish sea-breams in six fathoms,” said Red Shirt as he dropped a line into the water. The old sport appeared to expect to fetch some bream. Bravo! “It wouldn’t be hard for you. Besides it is calm,” Clown fawningly remarked, and he too dropped a line. The line had only a tiny bit of lead that looked like a weight. It had no float. To fish without a float seemed as nearly reasonable as to measure the heat without a thermometer, which was something impossible for me. So I looked on. They then told me to start, and asked me if I had any line. I told them I had more than I could use, but that I had no float. “To say that one is unable to fish without a float shows that he is a novice,” piped up Clown. “See? When the line touches the bottom, you just manage it with your finger on the edge. If a fish bites, you could tell in a minute. There it goes,” and Red Shirt hastily started taking out the line. I wondered what he had got, but I saw no fish, only the bait was gone. Ha, good for you, Gov’nur! “Wasn’t it too bad! I’m sure it was a big one. If you miss that way, with your ability, we would have to keep a sharper watch to-day. But, say, even if we miss the fish, it’s far better than staring at a float, isn’t it? Just like saying he can’t ride a bike without a brake.” Clown has been getting rather gay, and I was almost tempted to swat him. I’m just as good as they are. The sea isn’t leased by Red Shirt, and there might be one obliging bonito which might get caught by my line. I dropped my line then, and toyed it with my finger carelessly.","The boatman said that we were at a good spot and threw the anchor overboard. When Redshirt asked how deep the water was, he said about six fathoms. Redshirt said that it was pretty hard to fathom how we were going to find any bream at that depth and flung his line into the water. So the big boss was after a bream, was he? Very intrepid! But the Hanger said that Redshirt, being the expert fisherman that he was, was sure to land one, especially with the water being so calm, and accompanied this bit of flattery with a cast of his own line. To my surprise, the lines only had lead sinkers on the end. No floats. Trying to fish without a float is kind of like trying to take somebody’s temperature without a thermometer. I couldn’t see any point to it, but Redshirt said ‘Come on now, try it yourself. Have you got a line?’ I told him that I had plenty of line but no float, to which he replied that floats were only for amateurs. When your line hits bottom, he explained, you just hold it down against the gunwale with your index finger and feel for a tug, like this – look, there’s one now! Redshirt started reeling in his line right away, as if he was sure he had caught something, but all he came up with was a bare hook with the bait gone. Served him right! ‘Ah, what a shame!’ said the Hanger. ‘It certainly must have been a big one. Now, if it was able to get away from an expert like you, sir, we’ll all really have to be on our toes today. But even so, it still beats sitting there just staring at your float like the beginners do, doesn’t it? Why, they’re no better than those people who can’t ride a bicycle without brakes.’ Listening to him spout this nonsense, I was just itching to treat him to a good beating. I mean, I’m a man, too, and it wasn’t as if the Assistant Principal had rented out the entire sea for his own personal use – it was big enough for all of us! Thinking that a nice juicy bonito really ought to come along and at least take a nibble at my line, if only as a matter of principle, I threw it into the water with a satisfying splash and wiggled it lazily with my fingertip."
一番槍はお手柄だがゴルキじゃ、と野だがまた生意気を云うと、ゴルキと云うと露西亜ロシアの文学者みたような名だねと赤シャツが洒落た。そうですね、まるで露西亜の文学者ですねと野だはすぐ賛成しやがる。ゴルキが露西亜の文学者で、丸木が芝の写真師で、米のなる木が命の親だろう。一体この赤シャツはわるい癖だ。誰を捕まえても片仮名の唐人の名を並べたがる。人にはそれぞれ専門があったものだ。おれのような数学の教師にゴルキだか車力だか見当がつくものか、少しは遠慮するがいい。云うならフランクリンの自伝だとかプッシング、ツー、ゼ、フロントだとか、おれでも知ってる名を使うがいい。赤シャツは時々帝国文学とかいう真赤な雑誌を学校へ持って来て難有そうに読んでいる。山嵐に聞いてみたら、赤シャツの片仮名はみんなあの雑誌から出るんだそうだ。帝国文学も罪な雑誌だ。,"The first spear is a credit, but it's Gorki, but when I say cheeky again, Gorki is a fashionable name like a Russian literary writer. Well, Noda immediately agrees that he is a Russian literary writer. Gorki is a Russian literary writer, Maruki is a turf photographer, and a rice tree is probably the parent of life. This red shirt is a bad habit. No matter who you catch, you want to list the names of katakana Chinese. Each person had his or her own specialty. A math teacher like me should refrain from guessing whether it's Gorki or car power. You should use a name that I know, such as Franklin's autobiography, Pushing, Two, Ze, Front. Red shirts sometimes bring a bright red magazine called Teikoku Bungaku to school and read it with difficulty. When I asked Yamaarashi, it seems that all the katakana in red shirts come from that magazine. Imperial literature is also a sinful magazine.","“Splendid for the first honor, but that’s goruki,” Clown again made a “fresh” remark. “Goruki sounds like the name of a Russian literator,” said Red Shirt. “Yes, just like a Russian literator,” Clown at once seconded Red Shirt. Gorky for a Russian literator, Maruki a photographer of Shibaku, and komeno-naruki (rice) a life-giver, eh? This Red Shirt has a bad hobby of marshalling before anybody the name of foreigners. Everybody has his specialty. How could a teacher of mathematics like me tell whether it is a Gorky or shariki (rikishaman). Red Shirt should have been a little more considerate. And if he wants to mention such names at all, let him mention “Autobiography of Ben Franklin,” or “Pushing to the Front,” or something we all know. Red Shirt has been seen once in a while bringing a magazine with a red cover entitled Imperial Literature to the school and poring over it with reverence. I heard it from Porcupine that Red Shirt gets his supply of all foreign names from that magazine. Well, I should say!","‘Well, good for you, you’ve scored the first point, but it’s only a goruki,’ said the Hanger, playing the smart aleck again, at which point Redshirt cracked a joke: ‘Goruki? Sounds like he’s hooked a Russian novelist.’ Of course the Hanger had to chime in right away: ‘ Oh yes! Gorky, the Russian novelist. Very good!’ All right, so a goruki is a Russian novelist, Maruki is a photographer ’s studio back in Tokyo, and a door key gets you into your house. Redshirt just loved dropping foreign names, making it sound like he was pronouncing them in some foreign alphabet, no matter who he was talking to. A totally obnoxious habit. Everyone has their own field of knowledge. How was a math teacher like me supposed to know the difference between Gorky and Porky? Better to give it up. If he was going to throw around this foreign stuff at all, he should have stuck with things that even people like me have heard of, like Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography. Sometimes he would bring this magazine with a bright red cover called Imperial Literature to school with him and read it as if it was the greatest thing around. When I asked the Porcupine about it, he told me that that was where he got all those foreign names of his. As far as I was concerned, that magazine was his partner in crime!"

なるほど狸が狸なら、赤シャツも赤シャツだ。生徒があばれるのは、生徒がわるいんじゃない教師が悪るいんだと公言している。気狂が人の頭を撲り付けるのは、なぐられた人がわるいから、気狂がなぐるんだそうだ。難有い仕合せだ。活気にみちて困るなら運動場へ出て相撲でも取るがいい、半ば無意識に床の中へバッタを入れられてたまるものか。この様子じゃ寝頸をかかれても、半ば無意識だって放免するつもりだろう。,"If the raccoon dog is a raccoon dog, the red shirt is also a red shirt. It is professed that the teacher who is not bad for the student is bad for the student to be exposed. It is said that the madness slams a person's head because the struck person is bad. It's a difficult arrangement. If you are in trouble because of the liveliness, you can go out to the playground and take a sumo wrestling. In this situation, even if I get sick, I'm going to release him half unconsciously.","Well, as Badger, so was Red Shirt. He declares the “Rough Necks” among the students is not their fault but the fault of the teachers. A crazy person beats other people because the beaten are wrong. Very grateful, indeed. If the students were so full of life and vigor, shovel them out into the campus and let them wrestle their heads off. Who would have grasshoppers put into his bed unconsciously! If things go on like this, they may stab some one asleep, and get freed as having done the deed unconsciously.","Just as the Badger had been acting like a Badger, Redshirt, I saw, was being Redshirt. Here he was, openly declaring that if the students ran wild it was not they themselves who were to blame, but the teachers. In other words, when a lunatic bashes somebody on the head it’s the person being bashed that’s the guilty party, and that’s why the lunatic is bashing him. Thanks a lot! If the students find themselves suffering from an excess of youthful high spirits, let them go out to the schoolyard and try their hands at sumo. Did they really expect me to put up with them half-unconsciously sticking grasshoppers in my bed? At this rate, if you’re murdered in your sleep Redshirt would probably be ready to claim that that was also done half-unconsciously and let the perpetrators go free."

食いたい団子の食えないのは情ない。しかし自分の許嫁が他人に心を移したのは、なお情ないだろう。うらなり君の事を思うと、団子は愚か、三日ぐらい断食しても不平はこぼせない訳だ。本当に人間ほどあてにならないものはない。あの顔を見ると、どうしたって、そんな不人情な事をしそうには思えないんだが――うつくしい人が不人情で、冬瓜の水膨れのような古賀さんが善良な君子なのだから、油断が出来ない。淡泊だと思った山嵐は生徒を煽動したと云うし。生徒を煽動したのかと思うと、生徒の処分を校長に逼るし。厭味で練りかためたような赤シャツが存外親切で、おれに余所ながら注意をしてくれるかと思うと、マドンナを胡魔化したり、胡魔化したのかと思うと、古賀の方が破談にならなければ結婚は望まないんだと云うし。いか銀が難癖をつけて、おれを追い出すかと思うと、すぐ野だ公が入れ替ったり――どう考えてもあてにならない。こんな事を清にかいてやったら定めて驚く事だろう。箱根の向うだから化物が寄り合ってるんだと云うかも知れない。,"It's a pity that I can't eat the dumplings I want to eat. However, it would be regrettable that his wife changed his mind to another person. When I think of you, the dumplings are stupid, and even if you fast for about three days, you can't complain. Nothing really is as unreliable as humans. Looking at that face, I don't think I'm going to do such an inhumane thing, but-because a beautiful person is inhumane and Koga-san, who looks like a swelling of a winter melon, is a good prince, I can be alert. not. It is said that Yamaarashi, who thought it was a light night, incites the students. When I think that I have instigated the students, I will dispose of the students to the principal. Koga broke down when I thought that the red shirt, which seemed to be kneaded with a sickness, was surprisingly kind, and I thought that he would pay attention to me, and that Madonna was humiliated or humiliated. If you don't get married, you don't want to get married. When I thought about how silver would make a difficult habit and drive me out, the public would soon be replaced-it wouldn't be reliable at all. It would be surprising to decide if such a thing was done cleanly. It may be said that the objects are close to each other because they are across from Hakone.","To be unable to eat dango one is so fond of eating, is tragic. But to have one’s betrothed change her love to another, would be more tragic. When I think of Hubbard Squash, I believe that I should, not complain if I cannot eat dango or anything else for three days. Really there is nothing so unreliable a creature as man. As far as her face goes, she appears the least likely to commit so stony-hearted an act as this. But the beautiful person is cold-blooded and Koga-san who is swollen like a pumpkin soaked in water, is a gentleman to the core,—that’s where we have to be on the look-out. Porcupine whom I had thought candid was said to have incited the students and he whom then I regarded an agitator, demanded of the principal a summary punishment of the students. The disgustingly snobbish Red Shirt is unexpectedly considerate and warns me in ways more than one, but then he won the Madonna by crooked means. He denies, however, having schemed anything crooked about the Madonna, and says he does not care to marry her unless her engagement with Koga is broken. When Ikagin beat me out of his house, Clown enters and takes my room. Viewed from any angle, man is unreliable. If I write these things to Kiyo, it would surprise her. She would perhaps say that because it is the west side of Hakone that the town had all the freaks and crooks dumped in together.[7] [Footnote 7: An old saying goes that east of the Hakone pass, there are no apparitions or freaks.]","Not being able to eat some dumplings when you wanted to felt pathetic. But to have your fiancée switch her affections to another man was truly pathetic. Never mind the dumplings, I realized – compared to the Squash, I wouldn’t have had any grounds for complaint even if I had to go without any food at all for three days. Really, there’s nothing in the world as undependable as human beings. Just looking at her face, you would never have thought that such a gorgeous woman would be capable of doing anything so cruel, but she was; while Mr Koga – puffy, pale, last-squash-on the-vine face and all – was a perfect gentleman. You can never let your guard down. You think that the Porcupine is a simple, honest fellow, and then you hear that he’s been stirring up the students … Then when you think he was the one who was stirring them up, he urges the Principal to give them the punishment they deserve … You think that Redshirt is a walking mass of obnoxiousness, and then all of a sudden he goes out of his way to be nice to you and warn you about the danger you’re in … and you find out that he’s been playing that game of his with the Madonna. And then he claims that he has no designs on the woman unless her engagement to Mr Koga falls through. Ikagin makes up excuses to get rid of me, and then takes in the Hanger right away … However you look at things, you just don’t know what to believe. If I wrote to Kiyo about all this I’m sure she’d be flabbergasted. Maybe she’d say that it just goes to show that anyplace further away than Hakone must be swarming with monsters."

It seems that he has returned to nothing. Mr. Red Shirt and Mr. Hotta have a reputation for having a bad deal since then. ""","“So Hotta-san a friend of Koga-san, felt sorry for him and went to the head teacher to remonstrate with him. But Red Shirt-san said that he had no intention of taking away anybody who is promised to another. He may get married if the engagement is broken, he said, but at present he was only being acquainted with the Toyamas and he saw nothing wrong in his visiting the Toyamas. Hotta-san couldn’t do anything and returned. Since then they say Red Shirt-san and Hotta-san are on bad terms.”","‘And then Mr Koga’s friend Mr Hotta felt sorry for him, so he went to have a talk with the Assistant Principal. According to what I’ve heard, Mr Redshirt told him that he had no intention of snatching away a woman who was already engaged to somebody else. If that engagement were ever broken off he might seek the lady for himself, but for the present he was simply spending time with the Tōyama family and he didn’t see how Mr Koga could possibly have any objection to that. Since there was nothing more that Mr Hotta could say at that point, he just went home. They say that the two of them have been on bad terms ever since, na moshi.’"

I don't know the old man who growls like that every night without getting tired of it. I'm not a fuss about utai. I didn't want it because I wanted to raise my monthly salary, but I thought it was a waste to leave money that I couldn't get in, so I knew it was okay, but I forced myself to transfer what I didn't want to transfer. Is it possible to do something inhumane to bounce in front of a man's monthly salary? I wonder what it means to drop down to Nobeoka even though the person in question says it's okay as it was. Even the Tadashi Gonjo settled down in the vicinity of Hakata. Matagorou Kawai is also stopped at Sagara. Anyway, I have to go to the red shirt and refuse it.","The old lady withdrew in silence. The old man is heard singing “utai” in the off-key voice. “Utai,” I think, is a stunt which purposely makes a whole show a hard nut to crack by giving to it difficult tunes, whereas one could better understand it by reading it. I cannot fathom what is in the mind of the old man who groans over it every night untired. But I’m not in a position to be fooling with “utai.” Red Shirt said he would have my salary raised, and though I did not care much about it, I accepted it because there was no use of leaving the money lying around. But I cannot, for the love of Mike, be so inconsiderate as to skin the salary of a fellow teacher who is being transferred against his will. What in thunder do they mean by sending him away so far as Nobeoka when the fellow prefers to remain in his old position? Even Dazai-no-Gonnosutsu did not have to go farther than about Hakata; even Matagoro Kawai [11] stopped at Sagara. I shall not feel satisfied unless I see Red Shirt and tell him I refuse the raise.","She left the room without another word. Her husband was chanting a passage from some Noh play in a relaxed, mellow voice.

How he managed to practice that stuff every night without getting thoroughly sick of it was a mystery to me. Anyhow I had much bigger things to worry about. They’d told me that they were going to give me a raise. It wasn’t as if I’d especially wanted one, but I figured that it would have been a waste to let them leave the money sitting around doing nothing, so I’d accepted. But would I be mean enough to take a cut out of the salary of somebody who had been forced to accept a transfer when he really didn’t want to go? What the hell did they think they were doing banishing the man to the wilds of Nobeoka when he had told them that all he wanted was to stay right here? Even when a famous exile like Sugawara no Michizane was sent to Kyushu, he was allowed to settle in a place no more remote than the outskirts of Fukuoka. And hadn’t Kawai Matagoro, a notorious murderer, also ended up in a fairly civilized part of the island like Sagara?

If I say that I don't like the kind of retreat that I don't like, the owner laughs and laughs, but no one likes it from the beginning, but once I get on this road, it's hard to get out. If you don't, you'll be pouring tea by yourself and drinking it with a strange touch. Actually, I asked him to buy the last night's tea, but I don't like this bitter and strong tea. I feel like answering my stomach when I drink a drink. When I asked him to buy something that wasn't too bitter, he squeezed it again and drank it. He thinks it's human tea and drinks it silently. After my husband withdrew, I read tomorrow and fell asleep immediately.","On reaching my room, the boss of the house came to me saying, “Let me serve you tea.” I expected he was going to treat me to some good tea since he said “Let me serve you,” but he simply made himself at home and drank my own tea. Judging by this, I thought he might be practising “Let me serve you” during my absence. The boss said that he was fond of antique drawings and curios and finally had decided to start in that business. “You look like one quite taken about art. Suppose you begin patronizing my business just for fun as er—connoisseur of art?” It was the least expected kind of solicitation. Two years ago, I went to the Imperial Hotel (Tokyo) on an errand, and I was taken for a locksmith. When I went to see the Daibutsu at Kamakura, haying wrapped up myself from head to toe with a blanket, a rikisha man addressed me as “Gov’ner.” I have been mistaken on many occasions for as many things, but none so far has counted on me as a probable connoisseur of art. One should know better by my appearance. Any one who aspires to be a patron of art is usually pictured,—you may see in any drawing,—with either a hood on his head, or carrying a tanzaku[3] in his hand. The fellow who calls me a connoisseur of art and pretends to mean it, may be surely as crooked as a dog’s hind legs. I told him I did not like such art-stuff, which is usually favored by retired people. He laughed, and remarking that that nobody liked it at first, but once in it, will find it so fascinating that he will hardly get over it, served tea for himself and drank it in a grotesque manner. I may say that I had asked him the night before to buy some tea for me, but I did not like such a bitter, heavy kind. One swallow seemed to act right on my stomach. I told him to buy a kind not so bitter as that, and he answered “All right, Sir,” and drank another cup. The fellow seemed never to know of having enough of anything so long as it was another man’s. After he left the room, I prepared for the morrow and went to bed. [Footnote 3: A tanzaku is a long, narrow strip of stiff paper on which a Japanese poem is written.]","When I got home, the landlord came into my room and asked if I’d like him to make some tea. I thought he meant that he was going to offer me some of his own, but instead he took mine, and helped himself to a cup into the bargain. For all I knew, he may have been inviting himself to enjoy my tea while I was off at school as well. He explained that he had always been interested in antiques, and so eventually he had started to do some dealing in a private way. ‘I sense that you are a gentleman of quite sophisticated tastes. How would you like to start a little collection of your own, just for fun?’ Not on your life! It was true that once a couple of years ago I’d been mistaken for a locksmith at the Imperial Hotel when I had gone there on an errand. Another time, when I was walking around near the Great Statue of the Buddha in Kamakura wearing a blanket over my head, one of the rickshawmen started addressing me as ‘Boss.’ I had been taken for plenty of other things as well over the years, but nobody had ever accused me of being a gentleman of quite sophisticated tastes before! You can usually tell everything you need to know about people from the way they look, or what they’re wearing. I’ve seen what a man of sophisticated tastes is supposed to look like in those old ink paintings : they’re wearing some kind of monk’s cowl, or holding a slip of paper so they’ll always be ready to dash off a poem. Anybody who tried to put me in that category with a straight face would have to be a really suspicious character. I told him that as far as I was concerned collecting antiques was a pastime best left to idle old men, and I had no use for it. He laughed and said no, it’s true that nobody starts out with an interest in it, but once people develop a feel for it they rarely turn back. Meanwhile he poured himself some more of my tea and drank it with a peculiar flourish. I had actually asked him to buy some tea for me the night before, but this was awful stuff, bitter and thick. A single cup was enough to make your stomach feel funny. When I asked him to look for something less bitter next time he said ‘Yes sir,’ and helped himself to yet another serving, tipping the pot and holding it there long enough to make sure that he had squeezed out whatever last drops of flavor were left in the leaves. That’s the kind of guy he was: as long as it was somebody else’s tea, he was going to drink as much of it as he could. After he left, I did a little preparation for the next day’s classes and then went to bed."
「下宿の世話なんかするものあ剣呑だという事ですか」,"""Do you mean that you are a swordsman who takes care of your boarding house?""",“Meaning that one who helps me find a boarding house is dangerous?”,‘Do you mean that business about getting myself into some real trouble with someone who was helping me find a place to live?’
おれは五十人あまりを相手に約一時間ばかり押問答をしていると、ひょっくり狸がやって来た。あとから聞いたら、小使が学校に騒動がありますって、わざわざ知らせに行ったのだそうだ。これしきの事に、校長を呼ぶなんて意気地がなさ過ぎる。それだから中学校の小使なんぞをしてるんだ。,"When I was asking and answering about fifty people for about an hour, a raccoon came. I heard later that the ambassador went all the way to inform him that there was a turmoil in the school. It's too stubborn to call the principal for this. That's why I'm a junior high school ambassador.","For about one hour, I had been talking and back-talking with about fifty students when suddenly Badger put in his appearance. I heard afterward that the janitor ran to Badger for the purpose of reporting to him that there was a trouble in the school. What a weak-knee of the janitor to fetch the principal for so trifling an affair as this! No wonder he cannot see better times than a janitor.","After I had spent the better part of an hour going back and forth with all fifty-something of them and getting nowhere, the Badger suddenly turned up. As I found out later, the custodian had gone to his house to report that there was some kind of commotion going on at school. The fact that he would go to the bother of calling on the Principal over an incident like this just shows what a faint-hearted type he was. No wonder he ended up as a school custodian!"
出た事は出たが、どこへ行くというあてもない。車屋が、どちらへ参りますと云うから、だまって尾いて来い、今にわかる、と云って、すたすたやって来た。面倒だから山城屋へ行こうかとも考えたが、また出なければならないから、つまり手数だ。こうして歩いてるうちには下宿とか、何とか看板のあるうちを目付け出すだろう。そうしたら、そこが天意に叶ったわが宿と云う事にしよう。とぐるぐる、閑静で住みよさそうな所をあるいているうち、とうとう鍛冶屋町へ出てしまった。ここは士族屋敷で下宿屋などのある町ではないから、もっと賑やかな方へ引き返そうかとも思ったが、ふといい事を考え付いた。おれが敬愛するうらなり君はこの町内に住んでいる。うらなり君は土地の人で先祖代々の屋敷を控えているくらいだから、この辺の事情には通じているに相違ない。あの人を尋ねて聞いたら、よさそうな下宿を教えてくれるかも知れない。幸一度挨拶に来て勝手は知ってるから、捜がしてあるく面倒はない。ここだろうと、いい加減に見当をつけて、ご免ご免と二返ばかり云うと、奥から五十ぐらいな年寄が古風な紙燭をつけて、出て来た。おれは若い女も嫌いではないが、年寄を見ると何だかなつかしい心持ちがする。大方清がすきだから、その魂が方々のお婆さんに乗り移るんだろう。これは大方うらなり君のおっ母さんだろう。切り下げの品格のある婦人だが、よくうらなり君に似ている。まあお上がりと云うところを、ちょっとお目にかかりたいからと、主人を玄関まで呼び出して実はこれこれだが君どこか心当りはありませんかと尋ねてみた。うらなり先生それはさぞお困りでございましょう、としばらく考えていたが、この裏町に萩野と云って老人夫婦ぎりで暮らしているものがある、いつぞや座敷を明けておいても無駄だから、たしかな人があるなら貸してもいいから周旋してくれと頼んだ事がある。今でも貸すかどうか分らんが、まあいっしょに行って聞いてみましょうと、親切に連れて行ってくれた。,"I've seen it, but I don't know where to go. The car shop said which way he was going, so he came after me, saying that he could understand now. I thought about going to Yamashiroya because it was troublesome, but I had to go out again, that is, it was a hassle. While walking in this way, you will find a boarding house or something with a signboard. Then, let's call it my inn where it came true. While I was in a quiet and comfortable place to live, I finally went to the blacksmith town. This is a samurai residence and not a town with a boarding house, so I thought I'd go back to a more lively place, but suddenly I came up with a good idea. Uranari, whom I admire, lives in this town. Uranari-kun is a local person and has an ancestral mansion, so he must be familiar with the situation around here. If you ask that person and ask him, he may tell you a good boarding house. Fortunately, I came to say hello once and knew what I was doing, so I'm looking for it and it's not a hassle. Even here, I had a good idea, and when I said that I was exempt, about fifty old people came out with old-fashioned paper candles from the back. I don't hate young women either, but when I look at the elderly, I feel somehow nostalgic. I like Kiyoshi Ogata, so that soul will be transferred to the grandmothers of the people. This is probably your mother. A woman with devaluation dignity, but often resembles you. Well, I called my husband to the front door and asked if he had any idea about this, because I wanted to see him for a while. Uranari-sensei I've been thinking for a while that it would be a problem, but there is a thing called Hagino who lives alone in this back town, and it's useless to leave the tatami room anytime. I once asked him to go around because I could lend him if there was a person. I still don't know if I'll lend it, but he kindly took me to ask me if I could go there.","I got out of the house all right, but had no place to go. The rikishaman asked me where I was going. I told him to follow me with his mouth shut, then he shall see and I kept on walking. I thought of going to Yamashiro-ya to avoid the trouble of hunting up a new boarding house, but as I had no prospect of being able to stay there long, I would have to renew the hunt sooner or later, so I gave up the idea. If I continued walking this way, I thought I might strike a house with the sign of “boarders taken” or something similar, and I would consider the first house with the sign the one provided for me by Heaven. I kept on going round and round through the quiet, decent part of the town when I found myself at Kajimachi. This used to be former samurai quarters where one had the least chance of finding any boarding house, and I was going to retreat to a more lively part of the town when a good idea occurred to me. Hubbard Squash whom I respected lived in this part of the town. He is a native of the town, and has lived in the house inherited from his great grandfather. He must be, I thought, well informed about nearly everything in this town. If I call on him for his help, he will perhaps find me a good boarding house. Fortunately, I called at his house once before, and there was no trouble in finding it out. I knocked at the door of a house, which I knew must be his, and a woman about fifty years old with an old fashioned paper-lantern in hand, appeared at the door. I do not despise young women, but when I see an aged woman, I feel much more solicitous. This is probably because I am so fond of Kiyo. This aged lady, who looked well-refined, was certainly mother of Hubbard Squash whom she resembled. She invited me inside, but I asked her to call him out for me. When he came I told him all the circumstances, and asked him if he knew any who would take me for a boarder. Hubbard Squash thought for a moment in a sympathetic mood, then said there was an old couple called Hagino, living in the rear of the street, who had asked him sometime ago to get some boarders for them as there are only two in the house and they had some vacant rooms. Hubbard Squash was kind enough to go along with me and find out if the rooms were vacant.","Leaving was easy enough, but I had no idea where to go. When the man asked where he should take my things, I told him to just keep quiet and follow me and he’d find out soon enough, and then set off at a lively pace. I thought the easiest thing would be to go back to Yamashiro-ya, but since I’d only have to leave again anyway, it would actually end up being more of a bother. If I just kept walking around I was bound to come across a boardinghouse or a place with a Room for Rent sign sooner or later. That, I figured, would be the place that fate had ordained for me. As I made my way through streets that looked like they’d be nice, quiet places to live, I ended up in Kajiyachō. This was where families of the samurai class had their mansions, not the part of town to find something like a boardinghouse in. Just as I was thinking I ought to head back toward a busier district, I suddenly had a good idea: my esteemed colleague the Pale Squash lived in this neighborhood. His family had occupied one of these mansions for generations, so he would be sure to know the area well. If I dropped in at his place and asked him about it, he might be able to come up with a promising suggestion. Luckily I’d already paid a call on him once before, so I had a pretty clear idea of how to get to his house, and I didn’t have to spend a lot of time wandering around trying to find it. When I came to the house that I thought was probably the right one, I went up to the entrance and called out ‘Excuse me!’ twice. An elderly lady who looked to be about fifty appeared from inside holding an old-fashioned paper-wick lamp. Young women are fine with me, too, but somehow seeing an older one always gives me a good feeling. I guess it’s because I like Kiyo so much, and it just seems to me that the same feeling must apply to old ladies everywhere. She was a dignified-looking lady with an old-fashioned widow’s short haircut tied neatly in the back; since her features closely resembled the Squash’s I assumed she was his mother. She invited me in politely, but I explained that I was just there to ask him a quick question about something and had her call him down to the doorway. When I told him about my situation and asked if he could think of any possibilities, he replied that this was indeed a predicament and stood there looking lost in thought for a while. Then he recalled that there was an elderly couple named Hagino who had a house on a street behind his, and they’d once told him that they had an empty parlor room and if he could recommend a reliable boarder they would be willing to rent it out since there was no point in letting it just sit there unoccupied. He wasn’t sure if it was still available, he said, but we could go and have a look, and he kindly took me there."

港屋の二階に灯が一つついて、汽車の笛がヒューと鳴るとき、おれの乗っていた舟は磯の砂へざぐりと、舳をつき込んで動かなくなった。お早うお帰りと、かみさんが、浜に立って赤シャツに挨拶する。おれは船端から、やっと掛声をして磯へ飛び下りた。,"When a light was lit on the second floor of the Minatoya and the whistle of the train rang, the boat I was on got stuck in the sand of the rocky shore with a bow. On your way home, Kami stands on the beach and greets her red shirt.

I stood on the edge of the boat; and whoop! I jumped out to the beach.","the Hanger replied, not missing the chance to play up to Redshirt yet again. Just as a lamp was being lit on the second floor of the harbor inn and a train whistle came pealing through the air, the prow of our boat slid up onto the sand and came to a stop.

停車場はすぐ知れた。切符も訳なく買った。乗り込んでみるとマッチ箱のような汽車だ。ごろごろと五分ばかり動いたと思ったら、もう降りなければならない。道理で切符が安いと思った。たった三銭である。それから車を傭って、中学校へ来たら、もう放課後で誰も居ない。宿直はちょっと用達に出たと小使が教えた。随分気楽な宿直がいるものだ。校長でも尋ねようかと思ったが、草臥れたから、車に乗って宿屋へ連れて行けと車夫に云い付けた。車夫は威勢よく山城屋と云ううちへ横付けにした。山城屋とは質屋の勘太郎の屋号と同じだからちょっと面白く思った。,"The stop was immediately known. I bought a ticket for no reason. When I got in, it was a train like a matchbox. If you think you've moved around for five minutes, you have to get off. I thought it was reasonable that the ticket was cheap. It's only three coins. Then, when I got in my car and came to junior high school, no one was there after school. The ambassador told me that the night shift was a little out of the ordinary. There is a very comfortable night shift. I thought I'd ask the principal, but I was lying down, so I told the car owner to get in the car and take me to the inn. The car owner rushed to the side of Yamashiroya. Yamashiroya is the same name as Kantaro, a pawn shop, so I thought it was a little interesting.","The station was easily found, and a ticket bought without any fuss. The coach I got in was about as dignified as a match-box. The train rambled on for about five minutes, and then I had to get off. No wonder the fare was cheap; it cost only three sen. I then hired a rikisha and arrived at the middle school, but school was already over and nobody was there. The teacher on night-duty was out just for a while, said the janitor,—the night-watch was taking life easy , sure. I thought of visiting the principal, but being tired, ordered the rikishaman to take me to a hotel. He did this with much alacrity and led me to a hotel called Yamashiro-ya. I felt it rather amusing to find the name Yamashiro-ya the same as that of Kantaro’s house.","I found the train station soon enough and bought myself a ticket. When I got on the train, it looked as dinky as a matchbox. It had hardly started to get rolling when it was already time to get off; the whole ride couldn’t have taken more than five minutes. No wonder the ticket was so cheap, I thought – only three sen! I got into a rickshaw and set off for the middle school, but when I got there, classes were already over for the day and there was no one around. The custodian explained that the teacher on night duty had just gone out on an errand. For somebody who was supposed to be on night duty, he seemed to have a pretty casual attitude. I thought about paying a call on the Principal, but by this point I was already feeling so worn out that I just got back in the rickshaw and told the driver to take me to an inn. He dashed me off to a place called Yamashiro-ya – the same name as the pawnbroker’s shop that Kantarō’s family ran, which was kind of funny."
七,Seven,CHAPTER VII.,7
と逃げもせぬ、おれを壁際へ圧し付けた。諸方を見廻してみると、膳の上に満足な肴の乗っているのは一つもない。自分の分を奇麗に食い尽して、五六間先へ遠征に出た奴もいる。校長はいつ帰ったか姿が見えない。,"I couldn't run away, and I pressed me against the wall. Looking around, there is no satisfying side dish on the table. Some have gone on an expedition 56 minutes ahead, eating up their own. The principal cannot see when he returned.","And they pushed me who never attempted to escape against the wall. Surveying the scene, I found there was no dish in which any edibles were left. Some one had eaten all his share, and gone on a foraging expedition. The principal was not there,—I did not know when he left.","They pinned me flat against the wall, even though I wasn’t even trying to run out. I looked around the room and saw that there wasn’t a single tray left with anything to eat on it. Some people, after they had finished off everything on their own tray, had set off on raiding parties and were cleaning out others a dozen yards away. Somewhere along the line, the Principal had disappeared."
「バッタた何ぞな」と真先の一人がいった。やに落ち付いていやがる。この学校じゃ校長ばかりじゃない、生徒まで曲りくねった言葉を使うんだろう。,"""What a grasshopper,"" said one of the first. It calms down a little. At this school, not only the principal, but even the students will use winding words.","What are they?” said one in front, in a tone disgustingly quiet. In this school, not only the principal, but the students as well, were addicted to using twisted-round expressions.",said the one standing at the front of the group. This was way too casual. It wasn’t just the Principal who tried to beat around the bush at this school; the students had the same way of talking.
「そうかも知れないね。驚いた」,"""Maybe so. I was surprised.""",“That may be. I’m surprised.”,"‘Ahh, that could be. My goodness!’"
兄とおれはかように分れたが、困ったのは清の行く先である。兄は無論連れて行ける身分でなし、清も兄の尻にくっ付いて九州下りまで出掛ける気は毛頭なし、と云ってこの時のおれは四畳半の安下宿に籠って、それすらもいざとなれば直ちに引き払わねばならぬ始末だ。どうする事も出来ん。清に聞いてみた。どこかへ奉公でもする気かねと云ったらあなたがおうちを持って、奥さまをお貰いになるまでは、仕方がないから、甥の厄介になりましょうとようやく決心した返事をした。この甥は裁判所の書記でまず今日には差支えなく暮していたから、今までも清に来るなら来いと二三度勧めたのだが、清はたとい下女奉公はしても年来住み馴れた家の方がいいと云って応じなかった。しかし今の場合知らぬ屋敷へ奉公易えをして入らぬ気兼を仕直すより、甥の厄介になる方がましだと思ったのだろう。それにしても早くうちを持ての、妻を貰えの、来て世話をするのと云う。親身の甥よりも他人のおれの方が好きなのだろう。,"My brother and I were separated, but the trouble was where Kiyo was going. Of course, my brother wasn't in a position to take me, and Kiyoshi had no intention of going down to Kyushu by sticking to his ass. It's a cleanup that must be withdrawn immediately. I can't do anything about it. I asked Qing. If I was willing to serve somewhere, I couldn't help until you took my house and got my wife, so I finally decided to make my nephew troublesome. This nephew was the secretary of the court and lived without any problems today, so I have recommended him to come to Qing a couple of times. I didn't say it was good. However, in this case, he probably thought that it would be better for his nephew to be troublesome than to rehabilitate the unfamiliar mansion by making a service to an unknown mansion. Even so, it is said that he will come and take care of him as soon as he has a wife and a wife. I think I like other people more than my nephew.","Thus I parted from my brother, but the disposal of Kiyo was a difficult proposition. My brother was, of course, unable to take her along, nor was there any danger of her following him so far away as Kyushu, while I was in a small room of a boarding house, and might have to clear out anytime at that. There was no way out, so I asked her if she intended to work somewhere else. Finally she answered me definitely that she would go to her nephew’s and wait until I started my own house and get married. This nephew was a clerk in the Court of Justice, and being fairly well off, had invited Kiyo before more than once to come and live with him, but Kiyo preferred to stay with us, even as a servant, since she had become well used to our family. But now I think she thought it better to go over to her nephew than to start a new life as servant in a strange house. Be that as it may, she advised me to have my own household soon, or get married, so she would come and help me in housekeeping. I believe she liked me more than she did her own kin.","So my brother and I went our separate ways, but there was still the problem of where Kiyo should go. My brother was hardly in a position to take her with him, of course, and besides she didn’t have the slightest interest in trailing along after him all the way out to Kyushu. But I was holed up in my nine-foot-square room in a cheap boardinghouse at that point, and for all I knew I might even be forced to get out at any time. There was nothing that either of us could do for her. Finally I put the question to Kiyo herself. When I asked if she was planning to go into service in some other house, she said that until I had a home of my own and got married, she had no choice but to move in with her nephew and that was what she’d decided to do. This nephew was a clerk in the courts, reasonably well off, and he had already invited Kiyo to come and live with him if she was so minded on a couple of occasions, but she’d always turned down the offer, saying that she preferred staying on in a place that she’d been used to for years, even as a maid. This time, though, she must have decided that moving in with him would be better than starting over as a servant in some unfamiliar household where she’d have to worry all the time about fitting in.

向うの方で漢学のお爺さんが歯のない口を歪めて、そりゃ聞えません伝兵衛さん、お前とわたしのその中は……とまでは無事に済したが、それから？と芸者に聞いている。爺さんなんて物覚えのわるいものだ。一人が博物を捕まえて近頃こないなのが、でけましたぜ、弾いてみまほうか。よう聞いて、いなはれや――花月巻、白いリボンのハイカラ頭、乗るは自転車、弾くはヴァイオリン、半可の英語でぺらぺらと、Iamgladtoseeyouと唄うと、博物はなるほど面白い、英語入りだねと感心している。,"On the other side, the old man of Chinese studies distorted his toothless mouth, and I couldn't hear it. Denbei-san, you and I were all right, but then? I'm asking the geisha. An old man is hard to remember. One person caught the natural history and didn't come these days, so let's play it. When I sing Iamgladtoseeyou with Kagetsu Arashi, a high-collar head with a white ribbon, a bicycle to ride, a violin to play, and Iamgladtoseeyou in half-speaking English, the natural history is really interesting, it's in English. I am impressed.","On other side of the room, the old man of Confucius, twisting round his toothless mouth, had finished as far as “…… dear Dembei-san” and is asking a geisha who sat in front of him to couch him for the rest. Old people seem to need polishing up their memorizing system. One geisha is talking to the teacher of natural history: “Here’s the latest. I’ll sing it. Just listen. ‘ Margaret, the high-collared head with a white ribbon; she rides on a bike, plays a violin, and talks in broken English,—I am glad to see you.’” Natural history appears impressed, and says; “That’s an interesting piece.","On the other side of the room the old Chinese classics teacher was contorting his toothless mouth as he squeezed out a passage from one of the puppet plays: ‘How can you say that, Denbei? The bond between you and me … ’ Having managed to get through that part safely, he turned to a geisha and asked ‘Er, then what?’ Old men do have a way of losing their memories. Another geisha had gotten hold of the science teacher: ‘There’s a brand new song that’s going around,’ she purred, ‘and it goes like this. Let me play it for you, listen carefully now!’ She proceeded to sing something about a girl who does her hair in the latest fashion, all tied up with a pretty white bow, rides around town on a bicycle, plays on a violin, and chatters away in broken English, telling everyone ‘I am glad to see you.’ ‘Yes, that’s a good one,’ said the science teacher, obviously impressed ‘– it’s even got some English in it, doesn’t it?’ Then it was the Porcupine’s turn."

When people attack, I don't know, it's Russian Asian literature, haiku I'm going to turn people around because he's a brother of the new poetry. Such a sissy isn't a man.

You ought to see the jacknape skipping out of the room when the geisha came into it the other night,—I don’t like his trying to deceive us, but if one were to point it out for him, he would deny it or say it was the Russian literature or that the haiku is a half-brother of the new poetry, and expect to hush it up by twaddling soft nonsense. A weak-knee like him is not a man. I believe he lived the life of a court-maid in former life. Perhaps his daddy might have been a kagema at Yushima in old days.” “What is a kagema?”","no – all you have to do is step into a noodle shop or a dumpling shop and he has the Principal warn you about setting a bad example … ’ ‘Yeah,’ I told him, ‘I guess that hiring a geisha is a spiritual amusement as far as that joker’s concerned, but tempura and dumplings are materialistic ones. If it’s so spiritual, why doesn’t he flaunt it a little more? How could he have pulled a stunt like that – getting up and running away as soon as he sees that geisha of his coming in the room? He thinks he can keep pulling the wool over our eyes forever. That’s what really gets me. And then when somebody attacks him he just says “I don’t know what you’re talking about,’ or tries to bamboozle you by spouting some nonsense about Russian literature, or haiku being the big brother of modern poetry. He’s not even a man at all, he’s just a big sissy. He must be a reincarnation of one of those old-time palace lady’s maids that specialized in all kinds of intrigue. Or maybe his old man was one of those boys that plied their trade in the shadows over by the shrine in Yushima … ’ ‘Huh?"
出立の日には朝から来て、いろいろ世話をやいた。来る途中小間物屋で買って来た歯磨と楊子と手拭をズックの革鞄に入れてくれた。そんな物は入らないと云ってもなかなか承知しない。車を並べて停車場へ着いて、プラットフォームの上へ出た時、車へ乗り込んだおれの顔をじっと見て「もうお別れになるかも知れません。随分ご機嫌よう」と小さな声で云った。目に涙が一杯たまっている。おれは泣かなかった。しかしもう少しで泣くところであった。汽車がよっぽど動き出してから、もう大丈夫だろうと思って、窓から首を出して、振り向いたら、やっぱり立っていた。何だか大変小さく見えた。,"On the day of departure, I came from the morning and took care of various things. On the way, he put the toothpaste, Yangko and towel that I bought at the booth shop in the leather bag of Zuck. It's hard to know that such a thing won't fit. When I got to the stop with the cars lined up and got out on the platform, I stared at my face when I got into the car and said in a small voice, ""I may say goodbye. I'm in a good mood."" My eyes are full of tears. I didn't cry. However, I was about to cry. After the train started to move, I thought it would be okay, so I pulled my head out of the window and turned around, and after all I was standing. Somehow it looked very small.","This give-and-take conversation proved too much for me. On the day of my departure, she came to my room early in the morning and helped me to pack up. She put into my carpet-bag tooth powder, tooth-brush and towels which she said she had bought at a dry goods store on her way. I protested that I did not want them, but she was insistent.[A] We rode in rikishas to the station. Coming up the platform, she gazed at me from outside the car, and said in a low voice; “This may be our last good-by. Take care of yourself.” Her eyes were full of tears. I did not cry, but was almost going to. After the train had run some distance, thinking it would be all right now, I poked my head out of the window and looked back. She was still there. She looked very small.","The morning I left she came to my room and helped out with all kinds of things. She gave me a canvas bag with a toothbrush, tooth powder, and a towel she’d bought in a shop on the way over. I told her I didn’t need them, but she wouldn’t take no for an answer. We rode to the station in two rickshaws, side by side. After I had boarded the train she stood there on the platform, gazing at me through the window. ‘We may not see each other again. Please take very good care of yourself,’ she said in a tiny voice. Her eyes were filled with tears. Mine weren’t, but it was all I could do to keep myself from crying. Once the train started to pick up speed I thought I would be all right and I stuck my head out the window and looked back. She was still standing there. Somehow she looked awfully small."

野だが大人しくなったなと気が付いて、ふり向いて見ると、いつしか艫の方で船頭と釣の話をしている。野だが居ないんでよっぽど話しよくなった。,"It was a field, but when I realized that I had grown up, I turned around and found that the stern was talking to the captain about fishing. It's a field, but I'm not there, so I'm talking better.","I noticed Clown had become quiet, and turning round, saw him at the stern talking with the boatman. Without Clown, I found our conversation running smoothly.",Suddenly I noticed that the Hanger had been keeping very quiet during all this. I looked around and saw that he had moved back to the stern of the boat and was talking fishing with the boatman. It was much easier for me to talk to Redshirt without him around.
中学と師範とはどこの県下でも犬と猿のように仲がわるいそうだ。なぜだかわからないが、まるで気風が合わない。何かあると喧嘩をする。大方狭い田舎で退屈だから、暇潰しにやる仕事なんだろう。おれは喧嘩は好きな方だから、衝突と聞いて、面白半分に馳け出して行った。すると前の方にいる連中は、しきりに何だ地方税の癖に、引き込めと、怒鳴ってる。後ろからは押せ押せと大きな声を出す。おれは邪魔になる生徒の間をくぐり抜けて、曲がり角へもう少しで出ようとした時に、前へ！と云う高く鋭い号令が聞えたと思ったら師範学校の方は粛粛として行進を始めた。先を争った衝突は、折合がついたには相違ないが、つまり中学校が一歩を譲ったのである。資格から云うと師範学校の方が上だそうだ。,"It seems that junior high school and instructors get along with each other like dogs and monkeys in any prefecture. I don't know why, but I don't feel like it. I quarrel when something happens. It's usually boring in a small countryside, so it's probably a job to kill time. I like fighting, so when I heard that it was a collision, I went out for fun. Then, the people in the front are constantly yelling at the habit of local tax, asking them to withdraw. From behind, he makes a loud voice. When I passed through the disturbing students and was about to reach the corner, I moved forward! When I thought that I could hear the high and sharp command, the normal school started the march quietly. The clashes that fought ahead must have come to an end, but in other words, the junior high school gave up one step. In terms of qualifications, normal school seems to be superior.","The middle school and the normal, I understood, are as much friendly as dogs and monkeys. It is not explained why but their temper was hopelessly crossed, and each would try to knock the chip off the shoulder of the other on all occasions. I presume they quarrel so much because life gets monotonous in this backwoods town. I am fond of fighting, and hearing of the clash, darted forward to make the most of the fun. Those foremost in the line are jeering, “Get out of the way, you country tax!”[12] while those in the rear are hollowing “Push them out!” I passed through the students, and was nearing the corner, when I heard a sharp command of “Forward!” and the line of the normal school began marching on. The clash which had resulted from contending for the right of way was settled, but it was settled by the middle school giving way to the normal. From the point of school-standing the normal is said to rank above the middle. [Footnote 12: The normal school in the province maintains the students mostly on the advance-expense system, supported by the country tax.]","According to what I was told, the students in middle schools and normal schools in any provincial town fight like cats and dogs. I don’t know why this is, but it does seem as if they rub each other the wrong way, and any little thing can touch off a fight. Probably they get so bored living in these little country towns that they just do it to help pass the time. Now, I like a good fight myself, so when I heard that a brawl had broken out I ran up to see what was going on. I could hear the kids at the front shouting ‘Out of our way, you local-tax-school losers!’ Shouts of ‘Push ’em back! Push ’em back!’ came welling up from behind. Just as I was getting close to the intersection, slipping past the knots of students that were blocking my way, the order ‘Forward march!’ was issued in a strong, sharp voice, and the normal school students calmly began moving forward. The question of who would go first, which had been the point of contention in the melee, had obviously been settled, and the middle school had given way. The normal school, I was told, qualified as the higher-ranking institution."
ところへお座敷はこちら？と芸者が三四人はいって来た。おれも少し驚ろいたが、壁際へ圧し付けられているんだから、じっとしてただ見ていた。すると今まで床柱へもたれて例の琥珀のパイプを自慢そうに啣えていた、赤シャツが急に起って、座敷を出にかかった。向うからはいって来た芸者の一人が、行き違いながら、笑って挨拶をした。その一人は一番若くて一番奇麗な奴だ。遠くで聞えなかったが、おや今晩はぐらい云ったらしい。赤シャツは知らん顔をして出て行ったぎり、顔を出さなかった。大方校長のあとを追懸けて帰ったんだろう。,"Where is the tatami room? Said 34 geisha. I was a little surprised, but I was just looking at it because it was pressed against the wall. Then, the red shirt, which had been leaning against the floor pillar and proudly holding the amber pipe, suddenly got up and went out of the tatami room. One of the geisha who came in from the other side laughed and greeted while crossing over. One of them is the youngest and most beautiful. I couldn't hear it in the distance, but it seems that he said it tonight. The red shirt didn't show up as long as he went out with an unknown face. I think he went home after the principal.","At that time, preceded by a coquetish voice, three or four geishas entered the room. I was a bit surprised, but having been pushed against the wall, I had to look on quietly. At the instant, Red Shirt who had been leaning against a pillar with the same old amber pipe stuck into his mouth with some pride, suddenly got up and started to leave the room. One of the geishas who was advancing toward him smiled and courtesied at him as she passed by him. The geisha was the youngest and prettiest of the bunch. They were some distance away from me and I could not see very well, but it seemed that she might have said “Good evening.” Red Shirt brushed past as if unconscious, and never showed again. Probably he followed the principal.","At this point in the proceedings, a group of three or four geisha stuck their heads in the room and inquired, ‘Is this the place?’ This was a bit of a surprise, but since I was still pinned against the wall all I could do was stand there and observe the scene. Redshirt, who had been leaning against one of the pillars by the alcove with a self-satisfied look as he puffed on that amber pipe of his, sprang to his feet and made a sudden move for the door, but when he crossed paths with the geisha as they came into the room, one of them, the youngest and prettiest-looking, stopped and greeted him with a smile. They were too far away for me to hear what she was saying, but it seemed to be nothing more than ‘Oh, my! Good evening!’ Redshirt just ignored her and sailed on out of the room; that was the last we saw of him for the night. I guess he must have followed the Principal’s lead and gone home."

おれには山嵐の云う事が何の意味だか分らない。,I don't know what Yamaarashi means.,What Porcupine was trying to get at was all dark to me.,I didn’t have a clue as to what he was talking about.
おれの頭はあまりえらくないのだから、いつもなら、相手がこういう巧妙な弁舌を揮えば、おやそうかな、それじゃ、おれが間違ってたと恐れ入って引きさがるのだけれども、今夜はそうは行かない。ここへ来た最初から赤シャツは何だか虫が好かなかった。途中で親切な女みたような男だと思い返した事はあるが、それが親切でも何でもなさそうなので、反動の結果今じゃよっぽど厭になっている。だから先がどれほどうまく論理的に弁論を逞くしようとも、堂々たる教頭流におれを遣り込めようとも、そんな事は構わない。議論のいい人が善人とはきまらない。遣り込められる方が悪人とは限らない。表向きは赤シャツの方が重々もっともだが、表向きがいくら立派だって、腹の中まで惚れさせる訳には行かない。金や威力や理屈で人間の心が買える者なら、高利貸でも巡査でも大学教授でも一番人に好かれなくてはならない。中学の教頭ぐらいな論法でおれの心がどう動くものか。人間は好き嫌いで働くものだ。論法で働くものじゃない。,"My head isn't very good, so I'm usually afraid if the other person speaks this kind of clever speech, and then I'm afraid I'm wrong, but I'm not going tonight. From the beginning when I came here, I didn't like bugs in my red shirt. On the way, I remembered that he was a kind woman-like man, but it seems that he is kind or nothing, so as a result of the reaction, he is now very disgusted. So it doesn't matter how well or logically the destination is, no matter how well you put me into the imposing vice-principal style. A person with good discussion is not a good person. The one who can be sent in is not always the bad guy. The red shirt is more ostensibly, but no matter how good the ostensibly is, I can't let you fall in love with it. If you can buy the human heart with money, power, and reason, you must be the most liked by usury, police officers, and university professors. How does my heart move with the reasoning of a junior high school vice-principal? Humans work with likes and dislikes. It doesn't work in reason.","My brain is not of the best stuff, and if another fellow flourishes his eloquence like this, I usually think, “Well, perhaps I was wrong,” and consider myself defeated, but not so to-night. From the time I came to this town I felt prejudiced against Red Shirt. Once I had thought of him in a different light, taking him for a fellow kind-hearted and feminished. His kindness, however, began to look like anything but kindness, and as a result, I have been getting sick of him. So no matter how he might glory himself in logical grandiloquence, or how he might attempt to out-talk me in a head-teacher-style, I don’t care a snap. One who shines in argument is not necessarily a good fellow, while the other who is out-talked is not necessarily a bad fellow, either. Red Shirt is very, very reasonable as far as his reasoning goes, but however graceful he may appear, he cannot win my respect. If money, authority or reasoning can command admiration, loansharks, police officers or college professors should be liked best by all. I cannot be moved in the least by the logic by so insignificant a fellow as the head teacher of a middle school. Man works by preference, not by logic.","I can’t boast much about my brainpower, so normally if somebody subjects me to a smoothly polished line of talk like this, I’ll give in and concede that it might very well be true and that I’m the one who’d been in the wrong – but not that night. Ever since I first got to town, there was something about Redshirt that had rubbed me the wrong way. At one point I had changed my mind and decided that he was a kindhearted fellow in a feminine sort of way, but now, when it was becoming clear that there was really nothing kind about him at all, that backlash effect just made me dislike him all the more. So no matter how powerfully he laid out those fine and logical arguments of his, no matter how hard he tried to overwhelm me with his Assistant Principalian grandeur, I didn’t care. Just because somebody can out-argue you, that doesn’t necessarily make them a good person. And the person who gets out-argued isn’t necessarily a bad person, either. To all appearances, what Redshirt had to say made perfect sense, but splendid as it sounded, that still didn’t give it the power to seduce you deep down in your heart. If you could really win people’s hearts over with the power of money, authority, or reasoning, then moneylenders, policemen, and college professors would be more popular than anybody else. There was no way that my heart was going to be swayed by the logic of some middle school Assistant Principal. People operate on their likes and dislikes, not on logic."
妙な奴だ、ほめたと思ったら、あとからすぐ人の失策をあばいている。おれは何の気もなく、前の宿直が出あるいた事を知って、そんな習慣だと思って、つい温泉まで行ってしまったんだが、なるほどそう云われてみると、これはおれが悪るかった。攻撃されても仕方がない。そこでおれはまた起って「私は正に宿直中に温泉に行きました。これは全くわるい。あやまります」と云って着席したら、一同がまた笑い出した。おれが何か云いさえすれば笑う。つまらん奴等だ。貴様等これほど自分のわるい事を公けにわるかったと断言出来るか、出来ないから笑うんだろう。,"He's a weird guy, and if he thinks he's complimented, he'll immediately reveal his missteps. I didn't care about it, and when I learned that there was a night shift in front of me, I thought it was such a habit, so I just went to the hot springs. rice field. It can't be helped if attacked. Then I got up again and said, ""I went to the hot springs right in the middle of the night. This is totally bad. I'm sorry."" When I sat down, everyone started laughing again. I laugh as long as I say something. It's boring guys. You guys can say that you didn't want to make your bad things public, or you can't, so you'll laugh.","A strange fellow! No sooner had he backed me up than he began talking me down. I knew the other night watch went out during his duty hours, and thought it was a custom, so I went as far out as to the hot springs without considering the situation seriously. But when it was pointed out like this, I realised that I had been wrong. Thereupon I rose again and said; “I really went to the hot springs. It was wrong and I apologize.” Then all again laughed. Whatever I say, they laugh. What a lot of boobs! See if you fellows can make a clean breast of your own fault like this! You fellows laugh because you can’t talk straight.","He was a strange one, all right, this Porcupine: just when you thought he was praising you, he goes and points out your mistakes. Since I had seen how the night duty teacher had gone out for a walk on the night I arrived, I had assumed in all innocence that such things were allowed, and so I had gone off to the hot spring myself. Now that it was put to me this way, though, I could see that I’d been wrong. It was no wonder I was being criticized. With that I stood up and declared, ‘It is indeed true that I went to the hot spring while on night duty. This was completely wrong. I apologize,’ and sat back down , whereupon everybody burst out laughing again. It seemed like they were going to laugh every time I opened my mouth. What a worthless bunch! I’d like to see them try to stand up and openly admit that they had done something wrong – of course they couldn’t, which is probably why they were laughing."
赤シャツはホホホホと笑った。別段おれは笑われるような事を云った覚えはない。今日ただ今に至るまでこれでいいと堅く信じている。考えてみると世間の大部分の人はわるくなる事を奨励しているように思う。わるくならなければ社会に成功はしないものと信じているらしい。たまに正直な純粋な人を見ると、坊っちゃんだの小僧だのと難癖をつけて軽蔑する。それじゃ小学校や中学校で噓をつくな、正直にしろと倫理の先生が教えない方がいい。いっそ思い切って学校で噓をつく法とか、人を信じない術とか、人を乗せる策を教授する方が、世のためにも当人のためにもなるだろう。赤シャツがホホホホと笑ったのは、おれの単純なのを笑ったのだ。単純や真率が笑われる世の中じゃ仕様がない。清はこんな時に決して笑った事はない。大いに感心して聞いたもんだ。清の方が赤シャツよりよっぽど上等だ。,"The red shirt laughed hohohoho. I don't remember saying anything that made me laugh. I firmly believe that this is all right today. When you think about it, most people in the world seem to encourage you to get sick. It seems that he believes that society will not succeed unless it gets worse. Occasionally, when I see an honest and pure person, I despise him as a boy or a kid. Then don't lie in elementary school or junior high school, honestly, ethics teachers shouldn't teach. It would be better for the world and for the person to teach how to lie at school, how to disbelieve people, and how to carry people. The red shirt laughed hohohoho because I laughed at my simple things. There is no specification in a world where simplicity and truth are laughed at. Qing never laughed at such a time. I was very impressed and heard. Qing is much better than a red shirt.","Red Shirt laughed. I did not remember having said anything provocative of laughter. Up to this very minute, I have been firm in my conviction that I’m right. When I come to consider the situation, it appears that a majority of people are encouraging others to become bad. They seem to believe that one must do wrong in order to succeed. If they happen to see some one honest and pure, they sneer at him as “Master Darling” or “kiddy.” What’s the use then of the instructors of ethics at grammar schools or middle schools teaching children not to tell a lie or to be honest. Better rather make a bold departure and teach at schools the gentle art of lying or the trick of distrusting others, or show pupils how to do others. That would be beneficial for the person thus taught and for the public as well. When Red Shirt laughed, he laughed at my simplicity. My word! what chances have the simple-hearted or the pure in a society where they are made objects of contempt! Kiyo would never laugh at such a time; she would listen with profound respect. Kiyo is far superior to Red Shirt.","Redshirt just laughed. I hadn’t noticed that there was anything particularly funny about what I’d said. Right up to that point I’d always firmly believed that this was the way things should be. Now that I thought about it, though, I realized that most people actually encourage you to turn bad. They seem to think that if you don’t, you’ll never get anywhere in the world. And then on those rare occasions when they encounter somebody who’s honest and pure-hearted, they look down on him and say he’s nothing but a kid, a Botchan. If that’s the way it is, it would be better if they didn’t have those ethics classes in elementary school and middle school where the teacher is always telling you to be honest and not to lie. The schools might as well just go ahead and teach you how to tell lies, how to mistrust everybody, and how to take advantage of people. Wouldn’t their students, and the world at large, be better off that way? Redshirt had laughed at me for being simpleminded. If people are going to get laughed at for being simpleminded and sincere, there’s no hope. Kiyo never laughed at me for saying anything like what I said to Redshirt. She would have been deeply impressed by it. Compared to Redshirt, she’s far and away the superior person."

I see a lot of 踴 in Tokyo. Every year at Yawata-sama's festival, food stalls come to the town, so I know everything, even if it's taken into consideration. I didn't want to see Tosa-like idiots, but Yamaarashi recommended it, so I decided to follow him and went out to the gate. When I wondered who came to invite Yamaarashi, he was the younger brother in a red shirt. A strange guy has come.","While Porcupine and I were discussing the plan of subjugating Red Shirt, the old lady appeared at the door, announcing that a student was wanting to see Professor Hotta. The student had gone to his house, but seeing him out, had come here as probable to find him. Porcupine went to the front door himself, and returning to the room after a while, said: “Say, the boy came to invite us to go and see the entertainment of the celebration. He says there is a big bunch of dancers from Kochi to dance something, and it would be a long time before we could see the like of it again. Let’s go.” Porcupine seemed enthusiastic over the prospect of seeing that dance, and induced me to go with him. I have seen many kinds of dance in Tokyo. At the annual festival of the Hachiman Shrine, moving stages come around the district, and I have seen the Shiokukmi and almost any other variety. I was little inclined to see that dance by the sturdy fellows from Tosa province, but as Porcupine was so insistent, I changed my mind and followed him out. I did not know the student who came to invite Porcupine, but found he was the younger brother of Red Shirt. Of all students, what a strange choice for a messenger!","While the Porcupine and I were working out the details of the scheme, the landlady appeared at the door. ‘ Mr Hotta,’ she announced, ‘one of the boys from the school is here and he’d like to talk to you, na moshi. He says that he went to your home but since you were out he thought you might be here and came over to see, na moshi.’ She knelt politely in the doorway, awaiting the Porcupine’s reply. ‘ All right,’ he said, and went out to the front entrance. When he came back he reported that the student had come to invite him to go along to the entertainment portion of the victory celebration. After hearing that there was going to be a troupe of dancers from Kōchi doing some kind of special dance that you hardly ever get a chance to see, he was all for going and urged me to go too. I had seen plenty of dances in Tokyo; there was a big festival every year at the local shrine with people dancing on floats that were pulled around the neighborhood, so I knew about the Salt Gatherers’ Dance and all the rest. I had no interest in seeing a bunch of hicks from Kōchi making fools of themselves, but since the Porcupine had made a point of inviting me I figured that I might as well go anyway. The boy who had come to invite him, it turned out, was none other than that brother of Redshirt’s. Kind of odd that it should be him, of all people!"
「野だがつけたんですかい」,"""Did you attach it though it was a field?""",“Was it the work of Clown?”,‘You mean the Hang—’
学校は昨日車で乗りつけたから、大概の見当は分っている。四つ角を二三度曲がったらすぐ門の前へ出た。門から玄関までは御影石で敷きつめてある。きのうこの敷石の上を車でがらがらと通った時は、無暗に仰山な音がするので少し弱った。途中から小倉の制服を着た生徒にたくさん逢ったが、みんなこの門をはいって行く。中にはおれより背が高くって強そうなのが居る。あんな奴を教えるのかと思ったら何だか気味が悪るくなった。名刺を出したら校長室へ通した。校長は薄髯のある、色の黒い、目の大きな狸のような男である。やにもったいぶっていた。まあ精出して勉強してくれと云って、恭しく大きな印の捺った、辞令を渡した。この辞令は東京へ帰るとき丸めて海の中へ抛り込んでしまった。校長は今に職員に紹介してやるから、一々その人にこの辞令を見せるんだと云って聞かした。余計な手数だ。そんな面倒な事をするよりこの辞令を三日間職員室へ張り付ける方がましだ。,"I got in the school yesterday, so I have a good idea. After turning the four corners a couple of times, I immediately went out to the front of the gate. The area from the gate to the entrance is covered with granite. When I drove through the paving stones of yesterday, I was a little weakened because there was a dark and humming sound. I met a lot of students in Kokura uniforms on the way, but they all went through this gate. Some of them are taller and stronger than me. When I thought about teaching such a guy, it became creepy. After issuing the business card, I passed it to the principal's office. The principal is a thin, dark-colored, big-eyed raccoon-like man. It was a mess. Well, I gave him a resignation with a big seal, asking me to study hard. When I returned to Tokyo, this resignation was rolled up and plunged into the sea. The principal told me that he would introduce me to the staff now, so I would show him this resignation one by one. It's an extra effort. It is better to stick this resignation to the staff room for three days than to do such a troublesome thing.","I had had vague idea of the direction of the school as I rode to it the previous day, so turning two or three corners, I came to the front gate. From the gate to the entrance the walk was paved with granite. When I had passed to the entrance in the rikisha, this walk made so outlandishly a loud noise that I had felt coy. On my way to the school, I met a number of the students in uniforms of cotton drill and they all entered this gate. Some of them were taller than I and looked much stronger. When I thought of teaching fellows of this ilk, I was impressed with a queer sort of uneasiness. My card was taken to the principal, to whose room I was ushered at once. With scant mustache, dark-skinned and big-eyed, the principal was a man who looked like a badger. He studiously assumed an air of superiority, and saying he would like to see me do my best, handed the note of appointment, stamped big, in a solemn manner. This note I threw away into the sea on my way back to Tokyo. He said he would introduce me to all my fellow teachers, and I was to show to each one of them the note of appointment. What a bother! It would be far better to stick this note up in the teachers’ room for three days instead of going through such a monkey process.","I had a pretty clear idea of how to get to the school since I had gone there in the rickshaw the day before. Just a couple of turns and I was right at the gate. The pathway from the gate to the school entrance was paved with slabs of granite, and the noise the rickshaw made as it rattled over them had been hard to take. As I was walking along I had seen lots of students in their heavy black uniforms; now they were all streaming through this gate. Some of them were taller than I was, and they looked stronger, too. When it hit me that I was supposed to be teaching kids like them, it made me feel kind of uneasy. I presented my name card and was ushered into the Principal’s office. The Principal had a thin mustache, a dark complexion, and big eyes that made him look like a badger. His manner was horribly stuffy. He urged me to do my best and then solemnly handed me a Certificate of Appointment with a huge seal stamped on it. (Later, when I was on the boat on my way back to Tokyo, I took this certificate, crumpled it up, and pitched it into the sea.) Next, he told me that he was going to present me to the rest of the teaching staff, and that I should display my Certificate personally to each of them. What a lot of bother! It would have been less trouble just to hang it up in the faculty room for a couple of days."

六,Six,CHAPTER VI.,6
それから毎日毎日学校へ出ては規則通り働く、毎日毎日帰って来ると主人がお茶を入れましょうと出てくる。一週間ばかりしたら学校の様子もひと通りは飲み込めたし、宿の夫婦の人物も大概は分った。ほかの教師に聞いてみると辞令を受けて一週間から一ヶ月ぐらいの間は自分の評判がいいだろうか、悪るいだろうか非常に気に掛かるそうであるが、おれは一向そんな感じはなかった。教場で折々しくじるとその時だけはやな心持ちだが三十分ばかり立つと奇麗に消えてしまう。おれは何事によらず長く心配しようと思っても心配が出来ない男だ。教場のしくじりが生徒にどんな影響を与えて、その影響が校長や教頭にどんな反応を呈するかまるで無頓着であった。おれは前に云う通りあまり度胸の据った男ではないのだが、思い切りはすこぶるいい人間である。この学校がいけなければすぐどっかへ行く覚悟でいたから、狸も赤シャツも、ちっとも恐しくはなかった。まして教場の小僧共なんかには愛嬌もお世辞も使う気になれなかった。学校はそれでいいのだが下宿の方はそうはいかなかった。亭主が茶を飲みに来るだけなら我慢もするが、いろいろな者を持ってくる。始めに持って来たのは何でも印材で、十ばかり並べておいて、みんなで三円なら安い物だお買いなさいと云う。田舎巡りのヘボ絵師じゃあるまいし、そんなものは入らないと云ったら、今度は華山とか何とか云う男の花鳥の掛物をもって来た。自分で床の間へかけて、いい出来じゃありませんかと云うから、そうかなと好加減に挨拶をすると、華山には二人ある、一人は何とか華山で、一人は何とか華山ですが、この幅はその何とか華山の方だと、くだらない講釈をしたあとで、どうです、あなたなら十五円にしておきます。お買いなさいと催促をする。金がないと断わると、金なんか、いつでもようございますとなかなか頑固だ。金があつても買わないんだと、その時は追っ払っちまった。その次には鬼瓦ぐらいな大硯を担ぎ込んだ。これは端渓です、端渓ですと二遍も三遍も端渓がるから、面白半分に端渓た何だいと聞いたら、すぐ講釈を始め出した。端渓には上層中層下層とあって、今時のものはみんな上層ですが、これはたしかに中層です、この眼をご覧なさい。眼が三つあるのは珍らしい。潑墨の具合も至極よろしい、試してご覧なさいと、おれの前へ大きな硯を突きつける。いくらだと聞くと、持主が支那から持って帰って来て是非売りたいと云いますから、お安くして三十円にしておきましょうと云う。この男は馬鹿に相違ない。学校の方はどうかこうか無事に勤まりそうだが、こう骨董責に逢ってはとても長く続きそうにない。,"After that, I go to school every day and work according to the rules, and when I come back every day, my husband asks me to make tea. After only a week, I was able to swallow the whole school, and most of the couples at the inn were able to understand. When I asked other teachers, it seems that I am very concerned about whether my reputation is good or bad for about a week to a month after receiving the resignation, but I do not feel that way at all. rice field. If I mess up at the school, I have a bad feeling only at that time, but when I stand for about 30 minutes, it disappears beautifully. I'm a man who can't worry even if he wants to worry for a long time regardless of anything. It was totally indifferent to what kind of influence the mess of the school had on the students and what kind of reaction the influence had on the principal and the vice-principal. As I said before, I'm not a very courageous man, but I'm a very nice person. Neither the raccoon dog nor the red shirt was scary at all because I was prepared to go somewhere soon if this school didn't go. Moreover, I didn't feel like using charm or flattery for the little boys in the school. That's fine for school, but not for boarding houses. If the owner just comes to drink tea, I will put up with it, but I bring various people. The first thing I brought was stamping material, and I told them to line up about ten and buy a cheap one for 3 yen. I'm not a hebo painter who goes around the countryside, and if I said that I couldn't enter such a thing, this time I brought a man's flower and bird hangings such as Hanayama. I went to the alcove and said that it was a good result, so when I greeted him, there were two people in Huashan, one was somehow Huashan and one was somehow Huashan, but this width is somehow Huashan. If you are a person, how about after giving a silly lecture, you will leave it at 15 yen. I urge you to buy it. If I refuse to have money, I'm pretty stubborn if I always have money. When I said that I wouldn't buy it even if I had money, I chased it away. Next, I carried a large inkstone about the size of an onigawara. This is Hatakei, and if it's Hatakei, there are both two and three, so when I asked him what it was for fun, he immediately started to give a lecture. There are upper, middle and lower layers in Hatakei, and all of them are upper layers now, but this is certainly the middle layer, look at this eye. It is unusual to have three eyes. The condition of the inkstone is also very good, and when you try it, you will see a big inkstone in front of me. When asked how much it costs, the owner wants to bring it back from China and sell it, so let's make it cheaper and keep it at 30 yen. This man must be an idiot. It seems that the school will work safely, but it is unlikely that the antiques will last very long.","Everyday thereafter I attended at the school and worked as per regulations. Every day on my return, the boss came to my room with the same old “Let me serve you tea.” In about a week I understood the school in a general way, and had my own idea as to the personality of the boss and his wife. I heard from one of my fellow teachers that the first week to one month after the receipt of the appointment worried them most as to whether they had been favorably received among the students. I never felt anything on that score. Blunders in the class room once in a while caused me chagrin, but in about half an hour everything would clear out of my head. I am a fellow who, by nature, can’t be worrying long about[F] anything even if I try to. I was absolutely indifferent as how my blunders in the class room affected the students, or how much further they affected the principal or the head-teacher. As I mentioned before, I am not a fellow of much audacity to speak of, but I am quick to give up anything when I see its finish. I had resolved to go elsewhere at once if the school did not suit me. In consequence, neither Badger nor Red Shirt wielded any influence over me. And still less did I feel like coaxing or coddling the youngsters in the class room. So far it was O.K. with the school, but not so easy as that at my boarding house. I could have stood it if it had been only the boss coming to my room after my tea. But he would fetch many things to my room. First time he brought in seals.[4] He displayed about ten of them before me and persuaded me to buy them for three yen, which was very cheap, he said. Did he take me for a third rate painter making a round of the country? I told him I did not want them. Next time he brought in a panel picture of flowers and birds, drawn by one Kazan or somebody. He hung it against the wall of the alcove and asked me if it was not well done, and I echoed it looked well done. Then he started lecturing about Kazan, that there are two Kazans, one is Kazan something and the other is Kazan anything, and that this picture was the work of that Kazan something. After this nonsensical lecture, he insisted that he would make it fifteen yen for me to buy it. I declined the offer saying that I was shy of the money. [Footnote 4: Artists have several seals of stone with which to stamp on the picture they draw as a guarantee of their personal work or for identification. The shape and kind of seals are quite a hobby among artists, and sales or exchange are of common occurrence.] “You can pay any time.” He was insistent. I settled him by telling him of my having no intention of purchasing it even if I had the necessary money. Again next time, he yanked in a big writing stone slab about the size of a ridge-tile. “This is a tankei,”[5] he said. As he “tankeied” two or three times, I asked for fun what was a tankei. Right away he commenced lecturing on the subject. “There are the upper, the middle and the lower stratum in tankei,” he said. “Most of tankei slabs to-day are made from the upper stratum,” he continued, “but this one is surely from the middle stratum. Look at this ‘gan.’[6] ’ Tis certainly rare to have three ‘gans’ like this. The ink-cake grates smoothly on it. Try it, sir,”—and he pushed it towards me. I asked him how much, and he answered that on account of its owner having brought it from China and wishing to sell if as soon as possible, he would make it very cheap, that I could have it for thirty yen. I was sure he was a fool. I seemed to be able to get through the school somehow, but I would soon give out if this “curio siege” kept on long. [Footnote 5: Tankei is the name of a place in China where a certain kind of stone suitable for writing purposes was produced.] [Footnote 6: “Gan” may be understood as a kind of natural mark on the stone peculiar to the stone from Tankei.]","The days began to take on a regular pattern: walk to school in the morning, do my job, then come back to my room, where my landlord would soon drop in and ask if I’d like some tea. After a week of this I had a pretty good idea of what was what at school, and also of what kind of people the landlord and his wife were. I had heard from some of the other teachers that for their first week or month on the job they had been very worried about whether they were making a good impression or not, but that wasn’t the way I felt at all. When I made mistakes in class I would feel bad about it, but after thirty minutes or so I had forgotten about it completely. I’m not the kind of guy who can worry about things for long even if I try. I was completely unconcerned with the effect my slip-ups in class might have on the students, or with what the Principal and Assistant Principal might think. Like I said before, my nerves aren’t that steady, but once I take a stand I’ll stick to it. I was ready to pack up and leave at any time if things didn’t work out at this school, so the Badger and Redshirt didn’t faze me at all. And as for those kids in my classes, I was even less tempted to bother with trying to keep on their good side. This approach worked fine at school, but at home things weren’t so simple. If it was just the landlord dropping in to drink up my tea it wouldn’t have been so bad, but he kept bringing various stuff to show me. First it was a bunch of things he called ‘inzai’ or some such name, little bars of stone that you could carve a seal on; he laid out about ten of them and said that he’d give me the lot for the bargain price of three yen. Since I wasn’t some kind of second-rate journeyman artist who needed a bunch of fancy seals to make his work look good I had no use for them, and I told him so; then he unrolled a hanging scroll, a traditional-style bird and flower picture, and told me it was painted by a man named Kazan or something like that. He hung it up in the alcove himself, and asked ‘Don’t you think it’s a splendidly executed piece?’ I guess so, I said, just to say something, at which point he launched into a long-winded explanation of how there were two painters named Kazan – Something-or-other Kazan and another Something-or-other Kazan – and this scroll was by one of the Something-or-other Kazans and not the other. Then he urged me to buy it, adding that just for me he’d bring the price down to fifteen yen. When I told him that I didn’t have that kind of money, he said it was no problem, I could pay whenever it suited me. The man simply wouldn’t take no for an answer. I finally got rid of him by telling him that I wouldn’t buy it even if I did have the money. Another time he lugged in a giant inkstone, as big as a gargoyle roof tile, and announced ‘This is a Tankei stone, a Tankei.’ Before he could repeat himself again, I decided to play dumb and asked him what a Tankei was, but that only got him started on another lecture. The inkstones of Tankei, he explained, were quarried from three different veins of rock: upper, middle, and lower. All of the stones on the market these days were from the upper level, but this one was a genuine middle-level stone. ‘Just look at these eyes,’ he said, pointing to some lighter spots in the blackish stone. ‘You won’t see many specimens with three eyes like this. Feels absolutely superb when you glide your ink stick over it. Please, go ahead, give it a try.’ As he shoved the thing in front of me I asked him what the price was. ‘The owner brought it back with him from China and he says he’s very eager to sell it , so I think we could let you have it for only thirty yen.’ The man must have been out of his mind. At school it was looking like I’d be able to get by somehow or other, but there was no way I could hold up much longer under this trial by antiques."

山嵐はどうしたかと見ると、紋付の一重羽織をずたずたにして、向うの方で鼻を拭いている。鼻柱をなぐられて大分出血したんだそうだ。鼻がふくれ上がって真赤になってすこぶる見苦しい。おれは飛白の袷を着ていたから泥だらけになったけれども、山嵐の羽織ほどな損害はない。しかし頰ぺたがぴりぴりしてたまらない。山嵐は大分血が出ているぜと教えてくれた。,"Looking at what happened to Yamaarashi, he shredded the crested single haori and wiped his nose on the other side. It seems that he was bleeding a lot after being struck by the nose pillar. The nose is swollen and becomes bright red, which is very unsightly. I was covered in mud because I wore a flying white awase, but it wasn't as damaging as the Haori of the mountain storm. However, the cheeks are spicy and irresistible. Yamaarashi told me that he had a lot of blood.","I searched for Porcupine who, I found his overgown torn to shreds, was wiping his nose. He bled considerably, and his nose having swollen was a sight. My clothes were pretty well massed with dirt, but I had not suffered quite as much damage as Porcupine. I felt pain in my cheek and as Porcupine said, it bled some.","Wondering what had happened to the Porcupine, I looked around and saw him up ahead wiping his nose, his kimono jacket with his family crest embroidered on it in shreds. Somebody had punched him in the nose, he told me, and it had been bleeding heavily. Now it was bright red and all swollen, a really horrible sight. I was in a less formal kimono, so even though it was splattered with mud it wasn’t as much of a loss as the Porcupine’s jacket. I had an awful stinging pain in my cheek, though, and according to the Porcupine it was bleeding quite a bit."
庭は十坪ほどの平庭で、これという植木もない。ただ一本の蜜柑があって、塀のそとから、目標になるほど高い。おれはうちへ帰ると、いつでもこの蜜柑を眺める。東京を出た事のないものには蜜柑の生っているところはすこぶる珍しいものだ。あの青い実がだんだん熟してきて、黄色になるんだろうが、定めて奇麗だろう。今でももう半分色の変ったのがある。婆さんに聞いてみると、すこぶる水気の多い、旨い蜜柑だそうだ。今に熟たら、たんと召し上がれと云ったから、毎日少しずつ食ってやろう。もう三週間もしたら、充分食えるだろう。まさか三週間以内にここを去る事もなかろう。,"The garden is a flat garden of about 10 tsubo, and there is no such plant. There is only one tangerine, and it is high enough to be a target from the bottom of the fence. Whenever I go home, I look at this tangerine. The place where mandarin oranges grow is very rare for those who have never left Tokyo. That blue fruit will gradually ripen and turn yellow, but it will be beautiful. Even now, there is another half color change. When I asked my grandmother, it was a delicious tangerine with a lot of water. When it's ripe now, I told you to eat it, so let's eat it little by little every day. It will be enough to eat in three weeks. I wouldn't leave here within three weeks.","The garden is about thirty feet square, with no particular plants worthy of name. There is one orange tree which is so tall as to be seen above the board fence from outside. Whenever I returned from the school I used to look at this orange tree. For to those who had not been outside of Tokyo, oranges on the tree are rather a novel sight. Those oranges now green will ripen by degrees and turn to yellow, when the tree would surely be beautiful. There are some already ripened. The old lady told me that they are juicy, sweet oranges. “They will all soon be ripe, and then help yourself to all you want,” she said. I think I will enjoy a few every day. They will be just right in about three weeks. I do not think I will have to leave the town in so short a time as three weeks.","The garden was a level patch of ground about twenty feet square, with nothing special in the way of plantings. There was a single mandarin orange tree, so tall that its top rose above the garden wall and served as a kind of landmark for the house. I always liked to gaze at this tree when I came home. For someone who had never been out of Tokyo before, the sight of the fruit hanging on the tree was a truly novel one. As they ripened, the green oranges would no doubt be turning to a golden color; that, I was sure, would be beautiful to see. Some of them were starting to change color already. According to the landlady, they were exceptionally juicy and delicious. She’d told me that I could help myself when they were ready to eat, and I was already looking forward to the time when I’d be able to enjoy a few each day. In another three weeks there ought to be plenty of them; surely, I thought, I wouldn’t be leaving here before then."
すると二人は小声で何か話し始めた。おれにはよく聞えない、また聞きたくもない。おれは空を見ながら清の事を考えている。金があって、清をつれて、こんな奇麗な所へ遊びに来たらさぞ愉快だろう。いくら景色がよくっても野だなどといっしょじゃつまらない。清は皺苦茶だらけの婆さんだが、どんな所へ連れて出たって恥ずかしい心持ちはしない。野だのようなのは、馬車に乗ろうが、船に乗ろうが、凌雲閣へのろうが、到底寄り付けたものじゃない。おれが教頭で、赤シャツがおれだったら、やっぱりおれにへけつけお世辞を使って赤シャツを冷かすに違いない。江戸っ子は軽薄だと云うがなるほどこんなものが田舎巡りをして、私は江戸っ子でげすと繰り返していたら、軽薄は江戸っ子で、江戸っ子は軽薄の事だと田舎者が思うに極まってる。こんな事を考えていると、何だか二人がくすくす笑い出した。笑い声の間に何か云うが途切れ途切れでとんと要領を得ない。,"Then they started talking in a whisper. I can't hear it well, and I don't want to hear it. I am thinking about Qing while looking at the sky. It would be fun to come to such a beautiful place with money and Qing. No matter how good the scenery is, it's boring to be in the field. Qing is an old woman full of wrinkles, but she doesn't feel embarrassed wherever she takes her. Whether it's a horse-drawn carriage, a boat, or a Ryounkaku, it's not like a field. If I was the vice-principal and I was the red shirt, I'm sure I would sneak up on me and use a compliment to cool the red shirt. It is said that Edokko is frivolous, but if such a thing goes around the countryside and I repeat that it is Edokko, the frivolous is Edokko, and the Edokko is frivolous. I think it's perfect. When I was thinking about this, the two of them giggled. Something is said between the laughter, but it's choppy and unreasonable.","Then the two began whispering. I could not hear well, nor did I care to. I was looking up at the sky and thinking about Kiyo. If I had enough of money, I thought, and came with Kiyo to such a picturesque place, how joyous it would be. No matter how picturesque the scene might be, it would be flat in the company of Clown or of his kind. Kiyo is a poor wrinkled woman, but I am not ashamed to take her to any old place. Clown or his likes, even in a Victoria or a yacht, or in a sky-high position, would not be worthy to come within her shadow. If I were the head teacher, and Red Shirt I, Clown would be sure to fawn on me and jeer at Red Shirt. They say Yedo kids are flippant. Indeed, if a fellow like Clown was to travel the country and repeatedly declare “I am a Yedo kid,” no wonder the country folk would decide that the flippant are Yedo kids and Yedo kids are flippant. While I was meditating like this, I heard suppressed laughter. Between their laughs they talked something, but I could not make out what they were talking about.","Before long the two of them began talking to each other about something in a hushed tone. I couldn’t hear them very well, and didn’t want to. As I gazed at the sky I was thinking about Kiyo. I was thinking how nice it would be if I had some money and I could bring her here to enjoy this pretty place. No matter how splendid the scenery was, it was no fun being here with the likes of the Hanger. Kiyo might be a wrinkled old woman, but I wouldn’t feel embarrassed to take her anywhere. People like the Hanger weren’t worth associating with no matter where you were – in a carriage, on a boat, even at the top of the twelve-story tower in Asakusa Park back in Tokyo. I was sure that if I were the Assistant Principal and Redshirt were in my position, I’d be the one this guy was buttering up and flattering all over the place, and Redshirt would be the one he was always sneering at. They say that Tokyo people are two-faced, and now I was beginning to see why : if a guy like the Hanger was going around the country telling everybody about how he was a true son of Tokyo at every chance he got, it’s no wonder that country people thought that ‘two-faced’ was just another way of calling somebody a Tokyoite, and vice versa. As these thoughts were passing through my head, I could hear the two of them breaking into a kind of muffled giggle. In between the laughs they were saying something to each other, but I could only make out bits and pieces of it and couldn’t catch the drift: ‘What?"
それから赤シャツと野だは一生懸命に釣っていたが、約一時間ばかりのうちに二人で十五六上げた。可笑しい事に釣れるのも、釣れるのも、みんなゴルキばかりだ。鯛なんて薬にしたくってもありゃしない。今日は露西亜文学の大当りだと赤シャツが野だに話している。あなたの手腕でゴルキなんですから、私なんぞがゴルキなのは仕方がありません。当り前ですなと野だが答えている。船頭に聞くとこの小魚は骨が多くって、まずくって、とても食えないんだそうだ。ただ肥料には出来るそうだ。赤シャツと野だは一生懸命に肥料を釣っているんだ。気の毒の至りだ。おれは一匹で懲りたから、胴の間へ仰向けになって、さっきから大空を眺めていた。釣をするよりこの方がよっぽど洒落ている。,"After that, I was fishing hard for the red shirt and the field, but in about an hour, the two of us raised 156. It's funny that you can catch it, and you can catch it only with Gorki. I don't even want to use sea bream as a medicine. The red shirt tells the field that it is a big hit in Russian literature today. I'm a Gorki with your skill, so I can't help being a Gorki. It's natural, but he answers. I heard from the boatman that this small fish has a lot of bones and is bad and can't be eaten very much. However, it seems that it can be used as fertilizer. The red shirt and the field are trying hard to catch fertilizer. I feel sorry for you. I was disciplined by myself, so I lay on my back between my torso and looked at the sky from a while ago. This is much more fashionable than fishing.","For some time, Red Shirt and Clown fished assiduously and within about an hour they caught about fifteen fish. The funny part of it was that all they caught were goruki; of sea-bream there was not a sign. “This is a day of bumper crop of Russian literature,” Red Shirt said, and Clown answered: “When one as skilled as you gets nothing but goruki, it’s natural for me to get nothing else.” The boatman told me that this small-sized fish goruki has too many tiny bones and tastes too poor to be fit for eating, but they could be used for fertilising. So Red Shirt and Clown were fishing fertilisers with vim and vigor. As for me, one goruki was enough and I laid down myself on the bottom, and looked up at the sky. This was far more dandy than fishing.","Redshirt and the Hanger kept fishing away, and in the space of about an hour they managed to land fifteen or sixteen fish between them. The funny thing was, every last one of the fish they caught was a goruki. There wasn’t even the slightest hint of a bream. ‘It’s a good day for Russian literature,’ Redshirt said to the Hanger, who replied that if goruki were what an expert like Redshirt was catching, someone like himself certainly couldn’t hope for anything else. According to the boatman, these fish are full of bones and have an awful taste, definitely not fit for eating; you could use them for fertilizer, though. So Redshirt and the Hanger had been busy fishing for fertilizer, then. It was absolutely pathetic. My one catch had been more than enough for me, and since then I had been lying on my back in the bottom of the boat and gazing up at the sky. This was a much more elegant pastime than fishing."
すると今までだまって聞いていた山嵐が奮然として、起ち上がった。野郎また赤シャツ賛成の意を表するな、どうせ、貴様とは喧嘩だ、勝手にしろと見ていると山嵐は硝子ガラス窓を振わせるような声で「私は教頭及びその他諸君のお説には全然不同意であります。というものはこの事件はどの点から見ても、五十名の寄宿生が新来の教師某氏を軽侮してこれを翻弄しようとした所為とより外には認められんのであります。教頭はその源因を教師の人物いかんにお求めになるようでありますが失礼ながらそれは失言かと思います。某氏が宿直にあたられたのは着後早々の事で、まだ生徒に接せられてから二十日に満たぬ頃であります。この短かい二十日間において生徒は君の学問人物を評価し得る余地がないのであります。軽侮されべき至当な理由があって、軽侮を受けたのなら生徒の行為に斟酌を加える理由もありましょうが、何らの源因もないのに新来の先生を愚弄するような軽薄な生徒を寛仮しては学校の威信に関わる事と思います。教育の精神は単に学問を授けるばかりではない、高尚な、正直な、武士的な元気を鼓吹すると同時に、野卑な、軽躁な、暴慢な悪風を掃蕩するにあると思います。もし反動が恐しいの、騒動が大きくなるのと姑息な事を云った日にはこの弊風はいつ矯正出来るか知れません。かかる弊風を杜絶するためにこそ吾々はこの学校に職を奉じているので、これを見逃がすくらいなら始めから教師にならん方がいいと思います。私は以上の理由で寄宿生一同を厳罰に処する上に、当該教師の面前において公けに謝罪の意を表せしむるのを至当の所置と心得ます」と云いながら、どんと腰を卸した。一同はだまって何にも言わない。赤シャツはまたパイプを拭き始めた。おれは何だか非常に嬉しかった。おれの云おうと思うところをおれの代りに山嵐がすっかり言ってくれたようなものだ。おれはこう云う単純な人間だから、今までの喧嘩はまるで忘れて、大いに難有いと云う顔をもって、腰を卸した山嵐の方を見たら、山嵐は一向知らん面をしている。,"Then, the mountain storm that I had been listening to until now suddenly stood up. Don't say yes to the red shirt again, anyway, I'm in a fight with you, and when I'm looking at it, Yamaarashi shook the glass window, saying, ""I'm the vice-principal and others. I totally disagree with the theory, because, from any point of view, this case is due to the fact that fifty boarders despised a new teacher and tried to play with it. It seems that the vice-principal asks for the cause from the teacher's person, but I'm sorry to say that it's a mistake. It's been less than 20 days since I was exposed to the glass. In these short 20 days, the students have no room to evaluate your academic figure. There is a good reason to be disrespected. If you've been despised, there may be a reason to take into account the student's actions, but if you're a frivolous student who ridicules a new teacher for no reason, it's about the prestige of the school. I think that the spirit of education is not just to confer learning, but to inspire lofty, honest, samurai spirit, and at the same time, to wipe out the savage, sly, and violent bad winds. I don't know when this bad luck can be corrected on the day when the reaction is scary, the turmoil is going to grow, and it's a sigh. I think it's better not to be a teacher from the beginning if you miss this. I will punish all the boarders for the above reasons and publicly apologize in front of the teacher. I know that it is the right place to quarrel. "" Everyone doesn't say anything. The red shirt also started wiping the pipe. I was very happy for some reason. It's like Yamaarashi completely said what I meant to say instead of me. I'm such a simple person, so when I look at Yamaarashi, who is a wholesaler, with a face that makes me forget about the fights I've had so far, and says that it's very difficult, Yamanashi looks like a stranger.","Porcupine, who up to this time had been listening to the others, stood up with some show of spirit. Ha, the fellow was going to endorse the views of Red Shirt, eh? You and I got to fight it out anyway , I thought, so do any way you darn please. Porcupine spoke in a thunderous voice: “I entirely differ from the opinions of the head teacher and other gentlemen. Because, viewed from whatever angle, this incident cannot be other than an attempt by those fifty students in the dormitory to make a fool of a new teacher. The head teacher seems to trace the cause of the trouble to the personality of that teacher himself, but, begging his pardon, I think he is mistaken. The night that new teacher was on night duty was not long after his arrival, not more than twenty days after he had come into contact with the students. During those short twenty days, the students could have no reason to criticise his knowledges or his person. If he was insulted for some cause which deserved insult, there may be reasons in our considering the act of the students, but if we show undue leniency toward the frivolous students who would insult a new teacher without cause, it would affect the dignity of this school. The spirit of education is not only in imparting technical knowledges, but also in encouraging honest, ennobling and samurai-like virtues, while eliminating the evil tendency to vulgarity and roughness. If we are afraid of reaction or further trouble, and satisfy ourselves with make-shifts, there is no telling when we can ever get rid of this evil atmosphere[G]. We are here to eradicate this very evil. If we mean to countenance it, we had better not accepted our positions here. For these reasons, I believe it proper to punish the students in the dormitory to the fullest extent and also make them apologize to that teacher in the open.” All were quiet. Red Shirt again began polishing his pipe. I was greatly elated. He spoke almost what I had wanted to. I’m such a simple-hearted fellow that I forgot all about the bickerings with Porcupine, and looked at him with a grateful face, but he appeared to take no notice of me.","At this point the Porcupine, who had been listening in silence so far, sprang up out of his seat. I was sure that this guy would also declare his support for Redshirt, not that I gave a damn considering that he was my enemy anyway, but in a voice so powerful it seemed to rattle the windows, he said: ‘I am absolutely opposed to the position taken by the Assistant Principal and the rest of you. That is to say, no matter how you consider the incident in question, there is no getting away from the fact that what we are dealing with here is a group of fifty dormitory students who engaged in a disrespectful attempt to take advantage of a certain newcomer to the teaching staff. The Assistant Principal seems to believe that the cause may be traced to the character of the teacher but, if you will excuse my saying so, I feel that he may have misstated the circumstances. This new teacher was assigned to night duty in the dormitory very shortly after his arrival here, less than twenty days after coming into contact with the students. A bare twenty days was not enough time to enable the students to develop a proper sense of his character as a man of learning. If he had been treated in such a disrespectful manner because he had proved himself unworthy of respect, there might indeed be reason to make allowances for the students’ conduct, but to excuse the behavior of impudent students who would expose a new teacher to ridicule without cause would, in my opinion, call into question the good reputation of this school. The spirit of education involves more than the mere imparting of knowledge. Along with inculcating a noble, upright, and manly character, it also consists, I believe, in the elimination of undesirable traits such as vulgarity, superficiality, and arrogance. If we were to allow ourselves to temporize out of fear of a backlash or of exacerbating this disturbance, there would be no telling when we could ever rectify such negative tendencies. It is precisely to strive for the elimination of these tendencies that we serve at this school, and if we were to neglect this duty it would have been better, I believe, for us never to have become educators at all. For these reasons it is imperative, in my opinion, that we compel the entire body of dormitory students to offer a public expression of apology directly to the instructor in question.’ Having said this, the Porcupine took his seat again with a thump. The entire room was speechless. Redshirt began rubbing his pipe again. I was tremendously happy. It was as if the Porcupine had said everything I had wanted to say for me. Being the simple kind of person I am, I had already completely forgotten how angry I’d been with him, and I glanced over in his direction with an expression of gratitude, but the look on his face was completely oblivious."

野だは大嫌いだ。こんな奴は沢庵石をつけて海の底へ沈めちまう方が日本のためだ。赤シャツは声が気に食わない。あれは持前の声をわざと気取ってあんな優しいように見せてるんだろう。いくら気取ったって、あの面じゃ駄目だ。惚れるものがあったってマドンナぐらいなものだ。しかし教頭だけに野だよりむずかしい事を云う。うちへ帰って、あいつの申し条を考えてみると一応もっとものようでもある。はっきりとした事は云わないから、見当がつきかねるが、何でも山嵐がよくない奴だから用心しろと云うのらしい。それならそうとはっきり断言するがいい、男らしくもない。そうして、そんな悪るい教師なら、早く免職さしたらよかろう。教頭なんて文学士の癖に意気地のないもんだ。蔭口をきくのでさえ、公然と名前が云えないくらいな男だから、弱虫に極まってる。弱虫は親切なものだから、あの赤シャツも女のような親切ものなんだろう。親切は親切、声は声だから、声が気に入らないって、親切を無にしちゃ筋が違う。それにしても世の中は不思議なものだ、虫の好かない奴が親切で、気のあった友達が悪漢だなんて、人を馬鹿にしている。大方田舎だから万事東京のさかに行くんだろう。物騒な所だ。今に火事が氷って、石が豆腐になるかも知れない。しかし、あの山嵐が生徒を煽動するなんて、いたずらをしそうもないがな。一番人望のある教師だと云うから、やろうと思ったら大抵の事は出来るかも知れないが、――第一そんな廻りくどい事をしないでも、じかにおれを捕まえて喧嘩を吹き懸けりゃ手数が省ける訳だ。おれが邪魔になるなら、実はこれこれだ、邪魔だから辞職してくれと云や、よさそうなもんだ。物は相談ずくでどうでもなる。向うの云い条がもっともなら、明日にでも辞職してやる。ここばかり米が出来る訳でもあるまい。どこの果へ行ったって、のたれ死はしないつもりだ。山嵐もよっぽど話せない奴だな。,"I hate the field. It is for Japan that such a person attaches Takuan stone and sinks to the bottom of the sea. I don't like the voice of the red shirt. That would make her voice look like that kind by deliberately pretending to be. No matter how pretentious it is, that aspect is useless. Something I fell in love with was like Madonna. However, only the vice-principal says something more difficult than the field. When I go back to my house and think about his claim, it seems reasonable. I don't know for sure, so I have no idea, but it seems that he should be careful because he is not good at mountain storms. If so, I should definitely say so, but I'm not masculine. Then, if you are such a bad teacher, you should dismiss your job as soon as possible. The vice-principal is stubborn about the habit of a literary person. Even if he listens to Kageguchi, he is a sissy man because he can't say his name openly. The sissy is kind, so that red shirt is kind like a woman. Kindness is kindness, and voice is voice, so if you don't like your voice, it's a different story to lose kindness. Even so, the world is strange, and it makes a fool of people that people who don't like insects are kind and friends who are interested are villains. It's mostly in the countryside, so everything will go to Tokyo. It's a noisy place. Now the fire may freeze and the stones may turn into tofu. However, it seems unlikely that the mountain storm will incite the students. He's the most promising teacher, so if you want to do it, you may be able to do most of the things, but first of all, even if you don't do such a roundabout thing, if you catch me directly and quarrel, it will take a lot of work. You can omit it. If I get in the way, this is actually this, and it looks good to ask me to resign because it's in the way. I don't care about things without consultation. If the word is right, I'll resign tomorrow. It doesn't mean that rice can be produced here. No matter where I go, I'm not going to die. Yamaarashi is a guy who can't talk at all.","I heartily despise Clown. It would be beneficial for Japan if such a fellow were tied to a quernstone and dumped into the sea. As to Red Shirt, his voice did not suit my fancy. I believe he suppresses his natural tones to put on airs and assume genteel manner. He may put on all kinds of airs, but nothing good will come of it with that type of face. If anything falls in love with him, perhaps the Madonna will be about the limit. As a head-teacher, however, he is more serious than Clown. As he did not say definitely, I cannot get to the point, but it appears that he warned me to look-out for Porcupine as he is crooked. If that was the case, he should have declared it like a man. And if Porcupine is so bad a teacher as that, it would be better to discharge him. What a lack of backbone for a head teacher and a Bachelor of Arts! As he is a fellow so cautious as to be unable to mention the name of the other even in a whisper, he is surely a mollycoddle. All mollycoddles are kind, and that Red Shirt may be as kind as a woman. His kindness is one thing, and his voice quite another, and it would be wrong to disregard his kindness on account of his voice. But then, isn’t this world a funny place! The fellow I don’t like is kind to me, and the friend whom I like is crooked,—how absurd! Probably everything here goes in opposite directions as it is in the country, the contrary holds in Tokyo. A dangerous place, this. By degrees, fires may get frozen and custard pudding petrified. But it is hardly believable that Porcupine would incite the students, although he might do most anything he wishes as he is best liked among them. Instead of taking in so roundabout a way, in the first place, it would have saved him a lot of trouble if he came direct to me and got at me for a fight. If I am in his way, he had better tell me so, and ask me to resign because I am in his way. There is nothing that cannot be settled by talking it over. If what he says sounds reasonable, I would resign even tomorrow. This is not the only town where I can get bread and butter; I ought not to die homeless wherever I go. I thought Porcupine was a better sport.","I couldn’t stand the Hanger-on. If somebody tied him to a nice big rock and dumped him in the ocean, they’d be doing Japan a favor. The sound of Redshirt’s voice made me sick. He could only get it to sound so smooth by using that stuck-up tone instead of his natural voice. No matter how stuck-up he sounded, though, it could never work with a face like that. If anybody was going to fall for it, it could only be somebody like the Madonna. Anyway, since he was the Assistant Principal, it was no wonder that what he said was harder to figure out than what the Hanger said. After I went home and did some thinking about what he’d told me, I came to the conclusion that there might well have been something to it. Since he didn’t spell everything out clearly, I couldn’t be completely sure that I understood what he was getting at, but basically the point seemed to be that the Porcupine was a bad guy and that I had better watch out for him. If that was it, though, he should have come right out and said so like a real man. And if the Porcupine was really such a bad teacher, he ought to just go ahead and fire the guy right away. For somebody who had a university degree the Assistant Principal was surprisingly fainthearted. He had to be a real weakling if he couldn’t even bring himself to name names when he was talking behind people’s backs. Weaklings are usually kindhearted people, so you might expect Redshirt to be kind too, in that womanish way of his. Kindness is one thing and a voice is another, so it would have been wrong not to take his kindness for what it was just because I didn’t care for his voice. Still, the world is a strange place when you think about it: a guy who rubs you the wrong way treats you kindly while a friend, somebody you get along with fine, turns out to be a scoundrel; it all seems like some kind of farce. This being the country, I figured, everything must be the opposite of what it was in Tokyo. You’ve got to watch out in a place like this – for all I knew fire might suddenly turn to ice out here, or the rocks might turn into lumps of tofu. But even so, the Porcupine stirring up the students against me? He hardly seemed to be the type for that kind of mischief … but then again … He was supposed to be the most popular teacher, so maybe he would be able to get away with just about anything he wanted, and yet … In the first place, if he were to just come after me in person and pick a fight, it certainly would have been a lot less trouble than taking such a roundabout approach. You would think that if he had some kind of problem with me, all he had to do was come and tell me what it was and demand that I resign. You can always work these things out if you talk them over. If it turned out that he was right, I’d be ready to hand in my resignation as of the following day. It wasn’t as if this was the only job in the world. No matter where I ended up, I was sure I’d manage to keep from starving. This Porcupine, I thought, could have used a little more sense."

けちな奴等だ。自分で自分のした事が云えないくらいなら、てんでしないがいい。証拠さえ挙がらなければ、しらを切るつもりで図太く構えていやがる。おれだって中学に居た時分は少しはいたずらもしたもんだ。しかしだれがしたと聞かれた時に、尻込みをするような卑怯な事はただの一度もなかった。したものはしたので、しないものはしないに極ってる。おれなんぞは、いくら、いたずらをしたって潔白なものだ。噓を吐いて罰を逃げるくらいなら、始めからいたずらなんかやるものか。いたずらと罰はつきもんだ。罰があるからいたずらも心持ちよく出来る。いたずらだけで罰はご免蒙るなんて下劣な根性がどこの国に流行ると思ってるんだ。金は借りるが、返す事はご免だと云う連中はみんな、こんな奴等が卒業してやる仕事に相違ない。全体中学校へ何しにはいってるんだ。学校へはいって、噓を吐いて、胡魔化して、陰でこせこせ生意気な悪いたずらをして、そうして大きな面で卒業すれば教育を受けたもんだと癇違いをしていやがる。話せない雑兵だ。,"They are stingy guys. If you can't say what you've done, don't be afraid. If there is no evidence, I will hold it boldly with the intention of cutting the pillar. I was a little mischievous when I was in junior high school. But when I was asked who did it, there was never a cowardly thing to do. I did what I did, so I don't do what I don't. No matter how much I mischief, I'm innocent. Is it something of a prank from the beginning, rather than spitting a lie and escaping the punishment? Mischief and punishment are inevitable. There is punishment, so you can play pranks with ease. I think that the vile guts that are exempt from punishment just for mischief are prevalent in any country. All the people who borrow money but don't want to return it must be the jobs they will graduate from. What are you going to the whole junior high school? He goes to school, lie, lie, sneak in the shadows, do cheeky mischief, and graduate in a big way, and he's misunderstood that he's educated. It's a soldier who can't talk.","Shrimps! If they were afraid of making a clean breast of their own deed, they should not have done it at all. They looked defiant, and appeared to insist on their innocence as long as no evidence was brought up. I myself did some mischief while in the middle school, but when the culprit was sought after, I was never so cowardly, not even once, to back out. What one has done, has been done; what he has not, has not been,—that’s the black and white of it. I, for one have been game and square, no matter how much mischief I might have done. If I wished to dodge the punishment, I would not start it. Mischief and punishment are bound to go together. We can enjoy mischief-making with some show of spirit because it is accompanied by certain consequences. Where does one expect to see the dastardly spirit which hungers for mischief-making without punishment, in vogue? The fellows who like to borrow money but not pay it back, are surely such as these students here after they are graduated. What did these fellows come to this middle school for, anyway? They enter a school, tattle round lies, play silly jokes behind some one by sneaking and cheating and get wrongly swell-headed when they finish the school thinking they have received an education. A common lot of jackasses they are.","How shabby could you get? If you’re not going to own up to what you’ve done, you shouldn’t have done anything in the first place. They obviously figured that as long as no evidence turned up, all they had to do was play dumb and they’d get away with it – of all the nerve! Of course, I’d been involved in my share of pranks myself when I was in middle school, but when they asked me whether I was the one who did it, I would never, ever try to weasel out of it. If I did it, I did it, and if I didn’t, I didn’t; that’s all there was to it. No matter how much mischief I was involved in, I still had my honor. If you’re just going to lie your way out of the punishment afterward, well, you shouldn’t have done anything to begin with. Mischief and punishment go hand in hand – it’s knowing that the punishment comes with it that makes it fun to dare to do the mischief. Did they really think that there was some low-down country out there where people could play tricks and then claim immunity from the consequences? This must be the way that those characters who borrow money off you and then refuse to pay it back get their start in life, too. Just what were these kids doing in a middle school anyway? If they thought that getting an education is about learning to lie and fake and play mean tricks when nobody’s looking, and then parading around proudly when you graduate, they still had a lot to learn. What riffraff!"

そうこうするうち時間が来たから、山嵐と一所に会場へ行く。会場は花晨亭といって、当地で第一等の料理屋だそうだが、おれは一度も足を入れた事がない。もとの家老とかの屋敷を買い入れて、そのまま開業したという話だが、なるほど見懸からして厳めしい構えだ。家老の屋敷が料理屋になるのは、陣羽織を縫い直して、胴着にする様なものだ。,"As time came, I went to the venue with Yamaarashi. The venue is called Hanashitei, which is said to be the first-class restaurant in the area, but I have never visited it. It is said that he bought the mansion of the original elder and opened it as it is, but it is a strict stance from the point of view. Making a priest's mansion into a restaurant is like re-sewing a jinbaori to make it a bodice.","About then, the time for the farewell dinner party arrived, and I went to the hall with Porcupine. The dinner party was to be held at Kashin-tei which is said to be the leading restaurant in the town, but I had never been in the house before. This restaurant, I understood, was formerly the private residence of the chief retainer of the daimyo of the province, and its condition seemed to confirm the story. The residence of a chief retainer transformed into a restaurant was like making a saucepan out of warrior’s armor.","By and by the time came for the Porcupine and me to set off for the banquet. It was being held at a restaurant called Kashin-tei, which was supposed to be the fanciest in town. I had never set foot in the place before. I had heard that the building used to be the mansion of one of the senior retainers of the local feudal lord; later it had been sold off and turned into a restaurant with a minimum of remodeling, and it certainly did retain an imposing appearance. Converting a senior retainer’s residence into an eating-and-drinking establishment seemed a little like taking a warrior’s magnificent battle robe and turning it into underwear as far as I was concerned."

ぶうと云って汽船がとまると、艀が岸を離れて、漕ぎ寄せて来た。船頭は真っ裸に赤ふんどしをしめている。野蛮な所だ。もっともこの熱さでは着物はきられまい。日が強いので水がやに光る。見つめていても眼がくらむ。事務員に聞いてみるとおれはここへ降りるのだそうだ。見るところでは大森ぐらいな漁村だ。人を馬鹿にしていらあ、こんな所に我慢が出来るものかと思ったが仕方がない。威勢よく一番に飛び込んだ。続づいて五六人は乗ったろう。外に大きな箱を四つばかり積み込んで赤ふんは岸へ漕ぎ戻して来た。陸へ着いた時も、いの一番に飛び上がって、いきなり、磯に立っていた鼻たれ小僧をつらまえて中学校はどこだと聞いた。小僧はぼんやりして、知らんがの、と云った。気の利かぬ田舎ものだ。猫の額ほどな町内の癖に、中学校のありかも知らぬ奴があるものか。ところへ妙な筒っぽうを着た男がきて、こっちへ来いと云うから、尾いて行ったら、港屋とか云う宿屋へ連れて来た。やな女が声を揃えてお上がりなさいと云うので、上がるのがいやになった。門口へ立ったなり中学校を教えろと云ったら、中学校はこれから汽車で二里ばかり行かなくっちゃいけないと聞いて、なお上がるのがいやになった。おれは、筒っぽうを着た男から、おれの革鞄を二つ引きたくって、のそのそあるき出した。宿屋のものは変な顔をしていた。,"When the steamer stopped, the barge left the shore and rowed. The boatman is naked and has a red loincloth. It's a savage place. However, the kimono cannot be cut off with this heat. The sun is strong, so the water shines a little. Even if I stare at it, my eyes are dazzled. When I asked the clerk, I heard that I was going down here. As you can see, it's a fishing village like Omori. I wondered if I could put up with such a place if I made a fool of people, but it can't be helped. I jumped into the first place with dash. Then 56 people would get on. I loaded four big boxes outside and rowed the red dung back to the shore. When I arrived at the land, I jumped up to the top of the table and suddenly asked where the junior high school was, with the nose-sucking kid standing on the rocky shore. The little boy was vague and said he didn't know. It's a clumsy countryside. Is there a person who doesn't know if there is a junior high school in the habit of the town that is about the forehead of a cat? By the way, a man wearing a strange tube came and told me to come here, so when I followed him, he brought me to an inn called Minatoya. I didn't want to go up because the nasty woman told me to go up with all the voices. As soon as I stood at the gate and asked to teach junior high school, I heard that junior high school would have to go only two miles by train, and I didn't want to go up. I wanted to pull two of my leather bags from a man wearing a tube, and I pulled them out. The one in the inn had a strange face.","With a long, sonorous whistle the steamer which I was aboard came to a standstill, and a boat was seen making toward us from the shore.

The sun’s rays were strong and the water glimmered in such strange colors as to dazzle one’s sight if gazed at it for long. I had been told by a clerk of the ship that I was to get off here. The place looked like a fishing village about the size of Omori. Great Scott! I wouldn’t stay in such a hole, I thought, but I had to get out. So, down I jumped first into the boat, and I think five or six others followed me. After loading about four large boxes besides, the red-cloth rowed us ashore. When the boat struck the sand, I was again the first to jump out, and right away I accosted a skinny urchin standing nearby, asking him where the middle school was. The kid answered blankly that he did not know. Confound the dull-head! Not to know where the middle school was, living in such a tiny bit of a town. Then a man wearing a rig with short, queer shaped sleeves approached me and bade me follow. I walked after him and was taken to an inn called Minato-ya. The maids of the inn, who gave me a disagreeable impression, chorused at sight of me; “Please step inside.” This discouraged me in proceeding further, and I asked them, standing at the door-way, to show me the middle school. On being told that the middle school was about four miles away by rail, I became still more discouraged at putting up there. I snatched my two valises from the man with queer-shaped [B] sleeves who had guided me so far, and strode away. The people of the inn looked after me with a dazed expression.","When the ship came to a stop with a blast from its whistle, a barge pulled out from the shore and was rowed over to us. The boatman was stark naked except for a red loincloth. What a barbaric place! Of course, he probably couldn’t stand wearing a kimono in that searing heat. The sun beat down so fiercely that the water shone with a nasty glint to it. Just looking at it was enough to make your eyes swim. I asked the purser if this was where I was supposed to get off and he said it was. From the look of it the place was a fishing town about the size of the neighborhood of ōmori in Tokyo. Who the hell did they think they were, sending me to a place like this? How was I supposed to stand it? Well, there was nothing I could do about it now. I jumped down onto the barge ahead of everybody else, and five or six people got on after me. They loaded a couple of big boxes on too and then Redloin rowed us in to the shore. When we landed I was again the first one to jump off. Right away I grabbed a runny-nosed kid who was standing there and asked him where the middle school was, but he just gawked at me and said ‘I dunno.’ The dim-witted hick! The whole town wasn’t any bigger than a cat’s forehead, so how could you not know where the middle school was? Just then a man in a strange-looking kimono with tight sleeves walked up and said ‘Come with me’ and when I followed along he led me to an inn called Minato-ya or something like that. A bunch of nasty-looking maids all joined voices to greet me, which just made me want to have nothing to do with the place. I stopped in the entryway and asked them where the middle school was. When they told me that it was a couple of miles away by train , I was even more determined not to stay here. I snatched my two valises from the guy in the tight-sleeved kimono and started walking. The people in the inn gave me a strange look."
しばらくして山嵐はまた起立した。「ただ今ちょっと失念して言い落しましたから、申します。当夜の宿直員は宿直中外出して温泉に行かれたようであるが、あれはもっての外の事と考えます。いやしくも自分が一校の留守番を引き受けながら、咎める者のないのを幸に、場所もあろうに温泉などへ入湯にいくなどと云うのは大きな失体である。生徒は生徒として、この点については校長からとくに責任者にご注意あらん事を希望します」,"After a while, Yamastorm stood up again. ""I've just forgotten a little and said it, so I'm sorry. It seems that the night shift staff went out to the hot springs during the night shift, but I think that's something outside of the school. Fortunately there is no one to blame while taking on the answering machine, it is a big loss to go to a hot spring etc. regardless of the place. As a student, the principal is especially responsible for this point. I hope you will be careful. ""","After a while, Porcupine again stood up, and said. “I forgot to mention just now, so I wish to add. The teacher on night duty that night seems to have gone to the hot springs during his duty hours, and I think it a blunder. It is a matter of serious misconduct to take the advantage of being in sole charge of the school, to slip out to a hot springs. The bad behavior of the students is one thing; this blunder is another, and I wish the principal to call attention of the responsible person to that matter.”","After a short while the Porcupine stood up again and made the following remarks: ‘I would like to add one more point which I neglected to mention during my previous comments. It is my understanding that the instructor on dormitory duty on the night in question left his post to pay a visit to the hot spring. This, I believe, was totally inexcusable. For someone who had accepted the responsibility of standing watch over the school to take advantage of the situation and go off to bathe at a hot spring resort, of all places, simply because there was no one present to call him to account, is misconduct of a very serious kind. It is my hope that along with the disciplining of the students, the Principal will immediately issue a stern reprimand to the party in question.’"
「貴様等は奸物だから、こうやって天誅を加えるんだ。これに懲りて以来つつしむがいい。いくら言葉巧みに弁解が立っても正義は許さんぞ」と山嵐が云ったら両人共だまっていた。ことによると口をきくのが退儀なのかも知れない。,"""Because you are a goddamn thing, add Tenchu in this way. It's okay to squeeze it since you've been disciplined. No matter how skillfully you make an excuse, justice is forgiving."" Was there. Perhaps it is reckless to speak.",“This is the punishment of heaven on you grovelling wretches. Keep this in your head and be more careful hereafter. You can never talk down justice.” The two said nothing. They were so thoroughly cowed that they could not speak.,"‘This is the just punishment you rogues deserve. I hope you’ve learned your lesson and behave yourselves from now on. It doesn’t matter how slick your excuses are – what’s wrong is wrong, and you won’t get away with it!’ Neither of them made any reply to the Porcupine’s warning. Probably by this point they just didn’t feel up to saying anything."
山嵐とおれが絶交の姿となったに引き易えて、赤シャツとおれは依然として在来の関係を保って、交際をつづけている。野芹川で逢った翌日などは、学校へ出ると第一番におれの傍へ来て、君今度の下宿はいいですかのまたいっしょに露西亜ロシア文学を釣りに行こうじゃないかのといろいろな事を話しかけた。おれは少々憎らしかったから、昨夜は二返逢いましたねと云ったら、ええ停車場で――君はいつでもあの時分出掛けるのですか、遅いじゃないかと云う。野芹川の土手でもお目に懸りましたねと喰らわしてやったら、いいえ僕はあっちへは行かない、湯にはいって、すぐ帰ったと答えた。何もそんなに隠さないでもよかろう、現に逢ってるんだ。よく噓をつく男だ。これで中学の教頭が勤まるなら、おれなんか大学総長がつとまる。おれはこの時からいよいよ赤シャツを信用しなくなった。信用しない赤シャツとは口をきいて、感心している山嵐とは話をしない。世の中は随分妙なものだ。,"The red shirt and I still maintain the traditional relationship and continue to have a relationship, as Yamaarashi and I have become estranged. The day after I met in Noserigawa, when I went to school, I came to the side of me first, and I wondered if you should go to the boarding house next time, and let's go fishing with Russian literature. I talked about something. I was a little hated, so if I said I met him twice last night, yes, at the stop-you always go out at that time, isn't it late? When I ate it on the bank of the Noseri River, I said no, I wouldn't go there, I went to the hot water and went home soon. You don't have to hide anything so much, I'm actually meeting you. A man who often lie. If this is the vice-principal of junior high school, I will be the president of the university. From this time on, I finally stopped trusting the red shirt. He talks about untrustworthy red shirts and doesn't talk to Yamaarashi, who is impressed. The world is quite strange.","While Porcupine and I were thus estranged, Red Shirt and I continued friendly relations and associated together. On the day following my accidental meeting with him near the Nozeri river, for instance, Red Shirt came to my desk as soon as he came to the school, and asked me how I liked the new boarding house. He said we would go together for fishing Russian literature again, and talked on many things. I felt a bit piqued, and said, “I saw you twice last night,” and he answered, “Yes, at the station. Do you go there at that time every day? Isn’t it late?” I startled him with the remark; “I met you on the levy of the Nozeri river too, didn’t I?” and he replied, “No, I didn’t go in that direction. I returned right after my bath.” What is the use of trying to keep it dark. Didn’t we meet actually face to face? He tells too many lies. If one can hold the job of a head teacher and act in this fashion, I should be able to run the position of Chancellor of a university. From this time on, my confidence in Red Shirt became still less. I talk with Red Shirt whom I do not trust, and I keep silent with Porcupine whom I respect. Funny things do happen in this world.","While the Porcupine and I still wouldn’t have anything to do with each other, my relationship with Redshirt went on as before. The morning after the Nozeri River incident, as soon as I arrived at school he came over to my desk and started asking me all kinds of questions about how I liked my new lodgings and whether I wouldn’t like to go on another fishing expedition for Russian literature and the like. I found this attitude of his a little obnoxious, so I mentioned something about how we had run into each other twice the night before. ‘ Yes,’ he replied, ‘at the station – umm, is that the time you always go out? On the late side, isn’t it?’ When I hit him with the news that I had also seen him by the Nozeri River, he said no, he hadn’t been there, he’d gone straight home from the bathhouse. The liar! There shouldn’t have been any need to hide it; I definitely had seen him there, after all. If a man like him was worthy of being the Assistant Principal of a middle school, well, I must be worthy of being the President of a university. From that time on I stopped trusting Redshirt. But while I was still on speaking terms with him, a man I didn’t trust, I wasn’t talking to the Porcupine, whom I now admired. This world is a very strange place."
やがて書記の川村がどうかお着席をと云うから、柱があって靠りかかるのに都合のいい所へ坐った。海屋の懸物の前に狸が羽織、袴で着席すると、左に赤シャツが同じく羽織袴で陣取った。右の方は主人公だというのでうらなり先生、これも日本服で控えている。おれは洋服だから、かしこまるのが窮屈だったから、すぐ胡坐をかいた。隣りの体操教師は黒で、ちゃんとかしこまっている。体操の教師だけにいやに修行が積んでいる。やがてお膳が出る。徳利が並ぶ。幹事が立って、一言開会の辞を述べる。それから狸が立つ。赤シャツが起つ。ことごとく送別の辞を述べたが、三人共申し合せたようにうらなり君の、良教師で好人物な事を吹聴して、今回去られるのはまことに残念である、学校としてのみならず、個人として大いに惜しむところであるが、ご一身上のご都合で、切に転任をご希望になったのだから致し方がないという意味を述べた。こんな噓をついて送別会を開いて、それでちっとも恥かしいとも思っていない。ことに赤シャツに至って三人のうちで一番うらなり君をほめた。この良友を失うのは実に自分にとって大なる不幸であるとまで云った。しかもそのいい方がいかにも、もっともらしくって、例のやさしい声を一層やさしくして、述べ立てるのだから、始めて聞いたものは、誰でもきっとだまされるに極ってる。マドンナも大方この手で引掛けたんだろう。赤シャツが送別の辞を述べ立てている最中、向側に坐っていた山嵐がおれの顔を見てちょっと稲光をさした。おれは返電として、人指し指でべっかんこうをして見せた。,"Eventually, Kawamura, the secretary, asked me to take a seat, so I sat down at a convenient place with pillars. When the fox was seated in a haori and hakama in front of Kaiya's hangings, the red shirt on the left was also in a haori hakama. The one on the right is the main character, so Mr. Uranari, this is also in Japanese clothes. Since I'm clothes, I was cramped to clench, so I immediately cross-legged. The gymnastics teacher next door is black and clever. Only gymnastics teachers are practicing unpleasantly. The set will come out soon. The sake bottles are lined up. The secretary will stand and give the opening remarks. Then the raccoon stands. A red shirt wakes up. I said farewell to all of them, but it's a pity that I'm leaving this time after hearing about Uranari-kun's good teacher and good person, as the three of us agreed, not only as a school but also as an individual. However, I said that I couldn't help it because I really wanted to transfer because of my personal circumstances. I had a farewell party with such a lie, and I don't think it's embarrassing at all. Especially when it came to the red shirt, I praised you most of the three. He even said that losing this good friend was a great misfortune for me. What's more, the good one is really plausible, and the gentle voice of the example is made even easier and stated, so anyone who hears it for the first time will surely be deceived. Madonna probably caught it with this hand too. While the red shirt was saying goodbye, Yamaarashi, who was sitting on the other side, saw my face and gave a little lightning. As a return, I showed him a bekko with my index finger.","By and by, Kawamura, the clerk, requested all to be seated. I chose one in front of a pillar so I could lean against it. Badger sat in front of the panel of Kaioku in Japanese full dress. On his left sat Red Shirt similarly dressed, and on his right Hubbard Squash, as the guest of honor, in the same kind of dress. I was dressed in a European suit, and being unable to sit down, squatted on my legs at once. The teacher of physical culture next to me, though in the same kind of rags as mine, sat squarely in Japanese fashion. As a teacher of his line he appeared to have well trained himself. Then the dinner trays were served and the bottles placed beside them. The manager of the day stood up and made a brief opening address. He was followed by Badger and Red Shirt. These two made farewell addresses, and dwelt at length on Hubbard Squash being an ideal teacher and gentleman, expressing their regret, saying his departure was a great loss not only to the school but to them in person. They concluded that it could not be helped, however, since the transfer was due to his own earnest desire and for his own convenience. They appeared to be ashamed not in the least by telling such a lie at a farewell dinner. Particularly, Red Shirt, of these three, praised Hubard Squash in lavish terms. He went so far as to declare that to lose this true friend was a great personal loss to him. Moreover, his tone was so impressive in its same old gentle tone that one who listens to him for the first time would be sure to be misled. Probably he won the Madonna by this same trick. While Red Shirt was uttering his farewell buncomb, Porcupine who sat on the other side across me, winked at me. As an answer of this, I “snooked” at him.","Eventually the secretary, Kawamura, asked us to take our seats. Since we were sitting on the floor, I chose a spot that had a pillar behind it that I’d be able to lean my back against. The Principal, attired in a formal kimono with ceremonial skirt and jacket, occupied the seat of highest rank, directly in front of the Kaioku scroll. Redshirt, in a similar outfit, occupied the place to his left. To his right was the guest of honor, the Pale Squash, also in Japanese dress. I was in a Western suit, which made it uncomfortable for me to sit in the formal position with my legs folded under me, so I promptly began sitting with my knees crossed. Next to me was the physical education teacher, in black trousers, sitting in a proper formal position; as you would expect from somebody who taught that subject, his self-discipline showed. Finally the trays with our meals were brought out. There were flasks of saké, too. The teacher who was in charge of making the arrangements rose and delivered some brief introductory remarks. Then the Badger rose, followed by Redshirt. Each of the three offered his own parting tribute but, in such a similar style it made you wonder if they hadn’t coordinated the whole thing in advance, they all proclaimed their admiration for the Squash’s stellar qualities as an educator and as a human being, followed by expressions of profound regret at his impending departure and the great loss that it represented not only for the school but on a personal level, and protestations that as it had been his earnest desire to obtain a transfer due to various personal circumstances, they were left with no alternative but to honor his wishes. None of them showed the slightest sense of shame at uttering such barefaced lies at a farewell banquet. Redshirt was the most effusive of all – he even had the audacity to claim that the loss of such a fine friend was a great personal misfortune for him. Moreover, since his remarks sounded so convincing, and were delivered in a tone that was dripping with even more gentility than usual, anybody who happened to be listening to him for the first time would undoubtedly have been taken in. This must have been the way he got the Madonna to fall for him, too. Midway through this farewell speech of Redshirt’s, the Porcupine flashed me a withering glance from across the way. I silently signaled back my own disgust by pulling my lower eyelid down with my finger."
教員が控所へ揃うには一時間目の喇叭が鳴らなくてはならぬ。大分時間がある。校長は時計を出して見て、追々ゆるりと話すつもりだが、まず大体の事を呑み込んでおいてもらおうと云って、それから教育の精神について長いお談義を聞かした。おれは無論いい加減に聞いていたが、途中からこれは飛んだ所へ来たと思った。校長の云うようにはとても出来ない。おれみたような無鉄砲なものをつらまえて、生徒の模範になれの、一校の師表と仰がれなくてはいかんの、学問以外に個人の徳化を及ぼさなくては教育者になれないの、と無暗に法外な注文をする。そんなえらい人が月給四十円で遥々こんな田舎へくるもんか。人間は大概似たもんだ。腹が立てば喧嘩の一つぐらいは誰でもするだろうと思ってたが、この様子じゃめったに口も聞けない、散歩も出来ない。そんなむずかしい役なら雇う前にこれこれだと話すがいい。おれは噓をつくのが嫌いだから、仕方がない、だまされて来たのだとあきらめて、思い切りよく、ここで断わって帰っちまおうと思った。宿屋へ五円やったから財布の中には九円なにがししかない。九円じゃ東京までは帰れない。茶代なんかやらなければよかった。惜しい事をした。しかし九円だって、どうかならない事はない。旅費は足りなくっても噓をつくよりましだと思って、到底あなたのおっしゃる通りにゃ、出来ません、この辞令は返しますと云ったら、校長は狸のような眼をぱちつかせておれの顔を見ていた。やがて、今のはただ希望である、あなたが希望通り出来ないのはよく知っているから心配しなくってもいいと云いながら笑った。そのくらいよく知ってるなら、始めから威嚇さなければいいのに。,"In order for the teachers to arrive at the waiting room, the first hour's whisper must sound. I have a lot of time. The principal will take the clock out and talk slowly, but first he asks him to swallow most of the things, and then he hears a long talk about the spirit of education. Of course I was sloppy, but I thought that this came to the place where I flew from the middle. I can't do it as the principal says. You can't become an educator if you don't have to be a teacher of a school, you have to be a teacher of a school, and you have to make an individual virtue other than scholarship. And, implicitly make an exorbitant order. I wonder if such a great person would come to such a countryside with a monthly salary of 40 yen. Humans are generally similar. I thought that if I got angry, anyone would have one of the fights, but I can rarely hear or take a walk in this situation. If it's such a difficult role, say this before hiring. I don't like to lie, so I can't help it, I gave up thinking that I was fooled, and decided to take the plunge and turn down here and go home. I went to the inn for 5 yen, so there is only 9 yen in my wallet. You can't go back to Tokyo with nine yen. I wish I hadn't done anything like tea. I did something regrettable. However, there is nothing wrong with nine yen. I think it's better than having a lie even if I don't have enough travel expenses, so I can't do it exactly as you say. I was looking at my face. Eventually, I laughed, saying that now is just hope, and you don't have to worry because you know you can't do what you want. If you know that well, you shouldn't be intimidating from the beginning.","The teachers would not be all in the room until the bugle for the first hour was sounded. There was plenty of time. The principal took out his watch, and saying that he would acquaint me particularly with the school by-and-bye, he would only furnish me now with general matters, and started a long lecture on the spirit of education. For a while I listened to him with my mind half away somewhere else, but about half way through his lecture, I began to realize that I should soon be in a bad fix. I could not do, by any means, all he expected of me. He expected that I should make myself an example to the students, should become an object of admiration for the whole school or should exert my moral influence, besides teaching technical knowledge in order to become a real educator, or something ridiculously high-sounding. No man with such admirable qualities would come so far away for only 40 yen a month! Men are generally alike. If one gets excited, one is liable to fight, I thought, but if things are to be kept on in the way the principal says, I could hardly open my mouth to utter anything, nor take a stroll around the place. If they wanted me to fill such an onerous post, they should have told all that before. I hate to tell a lie; I would give it up as having been cheated, and get out of this mess like a man there and then. I had only about 9 yen left in my pocket after tipping the hotel 5 yen. Nine yen would not take me back to Tokyo. I had better not have tipped the hotel; what a pity! However, I would be able to manage it somehow. I considered it better to run short in my return expenses than to tell a lie. “I cannot do it the way you want me to. I return this appointment.” I shoved back the note. The principal winked his badger-like eyes and gazed at me. Then he said; “What I have said just now is what I desire of you. I know well that you cannot do all I want, So don’t worry.”","The entire faculty wouldn’t be assembling in the staff room until the first-period bugle sounded, which wouldn’t be for a while yet. The Principal pulled out his pocket watch, gave it a glance, and announced that he planned to have a long, leisurely talk with me later on, but to begin with he wanted me to understand the main points in a general way; then launched into a lengthy discourse on the Spirit of Education. I just stood there more or less taking it in, of course, but as he droned on I began to think that I had let myself in for a lot of trouble by coming here. There was no way I could do what this Principal was expecting. Telling a reckless character like me that I was to be a role model for the students, and that I would be required to conduct myself in such a way that I would be looked up to by everyone in the school, and that a true educator is one who not only imparts knowledge but exerts a positive moral influence in his personal life – this was asking for a lot more than he had any reasonable right to expect. Did he really think that anyone of such distinction was going to come all the way out to some country town like this for forty yen a month? It had always seemed to me that all people are pretty much the same, and if something gets them angry enough they’re bound to get themselves into a fight or two. At this rate, though, I’d just have to hold my tongue; in fact, I could hardly even go out for a walk! If the assignment was so demanding, they should have explained exactly what was involved before they’d hired me. I don’t like lying, so there was no way out of it: I just had to face the fact that I’d come here based on a misapprehension, and make up my mind to give up the job and head for home right away. Now that I’d given the people at the inn that five-yen bill, all I had left was nine yen and change – not enough to get me back to Tokyo. What a blunder that tip had been! Even with only nine yen, though, things would work out one way or another. Even if it wasn’t enough to cover my trip home, it was still better than lying. When I informed the Principal that I couldn’t possibly live up to the expectations he had for me and was therefore returning my Certificate of Appointment, he blinked those badger eyes of his and gazed into my face for a few moments. Then he laughed and said that what he had been talking about before was simply his ideal, and he was well aware that I wouldn’t be able to live up to it so there was no need for me to worry. Well, if he was so sure of this all along, why did he have to intimidate me with that speech to begin with?"
おれはこんな腐った了見の奴等と談判するのは胸糞が悪るいから、「そんなに云われなきゃ、聞かなくっていい。中学校へはいって、上品も下品も区別が出来ないのは気の毒なものだ」と云って六人を逐っ放してやった。おれは言葉や様子こそあまり上品じゃないが、心はこいつらよりも遥かに上品なつもりだ。六人は悠々と引き揚げた。上部だけは教師のおれよりよっぽどえらく見える。実は落ち付いているだけなお悪るい。おれには到底これほどの度胸はない。,"It's awkward to talk to these rotten people, so I'm sorry to say, ""If you don't say that, you don't have to ask. It's a pity that you can't tell the difference between classy and vulgar when you go to junior high school. I said, and let go of the six people. I'm not very classy in words and appearance, but I think my heart is far more classy than these guys. The six people withdrew calmly. Only the upper part looks much better than my teacher. Actually, it's just calm and bad. I have no courage like this.","My hatred of talking with these scamps became intense, so I dismissed them by saying: “If you fellows have nothing to say, let it go at that. You deserve pity for not knowing the decent from the vulgar after coming to a middle school.” I am not very decent in my own language or manner, but am sure that my moral standard is far more decent than that of these gangs. Those six boys filed out leisurely. Outwardly they appeared more dignified than I their teacher, it was the more repulsive for their calm behavior. I have no temerity equal to theirs.","Getting into a debate with a bunch of kids who had such a rotten attitude made me feel sick to my stomach, so I just said ‘All right, never mind. If you’re in middle school and you still don’t know anything about what it means to have some class, you’re pathetic,’ and sent all six of them back to bed. There may be nothing very classy about the way I talk or the way I look, but I think I can say that when it comes to heart the quality is there, which is a lot more than you could say for them. The six of them drifted away, looking so cool and composed that if you were only judging by appearances, you could say that they cut much finer figures than I, their teacher, did. But in fact their attitude just showed all the more clearly how little class they really had. I could never pull off anything like that myself."

それから一時間ほどするうちに席上は大分乱れて来る。まあ一杯、おや僕が飲めと云うのに……などと呂律の巡りかねるのも一人二人出来て来た。少々退屈したから便所へ行って、昔風な庭を星明りにすかして眺めていると山嵐が来た。どうださっきの演説はうまかったろう。と大分得意である。大賛成だが一ヶ所気に入らないと抗議を申し込んだら、どこが不賛成だと聞いた。,"Then, about an hour later, the seats were disturbed. Well, I couldn't go around Ruri, even though I said I could drink it. I was a little bored, so I went to the toilet and looked at the old-fashioned garden in the starlight, and a mountain storm came. How was your speech good? I am very good at it. I strongly agree, but when I applied for a protest that I didn't like one place, I heard that I disagree.","Within about an hour from this, the room became pretty lively. “Hey, have another, hic; ain’t goin’, hic, have one on me?” One or two already in a pickled state appeared on the scene. I was little tired, and going out to the porch, was looking at the old fashioned garden by the dim star light, when Porcupine came. “How did you like my speech? Wasn’t it grand, though!” he remarked in a highly elated tone. I protested that while I approved 99 per cent, of his speech, there was one per cent, that I did not.","By the time an hour or so had passed, things were starting to drift out of control. A couple of people were already pretty tipsy: ‘Go on, have yourshelf another drink … No no, I told you to have one , I inshisht … ’ This was becoming a little tedious, so I excused myself and headed for the bathroom. As I stood in the courtyard admiring the old-fashioned garden by the light of the moon, the Porcupine appeared. ‘How about it, pretty good speech, wasn’t it?’ He was obviously quite pleased with himself. I agreed that it was excellent, but there was one comment that I did object to."

うらなりが、そんなに厭がっているなら、なぜ留任の運動をしてやらなかったと聞いてみたら、うらなりから話を聞いた時は、既にきまってしまって、校長へ二度、赤シャツへ一度行って談判してみたが、どうする事も出来なかったと話した。それについても古賀があまり好人物過ぎるから困る。赤シャツから話があった時、断然断わるか、一応考えてみますと逃げればいいのに、あの弁舌に胡魔化されて、即席に許諾したものだから、あとからお母さんが泣きついても、自分が談判に行っても役に立たなかったと非常に残念がった。,"If I was so reluctant, I asked why I didn't do the exercise to stay, but when I heard from Uranari, I was already confused and went to the principal twice and once to the red shirt. I tried to talk to him, but he said he couldn't do anything about it. Koga is too good at that too, so I'm in trouble. When I heard from the red shirt, I should definitely refuse or think about it, but I should run away, but I was fooled by that speech and gave it to me instantly, so even if my mother cries afterwards, I myself I was very disappointed that it didn't help when I went to the talk.","“If Hubbard Squash does not like to go down to Nobeoka, why didn’t you do something to enable him remain here,” I asked, and Porcupine said that when he heard the story from Hubbard Squash, everything had been settled already, but he had asked the principal twice and Red Shirt once to have the transfer order cancelled, but to no purpose. Porcupine bitterly condemned Hubbard Squash for being too good-natured. If Hubbard Squash, he said, had either flatly refused or delayed the answer on the pretext of considering it, when Red Shirt raised the question of transfer, it would have been better for him. But he was fooled by the oily tongue of Red Shirt, had accepted the transfer outright, and all efforts by Porcupine who was moved by the tearful appeal of the mother, proved unavailing.","Well done!’ I asked him how come he hadn’t stepped in to try and keep the Squash here when it was so obvious that he didn’t want to leave. By the time the Squash had told him about it, he said, everything had already been settled. He had tried appealing to the Principal twice and to Redshirt once, but nothing could be done. Anyway, he continued, part of the problem was that Koga was simply too nice a person. When Redshirt broke the news to him, he should have refused outright, or said that he would think it over at least, but instead he let himself be taken in by all that smooth talk and accepted it on the spot, so that when his mother went to plead his case later, and when the Porcupine himself went to make his appeal, it was totally useless. All very regrettable."

家を畳んでからも清の所へは折々行った。清の甥というのは存外結構な人である。おれが行くたびに、居りさえすれば、何くれと款待なしてくれた。清はおれを前へ置いて、いろいろおれの自慢を甥に聞かせた。今に学校を卒業すると麴町辺へ屋敷を買って役所へ通うのだなどと吹聴した事もある。独りで極めて一人で喋舌るから、こっちは困まって顔を赤くした。それも一度や二度ではない。折々おれが小さい時寝小便をした事まで持ち出すには閉口した。甥は何と思って清の自慢を聞いていたか分らぬ。ただ清は昔風の女だから、自分とおれの関係を封建時代の主従のように考えていた。自分の主人なら甥のためにも主人に相違ないと合点したものらしい。甥こそいい面の皮だ。,"Even after I folded my house, I went to the Qing dynasty from time to time. The nephew of the Qing dynasty is a surprisingly good person. Every time I went, as long as I was there, he gave me a hospitality. Qing put me in front of me and told my nephew what I was proud of. I have heard that when I graduate from school now, I will buy a mansion in Kojimachi and go to the government office. I talked very much by myself, so I was in trouble and turned my face red. It's not once or twice. Occasionally I closed my mouth to take out even the fact that I had bedwetting when I was small. I don't know what my nephew thought he was listening to Qing's pride. However, since Qing is an old-fashioned woman, she thought of her relationship with me like a feudal master-servant. It seems that his husband must have been the master for his nephew. My nephew is the skin of the good side.","Once in a while, since our house was no more, I went to Kiyo’s nephew’s to see her. Her nephew was unusually good-natured, and whenever I called upon her, he treated me well if he happened to be at home. Kiyo would boost me sky-high to her nephew right to my face. She went so far once as to say that when I had graduated from school, I would purchase a house somewhere in Kojimachi-ku and get a position in a government office. She decided everything in her own way, and talked of it aloud, and I was made an unwilling and bashful listener. I do not know how her nephew weighed her tales of self-indulgence on me. Kiyo was a woman of the old type, and seemed, as if it was still the days of Feudal Lords, to regard her nephew equally under obligation to me even as she was herself.","I had gone to visit Kiyo a number of times since we had gotten rid of the old house. Her nephew turned out to be a surprisingly fine person. He would always go out of his way to be nice to me if he was at home when I visited. Kiyo would sing my praises to him – she would even announce that I was going to buy a mansion in Kōjimachi and get a good job with the government as soon as I graduated. Since she had taken it on herself to chart my life out this way, these conversations were kind of hard for me and all I could do was sit there and blush. And it wasn’t only once or twice that this happened. Sometimes she would even talk about the way I wet my bed when I was little, which was enough to make me squirm. I don’t know what the nephew was thinking as he listened to Kiyo carrying on like this. At any rate, she was an old-fashioned kind of woman, and she thought of our relationship in terms of the master-retainer relations of feudal times. She seemed to believe that if I was her master, then I ranked as her nephew’s master as well. It must have been pretty embarrassing for him! In due course it was officially confirmed that I had been hired."
教師も生徒も帰ってしまったあとで、一人ぽかんとしているのは随分間が抜けたものだ。宿直部屋は教場の裏手にある寄宿舎の西はずれの一室だ。ちょっとはいってみたが、西日をまともに受けて、苦しくって居たたまれない。田舎だけあって秋がきても、気長に暑いもんだ。生徒の賄を取りよせて晩飯を済ましたが、まずいには恐れ入った。よくあんなものを食って、あれだけに暴れられたもんだ。それで晩飯を急いで四時半に片付けてしまうんだから豪傑に違いない。飯は食ったが、まだ日が暮れないから寝る訳に行かない。ちょっと温泉に行きたくなった。宿直をして、外へ出るのはいい事だか、悪るい事だかしらないが、こうつくねんとして重禁錮同様な憂目に逢うのは我慢の出来るもんじゃない。始めて学校へ来た時当直の人はと聞いたら、ちょっと用達に出たと小使が答えたのを妙だと思ったが、自分に番が廻ってみると思い当る。出る方が正しいのだ。おれは小使にちょっと出てくると云ったら、何かご用ですかと聞くから、用じゃない、温泉へはいるんだと答えて、さっさと出掛けた。赤手拭は宿へ忘れて来たのが残念だが今日は先方で借りるとしよう。,"After the teachers and students have returned, it's been a long time since I was alone. The night duty room is a room on the west side of the dormitory behind the school. I went in for a while, but I couldn't help feeling the pain of the sun. Even if autumn comes because of the countryside, it's still hot. I got the student's money and finished the dinner, but I was afraid. I used to eat that kind of thing, and that was the only thing that went wild. That's why I must be a great master because I hurry to get rid of dinner at 4:30. I ate rice, but I can't go to bed because the sun hasn't set yet. I wanted to go to a hot spring for a while. It may be a good thing or a bad thing to go out after a night shift, but I can't stand the same kind of grief as a heavy ban. When I first came to school, when I heard that the person on duty was on duty, I thought it strange that the ambassador answered that he was a little servant, but I think it's his turn. It's better to get out. When I told the ambassador that I was going to come out for a while, I asked him if he needed something, so he answered that he was going to a hot spring, not for something, and went out immediately. It's a pity that I forgot the red towel to the inn, but let's rent it today.","To remain alone in the school after the faculty and students had gone home, was something particularly awkward. The room for the night watch was in the rear of the school building at the west end of the dormitory. I stepped inside to see how it was, and finding it squarely facing the setting sun, I thought I would melt. In spite of autumn having already set in, the hot spell still lingered, quite in keeping with the dilly-dally atmosphere of the country. I ordered the same kind of meal as served for the students, and finished my supper. The meal was unspeakably poor. It was a wonder they could subsist on such miserable stuff and keep on “roughing it” in that lively fashion. Not only that, they were always hungry for supper, finishing it at 4.30 in the afternoon. They must be heroes in a sense. I had thus my supper, but the sun being still high, could not go to bed yet. I felt like going to the hot-springs. I did not know the wrong or right of night watch going out, but it was oppressively trying to stand a life akin to heavy imprisonment. When I called at the school the first time and inquired about night watch, I was told by the janitor that he had just gone out and I thought it strange. But now by taking the turn of night watch myself, I could fathom the situation; it was right for any night watch to go out. I told the janitor that I was going out for a minute. He asked me “on business?” and I answered “No,” but to take a bath at the hot springs, and went out straight. It was too bad that I had left my red towel at home, but I would borrow one over there for to-day.","Once the other teachers and the day students had gone home, there was nothing for me to do but sit around by myself, which felt kind of silly. The night duty room was on the west end of the dormitory building, behind the building where the classrooms were. The late afternoon sun was pouring in full blast, and from the moment I went in it was so hot I couldn’t stand it. Even though the summer was over, the heat took its time out here in the country, just like everything else. I had one of the dinners they gave the students brought in; I could hardly believe how awful it was. It was amazing that they had the energy to run around the way they did on a diet of that kind of stuff. What’s more, they made such quick work of it that they were all done by half past four – you really had to take your hat off to them! It was still light out when I finished dinner, so going to bed was obviously out of the question. Suddenly I got the urge to pay a visit to the hot spring. I wasn’t sure whether it was all right to leave the premises when you were on night duty, but the idea of sitting around there staring off into space like a prisoner in solitary confinement was more than I could bear. I’d thought it was strange when I had asked for the night duty teacher that first time I came to the school and the custodian had told me that he was out running an errand, but now that it was my turn I could see why. Better to go. I told the custodian that I was going out for a little while, and when he asked me if it was on business I said no, I was going to the hot spring, and went on my way. Unfortunately I had left my red towel at home, but I could always rent one at the bathhouse."
もう大抵お揃いでしょうかと校長が云うと、書記の川村と云うのが一つ二つと頭数を勘定してみる。一人足りない。一人不足ですがと考えていたが、これは足りないはずだ。唐茄子のうらなり君が来ていない。おれとうらなり君とはどう云う宿世の因縁かしらないが、この人の顔を見て以来どうしても忘れられない。控所へくれば、すぐ、うらなり君が眼に付く、途中をあるいていても、うらなり先生の様子が心に浮ぶ。温泉へ行くと、うらなり君が時々蒼い顔をして湯壺のなかに膨れている。挨拶をするとへえと恐縮して頭を下げるから気の毒になる。学校へ出てうらなり君ほど大人しい人は居ない。めったに笑った事もないが、余計な口をきいた事もない。おれは君子という言葉を書物の上で知ってるが、これは字引にあるばかりで、生きてるものではないと思ってたが、うらなり君に逢ってから始めて、やっぱり正体のある文字だと感心したくらいだ。,"When the principal asks if they are all the same, Kawamura, the secretary, counts the number of heads one by one. Not enough. I thought there was a shortage of one person, but this should not be enough. Kara Eggplant's Uranari-kun hasn't come. I don't know what kind of relationship you have with me, but I've never forgotten it since I saw this person's face. As soon as you come to the waiting room, you will notice Uranari, and even if you are on the way, you will be able to see Mr. Uranari in your mind. When I go to the hot spring, Uranari sometimes looks blue and swells in the jar. When I say hello, I feel sorry for him because he bows his head. No one is as quiet as you when you go to school. I rarely laugh, but I haven't spoken too much. I know the word Kimiko in the book, but I thought that it was just in the text and not alive, but I was impressed that it was a true character after I met you. I did.","“All now here?” asked the principal, and the clerk named Kawamura counted one, two, three and one was short. “Just one more,” said the clerk, and it ought to be; Hubbard Squash was not there. I don’t know what affinity there is between Hubbard Squash and me, but I can never forget his face. When I come to the teachers’ room, his face attracts me first; while walking out in the street, his manners are recalled to my mind. When I go to the hot springs, sometimes I meet him with a pale-face in the bath, and if I hallooed to him, he would raise his trembling head, making me feel sorry for him. In the school there is no teacher so quiet as he. He seldom, if ever, laughs or talks. I knew the word “gentleman” from books, and thought it was found only in the dictionary, but not a thing alive. But since I met Hubbard Squash, I was impressed for the first time that the word represented a real substance.","‘Well, it appears that just about everyone is here,’ the Principal began, at which point the school clerk, a man named Kawamura, did a head count. Somebody was missing. ‘ Short by one,’ he reported, and tried to figure out who it was. There was nothing to figure out: the Pale Squash wasn’t there. I don’t know what kind of karmic connection there was between the two of us, but right from the first time I saw the man’s face I hadn’t been able to get it out of my mind. He was always the first one I noticed when I arrived in the faculty room, and even when I was just walking around somewhere his image would float into my mind’s eye. When I went to the hot spring, I would sometimes find him sitting and soaking in the tub with that pale, puffy face of his. Whenever I said hello to him he would just mumble something back and bow so meekly that it made me feel sorry for him. Nobody in the whole school was as mild-mannered as the Pale Squash. He hardly ever smiled; he hardly ever said any more than he had to, either. ‘Gentleman’ was a word that I had come across sometimes in books, but I had always thought that even if it existed in the dictionary, there were no examples to be found in real life. When I met the Squash, though, I was so impressed that for the first time in my life I began to believe that maybe it was more than just a word after all. Since the Squash had become such an important figure to me, it’s"

母が死んでから六年目の正月におやじも卒中で亡くなった。その年の四月におれはある私立の中学校を卒業する。六月に兄は商業学校を卒業した。兄は何とか会社の九州の支店に口があって行かなければならん。おれは東京でまだ学問をしなければならない。兄は家を売って財産を片付けて任地へ出立すると云い出した。おれはどうでもするがよかろうと返事をした。どうせ兄の厄介になる気はない。世話をしてくれるにしたところで、喧嘩をするから、向うでも何とか云い出すに極っている。なまじい保護を受ければこそ、こんな兄に頭を下げなければならない。牛乳配達をしても食ってられると覚悟をした。兄はそれから道具屋を呼んで来て、先祖代々の瓦落多を二束三文に売った。家屋敷はある人の周旋である金満家に譲った。この方は大分金になったようだが、詳しい事は一向知らぬ。おれは一ヶ月以前から、しばらく前途の方向のつくまで神田の小川町へ下宿していた。清は十何年居たうちが人手に渡るのを大いに残念がったが、自分のものでないから、仕様がなかった。あなたがもう少し年をとっていらっしゃれば、ここがご相続が出来ますものをとしきりに口説いていた。もう少し年をとって相続が出来るものなら、今でも相続が出来るはずだ。婆さんは何も知らないから年さえ取れば兄の家がもらえると信じている。,"On New Year's Day, the sixth year since my mother died, my father also died of a stroke. In April of that year, I graduated from a private junior high school. In June my brother graduated from commercial school. My brother has to go to the Kyushu branch of the company somehow. I still have to study in Tokyo. My brother said he would sell his house, clean up his fortune, and leave for his post. I replied that I didn't care. I don't feel like getting in trouble with my brother anyway. When I was taken care of, I had a fight, so I was able to say something about it. You have to bow to such an older brother only if you receive the same protection. I was prepared to eat even if I delivered milk. My brother then called in a tool shop and sold the ancestral tiles to two bundles and three sentences. The mansion was handed over to the Kinman family, who is the circumstance of a certain person. This person seems to have made a lot of money, but I don't know the details at all. From a month ago, I stayed in Ogawamachi, Kanda, for a while until I got the direction ahead. Qing was very disappointed that he had been in the hands for ten years, but he didn't have the specifications because he didn't own it. If you were a little older, I was constantly arguing about what could be inherited here. If you can inherit a little older, you should still be able to inherit. She doesn't know anything, so she believes she can get her brother's house if she gets older.","In January of the 6th year after mother’s death, father died of apoplexy. In April of the same year, I graduated from a middle school, and two months later, my brother graduated from a business college. Soon he obtained a job in the Kyushu branch of a certain firm and had to go there, while I had to remain in Tokyo and continue my study. He proposed the sale of our house and the realization of our property, to which I answered “Just as you like it.” I had no intention of depending upon him anyway. Even were he to look after me , I was sure of his starting something which would eventually end in a smash-up as we were prone to quarrel on the least pretext. It was because in order to receive his protection that I should have to bow before such a fellow, that I resolved that I would live by myself even if I had to do milk delivery. Shortly afterwards he sent for a second-hand dealer and sold for a song all the bric-a-bric which had been handed down from ages ago in our family. Our house and lot were sold, through the efforts of a middleman to a wealthy person. This transaction seemed to have netted a goodly sum to him, but I know nothing as to the detail. For one month previous to this, I had been rooming in a boarding house in Kanda-ku, pending a decision as to my future course. Kiyo was greatly grieved to see the house in which she had lived so many years change ownership, but she was helpless in the matter. “If you were a little older, you might have inherited this house,” she once remarked in earnest. If I could have inherited the house through being a little older, I ought to have been able to inherit the house right then. She knew nothing, and believed the lack of age only prevented my coming into the possession of the house.","In January of the sixth year after my mother’s death, the old man had a stroke and died. That April I graduated from a private middle school, and in June my brother graduated from his business school. He took a job with some company, and was assigned to their office in Kyushu. I still had to finish my education in Tokyo. My brother announced that he was going to sell off the house and all our parents’ possessions before heading off to Kyushu. I told him he could do whatever he wanted as far as I was concerned. No matter what, I didn’t want to feel beholden to him for anything. And even if he did try to take care of me, I knew that he wouldn’t miss a chance to use it against me when we got into a quarrel, which we were bound to do sooner or later anyway. I wasn’t about to bow down to a brother like him just so I could get whatever help he might be willing to give me. I figured that there would always be something I could do to get by on my own – even if it meant that I’d have to work as a milkman, well, I was ready. My brother brought in a dealer in second-hand goods and sold off all the junk that had accumulated in our house from generation to generation for next to nothing. He got somebody to help him unload the house and land, and they managed to find a wealthy buyer. It seems that he made a lot of money off the deal, but I don’t know any of the details. I had already moved out a month before and taken a room in a boardinghouse in Kanda until I could figure out my next move. Kiyo was very upset that the house she had been serving in for more than ten years was being let go, but it wasn’t hers so there was nothing she could do about it. Over and over she lamented that if only I had been a little bit older I could have inherited the place myself. Of course, if I could have inherited it when I was a little older, I should have been entitled to inherit it just as easily right then. The old woman didn’t understand how these things work at all, so she actually thought that getting older was all it took for you to inherit an older brother’s property."

ここへ来た時第一番に氷水を奢ったのは山嵐だ。そんな裏表のある奴から、氷水でも奢ってもらっちゃ、おれの顔に関わる。おれはたった一杯しか飲まなかったから一銭五厘しか払わしちゃない。しかし一銭だろうが五厘だろうが、詐欺師の恩になっては、死ぬまで心持ちがよくない。あした学校へ行ったら、一銭五厘返しておこう。おれは清から三円借りている。その三円は五年経った今日までまだ返さない。返せないんじゃない。返さないんだ。清は今に返すだろうなどと、かりそめにもおれの懐中をあてにしてはいない。おれも今に返そうなどと他人がましい義理立てはしないつもりだ。こっちがこんな心配をすればするほど清の心を疑ぐるようなもので、清の美しい心にけちを付けると同じ事になる。返さないのは清を踏みつけるのじゃない、清をおれの片破れと思うからだ。清と山嵐とはもとより比べ物にならないが、たとい氷水だろうが、甘茶だろうが、他人から恵を受けて、だまっているのは向うをひとかどの人間と見立てて、その人間に対する厚意の所作だ。割前を出せばそれだけの事で済むところを、心のうちで難有いと恩に着るのは銭金で買える返礼じゃない。無位無冠でも一人前の独立した人間だ。独立した人間が頭を下げるのは百万両より尊といお礼と思わなければならない。,"When I came here, it was the mountain storm that was the first to get ice water. I got a guy with such a front and back to take care of me with ice water, and it's related to my face. I drank only one cup, so I only pay one coin. However, whether it's a penny or five, the scammers don't feel good until they die. If you go to tomorrow's school I owe three yen from Qing. The three yen has not been returned until today, five years later. I can't return it. I won't return it. Qing does not rely on my pocket for Karisome, saying that he will return it now. I'm not going to make a good intention for others to return it now. The more I worry about this, the more I doubt the Qing dynasty's heart, and it is the same as stinging the beautiful Qing dynasty's heart. I don't return it because I don't trample on Kiyo, I think Kiyo is one of my smashes. The Qing and Yamaarashi are incomparable, but whether it's ice water or amacha, they are blessed by others, and they think that the other person is a human being, and they are kind to that person. is. It is not a repayment that you can buy with money to benefit from the difficulty in your heart, where you can do just that if you give a discount. He is a full-fledged independent human being, even if he is uncrowned. It must be considered that an independent person bows his head more than a million cars.","When I came here, Porcupine was the first to treat me to ice water. To be treated by such a fellow, even if it is so trifling a thing as ice water, affects my honor. I had only one glass then and had him pay only one sen and a half. But one sen or half sen, I shall not die in peace if I accept a favor from a swindler. I will pay it back tomorrow when I go to the school. I borrowed three yen from Kiyo. That three yen is not paid yet to-day, though it is five years since. Not that I could not pay, but that I did not want to. Kiyo never looks to my pocket thinking I shall pay it back by-the-bye. Not by any means. I myself do not expect to fulfill cold obligation like a stranger by meditating on returning it. The more I worry about paying it back, the more I may be doubting the honest heart of Kiyo. It would be the same as traducing her pure mind. I have not paid her back that three yen not because I regard her lightly, but because I regard her as part of myself. Kiyo and Porcupine cannot be compared, of course, but whether it be ice water or tea, the fact that I accept another’s favor without saying anything is an act of good-will, taking the other on his par value, as a decent fellow. Instead of chipping in my share, and settling each account, to receive munificence with grateful mind is an acknowledgment which no amount of money can purchase. I have neither title nor official position but I am an independent fellow, and to have an independent fellow kowtow to you in acknowledgment of the favor you extend him should be considered as far more than a return acknowledgment with a million yen.","The Porcupine had been the first to treat me to a dish of shaved ice after I got here. But to let myself be treated to anything by such a two-faced guy, even just a dish of ice, would be a disgrace. All I had was one helping, so it only cost him one and a half sen. But to be beholden to such a phony, even just a sen’s or even a half sen’s worth, would make me feel awful for the rest of my life. Tomorrow, I decided, I’d return the money as soon as I got to school. Now, there were also those three yen I had borrowed from Kiyo five years ago, which I had never paid back. It wasn’t that I didn’t have the money; I simply hadn’t done it. Nor, of course, did she have any expectation that I’d be paying her back any time either. And I, for my part, had no intention of repaying her as if it was just some financial transaction between two strangers. If I was to treat it that way, it would seem as if I didn’t really believe in Kiyo’s generosity, as if I was denying the purity of her feelings for me. The reason I hadn’t returned it wasn’t because I was trying to cheat her; it was because I thought of her as part of my own self. Of course there was a world of difference between Kiyo and the Porcupine, but when somebody treats you to something and you make no effort to decline it, whether it’s a dish of shaved ice, a cup of sweet tea, or whatever, well, it shows the kind of respect and goodwill you have for that person. The sense of gratitude that you feel in your heart when you accept a favor from someone, which you could easily have avoided by paying your own way, is a form of giving back that goes beyond anything that money could buy. I may not have the kind of title or position that will impress people, but I’m still a free, full-grown human being. And when such a person finds you worthy of respect, you should consider it something more precious than a fortune in gold."
手紙をかいてしまったら、いい心持ちになって眠気がさしたから、最前のように座敷の真中へのびのびと大の字に寝た。今度は夢も何も見ないでぐっすり寝た。この部屋かいと大きな声がするので目が覚めたら、山嵐がはいって来た。最前は失敬、君の受持ちは……と人が起き上がるや否や談判を開かれたので大いに狼狽した。受持ちを聞いてみると別段むずかしい事もなさそうだから承知した。このくらいの事なら、明後日は愚、明日から始めろと云ったって驚ろかない。授業上の打ち合せが済んだら、君はいつまでこんな宿屋に居るつもりでもあるまい、僕がいい下宿を周旋してやるから移りたまえ。外のものでは承知しないが僕が話せばすぐ出来る。早い方がいいから、今日見て、あす移って、あさってから学校へ行けば極りがいいと一人で呑み込んでいる。なるほど十五畳敷にいつまで居る訳にも行くまい。月給をみんな宿料に払っても追っつかないかもしれぬ。五円の茶代を奮発してすぐ移るのはちと残念だが、どうせ移る者なら、早く引き越して落ち付く方が便利だから、そこのところはよろしく山嵐に頼む事にした。すると山嵐はともかくもいっしょに来てみろと云うから、行った。町はずれの岡の中腹にある家で至極閑静だ。主人は骨董を売買するいか銀と云う男で、女房は亭主よりも四つばかり年嵩の女だ。中学校に居た時ウィッチと云う言葉を習った事があるがこの女房はまさにウィッチに似ている。ウィッチだって人の女房だから構わない。とうとう明日から引き移る事にした。帰りに山嵐は通町で氷水を一杯奢った。学校で逢った時はやに横風な失敬な奴だと思ったが、こんなにいろいろ世話をしてくれるところを見ると、わるい男でもなさそうだ。ただおれと同じようにせっかちで肝癪持らしい。あとで聞いたらこの男が一番生徒に人望があるのだそうだ。,"When I wrote the letter, I felt good and drowsy, so I slept in the middle of the tatami room like the front. This time I slept soundly without dreaming anything. There was a loud voice in this room, so when I woke up, a mountain storm came in. I was very upset because the discussion was held as soon as a person got up, saying that he was disrespectful at the front and that you were in charge of it. When I asked him what he was in charge of, I knew that it wouldn't be particularly difficult. With this kind of thing, the day after tomorrow is stupid, and I'm not surprised to say that I should start tomorrow. After the class meeting, you don't intend to stay in such an inn forever, I'll go around a good boarding house, so move on. I don't know if it's outside, but I can do it as soon as I speak. It's better to be early, so I'm swallowing it alone, saying that it's best to see it today, move tomorrow, and then go to school. I see, I can't even go to stay in the 15 tatami mats for a long time. Even if everyone pays the monthly salary for the rent, they may not be able to catch up. It's a pity that it's a shame to move immediately after inspiring a five-yen tea fee, but if you're moving, it's more convenient to move early and settle down, so I decided to ask Yamaarashi for that. Then Yamaarashi asked me to come with him anyway, so I went. It's a very quiet house on the hillside of Oka on the outskirts of town. The husband is a man who buys and sells antiques or silver, and his wife is a woman who is four years older than her husband. I learned the word witch when I was in junior high school, but this wife is just like a witch. It doesn't matter if the witch is a man's wife. I finally decided to move from tomorrow. On the way back, Yamaarashi filled up with ice water in Tsumachi. When I met him at school, I thought he was a crosswind and disrespectful guy, but when I saw him taking care of me so much, he didn't seem to be a bad guy. Just like me, he is impatient and seems to have a liver. I heard later that this guy has the most hope for his students.","When I finished writing the letter, I felt better and sleepy. So I slept in the centre of the room, as I had done before, in the letter “big” shape ([D]). No dream this time, and I had a sound sleep. “Is this the room?”—a loud voice was heard,—a voice which woke me up, and Porcupine entered. “How do you do? What you have to do in the school——” he began talking shop as soon as I got up and rattled me much. On learning my duties in the school, there seemed to be no difficulty, and I decided to accept. If only such were what was expected of me, I would not be surprised were I told to start not only two days hence but even from the following day. The talk on business over, Porcupine said that he did not think it was my intention to stay in such a hotel all the time, that he would find a room for me in a good boarding house, and that I should move. “They wouldn’t take in another from anybody else but I can do it right away. The sooner the better. Go and look at the room to-day, move tomorrow and start teaching from the next day. That’ll be all nice and settled.” He seemed satisfied by arranging all by himself. Indeed, I should not be able to occupy such a room for long. I might have to blow in all of my salary for the hotel bill and yet be short of squaring it. It was pity to leave the hotel so soon after I had just shone with a 5-yen tip. However, it being decidedly convenient to move and get settled early if I had to move at all, I asked Porcupine to get that room for me. He told me then to come over with him and see the house at any rate, and I did. The house was situated mid-way up a hill at the end of the town, and was a quiet. The boss was said to be a dealer in antique curios, called Ikagin, and his wife was about four years his senior. I learned the English word “witch” when I was in middle school, and this woman looked exactly like one. But as she was another man’s wife, what did I care if she was a witch. Finally I decided to live in the house from the next day. On our way back Porcupine treated me to a cup of ice-water. When I first met him in the school, I thought him a disgustingly overbearing fellow, but judging by the way he had looked after me so far, he appeared not so bad after all. Only he seemed, like me, impatient by nature and of quick-temper. I heard afterward that he was liked most by all the students in the school.","I was feeling nice and relaxed after I finished my letter, so I stretched out on the floor in the middle of the room again and drifted off to sleep. This time I slept really soundly, no dreams at all. I only woke up when I heard somebody bellowing ‘Is this the room?’ and saw the Porcupine walk in. Before I was even completely awake, he was already getting the proceedings under way: ‘Sorry about this morning. Now, your classes are … ’ At first I was so stunned I could hardly follow what he was saying, but as I listened I realized that the classes he was assigning me didn’t sound particularly difficult, so I just went along with it. If that was all there was to it, he could have asked me to start right in the next day, never mind the day after. Once that was settled he announced, as if he had the whole thing worked out already, that I obviously couldn’t be planning on staying at this inn very long, and that he knew a good place to stay where they wouldn’t rent a room to just anybody but if he put in a good word for me they’d be sure to take me in, so I should get ready to move right away. It would be a good idea to have a look at the place today and get going as soon as possible, he added, so that I could get moved in the next day before my teaching duties began. It was true that I couldn’t hope to stay on in this fancy room indefinitely; it might cost more than my whole salary for all I knew. It was too bad that I’d have to leave so soon after laying out that five yen tip. But since I was going to leave eventually anyhow it made sense to leave right away and get settled into a new place, so I asked the Porcupine to make the arrangements. He told me that I should go along with him and have a look, so I did. It was a very quiet place, on the side of a hill at the edge of town. The owner was an antiques dealer who went by the name of Ikagin; his wife looked to be a couple of years older than he was. When I was in middle school I had learned the word ‘witch’ in English class, and this lady looked just like one. Even if she was a witch, of course, it wasn’t me that she was married to, so I didn’t mind. We settled it that I would move in the next day. On the way back to the inn the Porcupine treated me to a dish of shaved ice. When I’d first met him at school I’d thought he was awfully rude and arrogant, but now that I saw him doing these things for me, he didn’t seem so bad after all. I guess it was just that he was impulsive, plus he had a temper – the same as me. Later I heard that he was the most popular teacher with the students."

天麩羅蕎麦もうちへ帰って、一晩寝たらそんなに肝癪に障らなくなった。学校へ出てみると、生徒も出ている。何だか訳が分らない。それから三日ばかりは無事であったが、四日目の晩に住田と云う所へ行って団子を食った。この住田と云う所は温泉のある町で城下から汽車だと十分ばかり、歩いて三十分で行かれる、料理屋も温泉宿も、公園もある上に遊廓がある。おれのはいった団子屋は遊廓の入口にあって、大変うまいという評判だから、温泉に行った帰りがけにちょっと食ってみた。今度は生徒にも逢わなかったから、誰も知るまいと思って、翌日学校へ行って、一時間目の教場へはいると団子二皿七銭と書いてある。実際おれは二皿食って七銭払った。どうも厄介な奴等だ。二時間目にもきっと何かあると思うと遊廓の団子旨い旨いと書いてある。あきれ返った奴等だ。団子がそれで済んだと思ったら今度は赤手拭と云うのが評判になった。何の事だと思ったら、つまらない来歴だ。おれはここへ来てから、毎日住田の温泉へ行く事に極めている。ほかの所は何を見ても東京の足元にも及ばないが温泉だけは立派なものだ。せっかく来た者だから毎日はいってやろうという気で、晩飯前に運動かたがた出掛る。ところが行くときは必ず西洋手拭の大きな奴をぶら下げて行く。この手拭が湯に染った上へ、赤い縞が流れ出したのでちょっと見ると紅色に見える。おれはこの手拭を行きも帰りも、汽車に乗ってもあるいても、常にぶら下げている。それで生徒がおれの事を赤手拭赤手拭と云うんだそうだ。どうも狭い土地に住んでるとうるさいものだ。まだある。温泉は三階の新築で上等は浴衣をかして、流しをつけて八銭で済む。その上に女が天目へ茶を載せて出す。おれはいつでも上等へはいった。すると四十円の月給で毎日上等へはいるのは贅沢だと云い出した。余計なお世話だ。まだある。湯壺は花崗石を畳み上げて、十五畳敷ぐらいの広さに仕切ってある。大抵は十三四人漬ってるがたまには誰も居ない事がある。深さは立って乳の辺まであるから、運動のために、湯の中を泳ぐのはなかなか愉快だ。おれは人の居ないのを見済しては十五畳の湯壺を泳ぎ巡って喜んでいた。ところがある日三階から威勢よく下りて今日も泳げるかなとざくろ口を覗いてみると、大きな札へ黒々と湯の中で泳ぐべからずとかいて貼りつけてある。湯の中で泳ぐものは、あまりあるまいから、この貼札はおれのために特別に新調したのかも知れない。おれはそれから泳ぐのは断念した。泳ぐのは断念したが、学校へ出てみると、例の通り黒板に湯の中で泳ぐべからずと書いてあるには驚ろいた。何だか生徒全体がおれ一人を探偵しているように思われた。くさくさした。生徒が何を云ったって、やろうと思った事をやめるようなおれではないが、何でこんな狭苦しい鼻の先がつかえるような所へ来たのかと思うと情なくなった。それでうちへ帰ると相変らず骨董責である。,"Tensoba soba also went home, and after sleeping overnight, it didn't hurt my liver so much. When I went to school, there were some students. I don't understand why. After that, it was safe for only three days, but on the evening of the fourth day, I went to a place called Sumita and ate dumplings. This place called Sumita is a town with hot springs, and if you take a train from the castle, you can go there in 30 minutes on foot. There are restaurants, hot spring inns, parks, and a yukaku. The dumpling shop I went to was at the entrance of the Yukaku, and it has a good reputation, so I ate a little on the way home from the hot springs. I didn't meet the students this time, so I thought no one would know, so I went to school the next day and went to the school for the first hour. In fact, I ate two dishes and paid seven sen. Somehow troublesome guys. It is written that the dumplings of Yukaku are delicious when I think there is something in the second hour. Those who were disappointed. When I thought that the dumplings were done with that, it became popular to call it a red towel. Whatever you think of it, it's a boring history. Since I came here, I have been going to the hot springs of Sumita every day. No matter what you look at elsewhere, it's not as good as Tokyo's feet, but only the hot springs are magnificent. Since I came here, I decided to go every day, so I went out to exercise before dinner. However, whenever I go, I always hang a big Western towel. This hand towel was dyed in hot water, and red stripes flowed out, so it looks crimson at a glance. I always hang this towel on my way back and forth, whether I'm on the train or not. That's why the students call me red washcloth. It's noisy to live in a small land. There are still. The hot spring is a new building on the 3rd floor, and you can wear a yukata and put a sink on it for 8 sen. On top of that, a woman puts tea on Tenmoku and serves it. I always went to the top. Then, he said that it was a luxury to go to the top every day with a monthly salary of 40 yen. It's none of your business. There are still. The jar is made by folding granite and partitioning it into a size of about 15 tatami mats. Usually I'm soaked in 134 people, but sometimes no one is there. It's quite fun to swim in the hot water for exercise because the depth is up to the side of the milk. After seeing that there were no people, I was delighted to swim around the 15 tatami mats. However, one day I went down from the 3rd floor and looked into the pomegranate mouth to see if I could swim today. There aren't many things to swim in the hot water, so this tag may have been specially renewed for me. I then gave up swimming. I gave up swimming, but when I went to school, I was surprised to find that the blackboard says that I shouldn't swim in hot water. Somehow the whole student seemed to detect me alone. It was crunchy. No matter what the students said, I didn't stop doing what I wanted to do, but I wondered why I came to a place where I could use such a cramped nose. So when I go home, I'm still an antique.","My return home and sleep over night greatly rounded off my rugged temper over the tempura affair. I went to the school, and they were there also. I could not tell what was what. The three days thereafter were pacific, and on the night of the fourth day, I went to a suburb called Sumida and ate “dango” (small balls made of glutinous rice, dressed with sugar-paste). Sumida is a town where there are restaurants, hot-springs bath houses and a park, and in addition, the “tenderloin.” The dango shop where I went was near the entrance to the tenderloin, and as the dango served there was widely known for its nice taste, I dropped in on my way back from my bath. As I did not meet any students this time, I thought nobody knew of it, but when I entered the first hour class next day, I found written on the black board; “Two dishes of dango—7 sen.” It is true that I ate two dishes and paid seven sen. Troublesome kids! I declare. I expected with certainty that there would be something at the second hour, and there it was; “The dango in the tenderloin taste fine.” Stupid wretches! No sooner I thought, the dango incident closed than the red towel became the topic for widespread gossip. Inquiry as to the story revealed it to be something unusually absurd. Since, my arrival here, I had made it a part of my routine to take in the hot springs bath every day. While there was nothing in this town which compared favorably with Tokyo, the hot springs were worthy of praise. So long as I was in the town, I decided that I would have a dip every day, and went there walking, partly for physical exercise, before my supper. And whenever I went there I used to carry a large-size European towel dangling from my hand. Added to somewhat reddish color the towel had acquired by its having been soaked in the hot-springs, the red color on its border, which was not fast enough, streaked about so that the towel now looked as if it were dyed red. This towel hung down from my hand on both ways whether afoot or riding in the train. For this reason, the students nicknamed me Red Towel. Honest, it is exasperating to live in a little town. There is some more. The bath house I patronized was a newly built three-story house, and for the patrons of the first class the house provided a bath-robe, in addition to an attendant, and the cost was only eight sen. On top of that, a maid would serve tea in a regular polite fashion. I always paid the first class. Then those gossipy spotters started saying that for one who made only forty yen a month to take a first class bath every day was extravagant. Why the devil should they care? It was none of their business. There is still some more. The bath-tub,—or the tank in this case,—was built of granite, and measured about thirty square feet. Usually there were thirteen or fourteen people in the tank, but sometimes there was none. As the water came up clear to the breast, I enjoyed, for athletic purposes, swimming in the tank. I delighted in swimming in this 30-square feet tank, taking chances of the total absence of other people. Once, going downstairs from the third story with a light heart, and peeping through the entrance of the tank to see if I should be able to swim, I noticed a sign put up in which was boldly written: “No swimming allowed in the tank.” As there may not have been many who swam in the tank, this notice was probably put up particularly for my sake. After that I gave up swimming. But although I gave up swimming, I was surprised, when I went to the school, to see on the board, as usual, written: “No swimming allowed in the tank.” It seemed as if all the students united in tracking me everywhere. They made me sick. I was not a fellow to stop doing whatever I had started upon no matter what students might say, but I became thoroughly disgusted when I meditated on why I had come to such a narrow, suffocating place. And, then, when I returned home, the “antique curio siege” was still going on.","By the time I had gone home and had a good night’s sleep, I wasn’t feeling so worked up about the incident any more. The students were all sitting in their places that morning as if nothing had happened. It just didn’t make sense. Everything went smoothly enough for the next three days, but on the evening of the fourth day I went and had some dumplings in a place called Sumida. This was a hot-spring area, about ten minutes from town by train or thirty minutes on foot. Along with the inns, restaurants, and a park, there was also a red-light district there. I had heard about a shop at the edge of the red-light district that served very good dumplings, so on my way back from the bathhouse I decided to stop in and give them a try. This time there were no students around so I figured that nobody would hear about it, but when I went into my first class the next morning, there on the board was TWO PLATES OF DUMPLINGS, SEVEN SEN. In fact, I did have two plates and I did pay seven sen. What a pain these kids were! The second class, I was sure, would come up with something too, and so it did: DUMPLINGS IN THE RED-LIGHT DISTRICT – YUM YUM! It was simply beyond belief. That was the end of the dumplings, but before I knew it they’d found something else: my red towel. This one was really stupid. I had gotten into the habit of going for a daily bath in the hot spring at Sumida. Unlike everything else around there, which wasn’t even close to measuring up to what we had in Tokyo, this place was really first class. I figured that since it was so close by I might as well treat myself to a bath there every day, so before my dinner I would take a walk out to Sumida, which gave me some exercise into the bargain. On these walks I always carried a big bath towel. Now this towel took on a reddish tint from the water, and the dye from its red stripes began to run as well, so from a distance you might think it was solid red. Coming and going, on foot or by train, I always had that towel in my hand – and so, I heard, the students had taken to calling me Red Towel. Living in a little town where everybody knows everybody ’s business is no fun! And that wasn’t all. The baths were in a newly built three-story building. If you went in the First Class Bath they gave you a cotton bathrobe and an attendant would scrub your back for you, all for eight sen, and a girl would serve you a bowl of green tea on an elegant Chinese-style stand. I always went First Class. When the kids got wind of this, they spread the word that bathing First Class every day was extravagant for a teacher on a salary of forty yen – as if I needed that kind of advice! And that wasn’t all, either. The bath itself was a huge granite-lined tub, about fifteen feet by eighteen. Usually there would be a dozen or so people soaking in it, but sometimes I had it all to myself. The water was about chest-high, and it felt really nice to get a little exercise by taking a swim in it. I would keep an eye out for moments when the coast was clear, and then I’d have myself a great time splashing around. But then one day when I hurried down from the third floor to the bath, hoping that I’d be lucky enough to enjoy a good swim, there was a big sign with the warning SWIMMING IN THE BATH STRICTLY PROHIBITED in bold black lettering. There couldn’t have been many other people who swam in that bath, so they must have put up the sign just for me. I didn’t try to swim any more after that. But what really surprised me was that the next day at school, there on the board was the message SWIMMING IN THE BATH STRICTLY PROHIBITED. It seemed as if the whole student body was intent on keeping me under surveillance like a pack of detectives. It was downright depressing. No matter what they said about me it wasn’t going to make me stop doing what I wanted to do, but when I wondered what had made me come to such a petty, narrow-minded kind of place I felt completely disgusted. And then when I went back home I had to put up with the usual trial by antiques again."

そのうち学校もいやになった。ある日の晩大町と云う所を散歩していたら郵便局の隣りに蕎麦とかいて、下に東京と注を加えた看板があった。おれは蕎麦が大好きである。東京に居った時でも蕎麦屋の前を通って薬味の香いをかぐと、どうしても暖簾がくぐりたくなった。今日までは数学と骨董で蕎麦を忘れていたが、こうして看板を見ると素通りが出来なくなる。ついでだから一杯食って行こうと思って上がり込んだ。見ると看板ほどでもない。東京と断わる以上はもう少し奇麗にしそうなものだが、東京を知らないのか、金がないのか、滅法きたない。畳は色が変ってお負けに砂でざらざらしている。壁は煤で真黒だ。天井はランプの油烟で燻ぼってるのみか、低くって、思わず首を縮めるくらいだ。ただ麗々と蕎麦の名前をかいて張り付けたねだん付けだけは全く新しい。何でも古いうちを買って二三日前から開業したに違いなかろう。ねだん付の第一号に天麩羅とある。おい天麩羅を持ってこいと大きな声を出した。するとこの時まで隅の方に三人かたまって、何かつるつる、ちゅうちゅう食ってた連中が、ひとしくおれの方を見た。部屋が暗いので、ちょっと気がつかなかったが顔を合せると、みんな学校の生徒である。先方で挨拶をしたから、おれも挨拶をした。その晩は久し振に蕎麦を食ったので、旨かったから天麩羅を四杯平げた。,"Eventually I didn't like school. One night when I was taking a walk in a place called Omachi, there was a signboard next to the post office that said soba and added a note to Tokyo below. I love soba. Even when I was in Tokyo, when I passed in front of the soba shop and smelled the scent of condiments, I really wanted to go through the noren. Until today, I had forgotten soba in mathematics and antiques, but when I saw the signboard like this, I couldn't pass through. By the way, I decided to eat a drink and went up. Looking at it, it's not as good as a signboard. It seems to be a little more beautiful as long as I refuse to say Tokyo, but I don't know Tokyo or I don't have money. The color of the tatami mats has changed and it is rough with sand. The walls are soot and black. The ceiling is only smoked by the oil of the lamp, or it is so low that I can't help but squeeze my neck. However, the soba noodles with the name of soba are completely new. Everything must have been bought a few days ago and opened a few days ago. The first item with a nedan is tempura. He made a loud voice to bring the tempura. Then, until this time, three people gathered in the corner, and the people who were eating all the time looked at me. The room was dark, so I didn't notice it, but when I met them, they were all school students. I greeted him because he greeted me. I ate soba for a long time that night, so I ate four cups of tempura because it was delicious.","Shortly afterwards, I began to get sick of the school. One certain night, while I was strolling about a street named Omachi, I happened to notice a sign of noodles below of which was annotated “Tokyo” in the house next to the post office. I am very fond of noodles. While I was in Tokyo, if I passed by a noodle house and smelled the seasoning spices, I felt uncontrollable temptation to go inside at any cost. Up to this time I had forgotten the noodle on account of mathematics and antique curios, but since I had seen thus the sign of noodles, I could hardly pass it by unnoticed. So availing myself of this opportunity, I went in. It was not quite up to what I had judged by the sign. Since it claimed to follow the Tokyo style, they should have tidied up a little bit about the room. They did not either know Tokyo or have the means,—I did not know which, but the room was miserably dirty. The floor-mats had all seen better days and felt shaggy with sandy dust. The sootcovered walls defied the blackest black. The ceiling was not only smoked by the lamp black, but was so low as to force one involuntarily bend down his neck. Only the price-list, on which was glaringly written “Noodles” and which was pasted on the wall, was entirely new. I was certain that they bought an old house and opened the business just two or three days before. At the head of the price-list appeared “tempura” (noodles served with shrimp fried in batter). “Say, fetch me some tempura,” I ordered in a loud voice. Then three fellows who had been making a chewing noise together in a corner, looked in my direction. As the room was dark I did not notice them at first. But when we looked at each other, I found them all to be boys in our school. They “how d’ye do’d” me and I acknowledged it. That night, having come across the noodle after so long a time, it tasted so fine that I ate four bowls.","Before long school started to become a problem too. One evening while I was taking a stroll in a neighborhood called ōmachi, I saw a little shop next to the Post Office with a sign that said TOKYO BUCKWHEAT NOODLES. I love buckwheat noodles. When I was in Tokyo, just passing a noodle shop and getting a whiff of the spicy, simmering broth was enough to make me want to dash right in. Now, with my head stuffed with mathematics and antiques, I had forgotten all about noodles, but once I caught sight of that sign I just couldn’t pass it by, so I decided to go right in and have a bowl. As I looked around inside, I saw that the sign had gotten my hopes up in vain. Since it said TOKYO, you’d expect a slightly more decent-looking place; maybe they didn’t know what they were doing, or maybe they didn’t have the money to fix it up, but anyway it was horribly filthy. The floor mats had turned brown with age, and there was so much dirt rubbed into them that they had a scratchy feel. The walls were black with soot. The ceiling was stained with smoke from kerosene lamps and, even worse, it was so low that I found myself keeping my head down all the time without even thinking about it. The only thing that looked brand new was the price list hanging on the wall, with the names of the different dishes written out in a flowery hand. It looked as though they must have bought a dilapidated old building and just opened for business a couple of days ago. The first item on the list was tempura noodles. ‘Give me a bowl of the tempura,’ I shouted. As soon as I ordered, a group of three customers over in the corner, who up to that point had been slurping away at their own noodles, all turned to look at me. I hadn’t noticed before – it was so dark in there – but when our eyes met I realized that they were all students from the school. They all bowed by way of greeting, so I did the same. The noodles were good and it had been a long time since I’d had any, so I polished off four bowls, all with tempura."
分り過ぎて困るくらいだ。この容子じゃおれの天麩羅や団子の事も知ってるかも知れない。厄介な所だ。しかしお蔭様でマドンナの意味もわかるし、山嵐と赤シャツの関係もわかるし大いに後学になった。ただ困るのはどっちが悪る者だか判然しない。おれのような単純なものには白とか黒とか片づけてもらわないと、どっちへ味方をしていいか分らない。,"It's hard to understand. You may also know about my tempura and dumplings with this Yoko. It's a troublesome place. However, thanks to you, I could understand the meaning of Madonna, and I could understand the relationship between Yamaarashi and the red shirt, and I was able to learn a lot later. However, it is not clear which one is wrong. If you don't have a simple thing like me clean up with white or black, you won't know which side to take.","Yes, everything seems to be known more than one cares. Judging by her way, this woman probably knows about my tempura and dango affairs. Here was a pot that would make peas rattle! The meaning of the Madonna, the relations between Porcupine and Red Shirt became clear and helped me a deal. Only what puzzled me was the uncertainty as to which of the two was wrong. A fellow simple-hearted like me could not tell which side he should help unless the matter was presented in black and white.","She heard about too much, from my point of view. At this rate she might know all about my tempura and dumpling incidents, too. This was no easy place to live in, but it did have its advantages: now I knew who the Madonna was, and I understood the relationship between the Porcupine and Redshirt, which would certainly come in handy later on. The only thing was, I still couldn’t tell who the real bad guy was. Unless things are set out for me in clear black and white, it’s hard for a simple type like me to figure out which side to take."
汽船は夜六時の出帆である。山嵐もおれも疲れて、ぐうぐう寝込んで眼が覚めたら、午後二時であった。下女に巡査は来ないかと聞いたら参りませんと答えた。「赤シャツも野だも訴えなかったなあ」と二人は大きに笑った。,"The steamer sets sail at 6 pm. It was 2:00 pm when Yamastorm and I were tired and fell asleep and woke up. When I asked my maiden if a police officer would come, she answered that she wouldn't come. ""I didn't complain about the red shirt or the field,"" the two laughed loudly.","The steamer leaves the harbor at six in the evening. Porcupine and I, tired out, slept like logs, and when we awoke it was two o’clock. We asked the maid if the police had called on us, and she said no. Red Shirt and Clown had not taken it to the police, eh? We laughed.","The boat was scheduled to sail at six that evening. Both of us, dead tired, fell into a deep sleep. By the time we woke up, it was two o’clock. We asked the maid if the police had been around, but apparently they hadn’t. ‘ So Redshirt and the Hanger didn’t lodge a complaint after all,’ we said, and burst out laughing."

We would have to go a long way to find any blockhead to do a job in such a mountain village and get acquainted with monkeys for five yen extra.”","What a trick to play on somebody!

だんだん歩いて行くと、おれの方が早足だと見えて、二つの影法師が、次第に大きくなる。一人は女らしい。おれの足音を聞きつけて、十間ぐらいの距離に逼った時、男がたちまち振り向いた。月は後からさしている。その時おれは男の様子を見て、はてなと思った。男と女はまた元の通りにあるき出した。おれは考えがあるから、急に全速力で追っ懸けた。先方は何の気もつかずに最初の通り、ゆるゆる歩を移している。今は話し声も手に取るように聞える。土手の幅は六尺ぐらいだから、並んで行けば三人がようやくだ。おれは苦もなく後ろから追い付いて、男の袖を擦り抜けざま、二足前へ出した踵をぐるりと返して男の顔を覗き込んだ。月は正面からおれの五分刈の頭から顋の辺りまで、会釈もなく照す。男はあっと小声に云ったが、急に横を向いて、もう帰ろうと女を促がすが早いか、温泉の町の方へ引き返した。,"As I walked gradually, I seemed to be faster, and the two shadow masters gradually grew larger. One is feminine. When I heard my footsteps and stumbled at a distance of about ten, the man immediately turned around. The moon is coming later. At that time, I saw the man and thought it was Hatena. The man and the woman also started to be in their original way. I had an idea, so I suddenly chased at full speed. The other party is taking a slow step as the first street without noticing anything. Now I can hear you pick up your voice. The width of the bank is about 6 shaku, so if you go side by side, three people will finally come. I caught up from behind without difficulty, slipped through the man's sleeves, turned the heels that had come out two feet forward, and looked into the man's face. The moon illuminates from the front, from the head of my half-cut to the area around the sword, without a nod. The man whispered, but suddenly he turned to the side and urged the woman to go home, but he turned back to the hot spring town.","The two shadows became larger. One appeared like a woman. When I neared them within about sixty feet, the man, on hearing my footsteps, turned back. The moon was shining from behind me. I could see the manner of the man then and something queer struck me. They resumed their walk as before. And I chased them on a full speed. The other party, unconscious, walked slowly. I could now hear their voice distinctly. The levy was about six feet wide, and would allow only three abreast. I easily passed them, and turning back gazed squarely into the face of the man. The moon generously bathed my face with its beaming light. The fellow uttered a low “ah,” and suddenly turning sideway, said to the woman “Let’s go back.” They traced their way back toward the hot springs town.","I must have been walking faster than they were, and as I got closer the two shadows were gradually getting larger. One seemed to be a woman. As I came within about twenty yards of them, the man suddenly turned around. The moon was shining from behind me, so I could see his features pretty well. Ah-hah! The couple started walking again; I, with a certain plan in mind, followed after at full speed. Up ahead, the couple ambled along obliviously at the same leisurely pace they had kept up from the start. By now I could hear their voices so clearly I could almost reach out and touch them. The path along the riverbank was about six feet across, just barely wide enough for three people to walk abreast. I easily caught up with them, brushed past the man’s sleeve, and then, after pulling two paces ahead of them, turned on my heel and looked the man straight in the face. The moonlight, without so much as a by-your-leave, clearly revealed my entire face, from my short-cropped hair to the tip of my chin. The man barely had time to get out a sharp ‘Aa!’ of recognition in a tiny voice and then turn toward his companion and mumble ‘Let’s head back’ before the two of them were on their way back toward the hot spring area."

おれが組と組の間にはいって行くと、天麩羅だの、団子だの、と云う声が絶えずする。しかも大勢だから、誰が云うのだか分らない。よし分ってもおれの事を天麩羅と云ったんじゃありません、団子と申したのじゃありません、それは先生が神経衰弱だから、ひがんで、そう聞くんだぐらい云うに極まってる。こんな卑劣な根性は封建時代から、養成したこの土地の習慣なんだから、いくら云って聞かしたって、教えてやったって、到底直りっこない。こんな土地に一年も居ると、潔白なおれも、この真似をしなければならなく、なるかも知れない。向うでうまく言い抜けられるような手段で、おれの顔を汚すのを抛っておく、樗蒲一はない。向こうが人ならおれも人だ。生徒だって、子供だって、ずう体はおれより大きいや。だから刑罰として何か返報をしてやらなくっては義理がわるい。ところがこっちから返報をする時分に尋常の手段で行くと、向うから逆捩を食わして来る。貴様がわるいからだと云うと、初手から逃げ路が作ってある事だから滔々と弁じ立てる。弁じ立てておいて、自分の方を表向きだけ立派にしてそれからこっちの非を攻撃する。もともと返報にした事だから、こちらの弁護は向うの非が挙がらない上は弁護にならない。つまりは向うから手を出しておいて、世間体はこっちが仕掛けた喧嘩のように、見傚されてしまう。大変な不利益だ。それなら向うのやるなり、愚迂多良童子を極め込んでいれば、向うはますます増長するばかり、大きく云えば世の中のためにならない。そこで仕方がないから、こっちも向うの筆法を用いて捕まえられないで、手の付けようのない返報をしなくてはならなくなる。そうなっては江戸っ子も駄目だ。駄目だが一年もこうやられる以上は、おれも人間だから駄目でも何でもそうならなくっちゃ始末がつかない。どうしても早く東京へ帰って清といっしょになるに限る。こんな田舎に居るのは堕落しに来ているようなものだ。新聞配達をしたって、ここまで堕落するよりはましだ。,"As I stepped in between the groups, there were constant voices saying that they were tempura and dumplings. And because there are so many, I don't know who says it. Even if I understand it, I didn't call it tempura, I didn't call it dumplings, because the teacher was nervously weakened, so I was distorted and heard that. Such a sneaky gut is a custom of this land that has been cultivated since the feudal era, so no matter how much I asked, I couldn't fix it. If you stay in such a land for a year, even innocent people may have to imitate this. There is no such thing as swearing my face in a way that can be said well over there. If the other side is a person, I am also a person. Whether it's a student or a child, the body is bigger than me. Therefore, I have to give something back as a punishment. However, if you go by ordinary means at the time of returning from here, you will eat a reverse twist from the other side. If you say it's bad, it's because there is an escape route from the beginning, so I'll argue with all my might. Make an excuse, make yourself ostensibly good, and then attack this blame. Since it was originally a reply, this defense is not a defense as well as a blame for the other side. In other words, if you put your hand out from the other side, the world will be overlooked like a quarrel that I set up. It's a huge disadvantage. In that case, if you go to the other side and master the stupidity Tara Doji, the other side will only grow more and more, and in a big sense, it will not be good for the world. There is no choice but to catch it using the writing method over there, and I have to give an untouchable return. In that case, Edokko is no good. It's no good, but as long as I can do it for a year, I'm a human being, so even if it doesn't work, I have to do anything. Only by returning to Tokyo early and being with Qing. Being in such a country is like coming to the fall. Delivering newspapers is better than being so corrupt.","As I walked along between the sections, I could hear constantly the voices mentioning “tempura” or “dango.” And as there were so many of them, I could not tell which one mentioned it. Even if I succeeded in collaring the guilty one I was sure of his saying, “ No, I didn’t mean you in saying tempura or dango. I fear you suffer from nervousness and make wrong inferences.” This dastardly spirit has been fostered from the time of the feudal lords, and is deep-rooted. No amount of teaching or lecturing will cure it. If I stay in a town like this for one year or so, I may be compelled to follow their example, who knows,—clean and honest though I have been. I do not propose to make a fool of myself by remaining quiet when others attempt to play games on me, with all their excuses ready-made. They are men and so am I—students or kiddies or whatever they may be. They are bigger than I, and unless I get even with them by punishment, I would cut a sorry figure. But in the attempt to get even, if I resort to ordinary means, they are sure to make it a boomerang. If I tell them, “You’re wrong,” they will start an eloquent defence, because they are never short of the means of sidestepping. Having defended themselves, and made themselves appear suffering martyrs, they would begin attacking me. As the incident would have been started by my attempting to get even with them, my defence would not be a defence until I can prove their wrong. So the quarrel, which they had started, might be mistaken, after all, as one begun by me. But the more I keep silent the more they would become insolent, which, speaking seriously, could not be permitted for the sake of public morale. In consequence, I am obliged to adopt an identical policy so they cannot catch men in playing it back on them. If the situation comes to that, it would be the last day of the Yedo kid. Even so, if I am to be subjected to these pin-pricking[L] tricks, I am a man and got to risk losing off the last remnant of the honor of the Yedo kid. I became more convinced of the advisability of returning to Tokyo quickly and living with Kiyo. To live long in such a countrytown would be like degrading myself for a purpose. Newspaper delivering would be preferable to being degraded so far as that.","As I walked along between the class groups, I could hear comments about tempura this and dumplings that, over and over again. With so many kids, it was impossible to pick out the ones who were saying all this. Of course, even if I could, they would just claim that they hadn’t said anything of the kind, and that I was hearing things because I had a warped mind or was having a nervous breakdown or some other such nonsense. This vile attitude of theirs was an ingrained habit that had been nurtured in their region since feudal times, so no matter how hard you tried to persuade them or browbeat them, there was no cure for it. After a year in a place like this, even somebody untainted like me might find himself having to do as the locals do and end up the same way. There was no way that I was going to let anybody throw mud in my face and then get out of taking responsibility for it with some slick kind of dodge. Was I any less of a person than they were? Even if they were schoolboys, even if they were just kids, they were already bigger than I was. That being the case, it wouldn’t be right if I didn’t manage to make them pay with some kind of punishment. But if I tried to go after them by one of the usual methods, they were sure to come right back after me. If I told them that they’d done something wrong and were only getting what they deserved, they’d have their excuses all ready beforehand and eloquently proclaim their innocence. Not only that, they’d also manage to create the impression that they were actually the fine, upstanding ones and go on to attack me for having picked on them. Since my whole point was to exact some payback, there would be no point to it unless their misconduct was established. In other words, if they could attack me and then get everybody to believe that I was the one who had started the fight, they’d have me over a barrel. But then if I let them have their way and played the part of an easygoing, spineless chump, it would only make them that much bolder – or, to look at things on a grander scale, it wouldn’t help make the world a better place. So, basically, this meant that I had no choice but to adopt the tactics of my opponents and find a way to get retribution without being tripped up in the process. That would be the end for me as a self-respecting Edokko. But if I was going to have to put up with a year of this kind of treatment, well, I’m human too, so whether it meant throwing away my self-respect or whatever, that’s the way I’d have to do it if I was ever going to settle the score. The only way out of this mess was to go back to Tokyo and rejoin Kiyo right away. Staying on in a boondock like this was like pushing myself toward my own downfall. Even taking a job delivering newspapers would have to be better than that."
母が死んでから清はいよいよおれを可愛がった。時々は小供心になぜあんなに可愛がるのかと不審に思った。つまらない、廃せばいいのにと思った。気の毒だと思った。それでも清は可愛がる。折々は自分の小遣いで金鍔や紅梅焼を買ってくれる。寒い夜などはひそかに蕎麦粉を仕入れておいて、いつの間にか寝ている枕元へ蕎麦湯を持って来てくれる。時には鍋焼饂飩さえ買ってくれた。ただ食い物ばかりではない。靴足袋ももらった。鉛筆も貰った、帳面も貰った。これはずっと後の事であるが金を三円ばかり貸してくれた事さえある。何も貸せと云った訳ではない。向うで部屋へ持って来てお小遣いがなくてお困りでしょう、お使いなさいと云ってくれたんだ。おれは無論入らないと云ったが、是非使えと云うから、借りておいた。実は大変嬉しかった。その三円を蝦蟇口へ入れて、懐へ入れたなり便所へ行ったら、すぽりと後架の中へ落してしまった。仕方がないから、のそのそ出てきて実はこれこれだと清に話したところが、清は早速竹の棒を捜して来て、取って上げますと云った。しばらくすると井戸端でざあざあ音がするから、出てみたら竹の先へ蝦蟇口の紐を引き懸けたのを水で洗っていた。それから口をあけて壱円札を改めたら茶色になって模様が消えかかっていた。清は火鉢で乾かして、これでいいでしょうと出した。ちょっとかいでみて臭いやと云ったら、それじゃお出しなさい、取り換えて来て上げますからと、どこでどう胡魔化したか札の代りに銀貨を三円持って来た。この三円は何に使ったか忘れてしまった。今に返すよと云ったぎり、返さない。今となっては十倍にして返してやりたくても返せない。,"After my mother died, Qing finally loved me. Sometimes I wondered why I loved Koshin so much. It's boring, I thought it should be abolished. I feel sorry for you. Still, Qing is cute. From time to time, he buys Kintsuba and Koumei-yaki with his own pocket money. On cold nights, they secretly purchase buckwheat flour and bring the buckwheat hot water to the bedside where they are sleeping. Sometimes he even bought udon noodles. It's not just food. I also got a pair of socks. I got a pencil and a notebook. This was a long time ago, but he even lent me three yen. I didn't say to lend anything. He told me to bring it to the room over there and use it because I don't have any pocket money. Of course I said I wouldn't enter, but I borrowed it because I said it could be used. Actually, I was very happy. I put the three yen in the toad mouth, put it in my pocket, and went to the toilet, and then I dropped it into the back rack. I couldn't help it, so when I came out and told Kiyo that this was the case, Kiyo immediately searched for a bamboo stick and said that he would pick it up. After a while, there was a rustling noise at the end of the well, so when I got out, I was washing the string of the toad on the tip of the bamboo with water. Then I opened my mouth and changed the Ichiyen bill, and it turned brown and the pattern was about to disappear. Qing dried it in a brazier and said that it was okay. If you smell it for a moment, then give it out, I'll replace it, and I brought three yen of silver coins instead of a bill to find out where and how it was ridiculed. I forgot what I used these three yen for. As long as I say I'll return it now, I won't return it. Now I can't return it even if I want to return it ten times.","After my mother was dead, Kiyo loved me still more. In my simple reasoning, I wondered why she had taken such a fancy to me. Sometimes I thought it quite futile on her part, that she had better quit that sort of thing, which was bad for her. But she loved me just the same. Once in, a while she would buy, out of her own pocket, some cakes or sweetmeats for me. When the night was cold, she would secretly buy some noodle powder, and bring all unawares hot noodle gruel to my bed; or sometimes she would even buy a bowl of steaming noodles from the peddler. Not only with edibles, but she was generous alike with socks, pencils, note books, etc. And she even furnished me,—this happened some time later,—with about three yen , I did not ask her for the money; she offered it from her own good will by bringing it to my room, saying that I might be in need of some cash. This, of course, embarrassed me, but as she was so insistent I consented to borrow it. I confess I was really glad of the money. I put it in a bag, and carried it in my pocket. While about the house, I happened to drop the bag into a cesspool. Helpless, I told Kiyo how I had lost the money, and at once she fetched a bamboo stick, and said she will get it for me. After a while I heard a splashing sound of water about our family well, and going there, saw Kiyo washing the bag strung on the end of the stick. I opened the bag and found the edict of the three one-yen bills turned to faint yellow and designs fading. Kiyo dried them at an open fire and handed them over to me, asking if they were all right. I smelled them and said; “They stink yet.” “Give them to me; I’ll get them changed.” She took those three bills, and,—I do not know how she went about it,—brought three yen in silver. I forget now upon what I spent the three yen. “I’ll pay you back soon,” I said at the time, but didn’t. I could not now pay it back even if I wished to do so with ten times the amount.","Kiyo grew even fonder of me after my mother died. Sometimes in my child’s heart I wondered why. I didn’t appreciate it and wished she would put a stop to it. I thought it was pathetic. She kept right on spoiling me, though. Sometimes she would take her own spending money and buy me various kinds of sweets. On cold nights she’d slip out and buy some buckwheat flour and after I’d gone to bed she’d come in and leave a steaming bowl of gruel by my pillow. There were even times when she’d buy me a pot of hot noodle stew. And it wasn’t just food, either: socks, pencils, notebooks – I got all kinds of presents from her. Another time – this was much later – she even gave me three yen and told me it was a loan. It wasn’t as if I had asked her to lend me any money. She just brought it to my room and said that it must be hard for me without any spending money, so I should take it and use it to get something I wanted. I told her that I didn’t need it, of course, but she insisted that I should take it, so that’s what I did, and actually I was very glad to have it. I put the three one-yen bills in a purse, stuck it in my kimono – and then went off to the toilet, where I managed to drop it right down the hole. There was nothing I could do except come slinking back and explain to Kiyo what had happened. She immediately went and found a bamboo pole and told me that she’d fish it out for me. After a while I heard the sound of splashing water by the well, and when I went to see what was happening, there she was with the cord of my purse hanging from the tip of the pole, trying to rinse it off. When we opened it up, the bills were all faded and the paper was stained a brownish color. Kiyo dried them off over the hibachi and gave them back to me, saying that they should be all right now. I took a sniff. It was pretty bad, and I told her so. She said I should give them to her and she’d change them for me, and somehow or other she managed to get them exchanged for three silver one-yen coins. I can’t remember what it was that I bought with those coins. I told her that I’d pay her back soon, but I never did. Now I wish I could pay her back ten-fold, but it’s not possible any longer."
おれはこれでも山嵐に一銭五厘奮発させて、百万両より尊とい返礼をした気でいる。山嵐は難有いと思ってしかるべきだ。それに裏へ廻って卑劣な振舞をするとは怪しからん野郎だ。あした行って一銭五厘返してしまえば借りも貸しもない。そうしておいて喧嘩をしてやろう。,"Even with this, I feel that Yamaarashi has inspired me with a stake and a repayment that is more precious than a million cars. Yamastorm should be considered difficult. Besides, it is a suspicious bastard to go behind the scenes and behave sneaky. If you go tomorrow and return one coin, you will not be able to borrow or lend. Then let's have a quarrel.","I made Porcupine blow one sen and a half, and gave him my gratitude which is more costly than a million yen. He ought to have been thankful for that. And then what an outrageous fellow to plan a cowardly action behind my back! I will give him back that one sen and a half tomorrow, and all will be square. Then I will land him one.","And yet, I felt, here I had let the Porcupine spend that sen and a half on me, and in return I had let him have that thing more precious than a fortune in gold. He certainly should have felt grateful, but instead he was engaging in underhanded schemes behind my back – it was disgusting! Tomorrow I’d go and return the money to him, and then neither of us would owe the other a thing. Once that was settled, I’d be ready to take him on."
清の事を考えながら、のつそつしていると、突然おれの頭の上で、数で云ったら三四十人もあろうか、二階が落っこちるほどどん、どん、どんと拍子を取って床板を踏みならす音がした。すると足音に比例した大きな鬨の声が起った。おれは何事が持ち上がったのかと驚ろいて飛び起きた。飛び起きる途端に、ははあさっきの意趣返しに生徒があばれるのだなと気がついた。手前のわるい事は悪るかったと言ってしまわないうちは罪は消えないもんだ。わるい事は、手前達に覚があるだろう。本来なら寝てから後悔してあしたの朝でもあやまりに来るのが本筋だ。たとい、あやまらないまでも恐れ入って、静粛に寝ているべきだ。それを何だこの騒ぎは。寄宿舎を建てて豚でも飼っておきあしまいし。気狂いじみた真似も大抵にするがいい。どうするか見ろと、寝巻のまま宿直部屋を飛び出して、楷子段を三股半に二階まで躍り上がった。すると不思議な事に、今まで頭の上で、たしかにどたばた暴れていたのが、急に静まり返って、人声どころか足音もしなくなった。これは妙だ。ランプはすでに消してあるから、暗くてどこに何が居るか判然と分らないが、人気のあるとないとは様子でも知れる。長く東から西へ貫いた廊下には鼠一匹も隠れていない。廊下のはずれから月がさして、遥か向うが際どく明るい。どうも変だ、おれは小供の時から、よく夢を見る癖があって、夢中に跳ね起きて、わからぬ寝言を云って、人に笑われた事がよくある。十六七の時ダイヤモンドを拾った夢を見た晩なぞは、むくりと立ち上がって、そばに居た兄に、今のダイヤモンドはどうしたと、非常な勢で尋ねたくらいだ。その時は三日ばかりうち中の笑い草になって大いに弱った。ことによると今のも夢かも知れない。しかしたしかにあばれたに違いないがと、廊下の真中で考え込んでいると、月のさしている向うのはずれで、一二三わあと、三四十人の声がかたまって響いたかと思う間もなく、前のように拍子を取って、一同が床板を踏み鳴らした。それ見ろ夢じゃないやっぱり事実だ。静かにしろ、夜なかだぞ、とこっちも負けんくらいな声を出して、廊下を向うへ馳けだした。おれの通る路は暗い、ただはずれに見える月あかりが目標だ。おれが馳け出して二間も来たかと思うと、廊下の真中で、堅い大きなものに向脛をぶつけて、あ痛が頭へひびく間に、身体はすとんと前へ抛り出された。こん畜生と起き上がってみたが、馳けられない。気はせくが、足だけは云う事を利かない。じれったいから、一本足で飛んで来たら、もう足音も人声も静まり返って、森としている。いくら人間が卑怯だって、こんなに卑怯に出来るものじゃない。まるで豚だ。こうなれば隠れている奴を引きずり出して、あやまらせてやるまではひかないぞと、心を極めて寝室の一つを開けて中を検査しようと思ったが開かない。錠をかけてあるのか、机か何か積んで立て懸けてあるのか、押しても、押しても決して開かない。今度は向う合せの北側の室を試みた。開かない事はやっぱり同然である。おれが戸を開けて中に居る奴を引っ捕らまえてやろうと、焦慮てると、また東のはずれで鬨の声と足拍子が始まった。この野郎申し合せて、東西相応じておれを馬鹿にする気だな、とは思ったがさてどうしていいか分らない。正直に白状してしまうが、おれは勇気のある割合に智慧が足りない。こんな時にはどうしていいかさっぱりわからない。わからないけれども、決して負けるつもりはない。このままに済ましてはおれの顔にかかわる。江戸っ子は意気地がないと云われるのは残念だ。宿直をして鼻垂れ小僧にからかわれて、手のつけようがなくって、仕方がないから泣き寝入りにしたと思われちゃ一生の名折れだ。これでも元は旗本だ。旗本の元は清和源氏で、多田の満仲の後裔だ。こんな土百姓とは生まれからして違うんだ。ただ智慧のないところが惜しいだけだ。どうしていいか分らないのが困るだけだ。困ったって負けるものか。正直だから、どうしていいか分らないんだ。世の中に正直が勝たないで、外に勝つものがあるか、考えてみろ。今夜中に勝てなければ、あした勝つ。あした勝てなければ、あさって勝つ。あさって勝てなければ、下宿から弁当を取り寄せて勝つまでここに居る。おれはこう決心をしたから、廊下の真中へあぐらをかいて夜のあけるのを待っていた。蚊がぶんぶん来たけれども何ともなかった。さっき、ぶつけた向脛を撫でてみると、何だかぬらぬらする。血が出るんだろう。血なんか出たければ勝手に出るがいい。そのうち最前からの疲れが出て、ついうとうと寝てしまった。何だか騒がしいので、眼が覚めた時はえっ糞しまったと飛び上がった。おれの坐ってた右側にある戸が半分あいて、生徒が二人、おれの前に立っている。おれは正気に返って、はっと思う途端に、おれの鼻の先にある生徒の足を引っ攫んで、力任せにぐいと引いたら、そいつは、どたりと仰向に倒れた。ざまを見ろ。残る一人がちょっと狼狽したところを、飛びかかって、肩を抑えて二三度こづき廻したら、あっけに取られて、眼をぱちぱちさせた。さあおれの部屋まで来いと引っ立てると、弱虫だと見えて、一も二もなく尾いて来た。夜はとうにあけている。,"While thinking about the Qing dynasty, when I was screaming, suddenly on my head, maybe there were forty-four people in number, the second floor fell down, and the floorboards were beaten up and down. There was a trampling sound. Then, a loud battle cry was heard in proportion to the footsteps. I was surprised at what had happened and jumped up. As soon as I jumped up, I realized that the students were exposed to the recollection of Asahi. Sin will not go away until I say that the bad thing in the foreground was bad. The bad thing is that you will be aware of it. Normally, I regret after sleeping and come to the end even in the morning tomorrow. However, you should sleep quietly, even if you don't apologize. What is this fuss about it? I built a dormitory and kept pigs. You should usually do crazy imitations. Looking at what to do, I jumped out of the nightwear room with my nightwear and jumped up to the second floor in three and a half steps. Then, strangely, what had been fluttering on my head until now suddenly calmed down, and I couldn't even make a footstep, let alone a human voice. This is strange. The lamps have already been turned off, so it's dark and I don't know where they are, but it seems that they aren't popular. No mouse is hidden in the corridor that runs from east to west for a long time. The moon shines from the edge of the corridor, and it is far away but bright. It's weird, I've always had a habit of dreaming since I was a kid, and I often jumped up and laughed at people by saying unfamiliar sleep-talking. The night mystery that I had a dream of picking up a diamond at the time of sixteen stood up and asked my brother, who was by my side, what happened to the diamond now. At that time, I became a laughing grass in my house for about three days and was greatly weakened. Perhaps it's still a dream now. However, when I was thinking in the middle of the corridor that it must have been exposed, the moon was on the other side, and I couldn't help but think that the voices of the thirty-four people had struck in front of me. All of them stomped on the floorboards. Look at it, it's not a dream, it's a fact. Be quiet, it's midnight, and I screamed as if I was defeated, and headed for the corridor. The road I take is dark, but my goal is to see the moonlight on the edge. I wondered if I had come out for two minutes, and in the middle of the corridor, I hit my shin against a big, hard object, and while the pain hit my head, my body was pulled forward. .. I tried to get up with a brute, but I couldn't get it. I'm afraid, but I can't say anything about my legs. I want to get angry, so when I fly on one leg, the footsteps and human voices have calmed down, making it a forest. No matter how cowardly a human being is, it cannot be so cowardly. It's like a pig. If this happens, I'll pull out the hidden guy and I'll not pull it until I'm afraid, so I thought I'd open one of the bedrooms and inspect the inside, but it wouldn't open. Whether it's locked, a desk or something piled up, it never opens when pushed or pushed. This time I tried the room on the north side of the opposite side. After all it is almost the same as not opening. When I opened the door and tried to catch the guy inside, I was anxious, and the voice of the battle cry and the clapping began again on the eastern edge. I thought that I was going to make a fool of myself according to the eastern and western aspects, but I don't know what to do. To be honest, I confess, but I lack the wisdom to the extent that I have the courage. I have no idea what to do in such a case. I don't know, but I'm never going to lose. If you leave it as it is, it will affect my face. It is a pity that Edokko is said to be stubborn. It's a lifelong name to think that I fell asleep because I couldn't help it because I had to make a night shift and was teased by a kid with a drooping nose. Even this is originally Hatamoto. The origin of Hatamoto is Seiwa Genji, a descendant of Mitsunaka Tada. It's different from this kind of farmer since I was born. It's just regrettable that there is no wisdom. I just don't know what to do. Do you lose if you are in trouble? To be honest, I don't know what to do. Think about whether there is something in the world that can be won outside without being honest. If you can't win tonight, you'll win tomorrow. If you can't win tomorrow, you'll win tomorrow. If you can't win, you'll stay here until you win by ordering a bento from your boarding house. I made this decision, so I was cross-legged in the middle of the corridor and waited for the night to dawn. A lot of mosquitoes came, but nothing happened. When I stroked the shin that I hit earlier, it got wet. Blood will come out. If you want to get some blood, you should get it. Eventually, I got tired from the very front and finally fell asleep. It was kind of noisy, so when I woke up, I jumped up saying that I had pooped. The door on the right side where I was sitting is half open, and two students are standing in front of me. As soon as I got back to my senses, I pulled the student's leg at the tip of my nose and pulled it with force, and he fell on his back. Look at Zama. When the remaining one was a little upset, he jumped, held his shoulders down, and stumbled around a couple of times. When I came to my room, I pulled it out, and it looked like a sissy, and it came after me without a second. The night is finally open.","While I was thus meditating about Kiyo, all of a sudden, on the floor above my head, about thirty to forty people, if I guess by the number, started stamping the floor with bang, bang, bang that well threatened to bang down the floor. This was followed by proportionately loud whoops. The noise surprised me, and I popped up. The moment I got up I became aware that the students were starting a rough house to get even with me. What wrong one has committed, he has to confess, or his offence is never atoned for. They are just to ask for themselves what crimes they have done. It should be proper that they repent their folly after going to bed and to come and beg me pardon the next morning. Even if they could not go so far as to apologize they should have kept quiet. Then what does this racket mean? Where we keeping hogs in our dormitory? “This crazy thing got to stop. See what you get!” I ran out of the room in my night shirt, and flew upstairs in three and half steps. Then, strange to say, thunderous rumbling, of which I was sure of hearing in the act, was hushed. Not only a whisper but even footsteps were not heard. This was funny. The lamp was already blown out and although I could not see what was what in the dark , nevertheless could tell by instinct whether there was somebody around or not. In the long corridor running from the east to the west, there was not hiding even a mouse. From other end of the corridor the moonlight flooded in and about there it was particularly light. The scene was somewhat uncanny. I have had the habit from my boyhood of frequently dreaming and of flying out of bed and of muttering things which nobody understood, affording everybody a hearty laugh. One night, when I was sixteen or seventeen, I dreamed that I picked up a diamond, and getting up, demanded of my brother who was sleeping close to me what he had done with that diamond. The demand was made with such force that for about three days all in the house chaffed me about the fatal loss of precious stone, much to my humiliation. Maybe this noise which I heard was but a dream, although I was sure it was real. I was wondering thus in the middle of the corridor, when at the further end where it was moonlit, a roar was raised, coming from about thirty or forty throats, “One, two, three,—Whee-ee!” The roar had hardly subsided, when, as before, the stamping of the floor commenced with furious rhythm. Ah, it was not a dream, but a real thing! “Quit making the noise! ’ Tis midnight!” I shouted to beat the band, and started in their direction. My passage was dark; the moonlight yonder was only my guide. About twelve feet past, I stumbled squarely against some hard object; ere the “Ouch!” has passed clear up to my head, I was thrown down. I called all kinds of gods, but could not run. My mind urged me on to hurry up, but my leg would not obey the command. Growing impatient, I hobbled on one foot, and found both voice and stamping already ceased and perfectly quiet. Men can be cowards but I never expected them capable of becoming such dastardly cowards as this. They challenged hogs. Now the situation having developed to this pretty mess, I would not give it up until I had dragged them out from hiding and forced them to apologize. With this determination, I tried to open one of the doors and examine inside, but it would not open. It was locked or held fast with a pile of tables or something; to my persistent efforts the door stood unyielding. Then I tried one across the corridor on the northside, but it was also locked. While this irritating attempt at door-opening was going on, again on the east end of the corridor the whooping roar and rhythmic stamping of feet were heard. The fools at both ends were bent on making a goose of me. I realized this, but then I was at a loss what to do. I frankly confess that I have not quite as much tact as dashing spirit. In such a case I am wholly at the mercy of swaying circumstances without my own way of getting through it. Nevertheless, I do not expect to play the part of underdog. If I dropped the affair then and there, it would reflect upon my dignity. It would be mortifying to have them think that they had one on the Tokyo-kid and that Tokyo-kid was wanting in tenacity. To have it on record that I had been guyed by these insignificant spawn when on night watch, and had to give in to their impudence because I could not handle them,—this would be an indelible disgrace on my life. Mark ye,—I am descendant of a samurai of the “hatamato” class. The blood of the “hatamoto” samurai could be traced to Mitsunaka Tada, who in turn could claim still a nobler ancestor. I am different from, and nobler than, these manure-smelling louts. The only pity is that I am rather short of tact; that I do not know what to do in such a case. That is the trouble. But I would not throw up the sponge; not on your life! I only do not know how because I am honest. Just think,—if the honest does not win, what else is there in this world that will win? If I cannot beat them to-night, I will tomorrow; if not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. If not the day after tomorrow, I will sit down right here, get my meals from my home until I beat them. Thus resolved, I squatted in the middle of the corridor and waited for the dawn. Myriads of mosquitoes swarmed about me, but I did not mind them. I felt my leg where I hit it a while ago; it seemed bespattered with something greasy. I thought it was bleeding. Let it bleed all it cares! Meanwhile, exhausted by these unwonted affairs, I fell asleep. When I awoke, up I jumped with a curse. The door on my right was half opened, and two students were standing in front of me. The moment I recovered my senses from the drowsy lull, I grabbed a leg of one of them nearest to me, and yanked it with all my might. He fell down prone. Look at what you’re getting now! I flew at the other fellow, who was much confused; gave him vigorous shaking twice or thrice, and he only kept open his bewildering eyes. “Come up to my room.” Evidently they were mollycoddles, for they obeyed my command without a murmur. The day had become already clear.","As I lay there tossing and turning with these thoughts of Kiyo running through my mind, all of a sudden I heard the sound of what must have been thirty or forty pairs of feet pounding steadily on the wooden floor directly above my head, so hard that it seemed like the ceiling might come crashing down on me any minute. Then they started yelling at a volume that matched the stamping. I bolted out of bed again, wondering what could possibly be going on. As soon as I was up I realized it had to be the students, trying to get back at me … You guys, I thought to myself … Until you acknowledge that what you did was wrong, you’re still guilty in my eyes. You must have realized it was wrong. The decent thing to do would be to go back to your beds and think it over and, once you’ve had some second thoughts, come and apologize in the morning. Or even if you couldn’t bring yourselves to do that, the least you could do would be to feel a little ashamed of yourselves and go to sleep quietly. And instead you go in for more mayhem? Don’t you know that this is supposed to be a dormitory, not a pigpen? You’d better cut back on these crazy stunts. Just you wait … I dashed out of my room, still in my night robe, and bounded up the stairway to the second floor. To my amazement the racket that had been erupting just above my head had suddenly turned into absolute silence; not a hint of those screaming voices, let alone pounding feet. Very strange! The lamps were already out so it was too dark to see anything clearly, but I could sense that some of them were lurking here and there. But there was nobody, not even a mouse, in the hallway that ran the length of the dormitory from east to west. Down at the far end there was a bright patch where the moon was shining in. Definitely strange, like the times years ago when I used to have all kinds of dreams and then wake up with a jolt and start babbling a stream of nonsense. I used to get laughed at a lot for that. Once when I was sixteen or seventeen I even had this dream about finding a diamond and I sprang out of bed and furiously asked my brother, who was lying next to me, where my diamond was. The whole household wouldn’t stop laughing at me for three days, which was very hard to take. For all I knew, what was happening now might be a dream, too. But I had heard them carrying on … As I stood there sunk in my thoughts, the silence was suddenly shattered by dozens of voices screaming ‘One, two, three … YAAAAAHHH!!!’ from down at the end of the corridor where the moon was shining in so brightly, followed in no time by the same rhythmic stomping of feet on the wooden floor that I’d heard before. So it hadn’t been a dream after all. ‘QUIET!! It’s the middle of the night!!’ I roared in a voice loud enough to make myself heard over the racket, and I started to run down toward the far end of the hallway. Since it was dark all around me, all I could do was head for that patch of moonlight at the end. I had only gone a couple of yards when my shins banged into something hard right in the middle of the corridor, and before I could even hear myself yelling ‘OW!!’ I was dropping to the floor with a resounding crash. Damn them, I thought as I pulled myself back up, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t run any more; my leg just refused to do what it was told. Seething, I hopped down to the end on my good foot, but by then the stomping and the shouting had turned to silence again and everything was still. No matter how low human beings sink, it’s not possible for them to sink this low. These kids really were more like pigs than humans. If this is the way they want it, I decided, I wasn’t going to leave until I had dragged them out of their hiding places and made them apologize, no matter how long it took, but when I tried to push open the door to get into one of their rooms it wouldn’t budge. I couldn’t tell whether they had locked it or shoved some desks or other furniture against it; either way, I couldn’t get it to open however hard I pushed. I tried the door across the corridor. It didn’t budge any more than the first one did. While I furiously kept trying to push my way into the room and grab one of the kids, the jeering and stomping started up all over again at the other end of the hallway. Finally I realized what was going on: the little devils had it all planned out so they could give it to me from both sides. But what could I do about it? I’ll have to admit it: I may have courage, but I don’t have the brains to match. When I get myself into this kind of fix, I’m totally at a loss. But even if I’m at a loss, I’ll be damned if I’m going to be a loser. To give up at this point would have been a disgrace. It would have been awful to let them have an excuse for claiming that Tokyo people have no guts. If people were to hear that I allowed this pack of snot-nosed brats to make a fool out of me while I was on duty and simply slunk back to my room because I couldn’t handle them, I would never live it down. Whatever faults I may have, my ancestors were retainers of the Shogun, a line of warriors going back to the Emperor Seiwa and descended from the great Minamoto no Mitsunaka. I’m not made of the same stuff as those peasants were, of that you can be sure. If only I could think of something! If only there was some way out of this mess! Anyhow, I wasn’t about to give in. Being honest, I couldn’t see a way out. But after all, if you can’t win with honesty, what else is there? All right, I decided, if I couldn’t win tonight, I’d win tomorrow. If I couldn’t win tomorrow, I’d win the day after. And if I couldn’t win the day after, I’d just have my meals delivered from home and stay right where I was until I did win. I sat myself down right in the middle of the corridor, ready to wait there until the morning. The mosquitoes were buzzing all around me, but I didn’t care. When I rubbed the spot on my shin I had banged before, I could feel something wet and sticky. It must have been bleeding. Fine, let it bleed if it wanted to. Finally fatigue started to catch up with me and I fell asleep. But then my sleep was broken off by some kind of commotion, and I pulled myself up with a curse. The door to my right was half open, and two boys were standing there in front of me. As soon as I’d come to my senses I grabbed one of the legs of the kid closest to me and jerked it toward me as hard as I could. He came crashing down flat on his back. That’ll show you! Then I jumped the other one, who was still just standing there in a kind of daze, grabbed him by the shoulders, and gave him a good shaking up. He was so stunned that all he could do was keep standing there and blinking his eyes. When I said ‘All right, you two, come with me,’ and bundled them off to my room, they both came along meekly, like the sissies I took them for. By this time morning had already broken."
そのうち燗徳利が頻繁に往来し始めたら、四方が急に賑やかになった。野だ公は恭しく校長の前へ出て盃を頂いてる。いやな奴だ。うらなり君は順々に献酬をして、一巡周るつもりとみえる。はなはだご苦労である。うらなり君がおれの前へ来て、一つ頂戴致しましょうと袴のひだを正して申し込まれたから、おれも窮屈にズボンのままかしこまって、一盃差し上げた。せっかく参って、すぐお別れになるのは残念ですね。ご出立はいつです、是非浜までお見送りをしましょうと云ったら、うらなり君はいえご用多のところ決してそれには及びませんと答えた。うらなり君が何と云ったって、おれは学校を休んで送る気でいる。,"When Kanzake tokkuri began to come and go frequently, all sides suddenly became lively. Noda is reluctant to go out in front of the principal and get a cup. I don't like him. It seems that you are going to make a round of laps by making donations one after another. It's hard work. Uranari came in front of me and asked me to correct the folds of the hakama, so I cramped my pants and gave him a cup. It's a pity that we'll come and say goodbye soon. When did you leave, and when you asked me to see you off to the beach, Uranari replied that it wasn't the case, even though it was a lot of work. Whatever you say, I'm willing to take a break from school.","Meanwhile the bottles began passing round, and all became more or less “jacked up.” Clown proceeded to the front of the principal and submissively drank to his health. A beastly fellow, this! Hubbard Squash made a round of all the guests, drinking to their health. A very onerous job, indeed. When he came to me and proposed my health, I abandoned the squatting posture and sat up straight. “Too bad to see you go away so soon. When are you going? I want to see you off at the beach,” I said. “Thank you, Sir. But never mind that. You’re busy,” he declined. He might decline, but I was determined to get excused for the day and give him a rousing send-off.","In due course flasks of heated saké started to be passed around one after another, and all over the room the mood promptly took on a livelier tone. The Hanger-on made straight for the Principal’s seat and reverentially accepted a drink from him. What a creep! The Squash went from one guest to the next and exchanged drinks with each of them; apparently he was intending to make his way around the entire room. This was really above and beyond the call of duty. When he came to my place he politely straightened out the pleats of his formal kimono skirt and requested the honor of sharing a cup with me. Painfully I folded my trousered legs into a formal seated position and poured. ‘ What a shame,’ I said, ‘that we have to say goodbye so soon after I’ve arrived. When do you leave? I hope you won’t mind if I go down to the harbor to see you off.’ The Squash answered that I shouldn’t bother, since I was undoubtedly very busy. Regardless of what he said, though, I was determined to take time off from school and go see him off."

赤シャツに勧められて釣に行った帰りから、山嵐を疑ぐり出した。無い事を種に下宿を出ろと云われた時は、いよいよ不埒な奴だと思った。ところが会議の席では案に相違して滔々と生徒厳罰論を述べたから、おや変だなと首を捩った。萩野の婆さんから、山嵐が、うらなり君のために赤シャツと談判をしたと聞いた時は、それは感心だと手を拍った。この様子ではわる者は山嵐じゃあるまい、赤シャツの方が曲ってるんで、好加減な邪推を実しやかに、しかも遠廻しに、おれの頭の中へ浸み込ましたのではあるまいかと迷ってる矢先へ、野芹川の土手で、マドンナを連れて散歩なんかしている姿を見たから、それ以来赤シャツは曲者だと極めてしまった。曲者だか何だかよくは分らないが、ともかくも善い男じゃない。表と裏とは違った男だ。人間は竹のように真直でなくっちゃ頼もしくない。真直なものは喧嘩をしても心持ちがいい。赤シャツのようなやさしいのと、親切なのと、高尚なのと、琥珀のパイプとを自慢そうに見せびらかすのは油断が出来ない、めったに喧嘩も出来ないと思った。喧嘩をしても、回向院の相撲のような心持ちのいい喧嘩は出来ないと思った。そうなると一銭五厘の出入で控所全体を驚ろかした議論の相手の山嵐の方がはるかに人間らしい。会議の時に金壺眼をぐりつかせて、おれを睨めた時は憎い奴だと思ったが、あとで考えると、それも赤シャツのねちねちした猫撫声よりはましだ。実はあの会議が済んだあとで、よっぽど仲直りをしようかと思って、一こと二こと話しかけてみたが、野郎返事もしないで、まだ眼を剝ってみせたから、こっちも腹が立ってそのままにしておいた。,"After going fishing after being recommended by a red shirt, I suspected a mountain storm. When I was told to leave the boarding house because of something that wasn't there, I finally thought he was an unscrupulous guy. However, at the meeting, he made a strict punishment for the students, which was different from the plan, so he twisted his head. When I heard from Hagino's grandmother that Yamaarashi had a conversation with a red shirt for Uranari, he clapping his hands to be impressed. In this situation, the person who is wrong is not Yamaarashi, the red shirt is bent, so it is not that he sneaked into my head in a detour, in a sloppy manner. When I was wondering, I saw him taking a walk with Madonna on the bank of the Noseri River, and since then I have become extremely confident that the red shirt is a songwriter. I'm not sure if it's a songwriter, but he's not a good man anyway. A man who is different from the front and back. Humans are not reliable unless they are as straight as bamboo. Straight things are good even if you have a fight. I couldn't be alert to show off the kindness, kindness, nobility, and amber pipes like a red shirt, and I thought I could rarely quarrel. Even if I had a quarrel, I thought that I couldn't have a quarrel like the sumo wrestling of Ekoin. In that case, Yamaarashi, the other party of the discussion, who surprised the entire waiting room with the comings and goings of one coin, seems to be far more human. When I glared at me at the meeting, I thought I was a hateful guy, but when I think about it later, it's better than the snarling cat in a red shirt. Actually, after that meeting was over, I thought I'd make up for it, so I talked to him a couple of times, but he didn't reply and he still showed his eyes, so I got angry and left it as it was. Oita.","On my way back from the fishing to which I was invited by Red Shirt, and since then, I began to suspect Porcupine. When the latter wanted me to get out of Ikagin’s house on sham pretexts , I regarded him a decidedly unpleasant fellow. But as Porcupine, at the teachers’ meeting, contrary to my expectation, stood firmly for punishing the students to the fullest extent of the school regulations, I thought it queer. When I heard from the old lady about Porcupine volunteering himself for the sake of Hubbard Squash to stop Red Shirt meddling with the Madonna, I clapped my hands and hoorayed for him. Judging by these facts, I began to wonder if the wrong-doer might be not Porcupine, but Red Shirt the crooked one. He instilled into my head some flimsy hearsay plausibly and in a roundabout-way. At this juncture I saw Red Shirt taking a walk with the Madonna on the levy of the Nozeri river, and I decided that Red Shirt may be a scoundrel. I am not sure of his being really scoundrel at heart, but at any rate he is not a good fellow. He is a fellow with a double face. A man deserves no confidence unless he is as straight as the bamboo. One may fight a straight fellow, and feel satisfied. We cannot lose sight of the fact that Red Shirt or his kind who is kind, gentle, refined, and takes pride in his pipe had to be looked sharp, for I could not be too careful in getting into a scrap with the fellow of this type. I may fight, but I would not get square games like the wrestling matches it the Wrestling Amphitheatre in Tokyo. Come to think of it, Porcupine who turned against me and startled the whole teachers’ room over the amount of one sen and a half is far more like a man. When he stared at me with owlish eyes at the teachers’ meeting, I branded him as a spiteful guy, but as I consider the matter now, he is better than the feline voice of Red Shirt. To tell the truth, I tried to get reconciled with Porcupine, and after the meeting, spoke a word or two to him, but he shut up like a clam and kept glaring at me. So I became sore, and let it go at that.","Ever since that fishing trip with Redshirt, I had begun to have my suspicions about the Porcupine. When he had ordered me to get out of Ikagin’s on some phony pretext, it only confirmed my belief that he was up to no good. But then at the meeting when he made that eloquent appeal to be strict with the students, he caught me off guard again and I didn’t know what to think. And then when I heard from Mrs Hagino that he had tried to intervene on the Squash’s behalf with Redshirt , I felt I really had to hand it to him. Just as I was starting to wonder if maybe the Porcupine wasn’t the real bad guy after all, if maybe Redshirt was the rogue who had been planting a pack of plausible-sounding but unfounded suspicions and insinuations in my mind, there I was catching him taking the Madonna out for a walk along the Nozeri River. From that point on my mind was made up: Redshirt had to be the bad guy. Actually, I still wasn’t quite sure if he was a bad guy or not, but you certainly couldn’t call him a good one. Two-faced was what he was. If a man isn’t as upright as a stalk of bamboo, you can’t trust him. Even if you get into a fight with an upright man, you’ll still have a good feeling about it. A guy like Redshirt – the mild-mannered, kindly, elegant type, always proudly showing off that amber pipe of his – that’s the kind you’d better not trust, I believed, and also the kind you’d better not get into a fight with. And if by any chance you did get into a fight with him, it wouldn’t be one you could feel good about, the way you could with a match in the sumo tournament back in Tokyo. Looking at it this way, the Porcupine – the guy with whom I’d gotten into that argument over a penny and a half that had the whole faculty room in an uproar – was more of a man by far. When he kept glaring at me with those deep-set eyes of his during the staff meeting I detested him, but afterward I realized that at least it was better than dealing with a smooth, slimy-voiced customer like Redshirt. In fact, after the meeting I had tried to make up with him once or twice, but the rascal wouldn’t take me up on it; he just kept giving me that evil eye of his, so I got angry at him all over again and the standoff dragged on. Ever since then the Porcupine wouldn’t talk to me."

According to what you say, it seems as if you believe what the old woman in the boarding house tells you, but would not believe what your head teacher tells you. Am I right to understand it that way?”","‘Pardon me for saying so, but something is a bit out of order here.

しばらくしたら、めいめい胴間声を出して何か唄い始めた。おれの前へ来た一人の芸者が、あんた、なんぞ、唄いなはれ、と三味線を抱えたから、おれは唄わない、貴様唄ってみろと云ったら、金や太鼓でねえ、迷子の迷子の三太郎と、どんどこ、どんのちゃんちきりん。叩いて廻って逢われるものならば、わたしなんぞも、金や太鼓でどんどこ、どんのちゃんちきりんと叩いて廻って逢いたい人がある、と二た息にうたって、おおしんどと云った。おおしんどなら、もっと楽なものをやればいいのに。,"After a while, I started singing something with a loud voice. One geisha who came in front of me was holding a shamisen, singing, singing, so I wouldn't sing. And where and where, Don's Chan Chikirin. If it's something that you can hit and meet, I'm gonna say that there are people who want to hit and meet with gold and drums, and don't you think? .. I wish I could do something easier if I was a kid.","After a while, they began singing ditties in outlandish voices. One of the geishas came in front of me, and taking up a samisen, asked me to sing something. I told her I didn’t sing, but I’d like to hear, and she droned out: “If one can go round and meet the one he wants, banging gongs and drums …… bang, bang, bang, bang, bing, shouting after wandering Santaro, there is some one I’d like to meet by banging round gongs and drums …… bang, bang, bang, bang, b-i-n-g.” She dashed this off in two breaths, and sighed, “O, dear!” She should have sung something easier.","Eventually the rest of them started singing something or other in sloppy, raucous voices. One of the geisha came over to me with her shamisen at the ready and said ‘You there, come on, give us a song,’ but when I told her that I didn’t sing and that she could sing something herself instead, she treated us to a ballad: Beating a drum and banging a gong With a chanchikirin and a dondokodon We’ll go out looking for the little lost boy. And if you find the boy for you Beating a drum and banging a gong Well there’s someone I want to look for too With a chanchikirin and a dondokodon … Somehow she managed to get through all this on just two breaths, and then said ‘Whew, I’m all worn out.’ Too bad she didn’t try something easier if this was going to wear her out."

「時間が減って、もっと働くんですか、妙だな」,"""Is it strange that I have less time to work more?""",“The working hours shortened and yet work more?,"‘I’d be working more, but teaching less?"
おれは新聞を丸めて庭へ抛げつけたが、それでもまだ気に入らなかったから、わざわざ後架へ持って行って棄てて来た。新聞なんて無暗な噓を吐くもんだ。世の中に何が一番法螺を吹くと云って、新聞ほどの法螺吹きはあるまい。おれの云ってしかるべき事をみんな向うで並べていやがる。それに近頃東京から赴任した生意気な某とは何だ。天下に某と云う名前の人があるか。考えてみろ。これでもれっきとした姓もあり名もあるんだ。系図が見たけりゃ、多田満仲以来の先祖を一人残らず拝ましてやらあ。――顔を洗ったら、頰ぺたが急に痛くなった。婆さんに鏡をかせと云ったら、けさの新聞をお見たかなもしと聞く。読んで後架へ棄てて来た。欲しけりゃ拾って来いと云ったら、驚いて引き下がった。鏡で顔を見ると昨日と同じように傷がついている。これでも大事な顔だ、顔へ傷まで付けられた上へ生意気なる某などと、某呼ばわりをされればたくさんだ。,"I rolled up the newspaper and rushed it into the yard, but I still didn't like it, so I took the trouble to take it to the back rack and throw it away. Newspapers spit out a dark lie. There is no such thing as a newspaper that blows the conch shell the most in the world. I'm going to line up all the right things on the other side. What is a cheeky person who recently moved from Tokyo? Is there a person in the world with a certain name? Think about it. Even with this, there is a decent surname and a first name. If you can see the genealogy, worship all the ancestors since Mitsunaka Tada. ――When I washed my face, my cheeks suddenly hurt. When I asked my grandmother to put a mirror on me, I heard that she had seen the Keisa newspaper. I read it and threw it away to the back rack. When I asked him to pick it up if he wanted it, he was surprised and withdrew. Looking at my face in the mirror, it's just as scratched as yesterday. Even this is an important face, and there are many if you call it a certain person who has scratches on his face and is cheeky.","I rolled up the newspaper and threw it into the garden. Not satisfied, I took that paper to the cesspool and dumped it there. Newspapers tell such reckless lies. There is nothing so adept, I believe, as the newspaper in circulating lies. It has said what I should have said. And what does it mean by “one saucy Somebody who is recently from Tokyo?” Is there any one in this wide world with the name of Somebody? Don’t forget, I have a family and personal name of my own which I am proud of. If they want to look at my family-record, they will bow before every one of my ancestors from Mitsunaka Tada down. Having washed my face, my cheek began suddenly smarting. I asked the old lady for a mirror, and she asked if I had read the paper of this morning. “Yes,” I said, “and dumped it in the cesspool; go and pick it up if you want it,”—and she withdrew with a startled look. Looking in the mirror, I saw bruises on my cheek. Mine is a precious face to me. I get my face bruised, and am called a saucy Somebody as if I were nobody. That is enough.","I crumpled the newspaper into a ball and flung it out into the garden. I still felt so furious, though, that I went out and picked it up again and then stuffed it down the toilet. Newspapers print all kinds of outrageous lies. If you’ve ever wondered where to find the biggest blowhards in the world, well, a newspaper is the place. Here they were giving people their version of a story that I should have been giving myself. And then to call me ‘a certain impertinent party who had recently been hired from Tokyo’ – who the hell did they think they were? Is there anybody in the world who goes by the name of ‘a certain party,’ impertinent or otherwise? Use your head – no matter what else you could say about me , at least I have a perfectly good name, and if you want to see it, I’ll be glad to show you my complete family tree, going all the way back to Minamoto no Mitsunaka … As I was washing my face, I suddenly felt a pain in my cheek. I asked the landlady to lend me a mirror, and when she brought it, she asked if I had read the paper yet. I told her that I had, and then I’d stuffed it down the toilet, so if she wanted it she’d have to fish it out herself. Astonished, she walked off. When I looked at my face in the mirror, the bruises from last night were still there. No matter what else you could say about my face, it matters a lot to me; to end up with that face covered in bruises and on top of that to be reduced to the level of a nameless ‘certain impertinent party’ – it was all too much."
もう帰ろうかと赤シャツが思い出したように云うと、ええちょうど時分ですね。今夜はマドンナの君にお逢いですかと野だが云う。赤シャツは馬鹿あ云っちゃいけない、間違いになると、船縁に身を倚たした奴を、少し起き直る。エヘヘヘヘ大丈夫ですよ。聞いたって……と野だが振り返った時、おれは皿のような眼を野だの頭の上へまともに浴びせ掛けてやった。野だはまぼしそうに引っ繰り返って、や、こいつは降参だと首を縮めて、頭を搔いた。何という猪口才だろう。,"As the red shirt remembered when I was about to go home, it was just hours. I'm wondering if I'll meet Madonna tonight. Don't be stupid about red shirts, and if you make a mistake, you'll get up a little bit of the guy who's on the side of the ship. Ehehehehe It's okay. When I looked back, I shook my dish-like eyes straight over the field's head. The field turned around, and he shook his head and shook his head, saying that he was surrendering. What a talented choko!","“Well, let’s be going,” said Red Shirt suddenly. “Yes, this is the time we were going. See your Madonna to-night?” responded Clown. “Cut out nonsense …… might mean a serious trouble,” said Red Shirt who was reclining against the edge of the boat, now raising himself. “O, that’s all right if he hears…….,” and when Clown, so saying, turned himself my way , I glared squarely in his face. Clown turned back as if to keep away from a dazzling light, and with “Ha, this is going some,” shrugged his shoulders and scratched his head.","‘Well, shall we head back?’ Redshirt asked, as if he’d just thought of something. The Hanger said yes, it’s the perfect time, isn’t it, and then asked Redshirt if he was planning to pay a call on Mademoiselle Madonna that evening. Redshirt, who had been leaning casually against the side of the boat, said ‘Don’t say anything foolish, there could be trouble, you know,’ and pulled himself up a little. ‘ Hee hee, don’t worry,’ the Hanger replied, ‘even if he did hear … ’ When he quickly turned to look at me, I gave him my best if-looks-could-kill glare, my eyes as big as saucers. ‘ Uh-oh, that ’s too much for me!’ he murmured, looking for all the world as if he was blinded by my gaze, and scratched his head as he tried to pull it in between his hunched-up shoulders. What a charlatan!"
四,four,CHAPTER IV,4
おれは外の言葉には耳を傾けなかったが、バッタと云う野だの語を聴いた時は、思わずきっとなった。野だは何のためかバッタと云う言葉だけことさら力を入れて、明瞭におれの耳にはいるようにして、そのあとをわざとぼかしてしまった。おれは動かないでやはり聞いていた。,"I didn't listen to the outside words, but when I heard the word grasshopper, I was sure. For some reason, Noda put a lot of effort into the word grasshopper so that it could be clearly heard in my ears, and the rest was intentionally blurred. I didn't move and was still listening.","I did not listen to what they were talking, but when I heard Clown say “grasshoppers,” I cocked my ear instinctively. Clown emphasized, for what reason I do not know the word “grasshopers” so that it would be sure to reach my ear plainly, and he blurred the rest on purpose. I did not move, and kept on listening.","I wasn’t listening to any of this very carefully, but when I heard the word ‘grasshoppers’ coming out of the Hanger’s mouth it jolted me to attention. For some reason he had put particular emphasis on it, as if to make sure that I would hear it loud and clear, but then he deliberately went back to that muffled tone. I kept still and went on listening."
「まあ、もう二三日様子を見ようじゃないか。それでいよいよとなったら、温泉の町で取って抑えるより仕方がないだろう」,"""Well, let's see what's going on for a couple of days. When it's finally over, there's no choice but to take it down in the hot spring town.""","I call all kinds of god to witness if this is just and right!” “Let’s wait for two or three days and see how it turns out. And if we can’t do anything else, we will have to catch him at the hot springs town.”","‘Anyway, let’s wait a couple of days and see what happens. Then if worst comes to worst, we’ll just have to catch him at the hot spring, I guess.’"
その夜おれと山嵐はこの不浄な地を離れた。船が岸を去れば去るほどいい心持ちがした。神戸から東京までは直行で新橋へ着いた時は、ようやく娑婆へ出たような気がした。山嵐とはすぐ分れたぎり今日まで逢う機会がない。,"That night I and the mountain storm left this unclean land. The more the ship left the shore, the better I felt. When I arrived at Shimbashi directly from Kobe to Tokyo, I felt like I was finally out to the old woman. I haven't had a chance to meet Yamaarashi until today.","That night I and Porcupine left the town. The farther the vessel steamed away from the shore, the more refreshed we felt. From Kobe to Tokyo we boarded a through train and when we made Shimbashi, we breathed as if we were once more in congenial human society. I parted from Porcupine at the station, and have not had the chance of meeting him since.","That evening the Porcupine and I left that accursed place behind us. The more distance the boat put between us and the shore, the happier we felt. From Kobe we took an express train straight to Tokyo. When we arrived at Shimbashi Station, I felt like I had finally made it out of purgatory and back to the real world. The Porcupine and I went our separate ways from there; I haven’t had a chance to see him again since."
「どうして」,"""why""",“How?” “How?,‘How come?’ ‘How come?
「なに今夜はきっとくるよ。――おい見ろ見ろ」と小声になったから、おれは思わずどきりとした。黒い帽子を戴いた男が、角屋の瓦斯燈を下から見上げたまま暗い方へ通り過ぎた。違っている。おやおやと思った。そのうち帳場の時計が遠慮なく十時を打った。今夜もとうとう駄目らしい。,"""What's going to come tonight?-Look at it,"" whispered, so I was surprised. A man wearing a black hat passed by in the dark, looking up at the gas lamp of Kakuya from below. Are different. I thought it was awful. The clock in the counter struck ten o'clock without hesitation. It seems that it's finally useless tonight.","“Well, I’m sure he will come to-night…—… Look, look!” His voice changed to whisper and I was alert in a moment. A fellow with a black hat looked up at the gas light of Kadoya and passed on into the darkness. No, it was not Red Shirt. Disappointing, this! Meanwhile the clock at the office below merrily tinkled off ten. It seems to be another bum watch to-night.","‘No, no, he’ll come tonight, for sure … Hey, look! Look!’ These last words, delivered in a whisper, took my breath away. A man in a black hat looked up at the gas lamp in front of Kado-ya, then vanished into the darkness. Not him. Uh-oh, I thought. Soon the clock downstairs struck ten, as loud as it pleased. It didn’t look like this would be the big night after all."
おれは筆と巻紙を抛り出して、ごろりと転がって肱枕をして庭の方を眺めてみたが、やっぱり清の事が気にかかる。その時おれはこう思った。こうして遠くへ来てまで、清の身の上を案じていてやりさえすれば、おれの真心は清に通じるに違いない。通じさえすれば手紙なんぞやる必要はない。やらなければ無事で暮してると思ってるだろう。たよりは死んだ時か病気の時か、何か事の起った時にやりさえすればいい訳だ。,"I pulled out the brush and rolling paper, rolled around, put on my elbow pillow, and looked at the garden, but I was still worried about the Qing dynasty. At that time, I thought like this. As long as I think about the Qing dynasty until I come far away, my sincerity must lead to the Qing dynasty. You don't have to write a letter as long as you can understand it. If you don't do it, you'll think you're living safely. You only have to do it when you die, when you are sick, or when something happens.","I threw down the brush and letter-paper, and lying down with my bent arms as a pillow, gazed at the garden. But the thought of the letter to Kiyo would come back in my mind. Then I thought this way; If I am thinking of her from my heart, even at such a distance, my sincerity would find responsive appreciation in Kiyo. If it does find response, there is no need of sending letters. She will regard the absence of letters from me as a sign of my being in good health. If I write in case of illness or when something unusual happens, that will be sufficient.","I flung my brush and paper aside, sprawled out on the floor, and lay there gazing out at the garden with my head resting on my arm. I was still concerned about Kiyo. It occurred to me that even though we were separated by such a great distance now, as long as I continued to worry about how she was getting on, she would surely realize my true feelings. And as long as she was aware of them, there was no need for me to send anything like a letter. If I didn’t send one she’d probably assume that everything was all right. You could do without sending a letter until something really big happened – a death, say, or an illness."
「教頭の職を持ってるものが何で角屋へ行って泊った」と山嵐はすぐ詰りかけた。,"""Why did someone with a vice-principal job go to Kakuya and stay there?"" Yamaarashi immediately squeezed.",“What makes one holding the job of a head teacher stay over night at Kadoya!” Porcupine directly fired the opening gun.,"‘And just what was a man who occupies the position of Assistant Principal doing spending the night at Kado-ya?’ demanded the Porcupine, wasting no time in getting the inquest under way."
「だまれ」と山嵐は拳骨を食わした。赤シャツはよろよろしたが「これは乱暴だ、狼藉である。理非を弁じないで腕力に訴えるのは無法だ」,"""Dare,"" Yamaarashi ate his fist. The red shirt shook, but ""This is violent, it's a wolf. It's illegal to appeal to your strength without blaming it.""",“Shut up!” Porcupine wallopped him one. Red Shirt tottered. “This is outrageous! It is rough to resort to force before deciding the right or wrong of it!”,"‘Just SHUT UP!’ said the Porcupine, and socked him in the face. Redshirt took a few tottering steps, then mumbled ‘This is unmitigated brutality! Blindly resorting to brute force, with no sense of right and wrong – it’s inexcusable!’ ‘Don’t you tell me what’s inexcusable!’"

「そんな裁判はないぜ。狸は大方腹鼓を叩き過ぎて、胃の位置が顚倒したんだ。君とおれは、いっしょに、祝勝会へ出てさ、いっしょに高知のぴかぴか踴りを見てさ、いっしょに喧嘩をとめにはいったんじゃないか。辞表を出せというなら公平に両方へ出せと云うがいい。なんで田舎の学校はそう理窟が分らないんだろう。焦慮いな」,"""There is no such trial. The raccoon dog hit the belly drum too much and the position of the stomach fell down. You and I went to the celebration party together and saw the shiny quarrel of Kochi together. Well, I think we should stop the quarrel together. If you want to give up your resignation, you should give it to both sides fairly. Why do rural schools don't understand the cave?","“That isn’t fair. Badger probably had been pounding his belly-drum too much and his stomach is upside down,” I said, “you and I went to the celebration, looked at the glittering sword dance together, and jumped into the fight together to stop it. Wasn’t it so? If he wants you to tender your resignation, he should be impartial and should have asked me to also. What makes everything in the country school so dull-head.","‘What kind of justice is that?’ I said. ‘That Badger must have been beating his chest so hard that he knocked himself senseless. The two of us went to the victory celebration together. And we watched those dancers flash their swords together, didn’t we? And we tried to stop that fight together, didn’t we? If he’s asking you to resign, he should ask me, too. It’s only fair. Why do these country schools have to be so damned unreasonable? It’s driving me crazy!’"
三,three,CHAPTER III.,3
おれはここまで考えたら、眠くなったからぐうぐう寝てしまった。あくる日は思う仔細があるから、例刻より早ヤ目に出校して山嵐を待ち受けた。ところがなかなか出て来ない。うらなりが出て来る。漢学の先生が出て来る。野だが出て来る。しまいには赤シャツまで出て来たが山嵐の机の上は白墨が一本竪に寝ているだけで閑静なものだ。おれは、控所へはいるや否や返そうと思って、うちを出る時から、湯銭のように手の平へ入れて一銭五厘、学校まで握って来た。おれは膏っ手だから、開けてみると一銭五厘が汗をかいている。汗をかいてる銭を返しちゃ、山嵐が何とか云うだろうと思ったから、机の上へ置いてふうふう吹いてまた握った。ところへ赤シャツが来て昨日は失敬、迷惑でしたろうと云ったから、迷惑じゃありません、お蔭で腹が減りましたと答えた。すると赤シャツは山嵐の机の上へ肱を突いて、あの盤台面をおれの鼻の側面へ持って来たから、何をするかと思ったら、君昨日返りがけに船の中で話した事は、秘密にしてくれたまえ。まだ誰にも話しやしますまいねと云った。女のような声を出すだけに心配性な男と見える。話さない事はたしかである。しかしこれから話そうと云う心持ちで、すでに一銭五厘手の平に用意しているくらいだから、ここで赤シャツから口留めをされちゃ、ちと困る。赤シャツも赤シャツだ。山嵐と名を指さないにしろ、あれほど推察の出来る謎をかけておきながら、今さらその謎を解いちゃ迷惑だとは教頭とも思えぬ無責任だ。元来ならおれが山嵐と戦争をはじめて鎬を削ってる真中へ出て堂々とおれの肩を持つべきだ。それでこそ一校の教頭で、赤シャツを着ている主意も立つというもんだ。,"When I thought about it so far, I fell asleep because I became sleepy. The day after that, I had some details to think about, so I went to school earlier than usual and waited for the mountain storm. However, it does not come out easily. The swelling comes out. A Chinese teacher comes out. It's a field, but it comes out. In the end, even a red shirt came out, but on the desk of Yamastorm, it was quiet with only one white ink lying on the vertical. As soon as I entered the waiting room, I thought I would return it, and from the time I left home, I put it in the palm of my hand like hot water and held it to school. I'm a creamer, so when I open it, I'm sweating. I returned the sweaty money and thought that Yamaarashi would do something about it, so I put it on the desk and blew it again. However, when the red shirt came, he said yesterday that he was disrespectful and annoying, so it wasn't annoying, and he answered that he was hungry. Then the red shirt pierced the elbow on the desk of Yamastorm and brought that board to the side of my nose, so when I wondered what to do, you said yesterday on the ship. Please keep it a secret. He said he wouldn't talk to anyone yet. It looks like a worried man just because he makes a voice like a woman. It is true that he does not speak. However, I'm thinking of talking about it, and I've already prepared it in the palm of my hand, so I'm in trouble if I get a squeeze from my red shirt here. Red shirts are also red shirts. Even if you don't call it Yamaarashi, it's irresponsible that you can't think that it's a nuisance to solve the mystery while putting on such a mystery that can be inferred. Originally, I should go out to the middle of the mountain storm and the war for the first time and shave my hoes, and hold my shoulders proudly. That's why he is the vice-principal of one school, and he has the idea of wearing a red shirt.","When I thought thus far, I felt sleepy and slept like a log. The next day, as I had something in my mind, I went to the school earlier than usual and waited for Porcupine, but he did not appear for a considerable time. “Confucius” was there, so was Clown, and finally Red Shirt, but for Porcupine there was a piece of chalk on his desk but the owner was not there. I had been thinking of paying that one sen and a half as soon as I entered the room, and had brought the coppers to the school grasped in my hand. My hands get easily sweaty, and when I opened my hand, I found them wet. Thinking that Porcupine might say something if wet coins were given him, I placed them upon my desk, and cooled them by blowing in them. Then Red Shirt came to me and said he was sorry to detain me yesterday, thought I have been annoyed. I told him I was not annoyed at all, only I was hungry. Thereupon Red Shirt put his elbows upon the desk, brought his sauce-pan-like face close to my nose, and said; “Say, keep dark what I told you yesterday in the boat. You haven’t told it anybody, have you?” He seems quite a nervous fellow as becoming one who talks in a feminish voice. It was certain that I had not told it to anybody, but as I was in the mood to tell it and had already one sen and a half in my hand, I would be a little rattled if a gag was put on me. To the devil with Red Shirt! Although he had not mentioned the name “Porcupine,” he had given me such pointers as to put me wise as to who the objective was, and now he requested me not to blow the gaff!—it was an irresponsibility least to be expected from a head teacher. In the ordinary run of things, he should step into the thick of the fight between Porcupine and me, and side with me with all his colors flying. By so doing, he might be worthy the position of the head teacher, and vindicate the principle of wearing red shirts.","Having figured that much out, I began to feel drowsy and soon dropped into a deep sleep. The next day I headed to school earlier than usual in order to carry out my plan and waited for the Porcupine to arrive, but there was no sign of him. The Pale Squash arrived; the Chinese classics teacher arrived; the Hanger-on arrived; even by the time Redshirt arrived the Porcupine’s desk was still undisturbed, with just a single stick of chalk reposing on top in its holder. I had the coins stuck in my fist from the time I left home, the same way I would if I were on my way to the bathhouse, ready to hand back to him as soon as he walked in. When I finally opened my hand, they were coated with the sweat from my palm. Since he would probably make some kind of comment if I handed them over all greasy with sweat, I laid them on top of my desk, puffed on them until they were dry, and stuck them back in my hand. At this point Redshirt came over and started to apologize for what had gone on yesterday, saying that it must have been a hard day for me. Not at all, I said; thanks to them, in fact, I had managed to work up a good appetite. Then, resting an elbow on the Porcupine’s desk, he leaned his broad, flat face right up alongside my nose. Just as I was trying to figure out what he was up to, he asked me to keep what he and the Hanger had said yesterday when we were coming back in the boat strictly confidential, and added that he certainly hoped that I hadn’t mentioned it to anyone already. That feminine voice of his made him sound really nervous. Of course I hadn’t said anything so far. But since I was definitely planning to – I still had the money ready, gripped tightly in my hand – I would be in a bind if he tried to keep me from talking. This Redshirt was really something: first he gives me that riddle which was so easy to solve, even if he never came right out and mentioned the Porcupine by name, and now he tells me that there will be trouble if I do figure it out. Hardly the kind of responsible behavior that you’d expect from an Assistant Principal! What he should have been doing was to get himself ready to step right into the thick of things, on my side of course, once the blades started flashing in my battle with the Porcupine. That’s the kind of attitude you would expect from a real Assistant Principal, and that’s the kind of attitude that would have entitled him to wear that red shirt of his."
それから清はおれがうちでも持って独立したら、一所になる気でいた。どうか置いて下さいと何遍も繰り返して頼んだ。おれも何だかうちが持てるような気がして、うん置いてやると返事だけはしておいた。ところがこの女はなかなか想像の強い女で、あなたはどこがお好き、麴町ですか麻布ですか、お庭へぶらんこをおこしらえ遊ばせ、西洋間は一つでたくさんですなどと勝手な計画を独りで並べていた。その時は家なんか欲しくも何ともなかった。西洋館も日本建も全く不用であったから、そんなものは欲しくないと、いつでも清に答えた。すると、あなたは欲がすくなくって、心が奇麗だと云ってまた賞めた。清は何と云っても賞めてくれる。,"Then Qing was willing to become one place if I had it and became independent. I repeatedly asked him to put it down. I felt like I could have it, so I just replied when I left it. However, this woman is a very imaginative woman, and what do you like, Kojimachi or Azabu? I was lining up. At that time, I didn't want a house. I always answered Qing that I didn't want such a thing because neither the Western-style building nor the Japanese-style building was needed at all. Then you praised him again for his lack of greed and his beautiful heart. Qing praises me after all.","And Kiyo seemed to have decided for herself to live with me when I became independent and occupy my own house. “Please let me live with you,”—she repeatedly asked of me. Feeling somewhat that I should eventually be able to own a house, I answered her “Yes,” as far as such an answer went. This woman, by the way, was strongly imaginative. She questioned me what place I liked,—Kojimachi-ku or Azabu-ku?—and suggested that I should have a swing in our garden, that one room be enough for European style, etc., planning everything to suit her own fancy. I did not then care a straw for anything like a house; so neither Japanese nor European style was much of use to me, and I told her to that effect. Then she would praise me as uncovetous and clean of heart. Whatever I said, she had praise for me.","What’s more, Kiyo had a notion that once I was on my own and had that house, she should come and join me there. Over and over, she asked me to let her live with me. I myself had come to believe that I’d manage to end up with a house of my own somehow, so I told her I’d take her in. She had a tendency to let her imagination run wild, though, and sometimes she’d ask me whether I thought Kōjimachi was a more suitable neighborhood than Azabu, or tell me that it would be nice if we put a swing in the yard, or that one Western-style room would be plenty, as if she was getting it all planned out in advance. In those days I didn’t have the least interest in things like owning a house. Western-style or Japanese, it wasn’t something that I had any use for, so whenever Kiyo started in on her fantasies I would tell her that I didn’t want any of that grand stuff. Then she would praise me again, saying that it just showed how unselfish I was, what a pure heart I had. No matter what I said, she could always find some reason to praise me for it."
翌日おれは学校へ出て校長室へ入って談判を始めた。,"The next day I went to school, entered the principal's office, and started talking.",On going to the school next day I made straightway for the room of the principal and started firing;,When I went to school the next morning I headed straight to the Principal’s office.
おれには一向分らない。今より重大な責任と云えば、数学の主任だろうが、主任は山嵐だから、やっこさんなかなか辞職する気遣いはない。それに、生徒の人望があるから転任や免職は学校の得策であるまい。赤シャツの談話はいつでも要領を得ない。要領を得なくっても用事はこれで済んだ。それから少し雑談をしているうちに、うらなり君の送別会をやる事や、ついてはおれが酒を飲むかと云う問や、うらなり先生は君子で愛すべき人だと云う事や――赤シャツはいろいろ弁じた。しまいに話をかえて君俳句をやりますかと来たから、こいつは大変だと思って、俳句はやりません、さようならと、そこそこに帰って来た。発句は芭蕉か髪結床の親方のやるもんだ。数学の先生が朝顔やに釣瓶をとられてたまるものか。,"I have no idea. The more important responsibility is probably the chief of mathematics, but since the chief is Yamaarashi, he doesn't have to worry about resigning. Besides, it is not a good idea for the school to transfer or dismiss because of the desire of the students. The discourse of red shirts is always out of the question. Even if I didn't get the point, I was done with this. Then, while chatting a little, I had a farewell party for Uranari-kun, asked if I would drink alcohol, and said that Uranari-sensei was a prince and a lovable person-red shirt. Said variously. In the end, I asked if I would like to do your haiku, so I thought it would be difficult, so I wouldn't do haiku. Goodbye, I came back to some extent. The phrase is Basho or the master of Kami-yui. Is it something that a math teacher can collect by taking a fishing bottle in the morning glory?","I could not make out what he meant. To assume more responsibility might mean my appointment to the senior instructor of mathematics, but Porcupine is the senior instructor and there is no danger of his resigning. Besides, he is so very popular among the students that his transfer or discharge would be inadvisable. Red Shirt always misses the point. And though he did not get to the point, the object of my visit was ended. We talked a while on sundry matters, Red Shirt proposing a farewell dinner party for Hubbard Squash, asking me if I drink liquor and praising Hubbard Squash as an amiable gentleman, etc. Finally he changed the topic and asked me if I take an interest in “haiku”[8] Here is where I beat it, I thought, and, saying “No, I don’t, good by,” hastily left the house. The “haiku” should be a diversion of Baseo[9] or the boss of a barbershop. It would not do for the teacher of mathematics to rave over the old wooden bucket and the morning glory.[10] [Footnote 8: The 17-syllable poem] [Footnote 9: A famous composer of the poem.] [Footnote 10: There is a well-known 17-syllable poem describing the scene of morning glories entwining around the wooden bucket.]","I didn’t get it at all. A ‘greater responsibility’ would probably mean becoming the head mathematics teacher, but that was the Porcupine’s job, and there was no need to worry about that character resigning any time soon. What’s more, since he was the students’ favorite, it certainly wouldn’t be a good idea for the school to transfer him or fire him. It was always hard to see what Redshirt was really getting at when he told you something, but at least we had now covered the business that we needed to talk about. As we chatted on a little about this and that, he brought up the topic of the Squash’s farewell party, and then the question of whether I was a drinker, and then something about what a lovable gentleman the Squash was. Finally, he changed the subject completely and hit me with a question about whether I ever composed haiku. This sounded like trouble, so I told him that I didn’t, said goodbye, and headed home on the spot. Haiku is either for masters like Bashō, or for guys like hair stylists. What business does a math teacher have fooling around with little poems about morning glories and the bucket at the well?"

おれが宿直部屋へ連れてきた奴を詰問し始めると、豚は、打っても擲いても豚だから、ただ知らんがなで、どこまでも通す了見と見えて、けっして白状しない。そのうち一人来る、二人来る、だんだん二階から宿直部屋へ集まってくる。見るとみんな眠そうに瞼をはらしている。けちな奴等だ。一晩ぐらい寝ないで、そんな面をして男と云われるか。面でも洗って議論に来いと云ってやったが、誰も面を洗いに行かない。,"When I started asking the guy I brought to the night duty room, the pig was a pig, whether it was hit or struck, so I just didn't know it, and it seemed like I could pass it forever, and I never confessed. One of them will come, two will come, and gradually they will gather from the second floor to the night duty room. Everyone looks sleepy with their eyelids. They are stingy guys. Do you call yourself a man without sleeping for about one night? I told him to wash his face and come to the discussion, but no one went to wash his face.","I began questioning those two in my room, but,—you cannot pound out the leopard’s spots no matter how you may try,—they seemed determined to push it through by an insistent declaration of “not guilty,” that they would not confess. While this questioning was going on, the students upstairs came down, one by one, and began congregating in my room. I noticed all their eyes were swollen from want of sleep. “Blooming nice faces you got for not sleeping only one night. And you call yourselves men! Go, wash your face and come back to hear what I’ve got to tell you.” I hurled this shot at them, but none of them went to wash his face.","When we got back to the night duty room I began my interrogation, but no matter how hard you beat it a pig is still a pig, and the only thing I could get out of them was ‘Uhh, I don’t know’; they weren’t about to confess to anything. By and by the rest of the students started coming downstairs in ones and twos and gathering in front of my room. They all looked sleepy, with puffy eyes. Shabbier than ever! How could you call yourself a man if you ended up with a face like that after nothing worse than losing a night’s sleep? I told them to go get their faces washed and then we would talk, but none of them left."
その時はもう仕方がないと観念して先方の云う通り勘当されるつもりでいたら、十年来召し使っている清という下女が、泣きながらおやじに詫まって、ようやくおやじの怒りが解けた。それにもかかわらずあまりおやじを怖いとは思わなかった。かえってこの清と云う下女に気の毒であった。この下女はもと由緒のあるものだったそうだが、瓦解のときに零落して、つい奉公までするようになったのだと聞いている。だから婆さんである。この婆さんがどういう因縁か、おれを非常に可愛がってくれた。不思議なものである。母も死ぬ三日前に愛想をつかした――おやじも年中持て余している――町内では乱暴者の悪太郎と爪弾きをする――このおれを無暗に珍重してくれた。おれは到底人に好かれる性でないとあきらめていたから、他人から木の端のように取り扱われるのは何とも思わない、かえってこの清のようにちやほやしてくれるのを不審に考えた。清は時々台所で人の居ない時に「あなたは真っ直でよいご気性だ」と賞める事が時々あった。しかしおれには清の云う意味が分からなかった。好い気性なら清以外のものも、もう少し善くしてくれるだろうと思った。清がこんな事を云う度におれはお世辞は嫌いだと答えるのが常であった。すると婆さんはそれだから好いご気性ですと云っては、嬉しそうにおれの顔を眺めている。自分の力でおれを製造して誇ってるように見える。少々気味がわるかった。,"At that time, I thought that it couldn't be helped anymore, and if I was going to be disowned as the other party said, the young girl named Kiyoshi, who had been calling for ten years, apologized to her father while crying, and finally the father's anger was released. Nevertheless, I didn't think I was too scared of my father. On the contrary, I feel sorry for this young girl named Kiyoshi. It seems that this maiden had a long history, but I heard that she fell to zero at the time of the collapse and even became an indentured servant. That's why I'm an old woman. He loved me very much for what kind of connection this old woman had. It's strange. Three days before my mother died, I was amiable-I have a lot of old men all year long-I play with the violent evil Taro in the town block-and he gave me a dark prize. I had given up that it wasn't the sex that people liked at all, so I didn't think it would be treated like the edge of a tree by others, but rather suspiciously thought that it would make me feel like this Qing dynasty. Qing sometimes praised ""You are straight and good temperament"" when there are no people in the kitchen. But I didn't understand what Kiyo meant. I thought that if I had a good temper, things other than Qing would be a little better. Every time Qing said something like this, I used to say that I didn't like flattery. Then, the old lady is looking at my face happily, saying that she has a good temper. It looks like I'm proud to make myself. It was a little weird.","Then I gave up myself for lost, and expected to be really disinherited. But our maid Kiyo, who had been with us for ten years or so, interceded on my behalf, and tearfully apologized for me, and by her appeal my father’s wrath was softened. I did not regard him, however, as one to be afraid of in any way, but rather felt sorry for our Kiyo. I had heard that Kiyo was of a decent, well-to-do family, but being driven to poverty at the time of the Restoration, had to work as a servant. So she was an old woman by this time. This old woman,—by what affinity , as the Buddhists say, I don’t know,—loved me a great deal. Strange, indeed! She was almost blindly fond of me,—me, whom mother, became thoroughly disgusted with three days before her death; whom father considered a most aggravating proposition all the year round, and whom the neighbors cordially hated as the local bully among the youngsters. I had long reconciled myself to the fact that my nature was far from being attractive to others, and so didn’t mind if I were treated as a piece of wood; so I thought it uncommon that Kiyo should pet me like that. Sometimes in the kitchen, when there was nobody around, she would praise me saying that I was straightforward and of a good disposition. What she meant by that exactly, was not clear to me, however. If I were of so good a nature as she said, I imagined those other than Kiyo should accord me a better treatment. So whenever Kiyo said to me anything of the kind, I used to answer that I did not like passing compliments. Then she would remark; “That’s the very reason I say you are of a good disposition,” and would gaze at me with absorbing tenderness. She seemed to recreate me by her own imagination, and was proud of the fact. I felt even chilled through my marrow at her constant attention to me.","I figured that I was going to be disinherited just like he said and that was all there was to it, but then Kiyo, the old woman who had been our maid for the last ten years, appealed to him in tears, and he finally cooled down. Even with all this, though, I wasn’t particularly scared of the old man. Mainly I felt sorry for Kiyo. According to the stories I heard she was supposed to be from a respectable family, but when the shogunate was overthrown she was left with nothing and ended up having to work as a servant. That’s why she was just a humble old woman now. I don’t know what kind of karmic link there was between the two of us, but for some reason she was tremendously fond of me. It was really amazing. My mother had had enough of me three days before she died … the old man never had any use for me at all … and everybody in the neighborhood thought I was just a little good-for-nothing and wouldn’t have anything to do with me … but this one old woman was absolutely crazy about me. I had already come to the conclusion that I wasn’t the kind of person that anybody could like and it didn’t bother me at all if people treated me as if I was just a block of wood, which only made me wonder all the more why Kiyo fussed over me the way she did. Sometimes when she was in the kitchen and nobody else was around, she would praise me for having what she called ‘a fine, upstanding character.’ I had no idea what she meant, though. I figured that if I really had such a fine character, other people should be treating me a little better. Whenever Kiyo said something like that, I’d tell her that I couldn’t stand being flattered. Then she’d say that it just showed how fine my character really was, and gaze at me adoringly. She seemed to be taking pride in some version of me that she’d created all by herself. There was something almost creepy about it."
うらなり君の送別会のあるという日の朝、学校へ出たら、山嵐が突然、君先だってはいか銀が来て、君が乱暴して困るから、どうか出るように話してくれと頼んだから、真面目に受けて、君に出てやれと話したのだが、あとから聞いてみると、あいつは悪るい奴で、よく偽筆へ贋落款などを押して売りつけるそうだから、全く君の事も出鱈目に違いない。君に懸物や骨董を売りつけて、商売にしようと思ってたところが、君が取り合わないで儲けがないものだから、あんな作りごとをこしらえて胡魔化したのだ。僕はあの人物を知らなかったので君に大変失敬した勘弁したまえと長々しい謝罪をした。,"When I went to school on the morning of the day when there was a farewell party for Uranari, Yamaarashi suddenly asked me to come out because silver came suddenly and you were in trouble because you were violent. I took it seriously and told you to go out, but when I asked him later, he was a bad guy, and he often pushed a fake brush to sell it, so I was totally disappointed with you. Must. I was thinking of selling hangings and antiques to you and making it a business, but because you couldn't make a profit, I made such a work and turned it into a devil. I didn't know that person, so I apologized for a long time before I was very disappointed with you.","When I went to the school, in the morning of the day the farewell dinner party was to be held, Porcupine suddenly spoke to me; “The other day I asked you to quit the Ikagins because Ikagin begged of me to have you leave there as you were too tough, and I believed him. But I heard afterward that Ikagin is a crook and often passes imitation of famous drawings for originals. I think what he told me about you must be a lie. He tried to sell pictures and curios to you, but as you shook him off, he told some false stories on you. I did very wrong by you because I did not know his character, and wish you would forgive me.” And he offered me a lengthy apology.","When I went to school on the morning of the day of the farewell banquet for the Pale Squash, the Porcupine suddenly offered me this long-winded apology: ‘The other day when Ikagin came and told me that you were just too rough for them, and then asked me to do them a favor and see if I could get rid of you, I took him at his word. But later I found out that he’s actually a shady character who goes around selling fake paintings stamped with phony seals, so I realized that what he said about you must have been false as well. When he saw that you weren’t going to have anything to do with him and he wouldn’t be able to make any money off you by selling you some scrolls and antiques, he came up with that cock-and-bull story of his. I didn’t know what kind of man he was, and I hope you can forgive me for having treated you so badly.’ Without a word I picked up the one and a half sen which were still sitting on the Porcupine’s desk and put them in my coin purse. ‘You’re taking them back?’ he asked incredulously. ‘ Yeah,’ I explained, ‘I didn’t want to accept any favors from you"

赤シャツが座に復するのを待ちかねて、山嵐がぬっと立ち上がったから、おれは嬉しかったので、思わず手をぱちぱちと拍った。すると狸を始め一同がことごとくおれの方を見たには少々困った。山嵐は何を云うかと思うとただ今校長始めことに教頭は古賀君の転任を非常に残念がられたが、私は少々反対で古賀君が一日も早く当地を去られるのを希望しております。延岡は僻遠の地で、当地に比べたら物質上の不便はあるだろう。が、聞くところによれば風俗のすこぶる淳朴な所で、職員生徒ことごとく上代樸直の気風を帯びているそうである。心にもないお世辞を振り蒔いたり、美しい顔をして君子を陥れたりするハイカラ野郎は一人もないと信ずるからして、君のごとき温良篤厚の士は必ずその地方一般の歓迎を受けられるに相違ない。吾輩は大いに古賀君のためにこの転任を祝するのである。終りに臨んで君が延岡に赴任されたら、その地の淑女にして、君子の好逑となるべき資格あるものを択んで一日も早く円満なる家庭をかたち作って、かの不貞無節なるお転婆を事実の上において慚死せしめん事を希望します。えへんえへんと二つばかり大きな咳払いをして席に着いた。おれは今度も手を叩こうと思ったが、またみんながおれの面を見るといやだから、やめにしておいた。山嵐が坐ると今度はうらなり先生が起った。先生はご鄭寧に、自席から、座敷の端の末座まで行って、慇懃に一同に挨拶をした上、今般は一身上の都合で九州へ参る事になりましたについて、諸先生方が小生のためにこの盛大なる送別会をお開き下さったのは、まことに感銘の至りに堪えぬ次第で――ことにただ今は校長、教頭その他諸君の送別の辞を頂戴して、大いに難有く服膺する訳であります。私はこれから遠方へ参りますが、なにとぞ従前の通りお見捨てなくご愛顧のほどを願います。とへえつく張って席に戻った。うらなり君はどこまで人が好いんだか、ほとんど底が知れない。自分がこんなに馬鹿にされている校長や、教頭に恭しくお礼を云っている。それも義理一遍の挨拶ならだが、あの様子や、あの言葉つきや、あの顔つきから云うと、心から感謝しているらしい。こんな聖人に真面目にお礼を云われたら、気の毒になって、赤面しそうなものだが狸も赤シャツも真面目に謹聴しているばかりだ。,"I couldn't wait for the red shirt to return to its seat, and Yamastorm stood up, so I was happy, so I clapping my hands. Then, it was a little troublesome for everyone, including the raccoon dog, to see me. When I wondered what Yamaarashi would say, the vice-principal was very disappointed with the transfer of Mr. Koga to the beginning of the principal, but I am a little opposed and hope that Mr. Koga will leave the area as soon as possible. increase. Nobeoka is a remote area, and there may be material inconveniences compared to this area. However, I heard that it is a very simple place of customs, and all the staff and students have the spirit of Kamidai. Since I believe that there is no high-colored bastard who sprinkles unprecedented compliments or falls into a prince with a beautiful face, a scholar of Atsushi Onra like you is sure to be welcomed by the general public in the region. Must be. I greatly celebrate this transfer for Koga-kun. When you are transferred to Nobeoka at the end, you will be unfaithful by making a lady there and choosing what is qualified to be a good luck for your child and creating a peaceful family as soon as possible. I hope that the tomboy will die in fact. I cleared my throat and took a seat. I thought I'd clap my hands again, but I didn't like it when everyone looked at me again. When Yamaarashi sat down, the teacher got up. The vice-principal politely went from his seat to the end of the tatami room, greeted everyone, and now he is going to Kyushu for personal reasons. The reason why I held this grand farewell party was because I was really impressed-especially now that I have received the farewell remarks of the principal, vice-principal and others, I am very grateful for the reason. Is. I will be far away from now on, but I would like to ask for your patronage without abandoning it as before. I stretched out and returned to my seat. I can hardly tell how much people like Uranari. I am grateful to the principal and the vice-principal who are so stupid. It's a greeting from Ippen-in-law, but it seems that he is truly grateful for that appearance, that word, and that face. If I thank such a saint seriously, I feel sorry and I'm likely to blush, but I'm just listening to the raccoon dog and the red shirt seriously.","No sooner had Red Shirt sat down than Porcupine stood up, and highly rejoiced, I clapped hands. At this Badger and others glanced at me, and I felt that I blushed a little. “Our principal and other gentlemen,” he said, “particularly the head teacher, expressed their sincere regret at Mr. Koga’s transfer. I am of a different opinion, and hope to see him leave the town at the earliest possible moment. Nobeoka is an out-of-the-way, backwoods town, and compared with this town, it may have more material inconveniences, but according to what I have heard, Nobeoka is said to be a town where the customs are simple and untainted, and the teachers and students still strong in the straightforward characteristics of old days. I am convinced that in Nobeoka there is not a single high-collared guy who passes round threadbare remarks, or who with smooth face, entraps innocent people. I am sure that a man like Mr. Koga, gentle and honest, will surely be received with an enthusiastic welcome there. I heartily welcome this transfer for the sake of Mr. Koga. In concluding, I hope that when he is settled down at Nobeoka, he will find a lady qualified to become his wife, and form a sweet home at an early date and incidentally let the inconstant, unchaste sassy old wench die ashamed …… a’hum, a’hum!” He coughed twice significantly and sat down. I thought of clapping my hands again, but as it would draw attention, I refrained. When Porcupine finished his speech, Hubbard Squash arose politely, slipped out of his seat, went to the furthest end of the room, and having bowed to all in a most respectful manner, acknowledged the compliments in the following way; “On the occasion of my going to Kyushu for my personal convenience, I am deeply impressed and appreciate the way my friends have honored me with this magnificent dinner……. The farewell addresses by our principal and other gentlemen will be long held in my fondest recollection……. I am going far away now, but I hope my name be included in the future as in the past in the list of friends of the gentlemen here to-night.” Then again bowing, he returned to his seat. There was no telling how far the “good-naturedness” of Hubbard Squash might go. He had respectfully thanked the principal and the head teacher who had been fooling him. And it was not a formal, cut-and-dried reply he made, either; by his manner, tone and face, he appeared to have been really grateful from his heart. Badger and Red Shirt should have blushed when they were addressed so seriously by so good a man as Hubbard Squash, but they only listened with long faces.","No sooner had Redshirt taken his seat than the Porcupine shot up as if he’d hardly been able to wait for this moment to come. Impulsively I began to clap my hands in glee, but as the entire assembly, from the Badger on down, turned their eyes in my direction, it made me feel a little uneasy. The Porcupine’s speech, which I had been anticipating so eagerly, went like this: ‘We have just heard, first from our Principal and especially from our Assistant Principal, how deeply they regret the transfer of Mr Koga. I, however, take a somewhat different view: I look forward eagerly to his departure from this place, and as quickly as possible. Nobeoka is indeed a remote location, and in comparison with our town it may present some inconveniences from a material point of view. But from what I have heard, its ways remain simple and unspoiled, and the faculty and student body there all retain the plain and solid virtues of olden days. In such a place you will find, I believe, not a single fashionable knave who showers you with false-hearted flattery, or seeks to use his pleasing features to mislead a gentleman. In such a place a warm-hearted, virtuous person like yourself will be certain to be welcomed with open arms by all. Therefore, Mr Koga, I heartily congratulate you on the occasion of this auspicious transfer. Finally, I would like to offer a humble wish that once you have established yourself in Nobeoka, you will as soon as possible find yourself a well-bred young lady, one who is qualified to serve as a suitable companion to a true gentleman, and proceed to establish a harmonious home and family with her, and by so doing bring mortal shame upon a certain fickle and faithless hussy. Ah-hemm, ah-hemm … ’ Having cleared his throat noisily a couple of times, the Porcupine sat back down. I wanted to clap again but, afraid of attracting everybody’s attention again , I held back. After the Porcupine the next to rise to speak was the Squash himself. Leaving his own seat and walking down to the spot reserved for the lowest-ranking member on the opposite side of the room, he politely offered his salutations to the audience and then proceeded to declare that ‘In all sincerity I can find no words to adequately express how deeply moved I am by this magnificent send-off which my esteemed colleagues have been so kind as to bestow upon me on the occasion of my relocation, due to personal circumstances, to Kyushu. In particular, I am most grateful for the unforgettable farewell messages which I have just received from the Principal, the Assistant Principal, and others. As I prepare to embark on a journey to a distant place, it is my hope that you will not banish me from your thoughts, and will continue to favor me with the same generous support that you have so kindly conferred upon me in the past.’ Then, with a profound and humble bow, he returned to his seat. It seemed that there was virtually no limit to the goodness of the man’s character. Here he was deferentially expressing his gratitude to the Principal and Assistant Principal who had been playing him for a fool. This would have been remarkable enough even if it had only been a matter of empty formalities, but judging from the way he held himself, the words he used, and the expression on his face, you would have to say that his emotions were genuine. To be offered the sincere appreciation of a man as saintly as this should have been enough to inspire feelings of pity and shame in anybody, but the Badger and Redshirt just sat there and soaked it all up with a straight face."

Actually, both of them came to the toilet, but because they were drunk, they probably forgot to go to the toilet and pulled me. The drunken person will go to the place in his eyes and forget the previous thing soon.","Bastard? That’s fine. Bastardly fine. Now, come on.” And they pulled Porcupine and me away. These two fellows really had come to the lavatory, but soaked as they were, in booze bubbles, they apparently forgot to proceed to their original destination, and were pulling us hard. All booze fighters seem to be attracted by whatever comes directly under their eyes for the moment and forget what they had been proposing to do.","Hey, I like that … C’mon … weasel all have a drink together … ’ Before we knew it, they were busy pulling us back inside. Actually, the two of them must have come out to look for the bathroom, but I guess they were too drunk to remember about that when they started dragging us in. It seems that drunks can get so distracted by anything that happens to be in front of their nose at the moment that they forget all about whatever it was they were trying to do before."
二人が着いた頃には、人数ももう大概揃って、五十畳の広間に二つ三つ人間の塊が出来ている。五十畳だけに床は素敵に大きい。おれが山城屋で占領した十五畳敷の床とは比較にならない。尺を取ってみたら二間あった。右の方に、赤い模様のある瀬戸物の瓶を据えて、その中に松の大きな枝が挿してある。松の枝を挿して何にする気か知らないが、何ヶ月立っても散る気遣いがないから、銭が懸らなくって、よかろう。あの瀬戸物はどこで出来るんだと博物の教師に聞いたら、あれは瀬戸物じゃありません、伊万里ですと云った。伊万里だって瀬戸物じゃないかと、云ったら、博物はえへへへへと笑っていた。あとで聞いてみたら、瀬戸で出来る焼物だから、瀬戸と云うのだそうだ。おれは江戸っ子だから、陶器の事を瀬戸物というのかと思っていた。床の真中に大きな懸物があって、おれの顔くらいな大きさな字が二十八字かいてある。どうも下手なものだ。あんまり不味いから、漢学の先生に、なぜあんなまずいものを麗々と懸けておくんですと尋ねたところ、先生はあれは海屋といって有名な書家のかいた者だと教えてくれた。海屋だか何だか、おれは今だに下手だと思っている。,"By the time the two arrived, the number of people was almost the same, and there were two or three human masses in the 50 tatami mat hall. The floor is wonderfully large because it is only 50 tatami mats. It is incomparable to the 15 tatami mat floor that I occupied at Yamashiroya. When I took the scale, it was two minutes. On the right side, a bottle of Setomono with a red pattern is placed, and a large pine branch is inserted in it. I don't know what to do with the pine branches, but I don't care if I stand for months, so I'm glad I don't have to spend money. When I asked the natural history teacher where to make that Setomono, he said it wasn't Setomono, Imari. When I said that Imari was a Seto thing, the natural history was laughing. I heard later that it is called Seto because it is a pottery made in Seto. I'm an Edokko, so I thought that pottery was a seto thing. There is a big hanging in the middle of the floor, and there are 28 letters about the size of my face. I'm not good at it. When I asked the Chinese language teacher why he had such a bad thing, he told me that it was a famous calligrapher called Kaiya. Kaiya or something, I still think I'm not good at it.","When we two came there, about all of the guests were present. They formed two or three groups in the spacious room of fifty mats. The alcove in this room, in harmony with its magnificence, was very large. The alcove in the fifteen-mat room which I occupied at Yamashiro-ya made a small showing beside it. I measured it and found it was twelve feet wide. On the right, in the alcove, there was a seto-ware flower vase, painted with red designs, in which was a large branch of pine tree. Why the pine twigs, I did not know, except that they are in no danger of withering for many a month to come, and are economical. I asked the teacher of natural history where that seto-ware flower vase is made. He told me it was not a seto-ware but an imari. Isn’t imari seto-ware? I wondered audibly, and the natural history man laughed. I heard afterward that we call it a seto-ware because it is made in Seto. I’m a Yedo kid, and thought all china was seto-wares. In the center of the alcove was hung a panel on which were written twenty eight letters, each letter as large as my face. It was poorly written; so poorly indeed that I enquired of the teacher of Confucius why such a poor work be hung in apparent show of pride. He explained that it was written by Kaioku a famous artist in the writing, but Kaioku or anyone else, I still declare the work poorly done.","By the time we arrived most of the others were already there, scattered in groups of two or three in a thirty-foot-square banquet room. As you might expect in such a grand room, the decorative alcove was wonderfully spacious, too; even the alcove in my old room at the inn simply didn’t compare. This one measured a full twelve feet across. On the right side was a Seto ware vase with a red pattern, holding a large pine branch. I wasn’t sure what the point of using a pine branch as a decoration was, but I suppose they were trying to be economical and chose something that would keep its leaves for a couple of months. I asked the science teacher where he thought that piece of Seto ware came from. ‘ That’s not Seto, it’s Imari,’ he announced. When I told him that I thought that Imari was a kind of Seto ware, he just laughed. Later I found out that the term Seto ware strictly refers to pottery made in a place called Seto. Being an Edokko, I had just assumed it was the name for all kinds of ceramics. In the middle of the alcove was a big hanging scroll, with something written in four lines of seven Chinese characters, each of them as big as my face. It looked very poorly done to me. I couldn’t understand why such an ugly piece was being displayed so prominently, but when I asked the Chinese classics teacher about it, he informed me that it was the work of a famous calligraphy master named Kaioku. Kaioku or whatever , I still think it was badly done."
母が死んでからは、おやじと兄と三人で暮していた。おやじは何にもせぬ男で、人の顔さえ見れば貴様は駄目だ駄目だと口癖のように云っていた。何が駄目なんだか今に分らない。妙なおやじがあったもんだ。兄は実業家になるとか云ってしきりに英語を勉強していた。元来女のような性分で、ずるいから、仲がよくなかった。十日に一遍ぐらいの割で喧嘩をしていた。ある時将棋をさしたら卑怯な待駒をして、人が困ると嬉しそうに冷やかした。あんまり腹が立ったから、手に在った飛車を眉間へ擲きつけてやった。眉間が割れて少々血が出た。兄がおやじに言付けた。おやじがおれを勘当すると言い出した。,"After my mother died, I lived with my father and brother. The old man was a man who couldn't do anything, and he said like a habit that you couldn't do anything if you looked at a person's face. I don't know what's wrong now. There was a strange father. My brother was studying English all the time, saying that he would become a businessman. Originally, she was like a woman, and she was sly, so she didn't get along well. I had a quarrel about once every ten days. At one point, when I played shogi, I played a cowardly waiting piece and happily chilled when people were in trouble. I was so angry that I slammed the rook I had in my hand into my eyebrows. The eyebrows broke and a little blood came out. My brother told his father. The old man said he would disown me.","After the death of mother, I lived with father and brother. Father did nothing, and always said “You’re no good” to my face. What he meant by “no good” I am yet to understand. A funny dad he was. My brother was to be seen studying English hard, saying that he was going to be a businessman. He was like a girl by nature, and so “sassy” that we two were never on good terms, and had to fight it out about once every ten days. When we played a chess game one day, he placed a chessman as a “waiter,”—a cowardly tactic this,—and had hearty laugh on me by seeing me in a fix. His manner was so trying that time that I banged a chessman on his forehead which was injured a little bit and bled. He told all about this to father, who said he would disinherit me.","After my mother died, I went on living with the old man and my brother. The old man was the kind of guy who never did anything himself, but all he had to do was catch sight of you and he’d be telling you how you were no good at all. I still can’t figure out why he thought that way. One thing was for certain: I had a real character for an old man. My brother wanted to become a businessman and was always studying English. Anyway, he had that feminine streak and he was a sneak, so we didn’t get along. Every ten days or so we’d get into a fight. One time when we were playing chess he caught me with a really sneaky move and then sat there gloating and rubbing it in while I squirmed. I was so mad that I grabbed one of the pieces and threw it at him. It hit him right between the eyes, hard enough to draw blood. He went to tell on me to the old man, who announced that he was going to disinherit me."

会議室は校長室の隣りにある細長い部屋で、平常は食堂の代理を勤める。黒い皮で張った椅子が二十脚ばかり、長いテーブルの周囲に並んでちょっと神田の西洋料理屋ぐらいな格だ。そのテーブルの端に校長が坐って、校長の隣りに赤シャツが構える。あとは勝手次第に席に着くんだそうだが、体操の教師だけはいつも席末に謙遜するという話だ。おれは様子が分らないから、博物の教師と漢学の教師の間へはいり込んだ。向うを見ると山嵐と野だが並んでる。野だの顔はどう考えても劣等だ。喧嘩はしても山嵐の方が遥かに趣がある。おやじの葬式の時に小日向の養源寺の座敷にかかってた懸物はこの顔によく似ている。坊主に聞いてみたら韋駄天と云う怪物だそうだ。今日は怒ってるから、眼をぐるぐる廻しちゃ、時々おれの方を見る。そんな事で威嚇かされてたまるもんかと、おれも負けない気で、やっぱり眼をぐりつかせて、山嵐をにらめてやった。おれの眼は恰好はよくないが、大きい事においては大抵な人には負けない。あなたは眼が大きいから役者になるときっと似合いますと清がよく云ったくらいだ。,"The conference room is a long and narrow room next to the principal's room, and usually acts as a substitute for the dining room. There are only 20 chairs covered with black leather, and they are lined up around a long table, which is a bit like a Western restaurant in Kanda. The principal sits on the edge of the table, and a red shirt stands next to the principal. After that, it seems that they will take their seats on their own, but it is said that only gymnastics teachers are always humble at the end of the seat. I didn't know what was going on, so I stepped in between a natural history teacher and a Chinese language teacher. Looking over there, Yamaarashi and the field are lined up. The face of the field is inferior by any means. Even if there is a quarrel, the mountain storm is far more tasteful. The hangings on the tatami room of Yogenji Temple in Kohinata at the funeral of my father look a lot like this face. When I asked the shaven, it was a monster called Skanda. I'm angry today, so I turn my eyes around and sometimes look at me. I was intimidated by such a thing, and I felt like I wasn't defeated, so after all I gazed at the mountain storm. My eyes don't look good, but in big things they are as good as most people. Qing often said that you would look good as an actor because you have big eyes.","The meeting hall was a long, narrow room next to that of the principal, and was used for dining room. About twenty chairs, with black leather seat, were lined around a narrow table, and the whole scene looked like a restaurant in Kanda. At one end of the table the principal took his seat, and next to him Red Shirt. All the rest shifted for themselves, but the gymnasium teacher is said always to take the seat farthest down out of modesty. The situation was new to me, so I sat down between the teachers of natural history and of Confucius. Across the table sat Porcupine and Clown. Think how I might, the face of Clown was a degrading type. That of Porcupine was far more charming, even if I was now on bad terms with him. The panel picture which hung in the alcove of the reception hall of Yogen temple where I went to the funeral of my father, looked exactly like this Porcupine. A priest told me the picture was the face of a strange creature called Idaten. To-day he was pretty sore, and frequently stared at me with his fiery eyes rolling. “You can’t bulldoze me with that,” I thought, and rolled my own in defiance and stared back at him. My eyes are not well-shaped but their large size is seldom beaten by others. Kiyo even once suggested that I should make a fine actor because I had big eyes.","The conference was held in a long, narrow room next to the Principal’s office, which usually served as the faculty lunchroom. There were about twenty black leather chairs around a long table; it reminded me a little of one of those Western-style restaurants in the Kanda area back in Tokyo. At the head of the table sat the Principal, with Redshirt seated beside him. Everyone else was free to sit where they wanted, I was told, except that the physical education teacher always humbly took the seat at the foot of the table. Since I didn’t know what to do, I seated myself between the science teacher and the Chinese classics teacher. Right across from me were the Porcupine and the Hanger-on. There were no two ways about it: the Hanger’s face had ‘low-grade’ written all over it. The Porcupine’s was far more impressive-looking, even if he was my enemy now. It made me think of a face that I’d seen in a painting at the Yōgen Temple in Kobinata at my father’s funeral. The priest had explained that it was a picture of a Buddhist guardian god called Idaten. The Porcupine, still furious, was gazing wildly all around the room, his eyes gyrating in their sockets; when they landed on me, I glared right back – if he thought he was going to stare me down with that look, he’d have to think again – and rolled my eyes at him too for good measure. My eyes may not be much to look at, but when it comes to size, well, they’re just as big as the next guy’s, big enough, in fact, that Kiyo used to tell me I’d make a fine actor if I ever went on the Kabuki stage."
「もう大丈夫ですね。邪魔ものは追っ払ったから」正しく野だの声である。「強がるばかりで策がないから、仕様がない」これは赤シャツだ。「あの男もべらんめえに似ていますね。あのべらんめえと来たら、勇み肌の坊っちゃんだから愛嬌がありますよ」「増給がいやだの辞表を出したいのって、ありゃどうしても神経に異状があるに相違ない」おれは窓をあけて、二階から飛び下りて、思う様打ちのめしてやろうと思ったが、やっとの事で辛防した。二人はハハハハと笑いながら、瓦斯燈の下を潜って、角屋の中へはいった。,"""It's okay, because I've chased away the obstacles."" ""There is no specification because it just gets stronger and there is no plan."" This is a red shirt. ""That guy is similar to Beramee. If you come with that man, you'll be charming because he's a brave-skinned boy."" I didn't. ”I opened the window, jumped from the second floor, and tried to beat him as I wanted, but I finally managed to prevent it. They laughed hahahaha and went under the gas lamp and into the corner shop.","“Everything is all right now. We’ve got rid of the stumbling block.” It was undoubtedly the voice of Clown. “He only glories in bullying but has no tact.” This from Red Shirt. “He is like that young tough, isn’t he? Why, as to that young tough, he is a winsome, sporty Master Darling.” “I don’t want my salary raised, he says, or I want to tender resignation,—I’m sure something is wrong with his nerves.” I was greatly inclined to open the window, jump out of the second story and make them see more stars than they cared to, but I restrained myself with some effort. The two laughed, and passed below the gas light, and into Kadoya.","‘Now that we’ve got him out of the way, everything will be all right.’ There was no mistaking that voice: it was the Hanger-on. ‘He was all bluster, no brainpower, so what could you expect?’ This was Redshirt. ‘That other one is a real Tokyo character. Still just a youngster, but he does like to talk tough … Charming, isn’t it!’ ‘Saying he doesn’t want a raise, and trying to turn in his resignation … He must be mentally unbalanced, I’m sure of it.’ It was all I could do to keep myself from leaping straight down from the second floor and giving the two of them a good pounding right then and there. Laughing out loud, they walked through the light of the gas lamp and on into Kado-ya."

すると、いつの間にか傍へ来て坐った、野だが、鈴ちゃん逢いたい人に逢ったと思ったら、すぐお帰りで、お気の毒さまみたようでげすと相変らず噺し家みたような言葉使いをする。知りまへんと芸者はつんと済ました。野だは頓着なく、たまたま逢いは逢いながら……と、いやな声を出して義太夫の真似をやる。おきなはれやと芸者は平手で野だの膝を叩いたら野だは恐悦して笑ってる。この芸者は赤シャツに挨拶をした奴だ。芸者に叩かれて笑うなんて、野だもおめでたい者だ。鈴ちゃん僕が紀伊の国を踴るから、一つ弾いて頂戴と云い出した。野だはこの上まだ踴る気でいる。,"Then, before I knew it, I came to the side and sat down, but when I thought that I met a person who wanted to meet Suzu-chan, I went home immediately, and when I felt sorry for him, I used the wording as if I was at home. do. I didn't know and the geisha was done. Noda doesn't care, and while he happens to meet, he makes an unpleasant voice and imitates Gidayu. When Okinawa Hareya and the geisha hit the knees of the field with a flat hand, the field was terrified and laughed. This geisha is the one who greeted the red shirt. It's a congratulations to the field to be hit by a geisha and laugh. Suzu-chan I'm going to Kii no Kuni, so I asked him to play one. Noda still feels like he's going.","Clown who had come near us meanwhile, remarked in his flippant tone: “Hello, dear Miss Su-chan, too bad to see your beau go away so soon.” The geisha pouted, “I don’t know.” Clown, regardless, began imitating “gidayu” with a dismal voice,—“What a luck, when she met her sweet heart by a rare chance….” The geisha slapped the lap of Clown with a “Cut that out,” and Clown gleefully laughed. This geisha is the one who made goo-goo eyes[J] at Red Shirt. What a simpleton, to be pleased by the slap of a geisha, this Clown. He said: “Say, Su-chan, strike up the string. I’m going to dance the Kiino-kuni.” He seemed yet to dance.","Meanwhile the Hanger had come over and sat himself down next to her, saying ‘Oh, poor Suzu-chan – just when it seemed like she’d finally found that someone she was looking for, he goes right home!’ To this comment, which was delivered in the music-hall storyteller style he often affected, she sulkily replied ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ The Hanger, totally oblivious, went right on, this time in an awful imitation of the narrator in a puppet drama: ‘By chance did they meet, and yet … ’ The geisha squealed ‘Stop it!’ and slapped him on the knee; the Hanger-on beamed with delight. This was the same geisha that had said something to Redshirt before. Any man who could look so pleased when he got slapped by a geisha had to be a dolt. He wasn’t finished with his antics, either: ‘And now I’m going to dance “Kiinokuni” – Suzu-chan, play it for me please … ’ On the other side of the room the old Chinese classics teacher was contorting his toothless mouth as he squeezed out a passage from one of the puppet plays: ‘How can you say that, Denbei?"
それから増給事件と将来重く登用すると赤シャツが云った話をしたら山嵐はふふんと鼻から声を出して、それじゃ僕を免職する考えだなと云った。免職するつもりだって、君は免職になる気かと聞いたら、誰がなるものか、自分が免職になるなら、赤シャツもいっしょに免職させてやると大いに威張った。どうしていっしょに免職させる気かと押し返して尋ねたら、そこはまだ考えていないと答えた。山嵐は強そうだが、智慧はあまりなさそうだ。おれが増給を断わったと話したら、大将大きに喜んでさすが江戸っ子だ、えらいと賞めてくれた。,"Then, when he talked about the salary increase case and the red shirt saying that he would be promoted heavily in the future, Yamaarashi screamed out of his nose and said that he was thinking of dismissing me. When I asked him if he was going to be dismissed, he said he would be dismissed, and if he was dismissed, he would be dismissed with his red shirt. When I asked him why he wanted to dismiss him, he answered that he hadn't thought about it yet. Yamaarashi seems to be strong, but wisdom does not seem to be so much. When I told him that I refused to raise my salary, he was delighted by the general and praised him as an Edokko.","Then, when I disclosed to him about the raise of my salary and the advance hint on my promotion by Red Shirt, Porcupine pished, and said, “Then he means to discharge me.” “Means to discharge you? But you mean to get discharged?” I asked. “Bet you, no. If I get fired, Red Shirt will have to go with me,” he remarked with a lordly air. I insisted on knowing how he was going to get Red Shirt kicked out with him, and he answered that he had not thought so far yet. Yes, Porcupine looks strong, but seems to be possessed of no abundance of brain power. I told him about my refusal of the raise of my salary, and the Gov’nur was much pleased, praising me with the remark, “That’s the stuff for Yedo kids.”","Then I brought up the issues of my pay raise and Redshirt’s remarks about assigning me some heavier responsibilities. ‘In that case, he must be planning to get rid of me,’ the Porcupine said with a snort. When I asked him if he was willing to be relieved of his duties, he said absolutely not, and haughtily announced that if he was going to be relieved, he would make sure that Redshirt went with him. But when I came back at him with the question of just how he intended to get Redshirt relieved, he admitted that he hadn’t considered that part yet. The man certainly looked strong, but as far as brainpower went it seemed he didn’t have that much going for him. Then I explained how I had turned down that offer of a pay raise, which made him very happy: ‘Just leave it to an Edokko to pull off something like that!"
だまって聞いてると勝手な熱を吹く。沖へ行って肥料を釣ったり、ゴルキが露西亜ロシアの文学者だったり、馴染の芸者が松の木の下に立ったり、古池へ蛙が飛び込んだりするのが精神的娯楽なら、天麩羅を食って団子を呑み込むのも精神的娯楽だ。そんな下さらない娯楽を授けるより赤シャツの洗濯でもするがいい。あんまり腹が立ったから「マドンナに逢うのも精神的娯楽ですか」と聞いてやった。すると今度は誰も笑わない。妙な顔をして互に眼と眼を見合せている。赤シャツ自身は苦しそうに下を向いた。それ見ろ。利いたろう。ただ気の毒だったのはうらなり君で、おれが、こう云ったら蒼い顔をますます蒼くした。,"When I listen to it, I get a fever. If it's a spiritual pastime to go offshore to catch fertilizer, Gorki is a Russian-Russian literary writer, a familiar geisha stands under a pine tree, or a frog jumps into an old pond, eat tempura and eat dumplings. Swallowing is also a spiritual pastime. It's better to wash your red shirt than to give it that kind of entertainment. I was so angry that I asked, ""Is it a spiritual pastime to meet Madonna?"" Then no one laughs this time. They look at each other with strange faces. The red shirt itself looked down painfully. Look at it. It will work. The only thing I felt sorry for was Uranari-kun, and when I said this, my blue face became more and more blue.","There seemed no prospect that he would quit the hot air. If it was a mental consolation to fish fertilisers on the sea, have goruki for Russian literature, or to pose a favorite geisha beneath pine tree, it would be quite as much a mental consolation to eat dempura noodle and swallow dango. Instead of dwelling on such sham consolations, he would find his time better spent by washing his red shirts. I became so exasperated that I asked; “Is it also a mental consolation to meet the Madonna?” No one laughed this time and looked at each other with queer faces, and Red Shirt himself hung his head, apparently embarrassed. Look at that! A good shot, eh? Only I was sorry for Hubbard Squash who, having heard the remark, became still paler.","As we sat there in silence, Redshirt went on spouting this nonsense, carried away by the sound of his own voice. If going out to fish for fertilizer, making silly jokes about goruki and Russian writers, watching your favorite geisha stand under a pine tree, or making up haiku about frogs jumping into old ponds qualified as spiritual amusements, well, so did eating tempura and wolfing down dumplings. He should have gone and tried washing that red shirt of his instead of preaching to us about those stupid diversions of his. By now I was so angry that I asked him, ‘Is going to see the Madonna a spiritual amusement, too?’ This time nobody laughed. They just looked around at each other with a strange expression as their eyes met. As for Redshirt, he stood there with his head hanging down and a pained look on his face. Take that! Got you that time, didn’t I? The only one I felt a little sorry for was the Pale Squash, who had turned even paler than ever when he heard these words."
ところへ入口で若々しい女の笑声が聞えたから、何心なく振り返ってみるとえらい奴が来た。色の白い、ハイカラ頭の、背の高い美人と、四十五六の奥さんとが並んで切符を売る窓の前に立っている。おれは美人の形容などが出来る男でないから何にも云えないが全く美人に相違ない。何だか水晶の珠を香水で暖ためて、掌へ握ってみたような心持ちがした。年寄の方が背は低い。しかし顔はよく似ているから親子だろう。おれは、や、来たなと思う途端に、うらなり君の事は全然忘れて、若い女の方ばかり見ていた。すると、うらなり君が突然おれの隣から、立ち上がって、そろそろ女の方へ歩き出したんで、少し驚いた。マドンナじゃないかと思った。三人は切符所の前で軽く挨拶している。遠いから何を云ってるのか分らない。,"At the entrance, I heard a youthful woman laughing, so when I looked back, a great guy came. A tall beauty with a white, high-colored head and a forty-six wife stand side by side in front of a window selling tickets. I can't say anything because I'm not a man who can describe a beautiful woman, but I must be a beautiful woman at all. I felt like I warmed the crystal beads with perfume and held them in my palm. Older people are shorter. However, since their faces are very similar, they are probably parents and children. As soon as I thought I had come, I forgot about you at all and just looked at young women. Then, Uranari suddenly stood up from next to me and started walking toward the woman, so I was a little surprised. I thought it was Madonna. The three are greeting lightly in front of the ticket office. I don't know what you're talking about because it's far away.","Just then I heard some young girlish laughs at the entrance, and incidentally looking that way, I saw a “peach.” A beautiful girl, tall, white-skinned, with her head done up in “high-collared” style, was standing with a woman of about forty-five or six, in front of the ticket window. I am not a fellow given to describing a belle, but there was no need to repeat asserting that she was beautiful. I felt as if I had warmed a crystal ball with perfume and held it in my hand. The older woman was shorter, but as she resembled the younger, they might be mother and daughter. The moment I saw them, I forgot all about Hubbard Squash, and was intently gazing at the young beauty. Then I was a bit startled to see Hubbard Squash suddenly get up and start walking slowly toward them. I wondered if she was not the Madonna. The three were courtesying in front of the ticket window, some distance away from me, and I could not hear what they were talking about.","Just then a burst of youthful-sounding feminine laughter rang out by the entrance to the platform. I turned around for a quick look, and what I saw was really something: a gorgeous woman, tall and fair-skinned, with a stylish hairdo, standing at the ticket counter with a matronly-looking lady in her mid-forties. I’m not any good at describing what makes a woman gorgeous, so I won’t try, but this one was definitely absolutely gorgeous. Somehow just looking at her made me feel like I was cradling a ball of crystal that had been warmed in perfume in my palm. The older lady was shorter, but the resemblance in their faces was obvious: they had to be mother and daughter. From the instant I got that first stunning glimpse I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I had forgotten all about the Squash. But then, to my surprise, he suddenly got up and started walking over in the ladies’ direction. This, I realized, might be the Madonna. The three of them exchanged casual greetings by the ticket counter, but they were too far away for me to make out any of the conversation."

それから校長は、もう大抵ご意見もないようでありますから、よく考えた上で処分しましょうと云った。ついでだからその結果を云うと、寄宿生は一週間の禁足になった上に、おれの前へ出て謝罪をした。謝罪をしなければその時辞職して帰るところだったがなまじい、おれのいう通りになったのでとうとう大変な事になってしまった。それはあとから話すが、校長はこの時会議の引き続きだと号してこんな事を云った。生徒の風儀は、教師の感化で正していかなくてはならん、その一着手として、教師はなるべく飲食店などに出入しない事にしたい。もっとも送別会などの節は特別であるが、単独にあまり上等でない場所へ行くのはよしたい――たとえば蕎麦屋だの、団子屋だの――と云いかけたらまた一同が笑った。野だが山嵐を見て天麩羅と云って目くばせをしたが山嵐は取り合わなかった。いい気味だ。,"Then the principal said that he wouldn't have any opinions anymore, so he should think carefully before disposing of it. Then, as a result, the boarder was banned for a week and went out in front of me to apologize. If I didn't apologize, I would have resigned and went home at that time. I will talk about it later, but the principal said that it was a continuation of the meeting at this time. The style of the students must be corrected by the inspiration of the teacher, and as a first step, the teacher wants to avoid going in and out of restaurants as much as possible. The farewell party and other sections are special, but I don't want to go to a place that isn't very good alone-for example, a soba shop or a dumpling shop-and everyone laughed again. It was a field, but when I saw the mountain storm, I made a blind eye to it as tempura, but the mountain storm did not compete. It feels good.","After that the principal said that since it appeared that there will be no more opinions, he will consider the matter well and administer what he may deem a proper punishment. I may here add the result of the meeting. The students in the dormitory were given one week’s confinement, and in addition to that, apologized to me. If they had not apologized, I intended to resign and go straight home, but as it was it finally resulted in a bigger and still worse affair, of which more later. The principal then at the meeting said something to the effect that the manners of the students should be directed rightly by the teachers’ influence, and as the first step, no teacher should patronize, if possible, the shops where edibles and drinks were served, excepting, however, in case of farewell party or such social gatherings. He said he would like no teacher to go singly to eating houses of lower kind—for instance, noodle-house or dango shop…. And again all laughed. Clown looked at Porcupine, said “tempura” and winked his eyes, but Porcupine regarded him in silence. Good!","At that point the Principal announced that, as it appeared that everybody had now voiced their opinions, he would give them his full consideration before he took action. (What eventually happened, by the way, was that the dormitory students were confined to their quarters for a week, and they also offered me an apology, to my face. Considering how I had been prepared to hand in my resignation and go back home right then and there if they had not apologized, it actually might have been better if I hadn’t gotten my way, since things ended up getting so messy anyway, but I’ll explain about all that later.) The conference continued with the Principal offering the following comments: ‘Because it is incumbent upon the faculty to exert a positive influence on the student body by setting a proper moral example, I would like to request, as a first step, that teachers refrain from patronizing public eating and drinking establishments. Of course, exceptions can be made in the case of farewell banquets and other such official functions, but I would ask that you refrain from dining alone in places that are not particularly reputable – places such as noodle shops, for instance, or dumpling shops … ’ As soon as he mentioned these, everyone was laughing again. The Hanger-on glanced over at the Porcupine and murmured ‘tempura’ with a knowing look, but the Porcupine just ignored him. Served him right!"

昼飯を食ってから早速清へ手紙をかいてやった。おれは文章がまずい上に字を知らないから手紙を書くのが大嫌いだ。またやる所もない。しかし清は心配しているだろう。難船して死にやしないかなどと思っちゃ困るから、奮発して長いのを書いてやった。その文句はこうである。,"After having lunch, I immediately wrote a letter to Qing. I hate writing letters because the sentences are bad and I don't know the letters. There is no place to do it again. But Qing would be worried. I wasn't sure if I would die because of a difficult ship, so I rushed to write a long one. The phrase is this.","After luncheon I at once wrote a letter to Kiyo. I hate most to write letters because I am poor at sentence-making and also poor in my stock of words. Neither did I have any place to which to address my letters. However, Kiyo might be getting anxious. It would not do to let her worry lest she think the steamer which I boarded had been wrecked and I was drowned,—so I braced up and wrote a long one. The body of the letter was as follows:","After lunch I wrote a letter to Kiyo. I’m not much good at putting phrases together and I can’t remember how to write a lot of the words, so I hate writing letters. It’s not like there had ever been anybody that I had to write to, either, but I knew that Kiyo must be worrying about me. I wouldn’t want her to think that I had drowned in a shipwreck or anything, so I gave it everything I had and wrote her a good long one. This is what it said:"

しばらくすると、何だかぴくぴくと糸にあたるものがある。おれは考えた。こいつは魚に相違ない。生きてるものでなくっちゃ、こうぴくつく訳がない。しめた、釣れたとぐいぐい手繰り寄せた。おや釣れましたかね、後世恐るべしだと野だがひやかすうち、糸はもう大概手繰り込んでただ五尺ばかりほどしか、水に浸いておらん。船縁から覗いてみたら、金魚のような縞のある魚が糸にくっついて、右左へ漾いながら、手に応じて浮き上がってくる。面白い。水際から上げるとき、ぽちゃりと跳ねたから、おれの顔は潮水だらけになった。ようやくつらまえて、針をとろうとするがなかなか取れない。捕まえた手はぬるぬるする。大いに気味がわるい。面倒だから糸を振って胴の間へ擲きつけたら、すぐ死んでしまった。赤シャツと野だは驚ろいて見ている。おれは海の中で手をざぶざぶと洗って、鼻の先へあてがってみた。まだ腥臭い。もう懲り懲りだ。何が釣れたって魚は握りたくない。魚も握られたくなかろう。そうそう糸を捲いてしまった。,"After a while, there is something that hits the thread. I thought. This must be a fish. If it's not alive, there's no reason to stick to it. When I caught it, I pulled it in. Did you catch it? It's a wild thing to be scared of posterity, but while I'm afraid, I've already pulled in the thread and soaked it in water for only about 5 shaku. If you look from the edge of the ship, a striped fish like a goldfish sticks to the thread, and while squeezing to the left and right, it rises according to your hand. interesting. When I lifted it from the water's edge, it bounced so much that my face was full of seawater. I finally got stuck and tried to pick up the needle, but I couldn't get it. The caught hand is slimy. It's very creepy. It's a hassle, so I shook the thread and smashed it between my torso, and I died immediately. The red shirt and the field are looking surprised. I washed my hands in the sea and put it on the tip of my nose. It's still stinky. It's already disciplined. I don't want to catch a fish no matter what I catch. You don't want to be caught by fish either. I have wound the thread.","After a while something shook my line with successive jerks. I thought it must be a fish. Unless it was something living, it would not give that tremulous shaking. Good! I have it, and I commenced drawing in the line, while Clown jibed me “What? Caught one already? Very remarkable, indeed!” I had drawn in nearly all the line, leaving only about five feet in the water. I peeped over and saw a fish that looked like a gold fish with stripes was coming up swimming to right and left. It was interesting. On taking it out of the water, it wriggled and jumped, and covered my face with water. After some effort, I had it and tried to detach the hook, but it would not come out easily. My hands became greasy and the sense was anything but pleasing. I was irritated; I swung the line and banged the fish against the bottom of the boat. It speedily died. Red Shirt and Clown watched me with surprise. I washed my hands in the water but they still smelled “fishy.” No more for me! I don’t care what fish I might get , I don’t want to grab a fish. And I presume the fish doesn’t want to be grabbed either. I hastily rolled up the line.","By and by, I began to feel something pulling on the line. It had to be a fish, I thought to myself. Anything that could tug that hard would have to be alive. Gotcha! I started hauling it in as fast as I could. ‘Oh my, did you catch something? A classic case of beginner’s luck,’ said the Hanger in a mocking tone. I had pulled my line almost all the way back in; there were only a couple of feet left in the water. Peering over the side, I saw that what I had hooked was a striped fish that looked something like a goldfish. It was lunging this way and that as I hauled it up. Now this was fun! When I pulled it to the surface, it broke the water with splash, drenching my face into the bargain. Finally I managed to grab the thing and tried to take the hook out of its mouth, but this turned out to be no easy trick. It felt all slimy in my hand – yuck!! I just gave up and flung it down onto the floor of the boat, line and all, and it died almost immediately. Redshirt and the Hanger were watching all this with amazement. I scrubbed my hands with some seawater and took a sniff. They still had a fishy smell. I had learned my lesson: no matter what I caught, I wanted no part of holding it. The fish probably didn’t want any part of it either. I wound up my line right away."
ところへ待ちかねた、うらなり君が気の毒そうにはいって来て少々用事がありまして、遅刻致しましたと慇懃に狸に挨拶をした。では会議を開きますと狸はまず書記の川村君に蒟蒻版を配布させる。見ると最初が処分の件、次が生徒取締の件、その他二三ヶ条である。狸は例の通りもったいぶって、教育の生霊という見えでこんな意味の事を述べた。「学校の職員や生徒に過失のあるのは、みんな自分の寡徳の致すところで、何か事件がある度に、自分はよくこれで校長が勤まるとひそかに慚愧の念に堪えんが、不幸にして今回もまたかかる騒動を引き起したのは、深く諸君に向って謝罪しなければならん。しかしひとたび起った以上は仕方がない、どうにか処分をせんければならん、事実はすでに諸君のご承知の通りであるからして、善後策について腹蔵のない事を参考のためにお述べ下さい」,"I couldn't wait, but I felt sorry for you, and I had a little business, so I greeted Tanuki saying that I was late. Then, when the meeting is held, the raccoon dog first has the secretary Kawamura distribute the konjac version. Looking at it, the first is the disposition, the second is the student control, and a few other articles. As usual, the raccoon dog said something like this in the appearance of a living spirit of education. ""The fault of school staff and students is that everyone has their own virtue, and every time there is an incident, I often secretly endure the apology that the principal will work for this, but unfortunately. And this time again, I have to apologize deeply to you for causing such a turmoil. But once it happened, it can't be helped, I have to somehow dispose of it, the fact is already yours. As you know, please refer to the fact that you don't have a stomachache about good and bad measures. ""","Then the tardy Hubbard Squash apologetically entered, and politely explained that he was unavoidably detained. “Well, then the meeting is called to order,” said Badger. On these sheets was printed, first the question of the punishment of the offending students, second that of superintending the students, and two or three other matters. Badger, putting on airs as usual, as if he was an incarnation of education, spoke to the following effect. “Any misdeeds or faults among the teachers or the students in this school are due to the lack of virtues in my person, and whenever anything happens, I inwardly feel ashamed that a man like me could hold his position. Unfortunately such an affair has taken place again, and I have to apologize from my heart. But since it has happened, it cannot be helped; we must settle it one way or other. The facts are as you already know, and I ask you gentlemen to state frankly the best means by which the affair may be settled.”","Eventually the long-awaited Squash arrived, looking as pathetic as ever. He gave the Badger a ceremonious bow and apologized for being late, explaining that he had been unavoidably detained while attending to a certain matter. ‘ Well, then,’ declared the Badger, ‘I hereby call the meeting to order,’ and had Kawamura, the clerk, pass out copies of the mimeograph. The first item on the agenda was ‘Punishments’; then there was ‘Control of Students,’ followed by two or three other things. The Badger, in the stuffy tone he regularly adopted when presenting himself as the Spirit of Education personified, gave a speech that ran roughly as follows. ‘All instances of inappropriate conduct occurring at this school, be they committed by students or by instructors, are manifestations of a lack of virtue on my part. Whenever such an incident is reported, the sense of shame that I endure compels me to look deep within myself and question my own worthiness as a Principal. Unfortunately, gentlemen, I must come before you once again to humbly offer my profound apologies on account of yet another such disturbance. However, as that which has been done cannot be undone, appropriate measures must now be taken. Since the facts of the matter are already known to you, I hereby request that you assist me by informing me, in a frank and open manner, of your thoughts as to how the situation may best be rectified.’"
校長はひと通りおれの説明を聞いた。生徒の言草もちょっと聞いた。追って処分するまでは、今まで通り学校へ出ろ。早く顔を洗って、朝飯を食わないと時間に間に合わないから、早くしろと云って寄宿生をみんな放免した。手温るい事だ。おれなら即席に寄宿生をことごとく退校してしまう。こんな悠長な事をするから生徒が宿直員を馬鹿にするんだ。その上おれに向って、あなたもさぞご心配でお疲れでしょう、今日はご授業に及ばんと云うから、おれはこう答えた。「いえ、ちっとも心配じゃありません。こんな事が毎晩あっても、命のある間は心配にゃなりません。授業はやります、一晩ぐらい寝なくって、授業が出来ないくらいなら、頂戴した月給を学校の方へ割戻します」校長は何と思ったものか、しばらくおれの顔を見つめていたが、しかし顔が大分はれていますよと注意した。なるほど何だか少々重たい気がする。その上べた一面痒い。蚊がよっぽと刺したに相違ない。おれは顔中ぼりぼり搔きながら、顔はいくら膨れたって、口はたしかにきけますから、授業には差し支えませんと答えた。校長は笑いながら、大分元気ですねと賞めた。実を云うと賞めたんじゃあるまい、ひやかしたんだろう。,"The principal listened to my explanation. I also listened to the students' words. Go to school as usual until you dispose of it later. I had to wash my face early and eat breakfast in time, so I told them to do it early and released all the boarders. It's a warm thing. I would drop out of all boarders instantly. The students make a fool of the night shift because they do such a generous thing. On top of that, you're tired of worrying about me, and I'm saying I'm not going to class today, so I replied: ""No, I'm not worried at all. Even if this happens every night, I have to worry for the life of my life. I will do lessons. The principal was staring at my face for a while, but he cautioned that his face was largely swelling. I think it's a little heavy. On top of that, itching all over. The mosquito must have stung. As I shook my face, I replied that it would be okay for me to attend classes because my face was swollen and my mouth was certainly open. The principal laughed and praised him for being fine. To tell the truth","The principal listened to my explanation, and also to brief remarks from the students. “Attend school as usual till further notice. Hurry up with washing your face and breakfast; there isn’t much time left.” So the principal let go all the students. Decidedly slow way of handling, this. If I were the principal, I would expel them right away. It is because the school accords them such luke-warm treatment that they get “fresh” and start “guying” the night watch. He said to me that it must have been trying on my nerves, and that I might be tired, and also that I need not teach that day. To this I replied: “No, Sir, no worrying at all. Such things may happen every night, but it would not disturb me in the least as long as I breathe. I will do the teaching. If I were not able to teach on account of lack of sleep for only one single night, I would make a rebate of my salary to the school.” I do not know how this impressed him, but he gazed at me for a while, and called my attention to the fact that my face was rather swollen. Indeed, I felt it heavy. Besides, it itched all over. I was sure the mosquitoes must have stung me there to their hearts’ content. I further added: “My face may be swollen, but I can talk all right; so I will teach;” thus scratching my face with some warmth. The principal smiled and remarked, “Well, you have the strength.” To tell the truth, he did not intend remark to be a compliment, but, I think, a sneer.","I gave the Principal a general account of what had happened, and then he listened to a little of what the students had to say for themselves. He announced that he would take appropriate measures later, but meanwhile they should continue with their studies as usual. Then, after telling them to hurry up and get washed and have their breakfast because they’d be late for class if they didn’t get moving, he let them all go. This was being much too easy on them. If it had been up to me, I would have expelled them all on the spot. If they were going to be treated so leniently, why shouldn’t they harass a night duty teacher? Next the Principal turned to me and said that since I must be quite worn out from the strain, I would be excused from offering instruction today, to which I replied ‘No, sir, it was no strain at all. Even if this were to happen every night, I would never feel any strain over it for as long as I live. I will teach my classes. If I was ever unable to teach simply because of losing a night’s sleep, I’d return that portion of my salary to the school.’ The Principal just gazed at me for a couple of moments with an inscrutable expression; then he said ‘But your face looks quite swollen, you know.’ It was true, it did feel kind of heavy and a little numb. It was itching all over, too; the mosquitoes must have really worked it over. ‘ No matter how swollen my face is, my mouth is still working fine,’ I said, scratching away at it all the while. ‘There won’t be any problems with today’s classes.’ ‘Quite a sturdy fellow, aren’t you?’ he said with a laugh. This wasn’t really supposed to be a compliment, I think; it sounded kind of snide."
三年間まあ人並に勉強はしたが別段たちのいい方でもないから、席順はいつでも下から勘定する方が便利であった。しかし不思議なもので、三年立ったらとうとう卒業してしまった。自分でも可笑しいと思ったが苦情を云う訳もないから大人しく卒業しておいた。,"I studied like a person for three years, but I'm not a good person, so it was convenient to always count the seating order from the bottom. However, it was strange that I finally graduated after three years. I thought it was funny, but I couldn't complain, so I graduated quietly.","For three years I studied about as diligently as ordinary fellows, but not being of a particularly brilliant quality, my standing in the class was easier to find by looking up from the bottom. Strange, isn’t it, that when three years were over, I graduated? I had to laugh at myself, but there being no reason for complaint, I passed out.","For three years I studied about as hard as everybody else, but I wasn’t particularly good at it and if you looked for my name in the class rankings you would have had an easier time finding it if you started from the bottom. Still, incredible as it seemed, when the three years were up I managed to graduate. I couldn’t help thinking that it was kind of odd, but since it wouldn’t have made any sense to lodge a complaint, I accepted the diploma without protest."

He has a quiet face, does bad things, and when someone says something, he's waiting for an escape route, so it's a terrible thing. He had to be sanctioned by Tekken, and he rolled up his arm full of bumps. I'm incidental, so I asked if you could do Jiu-jitsu, which seems to be strong in your arms. Then I put a knuckle in the arm of Shoji and asked him to squeeze it a little, so when I rubbed it with my fingertips, it was like a pumice stone in a bathhouse.","I said; “The transfer of Koga is nothing but a trick of Red Shirt to cop the Madonna by sending Hubbard Squash away.” “Yes,” said Porcupine “That must be. Red Shirt looks gentle, but plays nasty tricks. He is a sonovagun for when some one finds fault with him, he has excuses prepared already. Nothing but a sound thumping will be effective for fellows like him.” He rolled up his sleeves over his plump arms as he spoke. I asked him, by the way, if he knew jiujitsu, because his arms looked powerful. Then he put force in his forearm, and told me to touch it. I felt its swelled muscle which was hard as the pumic stone in the public bathhouse.","The whole thing, I suggested, was probably nothing more than a scheme by Redshirt to get the Squash out of the picture so that he could get his hands on the Madonna himself. No doubt about it, said the Porcupine: that guy may look harmless enough, but he’s always got some cunning scheme up his sleeve, and when anybody calls him on it, he’s got his escape route all figured out in advance. A truly shifty customer. The only way to deal with somebody like that is to beat it out of him, he continued, rolling up his sleeve and showing me the muscles on his brawny arm. ‘Pretty powerful-looking,’ I said. ‘Do you practice jujitsu?’ ‘Just feel this,’ he said, and flexed his bicep. I gave it a squeeze. It felt as hard as the pumice stone that you rub your skin with at the bathhouse."
ところへ両隣りの机の所有主も出校したんで、赤シャツは早々自分の席へ帰って行った。赤シャツは歩るき方から気取ってる。部屋の中を往来するのでも、音を立てないように靴の底をそっと落す。音を立てないであるくのが自慢になるもんだとは、この時から始めて知った。泥棒の稽古じゃあるまいし、当り前にするがいい。やがて始業の喇叭がなった。山嵐はとうとう出て来ない。仕方がないから、一銭五厘を机の上へ置いて教場へ出掛けた。,"By the way, the owners of the desks on both sides also went to school, so the red shirt went back to his seat as soon as possible. The red shirt is pretending to be walking. Even if you come and go in the room, gently drop the bottom of your shoes so as not to make a noise. It was from this time that I knew that I was proud of not making noise. It's not a thief's practice, it's good to take it for granted. Eventually, there was a rush to start work. The mountain storm does not come out at last. I couldn't help it, so I put one coin on my desk and went to the school.","Meanwhile the occupants of the desks on both my sides came to the room, and Red Shirt hastily withdrew to his own desk. Red Shirt shows some air even in his walk. In stepping about the room, he places down his shoes so as to make no sound. For the first time I came to know that making no sound in one’s walk was something satisfactory to one’s vanity. He was not training himself for a burglar, I suppose. He should cut out such nonsense before it gets worse. Then the bugle for the opening of classes was heard. Porcupine did not appear after all. There was no other way but to leave the coins upon the desk and attend the class.","At this point the two teachers whose desks were on either side of mine arrived, so Redshirt beat a hasty retreat back to his own desk. Even his way of walking looked like an act: when he moved across the room he would take care to tread so lightly that he didn’t make a sound. It had never occurred to me before that walking silently might be something to feel proud of; unless you’re training to be a cat burglar, you might as well just do it in the ordinary way! When the bugle sounded for the first class, there was still no sign of the Porcupine. Since there was nothing else I could do, I simply left the money on my desk and went off to the classroom."
おやじはちっともおれを可愛がってくれなかった。母は兄ばかり贔屓にしていた。この兄はやに色が白くって、芝居の真似をして女形になるのが好きだった。おれを見る度にこいつはどうせ碌なものにはならないと、おやじが云った。乱暴で乱暴で行く先が案じられると母が云った。なるほど碌なものにはならない。ご覧の通りの始末である。行く先が案じられたのも無理はない。ただ懲役に行かないで生きているばかりである。,"My father didn't love me at all.

I'm just alive without going to jail.","Father did not like me in the least, and mother always sided with my big brother.

学校には宿直があって、職員が代る代るこれをつとめる。但し狸と赤シャツは例外である。何でこの両人が当然の義務を免かれるのかと聞いてみたら、奏任待遇だからと云う。面白くもない。月給はたくさんとる、時間は少ない、それで宿直を逃がれるなんて不公平があるものか。勝手な規則をこしらえて、それが当り前だというような顔をしている。よくまああんなにずうずうしく出来るものだ。これについては大分不平であるが、山嵐の説によると、いくら一人で不平を並べたって通るものじゃないそうだ。一人だって二人だって正しい事なら通りそうなものだ。山嵐mightisrightという英語を引いて説諭を加えたが、何だか要領を得ないから、聞き返してみたら強者の権利と云う意味だそうだ。強者の権利ぐらいなら昔から知っている。今さら山嵐から講釈をきかなくってもいい。強者の権利と宿直とは別問題だ。狸や赤シャツが強者だなんて、誰が承知するものか。議論は議論としてこの宿直がいよいよおれの番に廻って来た。一体疳性だから夜具蒲団などは自分のものへ楽に寝ないと寝たような心持ちがしない。小供の時から、友達のうちへ泊った事はほとんどないくらいだ。友達のうちでさえ厭なら学校の宿直はなおさら厭だ。厭だけれども、これが四十円のうちへ籠っているなら仕方がない。我慢して勤めてやろう。,"There is a night shift at the school, and the staff takes turns doing this. The exception is raccoon dogs and red shirts. When asked why these two people are exempt from their natural obligations, it is said that they are treated as scholars. Not interesting either. Is it unfair to get a lot of monthly salary, short time, and escape from the night shift? It has a selfish rule and looks like it is a matter of course. Well, it's something that can be done so tediously. I'm quite complaining about this, but according to Yamaarashi's theory, no matter how much I complain alone, I can't go through it. It seems that one person or two people will pass if the right thing is done. I added an explanation by drawing the English word ""Yamarashi might is right"", but it seems that it means the right of a strong man when I listen back to it because I don't get the point. I've known the rights of the strong man for a long time. You don't have to listen to the story from Yamaarashi anymore. The rights of the strong man and the night shift are separate issues. Who knows that raccoon dogs and red shirts are strong? As for the discussion, this night shift finally came to my turn. Bedding is a futon, so if you don't sleep comfortably on your own, you won't feel like sleeping. I have rarely stayed with my friends since I was a kid. Even among my friends, the school night shift is even worse. I don't mind, but if this is in the forty yen, it can't be helped. Let's put up with it and work.","For us teachers there was a duty of night watch in the school, and we had to do it in turn. But Badger and Red Shirt were not in it. On asking why these two were exempt from this duty, I was told that they were accorded by the government treatment similar to officials of “Sonin” rank. Oh, fudge! They were paid more, worked less, and were then excused from this night watch. It was not fair. They made regulations to suit their convenience and seemed to regard all this as a matter of course. How could they be so brazen faced as this! I was greatly dissatisfied relative to this question, but according to the opinion of Porcupine, protests by a single person, with what insistency they may be made, will not be heard. They ought to be heard whether they are made by one person or by two if they are just. Porcupine remonstrated with me by quoting “Might is right” in English. I did not catch his point, so I asked him again, and he told me that it meant the right of the stronger. If it was the right of the stronger I had known it for long, and did not require Porcupine explain that to me at this time. The right of the stronger was a question different from that of the night watch. Who would agree that Badger and Red Shirt were the stronger? But argument or no argument, the turn of this night watch at last fell upon me. Being quite fastidious, I never enjoyed sound sleep unless I slept comfortably in my own bedding. From my childhood, I never stayed out overnight. When I did not find sleeping under the roof of my friends inviting, night watch in the school, you may be sure, was still worse. However repulsive, if this was a part of the forty yen a month, there was no alternative. I had to do it.","Everyone on the staff had to take turns doing night duty at the school – everybody, that is, except for the Badger and Redshirt. When I asked why these two were excused from this obligation, the answer was that they, unlike the rest of us, were directly appointed to their positions by the Prime Minister. It was ridiculous: they had the biggest salaries and worked the shortest hours, and on top of that they got out of doing night duty – how unfair could you get? First they come up with some arbitrary rule, then they go around acting as if it’s only natural. Of all the nerve! I was really upset about it, but according to the Porcupine no matter how long a list of grievances I came up with I wouldn’t be able to do anything about them. You’d think that as long as they were legitimate you should be able to do something about them, even if you were only a minority of one or two. The Porcupine used an English expression, ‘Might is right,’ to make his point, but I wasn’t sure what the point was supposed to be, so he explained that it meant that the people with the power get their way. That principle I already knew; I hardly needed the Porcupine to deliver a lecture on the subject. But that was a whole different issue from night duty. How could anybody respect the ‘power’ of people like the Badger and Redshirt? Anyway, regardless of this debate, my turn to do night duty came around eventually. Now, being the high-strung type that I am, I just can’t get a good night’s sleep if I don’t sleep in my own bedding. Even when I was a kid, I hardly ever slept over with my friends. Since I could barely stand to sleep at my friends’ places, I felt even worse about spending the night at school. But no matter how bad I felt, this was part of what they were paying me those forty yen for, so I just had to tough it out. Once the other teachers and the day students had gone home, there was nothing for me to do but sit around by myself, which felt kind of silly."
停車場の時計を見るともう五分で発車だ。早く汽車がくればいいがなと、話し相手が居なくなったので待ち遠しく思っていると、また一人あわてて場内へ馳け込んで来たものがある。見れば赤シャツだ。何だかべらべら然たる着物へ縮緬の帯をだらしなく巻き付けて、例の通り金鎖りをぶらつかしている。あの金鎖りは贋物である。赤シャツは誰も知るまいと思って、見せびらかしているが、おれはちゃんと知ってる。赤シャツは馳け込んだなり、何かきょろきょろしていたが、切符売下所の前に話している三人へ慇懃にお辞儀をして、何か二こと、三こと、云ったと思ったら、急にこっちへ向いて、例のごとく猫足にあるいて来て、や君も湯ですか、僕は乗り後れやしないかと思って心配して急いで来たら、まだ三四分ある。あの時計はたしかかしらんと、自分の金側を出して、二分ほどちがってると云いながら、おれの傍へ腰を卸した。女の方はちっとも見返らないで杖の上に顋をのせて、正面ばかり眺めている。年寄の婦人は時々赤シャツを見るが、若い方は横を向いたままである。いよいよマドンナに違いない。,"Looking at the clock at the stop, it's already five minutes away. I was looking forward to the train because there was no one to talk to, and there was one who rushed into the hall again. If you look at it, it's a red shirt. I wrap a crepe sash around a kimono that is somewhat sloppy, and hang around a gold chain as usual. That gold chain is a fake. I'm showing off my red shirt because I don't think anyone knows it, but I know it. The red shirt was sloppy, and I was wandering around, but when I bowed to the three people talking in front of the ticket office, I thought I said something two or three. Suddenly I headed over here and came to my clawfoot as usual, and I was worried that I might miss the ride, and I hurried, but it's still 34 minutes. I'm sure that watch put out my money side, and while saying that it was about two minutes different, I wholesaled my waist to my side. The woman does not look back at all, puts a sword on the cane, and looks only at the front. Older women sometimes look at red shirts, while younger ones remain sideways. It must be Madonna at last.","The clock at the station showed the next train to start in five minutes. Having lost my partner, I became impatient and longed for the train to start as soon as possible, when a fellow rushed into the station excited. It was Red Shirt. He had on some fluffy clothes, loosely tied round with a silk-crepe girdle, and wound to it the same old gold chain. That gold chain is stuffed. Red Shirt thinks nobody knows it and is making a big show of it, but I have been wise. Red Shirt stopped short, stared around, and then after bowing politely to the three still in front of the ticket window, made a remark or two, and hastily turned toward me. He came up to me, walking in his usual cat’s style, and hallooed. “You too going to bath? I was afraid of missing the train and hurried up, but we have three or four minutes yet. Wonder if that clock is right?” He took out his gold watch, and remarking it wrong about two minutes sat down beside me. He never turned toward the belle, but with his chin on the top of a cane, steadily looked straight before him. The older woman would occasionally glance toward Red Shirt, but the younger kept her profile away. Surely she was the Madonna.","I looked at the station clock and saw that we still had another five minutes to wait. Since I no longer had anyone to talk to, I was hoping that the train would come as soon as possible. Just then another passenger came hurrying into the station. It was Redshirt. He was wearing some kind of thin silk kimono with a carelessly wound crepe sash, with his gold watch chain dangling from it as usual. This item was a fake. Redshirt thought that nobody could tell and was always showing it off, but he couldn’t fool me. As he dashed in, he looked nervously around the station, but when he saw the threesome talking in front of the ticket counter he gave them a polite bow and seemed to be exchanging a couple of words with them, but then he suddenly turned and floated over to where I was sitting with that little-cat-feet walk of his. ‘ Ah,’ he said, ‘so you’re off to the springs, too? I was afraid I might miss the train so I rushed over, but I see that we still have a few minutes. I wonder if that clock is right … ’ As he pulled out his gold pocket watch and announced that there was two minutes’ difference between it and the station clock, he took a seat beside me. Without so much as a glance back toward the ladies, he rested his chin on top of his walking stick and kept his gaze fixed straight ahead. The older lady looked over at him from time to time, but the young one never faced his way. Now I was sure she was the Madonna."
芸者が来たら座敷中急に陽気になって、一同が鬨の声を揚げて歓迎したのかと思うくらい、騒々しい。そうしてある奴はなんこを攫む。その声の大きな事、まるで居合抜の稽古のようだ。こっちでは拳を打ってる。よっ、はっ、と夢中で両手を振るところは、ダーク一座の操人形よりよっぽど上手だ。向うの隅ではおいお酌だ、と徳利を振ってみて、酒だ酒だと言い直している。どうもやかましくて騒々しくってたまらない。そのうちで手持無沙汰に下を向いて考え込んでるのはうらなり君ばかりである。自分のために送別会を開いてくれたのは、自分の転任を惜んでくれるんじゃない。みんなが酒を呑んで遊ぶためだ。自分独りが手持無沙汰で苦しむためだ。こんな送別会なら、開いてもらわない方がよっぽどましだ。,"When the geisha came, it suddenly became cheerful during the tatami room, and it was so noisy that everyone greeted them with a battle cry. Then somebody kidnaps him. The loud thing about that voice is like a practice without Iai. I'm hitting my fist here. By the way, the place where I waving my hands crazy is much better than the dark troupe puppets. In the other corner, he tried to shake the sake bottle, saying that it was a sake bottle, and rephrased it as sake. I'm dying to be noisy and noisy. Of these, the only one who is thinking down on his own is Uranari. Having a farewell party for me doesn't mean I'm sorry for my transfer. This is because everyone drinks and plays. This is because I am suffering from a lack of possession. If it's such a farewell party, it's better not to have it held.","The sight of the geishas set the room immediately in a buzz and it became noisy as they all raised howls of welcome. Some started the game of “nanko” with a force that beat the sword-drawing practice. Others began playing morra, and the way they shook their hands, intently absorbed in the game, was a better spectacle than a puppet show. One in the corner was calling “Hey, serve me here,” but shaking the bottle, corrected it to “Hey, fetch me more sake.” The whole room became so infernally noisy that I could scarcely stand it. Amid this orgy, one, like a fish out of water, sat down with his head bowed. It was Hubbard Squash. The reason they have held this farewell dinner party was not in order to bid him a farewell, but because they wanted to have a jolly good time for themselves with John Barleycorn. He had come to suffer only. Such a dinner party would have been better had it not been started at all.","With the arrival of the geisha the atmosphere immediately got very jolly indeed, and the noise level shot way up as well : it sounded like everybody was shouting at once to welcome the ladies into the fun. One guy tried to play some kind of guessing game with them, yelling at the top of his lungs, the way fencers in a quick-draw contest do when they’re trying to intimidate the opposition. Closer to me some other guys were totally engrossed in a game of Odd or Even, screaming and wiggling their hands so deftly they could have put the marionettes in a puppet show to shame. In a far corner somebody was shouting ‘Hey, c’mon over here and pour me a drink!’ As he waved his flask around he must have noticed it was empty, and switched his demand to ‘Hey, more saké! More saké!’ All this yelling and commotion was just too much for me. And in the midst of it all one person sat there at a loss as to what to do with himself, eyes cast downward, sunk deep in thought. This was the Squash. The reason they were giving him this farewell banquet wasn’t because they were sad to see him go. It was to give themselves an excuse to drink and have some fun. It was to make him feel miserable, sitting there alone, not knowing what to do with himself. If this was the best they could do by way of a farewell party, he would have been much better off if they hadn’t bothered at all."

君釣りに行きませんかと赤シャツがおれに聞いた。赤シャツは気味の悪るいように優しい声を出す男である。まるで男だか女だか分りゃしない。男なら男らしい声を出すもんだ。ことに大学卒業生じゃないか。物理学校でさえおれくらいな声が出るのに、文学士がこれじゃ見っともない。,"A red shirt asked me if you would like to go fishing. The red shirt is a man who makes a creepy and gentle voice. I don't know if it's a man or a woman. A man makes a manly voice. Especially a college graduate. Even in the physics school, I can hear my voice, but the literary scholar doesn't see it.","“Won’t you go fishing?” asked Red Shirt He talks in a strangely womanish voice. One would not be able to tell whether he was a man or a woman. As a man he should talk like one. Is he not a college graduate? I can talk man-like enough, and am a graduate from a school of physics at that. It is a shame for a B.A. to have such a squeak.","‘How would you like to do a little fishing?’ Redshirt asked me. His tone of voice was so gentle that it made you feel creepy. You could hardly tell whether it was a man’s voice or a woman’s. If you’re a man, you should talk like one – all the more so if you’re a university graduate. If somebody like me, who only went to the Institute of Physical Sciences, can have the kind of voice I do, it was really a disgrace for a man with a university degree to talk the way he did."

I once broke the carrot field of Shigeru with the carpenter Kaneko and the corner of the appetizer. Straw was spread all over the place where the carrot buds did not come out, so when the three people continued to wrestle for half a day, all the carrots were trampled. Furukawa's well in the rice field was buried and his ass was brought in. It was a mechanism that water sprang up from the deeply buried section of the thick Meng Zong, and the rice was spilled over there. I don't know what kind of work in process it was at that time, so I inserted stones and sticks into the well, saw that the water had run out, and when I returned home and ate rice, Furukawa turned bright red. I was yelling at you. It seems that he has paid a fine.","Besides the above, I did many other mischiefs. With Kaneko of a carpenter shop and Kaku of a fishmarket, I once ruined a carrot patch of one Mosaku. The sprouts were just shooting out and the patch was covered with straws to ensure their even healthy growth. Upon this straw-covered patch, we three wrestled for fully half a day, and consequently thoroughly smashed all the sprouts. Also I once filled up a well which watered some rice fields owned by one Furukawa, and he followed me with kicks. The well was so devised that from a large bamboo pole, sunk deep into the ground, the water issued and irrigated the rice fields. Ignorant of the mechanical side of this irrigating method at that time, I stuffed the bamboo pole with stones and sticks, and satisfied that no more water came up, I returned home and was eating supper when Furukawa, fiery red with anger, burst into our house with howling protests. I believe the affair was settled on our paying for the damage.","That wasn’t all – I got into lots of other trouble as well. There was the time when I got together with Kane-kō the carpenter’s son and Kaku the fish peddler’s son and wrecked old Mosaku’s carrot patch. He had left some straw spread out on a piece of ground where the carrots hadn’t all come up yet, so the three of us used it as a sumo ring. We wrestled there for hours, and by the time we were through the carrots were all trampled flat. Another time I plugged up the water pipe in the Furukawas’ rice paddy. They had a thick tube of hollowed-out bamboo buried deep in the ground with water coming out of it to irrigate the rice plants. I didn’t know what it was there for, and one day I stuffed the opening full of rocks and twigs until the water stopped coming out. Later, when I was back home eating dinner, old Mr Furukawa burst in. He was yelling so hard he turned red in the face. As I recall, my parents had to pay him some money to make up for it."

おれは教頭に向って、まだ誰にも話さないが、これから山嵐と談判するつもりだと云ったら、赤シャツは大いに狼狽して、君そんな無法な事をしちゃ困る。僕は堀田君の事について、別段君に何も明言した覚えはないんだから――君がもしここで乱暴を働いてくれると、僕は非常に迷惑する。君は学校に騒動を起すつもりで来たんじゃなかろうと妙に常識をはずれた質問をするから、当り前です、月給をもらったり、騒動を起したりしちゃ、学校の方でも困るでしょうと云った。すると赤シャツはそれじゃ昨日の事は君の参考だけにとめて、口外してくれるなと汗をかいて依頼に及ぶから、よろしい、僕も困るんだが、そんなにあなたが迷惑ならよしましょうと受け合った。君大丈夫かいと赤シャツは念を押した。どこまで女らしいんだか奥行がわからない。文学士なんて、みんなあんな連中ならつまらんものだ。辻褄の合わない、論理に欠けた注文をして恬然としている。しかもこのおれを疑ぐってる。憚りながら男だ。受け合った事を裏へ廻って反古にするようなさもしい了見はもってるもんか。,"I'm heading to the vice-principal and I haven't told anyone yet, but if I said I was going to talk to Yamaarashi, the red shirt would be very upset and you wouldn't want to do such an illegal thing. I don't remember telling you anything about Hotta-I would be very annoyed if you worked violently here. You ask a strangely out-of-the-ordinary question that you didn't intend to make a fuss at school, so it's natural that you get a monthly salary or make a fuss, and even the school will be in trouble. rice field. Then, the red shirt will only be your reference yesterday, and I will sweat and ask you not to talk about it, so it's okay, I'm in trouble, but if you're so annoying I received it. The red shirt reminded me that you're okay. I don't know how feminine it is. Bachelor of letters is boring for all those guys. I am stunned to make an order that does not match Tsuji and lacks logic. Moreover, I doubt this. He is a man with regret. Do you have a lonely understanding that you can turn the things you have received to the back and make them antiquated?","I told the head teacher that I had not divulged the secret to anybody but was going to fight it out with Porcupine. Red Shirt was greatly perturbed, and stuttered out; “Say, don’t do anything so rash as that. I don’t remember having stated anything plainly to you about Mr. Hotta……. if you start a scrimmage here, I’ll be greatly embarrassed.” And he asked the strangely outlandish question if I had come to the school to start trouble? Of course not, I said, the school would not stand for my making trouble and pay me salary for it. Red Shirt then, perspiring, begged me to keep the secret as mere reference and never mention it. “All right, then,” I assured him, “this robs me shy, but since you’re so afraid of it, I’ll keep it all to myself.” “Are you sure?” repeated Red Shirt. There was no limit to his womanishness. If Red Shirt was typical of Bachelors of Arts, I did not see much in them. He appeared composed after having requested me to do something self-contradictory and wanting logic, and on top of that suspects my sincerity. “Don’t you mistake,” I said to myself, “I’m a man to the marrow, and haven’t the idea of breaking my own promises; mark that!”","That’s the kind of attitude you would expect from a real Assistant Principal, and that’s the kind of attitude that would have entitled him to wear that red shirt of his. When I told him I hadn’t said a thing to anybody so far but I did intend to have things out with the Porcupine when he arrived, Redshirt looked terribly upset: ‘No. That would be wrong and it would lead to problems. As far as Mr Hotta is concerned, I don’t recall saying anything specific to you. If you do something rash now, it will put me in a very difficult position. I assume that you didn’t join our staff in order to be a troublemaker.’ All I  could offer in reply to this strange bit of gibberish was that of course I realized that it wouldn’t be good for the school if somebody on its payroll started stirring up trouble. Well then, he said, please just keep yesterday’s discussion between us, and don’t mention it to anybody. By this point he had broken into a sweat. All right, I agreed, this won’t be easy for me either, but if it’s going to create such a problem for you, I won’t do it. ‘So I can count on you, then?’ he asked insistently. It was hard to tell how far beyond skin deep that soft, feminine manner of his went. If all college graduates were like this, they didn’t amount to much. He didn’t seem to have the slightest idea how little sense he was making, how illogical he sounded with these requests of his – and yet he still couldn’t bring himself to take me at my word? If nothing else, I’m a man. How could I ever go so low as to turn my back on someone and break a commitment I had made?"

それからかなりゆるりと、出たりはいったりして、ようやく日暮方になったから、汽車へ乗って古町の停車場まで来て下りた。学校まではこれから四丁だ。訳はないとあるき出すと、向うから狸が来た。狸はこれからこの汽車で温泉へ行こうと云う計画なんだろう。すたすた急ぎ足にやってきたが、擦れ違った時おれの顔を見たから、ちょっと挨拶をした。すると狸はあなたは今日は宿直と真面目くさって聞いた。なかったですかねえもないもんだ。二時間前おれに向って今夜は始めての宿直ですね。ご苦労さま。と礼を云ったじゃないか。校長なんかになるといやに曲りくねった言葉を使うもんだ。おれは腹が立ったから、ええ宿直です。宿直ですから、これから帰って泊る事はたしかに泊りますと云い捨てて済ましてあるき出した。竪町の四つ角までくると今度は山嵐に出っ喰わした。どうも狭い所だ。出てあるきさえすれば必ず誰かに逢う。「おい君は宿直じゃないか」と聞くから「うん、宿直だ」と答えたら、「宿直が無暗に出てあるくなんて、不都合じゃないか」と云った。「ちっとも不都合なもんか、出てあるかない方が不都合だ」と威張ってみせた。「君のずぼらにも困るな、校長か教頭に出逢うと面倒だぜ」と山嵐に似合わない事を云うから「校長にはたった今逢った。暑い時には散歩でもしないと宿直も骨でしょうと校長が、おれの散歩をほめたよ」と云って、面倒臭いから、さっさと学校へ帰って来た。,"After that, I went in and out quite slowly, and finally it was nightfall, so I took a train and came down to the Furumachi stop. It's four from now on until school. When I started to say that there was no reason, a raccoon came from the other side. The raccoon dog is planning to go to the hot spring by this train from now on. I came in a hurry, but when I rubbed against each other, I saw my face, so I greeted him a little. Then the raccoon heard that you were serious about the night shift today. Wasn't it? Two hours ago, it's my first night shift tonight. Thank you for your hard work. Didn't you say thank you? When I become a principal, I use awkward words. I'm angry, so I'm a night shift. Since I am a night shift, I said that I will definitely stay when I come back from now on, and I have already thrown it away. When I came to the four corners of Vertical Town, I ran into a mountain storm this time. It's a small place. As long as you're out, you'll definitely meet someone. When I asked, ""Hey, you're a night shift,"" and answered, ""Yeah, it's a night shift,"" he said, ""Isn't it inconvenient for the night shift to appear in the dark?"" ""It's a little inconvenient, or it's inconvenient if it doesn't appear,"" he said. ""Don't worry about your slack, it's a hassle to meet the principal or the vice-principal,"" he said. I praised my walk, ""he said, and he quickly returned to school because of the annoying smell.","I took plenty of time in dipping in the bath and as it became dark at last, I came to the Furumachi Station on a train. It was only about four blocks to the school; I could cover it in no time. When I started walking schoolwards, Badger was seen coming from the opposite direction. Badger, I presumed, was going to the hot springs by this train. He came with brisk steps, and as we passed by, I nodded my courtesy. Then Badger, with a studiously owlish countenance, asked: “Am I wrong to understand that you are night watch?” Chuck that “Am-I-wrong-to-understand”! Two hours ago, did he not say to me “You’re on first night watch to-night. Now, take care of yourself?” What makes one use such a roundabout, twisted way of saying anything when he becomes a principal? I was far from smiling. “Yes, Sir,” I said, “I’m night watch to-night, and as I am night watch I will return to the school and stay there overnight, sure.” With this parting shot, I left him where we met. Coming then to the cross-streets of Katamachi, I met Porcupine. This is a narrow place, I tell you. Whenever one ventures out, he is sure to come across some familiar face. “Say, aren’t you night watch?” he hallooed, and I said “Yes, I am.” “Tis wrong for night watch to leave his post at his pleasure,” he added, and to this I blurted out with a bold front; “Nothing wrong at all. It is wrong not to go out.” “Say, old man, your slap-dash is going to the limit. Wouldn’t look well for the principal or the head teacher to see you out like this.” The submissive tone of his remark was contrary to Porcupine as I had known him so far, so I cut him short by saying: “I have met the principal just now. Why, he approved my taking a stroll about the town. Said it would be hard on night watch unless he took a walk when it is hot.” Then I made a bee-line for the school.","I took my time and had a nice, leisurely soak. I finally took the train back to town just as evening was coming on and headed back to school, which was a couple of hundred yards from the station. Just when I was thinking that everything had worked out fine, I noticed the Badger walking down the street toward me. He must have been planning to take the train to the hot spring himself. He was moving along at a pretty brisk pace, but as we passed each other he realized it was me, so I gave him a quick bow. ‘Ah, now as far as I can recall, weren’t you supposed to be on duty tonight?’ he asked in an official-sounding tone. There was no need for him to be coy about it – he knew full well that only two hours earlier he had walked over to me and said ‘Ah, tonight’s your first turn on night duty, isn’t it?’ and thanked me in advance. It seemed as if expressing yourself in this annoyingly roundabout way was one of the job requirements for being a Principal. Now I was good and angry, so I simply announced ‘Yes, sir, I am on night duty. And that is why I am on my way to school, which is where, you may be certain, I will be spending the night.’ Then I turned on my heel and walked away. But when I got to the corner at Tatemachi it was the Porcupine’s turn to cross my path. This really was a small town – all you had to do was head out the door and you’d be sure to run into somebody or other. ‘Hey, aren’t you on night duty?’ he asked. ‘Yeah, I am,’ I said. ‘Well,’ he went on, ‘don’t you think it’s improper for the night duty teacher to go out for a stroll?’ ‘Not at all,’ I said, with a show of dignity. ‘In fact, it would be improper not to go out for a stroll.’ ‘You could get yourself into some real trouble with that kind of attitude, you know – especially if you happen to run into the Principal or the Assistant Principal,’ he said. That was hardly the kind of thing I expected to hear from the Porcupine of all people, so this time I let him have it: ‘Well, in fact I just did run into the Principal. And he said it was a good idea to go out for a walk, because if you didn’t, night duty would be an awful grind when it’s so hot.’ Then, since there was no point in talking about it any further, I turned and walked back to school."
