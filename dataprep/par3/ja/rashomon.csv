下人は、老婆の答が存外、平凡なのに失望した。そうして失望すると同時に、また前の憎悪が、冷やかな侮蔑ぶべつと一しょに、心の中へはいって来た。すると、その気色けしきが、先方へも通じたのであろう。老婆は、片手に、まだ死骸の頭から奪った長い抜け毛を持ったなり、蟇ひきのつぶやくような声で、口ごもりながら、こんな事を云った。,"The servant was disappointed, though the old woman's answer was surprisingly mediocre. At the same time as I was disappointed, the previous hatred came into my heart with a cold contempt. Then, that disgusting feeling would have led to the other party as well. The old woman, with a long hair loss still stolen from the corpse's head in one hand, said this with a muttering voice.","The servant was startled, and disappointed at how ordinary the woman’s answer turned out to be. But along with his disappointment, the earlier hatred and a cold contempt came back to fill his heart. The woman seemed to sense what he was feeling. Still holding in one hand the long hairs she had stolen from the corpse, she mumbled and croaked like a toad as she offered this explanation:","The servant was disappointed that the old woman's answer was so unexpectedly dull. Along with the disappointment, those old feelings of hatred and contempt came flooding back to him. And somehow, he must have conveyed these feelings to the old woman. With the hairs she had stolen from the corpse still clutched in one hand, she mumbled in a raspy, toadish voice:","Her answer banished all unknown from their encounter and brought disappointment. Suddenly she was only a trembling old woman there at his feet. A ghoul no longer: only a hag who makes wigs from the hair of the dead — to sell, for scraps of food. A cold contempt seized him. Fear left his heart, and his former hatred entered. These feelings must have been sensed by the other. The old creature, still clutching the hair she had pulled off the corpse, mumbled out these words in her harsh broken voice:"
下人は、大きな嚔くさめをして、それから、大儀たいぎそうに立上った。夕冷えのする京都は、もう火桶ひおけが欲しいほどの寒さである。風は門の柱と柱との間を、夕闇と共に遠慮なく、吹きぬける。丹塗にぬりの柱にとまっていた蟋蟀きりぎりすも、もうどこかへ行ってしまった。,"The servant made a big cry and then stood up in a big way. Kyoto, which is chilly in the evening, is so cold that I want a brazier. The wind blows between the pillars of the gate without hesitation with the dusk. The crickets that were perched on the pillars of Tannuri have already gone somewhere.","The man gave a great sneeze and dragged himself to his feet. The Kyoto evening chill was harsh enough to make him yearn for a brazier full of warm coals. Darkness fell, and the wind blew unmercifully through the pillars of the gate. Now even the cricket was gone from its perch on the red-lacquered pillar.","The servant sneezed, and he stood up wearily. Kyoto—so chilly in the evening—was already cold enough that he wished he had a brazier. The wind and the darkness blew mercilessly between the pillars of the gate. The katydid that had been sitting on the red pillar was long gone.",After a loud fit of sneezing he got up slowly. The evening chill of Kyo¯to made him long for the warmth of a brazier. The wind in the evening dusk howled through the columns of the gate. The cricket which had been perched on the crimsonlacquered column was already gone.
雨は、羅生門をつつんで、遠くから、ざあっと云う音をあつめて来る。夕闇は次第に空を低くして、見上げると、門の屋根が、斜につき出した甍の先に、重たくうす暗い雲を支えている。,"The rain wraps around Rashomon and gathers a buzzing sound from a distance. The dusk gradually lowered the sky, and when I looked up, the roof of the gate supported a heavy, dark cloud at the tip of the sloping sword.","The rain carried a host of roaring sounds from afar as it came to envelop the Rashōmon. The evening darkness brought the sky ever lower until the roof of the gate was supporting dark, heavy clouds on the ridge of its jutting tiles.","As he tried to piece together his wandering thoughts, he listened pensively to the sound of the rain falling on Suzaku Boulevard. The rain engulfed Rashōmon, and gales of rain from far away pounded down upon the gate with a tremendous noise. The darkness of night gradually set in from above, and if you were to look up, it might seem as if the large, gloomy clouds were suspended from the ends of the tiles that jutted out from the roof of the gate.","The rain, enveloping the Rashomon, gathered strength and came down with a pelting sound that could be heard far away. Looking up, he saw a fat black cloud impale itself on the tips of the tiles jutting out from the roof of the gate."
下人は、頸くびをちぢめながら、山吹やまぶきの汗袗かざみに重ねた、紺の襖あおの肩を高くして門のまわりを見まわした。雨風の患うれえのない、人目にかかる惧おそれのない、一晩楽にねられそうな所があれば、そこでともかくも、夜を明かそうと思ったからである。すると、幸い門の上の楼へ上る、幅の広い、これも丹を塗った梯子はしごが眼についた。上なら、人がいたにしても、どうせ死人ばかりである。下人はそこで、腰にさげた聖柄ひじりづかの太刀たちが鞘走さやばしらないように気をつけながら、藁草履わらぞうりをはいた足を、その梯子の一番下の段へふみかけた。,"The servant looked around the gate with his navy blue fusuma blue shoulders raised, which was layered on the sweat-covered Japanese kerria and the Japanese kerria, while his neck was squeezed. If there was a place that wouldn't be affected by the rain and wind, that wouldn't be noticeable, and that could be easily hit overnight, I wanted to dawn anyway. Fortunately, I saw a wide, tan-painted ladder ladder that went up to the tower above the gate. Above, even if there are people, they are all dead. There, the servant puts his feet in straw sandals to the bottom of the ladder, being careful not to let the swords of the sacred pattern Hijirizuka on his waist scabbard. I sprinkled it.","Beneath his blue robe and yellow undershirt, the man hunched his shoulders and drew his head down as he scanned the area around the gate. If only there were some place out of the wind and rain, with no fear of prying eyes, where I could have an untroubled sleep, I would stay there until dawn, he thought. Just then he caught sight of a broad stairway—also lacquered red—leading to the upper story of the gate. Anybody up there is dead. Taking care lest his sword, with its bare wooden handle, slip from its scabbard, the man set one straw-sandaled foot on the bottom step. A few minutes later, halfway up the broad stairway, he crouched, cat-like, holding his breath as he took stock of the gate’s upper chamber.","The servant tucked his head into his chest, hunched up his shoulders—clad in the blue kimono he wore over his thin yellow underclothes—and looked around the gate. ""If there is a place where I won't be bothered by the wind or the rain… a place where I won't be seen… a place where it looks like I can sleep comfortably all night… then I will spend the night there"", he thought. Luckily, just then, he spotted the wide, red staircase that led to the tower atop the gate. The only people he might find up there would already be dead! So, the servant, being careful that his simple wooden-hilted sword did not slip out of its sheath, stepped on the bottom stair with his straw sandal. It was a few minutes later.","Ducking his neck, he looked around the gate, and drew up the shoulders of the blue kimono which he wore over his thin underwear. He decided to spend the night there, if he could find a secluded corner sheltered from wind and rain. He found a broad lacquered stairway leading to the tower over the gate. No one would be there, except the dead, if there were any. So, taking care that the sword at his side did not slip out of the scabbard, he set foot on the lowest step of the stairs. A few seconds later, halfway up the stairs, he saw a movement above."
下人は、守宮やもりのように足音をぬすんで、やっと急な梯子を、一番上の段まで這うようにして上りつめた。そうして体を出来るだけ、平たいらにしながら、頸を出来るだけ、前へ出して、恐る恐る、楼の内を覗のぞいて見た。,"The servant, like Morimiya and Mori, muffled his footsteps and finally climbed up the steep ladder as if crawling to the top. Then, while flattening my body as much as possible, I pushed my neck forward as much as possible and looked into the inside of the tower.","With all the stealth of a lizard, the servant crept to the top tread of the steep stairway. Then, hunching down and stretching out his neck as much as possible, he peered fearfully into the upper chamber.","The servant crept up to the top step of the steep staircase, his feet as silent as a gecko's. He straightened out his body as much as he could, stuck his neck out as far as possible, and cautiously peered into the tower.","As quietly as a lizard, the servant crept up to the top of the steep stairs. Crouching on all fours, and stretching his neck as far as possible, he timidly peeped into the tower."

どうにもならない事を、どうにかするためには、手段を選んでいる遑いとまはない。選んでいれば、築土の下か、道ばたの土の上で、饑死をするばかりである。そうして、この門の上へ持って来て、犬のように棄てられてしまうばかりである。選ばないとすれば――下人の考えは、何度も同じ道を低徊ていかいした揚句あげくに、やっとこの局所へ逢着ほうちゃくした。しかしこの「すれば」は、いつまでたっても、結局「すれば」であった。下人は、手段を選ばないという事を肯定しながらも、この「すれば」のかたをつけるために、当然、その後に来る可き「盗人ぬすびとになるよりほかに仕方がない」と云う事を、積極的に肯定するだけの、勇気が出ずにいたのである。,"There is no choice but to choose the means to do something that can't be helped. If you choose, you'll just die under the soil or on the side of the road. Then they just bring it over this gate and throw it away like a dog. If I didn't choose-the idea of the servant was to finally reach this local area after wandering the same way over and over again. However, this ""if"" was, after all, ""if"". The servant affirms that he does not choose the means, but in order to get this ""if"" method, of course, the courageous ""there is no choice but to become a thief's courage"" that comes after that. I didn't have the courage to positively affirm what I said.","To do something when there was nothing to be done, he would have to be prepared to do anything at all. If he hesitated, he would end up starving to death against an earthen wall or in the roadside dirt. Then he would simply be carried back to this gate and discarded upstairs like a dog. But if he was ready to do anything at all— His thoughts wandered the same path again and again, always arriving at the same destination. But no matter how much time passed, the “if” remained an “if.” Even as he told himself he was prepared to do anything at all, he could not find the courage for the obvious conclusion of that “if”: All I can do is become a thief.","In order to somehow get through his ""hopeless situation"", the servant might have to set his morals aside. If he refused to do things that he thought were morally questionable, then he would only end up starving to death under a roofed mud wall or on the side of the road. And then he would be taken to this gate, to be discarded, like a dog. ""If I am willing to do whatever it takes to survive…"" His thoughts had circled through his head a number of times, and they had finally arrived here. But this ""if"" would always remain a mere hypothetical. For although the servant acknowledged that he had to do whatever he could to get by, he didn't have the courage to bring the sentence to its foregone conclusion: ""I am bound to become a thief.""","He had little choice of means, whether fair or foul, because of his helpless circumstances. If he chose honest means, he would undoubtedly starve to death beside the wall or in the Sujaku gutter. He would be brought to this gate and thrown away like a stray dog. If he decided to steal... His mind, after making the same detour time and again, came finally to the conclusion that he would be a thief. But doubts returned many times. Though determined that he had no choice, he was still unable to muster enough courage to justify the conclusion that he must become a thief."
老婆は、大体こんな意味の事を云った。,The old woman generally said something like this.,I think she’d understand what I’m doing to her.”,The old woman said something along those lines.,"If she knew I had to do this in order to live, she probably wouldn't care.”"
下人げにんは、それらの死骸の腐爛ふらんした臭気に思わず、鼻を掩おおった。しかし、その手は、次の瞬間には、もう鼻を掩う事を忘れていた。ある強い感情が、ほとんどことごとくこの男の嗅覚を奪ってしまったからだ。,"The servant Genin covered his nose, not thinking of the rotten odor of those corpses. However, the hand had forgotten to blow his nose the next moment. A strong emotion has almost completely deprived the man of his sense of smell.","The stink of the rotting corpses reached him, and his hand flew up to cover his nose. But a moment later the hand seemed to forget its task when a powerful emotion all but obliterated the man’s sense of smell.","The servant instinctively covered his nose from the putrid stench of the rotting bodies. But the next instant, his hand fell away from his face.

何故かと云うと、この二三年、京都には、地震とか辻風とか火事とか饑饉とか云う災がつづいて起った。そこで洛中のさびれ方は一通りではない。旧記によると、仏像や仏具を打砕いて、その丹にがついたり、金銀の箔はくがついたりした木を、路ばたにつみ重ねて、薪たきぎの料しろに売っていたと云う事である。洛中がその始末であるから、羅生門の修理などは、元より誰も捨てて顧る者がなかった。するとその荒れ果てたのをよい事にして、狐狸こりが棲すむ。盗人ぬすびとが棲む。とうとうしまいには、引取り手のない死人を、この門へ持って来て、棄てて行くと云う習慣さえ出来た。そこで、日の目が見えなくなると、誰でも気味を悪るがって、この門の近所へは足ぶみをしない事になってしまったのである。,"The reason is that in the last few years, Kyoto has been hit by earthquakes, whirlwinds, fires, and famines. Therefore, there is no one way to get rid of Rakuchu. According to the old record, the wood that had been crushed into Buddhist statues and butsugu and had its tan attached to it or had gold and silver foil attached to it was piled up on the side of the road and sold for firewood. It is a thing. Since Rakuchu was the disposition, no one had to throw away the repair of Rashomon from the beginning. Then, the desolate thing is a good thing, and the fox fox inhabits. The thief is inhabited. In the end, I even got into the habit of bringing dead people without a pick-up to this gate and throwing them away. So, when the light of day disappeared, everyone was weird and decided not to sneak into the neighborhood of this gate.","This was because Kyoto had been struck by one calamity after another in recent years—earthquakes, whirlwinds, fires, famine—leading to the capital’s extraordinary decline. Old records tell us that people would smash Buddhist statues and other devotional gear, pile the pieces by the roadside with flecks of paint and gold and silver foil still clinging to them, and sell them as firewood. With the whole city in such turmoil, no one bothered to maintain the Rashōmon. Foxes and badgers came to live in the dilapidated structure, and they were soon joined by thieves. Finally, it became the custom to abandon unclaimed corpses in the upper story of the gate, which made the neighborhood an eerie place everyone avoided after the sun went down.","You see, over the last two or three years there had been a series of disasters in Kyoto: earthquakes, whirlwinds, fires, and famines. The capital was falling apart in many different ways. According to old records, Buddhist statues and altars had been smashed, and their vermilion-lacquered and gold- or silver-foiled wood piled up on the side of the road and sold as kindling. Needless to say, with the capital in this condition, there was no one to repair the gate, and indeed, nobody even gave it a second thought. Taking advantage of this state of neglect, foxes and badgers began to live there. Robbers lived there. Eventually, it had even become customary to take unclaimed corpses to the gate and dump them there. So after sunset, people got scared, and nobody dared set foot near the gate after dark.","For the past few years the city of Kyo¯to had been visited by a series of calamities, earthquakes, whirlwinds, and fires, and Kyo¯to had been greatly devastated. Old chronicles say that broken pieces of Buddhist images and other Buddhist objects, with their lacquer, gold, or silver leaf worn off, were heaped up on roadsides to be sold as firewood. Such being the state of affairs in Kyo¯to, the repair of the Rashomon was out of the question. Taking advantage of the devastation, foxes and other wild animals made their dens in the ruins of the gate, and thieves and robbers found a home there too. Eventually it became customary to bring unclaimed corpses to this gate and abandon them. After dark it was so ghostly that no one dared approach. feet high. This gate was constructed in 789 when the then capital of Japan was transferred to Kyoto. With the decline of West Kyoto, the gate fell into bad repair, cracking and crumbling in many places, and became a hide-out for thieves and robbers and a place for abandoning unclaimed corpses."
そこで、下人は、両足に力を入れて、いきなり、梯子から上へ飛び上った。そうして聖柄の太刀に手をかけながら、大股に老婆の前へ歩みよった。老婆が驚いたのは云うまでもない。,"So, the servant put his strength on both feet and suddenly jumped up from the ladder. Then, while touching the sacred sword, he walked in front of the old woman. It goes without saying that the old woman was surprised.","So now the servant, with a mighty thrust, leaped from the stairway and, grasping his sword by the bare hilt, he strode forcefully to where the old woman crouched. Terrified at the sight of him, the crone leaped up as if launched by a catapult.","The servant strained his legs, and, suddenly, leapt up from the stairs without warning. He strode over to the woman, his hand on the wooden hilt of his sword. Needless to say, the woman was scared out of her wits.","Then, summoning strength into his legs, he rose from the stairs and strode, hand on sword, right in front of the old creature. The hag turned, terror in her eyes, and sprang up from the floor, trembling."

見ると、楼の内には、噂に聞いた通り、幾つかの死骸しがいが、無造作に棄ててあるが、火の光の及ぶ範囲が、思ったより狭いので、数は幾つともわからない。ただ、おぼろげながら、知れるのは、その中に裸の死骸と、着物を着た死骸とがあるという事である。勿論、中には女も男もまじっているらしい。そうして、その死骸は皆、それが、かつて、生きていた人間だと云う事実さえ疑われるほど、土を捏こねて造った人形のように、口を開あいたり手を延ばしたりして、ごろごろ床の上にころがっていた。しかも、肩とか胸とかの高くなっている部分に、ぼんやりした火の光をうけて、低くなっている部分の影を一層暗くしながら、永久に啞おしの如く黙っていた。,"When I look at it, as I heard from rumors, some corpses are randomly abandoned, but the range of the light of the fire is narrower than I expected, so I don't know how many. However, it is vaguely known that there are naked corpses and kimono-clad corpses. Of course, it seems that both women and men are mixed inside. And all the corpses opened their mouths and reached out, like dolls made by kneading the soil, to the point that it was even suspected that it was a living human being. I was lying on the floor. What's more, the high parts of the shoulders and chest were exposed to the dim light of fire, and the shadows of the low parts were further darkened, and they remained silent forever.","There he saw a number of carelessly discarded corpses, as the rumors had said, but he could not tell how many because the lighted area was far smaller than he had thought it would be. All he could see in the dim light was that some of the corpses were naked while others were clothed. Women and men seemed to be tangled together. It was hard to believe that all of them had once been living human beings, so much did they look like clay dolls, lying there with arms flung out and mouths wide open, eternally mute. Shoulders and chests and other such prominent parts caught the dim light, casting still deeper shadows on the parts lower down.","As the rumours had said, a number of corpses had been discarded in the tower, but the firelight wasn't as bright as he had expected, so he couldn't tell how many. Although the light was dim, what he did know was that some of the bodies were wearing kimonos and others were naked. Predictably, the corpses' numbers counted both men and woman, mixed together amongst the dead. The bodies looked so much like clay dolls, that you might doubt that any of them had ever even been alive. Their mouths open and their arms outstretched, they were strewn haphazardly across the floor. And while the higher parts of their bodies—like their chests and shoulders—caught some of the dim firelight, they cast shadows on the lower parts, and the corpses were as eternally silent as a mute.","As rumor had said, he found several corpses strewn carelessly about the floor. Since the glow of the light was feeble, he could not count the number. He could only see that some were naked and others clothed. Some of them were women, and all were lolling on the floor with their mouths open or their arms outstretched showing no more signs of life than so many clay dolls. One would doubt that they had ever been alive, so eternally silent they were. Their shoulders, breasts, and torsos stood out in the dim light; other parts vanished in shadow."
下人は、老婆が死骸につまずきながら、慌てふためいて逃げようとする行手を塞ふさいで、こう罵ののしった。老婆は、それでも下人をつきのけて行こうとする。下人はまた、それを行かすまいとして、押しもどす。二人は死骸の中で、しばらく、無言のまま、つかみ合った。しかし勝敗は、はじめからわかっている。下人はとうとう、老婆の腕をつかんで、無理にそこへ扭ねじ倒した。丁度、鶏にわとりの脚のような、骨と皮ばかりの腕である。,"The servant cursed the old woman, stumbling on the corpse, blocking her rushing and trying to escape. The old woman still tries to get rid of her servant. The servant also pushes it back, trying not to let it go. In the corpse, the two grabbed each other silently for a while. However, the victory or defeat is known from the beginning. The servant finally grabbed the old woman's arm and forcibly knocked it down. It's an arm with only bones and skin, just like a chicken leg.","he shouted, blocking her way. Panic-stricken, she stumbled over corpses in an effort to flee.
