今川小路を通る時、末造は茶漬屋に寄って午食をした。女中の据えた黒塗の膳の向うに、紅雀の籠を置いて、目に可哀らしい小鳥を見、心に可哀らしいお玉の事を思いつつ、末造は余り御馳走でもない茶漬屋の飯を旨そうに食った。,"As he passed through Imagawakoji, Suezou stopped by a chazuke restaurant for lunch. Behind the black-painted set set by the maid, I placed a basket of red sparrows, saw a poor bird in my eyes, and thought of a poor ladle in my heart. I ate the rice deliciously.","But coming along Imagawa Lane, he stopped at the house of “Rice-in-Tea” for lunch. He put the cage behind the tray the waitress brought him and looked at the pretty birds. And thinking all the while of Otama, he ate the rather inferior meal with gusto.","When he reached Imagawa Kōji, he stopped at the restaurant he had passed earlier and had lunch. He set the bird cage down on the other side of the black lacquer lunch tray that the waitress brought, his eyes admiring the pretty little birds, his mind busy with thoughts of his pretty Otama. The meal of rice and tea and pickles was simple fare at best, but Suezō ate it with relish."
上野広小路は火事の少い所で、松源の焼けたことは記憶にないから、今もその座鋪があるかも知れない。どこか静かな、小さい一間をと誂えて置いたので、南向の玄関から上がって、真っ直に廊下を少し歩いてから、左へ這入る六畳の間に、末造は案内せられた。,"Ueno Hirokoji is a place with few fires, and I don't remember the burning of Matsugen, so I may still have that seat. I set it up as a quiet, small room, so I went up from the south-facing entrance, walked straight down the corridor, and then crawl to the left. ..","SINCE fires seldom break out in the vicinity of Ueno Square and since the Matsugen hasn't burned down as far as I can remember, I think you can still find the room where the two parties met. “I want something small and quiet,” Suezo had said when he made the reservations, and on the appointed day he was led from the south entrance through a straight corridor that turned left into a room with an area of six mats.","Few fires have broken out in the vicinity of Ueno Hirokōji and I do not recall hearing that the Matsugen burned down, so for all I know the very room where the meeting took place may still be in existence. Suezō, having requested a small quiet room, was guided down the hall from the entrance on the south and shown to a six-mat room on a corridor to the left."
「うん。非売品だ。椋鳥連中に配るのだそうだ」,"""Yeah. Not for sale. It seems to be distributed to the starlings.""","“He wrote it all right, but it's not for sale. He told me he had it printed to give to country bumpkins!”",“It’s not for sale. He says he just hands it out to yokels like me.”
こう云っているうちに、三人は四辻を通り過ぎた。巡査は我々の通る横町の左側、交番の前に立って、茅町を根津の方へ走る人力車を見ていたが、我々には只無意味な一瞥を投じたに過ぎなかった。,"While saying this, the three passed by Yotsuji. The policeman stood in front of the police box on the left side of Yokomachi, where we passed, and saw a rickshaw running through Kayamachi toward Nezu, but we only gave us a meaningless glance.","During this speech we passed the crossing. The policeman was in front of his station on the left side of the narrow street we were coming along; stationed there, he was watching a rickshaw running from Kaya-cho towards Nezu. He looked at us for only a moment.","We had passed the intersection. The policeman stood in front of the police box, which was on the left side of the street. He was looking at a rickshaw that was coming through Kayachō, headed in the direction of Nezu, and gave us no more than a meaningless glance."
岡田が手を洗っている最中に、それまで蛇の吭から鳥の死骸を引き出そうとしていた小僧が、「やあ大変」と叫んだ。,"While Okada was washing his hands, the little boy who had been trying to pull out the dead bird from the snake's snake shouted, ""Hey, it's hard.""","While Okada was washing his hands, the errand boy, who had been attempting to pull the dead bird from the snake's throat, cried out: “Hey!”","As Okada was washing his hands, the apprentice, who was still trying to pull the body of the dead bird out of the snake’s jaws, suddenly shouted, “Oops!”"
そのころから無縁坂の南側は岩崎の邸であったが、まだ今のような巍々たる土塀で囲ってはなかった。きたない石垣が築いてあって、苔蒸した石と石との間から、歯朶や杉菜が覗いていた。あの石垣の上あたりは平地だか、それとも小山のようにでもなっているか、岩崎の邸の中に這入って見たことのない僕は、今でも知らないが、とにかく当時は石垣の上の所に、雑木が生えたい程生えて、育ちたい程育っているのが、往来から根まで見えていて、その根に茂っている草もめったに苅られることがなかった。,"From that time on, the south side of Muenzaka was Iwasaki's residence, but it was not yet surrounded by the rugged earthen walls that it is today. A messy stone wall was built, and teeth and horsetail were peeping between the moss-steamed stones. Whether the area above the stone wall is flat or like a small mountain, I have never seen it in Iwasaki's house, but I still don't know, but at that time it was on the stone wall. I could see the roots of the trees growing as much as I wanted, and the grass growing on the roots was rarely sown.","EVEN IN the days I am writing about, the Iwasaki mansion was located, as it is today, on the southern side of Muenzaka, though it had not yet been fenced in with its present high wall of soil. At that time dirty stone walls had been put up, and ferns and horsetails grew among the moss-covered stones. Even now I don't know whether the land above the fence is flat or hilly, for I've never been inside the mansion. At any rate, in those days the copse grew thick and wild, and from the street we could see the roots of the trees, while the grass around them was seldom cut.","At that time the Iwasaki mansion already stood on the south side of Muenzaka, though it was not enclosed by a towering mud rampart as it is today, but by a dingy stone wall that sprouted ferns and horsetails from the crevices of its moss-covered slabs. I do not know to this day whether the area above the stone wall is flat or hilly, since I have never been on the grounds of the Iwasaki estate, but at that time one could tell it was thickly overgrown with trees because their roots were visible from the roadway. The roots were in turn overgrown with weeds that were seldom mowed."
末造は顔で笑って、叱るような物の言様をした。「なんだ。つい鼻の先の池の端に越して来ているのに、まだ行って見ないでいたのか。向いの岩崎の邸の事なんぞを思えば、同じ内にいるようなものだぜ。今からだって、行こうと思えば行けるのだが、まあ、あすの朝にするが好い」,"Suezou laughed with his face and made scolding words. ""Why. You've just come to the edge of the pond at the tip of your nose, but haven't you gone yet? Thinking about Iwasaki's house across the street, it's like being in the same place. Well, I can go if I want to go, but I prefer to do it tomorrow morning. ""","“What!” said Suezo, smiling in spite of his scolding tone. “You haven't visited him yet? His house right at Ike-no-hata? In front of your nose? Why, just think of Iwasaki's estate on the other side. It's almost as if the two of you were living in the same house. If you wish, we'll go now, though tomorrow would be better.”","Suezō laughed and spoke in a scolding voice. “What? Your father living by the pond right in front of your nose and you haven’t been to see him yet? He’s hardly any farther than the Iwasaki mansion across the way, practically in the same house with you. You can go now if you like. Or better still, tomorrow morning.”"

西洋の子供の読む本に、釘一本と云う話がある。僕は好くは記憶していぬが、なんでも車の輪の釘が一本抜けていたために、それに乗って出た百姓の息子が種々の難儀に出会うと云う筋であった。僕のし掛けたこの話では、青魚の未醬煮が丁度釘一本と同じ効果をなすのである。,"There is a story called a nail in a book read by Western children. I don't remember what I liked, but it was a source that the son of a peasant who got on it encountered various difficulties because one nail in the wheel of the car was missing. In this story that I started, the unboiled blue-backed fish has exactly the same effect as a single nail.","IN A EUROPEAN book of children's stories, there is a tale about a peg. I can't remember it well, but it was about a farmer's son who got into a series of difficulties on his journey because the peg in his cartwheel kept coming out.

「用ではないがね、散歩に出て、帰りに豊国屋へでも往こうかと思うのだ。一しょに来ないか」,"""It's not for use, but I'm thinking of going for a walk and going to Toyokuniya on the way back.

たよりに思う父親に、苦しい胸を訴えて、一しょに不幸を歎く積で這入った門を、我ながら不思議な程、元気好くお玉は出た。切角安心している父親に、余計な苦労を掛けたくない、それよりは自分を強く、丈夫に見せて遣りたいと、努力して話をしているうちに、これまで自分の胸の中に眠っていた或る物が醒覚したような、これまで人にたよっていた自分が、思い掛けず独立したような気になって、お玉は不忍の池の畔を、晴やかな顔をして歩いている。,"Mysteriously, a cheerful ladle came out at the gate where I crawl into the gate with a pile of misfortunes, complaining to my father who thinks of news. I don't want to put extra effort on my father who is relieved, but rather I want to make myself look stronger and stronger. I felt like I was awakened by something that was sleeping, and I felt like I was independent until now, and Odama made a bright face on the shore of the Shinobazunoike pond. I'm walking.","She had entered the gate with the intention of revealing her troubles to her father and gaining a partner in her misery, but she came out in high spirits that seemed strange even to herself. While she had talked to him, she was conscious of trying to appear strong and firm instead of adding any anxieties to the freedom he had found, and she sensed the release of some hidden quality in her. Previously she had depended on others, but now she knew the power of an unexpected self-reliance. And as she walked around the pond, she felt cheered.","She had come intending to bare the bitterness in her heart and share her misfortune with her father, but to her own surprise she now found herself leaving almost in good spirits. She had decided not to inflict further worry on her father now that he was at ease, but rather to show him how strong and trustworthy she could be. As she endeavored to convey this in her conversation, she became aware of a kind of awakening within herself. She, who in the past had depended so much on others, now experienced a surprising sense of independence. Her face was cheerful as she walked along the edge of the pond."
通る度に顔を見合せて、その間々にはこんな事を思っているうちに、岡田は次第に「窓の女」に親しくなって、二週間も立った頃であったか、或る夕方例の窓の前を通る時、無意識に帽を脱いで礼をした。その時微白い女の顔がさっと赤く染まって、寂しい微笑の顔が華やかな笑顔になった。それからは岡田は極まって窓の女に礼をして通る。,"Every time I passed by, I looked at each other, and while I was thinking about this, Okada gradually became familiar with the ""woman in the window"", and it was around the time I stood for two weeks, or one evening in the window. When I passed in front, I unconsciously took off my hat and thanked him. At that time, the slightly white woman's face was quickly dyed red, and her lonely smiling face turned into a gorgeous smile. After that, Okada is extremely thankful to the woman in the window.","Each time he came by, they looked at each other, and all the while thinking about these events, Okada gradually felt he was on friendly terms with “the woman of the window.” One evening, two weeks later, he unconsciously took off his cap and bowed when he passed her house.

From that moment on, Okada always bowed to the woman of the window when he went by.","Seeing her each time he passed, and thinking of her from time to time through the day, Okada gradually came to feel quite friendly with the woman in the window, and some two weeks later, as he strolled by one evening, he unconsciously raised his cap in greeting.

何事もなくても、こんな風に怯れがちなお玉の胆をとりひしいだ事が、越して来てから三日目にあった。それは越した日に八百屋も、肴屋も通帳を持って来て、出入を頼んだのに、その日には肴屋が来ぬので、小さい梅を坂下へ遣って、何か切身でも買って来させようとした時の事である。お玉は毎日肴なんぞが食いたくはない。酒を飲まぬ父が体に障らぬお数でさえあれば、なんでも好いと云う性だから、有り合せの物で御飯を食べる癖が附いていた。しかし隣の近い貧乏所帯で、あの家では幾日立っても生腥気も食べぬと云われた事があったので、若し梅なんぞが不満足に思ってはならぬ、それでは手厚くして下さる檀那に済まぬというような心から、わざわざ坂下の肴屋へ見せに遣ったのである。ところが、梅が泣顔をして帰って来た。どうしたかと問うと、こう云うのである。肴屋を見附けて這入ったら、その家はお内へ通を持って来たのとは違った家であった。御亭主がいないで、上さんが店にいた。多分御亭主は河岸から帰って、店に置くだけの物を置いて、得意先きを廻りに出たのであろう。店に新しそうな肴が沢山あった。梅は小鯵の色の好いのが一山あるのに目を附けて、値を聞いて見た。すると上さんが、「お前さんは見附けない女中さんだが、どこから買いにお出だ」と云ったので、これこれの内から来たと話した。上さんは急にひどく不機嫌な顔をして、「おやそう、お前さんお気の毒だが帰ってね、そうお云い、ここの内には高利貸の妾なんぞに売る肴はないのだから」と云って、それきり横を向いて、烟草を呑んで構い附けない。梅は余り悔やしいので、外の肴屋へ行く気もなくなって、駈けて帰った。そして主人の前で、気の毒そうに、肴屋の上さんの口上を、きれぎれに繰り返したのである。,"Even if nothing happened, it was the third day since I came over that I was struck by the gall bladder of a ball that tended to be frightened like this. On that day, both the greengrocer and the appetizer brought their passbooks and asked for entry and exit, but the appetizer did not come on that day, so I sent a small plum to Sakashita and bought some fillets. It was when I tried to make him do it. I don't want to eat ladle every day. As long as my father, who doesn't drink alcohol, has a number that doesn't hurt his body, he likes everything, so he had a habit of eating rice with a ready-made meal. However, in the poor neighborhood next door, it was said that no matter how many Hitachis there were, they wouldn't eat raw sardines, so you shouldn't be dissatisfied with Ume. I sent it to Sakashita's appetizer shop because I felt like I wasn't satisfied with Danna. However, Ume came home with a crying face. When asked what happened, he said: When I found a side dish and crawled in, the house was different from the one I brought to my house. There was no owner, and Mr. Ue was in the store. Perhaps the owner returned from the riverbank, left something to put in the store, and went around the customer. There were a lot of new side dishes in the store. I noticed that there was a mountain of plums that liked the color of small horse mackerel, and asked for the value. Then Mr. Ue said, ""You are a maid who can't find you, but where do you go to buy?"" Suddenly, Mr. Ue made a terrible moody face and said, ""Oh my god, I'm sorry for you, but please go home, because there is no side dish to sell to usury concubinage."" Then, I can't just turn to the side and swallow the grass. Ume was so regrettable that I didn't feel like going to an outside restaurant, so I ran home. And in front of his master, I felt sorry for him, and he repeatedly uttered the mouth of Mr. Ue-san.","To make matters worse, on the third day after she had moved in, she had been frightened. She was already timid enough to give the situation more attention than it deserved. On first moving into Muenzaka, she had been called on by the vegetable dealer and the fishmonger. When she agreed to be their customer, they gave her an account book. On the day in question, when the fish had not been delivered, she sent Ume down the slope to get a few slices for lunch. Otama was not used to eating fish every day, having taken her meals without such delicacies. Nor had her father been particular about food as long as she had prepared it well and it was healthy for him. But once she had heard one of her neighbors at their old house saying that she and her father had bought no fish for several days. Remembering how embarrassed she had been then, Otama decided to send the girl for some. “If Ume thinks I'm trying to save money,” she reasoned, “then I'm being unfair to Suezo. He's not like that.” But a short while later the maid returned crying. “What is it? Tell me,” Otama said a number of times before the girl would speak. “I went into a fish market, but not the one we buy from. I looked around but couldn't see the dealer. And I thought: ‘Why, he's probably calling on customers after buying fresh fish at the waterfront.' And then I saw some mackerel looking like they'd just been pulled out of the water. ‘How much?' I ask the wife. ‘I've never seen you around here,' she says to me, not even telling me how much. ‘ Whose house you from?' she asks. And when I told her, she began to make a face like she was angry. ‘Why!' she says. ‘Then I'm sorry for you. Go on back where you're from and tell your mistress we don't sell fish to the—whore of a usurer!' And then she turned her back on me, smoking her pipe, pretending I wasn't even there!” Ume had been too shocked and hurt to go to another shop and had run all the way back. And the simple girl, all the while making sympathetic gestures, told her mistress the entire story line by line.","On the third day after moving to the new house, Otama, prone to take fright at almost anything anyway, had an experience that thoroughly shocked her. The day of her arrival, men from the local grocery and fish stores had come with their order books to request her patronage, but on the third day, as the fish man had not called that morning, she sent Ume to the bottom of the hill to buy some fish for lunch. Otama did not care to eat fresh fish every day; her father, who was not a drinker, had always been satisfied with any sort of simple food, so long as it agreed with him, and she had become accustomed to making do with whatever happened to be in the house. But once in the past a nearby neighbor, by no means prosperous herself, had remarked disparagingly on the fact that Otama and her father went days on end without buying any fresh food. Otama was afraid that Ume might make some similar observation, which would reflect badly on the patron who had been so generous. So she sent the girl to the fish store at the foot of the hill mainly for effect. But when Ume returned she was in tears. Asked what had happened, this was her reply. She had found the store and gone in, only to discover that it was a different shop from the one that had come to the house to take orders. The proprietor was out and his wife was minding the counter. Probably he had returned from the wholesale fish market, left part of his supply there, and gone off with the rest to make deliveries to customers. From the heaps offish laid out on the racks Ume had selected some small mackerel that looked fresh and asked the price. “I don’t believe I’ve seen you before,” said the fishwife. “Where do you come from?” Ume described the house on the hill in which she lived, whereupon the woman looked suddenly very cross. “Indeed!” she said. “I’m sorry, then, but you better run along. We have no fish here to sell to a moneylender’s mistress!” With this she turned away and went on smoking, not deigning to pay any further attention to the girl. Ume, too upset to feel like going to any other stores, had come running back, and now, looking very wretched, repeated in disconnected scraps what the fishwife had said. As Otama listened, her face turned pale and for some time she remained silent."
新しい手拭の畳んだのを持って、岡田の側に立っている女主人が、開けたままにしてある格子戸に片手を掛けて外を覗いて、「小僧さん、何」と云った。,"The mistress standing by Okada, holding a new towel folded, put one hand on the lattice door that was left open and looked out and said, ""What a kid?""","The mistress of the house was standing beside Okada with a new towel folded in her hand, and hearing the boy's cry, she asked: “What's wrong?”","The woman, a clean, neatly folded towel in her hand, stood by Okada’s side. One hand on the open door of the entrance, she peered out and said, “What is it now?”"
翌日になった。この日は岡田が散歩に出なかったか、それともこっちで見はずしたか、お玉は恋しい顔を見ることが出来なかった。その次の日は岡田が又いつものように窓の外を通った。窓の方をちょいと見て通り過ぎたが、内が暗いのでお玉と顔を見合せることは出来なかった。その又次の日は、いつも岡田の通る時刻になると、お玉は草帚を持ち出して、格別五味も無い格子戸の内を丁寧に掃除して、自分の穿いている雪踏の外、只一足しか出して無い駒下駄を、右に置いたり、左に置いたりしていた。「あら、わたくしが掃きますわ」と云って、台所から出た梅を、「好いよ、お前は煮物を見ていておくれ、わたし用が無いからしているのだよ」と云って追い返した。そこへ丁度岡田が通り掛かって、帽を脱いで会釈をした。お玉は帚を持ったまま顔を真っ赤にして棒立に立っていたが、何も言うことが出来ずに、岡田を行き過ぎさせてしまった。お玉は手を焼いた火箸をほうり出すように帚を棄てて、雪踏を脱いで急いで上がった。,"It was the next day. Whether Okada didn't go for a walk on that day, or did he miss it here, Odama couldn't see his missed face. The next day Okada passed outside the window again as usual. I glanced at the window and passed by, but I couldn't see the ladle and face because the inside was dark. The next day, when it's time for Okada to pass, the ladle takes out the grass and carefully cleans the inside of the lattice door, which has no special taste, and only one pair outside the setta that he wears. The piece clogs that had not been put out were placed on the right or on the left. ""Oh, I'll sweep you,"" he said, and repelled the plums that came out of the kitchen, saying, ""Like, you're looking at the simmered food, because you don't have a private use."" .. Okada just passed by, took off his hat, and gave a nod. The ladle stood on a stick with his face bright red while holding a broom, but he couldn't say anything and made Okada go too far. The ladle abandoned the broom as if to throw out the fire chopsticks that had burned his hands, took off the setta, and hurried up.","And she was startled into wakefulness. Perhaps Okada had not taken a walk or she had missed him as he passed, for the day after the snake-killing, Otama didn't get a chance to look at the face she wanted so much to see. But the following day he was outside as usual. He glanced toward her window, yet it was so dark inside that he didn't recognize her. And the next day, at the time he usually came by, she took out a broom and swept the interior of the doorway. There was little dust to get rid of, and she occupied herself by placing first to the right and then to the left a pair of wooden clogs. “Oh, dear!” said Ume, coming out of the kitchen. “Let me do that!” “Don't trouble about it,” said Otama. “You look after the cooking. I'm only doing this because I don't have anything else to do.” And with these words the girl was driven back to the kitchen. At that moment Okada came by with his usual greeting. Red to the ears, Otama stood bolt upright with the broom in her hand, but she let him walk on without saying a word. She threw down her broom as though it were a pair of tongs that burned her hand, kicked off her sandals, and ran into the house.","The next day either Okada did not go for a walk or she somehow missed his passing, for she went through the day without a glimpse of the face she longed to see. The day after, he passed the window as usual, but the house was quite dark and, though he glanced toward the window, he apparently did not see her there. The following day, as the time drew near when he customarily passed, Otama took a straw broom and began sweeping the already spotless entryway and moving a pair of wooden clogs from the left side to the right and then back again to the left. “I’ll do that!” cried Ume, emerging from the kitchen. “Don’t you bother,” Otama replied. “You watch the things on the stove. I’m just doing this because I have nothing else to do.” At that moment Okada came by and raised his cap in greeting. Otama stood stiffly with the broom in her hand, her face reddening and, unable to say a word, allowed him to pass by. Then she threw down the broom as though it were a burning brand, slipped out of her sandals and disappeared into the house."
金の事より外、何一つ考えたことのない末造も、お玉のありかを突き留めるや否や、まだ先方が承知するかせぬか知れぬうちに、自分で近所の借家を捜して歩いた。何軒も見た中で、末造の気に入った店が二軒あった。一つは同じ池の端で、自分の住まっている福地源一郎の邸宅の隣と、その頃名高かった蕎麦屋の蓮玉庵との真ん中位の処で、池の西南の隅から少し蓮玉庵の方へ寄った、往来から少し引っ込めて立てた家である。四つ目垣の内に、高野槙が一本とちゃぼ檜葉が二三本と植えてあって、植木の間から、竹格子を打った肘懸窓が見えている。貸家の札が張ってあるので這入って見ると、まだ人が住んでいて、五十ばかりの婆あさんが案内をして中を見せてくれた。その婆あさんが問わずがたりに云うには、主人は中国辺の或る大名の家老であったが、廃藩になってから、小使取りに大蔵省の属官を勤めている。もう六十幾つとかになるが、綺麗好きで、東京中を歩いて、新築の借家を捜して借りるが、少し古びて来ると、すぐ引き越す。勿論子供は別になってしまってから久しくなるので、家を荒すような事はないが、どうせ住んでいるうちに古くなるので、障子の張替もしなくてはならず、畳の表も換えなくてはならない。そんな面倒をなるたけせぬようにして、さっさと引き越すのだと云うのである。婆あさんはそれが厭でならぬので、知らぬ人にも夫の壁訴訟をする。「この内なんぞもまだこんなに綺麗なのに、もう越すと申すのでございますよ」と云って、内じゅうを細かに見せてくれた。どこからどこまで、可なり綺麗に掃除がしてある。末造は一寸好いと思って、敷金と家賃と差配の名とを、手帳に書き留めて出た。,"As soon as I found out where the ladle was, even though I hadn't thought about anything other than money, I searched for a rented house in the neighborhood and walked before I knew it. Of the many I saw, there were two that I liked at the end. One is at the end of the same pond, next to the mansion of Fukuchi Genichiro, where I live, and in the middle of the famous soba restaurant Rengyokuan, a little lotus ball from the southwest corner of the pond. It is a house that was set up a little withdrawn from the traffic, approaching the hermitage. In the fourth Megaki, one Takano Maki and a few Chabo Hinoha are planted, and the elbow hanging window with a bamboo lattice can be seen between the plants. There was a rented house tag on it, so when I crawled in and looked at it, there were still people living there, and an old lady of about fifty guided me to show me the inside. According to the old lady, the owner was a lord of a Chinese lord, but since he was abolished, he has been an officer of the Ministry of Finance as an ambassador. It's about 60 years old, but I like cleanliness, so I walk around Tokyo to find and rent a new rented house, but when it gets a little old, I move immediately. Of course, it's been a long time since my child was separated, so I don't have to ruin my house, but since it gets old while I live, I have to replace the shoji screens and the tatami mats. must not. It is said that he should move quickly without taking such trouble. Auntie is not afraid of it, so she filed a proceeding with her husband's wall against strangers. ""Even though all of these are still so beautiful, I'm telling you to go over,"" he said in detail. From where to where, it has been cleaned fairly cleanly. I thought that Suezou was a little nice, so I wrote down the deposit, rent, and the name of the difference in my notebook.","BEFORE this new interest in Suezo's life, his only thoughts had centered on the students, their loans, and his returns, but he had no sooner located Otama and her father than he began to search his neighborhood for a house to establish his mistress in. He did not know whether or not he would succeed with his plan, but he was so eager to advance the scheme that he began to put it into operation. Two of the many houses he investigated pleased him. One of them was on his own street, halfway between his house, which was right next to the famous writer Fukuchi's, and the Rengyokuan, which sold the best bowl of noodles in the area. A short distance from the Shinobazu pond was the house that had first appealed to him, for it stood somewhat back from the road, was fenced about with bamboo canes, and had a thick-needled parasol pine and a few cypresses. The other house, in the middle of Muenzaka, was smaller. He did not find any notice on the door when he arrived, but he had heard that the house was for sale. Almost immediately upon entering, he discovered the noise from the neighboring house and the group of young ladies at work. “I don't like that,” he said to himself, but on inspecting the interior with more care, he could not help appreciating the high quality of the timber. He knew that the former occupant, a wealthy merchant who had just died, had built the house with care in order to spend his retirement there. The place, with its front garden and granite doorway, was comfortable, neat, and superior in taste. One night, as Suezo lay in bed, he thought about the two houses. His wife, who had tried to put her child to sleep, had herself dozed off while the infant suckled at her breast. Suezo turned away from her, her mouth open, snoring, the child pulling at the exposed breast. Usually Suezo would lie awake in bed while devising new schemes for increasing the interest on his loans. His wife never complained about this habit, and she was usually asleep long before her husband. Once more he glanced at her, thinking to himself: “Is that a woman's face? I doubt it. Take Otama's face. That's a woman's face, but I haven't seen her for a long time.","Ordinarily Suezō thought of little else than money matters, but before he had even ascertained Otama’s whereabouts or whether she would agree to his proposal, he had begun looking around for a house to rent somewhere in his neighborhood. After considering a number of possibilities, he found two that were to his liking. One was situated on the edge of the pond, halfway between the home of the writer Fukuchi Gen’ichirō, which was next to his own home, and the Rengyokuan, a restaurant famous for its buckwheat noodles. It was situated just beyond the southwest corner of the pond, in the direction of the Rengyokuan, and was set back a way from the street. Just inside the bamboo fence grew a Chinese black pine and two or three arborvitae trees, and beyond their branches one could glimpse a bay window fitted with a bamboo lattice. The house had a “For Rent” sign on it, but when Suezō made inquiries he discovered that it was still occupied. A woman of about fifty showed him around the premises. Her husband, she explained, had been chief retainer to a daimyo of western Honshu, but after the abolition of the feudal system he had been employed as a minor official in the Finance Ministry. He was well over sixty now, she said, continuing to volunteer information on the subject, but a great stickler for appearances. He would tramp all over Tokyo looking for a newly built house to rent, but after he had lived in it a while and it had started to show the least sign of wear, he would insist on moving somewhere else. Their children had of course grown up and left home long ago, so the house wasn’t subject to rough wear, but still a house gets old and the shoji panels have to be repapered and the tatami mats replaced. Rather than bother with all that, however, he preferred to move someplace new. The woman rattled on in this fashion, apparently so peeved at her husband’s incessant moving that she felt compelled to air her annoyance even before a complete stranger. “This house is perfectly clean and neat, as you can see, but already he wants to move out!” she exclaimed as she showed Suezō around the house. The rooms were in fact all in quite good shape and Suezō, favorably impressed, made a note of the rent, deposit money, and rental agent in his pocket notebook."
お玉は父親を一週間に一度ずつ位はきっと尋ねることにしているが、まだ一度も一時間以上腰を落ち着けていたことは無い。それは父親が許さぬからである。父親は往く度に優しくしてくれる。何か旨い物でもあると、それを出して茶を飲ませる。しかしそれだけの事をしてしまうと、すぐに帰れと云う。これは老人の気の短い為めばかりでは無い。奉公に出したからには、勝手に自分の所に引き留めて置いては済まぬと思うのである。お玉が二度目か三度目に父親の所に来た時、午前のうちは檀那の見えることは決して無いから、少しはゆっくりしていても好いと云ったことがある。父親は承知しなかった。「なる程これまではお出がなかったかも知れない。それでもいつ何の御用事があってお出なさるかも知れぬではないか。檀那に申し上げておひまを戴いた日は別だが、お前のように買物に出て寄って、ゆっくりしていてはならない。それではどこをうろついているかと、檀那がお思なされても為方が無い」と云うのであった。,"Odama is sure to ask his father once a week, but he has never settled down for more than an hour. That's because my father doesn't allow it. My father is kind to me every time I go. If it's something delicious, take it out and have it drink tea. However, if you do that much, you will be told to go home immediately. This is not just because of the short temper of the old man. I don't think it's okay to keep it at my place because I sent it to the apprenticeship. When the ladle came to his father for the second or third time, he never saw Danna in the morning, so he said it would be nice to be a little slow. The father didn't know. ""I see, I may not have come out until now. Still, I may have something to do at any time. Except for the day when I told Danna and got a free time, like you. You shouldn't go shopping and be slow. Then, even if Danna wonders where she's wandering around, there's no point in doing it. ""","She visited him without fail once a week, but she never stayed more than an hour. This was because her father refused to let her stay longer. When she called on him, he treated her always with the same kindness. And if he had any good things to serve, he brought them out and made tea for her. But, this finished, he said: “You'd better go now.” He said this not merely because of the impatience of an old man but also because he thought it selfish of him to detain his daughter for long when he had sent her out to do service. On her second or third visit she had informed him that she could stay longer because her master never came in the morning, but the old man wouldn't allow her to take her time. “Well, it may be true,” he had told her, “that as yet he hasn't come in the morning, but you can't be certain when he'll get there on some unexpected business. If you had asked him, and got his permission, it would be all right. But since you've only stopped here on your way from shopping, you shouldn't stay long. You wouldn't have any excuse if he thought you were idling away the time.”","Otama visited her father once a week without fail, but on no occasion had she ever stayed more than an hour. Her father would not permit it. He was invariably kind and thoughtful, and if he happened to have something good to eat on hand, would serve it with the tea. But once that was done he would urge her to be on her way. This was not just an expression of the old man’s impatience; he felt that, since he had placed his daughter in another man’s service, it would be inexcusable if he detained her at his place for selfish reasons. The second or third time Otama came to visit, she assured her father that Suezō never called on her in the morning and therefore she need not hurry off. But her father would hear none of this. “Perhaps he’s never come to your place at that hour. But you have no way of knowing when he may have affairs that oblige him to do so. If you had told him in advance and gotten permission, that would be different. But when you drop in like this on your way home from shopping, you have no business staying a long while. If he begins wondering where you are spending your time you’ll have only yourself to blame!”"
「うん。女のために蛇を殺すと云うのは、神話めいていて面白いが、どうもその話はそれぎりでは済みそうにないね」僕は正直に心に思う通りを言った。,"""Yeah. Killing a snake for a woman is mythical and interesting, but it doesn't seem like it's all about it,"" I honestly said.","“I think you did,” I said. But I added quite frankly: “Killing a snake for a beautiful woman is an interesting story. It's almost like a fairy tale. But it doesn't seem to me that your story's finished.”",“Yes indeed. Killing a snake for the sake of a woman—it has an intriguing fairy tale air to it. But I don’t think that will be the end of the story.” I was just telling him frankly how I felt.
「そうそう君が値を附けて折り合わなかったと、本屋が云っていたよ。君欲しいのなら譲って上げよう」,"""Oh yeah, the bookstore said you didn't come to terms with the price. If you want, I'll give it away.""","“The man at the shop said you bargained, but that you couldn't agree. If you must have it, buy it from me.”","“But the owner of the store said you wouldn’t go above a certain price. If you’re all that eager to have it, I’ll give it to you.”"
僕は第三者に有勝な無遠慮を以て、度々背後を振り向いて見たが、お玉の注視は頗る長く継続せられていた。,"I often turned around and looked back, with no reluctance to win against a third party, but the gaze of the ladle continued for a long time.","Having the liberty of a third party, I looked back several times and saw that she continued to watch Okada.","With the unreserve of a third party, I turned several times to look back. She watched us for a long time."
岡田の日々の散歩は大抵道筋が極まっていた。寂しい無縁坂を降りて、藍染川のお歯黒のような水の流れ込む不忍の池の北側を廻って、上野の山をぶらつく。それから松源や雁鍋のある広小路、狭い賑やかな仲町を通って、湯島天神の社内に這入って、陰気な臭橘寺の角を曲がって帰る。しかし仲町を右へ折れて、無縁坂から帰ることもある。これが一つの道筋である。或る時は大学の中を抜けて赤門に出る。鉄門は早く鎖されるので、患者の出入する長屋門から這入って抜けるのである。後にその頃の長屋門が取り払われたので、今春木町から衝き当る処にある、あの新しい黒い門が出来たのである。赤門を出てから本郷通りを歩いて、粟餅の曲擣をしている店の前を通って、神田明神の境内に這入る。そのころまで目新しかった目金橋へ降りて、柳原の片側町を少し歩く。それからお成道へ戻って、狭い西側の横町のどれかを穿って、矢張臭橘寺の前に出る。これが一つの道筋である。これより外の道筋はめったに歩かない。,"Okada's daily walks were usually on the right track. Go down the lonely Muen-zaka, go around the north side of the Shinobazu pond where water like the teeth of the Aizen River flows, and wander around the mountains of Ueno. Then, through Matsugen, Hirokoji with a goose pot, and a narrow and lively Nakamachi, you will crawl into the Yushima Tenjin shrine and turn back at the corner of the gloomy odor Tachibana-dera. However, he may turn right at Nakamachi and return from Muenzaka. This is one way. At one point, I passed through the university and went to Akamon. Since the iron gate is chained quickly, it crawls in and out of the nagayamon where the patient enters and exits. Later, the nagayamon gate was removed at that time, so that new black gate was created at the place where it hits from Haruki-cho this year. After leaving Akamon, walk along Hongo-dori, pass in front of the shop that plays the song of Awamochi, and crawl into the precincts of Kanda Myojin. Get off at Mekinbashi, which was new until that time, and walk a little on one side of Yanagihara. Then, return to Onari-do, pierce one of the narrow western side streets, and exit in front of Yahari Odor Tachibana-dera. This is one way. I rarely walk outside this path.","Okada had regular routes for his daily walks. He would go down the lonely slope called Muenzaka and travel north along Shinobazu Pond. Then he would stroll up the hill in Ueno Park. Next he went down to Hirokoji and, turning into Naka-cho—narrow, crowded, full of activity—he would go through the compound of Yushima Shrine and set out for the Kamijo after passing the gloomy Karatachi Temple. Sometimes he made a slight variation in a particular route, such as a right turn at the end of Naka-cho, so that he would come back to his room along the silence and loneliness of Muenzaka. There was another route. He occasionally entered the university campus by the exit used by the patients of the hospital attached to the medical school because the Iron Gate was closed early. Going through the Red Gate, he would proceed along Hongo-dori until he came to a shop where people were standing and watching the antics of some men pounding millet. Then he would continue his walk by turning into the compound of Kanda Shrine. After crossing the Megane-bashi, which was still a novelty in those days, he would wander for a short while through a street with houses on only one side along the river. And on his way back he went into one of the narrow side streets on the western side of Onarimichi and then came up to the front of the Karatachi Temple. This was an alternate route. Okada seldom took any other.","The course that Okada followed in his evening walks was generally the same. Starting out from his lodging, he would take the rather lonely road down Muenzaka, go along the north bank of Shinobazu Pond, where the blackened waters of the Aizome River flow into it, and then make his way up the hill at Ueno. From there he would wander along the narrow bustling streets of Hirokōji and Nakachō, where the Matsugen and Gannabe restaurants were located, through the grounds of the Yushima Tenjin Shrine, past the corner of the gloomy Karatachi Temple, and back home. Sometimes he turned right at Nakachō and returned by way of Muenzaka. This was one of his routes. At other times he cut through the campus of the university and came out by the Akamon or Red Gate. The Iron Gate of the Medical Department was shut early, so he entered through the Nagaya gate, the one used by the patients, and got across the campus that way. Later the Nagaya gate was torn down and a new black gate put up, the one that now leads out to Harukichō. After emerging from the Red Gate, he would go along Hongō Street, past the shop where the man pounds dough for millet cakes while performing feats of dexterity, and into the grounds of the Kanda Myōjin Shrine. Then he would walk down to Megane Bridge, at that time still a novel sight, and stroll a while through Yanagihara on the street by the river that has houses on only one side. From there he would go back to Onarimichi, thread through one or another of the narrow alleys on the west of it, and come out in front of Karatachi Temple. This was another route. He almost never took any route other than these two."
末造の床は一番奥の壁際に、少し離して取ってある。その枕元には座布団が敷いて、烟草盆と茶道具とが置いてある。末造は座布団の上に据わって、烟草を吸い附けながら、優しい声で云った。,"The floor of the last building is set a little away from the innermost wall. A cushion is laid at the bedside, and a tray and tea utensils are placed. Suezou stood on a cushion and sucked on the grass, saying in a gentle voice.","His bed was laid out farther back near the wall and away from the other members of the family. A cushion, smoking set, and tea things had been arranged beside his pillow.","Suezō’s pallet was laid far over by the wall, separated a little from the other pallets. By the pillow was a mat, along with his smoking tray and tea things. He sat down, lit a cigarette, and asked in a gentle voice, “What’s the matter?"
いつの間にか十一月になった。小春日和が続いて、窓を開けて置いても目立たぬので、お玉は又岡田の顔を毎日のように見ることが出来た。これまで薄ら寒い雨の日などが続いて、二三日も岡田の顔の見られぬことがあると、お玉は塞いでいた。それでも飽くまで素直な性なので、梅に無理を言って迷惑させるような事はない。ましてや末造に不機嫌な顔を見せなんぞはしない。唯そんな時は箱火鉢の縁に肘を衝いて、ぼんやりして黙っているので、梅が「どこかお悪いのですか」と云ったことがあるだけである。それが岡田の顔がこの頃続いて見られるので、珍らしく浮き浮きして来て、或る朝いつもよりも気軽に内を出て、池の端の父親の所へ遊びに往った。,"Before I knew it, it was November. The Indian summer continued, and even if the window was opened, it was not noticeable, so the ladle could see Okada's face almost every day. Until now, it was a chilly rainy day, and when Okada's face could not be seen for a few days, the ladle was blocked. Even so, I'm obedient until I get tired of it, so I don't force Ume to bother me. Not to mention that he doesn't show a moody face to Suzo. At that time, I hit my elbow against the edge of the brazier and kept silent, so I just said, ""Is something wrong?"" Okada's face can be seen continuously around this time, so it came to my mind unusually, and one morning I went out more easily than usual and went to visit my father at the end of the pond.","It was already November, and the days settled into Indian summer, so Otama had an excuse for keeping the window open to await Okada's daily walk. Previously a group of chilly and wet days had prevented her from seeing him for several days at a time, and she had become despondent. But she was of so mild a temperament that she didn't give her maid any trouble with unreasonable demands, nor did she give Suezo any sorry looks. During these periods she would remain alone at the brazier with her elbows resting on its frame. She would sit silently and would seem so lost that one day Ume asked her: “Is anything wrong?” But now that she could see Okada for many days in a row, she felt buoyant, and one morning she walked to her father's house with a light step.","And then, before one knew it, it was November. The warm autumn weather came once more and Otama could leave the window open without attracting notice, and thus could see Okada’s face each day Earlier, when two or three days of chilly rain had made this impossible and prevented her from seeing him, she had been downcast. Gentle-natured as she was, however, she never took out her frustration on Ume or made unreasonable demands. And of course she never showed a sulky face when she was around Suezō. If she felt out of sorts, she would merely plant her elbows on the rim of the brazier and gaze around in silence, till Ume would ask if perhaps she was coming down with something. But now she saw Okada every day, and as a result was in wonderfully buoyant spirits. One morning, leaving the house in an unusually jaunty mood, she set off to visit her father at his place by the pond."
お常はこれだけの事を器械的にしてしまった。そして団扇を一本持って蚊屋の中へ這入って据わった。その時けさ途で逢った、あの女の所に、今時分夫が往っているだろうと云うことが、今更のようにはっきりと想像せられた。どうも体を落ち着けて、据わってはいられぬような気持がする。どうしよう、どうしようと思ううちに、ふらふらと無縁坂の家の所まで往って見たくなる。いつか藤村へ、子供の一番好きな田舎饅頭を買いに往った時、したて物の師匠の内の隣と云うのはこの家だなと思って、見て通ったので、それらしい格子戸の家は分かっている。ついあそこまで往って見たい。火影が外へ差しているか。話声が微かにでも聞えているか。それだけでも見て来たい。いやいや、そんな事は出来ない。外へ出るには女中部屋の傍の廊下を通らぬわけには行かない。この頃はあの廊下の所の障子がはずしてある。松はまだ起きて縫物をしている筈である。今時分どこへ往くのだと聞かれた時、なんとも返事のしようがない。何か買いに出ると云ったら、松が自分で行こうと云うだろう。して見れば、どんなに往って見たくても、そっと往って見ることは出来ない。ええ、どうしたら好かろう。けさ内へ帰る時は、ちっとも早くあの人に逢いたいと思ったが、あの時逢ったら、わたしはなんと云っただろう。逢ったら、わたしの事だから、取留のない事ばかり言ったに違いない。そうしたらあの人が又好い加減の事を言って、わたしを騙してしまっただろう。あんな利口な人だから、どうせ喧嘩をしては愜わない。いっそ黙っていようか。しかし黙っていてどうなるだろうか。あんな女が附いていては、わたしなんぞはどうなっても構わぬ気になっているだろう。どうしよう。どうしよう。,"I've always done all this mechanically. Then he took a fan and crawls into the mosquito net and set it down. It was as clear as it is now that my husband would have gone to that woman who I met at that time. I feel calm and can't stand still. While I was wondering what to do, I wanted to go to the house of Muenzaka and see it. One day, when I went to Fujimura to buy my child's favorite country bun, I thought that this house was next to the master of the fresh buns, so I went through it, so it seems like a lattice. I know the house of the door. I just want to go there and see. Is Hokage pointing out? Can you hear the voice even faintly? I want to see it alone. No, I can't do that. You can't go outside without going through the corridor next to the maid's room. Around this time, the shoji in that corridor had been removed. The pine should still be up and sewing. When I was asked where I was going, I couldn't answer. If I were to buy something, Matsu would say I would go by myself. If you look at it, no matter how much you want to go back, you can't go back and see it. Yeah, how do you like it? When I returned to Kesa, I wanted to meet him as soon as possible, but if I met him at that time, what would I say? If I met him, he must have said that he wasn't detained because it was me. Then that person would have deceived me by saying something he liked. I'm such a clever person, so I don't feel sorry for fighting anyway. Shall I keep silent? But what happens if you keep silent? With such a woman, I wouldn't care what happened. What should I do. What should I do.","She had done all these tasks mechanically, and then taking a fan, got under the net and sat on her bed. Suddenly she imagined Suezo in the house of the woman. “I can't sit here,” she said to herself. “But what can I do?” Somehow at the center of her confusion she felt that she ought to walk to Muenzaka. Once when she had bought some beancakes for the children, she had passed the house which Suezo had described as next to the sewing teacher's. She could identify it by its lattice door, the house that woman lived in. All she wanted was to see it. Would there be a light? Would she hear them whispering? If only she could know just that much! But no, she couldn't. In order to get out of her own house she would have to pass the maid's room along the corridor, and at this time of the year the paper sliding doors were removed. She was certain the maid was awake sewing. “Where you going so late?” Matsu would ask her. And what could she answer? She might say: “I'm just running out to buy something.” But Matsu would reply: “Certainly not! Let me go!” No matter what Otsune wanted to do, she could not leave the house secretly. “Ah, what can I do?” she thought. When she had returned home, she had wanted to go to her husband immediately, but what would she have said? She knew her own limitations, and her words would have been meaningless. And then her husband would have invented some tale to trick her and would have succeeded. “I'm not his match in a quarrel. He's too shrewd.” She wondered if she weren't better off to keep quiet. But then what would the result have been? “He'd still have his Muenzaka whore, and he'd have no use for me!” What could she do? What?","Having carried out these chores in her mechanical manner, Otsune picked up a fan and seated herself in the middle of the mosquito net. That woman I saw this morning— right now he’s at her place! she thought. She could picture it clearly. She couldn’t go on just sitting there—what should she do? What should she do? She felt like dashing off to the house on Muenzaka and having a look for herself. Once, when she was on her way to Fujimura to buy some of the bean cakes that the children were so fond of, she had gone by Muenzaka and had looked at the house next to the sewing teacher’s, thinking , This must be it, the one with the lattice door! She would just go now and have a look at it. Perhaps she could see a light shining from it, or perhaps catch the faint sound of voices. Even that would be enough. But no, she thought, I couldn’t do that. I couldn’t leave the house without going down the corridor past the maid’s room. This time of year the sliding doors will be open and Matsu will surely be sitting up sewing. If she asks where I’m going, what will I say? If I say I’m going to buy something, Matsu will insist on going herself. As much as I’d like to slip out and have a look, it just isn’t possible. Well then, what should I do? When I came home this morning, I wanted to have it out with him as soon as possible. But suppose he had been here—what would I have said? Whatever I said, he would have come out with some vague, incomprehensible answer, the way he always does. And he would twist things around and in the end make a fool of me. He’s too clever a talker—whenever we argue, I always lose. Should I just keep quiet then? But if I do, what will happen? As long as that woman is around, he doesn’t care what becomes of me! What should I do? What should I do?"

梅が真っ赤になって、それを拾って這入る跡から、男は無遠慮に上がって来て、お玉の炭をついでいる箱火鉢の向うに据わった。なんだか色々な事を云うが、取り留めた話ではない。監獄にいた時どうだとか云うことを幾度も云って、息張るかと思えば、泣言を言っている。酒の匀が胸の悪い程するのである。,"From the mark where the plum turned bright red and picked it up and crawled in, the man came up without hesitation and set it over the box brazier with the charcoal of the ladle. I say a lot of things, but it's not a story I've stopped. I often say what I was doing when I was in prison, and when I thought about breathing, I was crying. The liquor makes me sick.","Ume was embarrassed, but picked it up and went back in, only to find the man rudely following her and taking a seat opposite Otama, who had been putting some charcoal into the fire. He talked incoherently at great length, bragging at first about having been in prison and then making sentimental complaints. Otama could smell saké on his breath. She was afraid, yet she held back her tears.","Ume, her face red with confusion, picked it up and took it into the next room to Otama, whereupon the man brazenly followed her into the room and plopped himself down beside the brazier that Otama was just then replenishing with charcoal. He began rambling on about one thing and another, but little of what he said made sense. Repeatedly he referred to the time “when I was in the lockup”; one moment he was ordering the women around, the next moment whining about his troubles.

末の子が寝返りをして、何か夢中で言ったので、お上さんも覚えず声を低うして、「一体わたしどうすれば好いのでしょう」と云って、今度は末造の胸の所に顔を押し附けて、しくしく泣いている。,"The youngest child turned over and said something crazy, so the boss didn't even remember and shouted, ""What should I do?""

容貌はその持主を何人にも推薦する。しかしそればかりでは下宿屋で幅を利かすことは出来ない。そこで性行はどうかと云うと、僕は当時岡田程均衡を保った書生生活をしている男は少かろうと思っていた。学期毎に試験の点数を争って、特待生を狙う勉強家ではない。遣るだけの事をちゃんと遣って、級の中位より下には下らずに進んで来た。遊ぶ時間は極って遊ぶ。夕食後に必ず散歩に出て、十時前には間違なく帰る。日曜日には舟を漕ぎに行くか、そうでないときは遠足をする。競漕前に選手仲間と向島に泊り込んでいるとか、暑中休暇に故郷に帰るとかの外は、壁隣の部屋に主人のいる時刻と、留守になっている時刻とが狂わない。誰でも時計を号砲に合せることを忘れた時には岡田の部屋へ問いに行く。上条の帳場の時計も折々岡田の懐中時計に拠って匡されるのである。周囲の人の心には、久しくこの男の行動を見ていればいる程、あれは信頼すべき男だと云う感じが強くなる。上条のお上さんがお世辞を言わない、破格な金遣いをしない岡田を褒め始めたのは、この信頼に本づいている。それには月々の勘定をきちんとすると云う事実が与かって力あるのは、ことわるまでもない。「岡田さんを御覧なさい」と云う詞が、屢々お上さんの口から出る。,"Appearance recommends its owner to anyone. However, that alone is not enough to make the most of the boarding house. As for sexual behavior, I thought that few men were living a balanced life as a shosei at that time. He is not a student who aims to be a scholarship student by competing for exam scores every semester. I did what I could do, and proceeded without going below the middle level of the class. I play very much time to play. I always go for a walk after dinner and definitely return before 10 o'clock. Go rowing on Sundays or go on an excursion otherwise. Outside of staying at Mukaishima with fellow athletes before the rowing, or returning to my hometown on a hot vacation, the time when my husband is in the room next to the wall and the time when I am away do not go wrong. When anyone forgets to set the clock to the gun, he goes to Okada's room to ask. The clocks in Kamijou's counter are sometimes based on Okada's pocket watches. The longer I see this man's behavior, the stronger the feeling that he is a reliable man in the hearts of those around me. It is based on this trust that Kamijou's boss began to praise Okada, who does not flatter and does not make extraordinary money. It goes without saying that the fact that the monthly account is proper is added to this. The phrase ""Look at Mr. Okada"" often comes out of his mouth.","A good-looking face may influence others, but it alone does not carry weight in a boarding house. Personal behavior must also be considered, and I doubt if many students lived as well-balanced a life as Okada did. He wasn't a bookworm who worked greedily for examination marks each term and who wanted to win a scholarship. Okada did the required amount of work and was never lower than the middle of his class. And in his free time he always relaxed. After supper he would take a walk and would return without fail before ten. On Sundays he rowed or set off on a long hike. Except for periods of living with his crew before a match or of returning to his home in the country for summer vacations, the time never varied when he was in or out of his room. Often a boarder who had forgotten to set his watch by the signal gun at noon went to Okada's room to find out the time. And occasionally even the office clock in the Kamijo was put right by Okada. The more we observed him, the stronger became our impression that he was reliable. Even though Okada didn't flatter the landlady or spend much money above his room and board, she began to praise him. Needless to say, the fact that he paid his rent regularly was one of the reasons for her attitude. She often said: “Look at Mr. Okada!”","Though his looks did much to recommend him, they were not the sole reason why he commanded so much respect in our boardinghouse. Above all it was his character and conduct that were impressive. I have known few men who maintained the balance and order in their lives that Okada did. He made no effort to achieve special distinction in his exams, but did what was required carefully and thoroughly so that each term he retained his standing around the middle of the class. And when the time came to relax, he relaxed. After dinner he invariably took a walk, returning without fail before ten. Sundays he went rowing or on a picnic. Except for those occasions when he spent the night at Mukōjima with his companions on the rowing team, or when he had gone home for the summer holiday, the hours he spent in and out of his room—and I know because I lived next door—were utterly regular. Anyone who had forgotten to set his watch by the noonday gun could get the correct time by going to Okada’s room. Even the clock at the front desk of the Kamijō was on occasion corrected to conform to Okada’s pocket watch. Those around him felt more strongly the longer they observed him that here was a man to be relied on. It was this quality of dependability, rather than any lavishness in spending, that led our landlady, never one for flattery, to praise Okada, though the fact that he paid his rent promptly each month no doubt helped. “Look at Mr. Okada!” was her frequently offered advice."
膳を膳棚にしまって箱火鉢の所に帰って据わったお玉は、なんだか気がそわそわしてじっとしてはいられぬと云う様子をしていた。そしてけさ梅が綺麗に篩った灰を、火箸で二三度搔き廻したかと思うと、つと立って着物を着換えはじめた。同朋町の女髪結の所へ往くのである。これは不断来る髪結が人の好い女で、余所行の時に結いに往けと云って、紹介して置いてくれたのに、これまでまだ一度も往かなかった内なのである。,"The ladle, which had the set on the shelf and returned to the brazier, seemed to be a little nervous and couldn't stay still. Then, when I thought that the ash that Kesaume had sifted cleanly was swirled around with fire chopsticks a couple of times, I stood up and began to change my kimono. I go to the place of the female hairdresser in the same town. This is a woman who likes to have a constant hairdressing, and even though she introduced me to her when she went to Yu-Ke, she never went there.","After she had put away the trays on the shelf, she sat down at her usual place before the charcoal brazier. She felt restless. She took up the pair of tongs and stirred the ashes that Ume had sifted smooth. Then she got up to change into her kimono. “I'll go to the hairdresser's,” she decided. A good-natured woman who came to Otama to arrange her hair had recommended this shop for special occasions. But up to that time Otama had never gone there.","She put the breakfast tray on the shelf and sat down beside the brazier, fidgeting restlessly. For a while she considered smoothing again the ashes that Ume had already neatly raked. Then abruptly she stood up and began to change her clothes. She was going to the hairdresser in Dōbōchō. The woman who came regularly to the house to do her hair had kindly recommended a woman in Dōbōchō “for special occasions,” but until now Otama had had no reason to go to her."
女はちょっと考えて、「あの元結ではいかがでございましょう」と云った。,"The woman thought for a moment and said, ""How about that Motoyuki?""","“Will a paper cord for tying hair do?” the mistress asked, after a moment's thought.",The woman thought a moment. “How would some paper twine do?”
こんな事を繰り返し繰り返し思っては、何遍か思想が初の発足点に跡戻をする。そのうちに頭がぼんやりして来て、何がなんだか分からなくなる。しかしとにかく烈しく夫に打っ附かったって駄目だから、よそうと云うことだけは極めることが出来た。,"When I think about this kind of thing over and over again, the thought returns to the point where it first started. Eventually, my head becomes vague and I don't know what it is. However, I couldn't just hit my husband violently, so I was able to master it.","Again and again her thought returned to the point from which they had started. She felt muddled, and she was unable to separate one from the next. Yet somehow she realized that it would be useless to attack Suezo with violence, and she decided to give up that approach at least.","These were the thoughts that went round and round in her mind, and always they returned to the same starting point. Before long her head felt so muddled she could no longer think at all. She was certain of only one thing: that it would be useless to resort to violent argument with her husband. That she must avoid."
二階と違って、その頃からずっと後に、殺風景にも競馬の埒にせられて、それから再び滄桑を閲して、自転車の競走場になった、あの池の縁の往来から見込まれぬようにと、切角の不忍の池に向いた座敷の外は籠塀で囲んである。塀と家との間には、帯のように狭く長い地面があるきりなので、固より庭と云う程の物は作られない。末造の据わっている所からは、二三本寄せて植えた梧桐の、油雑巾で拭いたような幹が見えている。それから春日燈籠が一つ見える。その外には飛び飛びに立っている、小さい側栢があるばかりである。暫く照り続けて、広小路は往来の人の足許から、白い土烟が立つのに、この塀の内は打水をした苔が青々としている。,"Unlike the second floor, long after that time, I was struck by horse racing in the murderous scenery, and then I reviewed the mulberry again so that I could not be expected from the traffic at the edge of the pond, which became a bicycle racetrack. The outside of the tatami room facing the Shinobazunoike pond is surrounded by a basket wall. Since there is only a narrow and long ground like a belt between the wall and the house, it is not possible to make something like a garden. From the place where the Suezo is set up, you can see the trunk of Aokiri, which was planted by a few trees, as if it had been wiped with an oil rag. Then you can see one Kasuga lantern. Outside of that, there are only small arbor-vitaes standing apart. It kept shining for a while, and although white soil was standing on Hirokoji from the footsteps of people coming and going, the inside of this fence was lush with sprinkled moss.","Perhaps he should have taken an upstairs room. But in an upstairs room they might have been seen from the street. Some years later the area around the pond was ruined and made into a race track, and then again, by one of those unusual transformations of the world, into a bicycle track. A long thin strip of land lying between the room and the fence was too narrow for a garden. From where he sat he could see a few paulownia trees, their trunks as smooth and glossy as if they had been polished with oiled rags. He also noticed a stone lantern and some small cypresses planted at intervals. In the busy street white clouds of dust rose, kicked up by the passersby, but here inside the enclosure the servants had sprinkled water over the moss to give the green an added freshness.","Since it was a ground-floor room, it would ordinarily have looked out on the street that runs along the edge of the pond and the unsightly area just beyond that had formerly been a horse racing track but had subsequently been converted for use in bicycle races. To prevent people from looking in, however, a fence had been constructed between the restaurant and the street, thus unfortunately shutting out the view of the pond. The area between the building and the fence was too narrow for a proper garden, but from where Suezō sat he could see two or three pagoda trees in a clump, their trunks as shiny as though polished with oily rags, and a stone lantern. Other than these, there was nothing to be seen but a scattering of little cedars. The evening sun continued to beat down, and beyond the fence clouds of white dust rose from the feet of people passing along the street, but inside the fence the moss shone a cool green from the water that had been sprinkled on it."
「又何か下だらない事を考えているな。よせよせ」上さんの肩の所に手を掛けて、二三遍ゆさぶって置いて、自分の床に据わった。,"""I'm thinking about something that doesn't go down again. Let's do it."" I put my hand on Mr. Ue's shoulder, shook it a few times, and set it on my floor.","“Don't tell me you're worrying about nothing again? Forget it,” he said, repeating the last words and putting his hand on his wife's shoulder. He shook her two or three times and then sat down on his bed.","“Some silly idea on your mind again? Forget it! Forget it!” Suezō put his hand on his wife’s shoulder, gave her two or three gentle shakes, and then sat down on his own sleeping mat."
「して見ると、巡査が虎で、我々三人が酔人だね」と、岡田が冷かした。,"""Looking at it, the policeman is a tiger, and we three are drunk,"" Okada chilled.","“Do you mean then,” said Okada playfully, “that a policeman's a tiger and we are drunks?”","“I see,” said Okada with a laugh. “The policeman is the tiger and we three are drunks.”"
そしてその頭の中には、極めて楽観的な写象が往来している。一体女は何事によらず決心するまでには気の毒な程迷って、とつおいつする癖に、既に決心したとなると、男のように左顧右眄しないで、œillèresオヨイエエルを装われた馬のように、向うばかり見て猛進するものである。思慮のある男には疑懼を懐かしむる程の障礙物が前途に横わっていても、女はそれを屑ともしない。それでどうかすると男の敢てせぬ事を敢てして、おもいの外に成功することもある。お玉は岡田に接近しようとするのに、若し第三者がいて観察したら、もどかしさに堪えまいと思われる程、逡巡していたが、けさ末造が千葉へ立つと云って暇乞に来てから、追手を帆に孕ませた舟のように、志す岸に向って走る気になった。それで梅をせき立てて、親許に返して遣ったのである。邪魔になる末造は千葉へ往って泊る。女中の梅も親の家に帰って泊る。これからあすの朝までは、誰にも掣肘せられることの無い身の上だと感ずるのが、お玉のためには先ず愉快でたまらない。そしてこうとんとん拍子に事が運んで行くのが、終局の目的の容易に達せられる前兆でなくてはならぬように思われる。きょうに限って岡田さんが内の前をお通なさらぬことは決して無い。往反に二度お通なさる日もあるのだから、どうかして一度逢われずにしまうにしても、二度共見のがすようなことは無い。きょうはどんな犠牲を払っても物を言い掛けずには置かない。思い切って物を言い掛けるからは、あの方の足が留められぬ筈が無い。わたしは卑しい妾に身を堕している。しかも高利貸の妾になっている。だけれど生娘でいた時より美しくはなっても、醜くはなっていない。その上どうしたのが男に気に入ると云うことは、不為合な目に逢った物怪の幸に、次第に分かって来ているのである。して見れば、まさか岡田さんに一も二もなく厭な女だと思われることはあるまい。いや。そんな事は確かに無い。若し厭な女だと思ってお出なら、顔を見合せる度に礼をして下さる筈が無い。いつか蛇を殺して下すったのだってそうだ。あれがどこの内の出来事でも、きっと手を藉して下すったのだと云うわけではあるまい。若しわたしの内でなかったら、知らぬ顔をして通り過ぎておしまいなすったかも知れない。それにこっちでこれだけ思っているのだから、皆までとは行かぬにしても、この心が幾らか向うに通っていないことはない筈だ。なに。案じるよりは生むが易いかも知れない。こんな事を思い続けているうちに、小桶の湯がすっかり冷えてしまったのを、お玉はつめたいとも思わずにいた。,"And in his head, extremely optimistic elephants come and go. By the time she decides no matter what, she feels sorry for her, and when she decides already, she doesn't look like a man, like a horse disguised as œillères. , It is something that makes a leap forward just looking away. Even if a thoughtful man has a disability that makes him feel suspicious, the woman does not waste it. Then, somehow, he dares to do something that the man can't do, and sometimes he succeeds outside of his mind. Odama tried to approach Okada, but when he was observed by a third party, he was so crawling that he couldn't stand the frustration. After I came, I felt like running toward the shore I wanted to, like a boat with a pursuit on a sail. So he urged the plums and sent them back to his parents. Suezou who gets in the way goes to Chiba and stays there. Ume, the maid, also returns to her parents' house and stays there. From now on until tomorrow morning, it is fun and irresistible for a ladle to feel that it is a body that no one can squeeze. And it seems that things must be a precursor to the easy achievement of the ultimate goal. Only today, Mr. Okada will never pass in front of the inside. There are days when I go back and forth twice, so even if I don't meet once for some reason, I won't miss it twice. Today I will not put anything without saying anything at all costs. If you take the plunge and say something, that person's foot can't be stopped. I have fallen into a lowly concubinage. Moreover, it is a concubinage of usury. But even though it's more beautiful than when I was a raw daughter, it's not ugly. What's more, what's wrong with a man is gradually becoming known to the luck of a monster who encounters an unreasonable eye. If you look at it, you can't think that Mr. Okada is a nasty woman. no. That is certainly not the case. If you think you're a disgusting woman, you can't thank me every time you look at her face. It seems that he killed the snake one day. No matter where it happened, I'm sure it wasn't the case. If it wasn't inside me, I might have passed by with an unknown face. And since I'm thinking so much over here, I'm sure this heart shouldn't go a little further, if not everyone. what. It may be easier to produce than you think. While I was thinking about this, the ladle didn't even want to fill the tub's hot water when it had cooled completely.","Hopeful images entered her mind. Women pitiably waver in their decisions until they have made up their minds, yet once they have decided on their course of action, they rush forward like horses with blinders, looking neither to the right nor left. An obstacle which would frighten discreet men is nothing to determined women. They dare what men avoid, and sometimes they achieve an unusual success. In Otama's desire to make overtures to Okada, she had delayed so long that a person observing her might have felt impatient because of her indecision. But now that Suezo had told her of his journey to Chiba, she made up her mind to dash toward the port like a ship under full sail in a favorable wind. Suezo, the obstacle in her way, was to remain overnight at Chiba, and the maid was to be at her parents'. What a delight for Otama to find herself quite free of restraints until the following morning! Since everything had turned out so well for her, she thought that it could only be a good omen that she would attain her object. On that day of all days Okada would most certainly pass her house! Sometimes he came by twice, first in going and then in returning. And even if she missed him once, to do so twice was an impossibility. “I don't care what happens—I'll talk to him today! And once I speak, I'm sure he'll stop to talk,” she told herself. She was a degraded woman, true, a usurer's mistress. But she was even more beautiful than when she had been a virgin. In addition, misfortune had taught her what she wouldn't otherwise have known: somehow men were interested in her. And if this were the case, Okada could not look on her with absolute disfavor. No, that was out of the question. If he had disliked her, he would not have continued to bow to her whenever they saw each other. It was because of this same interest that he had killed the snake for her some time ago. She doubted that he would have offered his assistance if the event had happened at any other house. If it had not happened at her house, he wouldn't even have turned his eyes. Moreover, since she cared for him so much, at least some of her affection, if not all of it, must have been felt by him. “Why, even the birth of a child isn't as difficult as one thinks beforehand,” she assured herself. As she probed her thoughts, she was not aware that the water in the bucket had grown cold.","And through her mind passed a succession of the most delightful images. A woman, in any matter whatsoever, will hesitate with pitiful irresolution until she has made up her mind. Once having done so, however, she looks neither to right or left, as a man might, but, like a horse with blinders on, plods steadily toward her goal. Across the path of a thoughtful man lie obstacles of doubt and trepidation that to a woman are no more than dust in the road. Daring things he will not dare, she often succeeds quite beyond expectation. A third party viewing Otama’s efforts to approach Okada might have wearied of their vacillating slowness. But this morning, with Suezō’s departure for Chiba, Otama sped like a ship before a fair wind toward the shore of her destination. She had hurried Ume off to her parents’ place, where the girl would spend the night. And Suezō, who might otherwise obstruct her plans, would be staying the night in Chiba. Now, with all possible restraints and hindrances removed for the day, she felt an uncontrollable joy. For she sensed in this unexpected freedom an omen of certain and easy success. Today Mr. Okada would surely pass by. Often he passed the house twice, so even if she should somehow miss him on his way down the hill, she would certainly meet him as he came back. And today, at whatever cost, she would speak to him without fail. She would speak without fail, and he would of course stop to listen. She had sunk to the position of a mistress, she told herself, the mistress of a moneylender. But she was not ugly. In fact she was better looking now than when she was just a girl. And she had come to realize, albeit through bitter experience, that she was appealing to men. Mr. Okada could not think her completely hateful. Of that she was certain. If he did, he would not nod each time he saw her face, nor indeed would he have killed the snake for her. If that had happened at someone else’s house, he would probably have gone right by without bothering to stop. And although she had not made her feelings entirely clear to him, he could not be wholly unaware of them. Things often turn out to be much easier than one anticipates. As Otama’s thoughts raced along in this fashion, the water in the wooden tub grew cold, but she was unconscious of the change."
「どうするにも及ばないのだ。お前が人が好いもんだから、人に焚き附けられたのだ。妾だの、囲物だのって、誰がそんな事を言ったのだい」こう云いながら、末造はこわれた丸髷のぶるぶる震えているのを見て、醜い女はなぜ似合わない丸髷を結いたがるものだろうと、気楽な問題を考えた。そして丸髷の震動が次第に細かく刻むようになると同時に、どの子供にも十分の食料を供給した、大きい乳房が、懐炉を抱いたように水落の辺に押し附けられるのを末造は感じながら、「誰が言ったのだ」と繰り返した。,"""It doesn't matter what you do. Because you like people, you've been burned by people. Who said that, whether it's a concubinage or an enclosure?"" Seeing Suezou quivering the broken round sword, he wondered why the ugly woman wanted to tie a round sword that didn't look good. And at the same time as the tremors of the round sword gradually chopped up, Suzo felt that the large breasts, which provided enough food for every child, were pressed against the waterfall as if holding a warmer, ""Who? I told you. ""","“You don't have to do a thing. Someone's got you all excited. Who told you I had a mistress or some secret woman or such nonsense?” As he spoke, he noticed her tangled hair against his body, and he speculated on a question one usually considers at a more leisurely moment: Why does an ugly woman insist on arranging her hair in a way that fits only a beautiful one? As the movement of her hair against him became less, he could at the same time feel the pressure from her heavy breasts, which had supplied ample nourishment for each of their children. “Who told you?”","“You don’t have to do anything,” he said. “You’re too good-hearted a person and you’ve let someone take you in. Who’s been telling you about kept women?” Suezō gazed at her marumage hairdo, disheveled now and shaken with sobs, the hairdo of a married woman, and wondered why it was always so unbecoming on a homely woman. And as her sobbing subsided, he shifted his gaze to the big breasts, hanging down to her stomach, that had fed his children so well, and repeated the question. “Who told you that?”"
まあ、なんと云う美しい子だろう。不断から自慢に思って、貧しい中にも荒い事をさせずに、身綺麗にさせて置いた積ではあったが、十日ばかり見ずにいるうちに、まるで生れ替って来たようである。どんな忙しい暮らしをしていても、本能のように、肌に垢の附くような事はしていなかった娘ではあるが、意識して体を磨くようになっているきのうきょうに比べて見れば、爺いさんの記憶にあるお玉の姿は、まだ璞のままであった。親が子を見ても、老人が若いものを見ても、美しいものは美しい。そして美しいものが人の心を和げる威力の下には、親だって、老人だって屈せずにはいられない。,"Well, what a beautiful child! I was always proud of it, and even though I was poor, I kept it clean without doing anything rough, but after 10 days of not seeing it, it seemed like I was reborn. be. No matter how busy I lived, my daughter didn't have any stains on her skin like her instinct, but you can see it compared to yesterday when she was consciously brushing her body. For example, the appearance of the ladle in the old man's memory was still instinct. Whether a parent sees a child or an old man sees a young one, beautiful things are beautiful. And under the power of beautiful things to soothe people's hearts, parents and old people cannot help but give in.","Yes, he thought, she was beautiful. Even when he had been poor, he had insisted that this only source of pride should always look her best, and he had even refused to let her do heavy tasks. But now that he was seeing her for the first time after an absence of ten days, she seemed reborn. Compared to the present Otama, who was consciously grooming and polishing herself, the daughter he remembered was a precious stone in the rough. A parent who sees his own daughter or an old man who sees a young girl cannot deny the beauty of a beautiful object. And such men cannot be exempt from feeling the power that beauty has in easing the heart.","How lovely she was! He had always taken pride in her, and even in the midst of poverty had tried to spare her hardship and to see that she was neatly dressed. But in the ten days since he had seen her last, she seemed to have become a totally different person. No matter how busy she was, she instinctively kept herself clean and neat. But the daughter he remembered from past days was an unpolished gem compared to the carefully groomed woman he now faced. Whether a father perceives it in a daughter or an older man in a young woman, beauty is beauty. And beauty has the power to melt the heart; no father, no older man can resist it."
お玉は小さい紙入を黒襦子の帯の間から出して、幾らか紙に撚って女中に遣って置いて、駒下駄を引っ掛けて、格子戸の外へ出た。,"The ladle took out a small piece of paper from between the black sash belts, twisted it into some paper and sent it to the maid, hooked the piece clogs, and went out of the lattice door.","Otama took a small wallet from the layers of her black sash and gave the maid some money wrapped in paper, put on her low clogs, and left the house.","Otama pulled a little purse from her black satin sash, took out some money and, wrapping it in paper, gave it to the maid. Then she slipped into her clogs and went out the lattice door."
一座の話を黙って聞いているお玉を、末造がちょっと見て云った。,Suezou took a look at the ladle listening to the story of the troupe.,But it surprised him that a student did tour the neighborhood in earnest as a mimic.,"But Suezō had not supposed that any student would actually go around doing kabuki impersonations. He turned to Otama, who had been listening to the conversation in silence."
家の中の事を生帳面にしたがる末造には、こんな不始末を見ているのが苦痛でならない。しかしこうなった元は分かっていて、自分が悪いのだと思うので、小言を言うわけにも行かない。それに末造は平生小言を言う場合にも、笑談のように手軽に言って、相手に反省させるのを得意としているのに、その笑談らしい態度が却って女房の機嫌を損ずるように見える。,"It is not a pain to see such a mischief for the end-of-life that wants to keep things in the house as a notebook. However, I know the cause of this, and I think I'm wrong, so I can't even make a small comment. In addition, Suezou is good at making the other person reflect on him by saying it as easily as a laugh, even when he says a small word, but his laugh-like attitude seems to hurt his wife's mood.","With his passion for order, Suezo found the slovenly state of his home painful. But he couldn't complain because he knew that the cause and the fault were his own. He had prided himself on his ability to correct others by alluding to their weaknesses in a light-hearted manner, but he found that his wife became even more violent when he tried to humor her.","Suezō, who liked everything in his home neat and methodical, could not help feeling pained by this disorder. But as he realized it was his own fault, he could hardly complain. It had always been his custom when reproving others to do so in a light, jesting manner that was intended to make the other party reflect on his or her own failings, but this laughing air of his now seemed only to aggravate Otsune’s irritation."
「好く古本屋で出くわすじゃないか」と云うような事を、どっちからか言い出したのが、親しげに物を言った始である。,"It was the beginning of my friendly talk that I said something like ""I would come across it at a second-hand bookstore.""","I don't remember who spoke first, but I do recall the first words between us: “How often we meet among old books!” This was the start of our friendship.",Around that time there was a store on the corner at the foot of the slope leading to the Kanda Myōjin Shrine that had set out a U-shaped stall spread with secondhand books.
末造は一夜も泊って行かない。しかし毎晩のように来る。例の婆あさんが世話をして、梅と云う、十三になる小女を一人置いて、台所で子供の飯事のような真似をさせているだけなので、お玉は次第に話相手のない退屈を感じて、夕方になれば、早く檀那が来てくれれば好いと待つ心になって、それに気が附いて、自分で自分を笑うのである。鳥越にいた時も、お父っさんが商売に出た跡で、お玉は留守に独りで、内職をしていたが、もうこれだけ為上げれば幾らになる、そうしたらお父っさんが帰って驚くだろうと励んでいたので、近所の娘達と親しくしないお玉も、退屈だと思ったことはなかったのである。それが生活の上の苦労がなくなると同時に、始て退屈と云うことを知った。,"Suezou doesn't stay overnight. But it comes like every night. The old lady takes care of her and puts a little girl named Ume, who becomes thirteen, to imitate a child's meal in the kitchen, so the ladle gradually gets bored with no one to talk to. Feel it, and in the evening, if Danna comes early, I will wait for it, and I will notice it and laugh at myself. Even when I was in Torigoe, my dad was in the business, and Odama was alone in the absence and had a job at home. I was so excited that I would be surprised, so I never thought that a ladle that wasn't close to my neighbor's daughters was boring. At the same time that it eliminated the hardships of life, I learned that it was boring for the first time.","On these visits Suezo made it a point to appear almost every evening, though he never stayed the entire night. With the help of the go-between, Otama had hired a maid. Ume was only thirteen, and she did the kitchen work, which, Otama could not help feeling, was little more than having a child play a pleasant game. The result was that Otama did not have enough to do during the day and was left without anyone to talk to. She would find herself wishing for her master to come earlier in the evening and would smile at the change taking place in herself. Before, the situation had been different. She had also been alone while her father was out selling his candies, but during his absence she had taken in piece-work. She had not even had the friendship of the girls in the neighborhood, yet she had never regretted the loss, had never even been bored. She would think only of the sum she would receive upon completing the task. There would be her father's surprise, his smile of pleasure because of her diligence. Yes, she had worked hard in those days. But now it was different, and she was beginning to feel the pains of ennui.","Suezō never spent the night, but he came every evening. Through the go-between, he had engaged a young servant girl of thirteen named Ume who romped around the kitchen like a little child playing house. But having no other companion than this to talk to, Otama would by evening begin to feel extremely bored and to long impatiently for Suezō’s visit, though she laughed at herself for doing so. When she was living in Torigoe and her father was off at work, leaving her alone to mind the house all day, she would busy herself making the candies that he sold. If I get so many done, she would think, spurring herself on, Papa will surely be surprised when he comes home. So, though she hardly knew any of the other girls in the neighborhood, she had never felt particularly bored. Now, when life had at last become easy for her, she learned for the first time what boredom meant."
「何がも何も無いじゃないか。君だってさっきからあの女の事を思って歩いていたに違ない。僕は度々振り返って見たが、あの女はいつまでも君の後影を見ていた。おおかたまだこっちの方角を見て立っているだろう。あの左伝の、目迎えて而してこれを送ると云う文句だねえ。あれをあべこべに女の方で遣っているのだ」,"""Isn't there anything? You must have been walking thinking of that woman from a while ago. I often looked back, but she was always looking at your back. Most of the time, I'm still standing looking in this direction. It's a complaint from that left biography that I'll greet you and send this. I'm sending it to a woman. ""","“Don't pretend with me. Why, you must have been thinking about that woman ever since you saw her. I turned around a number of times, and she was always watching you. She's probably standing there right now and looking in this direction. It's just as it's described in the Saden: ‘His eyes received her and saw her off.' Only in your case it's just the reverse.”","“What do you mean, what’s that? You’ve been thinking about that woman all along, haven’t you! I turned around a couple of times to see, and she just kept on looking in your direction. She’s probably still looking this way.

Students could use it as a foreign ambassador. Most of the shopping for students wearing Kokura hakama on the white cotton obi is extremely popular. They are so-called ""yokan"" and ""konpeito"". The fact that yokan was roasted sweet potato and konpeito was poppy bean may be worth writing down as a reference in the history of civilization. The ambassador was supposed to receive two sen for one rent.","The dormitory had servants whom the students could use for errands. They usually sent out to buy something cheap to eat, like baked beans or roasted sweet potatoes. For each trip the servant received two sen.","At the dormitory were porters, dressed in hakama-type trousers of duck with white cotton waist bands, who ran errands for the students. The items the students most often sent out for were yōkan and kompeitō. For those interested in cultural history, it may be worth noting that the former refers to roasted potatoes and the latter to parched beans. Porters fetching such items received two sen per errand."
それからお玉が末造を遇することは愈厚くなって、お玉の心は愈末造に疎くなった。そして末造に世話になっているのが難有くもなく、自分が末造の為向けてくれる事を恩に被ないでも、それを末造に対して気の毒がるには及ばぬように感ずる。それと同時に又なんの躾をも受けていない芸なしの自分ではあるが、その自分が末造の持物になって果てるのは惜しいように思う。とうとう往来を通る学生を見ていて、あの中に若し頼もしい人がいて、自分を今の境界から救ってくれるようにはなるまいかとまで考えた。そしてそう云う想像に耽る自分を、忽然意識した時、はっと驚いたのである。,"After that, it became more and more difficult for the ladle to treat the ladles, and the heart of the ladle became ignorant of the ladles.

At the same time, although I am a self-disciplined person who has not received any discipline, I feel sorry for myself to become a last-minute possession.

And when I suddenly realized myself indulging in such an imagination, I was surprised.","Her treatment of Suezo became more cordial but her heart more remote. She came to feel that he did not deserve her gratitude for the protection he gave her, nor could she feel obligated to him for what he did. She did not even feel sorry for him because of her indifference. Conversely, in spite of the fact that she had no accomplishment she could boast of, she couldn't help thinking: “Ah, to be only a usurer's possession all my life.” And watching the students in their walks along the street, she began to speculate: “Isn't there a hero out there? I'll be rescued!” But when she suddenly found herself indulging in such fancies, she was startled.","In her attitude toward Suezō she became increasingly warm as her heart grew increasingly distant. She no longer felt grateful for his favors or indebted to him, nor could she feel pity for him that this was so. It seemed to her that, for all her lack of fine upbringing and education, she was utterly wasted on such a person. Among the people passing by her window, she began to wonder, was there not some trustworthy young man who would rescue her from her present predicament? It was when she first became aware of imaginings of this nature that she started in surprise."

その時末造が或る女を思い出した。それは自分が練塀町の裏からせまい露地を抜けて大学へ通勤する時、折々見たことのある女である。どぶ板のいつもこわれているあたりに、年中戸が半分締めてある、薄暗い家があって、夜その前を通って見れば、簷下に車の附いた屋台が挽き込んであるので、そうでなくても狭い露地を、体を斜にして通らなくてはならない。最初末造の注意を惹いたのは、この家に稽古三味線の音のすることであった。それからその三味線の音の主が、十六七の可哀らしい娘だと云うことを知った。貧しそうな家には似ず、この娘がいつも身綺麗にしていて、着物も小ざっぱりとした物を着ていた。戸口にいても、人が通るとすぐ薄暗い家の中へ引っ込んでしまう。何事にも注意深い性質の末造は、わざわざ探るともなしに、この娘が玉と云う子で、母親がなくて、親爺と二人暮らしでいると云う事、その親爺は秋葉の原に飴細工の床店を出していると云う事などを知った。そのうちにこの裏店に革命的変動が起った。例の簷下に引き入れてあった屋台が、夜通って見てもなくなった。いつもひっそりしていた家とその周囲とへ、当時の流行語で言うと、開化と云うものが襲ってでも来たのか、半分こわれて、半分はね返っていたどぶ板が張り替えられたり、入口の模様替が出来て、新しい格子戸が立てられたりした。或る時入口に靴の脱いであるのを見た。それから間もなく、この家の戸口に新しい標札が打たれたのを見ると、巡査何の何某と書いてあった。末造は松永町から、仲徒町へ掛けて、色々な買物をして廻る間に、又探るともなしに、飴屋の爺いさんの内へ壻入のあった事を慥めた。標札にあった巡査がその壻なのである。お玉を目の球よりも大切にしていた爺いさんは、こわい顔のおまわりさんに娘を渡すのを、天狗にでも撈われるように思い、その壻殿が自分の内へ這入り込んで来るのを、この上もなく窮屈に思って、平生心安くする誰彼に相談したが、一人もことわってしまえとはっきり云ってくれるものがなかった。それ見た事か。こっちとらが宜い所へ世話をしようと云うのに、一人娘だから出されぬのなんのと、面倒な事を言っていて、とうとうそんなことわり憎い壻さんが来るようになったと云うものもある。お前方の方で厭なのなら、遠い所へでも越すより外あるまいが、相手がおまわりさんで見ると、すぐにどこへ越したと云うことを調べて、その先へ掛け合うだろうから、どうも逃げ果せることは出来まいと、威すように云うものもある。中にも一番物分かりの好いと云う評判のお上さんの話がこうだ。「あの子はあんな好い器量で、お師匠さんも芸が出来そうだと云って褒めてお出だから、早く芸者の下地子にお出しと、わたしがそう云ったじゃありませんか。一人もののおまわりさんと来た日には、一軒一軒見て廻るのだから、子柄の好いのを内に置くと、いやおうなしに連れて行ってしまいなさる。どうもそう云う方に見込まれたのは、不運だとあきらめるより外、為方がないね」と云うような事を言ったそうだ。末造がこの噂を聞いてから、やっと三月ばかりも立った頃であっただろう。飴細工屋の爺いさんの家に、或る朝戸が締まっていて、戸に「貸屋差配松永町西のはずれにあり」と書いて張ってあった。そこで又近所の噂を、買物の序に聞いて見ると、おまわりさんには国に女房も子供もあったので、それが出し抜けに尋ねて来て、大騒ぎをして、お玉は井戸へ身を投げると云って飛び出したのを、立聞をしていた隣の上さんがようよう止めたと云うことであった。おまわりさんが壻に来ると云う時、爺いさんは色々の人に相談したが、その相談相手の中には一人も爺いさんの法律顧問になってくれるものがなかったので、爺いさんは戸籍がどうなっているやら、どんな届がしてあるやら一切無頓着でいたのである。巡査が髭を拈って、手続は万事己がするから好いと云うのを、少しも疑わなかったのである。その頃松永町の北角と云う雑貨店に、色の白い円顔で腮の短い娘がいて、学生は「頤なし」と云っていた。この娘が末造にこう云った。「本当にたあちゃんは可哀そうでございますわねえ。正直な子だもんですから、全くのお壻さんだと思っていたのに、おまわりさんの方では、下宿したような積になっていたと云うのですもの」と云った。坊主頭の北角の親爺が傍から口を出した。「爺いさんも気の毒ですよ。町内のお方にお恥かしくて、このままにしてはいられないと云って、西鳥越の方へ越して行きましたよ。それでも子供衆のお得意のある所でなくては、元の商売が出来ないと云うので、秋葉の原へは出ているそうです。屋台も一度売ってしまって、佐久間町の古道具屋の店に出ていたのを、わけを話して取り返したと云うことです。そんな事やら、引越やらで、随分掛かった筈ですから、さぞ困っていますでしょう。おまわりさんが国の女房や子供を干し上げて置いて、大きな顔をして酒を飲んで、上戸でもない爺いさんに相手をさせていた間、まあ、一寸楽隠居になった夢を見たようなものですな」と、頭をつるりと撫でて云った。それから後、末造は飴屋のお玉さんの事を忘れていたのに、金が出来て段々自由が利くようになったので、ふいと又思い出したのである。,"At that time, Suzo remembered a woman. It is a woman I have seen from time to time when I commute to university from the back of Neribeicho through a narrow open field. Around the time when the dobu board is always broken, there is a dim house with half-closed doors all year round, and if you look through it at night, you can see that the stall with a car is ground under the eaves. Even if it isn't, you have to lean your body through a narrow open field. The first thing that attracted the attention of the last generation was the sound of the rehearsal shamisen in this house. Then I learned that the lord of the shamisen sound was the poor daughter of 167. Not like a poor house, this girl was always clean and she wore a small kimono. Even if you are in the doorway, as soon as people pass by, you will be retracted into a dimly lit house. The end of the work, which is careful about everything, is that this daughter is a child called a ball, has no mother, and lives with her relatives, and that relative is a candy work in Akihabara. I learned that they have a floor shop in Akihabara. In the meantime, a revolutionary change occurred in this back shop. The stalls that had been pulled in under the eaves disappeared even after going through the night. In the popular language of the time, the house and its surroundings, which were always quiet, might have been attacked by something called Kaika, which was half broken and half rebounded. It was possible to replace it, and a new lattice door was erected. At one point I saw my shoes off at the entrance. Shortly thereafter, when I saw a new nameplate struck at the door of this house, it said what the policeman was. Suezou mourned that there was a jar inside the old man of the candy store while he went from Matsunaga-cho to Nakatsu-cho and went shopping for various things. The policeman on the nameplate is the jar. The old man, who valued the ladle more than the ball of his eyes, thought that he would give his daughter to a scary-faced policeman, even if he was a tengu, and he saw the pot crawl into himself. Feeling extremely cramped, I consulted with him who would make me feel cheaper, but none of them could tell me clearly. Have you seen it? There is also a thing that he said that he was trying to take care of him in a good place, but he was not given out because he was the only daughter, and he was saying troublesome things, and finally a hateful pot came to come. .. If you don't mind being in front of you, it's better than going to a distant place, but when the other person sees you with a policeman, you'll find out where you've gone immediately, and you'll get in touch with them, so run away. Some say that it cannot be done, and that it is intimidating. This is the story of a man who has a reputation for being the most understandable. ""That child has such a good luck, and he praised him for being able to perform arts, so I told him to give it to the geisha's base child as soon as possible. On that day, I'll go around each house one by one, so if I put my favorite child inside, I'll take him away without hesitation. There is no way to do it outside, ""he said. It must have been about March since Suezou heard this rumor. At the old man's house of Amezaiku, a certain morning door was closed, and the door was marked with the words, ""It's on the western edge of Matsunaga-cho, a rental house."" Then, when I heard the rumors of the neighborhood again at the beginning of shopping, the policeman had a wife and a child in the country, so he asked for a breakout, made a fuss, and the ladle threw himself into the well. It was said that Mr. Ue, who was listening, stopped him from jumping out. When the policeman came to the jar, he consulted with various people, but none of the counselors could be his legal counsel, so what about his family register? No matter what kind of notification was given, he was completely indifferent. There was no doubt that the policeman had a beard and said that he liked the procedure because he would do everything himself. At that time, there was a daughter with a white round face and a short chin at a general store called North Point in Matsunaga-cho, and the student said, ""No gills."" This girl said to Suezou. ""I'm really sorry for Ta-chan. I'm an honest child, so I thought he was a jar, but the policeman said that he was a boarding house. I said. A relative of the north point of the shaved head spoke from the side. ""I'm sorry for the old man. I was embarrassed by the people in the town and said that I couldn't leave it as it was, so I went to Nishitorikoshi. Still, it's not the place where the children are good at. He said that he couldn't do the original business, so he went to Akihabara. He sold the stalls once and went to the old tool shop in Sakuma-cho. It's said that he got it back. It must have taken a long time to move, so it would be a problem. The policeman dried up the country's wife and children, left them with a big face, and drank. It's like having a dream of becoming a retired house while I was letting an old man who wasn't a food stall deal with me, ""he said, stroking his head. After that, Suezou had forgotten about the ladle of the candy store, but he was able to make money and gradually became more free, so he remembered it again.","At that time he remembered a certain woman he had seen every so often while he was still going to the university through a narrow alley from his house at the back of Neribei-cho. There was a dark house whose ditchboards in that alley were always partly broken and half of whose sliding shutters were closed all year round. At night, when anyone passed, he had to go sideways because of a wheeled stall drawn up under the eaves. What first attracted Suezo's attention to this house was the music of the samisen inside. And then he learned that the person playing the instrument was a lovely girl about sixteen or seventeen years old. The neat kimono she wore was quite different from the shabby appearance of her house. If the girl happened to be in the doorway, as soon as she saw a man approaching she went back into the dark interior. Suezo, with his characteristic alertness, though without particularly investigating the matter, found out that the girl's name was Otama, that her mother was dead, and that she lived alone with her father, who sold sugary, sticky candies molded into figures in his stall. But eventually a change took place in this back-street house. The wheeled stall vanished from its set place under the eaves. And the house and its surroundings, which were always modest, seemed suddenly attacked by what was then fashionably called “civilization,” for new boards over the ditch replaced the broken and warped ones, and a new lattice door had been installed at the entrance. Once Suezo noticed a pair of Western shoes in the doorway. Soon after, a new name plate bearing a policeman's title was put up. Suezo also made certain, while shopping on the neighboring streets and yet without seeming to pry, that the old candy dealer had acquired a son-in-law. To the old man, who loved his daughter more than sight itself, the loss of Otama to a policeman with terrifying looks was like having her carried off by a monster with a long nose and a red face. Otama's father had feared the discomfort he would incur by the intrusion of such a formidable son-in-law, and after meeting the suitor, had consulted with several confidants, but none of them had told him to reject the offer. Someone said: “You see, I told you so, didn't I? When I took the trouble to arrange a good match, you were too particular, saying you couldn't part with your only child, so that finally a son-in-law you couldn't say no to is going to move in on you!” And another said threateningly: “If you can't stand the man, the only other solution is to move far away, but since he's a policeman, he'll be able to catch up with you and make his offer again. There's no escaping him.” A wife who had a reputation for using her head was believed to have told the old man: “Didn't I advise you to sell her off to a geisha house since her looks were good and her samisen master praised her skill? A policeman without a wife can go from door to door, and when he finds a pretty face, he takes her off whether you like it or not. You can't do anything but make the best of the bad luck that such a man took a fancy to your daughter.” No more than three months after Suezo had heard these rumors, he discovered one morning that the doors of the old candy dealer's house were locked and that an attached piece of paper gave notice that the house was for rent. Then, on inquiring further into the neighbors' talk while shopping, Suezo heard that the policeman had in his own native place a wife and children who had turned up on a surprise visit, whereupon a fight followed, and Otama ran from the house. A neighbor who overheard the quarrel stopped the girl from doing something rash. Not one of the old man's friends had enough knowledge about legal matters, so the old man had been quite indifferent about seeing if the marriage had been legally registered, and when the son-in-law told him he would completely handle the legal end of the marriage, the old man had had no suspicions or fears. A girl at Kitazumi's grocery said to Suezo: “I really feel sorry for Taa-chan —she's honest and she had no doubt about the policeman, but he said he was only looking for a place to live.” And with his hand circling his cropped head of hair, the storekeeper interrupted her: “It's a pity about the old man too. He moved away because he couldn't stand meeting his neighbors and he couldn't stay here as before. But he still sells candy where he used to, saying he can't do business in places where there are no little customers. A while back he sold his stall, but now he has it again from the second-hand dealer, after telling him the situation. I think he's got financial troubles because of the moving and such. It's as though the old man lived for only a short time in a world of dreams, freeing himself into easy retirement and keeping company with the policeman, who drank saké, acting like a god, while, in fact, he starved his wife and children in the country.” After that, the candy dealer's daughter slipped from Suezo's mind, but when he became financially well off and could do more of what he wanted, he happened to remember the girl.","It was then that he remembered a girl he used to see from time to time when he came through the streets from Neribeichō on his way to the university. Threading along an alley lined with broken gutter boards, he would pass a dimly lit house, its door always half shut and, in the evenings, a pushcart parked under its eaves, making the alley, narrow to begin with, so crowded one could not pass without turning sideways. It was the sound of someone practicing the samisen that first attracted his attention. The owner of the instrument, he discovered, was an attractive girl of sixteen or seventeen who, in spite of the poverty of her surroundings, always appeared fresh and neat and attired in a clean kimono. If she happened to be standing in the door when anyone passed, she would invariably withdraw in haste to the dim recesses of the house. Suezō, alert to everything around him, soon learned through chance that the girl’s name was Otama, that her mother was dead, and that she lived alone with her father, who sold little candies fashioned in fanciful shapes in a stall in Akihanohara. Sometime after acquiring this information, Suezō became aware of a revolutionary change in the house. The pushcart was no longer parked by the eaves at night. The little house and its surroundings, usually so quiet, had, it seems, to use the phraseology of the time, entered upon an “era of enlightenment.” The warped or broken gutter boards were replaced, the entranceway was made more sightly by the installation of a new lattice door, and at one point Suezō spied a pair of Western-style shoes in the doorway. Not long after, a new nameplate appeared by the front door bearing the name of Officer So-and-so of the police force. In the course of his shopping errands in Matsunagachō and Nakaokachimachi, Suezō learned, once more by chance, that the old candy seller had acquired a son-in-law, the policeman whose name appeared at the door. Otama was more precious to the old man than life itself, and to hand her over to some fierce-looking officer of the law seemed more dreadful than having her snatched away by goblins. And he was appalled at the thought of such a son-in-law actually moving into the house with him. Before agreeing to the arrangement, therefore, he discussed it with a number of persons he had known over the years, but not one of them advised him in so many words to reject the policeman’s proposal of marriage. Some chided him for having turned down perfectly good marriage proposals in the past, claiming that he could not bear to part with an only daughter, yet now he was confronted with an offer that was all but impossible to refuse. Others said that if he could not bring himself to agree, the only alternative was to move somewhere far away, though they warned that, since the other party was a police officer, he could doubtless find out at once where the old man had moved and go after him. So in the end even running away was out of the question. One of the nearby housewives whose judgment was held in high esteem was said to have told him flatly: “A lovely girl like Otama, her samisen teacher praising her and saying she has all sorts of promise—didn’t I tell you to send her off as soon as possible to be trained as a geisha? When an unmarried policeman comes from house to house looking for a wife, if you have a pretty daughter at home, he’s going to make off with her whether you like it or not. It’s just your bad luck that that’s the sort of fellow who spotted her—you have to make the best of it!” About three months after Suezō heard rumors of these happenings, he one morning noticed the door of the old candy-seller’s closed and a sign posted on it that read: “House for rent. Inquire at west edge of Matsunagachō.” Picking up bits of gossip in the course of his shopping, Suezō learned that the policeman already had a wife and family back home in the country. They had suddenly turned up without warning and there had been a fearful row. Otama had dashed out of the house, declaring she was going to throw herself down the well, and had been stopped just in time by the wife next door, who had overheard what was going on. When the old man was first considering the policeman’s proposal, he consulted various people, but none were the sort who could give him advice on the legal questions involved. He had not the slightest idea what steps had been taken to register the marriage or file the necessary official notifications. When the policeman, stroking his moustache, had said he would take care of all such matters himself, the old man had accepted his word without the least suspicion. At that time there was a grocery store in Matsunagachō called Kitazumi. The daughter of the owner, a pale, round-faced girl with a chin so recessive that the students referred to her as “Chinless,” remarked to Suezō, “I really feel sorry for Otama! She’s so trusting a soul she thought she had a real husband, but for the policeman it was just a place to spend the night!” “It’s a shame about the old man too,” added the proprietor of the store who was standing nearby. “ He said he was too ashamed to face the neighbors anymore and so he moved all the way to Nishitorigoe. But none of the children in that neighborhood have ever been his customers, so he still goes to his old location in Akihanohara to set up his candy stall. At one point he even sold his pushcart. It was on sale in a secondhand furniture store in Sakumachō, but he explained to the man what had happened and got it back again. With all that and moving his house too, it must have cost him quite a sum—more than he can afford, I’m sure. The policeman went off leaving his wife and children in the country to fend for themselves while he drank saké in town and acted big. He even had the old man, who was never a drinker, keeping him company. For a while the old man must have thought he was dreaming, living the life of a retired gentleman!” exclaimed the proprietor, rubbing his bald head."
「それは言ったってかまいませんとも。魚金のお上さんなの」,"""I don't mind saying that. It's a fish gold boss.""",“All right. The wife of the fish dealer—Uwokin.”,"he demanded. “All right, I don’t care."

The ladle, who turned his back to Suezou while washing his face, didn't know this, but when he washed it and pulled the mirror stand, he saw a face holding a paper roll of Suezou.","Before long, Suezo turned around. While she was washing, she didn't notice that he had turned, but after finishing and drawing the mirror stand in front of her, she saw his face in it, the cigarette still in his mouth.","Suezō sat looking the other way for a while, but soon resumed his former position. Otama, busy with her washing, was not aware of the change until she pulled the mirror stand toward her and spied his face, the cigarette in his mouth."
そのうち秋日和に窓を開けていて、又岡田と会釈を交す日があっても、切角親しく物を言って、手拭を手渡ししたのが、少しも接近の階段を形づくらずにしまって、それ程の事のあった後が、何事もなかった前と、なんの異なる所もなくなっていた。お玉はそれをひどくじれったく思った。,"Even though I had opened the window in Akihiwa and had a day with Okada, I talked to him and handed him a towel, but he didn't form the approaching stairs at all. After that, there was no difference from before nothing happened. The ladle wanted it to be terrible.","There were some fine autumn days when she could keep her window open and exchange a salute with Okada, but their relationship remained unchanged since that memorable event, and no new state of intimacy developed from her having spoken to him once and having handed him a towel. And the situation was more than frustrating for her.","But although at the time of the snake incident she had been able to speak with him in an intimate manner, and had even had occasion to hand him a towel, this did not seem to have advanced their acquaintance by any appreciable degree. Instead they reverted to their earlier formality, as though nothing had passed between them, leaving Otama feeling highly vexed. When Suezō came to see her"
それでも近所には、あの隠居の内へ尋ねて来る好い女はなんだろうと穿鑿して、とうとう高利貸の妾だそうだと突き留めたものもある。若し両隣に口のうるさい人でもいると、爺いさんがどんなに心安立をせずにいても、無理にも厭な噂を聞せられるのだが、為合せな事には一方の隣が博物館の属官で、法帖なんぞをいじって手習ばかりしている男、一方の隣がもう珍らしいものになっている板木師で、篆刻なんぞには手を出さぬ男だから、どちらも爺いさんの心の平和を破るような虞はない。まだ並んでいる家の中で、店を開けて商売をしているのは蕎麦屋の蓮玉庵と煎餅屋と、その先きのもう広小路の角に近い処の十三屋と云う櫛屋との外には無かった時代である。,"Still, there are some in the neighborhood who wondered what the favorite woman was asking inside that retreat and finally found out that she was a concubinage of usury. If there are noisy people on both sides, no matter how uneasy the old man is, he can hear rumors that he is uncomfortable. A man who is an official and is just practicing by playing with copybooks, and a man who is a Itakishi who has become a rare thing next to him, and a man who does not touch the museum, so both are the hearts of the old man. There is no danger of breaking the peace of the world. Among the houses that are still lined up, the ones that open the store and do business are the soba restaurant Rengyokuan and the rice cracker shop, and the comb shop called Juso-ya near the corner of Hirokoji. It was an era that was not outside of.","Nevertheless, some of his neighbors wondered about the fair visitor to the old man's house, and at last they identified her as the usurer's mistress. If the neighbors on both sides of the old man's house had been chatterboxes, the unpleasant report might have somehow reached him in spite of the lack of communication between them. But fortunately they were not likely to disturb his peace of mind, for one of them was a minor clerk at a museum who spent of all his leisure hours collecting model copy-books of Chinese characters and learning how to use the brush, and the other man was an engraver who had remained at the old craft in spite of his fellow-craftsmen's having abandoned the trade in order to make seals. Of the houses in the same row as the old man's, the trading places included only a noodle restaurant, a rice-cake shop, and a store dealing in combs. Even before the old man heard his daughter's gentle greeting, he was conscious of her visit from the movement of the door and the light step of her clogs.","But there were persons in the neighborhood who wondered who the attractive young woman was that visited the old man, and they in time succeeded in finding out that she was the mistress of a moneylender. If the parties living on either side of Otama’s father had been of a gossipy nature, they would no doubt have forced their unwelcome rumors on him no matter how disinclined he was to listen. Fortunately, however, the neighbor on one side was a minor museum employee who spent his time practicing calligraphy with the aid of copybooks, while on the other side was a woodblock engraver, continuing to practice his craft rather than abandon it for the more profitable seal engraving. Neither was the type likely to disturb the old man’s peace of mind. At this time the only houses along the street that had been converted to commercial use were the Rengyokuan, specializing in buckwheat noodle dishes, a store selling rice cakes, and farther along toward the corner of Hirokōji, a comb store called Jūsanya. When the old man heard someone come in the lattice door, if he caught the sound of light wooden clogs, he knew even before he heard her soft voice that Otama had come."
僕は岡田の机の横の方に胡坐を搔いた。「そうだねえ。僕の親父は二百十日のなし崩しと称している」,"I shook crossed legs next to Okada's desk. ""That's right. My dad calls it the 210th day of destruction.""",". . Annoying pests!” I went to the side of his desk and sat there informally, saying: “My father calls it paying for Two Hundred and Tenth in instalments.”",I sat down beside Okada’s desk. “You’re right about the weather. My father says we’re getting the 210th in installments.”
「なんの事だ。呆れたものだぜ。好い加減にしろい。なる程お前に横浜で買って遣った時は、サンプルで来たのだと云うことだったが、もう今頃は銀座辺でざらに売っているに違ない。芝居なんぞに好くある奴で、これがほんとの無実の罪と云うのだ。そして何かい。お前、あの吉田さんの女に、どこかで逢ったとでも云うのかい。好く分かったなあ」,"""What's the matter? It's a surprise. It's just a matter of course. I see, when you bought it in Yokohama, it was said that it came as a sample, but now it's rough in Ginza. It must be for sale. He is a favorite of plays, and this is a true innocent sin. And something. You could say that you met that Yoshida-san's woman somewhere. I understand it well. ""","“Is that the only thing you're getting excited about? What an idiot you are! Look. I'm warning you—don't carry your silliness too far. When I bought that parasol for you, they told me it had just come in as a sample. I'm certain of that. But the same kind must easily be available on the Ginza by now and in the neighborhood. I assure you that this case is the same as the play with the theme of the innocent man who was found guilty. Tell me, Otsune, have you met Yoshida's mistress? I don't see how you could have identified her.”","“Oh, this is too silly! Please, now. When I bought the parasol in Yokohama, I remember the man said it was a sample that had just come in. So by now the same article must be on sale anywhere on the Ginza. And because of that I get unjustly accused, like some poor fellow in a play! I take it you ran into Yoshida’s woman somewhere. But how did you know her?”"
末造夫婦は新に不調和の階級を進める程の衝突をせずに、一月ばかりも暮していた。つまりその間は末造の詭弁が功を奏していたのである。然るに或る日意外な辺から破綻が生じた。,"The young couple lived for only a month without a conflict enough to advance a new dissonant class. In other words, during that time, the sophistry of Suezou was successful. However, one day a bankruptcy occurred from an unexpected side.","About a month had passed without Suezo and his wife colliding into any battles. Until then his sophistry had been effective, but it was broken through from an unexpected quarter.","In effect, Suezō acted as a kind of commissariat for frequenters of the pleasure quarter. Suezō and his wife continued for a month without further friction; so long was Suezō’s sophistry effective. It was from an unexpected direction one morning that a new discord arose."
この話はこれだけで済んだ。とうとうしまいには末造が、そんなにおっくうがるようなら、自分が朝出掛けて来て、四五町の道を連れて行って遣ろうかなどとも云った。,"That's all for this story. At last, Suezou said that if he was so sick, he would go out in the morning and take him along the road in Shigomachi.","The matter ended there. Later, he even said with humorous gallantry: “If it's so much trouble, I'll come around in the morning and take you.","And there the matter ended, for Suezō went so far as to say that if she found it bothersome to go alone, he would come in the morning and go with her the four or five blocks to her father’s house."
お上さんはしゃくり上げながら、又末造の手にしがみ附いた。「どこにだって、あなたのような人があるでしょうか。いくらお金が出来たって、自分ばかり檀那顔をして、女房には着物一つ拵えてはくれずに、子供の世話をさせて置いて、好い気になって妾狂いをするなんて」,"The boss shook up and clung to the hand of Suezou again. ""Where is there a person like you? No matter how much money you make, you just look like yourself, don't give your wife a kimono, but take care of your children. I don't want to be crazy about it. ""","But she grabbed his arm again and cried: “Is there another person like you in the whole world? You've made a lot of money, but is there anyone else who dresses up like a gentleman and leaves his wife with nothing? Without even a kimono? Letting her take care of the children! Yet—yet so conceited that he takes up with a whore!”",She seized his hand again and spoke through her sobs. “What kind of man are you? You manage to make a little money and then you go around like a lord and won’t even buy your wife so much as a new kimono. Leave me here to look after the children while you go running after some woman!”
もう内を飛び出してから余程時間が立ったように思って、川岸を跡へ引き返しつつ懐時計を出して見た。まだやっと十一時である。内を出てから三十分も立ってはいぬのである。,"I thought it had been a long time since I jumped out of the house, so I turned back to the ruins of the riverbank and took out my watch. It's only 11 o'clock. He hasn't stood for thirty minutes since he left the inside.","Suezo thought he had been out for quite some time, but when he glanced at his watch as he continued along the edge of the river, it was eleven, only a half hour since his departure, perhaps less.","It seemed as though considerable time had passed since Suezō fled from his house, and as he turned away from the riverbank, he took out his pocket watch and examined it. It was only eleven o’clock. Less than thirty minutes had passed since he left home."
「好いどころじゃない。実はさっき帰ってからぼんやりしていた所へ、君が隣へ帰って来てがたがた云わせたので、奮って明りでも附けようと云う気になったのだ」こん度は声がはっきりしている。,"""I don't like it. Actually, I was confused when you came back to the place where I had been vague since I came back, so I was motivated to attach it even in the light."" The voice is clear.","“That's what I was hoping. I came back quite a while ago, and I've done nothing since. When I heard you, I was aroused and thought I'd light my lamp.” This time he answered me in a clear voice.",“Why would I mind? I just got back myself and was sitting here thinking about nothing when I heard you rattling around. Then I decided to get up and light the lamp.” This time he spoke distinctly.
「届くことは届くが、中るか中らぬかが疑問だ」と、岡田は答えた。,"""It will arrive, but it is doubtful whether it will be inside or not,"" Okada replied.","“Of course, but I don't know if I can hit anything or not.”","“I could throw that far all right, but whether I could hit anything is another matter,” Okada replied."
末造はいつもより早く内を出たり、いつもより遅く内へ帰ったりするようになった。しかしその結果は非常に悪かった。早く出た時は、女房が最初は只驚いて黙って見ていた。遅く帰った時は、最初の度にいつもの拗ねて見せる消極的手段と違って、もう我慢がし切れない、勘忍袋の緒が切れたと云う風で、「あなた今までどこにいましたの」と詰め寄って来た。そして爆発的に泣き出した。その次の度からは早く出ようとすると、「あなた今からどこへ行くのです」と云って、無理に留めようとする。行先を言えば噓だと云う。構わずに出ようとすると、是非聞きたい事があるから、ちょいとでも好い、待って貰いたいと云う。着物を摑まえて放さなかったり、玄関に立ち塞がったり、女中の見る目も厭わずに、出て行くのを妨げようとする。末造は気に食わぬ事をも笑談のようにして荒立てずに済ます流義なのに、むしゃぶり附くのを振り放す、女房が倒れると云う不体裁を女中に見られた事もある。そんな時に末造がおとなしく留められて内にいて、さあ、用事を聞こうと云うと、「あなたわたしをどうしてくれる気なの」とか、「こうしていて、わたしの行末はどうなるでしょう」とか、なかなか一朝一夕に解決の出来ぬ難問題を提出する。要するに末造が女房の病気に試みた早出遅帰の対症療法は全く功を奏せなかったのである。,"Suezou came to leave the house earlier than usual and return to the inside later than usual. But the result was very bad. When I left early, my wife was surprised and silent at first. When I got home late, I couldn't stand it anymore, and I couldn't stand it anymore. I came close to him. And I started crying explosively. From the next time onward, if I try to get out early, I will try to force myself to say, ""Where are you going from now?"" Speaking of the destination, it is said to be a lie. If you try to go out regardless, there is something you definitely want to ask, so I like it a little and want you to wait. She grabs her kimono and doesn't let go, she stands in the front door, and she doesn't mind the eyes of the maid, trying to prevent her from leaving. Even though Suezou doesn't have to worry about things that he doesn't like like a laugh, the maid has seen the ill-manneredness of letting go of the sucking and the wife falling down. At that time, Suzo was quietly kept inside, and when I asked him what he was doing, he said, ""What are you going to do with me?"" Or ""What will happen to my end of the line?"" Submit an unsolvable difficult problem to. In short, the symptomatic treatment for early and late return that Suezou tried to treat his wife's illness did not work at all.","He began to leave earlier and return later than usual, But the results were worse. The first time he went away earlier, his wife merely looked up in surprise, but when he came back late, instead of giving him a moody glance, she marched upon him with “What you been doing out this long!” Her behavior suggested that she was no longer able to put up with the situation, that she had reached the limits of patience and suffering. And then she burst out crying. From that time on, whenever he wanted to leave before the usual hour, she tried to stop him with force, saying: “Why so early?” And when he began to explain, she said: “You're lying!” But when he started outdoors in spite of her protests, she pleaded: “Wait! Don't go yet! There's something I must ask you!” She would keep him there by holding on to his clothes or by standing in front of the door and refusing to let him pass. She did this even in the presence of the maid. Usually Suezo would pass over anything unpleasant by joking about it in order not to make a great issue of a point, but sometimes the maid saw an ugly scene in which he shook off his clinging wife and she fell. But if Suezo said: “All right, I won't go. Tell me what you have to say,” his wife would submit a series of difficult problems by no means solvable in a day. “What,” she would say, “do you want me to become?” Sometimes she said: “The way things are, what will my future be?” In short, Suezo's experiment of an early departure and a late return was totally ineffective in curing his wife of her illness.","Accordingly, Suezō began leaving the house earlier than usual and returning later at night. This proved to have a very poor effect. At first his wife only observed his early departures in startled silence. But when he returned late at night she was no longer able to maintain her pouting, negative attitude but flew at him, her patience exhausted. “Where have you been until now?” she demanded, bursting into torrents of tears. The next time he tried to leave early in the morning, she insisted he tell her where he was going. When he told her, she replied, “You’re lying!” She pleaded with him to wait, saying she had something important to ask, clung to his sleeve, blocked his way in the entrance hall and, heedless of the eyes of the maid, did everything she could to detain him. Unpleasantness of this sort Suezō customarily treated in a jocular manner so as not to make matters worse, but there were times now when in full view of the maid he roughly shook himself free from his wife’s frantic grapplings and she fell to the floor. If at such times Suezō agreed to put off his departure and inquired what it was she wanted to ask, she would demand to know, “What do you intend to do about me? What is to become of me if you keep on this way?”—difficult questions that could hardly be settled in a morning. In effect, Suezō’s scheme of remedying his wife’s sickness by leaving the house early and returning late proved to be totally ineffective."

末造は爺いさんに、「ずっとあっちへお通りなすって下さい」と丁寧に云って、座鋪の方を指さしながら、目をお玉さんの方へ移して、「さあ」と促した。そして二人を座鋪へ入れて置いて、世話をする婆あさんを片蔭へ呼んで、紙に包んだ物を手に握らせて、何やら咡いた。婆あさんはお歯黒を剝がした痕のきたない歯を見せて、恭しいような、人を馬鹿にしたような笑いようをして、頭を二三遍屈めて、そのまま跡へ引き返して行った。,"Suezou politely said to the old man, ""Please pass over there all the time,"" and while pointing toward the ladle, he moved his eyes toward the ladle and urged him to ""Come on."" Then he put them in a sitting room and called the caring grandmother to a sword, holding a piece of paper wrapped in his hand, and screaming. The old lady showed her messy teeth with black teeth, made a reverent, ridiculous laugh, bent her head a couple of times, and turned back to the trace. ..","“Please,” said Suezo politely to the old man, “come in.” He spoke first to the old man and pointed to the interior of the room. “Please,” he repeated, turning to Otama. After the father and daughter had entered the room, Suezo called the go-between to a sheltered part of the corridor, put some money wrapped in paper into her hand, and whispered into her ear. The woman smiled, her teeth stained with traces of black dye, and bowing her head several times in appreciation and laughing contemptuously, she hurried away along the corridor.","“Won’t you come right along in?” said Suezō politely to the old man, motioning toward the room and turning to Otama with an added “Please!” of encouragement. When the two had entered the room, he drew the old woman who had acted as go-between aside, slipped a paper packet into her hand, and whispered something. She bared her discolored teeth in a laugh that was half unctuous, half tinged with contempt and, bobbing her head in acknowledgment, retreated down the corridor."
小僧は手をひろげて鳥籠を押さえていながら、「も少しで蛇が首を入れた穴から、生きている分の鳥が逃げる所でした」と云った。,"The little boy opened his hand and held the bird cage, saying, ""It was a place where the living birds escaped from the hole where the snake put his neck.""","“The other bird nearly flew out the hole the snake made!” said the lad, putting his open hands on the cage.",The apprentice held his palm pressed against the side of the cage. “The other bird almost got out the hole where the snake’s head was!” he explained.
お常は最初芸者かと思った。若し芸者なら、数寄屋町にこの女程どこもかしこも揃って美しいのは、外にあるまいと、せわしい暇に判断した。しかし次の瞬間には、この女が芸者の持っている何物かを持っていないのに気が附いた。その何物かはお常には名状することは出来ない。それを説明しようとすれば、態度の誇張とでも云おうか。芸者は着物を好い恰好に着る。その好い恰好は必ず幾分か誇張せられる。誇張せられるから、おとなしいと云う所が失われる。お常の目に何物かが無いと感ぜられたのは、この誇張である。,"I always thought he was a geisha at first. If you're a geisha, I decided in a busy time that it wasn't outside that this woman was so beautiful in Sukiya-cho. But the next moment I realized that this woman didn't have anything the geisha had. Some of them cannot always be named. If you try to explain it, it's an exaggeration of your attitude. Geisha wear kimonos in a good fashion. That good looks are always somewhat exaggerated. Because it is exaggerated, the place of tranquility is lost. It is this exaggeration that made me feel that something was missing in my usual eyes.","At first Otsune thought she was a geisha. “If she is,” she said to herself as a first impression, “then no single geisha in Sukiya-machi can match her in beauty!” But a moment later Otsune noticed that this woman lacked something that every geisha has—something that she was unable to define herself. If it could be described, I might explain it as exaggerated behavior. A geisha may dress herself in excellent taste, but it is more or less excessive. And this added quality deprives her of a certain degree of moderation, of gentility. Otsune felt that the other woman lacked this element of exaggerated behavior.","Otsune thought at first that she was a geisha. If so, on the basis of her momentary glimpse she supposed there must be few even in Sukiyamachi as striking as this one. But in the next instant she realized that the woman lacked something that a geisha would surely possess. It was a certain extravagance of attitude. A geisha will wear her clothes beautifully, but there is an overstatement in the beauty that rules out modesty. What this woman lacked was precisely that touch of overstatement."
両方の引越騒ぎが片附いたのは、七月の中頃でもあったか。ういういしい詞遣や立居振舞が、ひどく気に入ったと見えて、金貸業の方で、あらゆる峻烈な性分を働かせている末造が、お玉に対しては、柔和な手段の限を尽して、毎晩のように無縁坂へ通って来て、お玉の機嫌を取っていた。ここにはちょっと歴史家の好く云う、英雄の半面と云ったような趣がある。,"Was it even in the middle of July that both moving turmoil was cleared up? Suezou, who seems to like the good lyrics and standing behavior so much that he is working with all the sharp qualities in the money lending business, does his best to deal with ladles. I went to Muenzaka almost every night and was in a good mood for the ladle. Here, there is a taste that is a little like a historian's half-side of a hero.","By the middle of July, Otama and her father had settled in their new homes. Suezo was so bewitched by the modesty of the girl's manner and her maidenly way of speaking that he visited her almost every night. He had been capable of complete ruthlessness in this dealings, and still was, but now he tried every trick of tenderness to gain Otama's affection. This, I believe, is what historians have often called the touch of weakness in a man of iron will.","It was the middle of July by the time Otama and her father got moved and settled. Suezō, who pursued his financial affairs with the utmost severity, adopted towards Otama, whose artless speech and behavior had so captured his fancy, the most mild and conciliatory methods, calling each night at Muenzaka to win her affection. As the historians would say, heroes have their gentler side."
「あれまで石が届くか」と、石原が岡田の顔を見て云った。,"Ishihara looked at Okada's face and said, ""Will the stone reach that point?""","“Can you throw that far with a stone?” Ishihara asked, turning to Okada.","“Do you think you could throw a stone that far?” asked Ishihara, looking at Okada."
末造には分からなかった。「本当のだの、噓のだのと云って、色々ありますかい」,"I didn't know about the end. ""Is there a lot of things that are true or lie?""","The actor-imitator began to perform at once. “We're lucky,” said the maid, entering the room with another container of saké. “A real mimic's come tonight!” “What's that?” asked Suezo. “Are there false mimics along with the true ones?”",Her remark puzzled Suezō. “You mean there are real impersonators and fake impersonators?” “Yes.
僕と岡田とは、その晩石原の所に夜の更けるまでいた。雁を肴に酒を飲む石原の相伴をしたと云っても好い。岡田が洋行の事を噫気にも出さぬので、僕は色々話したい事のあるのをこらえて、石原と岡田との間に交換せられる競漕の経歴談などに耳を傾けていた。,"Okada and I stayed at Ishihara that night until late at night. It is also good to say that he was accompanied by Ishihara, who drinks sake with goose as a side dish. Okada doesn't care about Hiroyuki, so I didn't want to talk about anything and listened to the history of rowing exchanged between Ishihara and Okada.","We stayed at Ishihara's until late that night. It might be said that we were forced to keep Ishihara company while he drank a great deal of saké and ate the flesh of the goose. And since Okada said nothing about his trip abroad, I had to hold back my desire to discuss it at length. Instead, I was forced to listen to their personal experiences in the regatta.","Okada and I stayed at Ishihara’s place until late that night, mainly keeping Ishihara company while he ate wild goose and drank saké. Okada did not breathe a word about his forthcoming trip abroad, so I had no chance to ask him all the questions I had hoped to. Instead I sat listening while he and Ishihara exchanged stories about their experiences on the rowing team."
「そう。きっとそうなの。まあ、好い気な物ね。ではいつまでも今のようにしている積なのね」,"""Yes. I'm sure it is. Well, it's a nice thing. Then it's the product that I'm doing forever.""",“Are you sure? Do you really believe that? What an egotist you are! Do you mean then to have everything just as it is?”,"“They will, though. I’m sure. But you never think of anyone but yourself] Do you mean to let things go on like this?”"
「僕もそう思う。只資格を拵えると云うだけだ。俗に随って聊復爾りだ」,"""I think so too. I'm just saying that I'm qualified.",“That's what I've been thinking. Going abroad will give me better qualifications—it's my one concession to the way of the world.”,“That’s how I look at it too. Just so I get the qualifications I need.
末造は又どこを当ともなしに、淡路町から神保町へ、何か急な用事でもありそうな様子をして歩いて行く。今川小路の少し手前に御茶漬と云う看板を出した家がその頃あった。二十銭ばかりでお膳を据えて、香の物に茶まで出す。末造はこの家を知っているので、午を食べに寄ろうかと思ったが、それにはまだ少し早かった。そこを通り過ぎると、右へ廻って俎橋の手前の広い町に出る。この町は今のように駿河台の下まで広々と附いていたのではない。殆ど袋町のように、今末造の来た方角へ曲がる処で終って、それから医学生が虫様突起と名づけた狭い横町が、あの山岡鉄舟の字を柱に掘り附けた社の前を通っていた。これは袋町めいた、俎橋の手前の広い町を盲腸に譬えたものである。,"Suezou walks from Awajicho to Jimbocho, looking like something sudden, without any reason. At that time, there was a house with a sign called Ochazuke just before Imagawakoji. Set up a set for only 20 sen and serve tea as a pickle. Suezo knew this house, so he thought he would stop by for lunch, but it was a little early. After passing there, turn right and you will reach a large town in front of Manaitabashi. This town wasn't as spacious as it is now under the Surugadai. Almost like Fukurocho, it ended at a turn in the direction of the end of the year, and then a narrow Yokomachi, which a medical student named a bug-like protrusion, passed in front of a company that dug the character of Yamaoka Tesshu into a pillar. .. This is a cecum-like image of a large town in front of Manaitabashi, which is located in Fukuromachi.","Though he didn't know where to go, he seemed, as he passed along, like a person on an important business trip. A short distance before the turn at Imagawa Lane, he saw a house advertising “Rice-in-Tea.” Inside, he could buy a tray of a few dishes with pickles and tea for only twenty sen. “I've a mind to go in,” he thought, but since it was too early for lunch, he went on turned right, and came into the broad street leading to Manaita-bashi.","Still with no destination in mind, Suezō walked through Awajichō toward Jimbōchō, striding along as though he were on important business. A little this side of Imagawa Kōji, there was at that time a shop with a sign reading “Tea and Rice.” For a mere twenty sen one could get a serving of rice with pickles and tea. Suezō knew the place and thought of stopping for lunch, but decided it was too early. Passing on, he turned right and came out in the wide street in front of Manaita Bridge. This street did not run at its full width all the way to the foot of Surugadai, as it does now. It was in fact almost a dead end, coming to a virtual stop where it turned in the direction from which Suezō had come. From there only a narrow alley ran past the shrine with calligraphy by Yamaoka Tesshu carved on its pillars. This little alley jutting off from the wide street in front of Manaita Bridge the medical students had facetiously dubbed “the vermiform appendix.”"
末造の家の空気は次第に沈んだ、重くろしい方へ傾いて来た。お常は折々只ぼうっとして空を見ていて、何事も手に附かぬことがある。そんな時には子供の世話も何も出来なくなって、子供が何か欲しいと云えば、すぐにあらあらしく叱る。叱って置いて気が附いて、子供にあやまったり、独りで泣いたりする。女中が飯の菜を何にしようかと問うても、返事をしなかったり、「お前の好いようにおし」と云ったりする。末造の子供は学校では、高利貸の子だと云って、友達に擯斥せられても、末造が綺麗好で、女房に世話をさせるので、目立って清潔になっていたのが、今は五味だらけの頭をして、綻びたままの着物を着て往来で遊んでいることがあるようになった。下女はお上さんがあんなでは困ると、口小言を言いながら、下手の乗っている馬がなまけて道草を食うように、物事を投遣にして、鼠入らずの中で肴が腐ったり、野菜が干物になったりする。,"The air in the last house gradually sank and leaned toward the heavier and heavier. I usually look at the sky in a daze, and sometimes I can't get anything. At that time, I couldn't take care of my child, and when I asked for something, I immediately scolded him. I scolded him and noticed that he was afraid of his child and cried alone. When the maid asks what she wants to eat, she doesn't reply or says, ""Do what you like."" At school, the child of Suezou is said to be a usury child, and even if he is dismissed by a friend, Suezou is beautiful and he takes care of his wife, so it was noticeably clean now. He has a head full of Gomi, and he sometimes wears a kimono that is still broken and plays with him. The maiden said that she wouldn't be in trouble with her boss, but she made things like throwing things like a horse on which she wasn't good enough to eat the grass. Vegetables become dried fish.","THE ATMOSPHERE in Suezo's house was gradually becoming more and more gloomy. Otsune was often seen gazing absent-mindedly into space and neglecting her work. At such times she paid no attention to the children and scolded them if they bothered her. But then she suddenly realized what she had done and said to them: “I'm sorry. What was it you wanted?” And later she would cry alone. When the maid said: “What shall I prepare today?” Otsune often failed to answer. Or she might say: “Oh? Anything, anything you wish.” Suezo's children were shunned by their classmates, who sometimes shouted at them: “Moneylenders! Money-lenders!” At Suezo's insistence Otsune had kept them unusually neat. But now they were seen playing in the streets with their hair full of dust and their clothing torn. The maid went about grumbling at the carelessness of her mistress, and, like a horse that dawdles along the road with an unskilled rider on its back, also became negligent of her own duties so that the fish rotted in the cupboards and the vegetables dried up.","The atmosphere at Suezōs house settled into a ponderous gloom. Sometimes Otsune did nothing but stare blankly into the air, neglecting the children completely. When they came to ask her for something, she would instantly start scolding them vehemently. After she had scolded them she would suddenly realize what she had done and apologize or sit weeping alone. If the maid inquired what to prepare for supper, Otsune would make no reply, or say, “Fix anything you like.” Although Suezō’s children were ostracized by their classmates at school because of their father’s profession, Suezō, fastidious as he was, had always had his wife dress and keep them spotlessly clean. But now they went about their play with dirty heads and kimonos that were coming apart at the seams. The maid grumbled about Otsune’s behavior, but, as a horse will stop to eat grass by the wayside when it knows it has an unskilled rider, she herself grew slipshod in her ways, until the fish rotted in the pantry and the vegetables shriveled and dried up."

こんな出来事があったので、お玉は心細くてならぬ所から、「隣を買う」と云うことをも覚えて、変った菜でも拵えた時は、一人暮らしでいる右隣の裁縫のお師匠さんの所へ、梅に持たせて遣るようになった。,"Because of such an event, I remembered that the ladle was ""buy next door"" from the place where I had to be lonely, and when I was able to pick up a strange vegetable, the sewing master on the right next to me who lives alone. I started to send it to the place with plums.","The incident made Otama feel helpless, and she learned to “buy” her neighbors. She would prepare a special dish and send it over to the sewing teacher, who lived alone. Her name was Otei, and she was a matron over forty with a fair complexion.","Otama, greatly disturbed by this unsettling incident, decided she had better “buy” herself some neighbors in case she should need their help. She began by sending over a portion of any unusual dish she happened to prepare to the sewing teacher, who lived alone in the house on her right. Ume was dispatched to make the delivery."

僕はすぐに同意して、一しょに蓮玉庵へ引き返した。その頃下谷から本郷へ掛けて一番名高かった蕎麦屋である。,"I immediately agreed and went back to Rengyokuan together. At that time, it was the most famous soba restaurant from Shimotani to Hongo.","“All right,” I said at once, and we retraced our steps to the restaurant.","I immediately agreed to that, and we turned back in the direction of the Rengyokuan. At that time it was rated the best noodle restaurant in the entire Shitaya-Hongō area."
「なんだって円錐の立方積なんぞを計算し出したのだ」と、僕は石原に言ったが、それと同時に僕の目は坂の中程に立って、こっちを見ている女の姿を認めて、僕の心は一種異様な激動を感じた。僕は池の北の端から引き返す途すがら、交番の巡査の事を思うよりは、この女の事を思っていた。なぜだか知らぬが、僕にはこの女が岡田を待ち受けていそうに思われたのである。果して僕の想像は僕を欺かなかった。女は自分の家よりは二三軒先へ出迎えていた。,"""Why did you calculate the cubic product of the cone,"" I told Ishihara, but at the same time, my eyes stood in the middle of the slope and admitted the woman looking at me. Then, my heart felt a kind of strange turbulence. As I turned back from the northern end of the pond, I was thinking of this woman rather than the police officer. I don't know why, but it seemed to me that this woman was waiting for Okada. After all, my imagination did not deceive me. The woman was greeted a few houses ahead of her house.","“Why,” I asked Ishihara, “did you start calculating the volume of a cone?” But at the same time I recognized a woman in the middle of the slope looking toward us. My heart felt a strange shock. All the way from the northern end of the pond I had been thinking about her instead of the policeman at his box. I didn't know why, but I imagined she would be waiting for Okada. And I hadn't been wrong. She had come down the slope about two or three houses from her own.","“Why did you all of a sudden start talking about the volume of a cone?” I asked Ishihara, but at that instant I caught sight of the woman standing in the middle of the slope and looking this way. A feeling of strange agitation swept over me. All the time we had been making our way back from the north end of the pond I had been thinking more about the woman than about the police box. I don’t know why, but I felt certain she would be waiting for Okada. And my hunch did not prove wrong. She had come several houses down from her own as though in greeting."
「どうだい、工合は。檀那は折々お出になるかい」,"""How about the work? Do you come out from time to time?""","“How are you getting along?” he asked suddenly, feeling the awkwardness of the question. “Does Suezo come dropping in every so often?”","Then the old man suddenly asked in a rather embarrassed tone, “How are things? Does your master come to see you sometimes?”"
「どうも暮れてしまいますまでは夕日が入れますので」と、案内をした女中が説明をして置いて下がった。真偽の分からぬ肉筆の浮世絵の軸物を掛けて、一輪挿に山梔の花を活けた床の間を背にして座を占めた末造は、鋭い目であたりを見廻した。,"""The sunset will be set until it's dark,"" said the maid who guided her. Suezou, who occupies the seat with a tokonoma with gardenia flowers on his back, hangs an ukiyo-e shaft with an uncertain handwriting, and looks around with a keen eye.","He looked about with his usual care, examining everything. Outside he saw a wooden fence that shut off the view of the pond.","“I’m afraid until it gets a little later the evening sun will be coming in like this,” the maid, who had shown Suezō in, apologized before withdrawing. Suezō sat down, his back to the alcove with its ukiyoe scroll painting and little vase of jasmine, and scrutinized the room carefully."
さていよいよ目見えをさせようとなった時、避くべからざる問題が出来た。それはお玉さんの支度である。お玉さんのばかりなら好いが、爺いさんの支度までして遣らなくてはならないことになった。これには中に立って口を利いた婆あさんも頗る窮したが、爺いさんの云うことは娘が一も二もなく同意するので、それを強いて抑えようとすると、根本的に談判が破裂しないにも限らぬと云う状況になったから為方がない。爺いさんの申分はざっとこうであった。「お玉はわたしの大事な一人娘で、それも余所の一人娘とは違って、わたしの身よりと云うものは、あれより外には一人もない。わたしは亡くなった女房一人をたよりにして、寂しい生涯を送ったものだが、その女房が三十を越しての初産でお玉を生んで置いて、とうとうそれが病附で亡くなった。貰乳をして育てていると、やっと四月ばかりになった時、江戸中に流行った麻疹になって、お医者が見切ってしまったのを、わたしは商売も何も投遣にして介抱して、やっと命を取り留めた。世間は物騒な最中で、井伊様がお殺されなすってから二年目、生麦で西洋人が斬られたと云う年であった。それからと云うものは、店も何もなくしてしまったわたしが、何遍もいっその事死んでしまおうかと思ったのを、小さい手でわたしの胸をいじって、大きい目でわたしの顔を見て笑う、可哀いお玉を一しょに殺す気になられないばっかりに、出来ない我慢をして一日々々と命を繫いでいた。お玉が生れた時、わたしはもう四十五で、お負に苦労をし続けて年より更けていたのだが、一人口は食えなくても二人口は食えるなどと云って、小金を持った後家さんの所へ、入壻に世話をしよう、子供は里にでも遣ってしまえと、親切に云ってくれた人もあったが、わたしはお玉が可哀さに、そっけもなくことわった。それまでにして育てたお玉を、貧すれば鈍するとやら云うわけで、飛んだ不実な男の慰物にせられたのが、悔やしくて悔やしくてならないのだ。為合せな事には、好い娘だと人も云って下さるあの子だから、どうか堅気な人に遣りたいと思っても、わたしと云う親があるので、誰も貰おうと云ってくれぬ。それでも囲物や妾には、どんな事があっても出すまいと思っていたが、堅い檀那だと、お前さん方が仰ゃるから、お玉も来年は二十になるし、余り薹の立たないうちに、どうかして遣りたさに、とうとうわたしは折れ合ったのだ。そうした大事なお玉を上げるのだから、是非わたしが一しょに出て、檀那にお目に掛からなくてはならぬ」と云うのである。,"When it came time to make it visible, there was an unavoidable problem. That is the preparation of the ladle. I like it if it's just a ladle, but I have to prepare for my grandfather. The old lady who stood inside and spoken was also in a difficult situation, but the old man agreed with her daughter without a second, so if she tried to suppress it, the discourse fundamentally burst. There is no help for it because it is not always the case. The old man's request was roughly like this. ""The ladle is my only daughter, and unlike the other daughters, there is nothing outside of me. I make a deceased wife a news. He lived a lonely life, but his wife gave birth to a ladle for the first time over thirty and finally died of illness. At that time, the measles that was prevalent all over Edo, and the doctor gave up on it, I took care of it by investing nothing in business, and finally saved my life. In the middle of it, it was the second year since Ii-sama was killed, and it was the year when the Westerners were killed by raw wheat. I thought I was going to die, but I just messed with my chest with my small hands, looked at my face with my big eyes and laughed, and I didn't feel like killing the poor ladle together. I had to put up with the patience that I couldn't do, and I was dying every day. Some people kindly told me that even if I couldn't eat, the two populations could eat, and after having a small amount of money, I would go to the house, take care of the ladle, and send the children to the village. However, I said that the ladle was pitiful, and that the ladle that had been raised up to that point would be blunted if it was poor. I'm regrettable and I can't regret it. Fortunately, I'm the one who says that I'm a good girl, so even if I want to send it to a stubborn person, my parents Because there is, no one will ask me to get it. Still, I thought that I wouldn't give out anything to the enclosure and the nybō, but if it's a hard measles, you say, so the ladle It will be twenty next year, and before I was too busy, I finally broke down with the fact that I had sent it. I will raise such an important ladle, so please come out with me. I have to see Danna. ""","He had chosen the restaurant for that reason. When the day of days drew near, Suezo wondered how he would dress Otama for the occasion. He would have spent any sum on her for the purpose, but since he had to provide for her father as well, he hesitated. The old go-between was at her wit's end for a solution, yet they both agreed that they had to consider the old man because any possible oversight might end their chances of getting Otama as a mistress. The old man had told the go-between about his only child: “ No,” he had said, “I have no other relatives. And I've had a lonely time of it without my wife. She was over thirty when our first child was born. Our first and last. I kept Otama alive after her mother died in childbirth by taking her to different women in the neighborhood. They gave her their milk. And I had other troubles. When Otama was four, she had the measles during the Edo epidemic. The doctor said she'd die, but I didn't believe him. I took care of her. I saved her life. I let my business go, everything, watching over her. What a year! All sorts of terrible things happened two years after Lord Ii was killed. In that year some Westerners were beheaded at Namamugi. I couldn't even keep up my shop. More than once I was going to kill myself and Otama too. But how could I harm Otama? You should have seen her then. She had the smallest hands. How they poked at my chest! And she smiled at me with the widest eyes! We barely managed to live from one day to the next. I don't think many others could have gone through what we did. I wasn't a young man then. I was forty-five when she was born and, what with the cares I had, must have looked older. Still, I could have started over. One of my friends kept repeating the old proverb: ‘When a single man can't live, two can.' Then he said he knew a widow who was looking for a husband. And he'd recommend me. Oh, she had money too! But I would have had to give my child away to someone else. How could I? I refused the offer flat.” Suddenly the old man paused, but a moment later he continued: “You don't know how I want to curse! You can't know what it is to feel that you've been tricked! Being poor made me a dull old man! I was there when that policeman made a plaything out of Otama. Yet she's not a bad girl, and they still speak of her as a fine daughter. You know, I'd like to marry her to a good man in the right way. That's the truth. But who to? No one's willing to take me along with her. I often said to myself: ‘Don't give her away as a mistress! Don't!' But you say your master's a good man, an honest man, one we can trust? And a gentleman too? You see, I have to remember that Otama will be twenty next year. She has to marry soon. They say that the young shoot must be eaten before it withers. I'm trying to understand your offer. You see, I'm going to give away one so dear to me. You see, she's my only child. She's all I care about. I've got to meet this gentleman myself!”","But before the meeting could take place, there was one problem that had to be dealt with, that of the clothes that Otama was to wear. If it had been just Otama, there would have been no difficulty, but as it turned out, clothes had to be provided for her father as well. Even the glib old woman who was acting as go-between in the arrangements found herself stymied on that point, as she realized that Otama would invariably second her father’s stand on any matter, and that if pressure were brought to bear to keep the old man away, all the negotiations could end in failure. The old man’s position was this. “Otama,” he told the go-between, “is an only daughter and very precious to me. Moreover, my case is somewhat special because she is the only close kin I have. My wife and I went along with just the two of us, but when she was over thirty she had a child, Otama, and died soon after of complications. I had to find someone to nurse the child. And then, when Otama was only four months old, she came down with the measles that was raging all over Edo at the time. The doctor gave her up for lost, but I dropped my business and everything else and nursed her till I pulled her through at last. “The whole world was in an uproar then; it was two years after Lord Ii was assassinated, the year the Westerners were cut down at Namamugi. Later I lost my shop and everything I had. Any number of times I was on the point of killing myself, but I would look at Otama, her little hand fumbling at my chest, gazing up at my face with those big eyes and smiling, and I knew I could never bring myself to kill her too. So I went on somehow bearing what I thought I couldn’t bear, living from one day to the next. “I was already forty-five when Otama was born, and looked even older because of all the trials I’d been through. People bent on being helpful would remind me of the proverb that ‘Two can live on what won’t do for one’; they offered to introduce me to a widow with a little money who was looking for a husband, or urged me to turn Otama over to her mother’s people. But Otama was too dear to me—I refused to listen to such talk. “But as they say, poverty makes for a dull head. After all the care I’d taken in bringing her up, I went and handed her over to that two-faced liar of a policeman to be his plaything! It makes me sick with rage every time I think of it! But still she’s a good girl, as everyone admits, and I want to see her married to someone upright and proper. With a father like me, though, who’d be willing to have her? “Whatever happens,” he insisted, “I don’t want to see her become somebody’s mistress or kept woman. But you tell me that this gentleman of yours is perfectly trustworthy. Otama will be twenty next year and it doesn’t do to put such things off too long. So I guess I’d better listen to your proposal. But since she means so much to me, I want to be sure to go along when she meets the gentleman.”"

或る晩末造が無縁坂から帰って見ると、お上さんがもう子供を寝かして、自分だけ起きていた。いつも子供が寝ると、自分も一しょに横になっているのが、その晩は据わって俯向加減になっていて、末造が蚊屋の中に這入って来たのを知っていながら、振り向いても見ない。,"When Suezo returned from Muenzaka one night, the boss had already put his child to sleep and he was the only one awake. Whenever a child sleeps, he lays down with him, but that night he sits down and looks down, knowing that the mosquito net has crawled into the mosquito net, but he turns around. I don't see it.","ONE NIGHT after his return from Muenzaka, Suezo found his wife, Otsune, sitting up alone after the children at her side had fallen asleep. Her usual practice was to doze off with them. On this occasion she knew her husband had come in under the mosquito net. She didn't turn her head toward him but kept it bent down.","One night Suezō returned from Muenzaka to find that his wife, Otsune, had put the children to bed but was still up herself. Generally when she put the children to bed she lay down on her pallet beside them. Tonight, however, she sat staring at the floor and, though well aware when Suezō crawled in under the mosquito net, made no move to look up."
「それは同じのを買って遣ったのだから、同じのを持っているに極まっています」声が際立って鋭くなっている。,"""It's the same thing I bought and sent, so I'm very close to having the same thing."" The voice is sharpened.","Since you bought her the very same kind!” she said, her voice suddenly turning into a shriek.",“Because you bought them both. So of course we’ve both got the same kind!” Otsune’s voice took on a shriller tone.
お玉は気の勝った女で、末造に囲われることになってから、短い月日の間に、周囲から陽に貶められ、陰に羨まれる妾と云うものの苦しさを味って、そのお蔭で一種の世間を馬鹿にしたような気象を養成してはいるが、根が善人で、まだ人に揉まれていぬので、下宿屋に住まっている書生の岡田に近づくのをひどくおっくうに思っていたのである。,"Odama is a brilliant woman, and in a short period of time since she was surrounded by the swordsman, she experienced the pain of being a concubinage who was envious of the sun and envied by the surroundings. Thanks to that, we are training a kind of ridiculous weather, but since the roots are good people and have not been rubbed by people yet, it is terrible to approach Okada, a shosei who lives in a boarding house. I was thinking.","By nature Otama was a spirited woman, and in the few months since she had become Suezo's mistress, her painful experience of the outward contempt shown a mistress and the inward envy of the people around her enabled her to set the world at naught. Yet since she was basically a good woman and had not yet had too much experience in life, she felt it difficult to visit a university student at his lodging house.","Though little time had passed since she became Suezō’s mistress, she had experienced the bitterness that goes with that position, outwardly despised by those around her, secretly envied, and in turn had learned to cultivate a kind of contempt for the world that would treat her so. But she was good at heart and had not yet had time to become utterly hardened by life, and the idea of trying to become intimate with Okada, a student living in a boardinghouse, seemed to present fearful difficulties. There was a spell of warm autumn weather that permitted her to open the window, so that each day she could at least exchange nods with Okada."
「こんな所に立って何を見ていたのだ」と、僕が問うた。,"""What were you looking at while standing in a place like this,"" I asked.",“What are you looking at around here?” I asked.,“What are you looking at?” I asked.
お常が四五歩通り過ぎた時、女中が咡いた。「奥さん。あれですよ。無縁坂の女は」,"When the usual passed forty-five steps, the maid screamed. ""My wife. That's it. The woman on the unrelated slope.""","When Otsune had passed Otama by some several steps, her maid whispered: “Okusan! That's the woman of Muenzaka!”","When Otsune had gone on a few steps, the maid whispered, “That’s her. The woman from Muenzaka!”"
「やあ。寐坊だなあ」こう云って箱火鉢の前に据わったのは末造である。,"""Hey. It's a ward."" It was the last construction that was set up in front of the brazier.","“Hey there! You lazy-riser!” said Suezo, sitting at the brazier.",“Sleepyhead!” exclaimed Suezō as he sat down by the brazier.
紺縮の単物に、黒襦子と茶献上との腹合せの帯を締めて、繊い左の手に手拭やら石鹼箱シャボンやら糠袋やら海綿やらを、細かに編んだ竹の籠に入れたのを懈げに持って、右の手を格子に掛けたまま振り返った女の姿が、岡田には別に深い印象をも与えなかった。しかし結い立ての銀杏返しの鬢が蟬の羽のように薄いのと、鼻の高い、細長い、稍寂しい顔が、どこの加減か額から頰に掛けて少し扁たいような感じをさせるのとが目に留まった。岡田は只それだけの刹那の知覚を閲歴したと云うに過ぎなかったので、無縁坂を降りてしまう頃には、もう女の事は綺麗に忘れていた。,"Tighten the sash of black 襦 子 and tea sashimi on a single item of navy blue, and put a hand towel, a stone sardine box, soap, a bran bag, and sponge in a finely woven bamboo basket in the left hand. The appearance of the woman who looked back with her right hand on the grid, holding the basket in her arms, did not give Okada a deep impression. However, the sword of the tie-up ginkgo is thin like a cicada's feather, and the tall, slender, lonely face makes it feel a little flat from the forehead. It caught my eye. Okada had only reviewed the perception of the moment, so by the time he got off the Muen-zaka, he had forgotten about the woman.","Okada was not very much attracted by the woman in kimono with her right hand on the door and her left hand holding her bamboo basket of toilet articles. But he did notice her hair freshly dressed in the ginkgo-leaf style with her sidelocks as thin as the wings of a cicada. He saw that her face was oval and somewhat lonely, her nose sharp, her forehead to her cheeks conveying an impression of flatness, though it was difficult to say exactly what made him think so. Since these were no more than momentary impressions, he had completely forgotten about her when he came to the bottom of the slope.","She was wearing a summer kimono of dark blue crepe tied with a sash of black satin and tea-colored facings, the slim fingers of her left hand holding a bamboo basket of toilet articles, her right hand resting on the door. The figure of the woman as she turned to look at him made no deep impression on Okada, but for a moment the details of her image lingered in his eyes—the hair freshly done up in gingko-leaf style, sidelocks thin as the wings of a cicada, the high-bridged nose, the rather melancholy face that seemed somehow from the forehead to the cheeks a little too flat. But it was no more than a momentary perception, and by the time he had descended to the foot of the slope he had completely forgotten her."
僕は下宿屋や学校の寄宿舎の「まかない」に饑を凌いでいるうちに、身の毛の弥立つ程厭な菜が出来た。どんな風通しの好い座敷で、どんな清潔な膳の上に載せて出されようとも、僕の目が一たびその菜を見ると、僕の鼻は名状すべからざる寄宿舎の食堂の臭気を嗅ぐ。煮肴に羊栖菜や相良麩が附けてあると、もうそろそろこの嗅覚のhallucinationアリュシナションが起り掛かる。そしてそれが青魚の未醬煮に至って窮極の程度に達する。,"While I was surpassing the meals in the boarding house and the dormitory of the school, I was able to make a messy vegetable. No matter what kind of airy tatami room you put on any clean table, once my eyes see the vegetables, my nose smells the odor of the dining room of the dormitory. When the boiled side dish is accompanied by hijiki seaweed and sagara fu, this hallucination alluscination of the sense of smell is about to occur. And it reaches the extreme degree of boiled blue-backed fish.","I was barely able to keep from starving because of the meagre dormitory and boarding house meals, yet there was one dish that made my flesh creep. No matter how much air there is in the room or how clean the serving tray is, the moment I see this food, I recall the indescribable odors of the dormitory dining room. When I am served boiled fish with cooked seaweed and wheat gluten cakes, I have that hallucination of smell. And if the boiled fish is mackerel made in bean paste, the sensation is at its peak.","In the days when I was surviving on the food served in boardinghouses and student dormitories, I encountered one dish that completely turned my stomach. To this day, no matter how pleasant and airy the dining room or how clean the table setting, if I once catch sight of this dish, I seem to smell once more that indescribably nauseating odor that I knew long ago in the dormitory dining room. Even other kinds of fish cooked with seaweed or gluten bread will remind me of that awful smell and I react as strongly as if the dish were actually mackerel in miso sauce."
しかし末造は飽くまで立派な実業家だと云う触込を実にしなくてはならぬと思っているので、先方へはおお様な処が見せたさに、とうとう二人の支度を引き受けた。それにはお玉を手に入れた上では、どうせ親父の身の上も棄てては置かれぬのだから、只後ですることが先になるに過ぎぬと云う諦めも手伝って、末造に決心させたのである。,"However, I think that Suezou must make the impression that he is a good businessman until he gets tired of it, so he finally took on the preparations for the two of them when he was shown to the other party. For that, once I got the ball, I couldn't throw it away from my father's body anyway, so I helped give up saying that it was only the first thing to do later, and decided to make it. It is.","But he knew he had to be consistent, that he had to show his wealth and generosity. At last he agreed to give both father and daughter the necessary clothing. When he had further time to reason out his actions, he comforted himself, saying: ‘Since I'll have to take care of the father eventually when I get the daughter, I'm only doing in advance what I'll have to do later.” In such situations the customary procedure was to send the other party a definite sum of money to cover expenses.","But he had chosen to have himself represented as an affluent businessman, and now he felt obliged to live up to the role. So to demonstrate his magnanimity, he agreed to provide appropriate apparel for both Otama and her father. It occurred to him that once Otama was in his hands, he could not very well ignore the needs of her father, so in a sense he was simply supplying goods beforehand that he would have to supply sooner or later anyway. This thought helped him to reach his decision."
爺いさんが傍から云った。「学生さんにも、御器用な方があるものですね」,"The old man said from the side. ""Students also have some dexterity.""","said the maid, laughing. “Do you know him personally?” Suezo asked.",“Oh yes—he comes here to eat now and then.” “Just think—there are students who can do clever things like that!” Otama’s father exclaimed.
「妙な対照のようだが、桜痴居士も余り廉潔じゃないと云うじゃないか」と、岡田が云った。,"""It sounds like a strange contrast, but I think the cherry blossom householders aren't too innocent,"" Okada said.","About ten steps later, I looked at the two-storied houses on the side of the street and said as though talking to myself: “Those houses belong to Fukuchi and Suezo.”","“They make an odd combination, don’t they,” Okada remarked. “Though I hear Fukuchi’s reputation isn’t all that savory either.”"
末造も再び譲歩しようとはしない。こっちから媾和を持ち出したに、彼が応ぜぬなら、それまでの事だと思って、わざと平気で烟草を呑んでいる。,"Suezou will not make concessions again. If he brought out the peace from here, but he didn't respond, he thought it was up to that point, and deliberately swallowed the cigarette.","Since she refused to accept this proposal of peace from him, he wouldn't make any further concessions. And deliberately ignoring her, he leaned back smoking.","Suezō decided to give in no further. He had made the peace overture, and if she did not respond, he would leave it at that. He smoked his cigarette with a deliberate air of unconcern."
お玉は火箸で灰をいじりながら、偸むように末造の顔を見ている。「でもいろいろと思って見ますものですから」,"The ladle is messing around with the ashes with fire chopsticks, looking at the face of the sword as if it were roaring.

「なる程。Parallaxeパララックセのような理窟だな。しかし深くはないだろうか」と岡田が云った。,"""I see. It's a parallax-like cave, but isn't it deep?"" Okada said.","“We understand,” said Okada.","so I get back in line.” “Right,” said Okada."
酒屋の角を池の方へ曲がる時、女中が機嫌を取るように云った。,"As I turned the corner of the liquor store toward the pond, the maid told me to be in a good mood.","Otsune and her maid turned toward the pond at the corner of a saké dealer's shop, and the maid said propitiatingly: “You see, Okusan, she's not a very pretty woman.","As they turned the corner by the saké shop and started toward the pond, the maid tried to cheer her mistress up."

この時石原の僕に答えた詞は、その響が耳に入っただけで、その意は心に通ぜなかった。多分岡田の外套が下ぶくれになっていて、円錐形に見える処から思い附いて、円錐の立方積と云うことを言い出したのだと、弁明したのであろう。,"At that time, the lyrics I answered to me at Ishihara just heard the sound, and I couldn't understand it. Perhaps Okada's cloak was bulging, and he came up with the idea of what looks like a cone, and he said that it was a cubic product of cones.",Ishihara's answer to my question was mere sound in my ears. He had probably said that he thought of the formula because of the shape of Okada's cloak.,"I could hear Ishihara making some reply to my question, but the meaning of his words did not penetrate my mind. Most likely he was explaining that the odd bulge in Qkada’s cloak had started him talking about the volume of a cone."
「馬鹿言え。己がお前と云うものがあるのに、外の女に手を出すような人間かい。これまでだって、女をどうしたと云うことが、只の一度でもあったかい。もうお互に焼餅喧嘩をする年でもあるめえ。好い加減にしろ」末造は存外容易に弁解が功を奏したと思って、心中に凱歌を歌っている。,"""Silly. I'm a person who has something to say about you, but you're the kind of person who dabbles with a woman outside. Have you ever said what happened to a woman? It's also a year of quarreling with shaobing. Do whatever you like. ”Suezo sings a triumphant song in his heart, thinking that the excuse was successful.","“Don't talk as though you were stupid! Am I the kind of man who would make love to another woman when I have you for my wife? Can you point to a single time when I had anything to do with anyone else? We're too old to be jealous of each other. Isn't that so? Listen here! You'd better not go too far with this!” Suezo sang a song of triumph in his heart, for his explanation had been more effective than he had hoped.","I have you. Why would I play around with anyone else? Have I ever done anything like that in the past? We’re too old for jealous quarrels. Let’s not do this anymore.” Confident of the easy success of his explanation, Suezō was already savoring his triumph."

お常は只胸の中が湧き返るようで、何事をもはっきり考えることが出来ない。夫に対してどうしよう、なんと云おうと云う思案も無い。その癖早く夫に打っ附かって、なんとか云わなくてはいられぬような気がする。そしてこんな事を思う。あの蝙蝠傘を買って来て貰った時、わたしはどんなにか喜んだだろう。これまでこっちから頼まぬのに、物なんぞ買って来てくれたことはない。どうして今度に限って、みやげを買って来てくれたのだろうと、不思議には思ったが、その不思議と云うのも、どうして夫が急に親切になったかと思ったのであった。今考えれば、おお方あの女が頼んで買って貰った時、ついでにわたしのを買ったのだろう。きっとそうに違いない。そうとは知らずに、わたしは難有く思ったのだ。わたしには差されもしない、あんな傘を貰って、難有く思ったのだ。傘ばかりでは無い。あの女の着物や髪の物も、内で買って遣ったのかも知れない。丁度わたしの差している、毛繻子張のこの傘と、あの舶来の蝙蝠とが違うように、わたしとあの女とは、身に着けている程の物が皆違っている。それにわたしばかりではない。子供に着物を着せたいと思っても、なかなか拵えてくれはしない。男の子には筒っぽが一枚あれば好いものだと云う。女の子だと、小さいうちに着物を拵えるのは損だと云う。何万と云う金を持った人の女房や子供に、わたし達親子のようななりをしているものがあるだろうか。今から思って見れば、あの女がいたお蔭で、わたし達に構ってくれなかったかも知れない。吉田さんの持物だったなんと云うのも、本当だかどうだか当にはならない。七曲りとかにいた時分から、内で囲って置いたかも知れない。いや。きっとそうに違ない。金廻りが好くなって、自分の着物や持物に贅沢をするようになったのを、附合があるからだのなんのと云ったが、あの女がいたからだろう。わたしをどこへでも連れて行かずに、あの女を連れて行ったに違ない。ええ、悔やしい。こんな事を思っていると、突然女中が叫んだ。,"Usually, the inside of my chest seems to spring up, and I can't think of anything clearly. I have no idea what to do with my husband. I feel like I have to say something about that habit of hitting my husband early. And I think about this. How pleased I was when I got that 蝙蝠 umbrella. I've never bought anything, even though I didn't ask for it. I wondered why he bought me a souvenir only this time, but the wonder was why my husband suddenly became kind. If you think about it now, when that woman asked you to buy it, you probably bought mine. It must be so. Not knowing that, I thought it was difficult. I was grateful to receive such an umbrella that I wouldn't even be able to put it in. Not just umbrellas. I may have bought that woman's kimono and hair as well. Just as this umbrella, which I'm holding, is different from that imported bat, I and that woman are all different in what they wear. And I'm not the only one. Even if you want to put on a kimono for your child, it's hard to get rid of it. It is said that boys would like to have one tube. For girls, it is a loss to wear a kimono while they are small. Are there any wives or children of people with tens of thousands of dollars who are like us parents and children? From now on, it may be that she didn't care for us because of her presence. It doesn't make sense to say that it belonged to Mr. Yoshida, whether it was true or not. From the time I was in the seven bends, I might have placed it inside. no. I'm sure it is. It was said that the reason why he became more fond of money and became extravagant in his kimono and belongings was because he had an attachment, but probably because he was there. I must have taken that woman without taking me anywhere. Yeah, regrettable. Suddenly the maid shouted when she was thinking about this.","Otsune was inwardly raging. She was unable to think clearly. As she walked toward her house, she didn't know how to approach her husband or what to say to him, yet she felt compelled to attack him somehow, to speak, to say something. How delighted she had been when he had bought her that parasol, when he had actually given it to her! “I always had to ask for something from him,” she thought. And when he had said: “For you. Take it,” she couldn't help asking herself: “What's this for? Why's he turned kind so suddenly?” Now she knew that he had given it to her as an afterthought. That woman had asked him for one—she was certain of that now. And knowing nothing, she had thanked him, thanked him for a parasol she couldn't even use! “And not only that,” she said to herself, “but he gave her that kimono and those ornaments in her hair. He gave them to her!” Otsune glanced at her own sateen parasol. How different it was from that other one of foreign make! “Everything I'm wearing is different from hers!” Nor did Otsune merely worry about herself. “A tight-sleeved kimono will do for the boy,” Suezo had said. “As for the girl, don't waste money by dressing her up now. She's too young.” Were ever the wife and children of a man worth thousands and thousands of yen so poorly dressed as she and her children? And she thought that if Suezo had neglected them, that woman was to blame. Of course everything he had told her about Yoshida was a lie. And when Suezo had said: “She used to live at Nanamagari,” he had been keeping her even then. Yes, that was the truth. He had made excuses for his own clothing and personal items, saying: “I have my position to think of,” and Otsune thought how she might have said: “Yes, you have your woman to think of!” He had taken that woman all over, but he had taken his own wife nowhere. “How unfair! And cruel!” she whispered. Otsune was lost in these thoughts when she suddenly heard her maid cry out: “Why!","Everything was turmoil in Otsune’s mind; she could think of nothing clearly. Without having any idea what she would say to her husband, she felt she must confront him at once, must say something. When he bought me that parasol, how happy I was, she thought. He had never bought me anything before unless I asked him. I wondered why he would do such a strange thing, why he was suddenly so kind. Now I know. She asked him to buy her one, and so he got one for me too. Exactly! And I thanked him so, when I can’t even use it! Not only the parasol, but her kimono and hair ornaments— I’ll bet he bought all of them. Everything she’s wearing is as different from what I’m wearing as this sateen sunshade I’m carrying is from that imported parasol. And then when I ask for some new clothes for the children he won’t even give me the money. Says the boy can make do with one suit of clothes, or that it’s just a waste of money to make kimonos for a little girl. Did anyone ever hear of the wife and children of a man as rich as he is going around dressed the way we are? And it’s all because of that woman that he treats us like this! He says she’s Yoshida’s woman, but who’s going to believe that? He’s most likely been keeping her from the time she was in the Nanamagari store. That’s it! After he made a little money and started getting extravagant with his clothes, he said it was all for business appearances, but it was because of her. He wouldn’t take me anywhere, but you can be sure he was taking her places. To think of it!—"
僕は岡田に言った。「そんなら二人で池を一周して来ようか」,"I told Okada. ""Let's go around the pond together.""","“Then let's go once around the pond,” I suggested to Okada.","“In that case you and I better take a turn around the lake,” I said to Okada."
朝晩はもう涼しくても、昼中はまだ暑い日がある。お玉の家では、越して来た時掛け替えた青簾の、色の褪める隙のないのが、肱掛窓の竹格子の内側を、上から下まで透間なく深く鎖している。無聊に苦んでいるお玉は、その窓の内で、暁斎や是真の画のある団扇を幾つも挿した団扇挿しの下の柱にもたれて、ぼんやり往来を眺めている。三時が過ぎると、学生が三四人ずつの群をなして通る。その度毎に、隣の裁縫の師匠の家で、小雀の囀るような娘達の声が一際喧しくなる。それに促されてお玉もどんな人が通るかと、覚えず気を附けて見ることがある。,"Even if it's already cool in the morning and evening, there are still hot days in the daytime. At Otama no Ie, the bamboo blinds that were replaced when they came over had no chance of fading in color, and the inside of the bamboo lattice of the 肱 hang window was chained deeply from top to bottom. In the window, the ladle, who is suffering from loneliness, leans against the pillar under the uchiwa uchiwa, which has many uchiwa fans with pictures of Kyosai and Kyōshin, and looks at the traffic vaguely. After three o'clock, students pass by in groups of 34. Every time, at the house of the sewing master next door, the voices of the singing daughters of the willow tit become louder. I sometimes watch the ladle carefully without remembering what kind of person will pass by it.","The mornings were as cool as the nights, but the days were still hot. In Otama's house the bamboo blinds were still drawn, their unfaded green covering the window from top to bottom. Otama sat inside with nothing to do. She leaned against a post hung with fans and vacantly looked into the street. After three o'clock the students would pass in small groups. And she knew that whenever they came, the voices of the girls next door would rise like the sounds of so many young sparrows. And attracted by the noise, she would also glance out.","Although the mornings and evenings were cool, the midday sun still shone hot. At Otama’s house the bamboo blinds, newly installed when she moved in, had not had time to fade from their initial green, having hung just inside the lattice of the bay window, shielding it from top to bottom. Otama, perishing of boredom, sat in the window, leaning against the pillar with its holder of round painted fans, and stared absently through the blinds at the passersby. From about three in the afternoon, groups of three or four students would stroll by. On each such occasion, the sparrowlike chatter of the girls in the sewing teacher’s house next door would rise to a new pitch of shrillness. Wondering what had inspired the latest outburst, Otama would fix her attention more closely on the figures in the street."
石原は笑った。「そう物の哀を知り過ぎては困るなあ。君が投げんと云うなら、僕が投げる」,"Ishihara laughed. ""I don't want to know too much about mono no aware. If you say throw, I'll throw.""","Ishihara laughed. “Don't be sentimental! If you don't, then I will.”","Ishihara laughed. “Let’s not get too tenderhearted now. If you don’t want to throw a stone, then I will.”"
食事が済んだので、お梅は膳を下げた。片附けなくても好いとは云われても、洗う物だけは洗って置かなくてはと思って、小桶に湯を取って茶碗や皿をちゃらちゃら言わせていると、そこへお玉は紙に包んだ物を持って出て来た。「あら、矢っ張り片附けているのね。それんばかりの物を洗うのはわけは無いから、わたしがするよ。お前髪はゆうべ結ったのだからそれで好いわね。早く着物をお着替よ。そしてなんにもお土産が無いから、これを持ってお出」こう云って紙包をわたした。中には例の骨牌のような恰好をした半円の青い札がはいっていたのである。,"Having finished the meal, Ume lowered the table. Even if it is said that it is good even if it is not tidied up, I thought that I had to wash and put only the things to be washed, so I took hot water in a tub and made me mess with teacups and plates. The ladle came out with something wrapped in paper. ""Oh, it's got a piece of paper. I can't wash that much, so I'll do it. I like it because your bangs are tied up last night. Put on your kimono early. I'll replace it. And I don't have any souvenirs, so take this with me. "" Inside was a semi-circular blue tag that looked like a karuta card.","When Otama had finished the meal, Ume took the tray away. The girl felt she should wash the dishes even though she had been told to leave them, and when Otama came in with something folded in a piece of paper, Ume was rinsing the bowls and plates in a small wooden bucket filled with hot water. “Oh, you're washing them even though I said not to? I'll do it for you. It's not much work for me to wash a few things. You did your hair last night, so it looks all right, don't you think? Hurry and dress. I've nothing to give you as a present for your parents, so take this.” Otama handed Ume the folded paper. Inside was a half-yen note, blue-colored and resembling a playing card.","Although Otama had said she need not bother to clean up, Ume decided at least to wash the dishes and, pouring hot water into a shallow wooden tub , she rattled the bowls and plates through it. Otama appeared in the kitchen with something wrapped in paper. “Here you are doing things!” she exclaimed. “There are hardly any dishes—I can do them. You fixed your hair last night so it’s all right as it is. Run now and change your kimono. Oh, and here’s something to take to your family in place of a proper present.” She handed the paper packet to the girl. Inside was one of the card-shaped, green half-yen notes."
「蛇退治を遣ったのだ」岡田は僕の方へ顔を向けた。,"""I sent a snake extermination,"" Okada turned to me.","“I killed a snake,” he said, turning toward me.","“I slew the dragon—or rather, the snake.” Okada turned to face me."
そこでお玉は一時こんな事を思って、無理に諦めを附けていた。わたしはあれきり岡田さんにお礼を言わないでいる。言わなくては済まぬお礼が言わずにあって見れば、わたしは岡田さんのしてくれた事を恩に被ている。このわたしが恩に被ていると云うことは岡田さんには分かっている筈である。こうなっているのが、却って下手にお礼をしてしまったより好いかも知れぬと思ったのである。,"So, Odama thought about this for a while and forcibly gave up. I don't thank Mr. Okada for all that. If you look at it without saying thank you, I am grateful for what Mr. Okada has done. Mr. Okada should know that I am suffering from grace. I thought that this might be better than thanking me badly.","She tried to resign herself temporarily by giving her thought a new direction: she hadn't yet thanked Okada Since she hadn't returned the kindness which she was duty-bound to return, she was under an obligation to him. And it was obvious that he knew she was. It might be all the better for her to remain in that situation instead of trying to repay him in a clumsy way.","Then she tried for a time looking at it this way, hoping to persuade herself it was all right to take no action at all. I have let all this time go by without thanking Mr. Okada, she reminded herself. In failing to express thanks where thanks were surely due, I have shown that I am willing to be indebted to him. And he must surely realize that I do in fact feel indebted to him. So, rather than expressing my thanks in a clumsy manner, it is perhaps better to leave things as they are."
「おや。又変な様子をしているな。どうしたのだい」上さんがいつもする「お帰りなさい」と云う挨拶をしないでいても、別に腹は立てない。機嫌が好いからである。,"""Oh, you're looking weird again. What's wrong?"" Even if you don't say ""Go home,"" which Mr. Ue always says, I'm not angry. Because I'm in a good mood.",“Oh?” said Suezo. “Strange looks again? What's wrong?” He was in such good humor that he wasn't in the least offended by his wife's failure to greet him as she usually did.,“What’s this—acting strange again? What’s the matter?” The fact that his wife had not bothered to give her customary greeting did not seem to anger him. He was in a good mood.
「それは跡へ綺麗なおっ母さんが来て、面倒を見てくれますでしょう。継子になるのだけど」,"""It will be a beautiful mother who will come to the trace and take care of it. I will be a stepchild.""",“Oh? A prettier mother will take my place and look after them. Though they'd be step-children.”,"“Later, though, a beautiful mother will come to look after them. But of course then they’ll be stepchildren.”"
「もうお膳を下げまして宜しゅうございましょうか」と、女中が勝手から顔を出して、尻上がりの早言に云った。馴染のないお玉には、なんと云ったか聞き取れない。髪を櫛巻にした小さい頭の下に太った顔の附いているのが、いかにも不釣合である。そしてその顔が不遠慮に、さも驚いたように、お玉を目守っている。,"""Shall I lower the table?"", The maid came out without permission and said to her ascending. I can't hear what I said to an unfamiliar ladle. It is disproportionate to have a fat face under a small head with combed hair. And his face was reluctant, and astonishingly, he was watching over the ladle.","“Are you finished?” asked the maid, her tone quick and her voice rising as she appeared suddenly at the entrance to the kitchen. Otama couldn't catch the girl's words. And when the maid, her hair rolled up around a comb so that it was out of proportion to her fat face, saw Otama, she stared at the visitor rudely. “Take it away!","“Shall I take the tray away?” asked the maid in her country dialect, poking her head in from the kitchen. Otama, unaccustomed to her way of speaking, did not catch the words. The maid, her hair rolled up on a comb in a manner that made her head seem too small for the plump face, stared rudely at Otama in her surprise."
お玉は聞いているうちに、顔の色が脣まで蒼くなった。そして良久しく黙っていた。世馴れぬ娘の胸の中で、込み入った種々の感情chaosカオスをなして、自分でもその織り交ぜられた糸をほぐして見ることは出来ぬが、その感情の入り乱れたままの全体が、強い圧を売られた無垢の処女の心の上に加えて、体じゅうの血を心の臓に流れ込ませ、顔は色を失い、背中には冷たい汗が出たのである。こんな時には、格別重大でない事が、最初に意識せられるものと見えて、お玉はこんな事があっては梅がもうこの内にはいられぬと云うだろうかと先ず思った。,"While listening to the ladle, the color of my face turned blue to the lips. And I was silent for a long time. In the heart of an unfamiliar girl, I can't see the interwoven threads by making various emotional chaos chaos, but the whole of the emotions is strong. In addition to the pressure-sold innocent virgin's heart, blood from all over her body flowed into her heart's internal organs, her face lost color, and her back sweated cold. At such times, it seemed that something that wasn't particularly serious was the first thing to be conscious of, and I first wondered if the ladle wouldn't be able to put plums in this place anymore.","As Ume spoke, Otama's face turned pale, and for a while she could not answer. A mixture of feelings tumbled inside the inexperienced girl. It was impossible for her to disentangle her confused thoughts, but the total confusion put so heavy a strain upon the heart of a pure girl sold that all her blood seemed to be drawn into it, draining the color from her face and leaving her back chilled with cold perspiration. On these occasions an insignificant thought seems to take hold of us. Would Ume continue to serve her after this disgrace?","As Otama listened, her face turned pale and for some time she remained silent. In the heart of the inexperienced young woman a hundred confused emotions mingled chaotically; even she herself could not have untangled their jumbled threads. A great weight pressed down on her heart and the blood from throughout her body rushed to it, leaving her white and cold with perspiration. Her first conscious thought, though surely of no real importance, was that after such an incident Ume would no longer be able to remain in the house."
「馬鹿言え。お茶受もあるのだ」爺いさんは起って、押入からブリキの鑵を出して、菓子鉢へ玉子煎餅を盛っている。「これは宝丹のじき裏の内で拵えているのだ。この辺は便利の好い所で、その側の横町には如燕の佃煮もある」,"""Say stupid. There is also a tea bowl."" The old man got up, took out the tin plate from the closet, and put the egg rice crackers in a confectionery bowl. ""This is in the back of Hotan. This area is a convenient place, and there is also Tsukudani in Yokomachi on that side.""","“What kind of nonsense is that! I've got some cake too.” He went over to the closet and, taking out a tin of egg-crackers, put some into a cake dish. “There's a baker not too far from here who makes these. And guess what? You can buy Joen's cooked fish in soy sauce in an alley right next to it!”","Otama protested. “Nonsense! I have some crackers here too. “The old man rose and brought some egg crackers from a tin in the cupboard, arranging them in a cake dish. “They make these right back of the Hōtan Pharmacy. This is a very convenient neighborhood for shopping. In the alley near there I can buy Jōen’s soy sauce relish.”"
梅は怪訝の目を睜った。まだ明治十何年と云う頃には江戸の町家の習慣律が惰力を持っていたので、市中から市中へ奉公に上がっていても、藪入の日の外には容易に内へは帰られぬことに極まっていた。,"Ume glanced at the suspicious eyes. By the time of the 10th year of the Meiji era, the customary rules of Edo townhouses had a coastal force, so even if you went up to the city from the city to the city, you could easily go inside outside the day of the bush. Was extremely unable to return.","The maid's eyes rounded in wonder. As late as the second decade of the Meiji era, the customs of the trades-men's houses in Edo were still kept up, although they were slowly dying out. As a result, even those servants whose families lived in the city were not easily allowed to go home except on Servants' Day.",Ume stared in astonishment. The year was 1880 and in the households of Tokyo the customs of earlier feudal times remained largely in effect; even servants whose families lived in the city were rarely allowed to return home to visit at any time other than the regular semiannual holidays.
「ええ。何が」,"""Yes. What?""",“What? What's getting dangerous?”,“What’s that?”
お玉はきょう機嫌の好い父親の顔を見て、阿茶の局の話を聞せて貰い、広小路に出来た大千住の出店で買ったと云う、一尺四方もある軽焼の馳走になった。そして父親が「まだ帰らなくても好いかい」と度々聞くのに、「大丈夫よ」と笑いながら云って、とうとう正午近くまで遊んでいた。そしてこの頃のように末造が不意に来ることのあるのを父親に話したら、あの帰らなくても好いかと云う催促が一層劇しくなるだろうと、心の中で思った。自分はいつか横着になって、末造に留守の間に来られてはならぬと云うような心遣をせぬようになっているのである。,"Odama saw the face of his father, who was in a good mood today, and asked him to talk about the station of Acha. .. And when my father often asked me if I didn't have to go home yet, I laughed and said, ""It's okay,"" and finally I was playing until near noon. And I thought in my heart that if I told my father that the squid might come unexpectedly like this time, the reminder that I didn't have to go home would be even more dramatic. One day, I'm lying down and trying not to think that I shouldn't come to the end of the building while I'm away.","On that day when Otama had left her house in such a joyous mood, she also found her father in good humor, listened to him recite a court tale, and ate a rice wafer of enormous size. “I bought it,” he said, “at a branch shop that just opened at Hirokoji. It's from the famous bakery at O-senju.” He asked her many times during their talk: “Isn't it time to go?” “Don't worry about it!” Otama said smiling. And she stayed there almost until noon. She knew that if she had told her father that lately Suezo sometimes came at the most unexpected hours, the old man would have urged her more frequently to go back. Otama had become more brazen and was not very anxious about Suezo's visits during her absence.","Otama, observing that her father was in an excellent mood today, let him tell her about Acha, the famous lady-in-waiting to the Tokugawa family, who was described at length in the book he was reading, and to regale her with some huge rice crackers he had bought at a branch of the Ōsenju bakery that had opened in Hirokōji. And when from time to time he asked, “Hadn’t you better be going now?” she replied with a laugh, “It’s still early!” and stayed on till almost noon. Had she mentioned that Suezō was likely to drop by at unexpected hours these days , she knew his inquiries would take on an even more anxious tone. As for herself, she had grown so indifferent that it did not bother her to think Suezō might call when she was out."
「わたくし贔屓なんかございませんの」,"""I don't have any favors.""","“I don't have any favorites,” she said.",“I don’t have any favorite.” “That’s because she’s never even seen a kabuki play!”
「いいえ。そうじゃないでしょう。あれは無縁坂の女のを買った序に、ふいと思い附いて、わたしのをも買って来たのでしょう」さっきから蝙蝠の話はしていても、こう具体的に云うと同時に、お常は悔やしさが込み上げて来るように感ずるのである。,"""No. That's not true. That was the beginning of buying the woman of Muenzaka, and I thought she bought my own too."" At the same time as saying this concretely, I usually feel that regret is coming.","“No, that's not exactly what I mean, I suppose. You did buy it for me, isn't that right? Because the idea just occurred to you when you picked one out for the woman at Muenzaka.” Otsune had injected the subject of the parasols into their discussion, and now that the words had taken definite shape, she couldn't help remembering her earlier rage. Suezo was startled by this direct hit from his wife, and he almost said aloud: “She's getting closer!”","“I know. You bought one for that woman on Muenzaka, and while you were at it you thought you’d buy me one too.” Otsune had brought up the subject of the parasol, but now, as she came to the crux of the affair, she felt her earlier rage and resentment boiling up again. Suezō, wincing at the accuracy of her attack, was almost tempted to reply, “You hit it!”"
末造は覚えず蹙めていた顔を、又覚えず晴やかにせずにはいられなかった。「いいえじゃあないぜ。困っちまう。どうしよう。どうしようと、ちゃんと顔に書いてあらあ」,"Suezou couldn't help but revive his face, which he hadn't remembered. ""No, I'm in trouble. What should I do? No matter what, write it on your face properly.""","In spite of frowning unconsciously, he brightened instantly. “Come, Otama, you know you're worried. It's written all over your face. I can just make out the words. Let me see,” he said, looking at her sharply.","Suezō’s face unconsciously contracted into a frown, but then as unconsciously brightened again. “What do you mean, nothing! ‘ What shall I do, what shall I do?’ you’re thinking."

Although I'm a little less than usual, I don't have the weakness of hiding the secrets of makeup and covering the eaves to make up beauty, so I don't have to worry about being seen separately.","Pushing back the top of her kimono and letting it slip off her shoulders, she washed herself quickly. She was not as careful as she usually was, but since she had no blemish to hide or smooth over by using make-up in secret, she had no reason to feel embarrassed at being observed.","Otama did not wash her body, but only lowered the collar of her kimono a short way and scrubbed her face busily. She did not wash as thoroughly as usual, but since she had no blemishes that needed to be disguised with makeup, there was no reason why she should mind if anyone watched."

爺いさんは飲んでしまった烟草の吸殻をはたくのも忘れて、なんだか急にえらくなったような娘の様子をぼんやりと眺めていると、娘は急に思い出した様に云った。「わたくしきょうはもう帰ってよ。こうして一度来て見れば、もうなんでもなくなったから、これからはお父っさんとこへ毎日のように見に来て上げるわ。実はあの人が往けと云わないうちに来ては悪いかと思って、遠慮していたの。とうとうゆうべそう云ってことわって置いて、けさ来たのだわ。わたくしの所へ来た女中は、それは子供で、お午の支度だって、わたくしが帰って手伝って遣らなくては出来ないの」,"The old man forgot to hit the cigarette butt that he had drank, and when he was vaguely gazing at the appearance of his daughter, who seemed to have suddenly become a gill, she said as if she suddenly remembered. ""I'm back today. Once I come here, I'm gone, so I'll come to see my dad every day. Actually, he'll come before he's gone. I thought it was bad, so I refrained from doing it. Finally, I said that, and I came here. The maid who came to me was a child, and she was preparing for lunch. I have to go home and help. ""","Otama seemed to have risen in the old man's estimation, and he looked at her so absent-mindedly that he forgot to knock out the ashes in his pipe. “I've got to go back now,” Otama said, as though she had suddenly remembered something. “Since I've found my way here once, it'll be easy to come again. From now on I'll visit almost every day. The reason I haven't been here sooner was that I didn't think it right to come until Suezo made the suggestion. But last night I finally told him that I wanted to visit you and got his consent. And so here I am today! My maid's really a child. She can't even prepare lunch without my help.”","The old man sat holding the burnt-out pipe he had been smoking and looked blankly at his daughter. She seemed suddenly to have grown so much older and more serious. “I must be getting back,” she said hurriedly, as though she had just remembered something. “ Now that I’ve seen that everything is all right , I’ll be visiting you every day. I had hesitated because I thought I’d better get his permission first, but last night he finally told me I could come. Now I have to run. The maid is such a child she can’t even fix lunch unless I’m there to help.”"

Anything might have done, but I thought of the cone as I just explained it. At any rate, my technique has met with success! Thanks to the formula of a cone, you were able to get beyond the policeman and maintain an unbefangen attitude!”","Ishihara too looked at the woman for a moment but apparently merely noted that she was attractive and then dismissed her completely from his mind. Presently he resumed his jabbering. “I explained to you the secret of maintaining stability of mind. But because you’ve had no proper training I was afraid that at the crucial moment you would be unable to put it into practice. So I employed a device to divert your minds in another direction. It wouldn’t have mattered what I talked about, but as I just explained, I decided to talk about the formula for the volume of a cone. In any event, the device worked. Thanks to the formula for the volume of a cone, you were able to maintain the proper unbefangen attitude and get past the policeman without difficulty.”"
女主人はうっとりと何か物を考えているらしく見えていたが、この詞を聞いて、岡田の方を見た。そして何か言いそうにして躊躇して、目を脇へそらした。それと同時に女は岡田の手に少し血の附いているのを見附けた。「あら、あなたお手がよごれていますわ」と云って、女中を呼んで上り口へ手水盥を持って来させた。岡田はこの話をする時女の態度を細かには言わなかったが、「ほんの少しばかり小指の所に血の附いていたのを、よく女が見附けたと、僕は思ったよ」と云った。,"The hostess seemed to be fascinated by something, but when she heard this lyrics, she looked toward Okada. Then he hesitated to say something and turned his eyes aside. At the same time, the woman found a little blood in Okada's hands.

Okada didn't elaborate on the woman's attitude when telling this story, but said, ""I thought she often found blood on her little finger."" ..","Apparently lost in thought, the mistress suddenly turned to him on hearing his words.

末造はつと席を起った。そして廊下に出て見ると、腰を屈めて、曲角の壁際に躊躇している爺いさんの背後に、怯れた様子もなく、物珍らしそうにあたりを見て立っているのがお玉であった。ふっくりした円顔の、可哀らしい子だと思っていたに、いつの間にか細面になって、体も前よりはすらりとしている。さっぱりとした銀杏返しに結って、こんな場合に人のする厚化粧なんぞはせず、殆ど素顔と云っても好い。それが想像していたとは全く趣が変っていて、しかも一層美しい。末造はその姿を目に吸い込むように見て、心の内に非常な満足を覚えた。お玉の方では、どうせ親の貧苦を救うために自分を売るのだから、買手はどんな人でも構わぬと、捨身の決心で来たのに、色の浅黒い、鋭い目に愛敬のある末造が、上品な、目立たぬ好みの支度をしているのを見て、捨てた命を拾ったように思って、これも刹那の満足を覚えた。,"Suezou suddenly got up from his seat. And when I went out into the corridor, I saw a ladle standing behind the old man who was hesitant at the wall of the curved corner, without any fear of being frightened. there were. I thought he was a poor child with a plump, round face, but before I knew it, he became finer and his body was slimmer than before. It is good to say that it is almost a real face without doing heavy makeup that people do in such cases because it is tied to a refreshing ginkgo. It's completely different from what I had imagined, and it's even more beautiful. Suezo looked at the figure as if he was sucking it into his eyes, and was very satisfied in his heart. In the case of ladles, they sell themselves to save their parents' poverty, so no matter who the buyer is, he decided to abandon him, but he had a dark-colored, sharp-eyed and adorable end. Seeing that he was preparing for an elegant, unobtrusive taste, he thought he had picked up his abandoned life, which also made him happy.","Suezo got to his feet and hurried out to the corridor. He saw the stooped figure of the old man as he hesitated near the corner wall and, behind him, Otama. She stood calmly, not at all overwhelmed, her eyes taking in everything with curiosity. The vision of a chubby girl with a pretty face swept through Suezo's mind, but the woman who appeared before him was totally different. Time had changed her. She was a thin, graceful beauty. She had arranged her hair in the style of a future bride and was without the customary make-up demanded on such occasions. Suezo had prepared himself for the pleasure, but he had not expected that the woman would be as she was. His eyes probed and registered. She was beyond anything he had imagined, and, for that, all the more beautiful. Otama was also surprised. She had previously thought that she did not care what the merchant was like. She would sell herself to anyone, no matter what his personality. She would do anything for her father. But on seeing Suezo's dark features, his keen but engaging eyes, and his elegant yet restrained kimono, she felt momentarily relieved, like a person escaping from a hopeless situation.","Suezō rose hastily from his seat and stepped into the hall, where the father stood bowing and hesitating by the wall where the corridor turned. Behind him was Otama, not looking at all intimidated but gazing around in curiosity. The plump-faced, attractive child had grown into a graceful woman, her hair done in a neat gingko-leaf coiffure, her slender face not heavily made-up, as one might expect on such an occasion, but almost unadorned. If she was quite different from what Suezō had imagined, she was more beautiful, and as he eagerly eyed her form he experienced a feeling of profound satisfaction. As for Otama, since she was to sell herself to spare her father hardship, she had made up her mind that it was of little importance who the buyer might be. But perceiving the affable look in Suezō’s keen dark eyes, and noting the elegance and refinement of his attire, it suddenly seemed to her as though she had regained the life she had given up as lost, and she too felt a momentary sense of gratification."
もう一月余り前の事であった。夫が或る日横浜から帰って、みやげに蝙蝠の日傘を買って来た。柄がひどく長くて、張ってある切れが割合に小さい。背の高い西洋の女が手に持っておもちゃにするには好かろうが、ずんぐりむっくりしたお常が持って見ると、極端に言えば、物干竿の尖へおむつを引っ掛けて持ったようである。それでそのまま差さずにしまって置いた。その傘は白地に細かい弁慶縞のような形が、藍で染め出してあった。たしがらやの店にいた女の蝙蝠傘がそれと同じだと云うことを、お常ははっきり認めた。,"It was about a month ago. One day my husband returned from Yokohama and bought a bat parasol as a souvenir. The handle is terribly long, and the stretched cuts are relatively small. It would be nice for a tall western woman to hold it in her hand and use it as a toy, but when she sees it with a stubby squirrel, in the extreme, it looks like she has a diaper hooked on the tip of a diaper. be. So I left it without inserting it. The umbrella had a fine Benkei stripe-like shape on a white background, dyed with indigo. I always clearly admitted that the woman's 蝙蝠 蝠 umbrella in the shop of Tashigaraya was the same.","A little more than a month ago, Otsune's husband had brought her a parasol as a gift on his return from Yokohama, one with a long handle out of proportion to the spread of the cloth. It would have been all right for a tall foreigner to toy with, but when the squat Otsune carried it, it resembled, to make an extreme comparison, a swaddling cloth attached to the top of a clothesrod. So Otsune had never used it. Its cloth was of white ground with a fine checkered pattern dyed in indigo. And Otsune had immediately recognized that the woman standing in front of the Tashigaraya owned the same kind of parasol.","A month or so earlier, when Suezō had gone to Yokohama, he had brought back a foreign-style parasol as a present for his wife. The handle was very long and in proportion made the top seem too small. Twirled playfully in the hands of a tall Western lady it might have been charming, but on the squat, chubby Otsune it resembled nothing so much as a child’s diaper stuck on the end of a laundry pole. She had never used it. It was covered in white cloth dyed with blue checks and was exactly the same, Otsune realized, as the parasol carried by the woman in front of the Tashigaraya."

松源の目見えと云うのは、末造が為めには一のfêteフェエトであった。一口に爪に火を点すなどとは云うが、金を溜める人にはいろいろある。細かい所に気を附けて、塵紙を二つに切って置いて使ったり、用事を葉書で済ますために、顕微鏡がなくては読まれぬような字を書いたりするのは、どの人にも共通している性質だろうが、それを絶待的に自己の生活の全範囲に及ぼして、真に爪に火を点す人と、どこかに一つ穴を開けて、息を抜くようにしている人とがある。これまで小説に書かれたり、芝居に為組まれたりしている守銭奴は、殆ど絶待的な奴ばかりのようである。活きた、金を溜める男には、実際そうでないのが多い。吝な癖に、女には目がないとか、不思議に食奢だけはするとか云うのがそれである。前にもちょっと話したようであったが、末造は小綺麗な身なりをするのが道楽で、まだ大学の小使をしていた時なんぞは、休日になると、お定まりの小倉の筒袖を脱ぎ棄てて、気の利いた商人らしい着物に着換えるのであった。そしてそれを一種の楽みにしていた。学生どもが稀に唐桟ずくめの末造に邂逅して、びっくりすることのあったのは、こうしたわけである。そこで末造には、この外にこれと云う道楽がない。芸娼妓なんぞに掛かり合ったこともなければ、料理屋を飲んで歩いたこともない。蓮玉で蕎麦を食う位が既に奮発の一つになっていて、女房や子供は余程前まで、こう云う時連れて行って貰うことが出来なかった。それは女房の身なりを自分の支度に吊り合うようにはしていなかったからである。女房が何かねだると、末造はいつも「馬鹿を言うな、手前なんぞは己とは違う、己は附合があるから、為方なしにしているのだ」と云って撥ね附けたのである。その後だいぶ金が子を生んでからは、末造も料理屋へ出這入することがあったが、これはおお勢の寄り合う時に限っていて、自分だけが客になって行くのではなかった。それがお玉に目見えをさせると云うことになって、ふいと晴がましい、solennelソランネルな心持になって、目見えは松源にしようと云い出したのである。,"The appearance of Matsugen was one fête feet for the sake of the final production. It is said to light a nail in a bite, but there are many people who save money. Anyone who pays attention to the details, cuts the dust paper in two and uses it, or writes characters that can not be read without a microscope in order to finish the work with a postcard. It may be a common property, but it is desperately exerted on the whole range of one's life, and with a person who truly ignites his nails, make a hole somewhere and take a breath. There are people who are. It seems that most of the monetary men who have been written in novels or organized for plays are almost desperate. Many live, money-storing men don't really. It is a habit that a woman has no eyes, or mysteriously only eats. As I mentioned before, it's easy to dress beautifully in Kimono, and when I was still a college ambassador, when it was a holiday, I used the usual Kokura sleeves. He took it off and changed into a kimono that looked like a smart merchant. And it was a kind of fun. This is why the students were surprised when they rarely encountered the end of the Karaji. Therefore, there is no such thing as this in Suezou. I've never been involved in geisha, and I've never drank a restaurant and walked. Eating soba with lotus balls was already one of the inspirations, and my wife and children couldn't take me to this time until a while ago. That's because I didn't try to hang my wife's clothes on my own. When my wife asked for something, Suezou always repelled, saying, ""Don't make a fool, you're different from yourself, you have a relationship, so you're doing nothing."" .. After a lot of money gave birth to a child, Suezou sometimes went to the restaurant, but this was only when the crowds got together, and he was not the only customer. rice field. It was supposed to make the ladle visible, and it became a wonderful, solennel-like feeling, and he said that the appearance should be Matsugen.","SUEZO thought of the approaching meeting with his future mistress at the Matsugen as a celebration. We often hear that misers will even skin flints, but men who make large fortunes by thrift are not uniform in their behavior. Perhaps, as a group, these men give attention to such trifles as cutting sheets of toilet paper in half or filling out postcards with characters you cannot decipher without the aid of a microscope. Some of the most covetous are thrifty in every aspect of living, yet a few give themselves a breath of fresh air by leaving a loophole in their tight moneybags. Up to the present time the misers we have read about in novels or have seen on the stage seem to belong to the absolute type. But those we meet in life are not like that. Some of the most frugal loosen their purse strings to the final notch for women, and others gorge themselves with sumptuous foods. I have already referred to Suezo's passion for clothing. Even during his difficult days of university employment, he was often completely transformed on holidays, his weekday outfit of inferior cotton replaced by a handsome kimono. He seemed like a smart-looking, successful merchant instead of a dormitory servant. This was a pleasure to him, and occasionally he dressed himself up in costly taffeta clothes and startled students who happened to pass and recognize him. Dress had been Suezo's only hobby. He had not associated with geishas or prostitutes, and a night of saké at one of the drinking houses had been an impossibility. Even a bowl of noodles at the Rengyokuan had been a luxury for himself alone, and only recently had he permitted his wife and children to share the treat. He had not taken his wife out because he had not let her dress in a kimono to match his own expensive one. When she wanted a costly item for herself, he denied it to her. “Don't talk like that,” he had argued. “You and I are quite different. I've got to dress this way because of the men I associate with.” When Suezo's loans had started to bring in large sums, he began eating out. Yet he always justified the expense by going to a restaurant with his friends and never alone. But now that he was about to see Otama at the Matsugen, he wanted to make it a special affair, something gay and impressive.","The meeting at the Matsugen Restaurant was for Suezō a festive occasion. People speak in general terms of penny-pinchers, but in fact there are many varieties of the breed. All share in common a nature particularly attentive to the little points of saving that causes them to tear a sheet of toilet paper in half before using it, or to attempt to conduct business by postcard rather than letter, writing in characters so small that one must use a magnifying glass to decipher the message. But while some will pursue this stifling frugality throughout every aspect of their lives, others will, as it were, leave themselves some little hole through which to breathe. The misers portrayed in fiction and drama up to now have usually been of the former, uncompromising type. Real life specimens, however, are often quite different. Tight as they may be in some matters, they will make vast exceptions where a woman is concerned, or be unaccountably lavish when it comes to food and drink. As noted earlier, for Suezō it was one of the pleasures of life to maintain a clean and neat appearance. While he was still a porter at the university, he would on holidays exchange his customary tight-sleeved cotton coat for the fine kimono of a merchant, so that students meeting him by chance on such occasions would stare in astonishment at his silken-clad figure. Beyond this delight he took in his appearance, however, he had no particular diversions or extravagances. He was involved in no intrigues with geishas or prostitutes, nor did he spend his time dining and drinking about town. A bowl of noodles at the Rengyokuan was a big splurge for him, and until recently his wife and children had never been invited to accompany him on such occasions. He considered it unnecessary to have his wife’s appearance match his own. When she would plead with him to buy her some item, he would advise her curtly not to talk nonsense. “You’re not like me,” he would add by way of explanation. “I have appearances to keep up, contacts to maintain, so I am obliged to dress like this!” After he began to be better off, he occasionally went to some restaurant for dinner, but always with a group; he never went alone. When he made the arrangements to meet Otama, however, he was suddenly taken with a mood of festive ostentation and gave instructions that the meeting was to be held at the Matsugen."

お玉はこの時もう余程落ち着いていた。あきらめはこの女の最も多く経験している心的作用で、かれの精神はこの方角へなら、油をさした機関のように、滑かに働く習慣になっている。,"The ladle was already very calm at this time.

Resignation was the mental attitude she had most experienced. And in this direction her mind adjusted itself like a well-oiled machine.,"—so fastidious was she about her clothes.

梅はじっと血色の亡くなった主人の顔を見ていて、主人がひどく困っていると云うことだけは暁ったが、何に困っているのか分からない。つい腹が立って帰っては来たが、午のお菜がまだないのに、このままにしていては済まぬと云うことに気が付いた。さっき貰って出て行ったお足さえ、まだ帯の間に挿んだきりで出さずにいるのであった。「ほんとにあんな厭なお上さんてありやしないわ。あんな内のお肴を誰が買って遣るものか。もっと先の、小さいお稲荷さんのある近所に、もう一軒ありますから、すぐに行って買って来ましょうね」慰めるようにお玉の顔を見て起ち上がる。お玉は梅が自分の身方になってくれた、刹那の嬉しさに動されて、反射的に微笑んで頷く。梅はすぐばたばたと出て行った。,"Ume was staring at the face of her deceased master, and I was afraid that she was in great trouble, but I don't know what she was in trouble with. I got angry and came home, but I realized that I couldn't leave it as it was, even though I didn't have any vegetables for the afternoon. Even the legs that I got and went out were still stuck between the belts. ""I don't really have such a nasty boss. Who buys and buys the side dishes in that? There is another one in the neighborhood where there is a small ladle, so go and buy it right away. Let's come. ""Looking at the face of the ladle to comfort him, he stood up. The ladle was moved by the joy of the moment when Ume became herself, and she smiled reflexively and nodded. The plums fluttered out immediately.","As the girl watched Otama, she could see that her words had upset her mistress. But she could not guess what had caused Otama such dismay. The girl had returned to the house in a fit, but now it seemed that the food for lunch was indispensable, and she still carried the coins in the folds of her sash. “I never met such a nasty person!” Ume said, a look of compassion on her face. “Why! Who'd shop at such a place? Not me. There's another shop up ahead of that one. Near a fox-shrine. That's where I'll go. And right away too.” And she got up from the mats to run out. Otama gave her an automatic smile and a nod, moved at finding a friend in Ume, who hurried out of the room.","Ume gazed at the pale, bloodless face of her mistress, sensing merely that she was in great distress without comprehending the cause. She had returned in anger from the store, but she realized that, since there was still nothing for lunch, she could hardly leave things as they were. The money her mistress had given her to do the shopping with was still stuck into the sash of her kimono. “I’ve never seen such a nasty old woman,” she said in an effort to be comforting. “I don’t know who would buy her old fish anyway! There’s another store down by the Inari Shrine. I’ll just run down there and get something, shall I?” Otama felt a momentary joy that Ume had declared herself her ally, and her face reflected a weak smile as she nodded her approval. Ume bounded off with a clatter."
同じ虞初新誌の中に、今一つ岡田の好きな文章がある。それは小青伝であった。その伝に書いてある女、新しい詞で形容すれば、死の天使を閾の外に待たせて置いて、徐かに脂粉の粧を擬すとでも云うような、美しさを性命にしているあの女が、どんなにか岡田の同情を動かしたであろう。女と云うものは岡田のためには、只美しい物、愛すべき物であって、どんな境遇にも安んじて、その美しさ、愛らしさを護持していなくてはならぬように感ぜられた。それには平生香奩体の詩を読んだり、sentimentalサンチマンタルな、fatalistiqueファタリスチックな明清の所謂才人の文章を読んだりして、知らず識らずの間にその影響を受けていた為めもあるだろう。,"There is another favorite sentence of Okada in the same new magazine. It was Koseiden. The woman written in the biography, if you describe it with new lyrics, puts the angel of death waiting outside the threshold and gradually imitates the beauty of oil powder. That woman would have moved Okada's sympathy somehow. For Okada, a woman is a beautiful and lovable thing, and I feel that she must be comfortable in any situation and protect her beauty and loveliness. Was done. For that reason, I read the poems of Kaoru Hirai, and the texts of the so-called talented people of the sentimental sanctuary, fatalistique, Ming and Qing, and I was influenced by it without knowing it. there will be.","Obviously, this activity was a manifestation of his desire to practice martial arts. A type of woman in these romantic tales also appealed to Okada. She is the woman who makes beauty her sole aim in life so that, with perfect ease, she goes through an elaborate toilet even while the angel of death waits outside her door. Okada felt that a woman should be only a beautiful object, something lovable, a being who keeps her beauty and loveliness no matter what situation she is in. Okada probably picked up this sentiment unconsciously, partly under the influence of his habitual reading of old Chinese romantic love poetry and the sentimental and fatalistic prose works of the so-called wits of the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties.","There was another work in the Yü Gh’u hsin-chih that Okada liked to read, “The Life of Little Blue,” a story of a beautiful but ill-fated young woman. The women featured in Chinese tales of this sort would, to put it in somewhat novel fashion, keep the angel of death himself waiting on their threshold until they had meticulously applied their powder and makeup. Such women, for whom beauty was their very life, moved Okada deeply. He viewed women in simple terms, as beautiful beings, lovable beings, who could be content in any setting whatever; and their beauty and lovableness he felt it was his duty to guard and protect. In the course of reading poems in “fragrant trousseau” style that dwelt on feminine charm, or the sentimental and fatalistic romances of the Ming and Ch’ing litterateurs, he unwittingly fell deeper and deeper under the spell of such ideas."
末造は黙って女房を観察し出した。そして意外な事を発見した。それはお常の変な素振が、亭主の内にいる時殊に甚しくて、留守になると、却って醒覚したようになって働いていることが多いと云う事である。子供や下女の話を聞いて、この関係を知った時、末造は最初は驚いたが、怜悧な頭で色々に考えて見た。これはする事の気に食わぬ己の顔を見ている間、この頃の病気を出すのだ。己は女房にどうかして夫が冷澹だと思わせまい、疎まれるように感ぜさせまいとしているのに、却って己が内にいる時の方が不機嫌だとすると、丁度薬を飲ませて病気を悪くするようなものである。こんなつまらぬ事はない。これからは一つ反対にして見ようと末造は思った。,"Suezou silently observed his wife. And I found something unexpected. It is said that the usual strange behavior is especially severe when he is inside the host, and when he is away, he often works as if he were awake. When I heard the story of a child and a maiden and learned about this relationship, Suezou was surprised at first, but he thought about it with a stern head. This causes the illness of this time while looking at my face, which I don't like to do. I'm trying to make my wife think that my husband is cold and not make me feel lonely, but if I'm in a bad mood when I'm inside, I just give him medicine and get sick. It's like making it worse. There is nothing like this boring. From now on, Suezou decided to look at it in the opposite direction.","He had prided himself on his ability to correct others by alluding to their weaknesses in a light-hearted manner, but he found that his wife became even more violent when he tried to humor her. He began to observe her secretly, and he was surprised to find that her strange behavior was more noticeable when he stayed at home, for when he was out of the house she seemed like a person who had awakened from a stupor, and she went about her household tasks. When he learned this fact after talking with the children and the maid, he was at first startled. With his shrewdness in logic he tried to account for her conduct. Her illness, he reasoned, grew worse in his presence because she was dissatisfied with his behavior. He had tried not to act like a cold-hearted husband, and he had avoided any possibility of giving her the impression that there was any estrangement between them. But since he noticed that she was even more out of sorts when he purposely stayed at home, it seemed that his remedy only aggravated her illness. “I'll change my methods,” he said to himself.","Observing his wife in silence, Suezō discovered a curious fact. While he was around the house, she acted very strangely, but when he was away she seemed to come to her senses and go about her work as usual. Having confirmed this observation by questioning the children and the maid, he was at first puzzled. With his usual shrewdness he pondered the situation. His behavior greatly angered his wife, and as long as he was in her presence, the sickness possessed her. He had hoped to avoid giving her the impression that he had grown cold or that there was any estrangement between them. But if, on the contrary, his being around the house merely irritated her, then what he had intended as a cure was in fact making the sickness worse. That clearly would not do. In the future, Suezō decided, he would try the opposite approach."
「まあ。あの柳原の寄席へ、お父っさんと聞きに行った時、何か御馳走のお話をして、その旨きこと、己の店の佃煮の如しと云って、みんなを笑わせましたっけね。本当に福福しいお爺いさんね。高座へ出ると、行きなりお尻をくるっとまくって据わるのですもの。わたくし可笑しくって。お父っさんもあんなにお太りなさるようだと好いわ」,"""Well. When I went to Yanagihara's yose with my dad, I talked about a treat and made everyone laugh, saying that it was like Tsukudani in my store. It's a really fortunate old man. When I go out to the high seat, I suddenly roll up my ass and set it up. I'm funny. I like my dad to be so fat. rock""","“Ah, Joen! Do you remember, Otossan, when you took me to the music hall? And Joen was there? Talking about a feast he went to, saying the fish was as good as his own. And how we laughed! What a pleasingly plump man he was! Coming on stage and flinging up his kimono before sitting down. I could hardly keep myself from laughing out loud. I wish you'd get that fat!” “What? Be as fat as him? Not me!”","“Jōen! I remember when you took me to the Yanagihara Theater to hear Jōen tell his stories. That time it was something about a banquet he went to and how good everything tasted, and he said, ‘It tasted almost as good as the soy sauce relish I make in my store!’ Didn’t the audience laugh! Such a fat, jolly man, and when he came on stage and suddenly flipped up the rear of his kimono before he sat down—it struck me as so funny! You should get fat like that, Papa.” “I couldn’t stand being that fat,” said the old man as he put the dish of crackers down by his daughter."
お常はびっくりして立ち留まった。下を向いてずんずん歩いていて、我家の門を通り過きようとしたのである。,I was always surprised and stayed. I was walking down and trying to pass through my gate.,"Otsune stopped, startled. She had been walking with her head down and was about to pass her own house.","the maid suddenly called to her. Staring at the ground and hurrying along, Otsune had gone past the gate of her own house."
お玉は跡にそのまま動かずにいる。気の張が少し弛んで、次第に涌いて来る涙が溢れそうになるので、袂からハンカチイフを出して押えた。胸の内には只悔やしい、悔やしいと云う叫びが聞える。これがかの混沌とした物の発する声である。肴屋が売ってくれぬのが憎いとか、売ってくれぬような身の上だと知って悔やしいとか、悲しいとか云うのでないことは勿論であるが、身を任せることになっている末造が高利貸であったと分かって、その末造を憎むとか、そう云う男に身を任せているのが悔やしいとか、悲しいとか云うのでもない。お玉も高利貸は厭なもの、こわいもの、世間の人に嫌われるものとは、仄かに聞き知っているが、父親が質屋の金しか借りたことがなく、それも借りたい金高を番頭が因業で貸してくれぬことがあっても、父親は只困ると云うだけで番頭を無理だと云って怨んだこともない位だから、子供が鬼がこわい、お廻りさんがこわいのと同じように、高利貸と云う、こわいものの存在を教えられていても、別に痛切な感じは持っていない。そんなら何が悔やしいのだろう。,"The ladle is still in the trace. My tension was a little loose, and the tears that were dripping gradually seemed to overflow, so I took out a handkerchief from the skirt and held it down. I can hear a cry of regret and regret in my chest. This is the voice of that chaotic thing. Of course, it's not that we hate that the appetizers don't sell, or that we're sad or sad to know that we don't sell, but we're supposed to leave it to us. It's not that he hates the end-of-life when he finds out that he was a usury, or that it's regrettable or sad to leave himself to such a man. I know that usury is a bad thing, a scary thing, and something that people dislike, but my father has only borrowed money from a pawn shop, and the head of the money is the one he wants to borrow. Even if he doesn't lend me for some reason, my father hasn't been grudged that he can't take the lead just because he's in trouble, so the child is scared of the demon and the policeman is scared. Similarly, even if you are taught the existence of a scary thing called usury, you don't feel any pain. What is regrettable like that?","Otama remained seated. As the strain became less intense, she began to cry quietly and reached into her kimono sleeve for a handkerchief. She heard a voice cry out: “It's not fair! How cruel!” It was her own confusion. By these words she did not mean that she hated the woman who refused to sell her the fish, nor did she feel sad or mortified in recognizing that her status had barred her from a simple fish market. She did not even feel resentment toward Suezo, who had purchased her and who had now turned out to be a usurer. It was humiliating to belong to such a man, but she did not even feel that. She had heard that usurers were disgusting persons, looked down on, feared, detested. But her father's only experience in that direction had been with pawnbrokers. And when their clerks had not been kind enough to give him the sum he needed, he had never complained in spite of the inconvenience. So, even though she had been told that such men existed, her fear was similar to that of a child toward an ogre or a policeman—not a particularly keen one. What then was this despair she suddenly felt?","Otama remained for a while without moving. Then her taut nerves began gradually to relax and tears welled up in her eyes. She pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve to press them back. In her mind was only one thought— how dreadful! how dreadful! Did she hate the fish store for not selling her anything, she wondered, or was she ashamed or sorry that she was the sort of person they would not sell to? No, it was none of these. Nor indeed was it that she hated Suezō, the man to whom she had given herself and who she now knew was a moneylender, nor did she feel any particular shame or regret that she had given herself to such a man. She had heard from others that moneylenders were nasty, frightening people, hated by everyone. But her father had never borrowed money from one. He had always gone to the pawnshop, and even when the clerk there had hardheartedly refused to give him as much as he asked for, the old man never expressed any resentment over the clerk’s unreasonableness, but would merely shake his head sadly. As a child fears ghosts or policemen, Otama counted moneylenders among those to be afraid of, but she did so with no very vivid or personal emotion. What then was so dreadful?"
しかし二日ばかり立ってから、岡田は又無縁坂の方へ向いて出掛けて、例の格子戸の家の前近く来た時、先きの日の湯帰りの女の事が、突然記憶の底から意識の表面に浮き出したので、その家の方を一寸見た。竪に竹を打ち附けて、横に二段ばかり細く削った木を渡して、それを蔓で巻いた肱掛窓がある。その窓の障子が一尺ばかり明いていて、卵の殻を伏せた万年青の鉢が見えている。こんな事を、幾分かの注意を払って見た為めに、歩調が少し緩くなって、家の真ん前に来掛かるまでに、数秒時間の余裕を生じた。,"However, after standing for only two days, Okada went to Muenzaka again, and when he came near the front of the lattice door house, he suddenly remembered the woman who returned from the hot spring the other day. As it emerged from the bottom to the surface of my consciousness, I took a quick look at the house. Bamboo is struck on the vertical, and a tree that has been cut into two steps is passed to the side, and there is an elbow window that is wrapped with vines. The shoji screen of the window is only one shaku open, and you can see the perennial blue bowl with the egg shells lying down. After seeing this with some care, my pace slowed down a bit, giving me a few seconds to get to the front of my house.","But about two days later he again took the same direction, and when he came near the house with the lattice door, he glanced at it, suddenly remembering the stranger from the public bath. He looked at the bow window with its vertically nailed bamboo canes and two thin, horizontal pieces of wood wound with vines. The window screen had been left open about a foot and revealed a potted plant. As he gave some attention to these details, he slowed down somewhat, and it took a few moments before he reached the front of the house.","Two days later, however, when he again headed toward Muenzaka and drew near the house with the lattice door, he suddenly recalled the woman he had met coming back from the bath, and he turned to look at the house. It had a bay window fitted with a grating of bamboo uprights and two thin, vine-entwined horizontal strips of wood. The sliding paper panels of the window had been opened about a foot, revealing a pot with lilies growing in it. He slowed his pace a little to be able to observe more closely, and as he arrived directly in front of the house, all at once, above the potted plant, from the background that until then had been lost in gray darkness, a pale face appeared."
「ねえ、奥さん。そんなに好い女じゃありませんでしょう。顔が平べったくて、いやに背が高くて」,"""Hey, wife. I don't think she likes that much. She has a flat face and is unpleasantly tall.""","Otsune and her maid turned toward the pond at the corner of a saké dealer's shop, and the maid said propitiatingly: “You see, Okusan, she's not a very pretty woman. Her face is flat and she's too tall!”","As they turned the corner by the saké shop and started toward the pond, the maid tried to cheer her mistress up. “I don’t think she’s so pretty at all, do you? Her face is too flat and she’s so awfully tall!”"
お玉の所へ末造の来る度数は、時の立つに連れて少くはならないで、却って多くなった。それはこれまでのように極まって晩に来る外に、不規則な時間にちょいちょい来るようになったのである。なぜそうなったかと云うに、女房のお常がうるさく附き纏って、どうかしてくれ、どうかしてくれと云うので、ふいと逃げ出して無縁坂へ来るからである。いつも末造がそんな時、どうもすることはない、これまで通りにしていれば好いのだと云うと、どうにかしなくてはいられぬと云って、里へ帰られぬ事や、子供の手放されぬ事や、自分の年を取った事や、つまり生活状態の変更に対するあらゆる障碍を並べて口説き立てる。それでも末造はどうもすることはない、どうもしなくても好いと繰り返す。そのうちにお常は次第に腹を立てて来て、手が附けられぬようになる。そこで飛び出すことになっている。何事も理窟っぽく、数学的に物を考える末造が為めには、お常の言っている事が不思議でならない。丁度一方が開け放されて、三方が壁で塞がれている間の、その開け放された戸口を背にして立っていて、どちらへも往かれぬと云って、悶え苦む人を見るような気がする。戸口は開け放されているではないか。なぜ振り返って見ないのだと云うより外に、その人に対して言うべき詞はない。お常の身の上はこれまでより楽にこそなっているが、少しも圧制だの窘迫だの掣肘だのを受けてはいない。なるほど無縁坂と云うものが新に出来たには相違ない。しかし世間の男のように、自分はその為めに、女房に冷澹になったとか、苛酷になったとか云うことはない。寧ろこれまでよりは親切に、寛大に取り扱っている。戸口は依然として開け放されているではないかと思うのである。,"The frequency of the ladles coming to the ladle did not decrease as time went by, but rather increased. It has come to come at irregular times, in addition to coming at the extreme evenings as before. The reason why this happened is that my wife's usual messed up and asked me to do something about it, so I ran away and came to Muenzaka. There is nothing I can do when the end of the construction is always like that, and if I say that it is good if I keep doing it as before, I can not go back to the village or let go of my child because I have to do something about it. I argue with all the obstacles to things that I haven't done, things that I'm getting older, that is, changes in my living conditions. Still, there is nothing I can do about the end of the construction, and I repeat that I like it even if I do not do it. In the meantime, he gets angry and gets out of hand. It is supposed to jump out there. Everything is like a cave, and it's no wonder what you always say for the sake of mathematically thinking about things. I see a person who is in agony, standing with his back to the open door while one is open and three sides are blocked by a wall, saying that he cannot go to either. feel like. Isn't the door open? There is no word to say to that person other than why he doesn't look back. My usual body is easier than ever, but I haven't received any oppression, pressure, or elbows. Indeed, there must be a new thing called Muenzaka. However, unlike a man in the world, he never became cold or harsh in his wife because of that. Rather, they are treated more kindly and generously than ever before. I suspect that the doorway is still open.","WITH THE passing of time Suezo's visits to Otama grew even more frequent, for not only did he come without fail at night as he had previously done, but he began to visit at irregular periods during the day as well. These were moments of escape from his wife, who followed him abut with the annoying demand: “You've got to do something for me!” When he tried to persuade her that nothing had to be done and that it was all right to live as they had been living, she insisted: “I can't go on like this! I can't return to my parents' home! I can't give up my children! I'm getting old!” These were the objections she listed to any possible change in her life. Suezo often repeated: “There's no need to make any change. We'll stay as we are.” And as they argued about these matters, Otsune would lose her temper and get so wrought up that Suezo would rush out of the house. He had always been able to reason logically and mathematically, so his wife's words were ridiculous and unintelligible to him. She seemed to him like a person struggling to find his way out of a room that has three walls and a door wide open behind him. All one could possibly say to such a creature was “Turn around!” Her life was more comfortable than it had ever been, and she was neither oppressed nor restrained. True, the Muenzaka woman was a new factor for her, hut Suezo had grown neither more cold nor more cruel because of the woman—examples to the contrary can certainly be found among other men—and he told himself: “I'm even kinder, more generous.” Why, he wondered, didn't she see the door, still left wide open?","With the passage of time Suezō’s visits to Otama became not fewer but more frequent. He came not only in the evenings as he had in the past, but began dropping by at all hours during the day. He was in fact fleeing to Muenzaka from the persistent nagging of his wife, who kept demanding to know what he intended to do about her. Suezō at such times would assure her that he was not going to do anything, that things could perfectly well go along as they were. She would insist that something had to be done, but then would complain that she no longer had her own home to return to, that she couldn’t just go off and leave the children, that she was getting on in years, in effect citing all the obstacles that stood in the way of a change in her mode of living. Suezō went on reiterating that nothing need be done, but Otsune would grow more and more angry and upset till she was quite impossible to deal with. At that point Suezō would flee the house. Accustomed to consider everything with mathematical logic, Suezō found these reproaches of Otsune’s utterly incomprehensible. He felt as though he were watching the inane agonies of a person who stands facing three blank walls, a door open right behind him, and cries, “Where shall I go? I can’t get out!” “The door is open! Why don’t you turn around and look!” was all he had to say to such a person. Otsune had never known an easier life; she was subject to no oppression, no restraint, no harassment whatsoever. True, there was a new factor in the situation, the woman on Muenzaka. But Suezō had not on that account grown harsh or cold toward his wife, as so many men might. On the contrary he treated Otsune with greater kindness and liberality than before. The door was standing wide open."
お玉も小さい時から別れていたことのない父親が、どんな暮らしをしているか、往って見たいとは思っている。しかし檀那が毎日のように来るので、若し留守を明けていて、機嫌を損じてはならないと云う心配から、一日一日と、思いながら父親の所へ尋ねて行かずに過すのである。檀那は朝までいることはない。早い時は十一時頃に帰ってしまう。又きょうは外へ行かなくてはならぬのだが、ちょいと寄ったと云って、箱火鉢の向うに据わって、烟草を呑んで帰ることもある。それでもきょうは檀那がきっと来ないと見極めの附いた日というのがないので、思い切って出ることが出来ない。昼間出れば出られぬことはない筈だが、使っている小女が子供と云っても好い位だから、何一つ任せて置かれない。それになんだか近所のものに顔を見られるような気がして、昼間は外へ出たくない。初のうちは坂下の湯に這入りに行くにも、今頃は透いているか見て来ておくれと、小女に様子を見て来させた上で、そっと行った位である。,"I would like to go back and see what kind of life my father, who has never parted from when he was a ladle, is living. However, since Danna comes every day, she is absent and worried that she should not be in a bad mood, so she spends her days without asking her father. Danna never stays until morning. At the earliest, I will return around 11 o'clock. Also, I have to go outside today, but sometimes I say that I stopped by and set up behind the brazier and swallowed a cigarette. Even so, I can't take the plunge because there is no day when I'm sure that Danna will not come today. If you go out in the daytime, you shouldn't be able to go out, but since the little girl you're using is a good child, you can't leave anything to it. I don't want to go out during the day because I feel like I can see my face in the neighborhood. At first, even when I went to crawl into Sakashita's hot water, I asked the little girl to see if it was transparent by this time, and then I went softly.","OTAMA, who had never been away from her father, was eager to know how he was. Yet, in spite of this desire, several days had passed without her being able to visit him. She was afraid that Suezo might come when she was out, and she feared that he would be annoyed if he did not find her. Usually he came at night and stayed until eleven, but he began to appear briefly at odd hours. The first time he came during the day he said, sitting down opposite her in front of the charcoal brazier: “I've dropped in on my way to an appointment. I'll just smoke a cigarette and go.” As a matter of fact, Otama seldom knew when he would come, so she didn't have the courage to leave. She might have slipped out in the morning, but she considered Ume an unreliable child. Moreover, Otama didn't want to be seen then or in the afternoon, for she didn't like the thought of the neighbors staring at her. She was so shy that at first she went to the bathhouse below the slope only after she had sent Ume out to see that it was not crowded.","Otama, who had never before been separated from her father, often thought of going to see how he was getting along. She was afraid, however, that Suezō, who came every day, might be annoyed if she were out when he called, and so her plan to visit her father was put off from one day to the next. Suezō never stayed until morning, and often he left as early as eleven. At other times, explaining that he had business that evening, he would stay only long enough for a moment’s smoke by the brazier. Yet there was no evening on which Otama could say for sure that he would not come. She might have gone to her father’s in the daytime, but Ume, the maid, was such a child that it was impossible to trust her to do anything alone. And in any case, Otama did not care to leave the house when the neighbors could see her. At first she was so shy that she would not venture to the public bath at the foot of the slope without sending the maid down first to see how crowded it was, after which she would slip out to take her bath."
お玉はにっこりした。「わたくしこれで段々えらくなってよ。これからは人に馬鹿にせられてばかりはいない積なの。豪気でしょう」,"The ladle was smiling. ""I'm getting better and better with this. From now on, I'm not just being ridiculed by people.","“Ah, I'm getting smarter,” she said with a smile, “bit by bit. From now on I'm not going to be made a fool of.","Otama smiled. “I’ve grown up, Papa. From now on I don’t intend to be made a fool of by others."
「あんな本を読んだ跡だからねえ、僕はさぞ馬鹿げた顔をして歩いていただろうと思うよ」と、岡田は云った。,"""I think I would have walked with a silly face because it was a trace of reading such a book,"" Okada said.","“I must have looked awfully silly after reading that sort of book,” said Okada.","“I’d just been reading that sort of book, you see, and I must have had a pretty stupid expression on my face as I walked along,” Okada explained."
「それはあなたは太平楽を言っていられますでしょう。わたしさえどうにかなってしまえば好いのだから」,"""That's what you're talking about, because I just want to get rid of it.""",“Go on.

話が極まって、お玉は無縁坂へ越して来ることになった。,The story was so complete that the ladle came to Muenzaka.,Otama would live in the house Suezo had bought on Muenzaka.,In the end it was decided that Otama would go to live in the Muenzaka house.

「何か刃物はありませんか」と岡田は云った。主人の女が一人の小娘に、「あの台所にある出刃を持ってお出で」と言い附けた。その娘は女中だったと見えて、稽古に隣へ来ていると云う外の娘達と同じような湯帷子を着た上に紫のメリンスでくけた襷を掛けていた。肴を切る庖刀で蛇を切られては困るとでも思ったか、娘は抗議をするような目附きをして主人の顔を見た。「好いよ、お前の使うのは新らしく買って遣るから」と主人が云った。娘は合点が行ったと見えて、駆けて内へ這入って出刃庖刀を取って来た。,"""Are there any blades?"" Okada said. The husband's woman told a little girl, ""Take the blade in that kitchen and go out."" The girl seemed to be a maid, and she wore a yukatabira similar to the outside girls who came next to her during the lesson, and hung a sash with purple muslin. I thought it would be a problem to cut a snake with a sword that cuts a side dish, but my daughter looked at her husband's face with a protesting look. ""I like it, because you're buying a new one,"" said the master. The daughter seemed to have reached the point, so she rushed in and fetched the Deba sword.","“Do you have something sharp in the house?” he asked. “Run in,” said the mistress to a small girl, “and get a knife from the kitchen.” Perhaps the girl was the maid, for even though she wore a summer kimono similar to the other girls', she had tucked up her sleeves with a purple sash. The girl frowned as if to say: “I don't like the fish knife used for cutting snakes!” “Don't worry,” her mistress said, “I'll buy you a new one.” This satisfied the girl, and she ran in and quickly brought out the knife.","“Do you have some sort of knife?” he asked. “Run in the kitchen and bring that carving knife,” the woman said to one of the girls who seemed to be the maid. Like the girls from the sewing school, she wore a summer kimono, but her sleeves were tucked up with a purple merino cord. The girl looked hesitantly at her mistress, reluctant, it appeared, to have the knife she customarily used to cut up fish employed for such a purpose. “It’s all right,” the woman added. “I’ll buy you another one to use.”"
「中った」と、石原が云った。そして暫く池の面を見ていて、詞を継いだ。「あの雁は僕が取って来るから、その時は君達も少し手伝ってくれ給え」,"""It was inside,"" said Ishihara. Then I looked at the pond for a while and inherited the lyrics. ""I'll get that goose, so please help me a little at that time.""",“Excellent shot!” Ishihara cried. He looked at the surface of the water for a short time and said: “I'll get it. But help me a little.”,"“You hit it!” Ishihara exclaimed. Then, after studying the surface of the pond for a while, he added. “I can get that goose for you.

家の前にはお玉が立っていた。お玉は窶れていても美しい女であった。しかし若い健康な美人の常として、粧映もした。僕の目には、いつも見た時と、どこがどう変っているか、わからなかったが、とにかくいつもとまるで違った美しさであった。女の顔が照り赫いているようなので、僕は一種の羞明さを感じた。,"A ball stood in front of the house. The ladle was a beautiful woman even though she was in a ladle. However, as usual for young healthy beauty, she also performed cosmetics. In my eyes, I didn't know what was different from what I always saw, but it was a completely different beauty. The woman's face seemed to shine, so I felt a kind of photophobia.","Otama was standing in front of her house. She would have looked beautiful even if she had been ill. But a young, healthy beauty is made even more beautiful by using make-up, and she was just that. I couldn't tell why, but there was a difference from her usual appearance. I thought she was lovelier than ever.","Otama stood in front of the house. Even in ill health she would have been beautiful, but in fact she was young and healthy, and today her usual good looks had been heightened by careful makeup and grooming. To my eyes she seemed to possess a beauty wholly beyond anything I had noted earlier, and her face shone with a kind of radiance. The effect was dazzling."
「変な事を言うなあ。何が分かったのだい」さも意外な事に遭遇したと云うような調子で、声はいたわるように優しい。,"""Don't say weird things. What did you find out?"" The voice was kind to me, as if I had encountered something unexpected.","“You sound so mysterious. What do you know?” he said, like a man who is surprised by the unexpected but who still retains a gentle tone.",“What do you mean? What do you know all about?” His voice was soft and compassionate and he spoke as though in utter surprise.
――――――――――――――――,――――――――――――――――,"By nature Otama was a spirited woman, and in the few months since she had become Suezo's mistress, her painful experience of the outward contempt shown a mistress and the inward envy of the people around her enabled her to set the world at naught.",Otama was a woman of strong spirit.
末造はどうして逢ったか、話でもしたのかと、種々に考えていながら、この場合に根掘り葉掘り問うのは不利だと思って、わざと追窮しない。「別品だって。あんなのが別品と云うのかなあ。妙に顔の平べったいような女だが」,"While thinking about why Suezou met and talked about it, I thought it would be disadvantageous to ask root digging and leaf digging in this case, so I didn't deliberately pursue it. ""It's a different item. I wonder if that's a different item. It's a strangely flat-faced woman.""","All the while Suezo had been wondering how his wife had met his mistress and if they had spoken to each other, but he thought it would look bad for him at present if he asked Otsune any of the details. “A pearl do you call her? Is that the kind of woman you call a pearl? I would think her face was too flat.”","Suezō, wondering how the two women had met and whether they had exchanged any words, sensed that it would not be to his advantage to probe for details. He thus deliberately refrained from further inquiry. “Beauty? You call her a beauty? A woman with a face as flat as that?”"
最初は爺いさんを邪魔にして、苛々したような心持になっていた末造も、次第に感情を融和させられて、全く預想しなかった、しんみりした話をすることになった。そして末造は自分の持っている限のあらゆる善良な性質を表へ出すことを努めながら、心の奥には、おとなしい気立の、お玉に信頼する念を起さしめるには、この上もない、適当な機会が、偶然に生じて来たのを喜んだ。,"At first, Suezou, who had annoyed feelings with his grandfather in the way, gradually reconciled his emotions and decided to tell a mellow story that he never thought of. And while Suezou strives to bring out all the good qualities that he has, in the depths of his heart, he has a gentle spirit and a feeling of trust in the ladle. No, I was pleased that a suitable opportunity came by chance.","Please—on these cushions. ” This done, he called out: “And now for the dishes!” Soon saké and some light refreshments were brought in. As Suezo filled the old man's cup and exchanged a few words with him, he could tell from his manner that he had seen better days and had not simply dressed up for his first visit to a fancy restaurant. At the beginning, Suezo had thought of the old man as a nuisance and was annoyed at having him there, but when he began to talk confidentially, Suezo's attitude softened. He went out of his way to make himself pleasant to the old man and to show the good he had in him. Inwardly Suezo was glad that he had been offered an opportunity to win Otama's trust by treating her father in this way.","Suezō had at first been irritated at the thought of the father’s bothersome presence, but now he began to feel more kindly toward him until at last, contrary to all expectation, the two ended by engaging in convivial conversation. Suezō made every effort to display the best side of his nature, pleased that he should have such an ideal opportunity to instill in the silent, reserved young woman a feeling of confidence in him."
「あら、ひどい方ね」とお玉は云ったが、そのまま髪を撫で附けている。くつろげた領の下に項から背へ掛けて三角形に見える白い肌、手を高く挙げているので、肘の上二三寸の所まで見えるふっくりした臂が、末造のためにはいつまでも厭きない見ものである。そこで自分が黙って待っていたら、お玉が無理に急ぐかも知れぬと思って、わざと気楽げにゆっくりした調子で話し出した。,"""Oh, that's terrible,"" said Odama, but he just stroked his hair. The white skin that looks like a triangle hanging from the head to the back under the relaxed territory, and the hands raised high, the plump 臂 that can be seen up to a few inches above the elbows will never hesitate for the final construction. It is a sight to see. So I thought that if I was waiting silently, the ladle might be forced to hurry, so I deliberately spoke in a relaxed and slow tone.","“Ah? So that's the kind of man you are!” she said, continuing to comb her hair. A triangular patch of white skin revealing her neck and part of her back could be seen above the loosened kimono, and her soft arms, lifted high and exposed a few inches above the elbows, were sights Suezo never tired of. “Don't rush,” he said, fearing his silence would hurry her and making his tone deliberately easy.","“Aren’t you terrible!” she said, but without further comment began arranging her hair. The collar of her robe, tipped back from her neck, showed a triangle of pale skin, and as she raised her arms he could see a few inches of plump upper arm, sights that never failed to delight him. Thinking that if he waited in silence she might feel obliged to hurry, Suezō said in a genial voice, “You don’t have to rush."
「岡田君の外套が一番大きいから、あの下に入れて持って貰うのだ。料理は僕の所でさせる」,"""Okada-kun's cloak is the biggest, so I'll put it under that and bring it with me. I'll let you cook.""",How about Okada's putting it under his cloak? It's bigger than ours. And I'll have the bird cooked at my lodging!”,"“Okada has the biggest cloak, so he can hide it under his cloak. We’ll cook it at my place.”"
そのうち茶が来たので、親子はきのうもおとついも一しょにいたもののように、取留のない話をしていた。爺いさんがふと何か言いにくい事を言うように、こう云った。,"Tea came soon, so the parents and children were talking about things like the day before yesterday and the day before yesterday. As the old man suddenly said something difficult to say, he said this.","Soon the maid brought the tea, and the father and daughter were talking as easily as if they had done the same thing yesterday and the day before.","Soon tea was brought and the two chatted without pause as if they had never been apart. Then the old man suddenly asked in a rather embarrassed tone, “How are things?"
「岡田君。いたのか」,"""Mr. Okada. Was he there?""","I wanted company, so I called out: “Is that you, Okada?”","Feeling somewhat lonely, I immediately called out, “Is that you, Okada?”"
「何が」と口には云ったが、岡田は僕の詞の意味を解していたので、左側の格子戸のある家を見た。,"I said ""what"", but Okada understood the meaning of my words, so I looked at the house with the lattice door on the left side.","he asked, in spite of knowing whom I meant, for he turned to the left side to glance at the house with the lattice door.","“What?” said Okada, though he knew perfectly well what I meant, and turned to look at the house on the left with the lattice door."
「むずかしいなあ。これで好いか」末造は烟を吹きつつ縁側に背中を向けた。そして心中になんと云うあどけない奴だろうと思った。,"""It's difficult. Do you like this?"" Suzo turned his back to the porch while blowing smoke. And I wondered what an innocent guy in my heart.","“My, but you're proper. How's this? All right?” And with his back toward the corridor Suezo smoked his cigarette. “What an innocent thing she is,” he thought.","“How difficult you are! Is this all right?” he asked, turning his back to the verandah and continuing to smoke, amazed at her childishness."
「僕もそう思った。しかしまさか梁山泊の豪傑が店を出したと云うわけでもあるまい」,"""I thought so too. It doesn't mean that the great master of Ryozanpaku opened the store.""","As we talked on in this way and crossed a small bridge leading to the north end of the pond, we saw a young man in student uniform standing at the water's edge and watching something.",“That’s what I was thinking. But it’s probably not quite the sort of pondside tavern where the heroes of The Water Margin used to meet.”

もう上野の山をだいぶはずれた日がくわっと照って、中島の弁天の社を真っ赤に染めているのに、お玉は持って来た、小さい蝙蝠をも挿さずに歩いているのである。,"The day when the mountain of Ueno was far off was shining brightly, and even though the Benten shrine of Nakajima was dyed bright red, the ladle was walking without inserting the small bat that he brought. ..","Already high above Ueno Hill, the sun blazed with its heat and dyed the Benten Shrine on the pond's inner island a deeper red. In spite of the hot glare Otama walked on without opening the small parasol that she carried.","Although the sun, now risen high above Ueno Hill, beat down fiercely, making the vermilion pillars of the Benten Shrine redder than ever, Otama carried her little foreign-style parasol in her hand without troubling to put it up."
「おとなしくして待っているのだよ」と、笑談らしく云って、末造は巻烟草入をしまった。そしてついと立って戸口へ出た。,"""I'm waiting quietly,"" he said with a laugh, and Suzo entered the cigarette. Then I stood up and went out to the door.","“Be a good child and wait for me,” said Suezo humorously, putting his cigarette case in his kimono sleeve. Suddenly he got up and went out to the entrance.","“Wait for me like a good girl,” he said with a laugh and, putting away his cigarette case, got up to leave. “But you haven’t even had a cup of tea!”"
「分かっているでしょう」,"""You know.""",“You know what I mean.”,“As though you didn’t know!”
岡田は窓の女に会釈をするようになってから余程久しくなっても、その女の身の上を探って見ようともしなかった。無論家の様子や、女の身なりで、囲物だろうとは察した。しかし別段それを不快にも思わない。名も知らぬが、強いて知ろうともしない。標札を見たら、名が分かるだろうと思ったこともあるが、窓に女のいる時は女に遠慮をする。そうでない時は近処の人や、往来の人の人目を憚る。とうとう庇の蔭になっている小さい木札に、どんな字が書いてあるか見ずにいたのである。,"Okada didn't even try to find out about the woman in the window, even though it had been a long time since she started giving a bow. Of course, I thought it was an enclosure because of the appearance of the house and the appearance of the woman. But I don't think it's unpleasant. I don't know the name, but I don't even try to know it. I once thought that I would know the name when I saw the nameplate, but when there is a woman in the window, I refrain from doing so. When it isn't, I'm confused by the people in the vicinity and the people who come and go. At last, I didn't see what kind of letters were written on the small wooden tag behind the eaves.","Even though a long interval had passed since Okada started bowing to the woman of the window, he would not investigate her personal history. From the appearance of the house and the way she dressed, he guessed that she might be someone's mistress. But this did not disturb him. He did not even know her name, and he made no effort to learn it. All he had to do was look at the name plate, but he couldn't bring himself to do this in her presence. At other times, when she wasn't there, he hesitated because of the neighbors and the passersby. As a result, he never looked at the characters written on the small wooden sign shadowed by the eaves.","Though considerable time had passed since Okada first began greeting the woman in the window, he had made no attempt to find out anything about her. Needless to say, the appearance of the house and the way the woman dressed strongly suggested that she was someone’s mistress, but that did not particularly bother him. He did not know her name, nor did he make an effort to learn it. It had occurred to him that he could find it out by looking at the nameplate on the house. But he hesitated to do so when the woman was at the window, and even when she was not, he was concerned about what the neighbors or passersby in the street might think. So in the end he never looked to see what name was written on the little wooden plaque that rested in the shadow of the eaves."
無縁坂を降り掛かる時、僕は「おい、いるぜ」と云って、肘で岡田を衝いた。,"When I got off the Muen-zaka, I said ""Hey, I'm here"" and hit Okada with my elbow.","Just as we were about to go down Muenzaka, I nudged Okada, saying: “Look—there she is!” “Who?”","As we started down the Muenzaka slope, I nudged Okada with my elbow. “There she is!” I said."
朝目を醒まして起きずにはいられなかったお玉も、この頃は梅が、「けさは流しに氷が張っています、も少しお休になっていらっしゃいまし」なぞと云うと、つい布団にくるまっている様になった。教育家は妄想を起させぬために青年に床に入ってから寐附かずにいるな、目が醒めてから起きずにいるなと戒める。少壮な身を暖い衾の裡に置けば、毒草の花を火の中に咲かせたような写象が萌すからである。お玉の想像もこんな時には随分放恣になって来ることがある。そう云う時には目に一種の光が生じて、酒に酔ったように瞼から頰に掛け紅が漲るのである。,"The ladle that I couldn't help but wake up in the morning was wrapped in a futon when Ume said, ""Kesa has ice in the sink, but you're a little absent."" It came to be. The educator warns the young man not to stay on the floor after he goes to bed, and not to wake up after he wakes up, in order not to cause delusions. If you put your magnificent body on a warm elephant, you will get a picture of a poisonous flower blooming in the fire. The imagination of a ladle can become quite free at such times. At that time, a kind of light is generated in the eyes, and the red shines from the eyelids to the cheeks as if drunk.","Otama had been in the habit of getting out of bed as soon as her eyes opened in the morning, but when Ume would say: “ The sink's frozen. Stay where you are,” her mistress remained under the covers. As a safeguard against obscene thoughts, educators warn young people not to remain awake after going to bed and to get up as soon as they awaken, for in the vigors of youth kept warm in bed, an image like the flower of a poisonous plant blooming in fire is apt to be engendered. At such times Otama's imagination was unbridled. Her eyes would glow, and the flush would spread from her eyelids to her cheeks as though she had drunk too much saké.","Otama had always been in the habit of getting up as soon as she woke in the morning. But these days, when Ume would call to her, “There’s ice on the wash basin! Why don’t you stay in bed a little longer,” Otama would pull the quilt more tightly around her. When you get in bed go straight to sleep! the pedagogues admonish young people, and get up as soon as you wake! For they know that from youthful bodies lolling in the warmth of covers can spring the flowers of evil fantasy. Lying in bed at such times, Otama would indeed surrender herself to unbridled imaginings; her eyes would take on a special gleam, and a redness as though from wine would spread from her eyelids down over her cheeks."
「好かろう」と云って岡田はすぐに歩き出した。,"Okada immediately started walking, saying, ""Let's like it.""","He agreed, and we started out.","“Fine with me,” Okada agreed and started walking."
櫛をふいていたお玉は「あら」と云って振り返った。顔に不安らしい表情が見えた。,"The ladle that was wiping the comb looked back, saying ""Oh."" I saw an uneasy expression on my face.","“Oh?” said Otama, wiping her comb and looking back at him. She made herself seem sad.","“Oh?” Otama exclaimed, wiping her comb and turning to look at him. Her face wore an uneasy expression."
「ええ」とお玉は云ったぎり、ちょいと返事にまごついた。末造の来るのは折々どころではない。毎晩顔を出さないことはない。これがよめに往ったので、折合が好いかと問われたのなら、大層好いから安心して下さいと、晴れ晴れと返事が出来るのだろう。それがこうした身の上で見れば、どうも檀那が毎晩お出になるとは、気が咎めて言いにくい。お玉は暫く考えて、「まあ、好い工合のようですから、お父っさん、お案じなさらなくっても好ござんすわ」と云った。,"As the ladle said, ""Yes,"" I was a little confused by the reply. It's not always the case that the final product comes. I never miss my face every night. Since this happened to me, if I was asked if I would like to make a deal, I would be able to reply with a clear sunny day, asking me to rest assured that I like it a lot. Looking at it like this, it's hard to say that Danna will come out every night. After thinking about the ladle for a while, he said, ""Well, it looks like a good work, so dad, I don't have to worry about it.""","“Yes—” she said, hesitating, not knowing what to reply. Suezo came not merely “often” but every night. If she had been Suezo's wife and someone had asked her how she was getting on with her husband, she would have said happily: “Wonderfully! Please don't worry about us.” But since she was his mistress, her conscience prevented her from revealing Suezo's nightly appearance. “We're managing,” she said after a pause. “You shouldn't worry about me.","“Yes,” said Otama, and for a moment she seemed unable to answer more. It was not “sometimes” that Suezō came, but every evening without fail. Had she just been married and been asked if she was getting along well with her husband, she might have replied with great cheerfulness that she was doing extremely well. But in her present position the fact that Suezō came every night seemed almost shameful, and she found it difficult to mention. She thought for a moment and then replied, “Things seem to be going all right, Papa. There’s nothing for you to worry about.”"
「どうして取る」と、岡田が問うた。僕も覚えず耳を欹てた。,"""Why do you take it?"" Asked Okada. I didn't even remember, and I listened.","“How can you?” Okada asked. Like him, I was eager to hear the answer.","“How are you going to get it?” Okada asked. Curious to know what he would answer, I listened closely."
僕は人附合いの余り好くない性であったから、学校の構内で好く逢う人にでも、用事がなくては話をしない。同じ下宿屋にいる学生なんぞには、帽を脱いで礼をするようなことも少かった。それが岡田と少し心安くなったのは、古本屋が媒をしたのである。僕の散歩に歩く道筋は、岡田のように極まってはいなかったが、脚が達者で縦横に本郷から下谷、神田を掛けて歩いて、古本屋があれば足を止めて見る。そう云う時に、度々岡田と店先で落ち合う。,"I wasn't very fond of socializing, so I wouldn't talk to people I like on the school campus unless I have something to do. It was rare for students in the same boarding house to take off their hats and thank them. It was a little cheaper than Okada because the second-hand bookstore used it as a medium. The path I took for a walk wasn't as extreme as Okada, but I was a master of legs and walked from Hongo to Shitaya and Kanda, and if there was a second-hand bookstore, I would stop and see. At that time, I often meet Okada at the storefront.","Since I've never been very affable, I didn't even speak to those students I met quite often on the campus except when I had a reason. As for the students in the boarding house, I seldom tipped my cap in greeting. But I became somewhat friendly with Okada because of the bookshops. On my walks I wasn't as rigid in my direction as Okada was, but since I had strong legs, I let them direct me through Hongo to Shitaya and Kanda, and I paused in every second-hand bookstore. On such occasions I often met Okada inside.","By nature I’m not much good at making friends with people. Even people I met all the time at school I seldom spoke to unless there was a specific reason to do so. And among my fellow students at the boardinghouse there were few that I ever doffed my cap to. The fact that I happened to be fairly friendly with Okada was due to our common interest in secondhand bookstores. When I went for a walk I did not follow any fixed route the way Okada did. But since I’m a good walker, I managed to cover pretty much the whole area from Hongō down through Shitaya and Kanda, and whenever I came on a secondhand bookstore I stopped for a look. At such times I frequently ran into Okada, and eventually one or the other of us remarked on how often we bumped into each other at such places."
小僧は一しょに附いて来た女中に、「籠はわたしが持っているから、あの血を掃除しなくちゃ行けませんぜ、畳にも落ちましたからね」と、高慢らしく忠告した。「本当に早く血をふいておしまいよ」と、女主人が云った。女中は格子戸の中へ引き返した。,"The kid proudly advised the maid who accompanied her, ""I have a basket, so I have to clean that blood, because it fell on the tatami mats."" ""Blow the blood really quickly,"" said the mistress. The maid turned back into the lattice door.","“I'm holding the cage, so you've got to wipe up the blood,” the boy said. “It's on the mats too!” he proudly advised the girl, who followed him out. “Oh yes! Do that right away!” said her mistress, and the maid hurried back in.","Addressing the maid in an officious tone, he said, “I’ll take care of the cage. You better go wipe up the blood. Some of it got on the tatami matting too.” “Oh yes, get the blood up as quickly as possible!” added the woman of the house, whereupon the maid disappeared into the house once more."
「あの今晩は檀那様がいらっしゃらないだろうと思うから、お前内へ往って泊って来たけりゃあ泊って来ても好いよ」お玉は重ねてこう云った。,"""I don't think there will be Danna-sama tonight, so if you go inside and stay overnight, it's okay to stay,"" Otama said again.","“Well,” Otama continued, “since your master's not expected this evening, you might as well go and spend the night with your family if you wish.”","“I don’t think the master will come this evening, so you may go home and spend the night if you like,” Otama continued."
石原は素人家の一間を借りていた。主人の婆あさんは、余り人の好くないのが取柄で、獲ものを分けて遣れば、口を噤ませることも出来そうである。その家は湯島切通しから、岩崎邸の裏手へ出る横町で、曲りくねった奥にある。石原はそこへ雁を持ち込む道筋を手短に説明した。先ずここから石原の所へ往くには、由るべき道が二条ある。即ち南から切通しを経る道と、北から無縁坂を経る道とで、この二条は岩崎邸の内に中心を有した圏を画いている。遠近の差は少い。又この場合に問う所でも無い。障礙物は巡査派出所だが、これはどちらにも一箇所ずつある。そこで利害を比較すれば、只振かな切通しを避けて、寂しい無縁坂を取ると云うことに帰着する。雁は岡田に、外套の下に入れて持たせ、跡の二人が左右に並んで、岡田の体を隠蔽して行くが最良の策だと云うのである。,"Ishihara rented a room in an amateur house. My husband's grandmother doesn't like people so much, and if she divides her prey, she seems to be able to make her mouth cry. The house is a side street that goes out from Yushima Kiritsuri to the back of Iwasaki's house, and is in the winding back. Ishihara briefly explained the route to bring the geese there. First of all, there are two ways to get to Ishihara from here. That is, the road that goes through the cut from the south and the road that goes through Muen-zaka from the north, these two articles depict the area with the center in the Iwasaki residence. The difference in perspective is small. Nor is it a question in this case. The disability is a police box, but there is one in each. Therefore, if we compare the interests, we will end up avoiding a simple cut and taking a lonely unrelated slope. It is said that the best way to hide the geese is to have Okada put it under his cloak and hold it under his cloak, and the two tracers line up side by side to hide Okada's body.","He lived in a rented room of a private family. Apparently his landlady's only virtue was her wickedness, and we could stop her from telling what we had done by giving her a piece of the goose. The house was somewhere in the back part of a winding alley. Ishihara briefly explained the course we would take. We could approach his house from two ways. One route lay south through Kiridoshi, the other north through Muenzaka. These two directions formed a circle around the Iwasaki mansion. There was little difference in the distance between them. But that wasn't the present question. It was the police box, and there was one each way. We weighed the advantages and disadvantages, and we concluded that we had better not take the more frequented way through Kiridoshi but the less traveled one through Muenzaka. The best procedure was for Okada to carry the goose under his cloak and for the two of us to flank him and make him look less conspicuous.","Ishihara rented a room in a private house and the landlady, an older woman, had the advantage of being less than exacting in her morals. So if we gave her a portion of our catch, she was unlikely to say anything about where it came from. The house was on a remote, winding alley that led off from Yushima Kiridōshi and came out back of the Iwasaki mansion. Ishihara explained briefly how we could get there with our goose. There were two possible ways to approach the house, a southern route by way of Kiridōshi, and a northern route via Muenzaka, both of them circling around the Iwasaki estate. The distance was approximately the same either way, so that was no consideration. The problem was getting past the police box; there was one of those on either route. Calculating the advantages of each, we decided to avoid the busy Kiridōshi approach and take the much less frequented one via Muenzaka. The best plan seemed to have Okada carry the goose under his cloak, with the two of us flanking him and shielding him from scrutiny."
角を曲れば、茅町の町家と池に沿うた屋敷とが背中合せになった横町で、その頃は両側に荷車や何かが置いてあった。四辻に立っている巡査の姿は、もう角から見えていた。,"Around the corner, there was a Yokomachi where the townhouses of Kayamachi and the mansion along the pond were back to back, and at that time there were carts and something on both sides. The figure of the policeman standing in Yotsuji was already visible from the corner.","We were approaching the corner to go to Muenzaka. As we turned up the slope, we saw a policeman standing at the crossing.",From the corner we could see the policeman standing at the intersection.
朝の食事の跡始末をして置いて、お常が買物に出掛ける時、末造は烟草を呑みつつ新聞を読んでいたが、帰って見れば、もう留守になっていた。若し内にいたら、なんと云って好いかは知らぬが、とにかく打っ附かって、むしゃぶり附いて、なんとでも云って遣りたいような心持で帰ったお常は拍子抜けがした。午食の支度もしなくてはならない。もう間もなく入用になる子供の袷の縫い掛けてあるのも縫わなくてはならない。お常は器械的に、いつものように働いているうちに、夫に打っ附かろうと思った鋭鋒は次第に挫けて来た。これまでもひどい勢で、石垣に頭を打ち附ける積りで、夫に衝突したことは、度々ある。しかしいつも頭にあらがう筈の石垣が、腕を避ける暖簾であるのに驚かされる。そして夫が滑かな舌で、道理らしい事を言うのを聞いていると、いつかその道理に服するのではなくて、只何がなしに萎やされてしまうのである。きょうはなんだか、その第一の襲撃も旨く出来そうには思われなくなって来る。お常は子供を相手に午食を食べる。喧嘩をする子供の裁判をする。袷を縫う。又夕食の支度をする。子供に行水を遣わせて、自分も使う。蚊遣をしながら夕食を食べる。食後に遊びに出た子供が遊び草臥れて帰る。女中が勝手から出て来て、極まった所に床を取ったり、蚊帳を弔ったりする。手水をさせて子供を寝かす。夫の夕食の膳に蝿除を被せて、火鉢に鉄瓶を掛けて、次の間に置く。夫が夕食に帰らなかった時は、いつでもこうして置くのである。,"When he went shopping after cleaning up his morning meal, Suezou was reading the newspaper while drinking a cigarette, but when he returned home, he was already away. I don't know what to say if I was inside, but anyway, I was struck, sucked, and returned with the feeling that I wanted to do anything. I also have to prepare for lunch. I have to sew the sewn awase of the child who will be needed soon. Usually, while working mechanically as usual, the sharp sword that I wanted to hit my husband gradually broke down. I have often collided with my husband with a terrible force, hitting my head against the stone wall. However, I am surprised that the stone wall, which should always come up in my head, is a goodwill that avoids my arms. And when I hear my husband say something that makes sense with his smooth tongue, one day he will not be subject to that reason, but will be withered without any help. Somehow, it seems unlikely that the first attack will be successful today. I usually eat lunch with my children. Trial a quarreling child. Sew the awase. Also prepare for dinner. Have your child water the water and use it yourself. Eat dinner while mosquitoes. A child who goes out to play after a meal lays down and goes home. The maid comes out on her own, takes the floor to the extreme, and mourns the mosquito net. Let the water flow and put the child to sleep. Cover the dinner table of my husband with a fly, hang an iron kettle on the brazier, and put it in the next room. Whenever my husband doesn't go home for dinner, he puts it this way.","SUEZO had been at home reading his newspaper and smoking when Otsune went out shopping after clearing away the breakfast things, but when she returned, he was no longer there. This disappointed her, for on entering the house she had thought feverishly that if he were there, she would rush against him, and even though she couldn't speak to him, she would hold him somehow or other and strike with whatever words came into her mind. But she had lunch to prepare and autumn kimonos to finish for the children. She mechanically went about these daily tasks, and eventually her wish to attack her husband subsided. How often she had challenged him violently! She was even prepared to crack her head against a stone wall if necessary, but when she attacked him, instead of the stone wall of resistance she expected, she found, to her surprise, a curtain that destroyed her energy. She would listen to her husband's sly reasoning stated with confidence, and then she would lose her resolution in spite of feeling that she hadn't been persuaded by him in the least. If she attacked him at such a time, she couldn't be certain that her first try would be successful. She ate lunch with her children, settled a quarrel between them, sewed their clothes, prepared supper, gave them a bath, took one herself, and ate her dinner next to the burning mosquito smudge. After they had eaten, the children played themselves into tiredness outdoors. The maid finished her duties in the kitchen, laid out the beds, each in its appointed place, and hung the mosquito net. Otsune sent the children in to wash their hands and then to bed, spread a fly net over her husband's supper on his small table, and put a kettle on the fire in the charcoal brazier in the room next to the bedroom. This was the procedure she followed when Suezo did not return at night.","When Otsune, having cleared away the breakfast things, went out shopping in the early morning, she had left Suezō smoking and reading the newspaper. But when she returned, she found him gone. She had come home determined that, if he was still there, she would thrash things out with him. She wasn’t sure just what she would say, but she fully intended to face up to him this time and speak out. His absence thus left her feeling flat. But there was lunch to prepare, and the lined kimonos that the children would soon be needing for the cooler weather. And as she went about these activities in a mechanical manner, the fury with which she had meant to confront her husband gradually abated. More than once in the past she had rushed at him, determined if need be to dash her head against the stone wall of his resistance, only to find to her surprise that he offered little or no resistance at all. Instead he would begin in his glib way expounding on the whys and wherefores of the situation until, though not really convinced by his reasons, she would find herself somehow talked into meek submission. And she was not at all sure that the attack she had planned to launch today would fare any better than had those earlier ones. Otsune ate lunch with the children, intervened in their squabbles, stitched together their fall kimonos, and got their supper ready. Pouring water in a tin tub, she gave them a simple bath and took one herself. Then, lighting a smudge coil to keep off the mosquitoes, she ate supper with them. When they returned from their after-supper play, the maid, finished in the kitchen, spread the sleeping mats in the usual places and put up the mosquito net, after which Otsune, having supervised a final washup, put the children to bed. Then she arranged her husband’s supper on a tray, covered it with a net to keep off the flies, and, putting a kettle on the charcoal brazier so he would have hot water, placed these things in the next room. This was what she always did when he was late coming home."
「そんなら極まった人ですね」,"""That's the ultimate person.""","“Then there's only one deceiver,” said Suezo.",“You mean it’s just one person?”
或る日の朝お貞が裏口から、前日にお玉の遣った何やらの礼を言いに来た。暫く立話をしているうちに、お貞が「あなた岡田さんがお近づきですね」と云った。,"One morning, Sada came from the back door to say thank you for what the ladle sent the day before. After talking for a while, Sada said, ""You, Mr. Okada, are approaching.""","One morning Otei came to the back door to thank Otama for what she had sent over the day before. In the course of their talk while Otei stood at the door, the woman said to Otama: “I believe you know Okada-san, isn't that so?”","One morning Otei appeared at Otama’s kitchen door to thank her for something that Otama had sent her the day before. As the two women stood chatting a while, Otei remarked, “I see you’ve gotten to know Mr. Okada.”"

「さあ僕もそろそろお暇をしましょう」と云って、岡田があたりを見廻した。,"Okada looked around, saying, ""Now, let's have some free time.""","“Well,” said Okada, looking around, “I'd better go too.”","Okada glanced around. “I guess I’ll be going too,” he said."

壱,one,Chapter One,One
三日四日となった頃には、次第に気が苛々して来て、女中の傍へ来て何かするのが気に障る。もう何十年か奉公人を使ったことがないのに、原来優しい性分だから、小言は言わない。只女中のする事が一々自分の意志に合わぬので、不平でならない。起居のおとなしい、何をしても物に柔に当るお玉と比べて見られるのだから、田舎から出たばかりの女中こそ好い迷惑である。とうとう四日目の朝飯の給事をさせている時、汁椀の中へ栂指を突っ込んだのを見て、「もう給仕はしなくても好いから、あっちへ行っていておくれ」と云ってしまった。,"By the time it was three or four days, I was getting more and more annoyed, and it was annoying to come to the side of the maid and do something. I haven't used a servant for decades, but I don't say a small word because it's a gentle nature. I don't complain because what the maid does doesn't suit her will. A maid who has just come out of the countryside is a good nuisance because it can be seen compared to a ladle that is quiet when you move up and hits things softly no matter what you do. When I was finally serving breakfast on the fourth day, I saw a hemlock finger stuck in a bowl and said, ""I don't need to serve anymore, so go over there."" I have.","With each passing day he became increasingly irritable. He began to find fault with the maid when she brought him his meals. He had not had a servant for many years, and since he was a tender-hearted man, he refrained from scolding her. But he was uneasy in her presence, for no matter what she did, it went against him. To do justice to the girl—just up to Tokyo from the country—it was unfortunate for her to be compared with Otama, who bore herself so well and did everything gently and quietly. Finally, on the fourth day after moving to his new house, he was shocked to find that the maid had her thumb in his soup as she brought it to him at breakfast. “No more serving me! Go away!”","By the third or fourth day he began to feel increasingly irritable; it particularly annoyed him when the maid puttered around by his side. It had been many years since he had had a servant of any kind, and being very mild-natured , he was not inclined to scold her. Yet everything she did seemed to conflict with his own way of doing things, and this put him in an irritable mood. No doubt it was because he compared her with Otama, who moved gracefully and went about everything in a quiet, unobtrusive manner. Viewed in such a light the maid, fresh from the country, made a poor showing indeed. Finally on the fourth day, when she brought him his breakfast, she managed to stick her thumb in the miso soup as she was handing it to him. “Never mind serving the food!” he said. “Just go in the other room!”"
「その話はもうよしてくれ給え。君にだけは顚末を打ち明けて話してあるのだから、この上僕をいじめなくても好いじゃないか」,"""Give me that story already. I'm just telling you the story, so don't you want to bully me anymore?""","“That's enough about her! Since you're the only person I confided in about how I got to know her, you shouldn't tease me.”",I’ve told that story to. You can leave off joking about it from now on.”
「僕はこの辺をぶらついている。君達はどこへでも往って来給え。三人ここにいると目立つから」,"""I'm wandering around here. You guys come and go everywhere, because three people stand out here.""","“I'll wander around here. You two go wherever you wish. If all three of us stay, it'll attract attention.”",“I’ll hang around here. But you two better go somewhere else. Three people together here would be too conspicuous.”
その頃まだ珍らしい見物になっていた眼鏡橋の袂を、柳原の方へ向いてぶらぶら歩いて行く。川岸の柳の下に大きい傘を張って、その下で十二三の娘にかっぽれを踊らせている男がある。その周囲にはいつものように人が集まって見ている。末造がちょいと足を駐めて踊を見ていると、印半纏を着た男が打っ附かりそうにして、避けて行った。目ざとく振り返った末造と、その男は目を見合せて直ぐに背中を向けて通り過ぎた。「なんだ、目先の見えねえ」とつぶやきながら、末造は袖に入れていた手で懐中を捜った。無論何も取られてはいなかった。この攫徒は実際目先が見えぬのであった。なぜと云うに、末造は夫婦喧嘩をした日には、神経が緊張していて、不断気の附かぬ程の事にも気が附く。鋭敏な感覚が一層鋭敏になっている。攫徒の方ですろうと云う意志が生ずるに先だって、末造はそれを感ずる位である。こんな時には自己を抑制することの出来るのを誇っている末造も、多少その抑制力が弛んでいる。しかし大抵の人にはそれが分からない。若し非常に感覚の鋭敏な人がいて、細かに末造を観察したら、彼が常より稍能弁になっているのに気が附くだろう。そして彼の人の世話を焼いたり、人に親切らしい事を言ったりする言語挙動の間に、どこか慌ただしいような、稍不自然な処のあるのを認めるだろう。,"At that time, I walked around the Meganebashi Bridge, which was still a rare sight, toward Yanagihara. There is a man who puts a big umbrella under a willow on the riverbank and makes his twelve daughters dance a kappore under it. People gather around it as usual. When Suezou parked his feet and watched the dance, a man wearing a hanten was about to hit him and avoided it. After looking back, the man looked at him and immediately turned his back and passed by. While muttering, ""What, I can't see the immediate future,"" Suezou searched for his pocket with his hand in his sleeve. Of course nothing was taken. This kid was actually blind. After all, on the day when Suezou had a quarrel with his wife, he was nervous and noticed that he couldn't keep up. The sensitive sensation is becoming more sensitive. Suezou feels it before the will to be a kidnapper arises. At times like this, Suezo, who is proud of being able to restrain himself, has a little loose restraint. But most people don't know that. If you have a very sensitive person and you observe the final product in detail, you will notice that he is more proficient than usual. And you will admit that there is something hectic and unnatural between the language behaviors of taking care of him and saying kind things to others.","The Megane-bashi was a new bridge at that time, and Suezo walked along towards Yanagihara after crossing it. Suddenly he saw a man and a girl of twelve or thirteen at their customary places under a large parasol that had been planted in the soil by a willow tree near the river. The girl was doing a folk dance, and, as usual, a number of spectators were there. When Suezo stopped for a few minutes to watch, a man almost ran into him. Suezo's eyes detected the stranger quickly, and as Suezo turned back and met his gaze, the pickpocket hurried away. “What professional stupidity!” Suezo muttered to himself, at the same time feeling under his kimono to see if his wallet were still safe. The thief must have been an ignorant fellow, for when Suezo had had a quarrel with his wife, his nerves were so tense that he noticed things he wouldn't usually have seen. His natural sensitiveness was made the keener, so that a pickpocket could hardly conceive of robbing him before Suezo sensed his intention. But on such occasions his power of controlling himself—in which he took great pride—was lax to a slight degree, though so slight that ordinary people would not have noticed. A very sensitive observer might have discovered that Suezo was a little more talkative than usual and that there was something restless and unnatural about him as he spoke and behaved in an officiously kind manner.","When he arrived at Megane Bridge, at that time still a new sight in the city, he turned in the direction of Yanagihara. Strolling along the riverbank, he arrived at a spot where a large umbrella had been set up under the willows. A man stood by the umbrella supervising, while a little girl of twelve or thirteen performed the then highly popular comic dance known as kappore. As usual, a crowd had gathered around to watch. Suezō halted for a moment to observe the performance when a man in a workman’s coat seemed about to bump right into him but then suddenly stepped aside. Suezō turned and eyed him suspiciously. For a moment their eyes met, and then the man quickly turned his back and scurried off. “Watch out who you try that trick on!” Suezō muttered as he felt inside the breast of his kimono where he kept his wallet. Needless to say, it had not been taken. But the pickpocket should have known better than to think of such a thing. For on the days when Suezō had fought with his wife, his nerves were tense, his senses keener than ever, and he noticed many things he ordinarily might not have. Even before the pickpocket had made up his mind to try something, Suezō would have guessed what he was up to. Suezō was proud of his powers of self-control, though at times such as this these powers were somewhat weakened. Most people would not be aware of the fact, though someone of unusually keen sensitivity might observe that Suezō was at these times a bit more glib-tongued than usual. As he went about waiting on others and addressing them with exaggerated politeness, one might detect a certain unnaturalness and perturbation in his words and actions."
「おや。御免なさいましよ。大そうお早いじゃございませんか」銜えていた楊枝を急いで出して、唾をバケツの中に吐いてこう云ったお玉の、少しのぼせたような笑顔が、末造の目にはこれまでになく美しく見えた。一体お玉は無縁坂に越して来てから、一日一日と美しくなるばかりである。最初は娘らしい可哀さが気に入っていたのだが、この頃はそれが一種の人を魅するような態度に変じて来た。末造はこの変化を見て、お玉に情愛が分かって来たのだ、自分が分からせて遣ったのだと思って、得意になっている。しかしこれは何事をも鋭く看破する末造の目が、笑止にも愛する女の精神状態を錯り認めているのである。お玉は最初主人大事に奉公をする女であったのが、急劇な身の上の変化のために、煩悶して見たり省察して見たりした挙句、横着と云っても好いような自覚に到達して、世間の女が多くの男に触れた後に纔かに贏ち得る冷静な心と同じような心になった。この心に翻弄せられるのを、末造は愉快な刺戟として感ずるのである。それにお玉は横着になると共に、次第に少しずつじだらくになる。末造はこのじだらくに情慾を煽られて、一層お玉に引き附けられるように感ずる。この一切の変化が末造には分からない。魅せられるような感じはそこから生れるのである。,"""Oh, I'm sorry. It's too early, isn't it?"" It looked more beautiful to the eyes than ever before. The ladle has only become beautiful day by day since it came to Muenzaka. At first I liked the pity of my daughter, but by this time it turned into a kind of fascinating attitude. Seeing this change, Suezou is good at thinking that the ladle has come to understand his affection, and that he has sent it to him. However, this is because the eyes of Suzo, who sharply detect everything, confuse the mental state of a woman who loves to stop laughing. At first, Odama was a woman who was a servant of her husband, but due to a sudden change in her personality, she was annoyed and looked back, and after all, she reached the consciousness that it was a good idea to wear a ladle. Then, after a woman in the world touched many men, she became a heart similar to the calm heart that she could earnestly redeem. Suzo feels at the mercy of this heart as a pleasant stimulus. Besides, the ladle becomes a horizontal garment and gradually becomes sloppy. Suezou feels that he is even more attracted to the ladle because of his emotions. All this change is unknown to Suezou. The fascinating feeling comes from it.","“Oh! Excuse me,” Otama said, hastily taking the toothbrush from her mouth. “You've come awfully early.” To Suezo's eyes, her smiling face, flushed somewhat as though the blood had rushed to her head, was lovelier than ever. Since coming to live at Muenzaka, she had become prettier by the day. At first Suezo admired the maiden-like naïveté of her manners. But lately they had changed, and he was even more enchanted. He saw this transformation as evidence of her understanding of love, and he was proud that she had learned what it was from him. In spite of his insight into reality, this was a ridiculous misunderstanding of his mistress' state of mind. At first she had served him faithfully, but as a result of her unhappiness and the reflectiveness caused by the sudden changes in her life, she had arrived at a self-consciousness which might almost be called impudent negligence. She had acquired that coolness of mind that most women in the world who do have it can reach only after experiences with many men. Suezo found it stimulating to be trifled with by her coolness. She had begun to neglect her duties with an increasing disregard for them, and she had become less tidy. But this untidiness fanned Suezo's passions to a higher intensity. He did not realize the basis for these alterations, so he was more charmed than before.","“Excuse me a moment, will you? I had no idea you would be coming so early!” said Otama, hastily putting down her toothbrush and emptying her mouth into the wash basin. Her confused, smiling face seemed to Suezō more beautiful than ever. Indeed she had grown lovelier each day since she had moved to Muenzaka. The girlish charm that had first attracted him had these days given way to an air of enchanting maturity. The change, mused Suezō with pride, sprang from her new understanding of love, the understanding that he himself had taught her. But Suezō’s penetrating eyes had in this case woefully misread the facts. Otama had at first served her patron faithfully and wholeheartedly. But with the rapid changes in her way of life, the anxieties and periods of deep reflection, she had learned at last a kind of artfulness; there was in her heart now something like the hard-won dispassionate coldness of a woman who has known many men. And as she became more cunning in her heart, she grew more careless in her ways, and this very carelessness acted on Suezō as a delightful stimulus, spurring his passion to greater intensity. Though he did not correctly divine the causes for the change, he responded warmly to the new attraction that it brought."
お玉はまだ岡田と云う名を知らない。それでいて、お師匠さんの云うのはあの学生さんの事だと云うこと、こう聞かれるのは自分に辞儀をした所を見られたのだと云うこと、この場合では厭でも知った振をしなくてはならぬと云うことなどが、稲妻のように心頭を掠めて過ぎた。そして遅疑した跡をお貞が認め得ぬ程速かに、「ええ」と答えた。,"Ladle does not yet know the name Okada. Even so, the teacher said that he was the student, and that he was asked that he was able to see where he bowed. In this case, he pretended to know. The fact that it was necessary was too much to bow like a lightning bolt. And he answered ""yes"" so quickly that his father couldn't admit the trace of his suspicion.","Otama had never heard the name before, yet it flashed through her mind that the sewing teacher had referred to the student, that she had seen Okada greeting her, and that the situation compelled her to pretend she knew him. After a brief hesitation that was not perceptible to the other woman, Otama readily answered: “Yes, I do.”","As the two women stood chatting a while, Otei remarked, “I see you’ve gotten to know Mr. Okada.” Otama did not as yet know his name, but it flashed through her mind that Otei must be referring to the student who passed by, that she had perhaps seen him greeting her, and that in such a situation, much as she hated to dissemble, she had no choice but to pretend she knew him. So, before Otei could notice her confusion, she replied, “Yes.” “Such a fine-looking young man."
この散歩の途中で、岡田が何をするかと云うと、ちょいちょい古本屋の店を覗いて歩く位のものであった。上野広小路と仲町との古本屋は、その頃のが今も二三軒残っている。お成道にも当時そのままの店がある。柳原のは全く廃絶してしまった。本郷通のは殆ど皆場所も持主も代っている。岡田が赤門から出て右へ曲ることのめったにないのは、一体森川町は町幅も狭く、窮屈な処であったからでもあるが、当時古本屋が西側に一軒しかなかったのも一つの理由であった。,"What Okada would do during this walk was to take a peek at a second-hand bookstore. There are still a few used bookstores between Ueno Hirokoji and Nakamachi at that time. There is a store in Onari-do as it was at that time. Yanagihara's has been completely abolished. Almost everyone in Hongodori has changed places and owners. Okada rarely leaves the Akamon and turns to the right because Morikawa-cho was a narrow town and a cramped place, but one reason was that there was only one second-hand bookstore on the west side at that time. there were.","On these trips Okada did little more than browse now and then in the second-hand bookstores. Today only two or three out of many still remain. On Onarimichi, the same shops, little changed from what they formerly were, continue to run their businesses. Yet almost all the stores on Hongo-dori have changed their locations and their proprietors. On these walks Okada hardly ever turned right after leaving the Red Gate because most of the streets narrowed so much that it was annoying. Besides, only one second-hand bookshop could then be found along that way.","Okada seldom stopped on his walks except to browse occasionally at secondhand bookstores along the way. Two or three of the secondhand bookstores in business at that time in Ueno Hirokōji and Nakachō still exist, and in Onarimichi too there are some from that period, though those in Yanagihara have all disappeared. The ones along Hongō Street have nearly all changed location and owners. The reason Okada never turned right when he emerged from the Red Gate was that the streets in Morikawachō, which lies in that direction, are rather narrow and unpleasant to walk along, but also because at that time there was only one secondhand bookstore in that direction."
「結構です」と岡田が云った。,"""It's fine,"" Okada said.","“All right,” said Okada.","she asked. “Fine,” said Okada."
時候が次第に寒くなって、お玉の家の流しの前に、下駄で踏む処だけ板が土に塡めてある、その板の上には朝霜が真っ白に置く。深い井戸の長い弔瓶縄が冷たいから、梅に気の毒だと云って、お玉は手袋を買って遣ったが、それを一々嵌めたり脱いだりして、台所の用が出来るものでは無いと思った梅は、貰った手袋を大切にしまって置いて、矢張素手で水を汲む。洗物をさせるにも、雑巾掛をさせるにも、湯を涌かして使わせるのに、梅の手がそろそろ荒れて来る。お玉はそれを気にして、こんな事を言った。「なんでも手を濡らした跡をそのままにして置くのが悪いのだよ。水から手を出したら、すぐに好く拭いて乾かしてお置。用が片附いたら、忘れないでシャボンで手を洗うのだよ」こう云ってシャボンまで買って渡した。それでも梅の手が次第に荒れるのを、お玉は気の毒がっている。そしてあの位の事は自分もしたが、梅のように手の荒れたことは無かったのにと、不思議にも思うのである。,"The weather is getting colder, and in front of the ladle house, there is a board on the soil only where you step on it with clogs, and the morning frost is placed on the board in pure white. The long condolence rope in the deep well was cold, so I felt sorry for the plums, so I bought a pair of gloves, but I thought that I couldn't use them in the kitchen by putting them on and taking them off one by one. For plums, cherish the gloves you received and put them down, and draw water with Yahari's bare hands. Plum's hands are getting rough, whether it's for washing, for rags, or for using hot water. The ladle was concerned about it and said something like this. ""It's a bad idea to leave your hands wet. When you get your hands out of the water, wipe them dry and leave them dry. Don't forget to use soap to clean your hands. I'm going to wash it. "" Still, the ladle feels sorry for the gradual roughening of Ume's hands. And I did that much, but I wonder why it wasn't as rough as plum blossoms.","IT WAS getting colder, and the boards outside the wooden drain from the sink were covered with a thick frost. Otama pitied Ume for having to draw water from the deep well with a long rope, and she bought the girl a pair of gloves. But Ume, who thought it too troublesome for her to put them on and take them off in doing kitchen work, guarded the gloves as a precious gift and still labored at the well with her bare hands. Otama would say: “Use hot water for washing clothes and for wiping the floors.” But Ume's hands still got rough and chapped. Otama said, sympathizing with her: “The worst thing's to keep your hands wet. Wipe them carefully and dry them each time you take them out of water.” She bought Ume a cake of soap for the purpose. But the girl's hands became rougher, and it pained Otama to see them in that condition. “Why do her hands get so red and cracked?” she wondered to herself. “I did as much work as she does now and mine weren't like that.”","The weather turned colder and in the mornings the planks that covered the drain from Otama ’s house were white with frost. The long rope that hauled up water from the well was icy, and Otama, feeling sorry for Ume, bought her a pair of work gloves to wear. But Ume, thinking she could never carry out her kitchen chores if she was forever putting them on and taking them off, instead stored them away carefully and went on drawing water with her bare hands. When there was laundry to do or mopping with a wet rag, Otama heated water for Ume to use, but bit by bit Ume’s hands grew red and chapped. This troubled Otama. “ Whenever you’ve had your hands in water, you mustn’t leave them wet,” she said. “Be sure to dry them right away. And when you’ve finished what you’re doing, don’t forget to wash them with soap,” she added, giving the maid a cake of soap she had bought. But still, to Otama’s distress, Ume’s hands continued to get redder and rougher. In the past Otama had done the same sort of work herself, and she wondered why her hands had never gotten chapped like Ume’s."
「それでもなんだかお気の毒様で」,"""Still, I feel sorry for you.""",“But I feel so sorry—”,"“Still, it’s too bad—”"
「どうせ僕は岡田君のようなわけには行かないさ」と先を越して云う学生がある。此の如くにして岡田はいつとなく上条の標準的下宿人になったのである。,"There is a student who goes ahead and says, ""I can't go like Okada anyway."" In this way, Okada somehow became the standard boarder of Kamijou.","But, anticipating her words, some of the students would say: “Well, we can't all be like him.” Before anyone realized it, Okada had become a model tenant.","To which some of the other student lodgers, anticipating invidious comparison, would retort, “We can’t all be like Okada!” Thus, before we knew it, Okada had become the standard by which the Kamijō’s residents were measured."
「狂言より話が少し真面目にして貰いたいなあ。一体その蝙蝠てえのはなんだい」,"""I want you to take the story a little more seriously than Kyogen. What the hell is that bat?""",“Can't you talk about something more serious than a play? What do you mean by parasols?”,“Now let’s stop the fooling and talk reasonably. What’s this about parasols?”
とうとう一週間立っても、まだ娘は来なかった。恋しい、恋しいと思う念が、内攻するように奥深く潜んで、あいつ楽な身の上になって、親の事を忘れたのではあるまいかと云う疑が頭を擡げて来る。この疑は仮に故意に起して見て、それを弄んでいるとでも云うべき、極めて淡いもので、疑いは疑いながら、どうも娘を憎く思われない。丁度人に対して物を言う時に用いる反語のように、いっそ娘が憎くなったら好かろうと、心の上辺で思って見るに過ぎない。,"Even after standing for a week, my daughter hasn't come yet. The feelings of being missed and missed lurked deeply as if to attack, and the suspicion that he might have forgotten about his parents came to his mind. This suspicion is extremely faint, and it should be said that he is deliberately raising it and playing with it. Although he doubts the suspicion, he does not seem to hate his daughter. Just like the irony used when talking to people, I just think at the top of my heart that I would like it if my daughter hates me.","A week passed, and still Otama had not come. He was annoyed at himself for wanting to see her so badly, and he wondered: “Has she forgotten me? She's comfortable now. Why not?” These suspicions were so faint that he alone could have brought them about and played with them in his own mind. Suspicions they were, and yet not such as to make him hate her. But superficially at least, with the irony that one often uses in conversation, he murmured: “I'd be happier if I could.”","Soon a whole week had passed and Otama had yet to visit him. He could not help longing for her, but he suppressed such thoughts, pushing them deep down inside him; instead he began speculating whether, now that she was comfortably provided for, she hadn’t perhaps forgotten all about her father. To be sure, such conjectures were highly superficial, as though he had deliberately conjured them up merely to have something to occupy his thoughts. Yet he continued to entertain them, though he could never go so far as to be actually angry with his daughter. When speaking to others, we will sometimes say the direct opposite of what we really feel."
岡田に蛇を殺して貰った日の事である。お玉はこれまで目で会釈をした事しか無い岡田と親しく話をした為めに、自分の心持が、我ながら驚く程急劇に変化して来たのを感じた。女には欲しいとは思いつつも買おうとまでは思わぬ品物がある。そう云う時計だとか指環だとかが、硝子窓の裏に飾ってある店を、女はそこを通る度に覗いて行く。わざわざその店の前に往こうとまではしない。何か外の用事でそこの前を通り過ぎることになると、きっと覗いて見るのである。欲しいと云う望みと、それを買うことは所詮企て及ばぬと云う諦めとが一つになって、或る痛切で無い、微かな、甘い哀傷的情緒が生じている。女はそれを味うことを楽みにしている。それとは違って、女が買おうと思う品物はその女に強烈な苦痛を感ぜさせる。女は落ち着いていられぬ程その品物に悩まされる。縦い幾日か待てば容易く手に入ると知っても、それを待つ余裕が無い。女は暑さをも寒さをも夜闇をも雨雪をも厭わずに、衝動的に思い立って、それを買いに往くことがある。万引なんと云うことをする女も、別に変った木で刻まれたものでは無い。只この欲しい物と買いたい物との境界がぼやけてしまった女たるに過ぎない。岡田はお玉のためには、これまで只欲しい物であったが、今や忽ち変じて買いたい物になったのである。,"It was the day when Okada killed the snake. Odama talked closely with Okada, who had only given a bow with his eyes, so I felt that my feelings had changed into a surprisingly sudden drama. There are items that women want but don't even want to buy. Every time a woman passes through a store that has such a clock or ring on the back of a glass window, she looks into it. I don't bother to go to the store. If you pass in front of it for some outside errand, you will surely take a peek. The desire to want and the resignation that buying it is unsuccessful have come together to create a certain, painless, subtle, sweet and sorrowful feeling. The woman is looking forward to tasting it. On the contrary, the goods that a woman wants to buy make her feel intense pain. The woman is so annoyed by the item that she cannot be calm. Even if you know that you can easily get it if you wait a few days vertically, you can't afford to wait for it. A woman may be impulsive and go out to buy it, regardless of the heat, the cold, the darkness, or the rain and snow. The woman who shoplifts is not carved with a strange tree. It's just a woman whose boundary between what she wants and what she wants to buy has become blurred. Okada used to be what he wanted for Otama, but now he has changed and wants to buy it.","ON THE day that Okada killed the snake, a sudden change took place in Otama after she had spoken to him, for up to that time they had only looked at one another. A woman may have her heart set on a particular article, yet she may not go so far as to think of buying it. Each time she passes it, she may stop and look into the window where the article, say a ring or a watch, is on display. She doesn't go to that shop deliberately, but whenever she happens to be in the neighborhood on some business or other, she always makes it a point to examine it. Though she recognizes that she will never be able to buy the article, the renunciation and the desire to have if often give rise to a not too keen but rather faint and sweetly sad emotion. And she enjoys feeling it. On the other hand, a particular item she can afford and has determined to buy gives her acute pain. It troubles her so much that she gets restless. Even when she knows she can own it in a few days, she can hardly wait for the moment of possession. Occasionally she will even go out to get it on impulse—this in spite of heat or cold, darkness, rain, or snow. The woman who steals articles in a shop is not carved out of a different wood. But there is a distinction. A shoplifter blurs the line between the expensive items she yearns for and can't buy and articles she can buy if she has the money. Otama's longing for Okada had been like that of a woman for an expensive article she admired from a distance, but he now turned into an article she wanted to buy.","It was the day Okada killed the snake for her. Otama, who until then had exchanged only glances and nods with the student, felt, after their intimate encounter over the snake, a dramatic change in her emotions, one that surprised even her. For all women, there are things they regard as desirable but which they do not feel compelled to purchase. Such objects—a watch, a ring, displayed in the window of a store—they will invariably stop to look at as they pass. They do not go purposely to the store to see them, but, happening along on some other errand, they will nevertheless pause for a moment of inspection. Their desire to possess the object, and their resignation to the fact that they can never afford to do so, combine to produce not distress but rather a subtle, sweet sensation of grief that women look on as a kind of joy. The situation is quite different, however, when a woman makes up her mind to possess a thing. The emotion then is one of intense anguish. She thinks of the object until she can think of nothing else. Even if she learned that in a few days it would come easily into her hands, she could not bear to wait. Heedless of heat or cold, darkness or storm, she will lay her impulsive plans for the acquisition. Those women who in such cases resort to shoplifting are not necessarily cut from a different cloth; they are merely a little hazy as to where one draws the line between ability to purchase and desire for possession. For Otama, the student Okada had until now been no more than an object of vague desire, but suddenly she realized that she wanted him for her own."
「先ず僕の為事はこの位でおしまいでしょうね」と云って、岡田は戸口を出た。,"Okada left the door, saying, ""First of all, my affairs will be over at this level.""","“Well,” said Okada, going out the entrance, “I guess there's nothing more for me to do.”","“Well, I guess that about finishes my work,” he said, stepping out the door."
末造が来ていても、箱火鉢を中に置いて、向き合って話をしている間に、これが岡田さんだったらと思う。最初はそう思う度に、自分で自分の横着を責めていたが、次第に平気で岡田の事ばかり思いつつも、話の調子を合せているようになった。それから末造の自由になっていて、目を瞑って岡田の事を思うようになった。折々は夢の中で岡田と一しょになる。煩わしい順序も運びもなく一しょになる。そして「ああ、嬉しい」と思うとたんに、相手が岡田ではなくて末造になっている。はっと驚いて目を醒まして、それから神経が興奮して寐られぬので、じれて泣くこともある。,"I wish this was Mr. Okada while I was talking face-to-face with the brazier inside, even if the end of the work was coming. At first, every time I thought so, I blamed myself for my side clothes, but gradually I started to think about Okada, but I started to adjust the tone of the story. After that, I was free to make things, and I closed my eyes and started thinking about Okada. Occasionally I become one with Okada in my dreams. It becomes one without troublesome order and transportation. And as soon as I thought, ""Oh, I'm happy,"" the other party isn't Okada, but a sequel. I was surprised and awakened, and then my nerves were so excited that I couldn't cry.","When Suezo came and talked with her over the charcoal brazier, she imagined what it would be like if Okada were there instead. At first, she felt she was being unfaithful, but she gradually came to feel no shame in speaking in tune with Suezo's words while thinking of Okada all the time. Moreover, when she submitted to Suezo, the image of Okada was behind her closed eyes. Sometimes they were together in her dreams. He was there without any troublesome arrangements to be made. But the moment she thought how happy she was, the man turned into Suezo instead of Okada. She would be startled and would awake, her nerves so strained that sometimes she cried out in a fret.","and they sat chatting on opposite sides of the brazier, she would think to herself, If only this were Mr. Okada! The first time she caught herself doing this, she was shocked by her own duplicity. But gradually she became quite accustomed to thinking about Okada while she carried on her conversation with Suezō. Even when Suezō made love to her, she would shut her eyes and imagine it was Okada. Sometimes she would dream that she and Okada were together. They had come together, it seemed, without any sort of bothersome procedure. How wonderful! she would think, and then all at once her companion was no longer Okada but Suezō. She would wake with a start, her nerves so taut it was impossible to get back to sleep, and weep with irritation."
或る日末造は喧嘩をして、内をひょいと飛び出した。時刻は午前十時過ぎでもあっただろう。直ぐに無縁坂へ往こうかとも思ったが、生憎女中が小さい子を連れて、七軒町の通にいたので、わざと切通の方へ抜けて、どこへ往くと云う気もなしに、天神町から五軒町へと、忙がしそうに歩いて行った。折々「糞」「畜生」などと云う、いかがわしい単語を口の内でつぶやいているのである。昌平橋に掛かる時、向うから芸者が来た。どこかお玉に似ていると思って、傍を摩れ違うのを好く見れば、顔は雀斑だらけであった。矢っ張お玉の方が別品だなと思うと同時に、心に愉快と満足とを覚えて、暫く足を橋の上に駐めて、芸者の後影を見送った。多分買物にでも出たのだろう、雀斑芸者は講武所の横町へ姿を隠してしまった。,"One day, Suezo quarreled and jumped out. The time would have been past 10 am. I thought I'd go to Muenzaka right away, but the maid was on the street of Shichikencho with a small child, so I deliberately went out to the cut-off and didn't feel like going anywhere, Tenjincho. I walked from to Gokencho in a busy manner. From time to time, he mutters suspicious words such as ""feces"" and ""livestock"" in his mouth. When I hung on Shohei Bridge, a geisha came from the other side. I thought it looked like a ladle somewhere, and when I liked to see it slipping by, my face was full of freckles. At the same time as I thought that the Yahari ladle was a different item, I felt pleasant and satisfied in my heart, so I parked my foot on the bridge for a while and saw off the shadow of the geisha. Perhaps he went shopping, but the freckled geisha hid himself in the Yokomachi area of the Kobusho.","One morning after a quarrel Suezo rushed out of the house. It was probably a few minutes past ten-thirty. He thought he would go directly to Muenzaka, but when he saw the maid and his children heading that way, he turned in another direction and hurried ahead aimlessly. Occasionally he muttered some foul words to himself. As he reached Shohei-bashi, he saw a geisha coming from the opposite direction. He first imagined that she looked like Otama, but as he passed her he saw that her face was freckled. “My Otama's more beautiful,” he thought. He was aware of an immediate sense of satisfaction, and stopping on the bridge, he watched the geisha's departure. Speculating that she was out shopping, he saw her disappear into an alley.","One morning, after quarreling with his wife, Suezō left the house in a rage sometime after ten. He thought of going straight to Muenzaka, but as luck would have it, the maid had started off with the youngest child in that direction. So to avoid a possible meeting, he skirted around Kiridōshi and, without any clear idea where he was going, walked rapidly the other way through Tenjinchō toward Gokenchō. As he hurried along, he muttered profanities under his breath. When he crossed Shōhei Bridge, he saw a geisha coming from the opposite direction. She looked something like Otama, but observing her more closely when she passed by, he saw that her face was a mass of freckles. Oh no, he thought to himself, Otama is much better looking than that! The thought brought him an instant feeling of delight and satisfaction, and he stood for a while in the middle of the bridge peering after her. Probably out shopping, he decided, as the freckle-faced geisha disappeared down a side street of Kōbusho."
お玉は父親を幸福にしようと云う目的以外に、何の目的も有していなかったので、無理に堅い父親を口説き落すようにして人の妾になった。そしてそれを堕落せられるだけ堕落するのだと見て、その利他的行為の中に一種の安心を求めていた。しかしその檀那と頼んだ人が、人もあろうに高利貸であったと知った時は、余りの事に途方に暮れた。そこでどうも自分一人で胸のうやもやを排し去ることが出来なくなって、その心持を父親に打ち明けて、一しょに苦み悶えて貰おうと思った。そうは思ったものの、池の端の父親を尋ねてその平穏な生活を目のあたり見ては、どうも老人の手にしている杯の裡に、一滴の毒を注ぐに忍びない。よしやせつない思をしても、その思を我胸一つに畳んで置こうと決心した。そしてこの決心と同時に、これまで人にたよることしか知らなかったお玉が、始て独立したような心持になった。,"The ladle had no purpose other than the purpose of making his father happy, so he tried to persuade his hard father to become a concubinage. And seeing that it would be corrupted as much as it could be, he sought a kind of reassurance in his altruistic acts. However, when the person who asked for that Danna knew that it was a high-interest loan, I was at a loss. So I couldn't get rid of the haze in my chest by myself, so I confided my feelings to my father and decided to have him suffer and writhe together. I thought so, but when I asked my father at the edge of the pond and witnessed his peaceful life, I couldn't stand to pour a drop of poison into the cup that the old man had. Even if I thought it was a good idea, I decided to fold it in my chest. And at the same time as this decision, the ladle, which I had only known to depend on people, became independent for the first time.","Her aim in life had been her father's happiness, so she had become a mistress, almost forcibly persuading the old man to accept. She knew she had degraded herself to the lowest limits, yet she had still sought a kind of spiritual comfort in the unselfishness of her choice. But when the person who supported her turned out to be a usurer, she did not know how to cope with this new source of misfortune. The thought tormented her, and she was unable to remove it. She had gone to her father to tell him about it and to ask him to share her pain. But when she had visited him and had seen him living comfortably for the first time, she didn't want to pour a drop of poison into the saké cup he held in his hand. Whatever pain the decision might cost her, she was determined to keep her sadness to herself. And when she had made this decision, the girl, who had always depended on others, had felt for the first time her own independence.","With no other objective than to insure the comfort and happiness of her father, Otama had argued away the objections of the straitlaced old man and taken up life as a mistress. She would go that far in her degradation, she had determined, if in this act of altruism she could find a kind of peace. But when she discovered that the man who was keeping her was of all things a moneylender, she was overwhelmed with despair. The confusion in her mind was more than she herself could dispel, and she determined to reveal her feelings to her father so that he could share her distress with her. When she arrived at the house by the pond, however, and saw with her own eyes its tranquil life, she could not bring herself to inflict this pain on the old man. Instead she determined that, bitter as it might be, she would reveal her cares to no one. With this decision Otama, who had always relied on others, for the first time learned what it meant to stand alone."
石原は黙って池の方を指ざした。岡田も僕も、灰色に濁った夕の空気を透かして、指ざす方角を見た。その頃は根津に通ずる小溝から、今三人の立っている汀まで、一面に葦が茂っていた。その葦の枯葉が池の中心に向って次第に疎になって、只枯蓮の襤褸のような葉、海綿のような房が碁布せられ、葉や房の茎は、種々の高さに折れて、それが鋭角に聳えて、景物に荒涼な趣を添えている。bitumeビチュウム色の茎の間を縫って、黒ずんだ上に鈍い反射を見せている水の面を、十羽ばかりの雁が緩やかに往来している。中には停止して動かぬのもある。,"Ishihara silently pointed toward the pond. Both Okada and I looked in the direction of pointing through the gray muddy evening air. At that time, there was a lot of reeds from the small groove leading to Nezu to the shore where the three of us are standing. The dead leaves of the reeds gradually became sparse toward the center of the pond, and the leaves like the 褤 褸 of the dead lotus and the tufts like the sponge were spread, and the stems of the leaves and tufts became various heights. It breaks and rises sharply, adding a desolate taste to the scenery. Ten or so geese slowly come and go on the surface of the water, which is darkened and shows dull reflections, sewn between the bitume bitume-colored stems. Some of them stop and do not move.","Without answering he pointed across the water. We stared in that direction through the gray vagueness of the evening air. In those days, rushes grew all over the section of the pond from the Nezu ditch to where we were now standing. The withered stalks became more and more sparse toward the center of the pond, where only dried up lotus leaves like bunches of rags and seed sacs like sponges were seen here and there with stems broken at various heights into acute angles. They lent a picturesque desolation to the scene. Among these bitumen-colored stems and over the dark gray surface of the water reflecting faint lights, we saw a dozen wild geese slowly moving back and forth. Some rested motionless on the water.","Ishihara silently pointed toward the pond. Okada and I peered through the gray-tinged evening air in the direction he indicated. At the time of my story the whole surface of the pond from the little ditch that runs down from Nezu to the shore where the three of us were standing was overgrown with reeds. The dead leaves of the reeds gradually thinned out toward the center of the pond, where ragged dried-up lotus leaves and sponge-shaped seed pods dotted the surface, their stems, broken at varying heights, slanting down into the water at sharp angles and giving the scene a desolate air. Ten or twelve wild geese moved to and fro among the soot-colored stems of the lotuses, gliding over the black, faintly glimmering surface of the pond. A few of them sat motionless where they were."

「あら、奥さん。どこへいらっしゃるのです」,"""Oh, wife. Where are you?""","Where are you going, Okusan?”","“Where are you going, ma’am?”"
待ち受けていた石原は、岡田と僕とを引っ張って、池の緑に出て云った。「時刻は丁度好い。達者な雁は皆塒を変えてしまった。僕はすぐに為事に掛かる。それには君達がここにいて、号令を掛けてくれなくてはならないのだ。見給え。そこの三間ばかり前の所に蓮の茎の右へ折れたのがある。その延線に少し低い茎の左へ折れたのがある。僕はあの延線を前へ前へと行かなくてはならないのだ。そこで僕がそれをはずれそうになったら、君達がここから右とか左とか云って修正してくれるのだ」,"Ishihara, who was waiting, pulled Okada and me and went out to the green of the pond. ""The time is just right. All the savvy geese have changed their stalks. I'm going to do something right away. You have to be here and give me a command. Look. There was a break to the right of the lotus stalk just three minutes before there. There was a break to the left of the slightly lower stalk on that extension. I didn't go forward on that extension. It shouldn't be. So if I'm about to miss it, you guys will fix it right or left from here. ""","Ishihara, who had been looking for us, brought us to the edge of the water and said: “It's all right now. All the other geese have shifted their positions. I'll start now. You two stand here and give me directions. Look. About six yards from here you see a broken lotus stem falling to the right. Now in line with that is another stem lower than that one and falling to the left. I have to make my way along that line. Now, if you see me get off even a bit, shout out to me either ‘right' or ‘left' and put me straight.”","“The time’s just right,” said Ishihara, pulling us to the edge of the water. “All the other geese have gone to roost, so I’ll get straight to work. You two have to stand here and give me directions. See that lotus stem bent to the right about twenty feet out? And the shorter one bent to the left in line with it farther out? I have to stay directly in line with those two points. If you see me varying from that line, tell me which way to go"
