"Hela luften var plötsligt mörk, tjock och mörk, men det vimlade i mörkret på ett sätt som jag inte kände igen. Alldeles intill mig kände jag mer än såg, hur fasta kroppar fyllde luften omkring mig. Jag drog fram min ficklampa och riktade den rakt framför mig. Den träffade en mänsklig skepnad på en halv meters avstånd. Fallskärmstrupper! Strax därpå hade jag väl tio starkare ficklampor i ansiktet och kände mig fattad kring armarna av kraftiga händer.","The whole air was suddenly dark, thick and dark, but it was teeming with darkness in a way I did not recognize. Right next to me, I felt more than saw how solids filled the air around me. I pulled out my flashlight and pointed it straight in front of me. It met a human figure half a meter away. Paratroopers! Shortly afterwards, I probably had ten stronger flashlights on my face and felt gripped around my arms by strong hands.","The air was suddenly dark all over, thick and dark, but in the darkness there was a swarming of a kind I did not recognize.

"När jag sprang upp på podiet igen, hade Rissen vaknat helt och hållet. Han satt stilla och såg rakt ut i luften, och fortfarande log han för sig själv i sin ensamhet, men nu var leendet bittert.

"Vid hennes fråga vaknade min svartsjuka och vädrade. Hur intimt var egentligen förhållandet mellan henne och Rissen? I en stor fabrik kunde det ofta hända, att två personer befann sig utom synhåll för de andra, i lagerlokalerna till exempel, där balar och lårar skymde utsikten genom glasväggarna och där kanske till råga på allt ingen annan var sysselsatt vid den tiden ... Också Linda hade ju haft sin tur som nattvakt i fabriken. Rissen kunde mycket väl haft sin vakt på samma gång. Allt var möjligt, till och med det värsta av allt: att det fortfarande var honom hon älskade och inte mig.","When she asked, my jealousy woke up and smelled. How intimate was the relationship between her and Rissen really? In a large factory it could often happen that two people were out of sight of the others, in the warehouses for example, where bales and thighs obscured the view through the glass walls and where perhaps to top it all no one else was busy at that time ... Linda had also had her turn as a night watchman in the factory. Rissen could very well have had his guard at the same time. Everything was possible, even the worst of all: that it was still him she loved and not me.","At her question my jealousy awoke and pricked up its ears. How intimate, really, was the relationship between her and Rissen?

"När jag sedan satt där hemma vid min kvällsmat, var det som att upprepa den förfärliga middagen. Samma svårighet att möta Lindas ögon som förut Rissens, samma känsla att hon måste veta allt, samma fientlighet, som laddade luften mellan oss. Sekunderna kröp fram, och jag trodde aldrig hembiträdet skulle gå och barnen somna. Äntligen var jag ensam med Linda, och för att undvika åhörare ställde jag på radion för fullt och satte både henne och mig så att högtalaren kom mellan oss och polisörat.","When I then sat there at home at my supper, it was like repeating the awful dinner.

"Visst var det riktigt, visst var det önskvärt att ett skadedjur som Rissen utrotades. Det var inte det. Men jag kämpade med tvivel på att man överhuvudtaget kom särdeles långt med ett sådant utrotningskrig. För något dygn sedan hade det förefallit mig enkelt nog: man dödade Rissen, så var Rissen borta, också Rissen inom mig själv, eftersom han var inympad där av den andre, den levande. Man dödade Rissen, och sedan var man en sann medsoldat igen, en lycklig, sund cell i Statens organism.

"En smula irriterad frågade jag, om det verkligen varit alldeles omöjligt att skicka en färsk försöksperson.

Något sådant ville jag inte riskera. För resten visste jag från ordningsföreskrifterna, att man strängt borde hålla på sin rätt att få färska försökspersoner: vanan att oupphörligt skicka samma och samma uppammade lätt ett slags gunstlingssystem, så att aldrig så duktiga och villiga offertjänstare kanske inte på långa tider fick tillfälle att att visa sitt mod och få ut någon liten extraförtjänst. Ett kall som det i Frivilliga offertjänsten var visserligen hedervärdare än de flesta och borde anses som sin egen belöning, om man ville vara mycket sträng, men arvodet var i alla fall beräknat i underkant med hänsyn till de många extra skadeersättningar som hörde till yrket.","A little annoyed, I asked if it was really impossible to send a fresh subject. During my work as an assistant at one of the medical laboratories, it had happened that my then boss happened to get hold of a woman with the whole gland operation disturbed by a previous attempt, and I remembered very well that it was upsetting the whole result of his investigations. I did not want to risk something like that. After all, I knew from the rules of procedure that one should strictly adhere to the right to have fresh subjects: the habit of incessantly sending the same and the same easily conceived a kind of favorite system, so that never so good and willing sacrificial servants may not in long time have the opportunity to show your courage and make some small extra profits. A call like the one in the Voluntary Sacrifice Service was admittedly more honorable than most and should be considered as one's own reward, if one wanted to be very strict, but the fee was in any case calculated at the bottom with regard to the many extra damages that belonged to the profession.","Slightly irritated, I asked if it had really been impossible to send a fresh test subject. In the course of my work as an assistant at one of the medical laboratories it had happened that my chief at the time had got hold of a woman whose entire glandular system had been wiped out by an earlier test, and I had a very clear recollection of how this kept distorting the result of his investigations. I did not want to risk something of that sort. As a matter of fact, I knew from the rules and regulations that one ought to firmly insist on one’s right to have fresh test subjects: the habit of continually sending the same ones fostered a kind of cronyism, so that sometimes for long periods of time extremely conscientious and willing volunteers were denied the chance of showing their courage and obtaining some small extra earnings. A calling like the Voluntary Sacrifice Service was certainly more honourable than most, and ought to be seen as its own reward, if one were to be really strict about it – but then the salary was at the lower end of the scale, because of the many payments for injury compensation that were part and parcel of the profession.","Somewhat annoyed I asked if no completely healthy test-person was available. During my work as assistant at one of the medical laboratories it had happened that my then chief had been sent a woman whose entire glandular system had been destroyed in an earlier experiment, and I remembered very well how this fact had almost ruined his whole investigation. I did not wish to risk anything similar. I was also well aware from the regulations that I had a right to insist on healthy individuals for my test: the practice of sending the same people over and over again turned into a sort of favoritism which denied excellent specimens the opportunity to show their courage, besides depriving them of a little extra compensation. A profession like that of the Voluntary Sacrificial Service was of course in itself more honorable than most, and ought really be considered a compensation in itself, but nevertheless the pay was in the lowest bracket, due to the many extra claims for injury which were part of the profession."

Hon skakade på huvudet.,She shook her head.,She shook her head.,She shook her head.
"En bred skepnad snodde runt på stolen och lyfte hälsande på sina buskiga ögonbryn. Det var tydligt att åsynen av Karrek gjorde honom ganska nöjd. Jag kände ganska väl igen polisminister Tuareg från Medsoldatens Porträttalbum, hans små svarta björnögon, hans viljestarka underkäk, hans fylliga mun, och ändå gjorde han ett långt mer överväldigande intryck på mig än jag någonsin väntat mig. Kanske var det också känslan av att stå inför den koncentrerade Makten, som kom mig att darra. Tuareg var hjärnan bakom de millioner ögon och öron, som såg och hörde medsoldaternas intimaste handlingar och samtal dag och natt, han var viljan bakom de millioner armar, som ständigt eller vissa delar av dagen skyddade Statens inre säkerhet – också bakom mina armar, i den mån mina kvällar ägnades åt polistjänstgöring. Och ändå skälvde jag till, som om det inte varit min egen högsta vilja jag stått ansikte mot ansikte med – som om jag i stället varit en av de brottslingar han jagade. Och ändå hade jag ju inte gjort något ont! Varifrån kom då den olycksaliga splittringen i mitt väsen? Svaret låg nära till hands: alltsammans berodde på en insuggererad vanföreställning, som kunde uttryckas med orden: ”Ingen medsoldat över fyrti kan ha gott samvete”. Och den som uttalat dessa ord var Rissen. – Såå, här har vi alltså våra nya bundsförvanter, sade polisministern till Karrek. Skulle ni vara beredda att göra några små provexperiment om två timmar? I tredje våningen är ett rum iordningställt till laboratorium – primitivt kanske, men jag förmodar där finns vad ni behöver. Är det något som fattas, så är det bara att säga till personalen. Och försökspersoner ställer vi till förfogande.","A broad figure twisted around the chair and lifted greetingly on its bushy eyebrows. It was clear that the sight of Karrek made him quite pleased. I recognized Police Minister Tuareg quite well from Medsoldaten's Portrait Album, his little black bear eyes, his strong-willed lower jaw, his plump mouth, and yet he made a far more overwhelming impression on me than I ever expected. Maybe it was also the feeling of facing the concentrated Power that made me tremble. Tuareg was the mastermind behind the millions of eyes and ears that saw and heard fellow soldiers' most intimate actions and conversations day and night, he was the will behind the millions of arms that constantly or some parts of the day protected the State's internal security - also behind my arms, in it to the extent that my evenings were devoted to police service. And yet I trembled, as if it were not my own highest will I stood face to face with - as if I had instead been one of the criminals he hunted. And yet I had not done any harm! Where then did the unfortunate division in my being come from? The answer was close at hand: it was all due to an ingrained delusion, which could be expressed with the words: ""No fellow soldier over forty can have a good conscience"". And the one who uttered these words was Rissen. - So, here we have our new allies, the Minister of Police told Karrek. Would you be prepared to do some small test experiments in two hours? On the third floor, a room is prepared for a laboratory - primitive perhaps, but I guess there is what you need. If something is missing, just tell the staff. And we make subjects available.","A broad-shouldered figure turned round in his chair and raised his bushy eyebrows in greeting. It was clear that he was rather pleased to see Karrek. I recognized Police Minister Tuareg at once from the Fellow Soldier’s Portrait Album, his small, black bear-like eyes, his strong-willed lower jaw, his fleshy mouth and yet the impression he made on me was far more overwhelming than I had ever expected it to be. Perhaps, too, it was the sense of standing before concentrated Power that made me tremble. Tuareg was the brain behind those millions of eyes and ears that saw and heard the fellow soldiers’ most intimate deeds and conversations day and night, he was the will behind those millions of arms that constantly or for certain parts of the day protected the State’s internal security – including my own arms, in so far as my evenings were devoted to police duty. And yet I quaked, as though it were not my own supreme will I stood face to face with – as though instead I were one of the criminals he hunted. And yet I had done nothing wrong! Where did that ill-fated split in my being originate? The answer lay close at hand: it was all the result of a hypnotic delusion that might be expressed in the words: ‘No fellow soldier over forty can have a clear conscience.’ And the man who had spoken those words was Rissen. ‘So-o, here we have our new associates,’ said the police minister to Karrek. ‘Would you be ready to perform some small sample experiments in two hours’ time? On the third floor there is a room that has been set up as a laboratory – a primitive one, perhaps, but I think you will find it contains what you need. If anything is lacking, all you have to do is tell the staff. And we will put test subjects at your disposal.’","A massive figure turned in his chair and raised his bushy eyebrows in a greeting. It was quite apparent that he was pleased to see Karrek. I recognized at once Police Minister Tuareg from our Fellow-Soldiers' Portrait Album—his small, black bear-eyes, his determined lower jaw, his full lips—and yet he made a much more imposing impression on me than I had anticipated. Perhaps also the feeling of concentrated Power made me tremble. Tuareg was the brain behind the millions of eyes and ears that saw and heard the most intimate acts of the fellow-soldiers day and night, as well as listened to their most private conversations. His was the will behind the millions of soldiers who constantly protected the State's internal security; this included me when my evenings were devoted to police duty. And yet I trembled, as if this were not my commander-in-chief I faced here, but as if instead I were one of the criminals he hunted down. And I had not done anything wrong! Whence then came this most unfortunate splintering in my nature? The answer was close at hand: all was caused by a suggested false notion, expressed in the words: ""No fellow-soldier over forty can have a clear conscience."" And it was Rissen who had spoken those words. ""Well, so these are our new allies,"" said the police minister to Karrek. ""Could you be ready to show me a few small sample experiments in two hours? On the third floor a room has been made ready for a laboratory—maybe primitive, but I expect you'll find what you need. If you should wish anything further, only tell the personnel. And we have our own test-persons."""
"Men på den tiden skulle jag tillbakavisat en sådan tanke med förakt. Linda spelade en alltför viktig roll i mitt liv, skulle jag sagt. Och det var sant, inget grubbel och inga omtydningar har sedan kunnat ändra det. I betydelse hade hon gott kunnat ta upp tävlan med min karriär. Mot min vilja höll hon mig fast på ett rent oförnuftigt sätt.","But at that time, I would reject such a thought with contempt. Linda played an overly important role in my life, I would say.

The sobs subsided, and he straightened up to a slightly more dignified position.

"– Kan ni verkligen vara nog oförsynt att skjuta ansvaret ..., började jag ett litet häftigt tal till försökspersonen. Jag märkte att Rissen gav mig en lång blick, som på en gång var kall och road, och kände hur jag rodnade vid tanken på att nu trodde han säkert att jag gjorde mig viktig för honom. (En mycket orättvis tanke, ansåg jag.) I alla fall måste jag avsluta meningen och fortsatte i betydligt tamare röstläge: – – på andra för att ni har valt ett yrke som ni sedan inte anser passar er?","- Can you really be careless enough to postpone the responsibility ..., I started a little cool speech to the subject.

In any case, I must end the sentence and continue in a much tamer voice: - - on others because you have chosen a profession that you then do not consider suitable for you?","‘Can you really be so inconsiderate as to put the blame …’ I began a rather heated address to the test subject.

"Då jag kom hem och in i föräldrarummet – Linda hade redan gått till sängs – väntade ett meddelande på mitt nattduksbord. Det gällde militär- och polistjänstgöringen: från fyra kvällar i veckan utsträcktes den till fem. Tills vidare ansåg sig alltså myndigheterna tvungna att inskränka familjekvällarna från två till en, medan fest- och föredragskvällen bibehölls oavkortad. (Den senare var ju också nödvändig inte bara för medsoldaternas rekreation och fostran, utan också för Statens bestånd.

"Det skulle varit snyggt, tänkte jag med fasa, om någon skämtsam polisman, eller kanske Rissen, hade tagit sprutan ur handen på mig och stuckit den i min egen arm i stället.

No one could be more normal than I; my insomnia was only too natural and too understandable. Indeed, I should rather have considered it unnatural and an indication of sickness could I have slept well under the circumstances."
"En annan kom att tala om hur viktigt det var att inte släppa ut filmerna med alltför långt mellanrum. Någon påtryckning ansågs ju inte böra övas för att framkalla dessa anmälningar, och det behövdes sannerligen inte heller. En viss överrumpling var tillräcklig för att åstadkomma en verkan nästan lika stark som våld och i längden betydligt mindre farlig. Gärna tvinga till ett hastigt avgörande: nu eller aldrig – görs det inte inom den och den tiden är det för sent! Den ångest, som gärna vaknar vid bestämda krispunkter i livet, skärps inför det snabba valet och driver i rätt riktning, om propagandan sköts bra.","Another came to talk about how important it was not to release the films at too long intervals. It was not considered that any pressure should be exerted to provoke these reports, and it certainly was not necessary either.

A quick decision needed to be made: now or never – if it was not done within such and such a time, it was too late! The fear that usually awoke at certain times of crisis in one’s life was rendered more acute in the face of rapid choice and drove the person in the right direction, if the propaganda was well presented.","Someone else pointed out the importance of showing these films at shorter intervals. Special pressure was not considered desirable to obtain volunteers, nor was it necessary.

If not within such or such time it will be too late! The anxiety which is liable to arise at certain definite crises in life is sharpened by an urgent choice and impels one in the right direction, if the propaganda is well presented."

My detestation was deeper than that. Only, it seemed less urgent today, whatever the reason. But if I failed to do it now I would detest myself. Precisely now, purely by chance, I happened to have plenty of time to formulate an accusation, before Linda awakened; and one good thing that the happenings of the night had brought was that I knew she did not belong to Rissen, but to me."
"Just den veckan hade vårt experiment utfallit ovanligt gynnsamt. Inte mindre än tre av tiomannagruppen saknades bland de angivna, och lyckligtvis hade polisen också skyndsamt satt i gång med häktningen; vi hade alltså tre utomstående och intet anande personer till vårt förfogande. Polischefen Karrek själv infann sig till undersökningen. Lång och mager slog han sig ner i stolen, sträckte ut sina långa ben rakt framför sig, knäppte händerna över den smala bålen och väntade med en hemlighetsfull eld i ögonspringorna. Polischefen var en märklig person, en sådan som tycktes född att gå långt. Hans hållning kunde vara lika slapp och slappare än Rissens, och ändå verkade han aldrig omilitärisk. Medan Rissen lyftes på sina egna impulser och tycktes driva snarare än styra, var Karreks hopsjunkna vila bara satsen före språnget, och i det hårt slutna ansiktet, i glittret bakom hans halvslutna ögonlock kunde man läsa, att det skulle bli ett vilddjurssprång, som inte förfelade sitt mål. Jag kände inte bara respekt för hans styrka, jag satte också mitt hopp till hans makt. Det skulle snart visa sig, att där hade jag räknat rätt.","Just that week, our experiment had turned out to be unusually favorable. No less than three of the ten-man group were missing among those listed, and fortunately the police had also hastily started the arrest; so we had three outsiders and unsuspecting people at our disposal. Police Chief Karrek himself appeared for the investigation. Tall and thin, he sat down in the chair, stretched out his long legs straight in front of him, clasped his hands over the narrow torso and waited with a mysterious fire in his eye sockets. The police chief was a strange person, one who seemed born to go far. His attitude could be as slack and slacker than Rissen's, and yet he never seemed unmilitary. While Rissen was lifted on his own impulses and seemed to push rather than steer, Karrek's collapsed rest was just the sentence before the leap, and in the tightly closed face, in the glitter behind his half-closed eyelids, one could read that it would be a wild leap, which did not fail. its goal. Not only did I feel respect for his strength, I also put my hope in his power. It would soon turn out that I had calculated correctly.","That particular week our experiment had turned out to be unusually successful. No fewer than three of the group of ten were missing from the list of those who had been denounced, and fortunately the police had also been quick off the mark in making the arrests; so we had three independent and unsuspecting subjects at our disposal. Police Chief Karrek himself took part in the investigation. Tall and thin, he sat down on his chair, stretched his long legs straight before him, clasped his hands over his narrow torso, and waited with a mysterious fire in the slits of his eyes. The police chief was a remarkable person, the sort of man who seemed to be born to go far. His posture could be slack, even slacker than Rissen’s, and yet he never looked unmilitary. While Rissen was carried along by his own impulses and seemed to drift rather than steer, Karrek’s sunken repose was merely the lull before the leap, and in the hard, closed features, in the glitter behind his half-closed eyelids one could read that it would be the leap of a wild beast that never missed its prey. Not only did I feel respect for his physical strength, I also pinned my hopes to his power. Soon it would turn out that there my calculations had been correct.","That very week our experiment had been unusually successful. No fewer than three in the group of ten failed to make the anticipated report, and fortunately the police had been quick to arrest them. Consequently we had three unsuspecting outsiders at our disposal. Police Chief Karrek appeared in person at the examination. Tall, slim he sank down in the chair, stretched out his long legs, folded his hands across his narrow waist, and waited with an expectant fire in his slits of eyes. The chief of police was a remarkable man, destined from birth to go very far. His bearing could be as slack as Rissen's—even slacker—yet he never appeared unmilitary. While Rissen was supported by his own impulses, seemingly dragged along rather than directing, Karrek's shrunken slouch was only the crouch before the spring, and in his hard, closed face, in the glint behind the half-closed eyelids, lay the warning that it would be a beast's spring, never missing its prey. I not only felt respect for his strength, I also hitched my hopes to his power. In this I soon discovered that I was correct."

"Den bok jag nu sätter mig ner att skriva måste verka meningslös på många – om jag alls vågar tänka mig, att ”många” får läsa den – eftersom jag alldeles självmant, utan någons order, börjar ett sådant arbete och ändå inte själv är riktigt på det klara med vad avsikten är. Jag vill och måste, det är alltsammans. Allt mer och mer obönhörligt frågar man efter avsikten och planmässigheten i vad som göres och säges, så att helst inte ett ord ska falla på måfå – det är bara författaren till den här boken som har tvingats gå motsatta vägen, ut i det ändamålslösa. Ty fast mina år här som fånge och kemist – de måste vara över tjugu, tänker jag mig – har varit fulla nog ändå av arbete och brådska, måste det finnas något som inte tycker det är tillräckligt och som har lett och överblickat ett annat arbete inom mig, ett som jag själv inte hade någon möjlighet att överblicka och där jag ändå har varit djupt och nästan plågsamt medintresserad. Det arbetet kommer att vara slutfört, när jag väl har skrivit ner min bok. Jag inser alltså, hur förnuftsvidriga mina skriverier måste te sig inför allt rationellt och praktiskt tänkande, men jag skriver ändå.","The book I am now sitting down to write must seem meaningless to many - if I dare at all to imagine that ""many"" can read it - because I completely voluntarily, without anyone's order, begin such work and yet not myself really on it clear with what the intention is. I want and have to, that's all. More and more relentlessly one asks for the intention and planning of what is done and said, so that preferably not a word should fall at random - it is only the author of this book who has been forced to go the opposite way, into the purposeless. For although my years here as a prisoner and chemist - they must be over twenty, I think - have been full enough yet of work and urgency, there must be something that does not think it is enough and that has led and overseen another work within me, one that I myself had no opportunity to see and where I have nevertheless been deeply and almost painfully co-interested. That work will be completed, once I have written down my book. I realize, then, how irrational my writings must seem in the face of all rational and practical thinking, but I still write.","The book I now sit down to write will inevitably appear pointless to many – if indeed I dare suppose that ‘many’ will ever have a chance to read it – since quite on my own initiative, without anyone’s orders, I am beginning a task of this kind and yet am myself not really clear about its purpose. I will and must, and that is all. Ever more inexorable are the demands for purpose and method in what is done and said, so that not a word shall fall at random – it is only the author of this book who has been compelled to go the other way, out into futility. For although my years here as prisoner and chemist – they must be over twenty, I imagine – have been full enough of work and hurry, there must be something that feels this to be insufficient, and has directed and envisioned another task within me, one that I myself had no possibility of envisioning, and in which I nevertheless have had a deep and almost painful interest. That task will be completed when I have written my book. So although I realize how absurd my writings must appear in the light of all rational and practical thinking, I shall write all the same.","The book I now sit down to write must seem pointless to many—if indeed I dare imagine ""many"" will have the opportunity to read it—since of my own volition, without anyone's request, I undertake such a work, and since I myself am not quite clear as to the purpose.

The demand for purpose and method in one's doings and sayings has become more and more exacting, lest a single word might be uttered haphazardly; but the author of this book has been forced to take the opposite course, out into purposelessness, because even though my years here as prisoner and chemist—they must be more than twenty, I suppose—have been well enough filled with work and urgency , there is a something that feels this to be insufficient and that has inspired and envisioned another labor within me, one which I myself could not have envisioned, and in which I nevertheless have been deeply and almost painfully involved. That labor will be completed when I have finished my book. Consequently, I realize how unreasonable and irrational my scribblings must seem in comparison to all rational and practical thinking; yet write I must."
"Muilis mottagning befann sig inte inom vår laboratoriebyggnad, men man behövde inte gå upp till jordytan för att komma dit: genom en gång tre trappor ner kom man direkt över till den byggnad, där laboratoriekontoren arbetade, och sedan man visat sitt identifikationskort och en sekreterare per telefon förvissat sig om att man var väntad, fördes man vidare. Inom tjugufem minuter stod vi inför Muili, en järngrå och mycket mager man av sjukligt utseende. Han såg knappast på oss.

"På väggen satt polisörat och bredvid det polisögat, lika verksamt i mörker som i ljus. Ingen kunde finna dem annat än välmotiverade: vilka härdar för spionage och konspirationer kunde inte föräldrarummen annars bli, helst som de också användes som besöksrum! Senare, då jag fick en så intim inblick i åtskilliga medsoldaters familjeliv, blev jag tvungen att sätta polisörat och polisögat i nära sammanhang med den otillfredsställande nativitetskurvan inom Världsstaten. Men jag tror knappast det var för deras skull som mitt blod numera så lätt stillnade. Så hade det åtminstone aldrig varit förr. Vår Världsstat hade minst av allt någon asketisk syn på könet, tvärtom var det ju nödvändigt och hedervärt att avla nya medsoldater, och allting gjordes för att män och kvinnor alltifrån fullmogen ålder skulle ha tillfälle att fylla sin plikt i det avseendet. Från början hade jag heller inte haft något emot, om man från högre ort då och då konstaterade, att jag var man. Snarare hade det varit en sporre. Över våra nätter förr hade det legat ett skimmer av festlig föreställning, där vi två inte var annat än högtidligt gripna och ansvarsmedvetna fullbordare av ett ritual i Statens egen åsyn. Men en förskjutning hade inträtt under årens lopp. Medan jag förut också i mina intimaste förehavanden mest frågade efter, hur jag värderades av den Makt, som också begagnade sig av ögat på väggen, hade den makten nu mer och mer förbytts i ett besvärande påhäng just i sådana stunder då jag vildast längtade efter Linda och efter det aldrig uppnådda och aldrig uppnåeliga under, som skulle göra mig till herre över hennes innersta gåtor. Ögat, som jag frågade efter, fanns ännu, men det var Linda själv. Jag började ana, att min kärlek hade tagit en otillbörligt privat vändning, och det besvärade mitt samvete. Äktenskapets mål var ju barn, vad hade det med vidskepliga drömmar om nycklar och herradömen att göra! Kanske var denna farliga vändning i mitt äktenskap ännu ett skäl att skiljas. Och för mig själv undrade jag, om andra skilsmässor runtomkring oss kunde ha samma orsaker ...","On the wall sat the police ear and next to it the police eye, as effective in the dark as in the light. No one could find them other than well-motivated: what hotspots for espionage and conspiracies could not otherwise become the parents' rooms, preferably as they were also used as visiting rooms! Later, when I got such an intimate insight into the family life of several fellow soldiers, I had to put the police ear and the police eye in close connection with the unsatisfactory nativity curve within the World State. But I do not think it was for their sake that my blood now so easily calmed down. At least that has never been the case before. Our World State had at least some ascetic view of gender, on the contrary, it was necessary and honorable to breed new fellow soldiers, and everything was done so that men and women from adulthood would have the opportunity to fulfill their duty in that regard. From the beginning, I would not have minded if someone from a higher place occasionally stated that I was a man. Rather, it had been a spur. Over our nights before, there had been a shimmer of festive performance, where the two of us were nothing but solemnly arrested and responsible completers of a ritual in the State's own presence. But a shift had occurred over the years. Whereas in the past, even in my most intimate pursuits, I mostly asked how I was valued by the Power, which also used the eye on the wall, that power had now more and more been transformed into a troublesome attachment just in such moments when I longed for Linda the most. and after the never attained and never attainable miracle, which would make me lord of her innermost riddles. The eye I asked for still existed, but it was Linda herself. I began to suspect that my love had taken an improperly private turn, and it bothered my conscience. The goal of marriage was children, what did that have to do with superstitious dreams about keys and dominion! Perhaps this dangerous turnaround in my marriage was another reason to divorce.

But I hardly think it was because of them that my blood ran so thin nowadays. At least, it had never been like this before. Our World State certainly did not take an ascetic view of sex, for on the contrary the breeding of new fellow soldiers was a necessary and honourable task, and every effort was made to see to it that as soon as they reached the age of maturity men and women had an opportunity of fulfilling their duty in this regard. Also, from the very outset I had not objected to someone higher up making sure that I was a man. It had rather been a spur to action. Our nights had been bathed in a shimmer of ceremonial display, where the two of us were nothing but solemnly inspired and conscientious performers of a ritual in the sight of the State. But over the years a change had taken place. Whereas earlier, even in my most intimate activities, I had mainly speculated about how I was valued by the power that also made use of the eye on the wall, nowadays that power was increasingly becoming an oppressive encumbrance at precisely those moments when I yearned most wildly for Linda, and for the never-attained and never attainable miracle that would make me lord of her innermost mysteries. The eye I had wondered about was still there, but the eye was Linda herself. I began to sense that my love had taken an inappropriately private turn, and it weighed on my conscience.

"– Det gör jag inte, svarade jag. Och tro för all del inte, att jag går ut från någon sorts civilistisk vidskepelse, att Staten skulle vara till för vår skull i stället för att vi är till för Statens, som det ju i verkligheten förhåller sig. Jag menar bara, att kärnan i de enskilda cellernas förhållande till statsorganismen ligger i hungern efter säkerhet. Om vi en dag skulle märka – jag säger inte att vi har gjort det, men om – att vår ärtsoppa blev tunnare, vår tvål knappt användbar, våra bostäder fallfärdiga, utan att någon bekymrade sig om saken – skulle vi knota då? Nej. Vi vet, att vällevnaden inte är ett värde i sig själv, att våra uppoffringar tjänar ett högre ändamål. Och om vi upptäcker taggtrådsstängsel över våra vägar, finner vi oss inte i alla inskränkningar av rörelsefriheten utan att klaga? Jo. Vi vet att allt detta sker för Statens skull, för att hindra skadegörare. Och om vi en dag skulle finna, att alla fritidens sysselsättningar måste inskränkas för den nödvändiga militära övningen, att de otaliga lyxkunskaper och lyxfärdigheter som förr ingått i vår uppfostran nu måste lämnas åt sidan för en oundgänglig inriktning på vars och ens specialutbildning till arbetare i den absolut nödvändiga industriens tjänst – har vi skäl att klaga då? Nej, nej, och nej. Vi inser och gillar, att Staten är allt, den enskilde intet. Vi inser och böjer oss för att det mesta av den så kallade ”kulturen” – jag frånräknar då de tekniska kunskaperna – förblir en lyx för tider då ingen fara hotar (tider som kanske aldrig kommer igen). Vad som återstår är det nakna livsuppehället och det alltmer välutvecklade militär- och polisväsendet. Det är statslivets kärna. Allt annat är utanverk.","- I do not, I replied. And do not believe, after all, that I am assuming some kind of civilist superstition, that the State would exist for our sake instead of us existing for the State, as is the case in reality. I just mean that the core of the individual cells' relationship to the state organism lies in the hunger for security. If one day we noticed - I'm not saying we did, but if - that our pea soup became thinner, our soap barely usable, our homes dilapidated, without anyone worrying about it - would we knot? No. We know that well-being is not a value in itself, that our sacrifices serve a higher purpose. And if we discover barbed wire fencing across our roads, do we not find ourselves in all the restrictions of freedom of movement without complaining? Yes. We know that all this is happening for the sake of the State, to prevent pests. And if one day we find that all leisure pursuits must be curtailed for the necessary military exercise, that the innumerable luxuries and luxuries formerly part of our upbringing must now be set aside for an indispensable focus on each and every one's special training for workers in the absolutely necessary industry service - do we have reason to complain then? No, no, and no. We realize and like that the State is everything, the individual nothing. We realize and bow to the fact that most of the so-called ""culture"" - I then deduct the technical knowledge - remains a luxury for times when no danger threatens (times that may never come again).

No. We know that luxury is of no value in itself, that our sacrifices serve a higher purpose.

No, no, and no. We realize and approve that the State is everything, the individual nothing. We realize and bow before the fact that most of so-called “culture” – I except the technical sciences – remains a luxury for epochs when no danger threatens (epochs that perhaps will never come again).

If one day we should notice—I do not say we have done so but if—if we should notice that our pea soup is thinner, our soap hardly usable, our apartments ready to fall to pieces, and nobody doing anything about it—would we then complain? No! We know that comfortable living is of no value in itself, that our sacrifices serve a higher purpose. If we should discover barbed wire across our streets, wouldn't we endure all restrictions to our freedom of movement without complaint? Of course we would! We would know that this was done for the State's sake, to stop enemies. And if one day we should discover that all our free-time occupations had been curtailed for necessary military duty, that the many expectations and experiences of luxury which were part of our upbringing, now must be put aside for an unavoidable concentration of everyone's special skills in essential industry—would we then have reason to complain? No, no, and again no! We realize, and approve, that the State is all, the individual nothing. We realize and admit that most of the so-called 'culture'—aside from purely technical knowledge—must remain a luxury for times when no danger threatens (times which perhaps never will come again).

"– Ja, så såg jag honom växa och börja gå, och under tiden gick jag med Maryl. Sedan jag väl slutat amma honom, såg jag honom ju bara mornar och kvällar, innan jag gick till mitt arbete om morgonen och när jag kom hem om kvällen – men det var så underligt. Jag visste med hela min övertygelse, att han var Statens, att han redan uppfostrades i barnvåningen hela dagen till en blivande medsoldat och att samma uppfostran sedan skulle fortsättas i barnlägret och i ungdomslägret. Frånsett arvsmassan, som jag ju visste var viktig – och i vårt fall fullt i sin ordning, så långt det kunde kontrolleras – och som ju för resten inte heller är ”vår” egendom, eftersom den är ärvd från andra medsoldater före oss – så hade jag alldeles klart för mig, att hans blivande väsen berodde på hans chefer i barnvåningen, i barnlägret, i ungdomslägret, på deras eget exempel och på de regler de följde i sin uppfostran. Men jag kunde inte låta bli att lägga märke till en rad lustiga smådrag, som jag kände igen från dig och från mig själv. Jag lade märke till hans sätt att rynka på näsan, och jag tänkte: Så lustigt, så gjorde jag själv när jag var liten! – På så sätt kom jag tillbaka i min son. Det var en stolt känsla: i honom höll jag nästan på att växa upp till man! Och jag lade märke till hans skratt, som påminner så mycket om ditt. På så sätt fick jag nästan vara med om din barndom. Och hans sätt att vrida på huvudet, du vet, och något i formen på ögonen – – Det var inte konstigt alls, men det gav mig en brottslig känsla av äganderätt. ”Det märks att han är vår”, tänkte jag, ”son”, tillade jag skuldmedvetet, för jag visste ju att det inte var någon lojal känsla. Den var inte det, nej, men den fanns där. Det värsta var att den blev starkare, och allra starkast när det gällde den lilla ofödda jag bar på. – Du minns kanske, att Maryls födelse var komplicerad och tog lång tid? Det är säkert vidskepelse, men jag inbillade mig redan då, och jag har inte kunnat bli kvitt den tanken, att det berodde på att jag var så ovillig att släppa henne ifrån mig. När Ossu föddes, var jag ännu en mor helt i Statens anda, en som bara föder åt Staten. Då Maryl föddes, var jag en självisk, en snål djurhona, en som födde åt sig själv och tyckte hon hade rätt över det hon födde fram. Mitt samvete sa mig, att jag hade orätt, att sådana tankar inte fick tänkas, men inga känslor av skuld och skam kunde driva bort den där girigheten, som hade vaknat i mig. Om jag har några anlag för härsklystnad – de är inte stora, Leo, medge det! – men de finns – så kom de fram under tiden efter Maryls födelse. De korta stunder Ossu var hemma, bestämde jag över honom, härskade över honom så mycket jag kunde, bara för att känna att han ännu var min. Och han lydde – för lär man sig något i barnvåningen, så är det ju först och främst att lyda order, och jag visste, att det åtminstone hade jag rätt till ännu så länge, det hörde till Statens vilja och medsoldaternas fostran. Men det var ju bara förevändningar. Inte var mitt sätt mot Ossu egentligen någon gärd åt Staten. Det var ett försök att ta ut allt av äganderätt som kunde tas ut på den korta tid jag ännu hade honom kvar i hemmet.","- Yes, I saw him grow and start walking, and in the meantime I went with Maryl. After I stopped breastfeeding him, I only saw him mornings and evenings, before I went to work in the morning and when I came home in the evening - but it was so strange. I knew with all my conviction that he was the State, that he was already brought up in the children's apartment all day to a future fellow soldier and that the same upbringing would then be continued in the children's camp and in the youth camp. Apart from the genome, which I knew was important - and in our case fully in order, as far as it could be controlled - and which after all is not ""our"" property, because it is inherited from other fellow soldiers before us - so had I am quite clear to myself that his future essence was due to his bosses in the nursery, in the children's camp, in the youth camp, to their own example and to the rules they followed in their upbringing. But I could not help but notice a series of funny little features, which I recognized from you and from myself. I noticed his way of wrinkling his nose, and I thought: So funny, I did it myself when I was little! - That's how I got back into my son. It was a proud feeling: in him I was almost growing up to be a man! And I noticed his laughter, which is so reminiscent of yours. That way, I almost got to be a part of your childhood. And his way of turning his head, you know, and something in the shape of his eyes - - It was not strange at all, but it gave me a criminal sense of ownership. ""It is noticeable that he is ours"", I thought, ""son"", I added guiltily, because I knew it was not a loyal feeling. It was not, no, but it was there. The worst thing was that it became stronger, and the strongest when it came to the little unborn I was wearing. - Do you remember that Maryl's birth was complicated and took a long time? It is certainly superstition, but I imagined even then, and I have not been able to get rid of the thought that it was because I was so reluctant to let her go. When Ossu was born, I was yet another mother entirely in the spirit of the State, one who only gives birth to the State. When Maryl was born, I was a selfish, stingy female animal, one who gave birth to herself and thought she was right about what she gave birth to. My conscience told me that I was wrong, that such thoughts should not be thought, but no feelings of guilt and shame could drive away that greed that had awakened in me. If I have any predisposition to lust - they are not big, Leo, admit it! - but they exist - so they came in the time after Maryl's birth. The short moments Ossu was at home, I ruled over him, ruled over him as much as I could, just to feel that he was still mine. And he obeyed - because if you learn something in the children's apartment, then it's first and foremost to obey orders, and I knew that at least I was entitled to that so far, it was part of the will of the State and the education of fellow soldiers. But those were just pretexts. My way towards Ossu was not really a blow to the State. It was an attempt to take out all of the property rights that could be taken out in the short time I still had him left at home.","‘Yes, so I saw him grow and begin to walk, and meanwhile I was carrying Maryl. Since I’d more or less finished nursing Ossu, I only saw him in the mornings and evenings, before I went to my job in the morning and when I came home at night – but it was so strange. I knew, with all my conviction, that he belonged to the State, that he was already being trained in the creche all day as a future fellow soldier and that the same training would continue in the children’s camp and the youth camp. Apart from the genetic material, which of course I knew was important – and in our case perfectly in order, as far as it could be verified – and which incidentally isn’t “our” property, either, as it’s inherited from other fellow soldiers before us – I felt absolutely certain that his future character depended on his superiors at the creche, at the children’s camp, at the youth camp, on their own example and on the rules they followed in his training. But I couldn’t help noticing a number of comical traits which I recognized as coming from you and from myself. I noticed his way of wrinkling his nose, and I thought: “That’s so funny, I used to do that when I was little!” In that way, I came back, in my son. It was a proud feeling: in him I was almost growing up to be a man! And I noticed his laugh, which reminds me so much of yours. In that way I almost managed to be present at your childhood. And his way of twisting his head, you know, and something about the shape of his eyes … There wasn’t anything odd about it, but it gave me a criminal sense of ownership. “You can see that he’s ours,” I thought – “our son”, I added guiltily, as I knew that this wasn’t a loyal feeling. No, it certainly was not, but it was there. The worst thing was that it was getting stronger, and strongest of all in connection with the little unborn child I was carrying … Perhaps you remember that Maryl’s birth was complicated and took a long time? It’s probably superstition, but even back then I imagined, and I couldn’t get rid of the thought, that it was because I was so reluctant to let her go. When Ossu was born I was still a mother entirely in the spirit of the State, a mother who only gave birth for the State. When Maryl was born I was a selfish, grasping female creature, one that only gave birth for herself and thought she had a right to what she gave birth to. My conscience told me that I was in the wrong, that such thoughts were impermissible, but no feelings of guilt and shame could drive away the greed that had woken in me. If I have any possessive tendencies – they’re not very strong, Leo, you must admit! – but they’re there – they emerged during the time after Maryl was born. During the brief hours when Ossu was at home I bossed him around, dominated him as much as I could, just so as to feel that he was still mine. And he obeyed – for if one learns anything at the creche, it’s above all to obey orders, and I knew that for the time being, at least, I still had a right to that , it was part of the State’s will and the training of fellow soldiers. But those were just excuses. My way of treating Ossu wasn’t really a token of regard for the State. It was an attempt to get as much of a sense of possession as I could in the short time I still had him at home.","""Well, I watched him grow, and start to walk, and meanwhile I was carrying Maryl. When I stopped nursing him I only saw him mornings and evenings, before I went to work and after I got home, but it seemed so strange; my convictions on every point told me that he belonged to the State, that already he was being educated all day long in the kindergarten to become a fellow-soldier, and that the same education later would be continued in the child camp and in the youth camp. Aside from his inherited background which I knew was important—and in our case all right as far as could be checked—and which after all isn't 'our' possession since it has been inherited from other fellow-soldiers before us—I felt quite sure that his future character depended on his chiefs in the kindergarten, in the child camp, in the youth camp, on their personal examples and the rules they followed in rearing him. But I could not help but notice a great many amusing traits which I recognized from you and me. I noticed his way of wrinkling his nose and I thought: how funny—I did the same when I was little! In that way I lived again in my son. It was a proud feeling: in him I was almost growing up to be a man! And I noticed his laughter, so much like your own. In that way I almost participated in your childhood. And his way of turning his head, as you know, and something in the shape of his eyes . . . It wasn't unusual at all, but it gave me an unlawful feeling of right of possession. ' One can see he is ours,' I thought; 'our son,' I added, guiltily, for of course I knew it was not a loyal feeling. No, it was not, yet there it was. And worse, it grew stronger, and strongest of all when it concerned the unborn one I was carrying. Perhaps you remember that Maryl's birth was complicated and took a long time? I am sure this is superstition, but I imagined already then—and I have not been able to get rid of that thought—that it was caused by my unwillingness to let her leave me. When Ossu was born I was still a mother fully in the State's spirit, one bearing for the State only. When Maryl was born I was selfish, a greedy beast-female, who bore for herself and felt she had a right over what she had borne. My conscience told me I was wrong, that such thoughts were not allowed, but no feelings of guilt and shame could erase that greediness which had come to life in me. If I have any inclination to dominate—you must admit, Leo, it is not great! but it is there—it came to the fore at the time of Maryl's birth. Those short moments when Ossu was at home, it was I who decided for him, ruled over him as much as I could, if only to make me feel that he was still mine. And he obeyed, for if anything is learnt in the kindergarten it is above all to obey orders, and I knew I had the right to give orders still for a while, this being part of the State's will and the education of the fellow-soldiers. But I felt it was only pretense; my attitude toward Ossu was really not in the State's behalf; it was an attempt on my part to insist on all the right of possession I could get during the short time I still had him at home."

"Medan han satt kvar och väntade på verkningarna, studerade vi hans kort, som han lagt ifrån sig på bordet. Födelseår, kön, rastyp, kroppstyp, temperamentstyp, blodtyp och så vidare, egendomligheter i släkten, genomgångna sjukdomar (en hel rad naturligtvis, så gott som alla ådragna genom experiment). Det nödvändiga skrev jag av i mitt eget nya och omsorgsfullt upplagda kortsystem. Det enda som förvirrade mig var födelseåret, men det hade nog sin riktighet, och jag påminde mig att jag redan under min assistenttid hade hört och konstaterat, att försökspersonerna i Frivilliga offertjänsten i regel såg tio år äldre ut än de verkligen var. – Då detta var gjort, vände jag mig på nytt till n:r 135, som började vrida sig i stolen.","While he sat waiting for the effects, we studied his cards, which he laid down on the table. Year of birth, sex, breed type, body type, temperament type, blood type and so on, peculiarities in the family, past diseases (a whole range of course, just about all incurred through experiments). I wrote off the necessary in my own new and carefully laid out card system. The only thing that confused me was the year of birth, but it probably had its accuracy, and I reminded myself that I had already heard during my time as an assistant and stated that the subjects in the Voluntary Sacrifice Service usually looked ten years older than they really were. When this was done, I turned again to No. 135, which began to turn in the chair.","While he remained seated, waiting for the effects of the drug to take hold, we studied his card, which he had put down on the table. Year of birth, sex, racial type, body type, temperament type, blood type, and so on, peculiarities in the family, illnesses (a whole series of them, nearly all caused by experiments). I copied the essential information into my new and carefully arranged card system. The only thing that caused me some uncertainty was the year of birth, but it was probably correct, and I recalled that even back in my days as an assistant I had heard and observed that the test subjects in the Voluntary Sacrifice Service generally looked ten years older than they really were. When this was done I turned again to No. 135, who was beginning to twist and turn in his chair.","While waiting for the injection to take effect we studied his card which he had placed on the table. Year of birth, sex, race, type of body, type of temperament, blood type, and so on, peculiarities in the family, sicknesses (quite a few, obviously nearly all caused by experiments). I copied the essential information for my own new, especially prepared card index. The only statement that confused me was his year of birth, but perhaps it was correct; I recalled that ever since my assistantship days I had noticed that all test-persons in the Voluntary Sacrificial Service looked ten years older than they actually were. When I was finished with the card index I turned again to No. 135, who had started to squirm in his chair."
"– Hur känns det? frågade jag uppmuntrande, medan innehållet i sprutan minskades. Fortfarande från ordningsföreskrifterna visste jag ju, att man gärna borde fråga försökspersonen själv så mycket som möjligt, det gav honom en känsla av likställdhet och höjde honom på visst sätt över smärtorna.","- How does it feel? I asked encouragingly, while the contents of the syringe were reduced. Still from the rules of procedure, I knew that you should ask the subject yourself as much as possible, it gave him a sense of equality and raised him in a certain way over the pain.","‘How does that feel?’ I asked, encouragingly, while the contents of the syringe dwindled. Again from the rules and regulations I knew that the test subject should be asked as many questions as possible, as it gave him a sense of equality and raised him above the pain in a certain way.","""How does it feel? "" I asked, encouragingly, as the contents of the needle diminished. Still following the regulations, I wished to ask the test-person himself as much as possible, to instill in him a feeling of equality and thus in a way elevate him above the feeling of pain."
"Jag var så uppspelt, att det föll sig svårt för mig att börja något nytt under de tio minuter som ännu återstod av arbetstiden. I stället fuskade jag en smula – jag tror nästan för första gången i mitt liv – och började ställa bort apparaterna i förtid, långsamt och försiktigt, medan jag sneglade genom glasväggarna åt båda sidor för att se om någon gav akt på mig. Så fort signalklockan förkunnade att arbetet var slut för dagen, skyndade jag ut genom de långa laboratoriekorridorerna som en av de första i strömmen. Hastigt duschade jag, bytte arbetskläderna mot fritidsuniformen, sprang in i paternosterhissen och stod efter några ögonblick uppe på gatan. Eftersom vi fått vår bostad i mitt arbetsdistrikt, hade vi nämligen ovanjordslicens där, och jag njöt alltid av att sträcka på mig i det fria.","I was so excited that it was difficult for me to start something new during the ten minutes that were still left of working hours. Instead, I cheated a bit - I think almost for the first time in my life - and started putting the devices away prematurely, slowly and carefully, while I glanced through the glass walls on both sides to see if anyone was paying attention to me. As soon as the signal bell announced that the work was over for the day, I hurried out through the long laboratory corridors as one of the first in the stream. I took a quick shower, changed my work clothes for my leisure uniform, ran into the paternoster lift and stood up on the street after a few moments. Since we got our home in my work district, we had an above-ground license there, and I always enjoyed stretching in the open air.","Such was my elation that during the ten minutes that still remained of my working hours I found it hard to make a start on anything new. Instead, I cheated a little – for the first time in my life, I believe – and began to put the apparatus away early, slowly and carefully, while stealing a glance through the glass walls on both sides to see if anyone had noticed me. As soon as the bell rang to announce that work was over for the day, I hurried out through the long laboratory corridors, where I was one of the first in the stream. I quickly showered, changed out of my work clothes and into my leisure uniform, jumped into the paternoster lift and a few moments later was up on the street. As our apartment had been allocated in the district where my work was, we had surface permits there, and I always enjoyed the chance to stretch my legs in the fresh air.","I felt in such high spirits it seemed difficult for me to start anything new during the ten minutes still left of my working period.

"Ögonblicket var inne. Vi lyssnade och gav akt. Mitt hjärta dunkade. Om nu mannen inte sade något alls? Om han nu inte hade något som han gick och teg med?

"Den trötta och avskilda kvinnan kom mig på något sätt nära, utan att jag visste varför. Förståndsmässigt insåg jag, att förtjänade redan de båda ungdomarna avund, så gjorde hon det i än högre grad; hennes offervilliga hjältemod var större än deras, och därmed också hennes styrka och berömmelse. De ungas känsla skulle trots allt snart blekna bort och ersättas av någon ny flamma, och försökte de hålla kvar minnet, skulle det ändå snart upphöra att svida och bli enbart vackert och ljust och en tillgång i vardagens enahanda. Moderns offer kunde vara sådant att det blev nytt för var dag. Jag kände ju själv till en sådan saknad, som var svår nog, fast jag säkert skulle lyckas övervinna den en dag – jag menar saknaden efter Ossu, min äldste, och ändå kom han hem två gånger i veckan, och jag hoppades verkligen att jag skulle få behålla honom i Kemistaden n:r 4, också sedan han blivit vuxen. Visst anade jag, att detta var en alltför personlig inställning till de små medsoldater man skänkt Staten, och öppet skulle jag aldrig velat visa den, men i hemlighet göt den ett visst skimmer över mitt liv, kanske inte minst därför att den var så fullkomligt hemlig och behärskad. Samma plåga och tillgång var det väl jag kände igen hos kvinnan, också samma förtegna behärskning. Jag kunde inte låta bli att tänka mig in i hennes ställe: hur hon aldrig mer skulle få se sin dotter, knappast höra något från henne heller, eftersom posten gallrade privatbreven allt mer och mer hårdhänt, så att numera bara verkligt viktiga underrättelser, kort och sakligt framställda och försedda med vederbörliga verifikationer, släpptes fram till adressaten. Och en något förmäten och individualromantisk tanke kom för mig, om ett slags ”ersättning”, som borde tillfalla medsoldaterna, då de offrade sin sentimentala tillvaro för Staten, och den borde bestå i det högsta och rikaste man kunde eftersträva: i ära. Då äran var tröst nog och övernog för stympade krigare, varför skulle den inte också vara det för var och en medsoldat, som kände sig stympad invärtes? Det var en rörig och romantisk tanke, och senare på kvällen födde den en överilad handling.","The tired and separated woman came close to me in some way, without me knowing why. Mentally, I realized that if the two young people already deserved envy, she did so to an even greater degree; her sacrificial heroism was greater than theirs, and thus also her strength and fame. After all, the young people's feelings would soon fade away and be replaced by a new flame, and if they tried to keep the memory, it would still soon cease to sting and become only beautiful and bright and an asset in everyday life. The mother's sacrifice could be such that it became new every day. I myself knew of such a loss, which was difficult enough, though I would surely manage to overcome it one day - I mean the loss of Ossu, my eldest, and yet he came home twice a week, and I really hoped that I would be allowed to keep him in Kemistaden no. 4, even after he has grown up. Of course I suspected that this was too personal an attitude towards the little fellow soldiers given to the State, and openly I would never have wanted to show it, but secretly it cast a certain shimmer over my life, perhaps not least because it was so completely secret and controlled. The same torment and asset was what I recognized in the woman, also the same concealed mastery. I could not help but imagine in her place: how she would never again see her daughter, hardly hear anything from her either, as the post office thinned the private letters more and more harshly, so that now only really important intelligence, cards and objectively produced and provided with appropriate verifications, was released to the addressee. And a somewhat presumptuous and individual-romantic thought came to me, of a kind of ""compensation,"" which should accrue to the fellow soldiers, when they sacrificed their sentimental existence for the State, and it should consist of the highest and richest one could strive for: in honor. Since the honor was comforting enough and overwhelmed for mutilated warriors, why should it not also be for every fellow soldier who felt mutilated internally? It was a messy and romantic thought, and later in the evening it gave birth to a hasty act.","In some way I felt close to the tired and isolated woman, though I could not work out why. In rational terms I could see that if the two young people were deserving of envy, she deserved it to an even higher degree: her self-sacrificing valour was greater than theirs and with it also her strength and eminence. The young people’s emotion would, in spite of everything, soon fade away and be replaced by some new ardour, and if they tried to preserve the memory, it would soon cease to be painful and become merely beautiful and radiant, a resource in the monotony of the everyday. Their mother’s sacrifice might be so great that it renewed itself each day. After all, I myself knew such a loss, heavy enough, though one day I would probably succeed in overcoming it – I mean the loss of Ossu, my eldest, and yet he came home twice a week, and I really hoped I would be able to keep him in Chemistry City No. 4, even when he was grown up. Of course I knew that this attitude to the small fellow soldiers one gave to the State was of too personal a nature, and I would never have liked to show it openly, but in secret it cast a certain aura over my life, perhaps not least because it was so entirely secret and controlled. No doubt it was the same torment and resource that I recognized in the woman, and also the same silent self-control. I could not help putting myself in her place: she would never be able to see her daughter again, not even hear from her, as the post office censored private letters with ever increasing severity, so that nowadays only really important news, written in a brief and objective style and accompanied by the proper verifications, were let through to the addressee. And a somewhat presumptuous and individualistic-romantic thought came to me, about a kind of ‘compensation’ that should accrue to fellow soldiers for having sacrificed their sentimental life to the State, and ought to consist of the loftiest and richest thing one could strive for: honour. As honour was consolation enough and more than enough for wounded warriors, why should it not also be so for every fellow soldier who felt wounded inwardly? It was a muddled and romantic thought, and later that evening it led to an incautious act.","This weary and isolated woman seemed in some way to come close to me, without my knowing why. Rationally I understood that if the young couple deserved my envy, she had it to a still higher degree ; her self-sacrificing courage was greater than theirs, and with it also her strength and distinction. The feelings of the young ones would, in spite of all, soon pale away to be supplanted by some new flame, and if they might attempt to retain the memory it would soon cease to smart and turn only sweet and beautiful, something of value in life's monotony. The mother's sacrifice could be such that it was renewed every day. I myself was experiencing such a loss, difficult enough although I felt sure I would conquer it in time; I mean the loss of Ossu, my eldest one, and yet he came home for a visit twice a week; and moreover, I hoped I might keep him in Chemistry City No. 4 even after he was grown. Of course I felt that this was too selfish an attitude towards the small fellow-soldier I had contributed to the State, and I would never have dared show my feeling openly, but in secret it spread a certain luster over my life, perhaps not less because it was so secret and so well controlled. It must have been the same pain with its quality of value that I recognized in the woman, even the same silent self-control. I could not help imagining myself in her place: how she would never again be allowed to see [p. 22] her daughter, possibly never again hear from her, since the postal authorities weeded out private letters ever more greedily, so that by now only really important messages, short and to the point and with the necessary verifications, were permitted to reach the addressee. And then a somewhat presumptuous and individualistic-romantic thought struck me, about some sort of ""compensation"" that should be given our fellow-soldiers for sacrificing their sentimental existence to the State; and, I thought, it should consist of the highest and best that man might strive for: honor. Since honor was comfort enough, and more than enough, for maimed soldiers in the field, why should it not be enough also for every fellow-soldier who felt maimed inwardly? It was a confused and romantic thought, and later in the evening it was to cause a rash act."

"Med all makt förkastade jag tanken på Ökenstaden, kanske inte så mycket därför att den var omöjlig som därför att den var motbjudande. På en gång motbjudande och lockande. Det bjöd mig emot att tro på en stad, även om den låg i ruiner, även om den gapade med faror av gas och bakterier, även om de asociala individer, som där sökt sin usla tillflykt, smög sig mellan stenarna jagade av ångest och fasa och då och då föll offer för den lurande döden – men ändå en stad, dit Statens makt inte räckte, ett område utanför gemenskapen. Det lockande i tanken – vem kunde säga vad det bestod i? Vidskepelse är ofta lockande, tänkte jag hånfullt. Den är ett skrin, där man förvarar sina lurande frestelser som klenoder: en djup kvinnostämma; en skälvning i en mansröst; en stund, som man aldrig har upplevt, av fullkomlig hängivenhet; en förkastlig dröm om personligt förtroende utan gräns; ett hopp om släckt törst och djup vila.","With all my might I rejected the idea of the Desert City, perhaps not so much because it was impossible as because it was disgusting.

It disgusted me to believe in a city, even though it lay in ruins, even though it gaped with dangers of gas and bacteria, even though the antisocial individuals, who sought refuge there, snuck between the rocks chased by anxiety and horror and from time to time victims of the lurking death fell - but still a city, where the power of the State was not enough, an area outside the community. The allure of the thought - who could say what it consisted of? Superstition is often enticing, I thought scornfully. It is a casket, where one keeps one's deceptive temptations as treasures: a deep female voice; a tremor in a male voice; a moment, which one has never experienced, of complete devotion; a reprehensible dream of personal trust without limit; a hope of quenched thirst and deep rest.","With all my might I rejected the idea of the Desert City, perhaps less because it was impossible than because it was repellent.

"Jag hade slumrat till, då jag kände en lätt stöt på armbågen. Där stod konduktören och serverade mig kvällsmat – också det var det sörjt för. Jag såg på mitt armbandsur: vi hade redan flugit i fem timmar och var tydligen ännu ett gott stycke från målet, eftersom vi inte kunde vänta med maten tills vi kom fram. Jag räknade rätt: vi hade tre timmar kvar. Om man inte bara vetat tiden, utan också planets hastighet, kunde man lätt räknat ut avståndet mellan Kemistaden n:r 4 och den ort vi färdades till, vilken den nu var. Lyckligtvis hölls planets hastighet strängt hemlig, så att inga spioner kunde dra några geografiska slutsatser. Det enda man kunde ana var att hastigheten var mycket hög och avståndet alltså – mycket stort. Riktningen kunde vi naturligtvis inte heller sluta oss till; att det var svalt, till och med kallt efter Kemistadens begrepp, betydde ju ingenting annat än att vi var högt uppe.","I had fallen asleep when I felt a slight jolt on my elbow. There the conductor stood and served me supper - that was also provided for. I looked at my wristwatch: we had already flown for five hours and were apparently still a good distance from the finish, as we could not wait with the food until we arrived. I counted correctly: we had three hours left. If you not only knew the time, but also the speed of the plane, you could easily calculate the distance between Kemistaden no. 4 and the place we traveled to, which it was now. Fortunately, the speed of the plane was kept strictly secret, so that no spies could draw any geographical conclusions. The only thing one could guess was that the speed was very high and the distance - very large. Of course, we could not agree with the direction either; that it was cool, even cold according to the concept of the City of Chemistry, meant nothing more than that we were high up.","I had nodded off when I felt a gentle nudge at my elbow. The flight attendant stood there, serving the evening meal – that, too, was taken care of. I looked at my wrist watch: we had already been flying for five hours and clearly still had some way to go, as the serving of the meal indicated. My calculation was correct: we still had three hours to go. With a knowledge not only of the time needed for the journey but also of the speed of the plane one could have easily worked out the distance between Chemistry City No. 4 and our destination, whatever it might be, but fortunately the speed of the plane was kept strictly secret, so that no spies could draw geographical conclusions. All one could assume was that the speed was very great, and the distance likewise. As for the direction, we could of course draw no conclusions about that: the fact that the air was cool, even cold, by Chemistry City standards, simply meant that we were travelling at some height.","I had dozed off when I felt a light nudge on my elbow; it was the conductor, serving our evening meal—this too had been thought of. I looked at my watch; we had been in the air five hours and must apparently still have some distance to go since supper could not be put off until arrival. My assumption was correct: it took another three hours. If I had known the speed of the plane as well as I knew the time I could easily have figured out the distance from Chemistry City No. 4, and our place of destination, whatever it might be. Fortunately the speed was a closely guarded secret to prevent possible spies from drawing geographical conclusions. The only thing one might deduce was that the speed was very great and the distance, in consequence, great also. Naturally we could draw no conclusions as to the direction; the fact that it was cool, even cold in comparison with Chemistry City No. 4, only meant that we traveled at a great height."
"– Ni behöver inte göra så många omsvep, bäste medsoldat, sade han lågt och långsamt.

"Han måste ju ändå ha vetat vad jag menade, det var ju inte en fri uppfinning av mig, detta med gemenskapen. Varenda medsoldat fick redan som barn lära sig skillnaden mellan lägre och högre liv – det lägre okomplicerat och odifferentierat, till exempel de encelliga djuren och växterna, det högre komplicerat och mångfaldigt differentierat, till exempel människokroppen i sin fina och välfungerande sammansatthet. Varenda medsoldat fick också lära sig, att det var precis detsamma med samhällsformerna: från en planlös hord hade samhällskroppen utvecklat sig till den högst organiserade och differentierade av alla former: vår nuvarande Världsstat. Från individualism till kollektivism – från ensamhet till gemenskap, så hade vägen varit för denna jättelika och heliga organism, i vilken den enskilde bara var en cell utan annan betydelse än att den tjänade organismens helhet. Så mycket visste varenda ungdom med barnlägret bakom sig, och så mycket borde då också Rissen veta. Dessutom borde han förstått vad som inte var så svårt att förstå: att kallocainet var ett nödvändigt led i hela denna utveckling, eftersom det vidgade den stora gemenskapen också till det inre, som man förut behållit för sig själv. Förstod Rissen verkligen inte något så logiskt, eller ville han inte förstå?","He must have known what I meant anyway, it was not a free invention of mine, this with the community. Every child already learned as a child the difference between lower and higher life - the lower uncomplicated and undifferentiated, for example the unicellular animals and plants, the higher complicated and manifold differentiated, for example the human body in its fine and well-functioning composition. Every fellow soldier was also taught that it was exactly the same with the forms of society: from a planless horde, the body of society had developed into the most organized and differentiated of all forms: our present World State. From individualism to collectivism - from loneliness to community, the way had been for this huge and sacred organism, in which the individual was only a cell with no other meaning than that it served the whole organism. Every single young person with the children's camp behind them knew so much, and Rissen should also know that much. In addition, he should have understood what was not so difficult to understand: that callocaine was a necessary part of all this development, because it also extended the great community to the interior, which it had previously kept to itself.

Each fellow soldier also had to learn that it was exactly the same with the forms of society: from an aimless horde the societal body had developed into the most highly organized and differentiated of all forms: our present World State.

That much was known by every young person who had attended the children’s camp, and that much Rissen also ought to know. Moreover, he ought to have understood something that was not so difficult to understand: that Kallocain was a necessary step in the whole of this development, as it expanded the community to the inner realm that people had hitherto kept to themselves.

"Även om inte hennes lena värme och hennes doft, som påminde om teblad, hade nått mig i våg på våg under vår gemensamma filt, skulle jag den kvällen ha längtat efter henne, efter en närmare närhet än den som lätta beröringar kan ge. Åren hade förändrat mig. I min ungdom var mina sinnen ett slags bihang, en fordrande följeslagare, som fick mättas för att jag skulle bli av med honom och kunna syssla med annat, också ett stolt verktyg för lust, men inte riktigt en del av det jag på allvar kallade mig själv. Nu var det inte längre så. Doft och lenhet och lust var inte längre det enda jag ville ha. Målet för mina uppflammande sinnen var något mycket mer svåråtkomligt, det var den Linda, som vissa korta minuter skymtade bakom de orörliga vidöppna ögonen, bakom den spända röda bågen till mun, hon som hade skymtat i kväll i sitt trötta tonfall, i sina kloka lugna råd. Och medan pulsarna arbetade upp sig i ådrorna, vände jag mig på andra sidan och kvävde en suck. Jag sade mig, att vad jag ville av samlivet mellan en man och en kvinna var vidskepelse och ingenting annat, lika mycket vidskepelse som när forntidens vildar åt sina modiga fienders hjärta för att bli delaktiga av deras mod. Det fanns ingen magisk akt, som kunde ge mig nyckeln och äganderätten till den lustgård Linda undanhöll mig. Och vad tjänade alltsammans då till!","Even if her gentle warmth and her scent, reminiscent of tea leaves, had not reached me in waves under our common blanket, I would have longed for her that evening, for a closeness closer than the one that light touches can give. The years had changed me. In my youth, my senses were a kind of appendage, a demanding companion, which had to be satiated so that I could get rid of him and be able to do other things, also a proud tool for desire, but not really part of what I seriously called myself self. Now it was no longer so. Smell and smoothness and lust were no longer the only thing I wanted. The target of my inflamed senses was something much more inaccessible, it was Linda, who for a few brief minutes glimpsed behind the motionless wide-open eyes, behind the tense red arch to her mouth, she who had glimpsed tonight in her tired tone, in her wise calm afford. And while the pulses worked up in my veins, I turned to the other side and suffocated a sigh. I told myself that what I wanted from the cohabitation between a man and a woman was superstition and nothing else, as much superstition as when the savages of antiquity ate the hearts of their brave enemies to partake of their courage. There was no magic act that could give me the key and ownership of the garden Linda withheld from me. And what did it all mean then!","Even if her soft warmth and her fragrance, which was reminiscent of tea leaves, had not reached me in wave after wave under our shared duvet, I would have longed for her that night, for a closer closeness than gentle touching can give. The years had altered me. In my youth my senses were a kind of appendage, a demanding hanger-on who must be satisfied so I could get rid of him and be able to focus on other things, also a proud implement for pleasure, but not really a part of what I seriously called ‘myself’. Now it was no longer like that. Fragrance and softness and pleasure were no longer the only things I wanted. The object of my flaring senses was something much harder to attain; it was the Linda who, for certain brief moments, I could glimpse behind the motionless wide-open eyes, behind the tensed red bow of a mouth, she who had let herself be glimpsed tonight, in her tone of tiredness, in her wise, calm counsel. And while the pulse-beats surged in my veins, I turned over on my other side and suppressed a sigh. I told myself that what I wanted from cohabitation between a man and a woman was merely a superstition, and nothing else, just as much of a superstition as when the savages of ancient times ate the hearts of their brave enemies in order to partake of their courage. There was no magical act that could give me the key and the title deeds to the paradise Linda was keeping from me. So then what was the point of it all?","Even if her soft warmth, and her fragrance, resembling [p. 29] tea leaves, had not reached me in wave after wave under our common blanket I would that evening have longed for her, for a closer closeness than simple physical contact can give.

Now it was no longer so. Fragrance and softness and pleasure were no longer the only things I wished for; the goal of my aroused senses was something much more unattainable, it was the real Linda who at certain brief moments was discernible behind the immobile, wide-open eyes, behind the tense, red bow of her mouth, the one I had sensed this evening in her tired speech, in her wise, calm advice. And while my pulse worked febrilely, I turned over on the other side and suppressed a sigh. I told myself that what I hoped for from the cohabitation of man and woman was a mere superstition and nothing else, as much superstition as when the savages of old devoured the hearts of their brave enemies to acquire their courage. There was no magic ritual which could give me the key and possession of the paradise Linda kept from me. And what was the use of anything then!"

"Allt detta låg under ytan och grodde. Till det yttre fick jag alldeles för mycket att göra för att ägna min tid åt grubbel. Tuareg hade redan givit order om att det vanliga domstolsförfarandet skulle ersättas med kallocainundersökning, och folk från hela Världsstaten stod redan i kö för att delta i de nya kurser vi fått i uppdrag att ordna. Vi överflyttades – tills vidare, hette det – i polisens tjänst och fick våra lokaler i polishuset. Karrek lät alla häktade vandra direkt till våra lärosalar för att på en gång rannsakas och tjäna som övningsmaterial; det fanns därför alltid en högre militär eller polis med som domare, och protokoll fördes både av polissekreterare och av sådana sekreterare som kursen utsett.","All this lay beneath the surface and germinated.

We were transferred - until further notice, it was called - in the service of the police and got our premises in the police house. Karrek let all the detainees walk directly to our classrooms to be examined at once and serve as exercise material; there was therefore always a senior military or police officer as a judge, and minutes were kept both by the police secretary and by such secretaries as the course appointed.","All of this lay beneath the surface, festering.

Tuareg had already given orders that the ordinary work of the courts should be replaced with Kallocain-testing, and people from all over the World State were already standing in line to enrol in the new courses we had been told to arrange. We were transferred – temporarily, it was said – to the police service and were given premises in police headquarters. Karrek had all the remand prisoners brought directly to our lecture rooms for the dual purpose of being investigated and of serving as practice material; there was therefore always a higher-ranking military or police officer present as judge, and the records were kept both by police secretaries and whatever secretaries were assigned to the course.","All this was seething under the surface. But externally I had too much to do to devote my time to worries.

We were transferred—temporarily, it was said—to the police department and were given space in the police department complex.

Men för den öde tomhet, som vidgade sig inom mig själv, fanns inget annat namn än meningslöshet.","My desire for adventure was satisfied. What I experienced in the capital was varied and instructive enough that I would never forget it: the callocaine fire test before Tuareg, my visit to the Seventh Bureau, and last but not least the psychological film discussion, for which I was not mature. No, I was certainly not ready for it. Inside me it lay gnawing like a secret evil. Still, I had no objection to a single statement - I had to leave the purely psychological statements to the professionals to review - and I was terribly ashamed every time I thought of my unjustified and stupid outcome. So when I had completely taken a stand, why would it continue to torment me? I had never heard it stated so clearly, so objectively, how objectively the value of each fellow soldier's contribution can be considered - and yet it felt as if the inconvenience of being had become so enormous and the meaning of it all so vanishingly small.

No, I was truly not ready for it. It lay within me and gnawed at me like a hidden wound. Yet there was not a single statement to which I had any objection – the purely psychological assertions I had to leave to the professionals in the field – and I felt horribly ashamed each time I thought of my unwarranted and stupid interjection.

No, indeed, I was not ripe for it; it stayed with me and gnawed like a hidden ulcer. Yet, there was nothing I could object to in a single statement—the purely psychological assertions I must leave to the experts—and I felt terribly humiliated every time I thought of my uncalled-for and stupid interruption. Since I had fully understood their point of view, why, then, did I continue to be tortured by it? Probably never before had I heard it stated so clearly, so to the point, how objectively the value of each fellow-soldier's contribution must be seen; and yet I felt as if the troubles of existence were gigantic and the meaning of it all was evanescent and trivial. I knew this was a false and unhealthy view, and I tried to convince myself with all possible arguments.

"Vi fick vänta på Tuareg. Då man är van vid att varenda minut både natt och dag har sin orubbliga bestämmelse, blir en sådan tom tidrymd otroligt plågsam, men allting, också det värsta, har sin övergång, och till sist infann sig polisministern, så att vi kunde få tillfälle att visa vad kallocainet dög till. Jag hade knappast trott, att jag skulle behöva ta mig samman så hårt för att inte darra på handen, när ärmen veks upp på en orakad förbrytartyp i stolen framför mig, men Tuaregs små björnögon stack en i nacken så vasst, att man nästan kände sig själv placerad under sprutspetsen. I alla fall gick allt som det skulle. Mellan en rad svåra oanständigheter, som fick polisministern att dra på sin fylliga mun och därför lättade stämningen något, avlade den undersökte fullständig bekännelse inte bara om det inbrott han var anklagad för men hittills inte kunnat överbevisas om, utan också om en del andra förbrytelser, som han utfört ensam eller tillsammans med andra. Alla namn och närmare omständigheter uppgav han utan att blinka. Tuaregs näsborrar vidgade sig av välbehag.","We had to wait for Tuareg. As one is accustomed to every minute both night and day having its unshakable destiny, such an empty space of time becomes incredibly painful, but everything, even the worst, has its transition, and finally the Minister of Police appeared, so that we could have the opportunity to show what the callocaine did. I had hardly thought that I would have to pull myself together so hard so as not to tremble on my hand, when the sleeve was rolled up on an unshaven type of criminal in the chair in front of me, but Tuareg's small bear eyes stuck one in the neck so sharply that one almost felt itself placed under the spray tip. In any case, everything went as it should. Between a series of serious indecencies, which made the Minister of Police pull his full mouth and therefore eased the mood somewhat, the investigated made a full confession not only about the burglary he was accused of but so far could not be convinced of, but also about some other crimes, which he performed alone or with others. All names and details he stated without blinking. Tuareg's nostrils dilated with pleasure.","We had to wait for Tuareg. When you are used to each and every minute of the day and night having an unshakable purpose, an empty space of this kind becomes extremely trying; but all things, even the worst, eventually pass, and at last the police minister arrived, so that we could demonstrate the uses to which Kallocain could be put. I had not really thought I would need to make such a determined effort not to let my hand tremble when an unshaven criminal’s sleeve was rolled up in front of me, but Tuareg’s little bear-eyes drilled into the back of my head so sharply that it almost felt like having an injection. However, everything went according to plan. Amid a stream of crude profanities that made the police minister’s fleshy mouth twitch and thus lightened the mood somewhat, the subject made a full confession to the burglary with which he was charged but for which he had so far escaped punishment due to a lack of evidence. He also admitted to a large number of other crimes he had committed alone or with others, producing all the names and particulars without blinking. Tuareg’s nostrils flared with relish.","We had to wait for Tuareg. To somebody accustomed to a definite use for each and every minute, day and night, such an empty time-lapse can be extremely painful; but everything, even the worst, will pass, and at last the police minister came, so that we could show him what the Kallocain was worth. I had hardly imagined that I would have to control myself so intensely in order not to let my hand tremble when the sleeve was turned up on the arm of an unshaven, criminal type in the chair before me, but Tuareg's narrow bear-eyes pierced me in the back so sharply that I almost felt it was I who was getting the needle. But all progressed as it should; between strings of indecencies, which brought a slight smile to the police minister's full lips and thus eased the tension a little, the test-person not only made a full confession of the crime he was accused of but so far had escaped conviction for, he also admitted a great many other crimes, perpetrated alone or with others. Without hesitation he divulged all names and details. Tuareg's nostrils quivered with pleasure."

"Då jag vaknade till medvetande om mig själv igen, satt jag på muren kring takterrassen och frös, inte av köld, eftersom det var en varm, nästan het natt, utan av stark sinnesrörelse. Vinden fläktade ännu, fast svagare, och jag visste att den inte föddes ur rymdens mörker utan ur luftlagren nära jorden. Stjärnorna tindrade ännu lika klart, och jag påminde mig, att deras pulsslag av ljus var en synvilla. Men det betydde ingenting. Vad jag såg och hörde kunde vara hägringar; det hade ändå bara lånat sig till form åt ett annat världsallt, ett världsallt inifrån – där jag var van att möta ett torrt, skrumpet skal, som jag kallade mig själv. Jag tyckte att jag hade rört vid det levande djup, som Rissen ropat efter och Linda känt och sett. ”Vet du inte, att här rinner livet upp”, hade kvinnan sagt i min dröm. Jag trodde henne, och jag var viss om att vad som helst kunde ske.","When I woke up to myself again, I sat on the wall around the roof terrace and froze, not from the cold, because it was a hot, almost hot night, but from strong emotion. The wind was still blowing, though weaker, and I knew that it was not born from the darkness of space but from the layers of air near the earth. The stars still twinkled just as clearly, and I reminded myself that their pulse of light was an illusion. But that meant nothing. What I saw and heard could be mirages; it had still only lent itself to the shape of another universe, a universe from within - where I was used to facing a dry, shrunken shell, as I called myself. I thought I had touched the living depth, which Rissen called for and Linda felt and saw. ""Do you not know that life flows up here,"" the woman had said in my dream. I believed her, and I was sure that anything could happen.","When I woke to awareness of myself again, I was sitting on the wall around the roof terrace and shivering, not with cold, as it was a warm, almost hot night, but with powerful emotion.

"Timmarna innan den häktade anlände gick åt till ett slags förhör, som Rissen satte i gång, angående kallocainet och dess närmare släktingar bland preparaten ur kemisk och medicinsk synpunkt. Skicklig i sitt fack var han, det kunde jag inte neka till. Jag tror jag klarade det hela ganska bra, och jag var förvånad att han överhuvudtaget ansåg mig värdig ett sådant förhör. Var det hans mening att förklara mig kompetent för någon högre post? Rent objektivt sett var jag det säkert, och ändå ... Mig föreföll det som om han nödvändigt borde ha känt min misstro som en krypning i skinnet och svarat med samma mynt. Med starkt inre förbehåll tog jag emot hans vänlighet.

It seemed to me that he should necessarily have felt my disbelief as a creep in the skin and responded with the same coin. With strong inner reservations, I received his kindness.

Nu undrar jag: må vara, att detta var riktigt i hans speciella fall – det är slutagerat, och jag kritiserar det visst inte – men är det välbetänkt, rent principiellt sett? Som man kan räkna ut kommer en fånge under sitt straffarbete i beröring med en hel del folk, både fångvaktare och andra fångar. Av fångarna är somliga kanske bara en kort tid i fängelset, andra längre, i varje fall blir många så småningom utsläppta. Måste man inte tänka på vilken förgiftning de blir utsatta för från en person av det slaget? Han kommer kanske inte åt att säga så mycket, det är sant. Men jag har gjort en upptäckt. Jag ber er, min chef, skratta inte åt mig – men jag har märkt, att från en del personer strömmar det ut en så stark förnimmelse av hela deras livshållning, att de är farliga till och med när de tiger. En blick, en rörelse från en sådan individ är redan gift och pest. Nu undrar jag: är det välbetänkt, att en sådan individ får leva? Även om han kan användas till nyttigt arbete, och även om vår folkmängd är i sjunkande, är det inte troligt att han skadar Staten med själva sin andedräkt mer än han gagnar den med allt sitt arbete?","- My boss, I said, there is one thing that has surprised me somewhat. Under the syringe, they had a man the other day, a conspirator, who belonged to a dangerous sect of fools. He spread not only geographical rumors of an extremely harmful nature but also a gruesome tale that the creatures on the other side of the border would be of the same lineage as some of our border people. Also sang antisocial songs. He received penal servitude. Now I wonder: may it be that this was true in his particular case - it is final, and I certainly do not criticize it - but is it well thought out, in principle? As you can calculate, a prisoner comes into contact with a lot of people during his penal servitude, both prison guards and other prisoners. Of the prisoners, some may be only a short time in prison, others longer, at least many will eventually be released. Do not you have to think about what poisoning they are exposed to from a person of that kind? He may not be able to say much, that's true. But I've made a discovery. I ask you, my boss, not to laugh at me - but I have noticed that some people have such a strong sense of their whole way of life that they are dangerous even when they are silent. A glance, a movement from such an individual is already poison and plague. Now I wonder: is it well thought out that such an individual is allowed to live? Even if he can be used for useful work, and even if our population is declining, it is not likely that he will harm the State with his very breath more than he benefits it with all his work?","‘My chief,’ I said, ‘there is a matter that has rather surprised me. They had a man here being injected the other day, a conspirator who belonged to the dangerous sect of fools. He not only spread geographical rumours of an extremely harmful nature but also a monstrous story about the beings on the other side of the border sharing the same origin as some of our border tribes. He also sang asocial songs. He was sentenced to penal labour. Now I wonder: it may well be that this was the right punishment in his particular case – the case is closed, and I am certainly not criticizing the judgement – but is it a good idea, purely from the point of view of principle? As one may imagine, during his term of penal labour a prisoner comes into contact with a great many people, both prison guards and other prisoners. Of the prisoners, some are only in custody for a short time, others for longer, but many are eventually released. Must one not consider the poison to which they are exposed from a person of that type? It may not be possible for that person to say very much, that’s true. But I have made a discovery. I beg you, my chief, please don’t laugh at me – but I have noticed that from some people there radiates such a very strong sensation of the whole of their attitude to life that they are dangerous even when they say nothing. One glance, one movement from such an individual is already poison and plague. Now I wonder: is it a good idea to let such an individual live? Even if he can be employed for useful labour, and even if our birth-rate is falling, is it not more likely that he will harm the State with his very breathing than benefit it with his labour?’","""My Chief,"" I said, ""there's something that surprises me [p. 139] a little. The other day we had under injection a man, one of those from the gang, that dangerous sect of lunatics. He spread not only geographical rumors of utmost danger but also an insinuating legend that the creatures across the border were of the same race as some of our border-people. He also mouthed asocial songs. He was condemned to labor. Now I wonder: granted that it was right in this special instance—the case is closed and I do not criticize the verdict—but is this advisable, in principle? Obviously a prisoner, during his term, comes in contact with a great many other people, both guards as well as other prisoners. Of the prisoners some are perhaps in for only a short term, others longer; anyway, many are eventually liberated. Shouldn't one consider the poisoning they are exposed to from a person of that sort? Probably he will not have a chance to say much, that's true enough. But I have made a discovery; I ask you, my Chief, not to laugh at me, but I have noticed that from certain persons there emanates such a strong radiation from their life philosophy that they are a threat even when they say nothing. A single look, a motion from such an individual is in itself poison and contamination. My question is: can it be wise to let such an individual live? Even if he can be used for good work, and even if our population is in decline, isn't he liable to harm the State with his bare breath more than he aids it with his work?"""
"– Jag vet vad det är du gör, sade hon tankfullt, och till och med rösten hade en skiftning av samma barnslighet som ansiktet. Du vill veta något. Vad är det du vill veta? Det är för mycket du borde veta. Jag har för mycket att säga. Jag vet inte var jag ska börja. Jag vill det ju själv, varför ska du tvinga mig. Men kanske jag aldrig hade kunnat annars. Det har varit så i alla år. Det är något jag vill säga eller göra, och jag vet inte vad det är. Kanske det har varit en mängd småsaker, vänlighet och trevnad och smeksamhet, och när de var omöjliga, så var det stora och viktiga också omöjligt. En enda sak vet jag, det vet jag: att jag skulle vilja döda dig. Om jag bara visste att det aldrig blev upptäckt, skulle jag döda dig. Vad gör det för resten om det blir upptäckt, jag gör det ändå. Det är bättre än att det ska vara som det är. Jag hatar dig för att du inte kan rädda mig ur det här, jag skulle dödat dig om jag inte hade varit rädd. Nu vågar jag. Bara inte så länge jag kan tala med dig. Jag har aldrig kunnat tala med dig. Du är rädd, och jag är rädd, och alla är rädda. Ensam, alldeles ensam, och ändå inte skönt ensam, som när man var ung. Det är förfärligt. Inte har jag kunnat tala med dig om barnen, inte om hur jag har sörjt över att Ossu är borta, och hur rädd jag är för den dagen då Maryl är borta, och Laila. Jag trodde ju du skulle förakta mig. Du får förakta mig nu, jag bryr mig inte om det. Jag önskar ofta att jag var ung flicka igen och olyckligt kär i stället för lyckligt. Vet du att det är avundsvärt att vara ung flicka och olyckligt kär, fast man inte förstår det då? När man är ung flicka, går man och tror att det finns något annat, en frihet, som ska komma med kärleken, ett slags tillflykt som ska finnas hos den man håller av, ett slags värme och ett slags vila – något som inte finns. Olyckligt kär – man går och är ljuvligt förtvivlad över att just jag inte fick den stora lyckan med just dig – och så tror man att de andra, de kan ha fått den, och den finns, den finns att få – och du måste förstå, att när det finns så mycket glädje i världen och all törst har ett mål, så är det inte hopplöst ens att vara olycklig. Inte förtvivlat. Men lyckligt kär, det glider ut i tomheten. Det finns ju inget mål, det finns ju bara ensamhet, och varför skulle det finnas något annat, varför skulle det finnas en mening för oss enskilda. Jag har hållit av dig för mycket, Leo, och så fanns inte du heller. Jag tror nog jag kunde döda dig nu.","""I know what you are doing,"" she said thoughtfully, and even her voice had a shift of the same childishness as her face. You want to know something. What do you want to know? That's too much you should know. I have too much to say. I do not know where to start. I want it myself, why should you force me. But maybe I never could have done otherwise. It has been so for all these years. It's something I want to say or do, and I do not know what it is. Maybe there have been a lot of little things, kindness and coziness and affection, and when they were impossible, the big and important were also impossible. One thing I do know, I know: that I would like to kill you. If I only knew it was never discovered, I'd kill you. What does it do for the rest if it is discovered, I do it anyway. It's better than it should be. I hate you for not being able to save me from this, I would have killed you if I had not been afraid. Now I dare. Just not as long as I can talk to you.

I have not been able to talk to you about the children, not about how I have mourned the disappearance of Ossu, and how scared I am of the day Maryl is gone, and Laila. I thought you would despise me. You can despise me now, I do not care. I often wish I was a young girl again and unhappily in love instead of happy. Do you know that it is enviable to be a young girl and unhappily in love, even though you do not understand it then? When you are a young girl, you go and think that there is something else, a freedom that should come with love, a kind of refuge that should exist in the person you love, a kind of warmth and a kind of rest - something that does not exist. Unhappily in love - you go and are sweetly despairing that I did not get the great happiness with you - and so you think that the others, they may have received it, and it exists, it exists to receive - and you must understand, that when there is so much joy in the world and all thirst has a purpose, it is not hopeless even to be unhappy. Not desperate. But happily in love, it slips into emptiness. There is no goal, there is only loneliness, and why would there be anything else, why would there be a meaning for us individuals. I've loved you too much, Leo, and neither have you. I think I could kill you now.","‘I know what you’re doing,’ she said thoughtfully, and her voice even had a tinge of the same childlike quality as her face. ‘You want to know something.

"– Först och främst har jag tillåtit mig indela de här historierna i två stora huvudgrupper: sådana med ”lyckligt” slut och sådana med ”olyckligt”. Eftersom meningen är att locka och driva, skulle man tro, att sådan med lyckligt slut vore ändamålsenligast. Så är emellertid inte fallet – som jag nu ska visa. För vilka är ett lyckligt slut ett bra lockmedel? För de slappt reagerande, för dem som i själva verket, när allt kommer omkring, ändå fruktar plågor och döden – och det är inte dem vi vänder oss till. Psykologiska undersökningar har givit vid handen, att Frivilliga offertjänsten ändå till försvinnande liten del rekryteras från det hållet. Då sådant folk väl har kommit till den lyckliga upplösningen, glömmer de gladligen själva innebörden i filmen. De går hem och sover sött på sitt öra som vanligt i förvissningen om att nu har både hjälten och hjältinnan det bra. De går inte till propagandakontoret för att anmäla sig. Offertjänstfilmer med lyckligt slut är till för mellantiden mellan kampanjerna, inte för kampanjperioderna själva. De är till för att lugna och uppmuntra anhöriga och övriga medsoldater, om de någon gång råkar sända en tanke till barn, syskon, kamrater, som försvunnit i Frivilliga offertjänsten. Sådana filmer behöver bara förekomma strövis, och ska deras verkan vara riktigt god, bör de inte bara sluta lyckligt, utan ha starka inslag av soligt humör, tokroliga upptåg – gärna också rörande poänger, men inte heroiska. En rad manus sätter sig i det avseendet mellan två stolar: de företer en misslyckad blandning av en önskvärd mellantidsmentalitet och den som bör sätta in under kampanjtid.","- First and foremost, I have allowed myself to divide these stories into two major groups: those with a ""happy"" ending and those with an ""unhappy"". Since the intention is to attract and drive, one would think that such a happy ending would be most expedient. However, that is not the case - as I will now show. For whom is a happy ending a good lure? For those who react weakly, for those who, in fact, after all, still fear torment and death - and they are not the ones we turn to. Psychological studies have shown that the Voluntary Sacrifice Service is still recruited to a negligible extent from that direction. Once such people have come to the happy resolution, they happily forget the very meaning of the film. They go home and sleep sweetly on their ear as usual in the certainty that now both the hero and the heroine are well. They do not go to the propaganda office to register. Quotation service videos with a happy ending are for the interval between the campaigns, not for the campaign periods themselves. They are there to calm and encourage relatives and other fellow soldiers, if they ever happen to send a thought to children, siblings, comrades, who have disappeared in the Volunteer Sacrifice Service. Such films only need to appear scattered, and if their effect is to be really good, they should not only end happily, but have strong elements of sunny mood, bizarre antics - preferably also about points, but not heroic. A series of scripts sit in that respect between two chairs: they present a failed mix of a desirable interim mentality and the one that should be inserted during campaign time.","‘Instead, I must very quickly draw up a general critique, which at the same time will be a set of guidelines for the project. ‘First and foremost I have taken the liberty of dividing these stories into two large main groups: those with a “happy” ending and those with an “unhappy” one. As the aim is to attract and encourage, it might be thought that stories with a happy ending would be best suited to our purpose. Such, however, is not the case – as I shall now demonstrate. What kind of person is attracted by a happy ending? One who is slow to react, one who really, deep down, fears suffering and death – and they are not the people we are addressing. Psychological studies have shown that the Voluntary Sacrifice Service acquires few recruits from them. When such people get to the happy ending they gladly forget what the film was all about. They go home and sleep as soundly as dormice in the assurance that now both hero and heroine are safe. They do not go to the propaganda office to turn themselves in. Voluntary Sacrifice films with a happy ending are made for the interim period between the campaigns, not the campaigns themselves. They are made in order to reassure and encourage family members and other fellow soldiers, should they at some point turn their thoughts to children, siblings or associates who have vanished into the Voluntary Sacrifice Service. Such films need to be shown only sporadically, and if they are to have a truly positive effect they should not only have a happy ending but also contain strong elements of sunny humour, and droll escapades. They should have moving scenes, but not scenes that are heroic. In this respect a number of the manuscripts land between two stools: they are an unsuccessful blend of desirable interim period mentality with the mentality that ought to prevail during the campaign.","""Instead, I will make a short general criticism and at the same time offer a line of direction for the work. ""To begin with, I've taken the liberty of dividing these stories into two main groups: those with a 'happy' ending, and those with an 'unhappy' ending. Since the purpose is to entice and induce, one might be inclined to believe that the ones with a happy ending would best serve the purpose. Such, however, is not the case, as I will proceed to show. For whom is a happy ending an enticement? For those who are dull in their reactions, for those who, when all is said and done, actually fear pain and death; and we are not directing ourselves to them. Psychological investigations have shown that the Voluntary Sacrificial Service gains singularly few recruits among them. When that type of people finally arrive at the happy ending, they have forgotten the real meaning of the film. They go home and sleep sweetly, as usual assured that now both the hero and the heroine are well off. They don't go to the propaganda office and offer their services. Sacrificial Service films with happy endings are for the in-between times, not for the [p. 116] campaign periods. They are there to calm and cheer relatives and other fellow-soldiers, if perchance they should happen to think of children, brothers, sisters, comrades who have disappeared in the Voluntary Sacrificial Service. Such films should be shown only occasionally, and to have a really good effect they should not only end happily, they should have a strong element of sunny humor, ribaldry, also touching moments, but not heroic. In this respect one group of manuscripts falls between two stools so to speak: they offer an unhappy mixture of desirable between-drives mentality and the mentality that should come to the fore at drive-periods."
"– Men en livshållning är inte något abstrakt, sade jag energiskt. Jag skulle tvärtom vilja säga, att det är det enda som säkert inte är abstrakt. Och de där dårarnas livshållning är statsvidrig. Bäst och klarast ser man det av deras egna myter om en viss Reor, som tycks ha varit ett strå vassare än de andra i fråga om sinnessvaghet och därför har blivit deras specialhjälte. Överseende mot förbrytare, vårdslöshet med egen säkerhet (man är ju ändå själv ett värdefullt och påkostat verktyg, det får inte glömmas!), personliga känslobindningar som är starkare än bindningen till Staten – dit är det de vill föra oss! Vid första påseendet förefaller deras riter vara rena fånerier. Vid närmare eftertanke blir de överväldigande osmakliga. De är bilder av ett överdrivet förtroende människor emellan, eller i varje fall vissa människor emellan. Redan det anser jag vara statsfientligt. Den alltför lättrogne går det förr eller senare som deras hjälte Reor – han blir förr eller senare rånmördad. Och är det inte på denna grund Staten vuxit upp? Fanns det grund och skäl till förtroende människor emellan, så skulle aldrig någon Stat ha uppstått. Den heliga och nödvändiga grunden till Statens existens är vår ömsesidiga välgrundade misstro till varandra. Den som misstänkliggör denna grund, han misstänkliggör Staten.","- But an attitude to life is not something abstract, I said energetically. On the contrary, I would like to say that it is the only thing that is certainly not abstract. And those fools' way of life is disgusting. This is best and most clearly seen in their own myths about a certain Reor, who seems to have been a bit sharper than the others in terms of insanity and has therefore become their special hero. Surrender to criminals, carelessness with one's own security (you are still a valuable and lavish tool, it must not be forgotten!), Personal emotional bonds that are stronger than the bond to the State - that is what they want to take us! At first glance, their rites appear to be pure nonsense. On closer inspection, they become overwhelmingly distasteful. They are images of an excessive trust between people, or at least some people between. I already consider that to be anti-state. The overly gullible one sooner or later goes after their hero Reor - he will sooner or later be robbed. And is it not on this basis that the State grew up? If there were grounds and reasons for trust between people, no State would ever have arisen. The sacred and necessary basis for the existence of the State is our mutual well-founded distrust of each other. He who suspects this ground, he suspects the State.","‘But an ethos isn’t something abstract,’ I said heatedly. ‘On the contrary, I would say that it’s the only thing that is definitely not abstract.

One can see it most clearly in their own myths about a person called Reor, who seems to have been slightly ahead of the rest in mental deficiency, and has therefore become their special hero. Leniency towards criminals, carelessness with one’s own security (one is oneself a valuable and sophisticated instrument, that shouldn’t be forgotten!), personal ties that are stronger than one’s bond to the State – that is where they want to lead us! At first glance their rituals look like pure buffoonery. On closer consideration they become overwhelmingly obnoxious. They are images of an exaggerated trust between people, or at least between certain people. That alone I consider to be treasonable. The ones who are too credulous will come to the same end as their hero Reor – sooner or later they will be robbed and murdered. And was it not on this very foundation that the State was built? If there were reason for trust between people, no State would have arisen. The sacred and necessary foundation of the State’s existence is our mutual well-founded mistrust of each other.

Indulgence with criminals, carelessness with one's own security (it must be kept in mind that the individual is a valuable and expensive tool!), personal attachments that are stronger than the attachment to the State—that's where they want to lead us! At first sight their rites seem expressions of pure lunacy; at closer scrutiny they become nauseatingly repulsive. They picture an exaggerated confidence between individuals, or at least between certain individuals. This in itself I consider treasonable. The too gullible one will sooner or later experience the same fate as their hero Reor—sooner or later he will be robbed and murdered.

"– En underavdelning av denna ändamålsenlighet är c) det ärofulla i den undergång som framställes. Därmed menar jag inte att hjälten bör skörda positiv ära; det sänker filmens nivå och verkar genast svagare på de i egentlig mening heroiska naturerna. Däremot bör han räddas från djup inre vanära. Mot hjälten sätter man nämligen upp skurken, asocial och med själviska bevekelsegrunder, mannen som faller för frestelsen och drar sig undan smärtan och döden. Rått ful eller osympatiskt tvålfager till utseendet, slapp och odisciplinerad, feg och lösaktig bör han hela tiden gå som en varnande parallell genom handlingen, dock aldrig mer överdrivet framställd än att han sticker som en tagg i känsliga samveten: du är väl ändå inte sådan? Fruktan för att vara feg, ärelös, ful i inre bemärkelse är nämligen ofta en starkt drivande kraft hos den heroiska typ jag här beskrivit och som vi framför allt måste ta sikte på i vår propagandakampanj.","A subdivision of this expediency is c) the glorious in the doom produced.

Under de närmast följande dagarna kom jag att betrakta arbetstiden som den minst krävande delen av dygnet, medan min mest maktpåliggande uppgift var kvällstjänstgöringen, inberäknat natten, som också mycket ofta tillbragtes i vapen. Jag var glad, att min uppfinning låg färdig. Hade jag varit en liten smula långsammare, skulle den väl aldrig nått sin fullbordan, åtminstone om mina kvällar hädanefter alltid skulle förflyta som nu. Med så ansträngande timmar bakom mig skulle jag förgäves sökt samla tankarna till full skärpa. Nu gällde det lyckligtvis bara den sista praktiska tillämpningen, och det gick av bara farten, särskilt som Rissens närvaro höll mig vaken. Man märkte ju att han också var ganska trött, men eftersom han var åtskilligt äldre, drillades han väl inte fullt så hårt, och i varje fall kom jag aldrig på honom med något misstag.","So Linda and I threw the food at us and went to the military service in different places. It turned out to have been expanded not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. For the next few days, I came to regard working time as the least demanding part of the day, while my most demanding task was the evening service, including the night, which was also very often spent in arms. I was glad that my invention was finished. Had I been a little bit slower, it would probably never have reached its completion, at least if my evenings from now on would always flow as now. With such strenuous hours behind me, I would have tried in vain to gather my thoughts to full sharpness. Now, fortunately, it was only the last practical application, and it just went off the rails, especially as Rissen's presence kept me awake. You noticed that he was also quite tired, but since he was much older, he was not drilled quite as hard, and in any case I never came across him by mistake.","So then Linda and I bolted down our evening meal and each set off to do our respective military duty. It turned out to have been expanded, not only quantitively, but also qualitatively. During the days that immediately followed I came to view my working hours as the least demanding part of the day, while my most urgent task was the evening spell of duty, which often stretched into the night. I was glad that my discovery was complete. Had I been just a little slower, it might never have reached completion, at least if my evenings had always continued to be as they were now. With such hours of exertion behind me I would have sought in vain to gather my thoughts in full focus. Now it was merely a question of the final practical application, and it was progressing at full speed, particularly as Rissen’s presence kept me awake. It was noticeable that he, too, was rather tired, but as he was somewhat older, his training drill was likely somewhat less harsh, and at any rate I never caught him making a mistake.","Then Linda and I hurried through the evening meal and departed to our military service in different directions. These duties had been increased, not only in kind but in degree; during the immediately following days I remember that I considered my work at the laboratory the least demanding part of the day, while my heaviest duty consisted of the evening military service, often extended through the night. I was pleased that my work of discovery was completed; had I been ever so little slower it might never have reached the finished state, in view of the way my evenings were occupied now. With such exhausting hours behind me I would never have been able to gather my thoughts for clear calculation in daytime. Fortunately, [p. 68] only the final application remained and this progressed on its own momentum, especially since Rissen's presence kept me awake. I noticed that he too was very tired, but since he was much older than I, I supposed that his night exercises might not be so severe; anyway, I never caught him in a mistake."
"Då jag vacklade in på Tredje byrån med mina namnlistor, surrade klockan slut på arbetsdagen och jag höll på att bli omkullsprungen av utrusande. En äldre sur man satt kvar för att avsluta några uträkningar, och jag såg ingen annan råd än att vända mig till honom. Han rynkade på näsan, höll sitt sura lynne i styr inför rekommendationerna, granskade listorna och sade:","When I staggered into the Third Bureau with my lists of names, the clock rang at the end of the working day and I was about to be knocked over by intoxicants. An elderly angry man sat down to finish some calculations, and I saw no other advice than to turn to him. He wrinkled his nose, kept his sour temper in check before the recommendations, reviewed the lists and said:","As I staggered into the Third Bureau with my lists of names, the bell droned the end of the working day and I was nearly knocked over by people rushing out. An ageing, sour-looking man still sat finishing some calculations, and I saw no alternative but to turn to him. He wrinkled his nose, kept his sour mood in check when he saw the recommendations, surveyed the lists and said:","As I stumbled in to the Third Bureau with my lists of signatures, the clock struck an end to the workday and I was almost trampled down by the outrushing crowd. One older, morose-looking man remained behind to finish some calculations, and I felt I could do no better than turn to him. He wrinkled his nose, controlled his sour disposition when he saw my recommendations, looked over the lists, and said, ""One thousand two hundred names, did you say?"

Jag slätade till håret och gick ut. Men Linda var inte där. Klockan var redan långt över vanlig kvällsmattid.

"– Inte vad jag vet. Fast jag fick gå tidigare förstås, jag och ett par till, som heller inte hade varit med förr, tror jag. Sen vet jag inte vad de hade för sig. Men när vi gick, var det någon som sa: När vi möts ute i världen känner vi igen varandra. – Jag kan inte förklara det, men det var faktiskt riktigt högtidligt, och jag trodde verkligen jag skulle känna igen dem – inte precis dem jag träffade där, utan vem som helst som hörde till dem.

"Jag kunde inte låta bli att berätta historien för Rissen under laboratorietimmarna. Egentligen hörde den ju inte till arbetet, men den hade i alla fall en allmän betydelse. Jag misstänker också starkt, att jag drevs av en viss lust att visa mig intressant och självständig, en sådan man som andra sökte upp i sina svårigheter och som lätt och lekande hjälpte dem till rätta. Det förhöll sig nämligen så, att lika hårt som jag kritiserade Rissen och lika djupt som jag misstrodde honom, lika viktigt var i alla fall hans omdöme för mig. Var gång jag kom på mig med att försöka imponera på honom, skämdes jag för mig själv och slog bort min svaghet. Men efter en kvart var den där igen, och jag gjorde allt jag kunde för att tilltvinga mig något slags aktning från denne konstige man, som ingen kunde ha respekt för. Då jag anade, att jag misslyckades, försökte jag åtminstone reta honom och ville gärna tänka mig, att det låg en medveten plan under mina små stick: kunde jag få honom ordentligt förargad, skulle jag åtminstone veta var jag hade honom, sade jag till mig själv.","I could not help but tell the story to Rissen during the laboratory hours. It did not really belong to the work, but it had a general significance in any case. I also strongly suspect that I was driven by a certain desire to show myself interesting and independent, such a man as others sought out their difficulties and who easily and playfully helped them to the right. It so happened that as harshly as I criticized Rissen and as deeply as I distrusted him, as important was at least his judgment for me. Every time I tried to impress him, I was ashamed of myself and dismissed my weakness. But after a quarter of an hour it was there again, and I did everything I could to force myself some kind of esteem from this strange man, whom no one could have respect for. When I sensed that I was failing, I at least tried to tease him and wanted to imagine that there was a conscious plan under my little sticks: if I could get him really annoyed, I would at least know where I had him, I said to myself self.","I could not resist telling the story to Rissen during laboratory hours.

I also strongly suspect that I was driven by a certain desire to show myself as being interesting and independent, the kind of man to whom others turned in their travails and who lightly and playfully helped them to put things right. The truth of the matter was that, harsh as my criticisms of Rissen were, and however deep my mistrust of him, I attached an equal importance to his estimation of me. Each time I caught myself trying to impress him I felt ashamed of myself and fended off my weakness. But a quarter of an hour later there it was again, and I did all I could to force some kind of esteem out of this strange man whom no one could respect. When I sensed that I had failed, I at least tried to irritate him, with the thought that a conscious plan lay behind my little tricks: if I could make him really annoyed I would at least know where I was with him, I told myself.","I could not help relating the story to Rissen while we [p. 73] worked together in the laboratory.

The fact was that as much as I criticized Rissen, and as deeply as I suspected him, equally important nevertheless was his opinion of me. Every time I discovered myself trying to impress him, I felt ashamed of myself and smothered my weakness. But half an hour later it was there again, and I was doing all I could to earn the respect of this peculiar man, for whom no one could have respect.

"Vi förklarade oss beredda och lyckliga. Audiensen var slut, och vi fördes ut en annan väg och upp till det tillfälliga laboratorium Tuareg talat om.

"Jag var övertygad om att han menade vad han sade. Det enda jag hade att invända var att han något för starkt betonade sitt hjältemod. Också en vetenskapsman i sitt laboratorium kan vara modig, fast han ännu inte har fått visa det, tänkte jag. För resten, det var inte för sent än: vad han sade om det febrila arbetet på krigsgaslaboratoriet var ett nytt tecken på att det blåste upp till krig. Ett annat, som jag iakttagit för mig själv men inte velat diskutera för att slippa anses som pessimist och kverulant, var att maten genomgående hade försämrats under de sista månaderna.","I was convinced that he meant what he said. The only thing I had to object to was that he emphasized his heroism a little too strongly. Even a scientist in his laboratory can be brave, even though he has not yet been allowed to show it, I thought.

Another, which I observed for myself but did not want to discuss in order to avoid being considered a pessimist and complainer, was that the food had consistently deteriorated in recent months.","I was convinced that he meant what he said. My only reservation was that he placed rather too much emphasis on his heroic courage. A scientist in his laboratory can be courageous, too, even though he has not been able to show it, I thought.

"Vi skickade alltså efter en ny tiomannagrupp gifta försökspersoner, och jag upprepade mitt lilla tal från i går.

Det må ju vara, att de gifta försökspersonerna överhuvudtaget är få, och just i det här experimentet betydde kryckorna plus minus noll – men ändå! På sista tiden hade bristen på försökspersoner gjort sig allt kännbarare. Självklart konsumerades de under årens lopp, och något måste göras, om arbetet alls skulle kunna fortsättas som förr. Så fort de avlägsnat sig ur rummet, brast jag ut:","So we sent for a new group of ten married people, and I repeated my little speech from yesterday.

"Jag fick en idé. Naturligtvis, och med rätta, kunde inte myndigheterna lägga någon vikt vid en enskild medsoldats klagoskrivelse. Däremot kunde man mycket väl sätta i gång med en insamling av namn från alla stadens laboratorier, där försökspersoner användes och där man alltså måste ha märkt bristen. Jag beslöt använda första kväll då jag inte var för trött, i värsta fall en ledig kväll, till att formulera en sådan skrivelse, som sedan kunde dupliceras och skickas omkring till de olika institutionerna. Företagsamhet av sådan art kunde ju omöjligt vara annat än meriterande, tänkte jag.","I got an idea. Of course, and rightly so, the authorities could not attach any importance to an individual fellow soldier's complaint. On the other hand, one could very well start with a collection of names from all the city's laboratories, where subjects were used and where one must have noticed the lack. I decided to use the first evening when I was not too tired, in the worst case a free evening, to formulate such a letter, which could then be duplicated and sent around to the various institutions. Entrepreneurship of this kind could not possibly be anything other than merit, I thought.","I had an idea.

"Utanpå märktes det säkert inte, men invärtes ryckte jag till vid hennes ord. De kunde vara helt oskyldigt menade. Vad var mera naturligt, än att en hustru frågade, vem som skulle bli mannens kontrollchef! På kontrollchefens kitslighet eller tillmötesgående hängde ju hur lång prövningstiden skulle bli. Det hade till och med hänt, att ärelystna kontrollchefer gjort kontrollandens uppfinning till sin egen, och man hade jämförelsevis lite möjlighet att värja sig mot sådant. Inte underligt då, om ens närmaste frågade vem det skulle bli.","It was probably not noticeable on the outside, but on the inside I jerked at her words. They could be completely innocent meant. What was more natural than a wife asking, who would be the husband's control chief! How long the probationary period would be depended on the inspector's quickness or courtesy. It had even happened that ambitious chiefs of control made the inspector's invention his own, and one had comparatively little opportunity to defend oneself against such things. No wonder then, if even the nearest asked who it would be.","I am certain that I showed no reaction, but inwardly her words made me jump. It could have been a perfectly innocent question. What was more natural than a wife asking her husband who his control chief would be? After all, the length of the testing period depended on how petty-minded or how easygoing the control chief happened to be. There had even been cases where ambitious control chiefs had made the researcher’s discovery their own, and there were relatively few ways to protect oneself from this. Not surprising, then, that one’s nearest and dearest should ask who it was going to be.","Outwardly it was not noticeable, I am sure, but inside I winced at her words. They might be said quite innocently. What could be more natural than that a wife should ask her husband who his control-chief would be! On the control-chief's hypercritical or understanding attitude, [p. 9] the length of the testing period was indeed dependent. It had even happened that covetous control-chiefs had made their subordinates' discoveries their own, and there was of course slim chance of defending oneself against anything like that. So it was not strange that one's nearest should ask who he would be."
"Överallt där vi rullade fram kastade vår lykta ett hastigt sken över ett kort vägstycke. För en kvart sedan hade ingen människa hörts eller synts.

Jag kunde inte låta bli att beundra organisationen i denna jättelika nattövning. Och ju längre vi färdades, ju längre hade också arbetet fortskridit. Jag såg taggtrådsstängsel resas (skulle de verkligen också hinna få bort dem till i morgon bittida, då folk skulle fram där till sitt arbete?), jag såg långa slangar läggas ut, behållare av olika slag forslas i olika riktningar, vakter bevaka alla metrostationer och alla boningshus. Då och då såg jag också en trehjuling som vår med en fånge baki som jag, och jag undrade vart de tänkte föra oss.","Everywhere we rolled, our lantern cast a rapid glow over a short stretch of road. A quarter of an hour ago, no human had been heard or seen. Now it was crowded with people on all the streets, all the squares, all the roof terraces, each one eagerly engaged in some definite work. I could not help but admire the organization in this huge night exercise. And the further we traveled, the further the work had progressed. I saw barbed wire fences erected (would they really also have time to get rid of them until tomorrow morning, when people would arrive there for their work?), I saw long hoses being laid out, containers of various kinds being transported in different directions, guards guarding all metro stations and all dwelling houses. Every now and then I also saw a tricycle like ours with a prisoner in the back like me, and I wondered where they were going to take us.","Everywhere as we rolled along, our headlamp threw a quick beam of light over a short stretch of road. A quarter of an hour ago not a soul had been heard or seen. Now all the streets, squares and roof terraces were teeming with people, each person eagerly intent on some particular task. I could not but admire the organization in this gigantic night exercise. And the further we travelled, the further the work had progressed. I saw barbed-wire barricades go up (would they really have time to clear them away before early morning, when people would need to get through in order to go to work?). I saw hosepipes being unrolled, containers of various kinds taken in different directions, guards patrolling every metro station and every residential area. Now and then I saw a three-wheeler like ours with a prisoner like myself in the back, and wondered where they were taking us.","Wherever we rolled along, our headlights threw a beam a short distance before us. A quarter of an hour ago not a single person had been within sight or hearing; now people swarmed in all the streets, squares, and roof terraces, each one busily employed with a definite task. I could not help but admire the organization of this gigantic night-maneuver. And the farther we went, the farther the work had progressed. I saw wire fences being put up (would they be able to remove them also before early morning when people had to pass here on the way to work?). I saw long cables being strung, containers of various kinds being moved in different directions, guards protecting all Metro-stations and all buildings. Occasionally I also noticed a three-wheeler like ours carrying a prisoner, like me, and I wondered where they intended to take us."
"Bilden av den tärda kvinnans förklarade ansikte dök upp i minnet med en vemodig hopplöshet. Vilken omogen och meningslös fordran att vilja ha en egen människa att lita på, rent personligt lita på oavsett vad man tar sig för! Jag måste medge för mig själv, att det fanns en sövande lockelse i den. Spädbarnet och stenåldersvilden lever kanske inte bara kvar i somliga, tänkte jag, utan i oss alla, fast mer och mindre, det är en väsentlig skillnad. Och likaväl som jag känt det som en uppgift att krossa den bleka kvinnans dröm, likaväl tog jag fasta på nödvändigheten av att krossa samma illusion hos Kadidja Kapporis man, även om det skulle ske med uppoffring av ännu en ledig kväll.","The image of the tarred woman's explained face came to mind with a melancholy hopelessness. What an immature and meaningless demand to want your own person to trust, purely personal trust no matter what you do! I have to admit to myself that there was a sleeping lure in it. The infant and the Stone Age wildlife may not only live on in some people, I thought, but in all of us, though more and less, it's a significant difference. And just as I felt it as a task to crush the pale woman's dream, I also took note of the necessity of crushing the same illusion in Kadidja Kappori's husband, even if it was to be done by sacrificing another free evening.","The image of that haggard woman’s transfigured face arose in my memory with a forlorn hopelessness. What an immature and senseless demand, to want to have a person of one’s own to trust, trust in a purely personal way, irrespective of what he or she does! I had to admit to myself that there was a lulling seduction in it. Perhaps the infant and the Stone Age savage live on not only in some of us but in us all, though in some more than others, and that is the important difference. And just as I felt it my duty to crush the pale woman’s dream, so I considered the need to crush the same illusion in Kadidja Kappori’s husband, even if it meant sacrificing one more night off.","A vision of that other haggard woman's transfixed face arose in my memory with a sad hopelessness. What an immature and meaningless demand it is to wish to possess a single individual, and to trust this person on purely personal grounds, regardless of what he or she does! Yet I had to admit there was a sweet allurement in it. The babe and the Stone Age savage survive, perhaps not only in some, I thought, but in all of us, although to a higher or lesser degree, and that is the essential difference. And in the same way as I had felt it my duty to crush the pale woman's dream, equally strongly did I realize the need of crushing the same illusion in Kadidja Kappori's husband, even if I must sacrifice another free evening for the purpose."
"– Nu, slutade jag, har man bara att vänta på en lagstiftning av mer djuplodande art än världshistorien tidigare känt: lagstiftningen mot statsfientliga tankar och känslor. Den kanske låter vänta på sig – men den kommer säkert.","- Now, I concluded, one only has to wait for legislation of a more profound nature than world history previously known: the legislation against anti-state thoughts and feelings. It may be long overdue - but it will certainly come.","‘Now,’ I concluded, ‘we have only to wait for a law of a deeper and more far-reaching kind than world history has ever known: the law against treasonous thoughts and emotions. It may be rather a long wait – but it’s a law that will surely come.’","""Now"" I concluded, ""one only has to wait for a new law, of a kind probing more deeply than the world has known hitherto: a law against treasonable thoughts and feelings. Perhaps it will take some time, but I feel sure it'll come."""
"I detsamma återvände dörrvakten till sin plats, och jag kunde inte låta bli att fråga honom vad som stod på.","At once the doorman returned to his place, and I could not help but ask him what was going on.","At the same moment, the doorman returned to his place, and I could not help asking him what was going on.",Just then the guard returned to his post and I could not help but ask him what was happening.
"Att det var ett misslyckande kunde jag inte dölja för mig själv. Sant nog, att jag fått veta vad jag ville – att hon inte stod i vägen för mitt beslut i fråga om Rissen. Sant nog, att jag i grund och botten inte var rädd för någon hämnd från hennes sida, eftersom hon ändå, när allt kom omkring, var lika oupplösligt och förtvivlat bunden vid mig som jag vid henne. Sant nog, att jag nu hade henne i mitt våld, att jag var i besittning av hemligheter som hon inte ville ha blottade. Sant nog alltsammans. Det var alltså inte ett misslyckande, om jag bara tänkte på det dumma begränsade mål jag ställt upp för mig. Och ändå var det ett grundligt, ohyggligt misslyckande på ett annat och större sätt.","That it was a failure I could not hide from myself. True enough, that I was told what I wanted - that she did not stand in the way of my decision regarding Rissen. True enough, that I was basically not afraid of any revenge on her part, because she still, after all, was as insoluble and desperately bound to me as I was to her. True enough, that I now had her in my power, that I was in possession of secrets which she did not want to have exposed. True enough, everything. So it was not a failure, if I only thought about the stupid limited goal I set for myself. And yet it was a thorough, horrible failure in a different and greater way.","That it was a failure, I could not conceal from myself. True, I had learned what I wanted to know – that she would not stand in the way of my decision with regard to Rissen. True, deep down I was not afraid of any revenge on her part, as in the last analysis she was just as indissolubly and desperately bound to me as I to her. True, I now had her in my power, I was in possession of secrets that she did not want to be revealed. True, all of it. So if I thought in terms of the stupid, limited goal I had set for myself, it was not a failure. And yet in another, greater sense it was a basic and monstrous one.","That it was a failure I could not hide from myself. True, I had obtained the information I wished—that she did not stand in the way of my decision concerning Rissen. True indeed that fundamentally I was not afraid of revenge from her, since she, when all was said and done, was as inextricably and hopelessly tied to me as I to her. True indeed that I now had her in my power, that I possessed secrets she did not wish to have divulged. True indeed all of it. Consequently it was not a failure if I only thought of the silly, limited goal I had put up for myself. And yet it was a fundamental, horrible failure in another and greater sense."
"– Det kan han, i högsta grad.","- He can, to the highest degree.","‘He can, and eminently so.’","Only after a moment's hesitation did Rissen reply, almost reluctantly, ""He can, in highest degree."""
"Varför han inte hade angivit sin hustru låg höljt i dunkel, tydligen också för honom själv. Å ena sidan visade han ingen sådan extatisk tacksamhet för hustruns förtroende som den lilla bleka kvinnan vi förut haft, å den andra hade han inget intresse för de utlovade summorna heller. Även om han inte direkt förnekade alla möjligheter till att hustrun kunde vara spion, var han synbarligen inte säker på att allt verkligen förhöll sig så som hon berättade. Allt som allt kunde man kanske säga, att en viss lojhet hade hindrat honom – en lojhet, som han kanske kunde ha övervunnit ett par dar senare, det var ju omöjligt att veta. Hade inte Karrek redan beslutat sig för att låta nåd gå före rätt, skulle redan den lojheten stämplat honom som statsfarlig. Medan en sådan loj människa samlade sig till handling, kunde hela förräderiet ju redan vara utfört och skadan skedd, men inte bara det, utan hela hans tveksamhet vittnade ju också om en otroligt ringa hängivenhet för Staten. Det kom alltså inte som någon överraskning, när han bland annat lät slippa ur sig:","Why he had not indicated his wife lay shrouded in obscurity, apparently also to himself. On the one hand, he showed no such ecstatic gratitude for his wife's trust as the little pale woman we had before, on the other hand, he had no interest in the promised sums either. Although he did not directly deny all possibilities that his wife could be a spy, he was apparently not sure that everything was really as she told it. All in all, one might say that a certain laziness had hindered him - a laziness which he might have overcome a couple of days later, it was impossible to know. Had Karrek not already decided to let mercy go before justice, that laziness would already have branded him dangerous to the state. While such a loyal man gathered for action, the whole betrayal could have already been carried out and the damage done, but not only that, but all his hesitation also testified to an incredibly little devotion to the State. So it came as no surprise when he, among other things, let it go:","Why he had not denounced his wife lay shrouded in mystery, clearly also to himself. On the one hand he showed none of the ecstatic gratitude for his wife’s confession of the kind that the pale little woman we had previously questioned had shown, and on the other he had no interest in the promised sums of money, either. Even though he had not directly denied the possibility that his wife might be a spy, he was visibly uncertain that everything had happened the way she told it. All in all, one could perhaps say that a certain obtuseness had prevented him – an obtuseness he might perhaps have overcome a few days later, it was impossible to know. Had Karrek not already decided to let mercy take precedence over justice, that obtuseness would already have labelled him as treasonous. While an obtuse person of that kind was getting ready for action, a whole act of treachery might already have been performed, and the damage done; but not only that: his general tentativeness also bore witness to a very meagre devotion to the State. It came as no surprise, then, when among other things he let slip:","The reason he had not reported his wife remained obscure, apparently even to himself. On the one hand he expressed an almost ecstatic gratefulness for his wife's confidence—like the little pale woman we had had before; on the other hand, neither did he have any interest in the promised money. Even though he refused to deny entirely the possibility that his wife was a spy, obviously neither was he quite sure that things were exactly as she had said. All in all, perhaps one could say that a certain indolence had prevented him—an indolence he might have overcome within a few days, though it was impossible to say. If Karrek had not decided in advance to temper justice with mercy, that very indolence would in itself have stamped him as treasonous. While such an indolent person gathered his senses for action, the whole treason might already have taken place and the damage been done; but not only that, his whole attitude of doubt bespoke an incredibly feeble devotion to the State. And so it came as no surprise to us when, among other remarks that slipped out, he said, ""After all, that sort of business is of so much less importance than ours."""

"Tala kunde vi naturligtvis inte för luftflottans övningar, som varken dag eller natt tillät något samtal att föras utomhus. I alla fall såg hon min glada min och nickade uppmuntrande, fast allvarlig som alltid. Inte förrän vi hunnit in i bostadshuset och hissen förde oss ner till vår våning, slöt sig en relativ tystnad omkring oss – metrobullret, som skakade väggarna, var inte starkare än att man kunde tala obehindrat – och ändå uppsköt vi försiktigtvis alla samtal, tills vi kommit in. Hade någon kommit på oss med att tala i hissen, skulle ju ingen misstanke varit naturligare än att vi dryftade ämnen som vi inte ville låta barnen eller hembiträdet höra. Sådana fall hade inträffat, då statsfiender och andra förbrytare velat använda hissen som konspirationslokal; det låg ju också nära till hands, eftersom polisöra och polisöga av tekniska skäl inte kunde monteras i en hiss och eftersom portvakten brukade ha annat att göra än springa och lyssna i trappnedgångarna. Vi teg alltså försiktigt ända tills vi stigit in i familjerummet, där veckans hembiträde redan dukat fram kvällsmaten och väntade med barnen, som hon hämtat ner ur husets barnvåning. Hon föreföll att vara en ordentlig och hygglig flicka, och vår vänliga hälsning berodde alltså inte bara på medvetandet om att hon, som alla hembiträden, var skyldig att avlägga rapport om familjen vid veckans slut – en reform, som allmänt ansågs ha förbättrat tonen i många hem. En stämning av glädje och trevnad rådde kring vårt bord, särskilt som vår äldste son, Ossu, var med bland oss andra. Han hade kommit på besök från barnlägret, eftersom det var hemafton.","Of course, we could not speak for the exercises of the Air Force, which neither day nor night allowed any conversation to take place outdoors. In any case, she saw my happy face and nodded encouragingly, though seriously as always. It was not until we got to the apartment building and the elevator took us down to our floor that a relative silence closed around us - the subway noise that shook the walls was no louder than one could speak freely - and yet we cautiously postponed all conversations until we entered. If someone had come to us to talk in the elevator, no suspicion would have been more natural than for us to discuss topics that we did not want the children or the maid to hear. Such cases had occurred when state enemies and other criminals wanted to use the elevator as a conspiracy room; it was also close at hand, because for technical reasons police ears and police eyes could not be mounted in an elevator and because the gatekeeper used to have nothing to do but run and listen in the stairwells. So we kept quiet until we stepped into the family room, where the maid of the week had already set the supper and waited with the children, whom she had picked up from the house's apartment. She appeared to be a proper and decent girl, and our friendly greeting was not only due to the awareness that she, like all maids, was obliged to report on the family at the end of the week - a reform which was generally considered to have improved the tone in many Home. An atmosphere of joy and coziness prevailed around our table, especially as our eldest son, Ossu, was with the rest of us. He had come to visit from the children's camp, because it was home evening.","We could not talk, of course, because of the air force exercises, which permitted no conversation to be held out of doors either by day or by night. At any rate, she saw my pleased expression and nodded encouragingly, though serious as always. Not until we had entered the building and the lift had taken us down to our apartment did a relative silence enclose us – the rumble of the metro, which shook the walls, was still sufficiently muffled for us to be able to converse unhindered – and yet we were careful to delay all talk until we were inside the apartment. Had anyone heard us talking in the lift, they would quite naturally have suspected that we were discussing matters we did not want the children or the home help to hear. There had been cases where enemies of the state and other criminals tried to use the lift as a conspirators’ den; after all, it was an obvious choice, as for technical reasons police ears and police eyes could not be installed in a lift, and the concierge usually had other things to do than run up and down listening on the landings. So we took care to say nothing until we entered the family room, where that week’s home help had already set the table for dinner and was waiting with the children, whom she had fetched down from the residents’ creche. She seemed to be a nice, orderly girl, and our friendly greeting was prompted by more than our awareness that she, like all home helps, was duty-bound to deliver a report on the family at the end of the week – a reform generally considered to have improved the ambience in many homes. An aura of happiness and well-being reigned around our table, especially as our eldest son Ossu was present among us. He had arrived on a visit from the children’s camp, as it was a home evening.","To talk was of course out of the question due to the constant maneuvers of the air force which day and night prevented any conversation out of doors. Anyway, she acknowledged my happy looks and nodded encouragingly, although serious as ever. Not until we reached our living-complex and the elevator was taking us underground to our apartment did a comparative quiet envelop us—the noise of the subway which shook the walls was not loud enough to hinder conversation—yet we cautiously [p. 8] delayed all talk until we were inside our home. Had someone happened to overhear us in the elevator no suspicion could have been more natural than that we were discussing subjects which we did not wish the children or the home-assistant to hear. Cases were indeed on record where the State enemies and other criminals had attempted to use the elevator as a place of conspiracy; this was obviously safer since police-ears and police-eyes for technical reasons could not be installed in the elevators, and the janitor of course could not be expected to listen at the elevator opening every moment since he also had other duties. Cautiously, then, we said nothing until we reached our family room, where the home-assistant for that week had already put the evening meal on the table and was waiting with the children, whom she had fetched from the apartment house kindergarten. She seemed a decent and capable sort of girl, and our friendly greeting was motivated by more than just our awareness that, like all home-assistants, she was charged with the duty to report on the family at the end of the week; this was a reform generally considered to have improved the atmosphere in many homes. There was an air of happiness and coziness at our table, especially as our oldest son, Ossu, was with us. He had come for a visit from the children's camp, since this was home-evening."
"Antingen de inte hörde eller de hade andra order – hur som helst släppte de mig inte. Sedan de undersökt mig och avväpnat mig – jag var ju i polis- och militäruniform för festens skull – bands jag väl och lastades på ett slags smal trehjuling, som några karlar hastigt fogat samman av lätta smådelar och som tycktes vara extra uttänkt för fångtransport. Jag blev alltså fastskruvad i baksätet, inte påfallande obekvämt, men utan möjlighet att röra mig, medan en av soldaterna hoppade upp på framsätet och satte fart.","Either they did not hear or they had other orders - anyway, they did not release me. After they examined me and disarmed me - I was in police and military uniform for the party - I was tied up and loaded on a kind of narrow tricycle, which some men hastily joined together from light small parts and which seemed to be extra conceived for prisoner transport. So I was screwed in the back seat, not noticeably uncomfortable, but without the opportunity to move, while one of the soldiers jumped up on the front seat and accelerated.","Perhaps they could not hear me or they had different orders – but either way they did not let me go. After they had searched me and disarmed me – I was in police and military uniform because of the banquet – I was bound tightly and loaded on to a sort of narrow three-wheeled vehicle which some men had quickly assembled from lightweight components and which seemed to be especially designed for transporting prisoners. Then I was tied to the back seat, not really uncomfortably, but making it impossible for me to move, while one of the soldiers jumped into the front seat and drove the vehicle off.","Whether they did not hear, or had other orders, in any case they did not release me. After they had searched me [p. 188] and disarmed me—I was in military police uniform because of the festival—I was tied hand and foot and placed on a sort of three-wheeled vehicle which some of the men had quickly put together from light parts and which seemed to be especially intended for prisoner transport. Consequently I was fastened firmly to the back seat—not especially uncomfortable but unable to move—while one soldier jumped up on the front seat and started off."
"– Känner ni inte till Reor? frågade hon. Nej, han lever inte nu, han levde så där för en femti år sen, i någon av kvarnstäderna säger somliga, men andra säger i någon av textilstäderna.

Vill man berätta om Reor, måste man vända sig till de invigda. Han gick omkring hit och dit, för på den tiden var det annorlunda med licenserna, och somliga tog emot honom av rädsla, för de trodde han hörde till polisen, och andra jagade bort honom, för de trodde han var en brottsling. Men den som tog emot honom – ja, alla märkte förstås inte hurdan han var, somliga tyckte bara han var konstig, men andra kände att de kunde vara trygga och lugna hos honom som ett litet barn hos sin mor. Några glömde honom, men andra glömde honom aldrig, och de berättade om honom så gott de kunde. Men det förstår bara de invigda. Han låste aldrig sin dörr. Han brydde sig aldrig om några vittnen eller bevis på något som han sa eller gjorde. Han skyddade sig inte mot tjuvar och rånmördare ens, så han blev också rånmördad till slut, av en som trodde att Reor hade en kaka bröd i sin ränsel. Det var svälttider då.

Some forgot him, but others never forgot him, and they told about him as best they could. But only the initiates understand that. He never locked his door. He never cared about any witnesses or evidence of anything he said or did. He did not even protect himself from thieves and robber murderers, so he was also robbed in the end, by someone who thought that Reor had a cake of bread in his bag. It was a time of famine then.

"– Det är ju nog, det här, sade jag, halvt vänd till Rissen, halvt till polischefen. Vi har lyckats få ur henne alla uppgifter mannen hade fått i uppdrag att lämna. Resten är ju oväsentligheter.","- That's enough, this, I said, half turned to Rissen, half to the police chief. We have managed to get out of her all the information the man had been instructed to provide. The rest is insignificant.","‘It’s enough, what we have here,’ I said, turning half to Rissen and half to the police chief. ‘We’ve succeeded in getting out of her all the information the husband had been tasked with delivering.

"En uppgift till lyckades jag snappa upp, den gången inte av Rissen, utan av en kvinnlig kursdeltagare, till och med utan att jag frågade. Hon berättade något om skriftsamlingar, som en av de häktade hade talat om – tjocka papperssamlingar med tecken som skulle föreställa toner men inte alls liknade våra bokstavsbeteckningar. Närmast måste de påminna om fågelkroppar bakom ett tvärgaller, tycktes det. Ingen kunde tyda dem, inte ens de kringsmygande invånarna i ökenstaden, fast de måste ha ofantliga samlingar från längst försvunna tider. Jag var ganska viss på att fanns det någon musik alls i de där tecknen – det kunde ju lika gärna vara bluff alltihop – så måste det vara en primitiv och barbarisk musik. Ändå hade jag en nästan vild längtan efter att få höra dem tydas en gång – en dum dröm, som väl aldrig skulle gå i fullbordan, varken för mig eller för någon annan. Och även om den hade gjort det – i en samling marscher kan det ju omöjligt ligga någon mening, hur skulle där finnas någon hjälp eller någon lösning på ett problem?","I managed to pick up another task, this time not by Rissen, but by a female course participant, even without me asking. She told us something about collections of writings that one of the detainees had talked about - thick collections of paper with characters that would represent tones but did not resemble our letter designations at all. Most likely, they have to resemble bird bodies behind a cross grille, it seemed. No one could decipher them, not even the wandering inhabitants of the desert city, though they must have vast collections from long gone times. I was pretty sure that if there was any music at all in those characters - it could just as well be a scam all together - so it must be a primitive and barbaric music. Still, I had an almost wild longing to hear them interpreted once - a stupid dream, which would probably never come to fruition, neither for me nor for anyone else. And even if it had done so - in a collection of marches it may not be possible to make any sense, how would there be any help or solution to a problem?","I was able to glean one more piece of information, this time not from Rissen but from a female student, even without asking. She was saying something about collections of writing, which one of the remand prisoners had talked about – thick volumes of documents that contained signs that were said to represent musical notes, but did not at all resemble our conventional notation. They almost made one think of the bodies of birds behind the bars of a cage, apparently. No one could decipher them, not even the furtive inhabitants of the desert city, though they must have had immense collections from ages long past. I was quite certain that if there were music in all those signs – it might all equally well be a hoax – it must be music of a primitive and barbarous kind. Yet I had an almost uncontrollable longing to hear them performed – a stupid dream that would probably never be fulfilled, either for me or for anyone else. And even if it were, there could not possibly be any meaning in what must be a collection of military marches, so how would there be any help in them, or any solution to a problem?","One more piece of information I was able to pick up, not from Rissen this time but from a female course-participant, even without my asking. She was talking about scrolls one of the arrested individuals had spoken of—thick stacks of documents with signs supposed to indicate musical notes but not at all like our printed music with alphabetical notation. They were said to look like bird-bodies behind a grill, as it were. No one could solve them, not even the dwellers lurking in the desert city, although there must be enormous collections from long ago epochs. I felt quite sure that if there was any music at all in those signs—the whole thing might be a hoax—it must be a primitive and barbaric music. Yet I had an [p. 135] almost wild longing to hear it solved some time, a silly dream that probably never would be fulfilled, neither for me nor for anyone else.

Ett slags avslappning inträdde. Ännu en gång bröt han tystnaden:,A kind of relaxation ensued. Once again he broke the silence:,A kind of relaxation ensued. Once more he broke the silence:,A sort of relaxation followed. Then he broke the silence again:
"– Visst. Det var så konstigt så. Jag kom in, och det var bara folk som jag inte kände. Nå, det var ju inget underligt. Offrar man en ledig kväll på sällskapsliv, så brukar det väl vara för att diskutera någonting, något som rör ens arbete eller något annat, en planerad fest eller en skrivelse till myndigheterna eller så, och då är det så klart att man inte känner alla som är bjudna. Men det var inget sånt! De diskuterade inte alls. De satt och pratade om allt möjligt, eller också teg de. Att de teg så mycket, det gjorde mig hjärtängslig. Och för resten, bara som de hälsade! De tog tag i händerna på varandra. Är det klokt! Ohygieniskt måste det vara, och så intimt så man skäms, dessutom. Att röra vid varandras kroppar så där, avsiktligt! De påstod att det var en urgammal hälsning, som de hade upplivat igen, men man behövde inte göra det, om man inte ville, man var inte tvungen till någonting. Men i början var jag rädd för dem. Ingenting är så otäckt som att sitta och vara tyst. Man har en känsla av att folk genomskådar en. Som om man var naken eller värre än naken. Andligen naken. Särskilt när det är äldre med, för de kan ha hunnit lära sig att se tvärsigenom en, för resten om de pratar också, de har hunnit lära sig prata med ytan och vara på sin vakt under ytan. Det har redan hänt mig att jag också har kunnat det, prata med ytan och vara på min vakt under ytan, och då känner man sig glad efteråt, som om man hade undgått en fara. Men där kunde jag inte det. Ingen av dem skulle nappat på det. När de talade, talade de lågt, och det verkade som om de inte tänkte på annat under tiden. Annars tycker jag det är bättre att tala högt, så man fängslar de andras uppmärksamhet, man talar högt och har tankarna med sig på annat håll. Men de var så konstiga. Till slut tyckte jag det var skönt och började tycka om dem. Det var lugnt på något sätt.","- Sure. It was so weird then. I came in, and it was just people I did not know. Well, that was no wonder. If you sacrifice a free evening in social life, it is usually to discuss something, something that concerns your work or something else, a planned party or a letter to the authorities or so, and then it is of course that you do not know everyone who are invited. But there was no such thing! They did not discuss at all. They sat and talked about everything, or they kept quiet. That they were silent so much, it made me heartbroken. And by the way, just as they greeted! They grabbed each other's hands. Is that wise! It must be unhygienic, and so intimate as to be ashamed, moreover. To touch each other's bodies like that, intentionally! They claimed that it was an ancient greeting, which they had revived, but you did not have to do it, if you did not want to, you did not have to do anything. But in the beginning, I was afraid of them. Nothing is as nasty as sitting and being quiet. You have a feeling that people see through you. As if you were naked or worse than naked. Spiritually naked. Especially when it's older, because they may have had time to learn to see through one, by the way if they also talk, they have had time to learn to talk to the surface and be on their guard below the surface. It has already happened to me that I have also been able to, talk to the surface and be on my guard under the surface, and then you feel happy afterwards, as if you had escaped a danger. But there I could not. None of them would take it. When they spoke, they spoke softly, and it seemed as if they were not thinking about anything else in the meantime. Otherwise, I think it's better to speak loudly, so you capture the attention of others, you speak loudly and have your thoughts with you elsewhere. But they were so weird. In the end, I thought it was nice and started to like them. It was quiet somehow.","‘Of course. It was so peculiar, though. When I got in I didn’t know any of the people there.

"Det hade hänt på en fest för två månader sedan. En av ungdomslägrets samlingslokaler stod prydd med långa dukar i de färger som är Statens, man uppförde sketcher, höll tal, marscherade genom salen till trumma och åt tillsammans. Anledningen var den, att en trupp flickor i ungdomslägret fått order om förflyttning, man visste inte riktigt vart, det gick vissa rykten om en annan av kemistäderna, andra om en av skostäderna, i varje fall någon plats, där man råkat på balans både i fråga om arbetskraft och i fråga om procentförhållandet mellan könen. Från vår stad, och förmodligen från en del andra städer också, samlades alltså unga kvinnor ihop och skickades dit bort, för att de en gång fastställda siffrorna skulle kunna vidmakthållas. Och det var nu avskedsfesten för de utkallade som firades.","It had happened at a party two months ago. One of the youth camp's meeting rooms was adorned with long canvases in the colors that are the State, they erected sketches, gave speeches, marched through the hall to the drum and ate together. The reason was that a troop of girls in the youth camp had been ordered to move, they did not really know where, there were some rumors about another of the chemistry cities, others about one of the shoe cities, at least some place, where they happened to be in balance both in in terms of labor force and in terms of the percentage ratio between the sexes. From our city, and probably from some other cities as well, young women were gathered and sent away, so that the once established figures could be maintained. And it was now the farewell party for the called ones that was celebrated.","CHAPTER 2 It had happened at a celebration two months earlier. One of the youth camp’s assembly halls was decorated with long banners in the colours that are those of the State. Sketches were performed, speeches delivered, people marched through the hall to the beat of the drum and dined together. The occasion for all this was that a group of girls in the youth camp had received orders that they were to be transferred, no one really knew where. Some rumours said that it might be another chemistry city, others that it was one of the shoe cities, or at any rate a place where there was a deficit both in terms of labour force and of male versus female ratios. And so from our city, and presumably a number of others, too, young women were assembled and sent there so that the numbers that once had been established might be maintained.

The reason for the festivities was that a group of girls in the youth camp had received orders of transfer, no one knew exactly where; there were rumors about another chemistry city, but there was also talk that perhaps one of the shoe cities might be the destination; anyway some place that happened to be unbalanced with regard to available labor force as well as to the ratio of the sexes. From our city, and probably also from other cities, young girls were consequently ordered to be sent there to re-balance the once established numbers. And now we were celebrating the departure of those called up."

"Linda låg där i den skumma belysningen så vacker som jag sällan hade sett henne. Med sin nakna guldskimrande arm hade hon dragit upp filten till hakan, som om hon försökte skyla sig, trots att det var mycket varmt i rummet. Huvudet hade hon vridit åt andra sidan, så att den regelbundna profilen avtecknade sig klart mot skuggorna på kudden; huden lyste som jämn levande sammet mot hennes tunga svarta ögonbryn och ögonfransar. Den spända röda bågen hade slappnat i sömnen till en mjuk och mycket trött flickmun. Så ung hade jag aldrig sett henne som vaken, inte ens då vi först lärde känna varandra, och aldrig så rörande. Jag, som brukade vara rädd för att hon var så stark, greps nästan av medlidande med hennes hjälplösa barnsliga svaghet. Den Linda, som nu låg där framför mig, skulle jag velat närma mig på ett annat sätt, ömt och varsamt som om det var första gången vi möttes. Men jag visste, att väckte jag henne, skulle den röda bågen spännas och ögonen förvandlas till strålkastare igen. Hon skulle sätta sig rak och klarvaken i sängen och med rynkade ögonbryn upptäcka duken och kudden på väggen. Och om jag ändå ville närma mig, om jag kom med kärlek för att skyla min misstro, vad skulle det tjäna till? Ett ögonblicks illusion av samhörighet, ett rus som var över i morgon – och jag skulle inte ens veta, var jag hade henne i fråga om Rissen.","Linda lay there in the dim lighting as beautiful as I had seldom seen her. With her bare gold-shimmering arm, she had pulled the blanket up to her chin, as if trying to cover herself, even though it was very hot in the room. She had turned her head to the other side, so that the regular profile clearly stood out against the shadows on the pillow; her skin shone like smooth living velvet against her heavy black eyebrows and eyelashes. The tense red bow had relaxed in the sleep of a soft and very tired girl's mouth. I had never seen her so young awake, not even when we first got to know each other, and never so touchingly. I, who used to be afraid that she was so strong, was almost seized by pity for her helpless childish weakness. The Linda, who was now lying there in front of me, I would have liked to approach in a different way, tenderly and gently as if it were the first time we met. But I knew that if I woke her up, the red bow would tighten and my eyes would turn into headlights again. She would sit up straight and wide awake in bed and with wrinkled eyebrows discover the tablecloth and pillow on the wall. And if I still wanted to approach, if I came with love to cover my disbelief, what good would it do? A moment's illusion of belonging, a intoxication that was over tomorrow - and I would not even know where I had her in the case of Rissen.","As Linda lay there in the dim lighting, I had seldom seen her so beautiful. With her naked, gold-shimmering arm she had drawn the coverlet up to her chin, as if she were trying to protect herself from the chill, although the room was very warm. She had twisted her head to one side, so that her regular profile was clearly visible against the shadows on the pillow; her skin glowed like smooth, living velvet against her heavy black eyebrows and eyelashes. The taut red bow of her mouth had relaxed in sleep to the soft and very tired lips of a girl. I had never seen her look so young when awake, not even when we were first becoming acquainted with each other, and never so emotionally affecting. Though I was usually so afraid of her because of her strength, I was almost seized by compassion for her helpless, childlike weakness. The Linda who now lay there before me I would have liked to approach in a different way, tenderly and carefully as if it were the first time we had met. But I knew that if I woke her, the red bow would tauten and the eyes turn into spotlights again. She would sit up straight and wide-awake in bed and with a frown discover the cloth and the pillow on the wall. And what if I still wanted to approach her, if I brought her love in order to conceal my mistrust, what purpose would it serve? A moment’s illusion of togetherness, an intoxication that would be over by tomorrow – and I would not even know where I stood with her on the matter of Rissen.","I looked at Linda in the faint light, as beautiful as I seldom had seen her.

"N:r 135 hade varit feg och dolt sin feghet. Han hade åtminstone haft sin vackra sida, när han höll det stora ögonblicket i sitt liv heligt. De andra var lika fega som han, somliga åtskilligt mer till och med. Där fanns de som bara klagade, inte bara över sitt kall, såren, sjukdomarna och rädslan, som var deras självvalda lott, utan också över en mängd oväsentliga saker, sängarna på Hemmet, den försämrade mathållningen (de hade alltså också märkt det!), slarv i sjukvården. Man kunde nog tänka sig, att där hade funnits ett stort ögonblick i deras liv också, men det hade i så fall redan sjunkit undan utom räckhåll. De hade kanske inte uppbjudit så stor viljekraft heller som n:r 135 för att hålla det kvar. Sanningen att säga: hur lite heroisk n:r 135 än hade verkat, medan han satt i sitt kallocainrus – då jag sedan jämförde honom med de andra, började han faktiskt förefalla mig åtminstone som en relativ hjälte. – Men dessutom fanns det en hel del annat, som äcklade och skrämde mig hos de andra försökspersoner vi använde under den första tiden: mer eller mindre utvecklade konstigheter, kusliga fantasier, lössläppt liderlighet i det tysta. Sedan fanns det några, som inte begagnade sig av Hemmet, utan var gifta och hade egen bostad; de lade ut sina äktenskapliga svårigheter på ett sätt som var både ynkligt och löjligt. Kort sagt, antingen måste man förtvivla om Frivilliga offertjänsten, eller om alla Världsstatens medsoldater, eller om den biologiska arten människa överhuvudtaget.","No. 135 had been cowardly and hid his cowardice. He had at least had his beautiful side, when he kept the great moment in his life sacred. The others were as cowardly as he was, some much more so. There were those who only complained, not only about their cold, the wounds, the diseases and the fear, which was their lot, but also about a lot of insignificant things, the beds at Home, the deteriorating diet (they had also noticed it!), carelessness in healthcare. One could probably imagine that there had been a great moment in their lives as well, but in that case it had already sunk out of reach. They might not have offered as much willpower as No. 135 to keep it going. Truth be told: no matter how a little heroic No. 135 had seemed, while sitting in his callocaine intoxication - when I then compared him to the others, he actually began to appear to me at least as a relative hero. - But in addition, there were a lot of other things that disgusted and frightened me in the other subjects we used during the first time: more or less developed strangeness, eerie fantasies, unleashed horniness in the quiet. Then there were some who did not use the Home, but were married and had their own home; they presented their marital difficulties in a way that was both pathetic and ridiculous. In short, one must either despair about the Voluntary Sacrifice Service, or about all the fellow soldiers of the World State, or about the biological species of man in general.","No. 135 had been cowardly and hidden his cowardice. At least in keeping the great moment in his life sacred he had shown an attractive side of his nature. The others were as cowardly as he, some even rather more so.

One might have thought that there had been a great moment in their lives, too, but if so it had already sunk out of reach. Perhaps they had not exerted such a large amount of willpower as 135 had done in order to keep it intact. To tell the truth: no matter how unheroic No. 135 had seemed as he sat there in his Kallocain intoxication, when I compared him with the others he actually began to strike me as a relative hero. But there were also a great many other things that disgusted and frightened me in the test subjects we used during the initial period: more or less developed oddities, macabre fantasies, surreptitious lechery. Then there were some who did not avail themselves of the Home, but were married and had their own apartments; they exposed their marital problems in a manner that was both pathetic and laughable.

One might well imagine that a great moment had existed in their lives also, but in that case it had already sunk too deep to be recaptured. Perhaps they had not used as great will power as No. 135 to keep it alive. The truth was that however poor a hero No. 135 had seemed while under the Kallocain intoxication, when I later compared him with the others he assumed the stature of at least a comparative hero in my estimation. But there was so much else that disgusted and frightened me with the other test-persons we used in those early days: more or less developed abnormalities, eery fantasies, unbridled secret debauchery.

"Långa tider efteråt grubblade jag över varför jag svarade ja. Rädsla var det inte. Jag hade varit rädd nästan hela mitt liv, jag hade varit feg – vad innehåller hela min bok annat än berättelsen om min feghet! – men just då var jag inte rädd. Allt jag hade rum för var en måttlös besvikelse över att jag aldrig skulle komma fram till dem som väntade. – Inte heller hade jag en tanke på att mitt liv skulle vara något att hålla på under sådana omständigheter som dessa. Fånge eller död tycktes mig just då vara precis detsamma. I båda fallen var min väg fram till de andra avbruten. När jag senare fick klart för mig, att min uppfinning visst inte hade räddat mig, att mitt liv i alla fall skulle sparats, att ett stort antal fångar var en önskvärd vinst för grannstaten, eftersom nativiteten där lika lite som hos oss höll jämna steg med förlustsiffrorna i de stora krigen – då framkallade det ingen ånger, ändrade ingenting i min hållning. Jag gav dem min uppfinning därför att jag helt enkelt ville att den skulle finnas kvar. Om Kemistaden n:r 4 lades i ruiner, om hela Världsstaten förvandlades till en öken av aska och sten, så ville jag åtminstone kunna tänka mig, att någonstans i andra länder och bland andra folk en ny Linda skulle tala som den första, frivilligt, där någon velat tvinga henne, och en annan skara av skräckslagna angivare lyssna till en ny Rissen. Det var naturligtvis vidskepelse, eftersom ingenting kan upprepas, men jag hade ingenting annat att göra. Det var min enda svaga möjlighet att ändå fortsätta där jag blivit hejdad.","For a long time afterwards, I pondered why I answered yes. There was no fear. I had been scared almost my whole life, I had been a coward - what does my whole book contain other than the story of my cowardice! - but just then I was not afraid. All I had room for was an immeasurable disappointment that I would never reach those who were waiting. - Nor did I have a thought that my life would be something to do in such circumstances as these. Prisoner or death seemed to me to be exactly the same at the time. In both cases, my path to the others was interrupted. When I later realized that my invention had certainly not saved me, that my life would at least be saved, that a large number of prisoners was a desirable gain for the neighboring state, because the nativity there as little as with us kept pace with the loss figures in the great wars - then it evoked no remorse, changed nothing in my attitude. I gave them my invention because I simply wanted it to remain. If Chemistry City No. 4 was laid in ruins, if the whole World State was turned into a desert of ash and stone, then I at least wanted to be able to imagine that somewhere in other countries and among other peoples a new Linda would speak as the first, voluntarily, where someone wanted to force her, and another crowd of terrified informants listened to a new crack.

Hädanefter kan ingen brottsling neka till sanningen. Inte ens våra innersta tankar är våra egna längre – som vi så länge har trott, med orätt.","- Quite right, I said, that was the worst case. But before it went that far, it often happened that the drunks talked next to their mouths, betrayed secrets and committed careless acts, because their ability to be ashamed and afraid was disturbed. These are the effects my means have - I think, because I have not finished trying yet. But there is the difference, that it is not swallowed, but injected directly into the blood, and for the rest it has a completely different composition. The unpleasant after-effects that you mentioned also lack it - at least you do not have to give such strong doses. A slight headache is everything the subject notices afterwards, and it does not happen, as sometimes happens with alcoholics, that you forget what you have said afterwards. - You probably understand that it is an important invention. From now on, no criminal can deny the truth. Not even our innermost thoughts are our own anymore - as we have long believed, wrongly.","‘That’s right,’ I said. ‘That’s how it was in the worst cases. But before it went that far, it often happened that the intoxicated people talked indiscreetly, betrayed secrets and did incautious things, as their capacity for shame and fear was removed. Those are the effects my drug has – at least I believe so, for I haven’t yet been able to conduct conclusive tests. But the difference is that it isn’t swallowed, but is injected directly into the blood and actually has quite a different chemical composition. It also lacks the unpleasant after-effects you mentioned – at least, one doesn’t have to administer such large doses. A slight headache is all that the test subject feels afterwards, and there is no incidence, as there sometimes was with alcohol-intoxicated subjects, of people being unable to remember what they said. I think you will understand that it’s an important discovery. From now on no criminal will be able to deny the truth. Not even our most intimate thoughts will be our own any more – as we have for so long believed, mistakenly.’","""Quite right,"" I said. ""It was sometimes like that in the worst cases. But before it reached such a stage it often happened that the intoxicated one blabbed, disclosed secrets, and did reckless things, because his capacity for shame and fear was disturbed. My discovery has the same effect, I believe, though it has not yet been proven. It has this difference, however, that it need not be swallowed but is injected into the bloodstream, and has altogether a [p. 13] different composition. The unpleasant aftereffects you spoke of are also absent; and only very small doses are required. A light headache is all that the experimental person feels afterwards, and it does not happen, as it often did with the alcohol-intoxicated, that one forgets what one has said. You must realize how important a discovery it is; from now on no criminal can deny the truth. Not even our innermost thoughts are our own, as we so long have believed, unjustifiably."""

"Tanken grep mig. Jag visste, att förr, under den civilistiska epoken, hade människorna måst lockas till arbete och ansträngning genom hopp om rymligare bostäder, läckrare mat och vackrare kläder. Numera behövdes ingenting sådant. Standardvåningen – ett rum för de ogifta, två för familj – räckte gott åt alla, från de ringaste till de mest förtjänta. Huskökets mat gav mättnad åt generalen likaväl som åt den menige. Den allmänna uniformen – en för arbetet, en för fritiden och en för militär- och polistjänsten – var lika för alla, för man och kvinna, och för hög och låg sånär som på gradbeteckningen. Till och med den senare var egentligen inte grannare för den ene än för den andre. Det eftersträvansvärda i en högre chefsbeteckning låg enbart i vad den symboliserade. Så högt förandligad, tänkte jag lycklig, är faktiskt varenda medsoldat i Världsstaten, att det han anar som livets högsta värde knappast har någon mera konkret form för honom än tre svarta slingor på ärmen – tre svarta slingor, som är honom en pant både på egen självaktning och aktning från andras sida. Av materiella njutningar kan man säkert få nog och mer än nog – just därför misstänker jag att de gamla civilistiska kapitalisternas tolvrumsvåningar knappt heller var mer än en symbol – men detta subtilaste av allt, som man jagar under formen av gradbeteckningar, det gör ingen övermätt. Ingen kan ha så mycket aktning och så mycket självaktning, att han inte vill ha mer. På det mest förandligade, det mest luftiga och ouppnåeliga av allt vilar vår fasta samhällsordning trygg för alla tider.","The thought gripped me. I knew that in the past, during the civilian era, people had to be attracted to work and effort by hoping for more spacious housing, more delicious food and more beautiful clothes. Nowadays, nothing like that was needed. The standard floor - one room for the unmarried, two for the family - was good enough for everyone, from the smallest to the most deserving. The house kitchen's food gave satiety to the general as well as to the private. The general uniform - one for work, one for leisure and one for military and police service - was the same for everyone, for men and women, and too high and low except for the degree designation. Even the latter was not really closer to one than to the other. What was desirable in a higher managerial designation lay solely in what it symbolized. So highly spiritualized, I thought happy, is in fact every single fellow soldier in the World State, that what he senses as the highest value of life hardly has any more concrete form for him than three black loops on his sleeve - three black loops, which are to him a pledge both on his own self-respect and respect on the part of others. Of material pleasures one can certainly get enough and more than enough - which is why I suspect that the twelve-room apartments of the old civilist capitalists were hardly more than a symbol - but this most subtle of all, which one hunts for in the form of degrees, does not overwhelm. No one can have so much respect and so much self-respect, that he does not want more. On the most spiritual, the most airy and unattainable of all, rests our fixed social order secure for all time.","The thought gripped me. I knew that in the olden days, during the civilian era, people had to be lured to work and exertion by the hope of more spacious accommodation, better food and more attractive clothes. Nowadays nothing like that was needed. The standard apartment – one room for the unmarried, two for families – was sufficient for all, from the lowliest to the most deserving. The food from the house kitchen brought satiety to the general as well as to the private. The regular uniform – one for work, one for leisure and one for the military and police service – was the same for all, for man and woman, and for high and low, except for the rank markings. Even the latter were no more ostentatious for one person than for another. The desirable feature of a higher executive marking lay only in what it symbolized. So loftily ethereal is each single fellow soldier in the World State, I mused happily to myself, that what he considers to possess the highest value has no more tangible form for him than three black loops upon his sleeve – three black loops that are a pledge both of his own self-respect and of respect from others. It is indeed possible to have enough of material comforts, and more than enough – and for precisely that reason I suspect that the old civilian capitalist twelve-room apartments were scarcely more than a symbol – but of this most subtle distinction of all, which is pursued in the form of rank markings, no one can have too much. No one can have so much respect and so much self-respect that they do not want more. On the things that are most ethereal, most evanescent and elusive of all does our unshakable social order rest securely for all time.","The thought stirred me. I knew that in days gone by, during the Civilian Era, it had been necessary to entice people to effort and work through hope for roomier living quarters, better food, and more attractive dress. Nowadays nothing of this sort was required. The standard apartment—one room for unmarried, two for a family— was sufficient for all, from the lowest to the most deserving. The food of the establishment satisfied the top general as well as the private. The common uniform—one for work, one for leisure, and one for military and police [p. 7] service—was the same for all, for men and women, for high and low, except for the insignia. This last was actually no fancier for one than for another. The desirability of higher insignia lay purely in what it symbolized. I thought happily, so highly spiritualized is actually every fellow-soldier in the Worldstate that the goal he visualizes as the paramount attainment needs no more concrete expression than three black chevrons on his sleeve—three black chevrons which are collateral for both his own self-respect and the respect of others. Of material enjoyments one can assuredly obtain enough, and more than enough (and therefore I suspect that the old civilian-capitalistic twelve-room apartments were hardly anything more than a symbol), but of this something, most subtle of all, pursued in the shape of insignia, there can never be a surfeit. No one can enjoy so much esteem, and so much self-esteem, that he does not crave for more. On this, the most sublime, most lofty, and most sought after, rests our solid social system, secure for all time."
"Men den reaktion jag väntade mig tycktes utebli. Då hon slog upp ögonen, var de mycket tankfulla, men lika lugnt vidöppna som vanligt, och de mötte mina utan att vända sig bort. Hennes mun skrämde mig. Den röda bågen ville inte spänna sig som vanligt, den låg alltjämt vilande och slapp, så att ansiktet höll kvar sitt barnsliga uttryck från sömnen och ruset. Jag visste inte, att det kunde finnas en högtidlighet, som skrämde, i en sådan brist på behärskning. Läpparna rörde sig svagt, som om hon upprepade sina ord för sig själv. Jag hade ingenting att säga henne, kunde inte störa henne, satt bara stilla och såg på hennes ansikte.","But the reaction I expected seemed to be absent. When she opened her eyes, they were very thoughtful, but as calmly wide-open as usual, and they met mine without turning away. Her mouth scared me.

I did not know that there could be a solemnity that frightened, in such a lack of mastery. Her lips moved faintly, as if she were repeating her words to herself.

"Jag har också berättat, att de första åren av min fångenskap var fulla av ångest och grubbel. Några faktiska uppgifter om Kemistadens öde lyckades jag aldrig få, men småningom räknade jag ut, vilken plan fienden hade följt. Meningen måste ha varit att gasbelägga gatorna och hindra all lufttillförsel till stadens undre delar, tills invånarna i desperation skulle smyga sig upp genom de få kvarlämnade utgångarna, en och en eller i små skaror, och ge sig fångna åt fiendens vaktmanskap. Hur länge syrebehållarna i stadens innandömen kunde räcka och om befolkningens mod var sådant att den föredrog döden framför att överlämna sig, eller tvärtom, visste jag inte. Tänkbart var ju också, att hela belägringen misslyckades, att hjälp anlände från andra delar av Världsstaten. Som sagt, jag har aldrig fått veta det. Men i vilket fall som helst fanns det en möjlighet att Linda var i livet. Kanske också Rissen, om de inte hunnit avrätta honom än. Jag medger, att det är en osannolik fantasi, och ville jag fråga mitt förnuft, borde jag säkert tillbringa resten av mitt liv i förtvivlan. Då jag nu inte gör det, visar det kanske bara, att min självbevarelsedrift tvingar mig att söka tröst i bländverk. Själv sade Rissen innan han dömdes: ”Jag vet att vad jag är tar vägen någonstans.” Jag är inte säker på hur han menade. Men det händer mig, när jag sitter på min brits med slutna ögon, att jag lyckas se stjärnorna glimta och höra vinden susa som den natten, och jag kan inte, jag kan inte utrota den illusionen ur min själ, att jag ännu, trots allt, är med om att skapa en ny värld.","I have also told you that the first years of my captivity were full of anxiety and brooding. I never managed to get any actual information about the fate of the Chemist City, but eventually I figured out what plan the enemy had followed. The intention must have been to gasify the streets and prevent all air supply to the lower parts of the city, until the inhabitants in desperation would sneak up through the few exits left, one by one or in small crowds, and give themselves captive to the enemy's guards. I did not know how long the oxygen tanks in the city's interiors would last and whether the population's courage was such that it preferred death to surrender, or vice versa. It was also conceivable that the whole siege failed, that aid arrived from other parts of the World State. That said, I've never been told that. But in any case, there was a possibility that Linda was alive. Maybe also Rissen, if they have not had time to execute him yet. I admit, it's an unlikely fantasy, and if I wanted to ask my reason, I should surely spend the rest of my life in despair. Since I do not do it now, it may just show that my self-preservation drive forces me to seek solace in glare. Rissen himself said before he was convicted: ""I know that what I am takes the road somewhere."" I'm not sure what he meant. But it happens to me, when I sit on my bunk with my eyes closed, that I manage to see the stars twinkle and hear the wind whistling like that night, and I can not, I can not eradicate that illusion from my soul, that I still, after all , is helping to create a new world.","I have also described how the first years of my imprisonment were full of brooding and anguish.

How long the oxygen tanks in the bowels of the city could last and whether the population was brave enough to prefer death to surrender, or vice versa, I did not know. It was also conceivable that the siege failed, that help arrived from other parts of the World State. As I say, I have never been able to find out. But whatever happened, there was a chance that Linda was still alive. Perhaps Rissen, too, if they had not managed to execute him yet. I admit that it is an improbable fantasy, and were I to listen to my common sense I ought surely to spend the rest of my life in despair. As that is not the case, perhaps it merely shows that my instinct for self-preservation compels me to seek comfort in delusion. Before he was sentenced, Rissen himself said: ‘I know that what I am is on the way somewhere.’ I am not sure what he meant. But sometimes, as I sit on my bunk with my eyes closed, I can see the gleam of the stars and hear the murmur of the wind as I did that night, and I cannot, I cannot eradicate from my soul the illusion that still, in spite of everything, I am taking part in the creation of a new world.","I have also related how the first years of my imprisonment were filled with anxiety and speculations.

"Vid den tid då min berättelse börjar närmade jag mig de fyrti. Om jag för övrigt bör presentera mig, kan jag kanske tala om under vilken bild jag tänkte mig livet. Det finns få saker som säger mer om en människa än hennes bild av livet: om hon ser det som en väg, ett fältslag, ett växande träd eller ett rullande hav. För min del såg jag det med en snäll skolgosses ögon som en trappa, där man skyndade från avsats till avsats så fort man kunde, med flämtande andetag och medtävlaren i hälarna. I själva verket hade jag inte många medtävlare. De flesta av mina arbetskamrater på laboratoriet hade förlagt hela sin ärelystnad till det militära och ansåg dagens arbete som ett tråkigt men nödvändigt avbrott i kvällarnas militärtjänstgöring. Själv skulle jag väl knappast velat tillstå för någon av dem, hur mycket mer intresserad jag var av min kemi än av min militärtjänst, fast jag visst inte var någon dålig soldat. I alla fall jagade jag fram i min trappa. Hur många trappsteg man egentligen hade att lägga bakom sig, hade jag aldrig funderat över, inte heller vad det månde finnas för härligheter på vinden. Kanske jag dimmigt föreställde mig livets hus som ett av våra vanliga stadshus, där man steg upp ur jordens innandömen och till sist kom ut på takterrassen, i fria luften, i vind och dagsljus. Vad vinden och dagsljuset skulle motsvaras av i min livsvandring, hade jag inte klart för mig. Men säkert var, att varje ny trappavsats betecknades av korta officiella meddelanden från högre ort: om en genomgången examen, ett godkänt prov, en förflyttning till ett mera betydande verksamhetsfält. Jag hade också en hel rad sådana livsviktiga slut- och begynnelsepunkter bakom mig, dock inte så många att en ny skulle blekna i betydelse. Det var därför med ett stänk av feber i blodet jag kom tillbaka från det korta telefonsamtal, som meddelade att jag kunde vänta min kontrollchef dagen därpå och alltså fick börja experimentera med mänsklig materiel. I morgon således kom det slutliga eldprovet för min hittills största uppfinning.","By the time my story begins, I was approaching forty. By the way, if I should introduce myself, I might be able to tell you under what picture I imagined life. There are few things that say more about a person than his image of life: whether he sees it as a road, a field battle, a growing tree or a rolling sea. For my part, I saw it with the eyes of a kind schoolboy like a staircase, where you hurried from ledge to ledge as fast as you could, with panting breaths and the fellow competitor on your heels. In fact, I did not have many competitors. Most of my co-workers in the laboratory had devoted all their ambition to the military and regarded today's work as a tedious but necessary break from the evening's military service. Personally, I would hardly want to admit to any of them, how much more interested I was in my chemistry than in my military service, although I was certainly not a bad soldier. Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first. How many steps you actually had to put behind you, I had never thought about, not even what there might be for glories in the attic. Perhaps I vaguely imagined the house of life as one of our ordinary townhouses, where you stepped out of the interior of the earth and finally came out on the roof terrace, in the open air, in wind and daylight. What the wind and daylight would correspond to in my life walk, I did not know. But it was certain that each new staircase was marked by short official announcements from a higher place: about a degree passed, a passed exam, a transfer to a more significant field of activity. I also had a whole series of such vital end and beginning points behind me, though not so many that a new one would fade in meaning. It was therefore with a splash of fever in my blood that I came back from the short phone call, which announced that I could wait for my control manager the next day and thus had to start experimenting with human material. Tomorrow thus came the final test of fire for my greatest invention to date.","At the time my story begins I was approaching my forties. Perhaps if I am to introduce myself I may tell you about the image I had of life. There are few things that say more about a person than their image of life: whether they see it as a road, a battlefield, a growing tree or a rolling sea. For my part I saw it with the eyes of a well-behaved schoolboy, as a staircase up which you hurried from landing to landing as fast as you could, panting for breath and with your rival at your heels. In actual fact I had few rivals. Most of my colleagues at the laboratory had invested all their ambition in the military, and viewed their day’s work as a tedious but necessary diversion from the evening’s military duties. I would not have liked to admit to any of them how much more interested I was in my chemistry than in my military service, though I was by no means a bad soldier. At any rate, I kept on climbing my staircase at full tilt. How many stairs had to be climbed was something I had never considered, let alone what wonderful things might be in the attic. Perhaps I hazily imagined the house of life as similar to one of our ordinary city buildings, where you climbed up out of the bowels of the earth and finally emerged on the roof terrace in the open air, in wind and daylight. What the wind and the daylight would correspond to in my life’s journey I had no clear idea. But it was certain that each new landing on the staircase was marked by short official messages from higher up: about a successful exam, a passed test, a transfer to a more important field of activity. I also had a whole series of such life-altering endings and beginnings behind me, yet not so many that a new one would lose its significance beside them. It was therefore with a dash of fever in my blood that I returned from the short telephone call informing me that I might expect my control chief to arrive the following day, and so could start experimenting on human material. Thus, tomorrow the final and crucial test of my greatest discovery to date would take place.","At the time my story begins I was approaching forty. If any further introduction is necessary perhaps I might mention the way I symbolized life. Few things tell more about a person than his life-symbol: whether he sees it as a road, a great battle, a growing tree, or a billowing sea. For my part I looked at it, with the eyes of an obedient schoolboy, as a staircase on which one had to rush from level to level as fast as one could, short of breath, one's competitor at one's heels. Yet I had in reality very few competitors. Most of my colleagues at the laboratory concentrated their ambitions towards the military field and considered our daily work a boring but necessary interruption of the evening's military exercises. As for myself, I would hardly have dared admit to anyone of them how much greater was my interest in my chemistry than in my military participation, even though I was far from a poor soldier. Anyway, I was rushing ahead up my staircase. How many steps I actually had to put behind me I had never thought about, nor what kind of glory awaited me at the top. Perhaps I vaguely imagined life's house as one of our ordinary city dwellings, underground, where one emerged from the earth's bowels and at last reached the roof terrace, in open air, in wind and daylight. What wind and daylight might correspond to in my life-course was not quite clear to me. But certain it was that each new staircase level was indicated by short, official notices from higher authorities: a successful examination, a passed test, a promotion to some more important field of activity. I had already behind me many such important points of beginning and completion, though not so many that a new one would seem less important. It was therefore with a touch of exhilaration that I returned from the short telephone conversation which had advised me that I could expect my control-chief the following day, and consequently would begin to experiment with human material. Tomorrow, then, would come the final ordeal by fire for my greatest discovery up to that time."

"Min reaktion blev så häftig, att jag senare skämdes inför Linda. Men att det skulle komma just i dag, mitt i segerglädjen! Att jag mitt i mina största förhoppningar skulle träffas av ett sådant slag! Utom mig som jag var, sade jag åtskilligt som inte var väl övertänkt och som jag ännu i dag trots mitt goda minne har svårt att påminna mig, om att jag var en förlorad man, min karriär krossad, min framtid ärelös, min stora uppfinning fjäderlätt mot detta, som skulle stå på mitt hemliga kort på alla polisavdelningar i hela Världsstaten, och så vidare.

That this should arrive today of all days, in the midst of my triumph! That in the midst of my greatest hopes I should be struck by such a blow!

And when Linda tried to comfort me I thought actually at first that this was pure deceit, and that all she was thinking about was how to leave the sinking ship, even though the children still were of home-age."

"I alla fall måste jag nog ha varit trött, eftersom mitt intresse hela tiden kretsade kring de få inslag av allvar, som den muntra festen bjöd. Bara några få minuter efter det jag släppt de båda ungdomarna med blicken och de för resten blivit skilda åt av otåliga kamrater, fastnade min uppmärksamhet i stället vid en mager medelålders kvinna, förmodligen mor till någon av de utkallade flickorna. Också hon verkade på något sätt avkopplad från det stojande kollektivet. Jag vet inte riktigt hur jag uppfattade detta, bevisa det skulle jag aldrig kunnat, eftersom hon hela tiden ändå deltog, rörde sig i takt med de marscherande, nickade med de talande, ropade med de ropande. Ändå tyckte jag mig förstå, att det skedde mekaniskt, att hon inte lyftes av kollektivets befriande våg utan på något sätt stod utanför, också utanför sin egen röst och sina egna rörelser, avskild på samma sätt som de båda unga. Folk runtomkring henne måste haft samma förnimmelse, de försökte komma åt henne från olika håll. Flera gånger såg jag från min estrad, hur någon tog henne i armen och drog henne med sig eller nickade och talade med henne, men snart besviken drog sig tillbaka trots att hennes svar och leenden fungerade oklanderligt. Det var bara en liten livlig och ful man, som inte lät avskräcka sig så lätt. Då hon avfyrat sitt trötta leende mot honom och sedan återtagit sitt ännu tröttare allvar, blev han osedd stående ett stycke därifrån och iakttog henne med tydlig fundersamhet.","In any case, I must have been tired, because my interest constantly revolved around the few elements of seriousness that the cheerful party offered. Just a few minutes after I let go of the two young people with their eyes and they had been separated by impatient comrades, my attention instead turned to a skinny middle-aged woman, probably the mother of one of the called girls. She, too, seemed somehow relaxed from the noisy collective. I do not really know how I perceived this, I would never have been able to prove it, because she kept participating all the time, moving in time with the marchers, nodding with the speakers, shouting with the shouters. Yet I seemed to understand that it happened mechanically, that she was not lifted by the liberating wave of the collective but in some way stood outside, also outside her own voice and her own movements, separated in the same way as the two young people. People around her must have had the same feeling, they tried to approach her from different directions. Several times I saw from my stage how someone took her by the arm and pulled her with him or nodded and talked to her, but soon disappointed, withdrew even though her answers and smiles worked impeccably. It was just a small lively and ugly man, who did not let himself be discouraged so easily. When she fired her tired smile at him and then regained her even more tired seriousness, he was left standing a short distance away and watched her with clear thought.","At any rate I must have been tired, as my interest kept circling around the few elements of seriousness offered by the merry celebration. Only a few minutes after I had taken my eyes off the two young people, who as it happened had become separated by impatient comrades, my attention fastened instead on a thin, middle-aged woman, probably the mother of one of the conscripted girls. She too seemed in some way disconnected from the bustling collectivity. I don’t really know how I realized this, for I should never have been able to prove it, as she continued to take part in the event, moving in time to the marchers, nodding along with the speakers, shouting with the shouters. But I somehow had a sense that she did this mechanically, that instead of being raised up by the liberating wave of the collective, in some way she stood outside it, even outside her own voice and her own movements, just as isolated as the two young people were. Those around her must have had the same feeling, for they attempted to approach her from different directions. Several times from my platform I saw someone take her by the arm and pull her along with them or stop and talk with her, but soon, disappointed, withdraw, even though her answers and smiles functioned impeccably. There was only one lively, ugly little man who would not let himself be frightened away so easily. When she fired off her weary smile at him and then resumed her even wearier solemnity, he remained standing unseen some distance away, watching her in obvious reflection.","Indeed, I must have been tired since my interest all the time centered about the few expressions of seriousness which the gay festival offered. Only a few minutes after I had lost sight of the young couple, who were separated by impatient comrades, my attention was drawn to a thin, middle-aged woman, probably a mother of one of the girls to be transferred. She too seemed in some way dissociated from the jostling collectivity. I don't really know how I comprehended this —I would never have been able to prove it—since she participated all the while, moving in step with the marchers, nodding with the speakers, shouting with the shouters. But it seemed to me this happened mechanically, that she was not moved with the collectivity's liberating wave but in some way stood outside, even outside her own voice and motions, apart in the same way as the two lovers. People around her must have had the same feeling; they tried to get at her from various directions. Several times I could see, from my elevated position, how someone pulled her by the arm, or nodded and spoke to her, but soon withdrew in disappointment, even though her replies and smiles seemed to function faultlessly. Only one ugly, animated little man refused to give up so easily. After she had displayed her tired smiles to him and resumed her still more tired seriousness, he remained, unseen by her, still watching her with definite interest."
Inte heller honom hörde Karrek. Han hade återtagit sin vandring med långa steg och med sitt egendomliga mongoliska huvud med de hopknipna ögonen framåtsträckt.,Karrek did not hear him either.

He had resumed his pacing with long strides; his peculiar Mongolian head, with its half-closed eyes, stretched forwards.","Karrek, however, did not listen to him either; he had [p. 103] resumed his pacing back and forth with long strides, his strange, Mongolian head, with the narrow eyes, bent forward."
"Bland våra undersökningspersoner hade vi hela tiden haft samma äldre man av dårsekten, som jag redan tidigare talat om och som kommit in redan före vår resa till huvudstaden. Av en tillfällighet hade hans fall blivit uppskjutet – han hade sjuknat och inte blivit frisk förrän nu – och stod på dagordningen just för i morgon, då jag alltså skulle börja min nya kemistkurs. Det förvånade och nästan skrämde mig själv, att jag var så besviken över att inte få vara med vid det förhöret. Jag måste fråga mig, om jag väntade något i stil med den där kvinnan, som gjorde så djupt intryck på mig – om jag drogs till att på nytt utsätta mig för liknande farliga inflytelser. Men jag behövde väl egentligen inte genast ta till nedsättande bevekelsegrunder. Mitt intresse gällde säkert först och främst hela härvan, som Karrek givit oss order att nysta upp – jag ville veta, vad det var för en kärna som gömde sig bakom alla vansinnigheterna. Mannens intelligenta utseende tydde på att han kunde vara djupare insatt i juntans innersta hemligheter än någon vi förut träffat på. Jag skulle gärna velat vara med vid det avslöjandet, helst som jag misstänkte Rissen för skumma sympatier. Det finns sannerligen också ett negativt intresse, sade jag mig, som inte har ett spår att skaffa med ett positivt. Sådant är mitt intresse för dårsekten, alldeles som mitt intresse för Rissen.","Among our investigators, we had always had the same older man of the foolish sect, whom I have already talked about before and who came in even before our trip to the capital. Coincidentally, his case had been postponed - he had fallen ill and not recovered until now - and was on the agenda just for tomorrow, when I would start my new chemistry course. It surprised and almost scared me that I was so disappointed not to be present at that interrogation. I have to ask myself, if I was expecting anything in the style of that woman, who made such a deep impression on me - if I was drawn to re-expose myself to similar dangerous influences. But I did not really need to immediately resort to derogatory motives. My interest probably concerned first and foremost the whole tangle, which Karrek gave us orders to unravel - I wanted to know what kind of core was behind all the madness. The man's intelligent appearance indicated that he could be more deeply acquainted with the junta's innermost secrets than anyone we had met before. I would have liked to be part of that revelation, preferably as I suspected Rissen of shady sympathies. There is certainly also a negative interest, I said to myself, which has no clue to acquire with a positive one. Such is my interest in the foolish sect, just like my interest in Rissen.","Among our test subjects we had always had the same ageing man from the sect of fools whom I mentioned earlier and who had come in before our trip to the capital. By chance, his case had been postponed – he had fallen ill and not recovered until now – and he was on the schedule for tomorrow, the very day I was to begin my new chemistry course. It surprised and almost frightened me that I was so disappointed not to be able to attend that interrogation. I could not help wondering if I was expecting something in the style of that woman who had made such a deep impression on me – if I was being drawn to expose myself to similar dangerous influences again. But I did not really need immediately to look for derogatory motives. My interest lay first and foremost with the whole of the tangle that Karrek had ordered us to unravel – I wanted to know what the nucleus was that lay concealed behind all the craziness. The man’s intelligent appearance indicated that he might be more deeply cognizant with the junta’s innermost secrets than anyone we had encountered so far. Interest may also be of a negative kind, I told myself, one that has nothing positive about it. Such was my interest in the sect of fools, just like my interest in Rissen.","On our list of persons to be examined we had still the old man from the lunatic sect whom I spoke about earlier and whom we had been ready to examine before our journey to the Capital. As it happened, his case had been delayed; he had become ill and had only just recovered. His name was on the list for tomorrow, just when I was to start my new chemistry course. It surprised me, almost frightened me, that I was so disappointed at not being able to be present at that examination. I had to ask myself if I was expecting something similar to that woman who had made such a deep impression on me; was I attracted by a new exposure to similar dangerous influences? But why need I resort to degrading reasons; my interest was surely first and foremost the whole sorry mess, which Karrek had ordered us to wind up—I wanted to know what was the kernel of truth behind all those insanities. The man's intelligent appearance had led me to believe he might be more initiated into the gang's deepest secrets than anyone we had interrogated earlier. I was anxious to be present at that unmasking, especially as I suspected Rissen of shady sympathies. There was indeed also a negative interest, I told myself, which had nothing whatsoever to do with positive interest: was my interest in the lunatic sect identical with my interest in Rissen?"

"– För vems skydd, säger ni? angrep Karrek. Inte för Statens i alla fall.

The state has more benefit from clear heads, which if necessary can spit on the printing ink ...","‘For whose protection, did you say?’ Karrek parried. ‘Not the State’s, at least.

Det tog. Hans förvirring fick en ny ton av skrämsel. Hjälplöst vände han sina stela ögon från sin hustru till mig och tillbaka igen. Efter en liten paus återtog jag:,"It took.

His confusion acquired a new tone of fright. Helplessly he transferred his fixed gaze from his wife and back to me again. After a short pause I resumed:,"This had effect.

"– Hur ska jag beskriva det jag sedan fick vara med om? Du vet, Maryl är ett underligt barn. Hon var varken du eller jag. Det är möjligt, att några farföräldrar eller morföräldrar har dykt upp i hennes väsen – men jag visste det inte, och det låg så långt tillbaka. Hon var helt enkelt Maryl. Det låter så enkelt, men det var så underligt. Hon måste ha sett saker och ting på ett eget sätt redan då, redan innan hon kunde tala. Och sedan – ja, du vet. Du vet, att hon är något för sig.","- How should I describe what I then got to be a part of? You know, Maryl is a weird kid. She was neither you nor me. It is possible that some grandparents or grandparents have appeared in her being - but I did not know, and it was so far back. She was simply Maryl. It sounds so simple, but it was so weird.

"Även om inte hennes ålder varit obestämd och hennes hållning stel som hos en forntida gudabild, skulle jag nog i min feberstämning ha uppfattat henne bara som halvt mänsklig. Inte ens en stor finne, som slagit ut på vänstra sidan om hennes näsa och tydligen just höll på att nå sin fulla mognad, kunde dra ner henne till jorden i mina ögon. Fungerade hon inte som Världsstatens högsta etiska instans, eller åtminstone som den ledande kraften i Världsstatens högsta etiska instans, vilken var Propagandaministeriets sjunde byrå! I hennes ansikte kunde man inte läsa några personliga affekter som hos Tuareg, hennes orörlighet innehöll inga dolda språng som hos Karrek, mig föreföll hon vara den kristallslipade logiken själv, rentvättad från individualitetens alla tillfälligheter. Det var en feberfantasi, men i hela sin överspänning fångade den ändå Lavris’ bild ganska träffande, misstänker jag.","Even if her age had not been indeterminate and her attitude rigid as in an ancient image of a god, I would probably in my feverish mood have perceived her only as half human. Not even a large pimple, which had erupted on the left side of her nose and was apparently just reaching its full maturity, could pull her down to the ground in my eyes. Did she not function as the highest ethical body of the World State, or at least as the leading force in the highest ethical body of the World State, which was the seventh agency of the Ministry of Propaganda! In her face one could not read any personal affects as in Tuareg, her immobility contained no hidden leaps as in Karrek, to me she seemed to be the crystal-cut logic itself, cleansed from all the coincidences of individuality. It was a feverish fantasy, but in all its surge, it still captured Lavris' image quite aptly, I suspect.","Even though her age was indeterminate and her posture stiff as an antique effigy, in my feverish state of mind I would probably have seen her as only half human.

Did she not function as the World State’s highest ethical authority, or at least as the leading light in the World State’s highest ethical authority, which was the Ministry of Propaganda’s Seventh Bureau? In her face one could read no personal emotions as one could in Tuareg’s , her immobility contained no hidden leaps as in Karrek’s; to me she seemed to be crystal-cut logic itself, washed free of all the quirks of individuality.

My thoughts dwelt mechanically on a few everyday questions: who would now teach Rissen ’s course, probably one of the more advanced students, who would teach my course if I had to take over Rissen’s, yes, there were so many people to choose from, though actually we could not afford to do without a single one of them, soon this course would be finally over, so then we could begin another … It was the rattling of a mill grinding emptiness. I myself was somewhere where it was still and dark.","When I later turned about, the young man had disappeared. Since he was one of the participants in the course there would be no trouble in locating him. My thoughts mechanically kneaded a few commonplace questions: who will be the instructor of Rissen's course now? Probably one of the farthest advanced students? Who will lead my course in case I am assigned to Rissen's? Well, there are plenty of people, but actually we haven't been able to spare a single one ; soon the course will finally be over, then we'll have to start a new one . . . It was the clatter of a mill grinding upon emptiness. I myself was in some place where it was quiet and dark."

"Jag minns inte längre vad det var för ett föredrag som sprutade ut över oss, jag var för upptagen av min inre oro för att märka det. Linda visade inte med en min vad hon tänkte vare sig om föredraget eller om min iver att få henne placerad just i den stolen – antagligen förstod hon vad som var på färde och lyssnade lika lite som jag. Först då jag flyttade min stol alldeles intill hennes, såg hon frågande på mig.","I no longer remember what a lecture it was that sprayed over us, I was too preoccupied with my inner anxiety to notice it.

Only when I moved my chair right next to hers did she look at me questioningly.","I no longer remember the subject of the radio talk that blasted out at us, as I was too absorbed in my inner commotion to notice.

"– Ni tar det nog för hårt, sade Karrek. Min erfarenhet har lärt mig, att ju abstraktare någonting är, dess mindre farliga verkningar har det.

"Men det var vi som först fick företräde. En liten snabb och smidig tjänsteman öppnade dörren, gick fram till Karrek och viskade med honom. Karrek visade på oss båda, och vi fördes alla tre in i ett nytt väntrum, där vi återigen kroppsvisiterades. Överhuvudtaget var det mycket grundligare sörjt för säkerheten här än hemma i vår kemistad, naturligtvis därför att de liv som här skulle bevaras var så mycket sällsyntare och dyrbarare än några i övriga delar av Världsstaten. Redan ute i väntrummet, så mycket mera då här i förrummet och inne hos polispresidenten själv, posterade vakter med lyfta pistoler. Så äntligen stod vi inför den mäktige.","But it was we who were given priority first. A small, quick and agile official opened the door, approached Karrek, and whispered to him. Karrek showed us both, and all three of us were taken to a new waiting room, where we were again body searched. In general, security was much more thoroughly ensured here than at home in our chemistry city, of course because the lives that were to be preserved here were so much rarer and more expensive than some in other parts of the World State. Already out in the waiting room, so much more then here in the anteroom and inside the police president himself, guards were stationed with raised pistols. So finally we stood before the mighty one.","But as it turned out, we were first in line. An agile little official opened the door, went over to Karrek and whispered to him. Karrek pointed to us, and all three of us were led into another waiting room, where we were body-searched again. In general the security here was much more thorough than back home in our chemistry city, for the obvious reason that the lives that had to be protected here were much more rare and valuable than in any other part of the World State. Even out in the waiting room, and much more so here in the antechamber and in the police president’s office itself, there were guards with raised pistols. But at last we stood before the powerful man.","But we were the first ones to be admitted. A small and agile official opened the door, walked straight up to Karrek, and whispered something in his ear. Karrek pointed to us two, and then all three of us were ushered into another waiting room, where again we were searched [p. 97] from head to foot. Generally speaking the security measures were far more thorough here than at home in our Chemistry City, naturally because the lives to be preserved here were so much more valuable than in other parts of the Worldstate.

"– Varför inte? Varför inte alla? Jag vet, att det är en framtidsdröm, men ändå! Jag förutser en tid, då alla tillsättningar av poster föregås av en kallocainprövning, lika självklart som de nu föregås av de vanliga psykotekniska proven.

"Det var tjänstgöringskväll, och vi kom sent i säng.","It was service night, and we got to bed late.","There was military duty that evening, and we did not get to bed until late.","We had evening duty, and it was late before we got to bed."
"Samma kväll for vi till polishuset, vederbörligen försedda med ett intyg om vårt ärende från högste chefen för vårt laboratoriekvarter samt med besökslicens från polishuset, skickad med ilbud. Jag hade med knapp nöd fått byta ut min militär- och polistjänstgöringskväll mot senare dubbel tjänstgöring. Vi var emellertid glada att få komma i beröring med polischefen; vi behövde hans hjälp i vad vi nu hade för oss. I alla fall blev det ett ganska drygt arbete att övertyga honom, inte därför att han i allmänhet hade svårt för att fatta, tvärtom, men därför att han var på dåligt humör och tydligen hyste principiell misstro mot vem som helst. Jag måste bekänna, att hans misstro gjorde ett bättre intryck på mig än Rissens lättrogenhet. Även om den händelsevis gick ut över mig, så var den i sin ordning, och då vi äntligen fått honom över på vår sida, hade åtminstone jag den känslan, att jag hade öppnat en mycket säker dörr med den rätta och lovliga nyckeln, inte med en dyrk och inte med en spark. – Saken var ju den, att vi måste få hand om makarnas personer, sedan de fått sina makars, våra försökspersoners förtroenden. De kunde gärna anmälas i laglig ordning, som medskyldiga i stämplingar, och häktas efter alla konstens regler, bara de sedan på något sätt forslades till oss. Om han ville inviga sina polismän eller föredrog att ensam veta vad det gällde, det var hans ensak. Det enda viktiga var att de häktade makarna skulle kallocainundersökas av oss. Om han ville, kunde han ju själv kontrollera, att de häktade inte led någon skada hos oss och alltså inget folkmaterial förstördes i onödan – ville han komma i egen person eller skicka något ombud, så gick det lika bra och vi skulle känna oss smickrade. Jag tror för resten, att det var det där ”i egen person” som stämde honom mildare. Trots sitt dåliga humör var han nyfiken på hur min uppfinning kunde fungera. Då vi äntligen fått hans skriftliga bekräftelse på det föregående löftet i telefon, med namnteckningen, Vay Karrek, i hög, spetsig men kraftig stil under, förberedde vi honom på att några av de intet anande makarna kunde ta sitt parti och ange den fingerade brottslingen. Eftersom alltsammans var lek borde det naturligtvis inte leda till någon häktning – vi lämnade honom listan med försökspersonernas namn – däremot skulle vi som sagt vara tacksamma om makarna häktades så tidigt som möjligt i morgon förmiddag.","That same evening we went to the police station, duly provided with a certificate of our case from the top manager of our laboratory district and with a visitor's license from the police station, sent with an offer. I had hardly had to replace my military and police service evening with later double service. However, we were happy to get in touch with the police chief; we needed his help in what we now had in mind. In any case, it became quite a chore to convince him, not because he generally had a hard time grasping, on the contrary, but because he was in a bad mood and apparently harbored distrust of anyone in principle. I must confess that his distrust made a better impression on me than Rissen's gullibility. Even if it happened to happen to me, it was all right, and when we finally got him over to our side, at least I had the feeling that I had opened a very safe door with the right and legal key, not with a worship and not with a kick. - The thing was that we have to take care of the spouses' people, after they have received the trust of their spouses, our subjects. They could easily be reported in legal order, as accomplices in stamping, and detained according to all the rules of art, as long as they were then somehow transported to us. If he wanted to inaugurate his police officers or preferred to know what was going on alone, it was up to him. The only important thing was that the detained spouses should be examined by us for callocaine. If he wanted, he could check for himself, that the detainees did not suffer any damage from us and thus no folk material was destroyed unnecessarily - he wanted to come in person or send a representative, so it went just as well and we would feel flattered. By the way, I think it was that ""in person"" that suited him more mildly. Despite his bad mood, he was curious about how my invention could work. When we finally received his written confirmation of the previous promise by telephone, with the signature, Vay Karrek, in a high, pointed but powerful style underneath, we prepared him for some of the unsuspecting spouses to take their side and identify the fictitious criminal. Since everything was play, of course, it should not lead to any arrest - we left him the list with the names of the subjects - however, as I said, we would be grateful if the spouses were arrested as early as possible tomorrow morning.","That same evening we went to police headquarters, duly equipped with a certificate from the most senior official in our laboratory district, and a visitors’ permit from police headquarters sent by express courier. I had narrowly succeeded in exchanging my evening of military and police duty for a double spell of duty later on. We were, however, glad to make contact with the chief of police; we needed his help in what we now planned to do. In fact it was a rather onerous task to convince him, not because he had any general difficulty in understanding, but because he was in a bad mood, and clearly viewed everyone with distrust on principle. I must confess that his distrust made a better impression on me than Rissen’s credulousness. Even though it happened to be at my expense, it was perfectly normal, and when we finally got him over to our side I at least had the feeling that I had opened a very secure door with the right and lawful key, not with a jemmy and not with a kick. The important thing was that we had to get hold of the male or female partners of the people who were our test subjects, since they had gained the confidence of their partners. They could of course be denounced in the legal manner, as accessories to conspiracy, and be arrested in accordance with all the tricks of the trade, as long as they were then delivered to us in some way. If the chief of police wanted to let his men know the details of the case or preferred to keep the knowledge to himself, that was his private concern. All that mattered was that the arrested partners should be Kallocain-tested by us. If he wished, he could check for himself that these remand prisoners came to no harm in our care, and thus that no human material was needlessly destroyed – if he wanted to come in person or send a representative, that was equally acceptable and we would feel flattered. In point of fact, I think it was this mention of ‘in person’ that improved his mood. Despite his ill humour, he was curious to see how my discovery might work. When we finally received the written confirmation of his earlier telephoned promise, with the signature ‘Vay Karrek’ in tall, pointed but vigorous handwriting at the bottom, we prepared him for the risk that some of the unsuspecting partners might make up their minds to denounce the pretended criminals. Of course, since the whole thing was a game it ought not to lead to any legal proceedings – we handed him the list of the test subjects’ names – but we would naturally be grateful if the partners were arrested as early as possible the following morning.","The same evening we called on the chief of police, duly provided with a certification from the top chief of our laboratory-complex concerning our visit, as well as a visiting license from the police department, sent us by [p. 54] special messenger. I had managed, with great difficulty, to exchange my evening's military duty for double duty some later evening. We were quite pleased to have this opportunity to meet the chief of police in person; we needed his help in our present activities. But it turned out to be a difficult task to convince him—not because he was particularly dense, rather the contrary, but because he was in a bad temper, and apparently was suspicious of everyone on principle. I must admit that his suspicion appealed to me more than Rissen's gullibility. Even though, as it happened, he was harder on me, I felt it was as it should be; when finally we had him on our side I at least had the feeling that I had opened a very well secured door with the right and lawful key, not with a crowbar or a kick. We told him that we needed to get hold of the people in whom our test-persons had confided—that is, their spouses. For all we cared, they could be reported in the regular legal way, as accessories to conspiracies, and taken into custody in accordance with all the rules, as long as they later were turned over to us. If the chief of police wished to let his subordinates in on the secret, or if he preferred to keep the matter to himself, well, that was his business. The only important thing was that persons arrested (non-reporting spouses) must be Kallocain-tested by us. If he wished to check, he could see for himself that the people arrested would suffer no damage from us, and consequently no human material would be destroyed uselessly; he might come in person, or send a representative, we would feel equally complimented either way. Actually, I think it was ""come in person"" that made him more understanding; in spite of his bad temper he was curious about how my discovery would work. When at last we had obtained written confirmation of his earlier promise over the telephone, with his signature, Vay Karrek, in tall, pointed but strong letters under it, we [p. 55] prepared him for the fact that some of the unsuspecting spouses might be honest enough to report the pretended criminals. Since the whole matter was only an experiment it must of course not lead to prosecution; we handed him a list with the names of the test-persons; we would be most grateful if these people's spouses were apprehended as early as possible on the morrow."
