"På sjöns andra strand ligger kyrkogården, Svartsjö sockens ovårdade kyrkogård, glest besatt med sneda, rasslande järnkors, tuvig som en aldrig plöjd ing, beväxt av starr och randigt människogräs, som har blivit ditsått för att påminna därom, att ingen människas liv är den andras likt, utan skiftar som gräsets blad. Där finnas inga grusade gångar, inga skuggande träd utom den stora linden på en gammal komministers glömda grav. Stengärdesgården sluter sig, tvär och hög, kring det arma fältet. Arm och tröstlös är kyrkogården, ful som en girigbuks ansikte, vissnat vid deras verop, vilkas lycka han har stulit. Och dock äro de saliga, som vila därinne, de, som ha sänkts i vigd jord under psalmljud och böner. Acquilon, spelaren, han, som förra året dog på Ekeby, har måst begravas utanför muren. Denne man, som en gång var så stolt och så ridderlig, den tappre krigaren, den dristige jägaren, spelaren, som höll lyckan fången, han hade slutat med att förstöra sina barns arvedel, allt, vad han själv hade förvärvat, allt, vad hans hustru hade vårdat. Hustru och barn hade han övergivit för många år sedan för att föra en kavaljers liv på Ekeby. En kväll förra sommaren hade han spelat bort gården, som gav dem deras bärgning. Hellre än att infria sin skuld hade han skjutit sig.

There are no gravel passages, no shady trees except the large linden tree of an old commissioner's forgotten grave. Stengärdesgården closes, across and high, around the poor field. Poor and inconsolable is the cemetery, ugly as the face of a greedy belly, withered at their verop, whose happiness he has stolen. And yet the blessed are those who rest in it, those who have been immersed in consecrated ground under the sound of psalms and prayers. Acquilon, the player, he, who died last year at Ekeby, has had to be buried outside the wall. This man, who was once so proud and so chivalrous, the brave warrior, the daring hunter, the player, who held captive happiness, he had ceased to destroy the inheritance of his children, all that he himself had acquired, all that his wife had cared. He had abandoned his wife and children many years ago to lead the life of a cavalier at Ekeby. One night last summer, he had lost the farm, which gave them their salvage. Rather than repay his guilt, he had shot himself.

There are no gravel walks there, no shading trees except the big linden on the forgotten grave of some old priest. A stone wall, rough and high, encloses the miserable field. Miserable and desolate is the churchyard, ugly as the face of a miser, which has withered at the laments of those whose happiness he has stolen.

Wife and children he had forsaken many years before, to lead the life of a pensioner at Ekeby. One evening in the past summer he had played away the farm which gave them their means of subsistence. Rather than to pay his debt he had shot himself.

"Då allt var slut, såg man den elake stiga ut på branten av den kulle, där Bro kyrka ligger. Han såg ned på Broby sund och följde det med blicken förbi prostgården och västra strandens trenne uddar ut i Löven. Och man såg hur han knöt näven och skakade den över sundet och dess grönskande stränder. Därpå gledo hans blickar söderut över nedre Löven ända till de blånande uddar, som tyckas stänga sjön. Och norrut flögo de milslångt förbi Gurlita klätt upp till Björnidet, där sjön slutar. Han såg mot väster och öster, där de långa bergen kanta dalen, och han knöt näven omigen. Och envar kände, att om han hade haft en knippa blixtar i sin högra hand, skulle han i vild glädje ha slungat dem ut över det lugna landet och spritt jämmer och död, så långt han hade mäktat. Ty nu hade han så vant sitt hjärta vid det onda, att han visste sig ingen fröjd annat än i elände. Småningom hade han lärt sig själv att älska allt fult och uselt. Han var mer vansinnig än den vildaste galning, men detta förstod ingen.","When it was all over, you saw the wicked rising out on the slope of the hill, where Bro church is located. He looked down at Broby Sound and followed it with his eyes past the rectory and the west shore's three headlands out into Löven. And you saw how he clenched his fist and shook it across the strait and its lush beaches. Then his eyes slid south over lower Löven all the way to the blue headlands, which seem to close the lake. And to the north they flew miles past Gurlita dressed up to Björnidet, where the lake ends. He looked west and east, where the long mountains bordered the valley, and he clenched his fist again. And every one felt that if he had had a bunch of lightnings in his right hand, he would in wild joy have thrown them out over the calm land and spread grief and death, as far as he had been able. For now he had become so accustomed to evil in his heart, that he knew no joy but in misery. Eventually he had taught himself to love everything ugly and lousy. He was more insane than the wildest maniac, but no one understood this.","When it was over, they saw him walk out on to the slope of the hill where the Bro church stands. He looked down on the Broby Sound and followed it with his eyes past the deanery and the three points of the west shore out into the Löfven. And they saw how he clenched his fist and shook it over the sound and its green banks. Then his glance turned further south over the lower Löfven to the misty shores which seemed to shut in the lake, and northward it flew miles beyond Gurlitta Cliff up to Björnidet, where the lake began. He looked to the west and east, where the long mountains border the valley, and he clenched his fist again. And every one felt that if he had held a bundle of thunderbolts in his right hand, he would have hurled them in wild joy out over the peaceful country and spread sorrow and death as far as he could. For now he had so accustomed his heart to evil that he knew no pleasure except in suffering. By degrees he had taught himself to love everything ugly and wretched. He was more insane than the most violent madman, but that no one understood.","When everything was done, the malevolent man was seen climbing out on the edge of the hill where Bro church sits. He looked down on Broby Sound and followed with his gaze past the parsonage and the triple promontories on the left bank out to Löven. And it was seen how he clenched his fist and shook it over the sound and its verdant shores. Then his gaze swept southward over lower Löven all the way to the blue-tinged promontories that seemed to close off the lake. And northward his gaze flew for miles past Gurlita Bluff up to Björnidet, where the lake ends. He looked west and east, where the long hills edge the lake, and he clenched his fist again. And everyone felt that if he had a bundle of lightning bolts in his hand he would have hurled them in wild delight out over the calm countryside and spread misery and death as far as he was able. For now he had so accustomed his heart to evil that he knew no joy other than in misery. Little by little he had learned to love everything ugly and base. He was crazier than the wildest lunatic, but no one realized this."

"Det sägs, att då Gösta slöt förstudörren efter sig, såg han några slädar köra upp till Borg. Han kastade en blick på den lilla damen, som satt i främsta släden. Dyster, som stunden var för honom, blev den än dystrare vid den synen. Han skyndade bort för att inte bli igenkänd, men aningar om ofärd fyllde hans sinne. Hade samtalet därinne frambesvurit denna kvinna? Städse föder en olycka en annan.","It is said that when Gösta closed the front door behind him, he saw some sledges driving up to Borg. He glanced at the little lady, who was sitting in the front sleigh. Gloomy, as the moment was for him, it became even gloomier at that sight.

One accident always breeds another.","It is said that when Gösta shut the hall-door after him he saw several sledges driving up to Borg.

"Men så småningom börjar man förstå vad detta är för en björn och varför inte Gösta har kunnat skjuta på honom. Hemskt att säga, förfärligt att tro, men detta är inte någon vanlig björn. Ingen kan tänka på att fälla honom, såvida han inte har en silverkula i bössan.

"Men du förstår, att hans synd bestod däri, att han glömde både forntid och framtid.

"De hade haft höstbak på Ekeby just de dagarna. Sedan den unga grevinnan Elisabet har kommit dit, hade det åter blivit fart i de inre göromålen.

"Det vet nog envar, att livet gärna anordnar sådana sammanträffanden som det, vilket nu följde. Den, som ännu kan förvånas, må väl förundra sig över att kavaljererna skulle ligga med sina pråmar vid färjstället över Klarälven just morgonen, som följde efter den natt, då grevinnan Elisabet hade begivit sig österut på vandring. Men helt visst skulle det ha varit mer underligt, om inte den unga kvinnan hade funnit någon hjälp i sin nöd. Det hände nu så, att hon, som hade gått hela natten, kom fram på landsvägen, som gick ned till färjan, just som kavaljererna ämnade lägga ut, och de blevo stående och sågo på henne, medan hon talade med färjkarlen och han lossade båten. Hon var klädd som en bondpiga, och de anade inte vem hon var. Men de stodo ändå och stirrade på henne, därför att det var något bekant hos henne. Medan hon nu stod där och talade med färjkarlen, syntes ett dammoln på landsvägen, och ur dammolnet skymtade fram en stor, gul kalesch. Hon förstod, att den var från Borg, att man var ute och sökte henne, och att hon nu skulle bli upptäckt. Hon kunde inte längre tänka på att komma undan i färjkarlens båt, och det enda gömställe hon såg var kavaljerernas pråmar. Hon störtade bort mot dem utan att se vad det var för folk ombord. Och väl var, att hon inte såg det, ty annars hade hon väl hellre kastat sig under hästarnas fötter än tagit sin tillflykt dit. När hon hade kommit ombord, skrek hon bara: »Göm mig, göm mig!» Och så snavade hon och föll omkull på järnlasten. Men kavaljererna bådo henne vara lugn. De stötte hastigt från land, så att pråmen kom ut i strömfåran och drev ned mot Karlstad, just då kaleschen kom fram till färjstället.","Everyone probably knows that life is happy to organize such events as the one that followed. Anyone who can still be surprised may well be surprised that the cavaliers would lie with their barges at the ferry crossing over the Klarälven just in the morning, which followed the night when Countess Elisabet had gone east on a hike. But surely it would have been more strange if the young woman had not found any help in her need. It so happened that she, who had been walking all night, came on the country road, which went down to the ferry, just as the cavaliers intended to lay out, and they stood and looked at her, while she talked to the ferryman and he unloaded the boat. . She was dressed like a peasant girl, and they had no idea who she was. But they still stood and stared at her, because there was something familiar about her. While she was now standing there talking to the ferryman, a cloud of dust appeared on the country road, and from the dust cloud a large, yellow canopy appeared. She understood that it was from Borg, that they were out looking for her, and that she would now be discovered. She could no longer think of getting away in the ferryman's boat, and the only hiding place she saw was the cavalry's barges. She rushed towards them without seeing what kind of people were on board. And it was well that she did not see it, for otherwise she would rather have thrown herself under the horses' feet than taken refuge there. When she got on board, she just shouted, ""Hide me, hide me!"" And then she stumbled and fell on the iron load. But the cavaliers begged her to be calm. They rushed ashore quickly, so that the barge came out into the current channel and drifted down towards Karlstad, just as the kaleschen arrived at the ferry terminal.","He who still can be surprised may wonder that the pensioners should be lying with their barges at the ferry over the Klar River just on the morning after when Countess Elizabeth had started on her wanderings towards the east.

It now happened that she, who had walked the whole night, was coming along the highway which led down to the ferry, just as the pensioners intended to push off, and they stood and looked at her while she talked to the ferryman and he untied his boat.

She could no longer hope to escape in the ferryman’s boat, and the only hiding-place she saw was the pensioners’ barges. She rushed down to them without seeing who it was on board.

When she came on board she only screamed, “Hide me, hide me!” And then she tripped and fell on the pile of iron. But the pensioners bade her be calm. They pushed off hurriedly from the land, so that the barge came out into the current and bore down towards Karlstad, just as the coach reached the ferry.","Each of them knows well enough that life gladly arranges such coincidences as the one that now ensued.

"Nu sågo kavaljererna henne med förfäran och kände inte rätt igen henne. Hon var härjad och avmagrad, halsen var utan rundning, ansiktet genomskinligt. Hon hade väl slagit sig under nattens vandring, ty ur ett litet sår vid tinningen kom då och då en bloddroppe framsipprande, och det krusiga, ljusa håret, som hängde ned i pannan, hade blivit klibbigt av blodet. Hennes klänning var smutsig efter den långa vandringen på av dagg fuktiga vägar, och hennes skor voro illa tilltygade. Kavaljererna förnummo en hemsk känsla av att detta var en främmande. Den grevinna Elisabet de hade känt hade inte haft sådana vilda, glödande ögon. Deras stackars syster hade nära nog blivit jagad till vansinne.

Her dress was dirty after the long walk on dewy roads, and her shoes were ill-fitted. The cavaliers sensed a terrible feeling that this was a stranger. The Countess Elizabeth they had known had not had such wild, glowing eyes. Their poor sister had almost been driven mad.

"Den bistre majoren, Anders Fuchs, var ingen fager man. Han hade en tung, klumpig kropp och ett brett, rött ansikte med hängande påsar under kinderna och mångdubbel haka. Styva som borst sutto de små svarta mustascherna ovanför hans tjocka läppar, och det svarta håret stod strävt och tätt rätt ut från huvudet. Därtill var han en fåordig man och en storätare. Han var inte en sådan, som kvinnor möta med soliga leenden och öppna armar, inte heller gav han dem blida blickar tillbaka. Man trodde inte, att han någonsin skulle få se en kvinna, som han kunde ha fördrag med, och allt, som hörde till kärlek och svärmeri, var fjärran ifrån honom.","The bitter major, Anders Fuchs, was not a handsome man. He had a heavy, clumsy body and a wide, red face with hanging bags under his cheeks and a multiple chin.

He was not one that women meet with sunny smiles and open arms, nor did he give them gentle looks back. It was not thought that he would ever see a woman with whom he could have a treaty, and everything that belonged to love and swarming was far from him.","The grim Major Anders Fuchs was not handsome.

"Det var så tidigt, att ingen människa ännu var vaken. Lilliecrona satte sig på det gröna gungbrädet utanför manbyggnaden och såg på sin egendom. Herre Gud! Vackrare ställe fanns inte. Gräsplanen framför huset låg i en sakta sluttning och var täckt av fint, ljusgrönt gräs. Det fanns inte make till gräsplan. Fåren fingo beta på den och barnen rasa där med sina lekar, men den höll sig ändå alltid lika tät och grön. Lien gick aldrig över den, men minst en gång i veckan lät husmodern sopa bort alla stickor och strån och torra blad ur det friska gräset. Han såg på sandgången framför huset och drog plötsligen åt sig fötterna. Barnen hade sent på kvällen krattat den i riktiga mönster, och hans stora fötter hade gjort förfärlig skada på det fina arbetet. Tänk ändå, hur allt växte på detta ställe! De sex rönnarna, som bevakade gårdsplanen, voro höga som bokar och vida som ekar. Sådana träd hade man väl aldrig sett förr. Granna voro de med de tjocka stammarna klädda av gula lavar och med stora, vita blomklasar stickande fram ur den mörka grönskan. Han måste tänka på himmelen och dess stjärnor. Man kunde nog förundra sig över hur träden växte där på gården. Där stod en gammal pil, så tjock, att två karlar inte kunde famna om den. Den var nu murken och ihålig, och åskan hade tagit toppen av den, men dö ville den inte. Varje vår kom en knippa friskt grönt upp ur den avbrutna huvudstammen för att visa, att den levde. Den där häggen vid östra gaveln hade blivit ett träd så stort, att det överskyggade hela huset. Hela torvtaket var vitt av dess fällda blomblad, ty häggen hade redan blommat ut. Och björkarna, som stodo i små klungor här och där på åkrarna, de hade helt visst sitt paradis på hans gård. Där utvecklade de så många olika växtsätt, som om de hade slagit sig på att härma alla andra träd. En var lik en lind, tät och lummig med ett vitt valv över sig, en annan stod jämn och pyramidlik som en poppel, och en tredje hängde grenarna som en tårpil. Inte en var lik den andra, och härliga voro de allesamman.","It was so early that no one was awake yet. Lilliecrona sat down on the green seesaw outside the man building and looked at her property. Oh my God! There was no more beautiful place. The lawn in front of the house was on a slow slope and was covered with fine, light green grass. There was no husband for the lawn. The sheep grazed on it and the children crashed there with their toys, but it still remained just as dense and green. Lien never went over it, but at least once a week the housewife had all the sticks and straws and dry leaves swept away from the fresh grass. He looked at the sand passage in front of the house and suddenly pulled his feet together. The children had raked it in real patterns late at night, and his big feet had done terrible damage to the fine work. Just think, how everything grew in this place! The six rowans that guarded the courtyard were tall as beeches and wide as oaks. Such trees had probably never been seen before. They were close, with the thick stems covered with yellow lichens and with large, white clusters of flowers protruding from the dark greenery. He must think of the sky and its stars. One could probably marvel at how the trees grew there in the yard. There stood an old arrow, so thick that two men could not embrace it. It was now rotten and hollow, and the thunder had taken the top of it, but it did not want to die. Every spring, a bunch of fresh green came out of the interrupted main trunk to show that it was alive. That hedge at the east gable had become a tree so large that it overshadowed the whole house. The whole turf roof was white from its fallen flower petals, for the hawthorn had already bloomed. And the birches, which stood in small clusters here and there in the fields, they certainly had their paradise on his farm. There they developed so many different ways of growing, as if they had set out to imitate all the other trees. One was like a linden tree, dense and leafy with a white vault over it, another stood smooth and pyramid-like like a poplar, and a third hung its branches like a teardrop. No one was like the other, and they were all glorious.","It was so early that nobody was as yet awake. Lilliecrona sat down on the green bench outside the main building and looked at his estate. A more beautiful place did not exist. The lawn in front of the house lay in a gentle slope and was covered with fine, light-green grass. There never was such a lawn. The sheep were allowed to graze there and the children to romp there in their games, but it was always just as even and green. The scythe never passed over it, but at least once a week the mistress of the house had all sticks and straws and dry leaves swept from the fresh grass. He looked at the gravel walk in front of the house and suddenly drew his feet back. The children had late in the evening raked it and his big feet had done terrible harm to the fine work. Think how everything grew there. The six mountain-ashes which guarded the place were high as beeches and wide-spreading as oaks. Such trees had never been seen before. They were beautiful with their thick trunks covered with yellow lichens, and with big, white flower-clusters sticking out from the dark foliage. It made him think of the sky and its stars. It was indeed wonderful how the trees grew there. There stood an old willow, so thick that the arms of two men could not meet about it. It was now rotten and hollow, and the lightning had taken the top off it, but it would not die. Every spring a cluster of green shoots came up out of the shattered trunk to show that it was alive. That hawthorn by the east gable had become such a big tree that it overshadowed the whole house. The roof was white with its dropping petals, for the hawthorn had already blossomed. And the birches which stood in small clumps here and there in the pastures, they certainly had found their paradise on his farm. They developed there in so many different growths, as if they had meant to imitate all other trees. One was like a linden, thick and leafy with a wide-spreading arch, another stood close and tall like a poplar, and a third drooped its branches like a weeping-willow. No one was like another, and they were all beautiful.","It was so early that no one was yet awake. Lilliecrona sat down on the green swing outside the manor house and looked at his property.

"Den, som vill se tingens sammanhang, må gå bort från städerna och bo i en enslig koja i skogsbrynet. Må han vakta milan nätterna igenom eller bo ute på de långa sjöarna dag och natt under en ljus sommarmånad, medan timmerflotten gör sin långsamma färd till Vänern, så skall han lära att ge akt på alla tecken i naturen och förstå hur de döda tingen bero av de levande. Han skall se, att då det är oro på jorden, störas de döda tingens fred. Folket vet det. Det är i sådana tider skogsfrun släcker milan, sjörået slår sönder båten, näcken sänder sjukdom, tomten svälter ut kon. Och så var det detta år. Aldrig hade vårfloden härjat så svårt. Ekeby kvarn och smedja voro inte hans enda offer. Små älvar, som fordom, då våren hade gett dem krafter, på sin höjd hade mäktat bortföra en tom lada, gingo nu till anfall på hela gårdar och sköljde bort dem.

It is in such times that the forest lady extinguishes the mile, the sea raft breaks the boat, the nude sends disease, the plot starves the cow. And so it was this year. Never had the spring flood ravaged so hard. Ekeby mill and smithy were not his only victims. Small rivers, as in the past, when spring had given them strength, at most had been able to remove an empty barn, now attacked whole farms and washed them away.

En stor, ranglig, gammaldags täckbåge med nötta gängor och kantstötta trissor önskar jag er, en sådan, vid vilken fem, sex personer kunna arbeta på en gång, där man syr i kapp och tävlar om att få vackra styng på avigsidan, där man äter stekta äpplen och pratar och »reser till Grönland» och »gömmer ringen med förbehåll» och skrattar, så att ekorrarna borta i skogen falla huvudstupa till marken av förskräckelse. En täckbåge för vintern, kära vänner, och ett roskvarter för sommaren! Inte en trädgård, där man måste lägga ner mer pengar, än nöjet är värt, nej, ett roskvarter, såsom det hette förr i världen! Ni skulle ha ett sådant, som ni skulle kunna sköta med egna händer. Små törnrosbuskar skulle stå på toppen av de små jordkullarna och en krans av förgätmigej ringla fram runtom deras fot, där skulle den stora, flaxiga vallmon, som sår sig själv, komma upp överallt, både på gräslisten och i sandgången, och där skulle finnas en brunbränd torvsoffa, i vilken det skulle växa aklejor och kejsarkronor, både i sitsen och på ryggstödet.","Dear friends! Among all the good I wish you, I would first like to mention a cover arch and a rose block. I wish you a large, rickety, old-fashioned cover arch with worn threads and edge-supported pulleys, one in which five, six people can work at once, where you sew in a race and compete to get beautiful stitches on the wrong side, where you eat fried apples and talking and ""traveling to Greenland"" and ""hiding the ring with reservations"" and laughing, so that the squirrels in the forest fall headlong to the ground in terror. A cover arch for the winter, dear friends, and a rose block for the summer! Not a garden, where you have to spend more money than the pleasure is worth, no, a rose block, as it was called in the past in the world! You would have one that you could handle with your own hands. Small thorn rose bushes would stand on top of the small mounds of earth and a wreath of forget-me-nots would curl around their feet, where the large, flaxen poppy, which would sow itself, would come up everywhere, both on the grass and in the sand, and there would be a tanned peat sofa, in which columbines and imperial crowns would grow, both in the seat and on the backrest.","The rose-garden of which I am thinking was owned sixty years ago by an old Madame Moreus in Svartsjö, who made her living by knitting blankets for the peasants and cooking their feasts.","Dear friends! Among all the good things I wish for you, I would first mention a quilting frame and a rosarium. I wish you a large, rickety, old-fashioned quilting frame with worn grooves and chipped spools, the kind at which five, six persons could work at one time, where you sew in teams and compete in making beautiful stitches on the reverse side, where you eat baked apples and talk and “travel to Greenland” and “hide the thimble” and laugh so that the squirrels off in the forest fall headlong to the ground in fright. A quilting frame for winter, dear friends, and a rosarium for summer! Not a garden, where you have to lay out more money than the enjoyment is worth, no, a rosarium, as it was called in former times! You should have such a thing, to care for with your own hands. Small briar-rose bushes should sit atop the small mounds of earth, and a wreath of forget-me-not wind around its foot; there the big, flighty poppy, which seeds itself, could come up everywhere, both on the grass strip and the sand path, and there should be a dried-out turf bank in which there should be columbines and crown imperials, both on the seat and on the back support."

"Grevinnan hämtade henne oupphörligen upp till Borg. Hon spelade komedi för henne och berättade om sina friare, och Mamsell Marie skrattade så, som hon aldrig hade skrattat förr.

"Dock var han så god mot dem, den store konungen. Han botade deras sjuka, återgav de blinda deras syn och uppväckte de döda.","Yet he was so kind to them, the great king.

"Hon kan inte något annat. Innan hennes fingrar stelnade kring visp och förskärarkniv, fick hon lära sig den enda polskan. Den sitter kvar i hennes fingrar, men hon kan inte något annat stycke, inte någon sorgmarsch, inte någon lidelsefull sonat, inte ens en klagande folkvisa, bara den polskan.","She does not know anything else.

"»Det är sant, sant vartenda ord!» utbrister den gamle. »På Gud trodde de, än mer på djävulen, mest dock på trollen i bergen och tomten på logen. All grödan förstördes i brännvinspannan. Ingen kunde se något slut på eländet. I de flesta av de grå stugorna rådde nöd. Dold sorg gjorde kvinnornas tunga bitter. Vantrevnad drev mannen ut till dryckenskap. Åkrar och boskap kunde de inte sköta. De fruktade herremannen och gjorde narr av prästen. Vad skulle man göra med dem? Vad jag sade dem från predikstolen, förstodo de inte. Vad jag ville lära dem, trodde de inte.

Drowsiness drove the man out to drunkenness. They could not manage fields and livestock. They feared the lord and made fun of the priest. What would you do with them?

"Han sätter sig ned och börjar spela.

"Men nu, bäst som de spela, brister han ut i gråt. Han tycker livet, hela livet är så bedrövligt. Han lutar huvudet mot händerna och gråter. Kavaljererna förfäras.

Did we not sit twelve men strong around King Arthur's round table, and did not twelve paladins walk in Charlemagne's army? One of us has been Thor, a Jupiter, such a thing you can still look at us today. You can probably feel the glow of God under the rags, the lion man under the donkey's skin.

Det var inte så lätt, som han trodde, att gifta sig med en ful kvinna. Nu hade han fattat avsmak för henne. Ingen visste bättre än hon själv hur ful hon var. Hon hade nog visat honom, att hon inte önskade några smekningar eller kärleksbetygelser, men han pinades ändå av att tänka på henne som sin hustru, och det blev värre för honom dag för dag.

"Borta på flustret utanför bikupan satt en talgoxe i färd med ett riktigt sataniskt knep. Han skulle ha sig middag förstås, och rätt som det var knackade han mot flustret med sin lilla skarpa näbb.

"Främst av dem alla, som sitta kring bålen, vill jag nämna Beerencreutz, översten med de stora, vita mustascherna, killespelaren, Bellmanssångaren, och jämte honom hans vän och krigskamrat, den tystlåtne majoren, den store björnjägaren Anders Fuchs, och som den tredje i laget den lille Ruster, trumslagaren, som länge hade varit överstens tjänare, men hade vunnit kavaljersrang genom skicklighet i punschbrygd och generalbas. Sedan må omtalas den gamle fänriken Rutger von Örneclou, kvinnotjusaren, klädd i spännhalsduk och peruk, utstyrd i krås och sminkad som en kvinna. Han var en av de yppersta kavaljererna och likaså Kristian Bergh, den starke kaptenen, som var en dråplig hjälte, men lika lätt att lura som en jätte i sagan. I sällskap med dessa två såg man ofta den lille, klotrunde patron Julius, kvick, lustig och väl begåvad: talare, målare, vissångare och anekdotberättare. Gärna drev han sitt skämt med den giktbrutne fänriken och den dumme jätten.","Most of all, sitting around the torso, I would like to mention Beerencreutz, the colonel with the big, white mustaches, the guy player, the Bellman singer, and with him his friend and comrade-in-arms, the quiet major, the great bear hunter Anders Fuchs, and as the third in the team the little Ruster, the drummer, who had long been the colonel's servant, but had won the cavalry rank by skill in punch brew and general bass. Then let's mention the old ensign Rutger von Örneclou, the female magician, dressed in a scarf and wig, dressed in ruffles and made up as a woman. He was one of the best cavaliers and so was Kristian Bergh, the strong captain, who was a deadly hero, but as easy to deceive as a giant in the saga. In the company of these two, one often saw the small, globular patron Julius, witty, funny and well-gifted: speaker, painter, songwriter and anecdotal narrator. He liked to make his joke with the gout-broken ensign and the stupid giant.","First of all who sit about the bowl will I name Beerencreutz, the colonel with the great white moustaches, player of cards, singer of songs; and next to him, his friend and brother in arms, the silent major, the great bear hunter, Anders Fuchs; and, as the third in order, little Ruster, the drummer, who had been for many years the colonel’s servant, but had won the rank of pensioner through his skill in brewing punch and his knowledge of thorough-bass. Then may be mentioned the old ensign, Rutger von Örneclou, lady-killer, dressed in stock and wig and ruffles, and painted like a woman,—he was one of the most important pensioners; also Christian Bergh, the mighty captain, who was a stalwart hero, but as easy to outwit as a giant in the fairy story. In these two men’s company one often saw the little, round Master Julius, witty, merry, and gifted, speaker, painter, songster, and storyteller. He often had his joke with the gout-crippled ensign and the dull giant.","Foremost of all of them who are sitting round the bowl, I will mention Beerencreutz, the colonel with the great white mustaches, kille player, singer of Bellman songs, and along with him his friend and war comrade, the taciturn major, the great bear hunter Anders Fuchs, and as the third in the company little Ruster, the drummer, who had long been the colonel’s servant, but won the rank of cavalier by skillfulness in punsch feats and singing bass. Then old second-lieutenant Rutger von Örneclou, ladies’ man, dressed in cravat and wig, decked out in ruffles and made up like a woman, must be mentioned. He was one of the finest cavaliers, and likewise Kristian Bergh, the strong captain, who was a comical hero, but as easy to fool as a giant in a fairy tale. Short, pear-shaped Squire Julius, witty, amusing, and well talented, was often in the company of these two: orator, painter, singer of songs, and teller of anecdotes. He would gladly practice his wit on the gouty second-lieutenant and the stupid giant."

"Denna konstnären hade sedan målat taket i Svartsjö kyrka. Där hade han velat återge sommardagens uppstigande moln, som förde de saliga in i himmelens härlighet. Handen, som fört penseln, hade varit kraftig, men också något styv, så att molnen mera hade kommit att likna de krusiga lockarna i en allongeperuk än växande berg av mjuk dimma. Och så, som de heliga hade tagit gestalt för målarens fantasi, hade han inte förmått återge dem, utan han hade klätt dem efter människosätt i långa, röda kåpor och styva biskopsmössor eller i svarta kaftaner med stela pipkragar. Han hade givit dem stora huvuden och små kroppar, och han hade försett dem med näsdukar och bönböcker. Latinska sentenser flögo dem ur munnen, och för dem, som han förmenade vara ypperst, hade han anbragt stadiga trästolar på molnryggarna, så att de bekvämt sittande kunde färdas in i evigheten.","This artist had then painted the ceiling in Svartsjö church. There he had wanted to reproduce the rising clouds of summer day, which brought the blessed into the glory of heaven. The hand that carried the brush had been strong, but also somewhat stiff, so that the clouds had come to resemble the curly curls of an allonge wig more than growing mountains of soft mist. And so, as the saints had taken shape for the painter's imagination, he had not been able to reproduce them, but he had dressed them according to man in long, red robes and stiff bishop's hats or in black caftans with stiff pipe collars. He had given them large heads and small bodies, and he had provided them with handkerchiefs and prayer books. Latin sentences made them fly out of his mouth, and for those whom he thought to be supreme, he had placed sturdy wooden chairs on the ridges of the clouds, so that those sitting comfortably could travel into eternity.","That artist had afterwards painted the roof in the Svartsjö church.

"Sedermera fick man nog höra, att Lövenborg hade haft rätt, och att Sintram hade dött julnatten. Somliga sade, att han hade hängt sig själv i fängelset. Andra trodde, att rättvisans tjänare i all hemlighet hade låtit döda honom, ty rättegången syntes gå väl för honom, och det kunde ju inte gå an att åter släppa honom lös över folket i Lövsjö. Ännu andra var det, som trodde, att en mörk herre hade kommit resande i en svart vagn, dragen av svarta hästar, och tagit honom bort ur fängelset. Och Lövenborg var inte den ende, som såg honom under julnatten. Även på Fors vart han sedd och i Ulrika Dillners drömmar. Många berättade om hur han hade visat sig för dem, ända tills Ulrika Dillner flyttade hans lik till Bro kyrkogård.

He was also seen at Fors and in Ulrika Dillner’s dreams. Many told how he had shown himself to them, until Ulrika Dillner moved his body to the Bro churchyard.
